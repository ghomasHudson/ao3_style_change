They were supposed to act like business partners in hotel management, going to Tenerife to explore if they could expand their market. Their real mission was to keep an eye on a wizard who was on parole from Azkaban but had left the country even though he wasn’t allowed to. They were tracking one of his former friends who had suddenly been making several trips to Tenerife and back. It wasn’t a high risk-mission, more like a routine one, but the Department of Alias had gone all out making up background stories for both of them. Harry had suggested that perhaps the names Bert and Ernie were a bit suspicious, but that had earned Harry a stern look from the department head, and a couple of extra pages to read, which took them a week to go through. Though Draco seemed to have tweaked his story a little, judging from the small hiccups Harry could hear from beside him.
“Come on, it’s late. I’ll accompany you to your chambers.”
“Really, Potter?” This he could do. Giving snarky responses to stupid questions. He didn’t often fall back to his old ways, but when there came a chance to save his own face, he took it. “What does one do in the restroom at this fine establishment?” Draco turned and washed his hands before continuing. “If not gossiping with friends, I mean?” He looked at Potter again.
Ron pulled him back. “He’s right, you know, Draco?” He winked at him. “I’ve told you several times to call me Ron.”
After school had ended, Draco had buried himself in studies, and applied for an internship at Gringotts. He’d got accepted on his fifth try, started out as an errand boy and then slowly worked himself upwards. He’d run into Potter from time to time, it always had something to do with some new investigation, and everytime he and his auror partners came by, Potter had a new higher ranking.
“Sure, Ferret and I go
“You’ve been sleeping in my bed the whole week Potter. I’ve waited until you walked out of your room and then led you to my bed, keeping you there until my alarm would ring and then I led you back to yours. My mother used to sleep in my bed when I began to take down her locking charms, keeping me in place.”
“No,” he obviously lied. “We need our best Ministry employees at the ball, to make a spectacular evening. And that’s my last say in it. I will expect to see you there tonight.” Shacklebolt went back into his office, but before he closed the door, he popped his head out again and addressed his secretary, who sat across from Draco. “No more visits today, Dora!” She nodded and tried her best not to stare at Potter, who was still standing in the middle of the room, glaring at Shacklebolt. Shacklebolt then turned to Draco. “I’ll need the latest numbers from the Department of Magical Games and Sports.” Then he disappeared into his office, closing the door behind him.
Harry looked over at him and smiled. “I take the couch, of course. I crash on yours all the time. I’ll be fine!” He went in and threw his bag on the floor beside the sofa and started to rummage through it.
Lucius didn’t seem to have the same control over his own temper when he rose and went around the table to tower over Draco. “There’s nothing wrong with your mother, son. Now leave, and don’t talk to me about this nonsense again.”
Draco stopped in his tracks. “Why?
“Yes! And the idea is brilliant, thank you very much!” Draco answered, then turned to Blaise. “So! Where are we going? I trust you got my list of places that was out of the question?”
Ron slapped Potter on the shoulder, making him jump. He smiled at Draco. “Mate, you made it.”
“I understand that it’s a lot to take in for all of you. There’s no need to apologize,” Potter smiled kindly. “Our diagnosis shows that Narcissa is suffering from spell damage, probably inflicted during the war. The damage has inflicted the part of the brain that’s responsible for language, reasoning, and social behavior. It’s also destroying neurons and their connections in the part of the brain that involves the memory, making your mother forget things and alternate things she sees around her. It’s very much like a muggle disease, and that disease hasn't got a cure either, and I’m afraid us wizards haven’t caught up and solved it yet.”
“You can’t swim?” Malfoy said raising his voice to the point Harry was afraid they would wake up Hermione again.
Harry pulled Draco towards him in a hug, and Draco let out a sob as he buried his face in the crook of Harry’s neck.
Draco looked at some pages, inspirational quotes staring back at him. Offering him nothing other than irritation. He raised his brows in disbelief at Potter, who only shrugged sheepishly in return.
“He’s my son, and he will talk the way he damn pleases.” Draco turned to Scorpius and whispered in his ear, “Don’t say damn.”
“Splendid, thanks for asking.”
“Listen Malfoy, I’m sorry,” Potter blurted out. “I didn’t mean it like that. It was insensitive of me.”
“Since when do you call him Draco? And why would I talk to him before you? We don’t talk! And wait, what do you mean before you do? You talk to him?”
The summer went by and before he knew it it was already September. The beginning of fall was always a busy period at Draco’s workplace. They usually got loads of shipping coming in from different places all over the world, half of it Draco wasn’t even permitted to open. Draco’s job was to manage the storefront and the register, and his boss, Mr Finley, took care of everything behind the scenes. Draco wasn’t allowed to go in the back, which he was kind of grateful for, the less he knew the better. It made his job easier every time the Aurors decided to make a surprise visit, which they did fairly often in the fall.
“You always say I should ask before hugging someone. And Harry looks a bit sad, so I want to hug him.” He looked up at Draco with his big eyes.
Narcissa looked at him for a second and then gave him a tiny smile. “Yes of course, I’m sorry darling. It’s a bit dark here,” she whispered back.
“He wouldn’t shut up about it. I only told him the truth.”
“I haven’t heard you say thank you that many times before, but you’re welcome.”
This night he was drinking firewhiskey, but only because the bartender had looked at him funny when he asked for his classic vodka. He didn’t like the Leaky and most of the time he declined every invite from Pansy to meet up here. But, tonight was Pansy’s birthday and she wanted to celebrate somewhere, where her Gryffindor friends were more comfortable.
Now this was getting ridiculous. Harry felt the wind against his face when he fell backwards from the window onto the hard pavement of the astronomy tower. Somehow the fall didn’t hurt as much one would think falling from that distance, though it would probably leave bruises all over his arse. But it wasn’t like anyone would notice anyway he thought with a sigh, anyone meaning Malfoy.

“Oh, I see,” Draco spat. “Out of pity, right? Poor little Death Eater can’t get a job for himself so he must be helped by the saviour.” He turned towards Harry.
Andromeda nodded. “Yes, but still, thank you.”
“I’m sorry. I shouldn’t–”
“No!” Harry said with a sigh. Really, this was proving to be the longest flight in history, and it was all Harry’s fault. Draco had insisted they take a portkey, but when Harry had found out that Draco had never been on a plane before, he’d felt he wanted to be with him the first time he flew. Of course he hadn’t said that to Draco, instead he’d made it into a bet, saying Draco was too scared to fly the Muggle way, and Draco wasn’t one to turn down a challenge. Apparently, just when Harry thought Draco couldn’t be more obnoxious, he was proven wrong.
“Sure, it was fine,” Potter said to the panel on the wall, not looking at Draco or Michael.
He covered Draco with all of his body, leaving kisses all over his face where he could reach. “That was…” He shook himself, rolling off Draco, gathering him in his arms.
When he approached the dorms, the door was open. Harry had never left it opened before, but he hadn’t tried jumping out of a tower before either, so maybe that wasn’t so strange. Malfoy was asleep on the couch as he always was when Harry returned from his nightly adventures, surrounded by books, but he was breathing hard like he was having a nightmare. Harry took a cautious step forward just telling himself that he should check if he was okay, when Malfoy turned towards him in his sleep. His cheeks were flushed and there were tiny droplets of sweat on his forehead. Harry stopped himself halfway from reaching out to wipe the sweat away, startled by a sound coming from the stairs leading up to the girl’s rooms. He stumbled backwards in his haste to get as far away from Malfoy as possible when Hermione came into view.
Malfoy leaned back to avoid Harry’s wandering fingers. “So that was what you were trying to say.” Malfoy shook his head. “The answer is no, Potter. You can’t borrow my notes.”
Draco smiled. “He does. But I think that I was drunk enough to talk for both of us, I’m sure
“There, done!” Harry said, waving his hands at his trousers. He had configured them a couple of sizes bigger. “Big enough for you, you prude?” Harry winked. Or tried to, but he just looked silly, Draco thought. Or endearing, his treacherous mind told him.
that worthless. He swallowed down the bile in his throat, trying to push the voice out of his head.
Draco was sitting on his bed, it was in the middle of the night and he had heard his mother’s door open and close as usual before her steps vanished further and further away. Scorpius was sleeping under the covers, and his calm breaths were usually enough to guide Draco to sleep, but not tonight. He was fiddling with one of Harry’s letters that he’d kept, locked in one of his drawers. His fingers traced the words at the bottom of the page,
“Interesting, but no.” Draco shook his head.
“Mother?” Draco said, making Narcissa turn. He repeated his question. “Will you be gone for long?”
Draco winced. “No, they’re all elsewhere. I’m sure you already knew that, dear aunt?” He glared at her, knowing that she was hinting at something he didn’t want to acknowledge. “We’ll be having dinner with my parents.”
“You’re not the only one who’s awake at night Harry,” she said while Ron draped an arm around her shoulder. Harry felt regret and shame climbing up his spine and muttered a sorry to her which she returned with a tiny smile.
“Don’t!” Harry said, and his arm flung around and he laid a hand on Draco’s arse, pushing him closer.
The day passed surprisingly fast and smooth, and it was almost midnight when they returned to their hotel.
“Thirsty, Potter?” Draco said, casually.
“Yes, you are,” He grabbed Harry’s hand and linked their fingers together. “And we will talk about that later, after you — “
Draco swallowed. “Don’t you dare compare me to that moron.” He tried to snarl, but it came out more breathless than intended. He was nervous, and nothing good could ever come out of being nervous around Potter.
“Sir! Sir! Sit down, please!” a flight attendant said while walking up to Draco to get him to return to his seat.
She looked at him, frowning a little, but then she smiled and shook her head again. “No, just a short while. We’ll see you later if you’re joining us for lunch?”
“Stop!” Draco took his hand back, laughing, “I can’t go again.”
When Shacklebolt left at 6 pm he gave Draco a pat on the shoulder.
Harry massaged Draco through his trousers, “Yeah? And then what happened?”
Harry cleared his throat while grabbing Draco’s hand again, intertwining their fingers, “We shouldn’t do this at my office, I would never be able to work again without thinking about you,” he smiled sheepishly.
Draco shook his head. “I don’t know what kind of voices Harr– Potter does.”
“Indeed I have. How great of you to notice.” Malfoy turned to Pansy. “Do you mind leaving me a minute alone with Mr Sloshed over here?”
This time it was Harry’s turn to sigh. “I did, yes. But I should’ve said it differently.”
“You slipped while making potions, the cauldron fell on your head. I took you here as fast as I could, but you were already unconscious. You’ve been asleep for about five days.” Potter chewed on his lip. “I thought I’d lost you”.
“I’m not here for Kingsley.”
Harry picked up his glass again and put it to his mouth, but there were no lingering drops left, so he decided to head towards the bar. Another drink wouldn’t hurt him. He wasn’t wasted or anything, just a pleasant buzz under his skin. He still had time to come up with something for tomorrow. The presentation was going to go great. He had Malfoy. Talented Malfoy. The two of them together could certainly pull this off.
The procedure was always the same, Ron was chatty and quite pleasant, while his colleague didn’t trust Draco one bit. They made him show the transaction receipts, tell them about which customers had been in recently, and then they checked the backdoor, trying all different spells to make it open, also getting Draco to try even though he didn’t know the spell. One time he even had to take veritaserum to really make sure the Auror’s knew he wasn’t lying about being unable to go anywhere further in the store than behind the counter. Ron had looked very apologetic that time while his colleague forced the veritaserum down his throat.
“You haven’t slept yet?” Draco asked, leaning in towards her touch.
As he lay in bed that night, he was too exhausted to keep his feelings shoved down, and his treacherous mind was no help when it conjured image after image of Harry in that soft sweater, and the heat from his thigh pressed up against Draco’s own, and that brief touch of Harry’s broad fingers on his knee. He couldn’t help to imagine what they would feel like trailing up towards his crotch, maybe tracing the inseam of his trousers as he did so. How would Harry look if they were alone, and he had glided off the sofa and placed himself between Draco’s parted legs? Would he have spread them more? Letting his large hands sweep up over his thighs and place one of them on Draco’s growing erection, massaging the bulge as he slowly opened his zipper. Draco let his own hand dip below the waistband of his pyjama bottoms, grabbing his cock with a firm grip and wishing for a larger, broader hand instead of his own. How would Harry’s fingers feel around his cock? Would he be gentle, stroking Draco slowly up and down, or would he be rough, pinning Draco against the sofa, maybe holding him down as he placed a warm mouth around Draco’s cock, keeping a firm grip as he took Draco further and further in.
“Hey, Malfoy?”
“Please don’t be late tonight Draco. I want you to meet with a friend of mine from Estonia, he’s been dying to meet you and quiz you about the analysing system you came up with.”
Draco choked on his coffee and felt his cheeks warm. ”I did no such thing!”
“You would’ve said yes? To me? But you don’t like me,” Malfoy said with a frown.
He slung an arm over Hermione’s shoulders when he reached the bar, and gave her a kiss on the cheek. He could see both Pansy and Malfoy looking at him funny, but he was too happy to care. He gave them a little wave instead.
“Not every night, only a couple of times.”
“It’s a job. I don’t exactly have any other offers lining through the door now, do I?”
and turned to Draco. “What are you doing? You’re almost blowing our cover, he could be on this plane you know,” he hissed.
“Okay, if you say so. I still want to buy you a pint, we haven’t had the chance to talk much outside of this place,” he said, gesturing around the shop. “Tell you what. Rose is spending time with Andromeda tomorrow night, she’s jealous of Teddy that he gets to have such a cool grandmother. I love my mom but she can be a bit overbearing, you know?” Ron rambled. “Maybe Scorpius can join them for a sleepover and we can get together?”
His mother looked confused but shook her head. “I don’t know, dear.”
“I didn’t go that far. I came here.” Potter seated himself on the edge of Draco’s desk. “I was thinking that you might show up.”
Draco woke up to the unmistakable sound of curtains being drawn, the early light of April filtering through his room. He drew the cover over his head, but he knew it was only a matter of seconds before someone climbed into his bed, and with a little luck, that someone would not knee him in his balls this morning.
They sat in silence for a while. Draco knew that none of them would ever get over the loss of his wife and Scorpius’ mother, and neither did he want them to. It wasn’t a marriage based on love between the two of them, but loved her he had. She became his best friend, and losing her was like losing one of the very reasons to live. The only reason Draco didn’t leave this world with her was Scorpius, who meant everything to him, someone he would never abandon or let anything bad happen to. Draco had sworn to be a better person, a better dad than his own, and give Scorpius the life he deserved. Nothing Draco had done before in his life had made him worthy of Scorpius, he was well aware of that. But, he fought every day for a reason to believe that he deserved to be his father.
Harry laughed. “Your snoring said otherwise.” He ignored Malfoy’s spluttering protest and continued on. “Anyway, I was thinking of heading home. I finished the case files for today, except for the rest of Mrs Lindons reports which I’ll leave for tomorrow. Robards can take all of my cases, I don’t fucking care anymore. I’d rather take an unforgivable curse than continue to work on this.”
Draco woke up to the smell of coffee, and then the utter humiliation of the day before hit him. Never in his life had he opened up like this to a person who wasn’t Astoria. He had a sudden urge to flee and leave Harry in the kitchen, not owning up to his own drunken mistakes, but then he remembered everything that Ron had told him yesterday and it made him stop in his tracks. He was almost halfway to the Floo when Harry came into the room with two cups in his hands.
He went inside one of the stalls and spelled the toilet lid clean before he sat down. He closed his eyes, trying to make sense of the weird feeling that struck him everytime Potter clearly dismissed him. He already had this conversation with himself several times before, what Potter and other people thought of him didn’t matter. He shouldn’t have to lock himself in the restroom and have a personal crisis. It was a nice evening. Ron and Granger had both made him feel welcome, and Luna had offered a sense of forgiveness and calmness he hadn’t thought he craved. Draco opened his eyes and looked around at his pathetic hiding place. He should continue his evening out, try to have a good time. Maybe talk to Luna some more. Just when he was about to leave the stall, the door to the restroom opened and Ron’s voice came through.
“You mean cockpit, Bert. It’s called a cockpit. You’re absolutely sloshed aren’t you?” Harry asked, trying to keep his voice down.
“I’m sorry I didn’t say anything sooner, but to be fair, neither did you,” Harry countered. “But I would like to get to know you more. I would love to spend more time with you and Scorpius. If you want to?” He looked nervously back at Draco.
“We all think that.” Harry kissed his forehead before he continued. “And I want to comfort you by telling you it will be better, and that her happy memories will last forever, or whatever crap that Muggle book tells you, but it won’t. It only gets worse from here on forward, and that’s a shitty thing to tell a grieving person, but it's the truth, and at least you deserve the truth. And I can’t help it or stop it, but I can be by your side while it's happening, if you want me to. I want to,” he said with such an honest expression that Draco had to look away.
“Read it, dad!” Scorpius nudged him in the side. “Do the voices.”
“May I?” Draco asked, reaching for the book. Potter handed it to him and their fingers brushed against each other. Draco felt silly to react to such a simple touch, but sitting this close to Potter made things stir in him that he always tried to keep deep down.
“I know. And I did, I think. I tried to build my own life with Astoria and Scorpius, but when she died I became dependent on my parents again.”
“Just making the rounds, Draco,” Ron smiled, picking up one of the figurines and inspecting it closely, while Auror Jon Kristoff was hovering behind him.
Draco snorted. “Don’t overdo it, Potter.” He shook his head. “Come on now Scorpius, let’s get going.
That did nothing to subdue Draco’s surprise, but he schooled his features instead of asking what Harry had been saying. “Fine, I’ll talk to Andromeda. But we haven’t spoken in a while so I’m not sure she’ll say yes,” Draco warned.
“Me too, Darling. Me too.”
“What do you mean we only have one room? Surely there must be some kind of mistake? Check the names again,” Draco told the witch, who had just dropped the bomb that he was about to share a room with Harry for three days.
“Oh!” Potter looked relieved. “Well, as I said this kind of condition your mother has is more common in the muggle world, and this is some of the material they hand out to relatives. As a sort of consolation, I think. It’s often that the family is affected more by the disease than the person suffering from it. The book offers some perspective, or at least that’s what I’m told.”
“I don’t know really. I remember being me, where I live and work. But all the details are a little bit fussy.”
Potter didn’t answer. He gave Draco a look that was hard to describe as anything other than heated. He put his drink down and patted Shacklebolt on the back before he walked away. Everything in Draco screamed at him to follow Potter, but Shacklebolt stopped him, wanting to hear everything he and Mr Rebane had discussed.
Swishing his wand, he marked a large circle on the grass in red paint. He then cast several heavy-duty cushioning charms over the ground within the circle. As he did so, he decided this would probably be a good technique for his first-year students, as well. It took too much energy to protect the whole field, but the first years didn’t move around enough for that to matter, yet.
The door creaked open, and he walked into a small dimly-lit room with moth-eaten curtains pulled over the windows. It could barely be called a flat; even Draco’s room felt spacious in comparison. Granted, Draco’s room wasn’t piled high with evidence. Boxes upon boxes towered in the corners of the room and piles of papers and files were scattered around every flat surface. Mel looked up from where she sat cross-legged on a small camp bed along the wall and smiled. Her eyes were tired, but Harry could see the relief in them.
“Ugh, yeah.” Harry sat back. “I’m supposed to officially have it back in my possession tonight, after they finish with the last of the evidence gathering. The damage seems mostly limited to the ground floor and stairwell.”
“I was thinking,” Mel said, “we could set up an area for the werewolf family and house-elves and any other species that can be let out safely.” She gestured to Harry to follow her to the back corner. “I was thinking we could conjure some sofas and blankets?”
Harry whimpers. He doesn’t know; he can’t bring himself to care. All he wants is to find his release.
Draco froze and then slowly extricated himself from under Harry. “Right.”
Harry opened his mouth, about to voice his confusion, when he felt Draco’s hand slip lower. Then a slap came, short and quick, right on his bollocks. Harry forced himself to stay still, fighting against the instinct to try to close his legs. He pressed his lips together as Draco rained down the rest of the ten smacks. By the end, his bollocks felt like they were on fire. The smacks hadn’t been particularly hard, but they were more than enough on such a sensitive area.
“Er—should we do something about it?” Harry asked, watching the large bird run in circles before heading towards the Great Lake.
Mel said.
“Okay, I can do that,” Harry said, relaxing into Draco and letting himself be held and comforted. He let himself be the one being taken care of for once as Draco rocked him gently and kept him safe all throughout the night.
“Okay, I want to try something. Let’s go over to the side here,” Harry said, gesturing to a spot away from the other students.
“Yeah…” Harry wished he could feel angry about it… He just felt weary. “Can I—I know it’s a lot to ask—” Harry looked around the small room, realising just how much of an imposition he would be.
Draco slid his dressing gown off his shoulders, hanging it on a hook by the door, and walked over to Harry, sinking to his knees, arms crossed at the small of his back, and dropping his head. His eyes wouldn’t stay still, though, as they travelled over the beautiful rope.
“Malfoy, you’ve done nothing but insult me since the moment I got here. Publically, at that!”
“We thought it was potions—” Harry started, before coughing against Draco’s shoulder to clear his throat.
“That’s exactly what that means,” Harry replies, his lips curving into a smile as he dips down and kisses the hollow of Draco’s neck.
As the new keeper finally made a save, Harry yelling out in relief, the floorboards near the stairs creaked. Harry glanced over briefly. Then stopped and looked back slower.
For the next hour, they fell into one easy conversation after another. Harry filling Draco in on things he’d missed, reminiscing about classmates, talking about their lives as they were now. They’d got quieter when discussing magical things as the pub slowly filled up, but the conversation never wavered or became stilted or forced.
Harry lowered the phone and his hand, resting them on his stomach as he waited for the telltale pop of apparition.
Harry lifts himself on his elbows, a grin on his face. “You’re the one who always insists you have impeccable taste.”
“Perfect. I’ll be there on Saturday.” Justin flashed him an entirely too-white smile.
Harry stood up so fast, his chair fell back. “I think we finally have a lead.”
“No, ‘course, ye are. First week is always hectic.” Hagrid smiled and shuffled his feet. “So, erm—I don’t suppose yeh’ve seen the Diricrawl again? I heard it was wandrin’ about on the pitch.”
“From where? I’m transparent!” He waved his hand through the nearest pile of books to illustrate his point.
“That’s the plan,” he said mildly.
“Potter. You always think I’m up to something.”
“Yep.”
“Did you like them?” he murmured, against Harry’s mouth.
the dough, it’s done nothing to harm you; wrap it in a Cooling Stasis and set it aside for twenty minutes to rest before you try rolling it out again,
He considered protesting, considered going downstairs to spend time with both of them. He was here to visit them, after all. But honestly, all he wanted was to curl up in the soft quiet of the room, and Luna was smiling her permission at him.
“Harry,” Ginny said. “Your soup’s getting cold.”
Her face appeared above the books. “Oh, hullo, Harry! I didn’t hear you come in. How are you this morning?”
At the sharp tone in his voice, Ginny sat up, laughter gone. She rubbed a tear from the corner of her eye. “Why not?”
She blinks up at him, gives herself a little shake. “Yes. Right here.” She rummages through a bag she left on the kitchen table. “Did you get something before you left?”
“Oh. Er. Thanks.” Harry took a handful. It felt soft and cool in his hand, like flour. “And—thanks for the trip. That was really great.”
Hermione thanks him again, the edges of her eyes pinched, bottom lip pulled up into her teeth. Harry sits for another few minutes after she’s gone. The fire’s returned to its normal orange. The cup of peppermint tea lies cold on the side table. He takes it to the kitchen to dump it, then lingers to make himself a sandwich. He slept more than six hours in the drawing room after returning from Malfoy’s earlier. Merlin. He washes the sandwich down with a glass of pumpkin juice. He still feels a little off. Probably sleeping through half the day in a chair had something to do with that.
He’s got the memory in the pensieve, he realizes. He could watch it. Not to read the letters this time, but to study the expression on Malfoy’s face, like maybe he can parse it out.
Harry bristles. His hand tightens on the Section III FORCE form. It’s Malfoy’s right to read it. He knows this. But his instinct is to say “no.” Malfoy meets his gaze and doesn’t blink.
“We’ll bring it out to you.”
“Right,” Harry says. He finally falls silent, hands still clutched around the teacup, though it’s gone cold.
As he changed into something more presentable in his room, it hit him how easy that had been to decline Luna’s job shadowing opportunity. Maybe that was all he’d needed to do from the beginning: tell her the truth. Huh.
“With pleasure,” Malfoy said, very close now, pushing into his personal space, close enough to hear him breathe.
“Oh.”
The letter is dated for nearly a year ago. He recognizes what it is now. It’s a request for access to records under the Freedom of Information Act. Harry has seen requests like this before. It’s not uncommon for the Ministry to request access to information held by universities and other organizations. But this request includes months’ worth of Malfoy’s correspondences—any that were written using the university letterhead or made via the university office floo—not to mention a staggering list of academic documents regarding potions manufacture.
“Oh. That probably was Draco, then,” Luna said. “Was he making rye sourdough? He usually makes the rye on Wednesdays.”
He seemed to be waiting for Harry, so Harry joined him. He turned the telescope and glanced into the view scope as he adjusted its position, then stepped back. “Right there.”
“Here,” Malfoy said, and the platform came to a smooth stop. Malfoy pulled a book from the shelf. He flipped through it for a minute, nodded, tucked it under his arm, and asked the platform to return them to the floor.
Slightly concerned, if anything.”
“It’s so nice to have someone to work with,” Bill said with a smile when he returned, brushing crumbs from his shirt and resuming his spot on the floor next to Harry.
Ginny slowed the car and took them onto a narrow lane that led down, down, down and around a bend, where the trees cleared and revealed swathes of rolling golden hills, meandering fences, and a house surrounded by lush gardens.
Malfoy smirked. Then he narrowed his eyes. “It’s interesting how some things don’t change, isn’t it?”
The sitting room was neat, an airy space with books along one wall, a fireplace that looked like it was never used, and a large painting of a pastoral scene above the hearth. A grandfather clock ticked in the corner.
was going to happen had spread to his elbow joints, his chest, and the corners of his jaw. He stopped in the middle of the dim space and shook himself.
His healer comes in a few minutes after Hermione leaves. They might have passed in the hall.
For the second day in a row, Harry pushed open the door of Knead. This was beginning to feel familiar, like a habit. He walked in at lunchtime, close to the time Malfoy’s shift would be ending. The shop smelled strongly of cheese and meat. The crowd looked a little different today, people mostly in pairs and small groups, eating sandwiches and drinking beverages.
It had been years since he’d seen Parkinson. She and Malfoy were turned towards each other with wide smiles, and Harry’s stomach jumped again, but not in a pleasant way this time. Because—Harry didn’t like that smile. It wasn’t the same smile he’d become fond of over the last couple of weeks. It reminded him of a time he would rather forget.
“Spit it out, Potter. What is it?”
In the end, it was the five of them: Harry, Ginny, Luna, Malfoy, and Parkinson. Harry braced himself for more taunting from Parkinson, but she was surprisingly subdued today. She gave him a polite nod when they all met on the little hill, but otherwise directed her attention to Luna as Luna finished walking circles around the spot that would become the new home for the tree.
“The woman knows what she likes,” Malfoy said. “Leave her alone.”
Harry stares at him. Then he stands, bending swiftly to place the plate on the chair.
like it was
Malfoy took a look across the field and nodded. “Great idea with the markers. We each take a corner. I see. Well. It can’t go any worse than last time. It can only go better.”
Ron frowned. “What’s a barrister? Those miserable bastards who work in the Muggle Wizengamot?”
Everyone in the court turns to the new voice. A deep voice, rough and familiar. Harry’s heart leaps.
The last of the memories played out, and Harry understood.
“Spell designer?” Luna said.
“Hermione?”
. Harry grinned around the mouth of the bottle.
Harry was only half paying attention to his food, though. He couldn’t stop staring at Malfoy’s fine, soft hair blowing in the wind and the way Malfoy brushed it out of his face every so often.
bookshop. The biggest in America, even by non-magical standards. But it’s even bigger than the non-magicals know.” Malfoy shot Harry an evil grin, and Harry nearly walked into the edge of the door.
To cover up his bewilderment, Harry pointed at the mug. “What the hell was that?”
He dresses in khaki trousers and a burgundy jumper. Then, after a moment’s hesitation, he pulls on his auror robes.
Very fucking grateful, actually.
Harry huffed. “I don’t, all right. I…” His eyes warmed. Too close. His emotions were too close to the surface. He’d almost forgotten what they were like, bubbling under his skin. But he pursed his lips, pressed on. “When I saw you in the Ministry. When they brought you in…” His voice failed. Malfoy regarded him with an inscrutable expression. Harry scowled. “I was really fucking angry, all right? I thought. Fuck. I thought I was sending you to Azkaban.” He covered his face. Fresh tears tracked down his cheeks. Shit. Why was he still here?
“For the most part. I also got tired of competing all of the time. It’s kind of nice to lord it over a group of students. The magical community college had a position open, so I thought I’d try it. I liked it.”
“Spit it out. Whatever it is, Potter. That look on your face distresses me.”
it. He reveled in the sense of power; it was the first time he’d ever felt completely in control of himself, and by extension, the world around him. He could relax on pub nights without worrying about his emotions scrawling across his face. He hid boredom during staff meetings. Smirked at the wizards and witches who tried to befuddle him with a look.
They sped down the gently sloping hill and came to a panting stop at the broom shed. The silver stag reared and burst in a shower of stars.
Potter blinked again, then scowled. “Yes, that satisfies, thank you.”
in this endless moment, moving.
“Thanks,” Malfoy deadpans. “Potter, these…quiches…are atrocious.”
“If you’d like to move on, I will show you my pride and joy.”
. The flash of white fur he’d been waiting for. Ah-ha.
Harry assumed undressing was in order, though Malfoy was still clothed (except, of course, for his narrow feet, which now rested on the floor). For a brief instant, he considered whether he wanted Malfoy to spell his clothes off again; the sudden crackle of Malfoy’s magic had been
Then Malfoy pulled back. Harry was dazed, crazed. Malfoy loomed over him, mouth spit-shiny and swollen, and smirked.
Harry grimaces. “I didn’t know you heard that.”
spring, not yet,” he argued with it.
She nods. “That’s for the best.” But her gaze is unwavering.
This is the same state Harry is in several hours later when the inter-office memo slips through the crack in his door and unfolds in the air in front of him with a crackle. “Potter. My office now.”
“All right. Fine. You’ve had your fun.”
Draco Malfoy is a philanthropist, and he seems to have kept it a secret. But that makes no sense. What kind of benefit would Malfoy get from engaging in charity work without telling anyone?
he didn’t add.
It was clean and appealing and very Muggle. A short queue had formed in front of the counter, where a child stood on tiptoe to peer into a glass case of pastries. Little bags of coffee lined the neighboring shelf.
He snorted. “You wish.”
“Did he
Draco laughed. “’Fuck off.’ Short for, ‘I don’t have a better comeback.’”
“No?” Ron said. “No future in hat-selling for you, then?”
This time, Malfoy grasped Harry’s hands and placed them on his own head. Reeling, shivering with pleasure, Harry didn’t understand at first—then Harry gripped the fine white-blond hair. Gently. Then Malfoy’s teeth grazed his shaft, and his fists tightened automatically. Malfoy moaned. The sound traveled through Harry, and he gripped tighter, and Malfoy gave a guttural groan and deepened his movements.
Draco smiled thinly. “The sheep in the next county heard you coming up the road.”
There aren’t many people in the office when he arrives—many of them will be out in the field at this time—but he feels the weight of several gazes on him. He ignores them as he strides towards the head auror office.
,” he gasped. “How does that feel so good?”
Draco leaped backwards and flailed his arms. Tea went flying. Something large and thin dropped onto his plate—a packet of letters from the leg of the owl that screeched again, made a broad turn, and swept back out through the window.
Ah. “You can’t talk. Is this a correct statement?”
“And it has a double shot of espresso.”
Malfoy scoffs and rolls his eyes. “Really? What are we? Fifteen?”
Ginny was in full-on convulsions now, and Harry’s alarm and confusion rose. “There’s no way Draco Malfoy lives in Oregon and works in a coffee shop.”
She gives him a watery smile. “You’re fine.”
Malfoy scoffed but didn’t let go. “All right. But if you’re staying, I’m taking you to look at my etchings again.”
After a time, they turned onto a tree-lined street and then pulled into a car park next to a long building with many windows.
She plucked the hat from his head and dropped it onto her own, turning the bill so it pointed sideways.
, too. The little frown of concentration. The meticulousness of the piles. The unconscious refinement with which he moved.
Harry didn’t have the chance to ask Malfoy what charm he used to block the kitchen’s light from the front of the shop. He turned back to find Malfoy giving him a once-over. Malfoy waved his wand.
Robards stands behind his desk, both hands planted on its surface, looming like a bear. “What do you think you’re doing? You can’t get out of explaining why you were at Draco Malfoy’s residence this morning.”
Afterward, Harry collected the dishes and set a Cleaning Charm on them in the kitchen.
“Excuse me?”
to do?”
Meeting Malfoy’s eyes, Harry said, “Of course.”
“Thanks,” he says, when she returns with the little bucket. He slices one down the middle and lays the flat side against the cutting board. “The aurors visited this morning.”
Harry, in the process of lifting the first glass of beer to his mouth, paused just short of inhaling the liquid. “What?”
“What? No.”
as if he had, especially when Malfoy came to a graceful landing and held up the Snitch. He looked smug and beautiful, illuminated from above by the glowing spheres—as if he really were some mysterious creature, not quite human.
The motorway unrolled before them. Harry felt the same feeling he got when he was on the farm, holding a broom and hearing the countryside whisper its invitation to keep going and going.
“Did you really bake all of those?”
The cider was sweet and tart, some kind of berry thing, or so he gathered from the picture on the label. “This is good,” he said. “What are you having?”
obliviate me?”
One pale eyebrow lifted.
of the magic-repressing effects of this byproduct? They’ve known for years! It’s all here—in public records, no less!”
Edward grinned. “Probably not.”
“Malfoy—” He twists to follow Malfoy’s movement and smacks his head against the fireplace. “
“I like being an Auror. I didn’t like the politics. I didn’t like the paperwork.”
Malfoy speaks carefully but evenly and with calm eye contact. Flat and unblinking, almost serene.
Robards closes his eyes. He appears to be drawing on his strength. Then he leans forward, reaching across his desk for a blank form. He scribbles onto it with loud scratches of his quill. “Next week. Early as we can schedule it.” He leans back, drops the form into his outbox. “I want this case closed. We’ve spent more time on Malfoy than he’s worth.”
Draco leaped. Dirt sprayed.
“Almost missed it,” she said. “Come on.”
“Yes, in fact. I trust their judgment. And if they say it’s worth getting to know you, then it is.”
“One more to go, “ Draco murmured.
“It’s an onion blossom,” Luna said to Harry, as the waiter set down the plate. “A treat, since we exerted a lot of energy today. Especially you, Draco.”
“Me. You.”
which he still hasn’t looked at yet. Wonders how many witches and wizards have read it by now, along with the article in the
They stepped outside. Harry looked up at the sky and thought about the invitation he’d felt from the forest and the land to explore. It was still there, still tugged at him. But the breeze felt playful, and the pull to explore could wait.
“No!”
Harry felt the urgency of an impending orgasm. In an attempt to hold it off, he pulled out almost all the way before pushing back in again, slowing his rhythm. He grasped Malfoy’s cock, squeezed and twisted in the ways that had made Malfoy wild earlier.
Harry wasn’t expecting that response. His mouth goes inexplicably dry. “What are you doing?”
Despite the abundance of plants and the comforts of the cottage, Draco lived in relative poverty.
“Sorry,” Harry adds. “It was the glitter.”
. Just—fuck off, will you, and leave me to die in peace.”
“I’m sure I have no idea what you’re talking about, Potter.”
Malfoy narrowed his eyes, then shook his head. “Here, see?” He pointed to where the paper had dimpled under the phrase that he had searched for.
“That’s wonderful. We thought of installing a fridge like that for our produce and milk, but I think our basement works just as well,” Luna said.
The Mark was a non-magical tattoo. Harry could make out the faded pink scar of the original Mark beneath the tattoo, which was made up of dozens and dozens of words in a fine black script. Names.
Malfoy narrows his eyes, but Harry ignores him and pushes to his feet.
Leaves rustled. A hemp cord hanging over the pathway swayed. Draco didn’t move, only gave another whistle.
good that he quit the aurors. True, he shouldn’t have left quite in that fashion, but he’s too tangled with Malfoy now to stay involved with his case; and really, no matter how he left, whether it was with a
It would have driven Hermione mad, and—with a small smile to himself—Harry suspected that it
“And you weren’t going to tell me?” Harry said.
“No socks!”
“Oi!”
“Yes… A correct observation.” Malfoy’s voice sounded a shade defensive.
“Gifts don’t work unless you open them, generally,” he said, instead.
“But I never make as many as you.”
They didn’t say anything else for a while.
Right. Naturally.
Before he could give into the temptation to tip the lone brass cauldron onto the floor, he turned to his other brews. He stirred the Pepper-Up and added roses to the beautifying potion before turning down the heat on the blood-replenishing draught.
“Oh.”
Harry stopped to watch from across the street. An occasional car passed by, briefly blocking Harry’s line of sight, but he didn’t pay them any attention. The sight of the man’s hands pushing into the dough—turning it, pressing it back together again—arrested him. Maybe it was the confident, sure movement. Maybe it was the way the man coolly ignored the two people staring from just the other side of the window. Maybe it was the total focus he directed onto the task. Harry had seen Molly make bread plenty of times; he’d even made bread, himself. But the baker behind the window was completely absorbed by his task in a way that made it something more.
“All right. Let us know if you change your mind.” Hermione gave him one of her unreadable looks. He sensed something being unsaid. But maybe he was imagining it. He still felt off-kilter.
Just as Harry is wondering if one more floo jump would kill his appetite, Malfoy sits up and says, “I think that’s it for now. Granger, thank you for your help.”
“That simple, huh?”
“Er. Well.” He tells her about the manner in which he left.
“Potter. That’s the actual view outside.”
“Wow,” he breathed.
Ginny stifled a laugh, but Harry couldn’t keep a snort from escaping.
Potter glared and opened his mouth, but before he could deliver a heated rebuttal, Draco said, “Stay here till I return. And
Draco met his gaze calmly, though his mouth had gone dry. “All right then, Potter. No need to pop a nonexistent blood vessel.” And because
It was odd to be walking these streets with someone else. He’d got used to exploring them on his own. His gaze skated over the shop windows as they passed. Even in the reflection, Malfoy’s hair shone bright in the summer sun.
Harry laughed. “Give me that, you tosser.”
Malfoy pursed his lips. “Did you use a starter?”
But the smell as he pushed the door open wasn’t bad. The sound of a tinkling bell, like a cat collar’s, greeted him, followed by a chorus of meows.
She completes her set of diagnostics and performs a complicated charm that eases his lungs. He takes a deep, relieved breath.
“Or just as bad.”
“There, there,” Ginny told him through snorts of laughter.
Malfoy’s eyes widened, then narrowed. “I’ve already had dinner.”
“Fine. I’ll watch your memories. But only because I need any insight I can get into…this disastrous situation.”
Harry’s chest swelled, and he laughed. “You can, but there’s no need.”
“What can I get you?” the cashier said when he reached the front. It took a moment for the words to register in his caffeine-starved brain because of their unfamiliar cadence.
He patted a hand to his hair, though he doubted that was the source of the attention. He’d seen messier hair than his. And he’d placed a glamour on his scar that morning, not because he worried he’d be recognized in Muggle Portland but because the shape of the scar tended to draw its own kind of attention. As far as he could tell, the glamour was still in place.
Fingers card softly through Harry’s hair. He lets his eyes drift shut. Hermione thought it would be a good idea for them to make a tour of wizarding institutions across the UK. Mostly secondary education institutions, but Hogwarts is on the list, as well as a potions research collective. Harry will be the main speaker. He doesn’t care for the speaking engagements—he would rather be nodding off at the kitchen table as Draco and Hermione go off on another tangent—but a lot of people do show up at them. They show up to see
Malfoy’s eyes light up madly, like he’s waiting for something. Like he’s waiting for Harry to take a shot at him.
“I guess I didn’t.” He shrugs. Something occurs to him, and he frowns. “Why
It wasn’t like Harry had to go, and it’d taken him forever to fall asleep, no thanks to that chai drink. He could just throw back a Sleeping Potion and sleep in tomorrow. But that was probably what Malfoy wanted.
, Malfoy said.
“That’s not non-magical,” Harry said.
Harry had no response to that—at least none that was polite—so he didn’t say anything else till they got to the house, and Luna showed him how to hang the herbs to dry.
“Always,” Edward conceded. “But we can’t have the praise going to your head. You might decide you’re too good for us and leave for the big city.”
“Home, I’d guess.”
Just beyond view, the surf pounded against the rocks. Water sloshed against the sides of Thor’s Well. Every so often, an especially strong surge burst into the air.
Ron said, “You don’t mean those fancy coffee drinks, do you? But that’s brilliant. That means coffee for us.”
“You’ll be fine,” he told himself. “You’ve achieved far greater feats under more pressure than this.”
He made his way back to the house, picked up his bag, and went in through the back door. On his way to the stairs, he stopped in the kitchen. The fridge hummed. The bamboo wind chime clacked outside the window.
Harry listened hard. Occasionally he ran into foreign wizards and witches. He knew enough of French, Russian, Italian, and a few other languages to at least recognize which translation charm he needed. But he shook his head at this.
Ginny grinned. “Not bad, huh?”
He filled the kettle. The best thing to do when he woke with this feeling was to get on with his morning. Sometimes it meant an unexpected storm was on the way. Sometimes it meant they’d be out of eggs down in the village.
“Yes. I already told you this.”
There was actually one thing left that he hadn’t done yet. He went to one of the spare rooms they had finished early on in the repairs and knelt in front of a cabinet. Tapping his finger against the door, he muttered the unlocking spell.
Malfoy raises his chin. “Then he put up a shield charm.”
“I quit.”
Draco smirked. He leaned over Harry. “Do you know what kept me alive?” he murmured near his ear.
“I know what
It opens to admit him, which is a relief. He didn’t realize how apprehensive he was that Robards had already removed his clearance until the knob turned in his grip. He closes the door behind him. Locks it, not that it will matter much. He won’t need it for long.
“That’s right, Harry. Go on, then.”
Some time later, they met back together, and Harry showed Malfoy his haul of stones. He had spent some time looking for the most beautiful ones to show Malfoy, but Malfoy only frowned. He plucked several from Harry’s hand and tossed them onto the ground.
“What took you so long?” he snaps.
“Go out with me.”
Then a little while after that, Draco pulls away. His lips are red and his cheeks are pink and his hair sticks up in attractive clumps. “Hermione’s going to wonder where I am.”
“Cheers,” Harry said.
“Um. Yes.”
Harry, remembering the flying books he’d left knocking about the library in Grimmauld, made a face. Were the books still flying around? Possibly, unless the magic had worn itself out, or maybe they’d got through the window and were off terrorizing Muggles in London. Oops. Well. He hadn’t heard from Ron and Hermione, which he was bound to, if anything like that had happened.
“Yeah. Sure.”
“Oh, no. He’d be glad to see you. You did save his life.”
“What’s that, then?” Edward asked, looking at the length of hawthorn.
He did like Curse-Breaking when he was practicing it alongside Bill. They kept up an easy conversation, and any time Harry got stuck on a curse, Bill figured out the bit that was giving him trouble. But one afternoon, Bill went downstairs to get lunch, while Harry volunteered to keep working on the curse that had been giving them trouble all day. Not a particularly tricky curse—just time-consuming to pull apart. Alone in the attic, picking apart the little knots of magic, Harry quickly grew bored and exhausted and lonely.
“Potter?” Malfoy asked softly.
Predictably, Malfoy snorted. This didn’t offend Harry, though. He would snort at himself, really.
“I do. I enjoy what I do.”
“All right then, you little bastard.”
Could have. Could have. Could have.
His dark thoughts follow him into the bathroom and then down the stairs into the kitchen. He paces, bare feet on chill wooden floor. The space looks unexpectedly normal with the lights on, not like it is the middle of the night. Smells of rosemary and meat still hang in the air.
Fuzzily, in the reality of Luna and Ginny’s guest bedroom, Harry slid his hand into his trousers. In the daydream, Malfoy slid his hands over Harry’s flanks, down over the top of his arse, up to his chest, thumbs rubbing over Harry’s nipples.
“Okay.”
“When’s the last time you had ice cream?” Malfoy asked.
Him and his pitiful face and so-called forgetfulness and his unmistakable lies and still-messy hair and his attempts to
The only unique feature was a basket of flowers hung next to the front window. White daffodils with yellow centers like small suns.
“Ready?” Harry said, holding up the Snitch.
. Do you really think my magic functions?”
“It’s not as bad as it could be,” she says, though. “But you’ve certainly set back your healing, and you’ve demonstrated that your body is still incapable of casting powerful spells.”
“I remember Pansy. Didn’t you two date?”
Harry didn’t mind. Cottage pie was
He doesn’t know quite what he’s looking for. Pieces to the puzzle, perhaps—one that is rapidly growing and filling with more holes.
Malfoy smirked and took a pull of his beer. Harry resisted the urge to tip the glass into Malfoy’s face.
They brought Malfoy to Interrogation Room Three. Harry ended the binding spell; Malfoy didn’t have his wand, so it wasn’t like he’d get far.
He cleared his throat. “I, uh. I know you’re working. Just thought I’d drop by to get my coffee fix”—he held up his own coffee cup—“and say that last night was amazing.”
“Mr. Malfoy’s research into Poesy Potions.”
To Draco’s dismay, Edward did not go to the front door, but instead stopped in the kitchen to finish his cup of coffee.
Alarmingly, it’s Malfoy who responds. “What’s this, Potter? Are you so upset at being caught off-guard that you’re resorting to making up stories? You wanted to be the one to bring me in yourself, did you? Are you mad that you didn’t pull the truth from my lips yourself? I took veritaserum willingly, you know. I bet you expected me to cover the truth to the end, didn’t you. You resent that my sentence will be reduced.”
“I knew it the moment you showed me those letters. I just— It was easier to think you hadn’t changed. But you have, haven’t you? The research and the charities—”
Malfoy let out a little helpless noise. Harry smiled into his mouth and cupped his face, stroked Malfoy’s mouth with his tongue. Malfoy relaxed his jaw, drew Harry closer—which was the moment Harry straightened his tongue and began to thrust as Malfoy had done to him.
Malfoy holds out an arm as if to say
Malfoy shrugged. He didn’t seem too concerned. So Harry used it, and came out in the t-shirt and boxers he slept in.
A steady stream of customers flowed in and out of the shop after that. Harry slipped into the rhythm of helping people. It turned out he wasn’t particularly good at choosing the right hats for people. However, he seemed to have a knack for making people smile and for drawing in passersby who had only paused to glance at some of the gaudy hats in the doorway. Also, he apparently had a knack for selling hats, even some of the more outrageous ones.
Harry set a brutal rhythm with both his hips and his hand, pulling Draco off. A frisson of alarm went up his spine as he realized he was on the brink, and this time he wouldn’t be able to hold it off. But then Draco was keening, his body tightening around Harry’s—and for a moment, Harry thought he himself had come because his hand was covered with wet warmth, but no, it wasn’t his own, it was Draco’s, and that realization undid him and then
He rechecks the address and frowns to see that it matches.
Draco and Hermione have some kind of news, and Hermione is bringing Ron and Rose over for it. It must be good news, so Harry isn’t concerned, but this is Ron’s first time over, and Harry realizes this will be the first time Draco has met him since Hogwarts.
“Shit. No. I didn’t mean it like that. That was uncalled for. Sorry.” Heat rose in his face, and he closed his eyes. “That was a mean thing to say. You’ve been nothing but good to Ginny and Luna and me. Thanks for that. Forget I said that thing.”
Harry felt strange, felt especially aware of his body. It was probably the alcohol. Mostly the alcohol. Maybe?
Malfoy stared at him another moment. Then he tapped at the till again, ran the card, and handed it back to Harry. He took a little metal stand with a number 4 attached to the top and handed it to him, as well.
A thrill went through Harry. He tugged—but not hard. He liked the feel of Malfoy trapping him too much.
“…what?”
The tight thread of magic is there, inside of him. It’s bound around his lungs, drawn taut by its connection with Malfoy’s wards. If he had time, Harry would separate the magic carefully from himself so that it continued to support the wards. As it is, he snaps the connection like a string, and the wards go slack.
Harry paused. Ginny snickered into the back of her hand. He glanced between her and Luna. “Wait. Are you taking the piss?”
Potter’s words—
“It’s a manuscript,” Malfoy sneers after a few beats.
lived with Ginny for more than half a decade. And there was no way he’d actually seen Draco Malfoy making bread in a coffee shop window in America.
“Nice hat,” was the first thing he said, looking at Malfoy.
Malfoy gazed back at him, arms crossed. He was streaked with flour again. This didn’t seem to bother him.
“I’ve been wanting to try eating at one. Ron mentioned it.”
And he really doesn’t want to look at what that feeling might mean. Especially when placing it next to the evening they had, the intimate fireside chat, the hands touching over snap cards.
“No. Something else is going on. I can’t— You’re impossible, you know that?” Harry can hear the helplessness in his own voice. Then, not understanding why, he says, “Stay.”
Draco nodded and hummed, made a note of it. He could see Potter from the corner of his eye; he looked distinctly uncomfortable, so Draco didn’t say anything and continued to write, giving him time to spit out whatever else was on his mind.
This time, Malfoy’s derisive snort caught him off guard, and his face heated.
“I still think Hermione should have scheduled them over the course of the month,” Draco says.
His heart was full. It was good to feel connected to her again. He loved her, though he wasn’t in love with her anymore, and the feeling of that made him so happy. Ginny grinned at him, and he got the sense that she felt the same way.
“You— Just— Everything feels so good with you.”
Harry feels his face heat at that statement, as if it meant, or should mean, something else. As if there were some…
He shakes his head. He can’t help a tight smile. It takes him a minute to find his wand on a shelf of cans. He pulls the golden tendrils from his temple and directs them into the square mirror. The words form.
Another sniff.
“Calm down.”
“This?”
Ron was giving him that shrewd look again, frowning slightly in thought. “Does he still have that coffee shop?”
“Okay.”
. His lips pressed together. His hand closed around the broom.
They entered a new area, and for an instant, Harry thought they’d walked into Wizard Space—here in full view of Muggles. His mouth opened to say something, but he realized that this was physical space and the building truly was bigger than it looked. The smallness of the coffee shop was an illusion. The back was easily two or three times the size of the front, filled with machines and sacks of coffee beans and flour and sugar. The smell changed back here, took on a stronger aroma of coffee beans and yeast.
Her expression shutters. He can feel the way she looks at him, eyes dark and wary. “All right.”
“It seems like you had a good time,” Hermione said.
The Patronus dissipated in a shower of silver sparks as Harry descended. “Harry,” Luna said. “Thank you for coming.”
“Chicken casserole,” Harry said, not looking at Malfoy, marching to the kitchen counter to deposit the dish in its stasis charm. “I forget to eat when I’m under stress, so I thought—” He shrugged. He didn’t add that he tended to cook when he was stressed about other people. Malfoy was probably worried enough on his own without Harry’s helping on top of it.
. You’d burn your hand if you stuck it inside. Biology is amazing, isn’t it?”
Harry looked around the dim sitting room. He’d stoked the fire in the hearth, but its light was swallowed by the ever-present shadows. “I guess. Yeah.”
It occurs to him towards the end of the second day that he has no idea what he’s actually looking for, no idea what kinds of riots Malfoy is supposedly conspiring to incite. When the thought does come to him, he straightens up from the descrying bowl to search the scatter of papers on his desk for the case notes.
“Are you interested in visiting him?” Luna asked. “We didn’t think you’d want to see him.”
Harry had the feeling of being squeezed, of all the air pressing out of his lungs. He swallowed tightly. Lowered the page.
“Just. Wow.”
Malfoy’s eyes widened. “You didn’t. You did not lie to Luna.”
A man who looked like he could have been a uni student leaned over the counter to ask a question of one of the goblins. The goblin glanced at the piece of paper the man slid toward him, nodded, and spun in his swivel chair to pull a leather tome from a shelf behind him.
Malfoy snapped his mouth shut, squeezed his eyes to slits and spoke again.
Malfoy smirks again. It occurs to Harry that Malfoy’s glass is nearly empty.
Then Malfoy narrowed his tongue to a point and began to tongue-fuck him in earnest.
“Oh?”
The images were still there at the surface of Harry’s mind, memories of Draco’s experiences, of him thinking about
in his gut.
“Yeah,” he says, relieved that she understands.
Harry’s fingers grip the soft carpet.
Harry got out of the car and stretched out his spine.
Hermione squeaks. “Oh, goodness me! Ron’s going to kill me. Harry, thanks again for these files. I know I could have got them myself, but this saves me so much time. Draco—” She stops abruptly, as if catching herself, or as if she found herself without a thought of what to say to him.
“Equal match.”
“Here,” she said, and handed him an apron. “Put this on and wash your hands.”
“Are you saying you can postpone the hearing?” Harry asks, feeling like he’s underwater, surrounded by grindylows and trying to see through a storm of bubbles.
Molly had assured him that he would settle in, but that had been a week ago, after they’d just finished the renovations. He hadn’t said anything to Hermione about it because he knew her answer:
, and frowned.
Well, he could hardly complain about not having enough time to see them when he was standing around doing nothing at work. He sat down and pulled a pile of papers towards him, determined to finish early enough that he could swing by Ron and Hermione’s after leaving the office.
Hermione was right, after all. Hermione is always right. Harry wears his heart right there on his sleeve for everyone to see. Robards would have recognized in a moment that Harry wasn’t surprised by the news about the hearing.
The barista set a cup down. “Double dirty.” To Malfoy: “Have a good one, Draco!”
She tilted her head. “Are you surprised?”
“Are you going to give Harry the grand tour, Draco?” Luna asked.
Harry doesn’t like St. Mungo’s. The bare tiled floors, the hum of the healers’ chatter broken by the occasional moan or shout, the smell of lemongrass and something sour, something sharp. But at least when he visits these days, he knows he’ll be returning home again in an hour, and he likes his healer, a witch in her early fifties who treats him kindly, exactly as he suspects she treats her other patients—like they are all as important as the Savior of the Wizarding World, and like they are all human.
Hills, the canny old man, gives Harry an assessing look from under hooded lids. Bate looks like he’s brewing up an explosion. Just when it seems like he’s about to go off, Hills says, “Putting in overtime. None of my business,” and glances at Malfoy. “We’ll start our search in the pantry, if you have one?”
“Sure,” Harry said. “I’ll believe it when I see it.”
“Not a miracle,” she warned him earlier, during her last visit in his room. “This could have ended poorly. You were lucky your friend found you quickly and that we’ve already treated you for this.”
“You’re back.”
“What?” Harry said, prickling. “Offering to give a practical demonstration?”
Sirius’s chest of letters sat inside, where Harry had left it. He hesitated a moment before pulling it out.
He used his last piece of bread to scrape up the remaining soup in his bowl. Across from him, Malfoy rinsed his own bowl in the sink and loaded it into the dishwasher. This action struck Harry as odd—though it shouldn’t have, considering Harry had watched Malfoy using Muggle machines all afternoon.
Harry veered just in time not to crash. He tumbled to the grass. It crackled beneath him, and smelled sweet and like baked earth. The ground was still warm from the day, and Harry might have lain there for a minute, except the broom handle pressed hard into his side.
“You were just going to drop it in another fit of pique,” Malfoy snaps, when Harry’s gaze follows his movements.
“It most certainly is,” Malfoy said, and reached forward to pluck both glasses from Harry’s hands. (His own glass was empty now, Harry noticed.) He set each glass into its spot on the block and then picked up the next. “Here. A hefeweizen. Something you’d be more used to.”
. How had Harry not known? But what about Tonks? And Teddy. Merlin.
into cases without knowing all of the facts. Hermione calls this
“There you are,” Malfoy breathed, and pushed his finger back in. Slowly, until Harry’s body got used to the intrusion and began to open up around it.
Malfoy standing trial.
Harry cracked his hand away from his eyes. Still bright. He gave it another moment and then tenderly peeled his hands away. The kitchen was alive with light, every lamp turned on. He glanced behind him. The front of the shop was dark, barely visible, illuminated only by the light of a street lamp beyond the front door.
Draco closed his eyes. No. Absolutely not. Draco was not a teenager anymore. He would not let Potter appeal to his senses of
“So you really do work for Gnosis University, then. You’re faculty.”
Harry looks up with a scowl, in no little part because Malfoy sounds half sincere with his offer and because yeah, it would help.
“I’m fine. Malfoy. I’m fine.” Harry grips Malfoy’s arm, the one still clutched to Harry’s own shoulder. “Merlin. Fuck.”
Harry chuckled and slung an arm around Draco’s shoulders, pulled him in for a kiss. There was a moment of resistance—bony shoulders stiffening—and then Draco relaxed against him.
Harry laughs. “What, Malfoy, were you imagining games of…of strip snap in the Gryffindor common room? Frequent fantasy of yours, was it?”
To Draco’s surprise and dismay, Potter laughed. Draco looked on in silent shock as Potter’s shoulders shook. Eventually, Potter said, “You are an arsehole, Malfoy. But sometimes you’re kind of all right.”
“Pollution in the Ministry” reads the headline. He knew to expect it, but that doesn’t stop a cold sweat from prickling his neck.
His heart gallops, and for an instant, he fears his lungs will constrict. But they don’t. He runs a shaky hand through his hair, feeling like an idiot.
Malfoy looks as if he is about to say something Harry won’t like, but instead, he says, “Malfoy Manor, if you must know.”
“Get a grip,” he muttered to himself.
“I’ll gladly take it off your hands,” Malfoy drawled.
“Fine weather we’re having,” he said, which was his standard greeting, rain or shine, but Draco looked dubiously at the overcast sky anyway, and Edward laughed. “Heard me coming up the road, did you?”
— Bill
He tried to catch sight of Malfoy at his station by the window, but he couldn’t see around the tall case of baked goods in the way, so he took his usual seat in the corner. From there, he could see Malfoy’s back. It was hard to tell from the distance, but it seemed like Malfoy was moving more slowly than usual, without the same finesse.
Harry had already forgotten which flavor Malfoy had got, and was pleasantly surprised by the taste of crisp, tart apple and creamy cheese. “Oh, wow.”
“I’ll escort you,” Harry says.
Then past-Malfoy and Hermione are leaving Harry in the sitting room to look through Malfoy’s research.
“I mean, I think he might have been trying to tell us something.”
It could have been anyone, of course. He was across the street, and years separated Harry from the blond boy he remembered. But there was something about the way the man moved, the narrowness of his chin, that particular expression of concentration.
It wasn’t a moment before Chesterfield and Williams were there, shouting warnings to Malfoy, putting an arm around Harry’s shoulders.
“Um. You’ve got a lot of Muggle things? Non-magical things. Is that what I’m supposed to notice? I’m not very good at this game.”
Instead of replying, Malfoy leaned forward and claimed his mouth. It was a hard, hot kiss.
read and he does know what research is, thank you very much. Of course, he only knows what an abstract is thanks to Hermione. He doesn’t mention any of this to Malfoy.
Luna’s smile widened. “Of course.” She squeezed his fingers. “The room is still made up for you.”
Draco squeezed the bridge of his nose. Correction: Harry Potter’s entire
“I might, but I’d have a better idea if I knew what ‘something’ they said.”
“Hey, Malfoy.”
“No.”
An alarming frisson of pleasure shot through him. He gasped. “Shit. I’m gonna come.” He lifted his hand to touch his cock, then remembered himself and flung it back down.
Malfoy’s gaze meets his and then cuts away. “They’d done all they could and were just using me as a test puff at that point.”
Chinese food in Oregon?” Ron asked as they set out their meal.
He showed Harry the charms he’d created to measure and mix the ingredients: flour, water, salt, oil. Harry resisted rolling his eyes at Malfoy’s pretentiousness, but couldn’t help the flutter of excitement he felt as the ingredients gathered and weighed themselves and began to mix midair as they lowered into the bowls.
Malfoy inclines his head. “Aurors.”
“Is that not okay?”
The expression sharpens. “What?”
Parkinson sniffed. “You’re never going to meet anyone if you’re always making coffee.”
“Good,” he said, as the milk hissed in the pitcher. His fingers were warm against Harry’s.
“Shut up, Malfoy. Maybe you should worry about protecting the books from me.”
Malfoy crouches next to him, and Harry meets his eyes. He wants to ask—something. But his mouth falls open and nothing comes out.
“Told you!” Ron said with a cheerful twirl of his fork.
The press jumps at that, asking so many questions it’s hard to distinguish their voices. Harry raises an impatient hand.
“What did you order?”
“But I call dibs for the coffee shop,” Malfoy said.
Malfoy didn’t seem to require a response, which was good because none was forthcoming. He dusted his hands and went to the telescope. “Here.”
“I have every faith in you. However, here are the written directions.”
Oh, my god. Are you really— Are we really—”
“Are you drunk?” Harry giggled. (
“What— Malfoy, what century are you even from?”
“It’s still breakfast,” Malfoy said in slow, clear tones. “We only serve breakfast sandwiches.”
what you were searching for?” he asks, raising a negligent hand. “I say, it’s a bit gauche to be calling Auror Potter a
His fingers had still been sore when he woke, peppered with angry red marks from repeatedly jabbing himself with a needle the day before. He’d been too embarrassed to ask Luna to cast a Healing Charm on them, so he cast some of the field spells he’d learned as an Auror. After ten minutes, his fingers were a little better (and only slightly stained turquoise), but he was definitely not up for another adventure yet.
Draco needed more toast.
He went with the foot traffic past a security checkpoint and through a series of doors that allowed him to pass through before swinging themselves shut behind him. And maybe it was just the surreal feeling he got from travel in general, but he felt like he was perhaps still in the wizarding section of the airport.
“Yeah.”
Malfoy glanced at the clock. Harry was surprised to see that it was approaching opening time.
“Merlin. Malfoy. You’re mad.” Harry rubbed tears of mirth from his eyes.
Harry sits at the kitchen table while the kettle heats and the tea leaves levitate into the pot. Ginger biscuits plate themselves on the table in front of him. Harry lets the familiarity and comfort sink in. He has another flashback to Malfoy’s home, and he shakes his head.
“Oh, come off it, Malfoy. We can either do this here or we can do it at the Ministry.”
“I mean. Yeah. It did.” The truth was, it had passed his mind many times over the years, but his thoughts always stopped with
“How’s it going with the house?” Ron asked between bites of chicken.
, which was replaced by something blunt and hot pushing against his entrance.
Malfoy scowled. “No, you didn’t.” He thunked his box down and leaned in to say something to the short-haired man who was slicing open a croissant roll.
“Your home is beautiful,” Hermione says in a cool tone, hands folded on her lap. Only Harry can see that her fingers are clutched tight.
Three days after he turned 30, Harry Potter resigned from the Aurors.
Until that moment, he’d been operating on autopilot, with the vague expectation that he would succeed Robards one day. But the expectation had never been his, had it? It had been everyone else’s.
“No real use for it anymore, is there? Especially if I sell it.”
“Always takes a few minutes to work its way up,” Parkinson said. “Should be any minute now. Here we go.” A stream of smoke trickled from her mouth. She smiled, and the smoke curled around her lips.
Harry was fairly certain Malfoy had originally planned to work the rest of the week; he’d mentioned it previously. Harry felt as if there was something else going on here, some deeper current.
Harry eyed it. Frigid air wafted out. “Should I be impressed?”
“I’m glad I can come in useful.” Malfoy’s voice, dripping irony.
Harry blinked. He turned to look at Malfoy.
Malfoy turned. His gaze met Harry’s. The expression on his face remained blank. “Potter.”
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. “What? Going to catch up on a decade of history?”
“I think Luna’s out back,” Ginny said, slamming her own door shut. “Do you want to go down and say hi? I’ll get your bag.”
Harry liked watching it pass, so he couldn’t disagree.
“All right,” Potter said, when Draco had finished summarizing the document.
“Hmm. Far too present. You’re like a thorn. Well, I must have read that in the
Harry shook his head gravely.
Robards gives him a piercing look.
Malfoy snorts. “Fucking Gryffindors.” But his smile quickly drops from his face. He looks uncertain.
“Yeah. It’s great,” he said, feeling a flush of guilt. He pushed his hands into his pockets. “What’s going on with your tree?” The black leaves did not look good.
Potter stood at his elbow, looking faintly amused.
“No,” he tells himself.
Here is some English for your Ministry to consider: take your piece of parchment and fuck off. This is harassment.”
Harry kicked off after him. He took one glance around for the Snitch and then abandoned the search to climb, drawn toward the sky. The wind roared in his ears. The lights bobbed out of his way.
She holds his gaze with blue-grey eyes. It reminds him of Malfoy. “Haven’t we all?”
look very nice in the late afternoon sun. Harry guessed it was late afternoon. Maybe it was evening. They’d been at the brewpub for quite some time. Long enough for Harry to have a hard cider after his last beer. Ginny said it was pear? It had tasted pretty sweet. Sweet and crisp and good. He’d told them that while licking the sticky remnants from his lips. Malfoy had frowned then, too, looking at his mouth. Like Harry wasn’t allowed to lick his mouth. Harry would lick his own mouth, thank you very much. He’d lick Malfoy’s mouth, too, to make a point, if Malfoy had told him to use a napkin. But Malfoy hadn’t. Harry had been disappointed about that.
“No. Merlin. Just. It’s not supposed to be this good.”
It wasn’t well-known information that Harry had become one of the most skilled legilimens in the Ministry. Certainly Malfoy wouldn’t know. But the look in Malfoy’s eyes suggested he wasn’t guessing.
“Deep breath in—hold it—good…and: cast!”
“You really like books,” Harry said, as the realization came to him. “Like a proper— Like a proper book-lover.”
Malfoy’s tone was almost playful. Harry forced an even breath. “What kind of hat are you looking for?”
Harry sighs again. “You got me, Malfoy. I can’t sneak anything past you.”
“Oh. That’s nice. You can tell him I said thanks, but I think selling hats isn’t for me.”
High spots of pink appear on Malfoy’s cheeks. “Let me see if I can get this straight. You’re suggesting I use legilimency on you.”
“I wouldn’t expect it to. It’s a non-magical establishment. Though you never know these days. They’re doing clever things with screens and waves.”
“What?” Harry says, mouth inexplicably dry.
He froze, one hand against the wall for balance. He didn’t have to apply a
Harry got onto the bed. What was he doing? He nearly laughed. But the mattress was so incredibly soft, it nearly swallowed him. He was sinking and sinking and sinking. And Malfoy was kneeling on the edge of it—now climbing onto it—looming over him.
“The buck,” Ginny said, indicating a buff goat a hundred feet off with long curving horns. Harry looked at the dented building and gave a low whistle when he realized what Ginny meant.
He furrowed his brow and unlatched the window. There was another screech—this one closer—and a large tawny form burst in with a rush of cold air.
Luna followed his gaze. “It’s looking a lot better, isn’t it?”
He caught himself rising to go to the Floo. He didn’t know why, though he had the vague impression of a sly smile, a mocking glance. The same sense had been haunting him since he’d returned, especially since renovations had been over. Even before then, though, even in the company of Ron and Bill and Hermione and Molly, he’d still had a vague feeling of something missing, of their company not being enough.
“I’m gay, Molly. Not questioning. I’ve known for a long time,” he said firmly.
“Because I what?” he asked before he could stop himself.
“So, the spell didn’t work,” Harry said.
Harry smiled, but he knew it didn’t reach his eyes. As much as he loved the idea of spending another few minutes with Draco, short as they might be, he was running out of willpower to force himself to go to work. “Sure, I can do that.”
“Hence the name,” Draco replied with the corners of his lips quirking up.
“Yeah. Draco just asked if I could meet up with him, do you mind if I—”
Harry leaned forward, draping himself over his boyfriend’s back, kissing along his exposed upper back, before whispering in his ear. “Touch yourself.”
Harry yelps as a white-hot sensation burns a line down his thigh. He looks up to see a soft red glow coming out of the tip of Draco’s wand. Oh god. They’ve used this spell before. It’s always intense, but never as much as today, the potion continuing to amplify every single sensation.
“Draco—” Harry snapped his head up, unable to take anymore. He could feel his body reacting… except it wasn’t his body, and that was the problem. He knew Draco liked to get him riled up, that it was just a game to him. But this felt different, more charged.
“Mel’s going to be okay, though?” he asked, his voice a little rough.
“Mel, go home.”
He froze as he looked to the back of the large cage. Where he’d expected to see another large magical creature, sat a dozen people huddled in the far corner. Several of the adults kept their arms wrapped tightly around children who had looks of terror on their faces.
Harry reined in his frustration and ran a hand through his messy hair. They’d had their interview with Ernest Foxley scheduled for early that morning. When he hadn’t shown up, they sent out a team to go find him and bring him in, but Harry had assumed he’d just forgotten or mixed up the time. He was a weak lead, at best. And nothing about him had suggested that he was involved and certainly not that he’d be a flight risk.
“I’ll let Draco know you’re here,” she said with a knowing look.
“Sorry?” Harry asked. “How can you be sure?”
“Okay, deal.” Draco trailed kisses down the side of Harry’s neck. “And what do I get if you lose?”
“What’s tradition?” he asked.
He feels the pressure at the back of his throat and fights back the initial gag. A few more tears gather in the corners of his eyes as he swallows Draco down. The first thrust is always the worst. So, Harry works on relaxing his throat, taking him all the way in.
*          *          *
“Absolutely,” Harry replied, grinning.
Harry walked a little faster, not really knowing where he was going or what exactly he was looking for. He tried to lose himself in the movement, in the rhythmic footfalls on the pavement. When he was still a teenager, his dream involved a wife and children, a happy house with lots of life. His eyes prickled. He didn’t really have any of it. He had the job. The job that he never seemed to be able to leave at work, even when it wasn’t actively following him home with a vendetta. But the rest of it… He tried to remind himself that he had Ron and Hermione, Rose and Hugo, the Weasleys… Draco…
She laughed. “Okay fair, but you know what I mean. I know that’s what’s holding you back from dating, even a Muggle.”
He climbed into bed, scooting to the far side and tucking his wand under his pillow. The bed was clearly not a single, but it was as small of a double as Harry had ever seen. It would be a tight fit. Harry’s face flushed at the thought, and he was caught somewhere between thrilled and terrified at the idea. It had been so long since he’d even kissed another person, a few minutes ago notwithstanding. He reminded himself that nothing would happen and tried to settle down, hoping that his body got the message as well.
“That not—” Harry started. Then it dawned on him. “You’re doing this, aren’t you?”
“Okay, that’s it for the day. Let’s clean up,” Harry said, as he checked his watch. His trainees breathed a collective sigh of relief, several of them helping their duelling partners off the practice mats. “Practice your area and distance shields, and I’ll see you on Monday.”
He’d been on his own for so long that he had forgotten what it was like to have someone around—someone who might know he was having a bad week or might be hungry. Not since Ginny. He’d really only had Ginny and his time at Hogwarts, with Ron and Hermione as a steady presence in his life.
“Harry, here’s some for you.” Teddy gathered far too many presents in his arms, walking over to Harry before dropping them in a pile at his feet.
“Sure—erm, just anything is fine,” Harry replied.
Harry found himself increasingly flustered by the opposing Seeker, Kevin, the brother of Ginny’s captain.
He burst out laughing. “What?”
Narcissa pursed her lips together, taking a moment before replying. “We’re not in contact.”
“Santa came!”
, surely leaving fingerprints behind. Harry had been kind enough to lend him his glasses for the day since he certainly didn’t need them at the moment.
“No. Sorry—I just always assumed at Hogwarts…” Draco looked genuinely surprised at the new information.
“The annual Weasley Christmas jumper,” Harry said, pulling his out a bit so Teddy could see.
“How could you not after this?” Draco asked incredulously, his eyes wide. “You almost died, and it seems like that’s not an uncommon occurrence, which is pretty fucking disturbing, actually.”
Hagrid turned before leaving. “Hey Malfoy, you still need those occamy eggs? I think I’ve found yeh a better supplier.”
“Gave my notice this morning. Well, actually,” Harry said as he thought through the conversation, “I just kind of quit. I didn’t really give an end date.”
Before the spell could be completed, Harry ducked, using his wand to push over the table as the unforgivable hurled his way. The moment he felt it hit the heavy table, he jumped up, casting a wordless
“Mate, I need to call this in. We need to get you to Mungo’s.” Ron stood up and started casting spells around the area, which Harry immediately recognised as spells that would keep wix and Muggles alike out of the newly active crime scene.
Draco shifts and then the tingle of a cleaning spell rushes over Harry and a slick finger presses at his entrance. Harry drops his head back, breaking the kiss, as Draco teases the nerve endings, running his fingers in circles over Harry’s sensitive rim.
“Come on, let’s go have an unreasonable amount of drinks for a Monday night and live to regret it terribly in the morning,” Malfoy said with a smile, and Harry let out a laugh, feeling lighter than he had in a long time.
“Oh my god. You are the absolute worst.” Harry rolled his eyes but couldn’t stop a smile from forming on his face. “We’re not just friends.”
“Yeah. I cast them before we got there. Every protection spell I knew, actually, since we were going in solo,” Harry replied, his stomach twisting uncomfortably.
“Australia,” the boy corrected, his expression unimpressed.
He barely has time to enjoy the feeling coursing through his body before he’s once again bucking away from the hand he was chasing after just a moment ago. The overstimulation is so much. What was pleasurable only seconds earlier now feels like pure torture, and he lets out a dry sob as he pistons his hips to the side.
“Great! I’ve managed to get an Alihotsy tree for my N.E.W.T. students,” Neville said, face lighting up. He then went into a long explanation of the lessons he had planned for that class, and Harry listened intently, glad not to be asked to rehash his disastrous day.
“It was—” Harry inhaled sharply. “It was so terrible, Draco.”
“Did you not count?”
“You’re right,” Malfoy said, eventually.
Exhausted, he finally collapsed on a nearby bench and dropped his head into his hands, fighting back the tears. After all this, the only person he wanted to talk to was Draco. He could tell himself it was just friendship, a close friendship—that it was enough. But Harry knew exactly what his feelings had grown into, for better or worse.
“Oh my god. Okay. Where are you?”
“Too often,” Harry replied with a sigh.
Draco caught his eye and raised an eyebrow in a question.
“Well, I know just the thing for such an event.”
Hour after hour the previous night, he had lain awake replaying his behaviour and then dying of embarrassment in the privacy of his own bed. His mind had been relentless, just playing every awkward moment over and over again.
Queen of Spades.
Harry froze, the bowl of stuffing still in hand. Draco also went still.
The idea of having to hear any of those sentiments from people in the wizarding community was too much. And that any of those thoughts could come from someone he cared about was terrifying. Mrs Weasley always made it very clear how much she wanted Harry to find a nice young witch, settle down, and have a family of his own.
Harry was starting to wonder if he should just give up the whole teaching thing—finish out the year and find a new profession. What profession, he didn’t know. The Aurors had brought up too many of his issues from the war, and he’d quit during training. Both charity work and Quidditch required engaging with the press, something that had quickly proved impossible for him. He wondered if he should just become a hermit; was that a possible career path? He could just hole up in Grimmauld and yell at the press when he went out in public. Might as well lean into the crazy rumours, right?
Harry had attempted pairing off his second-year students to work with each other as Malfoy had suggested, but it was still too chaotic. They were flying into each other and not paying attention to the lesson. The lesson had ended with him yelling at the whole class and taking away points from both houses—not the way he was hoping the lesson would go.
“Erm—what do you mean?”
Harry jumped up and turned to leave, nearly knocking over his stool in the process.
“Oh,” she said quietly.
“Good.” Harry pulled himself up, tucking himself back in and zipping up his jeans. He offered a hand to Draco, who smiled at him and kicked off his heels before standing up.
Draco released him. Harry pistoned his hips almost immediately, and Draco gagged as his cock hit the back of his throat roughly, but he forced himself to relax and let Harry fuck his throat.
“For fuck’s sake, Harry,” Draco panted out. “Just touch me.”
“What was that?” Harry asks, before gently biting on the hardened nub.
Narcissa looked at Draco, who nodded his head encouragingly. She turned towards Potter again, her eyes still brimmed with tears. “Yes, that would be good, I think.”
Draco wasn’t used to being called mate, and apparently, Potter wasn’t used to it either, because he turned towards Ron and asked, “Mate?”
Draco turned and took a grip at Harry’s collar of his healer robe, pushing him up against the other side of the corridor. “Where is she? Harry, he sent her away, I didn’t know!” Draco said desperately, gently shaking Harry as to not hurt him.
She continued squirming and cast glances at Lucius, who continued eating without saying a word.
“Don’t be silly. Of course I will. I’ve slept in worse places than this.”
“I’ll try.” Draco knew his father would tell him sooner or later. If it was something bad he probably had a hand in it somewhere.
“Because your parents thought it was a good name,” Harry said through gritted teeth. He took a breath and then mumbled a very quiet
He was deep in numbers when he heard the elevator ping. Without looking up, he called out, “Mr Shacklebolt isn’t here. You’ll have to wait until tomorrow.”
The rest of the day, Draco buried himself in work, ignoring Dora’s attempts to talk to him. It’d been a long time since Draco had felt this humiliated. He skipped lunch and was desperately trying to come up with a believable excuse to miss out on the ball that evening.
“But what about Ron, what does he say?” Harry asked, feeling something like foolish hope taking place in his body.
your back,” Harry muttered petulantly, glancing over to Hermione, who still was standing breathing a little faster after being startled by Malfoy. “What were you doing up anyway?” Harry asked her.
changed, he couldn’t help to feel that he really wanted Potter to acknowledge that. It was silly, really, that he still wanted Potter’s friendship even twenty years down the line.
Draco cleared his throat. ”I’m sorry about Blaise. He’s such a flirt, and boundaries aren't his strong suit. I apologize if he made you feel uncomfortable.
Draco shook his head. “You know he isn’t.”
“You’re so fucking gorgeous, Harry.” He licked down his perineum and back up again. I could do this forev…” he swallowed his last word. “For hours. I could do this for hours.”
“Get your hands off me! What are you doing, Potter?” Draco pushed him away, and sat up. The look of hurt on Potter’s face made Draco squirm. Something was definitely not right.
“Okay, let’s take the Floo then,” Harry said, steering Draco away from the bar. Draco didn’t know if he was able to handle the Floo better, but when he heard Harry speak his address out loud he clung onto him for dear life.
Harry continued reading with Scorpius leaning against him, and Draco had to once again look away from them, only to see Andromeda’s warm smile directed at him. Draco excused himself and went into the kitchen, he needed a moment to compose himself.
Ron boxed him lightly on the arm. “I just thought that you could be friends, you know? You’re not that different from each other, I think you could get along”. He drank the remains of his beer and put down the glass on the counter while he stood up. “I need to get back home. It’s not every night you have a child free night with the missus, you know.” He wiggled his eyebrows and punched Draco playfully on his chest. “But seriously, give Harry a chance. He likes you.”
Harry chuckled, “Were you sleeping?”
“You keep telling yourself that.” Pansy smiled, a bit softer this time. “I need to go, Ginny wants a nightcap.” Pansy winked at Draco. “Sleep tight, darling.” She blew him a kiss and ended the call.
“I’m fast Potter. And what kind of a wizard would I be if I couldn’t cast a decent silencing charm?”
“Finally!” Seamus shouted over the music. “Thought you’d never get it.”
Draco took a step closer, his whole body leaning against the counter. “My kind? What kind am I, miss? A Malfoy? A concerned son?” Draco could feel how his voice got louder and louder, even though he tried very hard to keep it down. “Someone who wants to see a bloody healer for Merlin’s sake!”
“This kind of spell damage is hard, and the family are the ones who often suffer the most from it. I’m not saying that you’re handling it perfectly, because no one would, but you are a decent son,” he said, squeezing Draco’s hand.
“Eyes.” Harry nodded. “You have eyes.”
Draco was startled, they hadn't talked about it before, and he was not sure what Harry was getting at, it seemed like something more than just curiosity. “What do you mean?”
Dora waited for exactly 30 seconds before she opened her mouth. Draco counted.
“What?” Harry demanded.
“Stop being such a baby, you’re not dead.”
“Better!” Draco said with a sneer, regretting it when he saw Harry’s smile falter a little.
Draco greeted his mother when she came home the next day, and while she drank tea with Scorpius in the parlour, Draco arranged for every one of her belongings to be moved from his parents' chambers into the bedroom beside his.
Harry looked down at his trousers and then at Draco. “They’re called chinos. They’re Muggle.”
Malfoy flipped him off, but there was no venom behind it.
“Unless you don’t want to do it?” Draco asked, scared that he managed to screw this up as well as his previous attempts to get along with Potter.
Draco walked away before Potter had a chance to answer. He clenched his fists hard against his body and tried to put a smile on his face as he walked into Andromeda's back garden. Andromeda was standing by a table, with Scorpius clinging to her for dear life.
Potter exhaled loudly and gave Draco a tiny smile. Scorpius' smile was much wider.
Harry could feel his lip starting to pout. “You’re no fun,” he muttered. He took his newly ordered beer and drank half of it in one long gulp, and then put the pint glass down on the bar. Only that he miscalculated where the bar actually was, so the glass ended up on the floor, beer splashing everywhere. Hermione and Pansy left out a little screech, while Malfoy pinched the bridge of his nose, shaking his head.
“No! I demand to talk to your captain to find out what this turbulence nonsense is about. Are we going to crash?”
He accepted the cup from Harry when he was done, and he was staring at it before he raised his eyes to look at Harry instead. “I’m sorry for yelling at you. I’m sorry for pushing you away.”
“I was, um, just heard a noise that’s all. Wanted to check it out,” he mumbled, a bit annoyed he couldn’t come up with anything better.
“Oh, get over yourself Harry! Of course we talk, he’s in all my classes! Besides, we’re both planning to become healers, and we’re going spend a lot of time together if we both pass our N.E.W.Ts, which we will. I don’t see any point holding grudges anymore, do you?” Hermione finished with a sigh.
“Very well, lead the way.”
Draco could feel a flush again. He hated that his pale skin always made it clear as a day when he was blushing. He was about to say yes when Harry shook his head and continued. “No, I didn’t mean it like that. I mean, I think Andie had some eggnog going.”
“Great night, huh?” Ron leaned against Harry.
“Don’t be daft Potter, of course not. I told you, I don’t think it would help you anyway. Now, get off my back. I’m going to sleep in my bed for once.”
“You know what, Potter?” Draco answered, ”I think that I will this time.”
”No, I burn easily. How about Moscow?”
“In your pants?” Hermione asked with a slight raise of her eyebrows.
Harry turned and looked at him. “Draco I’m sorry. I really thought we would have fun. I’m sorry that I ruined our vacation.
“There will be no bones jumping today, Weasley. I wanted him to figure it out for himself. I’ll make sure he gets home, let him sleep this off.”
“Will you go with your mother to the appointment?” He asked.
They landed in an alley, veiled by magic. After they’d transfigured their robes to Muggle clothes, they stepped out to a large boulevard.
Draco looked around the room as he went to his mother and plucked the toy out of her hands. Scorpius didn’t care much for darkness, and the tiny stars that Draco had spelled on his ceiling gave the room a soft glow, as did the light from the windows, the sky not quite darkening in the nights of late May. He gently put an arm around his mother and steered her out of Scorpius’ room.
Draco chuckled. “Eager are we?”
They sat in silence for a while, Narcissa still crying, and both Draco and Andromeda holding on to her for dear life. When the silence had stretched out for too long, Draco cleared his throat, “Potter, could I get a word alone?”
The worst thing was that his father had a point. He hadn’t noticed, but that didn’t mean it didn’t matter. “No! You have no right to do this without consulting me. You’ve fought her in every way possible since we came from the healer. You’ve done everything opposite from what they’ve told us. You haven’t helped her at all,” Draco said, knuckles whitening from how hard he was grasping his chair in front of him.
“It’s a book with inspiring quotes and thoughts about the human mind,” Potter said, cheeks reddening a little.
Draco winced at the words, but he knew that he brought this on himself so he nodded in response. “What’s in the boxes then?” he asked.
“What?!” Harry said with a high pitch voiced that was far from dignified.
“Well, yes. But I offered. It’s good to move around a bit.” Potter swallowed, and then paid for his drinks that the bartender had put before him.
Draco sat by the fireplace, staring into the empty flames. By choice, he told himself. By choice.
“No need to be crude!” Draco said as he discreetly shoved Blaise off him, without trying to make a scene. “That ship has sailed a long time ago.”
Harry’s hand hovered over the button for the elevator. “Going down?” He asked Draco with a smirk.
Draco shook his head. “I don’t know about that. I’ll figure something out,” he said, ignoring the feeling that he had absolutely no hope to figure something out at the moment. He took the new drink in front of him and clinked it against Ron’s pint glass. “Besides, now you can tell Potter that I will spend more time at Andromedas’ again.” He raised the glass and downed it in one go, making the whiskey burn all the way down his throat.
“See, I knew this was a brilliant idea,” Harry said, while entering their room. “We’re still both very much alive and well after a whole day together.”
”You threw your shirt at me,” Harry said, holding up his hands in a gesture of shielding himself, like Draco would punch him. Which Draco did, hard on Harry’s forearm.
“You called me Draco.”
“Hermione knows?”
”Do I what?” Draco asked, curious.
“I’ve thought about this.” Harry whispered in his ear. “Thought about you, bending me over your desk. Your precious papers flying everywhere.”
Draco nodded.
“Mother?” Draco carefully stepped into the room.
“She has never forgotten her journal before. She writes in it everyday,” Draco said, almost daring his father to contradict him.
Harry covered his face with his hands. “You’re insufferable!”
“You don’t have to prep me,” Harry grunted out. “Please, just fuck me!”
Draco was sitting at his desk looking over some papers Shacklebolt had left him. He was deep in his reading when the door to the office was slammed open, and a furious Harry Potter stormed out. He was halfway through the room when Shacklebolt appeared in his doorway.
Living with your parents at the age of 31 was a bit of a hardship. Living with your parents when they never left the premises was harder. There were only so many hours of the day one could drink tea with one’s mother or listen to one’s father who still argued about the same old stuff that Draco had turned his back on many years ago. They had both been sentenced to house arrest for life after the war. Draco still couldn’t understand why his father wasn’t sent to Azkaban, but he was somewhat grateful that his mother had some company at the Manor other than the elves. They had a right to file for commutation every five years, his mother was released on probation due to good behaviour and cooperation after her first petition, his father was declined every time. So his mother did the solitary thing and stayed at home with him.
She didn’t understand. Not everyone needed a partner and kids to feel fulfilled.
Malfoy pushes the fringe from his eye with a slender hand. His cheeks are pink. Harry can’t tell if it’s the light of the fire or tipsiness or perhaps that Malfoy is blushing. “More like I expected…more rowdiness from your lot. All right. Truth, then.”
“All right.” Harry smirked and drained his pint.
Someone clears their throat delicately from the kitchen threshold. Harry and Draco spring apart. Hermione stands there, looking contrite and amused. Mostly amused.
“Maybe I just like the coffee.”
“No Wizard Space,” Malfoy agreed.
“What the…”
doing this again.”
“First, I’m going to let that one slide. Are you telling me…?”
“It’s fine, Harry.”
She lets out a little laugh. It isn’t an amused sound. “No. You shouldn’t have. But you were upset, and I know you didn’t mean it like that.”
drink that much. Because drinking brings maudlin thoughts, and those lead nowhere good.
Ginny walked into the kitchen with a basket of fresh lettuce, herbs, and flowers.
“What are you on about?”
he almost says. The words are on his tongue.
“No, you won’t. You go back inside and get dry. I’m sorry for the trouble.”
“Fuck
Harry lets an ugly smile stretch his mouth. “How’s your grasp of the English language doing, Malfoy?”
“God, you make me crazy,” Malfoy whispered. He slid a hand up Harry’s inner thigh, and Harry bent his other knee, steepling the leg, giving Malfoy easier access.
Malfoy gestures at the newspaper atop the stack of books to his side with the hand holding the quill. The blood drains from Harry’s face. He doesn’t know why.
Ron, on the other hand, gave him a shrewd look.
“Self-righteous?”
Harry wouldn’t admit it, but he was nervous as they shut the doors, closing out the sounds of motors and voices, and pulled out into the traffic.
“Welcome to Library Square,” he said.
…And tumbles into the bright morning outside Malfoy’s cottage. What possessed him to begin with this memory, he isn’t sure. As the scene plays out, showing an increasingly agitated (and glittery) past-Harry shouting threats and insults, Harry wants to sink into the floor. Next to him, Malfoy stands stiffly and watches without a word, without a twitch of his expression, and that only makes it worse. At past-Harry’s shout of “dickhead!”, Malfoy raises a cool eyebrow at him. Harry steadfastly ignores it, willing the memory to change soon. It does.
“Yes, it did hurt, but not for long.”
It all comes out in the next half an hour. Malfoy shares that Harry was on his case for weeks and had discovered the truth for himself: that Malfoy, in fact, was behind the squib-producing compound he was attempting to blame on Poesy Potions. The story comes out in the matter-of-fact way of people under veritaserum, the words almost tumbling out of his mouth, but in his clipped, sneering tones. Malfoy wanted to put a stop to muggleborns.
Malfoy continues coolly: “But considering the DMLE had their hand in this, or at least the attempt to discredit me, I’m not actually staying at home. None of my research is there, anyway. They stripped that rather neatly, as you saw.”
didn’t release the article in its Sunday edition as expected.
“Merlin.” He stares at the parchment. “But how come no one knows about this?”
“Ah, thank you, Luna,” Harry said, while Ginny stifled her laughter against the back of her hand.
“Doesn’t mean there isn’t one,” Harry mutters, face warming. “Didn’t know the ones at Hogwarts existed for years.”
“What, Potter? Honestly. They’re in here.” As he spoke, he gave a lazy wave of his wand, and a lamp came on at the other side of the room.
Harry only caught a quick glance of the article, but from what he saw, it looks like at least one of the letters the Ministry sent Malfoy was published alongside the article. On his lunch break, he’ll have to surreptitiously pick a copy up from the newsstand outside the Ministry canteen.
of energy, especially near the end, there.”
“What do you mean?”
“Are you quite done?” Draco murmured, without looking up from the page.
He cast a charm he’d learned as an Auror to repeat words—distinctly and clearly in his ears—as they were spoken. With this, and with the realization that Malfoy was pronouncing some things with a distinct American accent, Harry called the next thing Malfoy asked for: something called “shortening.” Harry cast the Summoning Charm so forcefully, the objects around the tub rattled as it flew from its spot, and it zoomed toward Harry. Harry snatched it from the air and smiled triumphantly at Malfoy.
“Well, that’s because you grew up in a Muggle household.
“They’ve stationed a patrol.”
of us are not dressed for company,” Malfoy said, drawing himself up.
As the water poured over him, he could still feel Malfoy’s grip on his arm—and his magic. The tingle of it mingled with the spray. Even after the shower, dry and in clean clothes and having downed a glass of cold water from the ice box, Harry could still feel Malfoy lingering beneath his skin.
“It’s coffee. Is that not what you ordered?” She glanced at Malfoy and met his eye. They exchanged a complicated series of silent messages and hand gestures, ending with Malfoy making an emphatic jabbing motion with his finger. He met Harry’s gaze and raised his eyebrows in what might have been a challenge. The woman looked at Harry and raised her own eyebrows in question.
“Why didn’t you tell me?”
“You don’t have to. I can imagine it perfectly well. No body, and you
“I’m fine. Really.”
Malfoy, not missing a beat, says, “And what inspired you to take them off for me?”
Harry assumed he would sit next to Luna or Ginny, but they slid together into the booth opposite Malfoy. He hesitated, calculating the amount of space left on the seat next to Ginny.
Harry is on his best behavior this morning. The last five months on desk duty have been excruciating. This will be his first case since the one that landed him in St. Mungo’s, and he’ll do anything to see the outside of these walls during work hours. Even—he grimaces internally—take on the tepid leftovers of a case on Draco sodding Malfoy.
Stepping into their new house.
Postponed. Postponed.
The fields gave way to buildings, and they entered a more densely populated area. They passed shopping plazas and office buildings and signs for petrol stations and restaurants.
For now, Harry was happy to live in this room in Ginny and Luna’s house, where he could step out onto the balcony and go for a fly. He opened the bag and Summoned another from inside of it. It smacked against something else in the recesses of the extended space and then whooshed into view. Harry caught it. In this one, he’d packed just the essentials: shirts, trousers, pants, socks. He unshrank all of the things and placed them in the drawers and on the shelves. When he was done, he sat in the armchair by the iron stove and imagined the warmth it would give off in the winter.
. Himself and Hermione.
“That better not be permanent,” he said, touching the flower.
“We’ll go flying.”
Somewhere after the third, Harry began to have fun. Malfoy, voice drawling, seemed to enjoy modeling and preening. He looked good in almost all of the hats, even some of the truly awful ones, although a couple made Harry burst out in gales of laughter.
.” He shot Harry an aggrieved look.
“Potter!” Robards says.
“Wand polisher.”
The image of Malfoy comes back to him, furious and proud, and he remembers Malfoy’s mocking words.
. As if I’d keep something so—so—
Harry blinked. “Yeah. Sort of.”
“Luna is going to hook you up with job opportunities, is she?”
By the light of morning, Harry wondered if it had all been a dream. The image of Malfoy diving through the night sky, his expression and the lines of his body so hard—but so soft in the rosy golden light—was vivid in his mind but unreal. Then: sitting and drinking beer and watching the stars. Malfoy’s invitation to visit the coast.
“So there you have it,” Malfoy said as they left, and locked the fridge behind them once again. “This has been my life for the last four years.”
A bright bolt of magic shoots out of the dark. Harry has a wordless shield up in an instant, though nearly not in time. The spell glances off his knuckle, and he drops the phone with a clatter.
“Very funny, Malfoy,” he mutters.
Potter gave him a wide-eyed look of incredulity.
Harry hated him immediately.
“Sir, we understand that there’s been some question about Mr. Malfoy’s testimony and the veracity of Auror Potter’s memories. We’re here to offer
Harry got back by laughing at her when she nearly pushed her face into a spider’s web. They both ate nearly as many berries as they picked. And they were silent for a while, the same kind of companionable silence that had been between them in the car. Harry soaked in the sweet astringent smell of the blackberries and relished the feel of the sun and the shade. They mounted their brooms and flew back, and Luna made a compote with some of the berries and herbs from the garden, which they had on ice cream after dinner.
“No.” Harry narrowed his eyes and regarded the trays. He lifted the Stasis Charms from each of them. The trays looked hefty, and the ovens looked hot, so he used a Levitation Charm to lift each and move it into place.
Malfoy accepts the cup. “That doesn’t explain why you collapsed on my floor. You couldn’t breathe, could you?”
you brought up the topic of harassment.”
All of the gazes at the table were now turned to him, and he realized some kind of response was required. “Er.”
“Are you complaining?”
“I’m sure.” She sits. “I’d just as soon never see you again.”
“I obviously—
, Harry James Potter, and we needed you to retain a modicum of plausible deniability. For Draco’s sake, if not yours. The hearing would have been canceled today, and it would have been obvious to anyone looking at you that it wasn’t a surprise.”
Malfoy sniffed, but seemed to relax a fraction. He held the door open for Harry.
And at last: the silhouette of a familiar form against the dying light.
Harry squeezed Draco’s hand. “Probably not,” he agreed.
A warm mouth closed over his. He grinned and pulled Draco in.
The little bell rang brightly when Harry entered the coffee shop.
“All right. Enough.” He clapped his hands.
All good feelings are gone when Harry wakes the next morning. He rolls out of bed well before his alarm and appears at the Ministry before even the coffee stand has opened for the morning. It’s the only way he can prevent himself from calling on Malfoy’s floo at the crack of dawn. As it is, he barely abstains from sending a note by owl. Just an encouraging little message.
She takes a long, unsteady breath. “I think he’s been obliviated. Someone’s erased his records and his memory. As far as anyone is concerned, Draco’s investigation into Poesy Potions never happened. There are only two sources of evidence remaining.”
“Nothing isn’t an option,” Ginny said. “Or is it?”
Harry takes in a deep, slow breath. What the hell? he thinks, and says, “Because you were all self-righteous about your cause, and I was intrigued by that.”
, Potter,” he rasped. “I will need more details than
Malfoy’s breath hitched.
They ended up in the living room, where the fireplace lay dormant for the summer. Harry claimed a squashy armchair that was very comfortable.
“It’s called a backsplash, Harry.” Ginny’s eyes laughed.
She cackled and jammed the button on her door again, and the window slid up. “If you’re going to puke, open your window and point it at the car behind us.”
He looks everything and nothing like the boy Harry remembers. His features are stronger, more squared than pointy. His hair remains the same shocking white blond, though he wears it short. Shorter, even, than Harry’s own. He’s still the same slender bastard he’s always been, but to his dismay, Harry finds himself tilting his head back to glare into the flinty eyes.
“I have a pretty good idea.”
Malfoy lowers their hands to waist level. If he moves his thumb a few centimeters, he’d be able to feel Harry’s pulse jumping in his wrist.
They set off down the street, not holding hands, but close enough that their knuckles brushed, and Harry sensed the phantom of a smile at the edge of Draco’s mouth.
reason for Malfoy having him over for the night. He was in the guest bedroom for Merlin’s sake.
Harry didn’t have time to feel surprise before Malfoy was rifling through Harry’s other memories of him. And this shouldn’t have surprised Harry; Malfoy had always been self-absorbed.
“Quidditch camp today! I need your help. I’ll see you downstairs in ten minutes if you want tea.”
The feel of pressure inside of him persisted, but Malfoy’s bedroom blurred. Harry clung to the feeling of Malfoy’s hand against his thigh.
He let the quiet and stillness of the room settle around him. Someone—he guessed Luna—had decorated the room with a string of colorful ribbons hung across the far corner of the room, fresh flowers and paper birds in a vase, and a painting of vines that curled around the far window. The quilt on the bed was made of old Quidditch uniforms and patches of denim and of floral printed fabric, and it looked like the sort of thing Molly would make.
He’d give it a day. A day for the anxiety of opening the letter to settle. A day to wake up without the weight of existential dread in his gut and have tea and toast like a normal wizard without chasing wayward creatures and old men about the garden, overturning pales of fish fertilizer and upsetting all of the plants. Then, he’d consider his next course of action. Three months. He had enough time.
“Oops,” Williams said with faux innocence, standing over Malfoy’s body, which now lay like a dropped board at his feet. From his place on the floor, Malfoy glared and wailed, his lips locked together by the body bind but still managing to voice his indignation.
Malfoy bristles. “I was not—”
“You really lost your imagination in the Aurors. Or did you never have one?”
Malfoy gives him a long, keen look. In slow tones, he says, “Why the fuck couldn’t you breathe?”
Harry takes quick, shallow breaths. His mind spins to process what Hermione is telling him.
, he could have also said, but his speech centers shut down at the thought. Instead, he lets Malfoy direct him up
His best mate looks haggard, with blueish pouches under his eyes. Harry knows he put them there, and he doesn’t like it. He wishes he could squeeze Ron’s hand back. All he can do is blink at him slowly.
“I don’t know what you mean,” Harry said. “I’m happy to stand here and look at the facade all afternoon. Evening.”
Harry knew he’d made a mistake as soon as he said, “All right, Malfoy. I’d like my clothes back to the way they were, thanks.”
“Been there, done that. And do you really want to be in the same country as my parents?” Draco raised his eyebrows at Harry.
Potter took a step closer, “I can try to make you remember. Please, Draco! Could you please give me a chance to make you remember us?”
Draco scoffed, but he smiled as Andromeda let go of Scorpius and pulled Draco in for a hug instead, just a little too tight for comfort.
“No, wait!” Draco tried, but she’d already disconnected the call.
Draco swallowed. ”Depends on the boy in question.”
“Oh! We’re allowed to sleep? Why didn’t you say so?” Draco closed his eyes, and fell asleep after a couple of minutes.
Draco felt like he took a punch to his gut. His initial response was to lash out and be mad about Potter’s comment, but time had taught him that swallowing his anger and trying to stay in control would benefit him in the long run, so instead, he took a deep breath and thought about Potter’s words before he answered.
“Mr Malfoy is being very rude, Healer Potter. He won’t take no for an answer,” she huffed.
He had a brief thought that maybe he should contact Ron, he owed him that much, but was he able to leave the one thing that gave him time to breathe and hide away from the world?
“I’m selfish, Potter, please let me indulge a little.” He pulled his thumb out, then switched and pushed two fingers inside instead.
“What?” Draco felt almost sober for a second.
“Is something wrong with Narcissa?” Potter asked, more gentle this time.
Harry nodded. “Yes, like you wouldn’t believe.” He reached over and kissed Draco again, softer this time. “This weekend?”
“Sod off!” Draco said, hiding a smile.
There was a knock on his front door. When he opened it he found Harry at his doorstep.
“I’ll see if my parents can look after Scorpius.”
“Will you read, Harry?” Scorpius climbed over Draco to scoot in between them.
“It’s okay!” Harry interrupted. He took his things and went to stand by Draco, reaching out his hand. “We have to go.”
“And yet, you still work here?” Ron asked. There wasn’t any malice in his voice, he looked more curious than mocking.
Draco stared at Harry, trying to make sense of what just happened. He could feel his breath hitch and his mouth opening slightly, not quite believing that the touch was real. Harry seemed to take his silence as something bad so he dropped Draco’s hand.
They went out to explore Barcelona. Harry was like a little child and it wasn’t endearing at all. Only it was. Draco didn’t know how to handle Harry begging him to tell him about every building they passed. About the museums, the history about Sagrada Família, Casa Battló and Casa Milà. Draco wanted to roll his eyes and complain about how little knowledge Harry had, but he couldn’t help but love that he was the one who could teach Harry all he knew about Gaudí. He did roll his eyes, though, and tried to get in a few insults. But it was almost like Harry knew as well they were just for show.
”Fine! I’ll think about it. But, I warn you. This is a recipe for disaster.”
Draco took a step backwards, putting his hand against his chest in mock offense. “You deviant!”
“Now, now, Harry! Don’t be this way, my boy. It’s only a small gathering.”
Draco looked down at his son, smiling a little. “Did you have fun with your grandparents last night? I’m sorry I had to work late on your birthday.” Draco had tried to get away early, but being a Malfoy these days didn’t come with an advantage. If your boss told you to work, you worked.
left. You were gone when I was done with Shacklebolt.” Draco turned in his chair, facing Potter.
Andromeda nodded. “As you wish, darling. Do you want me to keep Scorpius here with me?”
“Screw your grandfather. Don’t listen to him,” Draco said, and then a chill ran down his spine when he heard
“Good luck finding a healer that will care for someone with our last name,” Lucius sneered.
Draco put down his book, and kneeled by the fireplace.
“I’m not sloshed, Draco. I’m a tiny bit tipsy. Point stands. You have beautiful eyes.” Harry tried to poke Malfoy’s eyes to see if they felt equally pretty.
Harry shook his head at the flight attendant who was heading her way and pulled Draco’s arm down. “We haven’t even been in the air for an hour, perhaps you should stick to water from now on.”
“I see you’re in a good mood,” Hermione laughed.
-Harriet Beecher Stowe, Uncle Tom’s cabin
“Can I?” Harry asked.
Potter snorted. “Yes, it seems like it. Fuck!” He shook his head, and left the room.
Michael was funny, in his own sort of way, and not too sore on the eyes. So when they stood waiting for the elevator, Draco didn’t object to Michael pressing him up against the wall beside it. Draco chuckled at Michael’s poor attempt at dirty talk, and tried to get himself in the mood by closing his eyes instead, conjuring fantasies of a different voice whispering in his ear. The elevator pinged, announcing its arrival, and when Draco opened his eyes again he found himself staring right at Potter over Michael’s shoulder. Potter had a frown on his face, and Draco couldn’t help but gently push Michael away from him. All three of them entered the elevator.
“I still think you work too much. I hardly see you anymore.”
Harry looked adoringly confused with ruffled hair and swollen lips. “I was about to come,” Draco gasped out.
Harry turned around to go back when the sensation of magic trickled over him, it felt like a spell ending, like water drops running down all over him, and then it was gone. He stood still, trying to hear descending footsteps or any other sign of someone being here with him, but the tower was empty.
Draco nodded. “Please.”
Harry exhaled loudly, then smiled again. “Good. So you’ll go out with me?”
Harry exhaled slowly before he leaned over and captured Draco’s lips with his. He tasted of firewhiskey, the lingering drops made his mouth scorching hot. Draco traced Harry’s lips with the tip of his tongue, making Harry moan, the sound shooting straight to Draco’s crotch. When Harry opened his mouth a little, Draco took advantage of it, pressing against him harder as their kiss deepened. Draco let go of Harry’s thigh, ignoring his sweaty palms and he took a firm grip at the back of Harry’s head to press him impossibly closer. Harry kissed him with a fierceness he hadn’t felt before, like he was something delicious that needed to be devoured. One of Harry’s hands was now pressing against Draco’s growing erection, and he couldn’t help but huff out a breathy laugh at his own desires becoming apparent.
“Leaving?” he asked in a light voice, but Draco could see that his expression was not as breezy as his tone suggested.
Draco felt torn about the nice words from Ron, and Potter’s hostile feelings towards Draco. He didn’t think it would affect him in this way, feeling lonely and pathetic in a bathroom stall, the small lingering hope that he and Potter could be friends, crushed like dirt under a shoe.
“Oh, Harry!” Ron clapped Harry on the back. “You didn’t know?” Harry shook his head. “Sorry, mate. But you do.”
“Yes,” Harry panted, “You’re not the only one who can do wandless magic.”
“Have you proved yourself enough now?” his father asked.
“What? Why are you asking me that?” Draco asked nonplussed.
“I like you, Draco.” Harry took a step towards him, his arms forward as if trying to calm down a wild animal. “I think you’re fucking brilliant and you and I both know that working with potions is something you’re good at. Why shouldn’t I offer to help you if that’s something I can do? You don’t have to do everything by yourself.”
There was a loud ringing in his ears. He could see Potter’s lips moving, but he couldn’t understand the words he was saying. His mother’s hand was gripping his own tightly, tears slowly making tracks down her cheeks. Beside her, Andromeda looked serious, as she clasped Narcissa’s other hand.
When they closed the door behind them, Draco turned towards Potter, not bothering sitting down. He knew what he wanted to say so it was best to just get it over with.
Potter shook his head. ”No, it’s okay. No need to apologize. Maybe I’m the one who should say sorry, for stealing your boyfriend when you were occupied with Mr. Boring.”
“Not Romania, got it!” Blaise said, winking at Harry.
“I’m her son, and she’s been admitted here without my knowledge.”
“Are we there yet?” Draco said, poking his finger hard into Harry’s arm.
Potter nodded, squeezing Draco’s hips. Draco kissed him again, once, then he took a step back and grabbed the hem of Potter’s T-shirt and pulled it off. He traced his hands over his chest and let one of his fingers sweep over a nipple. Potter gasped and started to work on opening Draco’s buttons on his shirt. He was fumbling, so Draco took pity on him and spelled the shirt open.
“And?” Draco insisted. “And, what?”
“I wouldn’t do that if I were you. They’ve been known to bite officers of the law,” Draco said innocently.
She leaned forward as if to tell Draco a secret. “He’s stealing, you know?” she whispered.
“Oh.” Potter winced. “I’m sorry if my feelings towards you make you uncomfortable. If you want I can transfer your mother to—“
Draco felt his cheek blush as he still stood very close to Potter, and he took a step back making Potter’s hand fall off his shoulder. “I’m not hurt, Potter. I just… they won’t let my mother see a Healer. I lost my temper, it won’t happen again.” Draco looked down.
Draco sighed. “Yes! Just take the sofa as usual. You know where the beddings are.” He gave Harry a little nod and left the room.
When Potter turned away from Draco for the fourth time that night, he excused himself from Luna, who had spotted him at the bar an hour earlier and struck up a conversation with him like nothing bad ever happened, and left for the toilets.
“–and we’ll make sure that you can stay at home as long as possible before it will be too hard to manage,” Potter finished.
Andromeda patted his cheek, “I was only asking if you had plans for tonight? Any of your friends in town to take you out for your birthday?”
Harry slowly peeked out from under the pillow. Malfoy was standing by his bed, holding out a vial for him to drink. He downed its contents and the horrible taste of a hangover potion made him dizzy. He clutched his stomach desperately, wishing that he’d get to keep the potion down.
