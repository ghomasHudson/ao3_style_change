Snape swooped straight to his side, uncorked a vial and shoved it beneath the blond’s nose. One sniff of the familiar scent had Draco downing the contents, relieved at the immediate effect it had on his stomach.
“Not usually, no,” Malfoy admitted easily. “House elves, Potter.”
“Because it’s Potter for Merlin’s sake!” Draco pouted. “God, Pansy…” a small whimper passed his lips. “I just—I can’t take the risk,” he whispered.
he grumbled.
to be anywhere
“Yeah…” Ron said slowly, racking his brain. “You said Neville wasn’t your type and that you preferred blonds.” His eyes suddenly narrowed. “Oh Merlin—
The stone wall slammed shut, a cloud of dust billowing into the room. Draco stared at the bricks in overwhelmed astonishment, the terror that had been building within him suddenly erupting. He walked unsteadily to a grime covered leather couch and collapsed onto it, burying his face into his hands as wracking sob after wracking sob decimated his quivering frame.
Harry thought angrily.
Or so she hoped.
“Downstairs, tinkering away with yet another artefact,” Narcissa replied, her warm smile falling slightly. “The Dark Lord has become rather… impatient.”
Images of Draco lying beautiful, pale, and deliciously naked amongst his sheets flooded Voldemort’s mind. His smirk deepened, envisioning the way he would force the young Malfoy to take him, every inch buried inside his tight—
“Shut up, Potter,” Malfoy interrupted, wriggling his hips again. “I
Lucius shook his head desperately. “There’s no time to explain. You need to go—
“Harry, be careful. The roots are rather tough and you might slip and cut—”
“The sad part is,” Harry suddenly choked, cutting Ron off, “was that I really did begin to have feelings for him.” He shook his head once more, a derisive laugh slipping passed his lips. “But now how do I even know if what I feel for him is
His vision clearing, Harry gazed up at Hermione’s smiling face, surprised at how clear she appeared. The female frowned as she watched Harry’s eyes widen in alarm.
what will you do?”
“Don’t worry about it,” Draco replied. “Come here, Pans, I’ll give you a hand.”
Potter nodded in agreement. “Did you want to keep our newly found whatever-this-is hidden? I really don’t care either way.”
This particular Slytherin did not in fact find snakes all that appealing. When Harry had asked Malfoy if he had a favourite animal, the brunet had been surprised to see a faint blush tinge Malfoy’s cheeks.
Draco snuck another glance towards the counter, unable to stop himself from biting his lip as the brunet flushed slightly at Pansy.
. You knew what I was to him… and you just
Harry thought wryly.
A pair of electric green eyes suddenly shone out of the darkness. They stared at Draco in an exposing manner, as if stripping the blond of his emotional layers.
“How far
“If you had internet at home we could email,” Draco replied.

“Uh huh, yeah,” Harry replied absentmindedly, clutching his invisibility cloak. “See you.”
Stretching across his bed, Harry rolled onto his side, finger gliding across his mouse pad. Instantly his screensaver disappeared and he refreshed his Tumblr dashboard, eyeing the new posts with an easy smile.
Draco swallowed convulsively, his hand trembling as he brought it up to run his fingers through his hair. He drew in a deep breath, closing his eyes as he tried to calm himself. After a few moments, Draco felt his heart settle, his breaths no longer panted. The thirst, which only moments before had been almost uncontrollable, had ebbed to a faint echo.

“Can’t say I’ve found anything of importance. Hey, can you show me that blog site thing later? It looked pretty interesting.”

“… No different to when you were just a lion,” Harry teased.
“Kinda like you’re doing to me?” Harry teased, shutting his laptop down.
Draco thought as his heart rate escalated in speed.
“Do not lie to me!” Draco abruptly snarled. “Even now I can sense your desire. Do not stand before me and tell me
at you.”
“Won’t your parents miss you?”
A faint blush began to creep up Draco’s neck and he all but glared at the silver coffee machine as he flicked the grinder switch, hoping the shrill crunch of grinding coffee beans was enough to drown out his supposed best friend.
“What the fuck do you want, Malfoy?” Harry said irritably, trying to bypass the Slytherin.
It was Friday morning and Harry was sitting at the Gryffindor table gazing thoughtfully across the Great Hall when Ron found him. Following his best mate’s stare, the red-head snorted as he realised the object of Harry’s fascination.
“Woe is you,” Draco snorted, stretching leisurely and placing his laptop aside.
—to feel every inch of Harry.

“The protector of this castle,” the voice hissed.
Ron opened his mouth to fill Harry in about his holiday, when Hermione suddenly interrupted, her eyes narrowed suspiciously.
“You’re
“Oh.”
Charlie winked at him. “And if it doesn’t, no harm done. We’ll simply… have to try again.”
The two young men laughed softly.
you’re frustrating.”
“I promise, Gin,” Potter murmured with a small smile.
“You know,” the blond began slowly. “Your low self-esteem really needs to be adjusted, Potter,” he said. “You seem to lack the concept that you’re actually attractive. And not only that but you happen to be exactly what I am attracted too; it’s only natural to lust after what you find desirable.”
“Where the hell is Blaise when you need him?!”
But—but I’ve always helped you!”
“You think liking Potter is humiliating?” Pansy asked with a frown.
Harry grabbed and opened his textbook,
Questions buzzed and swirled endlessly through his mind and Harry found himself wondering if he should be concerned about Malfoy’s behaviour.
“Not to mention my atrocious memory when it comes to remembering names.”
The blond immediately fell silent, bowing his head once more. “My apologies, my lord. I will go the castle as you request.”
Draco spared her a quick glance as he reached for the platter of sandwiches sitting before them. “Yes,” he replied, his gaze fixed determinedly on the roast beef sandwich in his hand.
The blond laughed mockingly. “Might make me feel better.”

studying with Malfoy,” Hermione replied, shifting a couple of books off of her desk.
“What’s wrong?” Harry asked, turning around from his bed where a very sick Hermione lay curled up.
Swallowing nervously, Harry called out. “Malfoy?”

how was he meant to make amends if he couldn’t catch the bloody idiot to apologise? Thankfully, Pansy had come to his rescue. The two, she and Harry, were still studying together and, although Harry absolutely refused to talk about Draco during study sessions, Pansy had been able to work out a time when Harry would be alone so he could speak with him privately.
There was a moment of silence.
“The charms I found worked then?” Hermione continued, pointedly ignoring Malfoy’s attitude.
wanted to throw a murderous glare in her direction. The vicious fire in his chest was immediately stifled however, when he caught brief eye contact with the brunet standing right behind the bushy-haired female. The male was gazing at him, a hint of shyness softening his masculine features. Swallowing, Draco darted his eyes away as casually as he could make them, his cheeks beginning to burn as he reached out instinctively for one of his cleaning cloths.
The blond turned, the tone of the Dark Lord’s voice setting him on edge. The wicked smile that stretched across Voldemort’s face did nothing to settle his anxiety.
“This is one activity I didn’t foresee when I woke up this morning,” Malfoy said casually as he pulled out his own wand to transfigure his shoes.
“What do
“He’d like that,” Hermione smiled gently. “The only thing I can imagine him doing is being mad at you for not telling him sooner.”
Draco grinned; he was enjoying this conversation. “It’s alright, Potter, I already know I’m pretty.” He cast a sly look beside him, amused at the sight of Potter trying to fight back a blush. “Tell me,” he continued. “What possessed you to ask that question?”
“Excuse me? I don’t think I heard you properly,” Hermione said. “You don’t hate Harry?”
The familiar pool of arousal was almost at breaking point and Harry strained to reach it, imagining as he pushed himself further into Malfoy’s sinful mouth. Nimble fingers would massage Harry’s thighs as he urged Malfoy to slide up and down his shaft, faster and faster and faster…
“What you’re doing? Please tell me what you are then.” Malfoy’s lip curled in disgust. “But don’t let me interrupt you, Theo, please continue with what you were about to say,” he said curtly, flicking his hand impatiently. “I wouldn’t want to stop you from making yourself the largest, bigoted idiot in this entire school.”
Harry stifled a groan and downed a mouthful of his firewhiskey. “I’d rather not,” he replied, keeping his tone as light as he could make it. “Why don’t you tell me about you?”
Draco smiled gently but shook his head. “Thank you, Pansy, but I’ll be alright here. I’ll have the common room all to myself—it’ll be fantastic.”
“Potter, the entire bar noticed.”
Ron’s eyes narrowed. “What do you mean?” he asked suspiciously.
pretty minimal. With that thought held securely in Harry’s wishful mind, he began his way back to his room.
“Mione...”
Rolling her eyes, Pansy smacked Malfoy on the arm. “Don’t mind him, Granger. Draco’s pissy because Potter won’t stop staring at him.”
of your bond. You will feel Draco, Harry, on a level you can’t even begin to comprehend.”
Draco poked moodily at his breakfast as he hid a yawn. Although he openly denied it, Draco had not slept well the previous evening and his temper was a fuse away from breaking. His dreams had been plagued with Potter who had teased him mercilessly as his feelings were discovered. Despite Draco trying desperately to ignore the visions, he’d tossed and turned while he shared a heated debate with himself on whether his feelings were real. The blond honestly loathed the dark haired Gryffindor for making him feel this way; how dare Potter not be what Draco assumed!
Harry shrugged. “Maybe Snape secretly likes me.” Malfoy snorted and Harry chuckled. “Yeah I doubt it,” he said with a grin. “Must be my ‘Potter-Luck’.”
“Yes but what about next week’s homework? And the week after?”
Harry stared.
Hermione sighed. “It’s not that easy, Ronald,” the teapot disagreed. “These things take time.”
Hermione giggled. “More the fact that I wanted you to admit it,” she said honestly. “I’m happy for you, Harry, as long as Draco behaves.”
Harry nodded. “Understood.”
With a determined nod, Harry allowed his fingers free reign over the keys.
“So, going to try and
Eli gaped.
“Regardless if Potter likes me or not,” Draco said to himself. “Nothing good is bound to happen if we act upon our hormones.” He sighed softly.
“I will always love you, Draco Malfoy, and I’m sorry for being so naïve; I want everyone to know about us and to hell with anyone who doesn’t like it.”
“Merlin yes,” he whispered, pressing a warm kiss to the base of Harry’s spine. “I need to taste you, Harry. Please, may I taste you?”
“Alright there, mate?!”
people,” Ron griped.
? This is exactly what I’m trying to avoid!”
He imagined Malfoy on his knees before him, eyes like molten silver as they peered up at Harry. His body lean but beautifully shaped with muscle, fingers long and gentle as they would curl around his hard length. His skin wouldn’t be as rough as Harry’s but soft. His fingers would brush teasingly and Harry would plead for more, begging Malfoy to make him come.
The brunet seemed to mull the question for a moment, before he gave the blond a gentle smile. “Yeah,” he answered.
“I want to show you something,” Harry replied. The doors behind him parted with a creak and he drew Draco further into the darkness. “Keep your eyes closed. It’s a surprise.”
Feeling his mate clench and spasm around him was Draco’s undoing. He pounded into Harry twice more before his orgasm hit him so strongly he had to withdraw his fangs from his mate’s throat to suck in a strangled breath. Come flooded inside the brunet who lay limp and dazed, eyes half-mast as he watched Draco ride out the intense waves of pleasure. With a final jerk, Draco’s arms gave way and he fell, breathing harshly into Harry’s skin, his lover’s arms coming around to encircle him.
“Harry, just—” Hermione took a step towards him when a figure suddenly blocked her way. She blinked in surprise, staring up into Ron’s face. He stood in front of Harry protectively, frowning at the female.
Comments are love! The reception I receive from the first two chapters I will be posting will influence the decision I make to follow through with this idea so please, please review if you are enjoying it/want more!! Thank you!!
The knowing glint in Dumbledore’s eye warned the blond that the old man had grasped that that wasn’t entirely true. Before Draco could begin to contemplate what it was exactly the Headmaster knew, the older male spoke.
There were only few morning stragglers roaming around the common room when they entered but Hermione didn’t bother pausing to tell them to hurry. Instead, she tugged Ron up the staircase to Harry’s door, knocking on it gently.
, Pansy?” he demanded.
“Maybe I put it on for you, Malfoy,” Harry retorted.
“Nothing, he’s done nothing,” Draco said impatiently.
“Evidently it’s not enough,” Draco snarled. “Fuck off, Pansy.”
“It’s just a saying,” Hermione said exasperatedly, rolling her eyes.
Harry rolled back over, staring. Ron shrugged.
out here?”
“They’ve been… fine,” the blond replied evasively.
The brunet snorted. “More like he’s doing it because Malfoy and I are… spending time together.”
“You’re not staying for a secret boyfriend you’ve been hiding are you?” Ron asked suspiciously.
“… Do you experience those often?” Draco asked, wondering what he had gotten himself into.
Hermione frowned. “Irrational how?”
Instantaneously, Draco gagged, ripping his lips away in distaste as he snapped back away from her.
“But he—doesn’t he—don’t you
Still, with Malfoy currently nowhere in sight, the chance of bumping into him as Harry returned to his dormitory

before turning it on.”
“You mean he actually waited?” Ron asked, aghast.
Harry felt himself jerk violently as the orgasm ripped through him so forcibly he thought he’d split in two. His mouth was open in a silent scream of ecstasy, pleasure he had never dreamed of clouding his mind; his very being. Malfoy gave a guttural moan in reciprocation; Harry’s blood was like nothing he’d ever tasted in his life. It was like a rich, heavenly wine, and he could feel a power spreading through him he had never experienced. It was complete
Draco went through his friends and found Potter, clicking through to his page. There were no drawings displayed so Draco began to scroll, ignoring most of the posts. Determined, Draco went back a page in Harry’s blog, keeping an eye on when the posts had been uploaded or reblogged.
“Well—um, what did you want to talk about then?” he asked, holding his art book closer to his chest.
“Did something happen?” she asked.
Draco thought.
“Because it appears Harry is Draco’s blood-mate.”
Hermione sighed. “Harry, relax,” she said soothingly. “I know, okay? I know and I want to help you.”
The brunet flinched slightly at his words. “Why are relationships so fucking hard?” he muttered, staring fixatedly at the floor. His question elicited a chuckle from the blond and Harry lifted his head, a small ironic smile appearing on his lips.
Dazed and dark green eyes flickered open heavy lidded, confusion settling in their depths.
“I’m screwing around with Potter,” he said finally.
Malfoy had had to stomp on the snarl that wanted to rip from his chest when his mate had offered himself. Even now, with Harry’s blood pouring down his aching throat, his hunger for the brunet could not be satisfied. He’d craved his mate for so long… he was not ready to let go.
be humiliated.”
“Well? Did you get his number?” Pansy demanded as soon as the trio had left the café. “I saw the look he gave you on his way out—he totally did, didn’t he?”
“More important things than
Harry nodded vigorously, sweeping his gaze around the room. “Holy hell this is eerie.” He looked down at his hands, wiggling his fingers in front of his face. “It feels so surreal not to be wearing any glasses.” He studied his fingers intently, amazed at the detail he could clearly see without the unnatural magnification of his lenses.
“Potter, care to join us?” Draco smirked, offering the chair beside him.
“Yes, your parents.” The Dark Lord’s smile widened and Draco concealed a shiver. “Your mother tells me you live in France now. Tell me, Draco, will you be returning here to live in the near future?”
“But.”
Harry and Ron both stared obtusely at the Slytherin. She quirked an eyebrow as she spared them a quick glance.
“Yeah, I guess,” Harry replied.
“I can’t believe we went an entire week without this,” Malfoy moaned, teeth scraping mercilessly down Harry’s throat.
“Not on my hair.” Malfoy pointed out obviously. “You’d barely be able to see it.”
“Do you need anything while I’m here?”
The classroom had been set up as it had been before, with two places set at one end of the table. Hermione was hopping along after Ron who was instructing a hovering washcloth as it removed dust and stains from windows Draco hadn’t noticed before.
“So?” he managed.
Harry felt a shiver pass through him, the same spot on his neck tingling. “Why me?” he repeated with a frown. “Why not… Parkinson?”
Harry’s Head Boy badge flashed as he got to his feet. “No, it’s up to the fifth year prefects to make sure the first years make it to the tower.” He smiled wryly. “Don’t you remember, Ron?”
“I guess,” Harry muttered, glaring down at his plate.
“Indeed? So that hasn’t been you avoiding me for the past two days. Or you ducking out early with some ridiculous excuse every time we’ve been together. Not to mention the absurd way in which you have been avoiding even
“If you insist.” Malfoy smirked.
“Good!” Ron beamed. “You fall in love with him, he falls in love with you and
Harry offered a nervous smile.
“Half naked...” Hermione’s eyes narrowed. “Harry James Potter, you never told me you liked men! I can’t believe you didn’t tell me! Your
the idea… I did. It didn’t make any sense of course... not that I realised at the time. You’ve always been there, haven’t you, Harry? Capturing my attention…” he chuckled softly, shaking his head in disbelief. “If you’d had pigtails I believe I would have pulled them, purely to gain your attention.”
“Oh, the poor soul,” Hermione commented.
what he said to me.”
Draco leant down to kiss him as he quickened his pace. The feel of his mate around his cock was almost too much; Harry was so tight, so
His subconscious flared into life and Draco groaned aloud.
Harry’s eyes were heavy lidded as he gazed up at the male above him. Molten silver eyes stared back, unhidden love shining in their depths. Slowly, Draco raised his wrist to his mouth, his fangs glinting in the firelight. Harry’s pulse quickened, lust humming in his veins, as he watched Draco score himself, crimson liquid dribbling across his pale skin. Wordlessly, lips coated with his own blood, Draco offered his wrist to the brunet below him, who immediately lifted his head to seal his lips over the wound.
The music was loud.
Ron thought savagely,
Harry considered.
“Maybe he can actually be nice,” Harry smiled in return. “We’ve seen the way he is with his friends, he’s not a total arse to them.”
“And then there you were,” the blond continued, frowning down at his lap. “I craved you like nothing else, Harry, it was infuriating.”
The blond’s eyebrows pulled down into a frustrated frown. “Why on earth would Potter of all people be the one who notices I’ve changed? Our relationship doesn’t exactly extend passed the occasional insult.”

“No, no, not yet,” Harry replied. He carefully released Draco’s hands. “Wait here, alright?”

“I appreciate you giving me time to consider what I want from this bond,” Harry said, holding Malfoy’s stare. “…and I think I’ve made my decision.”
He hitched his bag further up his shoulder and stifled a yawn. God, he was definitely looking forward to that shower. This bloody essay had been the bane of his existence for the past two weeks, and what with Quidditch practice and Malfoy’s
Malfoy paused. “Yes, she did.” He frowned at the slightly flustered brunet. “Does it bother you that I know? It’s not something you should have to hide.”
“I expect a full report in two days, Lucius,” Voldemort continued, lifting the wineglass back into his hand as he deftly stroked a finger along the smooth stem. “We are very close to winning this battle, we cannot afford any failure.”
Pansy stared at the Gryffindor with mild repugnance. “I think you may be missing a crucial point here, Granger,” she remarked, annoyed. “Perhaps the fact that Draco ignorantly raped his mate and that Potter is going to kill him once he finds out? Or
His fangs throbbed. His body hummed.
be the one to tell him.”
“On his way,” Hermione replied. “He just had to finish something off.”
“George,” said one face.
Harry gaped. “No way.”
Feeling his fangs lengthen, Draco bent over Pansy’s wrist, fighting the urge to pull away as her scent surrounded him. The lore that vampires could drink from no one but their mate once the bond was initialised crossed his mind, but he had to try. It was blood—how on earth could a bond prevent him from digesting something he had happily managed only a few weeks before? Resolve overcame him as this thought settled in his head and, after a moment, he pierced her skin, her blood filling his mouth.
“Wait, Harry, please! This can still be fixed. I can—” her voiced faltered again as Ron stepped into her path once more, allowing the brunet the chance to exit the room.
They were barely touching and yet Harry still felt an energising shock whenever their hands brushed.
, Harry began to search for different words to see if that would reveal anything along what he desired. He tried ‘posting’, ‘journal’ and ‘diary like sites’ but nothing seemed to capture his interest. Running a hand through his hair in frustration, Harry wondering what other words he could use to describe what he was looking for.
“And you trust
Anger flared within the blond. “Don’t talk about my father that way,” Draco snapped.
and a
“Shut up,” Draco replied, wishing his cheeks would stop burning.
“Draco?”
With a groan, Draco shoved himself up off the wall and forced himself to walk, drawn instinctively through the castle to where his mate would be. His mate’s emotions were complacent at the moment and Draco couldn’t help but relish in the lack of burning anger and repulsion he normally felt flowing from Harry. These past two weeks in particular had been the most torturous. His growing hunger fuelled his need to be close to his mate… but with the overwhelming confusion and repugnance flowing from Harry in cascades he dared not approach lest he push the brunet further away.
“Not that I’d ever admit to it but I actually prefer Charms,” Pansy replied. “Potions really aren’t my strong point and if it wasn’t for Draco, I would have failed by now.”
“Ignore him,” Draco replied snobbishly. “I must be out of my mind to have thought I was falling from him. He’s an arrogant, self-loving, boorish Gryffindor.”
Hermione sat awkwardly still, not sure whether to turn around slowly to continue her homework or continued posing as she was. She opened her mouth to ask Harry when he suddenly sat back, pencil dropping to the floor beside his other artsy tools.
“Yes,” Ron pouted.

“Looks don’t necessarily do it for me,” Draco interrupted. “I’d rather be interested in someone with an attractive personality than a pretty face. There is no point in dating someone attractive when I can’t stand their presence.”
The Slytherin actually laughed, stepping closer to Harry who backed away once more.
wizarding bars. It wasn’t like the club—not at all. It was small, intimate, and best of all, quiet. He frequented it at least once a week, enjoying a drink or two with a friend to help him wind down from the stresses of work and his, typically, inconsistently erratic love life.
It had been even more of a shock to Draco’s system to realise that without his glasses, Potter was exceptionally good looking. Previously, Draco had been able to brush away potential feelings by focusing on how ridiculous the brunet’s glasses were and how owlish they made him appear. Little had Draco known that they had been masking those green eyes, hiding their full vibrancy from the world. It actually scared him to realise just how powerful Potter’s gaze was.
“Favourite hobby?” Draco asked, positive that he already knew the answer.
The stone wall began to slide away, revealing a dark, empty space that seemed to stretch forever. With an absent wave of his hand, Potter lit the torches inside and Draco found himself peering into a large common room of sorts, similar to the one he had belonged to at Beauxbatons. Except everything here was green, black, and silver.
Percy hobbled over to smack his brother. “Nice going,” he grumbled. His eyes widened as Draco stepped over them, continuing up the stairs.
Draco shook his head, hands clenching by his sides.
“Of course not.”
“Remind me again why we can’t goh to the Hospital Wing?” Ron grumbled as Harry handed him a glass of water.
Harry crossed the floor and sat on the edge of the bed. “See how the crest is upside down? Yeah turn it around so it’s the right way up.” Harry smiled. “You can only open laptops one way, alright? So make sure the crest is this way before lifting the lid up.”
fun.” He leered. Draco cut off Potter’s trail of curse words with his mouth, while his hand began to fumble with the button of Potter’s jeans. Finding it difficult with just one hand, Draco pulled away just enough to look down at the Gryffindor with a glare.
“Well?” the Slytherin said, glancing over his shoulder. “I’m not going to bag the Boy-Who-Lived on the floor thank-you-very-much. You might like carpet imprints on your knees but I for one do not.”
“On Tumblr?”
Hermione inclined her head, taking the chair and settling herself at the table hidden away in the shadows. She looked at the blond sitting beside Parkinson. “How’re you settling in?” she asked.
“Go figure,” Potter coughed. “Lucky for me being Head Boy means I get my own room.” He grinned brightly and it took all of Draco’s will power not to jump him right then and there.
And he was
Ron shoved the brunet carelessly off the bed, wrinkling his nose at the way Harry laughed. He threw a pillow as an added measure, rolling his eyes as he did so.
“Seen Ron yet?” Harry asked.
The Dark Lord was nothing as Draco had imagined. He was tall, easily six foot, with dark luscious brown hair pulled back by a strip of black leather. His body was swathed in black robes that flared behind him as he stalked across the room, giving an air of conceited aloofness. His muddy-red eyes swept the room unimpressively, his gaze landing on Draco who suddenly felt an uneasy jolt in the pit of his stomach.
The blond could practically
A contemplative expression passed over Hermione’s face. Parkinson raised an eyebrow.
“People know quality when they see it,” Hermione winked; glad to see it was Harry’s turn to blush. “Hey, who’s
“I should have realised earlier the reasons behind why you did what you did,” Draco murmured gently. “I’m still not happy with where we’re at, but I’m willing to give the chance to fix things.”
Hermione stared knowingly at the Slytherin. “Go. I’ll explain to Professor Babbling that Malfoy wasn’t feeling well and you took him to the Hospital Wing.”

of books!”
“Well, keep it down, alright? If Harry finds out about this, it will be our necks!” Percy hissed.
Hermione let out of deep breath. “Alright, well good. Does this mean it was a misunderstanding? What happened?”
A sigh seeped from Harry. “Guess you were right,” he mumbled. “About Malfoy being a good for nothing dick.”
Evidently not enough.
“At least we’re not sneezing bubbles or something,” Hermione coughed.
“For the last time, Pansy, take the damn sign
“That’s when I have Ancient Runes,” the female replied. “Oh, but I do get Wednesday and Friday afternoons off.”
“Since you’re apparently better than me at this,
What was the name of the site? It was a weird name… starting with T?
“Don’t leave my side, okay?”
For a second, Harry thought he’d almost convinced Hermione to let him take it easy this lesson—
“Last chance, Harry,” he moaned into Harry’s skin, “are you sure—?”
Crookshanks had long since grown bored of being carried around and had squirmed out of Draco’s arms some time during their presence along the fifth floor. The blond had quickly succumbed to casting a warming charm on himself to fight the icy chill, already missing the soothing weight of the cushion-cat. They were coming to the end of the sixth floor corridor when Draco spotted a shadowed staircase that Percy had subtly brushed passed.
“Other than, ‘
“Trust me, Potter,” Draco said seriously. “My secret is worth it.”
Shifting his gaze, Harry met Malfoy’s hesitant pale eyes, studying the blond carefully. “So… Voldemort did this to you, yeah?”
Draco thought snidely.
“Just by the abilities you seem to possess,” Malfoy replied, stepping out onto the ice beside the Gryffindor. “Drawing, ice skating—one might actually think you were normal.”
Ron’s gaze grew steadily more concerned as he stared at Harry, who felt uncomfortably exposed beneath his gaze.
“Something troubling you, mate?”
Harry allowed his legs to unfold and he stretched leisurely, shifting forward until he was sitting on the edge of the ledge.

“Don’t you want to do something about it?” Pansy frowned. “Ignore the school, ignore the inevitable gossip, just
The blond followed their movements to a table directly within his sights, his heart thumping uncharacteristically quickly in his chest.
, Pansy.”
All too soon, Draco found himself outside a pair of large, dark, mahogany doors. He reached for the handle hesitantly, his resolve strengthening as he jutted his chin defiantly.
“How could he?” Draco sneered in reply. “It’s nothing I should be concerned with—what are the chances?”
“Drawing.”
If you or anyone you know can translate English to French PLEASE CONTACT ME! I want to have french-speaking Draco in this fic and I want to make sure it is correct. I do not want to have to rely on Google translate. You guys and Draco deserve better!! Thank you!
“We’ll have to find you a green one then,” Harry grinned, placing the crown on his head. “What do you think?”
“This entire mess affected me more than I realised it would and I think that is the main reason why I refused to admit the truth about my blog. I had myself convinced that I wouldn’t care if you did find out… and yet all I’ve wanted to do since this fell apart was make it better. I felt awful knowing what I had done and what… what you might be feeling as a result. I—thank you for staying and hearing me out tonight, Harry. Really.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Nothing new, I assure you,” Harry said then, pushing the thoughts of Malfoy away. “You done here in the library? Want to get some lunch before class?”
“How many fingers?” Ron asked, holding up three.
Harry huffed. “You’re such a fu—
“Positive?”
“Oh?” the female sitting beside him questioned casually. “An exchange of insults then?”
“You leave your hands where they are,” he ordered. “Yes?”
“How’re you feeling, Mione?” he asked gently.
“Oh god… I’m falling for Potter,” Draco whispered.
Harry had his parchment book open and leaning against his legs, back pressed up against the tree trunk and pencil moving carelessly. He wasn’t paying much attention to what he was drawing but he liked the way the patterns swirled down the side. A laugh from Hermione had his gaze moving and he smiled at the easy way Hermione and Ron seemed to be talking.
Hands, strong and powerful, gripped Lucius’s robe, dragging the man forward until the blond was mere inches from the angry, glowing green eyes.
“Uh huh…”
“Melodramatic Gryffindor,” Draco shot back.
Giggling, Hermione scrolled through the list of names, recognising many from their own house. “Hey look, Dean has a Facebook as well.”
The Black Stump was one of Harry’s
“I wonder what’s up Malfoy’s arse this morning?” Ron muttered. “The toast was probably too brown or something.”
Frowning faintly, Harry asked the question that had been burning on his lips since the evening started. “Why, after all these years, did you finally decide I was worth talking to?”
“Yes,” the blond purred, leaning down to trail his tongue along one of Harry’s neck tendons, “an
Before Draco could even blink, he felt his body being shoved away from the wand, the case slamming down over the top so brutally the glass cracked. The blond stumbled, feeling his heart begin to thump as his eyes landed on Potter’s enraged form.
He chuckled softly; Malfoy hadn’t been joking when he’d said he would make Harry eat his words.
He could feel himself losing control.
“…Eventful…” Harry replied with half a smile. “Hey, Ron,” he said, catching sight of his best friend behind Hermione.
“Told her what?”
“Well?” Pansy questions as she sat down. “So spill.”
“Oh please,” Hermione scoffed with a smile.
“Yes,” she said, eyes alight. “Potter.”
Perhaps, if he indulged Eli a little, it would make him more comfortable to speak with Harry on a more personal level? It was either that or call an end to their date which, as much as Harry was keen on that idea, having Malfoy witness the entire ordeal made it less appealing. He risked a quick glance in the blond’s direction as Eli stared in disdain at his drink, stiffing at the contents tentatively. Malfoy was alone for time being, taking a sip from a clear goblet that looked to hold red wine. Harry wondered where Parkinson had gone—probably the bathroom or something.
The Dark Lord took a sip, enjoying the earthy tones of the wine as he contemplated his plan. Draco had certainly captured his attention; Lucius’s stories of the boy had barely done him justice. It was true Voldemort’s interest had been kindled when the older Malfoy had spoken of his son… and yet to see the young blond in person…
A small smile tugged at Ron’s lips. “So are you going to date Neville then?”
Hermione nodded immediately. “Yes, of course,” she said. “Is everything alright?”
“Is that even possible?” Draco replied.
They kissed languidly, unrushed, and Harry could feel his cock swelling in response. Malfoy moaned as Harry tore away from the Slytherin’s mouth and began sucking on his pale neck, Malfoy’s fingers digging into the Gryffindor’s upper arms.
“Malfoy and me becoming friends,” Harry all but grumbled.
“I’m glad you’re alright,” the bushy brunette smiled. “And relieved that the potion didn’t do any serious damage.”
Draco nodded.
fun.” He leered.
,” he snapped, standing.
Students were filing out of Professor McGonagall’s class, thoroughly looking forward to the prospect of relaxing for an hour before dinner. It had been a long day and Harry could feel the exhaustion of the study work-load tensing his shoulder muscles as he lifted his bag. Beside him, Ron was glowering as he shoved his wand and bits of parchment into his own bag.
’ act, I’d
interesting year.”
I was ever going anyway near
“You’re a male,” she smirked in reply. “It’s only natural.”
Malfoy was staring at him, his silver eyes so intense that Harry felt babbling words on the edge of his lips, ready to explain.
Not to mention the fact that Malfoy had a
“Well good,” she said, getting to her feet.

“Maybe,” he said. “I have other hobbies than annoying Potter.”
The blond swallowed.
like me.”
“Yeah.” Ron sighed. “What’s the bet she gives me a detention right before our quidditch match.”
Draco had to tear his eyes away from the Gryffindor’s tight stomach before replying. “Topping usually,” he replied. “I have bottomed only a few times. I’m not sure if I happened to be with the wrong person or whatever it was but I didn’t find it particularly enjoyable.”
“Because we’re study partners, remember? Everyone was supposed to exchange emails with their partner when you were assigned,” Hermione explained patiently. “Harry?”
Hermione’s smile grew. “Ron and I will support you whatever you decide.”
“What do you mean?” Hermione suddenly gasped. “Your vision? You can see perfectly?
imperative a bond could be to a vampire. If Malfoy had felt this way since the very beginning… how on earth had he survived this long?
The young Ravenclaw girl gazed shyly at the brunet and Harry offered a kind smile in return.
more interesting to do,” Malfoy replied, easing himself comfortably between Harry’s legs.
“Why?”
Draco folded his arms with a huff. “Why aren’t you staying? I thought your parents were going away as well.”
Harry and Ron guffawed with laughter much to Hermione’s displeasure.
“Come on,” he said instead, “we’re going to be late for breakfast.”
“Let me fill Ron in first, Hermione,” Harry said as he approached the bed. “So, um, do you remember the conversation we had about how there is a certain type that I like in a guy?”
A smirk curled at Malfoy’s lips. “You’re not very subtle when it comes to staring at people, Harry.”
Pansy snorted gently.
Malfoy’s voice sounded distant. It seemed to echo in Harry’s head, bouncing louder and softer within the inside of his ears. He thought he heard the blond curse; it was hard to distinguish words suddenly. They sounded fuzzy, as if Malfoy was speaking through a broken speaker.
Harry sighed, wiping a hand over his face as he leant against the wall. He would have liked to believe that Malfoy desired him; someone as strong and attractive as the blond certainly excited him like nothing else. With intense silver eyes that seemed to change shades depending on Malfoy’s mood and a wicked sharp tongue; how Harry wished he wasn’t at the other end of the other boy’s insults.
“I guess you could say that,” he muttered finally, glancing at his friends.
“Shower him with compliments!”
“Exactly,” Harry agreed, nodding. “With little-to-no coordination I’m obviously terrible at sex; it’s probably the reason I keep having so many flings.”
It was now or never.
Yet another long hiatus that I am incredibly sorry for! I was so desperate to get this next chapter up and running that I'm not entirely sure about how good it is. I apologise if it's not up to my usual standard, my brain no-worky so well lately! Thank you for sticking with me this entire time! Yes, the story is finally coming to an end and I've had an absolute blast writing it. I hope you guys have enjoyed it just as much!
him, Pansy. I still do! But he—fuck! He doesn’t remember what happened. He thinks it was a dream.”
“So Harry
The tree, as if realising the opponent it now faced, began to twist and sway in agitation, more and more branches being flung at the brunet who held his ground, blocking Draco from the shattering strikes. The blond winced at the cracks that pierced the night air—
Malfoy scoffed. “Please, Potter, I’m just that good.” He took Harry’s hand, leading him deeper into the room. He paused near the fire and turned, facing his mate and biting his bottom lip. “I need to be honest with you, Harry. Something more than a simple blood exchange is required in order to complete the bond between us.”
the blond replied silently, finding it difficult to remove his gaze from the Gryffindor.
“Hmm, yes I noticed that as well.” Hermione frowned, tapping a finger against her lips.
Over and over again Malfoy brought Harry to the brink but would not allow him to finish. Harry could tell that Malfoy was taking great pleasure in having so much control. The teasing had almost become too much for the brunet when Malfoy suddenly hummed around Potter’s arousal, and the sudden vibrations effectively broke the hold Harry had. He came with a cry, back arching for what seemed an eternity until he slumped back down against the carpet, eyes closed and mouth lax.
Harry’s subconscious thought bitterly as he slipped into his seat at the Gryffindor table.
A lump formed in Harry’s throat.
nicely.” Malfoy’s tone was teasing, a refreshing change to the usual controlled civil tone he was used to hearing during their brief conversations. “Is there anything you would like for me to bring?”
With a huff, Potter dropped the puppy-dog look. “Can’t blame a guy for trying.”
Harry swung his head around. True enough Charlie Weasley, with his arm slung comfortably around the shoulders of a young male with chestnut coloured hair, was crossing the dance floor towards them and gesturing madly at their table. The brunet couldn’t help but brace himself warily.
Draco blinked. “Don’t you dare,” he growled at his subconscious. “We’re annoying him and that’s it.”
time. And he knew it.
Pansy sighed but remained sitting. “I’ll check on you during break.”
“So what’s the site?” Hermione asked.
The brunet choked a derisive laugh as he turned away, needed to look at anything besides the Slytherin.
Draco woke with a gasp. Vivid images of his lingering nightmare flickered before his eyes, his heart thundering in his chest. Each scene had been worse than the one that preceded it, tormenting Draco’s mind ruthlessly with Voldemort’s ominous promises.
“I have a blog,” Harry sighed. “She found it.”
Malfoy snorted. “I think you need to procure new friends.”
“Yep, but don’t press it too hard,” Harry said, knowing Ron’s unusual way of dealing with muggle items.
Everything the club represented was so
The blond swallowed; his throat continued to ache. “My lord, I—”
Pansy’s smirk grew wider.
“I beg your pardon, my lord, but I don’t understand,” the blond murmured, eyeing Voldemort warily.
Chided by his own subconscious, Draco gripped his wand, straighten his spine, and entered.
“…because we both take History of Magic?”
Harry chuckled. “Well… I guess you could always join me…”
The journey across the school grounds was eerily silent, only the occasional scrape of Lucius’s foot broke the still air. He kept his wand unlit, not wishing to draw any further attention to his presence. Upon reaching the crumbling staircase to the large wooden doors, Lucius cast one last glance around and entered the castle.
“What did he say?” Hermione asked then, voice low and direct.
“Do you realise what you could have
“Oh my god.”

he thought.
“You can’t avoid him forever.”

Draco’s jaw clenched. “Yes,” he replied through gritted teeth, “I feel fucking awful. But, get this, I’m actually trying to make
“I don’t know if I want to.”
“Dumbledore didn’t mention that during the feast.” Harry pouted.
As for the internet, Draco managed to acquire a prepaid internet USB device that he could plug into the side of his laptop. He’d been fascinated the first week of using it, discovering many sites that represented different things.
The blond couldn’t help the small smile that tugged at his lips. Pansy
Comments are love!!
Draco severely hoped not.
life a living hell?”
“But don’t frighten the poor boy,” Hermione added hastily, knowing how fragile Harry’s patience was.
Since when do you draw?”
Thank you to everyone who read and commented! Your comments are what keep me going! A possible sequel is in the works but it will probably depend on the amount of interest I receive. This story was so much fun to write! Thank you all again!!
Draco sent back his reply and returned to his dashboard, scrolling through many stimulating posts that assisted in calming his simmering anger. Draco wasn’t even sure why he was so upset over Potter’s admission. Honestly, it made it better that the Wizarding world wasn’t aware their Golden Boy was bent. It would make his humiliation
to ask Draco out now, would he? And it would be better for Draco to give his number rather than expect the poor bloke to fork out his own; at least it would save Draco from the embarrassment of being denied to his face.
“Well how often have you seen each other? I know you guys studied the other day.”
Draco felt himself grow still. Of all the words he expected to fall from the female’s mouth, it was definitely not
“There, there, Harrykins,” Seamus crooned. “I’m pretty sure half of Gryffindor has guessed that you are.”
in a handsome sort of way. Standing next to him, Harry could imagine exactly how inadequate people must feel. And, by god, if Malfoy had been perfect before, he was a freaking Adonis now with his hair mussed and cheeks flushed.
“Alright,” Harry replied, “but there is something I want to talk with you about. Are you free after class?”
“Yeah, I’m surprised Pansy didn’t tell you—she’s asked me to draw her numerous times,” Potter continued.
“It’s what you do for an adopted brother,” Charlie had said with a smirk. “You’re the only one left without a partner.”
it!” he groaned miserably. “
“So what should mine be?” Ron asked.
“But be gentle.”
The Gryffindor smirked. “Caring has nothing to do with it.”
Malfoy’s gaze shot back to his. “It… isn’t?”
“Well good, hopefully they’ll provide the answers we’re after.” Pansy flicked her hand in the direction of the classroom. “You can fill me in on what you’ve read so far before Binns arrives.”
Their lips pressed together lovingly, Harry’s hand coming up to rest against Draco’s slightly flushed cheek. They pulled away and Harry stared up at him with shining eyes.
“That’s true.” Harry tapped a finger against his lips. “Okay, I’ll tell Ron as well.”
Not only did Pansy fetch him a glass of water but she also dampened a cloth to lie across his hot forehead. His cheeks were unnaturally flushed, contrasting oddly with his pale, although somewhat greyish, skin.
’ and ‘
Potter sniggered. “Fine. Out of all my hobbies I think drawing is my favourite.”
Now this is just a rough draft of the chapter but since you lovely people have waited for so long already, I'm posting it tonight for you and will edit tomorrow. ENJOY! Please ignore any mistakes :D

Interest immediately sparked within the blond. “Oh, so
“Enjoying your holidays?”
Draco shrugged. “We crossed paths on the way to dinner,” he replied. He held the female’s gaze, refusing to allow her scrutiny to break him.
A wicked smile appeared on Malfoy’s face. “Part of the plan, Potter. Weasley was to find the most unsuitable male he could and convince you to go to the Black Stump where I, wonderful, considerate, evening-saving Draco Malfoy, would just
Draco’s eyes flew open and he gawked at the sight of Potter standing over him, one hand clenched tightly around the offending branch. He tossed it away as it was nothing but a twig and Draco could only stare at the strength the young man wielded.
“Yeah, mate,” Ron chimed in, “except you promised I could get in at least one hex, yeah? Since he acted like a dick before.”
happy.”
Draco’s hand faltered but he refused to face the man he once thought he loved. He could hear Harry’s strangled breathing behind him and he closed his eyes, regaining his composure.
, and move it across. See?” Harry chuckled at Ron’s reaction. “That’s how you move it. When you have the arrow over whatever it is you want to click on, either tap the black square or use the left button directly below—yeah that one.”
“You’re right,” the brunet murmured softly, glancing at the ground.
“Alright,
“Of course I’ll keep it safe... as long as I can look through it,” she grinned.
“No it’s alright, but thank you,” Pansy replied. “Wash your hands though just in case, I’m sure Draco’s germs are all over me.”
Taking Malfoy’s earlobe between his teeth, Harry began to demonstrate the skills Malfoy had also been teaching him over the last week and he soon had the blond barely able to gasp for breath.
“I—well, yes?”
have any news to tell us?” she asked.
“Come with me,” Draco murmured.
Granger handed over the utensil, and Draco watched as Potter began to cut up the Valerian roots into small enough pieces they would be able to pulverise into a powder. Draco couldn’t help but scrutinise Potter’s movements, noticing that Granger was doing the same. She flinched when the brunet’s hand slipped, the knife skidding off the roots abruptly.
“Because I knew you were lying to me, Harry.” Hermione lifted an eyebrow. “I was worried.”
Harry screamed as his orgasm hit, ropes of come shooting from his untouched cock and splattering between them, body convulsing.
“Exactly what I said,” Draco replied, leaning back on his pillows. “We avoided each other all holidays. I did try once to see if he was tolerable but alas there were no sparks.”
“I knew it,” she breathed, admiring the way Harry had captured Malfoy’s… pleasant side. She’d known that Harry was up to something every time she caught him sneaking out. She’d taken to heading upstairs to his dormitory, finding his map and tracking his footsteps. The first time she’d seen his name alongside Draco Malfoy’s she’d been shocked until she noticed that they weren’t actually close enough to be talking or fighting or
” she hissed. “Draco! Since when?!”
“I may be overthinking it, Pans,” he admitted. “I mean, you said it yourself, didn’t you? Things weren’t going to go immediately back to the way they had been.”
“Of course not,” the red head snorted.
“Yeah, good one,” the Gryffindor finally uttered, crossing his arms against his chest. “Draco Malfoy a fucking vampire. Sure.”
“You could, at the very least, offer to buy me a drink, Potter.”
Harry thought.
“Yes,” Harry snarled, wiping the goop from his face as students filed out of the classroom around them. “It’s
“What are you planning, Draco?” Pansy asked snidely, stepping up beside him.
“You and Potter! Did anything happen?” she asked, bouncing excitedly on the bed. “Well?”
It wasn’t until his head was resting on his lover’s shoulder, a soothing finger tracing his lips, that Harry realised he had been moaning Draco’s name. He sucked gentle, open-mouth kisses on the damp skin of Draco’s neck, enjoying the feel of arms wrapping around him securely.
“Funny how things turn out,” he replied, turning his head. “I for one do not regret this at all.” He caught a gentle smile as it appeared of Malfoy’s face.
“The time has come, Lucius,” he said, placing aside his wineglass.
“If there’s anything we can—Ron,
“Afraid to be my friend, Malfoy?” Potter asked challengingly.
With his heart in his throat, Harry looked at the Slytherin’s blog name.

you don’t want come to with us to see Bill and Fleur?”
” he choked out.
Pansy practically squealed and even the blond couldn’t contain his smile.
“Don’t be mean,” Hermione frowned playfully.
When he finally make it to the last landing, the stairs did indeed, stop right before his door. A large plaque in gold was stamped across the wood, ‘HEAD BOY’ practically screaming at him. With a small sigh, Harry entered his new room and caught sight of Ron sprawled on his large four poster bed. Ron’s new laptop lay beside him in a black satchel bag.
“God, I don’t even care,” Harry replied. “Let me grow boils; I’m going back to the common room.”
“But you’re
“Yes,” Draco coughed, fighting back a laugh. “But you also made it quite clear that you’d give Potter an

“Goodness me, look at the time,” Percy suddenly exclaimed, pointing to his own face. “It’s about time we all went off to bed!”
with—
“But he is being so
“It’s forbidden!” Harry abruptly snarled, halting the blond in his tracks. He turned away angrily, his tattered robes swishing out behind him as he continued to stalk down the corridor.
“What’s wrong?” Hermione asked as soon as they were alone.
The voices in his head thought of nothing else but claiming his mate, swirling in his mind and filling his subconscious with vicious visions. The imagined sensation of piercing Harry’s delectable skin, blood coursing down his throat, filling him, strengthening him…
He checked his watch—it was ten thirty. He’d slept through breakfast, being too tired to get himself out of bed. Instead he’d lounged on his laptop, gathering his courage to face the day and a certain Slytherin.
“Are we… alright now?” Draco found himself asking, surprising himself at how vulnerable he sounded.
“I want to talk to you,” she continued, brushing a wayward lock of hair from her face.
“Why not?” Ron asked. “He likes you, doesn’t he?”
“This isn’t what I wanted!” Malfoy snapped back angrily. “For fucks sake, Pansy… you know I never wanted this.”
Harry bit his lip.
“Funnily enough it’s red,” Pansy replied in a nonchalant tone. “Yours?”
Aaanndd repeat.
Harry’s heart thudded. “Are we?” he asked, voice laced with uncertainty. “…a pair?”
,” the brunet snarled, glaring down at the candelabra.
“Merlin’s beard, Ron, you need to be more aware! The end of the curse is drawing nearer—do you not realise this will be the time that—”
And it was just fine.
“I never said that,” Potter grumbled, looking away.
” she asked incredulously.
“Well yeah I guess so but what we have is more—well we’re not boyfriends or anything… just mucking around,” Harry said with a shrug. “It’s not serious.”
Harry thought miserably.
And what he desired more than anything in the entire world was Harry Potter.
Once his mate’s skin was pristine once more, Draco pulled away, his lips positively tingling after being in contact with the brunet. He lifted his gaze, astonished to see the heated look evident in the intense emerald gaze as Harry surveyed him. Harry’s eyes flickered downwards, resting on Draco’s lips momentarily before they returned to his own stare. Before Draco could process the silent request, Harry’s fingers had delved into the front of his robes and the blond was yanked forwards, their mouths crashing together in a searing embrace.
“Maybe this is for the best,” the blond continued, ignoring Pansy. “I really don’t think I could handle a situation like this ever again. If Potter decides months from now to break up with me I’m going to be inconsolable.”
“Do you mind moving aside? I need to make sure I get the book
“Beauxbatons.”
“Well… why don’t you join Charlie on the dance floor?”
Hermione returned the Slytherin’s smirk. “My apologies.”
“Potter,” the blond pouted and Pansy smiled knowingly.
“Will you join me—” the young man cleared his throat once more and Draco’s eyes swept up to meet vivid green. “Would you
Well we're almost there!! Thank you to everyone who has stuck with me through the process of this story. It the very first multi-chaptered fic I have ever posted to the public. Thank you for all of the wonderful comments and support that egged me on! <3
With a smothered groan, Draco closed his eyes. He knew if he left now, Potter would not survive the cold.
“Maybe, although at least I’ve found my calling,” Harry smirked.
He brushed aside the roots he’d sliced and took another, beginning to cut them distractedly as his train of thought drifted again.
“But, Hermione, we still have
“Come on, mate, you were staring at Malfoy again. I think it’s painfully obvious that you miss him.”
“The charms have worked then?” the female asked.

Time slowed. Stopped.
lack of judgement lately, I wouldn’t be surprised if he didn’t.” She got to her feet, brushed down her robes and levelled a careful look at the vampire still kneeling on the carpet. “I’ve stood by you through a lot, Draco Malfoy, and I will continue to do so, but this has to be the most idiotic thing you’ve ever done. How can you expect me to sit silently by should Potter reject you?”
Three fingers.
Lucius gaped. He had not expected the sheer amount of power that encircled the dark form. It surrounded them both and the blond was unable to tear his eyes away from the malevolent force.
“Oh my
“Yes,” Draco murmured, his eyes opening. “Thank you.”
“Hello again,” Draco greeted.
Four fingers.
“Why so interested, Harry?” Ron asked.
“How on earth were you sorted into Gryffindor, Granger?” the female Slytherin commented, slightly impressed.
“I told you never to come here!” Potter’s voice was louder now, his fury making his magic crackle.
?” he spat.
Concealing a shiver, Harry forced his gaze down, trying to ignore the blush he could feel creeping up his neck. A particular spot on the skin of his throat tingled and he found himself brushing his fingertips across the sensitive section, swallowing. When a pair of silver eyes met his, Harry found himself blushing furiously, gaze dropping to the table top.
A soft smile appeared on Draco’s face. Clean clothes, regardless of where they came from within an enchanted wardrobe, were definitely appealing.
“You’re in my head all the time, Draco, even before I knew what I was to you,” Harry continued. His cheeks began to grow warm at his admission but he held Malfoy’s gaze despite, needing the vampire to see that he was serious. “And I don’t see the point in pretending that I never wanted this. Because I do, Draco, fuck it all, I actually do.”
“You have a funny way of showing it!”
With one last furtive glance at the gorgeous dark-haired male, Draco distracted himself with brewing coffee and steaming milk, carefully preparing each drink to his always demanding perfection. He reached up for three mugs, poured each drink expertly, before plating them on the side bench ready to be taken to the table.
The words barely registered in Draco’s mind as his body suddenly began to hum, his fangs lengthening and his eyes zeroing in on the delectable red liquid now dripping down Potter’s left index finger. A soft growl was emanating from his aching throat and it wasn’t until Pansy had stepped into his path that he realised he was moving. Without thinking, Draco brought up his hands to shove the brunette out of his way, gaze still locked on Potter.
Draco felt himself nod, his mind aberrantly blank.
“Good luck,” Potter sneered.
small smile tugging at his lips, Malfoy looked completely perfect. His chest rose and fell with each calming breath and Harry watched intently, following the defined shapes of Malfoy’s torso through the material of his quidditch gear.
“Who have you been with?” Malfoy asked.
“I think…” Draco began, his thoughts swirling in his mind, “that as much as Harry says we’re alright now… deep down I’m not entirely sure he has forgiven me.”
believe, however, in indulging just enough that it makes you come crawling back for more.”
The Gryffindor nodded. Satisfied, Draco offered a gentle smile, pleased at how far the two of them had come.
Hermione giggled softly, taking a seat beside Harry near the fireplace. “So what are you drawing?”
to see you out and about, young sir!” Percy interjected, spying Draco as he entered the room. “I am Percy, head of—
“Of course not,” Harry winked. “Not you, never you.”
“Shut up, Potter, you’re ruining the mood.”
“Deny all you want, Harry,” the blond stated, “but I can read you better than anyone and you fucking know it. Stop behaving like a repugnant child.”
make me wait, Lucius.” The voice was hissed and the blond felt his body go cold.
He turned, eyes finally landing on the male gazing up at him, a gentle smile on his face.
Without another word, the blond turned on his heel and marched back down to the dungeons, trying to ignore the pleased insults that were currently spewing from the Weasel’s mouth at his retreat.
!” Ron’s gleeful laugh broke Harry’s thoughts and he looked over at his friend, quirking an unimpressed eyebrow.
“Oh, well I’ll befriend him,” Harry replied, sitting up to take a look. “Nice picture,” he grinned. “I wonder if Ron knows?”
Draco was careful as he entered. He had to duck his head, and he kept his steps light, trying to minimise the noise of him passing through. The room he stepped into was dark, the only light the moon, which poured in through various windows that surrounded Draco in a circular fashion. He stared around in amazement, eyes tracking over the destroyed furniture. Bits of wood, cushion, even parchment and broken quills, lay scattered around and the blond felt his heart sink at the sight.
The silence that filled the room was shattered by Harry’s roar.
it was Malfoy, Harry?” Hermione frowned, handing her best friend a towel she’d transfigured.
Harry snorted with laughter, clutching his side as his fear drained away into humour. “Ron, you are fantastic,” he giggled.
“This conversation just became even stranger.” Harry pulled an undignified face. “How on earth would Malfoy know anything about laptops?”
“That’s… reassuring…”
Ron’s eyebrows rose. “Was that Dean?” he asked in surprise.
“She said you should give Malfoy a chance,” Ron repeated, nose crinkling at the very idea.
“Good god, you’re serious about this.”
Harry smiled but shook his head. “Thanks, Lindy, but I’m good with my tiara,” he winked.
Harry’s scream of ecstasy echoed all around them and Draco was eternally thankful for the implied silencing charms the Room of Requirement no doubt possessed.
“And a skilful little bugger at that,” Draco agreed.
putting up with your attitude today.” She glared until he relented, watching him grab his bag and stalk out of the Great Hall. With a snort she turned back to her breakfast. “Prissy blond.”
Draco smiled wryly, ignoring his subconscious as he entered the Great Hall for dinner. Instead of having a few places set up on their regular house tables, Dumbledore had insisted that they all sit together at a smaller table for the duration of the holidays seeing as there were only a few students who had elected to stay. Already, eight of the ten seats were occupied by either a student or teacher, leaving either a spot opposite Potter and beside a young Ravenclaw girl or a seat in between a rather large Hufflepuff boy and a grumpy looking Gryffindor.
“Insecurities I guess,” Harry said uncertainly, running a hand through his hair to dislodge the snowflakes that had fallen. “You can know someone for your entire life and still not be sure with how they would react.”
Draco’s sobs had long since subsided. Although his cheeks were still lined with dry-tear tracks, his breathing had returned to a normal, somewhat calm state. He’d been staring into the fireplace for the past hour, watching the flickering flames he’d cast to help warm the unpleasantly cold room. From his surroundings, he’d gathered that this had been one of the four Hogwarts houses, most likely Slytherin, if the snake decorum was anything to go by. He had yet to search for a bedroom, assuming the old student dorms were up one of the two staircases he could see from his position on the couch. Instead, he’d slowly begun the arduous process of working out what the hell he was going to do now. Here he was, a
She turned immediately for the bed, sitting back down on the edge of the mattress and drawing back her robe sleeve. She watched Draco as he crossed the floor to join her, kneeling beside the bed. She offered her arm silently and Draco found that he could only stare at the exposed flesh. He eyed Pansy’s wrist with distaste, the thought of drinking from anyone else besides Harry making his stomach churn. But he had to. He had already succumbed to his desire once… he couldn’t do it again. Potter still had

was exceptional at for a change. With his enjoyment beginning to flow, Harry sat comfortably whilst Hermione became lost in her novel.
“He was making fun of my quidditch skills!”
With a breathy laugh, Potter replied. “We haven’t done anything yet.”
Harry felt his stomach drop. Wrapping his arms around his torso, he spoke. “And what’s that,” he said deadpanned, knowing exactly what the answer would be.
A quick knock on his door had him lifting his head. Scenarios of Harry returning, apologising for his weird behaviour filled his mind before the door opened, Pansy’s familiar face appearing and immediately dashing Draco’s aspirations.
his subconscious murmured smugly.
“God can’t I get
“From what you have explained to me, Pansy, isn’t it obvious?” Hermione frowned at the Slytherin. “Draco craves Harry in a way he doesn’t crave anyone else—what does that tell you?”
“Try to be patient, Harry,” Hermione insisted carefully. “The poor thing has lost his family and his freedom all in one day.”
“What’s this?” Hermione’s voice joined them as the bushy-haired brunette sat across from them at the table, her eyebrows raised.
Sunlight filtered into the classroom. Everything suddenly seemed too bright—too exposed. Even though Granger shared their secret, Pansy felt uncomfortable divulging the truth behind what Draco had done. What if Granger flipped her lid? What if she turned on them?
“Are you sure you’re alright?” she found herself asking.
Draco swallowed again, the tremor in his body growing.
“Oh, Draco! Good morning!”
Hermione rolled her eyes. “I doubt that will ever be the case but fine. You guys will be the first to know if Parkinson turns out to be a lying fiend.”
Harry’s smile softened. “I think that’s really nice,” he said honestly.
Harry allowed his eyes to move off of his best friend’s face to the retreating back of a particular blond Slytherin.
“Where’s Ron this evening?” Harry asked as he ignored many of the friend requests he had.
After falling in love with the Mediterranean milieu of southern France, Draco had made the choice to remain, purchasing himself a penthouse in Perpignan, where he had been living ever since his graduation three years prior.
“It’s true,” Draco pressed, regardless of the anger he could feel whirling within his mate. “I was turned during the summer holidays—”
Draco’s subconscious murmured alluringly.
“Want to have a look at mine? Hermione’s already gone over it.”
Draco smiled gently. “I know,” he murmured.
Draco tore his mouth away. Hot, bruising kisses began to line the brunet’s jaw and Harry instinctively exposed his neck, a moan rumbling in his throat as he felt the familiar scrape of Draco’s fangs along his skin.
“Why didn’t you tell me?”
“Yeah, Ron?”
“Harry? Are you still here?” she called softly. She tried the handle, relieved to find it unlocked and she pushed it open.
“Would you try to kill him?”
“Of course,” Harry said immediately, turning his parchment book around. “What do you think?”
“Since when does Harry Potter have a house elf?” Draco asked curiously, leading Potter down the stairs into the dungeons.
Damn it.
“Alright… now.”
“Have to see Professor Snape,” Pansy said in reply. “But we’ll do this again soon.”
“Oh... good,” Pansy said, relief evident in her voice.
Draco found himself smiling ironically as he entered the Entrance Hall. It lasted a mere moment before a barked laugh caught his attention and looked up, coming to an immediate halt. Potter was coming down the stairs, grinning brightly at the Weasel beside him who was roaring with laughter. Despite the echoing belly-laughs, Draco could not take his eyes off the smiling raven-haired Gryffindor. There was no usual rush of contempt that the blond was used to whenever he saw the Golden Boy. Instead, Draco actually felt compelled to
“Draco doesn’t know what to do with all this attention, especially from
A wicked smile twisted at Draco’s lips.
Harry snorted but didn’t deny the statement. “This is different, Ron,” he said, lying back on his bed. “Draco
Harry shrugged. “Sort of?” he replied. “Draco doesn’t want me to dive straight into this—and I agree with him. We’re attempting the concept of friends before considering something more serious. I’d rather become comfortable with the idea of the bond without the pressure, you know? He said we can remain friends if that’s all I want.”
“Go on, Harry,” Hermione prodded gently. “Whatever it is you have to tell us I am sure we will understand.”
“Fucking
“Ready?” Draco asked, removing his fingers from within Potter and spreading the oil up and down his erection with his other hand.
“I said
“Pansy’s going to kill me,” he grumbled, pressing the ‘ask’ button. “How dare I give Potter a compliment.”
have a point…”
“To keep in contact with friends,” Harry replied. “It’s better for those people who don’t see each other as often as we do.”
of all people.”
“That Potter just happens to be particularly delicious to vampires?”
“Done,” he announced with a grin.
“Are you alright?” Hermione asked. “Do you need anything?”
“Oh, it’s lovely in France, isn’t it.” The teapot sighed blissfully. “I went there over the summer one year with my parents.”
His subconscious hissed.
“Please tell me you’re not going to dinner as you are,” the blond commented, casting a glance at the Gryffindor who looked down at his clothes.
,” Harry moped. “No secret boyfriend for me.”
“Too late,” Ron muttered, “he’s already done that.”
“Sorry,” Potter muttered at his side. “I’ll try to remember to keep the castle warmer. The cold doesn’t affect me anymore.”
“Ah, but you see I am Head Boy, who says anyone has to find out who did it?”
Potter responded with enthusiasm, gliding his hands over the freshly exposed skin of Draco’s back. “So what’s step one?” he mumbled breathlessly.
Harry threw his freckled friend a glare. “It’s not like I woke up this morning with the sudden urge to be Malfoy’s best friend.”
With his attention thoroughly distracted, he did not notice two little forms crouched in the shadows beside the top of the stairs, nor did he suspect a tripping jinx until it was cast. His legs locked together, torso pitching forward as Draco received a grand look of how very long the stairs really were.
Clicking on the link, Draco found himself on a rather feminine looking page with one of Potter’s drawings as their latest reblog.
“There’s a good boy,” the voice crooned.
“I take mild offense to that,” Draco sniffed. “I’m not going to tell anyone your secret, Potter, of that you can be sure.”
Thin lips pressed into a straight line, grey eyes narrowing slightly. As much as Draco would have preferred to ask the brunet if everything was alright, he did not particularly wish to have that conversation in the middle of the library. There was definitely something off with the Gryffindor—that much was evident—but why couldn’t Harry just be
“Sir?” Potter asked, turning to the Headmaster. “I didn’t think it was appropriate for students to drink alcohol.”
The Golden Boy was certainly not who Draco assumed he was and it startled the blond to no end. He was beginning to find that the brunet’s presence didn’t even annoy him anymore and where Draco had always been able to find something wrong with Potter’s appearance, there were now small details that Draco found... appealing.
Determination quickly replaced the optimism. “You bet your arse it is, Malfoy,” Potter replied.
Don’t even joke about that.
“Did he tell you this?”
“Try us,” Hermione prompted. “Ron and I are pretty open-minded, aren’t we, Ron?” She glared at the red-head whose eyebrows rose at the expression on the female’s face.
Malfoy quirked his head to the side, analysing his mate as a small simmer of curiosity began to burn within him. “Was there something in particular you wanted to talk about?” he found himself asking.
Malfoy thought viciously.
Draco’s lips curled into a predatory smirk.
“Harry, I heard you the first twelve times.”
“How are you?” Hermione asked.
Fuck, whatever this was, Harry absolutely thrived on it. It was familiar, antagonising, challenging, enjoyable,
“Because I’m fucking entitled to.”
Taking Draco’s earlobe between his teeth, Potter began to demonstrate the skills Draco had also been teaching him over the last week which soon had the blond barely able to gasp for breath.
“Obviously.”
“Promise?” Harry smiled hopefully.
Draco immediately blanched and withdrew the finger that had been pointing at Potter’s chest. Hand trembling slightly, the blond wrapped his arms around his stomach as a wave of unsettling insecurity crashed over him. His heart was thumping painfully in his chest as he forced himself to maintain eye contact with the brunet before him.
“If you can call it that.” Malfoy shook his head. “No it’s more of a payback thing considering this means we’re never getting married.”
“I don’t think he does,” Draco said in reply.
“No, please, spare my son!” Lucius begged.
“Same time tomorrow?”
Ron! Why would you think that?”
Ron gazed at the stalking boy. “Uh, Harry… have you thought that, maybe, this guy could be the one to break the curse?”
his subconscious murmured.
The blond stretched languidly against the carpet. “Why don’t we see where this takes us?” Malfoy continued, folding his hands beneath his head. “We have at least a week of privacy; we should use it before our snoops return.”
What else do you call a diary or journal? Especially on the internet… hmm, what did Dudley mention the other day? One of the girls he liked had a blog he wanted to see in the hope that he would have a chance with her…
Speech done, Snape marched to his desk. There was a brief moment of hesitation before students began moving, fetching ingredients and organising themselves into small groups around tables. Draco and Pansy waited until the Golden Trio had gathered their supplies and sat themselves back down at their desk before they headed to the storeroom. Both Draco and Pansy had silver cauldrons of their own so once they had collected the potion ingredients they needed, the two of them returned to their seats and began brewing the potion in solitary silence.
Reluctance to follow the young man coursed through Draco but the fear of Potter’s retribution forced him to move. He trailed after the brunet until he came to a stop at the end of the dank stone corridor, face-to-face with a section of brick wall. Draco frowned faintly before Potter suddenly spoke.
to Harry, we’ll be the first people to hunt him down.”
“Exactly.”
“Just wait until we get them,” Dean grinned. “Then I can show you.”
“No, I’m alright, thank you, Pans,” he replied.
“I’m sure there’s something else you’d like to see!” he gasped quickly.
A charming smile stretched across Draco’s face. “Perhaps you would like to direct me? I’m sure you know everything there is to know about the castle.”
“Alright fine,” Pansy said. “But so help me if you complain later about how I didn’t get you up to study.”

how Harry wished he could smack it off him.
“Irrelevant,” Hermione continued with a flourish of her hand. “Be the mature one, Ron, alright?”
“Well no but I didn’t ask you if you wanted a release,” Pansy smirked. “I’m sure Potter would love to help you with that.”
Harry blinked in surprise. “But… you were so impatient before. You said you wanted to know everything.”
“Perhaps I should say it more often?” Malfoy continued, tilting his head to the side. “I had figured these intimate moments between us were enough to convince you.”
“Please.”
.” He groaned, thrusting involuntarily as the Slytherin gripped him once more. His chest heaved, pants falling from his lips and he watched, following the skilful fingers as they unbuttoned and unzipped his pants, slipping inside to stroke teasingly at his cock through the material of his boxers. He had to compel the whimper back down his throat when Malfoy unexpectedly sucked on the pulse point on his neck. Instead, he tangled his fingers back into blond strands, forcing Draco’s mouth back to his own. He thrust his tongue into the Slytherin’s mouth, kissing him hungrily as the pressure on his cock grew until he was panting into Draco’s mouth.
“I always do,” Hermione smirked. “See you two at dinner.” Rushing ahead, she left the two males to make their way slowly back to the castle. Harry couldn’t actually remember when Hermione had been that excited to study. Maybe Malfoy was the challenge she’d been after all these years.
of dirt and grime.”
“Don’t tell me it was porn.”
? And here I thought it was your aspiration in life.”
Panting, Malfoy paused above Harry to gaze down at him. “Do you have any objections before we take this further?” the blond asked, cheeks flushed.
“That would be preferable.”
Narcissa’s warm hands came to rest on Draco’s cheeks, her reddened eyes watering once more and making the blue depths of her irises glisten. “Oh, Draco, no, I could not ask you to. We have no idea what might have happened—what dangers might be present!”
“You-Know-Who, Harry,” Eli pressed. “What was he like? Fearsome of course, but to have such power—”
He barely listened as the trio rattled off their coffee order, one of them ordering a blueberry muffin to which Draco caught a “You just ate breakfast, Ronald!”.
… Harry thought, glancing at his watch.
The female rolled her eyes with a gentle snort. “Fine,” she said, “but this isn’t over. You can pretend all you want that there is nothing wrong but get this—you’re not as good of a liar as you think you are.”
Once Draco had three fingers inside of Potter, who was flushed and panting beneath him by this time, he reached for the vial and poured what was left onto his own hardened, and utterly impatient, cock. His hissed through his teeth as the cool liquid landed on his sensitive skin, a tingle running up its length.
“But—”
“Can I though?” Potter wrinkled his nose.
“Er—Harry, I may be wrong… but I don’t really think that’s the best way to win this guy’s affection,” Ron interjected meekly.
“Fuck off, Malfoy,” Harry replied good-naturedly. “Although, I would be rather remiss to not question your own experiences seeing as you know that tactic so well.”
Hermione rolled her eyes but returned his smile. “Alright hurry up then.”
I have most of the OFFICIALLY last chapter written with just a few more scenes left to insert. Thank you to everyone for your amazing support! This has been fun to write :D
Draco chuckled. “Thank you for proving my point.”
“Hmm,” Potter agreed blissfully, quite content as he remained in Draco’s lap. He blinked slightly dazed eyes, a smirk curling at his mouth. “Well maybe not
“Don’t forget your manners, Draco.”
Harry shrugged, glancing at his best friend from across the Gryffindor table. “I had a look over the names of each house team. Malfoy’s wasn’t there.”
“I do believe he told you to run along, darling,” a smooth voice interrupted, “and I recommend that you do so… while you still retain whatever dignity you have left.”
Malfoy preened. “Naturally,” he said.
“I seem to have touched a nerve,” the blond hissed gleefully. “Tell me, Potter, how long have you and the Weasel been an item?”
you, you idiot!”
Grinning, Ron clapped Harry on the shoulder. “Well at least that’s all settled. Come on, mate, want a game of chess?”
“Good at this,” Potter admitted with a sigh.
“Thank you,” Potter said. “I really needed… to hear that.”
“No, I think the idea of Potter discovering I have potential feelings for him and announcing it to the school just to hurt me is humiliating,” Draco replied. “Why risk anyone getting close enough to know? It’s better to leave this entire mess alone.”
The blond left without another word, leaving Harry standing alone in the corridor just outside the Great Hall. The two of them had just left dinner and Harry was just thinking that he should probably head back to the Gryffindor tower to do some homework, when the Slytherin had mentioned the Potions essay to which Harry had admitted he hadn’t even started.
“Be quiet, Ron,” Hermione said. “We don’t know for sure yet. This might be temporary.”
“Can’t,” Ron replied with a shrug. “It’s not like we have stomachs anymore.”
Harry grinned, downing the last of his wine. As he replaced it on the table, the goblet refilled itself and Harry began to mentally count how many he’d had so far.
Harry grinned. “Guess it’ll have to be Thursday,” he continued.
“No—no, Draco, never,” Harry stammered. “I never thought—”
The corridor was filled with silence, something that was beginning to drive Draco insane. He felt as if he was going to be sick as he stared at the young man before him. Of all the confessions he could have shouted at the Gryffindor, his admission of love was the last he had expected to fall from his mouth. Draco was unable to ascertain how exactly the brunet was responding to this sudden news as the silence stretched into an agonising length. Then, just as Draco was about to lose his mind, the stillness was broken by Potter’s soft voice.
” he roared.
The Dark Lord felt an anticipated shiver course through him, a wicked smile curling at his lips. Oh yes, Draco would be his. Such a fine specimen of male would fit exquisitely by his side.
“Ugh, Seamus! That’s foul!”
With a groan, Draco came. Sticky warmth spread through his fingers, trapped within his palm and his undergarments. Panting, the blond withdrew his now come-coated hand, casting a quick cleansing charm over both himself and Harry. He tucked Potter’s now flaccid cock back into his boxers before lowering his head onto the brunet’s stomach, closing his eyes. From above, Harry drew in a steadying breath, a tentative hand coming to rest on the nape of Draco’s neck in a somewhat soothing manner.
“So Neville really is out of the question?”
“Are you sure?”
Draco swallowed, his jaw clenching. “Potter,” he bit out.
Potter’s jaw dropped. “I am not!” he replied, outraged.
“They will just have to be satisfied with me,” Malfoy replied bluntly.
“What does it do?”
Draco smirked, clicking onto Potter’s page.
Sweeping through the corridors, there was only one thing that was on Draco’s mind right now: how desperately he needed to talk to Harry. The hunger had grown to such a peak the blond felt physically shaken. His body refused to obey even the simplest of commands, especially if his mate was particularly close, and he had become overrun with an exhaustion so intense he could barely function.
Pansy exhaled in exasperation. “I am
The brunet shivered. “Stop saying my name. And no—I didn’t.”
“Reading,” the blond replied. “The textbooks Granger found have been most… illuminating.”
“I’m not
he is,” she remarked. “Typical.”
“Hey! I’m not as bad,” Ron protested.
Draco thought, keeping his gaze set firmly away from Potter’s. “Pansy is determined to find out exactly what our relationship is.”
“And you’re doing a good job,” Hermione sniffed from beside him. “I can’t believe how fast this flu has spread.”
“About time,” Hermione said with a sniff. “We do like to see your face you know.”
Hermione levelled a knowing look at the female. Parkinson cursed.
“Positive,” Harry replied, his gaze falling to the Slytherin’s lips. “Neither of us are saints and you’ve more than made up for your mistake. Truthfully, I’ve missed you.”
“I think—” the Gryffindor gasped as Draco bit down on his neck, “that maybe—
Draco barely had the energy to hum in agreement. The voice in his head telling him to do whatever it took to ensure Harry continued to like him had tormented him the entire time Pansy had been speaking with Granger. All Draco longed to do was embrace his mate, to make Harry
Knowing exactly what the female was doing, Potter chuckled again. “Do we have to do this right now? Draco looks like he’s about to murder you.”
“Except—” Harry narrowed his eyes. “What are you playing at, Parkinson?”
Harry couldn’t help it, he laughed. “Well, when you put it
“I’ll slice
” Hermione suddenly shrieked.
how Malfoy looked down there.
. And Draco was moaning, sobbing,
looked good. He knew it wasn’t his friends fault, he knew he should be more patient but in all honesty Draco really could care less. For the first time since Draco had started at Hogwarts, he was not at the top of his game.
“We best get a move on!” George announced. “Mione will have us for firewood if we’re late for breakfast!”
Hermione smiled kindly. “Relax, Harry, we’re not going to expose your secrets in the middle of the library.”
“Ah even better, I’m turning you into a Slytherin!”
“Sorry, we got a bit carried away,” Hermione replied, shifting a pile of notes off the table.
Harry slid into his seat and lowered his laptop bag to the floor. “What are you guys working on?” he asked.
“Charms,” Malfoy offered, sensing the Gryffindor’s confusion, “I apply charms on my skin daily. They work well enough if I am in the castle but they do not provide me protection from direct sunlight.”
Charlie?”
“Why did you come here,” the dark-haired snarled, eyes glowing wickedly.
Not like Malfoy.
. Seriously, I can’t believe you’ve kept this from both Ron and I.”
“Am I missing something here?” Ron asked with a confused frown as he looked between them.
“Oh... Sirius,” she sighed. It was amazingly detailed; Hermione could tell Harry had taken extra care with this particular illustration.
“Well… that’s a given.” Ron cleared his throat. “When’s his birthday?”
Draco’s eyes were pools of pure arousal, dark and glazed, as Harry looked up the length of his body, allowing the cock to slip from between his lips. The blond whimpered. He watched, transfixed, as Harry kept a sturdy pace with his finger while he moved back up towards him. Draco’s eyes fell to reddened and swollen lips.
Draco extinguished every last source of light and buried himself into his duvet. Shivers from his growing fever shook him restlessly and he absently thought about the potion Severus had instructed he take.
“How have the cravings been?”
Ron could feel anger beginning to bubble threateningly in his chest. It took every ounce of willpower he had not to march back up those stairs and demand Harry to tell him everything. If that blond prat had hurt his best friend, Ron was fully prepared to break a nose…
What he enjoyed the most however, was being able to forget where he was and who he was in favour of being someone else. Someone who was humorous and interesting, someone who didn’t need a mask twenty-four seven. Of course Draco loved being a snarky bastard, especially to those who annoyed him, yet there were times where he was glad he was able to friendly with someone, share opinions and be natural.
Draco shivered. The passion in Potter’s voice had definitely been stimulating to say the least but he was still amazed at the fact that
attached.
With a shuddering realisation, everything Harry had denied was suddenly thrust into a frightening light.
“Don’t worry, mate, we’ll work this out,” Ron promised, smiling gently.
Potter grinned brightly. “Afraid of ruining your reputation, Draco?”
the voice in his head growled.
of that fact, and now you’ve completely fucked up the one steady supply of blood you had. Congratulations, you fucking imbecile.” She breathed in through her nose deeply, nostrils flaring in anger. “You better fix this, Draco, or so help me. You fix it and you do it
Looking back, everything about Harry’s actions had been so stupid. He should have known that there would be more to this relationship stuff than just fooling around. At least Draco had enough gall to actually call him out on his shit.
... Harry thought with a grin as he watched his friends leave.
“No.”
“Then again maybe not,” Ron stammered, backing away.
Hermione was already there, leaning against one of the couches, her laptop open and resting on one of her hands and she typed with the other.
“Um, mate, you going to sit down any time soon?”
A flush crept up into Draco’s cheeks. “I still do,” he protested.
torn about the entire ordeal how was it that it was so easy for him to return to acting normally? Fuck, Harry almost did not want to give Malfoy the satisfaction of their relationship returning to normal so efficiently.
When lips enclosed around the head of his impatiently twitching cock, Harry threw his head back against the wall, a moan vibrating his throat. Draco’s mouth was so warm… so
Harry turned with a faint frown. The footsteps he’d thought he had heard proved non-existent when the corridor remained empty. Only the distant voices of passing students along perpendicular hallways reached his ears and he turned back with a shrug.
Harry could hear voices when he woke next. He shifted slightly, noticing the fresh smell of the Hospital Wing and the rasp of the typically rough sheets against his skin. Despite waking in the one place he despised, Harry was happy. The headache that had tormented him mercilessly was completely gone and he cheered silently, wondering what it was that Madam Pomfrey had done.
“Hmm?” Potter’s eyes widened in alarm. “No! I just—I was making a statement.”
“Because I bought myself one last summer.”
“Yeah…” Harry scratched his head. “But I’m not overly interested in France. Besides, I didn’t want to impose.”
“Harry, mate, you’re looking a bit peaky, you alright?”
“Most of the time they’re muggle,” Harry replied. “They don’t know who I am—it’s just easier. I’ve had a few flings with some wizards and while it’s nice to not have to hide my magic, it’s really fucking sad when you can tell they’re getting off purely because they’re buggering the Boy-Who-Lived.”
Draco was slightly touched by the concern in Potter’s voice. “My mother, yes. My father, however, has gone away on business so Mother has gone to visit relatives. Although I enjoy my mother’s company, I’d rather not have my cheeks pinched by over-the-top cousins and great-aunts.”
“You love class too much,” Harry retorted, cringing when his head thumped. “
“I’m lucky I wasn’t assigned with a Slytherin,” Ron retorted.
He leaned down, eyes on Harry’s lips. With a surge of confidence, Harry rose to meet him halfway; the shyness he usually felt was completely gone.
“I think you have some explaining to do,” Potter replied deadpanned.
Comments and Kudos very much appreciated! Xx
“Yeah but this year you’ll either have Malfoy or we can find you a better guy.” Ron frowned thoughtfully. “I’m pretty sure I remember Neville talking about someone in Ravenclaw who had just come out—maybe we can hook you two up!”
“Yes I know.” Pansy frowned. “Although I’d hoped that you’d cut him a break—”
The brunet shook himself from his thoughts, a wry grin spreading across his face as he neared the bed, loosening his school robes as Malfoy had done. “Sorry, I think Flitwick’s lesson did away with my brain.”
“Don’t hold your breath,” Draco replied wryly, returning to his laptop.
“Not really,” Harry retorted. “But you’re not going to give it up, are you?”
“Don’t know what he was expecting to happen by pretending to enjoy the same drink I do.”
, Draco’s mouth was so utterly perfect, tongue so delightfully talented, Harry simply craved more.
Ron’s face paled. “...and?” he asked meekly.
Hermione giggled. “No fangs.”
Draco’s eyes slid closed but he nodded just the same.
with—
Harry shrugged again. “Didn’t really want to stick around to hear the story to be honest.” Beside him, he heard Hermione sigh and he felt a warm hand come to rest on his arm.
“The Wolfsbane potion,” Hermione said. “You weren’t the only one to have some difficulty.”
Harry rolled his eyes playfully. “Why I’m attracted to you I’ll never know.”
“Er… alright,” Harry replied, glancing at Ron and frowning faintly. The two of them left the females all the same, Harry unable to stop himself from glancing back, rather dumbfounded at the calm way Hermione seemed to receive the other female.
“I’m pretty sure that’s world known news.”
Lucius’s screams echoed through the castle. The desolate building stood silently in response.
Quidditch practice?”
“I ask nicely, he refuses!” The brunet snarled, kicking an already partly destroyed chair across the scratched wooden floor. It struck the far stone wall with a satisfying
“How long ago was that? And it doesn’t matter; I’m sure I could buy a regular muggle digital camera and adjust it so it doesn’t explode near Hogwarts with all of the magic.” Harry chuckled humorously. “That would be pretty funny though.”
“I didn’t either,” Hermione agreed. “Until I saw it for myself. Malfoy is apparently one of the few Slytherins better acquainted with laptops.”
Harry groaned inwardly.
Harry spun around with a spark of nerves, eyes on the wood as the door swung open. When Draco did not appear, the impulsive nerves died away and his face darkened dramatically.
He how no clue what the hell he was going to do if his mate refused him.
Harry blushed, glancing away from her as he began to fiddle with the sleeve of his robe. “It’s
“Yes,” Harry whispered in reply, swallowing convulsively. “I thought sleeping would help.” His body trembled as he fought the growing nausea, hands gripping the duvet tightly. “J-Just got worse.”
Harry lifted his head, a frown tugging at his brow. “So?”
“Fuck me, Potter, you’re something else,” he groaned, allowing his head to fall back.
“Don’t think you’re getting out of pancake duty by acting all sweet, love.”
“No, it’s alright,” Harry finally answered, returning his gaze to the female. “Is this your way of getting Malfoy and I back to together?”
“Which leaves the cappuccino for you,” the blond murmured, fighting hard to keep his hand from trembled as his extended his arm. The brunet reached up to grab the mug, his fingers brushing along the back of Draco’s hand as he did so, causing a lovely tingle shoot up the blond’s arm.
“Let’s go check out Harry’s,” Ron suggested, “and mess it up so he has to come back to us.” The red head grinned evilly and rushed up the staircase.
Nott scoffed. “And it’s disgusting,” the young male responded angrily. “Potter doesn’t belong down here—he should be with his own house. Merlin knows why he’s desperate to hang around Slytherins.”
of that,” Voldemort growled. “Do not question me, Lucius!”
When Harry next checked his watch he was shocked to see it was already past midnight. He and Malfoy had been talking for
Once seated in the stands, Harry cast many more warming charms before opening his art book to his latest, but unfinished, drawing of the blond. It was Harry’s favourite so far and he took extra care as he continued. Malfoy’s eyes, for one, had to be absolutely perfect. They were Harry’s favourite quality, with the rare, brilliant smile the blond would flash to his closest friends close behind.
“Then follow me.”
Harry smiled reassuringly. “And she didn’t laugh,” he grinned. “She doesn’t believe me though; she doesn’t think you’d ever like her.”
She crossed the floor and perched herself on the edge of the bed.
“I was bored.” She pouted, coming to a halt beside Draco’s bed.
Harry frowned slightly as he realised he wasn’t sure if he liked the idea of Hermione hanging around Malfoy so much.
“Ron, shh!” Hermione hissed, nudging the boy beside her as he groaned. She turned expectant brown eyes to the headmaster as he began his speech.
The blond’s arms were wrapped tightly around his torso. “I don’t
A frown tugged at Draco’s brow when he saw the name of the blog his friend had reblogged it from.
“Shall we?” Harry grinned, gesturing across the snowy field.
Harry scowled. “Do I have too?”
“Oh, this one, definitely this one,” Fred said, pulling out a glorious set of black robes with silver fastenings and trim.
“Wait—what?”
With a final lingering press of lips to his, Malfoy drew back slowly, allowing only a few inches between them.
“He might have slept in,” Ron suggested. “He might be on his way down now.”
natural.”
Pansy snorted. “Is that all I get? I’m away for days at a time and all I get back is ‘
“Okay, okay,” Ron grumbled, appeasing Harry’s concern.
“Look, Ron...” Harry ran a hand through his head, wondering if he should tell his best mate. “I may have told Mione that you like her...”
“Oh! How about a tour?” Ron suggested with excitement.
I've decided to be nice and give you guys the next chapter ^_^ and in case there is any confusion, this story had already been written and I WILL be updating frequently! That I promise!
“The boy, my lord, will he—will his power diminish?” Lucius asked.
“Because it’s full, Ronalb.”
“Enough of this depressing talk,” Hermione chided, hopping up on the table top with a frown. “Here, Draco, have some soup, it’ll warm you up.” She nudged the bowl with her spout before asking Ron to push over the plate of bread.
“Relatively,” the red-head grinned. “God they’re so small—were we that small?”
yet.”
“I can’t imagine Potter welcoming me with open arms,” Draco replied morosely. “Hating each other was what Potter and I did best. It’s a little hard to overcome years of feeling such prominent frustration.”
“What are they used for?” Pansy questioned, looking down at the contraption in her arms. The first time she tried switching it on it had beeped loudly and almost blinded her. She had not expected the screen to glow as it did nor was she prepared to try again anytime soon no matter what the Professors said.
Draco felt his hunger surge.
“Aw come on, I want to know! Please, please,
**A/N**: This next section has been repeated on purpose.  I.e., the above was from Draco's perspective and the below is now from Harry's perspective.
categorise gays depending on your prejudices.”
“And yet you waited all this time,” Harry said with a smirk, tilting his head. “You do realise we could have been doing this months ago.”
“Because a blood-mate becomes the vampire’s life force; their bond is tremendously powerful. Once the connection is made, a vampire will only ever crave their mate.”
“We’ll give him the day,” Draco continued in a soothing murmur. “I realise the Dark Lord requested father to return this morning, however in the off chance that he has been delayed, I do not want to risk jeopardising his mission.” He pulled his mother into an embrace, encircling her thin frame with his arms. She leant against him wearily, a sigh escaping as her body finally began to relax. Nodding, she lifted her head, pulling back enough to gaze up at her son.
“Just think about it?” Pansy said.
“—when did this happen? Is that how you’ve been able to go so long without feeding from me?
“You were asking for it, Malfoy.”
me to do?
“This is amazing,” Harry breathed, scrolling through posts on another’s blog. “Why am I only finding this now?”
Harry swallowed, lowering his gaze to stare at the ground. “I know, Ron,” he whispered. “I know all of this. Why do you think I’ve wanted to avoid Malfoy? I’m still trying to work out whether what I feel for him is actually me… or the bond.”
The post make-out miasma was blathering praise. Harry willed his mouth to move. “Superb, exceptional, outstanding—nothing bad—
A faint headache was beginning to blossom behind Harry’s eyes as he sauntered down the corridor. He was already tired of assessments and they’d only been back at Hogwarts for a couple of weeks. If this was what N.E.W.T year was going to be like, he had no idea how he was going to survive.
He halted, briefly closing his eyes and willing for patience. Turning on his heel, Draco watching as Granger made her way briskly towards him. The look on her face confirmed what he assumed she was here for and he swallowed a groan, not in the mood to be discussing Potter with her this evening.
The bushy-haired brunette had been shocked to receive an intense letter during the holidays. The contents of said letter was nothing compared to the surprise she had felt at the sight of the sender, however. One Pansy Parkinson, someone who had never failed to tell Hermione exactly what she thought of her, had written to her asking for the Gryffindor’s help. After the first few lines had been filled with an elaborate apology, the Slytherin had described a series of events that, even now, still had Hermione’s head in a whirl. Parkinson had admitted that she knew Hermione would be the best person to help them, but understood if the Gryffindor was apprehensive to do so.
Harry stared. “Well… if it wasn’t the threat of cancer that turned you off being in the sun, why did you resign from the Quidditch team?”
With his eyes closed and head tilted back he worried not that he was in the middle of the pitch where anyone could be watching, instead his mind began to drift peacefully as he listened to the nightlife, focusing on the variation of sounds.
“It’s a nice laptop,” Harry commented.
? Your awesome best friend?!”
“About a week.”
“I wonder what he’s hiding up there,” the blond murmured.
“It’ll be good for them,” Harry said, “being kept out of the loop for a change.” The room was spinning sluggishly above him, the effects of the alcohol still as prominent as ever.
“Can I ask you something?” Harry said suddenly, lifting his gaze from his glass to stare at Malfoy.
“Mione,” Harry interrupted, “I love you, but my mind is barely focusing as it is without you going all lecturer on me.”
“Duties that your parents have fulfilled for you for the time being. However, I require… younger blood.”
Harry’s heart skipped a beat as he looked over at her. “But—I—how do you know?”
“Do you think Binn’s would notice if I didn’t go?” Ron said, thinking longingly of the warm Gryffindor common room.
The candelabra’s face fell slightly, but his smile remained, even if it did grow a little sad. “Years,” he admitted. “But that’s the thing with curses, isn’t it? Until they’re broken they can last a good long while.”
“As much as it pains me to admit, it is more practical to be on the floor,” the blond replied, waving his hand over the textbooks and parchment that were spread neatly before him. “There is simply not enough space anywhere else.”
“Shh! Don’t laugh.”
“Don’t you start with me, Potter.”
Harry spluttered in surprise. “Er—only a little while now. Did Pansy tell you?”
McGonagall’s eyes sharpened. “I requested no such thing. Be on your way, Mr Malfoy, you look in need of a good bed,” she said, started in the opposite direction down the corridor.
“That didn’t go very well at all,” Hermione commented wretchedly.
was Harry’s first thought as he woke. His head turned sharply to the side; eyes falling on a sleeping Malfoy as memories came flooding back.
“Well, yes but we’re not exactly best friends at the moment. I wouldn’t have blamed you if you’d gotten offended at my question,” Potter replied carefully.
“You guys should rest now, I’ll be around if you need me,” Harry said gently.
The sun filtered in through the slightly parted curtains and landed directly over Harry’s eyes. As he woke, the headache he’d hoped would disappear flared into life and he cringed instinctively.
“What is it you’re not telling me, mate?” Ron pressed.
“What does it look like I’m doing, Draco?” the older man scoffed. “I do believe it is called ‘
The room was quiet as Pansy eyed him carefully. “Are you sure?” she asked after a moment.
“I wouldn’t expect anything less,” Draco replied. “I’m sure Pansy would kill us both if we hid it from her.”
“So, how are things between you?” she asked. “Is he treating you well?”
“Y-Yeah I know, I mean—um—why?”
“Yeah, he probably will,” Pansy agreed. “But hopefully only for a little while.”
Harry nodded determinedly and knocked.
“Oh shut up, Mione,” the boys said unison.
“You stop that right now,” he snapped. “I don’t need you feeling sorry for me because my hormones are on the fritz; I’ll be fine.”
“Really?” Harry asked in surprise.
All the breath seemed to expel from Harry’s lungs, staring as Malfoy stalked away. His heart was absolutely thundering; it had taken his entire strength of will to utter those words.
Potter chuckled softly. “No, she likes you as a friend. Since you and her became study partners not even Ron can make any negative remarks about you.”
“Do you love him.”
Harry’s friends immediately turned to him, their anger and concern evident on their faces.
“How very original of you, Weasley,” he spat. “
“Well there’s your problem, Potter, you were with a
“I don’t trust myself to be a top,” Potter replied honestly, removing his top and letting it flop to the floor.
On the bed, Harry’s hand suddenly twitched. Draco’s full attention was immediately back on his mate, face stricken.
Draco’s subconscious said smugly.
Hermione raised her eyebrows and turned her stare to Ron who was staring bemusedly at the magically surmounted grey clouds that hung overhead as he chewed his food. At the sound of his name he looked over blearily.
“See what happens when you extend your social circle?” Harry teased.
Draco couldn’t help the look of bewilderment he gave his mate and was even more surprised to note how at ease Harry appeared in response. Here his mate was, lying in the hospital wing with Draco Malfoy standing by his bedside, and the brunet’s emotions were so calm… so acquiescent. Not only was it entirely Draco’s fault that Harry was here in the first place, but the blond had put his mate in serious danger only moments after achieving Harry’s acceptance of his condition.
“Anything you’re not.”
“I don’t know what it more pitiful,” Malfoy said with a disapproving glare, “your ridiculous opinions or the fact that I agree with Weasley. Now get the fuck out of my sight before a particularly nasty spell finds its way up your arse.”
“Okay, yes I would but it’s not going to happen,” Hermione said.
“Just Cho Chang during fifth year,” Harry replied. “She didn’t really make it easy though—she was already upset over Cedric. We only kissed… but it didn’t feel right. Needless to say nothing ever came of it.” He bit his lip, glancing shyly at the boy next to him. “Considering our conversation has taken a personal turn, do you mind if I ask you something?”
With a shuddered breath, Harry allowed his body to fall limp against the cold stone wall. His legs were trembling with the effort of keeping him standing so he allowed himself to slide, falling down to the ground and drawing his knees to his chest. He sucked in a breath.
, the brunet’s cock fell from the Slytherin’s sinful mouth and onto his stomach, satisfied and sated. Draco was still working his own burning cock with his fist and he swung his gaze up to Harry’s form lying so wantonly. The boy lay with his eyes closed, chest rising and falling erratically; there was something so debauched about the Gryffindor lying in his dishevelled uniform, cock only free through the gap in his trousers.
With his growing strength, it took Draco a minute to realise that Harry had gone limp in his arms. He stilled, fangs withdrawing from his mate’s neck as he took a moment to compose himself; his body was humming with Harry’s blood and the fresh wave of power nearly sent him reeling. The more aware he became of his surroundings, the more he realised that Harry was no longer responsive.
He had honestly missed this, relaxing with his friends and not worrying about anything else.
“Most men are I’m afraid.”
Interest immediately blossomed in the Gryffindor’s green eyes and he stared at the male above him with unhidden lust.
… and that meant giving Harry the space he needed in order to make a proper decision.
” she sang.
“You followed me?”
The room fell silent as the two of them sat and considered what to do next. Ron looked up at the boys staircase, wondering how he was going to approach the subject with his best mate. After all, this was all new ground for the two of them. They barely spoke about girlfriends let alone boyfriends, and neither of them had ever had a problem like this… least of all anything to do with Malfoy…
Harry leapt back in surprise, a choked gasp escaping his mouth as he gawked at the Slytherin in shock. His feet moved backwards until he felt his back press up against the cold stones of the corridor wall, terror spiking as he took in the blond’s startling appearance. Malfoy’s eyes were ablaze, glowing eerily as he stared hungrily at the Gryffindor. His fangs were lowered, giving him such a feral appearance Harry felt his heart skip a beat. They glinted in the firelight of the hanging wall torches, sleek and sharp and deadly.
Rolling on his back, Harry sighed.
Ron and Percy spun around, jaws slack, in time to see a tall blond male sweep passed the doorway.
Draco blanched.
