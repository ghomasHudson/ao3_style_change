"I hardly did anything," Draco protested. "Kingsley's a good man. Oliver too, for that matter. What made the biggest difference was what you said to them in Moscow. They'd obviously talked about it quite a bit since then, and I think they were feeling bad that things had got to that stage. They wanted to help - they just hadn't thought of a way to do it."
"Well, it can’t hurt, I don’t think," said Harry. "It would have to be official, though – you’d have to make it clear that you were working with me."
Harry felt a stab of panic from Draco, and quashed the response he'd been about to give. "Don't worry, we'll be fine," he said instead. Draco's look of relief was intriguing, and Harry hoped that the trip to Malfoy Manor would explain it. The first order of business, though, was to work out how to get off the bed.
"Right," said Draco. "So in the past month you've been to six continents - every continent except Antartica, in fact. Tell me, have you been on holiday for the last month, or have you continued doing your job?"
Really?" Draco quickly entered the journey into his computer to check. "Good grief, you're right: it does say that. I agree, that
"It feels wrong every time I say it, but she insists, so I just have to grin and bear it," Harry confided. "And Padma and Seamus are both on the staff."
Ron looked thoughtful. "It seems all wrong for that to happen to Lucius Malfoy. I never liked the guy, but I wouldn't wish this on him," he said. "And your mum always seemed like a nice enough lady. And of course she saved Harry's life, didn't she? I'm sorry, Draco. Let us know if there's anything we can do."
Ginny's jaw dropped, but before she could speak Harry stood up, pulling Draco with him. "I think our business here is done," he said, and Apparated them back to the Manor.
A week later, the eighth-years had settled into a comfortable but intense routine. The professors, rather than easing them back into their studies gradually, seemed to be adopting the strategy of giving them as much work as possible, and the eighth-years were spending most of their free time either studying in their rooms, or in the library.
Harry thought about this for a moment. "It'd be nice to be able to walk round the lake in peace," he said. "I haven't tried to go there yet."
"Don't be silly, there's nothing to apologise for," said Harry. "I've already said I'll tell you what happened, and in any case you can't be expected to predict every single tenuous connection my mind might choose to make. In fact, it's probably just as well it
"When I first found you'd gone to Novaya Zemlya, I wanted to know everything about it. And one of the first facts I looked up was how far it was from London. I found that the bit where you were was almost exactly two thousand miles away. And since I already knew it was covered in snow, I couldn't help thinking of this song."
"Well, it was bloody impressive," said Harry. "I could hear all the admiring comments people were making, and I wanted to rush up to them all and say 'he's my BOYFRIEND!'"
"I'm not sure where my school scarf is," he commented. "Haven't seen it in a while. Did you wear that specially for me?"
Draco laughed too. "I hope the fairy lights are accentuating my best features," he said. "Although maybe it's best if I don't know. But seriously, Potter, what on earth do you think goes on in gay clubs?"
Half an hour later they were sitting at the dining table in Draco’s apartment, finishing the last of their leek and potato soup. The table was next to the window, and the night-time view over the city was spectacular. The glorious sunset which had been lighting up the sky before they went skating had been replaced by a dark, starry night, and they were high enough above the ground that the stars weren’t completely obliterated by the neon lights below. The Christmas lights now adorning the apartment were creating some competition, however: Harry had put them up while Draco was preparing the soup.
. I had an owl from Ginny, and I suppose it's unsettled me a bit. I was feeling quite positive this morning, but now..." He shrugged his shoulders.
"It'll be back in a few minutes," said Draco, wriggling slightly to increase the delicious sensation.
"All done," said Draco, jerking Harry out of his semi-stupor. "And I don’t know whether you’ll think this is good news or bad news, but you’re definitely not under any curse I’ve ever encountered before."
" sang the radio. Harry wrapped his arms more tightly around Draco and finally gave into the temptation to kiss him properly.
"I carried a watermelon," said Draco's mouth, with very little input from his brain; this made him laugh even more.
"He keeps in quite close contact with his Beauxbatons counterpart, I believe; I imagine your name must have come up in conversation. Anyway, as I told you earlier, Harry arrived yesterday with the students, and will be here for the first two weeks of term, but will leave for his trip after lessons end on Friday the thirteenth of September. If you were to arrive on the morning of Saturday the fourteenth, that would be most convenient: that way, the house-elves could be sure that the rooms were ready for your use, and you could have the weekend to get acclimatised to the school before starting teaching on the Monday morning. We'll need you until Friday the twenty-seventh, but you'd have to leave that evening because Harry will be back on the Saturday morning. How does all that sound?"
He was very impressed with the effect of his actions on Harry, and considered continuing them for a while, but his attention was drawn back to the fairy lights, which led around to the front of Harry's body. Draco remembered how thoroughly they were wrapped around Harry's cock and balls, and grinned as he moved round to investigate. He was very tempted to do more licking, but realised that his barely-there kisses were driving Harry wild, so he continued removing lights and pressing his lips very lightly to a succession of tiny patches of skin. Sure enough, he was only halfway up Harry's cock when Harry came.
force people to have any sort of sexual relationship. The physical effects we've already showed you are the limit of the spell's influence. So you can take all the time you need to decide what you want to do about sex."
His immediate concern was that he and Harry hadn't made specific arrangements for their next meeting; Harry knew that Draco had no way of contacting him other than face to face, but was Harry expecting him to just turn up, or would Harry come back to Wallington? And at what time? And would it be awkward?
"It's fine, don't worry," said Ginny. "Dean and I haven't had him for ages, it'll be fun. And it's not your fault they've suddenly decided to call you all in for a raid. Ron's quite excited, by the way."
"Draco," Ron agreed. "Well, I have to admit that he does seem to be a bit better than he used to be. So maybe it won't all end in tears. But it goes without saying, Draco, that if you hurt Harry then I will... You know what? I'll set Hermione on you."
"It's quick, though, and I'm tired," said Harry. "I'll sort it properly tomorrow, but I can hardly keep my eyes open now. You've just reminded me of something, though. I always think of you as 'Malfoy', but I call all the other eighth-years by their first names, so I think it'd make sense for me to try calling you 'Draco', if that's OK? And maybe you could try calling me 'Harry'?"
(which they were each surprised to find the other was a fan of) to a bizarre Christmas tree Draco had seen in Italy, consisting of dozens of illuminated wine bottles.
"I suppose so, yes," said Draco. "But there hasn't been anything to make me reconsider, so I haven't really thought about it. I just knew I wanted to get out, all those years ago, and I've been happier since. I still use magic, but I don't have to deal with the whole of the magical world hating me. It's a good compromise."
After a moment, Hermione spoke. "That... makes a lot of sense, actually. But I still can't see how to fix it." Harry and Ron nodded.
are. You look terrible. If you don't want to talk about it yet, I can understand that, but I'm here and I want to help however I can."
"In that case, it is my pleasure," Draco assured him. "So... I know they're still together, but are they happy? I do hope so."
– confusion too. Draco saw him start worrying his lower lip and couldn't help smiling, at which Harry smiled too, and appeared to relax considerably.
"I don't actually drink very often," said Draco. "A glass of wine with dinner if I'm eating with my parents, but that's mainly because they expect it. I don't have wine if I'm on my own. Apart from that, I just have the occasional Firewhiskey. But right now I have a craving for a Butterbeer, and I don't think I've had one of those since I was at school. Odd."
Short but (hopefully) sweet tonight. More tomorrow. (Today was the day I was most likely to fail the challenge, so I'm quite proud I didn't!)
But Ginny had never said anything, he reminded himself, and she didn't seem unhappy... He gave himself a mental shake. Everything would be sorted out over the next two weeks. It would be fine.
as if you were. You wouldn't have to be near him all the time, and you wouldn't be aware of his feelings."
of them?" asked Harry, standing up and carefully removing Draco's jumper. He felt his face redden at the thought of Draco's hands on his body; his cock had already been at half-mast for most of the week due to the constant glimpses of Draco dressing or undressing. This had surprised him the first time he'd noticed it, but it had become a regular enough occurrence that he'd been forced to admit to himself that he was extremely attracted to Draco. He'd managed to keep this fact hidden so far – at least, he hoped he had – but he wasn't at all sure what Draco's reaction would be if he found out, and he hadn't dared mention it. He suspected that if he had to strip naked in front of Draco, though, his roommate would
by a curse. You know, like in the Gringotts vaults where they protect stuff with the Gemino Curse. Once the curse has been triggered, how do you know which is the
"OK then. Right. That's... good. Really good," said Harry, feeling suddenly exhausted. "So... what is it, then?"
Draco nodded. "I notice you've not mentioned his sister, though," he said, carefully. "I'm curious – are you still with her? If you don't mind me asking, of course."
"I think she's changed too, actually," said Harry thoughtfully. "And I'm not sure why. Although, I suppose, just like she doesn't know what we went through last year, we don't really know what
"That's the wisest thing you've said in ages," Draco told him. "It's a deal. And also, just because I realise I haven't said it in a while, I love you too. More than anything. Now, have we got time to get a burger before the film starts?"
been limitless, I didn't want to feel that I was dependent on it. And it isn't limitless, especially after the war fines. It hasn't run out yet, but my parents are definitely being thriftier these days, and I didn't want them to have to support me."
Getting undressed was, unsurprisingly, a bit of a struggle while they were holding hands, but they managed eventually. Harry tried not to stare at Draco's cock, but he couldn't help noticing that it was as hard as his own.
"Not quite, but Room 3 will be empty in a few minutes, they tell me. So there's no rush," Draco told her. "Have a seat and get your breath back. And thanks for doing this - I really appreciate it."
finally make clear to him exactly who all the characters were, he went quiet for a few minutes, and then he hugged me and said 'Dad, I wish you hadn't had such a horrible time when you were younger. But I'm glad things are better for you now.'" Draco had a tear in his eye, which Harry decided not to notice.
"That's truly terrible," said Harry. "You're welcome to win all the cracker pulls if that's the standard of jokes in them. I think you should wear the hat, though."
Harry grinned impishly. "That could be arranged," he said, hooking a thumb into the waistband of his boxer briefs - the only thing he was wearing apart from a Santa hat at a jaunty angle. "Actually I was just about to get changed when I heard your voice. Draco's almost ready - I was waiting until he'd finished in the bathroom."
thoughts about Draco were not about the man's manner, however. All Harry could think about was that Draco was
You may kill me for stopping where I've stopped today – sorry! I promise they'll continue very soon, though :p
Harry leaned forward, slightly amazed at his own daring, and gave Draco a quick peck on the lips before stepping back to look at him hesitantly.
Draco smiled; he actually looked a little shy, which was not a look Harry would ever have expected to see on him. "I... don't know what to say to that," he said. "Other than that I'll be kind of happy if that turns out to be the case."
"Ah, Duolingo, probably," said Draco. "I use that too. it's really useful. But, yes, I only did one song in German, you're correct.
"Speaking of which, no time like the present," said Hermione. "Shall we give it a try?" She stood up and moved towards the door, and Draco and Ron joined her.
not stupid," said Draco, turning his head to look at Harry. "But I promise I'll tell you if I can see any problems with it, and I'll help you find a way round them, if you want me to. So, go on. What's the idea?"
he thought. He raised the fingers of both hands to his face and sniffed them. The scent of roses filled his nostrils, to his relief.
go badly, I promise we'll Apparate straight out of there, and not try it again without a rethink. But I honestly think it'll be fine. Tell you what, though: I think if Ron and Hermione were with us, it would make it even clearer that you're one of the good guys now."
be one advantage of employing Harry Bloody Potter," he pointed out. "Although it might have slightly less effect on the Muggles."
Lucius and Narcissa had already installed themselves in their armchairs by the window, so Draco summoned an elf to keep an eye on them, before leading Harry and Hermione out of the front door. The grounds were very pleasant to walk through: although most of the leaves on the trees and the ground were brown, there were enough green ones to make an eye-catching two-tone pattern. There were also all sorts of different flowers of various shades of gold, brown and orange, and they smelled amazing. Harry didn't know what any of them were called, but decided that what he liked best was the combination of all of them, so it didn't really matter.
"There’s no evidence that they do – it seems likely that any ill effects are caused by the recipient’s fear. But that fear can be quite extreme. In Italy, people have believed in curses for centuries, and Hermione is right: 'sia maledetto' just means 'may he be cursed'. Maybe the actual curse – if indeed the guy
the curse," said Harry, turning round. "For either of them. The goblin was OK – that waterfall thing in the bank removed the curse from him. But the last thing I did with that Death Eater was to tell him to hide. I didn't give him a moment's thought again until months afterwards, when I saw his name on a list of casualties from the Battle of Hogwarts. I even saw him at the battle, and it didn't occur to me that I still had him under Imperius. I have no idea whether or not it had worn off or been removed before he died. I assume
"He is," agreed Harry. "And he's decided he wants to take you to bed. Right now. He wants to know if you'd be OK with that?"
Seeing Draco in the pub was a first, though, but Harry resolved to investigate this another time; he exchanged a nod with Draco and headed for the gaggle of women at the back of the bar.
me," he explained, as if this was perfectly obvious. "So I can go and visit them with my invisibility cloak!" He headed for the door once more.
"Don't misunderstand, I really want to get you naked," said Harry. "But I've just discovered that me being nearly naked while you're almost fully clothed is a
Draco smiled. "Well, it is one of their favourites to dance to, but... yes, it did occur to me that it might be quite fitting tonight," he admitted. "I just need to do one more, if that's OK, and then they'll be tired enough to go up to bed."
His thoughts were interrupted by the return of Potter, who was now bundled up in jeans and a black fleece, with a green scarf wrapped round his neck.
Draco blinked several times, and then considered his mental map of the place where he'd lived for almost five years. "Merlin. Now that I think about it, it really does, doesn't it? How on earth did I not notice that before?" He giggled.
Ron pursed his lips. "Let's see... could that massive issue be anything to do with your career, or lack of it? ... What? I've told you before - I'm surprisingly observant."
Harry grinned. "I'll try to come up with something better when I decide to chat you up properly," he said. "You'll be so surprised, you won't think of saying no."
"Not really," said Draco. "But... well, that's where my parents spend most of their time these days. We closed up the drawing room after the war – none of us wanted to go in there ever again – and we did consider creating a new drawing room, but the ballroom has the best view over the grounds of anywhere in the house, so we started having tea in there, and now we use it all the time."
He'd had every intention of going to see Harry at lunchtime – the memory of the man's bare torso had made him smile to himself more than once during the morning – but, by the time he'd put away the materials from his morning lessons and got out the necessary items for his afternoon lessons, he realised that he only just had time to actually
Harry nodded. "Anyway, you're right about the darkness," he said. "I've become fascinated by astronomy in the last few years, but it's hard to see anything in London with all the light pollution. It's a lot better at The Burrow – that's where I started noticing the stars in the first place. But for a while now I've wanted to spend a few nights somewhere
The corners of her mouth twitched. Draco stared at her, dismayed, and then sagged. "You really think he'll listen?"
"What time d'you have to be at work next?" asked Harry breathlessly, running his fingers through Draco's hair.
"It seems to me that you two would enjoy spending a few hours updating each other, now that you're actually on speaking terms," said Lucius. "But we would also welcome the opportunity to get to know Teddy."
"I feel much better – I think all the painkillers must have kicked in," she said. "I really thought I was dying while I was on the pavement, though. It was worse than Crucio. I feel a bit pathetic to find there's nothing life-threatening and I'm just a wuss."
He was woken some time later by a delightful sensation. He opened his eyes, and found that the winter sun was high in the sky above him, but Harry was no longer next to him. Harry was, in fact, the cause of the delightful sensation, because it seemed he had decided to wake Draco with a blowjob. Draco reached down and ran his fingers through Harry's hair by way of greeting, to which Harry responded by tightening his lips. Draco groaned and threw his head back, as he was assaulted by waves of pleasure.
Draco was alarmed. He formulated and dismissed several possible responses before deciding to go with: "Well, you've got three great kids, and as far as I can tell they all love you both very much. I don't believe kids should be the
This caused Harry to collapse in giggles on the sofa, and Draco watched him, greatly relieved that Harry's mood had improved and hesitant to say anything else for fear of spoiling it. He rewarded himself for cheering Harry up by staring at the muscular thigh which had been revealed when Harry's impact on the sofa had twisted the towel.
"I was about to ask what they do, but I realise you need to get away," said Draco. "So yes, please, I would like to accompany you if you're sure they won't mind, but on the condition that we don't stay
Draco's curiosity got the better of him, and he edged closer, to see that there was a woman lying on the pavement, being tended to by paramedics.
"That's a useful spell," Draco commented. "I'd forgotten it existed. Trust you to be able to do it wandlessly."
Draco laughed shakily. "If I was at Beauxbatons I'd be fine. But being a supply teacher is just like being a new teacher all over again. No, actually, it's worse, because at least if you're a new
perfect'," said Draco, as the applause from that song died down. "Well, anyone who knows him knows that although none of us are perfect, Harry comes closer to it than most. But of course there are always going to be darker times, and problems to be overcome - my history with Harry is full of those, and although I'm confident history won't repeat itself, I'd like to think that if it did then we'd get through it together. This beautiful song is for those moments. It's by a group called REM and it's called 'Everybody Hurts'." Rabia had already started playing the arpeggiated figure very quietly, and with these words she increased the volume as Draco started to sing.
"That makes sense," said Harry. "But, just so you know... I think falling in love is definitely going to be an option. Especially if Cole Porter carries on being such an enabler."
"I hope you're not in that mood right now, though? said Harry worriedly. "You'd tell me if I was irritating you, wouldn't you?"
"Yeah, sorry about that," said Seamus. "The kids had lots of really good ideas, and one of them was a way to spell out a message, so they wanted to know what message to use, and they were so excited that I didn't have the heart to tell them you wouldn't want a message, and that one seemed the most appropriate. It didn't spoil it too much, did it?"
Harry turned Draco's head towards him and kissed him. "I was so hoping you'd say that," he said, relieved. "I definitely want to try both ways, but that'd be a big help. You really wouldn't mind?"
been perfect so far, so yes, I'd like to make sure that our first shag is too. I did consider for a moment suggesting that I could top, because I'm not as big as you, and you…"
"Oh, stop it," said Harry. "I admit I'm still a bit freaked out by the whole thing, but that doesn't mean you should keep apologising. Who knows? Maybe we'll turn out to be a perfect match!"
McGonagall, however, raised her eyebrows. "Do go on, Potter," she said. "I'm always interested to hear your thoughts."
"I'm not stupid, Dad. It's pretty obvious when you go into a room and the people in it are in the middle of a conversation, and you two
tell people soon," said Harry, giving in. "Really soon. I just don't want it to get mixed up with all the divorce stuff. I'd hate it if people tried to blame Draco for that, when in fact none of happened until Ginny and I had already agreed to split up. Draco and I hadn't spoken to each other in twenty years, before last Saturday."
"Get dressed before you freeze to death," said Harry, after he read this. He cast a wandless warming charm over Draco just to be on the safe side. "And don't worry. It was the old Malfoy that did all those bad things, and they will know that I wouldn't be with you unless you'd changed. They are good people and they will give you the chance to show them what sort of a person you are
Harry digested this while Draco took the biscuits out of the oven and put them on the worktop to cool. "I want to fix this," he announced, after a minute. "I want to take you shopping and glare at anyone who looks at you even slightly the wrong way."
"Bloody hell," said Harry, and then winced when he realised he'd said that out loud. It was Draco Malfoy.
"I can't stop picturing the row of dead bodies along the middle of the floor," admitted Hermione. "So many times during the summer, I couldn't sleep, and that image was what always kept me awake."
The others all sat up expectantly, and Draco grinned. “I thought you were going to ask something really difficult then!” he said. “Yes, of course. I need to practise for tomorrow anyway – I’ll save those songs for you to hear then, but I can definitely sing you a different song now as a warmup. Any requests?”
"Well, yes, but he was still right about the Imperius curse, wasn't he? And the others. I've never forgotten that lesson, and I bet you haven't either. Especially as you played more of a starring role in it than I did."
Hermione buy you some? She has good taste, though, I must admit. You look much better than you used to. And I
"It is, sorry, but there are other good ones still to come," said Draco. "In more ways than one. Oh, dear. Sorry. I'm not usually that corny."
"Shush, you," said Harry, but his eyes had started to regain their usual twinkle. "Hey, Ted, look who's come to see you!"
Draco looked as if he was about to cry. "Maybe a different sort of overwhelmed. A good sort," he said. "Thank you. That means a lot to me."
," said Harry. "Let's go for a walk, and I'll tell you why. I need to walk off some of that food. Which was lovely, by the way. Thank you."
"It will," said Harry. "But we'll talk more tomorrow. We'd better get to Ron's house before he gets himself all worked up again. Are you ready, Draco?"
"Well, you did," said Harry, beaming. Then he had a thought. "Hey, don't take this the wrong way, but... will it always feel this good? I mean, when the bond's faded a bit? I know you said it doesn't force us to do anything sexually. But does it enhance the experience at all?"
"I never used to be able to do a Patronus," Draco said. "I tried and tried when I was at school, but I could never even get any smoke to appear."
Harry found that his eyes had filled with tears. "Hang on a sec," he said roughly, and stopped to steady himself. He leant his head back against a wall, noticing (somewhat incongruously) that this corridor was almost as decorated as the foyer had been: there was not quite as much glitter, but there were various sprigs of holly and paper chains, and even a small yule log in one of the window alcoves.
"But you must have known what one was, at least? Before you got married, I mean?" asked Draco, tucking Harry's head back into the crook of his neck.
Harry was silent for a couple of minutes, and Draco sipped his coffee, waiting for him to process his thoughts.
"Bloody kids," he said with a sigh. "Third-years, to be exact. The rest were all OK, actually, but that lot I had last lesson..." He sighed again.
Oliver had the grace to blush. "You're very perceptive," he said. "I apologise. You're quite right, I should have treated you both the same way. I do really appreciate you being here -
"This is all very interesting," said Granger, "and I do want to hear more about what you've done since we last saw you, but we've not yet got to the reason why we came today, so do you mind if we bring the conversation back to Harry? And also, I'm just wondering – have you ever tried the Animagus reversal spell on Spike?"
Harry smiled. "Why WOULDN'T I be? Since we started talking last week, I feel as if a weight's been lifted off my shoulders. I know we haven't solved all my problems yet, but there are quite a few that I hadn't even realised
"Well, in the middle," said Draco. "I told you, I've never shared it with anyone before. And it's not as if we can sleep separately anyway. The more important question is: do you want to be the big spoon or the little spoon?"
"It’s hard not to in Manchester," said Draco. "The place is football-mad. It’s always on TVs in bars, and it’s hard not to get at least a bit excited if you’re in a bar when United score, and everyone just goes wild. After a while I became fascinated enough to watch it on TV at home, and from there it was a small step to going to games."
Harry had shivered deliciously as Draco's fingers brushed his nipples. "Don't apologise, I'm loving it," he said. "I hope that's not all the nipple measurements?"
Draco stood up, intrigued. "I'm not usually a fan of surprises," he warned. "It had better be a good one. But yes, I know the site well enough to get there on my own."
Monday mornings were always the busiest time of the week at the ticket office. Nowhere near as busy these days as before Oyster cards came in, of course, but there were still people who chose to buy 7 Day Travelcards, and most of them renewed their tickets on a Monday on the way to work; this being also the first Monday of the month, there were monthly Travelcard renewals as well (these didn't
"I was thinking that you and I could both go in together at first, so that he can see that we’re comfortable with each other. Then I’ll tell him the truth – that you want to ask him about something unrelated, but that you’d also like to know about the explosion if he feels he can tell you. I’ll explain that, if he prefers, he can talk to you alone, but he needs to understand that the conversation will still be recorded so that Ron and I can see and hear it afterwards. How does that sound?"
The plan was for this to be the last part, but I'm not quite there and I can't stay awake any longer! So there will be one more part tomorrow.
sounds German, and you only sang one in German, didn't you? That was the last but one song. With all the notes."
Draco took a deep breath. "Just don't tell anyone about this, please, Harry," he said. "And please don't laugh."
"Well, no," Harry admitted. "He's her assistant, and they've worked together for years. She said she didn't actually set out to be unfaithful, but when I started sleeping at Hogwarts most nights she ended up staying later at work, and then going out for drinks with her workmates. It developed from there. Anyway, she spends most nights at his house, it seems – she said it would have felt wrong to sleep with him in our bed, so she never brought him back here – and that's where she was last night. And they're going to the Quidditch camp together, so it's not surprising she didn't want me there."
need to sleep. Also, I don't like leaving my cat alone overnight. But I promise I'll be at the hospital for nine o'clock. And we can continue our conversation after that."
"You could say that," said Draco. "And I must admit that I’ve occasionally quizzed Hermione a little bit when Rita Skeeter didn’t include enough details for my liking."
A bit of kissing and a lot of stargazing in this chapter. But don't worry, they'll get back to the kissing soon!
"Salt and vinegar on one, just salt on the other," said the man, and Draco watched as Liz put two pieces of fish into two separate polystyrene containers, added what seemed like a ridiculous number of chips to each, shook salt and vinegar liberally over them as directed, and closed the containers. "Wrapped or for now?" she asked. "Wrapped, please," said the man, at which Liz wrapped both containers in newspaper, put them into a plastic carrier bag and handed it over. "That'll be eight pounds, please, love," she said.
"You know what I'm going to ask next, don't you?" said Draco, sitting next to Harry, who nodded. "How on earth did you get an electric kettle to work inside Hogwarts?"
"Of course," said Harry. "They obviously make each other very happy, which is all I'm bothered about." Draco nodded his agreement.
has been a huge help. But seeing you in person today is really good - firecalls aren't quite the same. I'm sorry I haven't had time to come over yet."
It was almost midnight before Draco put his books away and stood up. "I don't know about you, but I'm shattered," he announced, stretching. He hoped he wasn't misunderstanding the reason why Harry's eyes grew wider when he did so. "Are you sure you'll be able to sleep on the sofa? It doesn't look long enough to be comfortable."
"We've often wondered whether the badger is because he's a Hufflepuff, or whether he would have had a badger even if he'd been in a different house," commented Harry. "I don't suppose there's any way we'll ever know."
. He tried to pull you out of the way, but he wasn't quite fast enough, and the spell hit both of you."
Teddy, who was apparently engrossed in watching a series of approximate-looking balloon animals being created on the far side of the room, whirled round at this. His hair started to turn ginger at the sight of Ginny, causing Harry to cast a panicked nonverbal spell before anyone noticed.
"I think I like it too," Harry told him. "In fact, I'll be honest, I think I've actually got a bit of an exhibitionist kink. The fact that you're both staring at my junk is making me surprisingly hard."
Sure enough, Teddy's hair had turned the same pale blond shade as Draco's. Draco smiled. "Come on, Teddy," he said. "I'll help you draw the poo if you like."
"Good, I like a bit of excitement," Neville said, reaching for a croissant. "Speaking of which, who d'you think'll win the match today? It pains me to say it, but my money's on Slytherin."
Draco laughed. "I think that might be the nicest thing you've ever said to me," he said. "But seriously, thank you. Both of you."
Harry raised his eyebrows. "I'm not convinced you could ever include yourself in that description," he said. "I'm certainly prepared to believe it about myself, though."
"Half past. And we went to sleep about four, so that's a decent amount of sleep, albeit interrupted by our visitors."
"Yeah. It's been really hard, but I think it was the right decision. I hadn't realised how stressed I was all the time until suddenly I wasn't. I feel much healthier these days. I just wish there was a way I could keep things as they are now, but still see all my friends. I'm hoping that one day the world will have lost interest in me, and I'll be able to go back."
"Well, not usually," said Draco. "But that's not why. I think it was partly because it seemed so intimate and I've never been with anyone I was really close to. And partly because it seemed a bit scary. And also partly because no-one's ever swallowed mine."
Draco raised his eyebrows. "You're Head Boy? Even more impressive. I can't imagine there's anyone better, though, so well done whoever decided it should be you."
"Not a wink," said Harry. "I decided to get up and read a book in the end, but I couldn’t concentrate. Then I tried watching the telly, but that didn’t work either, because I couldn’t keep my eyes open. So I thought I
"I never had pets as a child, no," said Draco as he got into the bed. "The peacocks were probably the closest to pets that we had, and they weren't very friendly. I got Kilgharrah from the RSPCA. I'd been thinking about it for a while – I'd heard other people talking about their cats, and I thought she'd help me feel less lonely. And she has – she's made all the difference. I was pretty miserable before I got her."
Harry's cock, which he'd been interested to note had been half-hard ever since Draco had mentioned going to bed, suddenly became more interested in proceedings, which made Harry's answer to this question a lot more difficult to decide upon.
Harry blushed even more. "Erm... Well, I had an idea. But if you don't want to do it, it's fine. Really! In fact, forget I said anything. It doesn't matter."
Draco took a moment to attempt to process this and decided he couldn't. Answering the original question was easier, though.
, I have other things I want to discuss with Draco, so we'd better get going – if that's OK with you, Draco?" Draco grinned and stood up.
– they both lay on their beds chatting, which had become part of their nightly routine. Then Harry suddenly realised that he was still wearing Draco's cashmere jumper.
Teddy grinned. "Well, I don't actually do much other than boss around the prefects and have meetings with McGonagall, but it'll look good on my CV, won't it?"
Draco was staring at him open-mouthed. "Harry, that's an amazingly kind offer, but I couldn't let you give up your own life just to make mine easier! You're Harry bloody Potter!"
"Well, we could Side-Along you if you like, I suppose," said Hermione. "Although..." She paused as she noticed the look on Harry's face.
"It's all lovely, though," said Draco. "Thank you for showing it to me. Now, are you going to buy me a crepe or not?"
Harry, who was walking faster than Draco, gradually vanished behind a dip in the ground; when Draco caught up to him, though, there was still nothing visible other than grass. But then Harry waved his hand, and a very small tent appeared; it clearly wasn't tall enough for Draco (or Harry for that matter) to be able to stand up inside.
Draco, however, wasn't currently thinking about food, but about the way his whole body had seemed to wake up and pay attention when Harry had taken hold of his hand. The contact had lasted only a few seconds, until they were back inside the house, and neither of them had commented on it; when they stepped through the door, Harry had simply let go, but he'd looked back at Draco and smiled.
Harry laughed and held out the cracker. Draco grabbed it and pulled, and then emptied the contents of his half onto his hand.
"I meant to ask you about that, actually," said Draco, yawning. "You said last night that you'd never fallen asleep in someone's arms before. I know you said you and Ginny never did much in bed even at the
"I always wanted a puppy, when I was little," admitted Harry, climbing in on the other side of the cat. "It was probably just as well I never had one, though. I'm sure Dudley would have killed it, either by accident or on purpose. I think I'd still like a dog, but I haven't really got the time to care for one. They need more attention than cats."
Draco, who had been turning to go back to the kitchen, whipped his head round to look at Harry, who laughed.
"I'd love to say I'd guessed it must be something like that, but that would be a total lie," said Rabia. "I knew there was something special about you - and Harry, for that matter - but I thought it was just that you were insanely talented. Which, I hasten to add, you absolutely still are."
"Harry, I've really enjoyed this evening," he said. "And I hope there'll be many more to come. But I'm afraid that
Mr Ollivander raised his eyebrows. "I must admit I would not," he said after a few moments. "Usually a wand that has been taken by force is never quite the same if it is reacquired. At best, I might have expected that its behaviour would be unchanged. I confess I have never heard of one that grew in power."
"Al did tell me that you teach Potions at Beauxbatons. How have you managed to get time off from there to be here?"
"I'll try," said Malfoy. "But... Well, it's only fair to warn you that I might not dare. We do seem to be having a civilised conversation right now, for which I'm grateful, but me telling
Harry sighed, but couldn't resist reaching up and stroking the cat. It definitely approved of this, emitting a steady, surprisingly loud purr, and Harry was sufficiently encouraged to try stroking the front of its neck. It promptly lifted its chin and stretched languorously, but after a minute of this, it turned and walked a few steps along the fence before looking back at Harry.
"They won't need to ask that," said Harry. "I'm pretty sure it'll be obvious to anyone who sees us."
(Seamus and Ron heard it on a jukebox in a Muggle pub once, and have teased Harry about its existence ever since!)
," said Ron. "I think Ginny just thought he was annoyed by the inconvenience. She's convinced that people will leave him alone if he talks to them."
Teatime the next day found Harry and Draco waiting for Ginny in the garden at The Burrow, both in a very subdued mood. Ginny's message had caused their nascent relationship to falter for the first time, and Harry wasn't sure how to fix things. Draco had instantly closed himself off emotionally, and he'd reacted noncommittally to all Harry's increasingly desperate attempts to talk to him. Harry had mainly been thinking out loud, wondering what the chances were of Ginny having found a solution where
. You know: giving my wand back, rescuing me from Fiendfyre, testifying for me, saving the world... that sort of thing. Now, I'm thanking you for being kind enough to try and make me feel better about the stupid things I did when I was a boy. You really don't have to – I know what a nasty piece of work I was then, especially to you – but I do appreciate it." Draco was embarrassed to feel a lump in his throat. He hoped he wasn't about to start crying; true, Harry had cried in front of him only hours earlier, but he'd had a good reason. How pathetic would it be to cry over something that had happened over twenty years earlier?
Not quite as many thousands of words as intended, because I got distracted and didn't start till hours after I meant to! But tomorrow is another relatively free day.
Harry stared for a few more seconds, and then his face broke into a grin. "No, please stay," he said. "The past can stay in the past as far as I'm concerned. And you already seem much more pleasant than the Lucius Malfoy I used to know, so I'm prepared to believe you've changed. Come on, sit down, all of you. Budge up, Teddy."
Her final question had been the easiest: which was his favourite bit so far? He was distracted briefly by the memory of a pair of trumpeters suddenly appearing to play "Glory to God" from the very back of the stage (they didn't play anything else in the first half), but then he remembered the shivers that had run down his spine when Draco had sung his first note.
"Hey, it's not a big deal," said Ron. "It might even be good for us all. Harry and I are quite similar in our methods. Working with someone different will probably make us both better Aurors."
Draco put the parchment down, his face expressionless. "I see," he said. "And may I ask how you responded to this?"
"Cricket’s boring," Draco told him. "And Old Trafford cricket ground only holds a fraction of Old Trafford football ground’s capacity, in any case. Yes, I go to football. Not every week, because I don’t always have time, but I’m a member, and I get tickets when I can. It’s very exciting."
"No forgiveness necessary. It was me that brought up the subject, after all," said Harry. "Now, I know you want to see more of Draco, but I'm afraid I'm going to keep him a bit longer. We're going to visit my friends this afternoon, and then we're going back to the campsite tonight. But I'll return him to you tomorrow, I promise."
Scorpius had come over as well, of course, accompanied by all three Potter children. McGonagall's announcement had merely stated that Potter would be absent for two weeks due to urgent business elsewhere, and it seemed that James had been about to go and ask her for more information, until Albus had suggested asking Draco. Draco had, luckily, already spoken to McGonagall regarding this situation, so he was able to tell them that their father had gone to the Quidditch camp to surprise their mother. He was relieved when they accepted this explanation quite happily; James and Albus even explained to Lily, when she protested, that it was obvious why their father had kept this secret from them. Draco had reassured them that of course it would be fine to owl either of their parents, but suggested that maybe it would be better to wait a day or so.
Ron was already at his desk when Harry entered their office. "Morning, mate," he said. "How's it going?"
"YES," said Draco. Harry grinned and pushed all the way in in one swift movement, causing them both to groan.
Harry stood up. "That would be lovely," he said. "Thank you. I'd love to sit down and hear what you've all been doing since the war. And I want to see if you can guess why Teddy and I are here in Hawes, actually – I'm willing to bet none of you will come even close to the right answer."
"The forty-sixth," Draco told him. "There’s only the penthouse above us. It’s great, isn’t it? You can see the whole of Manchester, and right across to the Pennines on one side and the Irish Sea on the other."
"And will I be able to go home after I've seen the surgeon?" she asked the nurse. "I feel much better now. I'm sure I'll be fine with a bit of a rest."
He was looking at Harry, but it was Draco who answered. "It was fine, don't worry," he said. "I must admit that I was a bit shocked at first, but not as shocked as I am at the fact that people don't seem too bothered by me being here. I mean, I suspect it will still be a while before I'll dare to come without Harry, but I'm grateful to you both for showing me that it's not as bad as I thought it would be."
, but now I'm starting to wonder if I dreamed that whole conversation. The more I think about it, the more unlikely it seems that you would actually have said what you said."
"Believe me, we're just as surprised as you are," said Lucius. "Narcissa and I moved to this area recently, and Draco is visiting us. We've been for a walk and came in here for coffee and cake. In fact… are these seats taken? There are no empty tables… would you mind if we joined you? We are all very well-behaved these days, I can assure you. But, given our history, we would completely understand if you'd prefer us to leave."
"I think we'll be OK," said Harry. "And thank you for what you said to me the other week, by the way. I might never have realised there was a problem if you hadn't helped. I don't know where you got your people skills from – it can't have been from me
"Hmm. I can see them asking that, I suppose," Draco admitted. "But I would have thought their first question would be
"Does the TV work OK there, then?" wondered Draco. "I was always told that electrical things wouldn't work in magical environments, but I've found it's not quite as straightforward as that. Everything electrical in my flat works fine, although sometimes things switch themselves off if I do a spell near them."
"Well, there's a sitting room at the end of the cloisters that we're going to use for an eighth-year common room, and of course you'll each have access to your own House common room whenever you like," said McGonagall. "We don't want to keep the eighth-years totally segregated – we think you'll be an excellent influence on the younger students. We won't allow them in
"No idea, actually," said Draco. "I just know they suck them. I was thinking about them while I was sucking your cock."
thought occurred to him, he knew he was going to go along with it. There was, of course, a brief argument in his head, between Sensible Ex-Auror Harry (who knew that it was entirely possible that this was not an ordinary cat and harm might come to him if he let it direct him) and Impulsive Ex-Hero Harry (who was too intrigued by the idea to care), but one of the reasons that Harry was an Ex-Auror rather than an Auror was that Impulsive Ex-Hero Harry won far more internal arguments.
"I could lend you one, but I think we'll be OK as long as we don't stay out too long," said Draco. "We can always pop back if it's too cold."
"Here’s fine," said Harry. "I want to see the sunset from your window, remember? What time will that be?"
Draco kissed him. "I knew there was a reason I agreed to you being my manager," he said. "Thank you - you're brilliant at making me feel better about myself."
“It just annoys me every time,” she was saying. “Coca-Cola are the worst. Have you seen their posters this year? They’re all over the place: Holidays are Coming. And I know they’re an American company, but surely they could have done some
"That makes sense," said Draco. "Look, don't worry. I'm well aware that just because you've got an erection it doesn't mean you fancy
"What a delightful mental image," said Draco drily, " but thank you for the compliment. And thank you for not running away screaming when we dropped the magic surprise. Lots of people would have."
“You're not alone – gimme your hands, cause you're wonderful! Gimme your hands!” sang Draco. He held out his hands towards the audience – but focused on Harry – and remained unmoving while Rabia played the final amazing sequence of chords. When she landed on the last D flat major chord, the audience erupted, but Draco held his pose until the chord had totally died away (at least, he assumed it had, based on rehearsals; he didn’t actually hear the end of it due to the applause). Then he smiled, bowed, shook Rabia’s hand and walked offstage, shaking slightly with adrenaline.
Seamus held up his hand, and after a moment Harry reluctantly high-fived him. "I'm proud of you, mate," said Seamus. "About time. Now, I'm going to want updates on the progress of your relationship, obviously - I've been on my own for a while as well, so I have to live vicariously - but I still need to sleep ASAP... so, what's this favour you need?"
short. Last night was a special case," Harry said. "And, just to warn you, if you keep sucking on that bloody thing like that, I'll be demonstrating my impressive refractory period sooner than you might like."
"Sorry, I've just remembered I promised not to interrupt, and I did it straight away," said Draco. "Do go on. What time did Ginny get home?"
. But the situation you're in now isn't a war... it's a load of politicians making decisions without thinking about the consequences."
"I like your balls," he murmured unexpectedly, giving them a quick squeeze. "Have I ever told you that before?"
"Yes and no," said Draco. "That's certainly what we were taught at school, but the information is slightly out of date. There are a few visible objects that are actually further away. But traditionally it's Andromeda."
I can see what you mean," he said after a moment. "I've never seen a bonfire with quite that many colours, though."
"Well, I appreciate the thought, really," said Harry, "but I don't actually mind walking. And it's not
"Your secret is safe with me," Harry reassured him. "So the only thing I'm still curious about is this Amen Chorus you've mentioned a few times. Why is that such a big deal?"
"Hmm," said Draco. "Very odd. That’s called 'mano cornuta', and it’s believed to ward off evil. It’s a protective gesture rather than a curse."
," Harry pointed out. "I don’t want Christmas all the year round. But I do expect it when it’s finally December." He stamped his feet as they reached the door of Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, trying to dislodge some of the snow from his boots.
"I haven't had this for ages," Harry said, swirling the remains of his Firewhisky. "I think I still slightly prefer Butterbeer, in general. But there are moments when something stronger feels necessary, and this is perfect."
“It’d be quite nice in the grounds if it was summer - and if there was already a piano out here, of course,” commented Rabia. “But it’s not as if you’re a magician who could warm everyone
Hermione laughed. "Drama queen," she said. "Thank you again for all this. See you soon – with Harry."
make the connection, because I suspect that otherwise I'd have spent the next hour or so trying to steel myself to start my story. But I may as well start now."
"Can you grab her stuff, then, please?" asked the paramedic. Draco looked round and saw  several bags of shopping which had been dropped on the pavement near where Granger had been lying. Most of the contents were intact, but there were a few items strewn around nearby, including several Hamleys bags, a huge Christmas pudding and, amazingly, a wand. Draco was surprised at how relieved he was to spot this, and tucked it safely inside his coat.
"Call it payment of a life debt," said Draco. "Also, it'll be a good challenge. I try to keep my mind as active as I can. Like yesterday... although that was partly the mental challenge and partly me trying to be nice."
"I've never heard you talk about your parents before," said Draco, "but I know things were strained for a while after you had to modify their memories in the war - is everything OK now?"
"There's nothing silly about it – it's perfectly natural," said Hermione. "But if Draco manages to bring us closer together again, that's just a bonus. He's obviously already made you happier."
Note: sorry if the length of this last part is a bit of a shock compared to the earlier ones! I told you I had a bit of a way to go! And this last part took a REALLY LONG TIME not just because it’s long, but also because I had to do it all on my phone. BUT IT’S DONE \o/
," he said, with a complicated wand gesture. "There, that should do it. Listen, I'll add your friends, too, of course, if you do end up staying here, but... do you mind if we wait until you've decided? You'll see why."
The girls left the hall, chattering excitedly, and McGonagall turned to the boys. "Now, this is a bit more difficult," she began. "I don't suppose..."
Ginny was gazing at their hands with a puzzled look on her face as Harry spoke again. "And you still haven't told me how you managed to find this supposed solution," he said. "Hermione said there was no way the spell could be reversed. Are you saying she's wrong? Do you have proof?"
"You're comfortable holding onto me?" was what Draco got from that, but he refrained (with some effort) from saying so. Instead, he said: "It's no problem. So where's this campsite?"
"Not that I can think of," said Draco. "She's in a Muggle hospital – University College Hospital, it's called. They've treated her, and she'll be fine, but some magical healing would probably help. She fell on the ice, and she's definitely broken her wrist and sprained her ankle. They're monitoring her to check for serious brain injuries, because she banged her head, but it looks as if she's been fairly lucky. I think she's going to have to stay where she is till morning, but she'll feel better if you're there in the meantime, I'm sure. Well, and Weasley, of course, but maybe he might come if
"How was it for you?" asked Draco, smiling. He pulled the duvet over them both and laid his head on Harry's chest.
"Please, Professor," said Parvati, after sharing a nod with Hermione. "The girls have all agreed already, if you're happy to go along with what we've sorted out?"
"Yes, Hermione mentioned that you had left the wizarding world behind," said Draco. "I'm dying to know why, but it's OK if you don't want to talk about it."
"You didn't attack me, you just pointed your wand at me," said Draco, coming to sit next to him. "And you backed off as soon as I spoke. So there's no harm done. Although it's quite a terrifying sight, you know, having Harry Potter's wand pointing at you. Much more so these days than the
"He has indeed, and he's been very welcome. You know, I suspect the reason he hasn't talked about me is that he's unsure how you'd react. It's a well-known fact that you and I didn't get on very well at school."
"It does look like they want another one," Draco pointed out; his parents were indeed still on the dancefloor looking expectant. "A slow one, I think. This one's supposed to be sung by a woman, really, but I love it. And it's optimistic."
This kiss was quite different to the earlier one, because Harry had chuckled at Draco's comment, and that had set Draco off, and now they were snogging feverishly but also laughing every time they paused for breath. It was a heady sensation, and Draco felt quite giddy. Eventually, though, he was the one who pulled them apart.
Draco returned the kiss enthusiastically, before breaking away a minute later and noticing that Hermione and Ron, much to his surprise, were both beaming at him.
"Leaving aside for the moment the fact that I'm amazed you know that... you're quite correct," said Harry. "And you can probably also guess how it works. Hermione sorted it out, of course. She and I were moaning to each other one day a few years ago about electrical things we missed having around, and she decided it was a problem she needed to solve, and she did."
"To see how the evil Death Eater isn't quite so evil any more?" Draco laughed as he said this, but Harry was sure could feel his leg tense up from where their knees were touching.
"It'll be pretty dark in an hour, won't it?" said Draco. "It's half past three now, and sunset's about a quarter to four today. I looked it up."
Draco looked uncertain, but Harry squeezed his hand. "Draco, I promised not to tell anyone about your musical talents, but since you brought it up yourself... please let them see how brilliant you are!"
Harry laughed. "I'll take that as a compliment," he said. "I did it myself, but rest assured it's the only thing I know how to do to my hair. A barber suggested I should try it like this years ago, and I realised I quite liked it, so I made him show me how to do it. I don't do it very often, though – I like the look of it, but not the feel, at least not after the first few hours."
Harry laughed, a little breathlessly. "No, I don't think you have," he said. "What's so good about them? Mine seem a bit weird to me. Yours are much nicer."
Draco's grin widened, but he didn't remove the candy cane. "Warning noted," he said. "So, did you stop after two wanks last night, or...?"
Those who know me won’t be surprised that I’m putting Manchester into the story again! There aren’t enough stories set there. Also, sorry that this is moving a bit slowly. I’ve had the lurgy all week and haven’t had the energy to write as much as I wanted to. Hopefully this will pass soon.
"I've never heard anyone say that before," he said thoughtfully. "I wonder whether it's to do with which one you do first? Most people think rimming feels much dirtier, but then again most people try that much later."
Draco was determined to beat Harry's challenge. "You just wanted some peace and quiet in the countryside. Or to do some walking," was his first guess.
"I haven’t seen him much either, but yes, I’ve used him a few times when we’ve been stuck on a curse. He really knows his stuff."
"How was that?" he said, putting an arm round both Harry and Draco. "Did you like it? More importantly, did it work?"
"We may have to amend the rules as we go," said Harry, grinning. "Now, are you going to offer us a drink, or is this going to be another argument?"
"Erm, are you alright, Mione?" asked Ron, as Harry and Draco looked at each other in confusion. Hermione merely giggled helplessly - so much so, in fact, that she had to sit down.
a scary thought," he said. "To this day, she remains the only person who has ever punched me in the face. Not an experience I care to repeat. But you needn't worry: I have no intention of hurting Harry. The attraction goes both ways."
"Of course," said Ron, looking embarrassed. "Sorry. Rose, Hugo, this is Draco Malfoy. He was in the same year as all of us at Hogwarts. Malfoy, this is our daughter Rose and our son Hugo."
"Just fish and chips for me, please," said Draco. Harry grinned and flung a piece of fish into the oil. Draco found himself matching his grin.
When he finally got the chance to return to his quarters, he sank into the armchair and sat in blessed silence for a few minutes, before beginning one of his favourite relaxation exercises, which involved clenching each part of his body (starting with the toes on his right foot), holding it for a few seconds and then releasing. He had almost finished – only his forehead was left – when the flames in the fireplace suddenly turned green; a second later, Harry Potter stepped out.
"I see what you mean about them being underpowered," said Harry. "Does it actually work with so few of them? I'd've thought they'd be totally drowned out by the women."
"Well, in that case we'd better get some sleep pretty soon, if we've got to be back there for... when d'you think? Nine o'clock?"
Draco and Scorpius were enjoying their dessert (they'd both opted for tiramisu) when the waiter came to their table with a piece of parchment.
The huge extended Weasley clan was mostly a bit tipsy by the time Harry and Draco arrived at the Burrow, but Draco was relieved to find that they did indeed treat him as a welcome guest. Molly and Ginny both hugged him, even, saying that they were thrilled to see Harry happy at last.
Harry slumped bonelessly to the floor and pulled Draco down next to him. "Did you... oh, good, you did," he said, running a finger through the puddle of come on Draco's stomach and then licking it. "Sorry I missed it. You're just too mindblowing. I promise to pay more attention next time, though."
"Well, these days I think it's always better to avoid possibly upsetting people if I can, but thank you," said Draco. "I've said enough idiotic things in the past that I'm trying not to repeat my mistakes. Anyway, in answer to your second question, the other thing I said was
time you pointed your wand at me. Somehow the knowledge that you've killed Voldemort since then makes it much scarier. Imagine that."
Harry, who had frozen briefly, relaxed slightly as Neville finished speaking. He was suddenly convinced that everyone must be able to tell what he and Draco had been doing. He was sure his whole body must be glowing after the attention Draco had lavished on it, and his arsehole was still buzzing from its encounter with Draco's tongue. They'd fallen asleep soon after that – Draco enclosed in Harry's arms this time – and had ended up sharing a shower when they woke up. It was just as well they'd gone to bed as early as they had, because they spent so long in the shower that their skin was beginning to wrinkle when they emerged; their cocks, however, were tingling, after frotting while kissing had led to mutual desperate handjobs.
Draco shook himself and got dressed before looking for a bathroom. This, too, was tiny – possibly the smallest bathroom Draco had ever used – with a shower over the bath and a sink crammed in next to the toilet. The window was slightly ajar, and a sudden gust of cold air hurried Draco out of the room and downstairs.
After the meal, and the drinks after the meal, and the mince pies after the drinks after the meal, and the coffee after the mince pies after the drinks after the meal, Harry was ready for some fresh air. As he put his coat on, he wondered whether Ron would...
"It looks lovely," said Harry, breaking up a bread roll and dumping the pieces in the soup, before scooping one into his mouth. "And it
"I'm impressed, Potter," said Draco. "I didn't realise you were a language expert. Which other languages do you speak?"
“Hi, Rabia, I guess you must be in on the secret now? I’m pleased - it’s never nice keeping things from friends, but you’ll understand why we often have to. You look amazing, by the way! Like a Christmas cracker!” said Hermione. “Now, where’s the place we need to expand?”
a conversation, but it's usually as a listener. For example... can you remember what the last thing I said tonight was, before I interrupted you to mention Draco?"
"Which is why I feel so stupid, having to ask about it when I'm almost forty years old," said Harry bitterly.
Molly considered this. “Well, I’m an old romantic at heart,” she confessed, “so do you know any love songs?”
like to wander down Diagon Alley and be able to browse in the shops, but actually the old me never used to do that, so I don't have any memories of what I'm imagining. I did used to go to Diagon Alley, of course, but it was almost always with one or both of my parents, and they (well, my father mainly) disapproved of me wandering off or chatting to people, so I never did... and if I was ever there on my own, that behaviour was too ingrained, so I always just used to go straight to the relevant shop, get what I'd come for, and go straight home."
"Pretty much," said Teddy. "Although I've been awake for a while. I just haven't got dressed yet. I was about to, though. Victoire's coming round soon."
"I was up there last week on a case," said Harry. "And they have these amazing Christmas markets. I looked them up afterwards, and it turns out they're the best Christmas markets in the UK. But I didn't have time to look round while I was there, so I thought we might pop up there now."
of things, obviously, but let's just stick with that one for today." He sat down on his bed and sighed, ignoring his trunk.
," said Ron. "You will soon, though. The bond won't let you be apart for quite a while. You're right about one thing, though. Think how much worse this would have been if we still hated Draco like we did at school!"
Harry sat up and turned to face him, still holding his hand. "Really? That'd be great! You wouldn't be too embarrassed?"
Harry beamed at him. "Stand up," he said, doing so himself. As usual, many heads turned to look at him; what happened next was less usual, however. Harry took hold of Draco's head and proceeded to kiss him thoroughly.
night, though," commented Draco, pouring them both a cup of coffee and handing one to Harry. "It won’t hurt to take a potion for one night. But not sleeping for three consecutive nights
Despite the conversation about the bed, Harry was quite grateful when Malfoy suggested that he should probably go and lie down for a while. However, he didn't manage to stay there very long: every time he closed his eyes, his mind started spiralling downwards into a collection of black thoughts, and when his eyes were open they insisted on trying to close again. Eventually he gave up and went back into the living room, where he found Malfoy surrounded by DADA textbooks.
altruistic. But the most important thing right now is for you to get some sleep. D'you think you'll be able to?"
The pub was packed, as was to be expected on a Friday teatime. Most of the customers were employees of the shops on Diagon Alley, but there were also a few Aurors scattered around, their scarlet robes immediately drawing attention. Harry nodded to each of them as he made his way through the room. He was surprised to notice Draco Malfoy sitting on his own at the bar, and almost stopped for a brief word until a particularly loud scream of laughter from the far corner reminded him of what he was supposed to be doing. Harry had been as shocked as everyone else when Draco had joined the Aurors, but three years of training together had made him realise that Draco was actually not as obnoxious as Harry had previously assumed. 'Malfoy' had gradually become 'Draco', and these days they got on reasonably well at work.
"Right," said Draco. "OK then, let's see. When was the last time anyone asked you to meet them just to spend time together, without having an actual thing you were both going to do?"
Having done this, Harry resumed his previous activity of stirring the contents of the oil vats – there were actually two, one of which was full of chips – while talking to Ron and Hermione. Draco couldn't hear what they were saying, but was fascinated to see that the woman at the till was still not doing any work, and none of the customers seemed upset at their wait. Then it dawned on him.
"Internet, of course," said Draco. "I've got friends all over the place. Mostly in America, but a few in other places too."
"What do you want us to do until everyone else arrives?" asked Ron. "Shall we just go up to Gryffindor Tower and wait?"
him? Then, all of a sudden, he remembered what had happened. He opened his eyes and found Harry gazing at him with a warm smile on his face.
as I was walking up," Padma told them, "but they just seemed surprised rather than... well, you know, disgusted or anything. So I think it'll be fine."
"I have to admit that I am," said Draco. "I'll stop if you don't like it. I don't want to embarrass you. But I'm not going to hide the fact that I do like to look at good-looking men, and
"But... She has no other way of contacting you, you idiot," Draco protested. "Do you really want me to go back to her and tell her that her husband refused to come and help her?"
The man in question, who had been staring into the flames, looked up at Harry's exclamation. He nodded politely, but Harry couldn't tell from his expressionless face whether or not he was pleased to see him... although the fact that there was no outright hostility visible was a good sign, he thought.
Mostly, however, Harry was chatting to Ron, who had briefly leaned over the back of the sofa to watch what was going on, but had soon lost interest in the laptop and sprawled in an armchair.
Harry shivered violently. "We… are… but I've never… asked them… to do… anything like this… beFORE." The last word ended on a strangled gasp, as Draco wondered what it would be like if he stuck his tongue into Harry's hole, and decided that this was a good time to find out.
They grinned at each other – at least, Draco thought Harry was grinning back at him; he couldn't actually see in the dark.
"Fair point, well made," admitted Harry. He smiled to himself and stared at Draco's arse, which as usual looked positively sinful in his tight jeans. "What are you going to wear, by the way?"
Harry sat on the piano stool as Draco played the last few chords, and leaned his head on Draco's shoulder. "Did you mean all of that?" he asked, not daring to look at Draco's face as he did so.
Harry grinned wryly. "Well, yes. And I thought it'd be better when I didn't have to do that any more, but it turns out it's just – well, really boring, most of the time."
. It's been one of my favourites ever since I heard it. And when I got home I realised was just so happy, and it occurred to me that I might even be able to do a Patronus at last. And I was thinking about Gerontius after his death, and ashes, and I can't help assuming that that's why it ended up being a phoenix. I know about the Dumbledore thing, of course, but I don't think mine has anything to do with me being amazingly powerful."
"None, but he can’t have been a Muggle, can he? Not in Diagon Alley. Anyway, do Muggle curses actually work?"
Scorpius smiled knowingly at him at that, but didn't say anything. Albus, however, looked unsettled. "He's coming back tomorrow? Does that mean you'll be leaving?"
"That's where the shops are," added Narcissa. "And Tuesday is market day. Oh, and there's a pleasant little café. We should pop in for coffee and cake."
"Come and see!" said Harry, going into the front room. "Teddy, look who's come to see you! This is your cousin Draco. His mum is your mum's sister."
When he was down to nothing but his boxer briefs and the Santa hat, he paused with his hand at his waistband, suddenly nervous. "Harry... I haven't misunderstood, have I? I'm hoping this isn't just a one-off... don't get me wrong, I'm not stopping now even if it
They got downstairs to find Lucius and Narcissa already sitting at the table, but they hadn't started to eat yet, even though there was food in front of them. They didn't seem to recognise Draco, paying no attention to him even when he tapped them on the shoulder, but when he held a piece of toast out to his mother she took it, and started eating. His father ignored the toast, but accepted a teacup when it was held to his lips.
"Maybe I meant one of those weird kettles that the Americans use, that they heat on top of a stove," Harry suggested, his eyes twinkling. "They don't need electricity."
"I think it’s nice," said Harry. "Do you think she’d like to do mine, too? I’d ask Helen, but she’s a bit… Well, she’s a great PA, but I don’t think decorating is her sort of thing."
"Stargazing time!" said Harry. "Tell you what, I'm going to bring out that bag of cake so we can dip into it when we feel like it. We can have soup later, when we're freezing – we'll appreciate it more then."
"You know you're both welcome any time," said Draco. "In fact, why don't we have this week's meal here? I haven't forgotten I promised to do my stroganoff so Ron can laugh at it."
Harry interlocked his fingers with Draco's and smiled at him, not letting go. "Singing!" he exclaimed. "I almost forgot. You were going to tell me more about what sort of things you sing when it's not the Messiah."
"He wasn't exaggerating when he said he'd tried very hard not to waste his new life," said Draco, finally managing to control his laughter. "He's a model citizen these days."
"Finem lux," said Harry, and the light vanished. He stood behind Draco and wrapped his arms round him, his cock pressing along Draco's arse-crack. "Damn, my dark adaptation has totally gone. I can't see anything."
"That makes sense," Harry admitted. "But I can't help noticing you haven't mentioned any wizarding friends. What happened to all of them? Zabini, and Parkinson, and... I'm really sorry, I can't remember which of Crabbe and Goyle it was who died."
"I'd been to a concert at the Royal Albert Hall," said Draco. "I go to quite a few concerts. I've become quite a fan of classical music over the last few years, and
Harry hit him with the pillow again. "That may have been true in the past, but it's not any more," he said. "But let's stick to talking about clothes shopping for the moment. How do we sort out the money? I have plenty, don't worry, but how do I pay if you're the one doing the shopping?"
"The anticipation will make it even better, I suspect," said Harry. "Right then. Let's plan. Before I met you, I was planning to stay one more night here before going home. But I don't have to. Do you want to camp again tonight?"
– but until the hand-holding, it hadn't occurred to him that there might be a possibility of more than just ogling the man.
"I think you can expect to be here until the morning – maybe ten o'clock, but not much later," said the nurse. "We need to keep up the intermittent obs until breakfast, but there hasn't been anything to worry about with the ones I've taken so far. If that remains the case, we'll just send you to the plaster room to get your wrist and ankle plastered – they only work daytimes, so you can't go till then anyway – and then we'll discharge you with a week's worth of painkillers and an appointment for the fracture clinic. You'll need a lot of help at home for a while, though – will that be a problem?" She looked at Ron expectantly.
"Yes, definitely," Harry said, planting a kiss right in the middle of Draco's breastbone. "I want to spend as much time as I can with you, and if I have to hide what we are it'll make that much more difficult. There's no reason to keep it a secret... unless
"Death Eaters and purebloods, he means, Harry," Draco chimed in, with a grimace. "And I know exactly what you're thinking, I promise you, and I'll be very happy to discuss it afterwards. There's a buffet, right, Oliver? Maybe we can talk then."
By Monday morning, Hogwarts was buzzing with anticipation. There had even been some talk of cancelling the whole timetable so that the whole school could watch Harry and Draco's first duelling session, but this had proved to be unfeasible. There were cheers, however, when Harry had stood up after the Sunday evening meal and promised that he and Draco would try to ensure that every class got to see more or less the same duel; they would not be using watered-down spells for the younger students.
"Well, you know we're covering all the different ways in which objects can be cursed," said Draco, and Harry nodded. "James wanted to know whether there's any way in which you can tell if an object was
"I wish you'd stop calling yourself stupid, you know," said Draco. "It's not stupid to trust someone you love. It's not stupid to believe the best of people, if you have no evidence to the contrary."
Harry was nowhere to be seen, so Draco called his name. A moment later, there were footsteps coming down the stairs, and then he heard Harry's voice calling: "Come out into the hall."
"I didn't realise I was so tired, but I feel amazing now," said Draco. "I hope you haven't been waiting for me before you could eat? You should have woken me."
Draco blushed at that, but was unable to remove his grin. "I think it's surprised both of us, but we certainly seem to be on the same wavelength. We have more in common than anyone would have predicted. I'm enjoying spending time with him."
"Oh, I don't know. Now we're not at school any more, I'm often surprised at how well Gryffindor and Slytherin go together."
"Last four days?" said Rabia. "Draco's been talking about you ever since I met him... three years ago."
At that moment, a house-elf popped into the hall with a huge tray full of bacon butties and a jug of coffee.
"James is calmer – in fact, I think he's actually pleased," said Albus. "I suspect this is what he's been hoping would happen. He's glad it's finally sorted out. Lily and Hugo were a bit upset at first, but James explained to them that it would be better this way, and they're both OK now. And Rose says she'd seen Mum with Dean a few times and had guessed something was going on, but didn't like to say."
“I do mean it, and thank you, I’d appreciate that very much,” she said. “Now, go and find that man of yours – he’ll be desperate to see you. He was in and out nonstop the hour before the recitals started, bringing in all the rest of your fan club one by one. No idea why they couldn’t get here on their own, but never mind.”
"Hardly any," admitted Harry. "I didn’t even walk to the canteen – I got my assistant to bring me my lunch at my desk."
Longbottom was one of those who'd come up to speak to him during dessert. He seemed overjoyed when he discovered that he was responsible for Draco being there; Draco thanked him fervently. It had become obvious to him during the war that Longbottom was by no means the idiot Draco had initially thought him to be, but they'd never met since then; the fact that Longbottom had recommended Draco for a job, despite the abuse he'd received from him in their youth, made Draco even more ashamed of his younger self's behaviour. Apologising at this point seemed a bit ridiculous, but he resolved to get to know the Herbology professor better so that he could maybe attempt to apologise over a drink sometime.
"It's a gift," said Draco, smirking. "Seriously, though, don't worry about what happened in the bathroom. I accept your apology, of course, but it wasn't necessary."
"OK," said Harry. "Song, then hospital. I presume the next fixed thing in their routine is lunch? What time do they have that?"
Draco had only intended to remove the top layer, but somehow everything stuck together and the manoeuvre ended with Harry topless.
Harry waited outside the door to the Great Hall, suddenly unexpectedly nervous. Hermione and Ron had already gone ahead to take their seats, and he and Draco were about to join them.
Draco looked expectantly at Harry, who blushed and opened his mouth to speak but then closed it again. Then: "Oh, what the hell," muttered Harry, and then his lips were touching Draco's.
a huge job, I suppose, but it won't feel like it, because I'll enjoy it, I promise you. And I'm thrilled that there's finally something major I can do for
them," he admitted. "I promise I won't try to speak to them. I do want to try and wait until Ginny can be here for that. But I sort of feel as if I'll feel better if I can reassure myself that they all definitely look fine at the moment, before their world gets torn apart."
"I'm not sure," said Harry, after a few moments' consideration. "I do talk. But, now that I think about it, I can't remember the last time talked to just one person for any length of time, other than today. There's always a group – or at least a couple. And I just... I don't know why, but it always feels weird to talk about myself when I'm talking to a couple, or even more so if it's a big group. So it's all just small talk. Which is nice, but not as nice as talking properly one to one."
"Blissfully. It'd be quite sickening if it wasn't so adorable. You can see for yourself - I'm definitely going to want them to meet you at some point."
GMT. But every time someone in Australia or the Far East mentions that it's Wednesday, for example, when to me it's only Tuesday, I have to remind myself of how it all works all over again. I wonder why that is?"
"I'd never heard that term before we moved here," said Narcissa, "but yes, it is. It's good, though – not actually greasy at all."
It just popped into my head - well, not the Merry Christmas bit, but the rest of it - because you're absolutely right, but you're not the first person to say something like that to me. Hermione and Ron have both tried several times, but so have all the other Weasleys. And Minerva. Oh, and Padma, of course. And even Seamus, once."
After a few minutes, an unspoken agreement pulled them apart, albeit somewhat reluctantly. Harry took hold of Draco's hands, and they grinned at each other.
And it was. The park was covered with a white coating in a matter of minutes, and they stood in the middle of the path and gazed around themselves in awe. "I love this place," said Draco. "The best views of the Palace are from here, plus the lakes are so pretty."
"I didn't say it wouldn't be popular, I said that Draco didn't think it would sell out," Harry told her. "And there's no need to panic - he said he'd save us some seats."
He glanced round to check that the others were in position. Anna and Rabia were seated side by side at the piano; Sharon was seated in the curve of the grand piano, cello in position and bow in hand, and Andrew was standing next to her; he saluted Draco with his flute, and Draco grinned and turned back to the audience. "Oh, and I forgot to mention: there's even a vital part for Harry!" he told them.
"I don't doubt it," said Harry, grinning back at him. "And, going back to what I was saying before, I'm sure those third-years will be perfectly behaved in the morning. Albus and Scorpius will lead the way, and the rest won't dare not to follow their lead."
A similar routine followed for all the other customers in the queue, which cleared remarkably quickly, until finally it was Ron and Hermione's turn. As they paid for their food, Harry, who'd been leaning on the counter watching proceedings since he'd finished frying fish, spoke up. "I'll probably come round tomorrow or the day after, if that's OK. As soon as I've decided what to do."
"I mean, yes, ideally, but that's only because I'm keen," said Harry. "There's no specific date it needs to be. So it depends on you, really."
stop you," said Draco, grinning. "Just so you know, though, I'm definitely going to want to return the favour later. If I ever recover from my current sensory overload, that is."
. You're always sitting reading a book, and Mum's always writing long messages to people at work." James didn't meet Harry's eyes when he said this, which was unlike him, but starting conversations about his parents' relationship was also not something he'd ever done before, so Harry didn't worry too much. About
Draco added this fact to his mental evidence collection: his theory was starting to look quite promising. "Right. Sorry, I'd forgotten. OK, then... What about hugs? You seem like the hugging type."
to go to the toilet today. There are, as I just mentioned, only fifteen minutes left of the lesson. Your bladders should all be competent enough to cope for fifteen minutes. If they are not, I suggest you go and visit the hospital wing this evening for advice." He was slightly gratified to see Rose Weasley, one of the few members of the class who
Harry grabbed his hand and pulled him up, hugging him tightly before dragging him to the bathroom, laughing. Within minutes, the sound of the shower was mingling with occasional moans. The subsequent knocking on the door went unnoticed.
"Well, thank you," said Draco. "Shall we go outside to talk? It's a lovely day, and I really like the Manor gardens in the autumn."
, in which the singer gives a list of good and bad deeds from his life and realises that the fact that he’s survived all of them makes him stronger.
Very little progress today, because of other circumstances. I will get the story to move on eventually!
Harry laughed. "Well, I wouldn’t go that far! But you haven’t answered my question: whose are the Christmas stockings?"
"It's just that... well, when I was at Hogwarts I always knew what my aim was, even if I didn't particularly like it. Kill Voldemort, end the war, save the world, whatever you want to call it. And afterwards... I think that when I joined the Aurors I was still trying to follow that aim, because I didn't have any
– and I'm enjoying it too." They grinned at each other. "Now, as you pointed out to that house-elf earlier, I'll have to go to meals, otherwise people will wonder where I am. And it's nearly teatime, so I think
"Oh, yeah," said Harry. "Seamus used to go on about them all the time at school. I'm not convinced he'd ever actually
"Exhausted," admitted Draco. "But I'm glad we did this. Oh, and I meant to ask you: do you really want me to go back to the hospital with you in the morning? I'm happy to, of course, but I wondered whether you were just being polite."
Draco had seen Potter briefly two weeks earlier, at King's Cross, but he didn't recall him looking so
"A bit weird," said Draco, after a moment's thought. "But it'd work brilliantly for the first bit. I definitely don't want to get changed in the middle, though - that'd be silly. Hmm." They both sat there for a couple of minutes in silence; Harry found himself staring at the twinkling fairy lights across the wall while he tried to think about the problem.
"You mean the Nutcracker soldier?" said Draco. "I was just thinking the same thing. That's about the sixth one we've seen since we arrived! That crepe stall has one, but so did that stall with the woolly hats, and the one with the hog roast, and... well, I forget, but there were others."
The next afternoon, Draco was walking slowly along the Embankment, deep in thought. Although it was nowhere near sunset, the sky was slightly dark, which seemed particularly odd given that it was filled with swirling snowflakes. Draco stopped under one of the lampposts and gazed out over the river.
As he reached the alley from which he usually Apparated, he wondered (not for the first time) why Muggles made such an effort to keep their roads free of ice, yet paid no such attention to their pavements. But then, he told himself (again, not for the first time), if the wizarding world was as obsessed with cars, maybe they would do the same. As it was, though, although he avoided the wizarding world as much as possible these days, he was at least grateful that regular use of the Tabidus charm meant that its pavements were safe to walk on.
"It'd definitely help if I don't have to go in that room," said Harry. "What about your parents, though? What will they be like, d'you think?"
"Yes, very," said Draco, "But I'll warm up in no time when I'm back in the sleeping bag. Help me get some of these clothes off?" He pulled his boots off and knelt on the airbed.
"I do. And I think he’s definitely the person to ask about this. Shall I owl him and see if he’s available?"
"Of course Padma bloody well told me. I don't know if you've noticed, Harry, but people tend to talk about you, and that's even
Even more surprising than Narcissa, though, was the rest of the row – Ginny Weasley and Dean Thomas were startling enough (Ginny’s wink suggested that they were well aware of this), but on their far side sat Pansy Parkinson, Blaise Zabini and… good grief, thought Draco, even an almost-unrecognisable Gregory Goyle.
Teddy shook his head, smiling. "You're all idiots," he stated. "But at least it's all sorted now. This is great!"
Draco suddenly wondered whether or not Potter lived here alone. It certainly looked that way, but it did seem unlikely. What had happened to the Weasley girl? Draco had assumed that there would be mini-Potters by now. Mini-Weasleys too, in fact; it occurred to him that he had no idea whether or not Weasley and Granger had any children. Surely Granger would have said so, if there were any?
Harry stared at him, taken aback. "Is that what you think I'm like?" he asked. "You're wrong, if so. I'm not a one-off sort of bloke. But if
This caused a burst of surprised whispering from many people, and Draco and Harry both smiled. "That already tells you that he's no longer the same Draco Malfoy that I was at school with," Harry went on, "but that's not even the biggest change in his life. I mentioned that he'd been studying; most of you won't be aware
have anything to do with the explosion, but if that’s the case then I don’t understand why he won’t tell us what he was doing there."
Harry felt Draco's flash of anger, although his facial expression didn't alter. "Of course," said Harry. "But only as friends, Ginny, just to be clear. I'm sorry, but whatever happens between me and Draco I can't be with you again. I've known for a while that I'm not the best partner for you, but I just didn't want to upset you so I didn't say anything. You'll be much happier with someone else."
"Pleasant though this is, can I remind you about how bloody freezing I am?" he pointed out. "Let's get the bedding sorted out and get inside, and then we can continue."
Harry grinned, relieved. Then he frowned, suddenly worried. "You won't tell them it was my suggestion, though, will you?" he asked. "I don't want people to think that's why you're doing it."
"No," said Harry. "Well, yes, but there are lots of places I could have done that. There's a reason we came here rather than anywhere else in England."
is the spell Professor Potter used to destroy Voldemort," Draco pointed out, pleased that the students had fallen for their bait. "None of us would be here today if he hadn't known it." The whole class swivelled to look at Harry, only to discover that he'd vanished while they'd been paying attention to Draco. They looked at each other, puzzled. A second later, they all jumped, and many of them screamed, when Harry reappeared from thin air, standing beside Draco.
"We're fine, Father," interrupted Draco. "That Christmas pudding alone will fill us up till tomorrow, and Harry's already got food anyway."
"I see that now," said Narcissa. "I am sorry we misjudged you. We should have known better, given your history."
that total waste of time on Saturday night, it'd be bad enough. But both those things happen every week, and I'm wondering how much longer I can stand it."
"Never thought I'd be in a threesome with Draco bloody Malfoy, but times have changed, haven't they?" said Ron. He winked at Draco, and Draco was privately amused when he caused Ron's jaw to drop by winking back.
He'd come with every intention of having a proper conversation, but Hermione had sent him to the shop for brandy as soon as he'd arrived (Ron had apparently insisted that Christmas pudding wasn't Christmas pudding unless it had brandy poured over it and set on fire, and Harry had to agree), and when he'd returned the conversation had fallen back to the usual what-happened-at-work-today nothingness. Harry hadn't actually spoken for the last fifteen minutes or so, just uttered noises of agreement where required as his two best friends bickered good-naturedly over who had worked harder.
"On that occasion, yes. I never saw him again. And since then I've mainly been with men rather than women, but nothing serious."
"I presumed you'd just give my note to him at lunchtime or something," said Harry. "What did you do instead?"
"Makes sense," Harry said. "But I'm glad you're here, whatever the reason. Actually, I haven't been up to the Astronomy Tower since we were students - I must come and see the view sometime. It
The crowd in the pub, it turned out, was thinking the same thing, and within a few minutes Draco's name was being chanted, until he stood up, bowed, and went over to have a quick word with the DJ before taking the mic.
to have you to protect me. I've been looking after myself perfectly well in the Muggle world. And I don't want to make
"I see," said Draco. "Well, that's just as well, because I didn't really feel comfortable giving her full access, after seeing how she behaves, but I would have, if you'd asked."
"You know bloody well I didn't," Harry semi-growled. "There was another one in the kitchen while I was waiting for the kettle to boil. After that, I was a bit sore, but I still ended up having a nice long one when I went to bed."
seats because she was by far the oldest member of the team, and in the process Joanne ended up sitting on Janet's knee, and the two of them thought this was the funniest thing
"As you're probably aware, I was an Auror until this time last year, as was my good friend Ron Weasley," he went on, nodding to Ron and receiving a grin in return, "but at that point we'd both been feeling for quite some time that it wasn't really what we wanted to be doing, and that there were probably other people who would be better at it than we were. But we'd never talked about it or done anything about it, until Draco Malfoy came back into our lives and we found ourselves talking about things that had been unspoken for too long." He beckoned Draco forward.
"Well, I actually thought of it during one of the choruses tonight," Harry said. "There was one that went
curse, but I can only do that for curses I know about. Although I do know about quite a lot of them."
"Couldn't have put it better myself," said Harry. "Thank you. Oh, and thank you for reassuring my kids, by the way. They all came up at lunchtime and told me that they felt much better at breakfast after you spoke to them. I'm so grateful that you did that without me asking you to – it only occurred to me after you'd already left this morning, and I felt terrible not to have thought of it sooner."
He scanned the audience as he took his seat at the front of the stage next to the conductor, and was pleased to see Harry and Hermione on the end of the second row, both applauding wildly. He grinned at them and settled back to listen to the orchestra play the overture, very conscious of the fact that he'd be the first soloist to sing, in a couple of minutes' time.
"Would you like me to ask the students to remain in their seats until you're ready?" asked McGonagall, who neither of them had noticed standing behind them.
Draco stared at the speaker, a blonde-haired third-year Ravenclaw girl. His day until now hadn't been as horrible as he'd feared: it had started with second-year Slytherins and Hufflepuffs, who were no trouble at all, and continued with fourth-year Gryffindors and Ravenclaws. That class, which was a bit more boisterous but still not
"Yes, yes and yes," said Draco. "It's never been a secret. In fact, I'm surprised you didn't know, since our sons are so close. Do gay people disgust you, then? I must say I never thought of you as the homophobic sort."
"A male alto," said Draco. "A man who sings really, really high notes. I'm sure they're all lovely people, but I don't like hearing them sing. Sorry, I'll stop ranting now."
Draco stared at him for a moment, and then beamed and kissed him. "I love you too," he said. "I hope you already knew that, but I'm glad we said it. And I kind of like the fact that you were buried deep inside me when we did."
"What are you doing?" called Draco. Harry let out a cry of triumph and reappeared, clutching a handful of shimmering fabric.
Harry grinned. "Well, yes," he said. "And I suspect I'm just as likely to do it as you, don't worry, so if I do... please remind me of this conversation."
"What?" said Draco. "Oh, my wander round the school. Yes, actually. McGonagall told me a couple of weeks ago how much of the place was never repaired after the war; I felt a bit ashamed that I'd never realised that. So I wanted to see which bits are intact and which aren't. I think I've been everywhere in the castle this afternoon. Well, everywhere except one place. I couldn't quite face going there."
"Draco!" she said. "Where have you been? Dinner will be ready soon. You mustn't let it go to waste. You know we're not as wealthy as we once were."
"I think I quite like the idea of him being my manager, actually," said Draco. "The other titles don't make him sound quite as important, and that wouldn't feel appropriate."
"Happier than we've ever seen him," agreed Hermione. "But the third fact is actually the most relevant right now. Most of you haven't heard Draco sing yet, so you're probably thinking it's a bit strange for Harry to be thinking of making a new career out of helping him. But we
"Ewww! Is that really how they do it? The non-magic version, I mean? It never occurred to me to wonder before. So people with hair transplants might actually have
"This road is just part of it," Harry explained. "There are eight parts of the market, but they're all in a relatively small area."
"But that's not enough," protested Harry. "He's exhausted. Isn't there anything that you can suggest to help
"Still only Wednesday," said Harry. "Wednesday teatime, though. We've been in this bed for the last twenty-four hours. Don't take this the wrong way, but... d'you think we should have a shower?"
Harry looked at Draco, and was relieved to see a smile on his face. Their eyes met, and Draco shrugged. "We
Harry laughed. "Yeah – even Hermione only wrote a few of them down. We all thought Sinistra would be furious, but she just rolled her eyes and said…"
Harry and Teddy looked at each other. "That sounds like a good plan. Thank you," said Harry. "Just give us the address and we'll be there. What time shall we arrive?"
"Now is fine," said Harry. "If you’re sure you don’t mind, that is. And, speaking of doing your job, I
Draco's face had remained impassive through all of this, but they were standing close enough together that Harry could feel the tension in him, and instinctively moved closer, wishing they hadn't agreed that it wouldn't look sufficiently professional if they held hands.
"Anyway, I did go to watch City a couple of times, just to compare, but they just weren’t as good," Draco went on. "Although they’ve done a lot better recently. Makes everything even more exciting, when we have some proper local rivals."
"Well, thank you," said Rabia. "Draco's a joy to play for – he's the best singer in the college – but I could've cursed him when he told me he was doing
"Well, I'm relieved to hear you say that," said Draco. "Now, I've been to breakfast, but that was hours ago – I didn't want to wake you, since you'd actually managed to get to sleep. I'm ready for my second breakfast, I think – d'you want to call that house-elf?"
Draco grabbed Harry's shoulders and deepened the kiss, leaving them both slightly breathless. "It's good to see you," he said. "Have you had a good evening?"
Draco smiled. "I like the sound of that," he said. "Can we start in the kitchen, though? I've got some biscuits in the oven, and I don't want to forget about them. They should be done soon."
"Remember that whole not talking about the past thing?" said Harry, but he was smiling. "Please don't call me Potter; it makes me think you're Malfoy, who I went to school with. You know, the one who hated me. Draco and Harry are different people."
"Yes, I've told him," Harry reported, giving Draco a quick hug and kiss. "He... well, he didn't say he
a few spaces in some of the rooms, of course, because some students didn't survive the war, but we felt that it would be too upsetting to rearrange the remaining students just to free up some more rooms. So we've opened up the guest rooms along the cloisters. They each have two beds, and that gives us just enough space to accommodate the eighth-years."
"David Bowie," Draco told him. "I'd recently discovered him, and was obsessed with his music – I still am – and that night I sang
"It'll help when we have the nurses," Draco pointed out, tilting his head so he could lick Harry's nipples. "We won't always have to go downstairs for meals."
"When, not if, I notice?" commented Draco. "I must admit it's kind of refreshing to flirt with someone who's so direct. Saves a lot of time. Although it's still possible that I'm dreaming all this, because I really never expected to be having this conversation with
"Well, Andromeda saw an advert that said that Harrods was opening a Department of Surprise & Delight for December, and that there would be 'unexpected moments of magic for all the family to enjoy'. Sounded nice enough for a four-year-old, so I agreed to bring him. But it turns out that their main 'moment of magic' involves face-painting, and that's a bit of a waste of time for a Metamorphmagus... Teddy kept asking what the point was, when he could just do it himself with no paint. Even so, I thought he might quite like it if he actually tried it, so I volunteered to have mine done first to encourage him... but he still refused."
share with you, and realised that probably no one else would want to. Sorry about that, but I don't think it should surprise you. But, the more I thought about it, the more I realised that I liked the idea of getting to know you now that we have no reason to fight. So that's actually the main reason I went ahead and offered."
Draco leapt out of the armchair, aghast. "What?! Potter, please. I really need the money. And... well, forgive me, but you don't look in any fit state to be teaching children. Or even
"Well, if you end up doing that with me I won't take it personally, don't worry. Anyway, you're going to be late for your Quidditch practice if you don't get a move on. When's the first match?"
"Well, if it's any consolation, they also all seemed pretty impressed by you," Draco said. "Plus, there's nothing that makes me hornier than you do, but it's definitely enhanced by people telling me not only how great I am, but also how great
“You went to school together but didn’t really get on - that was the gist,” Rabia said. “Oh, and he says he broke your nose in one of your fights, but that seems unlikely.”

it's mainly because he's Harry Potter. Whenever we have a new teacher, there are some kids who always try and see how much they can get away with, and there are some teachers who stamp that out straight away... and others who never really deal with it properly. They don't last long. But I don't remember
They bowed to each other solemnly, then stepped backwards several paces. Draco nodded to Professor McGonagall, who had slipped into the room to watch. Harry turned and grinned at her.
"I can't take time off to go gallivanting around the world!" Harry protested. "That would be very unprofessional. This week was the first time I missed any of my lessons, and that was only because the press conference was during the day. But I made sure everything was prepared for the people who covered the lessons that afternoon."
He started to walk again, but after a couple of steps he stopped for a second time, and grabbed a bit of his hair and attempted to sniff it. This would have been easier if it had still been as long as he'd let it get in the first couple of years after the war, but when he'd started his current job and discovered that he'd have to wear a hairnet if he kept it that length, he'd got it cut the next day. However, it was apparently still long enough to pick up the odour of the oil, because there was no doubt that his hair was the source of the smell that had caused him to interrupt his walk.
"She didn't," said Harry. "At least, not last night. I fell asleep in the armchair and woke this morning to find the house still empty. I thought that she must have gone straight from work to the camp – there was no reason she had to come home, of course. So I made some breakfast and planned to get a Portkey to the camp later and surprise her there. But she turned up while I was eating."
When Harry regained consciousness, it took him a minute to remember what had happened. There were voices talking quietly nearby, but no other noises, so he probably wasn't still in the bar. Also, it felt as if he was lying on a bed. And he could still feel Draco's hand on his arm.
He'd hoped to see Draco at the interval, but none of the musicians had emerged, so he'd sipped a glass of mulled wine while trying to answer Hermione's many questions (Harry was quite pleased that he knew lots of them): is the Hallelujah Chorus right at the end? why aren't all the soloists singing from memory like Draco is? why is the choir singing some bits from memory but not others? why are there no flutes or clarinets in the orchestra?
"That'd be lovely," said Draco. "Speaking of which, we haven't told Harry about your idea, have we?"
"I don't think I'm crying just because of that, though," said Harry, closing his eyes. "I'm just... I feel like such a failure at life. And I feel so
"Fair enough," said Harry again. "Draco it is. But only if you call me Harry. I get enough 'Potter!' at the Ministry."
"Yes, I've seen the look on your face when you're with Harry," said Hermione drily. "You've looked distracted for weeks."
Draco turned to her and smiled. "I don't think I'll need that long," he said. "Thank you. I'd be delighted to accept. I'll need to give my notice at Beauxbatons, of course, so I'd be grateful if you didn't announce it until I have. But there's nothing I'd like more than to be here."
"Give me a little more credit," Harry told him. "I have a plan! And I think it will work. But I'd just like to remind you that I'm very used to being stared at and, although it's not always pleasant, I find I can ignore it after a while. They soon get bored and move on. As for your more nightmarish scenarios, I'm pretty confident that nobody will dare to do any of those things if I'm standing right next to you. And, who knows - maybe they might not even want to anyway!"
Draco allowed the kiss to continue for a couple of minutes before he pulled away (he realised that he'd been a bit too enthusiastic about it to convince Harry that he was even slightly angry, but felt that he needed to make the point). "Not that I don't appreciate the thought," he murmured, "but don't you think this might have been a
"Quick pecks, yes, all the time. Saying hello and goodbye, that sort of thing. But proper snogging... Hmm. You know what? That's even longer ago. Wow. I can't even remember the last time we snogged. I know we did at our wedding, but... We
She nodded, wide-eyed, and Harry took a deep breath and waved his hand. “Occultis! … Expecto patronum!” The familiar white stag appeared, and Harry ignored Rabia’s gasp and told it: “To Hermione, please: I presume you’re on your way already on foot, but I need you here ASAP, please. I need to do whatever spell they use on those wizard tents, but I don’t know it and I presume it’s the same sort of thing as you used on that bag in the war. There’s a general apparition point by the postbox but from there you’ll be able to see the front door, which is where I am. There are loads of Muggles around, but I’ve done a concealment charm that should last for a while yet. Hurry, please!”
still owe Potter a life debt. "Look, I understand if you don't want to tell me, but I'm assuming that so far no-one else knows you're here?"
"That would be because I've always paid more attention to you than you might have thought," said Harry. "And, now that I've found you again, I plan to do a lot more of that, if you'll let me."
be able to sleep, but when I went back to bed I still couldn’t. I just lay there with my eyes shut until it was time to come to work."
Hermione was about to answer when Professor McGonagall swept back into the hall, so she settled for squeezing Ron's hand.
Harry beamed, as he finally allowed himself to believe that Draco might actually return his feelings. "Well, if you're sure," he said. "But it'll be at the top of my to-do list after you've measured me, just so you know. So... where do you want to start? Or do you want to clean up a bit first?"
Draco passed the note back to Harry. "I suppose it's good that she's worried about you, and seems to have realised she's an idiot," he said. "That's awkward about Thursday, though. D'you think you'll be able to cope with waiting four days?"
"Draco, you need to stop thanking me for things that you've already thanked me for," Harry advised. "Especially as most of them are things I would've done for anyone."
"It's a deal," said Draco, nodding. "Project Firstborn, I'm calling this in my head. Just so you know."
"Let's talk about something totally unrelated to any of this," said Hermione suddenly, after the four of them had walked in silence for ten minutes. "Draco, I've been meaning to ask you for ages: that night when I had my accident, and you found me... what were you doing in the area? I'm curious."
An hour later, the three Malfoys bundled themselves up in coats, scarves, jumpers, gloves and hats, and set off tor a walk . The tour of the house had indeed been quick: two rooms downstairs (living room and kitchen) and two bedrooms upstairs, one either side of the minuscule bathroom.
Draco looked at him, his eyes brimming with tears. "Harry, I'll do anything for you," he said. "There are so many songs I've already sung to you, and so many more that I haven't. But this is one I haven't done yet, and I think it fits the bill." He sat down at the piano, smiling at Beth as she moved aside.
"The house or the area?" asked Narcissa. "Although, actually the answer's the same either way. We're both slightly surprised to find that we love it. In hindsight, we should have moved out of the Manor years ago. It was much too big for us to keep up, especially since we're not allowed to have house-elves. And it was far too full of bad memories. I feel so much lighter, not being there any more."
"The next song is my last one, and it was originally a male/female duet," he told the audience. "So I've had to amend the words slightly, but it just has such a beautiful tune and gorgeous harmonies that I really wanted to include it. And it's a perfect encapsulation of my relationship with Harry. Thank you very much indeed for your support tonight - you've been amazing, and I'm humbled. This last song was originally sung by Billy Preston and Syreeta Wright, and it's called 'With You I'm Born Again'."
"Oh, for goodness' sake," said Harry. "The war is over. I wish people would remember that. Anyway, why didn't you ask anyone else for support? Someone at work? Why didn't you ask
"Well, if even half of the people from the press conference turn up, this room will be pretty full," Harry pointed out. "Where will they sit, if they do?"
Draco nodded and picked up his rucksack. "Mother! Father! We're off now," he called, rejoining Harry at the front door.
"The fact that they're holding hands under the table might give you a bit of a clue," Lucius told her. "I suspect they… well, got to know each other properly."
doing. And even if it wasn't, I'd be happy to do it for you. The fact that I like it is just a bonus."
"Probably dashed into the bedroom to hide when she realised it wasn't just me," said Draco. "Hang on a second while I get her." He returned a moment later with the cat cradled in his arms, and stood still so that Harry could have a look at her.
“It feels back to normal,” Draco told her. “I can’t thank you enough for your help. It would have got there on its own, but not in time for tomorrow if it hadn’t been for you.”
"Deal," agreed Draco. "If either of us uses the word 'scar', the other immediately says it's time for us to leave, and we get out of there."
"I keep telling her that there'll be enough for them even if the whole of the wizarding population comes to eat first, but you know what she's like," said Arthur, wiping his mouth. "It's good to see you again, Draco. And I need to talk to you about a fascinating thing that Ron said was called a Blue Mouth? Sounds ingenious. Do you have it with you?"
"Yes, they will," Harry told him firmly. "I haven't seen them since... well, since we got together, but I know they know about us, and they're happy that I'm happy."
He realised that he could easily stare at Harry's muscles for hours, and decided he'd better do the decent thing and admit that he was there. He coughed.
Malfoy flashed a grin at him and opened his trunk. "I wish there was an unpacking spell," he said, as he started putting clothes into the wardrobe next to his bed. "I once tried to get 'Unpack!' to work, but nothing happened. I suppose the 'Pack!' spell only works because all the things are going into one place."
impressive cock – jutting proudly out of a small thatch of dark hair. As Draco stared at it, Harry started to stroke it, gently at first but getting gradually firmer.
"Oh, I'm sorry – didn't I leave copies of them with the lesson plans? I thought I had," said Harry, frowning.
"Yes, it seemed like a good time for a change of scene. We suspected that if we'd stayed in England there would have been unpleasantness whenever we went out. As it turned out, we did occasionally get curses thrown at us when we went to the wizarding district of Paris, but I think it would have been much worse in London."
"I know," said Harry. "I just have a nasty feeling she might take it out on you, and I don't want that to happen."
. Maybe it was because Draco had casually mentioned his sexuality. Harry suspected that it was more than that, though; it was true that he'd admired Draco's looks at school, yet he hadn't known till today that Draco was gay. He didn't think he'd ever imagined him
"I’m sure Carole would be thrilled to be asked," said Hermione. "But you should probably have a word with Helen first to check she won’t be upset."
why you're doing this," said Malfoy. "All right. That makes sense, I suppose. I'm happy to be the... well, I was going to say 'dark side mascot', but that makes it sound like I'm still Dark, and I'm really not. But you know what I mean."
"It was," agreed Draco. "Your memories are fresher than mine, though. I haven't been back since the Battle."
"Those are because of the concert, I think," said Draco, when Harry commented on this. "The theme is romance. Which actually makes it strange that they've picked this room, now that I think about it. There are other rooms with far more romantic paintings than this."
? He tentatively smiled back, at which Hermione hugged him, much to his surprise. He hugged her back, allowing his arms to tighten just enough to show that he was sincere.
Just then, a nurse wandered past and, in answer to their questions, explained that Hermione had gone to the plaster room but would be back soon, and would then be discharged. True enough, she reappeared ten minutes later in a wheelchair being pushed by an orderly. Her left wrist and forearm were encased in plaster, as was the whole lower half of her right leg, from knee to toes.
Draco stared at him for a moment, and then nodded slowly. "My gaydar is terrible," he said. "I can never tell which way anyone swings unless they tell me. Or, you know, start groping me or something."
Harry winked at her, laughing giddily. "Glad to be of service," he shouted. "Now, does anyone have any objection to us just walking off while they're still clapping? I have some important fucking to do."
Harry choked on his beer. "You've used the internet," he stated, when he regained control of his voice. "You – LUCIUS MALFOY – have a computer. Unless you went to a library to use one? No, if you had you could have looked in a book. You
"That's what I always tell him," said Hermione. "But he always just says he likes Yorkshire puddings and there's no law against it."
"You're very welcome to, though, any time you feel the urge," said Draco, stepping back and gazing at Harry's body again. He noted that Harry's cock was already half-hard again, and gave it an experimental grope.
"It's probably best I don't show you the contents of my pockets, then, or you might die of shock," said Draco.
"Not so far," admitted Harry. "But I thought I'd start with Oliver - I think he would understand. The trouble is that I don't feel comfortable just pulling out completely, because I have already said I'll be part of the campaign, but if I say I need to renegotiate the terms I suspect Oliver will end up getting pressured to get me to stick to doing everything."
Harry turned to stare at him with a concerned face. "I don't get it," he said. "I could understand it if you were still obnoxious, but you're nice now. And… well, even when you were obnoxious, you can't have had any trouble finding partners. I mean, look at you."
A streak of light shot down the alley towards them, coalescing in front of Harry into a bright silver fox. "Everything's all ready to go," it said quietly, in Seamus's voice. "Don't send your Patronus back unless you want to spoil the surprise - I'm standing right by the Knockturn Alley entrance and there are lots of people around, and everyone knows your stag. Actually, you'd better send it if you're not here yet. But assuming you're at the usual apparition point, I'll watch out for you appearing near Ollivanders in the next few minutes, and I'll start things off exactly two minutes after I first see you. That should give people enough time to notice you before I distract them."
"No. But that's not unusual – she usually works until at least eight or nine o'clock these days. Her hours were shorter when she was just a reporter, but when I left the Aurors she got the head of department job. I felt a bit bad, actually, when I found out that she'd wanted it for years but never applied earlier because she thought one of us had better be around in the evenings for the kids."
Seamus tilted his head looked at him. "You know what? We've known each other for, what, thirteen years? And in all that time I don't think I can
look like a wet dream in your coat, snowflakes or no snowflakes. It really brings out the amazingness of your hair."
"Look at this," said Harry, twenty or so meteors later; he pointed as if Draco could actually see his arm. "I can see a mega-constellation. Imagine a line starting from Procyon, going through Castor and Pollux, and then on to Capella and down to Aldebaran, before going back up to Perseus and Cassiopeia and finally down to Aries."
. I hated it when I was just an ordinary Auror, so when I became Head Auror I made it my mission to reduce the number of reports that Aurors had to write and forms they had to fill in. It did get better for
means Elf King – well, not exactly, but that's the usual English translation. It's a brilliant song, but it's incredibly difficult for both the singer and the pianist."
"You're full of good ideas tonight!" said Harry. "Yes, absolutely. Undressing each other sounds like fun. Even more fun than I expected there'd be tonight, if I'm honest."
"It does matter! Especially if it was my fault! Because I don't want to cause that feeling ever again! So please tell me what I did." Harry drew back slightly so he could see Draco's face.
"Good afternoon, Mr & Mrs Malfoy," she said when she arrived, but they didn't respond. She smiled sympathetically at Draco.
and, after a year of absorbing all sorts of music via Draco, he had a much better idea of what was good and what wasn't.
theoretically heated, the system was so old that it often malfunctioned; however, he had promised that the central core of the cathedral, where the press conference was to be held shortly, was nice and warm.
"Unfortunately, yes," said Draco. "And I hope it makes sense now – why I really need to stay here rather than at your house. I can't leave them. But if you'd be too uncomfortable here, I'll try and think of something."

in bed for many years (since Lily was born, in fact, he realised as he thought about it), so when he'd started his new career as a teacher, and found himself working even later into the evening than he'd had to as an Auror, he'd fallen asleep in his Hogwarts quarters so many times that in the end he'd given up even
Lucius smiled widely at this news. "I am very pleased to hear that," he said. "Now, sit down. Full English breakfast coming right up. Here's coffee and toast to keep you going in the meantime. Now, tell us everything. What did you do last night?"
Scorpius stood up, pulled Draco up out of his seat, and flung his arms round him. Draco, startled but happy, gripped his son tightly for a minute, before kissing him on the forehead. Scorpius hugged him once more, briefly, as he gestured to the waiter that they were ready to settle the bill. When the man came over, he had another piece of parchment.
Draco opened the huge doors they'd just reached, and they stepped into the ballroom. Harry found himself smiling with delight, because the room was beautiful. It was almost as big as the Great Hall at Hogwarts, but had two rows of pillars running through it. The ceiling was high enough that the room must be two storeys high, and tall bay windows ran along the far wall. A grand piano stood in the far corner of the room, and Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy were sitting nearby, in two armchairs facing one of the bay windows. Neither of them reacted, however, when Draco and Harry entered the room.
Draco mentally castigated his unhelpful brain for the jolt it produced at 'do it', and considered. He
Malfoy's hair was quite a bit longer than it had been at the trials – hence Harry not noticing the earbuds until he was closer – but otherwise he didn't look any different. He was dressed in all black, including an artfully-draped scarf, and looked effortlessly elegant – and slightly out of place in a busy Starbucks in Knightsbridge.
of come and then licked Draco's cock clean, he felt Draco's whole body trembling and moved up the bed to look at his face. "Are you cold?" he asked, concerned. "Here, let's get the duvet over you."
Harry felt his face redden, but it was Draco who responded. "Look, Ron, I really appreciate your help with all this – you being here has definitely made things a lot easier – but I think that's something Harry and I would be better discussing in private. And it can wait – it's not the most urgent thing we need to sort out, is it?"
"Not since… we last saw you," said Narcissa. "That was one of the conditions. It took us a while to learn, but we both enjoy cooking now, although Lucius does more of it than I do. He makes a particularly excellent chicken and mushroom pie, which I suspect may well be making an appearance tonight."
tell you. Just not right now, because it's a slightly longer story than we have time for at the moment."
"I agree," said Draco. "We always have had, although until now it wasn't always a positive connection, sadly."
Draco gestured towards the smaller of the two windows in the room, through which could be seen a snow-covered building in the distance. "You see that clock tower over there? Do you somehow think that the fact you can see it from you window gives you some sort of special power over time? Or... wait, you haven't been using a Time-Turner, have you? I thought they were all destroyed."
Albus flushed slightly. "I know," he said apologetically. "I thought it'd be easier just to tell you when you got here."
"I feel a bit of an idiot being the cause of all this worry," Harry admitted. "But I really am grateful to all of you for trying to help, even if it ends up not working."
"Well, to be fair, it was raining even harder than this in London when we left, wasn't it?" Harry pointed out. "I made a comment last week about it always raining in Manchester. Nearly got my head bitten off by the local Aurors. I think it's a bit of a sore point with them."
"We is cooking chicken in mushroom sauce, with pasta, if it pleases Master Draco," said Woopy. "And it can be being ready in five minutes."
"So what’s he like these days? I was about to ask if he was still the same arrogant prat he was at school, but actually he wasn’t at all like that the last time I spoke to him. Which was… let’s see, fifteen years ago? At his trial."
haven't forgotten, but that doesn't mean I have any ill will towards you. I'd already forgiven you by the time I saw you at your trial, as I think I told you at the time. And, even if I hadn't, I can tell from talking to you that you're a different person now. And I'm enjoying talking to you, and I do wish we'd done this years ago."
After a moment, Draco nodded without meeting Harry’s gaze, although Harry was delighted to notice a very slight flush on his cheeks. They walked along for a few minutes in a companionable silence, during which Harry was very conscious of the feel of Draco’s hand in his. He had always imagined Draco’s skin to be very cold, due to its paleness, but in fact the hand was surprisingly warm. (Harry chose not to analyse when and why he’d previously thought about the temperature of Draco’s skin.) It was just as smooth as he’d expected, though, and made Harry all the more conscious of the rough skin on his own hands.
Draco shifted slightly, reminding Harry that his exploration had only just started. He was very tempted to continue kissing Draco forever, but the thought that there might be even
to stop this," said Harry after a few minutes, "but I told Ron we'd be there just after 6. Are you ready to go? We'll continue this later, I promise."
at the time, but didn't do anything about it at the time. It was prompted by the fact that the English Football Association were bidding to bring the 2018 World Cup to England. The bid was announced in 2007 and officially launched in 2009, and they spent most of 2010 travelling to various places trying to get other countries to like them and vote for them. Typically, they
"I’m thinking that it’s very odd that it feels so natural for you to be here in my flat, and that you look… well, you always looked good, but now you look a lot better. And that the gobsmacked look on your face is extremely amusing."
"I know what you mean," Harry said. "I think it's the scale of it. True, it's just grass, but it looks as if it goes on forever. And having hills in the distance adds to the effect, doesn't it?"
"After that, let's sit down and start our brainstorming, shall we? You promised a year ago that you were going to solve my life crisis, and you did... it feels a bit of a cheek to expect you to do it again! But at least I know I'm working with someone with a proven success rate."
"I'm so sorry, Harry, Draco," said Teddy, who had been hanging back until now. "He asked me to bring him here when I told him you were together. I thought he just wanted to come and say hello. Erm, are you two naked in there?"
"My parents are huge fans," Hermione explained. "They've got all the DVDs. And every time I visit they have loads of questions for me about whether or not such and such a spell is realistic. I've actually seen every episode, up to about three weeks ago – that's the last time I visited. We don't have a TV here."
"Thanks," said Draco. "Although now you've removed my excuse for suggesting that we take our clothes off."
After a few months of this, the family had decided that they needed a change and, after requesting and receiving permission for Lucius to change residence, they sold the Manor and moved to a Spanish villa that had been in the family for many years. Draco had a set of rooms there, but he spent most of his time living at his current Hyde Park Corner flat, which not only had great views but was also very convenient for his job.
The following lunchtime, Harry was pleased with himself for actually making it to the Great Hall while food was still being served. He sank into the only empty chair at the staff table, on the end next to Padma Patil, and Kreacher, who had been at Hogwarts ever since Harry had sold Grimmauld Place, immediately appeared and started putting plates and cutlery in front of him. Harry nodded at him in thanks.
"Yeah. Dad said we'd better go and tell them while he and Mum went to tell Uncle Ron and Auntie Hermione. He told me that he'd asked you to tell Score, so I came back here to wait for you. He said to tell you that he'll be back as soon as he can, but definitely tonight."
"That seems odd, but I'll believe you," said Harry. "And what was it you were saying about having to memorise it?"
"Us too," said Narcissa. "So that was, what, seventeen years ago? I would have thought he might have got some different glasses by now. But that definitely looks like him."
Harry began undoing Draco's bootlaces. "I figure that if I'm going to have to wait a while to undress you completely, I can at least start the process now," he explained. "You weren't planning on going to bed with your boots still on, were you?"
"He's great, actually," said Harry, slightly shocked to realise how much he meant it. "I've spent quite a bit of time with him this week, and we're getting on really well. In fact, he's been really helpful, and it's mainly because of him that I think I might be able to improve my deal with the Ministry."
, unprompted, fully accepted me. So, on the one hand I'm delighted we're getting on so well, but on the other I have to make a decision."
such a curse, I’d have encountered it by now," he said. "Although… actually, maybe not. In all the time I’ve been an Auror, I don’t think a month has gone by without some criminal coming up with some new way to be nasty."
"Well, if you ever change your mind, let us know and we'll come and cheer you on," said Ron. "But we'd better let you get some rest now. I know you said you were tired, and that was ages ago."
"I'm not sure," said Draco. "Monday's the only day you have no free periods, so it might be a bit manic. I'll definitely
"Oh well," said Hermione. "Don't feel you have to eat them. It's true: they're not that nice. What a disappointment!"
Hermione pointed her wand. "Lumos singulis," she said, and the fairy lights immediately lit up in assorted colours. She and Ron both applauded.
Harry stood motionless in the garden, too shocked to move. After a minute or two, he looked down at himself, and then laughed quietly. He wasn't sure whether he was laughing because he'd actually looked to check he wasn't invisible, or because he
"But I don't understand," said Narcissa. "Who was it that made you cook for them? That sounds awful."
Harry stepped out of the fireplace at his home in Devon, feeling slightly queasy. Partly this was because of his aversion to Floo travel, which had diminished over the years but never quite gone away; mostly, however, he was worrying about what reception he'd get from Ginny when she saw him.
"That's thoughtful of you," said Harry. "I wonder if she's spoken to the press already? She may well have done. Anyway, I bet I can guess what their first question will be to us."
"Thank you. You're a useful person to have around," he said. "I'm far too paranoid to ever use my wand when I'm in the Muggle, but I can't do anything without it. Can you do lots of wandless magic, or is it just certain spells?"
The stadium was so big that for a moment Harry thought it might take him a while to find the way in, but then he spotted a helpful sign which said "ENTRADA"; he followed the arrow to the left and eventually found the main gate, protected by a heavy barred gate and several security guards. His heart sank a little, but he gritted his teeth and approached them.
Harry's heart sank, and Hermione winced. "It was actually worse at King's Cross than on the train," said Ron. "At least we could shut the door on them when we were in our carriage. At the station, we could hardly move for people surrounding us."
got something planned. Which particular plan are you curious about, though?" asked George, who had appeared the moment they stepped into the shop. Harry, not for the first time, wondered whether George had some sort of spell that enabled him to do this.
“Well, I’m not sure how well I’ll be able to concentrate now that I’m thinking about BLOODY WIZARDS,” she said, “but I’ll try my best. I must say I’m a bit disappointed you haven’t got a magic wand, though.”
"It wasn't easy," admitted Draco. "But I didn't do it suddenly. Remember, I had nothing else to occupy my time at that point, and I couldn't really leave the house
"She wasn't, really, as it turned out. But you know how it is when you're a teenager and you fancy someone for the first time, and you can't think of anything other than what they look like."
"It'll be fine, don't worry," said Draco, taking his hand and apparently reading his mind. "Most of it won't be a total surprise to them, remember. There were enough people at my recital last year - thanks to you - that me singing won't be news. And they all know we're together, thanks to Rita Skeeter."
Draco could resist it no longer: he stepped forward and took Harry into his arms. After a moment, Harry lifted his arms and wrapped them round Draco's back, and they just stood there; Draco was very slightly taller, and Harry's bowed head fitted perfectly into the crook of his neck, while Draco ran his fingers soothingly through Harry's hair.
"Cheeky whippersnapper," said Lucius, pouring soup into a bowl and passing it to Draco. "I'm very good at soup, I'll have you know. I made this one from scratch. And your mother made the pie."
"My apologies for keeping you all waiting so long," said McGonagall. "Thank you for your patience. Now, as I explained earlier, we have ten rooms awaiting you in the cloisters, so all that remains is to agree on who's sharing with whom."
still a bit confused about what happened, actually," said Hermione. "So I'm not surprised if she is too. I definitely thought the two of you would be together at this point. When did you change your mind?"
"I never thought of that! Of course it is! Wow, I’m so thick," said Harry. He looked at the golden horn pendant for a moment before putting it on. "Thank you for this, too," he said. "It’s really thoughtful of you. I love it."
Draco nodded. "Maybe, but even that's a bit unusual," he said. "By the time you're at music college entry level, you're expected to be a pretty high standard already. Anyway, whatever the reason, they did let me in, and my life started to improve from that point. The more I sang, the more I felt better about myself. And the course made us all perform regularly – just small events at first, but the amount of time on stage gradually increased. Then, at the end of my second year, I got the chance to sing Gerontius."
Harry took hold of both of Draco's hands and they finished the chorus together: "OHHHHHHH, VIENNAAAAAAAAAA!"
"Owl from Ginny," said Harry, unrolling it and reading. His eyes widened. "She says... She says she's found a way to break the bond."
"I'm glad you think so, because I'm not even halfway through," said Draco. "That's just as well, though, because your skin feels even more amazing, so I'd quite like to touch it as much as possible, if that's alright with you?"
"I'm sorry too," said Hermione. "I didn't realise he'd gone until it was too late, or I would have stopped him, or at least come with him. But we've talked since, and he's OK with things now, I promise you. Draco, forgive me for not saying so before, but it's lovely to see you. Teddy says you're living in Italy? I've always wanted to go there."
Harry walked into the Great Hall the following morning in a bit of a daze. Draco, strolling alongside him impassively, had merely nodded at the various students who'd greeted Harry with delight on their way to the hall, but he gave Harry a quick private smile and squeezed his hand before they entered.
"Somerset House? For the ice rink? Well, the nearest tube is actually Temple, on the District and Circle lines, but it's not much further from Covent Garden, Charing Cross or Embankment. Or Waterloo or Blackfriars, for that matter."
"Oh, don't be ridiculous, Ron," said Hermione. "I've seen Harry naked loads of times. Although not for a few years, and never quite so, er, aroused as that," she added, as Harry pulled down his boxer briefs.
Oliver laughed. "Oh, Harry, you are too good," he said. "That's exactly how you ended up here today! But there
Harry smiled, and was about to answer when a large silver bird floated through the ice-covered window behind Ron's head. The bird landed on the table in front of Harry.
Draco was considerably encouraged by the fact that Harry didn't seem to have been deterred by his erection, but he couldn't stop his jaw dropping when Harry took off his jeans and it became obvious that he was just as hard as Draco. By the time Harry pulled off his own underwear, Draco no longer felt guilty for staring: all his thoughts were occupied by Harry's cock. It was even more impressive than he'd dreamed. That trail of hair leading down Harry's belly had featured in many of Draco's daydreams since he'd seen it, so he felt as if he'd reached the end of a treasure hunt now he'd finally seen what it led to. It widened significantly as it got lower, culminating in a fairly small rectangular patch of black hair, from which Harry's larger-than-expected cock strained upwards, reaching slightly higher than his belly button. The various veins on the underside were prominent, and the largest of them ended just above Harry's balls.
"Draco, they're going to love you, I'm positive," said Harry. "And when I told them I was bringing you, their reaction was exactly as I expected."
"You do know they haven't thought of you like that in years, don't you?" said Harry, putting his glass down and turning to face Draco in the flickering light.
Draco nodded. "I'm very lucky in that respect. Astoria does love Scorpius, but she suggested that he might feel more comfortable spending most of his holiday time with me, rather than feeling like a third wheel with her and her new husband. He's visited them once or twice, but he does always seem relieved when he can come home."
persuade me that you were right, though, when you talked me out of going to find the kids. It's not a good idea for me to be with people when I'm wound up. I scarred you for life twenty years ago, and I nearly hurt you again today. I'd never forgive myself if I ever hurt any of them."
"Haha, no," said Harry. "I just thought of it while I was waiting for you. "Why we're here is... well, mainly because it's a really long time since I was on a proper date, and I am particularly invested in this one going well, so I wanted us to go somewhere memorable. And when I was talking to Viktor Krum at the Moscow thing, he mentioned he'd enjoyed a trip here recently."
"You know I haven't," said Harry. "That does sound fun, though - let's do it. Will it be a boat like this one? That'd be
contacted me earlier about it, but there's still time to act on it. I just need to speak to the staff and relevant portraits to warn them, and then amend my opening speech to the students."
“Um, let’s see - I have a security meeting at Gringotts at four o’clock, but those don’t usually take long, so I should be home by six. Oh no! Wait, I forgot.”
pay for extra time," he told the offending game. "Stupid thing. Why do I always only see the damn object just when the time's about to run out?" He sighed and started searching the observatory again.
Harry sighed. "There's one thing I didn't tell McGonagall, you know," he said. "My main argument for you staying was that it'll be good for the kids to have a week of team teaching, and I really believe it will. I also told her why you really need the money – I hope that's OK, I know she'll keep it to herself. But I didn't tell her the
"Tell him I could be persuaded," said Draco, his eyes dancing with amusement; a minute later, they were racing up the stairs, hand in hand.
"Posh git," said Harry, impressed. "So what happened to all the books when you sold the Manor? Did you just leave them there?"
"I do feel a bit sorry for Puddlemere, though," said Gwenog. "It was their biggest ever defeat. But it serves them right for stealing our top scorer!"
"Of course," said Ron, and Hermione nodded and got up, looking nervous but resolute. After bidding farewell to Arthur and Molly, the four of them Apparated to Malfoy Manor. This proved a bit tricky, as Harry and Draco each had to Side-Along one of the others, and that involved touching; after a quick conference, though, they decided that they could both cope with a couple of seconds of pain if it meant getting to sleep earlier. Neither of them felt like walking all the way up the drive for the second time that day.
"Well, you're not supposed to be able to side-along at all over that distance," Draco pointed out. "I think you can be forgiven for it being a strain. Now, are you going to tell me where we are, or is guessing part of the surprise?"
Harry grinned. "As a matter of fact it was," he said. "But it's been raining across the whole country for weeks, hasn't it? Except for that snow that we've had in the last few days."
"I’ve given up trying to work out how owls do what they do," said Hermione. "And particularly this one. She’s the fastest one I’ve ever had." She went over to take the scroll from the owl’s leg. "OK, he says he’d be happy to try and help. He’s adjusted his wards so you can use his fireplace. The address is Apartment 4606, Beetham Tower, Manchester. Do you want me to come with you?"
"Let me check with Hermione before you do that - she might enjoy it too," said Harry. "And maybe some of the others too?"
"Right after his trial," Ron told him. "When you were standing watching him walk away. She said something like 'that's not the last we've seen of Malfoy – he'll always be a big part of Harry's life – in fact, I can see them as a couple'. I told her she was mad. Actually, now I think back, that was the first time she ever said anything about you being gay. I told her she was mad about that, too."
Draco stood up. "I'm not going to deny that I've always wanted to kiss you," he said. "So yes, but only if we do it properly. It'd be very awkward to do it in these chairs."
"My parents decided to start the new year by going to live in our villa in Italy – they’d had enough of the English weather – and Julian assumed I’d be moving back to the Manor. We’d been there a few times to visit them, of course, and it seems that Julian was looking forward to living there after we were married. When I explained – again – that I’d moved up here because I had such bad memories of that place, and had no intention of ever living there again, he… well, there was quite a row, and he moved out that very night. I’ve seen him out on the town once or twice since, but we haven’t spoken."
Lucius opened the door, and they were immediately hit by a wave of warmth and chatter. The café was surprisingly full, given the relative lack of people in the square outside, and at first glance there didn't appear to be any empty tables.
"Erm... I was about to ask you the same thing," he admitted, throwing caution to the wind and going with his gut feeling. "I sleep naked too. I don't actually own any pyjamas. I'm... I think I'd be OK if we were both naked? I mean, if you're OK with that? It's fine either way."

The house tour had been good, though; Draco remembered some of the portraits and furniture from his childhood, and Harry had found all sorts of items that he'd been looking for but believed to be lost. Most useful among these was his invisibility cloak: he
seem unlikely that he would be that lucky) then he would much rather have Harry as a friend than go back to them being little more than strangers.
They both stared at him in amazement, but Weasley pulled himself together more quickly than Granger (thus causing Draco to lose a bet he'd just made in his head). "Malfoy," he said. "Is it OK if we come in, please? We'd like to talk to you about Harry."
Harry grinned. "Well, I have to say that I think that's the nicest – and most surprising – thing anyone's ever said to me," he said. "Look, you know I already told you I haven't really thought seriously about anyone other than Ginny before yesterday. But, truth be told, I have always thought of you as the best-looking bloke I've ever known, if that counts? I'm not saying it would ever have occurred to me to do anything about it – it was just a sort of accepted fact that's been in my head for years. And now I know that you actually have a good heart too... well, there will be wanks with you in mind in my future, I can assure you."
"I really think he'll listen," said Hermione. "I can't promise he won't give you a hard time, but I think he'll give you the benefit of the doubt. And I do think he'll come with you, and then you'll be able to get back to your life. I do appreciate you doing all this for me, you know. And I do want to find out what you've been doing since the war, but please will you go and see Harry first? The nurse told me that I'll be in plaster for six weeks at least, so I'm a bit keen to get some magical healing."
. He doesn't say very much about you at all, actually. Which is a little odd, now that I think about it, because he's spent lots of time at your house, hasn't he?"
"That seems wise," said Harry. "But I'm quite surprised to find that you can name more things you miss about the Ministry than things you like at the shop."
"OK, sit on your chair a minute. And shine this torch on your feet," said Harry, when everything was set up. Draco, puzzled, did so.
Draco frowned. "I thought you knew me better than that," he said. "Of course I haven't told anyone. But I didn't mean
"I haven't been to Hogwarts in ages," Harry mused. "Certainly not this year. I think the last time I was there was for a security meeting for the last Triwizard Tournament. I'd love to visit, actually. Particularly in winter. It was always so
"What, you mean apart from the fact that you've been talking about him for the last five years? Wait... the last
Harry winced. "I don't think I can face them just yet," he said. "Especially as the news will be in the
An hour later, he found himself sitting by Hermione's hospital bed, in conversation with a harassed-looking doctor who couldn't have been more than twelve years old, Draco thought. "She'll need to stay in overnight, at least," was the man's verdict. "She has a Colles fracture to her wrist – the surgeon will be coming to check it at some point, but I think he'll say that it won't need surgery – and her ankle is badly sprained but not broken. Even so, we'd send her home with temporary dressings and painkillers, but she banged her head when she fell, so we need to do neuro obs to rule out a brain bleed. In the morning, if the obs are all fine, we'll plaster her wrist and her ankle and she can go home. I understand you're not her partner – does she have someone at home that can help her? She won't be able to do much on her own for a while."
"Only if you promise we can meet again tomorrow, and continue from where we left off," said Harry. "Apart from anything else, we promised to visit Hermione.
"I need to get the main course out of the oven too," said Draco. "It'll be ready now." He quickly swallowed the rest of his soup before going over to the kitchen. He paused as he reached the door, though. "Harry, come over here and look! It's started snowing again!"
Harry's cock twitched again at this, and Draco wriggled slightly against it, although Harry wasn't sure whether or not he did this consciously. "So you are... "
I have no idea where my parents are getting these ridiculous ideas from." He grinned, however, and Harry kissed him.
The urban legend referred to is the fact that it’s a commonly-held belief among English people that Manchester United fans do not live in Manchester, and that all football fans who
"Truly you are the Saviour," said Draco, grinning. He removed the last of his clothing and lay back on the bed.
"It was quite frustrating, actually. All those years I spent trying to get Harry to help with the research, and then it turned out that the way to get him into a library was to get Draco Malfoy to go and live on a remote island in the middle of what the Muggles thought was a nuclear test area. Which, by the way, still seems like a bit of a bizarre thing for you to do."
"Hmmm.... speaking of being open about it, we should discuss what we're going to say to the reporters when they inevitably start pestering us," said Harry.
"Nineish sounds fine," said Ron. "Better not leave it much later, anyway, because if we haven’t found any evidence by two o’clock we’ll have to release him. Our three days expire then."
Draco was starting to develop his own theory as to why Harry's marriage had been like this, but he wasn't sure how much of it was wishful thinking, so he put it to the back of his mind until further evidence presented itself. "Maybe the two of you just aren't sexually compatible," he said. "It does happen. What about your partners
"I look forward to hearing them," said Harry. "Remember, though, if you use one you've already used, I win."
Draco smiled at him again at this, and Neville stared at them both searchingly. "So I see," he said after a moment, grinning. "Who'd have thought it? Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy, the best of friends."
the only person who hadn't noticed," said Harry. "James told me a few weeks ago that he'd noticed that Ginny and I never talk to each other unless the kids are there. That's what started me thinking about our marriage, and made me realised I was making a mess of things and I'd better do something to fix it."
good about it, though, or it wouldn't be so popular. I wonder if they've got any here?" mused Harry. He leapt from his seat and went over to the counter, where the bored-looking barista was wiping the surfaces.
Albus turned out to be in his bedroom, in fact: he was sprawled full-length on his bed with his eyes shut. He wasn't asleep, however, and he wasn't alone: Scorpius Malfoy was sitting next to his head, legs stretched out in front of him and back propped against the headboard. Harry strained to hear what they were talking about, feeling slightly guilty for eavesdropping, but not guilty enough not to do it.
"We do, apparently," said Draco, grinning. He started to play a lively chord sequence on the piano. "I didn't quite dare sing this one before, because it was a bit presumptuous, but in light of what you've just said..."
"Well, if you did, at least it was an appropriate response," Draco pointed out. "It's not as if you smiled and nodded when they'd actually just told you that their... that they'd lost their job or something."
"If I could have found any way to avoid it, I would have," said Draco. "I was about to say 'it was only Imperius', but I understand why it's still Unforgivable. I always
"I feel fine," said Harry, smiling at him reassuringly. "I'm just glad everything's sorted out and Ginny and I can both move on. And Draco has been looking after me."
"Was it something I said?" he asked it, oddly affronted. It stared back at him – if he'd had to come up with a word to describe that stare, he might have said 'baleful' – and then jumped off the fence and walked along the pavement. Harry was about to give it one last stroke and resume his journey when he realised that the cat had stopped again and was looking over its shoulder at him.
Molly smiled sadly at him and led the way to the kitchen. 'Everyone' turned out to be Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Arthur; Harry was relieved to see that Ginny appeared quite calm, and she even gave him a little smile.
"Draco, this is… Well, look," said Harry quietly, taking hold of both Draco's hands. "I can't promise nothing will go wrong. But I
"Hmm. That's a good point," said Draco. "In the meantime, though, we should sleep. Let's see if there's anywhere around here we can Apparate from."
Harry flushed slightly. "I think he's probably referring to that first Wednesday, when we spent the whole day in bed," he admitted. "You had the day off, remember, but
badly to Draco's unplanned revelation about the gossip regarding his childhood. But he was worried now. The good mood had vanished in a split second when Harry had looked at the parchment in his hand; all of a sudden, his posture was... well,
