Instead of further protesting, Harry chose to steer the subject of the conversation into more comfortable areas like how George and Angelina's kids are doing, if Ron and Hermione ever plan on having kids anytime soon, when they're going to visit Bill and Fleur, and other life updates. The four of them ate and chat until it was past noon. The couple bid the Aurors goodbye with the latter pair promising that they'll get back to George as soon as the necessary permits are in order.
Harry read and re-read the letter thrice. It was indeed addressed to Draco Malfoy and he is being offered a teaching position at Hogwarts. It was dated exactly two days ago which means Malfoy only had today to send in his response.
Finally, the Auror office got a report last night of another missing wizard. William Proudfoot, 25, was a security guard at Gringotts. He and his partner, Brian Cole were on their way to the Leaky Cauldron to get a pint after their shift when Proudfoot just disappeared from Cole's side while the latter got distracted by the display at Quality Quidditch Supplies. According to Cole, he was just admiring the newly released HyperSweep 5000 but, when he turned to talk to Proudfoot, he found nothing but empty space beside him. He didn't know where his partner went because he didn't hear the "crack" that resulted from apparating. He highly doubts that there's a Portkey nearby.
"Uh…no, sorry."
And while it's true that he has no plans of returning to Britain, he thinks that maybe now is the time to let people from his past back into his life.
"Yes, sir. We have gathered items that belonged to the victims in hopes of familiarizing ourselves with their signatures. If I am not mistaken, that arm belongs to trainee Hit Wizard Michael Quinn," He confirmed. "However, a severed arm does not indicate a victim's death. For all we know, he's still being held captive. But, we also cannot rule out the high possibility of the rest of his body suffering the same fate as this particular limb did."
Parkinson chuckled humorlessly at the memory. Harry said nothing, respecting her need to organize her thoughts before continuing.
Apparently, anything is possible these days because right here in this small peaceful farm is where they found the rotting head of Hubert Walters, the loud patron from The Crystal who went missing several days after Harry and Ron's visit.
"If…if you think that I'm going to drag you back to Britain, I'm not. The Ministry doesn't even know I'm here."
"Luna's suggestion. Apparently the smell of flowers help their nerves." Harry explained before he caught sight of a familiar handwriting on one of the envelopes that Draco is filing through. "Wait, is that a letter from Hermione?"
With a wave of his wand, Charles sent copies of his case file to everyone. Harry braced himself before opening the folder. In his lifetime, he has seen a fair number of not-so-good things, things that will make a normal person's stomach turn. However, despite all of that, Harry still felt a bit queasy at the photo in front of him.
"Fine. We'll get him the Firebolt." Draco said making Harry smile so bright and wide that it made the blond's heart flutter like it just grew wings.
Harry heard the fireplace flare to life. He cast a quick Tempus charm and saw that it was exactly a minute past 8PM. He slammed his forehead on the desk and let out a frustrated groan because he knows exactly what's about to happen.
"I should get going." Harry announced. Adhil was on the till assisting an elderly witch with her purchase of Better Pepper-Up potion while Sonya was in a quiet corner of the shop, sorting through the beetle eyes just like what Adhil told her to do. The blond only gave him a nod while the woman eyed him.
Harry sighed and looked at Parkinson. He opened his mouth to say something but she spoke again, cutting whatever he was about to say.
Harry let go of the pendant and let it sit over his shirt as he looked around.
"Fucking sap." Draco muttered pulling his boyfriend in for a kiss.
Then the memory struck him in the voice of Pansy Parkinson.
Claudette's brows furrowed a bit, probably confused as to why the man in front of her is so keen to talk to the higher ups. Harry – getting  the feeling that the receptionist is about to drill him with twenty questions – waved his hand to cast a wandless and non-verbal Confundus charm. He wasn't an expert at such manner of spellwork so the effects of the spell are much more mild than if he were to cast it with a wand. Luckily, the mildness was perfect to disorient Claudette, making her vulnerable to suggestions and persuasions.
"He certainly doesn't think of you as just another case to be solved, that's for sure." Severus said after a few seconds of contemplation. He then breathed in deeply before speaking in a softer tone, reserved for moments in which he knows he has to get through his godson's stubbornness. "Maybe it is time, Draco…"
Now, I do believe that the Investigation Department has made a new discovery regarding the case?"
"I told you nothing."
"I'm talking about the letters from five years ago. The one you addressed to me." Harry clarified. This time he reached into his coat pocket and retrieved a worn-out looking envelope. Its wax seal was already open. Inside, it held several pieces of paper and a small tag. He handed them over to the man beside him.
Auror Weasley, I've heard that you've been working on a project with the Department of Mysteries."
Harry took out his notepad and a Quick-Quotes quill.
"Why did you write me a letter?" The Auror asked, getting back into more serious topics. "Out of everyone you knew why me?"
Adhil continued to watch him in silence. The slight falter in his breathing was the only indication that he had heard what has been said.
Draco was clearly in a better place now. He has moved on from the war and has made a life for himself. He found his calling and purpose.
Harry stayed up all night to finish the rough draft of his next book. He went through several cups of coffee along with a handful of Pepper up potion vials. Writing was such an ordeal but he got through it with his sanity still in tact. After a short nap, Harry picked up his manuscript and headed to Malfoy's flat via floo.
Nothing seemed to be out of the ordinary. Harry could see people in groups and pairs, probably talking about how their work week has been. He saw a guy calling out to his friend who just entered the pub to let him know where they're sitting. He could also see people who were by themselves. Some were on the phone inviting friends over and saying how they have already reserved seats for them. There's also a woman who seems to be nursing emotional pain as she cried and drowned her sorrows with multiple pints of beer and vodka.
"Draco? Are you awake?" He murmured, turning his body to face the blond who was currently blinking sleepily at the canopy of their bed. If he wasn't awake before, he's awake now. They always sleep like this. They would just lay down together with a bit of space in between, but would always end up gravitating towards each other until they're all snuggled up in the other's warmth.
"After the war, he became quiet and reclusive…" She continued. "I didn't see him much for the first year. I was busy with my community service and Draco with whatever it was that he was doing while on probation. After a year, I decided that it was time for us to reclaim our position in society. I wrote to Draco, inviting him for afternoon tea. Start small, you know. Alas, my owl returned with no response. All of my letters returned unopened but I'm nothing if not persistent. We were the last Slytherins of our year left in the country and we have known each other since we were children. I'm not about to let that friendship go just because he was being stubborn. So, I kept sending him letters every week. Until, he finally replied after a month of pestering.
"We should go visit a Sqatoo's nest with this next time, darling!" Luna exclaimed excitedly. "Thank you, Blaise."
A flock of pale blue birds flew along the aisle. As they flew, music started to play as if it was sung by the birds themselves. Harry watched as Pansy Parkinson walked down the grey carpet, her arm hooked into that of Milicent Greengrass-Bulstrode's. She wore a white off-shoulder wedding dress made of tulle fabric. Flower lace patterns were sewn onto the top and scattered loosely away from each other as they reached the hem. Her raven hair was pinned into a bun with stray strands of it framing her face. She glowed with beauty and happiness. She smiled at all of the guests as she passed them, rolling her eyes at Blaise who let out a wolf whistle. Pansy and Milicent stopped at the end of the aisle, just in front of the wedding arch. Milicent then pressed a kiss on the bride's cheek before going to sit on the front row beside her wife. Pansy then turned to face the way in which she just came from to await her own bride.
"To ask you about your work."
"I'd like to think that that's not the case. Besides, only Malfoy's magical signature was detected across the property. It couldn't have possibly been anyone but him."
Harry slowly felt it.
Malfoy merely stared at him in confusion.
The scent of coffee beans and pastries hit both of their nose the moment they stepped inside. Draco couldn't help but take a deep breath to inhale the delicious aroma of the shop. He rarely comes here – perhaps only twice a week at most and only if he's really craving for chocolate biscuits – and he wishes he had the time to stop by more often.
"Mr. Potter, whoever Mr. Malfoy was, I highly doubt that he would come to someone as new as I am."
"Anything." The other man replied, sounding a little bit breathless as he and Harry were now roughly two feet apart.
"Yeah, from those enchanted necklaces you gave Luna and Pansy as wedding gifts." Harry elaborated, taking the Masidec off and placing it on Draco's outstretched hand. The blond examined it closely, even picking up his wand and tapping it in random places. "They think that your spellwork is a work of art. Hermione even said that you were a genius! Or was it Ron? I think it was the both of them which was surprising. Well, not the part that you're a genius because I know you're smart and talented. It was obvious back in school. You were a git, yeah, but still a…smart and…uh…talented git. Yes.
His assistant immediately went to do what she's been told. She grabbed Harry's forearms and willed them away from his head while Adhil held the Auror's chin.
Draco clutched the locket in his hand, feeling protective over it.
In the end, Severus convinced him to tone down the enchantments on his locket a bit. Draco figures that it wouldn't split Potter's head into two anymore but, by weakening the spellwork, he risks the Auror finding out who he is easier.
"But that's ridiculous!" Harry exclaimed, his anger slowly returning but this time it's towards the people that Draco is referring to. "Voldemort killed my parents. He deprived me of a the life that I could've had, a family that I could've had! I'm not about to be like him!"
"We won't get to see each other…"
"I'm surprised it took him this long to do it," was her reply, inspecting what she created, not paying more than the necessary attention to the trio. "He's been saying that he'll erase what's left of the Malfoys for a long time now…starting with the Manor. Of course, I didn't believe him at first but seeing as we are now standing next to the Manor's rubble…"
"That's way too sappy. I told you to do whatever the fuck you wanted to do."
Adhil let out a frustrated sigh. He then sat on a nearby arm chair facing the portrait.
Ron shrugged.
"That's confidential information."
"Hmm…" Robards seemed to ponder for a bit as he stared at the object in the middle of the table. He then waved his wand to cast several spells. The first spell made the arm release a faint dark green smoke that smelled like rotting apples. This indicated a person's magical signature. Harry recognized the colour and consistency of the smoke as Michael Quinn's, the second wizard who went missing. His signature actually smelled like fresh Granny Smith apples but considering the situation, it made perfect sense for the smell to become rotten. The next spell, on the other hand, resulted into a dark purple sludgy substance to crawl out of the severed arm as if it's a living being.
"Isn't it true?" Draco rhetorically asked with a sneer on his face that was awfully familiar to Harry. "Aren't you just in the Auror force because it's what's expected of you? The Golden Boy, Defeater of Dark Lords, the boy who was chased down by dark wizards all his life decided that chasing more dark wizards is the perfect life for him! I may be wrong but that is fucking ridiculous. You deserve a quiet life where you have nothing to worry about except taking care of the next generation of Weasleys."
Vartan raised a skeptical eyebrow at him.
"Well, five years ago Draco Malfoy went missing. It's been some time and, while I am not certain, I have reason to believe that he's here in France."
"That's true but I'm still gonna ask George about it. He likes to work on new stuff and maybe one of these days we'll get a hint as to where these missing wizards really are and we could use this magical signature device to find them!" Ron said enthusiastically, already pulling a spare piece of parchment and scribbling some notes on it. "I'll draft up some plans and show them to you so you can add more stuff that you think it'll probably need."
Harry didn't really want to say more than what was necessary but Vartan seems to know more than they're letting on. The Auror just let out another sigh before talking about what made him come to France.
"I'm going to place advance orders to Madam Malkin's so they'll be prepared once we arrive." Malfoy said at Harry's questioning look. "You better be ready by the time I finish sending the owl."
"I'm so sorry but he's quite busy these days and he's going on a medical conference next week. He wouldn't be back until the week after that."
Harry breathed a huge sigh of relief as the words left Draco's mouth. That utterance alone cleared the fog that seems to have clouded up his mind. However, he still doesn't recognize the face that's staring back at him. The blond seems to recognize the look of confusion that has taken over Harry's face.
"Not to mention you testified for him and his mother during the trials."
There was no sign of Draco Malfoy anywhere.
"If I learned anything from Draco in the past years, it's that it will never be too early to drink. Besides, it's helping me cope with the fact that I've been a shite bestfriend… never realizing that Draco needed help until it's too late." Parkinson said, tilting the glass slightly as if to clink it with another non-existent glass. She then downed the alcohol in one go.
"You what?!" Harry exclaimed in the middle of swallowing his food. He started to choke and cough for a short time before managing to get himself together. Malfoy is a git for not helping him.
(Turn to page 12 for more details)
"Good morning, Sir," Auror Felicity Thimble greeted him a little nervously. She's one of the Aurors that Harry assigned to help him with The Missing Wizards case. She and Grunhild are fairly new. They've been in the task force for just a little over three years but they're both talented and trustworthy. Not to mention they can get the job done as soon as humanly possible. "I'm sorry to call you this early but Daisy and I have just finished the reports on The Crystal's staff. You said that the case is time sensitive so any and all discoveries should be reported immediately. May we come through?"
"So, that leaves us with the spell."
The man gestured to himself. This must be Adhil.
Next update: August 25
"H-How--" Harry spluttered, eyes wide with shock. He opened his mouth to say something but closed it again as he temporarily lost the ability to form coherent words. He didn't expect anyone to recognize him here in France just from his face. Well, his scar did stuck out like a sore thumb but it was currently covered by his fringe.
Deep down, Harry feels like it's his fault that Draco felt the need to burn down his family home and leave the country. Call it his "hero complex" but he couldn't stop the guilty feeling from eating him up. At the very least, he wanted to thank Draco for everything he did and to return his wand.
Adhil didn't even take his wand out this time but Harry heard several clicking sounds from the front door. It was unlocking itself, preparing for the departure of its visitor. Harry admired the wandless and non-verbal magic that the blond seemed to have an affinity with. Of course, it can also just be the house listening to its owner but it didn't have the same sentient feeling as Hogwarts or Grimmauld Place so it can only just be the other man's magical capabilities.
"It's alright, Auclair." Healer Vartan assured the wizard, raising a hand and making a placating gesture. "I'm on lunch break anyways."
Happiness. Relief. Happiness and relief.
"Je ne parle pas français..?" Harry replied in an awkward accent, already using up most of his French vocabulary.
"But, being a Hogwarts professor will be good for you! It'll open more opportunities! You won't be…you know."
He felt an odd sense of déjà vu when he entered Conference Room #5. It was like he was transported back to one of their first briefings on The Missing Wizards case. However, instead of the room being filled with Aurors from their department, several unfamiliar faces now sat by the table. As per usual, a vacant seat was saved for him beside Ron while Robards was already up front and ready to discuss whatever it was that he needed to discuss.
"Yes, your Highness!" Blaise Zabini answered, emerging from the corner with Neville and Ginny behind him. "I have brought valuable guests! Oh, Milly and and Daph are going to be late. Apparently, little Celestine is having a bout of accidental magic and have successfully vanished all of the doors in their house.
With those thoughts swirling inside his head and with Potter's fiery green eyes piercing through his soul, Draco decided that he's had enough of running and hiding away.
"What?"
"So, you still believe that he did all of it? Cast the Fiendfyre and The Killing Curse?"
Harry's jaw tensed. A hundred different thoughts were running in his head. Was this intentional? Did Malfoy set fire to his own home and burned down with it? Or did someone else did this? So far, the evidence points at Malfoy being the root cause of the explosion. Harry couldn't rule out anything else unless Malfoy is found alive or declared dead. He ran a hand through his hair in frustration as he approached Ron, who seemed to be in a heated debate with his wife and another auror who Harry recognized as Ron's partner, Auror Perkins.
Parkinson immediately stepped forward, walking over to the middle of the rubble to pick up the box.
"Yesterday," The bartender leaned in and spoke lowly after he handed over Hubert's pint of beer to Julia. "He had the audacity to harass my staff and lay his filthy hands on Ophelia. Would've kicked him out in a heartbeat, business be damned. Luckily, the old man calmed down. But, Ophelia was so traumatised that she asked for the week off."
They were currently looking at thim with shock and confusion but, beneath that, Harry can detect something that he failed to see years ago: life.
"Here you go, lads." Joseph said, setting down their drinks in front of them. His accent was very convincing. One would have to listen quite closely and know what they're listening for to detect that slight American accent.
Maps. The map of France where cities were encircled including Lyon.
The next day, Harry decided to not go back to Place Sathonay. Instead, he went to explore Wizarding Paris, specifically the shopping district named "Rue de l'Horizon". He has already been here once, when he was first investigating Draco's disappearance. That was a few years ago. Nothing much has changed since then except for a few new shops here and there as well as the new fashion trend that the clothing shop has on display.
"I'm sorry, Mr. Potter but, as you can tell, I haven't seen Draco Malfoy in years."
Harry entered the house and was immediately hit with its warm and homey feeling. He could smell something delectable cooking in the kitchen, a combination of Ron's cottage pie and Hermione's Yorkshire pudding. It was only when a grumble was heard that Harry realized he had skipped both breakfast and lunch that day.
"True."
Where the lone Malfoy has been, the Prophet has no idea. Requests for interviews have been denied by both parties. Although, this reporter can say that there is something going on between the former school rivals judging by the way that they walked closely next to each other.
Pansy jumped slightly, startled at suddenly being addressed. She then smiled at Luna and placed the note on her lap before putting the necklace on her spouse's neck. Luna returned the favor by doing the same for Pansy.
Celeste nodded, taking her pen and using it to point out several important details.
"Okay um," Harry started to say, trying to come up with anything that will allow him to speak to this Dr. Laurent. He was in France for only a week and he'll be damned if he wastes a single hour of that week waiting around for nothing. He then remembered a certain something that he stuffed in his bag at the last minute. "I…I guess I'll just come back some other time. I just have to fill these forms out right?"
logo. It felt like he has seen them before.
It turns out that all the Malfoy house elves were sent to Hogwarts to help out. All twenty of them. Harry snorted at the note attached to the file about the house elves ("Don't even think about interrogating them. They are bound to secrecy until he dies or orders them to speak himself"). Aside from that Malfoy also transferred a million galleons each into the vaults of Andromeda Tonks and Edward Remus Lupin. He had also re-instated Andromeda back into the Black family, automatically making Tonks and Teddy part of the family tree as well. This brought a wide smile on Harry's face. The past years have been tough seeing as he is technically the only heir of the Black family but now, Andy and Teddy can rebuild and redefine the family's legacy. With their re-instatement, they are also given back their seats at the Wizengamot.  The Black family, being both ancient and noble, held two seats. Both of which will go to Andy until Teddy is of age. The two Malfoy seats in the Wizengamot, on the other hand will naturally go to Parkinson. However, a footnote written at the bottom of the parchment caught Harry's eyes.
"Auror Potter," Robards greeted him back from the far end of the room. With a nod of his head, he gestured for Harry to sit down on the remaining seat beside Ron. Robards then turned to address everyone in the room. "I apologize for calling you all at this hour but I am sure that you understand the need to locate the victims and apprehend the criminal. We are running out of time and, if our observations are correct, we only have five days before another wizard gets abducted.
"Right…uh…I was actually wondering if I could talk to whoever's in-charge of the program?"
"Oh."
Harry only nodded. He knew about this. The Cell Cleansing Potion is something that the patient has to take regularly for a span of two to three months until they are fully healed. The average duration currently stands at three months. It was rare for someone to recover at the two month mark. Looking back at the conversation that he heard in the pub back in England, it was the very first time that someone has recovered in just six weeks. Harry still isn't as well-versed in Potions as he would like to be but he knew that while the Cell Cleansing Potion is quite common in terms of brewing method and ingredients, the components itself are volatile and are extremely tricky to play around with. He remembers a conversation that he had with Hermione wherein they talked about how altering the ingredients of the potion – or even just changing its state or composition – can turn it into a poison as potent as a Black Mamba's venom.
"Good afternoon, I'm Auror Harry Potter from the British Ministry of Magic," He began. "I'm looking for a Mr. Adhil Blanchet…?"
Parkinson then straightened her posture, assuming a stature that seemed to assert her superiority. She stood with her right leg pointing slightly outward while her arms are crossed over her chest as she stared at the three people in front of her with a sneer.
For years, he has managed to not come in contact with anyone except for one. The letters he sent are all clean and void of any magical signatures, having the ability to both remove and mask them. However, a few weeks ago, he slipped. The gift that he sent wasn't entirely untraceable. He left the tiniest bit of his magic in there. Did he become reckless? Negligent? Complacent? Or did his subconscious finally caught up to him, letting him know what he truly wants and needs?
Pansy highly doubts that Draco is actually dead but she also knows that it is highly unlikely for her to see him again in this lifetime. Draco definitey doesn't want to be found but Potter seemed determined. He is the Golden Boy and the Savior of the Wizarding World after all. Not to mention the head of the Investigative Department, the office responsible for solving some of the most difficult cases that the Ministry has ever seen. Pansy is hoping that maybe instead of finding Draco and bringing him back to London, Potter will end up finding so much more than that.
"I might be," he said simply, setting his drink down on the table. "But I don't think so. Your face is still unfamiliar to me but I've…talked to several people and I've seen clues, Adhil…Draco. I've seen clues and have put them all together."
"Harry Potter."
It was crazy, he knows that. He also knows that he might be wrong but he would take being wrong over being kept in the dark. This is why Harry rummaged through his bag until he found the items that he was looking for.
Robards then turned to Harry.
Back then, those eyes looked at Harry with a mixture of recognition and fear. This time, he wants to be looked at in an entirely different way.
Harry already went to France a few years back but his search proved to be unsuccessful. However, back then he had no trails to follow, no specific places to name, no people to ask.
Kudos and comments are highly appreciated. If you have suggestions or guesses as to what will happen feel free to leave them below!
"Julia! How's the Muggle doing?" Ron asked while trying to sneak in counter-curses at the woman.
"Harry!" Hermione said the moment she saw him. Ron and the other auror both turned their heads to him. The three of them filled him in on what they've got so far.
Malfoy's study was as organized as ever. Despite the lack of houselves, it was spotless without a hint of dust anywhere. Bookshelves lined the two walls of the room. A single desk was placed in the middle, right in front of the window. Harry walked over to the desk to drop off his manuscript. However, the open parchment that was already occupying the space caught his eye. Now, he wasn't one to snoop but the emerald ink of the Hogwarts seal made him curious enough to take a sneak peek at the paper.
Harry finally lifted his head from the desk to glare at Malfoy. It no longer held any heat though. His glares have lost the hate and malice that they held years ago. It's been 10 years since the war. Harry and Draco became the most unlikely of friends during the 8th year program that Professor McGonagall has opened for everyone who has missed their 7th year during the war. Their relationship was largely influenced by the fact that Harry testified in Draco and Narcissa Malfoy's defense during their trials. Thus, they were kept out of Azkaban. At first, they clashed like they usually did but the both of them figured that their energy was better spent on studying for their N.E.W.T.S rather than keeping their old rivalry alive. They became study mates but after a while they started to hang out beyond the confines of the library. Weekends found the duo traipzing Hogsmeade, looking for things to do. They were sometimes joined by Ron, Hermione, Neville, and Luna but most of the time, it was just the two of them. Their friendship lasted long after they graduated from Hogwarts. Harry decided that being an auror didn't suit him and that he always liked stories. Malfoy was the one who suggested that he become an author. Fast forward to the present time and here he is, faced with the wrath of one Draco Malfoy who always comes barelling like a hurricane whenever Harry misses his deadlines even by a hairstrand.
"Didn't I already tell you that I haven't heard from Draco Malfoy?"
"I know that," Harry said throwing a small piece of bread at Malfoy who easily dodged it. Prat. "But why?"
"I'm sorry to hear about your aunt's condition," The receptionist – Celeste, according to the name tag attached on her uniform – said with a sympathetic expression before getting a small stack of papers. "But, you've come to the right place. These are the information pamphlets to know more about our program as well as the forms that you need to fill out for it, along with the list of documents that you need to submit to qualify. It's mostly experimental and for research so we do not guarantee full recovery but so far we have a 95% success rate with our patients."
"D-Draco Malfoy?!" They said, pounding their fist on their chest. "He's been missing? For the last five years?"
"English and Potions."
He then summoned an empty glass from across the room with a swish of his wand. This action darkened the amulet's glow until it became closer to a navy blue shade.
"I didn't," Draco muttered. "I have just gained a clingy…acquaintance."
Harry nodded.
"A very complex spell." Hermione supplied.
Speaking of the blond Potions Master…
" before disapparating back to Lyon.
He didn't really have the time for leisure nor was he here for that purpose. That's why he immediately made his way to the Hôpital Edouard Herriot. It took him a Floo journey from Paris to Lyon and a bus from the public Floo in Lyon to the hospital itself. It was a short trip but it could've been shorter had he realized the nature of the establishment.
We asked Love and Body Language Expert Filippa Manoleli about it!
Pansy shook her head.
Not only that but Malfoy donated one million galleons to Hogwarts "in order to support the education of young witches and wizards of diverse backgrounds and status". Another million was divided into different charities that support war victims, the biggest chunk of which went into the support of those who have been bitten by and turned into werewolves. The wizarding world is much kinder to them now but that doesn't mean the discrimination has stopped especially when it comes to finding and keeping an occupation.
Harry will forever remember the day on which Hermione Granger outright admitted that Draco Malfoy is a genius. Not to mention have Ronald Weasley agree with it and even take inspiration from something that Draco made.
"True. She's the one who got involved in illicit activities but dealing with rare potions ingredients is a far cry from kidnapping."
"Right. Same procedure as what my sister told you, Mr. Evans. You just have to fill out those forms and send it via owl. Since your aunt is a Muggle, she would have to be admitted in the main building once she's accepted in the program. If you have any questions about the specifications of the program, I can direct you to the magical division of our Cancer Research and Treatment Program. You can also refer to the pamphlets for more information."
"Potpourri?" Draco asked, tone filled with amusement as he continued to go through their mail. Harry could almost hear the smile on his face.
Harry sat up straight and properly faced the blond.
As always, kudos and comments are always welcome! I hope you enjoy this chapter. 🥰
"He's English."
"It's all good fun actually," The blonde narrated, leading Harry into the dining room where Pansy is directing dishes into the table with graceful waves of her wand. "A flock of them stayed at Pansy and I's campsite for two days. We had to chase them away before we starve and dehydrate ourselves to death."
"Did Ron ever tell you how he came up with the idea for the amulet?" George asked, scooping up half of the peas in his plate and putting them on Angelina's plate making the latter roll her eyes. Harry shook his head, mouth too full with beef and mashed potatoes to answer properly.
It took Harry a few moments to get over the initial shock. When he did, he cleared his throat and nodded.
"Oh shut up, it's already 11 in the fucking morning, you git." It was Malfoy's turn to roll his eyes as he waved Harry's remark with a graceful motion of his hand. "Be grateful that I didn't run here the moment that I woke up or you'll be cursing me left and right, wishing that you ended my life back in 6th year."
There was a long bout of silence as the blond contemplated this while Harry just lay there watching him nervously. He was just about to say something to break the tense silence when Draco sat up. He took a deep breath and looked at Harry with a serious expression.
The symbols from the wax seal and the tag were quite similar. They were almost identical in the way that their flower petals unfurled. If one is going to assume that Harry has already memorized each minute detail of these illustrations, they will be correct in their assumptions. And so, with the flowers' appearance imprinted into his mind, it is quite easy to point out the similarities between the symbols that are on the wax seal and tag to the one on Sonya's letter.
"Slow…and frustrating." Harry said, after taking a hefty bite of cottage pie (lots of mashed potato on top, just the way he likes it). "Malfoy's definitely alive. I'm sure of it. I went to Parkinson this afternoon. She said that if Malfoy's alive and he doesn't want to be found, nobody would be able to find him."
"This is a Magical Signature Detecting device. The Masidec for short," Potter started to explain. Draco let out a snort upon hearing the name that they've given to the necklace or, should he say, device. "Couldn't we have picked a better name? Sure. But functionality won over creativity. And this little thing is why I'm here, right in front of you, Adhil or perhaps I should call you Draco."
"Dark magic." Ron said simply, his face scrunched up in disgust as the substance started to spread on the table. Harry feared that it would try to touch everyone but it seemed to have hit an invisible barrier. Instead of continuously spreading, its edges crawled upwards. When it sensed that it couldn't reach any further, it started pounding on the invisible barrier. With another swish of his wand, Robards vanished the traces of dark magic.
"He's fine!" was Julia's frantic response, her American accent being more pronounced under distress. "I've managed to reverse the curse. He's passed out but he'll be fine!"
"He comes here a few nights a week. He's rowdy and rude and I would honestly kick him out but rumor has it that he's part of some gang and I don't fancy bringing trouble into my pub." Joseph explained before letting out a sigh. At that moment, one of the waitresses – Julia, Joseph's sister – walked over to the bar with an empty serving tray on her side.
She wasn't remorseful. Not in the slightest. As a matter of fact, she seemed to be filled with glee. A few days later, she died in the holding cell of the Ministry, face painted with nothing but peace
"Expelled? Why?" Ron asked.
Maybe it's going to be about how two people who are so different from each other became friends. How they'll become m--
How did someone wielding a Ministry regulated wand do all of this?
Malfoy closed and folded the Prophet, setting it aside. He crossed his arms and shrugged.
"Hello, fuckers!" The group heard a familiar voice yell from the receiving area just as they were about to sit down. Pansy and Hermione both rolled their eyes and looked expectantly at the direction from which the voice sounded.
Another moment of silence passed between the two of them.
"Pot…Harry." Adhil greeted in a surprised tone. The blond clearly didn't expect Harry this early in the morning. He was all dressed up too and ready to leave the house. He looked quite dashing in Muggle clothing. Harry figured that Adhil's white shirt, grey pants, and black trench coat ensemble can be considered as casual but he still felt underdressed in front of him.
"Does it still hurt?" Sonya asked.
"Seems like they're understaffed if they're looking for new professors in other subjects… You know, not just in that language thing…and in potions. Since you're…yeah." Harry spoke around bites of egg and toast. "What positions are open?"
"There's only one problem though," Harry said thoughtfully, trying to focus on the task at hand and not at what's slowly creeping into his conscious. "Not a shred of the victims' magical signatures were found during the investigation. There's no signature pointing to the culprit either. The unsub has deliberately wiped their tracks and with utmost care as well."
"I'll send them to you by owl post the moment my solicitor approves of it. Now, I'm sure that you're not here for the papers. If you're going to ask me to give you the personal letter Draco wrote to me, I would require you to show me the letter that he addressed to you as well."
Parkinson let out a snort. "I highly doubt that you're here for a cup of tea." She narrowed her eyes at the papers on her desk and picked up a quill. She dipped it into the ink bottle before swiftly signing the lower portion of the parchment. "Ask away, Potter. I hope you don't mind me doing some work whilst you're here. I have been left with a huge sum of wealth and it is quite a pain in the arse to get the legalities in order."
An hour later, Harry and Ron can be found sitting at a secluded booth in 'The Crystal', polyjuiced as two Muggles from Italy.
Harry didn't get the chance to knock on the door because it suddenly opened to reveal Adhil. Or Draco. Draco as Adhil.
"Glad to see that you have managed to get dressed properly and on time, dear." Andy made a teasing remark, moving to re-do Harry's necktie.
"Shut up, Potter….Harry." Adhil muttered as Harry stepped backward to let him pass through. The clicking noises sounded as the door locked itself.
However, disappointment filled his body as he came face-to-face with a stranger.
"Fine," He gave in. "Are you okay though?  You usually barge in at the two minute mark." Harry made that last remark in an attempt to lighten up the mood.
"Who knows what he could've already achieved in the last five years…" Daphne added.
If you have questions regarding anything or if you want to check my writing progress, you can always reach me through these links:
Harry entered his office that very same afternoon, eager to view the memories that Parkinson provided. If everything goes according to plan, he would still have time to go to Ron and Hermione's for their scheduled dinner.
He also saved my life. He and his mother saved my life. I wouldn't be standing here without him…them."
"Ah, that's why you look a little uneasy." Andy commented before tapping her wand on Harry's chest. He let out a sigh of relief at the feeling of the cloth loosening a bit.
"Earl grey?" Harry inquired, pinpointing the reason why the tasted good. The blond merely hummed in confirmation as he sipped his own cup of tea.
"Merlin's beard…if it isn't Harry James Potter!" Pansy greeted once she caught sight of him.
"Don't look at me like that," the blond said without sparing a single glance at Harry. Instead, he took a sip of the spiked tea. "It's been a long day and it's only…10AM. I didn't plan on revealing who I am but here you are. The literal embodiment of my past coming back to bite me in the arse."
Apparently, this case is bigger than they initially thought. There are now a total of 13 missing men. Four of which are wizards, the rest are Muggles. While the wizards went missing within a week of each other, the Muggles disappeared at the most random of times, sometimes a mere day or two apart. Just like the wizards, however, they all disappeared without a trace. Further investigation done by the Aurors revealed that, out of the nine missing Muggles, only two of them have been in The Crystal. The rest have never even set a foot near the place.
"Stop joking about that." Harry said through gritted teeth. "What are you doing here anyways?"
"We only found out after inspecting the wand itself. I sent a Patronus to the Ministry but they said that the alarms for the regulated wands are still in tact, especially that of Malfoy's." Perkins supplied.
It makes Harry's heart ache whenever he thinks about the fact that everyone has already seemed to forget about Draco. While he's still doing everything he can to atleast know about the blond's wherebouts and ensure that he's okay, others have already moved on with their lives. By others, he meant the former Slytherins who have known Draco far longer than anyone else. Harry's happy that his friends are happy with their lives but he often wonders if they ever think about Draco. He approached Pansy about it a few years ago – probably after his 15th visit to get information about the blond – but she shut him down and told him that if Draco doesn't want to be found, he ought to be left alone. She trusts that his bestfriend is now living the peaceful life that he always longed for. Although, she still refused to show him the letter Draco wrote for her nor did she answer the question of whether or not she's still in correspondence with him. Harry and Pansy had quite the shouting match in her office at The Quibbler and she wasn't even fazed by the threat of being accused of "withholding evidence". In the end, they have agreed to not talk about Draco anymore lest Pansy hexes his bollocks off.  It's not only Pansy, though. Two years into handling the Malfoy Manor case Ron and Hermione have started to look at him weirdly, similar to how they did in fifth year when they thought he was being possessed by Voldemort, especially during their weekly dinners where Harry would go on and on about his theories, the memories he was presented with, and anything that involves the Malfoy Manor case. The next week, Hermione snapped and told him that he's "being way too obsessed with Malfoy, Harry! You should really give that case to a different Auror. Someone without any prior attachments to him. If you don't do it, I'll tell Robards to get you off that case myself". Since then, he didn't talk about the Malfoy Manor case anymore. Things would probably progress faster if he had his friends' help but Hermione and Pansy share the same sentiment: Draco Malfoy wouldn't be found if he doesn't want to be found.
"I don't know. They wouldn't tell us. Confidentiality clauses and all that bull. But if you ask me, I don't really care. We're just glad to have cousin Martina back at her feet."
Harry entered what he assumed as the main building of the hospital. The lobby was sufficiently busy – as busy as you would expect a normal hospital to be. People are either walking around or sitting by the waiting area, some with white coats on, some in scrubs and some are just wearing Muggle clothes. There's quite a number of people but it was, by no means, crowded. So, Harry went on over to the front desk where a cheerful woman greeted him in French.
"Yeah, I think so." Harry responded after thinking about it for a short while. They just have to drop by 'The Crystal' and examine it. He doubts that they will catch the criminal today unless they reveal themselves. "Do you reckon we should go in Polyjuiced? Don't want to alert anyone just in case the unsub is already on their toes."
"Petrificus Totalus! Incarcerous!"
Harry put on the goggles and twisted the knob that activated the zooming function of the lens.
As Pansy watched Harry leave, all she could think about was Draco's letter for her. One paragraph, in particular, stood out.
Harry was frozen in place. Quite shocked. Not really surprised that the Ministry has a "safety net" plan when it comes to him but feeling disappointed and betrayed nonetheless.
"Judging by the way the skin and flesh looks, it looks like it's been forcefully ripped away from its joint," He explained. "Only a handful of spells are known to do that and all of which are considered to be quite dark, intended to make the victim suffer. Either a spell did this or it was done through brute force. Nevertheless, it tells us that whoever did this – whoever is doing this – they're doing it either from insanity or from sheer rage and hatred."
"Oh, yeah." Harry said, holding the Masidec's pendant in his hand as he watched Draco's silver magic dance around inside the hollowed crystal while the rest is enveloped in a soft blue glow. "Ron and George made it. They actually got the inspiration from you."
This is what he wanted, right? For the past few weeks, he's been trying to convince himself that it was an accident. That he was probably too tired, that's why he slipped but, deep down, he knows that he's not that kind of a person. No matter how tired he is, he will never forget essential things like stirring a specific potion thrice clockwise, twice counter-clockwise every four minutes or getting rid of his magical signature from an object that he made so that he cannot be traced by anyone.
"Can't. The police don't like us. Who do you think they'll believe? A couple of immigrants or a dude who has spent all his life in this country and will most likely die here too?"
Pansy chuckled and patted his back. He was just about to leave when Luna called his name and pushed the golden pouch containing one of the boxes into his hand. Harry looked at her, mildly shocked and confused. Pansy raised an eyebrow at her wife.
"Ah, I knew it. Spent a whole month in the country, especially up North. Got lured in by the hustle and bustle of the city life, stayed for the pizza." Ron narrated convincingly before drinking from his pint. Joseph chuckled while Harry made a show of rolling his eyes.
"Eh, Mr. Potter here is much more interesting than beetle eyes."
"And I also wanted to make sure that you're alright." Harry added. "We're all living good lives now but I didn't know for certain if you were still alive or if you accomplished what you set out to do. I can't help but think that maybe if I did more for you and your mother that maybe she would still be alive and you wouldn't feel the need to leave."
Harry's breath became a little less laboured. His arms fell back to his sides as he started to calm down. Adhil made him sit on the chair that Sonya was sitting on earlier while the latter went to fetch him a glass of water.
"Isn't that good though? The more time you spend with the creatures, the better you'll get to know them."
"Is that a talisman?" He heard Sonya ask but Harry ignored her. He was was too busy staring at the Masidec. He blinked one, twice, thrice. It was indeed glowing. It was faint but it was glowing. He looked at Sonya, eyes frantic and heart starting to beat wild inside his chest.
While Adhil spoke in that smooth voice – calm but filled with wonder and passion for his craft, Harry found himself walking closer to where the blond was standing until they were side by side. His chest felt just a tiny bit warm.
Hermioned shook her head. For someone to get away with casting two extremely powerful spells – one being an Unforgivable – without alerting the authorities, they have to be equally powerful and discreet. At first glance, this seemed to be a whirl of the moment decision but it's starting to become more complicated than that. Almost like it was planned for a long time.
"Nothing."
"Why's it glowing, though?" Harry asked, turning the zooming knob to look closer at the now emerald green crystal sphere and at the blue light coming from it.
Once again, Harry and Ron are at The Crystal, polyjuiced as the same Muggles from before. This time they sat approximately in the middle of the room with Harry wearing the Masidec – containing the sludgy purple substance of the unsub's dark magic. Its pendant was resting on his chest and glowed a light baby blue. The amulet started to glow the moment they stepped into the pub. Luckily, it was faint enough that people had to be close to Harry to see it. The two Aurors had to act as calmly as possible to not get any unwanted attention, especially from their unsub who seemed to be in the very same room as they are.
"Quite exhilarating," Luna said with a smile. "We had such a great time exploring the forests. Did you know that there's a song bird called a Sqatoo that creates sexual tension between the most compatible people that hear its song?"
Harry thought that they were heading back to the blond's house but, instead, they went towards the square. Adhil was swift on his feet and Harry couldn't help but think that if he wasn't an Auror, he would definitely have a difficult time catching up to the Potions Master.
There were only three people in the shop when Sonya noticed the Masidec's light: Harry, Sonya, and Adhil.
His head was starting to hurt now. The pain creeping in from his temples to his entire head, rendering him incapable of thinking about anything except for the pain itself. Harry clenched his jaw as he tried to endure it.
Death Eater scum
"Who's to say she won't do it though? I'm already in deep water if she finds out that I didn't attend all the robe fitting appointments she set for me."
Kudos and comments are always appreciated. If there are any errors (spelling and/or grammatical) please let me know! I try to proofread my chapters before publishing them but I still miss some mistakes.
Harry remembered feeling nervous during his first match but Teddy didn't show a hint of that nervousness. His bright blue bubblegum hair clashed badly with the Hufflepuff yellow but it also showed how excited and happy he was to be part of the team.
Before Harry could think further about it, Julia arrived with their order of a basket of fish and chips and two burgers.
"Hey," He called the others' attention once they calmed down. "Who's that one from?"
That's what he said and Harry has a feeling that it's what Draco has set out to do. Harry knows that he should probably leave him alone especially if he's starting anew but how could he? How could he just let Draco be if he is reminded everyday about how much he owes the blond git? His house. Andy and Teddy. His own life. A mere testimony at the trials to keep him out of Azkaban wasn't enough. He knows that he should've tried harder to improve Draco's reputation at the very least. Maybe if he had… Maybe Draco could've walked the streets of Diagon Alley without worrying about getting hexed or spat in the face. Maybe Narcissa wouldn't be dead. Maybe Draco would still have his mother. Maybe she would've gotten decent treatment and not be left to die. Maybe she wouldn't have been attacked in the first place.
"Wounds inflicted as sacrifice for blood magic should heal on their own. No healing spell or salve will accelarate the process." Parkinson replied as she turned toward the direction of the gates. "Now, seeing as I have quite a lot of legal matters to take care of, I shall take my leave. Although, I would appreciate it if you inform me of…anything about Draco."
"We need to go back to The Crystal", Harry told Ron once they were in the private confines of the former's office. "Remember what Joseph said? About how Hubert never attempted to do anything rash except for that one time that he did? Just a few days after that incident, he disappeared."
Harry was just thinking about filing for an extended leave when his ears perked up at the conversation between the two people behind him.
"It's the same symbol. I'm sure of it. I know that this is from Dra-- Malfoy. Here, I'll show you." He insisted, taking out his wand and performing a spell different from the curse detection spell that he performed earlier. This time, it's a spell that exposes any magical signature left on an object. Harry stared at the item that he's holding, waiting for Draco's distinct magical signature to emerge. The room was quiet as everyone held their breaths, waiting. However, after a few moments, nothing happened. Harry's brows furrowed in confusion. He expected the object to have leftover magic on it considering the way the pouch seemed to materialize out of nowhere.
"It's really you…" Harry breathed out and his breath was so close to Draco's face that he just had to open his eyes.
Harry lifted his head from the desk with a sigh. He better get back to work lest he be on the receiving end of Malfoy's stinging hex.
"Yes, sir." Harry and Ron both agreed. They were already planning on doing that but things will be much easier with official permission from the Auror office.
"I am having a crisis, Severus," He said, running his hands over his face. "I think I deserve to pace out of frustration!"
The man in front of him cleared his throat before speaking.
"I see…" Neville trailed off, looking thoughtful. "I've been trying different things to keep pests away from my plants but insectides are usually either too weak or too toxic. I tried making my own batch of insectides but it's quite time consumming. Besides, it will be better to catch the insects. Maybe some of them are potions ingredient worthy."
"Not to mention all those patrols…"
"She's right, mate. But there's no harm done in trying."
He braced himself.
In that moment, Harry's goal changed. He no longer wants to find Malfoy to close the case. He wants to find Malfoy to see the man that he has become, to see for himself just how much he could do now that he seems to have denounced the name of Malfoy along with the ideals and expectations that came with it.
"Make yourself comfortable." Vartan said as they went over to the fridge and took out a container of what seemed to be Chinese takeout. They popped it in the microwave and turned back to Harry who was now sitting on one of the dining chairs. "Now, Mr. Potter, what brings you to our hospital?"
Harry expected a response but was instead met with silence. He took a deep breath and faced Draco…or Adhil…or whoever it was that he's talking to right now. He faced the other person and looked straight into their steel grey eyes. Eyes that, Harry could tell, were shining with multitudes of emotions that he cannot discern. Shock? Absolutely. Fear? Maybe. Confusion? Perhaps.
A few days later, Harry has come up with a plan. He has extended his leave for another week. He didn't ask around nor did he threaten anyone for information. Instead, he wrote two letters to two people. One is to confirm what he already knows – or atleast, what he thinks he already knows – while the other one is to ask simple questions. Simple questions that would greatly help him. His brain is still a bit muddled and confused but throughout the days, he realized that thinking about Adhil and Draco being the same person has become easier.
Draco's first reaction was to recoil from the pair of hands that reach out to him. Was he going to get strangled to death? That was his initial thought. However, he calmed down a bit when Potter grabbed the chain of his necklace. He calmed down a bit but it was immediately replaced with a spike of fear and panic.
"But you and Luna are friends!"
He was then led to an office that beared a single desk with a chair along with two lounge chairs in front of it. Harry sat down on one of the chairs and waited. He need not wait long. Around five minutes later, a goblin entered and sat in front of the desk.
Harry wandlessly turned on the lights in the room and looked down at the Masidec that was still hanging on his neck. It still contained Draco's magical signature.
"Sir, I would have to ask you to leave the premises if you don't stop harassing our staff." He threatened, his hold onto the man's arm turning into a firmer grip by the second until Harry could see the discomfort slide into the man's features. After a few moments of trying to endure the pain brought by the bartender's grip, the man finally let go of the waitress' arm. Her co-worker immediately went to her side to console her.
"I. Declined. The. Offer." Malfoy repeated, as if talking to a child.
"It shouldn't hurt at all! Adhil gave you our strongest and most effective formula."
"The usual for Hubert." She says with an exhausted sigh. Judging by the way Joseph glanced at the loud man, they assumed that that was "Hubert". Looking at the siblings up close, Harry and Ron could definitely see the similarities between them. They have the same eye shape and color. Their cupid's bow arched in a similar way despite Julia's lips being fuller than her brother's. The Aurors also figured that they would share the same brown hair that Joseph is sporting if Julia didn't have hers bleached blonde.
"How can you tell?" Severus asked.
"Luckily, Pansy has already handled everything."
France.
"Name should be filled out starting with the patient's surname. If the patient is able to, make sure they sign three times at the bottom right of the page and don't forget to sign the waiver. Make sure to read through EACH and EVERY section. The Oncology Department is very strict when it comes to filling out forms and making sure that they get all the necessary information." The woman pulled out a sticky note from somewhere on her desk and wrote down an address. "You don't need to go here just to submit those. You can mail it directly to us and we'll keep you updated on whether or not your aunt has been accepted in the program."
, Sonya." Adhil corrected, seemingly exasperated but Harry could detect a hint of amusement in his tone. "But thank you."
"It seems like Hogwarts has posted an ad for new professors."
Earl Grey tea and chocolate biscuits.
It was a bit awkward letting people know that Adhil Blanchet doesn't really exist and that he's been Draco Malfoy all along. However, they still value his talent and expertise above all else. Healer Vartan has even admired his decision to turn over a new leaf.
Harry gave Malfoy one last smile and a nod before walking out and going back home.
"Come now, love. I'm sure you're excited to test out Blaise's wonderful present." And with that, Luna grabbed her wife along with the box Blaise's gift has came in before dragging her upstairs. Probably to their bedroom.
"Wha--" Weasley, the male one, exclaimed. Pansy felt the four people behind her immediately put their guard up, their hands going to their wand holsters.
"Yes," He answered. "Did you know him?"
"Do you have an appointment with them?" was the other man's response. Not bothering to look up at whoever was speaking.
Despite not keeling over himself from pain, he was still far too exhausted to think about what happened at the shop so he downed the Dreamless Sleep and got under the covers. He passed out almost immediately.
One day, she snapped but not in the way that one would expect her to. She snapped and realized that she needed to give these men what they deserve. And so she planned her next actions. She was careful and deliberate from the first wizard to the last Muggle.
"Like what? Stealing a dragon from Gringotts?" He joked, making Ron laugh. It's been years so they really don't mind joking about the wild things that they did during the war. Besides, anyone who thinks that stealing a dragon from a heavily guarded facility isn't cool and bucketlist worthy is probably a fool who enjoys watching paint dry.
"You mean, you don't know where he is?" Harry questioned.
"Ginny and I aren't together…? We haven't been together for a long time."
"It was fun!" Harry replied, sitting beside Draco and forcing the blond to hook one of his arms over Harry, allowing the latter to cuddle up against him. "Luna enjoyed the birthing part. She's a natural at it. She's basically a Mediwitch for creatures."
"Perhaps."
"Oh, is that today?"
If Adhil was Draco, wouldn't he recognize him at first glance? He could never forget the face of someone that has been such a significant part of his life.
"Draco has always been good with charms." Millicent commented. "He once turned my cat blue back in second year and no one could reverse spell. Not even the seventh years."
"Erm…no...?"
I'm sorry that this took longer than planned but I didn't want to cut in the middle again. So, please have a 13k word chapter as a peace offering. 😅
And thus, Harry kept his investigation to himself throughout the years. Not even Robards questioned him.
"I won't, I swear."
"What, like, create his own spell?" Ron asked, letting out a snort as if the idea of Draco creating his own spell is as ridiculous as it can get. Harry, on the other hand, continued to listen to Luna and tried to follow her logic.
For the most part, he has just been juggling the Malfoy case with whatever case the Auror office has at hand.
"They're siblings," Grunhild added just as Ron was just about to ask. "They came here from the U.S. three years ago. And yes, they are both magical. They both attended Ilvermorny but Joseph dropped out a year before graduating while Julia only made it to fifth year before she was expelled."
"This," Harry gestured to the shelves of potions. "Improving potions. Making them more effective. I thought that you would be making your own potions but you're taking what's already there and making them better."
"Was he here? Did you see him?" Harry asked, holding the pouch tightly. He tried to keep his tone as unbothered as possible even though all he wants to do right now is to interrogate Pansy and persuade her to tell him everything that he needs to know about Draco.
"It's…" He began to say but his voice still came out weak so he cleared his throat before trying again. "It's…It's a gift from Draco?"
"I wonder if this will change that," Parkinson continued. "The three of you always thought you were better than him. Braver? Probably. Smarter? Debatable. But the lot of you will never be half the wizard that he is. Especially not you, Oh Great Savior."
"Thank you, Harry." Luna said with a soft smile as she took the box while Pansy walked closer to her wife and inspected the little package. They opened it to reveal a small image, barely the size of a thumb.
"Hmm?" Draco answered a bit groggily but he also turned his body to face Harry.
"You know how I went on a trip with Luna last month? To see the herd of Kelpies in Scotland? And how we went to see the winged-horses just this week?" Harry began, pushing off the strands of hair that fell over Draco's face and tucking them behind his ear.
"I don't think so. Our wards are very secure and no one can get through them unless one of us permits it. Harry was the first one to arrive via Floo and I don't recall seeing this package on the mantlepiece while we were hanging up the portrait. As for owls, the only owl that we've ever received since we got home is the one from my parents, inviting us over for brunch tomorrow."
"Hey, mate! Glad you could make it." Ron greeted him cheerfully with a tight hug upon opening the door to his and Hermione's home.
"Your wife is an absolute genius, that's what she is. Thanks to her I've gotten this thing to work properly." George murmured. He then waved his wand and pointed it to the object on the table. A sparkling emerald green haze made its way from his wand to the crystal sphere, filling up the hollow space. Immediately, the amulet started to glow the faintest of baby blue. "As you can see, gentlemen, I've successfully transferred some of ny magical signature into the amulet. The runes on the side act like permanent spellworks to keep it there."
"Did he act unusually?"
Harry took one of the maps and headed out to where he assumed the lobby would be.
The address written on the paper led him to a townhouse five minutes away from Place Sathonay.  A small pocket of a garden that's surrounded by a black wrought iron fence gave the illusion of a front porch. Its bushes were blooming with small white flowers and it looked well-kept and taken care of. Harry pushed open the short gate and walked over to the black door. It had a strange looking brass knocker that resembled an urn. If Harry looked closer, he would have seen different floral patterns faintly printed on the metal but the Auror overlooked it due to the gloom of the sky that seemed to have appeared out of nowhere. There was little sunshine that can bring attention to the tiny details on the door.
"Do you think it could be one of them?" Ron asked, his brain already filtering through the faces of workers and patrons that he saw during their first visit. He felt a bit frustrated at not being able to recall anyone who acted or reacted strange. He got too distracted by the scene that Hubert caused after all.
"Why?" Adhil repeated. "After all this time… why are you still looking for him?"
At the end of the day, since Malfoy had a clean record all throughout his probation and had already paid all of the war reparations, his case took a backseat to the new illegal potions ring that was reported later in the evening. Harry already assigned some of his best Aurors to work on the potions ring case since Robards gave him the leeway to work on the Malfoy Manor Case as he sees fit.
Harry tried to find Draco – the Draco he once knew – in Adhil. He tried to pinpoint similarities between the two of them only to come up short.
"Healer Vartan--" The wizard behind the desk said in a surprised tone, not expecting the healer in question to appear out of nowhere.
On one hand, he's already built a life here in France. A reputable one. People are finally looking at him for his skills and expertise alone. On the other hand, however, he would be lying if he says that he doesn't miss anything about where he came from. The letters currently sitting on his study desk attested to that.
While eating and drinking, the two of them looked around as discreetly as possible, taking in the general scene of the pub. It was just before noon so business is still quite slow, just a few workers dropping by for an early lunch. There are currently only four members of the staff on the floor including the bartender, two waitresses, and the host. Nothing seem to be out of place. One of the waitresses set down their food on their table with a slight frown but that's to be expected from anyone that's part of the food service industry.
"It was nice meeting you, Mr. Blanchet." Harry said as he got up from the couch. He knows that he's not likely to get anymore information from the other man. Best to leave now and return another day.
"It was my mother's…" He said, voice calm and even with a hint of nostalgia. "It's a locket given to her when she was just a baby and it's the last thing I have that's hers. I enchanted it so that no one will recognize my face while I'm wearing it."
"Because," Malfoy began. "I'm the only one who has the expertise on the field of language due to my childhood tutoring and higher education. Plus, I'm the only one who has the guts to bite your arse whenever you're being an insufferable prat."
Despite what others might assume, the years did not dampen his determination to find Draco.
"Good morning, Auror Potter!" The cheerful witch standing by the front desk greeted him. "Ms. Lovegood is away on a business trip to the Netherlands. She wouldn't be back until Tuesday next week."
"NO!" The woman screeched so loud that the glasses on the table rattled. "HE DESERVES TO DIE! LET HIM DIE! FILTH OF THE EARTH!"
The young Auror is currently standing in front of Adhil's house. It was the early morning and the sun was shining brightly. He raised his hand to knock on the door when something caught his eye. When Harry first visited the blond's residence, he failed to look closer at the details of the brass knocker but now that the sun is shining directly on it, he couldn't help but notice the imprinted patterns on the metal.
It has been years since Sirius' death and while Harry did manage to accept that, the pain is still there, the pain of a vanished a hope of what they could've been as a family. Despite Sirius leaving everything to him – Grimmauld Place and all of the Black vaults – in the back of his mind, he knows that he will always feel disconnected to it being a Potter and having the portrait of Walburga Black screeching about "Half breeds! Half Bloods! Blood traitors! Filth! Unworthy of magic!" every chance it gets.
"Uh, no," Harry answered. "But I just want to ask them a few questions regarding their work. It would only be for a few minutes, I swear."
Harry just hummed in both understanding and admiration, not really knowing what to say. Luckily, before the silence stretched out to into awkwardness, the chimes by the door tinkled again signalling the arrival of a new person.
Claudette clapped her hands together once, seeming pleased about the last statement.
"I don't--"
The blond looked at the Auror with a blank expression and a tensed jaw. Despite the Muffiliato charm, he knows that they're creating a little bit of a ruckus in the middle of this Muggle establishment. Draco doesn't know what to do. Deep down, he knows that he's dying to finally be who he is. Severus' words was resonating inside his head. While Adhil was the name that gave him glory, his own name – Draco – was given to him by his mother. His name and the locket that he's wearing are the only things from his mother that he can hold on to and damn it all if he's going to let go of either. The Malfoy name may be no more, their fortune distributed to those who deserve them, and their properties having the same fate but that doesn't mean he can't redeem himself as Draco, son of Narcissa…and Lucius.
Harry breathed in deeply before stepping into Gringotts. The goblins may have already forgiven him for that break-in five years ago but that doesn't mean they stopped being wary of his presence. Upon entering the building, Harry was immediately escorted by two guards who flanked his sides. He rolled his eyes and went straight to the Head Goblin at the end of the hall.
"But you must have worked with him, atleast? Or can point me to someone who might have seen him?"
Harry couldn't keep calling him by his last name when he has done so much to erase and go against the Malfoy legacy. He knows that part of the reason why Draco left is to finally start a new life for himself.
It was now Malfoy's turn to roll his eyes. "I'm not that predictable," He said. "And stop trying to distract me. That draft better me on my desk tomorrow at 8AM, Potter. I'd like to stay and chat more but I'm expected at the Manor."
And just like that, the insane woman fell frozen on the ground tied up with thick ropes.
"I don't know. I only noticed it because of this," she replied, tapping the goggles that she wore. She then scooped up the pile of rejects into a bin before resuming her work with a new batch.
"Oh, wow…" Harry heard Hermione gasp. He turned around and saw her gazing at the portrait with awe filled eyes. "This is so beautiful! Who made this?"
"If Draco doesn't want to be found, you won't find him but still…" She said, her face painted with a tired smile. "Thank you for trying."
Harry stepped out of the elevator and looked around. He spotted another reception desk just a short distance away from where he stood.
"What?" He asked, looking at the blond with a dumbfounded expression.
Who knows? Maybe Adhil will open up to him and let him know what he needs to know. For now, Harry is stuck, having reached another dead end with the young Potions Master.
Harry chuckled and stood up to do what he was told.
"Blaise," Pansy called out. "Get your ass in here!"
There's no denying that the three items all hold the same flower. He didn't recognize it at first because of how small the illustration was but

"Oh-- I think I know who you're talking about," Julia replied. "I've seen her here a few times. She comes at around 5pm and leaves just before closing. She usually looks prim and polished… must be having a bad day. I should really get back to work."
"I tested it the other day and it was only effective within a 5-metre radius." George answered as he placed an enchanted glass box over the amulet. The box was designed to be kept in place unless voluntarily taken away so any accidental nudges won't make it budge. "I tried extending the spellwork but the crystal sphere just shatters when I do. It's already one of the sturdier materials that I have unless we get an actual ball made from diamonds."
We can't test it here, in the middle of the shop even though I know a handful of Dark – but completely safe – spells. So, we don't know if it'll be able to handle that sort of magic without the sphere breaking and harming the wearer. Plus, the protective enchantments on this place will not hold too long."
"I think you need to rest. It's probably fatigue. Here," Adhil said, handing Harry the bottle of Dreamless Sleep. "That will knock you out for around 12 hours. Go to the Healers if your head still hurts by then."
"Yes?" Adhil asked, making Harry's attention go back to his face.
As Head of the Investigation Department, a lot of things are demanded from him, expected of him. He couldn't just ignore all of that to go traipsing in France in search for a blond git just because his "gut" tells him to. Besides, he also has his family to take care of. He has a family now. Andromeda and Teddy. Nothing much changed at first but, soon enough, Andy started to treat Harry like her own son, making sure that he's not overworking himself and that he's eating properly and on time. Despite not saying anything about it, Harry knows that Andy truly appreciated what Draco did.
"What is?"
"The last time I saw Draco was three days ago," She said again. "We had tea at the Manor, as we usually do every Sunday."
"Weren't the contents of the letter enough, Potter?" He retorted. "I was feeling sentimental, grateful even. Extremely melancholic."
"How did I know what?"
The receptionist took a few moments to look through her computer, her eyebrows furrowed as she leaned in to read what's on the screen. She then clucked her tongue as she leaned back and addressed Harry.
Harry arrived at the International Portkey Terminal in France with his backpack swung on one shoulder. After getting his luggage and wand checked, he made his way out of the terminal and into the busy streets of Wizarding Paris. He knew little of the French language outside bonjour, bonsoir, au revoir, and all the other basic expressions so he doesn't really know how he'll communicate his way through France. Harry just hopes that the people understand English well-enough to give him the information that he needs.
"Harry, is that you?" Luna's melodic voice was the first thing he heard upon stepping out of the fireplace. A few seconds later, Harry saw his friend emerge from the corner wearing a sunshine yellow summer dress with her long hair styled in a plait that falls to her back. She was barefooted again and he could see each of her toenails painted in different colours.
Everyone, including the newlyweds, obliged and soon Harry, Ron, and Hermione were doing diagnostic spells on the wards and the Floo. In the end, they didn't detect any form of disturbance.
"The teaching position at Hogwarts." Harry clarified. "You should take it. It'll be good for you. I'll be fine…Maybe Luna can look over my manuscripts in the meantime while I'm looking for a different editor. But…you should take it. I know how much you love Potions."
The way Malfoy let that out in one breath before stalking out of the study room gave Harry an unsettling feeling in his stomach. He sighed and rested his head on the desk once again at the sound of Malfoy leaving via Floo.
The voice was calm, formal, and polite. Both familiar and unfamiliar to Harry at the same time. However, now is not the time for fruitless contemplations that only gave him circle reasonings.
Harry chuckled and ruffled Teddy's hair. "I don't think the brides would appreciate it if I was late to their wedding. Especially not your Aunt Pansy." He said the last part in a faux scared tone for some dramatic effect. He then looked up to see Andy watching them from afar. She looked magnificent in her blue dress robes. It had long sleeves but the material looked thin enough for the outdoor summer heat. The two boys went over to where she stood. Harry smiled and gave his adopted mother a hug.
"This one is addressed to you." Parkinson clarified. "I don't know what business you have with Draco for you to warrant a letter but then again, we are yet to find out why hippogriffs fly."
"So, you believe he did this?" Harry asked as Parkinson rounded up the peacocks by conjuring an enclosure. The birds seem to calm down a bit at Parkinson's familiar presence.
"That's…" The Auror breathed out, suddenly feeling deflated. He can always question Draco's truthfulness but, given the situation, Harry's inclined to believe the blond. "That's fucked up. The war's been over for ages…"
His bestfriend physically deflated but then perked up again as a thought seemed to have cross his mind.
Harry shrugged. It's true that he would probably have already made more progress with Hermione's help but he couldn't really handle the concerned looks that he's getting from her everytime he talks about Draco. He figured that Pansy could also be a reliable source of information but the pureblood is still standing firm with her decision to not meddle with things.
We only have TWO chapters left and we're done!
Harry found himself longing to see Draco's eyes. Steel grey eyes that stared at him in recognition back to what seemed like a lifetime ago. Eyes that recognized who he is but refused to sell him out, refused to let him be murdered.
"Is it obvious?"
"That's really so sweet of you, Harry," Hermione said, her face painted with a soft smiling expression, clearly touched by Harry's gift. Harry smiled back, his cheeks slightly heating up at the attention that he's gift was getting. He's still quite glad that he chose to give Pansy and Luna that portrait, to remind them of how much they love each other on a daily basis despite the two of them clearly expressing it since day one.
It was then that Harry looked around to take in the scene that he was surrounded by. The wedding venue was situated in one of the Malfoy properties that Pansy has inherited. At first, it looked to be some sort of garden but he realized that it's really quite far from the definition and idea of a garden. It's more of a space in the middle of a group of overgrown weeping willow trees, their hanging leaves and branches acting like a decorative canopy. A grey carpet ran in between the rows of bronze outdoor chairs. At the end of the walkway was a leafy wedding arch that was more circular than arch-shaped. It looked like it was made mostly out of tree fern, honey bracelet, and white baby's breath flowers.  It, more or less, reflected the taste of both brides.
Harry kept his head rested on his desk. Maybe Malfoy will go away if he ignored him long enough.
The bartender glared at him for a little while longer but said nothing. Instead, he went back to his station behind the bar. He occasionally glanced to where the man is seated, perhaps to keep an eye on him. The two waitresses also steered clear of his area, only going near him to place the bill on his table. They seemed tense for the entire duration that the man remained in the pub. They only relaxed when he finally left five minutes later.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yeah…" Harry was the one to speak up this time. He felt the urge to confirm Luna's query despite everyone in the room already knowing it.
The raven-haired wizard shrugged.
"Fucking son of a bitch is back again." The bartender muttered under his breath.
"S'okay," Harry replied, drinking his beer once again, not really up to eating anything right now. "I think I know who our killer is…"
It's done! Oh god. Thank you so much for everyone who has stuck with this story! I'm so grateful to each and everyone of you. 💖
"Don't you think it's too early to drink?"
"That's fine," Harry assured her, rubbing sleep from his eyes. "Give me fifteen minutes and I'll let you through."
"Hey!"
"You can call them Teddy and Andy, you know." Harry replied, rolling his eyes. "Anyways, they're doing quite well. Andy and Pansy are taking the Wizengamot by storm. Bills that will protect magical creatures and muggles are nearly on their last readings and with Kingsley as Minister, it is only a matter of time before they become actual laws."
Vartan was in the middle of chewing their food when Harry spoke. They seemed to be surprised judging by how they choked on their food followed by a coughing fit.
"That was eventful." Ron commented, grabbing his pint and taking a long swig from it. Harry saw his bestfriend discreetly take out his wand to cast a Muffliato charm over them. "Do you think any of them is our unsub?"
"Y-Yeah, we do!" Julia was the one who answered this time, she rushed over to where the bleeding man was to help him.
"Malfoy left his wand." Ron said, holding his hand out to the Auror Perkins who placed a familiar looking wand in his hand. It was the Ministry regulated wand given to Malfoy during the start of his probation. Restrictions were set on it so that the only spells that he could cast were common household spells, nothing too powerful or unnecessary. "We examined the wand and…the spellwork set to regulate is all tattered. It's like it's been ripped apart by sheer force. There was absolutely no attempt to being subtle about it."
The blond didn't sit back down on his chair though. Instead, he walked a little bit to the side and leaned his body against the kitchen counter.
Harry cast a shield that separated the deranged woman from the group of Muggles.
"Yeah, but it's only a slight tingle. The smaller the disturbance, the less we feel it." Luna replied.
Adhil wiped off the shocked expression on his face and schooled it into the professional front reserved for new customers.
Draco let go of Potter's hand, letting him remove the necklace that he has worn for the better part of the last five years.
Harry got back to the inn in Lyon in one piece. The blinding headache exhausted him but once he stepped out of the shop and into the open air, the throbbing significantly decreased until it fully disappeared. He walked further along the streets of "
"And who might this person be?" The Healer asked as the microwave let out a loud beep, signalling that the food inside was already heated up. Vartan took their food out and sat in front of Harry.
The second transfigured limb was found as a broom in an electronics shop right in the middle of the busiest part in London. The Obliviators had to wipe the memories of no less than twenty Muggles who were in the store that day. Half of them already made a run for it before the Aurors have even arrived at the scene. They had to be quickly chased lest they tattle on what they saw to anybody who would listen. Muggles aren't inclined to believe such bizarre stories but it was still better to be safe than sorry.
The moment he heard the door close and the locks be put back into place, Adhil let out a breath that he hadn't realized he was holding. He then fell back onto the couch, mind running a million miles a minute.
And so they waited.
"Just being with you."
"That's a very sweet gift," Hermione said. "But the fact remains that we didn't know how it got here. Did any of you feel the wards shift? Did it come via owl post? Did he come by via Floo?"
"Was." Harry clarified. The blond was done looking at the snow globe judging by how he set it back on the mantlepiece. "He was a Death Eater, yes. But he wasn't really convicted. Only put on probation. He didn't deserve to be locked up in Azkaban."
"Exactly." Hermione was the one who spoke this time. She let out a sigh before speaking tensely. "And there's something else too… We checked the last few spells performed on the wand. One of them was Fiendfyre...and the other one before that is the Killing Curse."
"You mean Pansy Parkinson?"
"The thing is," Ron was the one to speak this time. "George and I were already talking about Dark Magic even before the arm – long story, Georgie – showed up. And, while this device is already working for regular magical signatures, we are yet to test its compatibility with Dark Magic. As you saw earlier, that shit can be unstable and have a life of its own.
"That's enough, Sonya," Adhil interrupted. "I do believe that we have a crate of beetle eyes that needs sorting?"
As he stared at the now broken emerald wax seal adorning the envelope, only one thing filled Harry's mind.
All Harry did was watch him. Stare at him. Try to make the connection between Adhil's face and Draco's name. But he can't and it's starting to frustrate him. He wants nothing more than to rip off that damned locket from the blond's neck, along with it the effect of the enchantment. He can't do that though. He'll sooner get his ass hexed off than even get close to the locket. Besides, the necklace was pass on to Draco by his mother. It's a family heirloom. Probably the only family heirloom that he has after burning the Manor to the ground.
The first thing that Harry became aware of when he woke up was the darkness that surrounded him. The only light that he could see came from the window. The soft orange tinted light from the street lamps filtered into the room and helped him see.
You are still young, Draco. You've already redeemed yourself. How many medicinal breakthroughs have you had that aided in the treatment of hundreds, if not thousands, of Muggles?
"Do you think we would still have the time to go to Pansy and Luna's for dinner?" Ron asked as they were gearing up to go to 'The Crystal'. The newlyweds just came back from their month long honeymoon in the Amazon two days ago. Having missed their friends, Pansy and Luna Lovegood-Parkinson arranged for a small get together in their home, The Lovegood Estate. It would just be a quaint dinner with all of their closest friends present.
The rest of the night went by quite calmly despite Hubert's boisterous laugh that seemed to constantly fill the pub's atmosphere. Harry and Ron took turns going to the loo to drink more of the polyjuice potion. At half past 10, they decided to go back to Grimmauld Place to reconvene about their observations and discoveries.
Twitter:
"The Killing Curse?!" Harry exclaimed, eyes wide with surprise. "And the Ministry weren't made aware of this? No alarms had set off?"
Adhil just shrugged and muttered something about the Muggle show being the only entertaining thing that he could watch on the telly.
Harry knocked and opened the door to see George leaning over his working table, holding tools that Harry is unfamiliar with while wearing a pair of strange looking goggles.
Draco looked at Harry with a raised eyebrow.
"An extremely difficult potion to experiment with, yes." Adhil interrupted, turning his back to Harry to once again take inventory of the potions that he's got. "I admit, I spent years researching each and every ingredient as well as the effect of each step in the brewing process. In the end, it was a matter of decreasing its recovery time bit by bit, a few hours to a day at a time. It's like the potion is sentient. It can detect if any alterations are attempted on it. If it does, it just becomes as useless as mud water. You have to trick it into becoming more effective."
Harry stared at the final parchment for a long while, blinking twice, reading and re-reading it thrice. A look of disbelief was painted on his face and he could feel the  prickle of incoming tears that he tried to blink away. He could feel his chest constrict and his heart clench.
"It's me..." Draco murmured and his voice sent a jolt throughout Harry's body. He now recognized the blond's voice too. It was so familiar but so different for it lacked the acid that it usually possessed whenever the two of them spoke to each other in the past. It was softer and calmer although it did have a hint of nervousness that Harry just wants to melt away.
The Wizarding World is also a bit kinder now. Thanks to Draco's donation and the presence of both Pansy Parkinson and Andromeda Tonks neé Black in the Wizengamot, legislations that care for creatures' rights are being passed. As of this moment, the "Anti-Discrimination Against Creatures" act is on its final reading before it's to be voted by the council. The said act serves to promote the rights of creatures such as werewolves and centaurs. Anyone who refuses employment for these creatures shall be punishable by law. Harry knows that Andy will fight tooth-and-nail for its passage in honour of her son-in-law. They know that Teddy will benefit from it too because there will always be people who will look at his genealogy instead of his abilities.
They're both blond and excellent at potions, as far as Harry could tell. They both have a regal and elegant air to them, an air that tells people that their every action is done with grace. That's basically where the similarities begin and end. He cannot contrast their personalities since Harry's idea of Draco is based on years of schoolboy rivalry and the antagonistic interaction that they seem to have every time they cross paths. Indeed, the former Slytherin had already redeemed himself in Harry's eyes – mostly due to the blond saving his life along with everything that he has done before disappearing – but he  still don't know Draco enough. He doesn't know him as well as, say, Pansy, Blaise or the rest of the Slytherins that have been on his side the longest.
When he reached the kitchen, Malfoy was already sitting in his usual spot, a cup of tea in one hand and the morning edition of The Daily Prophet in the other. Kreacher was busy directing both kitchen and food items around. A plate of scrambled eggs and toast floated in front of him the moment Harry sat down on his chair. The kettle also poured him a steaming cup of tea.
"My work…" The blond said dryly. "Very well, ask away."
Thankfully, Harry seemed to comprehend what he said. His mouth opened slightly, just enough for Adhil to pour in the potion.
Draco heavily sighed.
In the days that passed, no additional disappearances were reported. This was mostly due to the rotational patrol shifts that the Auror office has implemented. However, additional severed body parts were found, adding truth to the speculation that perhaps none of their victims are alive or in one piece. Most of these parts were found in Muggle areas which gave the DMAC quite a headache.
Harry has to find him. He has to.
"Potter?"
"Oh, wait." Harry said before taking out his wand and tapping it on the item in Pansy's hand. Slowly, the image started to expand until it reverted back to its original size. Pansy now held a portrait in her hands and Harry smiled at their awed reactions.
Harry was just about to say something when he saw Draco wandlessly summon a bottle of brandy from one of the kitchen cupboards – one that's just above and behind Harry's head – and poured quite a lot of it into his tea cup.
"Why are you my editor again?"
"Yeah. But Luna often goes away for long periods of time." Harry said, sounding skeptical and a bit nervous. "Her trips can take up to six months."
Ron and Hermione glanced at each other while Harry just continued to look at the former Slytherin.
Harry spluttered, looking at his bestfriend in disbelief.
"My apologies for taking you by surprise," Vartan started to say. "But I did spend a few years in England during the war. It's difficult not to memorize your face when it's splattered on The Prophet as Undesirable No.1."
That thought made Draco's heart flutter. He doesn't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing.
"Sonya Turgenev," she introduced herself. "Nice to meet you. You're an Auror, aren't you?"
"Thank you, Parkinson." He said, standing up and shaking her hand. "I'll…I'll try my best to find him."
It's silly. They've known each other for years. Decades even. They have been friends for a good chunk of that year but they still call each other by their last names. ("If we go out to Muggle London and I lose you in the crowd, I can't just yell 'HARRY' because everyone and their uncle is probably named Harry.)
Harry was immediately reminded of the crystal balls that Professor Trelawney made them stare into for hours to attempt to read their futures. In the end, he and Ron would just say some made-up bullshit like seeing winged serpents falling from the sky and the water in the Black Lake turning a bright bubblegum pink and being filled with suds.
Malfoy left letters for two people only. Two. For Parkinson, his best friend. And for Harry, his school nemesis. The same Harry that he shared a mutual hatred with for years. The same Harry that he saved in the Manor and who also saved him in return. The same Harry who he helped by throwing his wand, allowing him to, once and for, all defeat the madman who tormented the entire wizarding world for years. Malfoy could've left a letter for Zabini or even Luna. But, he chose Harry. That, in itself, made Harry more than just a little bit determined to find Malfoy and bring him home.
Next update: August 18
"I have brunch with Luna and Pansy every week but even they couldn't get my tea right. They usually just let me make it myself. You would have to have been watching me closely, Draco." Harry teased, the corner of his mouth twitching into a small smirk as he watched the blond's ears redden as it always does when he's a bit flustered. How did Harry know that fact? He doesn't know. Or he knows but he's not about to acknowledge his obsession right now. "So, the necklace?"
"Potter." The blond warned, gripping the Auror's wrist to try and stop him from doing what it was that he was about to do.
He was just about to leave, maybe come back another day, when his ears caught the sound of multiple locks being unlocked and bolts being unbolted. The door started to open and Harry was prepared to see a familiar face, a face that he hasn't seen in so long except in dreams and memories. The face of someone that he spent the majority of the past years looking for. The face of someone that makes him feel all sorts of feelings that he couldn't explain. Feelings that he couldn't even attempt to unpack and untangle without that person in front of him lest he is left to deal with all of it alone for the rest of his life.
Draco smiled awkwardly at Emilia, thankful but also not wanting her to make further comments about his love life.
"It was a miracle! Like magic!" A male's voice exclaimed. Harry turned around to see two elderly men talking to each other. Actually they didn't look that old. He estimated that they were in their fifties. The two of them wore business suits giving Harry the impression that, just like him, they just got off work too. However, while Harry was only on his first pint of the night, these men looked like they've already had a lot to drink judging by the empty glasses on their table. "Can you believe it? After years and years of undergoing chemotherapy, all it took was a trip to France to cure her!"
"I mean," Luna started to say. "What if he used the spellwork in the cabinet and modified it?"
Harry thought that Hogwarts was his home. It was for some time. It was his first true home. A place that accepted him and shaped him into the person that he is today.
He still wants to touch them.
"Ugh," She exclaimed before going on a sarcastic monologue that never fails to amuse them. "Look at me…surrounded by Gryffindors. Married to a Ravenclaw whose closest friends are Gryffindors. What would my Father think? My poor Mother will sob for days upon end! I shall be disowned!"
After jotting down their observations, Harry went back to Grimmauld Place to get ready for dinner at the Parkinson-Lovegood residence. His wedding-slash-housewarming gift for the newlyweds sat on the coffee table in the living room, ready to be picked up before he leaves. The couple refused to accept any gifts immediately after the wedding because they would be off to their honeymoon and wouldn't have time to sort through them. Instead, they told their friends to bring their gifts when they return or to send it to them via owl post.
"Fact check, Potter," Draco spat. "You don't look happier now compared to five years ago. Heck, I'll even go as far as eight years. Stuck with a desk job, are we?"
Harry let out a sigh of frustration as he wipes his face with both hands. He normally had a better temper than this but travelling internationally via Portkey made him a bit cranky, to say the least.
"Double Blood-Replenishing Potions," The blond answered in a more amicable tone. Harry could tell just how much he loves his work. How he loves talking about them as much as he loves brewing them. "Again, they're quicker and more effective. They're very sensitive to temperature though. I enchanted the shelf to have a temperature regulator to keep them cool."
She handed the letter to Harry before putting the other two back in the box and sealing it. She then walked away from the rubble and back onto firm ground.
Five years have passed and yet Harry Potter was still looking for Draco Malfoy.
That night, as Harry sat in front of the fireplace, he thought about how boring his life would probably be without the blonde prat. He chuckled humorlessly, feeling slightly cold despite the heat from the crackling fire.
"True," Ron agreed, watching George work on the amulet once again. "I'll get the permits ready. I'm quite positive that Robards can prioritize them seeing as he's already rushing this entire project."
How will he start looking? Maybe go to Lyon? He couldn't just go there without a firm lead. Yes, the city's name may have been encircled in the maps and Parkinson may have talked about it but it was far from being the only place marked. Maybe the other cities have a bigger significance to the Malfoys, specifically to Draco.
"I guess now we have to get Teddy that new broom we promised to get him." Harry commented, reaching over to grab a chocolate biscuit and eating it in two bites.
"We were young." He replied then stayed silent for a few moments before taking a deep breath. "We were only children during the war. Our actions were fueled by the desire to save ourselves and those we care about. It just so happens that Draco Malfoy got the short end of the stick and he had to be a Death Eater to ensure his and his family's safety.
"What?" Harry asked, both shocked and genuinely confused. "What do you mean? Of course, I'm happy here!"
"Well, you gotta run away from the place that hurt you, right?" Joseph said, picking up a glass and starting to clean it using a white cloth, similiar to how bartenders are usually seen doing. "Gotta start anew. My sister and I thought about going to Asia or some other far away country but we can only speak English so we went here. Can't say it's the best decision but we're making do with what we have. It was pure luck that the previous owner of this place wanted to venture into other business opportunities so he sold us this pub for two thirds of its original price. We get decent money and a place to sleep. A shit ton better than what we had before, to be honest."
"What…" Harry heared his voice trail off. He figured that the blond was examining the contents of the envelope, starting with the wax seal that had a daffodil imprinted on it.
Harry set the necklace down on the counter behind Draco. He then looked at the face in front of him.
"Cast a Statis charm and take him to St. Mungos! Here!" Harry yelled, putting up another shield charm. He then quickly gave Joseph the small bottle cap in his pocket and turned it into a portkey. "It'll activate in five seconds!"
Maybe that's why he finally faltered.
"That doesn't mean she's better than me at something I've been doing for years, Potter. Years!"
"Back to Potter now, are we?" Harry teased, his lips quirking to the side in amusement. He felt giddy. Perhaps it's from the idea that he has finally found Draco or maybe it's from the prospect of spending time with the blond. Or both? He doesn't really know. For now, he'll just go with it.
Harry Potter was at his doorstep. How?
Harry shrugged, grabbing a chip and popping it into his mouth. The starchy saltiness of the fried food satisfied his tastebuds. "The criminal has to be a witch or wizard. I've got a hunch that it's one of the staff but we can't know for sure unless we see any of them perform magic."
A few days after this discovery, another body part was found. This time it was at a Muggle café. William Proudfoot's right leg was transfigured into a microphone stand. The café's manager said that she got surprised when suddenly all of her guests started screaming in the middle of Poetry Night. One moment, the person on stage was holding onto the microphone stand and the next, the poor lad was confused as the mic detached from its place and his audience fell eerily silent. They looked down to see a man's severed leg on the ground where the mic stand should've been. Upon investigation, it seems like the spellwork on this one was abruptly disturbed seeing as it didn't have the time to rot and it just immediately went back to being flesh. The Forensics division of the Investigation Department was called in immediately. They concluded that the victims were still alive while their limbs were being ripped off from their sockets. This is because the flesh was still soft and warm with blood freely gushing out from the severed end.
"That's exactly the point isn't it?!" Draco nearly shouted back. "Why the fuck do I care? Oh, probably because I can see and hear how the Wizarding World is still giving you shit while you run around and do their bidding!"
Ron chose that moment to come back, immediately grabbing a chip from the basket as he took a seat.
"Oh, please." She dismissed their actions with a roll of her eyes before running the blade of the dagger on her palm, cutting the delicate skin and letting the blood ooze out and drip onto the box. She did all of this without flinching, the slight twitch of her brows being the only visible sign of discomfort.
"Didn't Draco fix the Vanishing Cabinet back when you were all in sixth year?" Luna asked out of the blue after the trio finished casting their spells. Everyone seemed to freeze despite the length of time that has passed since the year when Death Eaters have managed to get into Hogwarts.
Flustered.
"You ought to report him to the police." Harry suggested, draining his mug of beer.
"I'll have authorized personnel take them," She said to the trio stiffly. "They'll bear the legal papers you need along with a signed authorization letter from me. In the meantime, you should keep them in the enclosure and wait for my owl."
"I'm sorry but Dr. Laurent doesn't accept meetings without prior notice. I can set up an appointment for you through his assistant if you'd like." Celeste offered with a kind smile.
"Yeah…?"
That was three weeks ago.
The goblin was right. Despite the thickness of the folder, it held nothing more than basic bank statements. Something that the goblins are allowed to show any Ministry official that asks for it. Anything beyond that would require permission from the member of the family, their solicitor, or their chosen heir. However, they still contained information that Harry found useful.
Forty five minutes have passed, Harry and Ron made small talk while discreetly glancing every so often at the woman at the far corner of the pub. She stayed there, the constant flow of beer serving as her only entertainment. Quite a number of pints decorated the top of her table and she must already be intoxicated because she stopped tapping her feet on the floor. Instead, she just peered at everyone. Waiting. Just waiting. The people are starting to leave one-by-one until there's only about a total of eight guests including the woman, the two Aurors, and five other people who they assume to be Muggles.
"Uhm, hello?" An awfully familiar voice said from behind him, making Adhil snap his head towards the direction of the door. There, standing awkwardly at the entrance of his shop was none other than Harry Potter. How he knew that Adhil had a shop at all was a mystery… or maybe it wasn't. He would have to talk to a certain acquaintance later this evening.
Harry sat up properly and waited for Draco to open the letter.
"You absolute fucking idiot." was the last thing Harry heard before soft lips met his.
Is it possible that Adhil Blanchet and Draco Malfoy are the same person?
After a year of trying to be employed and pursuing apprenticeships - all of which have turned him down - he decided that it might be a good idea to venture into the Muggle world since no one would see him as ex-Deatheater Malfoy. There, he's just a blonde kid with an ugly tattoo. Harry didn't know the particulars of his stay there. All he knows is that Malfoy entered University, took up a language major for some reason and he was about to start his career as a professor until he and Harry went out for drinks to contemplate about the latter's lack of  direction in life. That night, Harry  mentioned how much he liked making stories and Malfoy jokingly said that Harry can write a book and that he would be more than happy to "make sure you don't make an utter fool of yourself". Here they are, years later, being friends and business partners of some sort.
In all honesty, he was surprised that it worked. Each letter that he sends Pansy insistently tells her that he's happy, he's okay, he's eating three meals a day (a bit of a lie), and that he's never going back to Britain. That rules her out as someone who will try and find him even if he gives her a million clues. That's just how they respect each other. For his actions to lead Potter here, that would mean that he never did stop looking. He never did stop searching. Never let go of the hope that maybe one day he'll find Draco.
After that, they were all dismissed. The Aurors and other personnel from the DMAC filed out of the conference room. Harry and Ron followed suit. However, instead of going back to their offices, the two of them headed to Weasley's Wizard Wheezes
"Aren't you going to heal that?" Hermioned inquired, gesturing to her bleeding palm.
Harry smiled as she watched Luna walk down the aisle with her bestfriend. Ginny looked wonderful too and, for a second, Harry felt a pang of regret at what they could've been. The two of them would probably have already been married by now but things were a bit too unstable after the war. Harry revelled in not having to run away for his life anymore and Ginny was all too focused in graduating from Hogwarts and becoming a Quidditch star. They had a long conversation a year after the war and decided that they were better off as friends. And they were. Whereas Ron and Hermione often tried to sympathize with him, Ginny was frank and was a no-nonsense kind of woman. She encouraged him to stop feeling guilty about every single death brought upon by the war. She convinced him to go to a Mind Healer to deal with the trauma. She knocked some sense into his head after Harry jokingly (or not) commented that he should've went "on" instead of coming back. Harry often thought about what would happen if they ended up together but, to be honest, he saw her as more of a sister than anything else.
Draco took Harry's hands in his and held it firmly.
"Why not?"
"Harry, mate… I know you can take care of yourself," Ron said calmly, his eyes conveying the expression of genuine concern. "We just want you to be very careful – more careful – this time. Think things through before jumping into them. We're not partners anymore so I can't stop your 'jump now, think later' tendencies. You can ask us for help too, you know. Malfoy may be a git and none of us may ever get along with him but a breathing, annoying git is better than a dead one."
"I'll have an iced Americano, please. I'll pay for his order as well. Thank you!" Potter said, stepping to stand by his side. Draco looked at Potter with furrowed brows and face scrunched in an expression of both shock and confusion.  The barista, on the other hand, looked at them with amusement.
Harry shook his head with a chuckle. He then put the pouch inside his pocket and Flooed home.
"I'm me." The blond restated, the corner of his lips quirking up into a nervous smile. "And you don't hate me…?"
"Lower your wand this instance, you prat." Malfoy growled. Harry rolled his eyes and set his wand back on the end table, his stance relaxing. He rubbed his face with both hands and let out a loud groan.
Two days later, Harry and Ron were just about to enter The Crystal once again when they caught sight of a flyer pasted on the pub's wall. It was a missing person's flyer of the loud man who frequented the pub: Hubert.
Harry couldn't help it.
"Joseph seems like an honest man." Ron commented as Harry set down a mug lf tea in front of him. Their case files were scattered all over the table as they made sense of everything that has happened so far. They need to be quick lest they risk the disappearance of another wizard.
He thought that Grimmauld Place was his home. Not really. It was just a place for him to stay that connected him to Sirius and thus, the rest of the Black family but it was now going to be a home for children who deserve to be loved. Not his.
"I have one question though," Harry said as the three of them were taking off their goggles. They planned on going to the Leaky Cauldron to eat lunch before going back to the Ministry. "How far does the person have to be for the amulet to detect them?"
"Draco Malfoy."
"What's the other spell?" Parkinson finally spoke after her second glass of whiskey.
From within the group, Pansy let out a grumble as she scrunched her face in fake disgust.
However, despite its kinder appearance, it still really isn't a home for Harry. It's merely a place where he sleeps and resides after work. It lacks the feeling of safety and belongingness that he felt when he was at Hogwarts. He thought about quitting the Auror force and becoming a professor at Hogwarts just to feel that homey feeling again but there are just too many bad memories there that are sure to haunt him for days upon end. Not only that but he also has a job to do.
"What?" Harry asked.
"What do you mean?"
"You better take care of yourself, Potter. I will personally slice you if you don't come back to me in one piece."
The blond closed his eyes and took a deep breath.
Did Harry overstep his boundaries?
That was what he was. He was flustered. He wants to know why exactly he was flustered but Malfoy rising from his chair snapped him out of his thoughts.
The explosion's epicenter seemed to have been the basement, judging from rhe large hollow space that could be seen. It wasn't a huge explosion per se but it was loud and powerful enough to take the whole house down. Surprisingly, there are no casualties. The Manor was bar of any living being. The only breathing specimen left on the property were the albino peacocks in the front lawn. They were screeching like mad but two aurors were assigned to take care of them until such a time that their fates would be decided. As Mulligan said, a small fire seemed to burn forever in what once was the West Wing. Hermione still has to inspect it. If anyone can put it out, it would be an Unspeakable like Hermione or just Hermione in general. However, that everlasting fire is not the only strange thing in this situation.
Harry immediately perked up.
"Adhil," Harry greeted back, his mouth forming into a smile despite the hammering of his heart in his chest. This time, he didn't need Sonya to tell him that the Masidec is glowing as it hung from his neck. "Going somewhere?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"You're my home now." He said, cupping Draco's cheek in one hand and using his thumb to softly caress it. The blond couldn't help but lean into Harry's gentle touch. "Besides, you're the one who told me to follow my heart."
Harry fell back on the bed so he grabbed a pillow and threw it hard in Malfoy's general direction. He was sporting a mild headache and it was probably from drinking a third of the firewhiskey last night. For some reason, he had trouble sleeping. Hermione banished all of the Dreamless Sleep in the house for fear that Harry become dependent on it. Atleast drinking helps.
"He's been acting unusually for years now. Right after the war. I was concerned at first but when time passed and nothing happened, I started to wave off his strange whispering. I guess that was my first mistake. I should've kept my guard up."
The young Auror kindly smiled at the receptionist, finding her both easier and harder to talk to than Celeste. The familiar face was nice – he was accustomed to the concept of twins after all – but it was also strange because they looked exactly the same, from their faces to their uniforms up to their hairstyles. They also spoke the same way, adopting the professional and friendly tone that Harry could recognize despite the language barrier. It was strange indeed but Harry just shook it off. He wasn't here to analyze people. He was here to find one.
"Me? Well, I…I helped the mother calm down." Harry answered, looking back at the time when he was just beside the mother winged-horse, patting and caressing the side of its body to get her to calm down. "She got so antsy in the middle of it that we were afraid she was going to fly off. But luckily, we managed to calm her down with massages and potpourri."
"I mean, you wouldn't be stuck here with me anymore. You wouldn't be stressed out over me missing deadlines. You wouldn't be forced to take care of me anymore… I don't even think I'm paying you enough for all the things you've done for me." Harry mumbled, pushing the food on his plate around with his fork.
The events that occured 12 hours earlier were all coming back to him now. He was just about to leave the shop when Sonya caught his attention and called out the thing that's on his chest. The Masidec glowed. The Masidec glowed a baby blue shade earlier while he was at "
"The other week, I asked you the day and time in which you can finish the rough draft of your manuscript," Malfoy said as he began to pace around Harry's office. "You told me that you'll have it ready by Wednesday at 8PM. Imagine my surprise when the clock struck 8 in the evening and yet, my desk stayed empty."
"I was actually wondering if I could talk to any member of the treatment program? Celeste mentioned that Dr. Laurent is not available but is there someone else in-charge that I could talk to?"
"I'll take them," She said before letting out a deep sigh. "Draco may be gone but he wouldn't want me to just leave them."
"Maybe it'll be better if we check the wards just in case?" Ron suggested, getting up from his position on the floor and taking his wand out.
Harry saw Pansy's eyes darken as she looked at the phallic item in her wife's hand, probably already imagining their future bedroom activities that will involve the said item. Luna only stared at it curiously, looking at the pink vibrator in from every angle until she found whatever it was that she was looking for. Harry realized that she found it when the object started to make a low whirring sound while it vibrated in her hand.
The search lasts for five years.
"It led me to you, didn't it?" He then picked up the cup of tea from table and took a careful sip. The Auror's brows perked at how perfect the tea is made. It tasted like how he would make it at home. Early grey with two sugars and a splash of milk. Harry looked at Draco. "How did you know?"
"Could be," Hermione nodded, although her face held an expression that says that she's not at all fond of house-elves being used for errands like these. "He can still summon them anytime right? From what I've heard, Malfoy didn't set any of them free."
"Well, there's a lot of things. Most of them  make no sense but it's the flowers that helped me." Harry continued after he downed the contents of the potion vial. While he spoke, he stared straight ahead. He found the sigh of the fallen leaves calming and not looking at Draco helped both his headache and his reasoning. His brain isn't as torn between believing that Draco is Adhil and not believing that they're the same person. "You seem to like daffodils a lot. It's everywhere. Your shop's logo has them. Your tea cups have them. Your letters have them."
Their conversation went to different directions after that, swerving into various topics that took them farther and farther away from the discussion of whether or not Draco will ever take off his enchanted locket. Harry didn't mind too much though. He's determined to keep his promise to not force the blond into doing something he's not keen on doing. Besides, he likes talking about his family and friends and sort of updating Draco as to what has been going on in his absence.
"But, there would have to be another Vanishing Cabinet here for him to do that." Hermione countered.
"Yeah! Sorry, mate!" Ron replied, quickly dodging a stunner. It went straight to the wall of the bar where shelves upon shelves of alcohol were stocked. The bottles of liquor exploded and sprayed their contents everywhere. "We'll handle this, protect the Muggles! Do you have anti-apparition wards on? We can't let her get away!"
"I think I could spare five minutes." A deep melodic voice suddenly spoke from somewhete behind Harry, cutting off whatever the Auror was about to say. He turned around to see a tall, dark-skinned woman dressed in ivory white Healer robes that indicated their status as head of one the department. They sported a buzz cut that's been dyed blond and high cheekbones that intimated Harry just a tad bit. He would've been more intimidated if the Healer didn't have dark circles under their eyes paired with a tired smile.
"Say," Harry called out just as Joseph was about to walk away. His voice adopted the same low, grumbling tone of the Swedish tourist that they nicked the hairs from. "My friend and I are wondering if you can suggest some really awesome sightseeing spots? We just got here a few days ago and have already exhausted most of the museums."
Immediately, Parkinson rushed to where the voice was coming from with Harry, Ron, and Hermione trailing behind her. They arrived at the burned down West Wing of the Manor where the everlasting fire was. However, the said fire was nowhere to be seen. Instead, a small wooden box was left in its wake. Seeing as it hasn't been reduced to ashes like the rest of the house, the box is probably enchanted.
"Good morning, Malfoy. Kreacher." He greeted.
"Oh, do you have an appointment with Dr. Laurent?"
However, she never did work well under pressure. The moment that she sensed Aurors patrolling the area, she stopped herself from getting another victim, scared that she'll get caught. However, the frustration of not being able to carry out her self-sworn duty while being forced to deal with men that she hated got to her. She became paranoid and fidgety. She felt like eyes were watching her everywhere she goes. In the first weeks of the patrol, Geneva stayed in her house. She only went outside for work. This routine worsened her paranoia. And so, she decided to bring some normality back in her life by visiting The Crystal.
Harry felt a bit relieved at that. Being known as a faux criminal was preferable over having a stalker all the way from France.
The look that met him wasn't that of hatred. No. It was far from that. Quite far from that. Draco didn't want to assume but Potter looked at him with such relief and admiration. It made his heart skip a beat. It caught him so off guard that he almost forgot to breathe.
However, her mind was so fragile and she was insane enough as it is so she snapped at the first sign of a man being disrespectful towards a woman.
"Oh, are we doing this now?" Harry heard Ron say before he felt his bestfriend join the hug.
Kudos and comments are always appreciated. 💖
"Ah, that's Pansy Parkinson-Lovegood to you, love." She corrected before letting out a gasp at the gifts that Harry was holding. Pansy gently took the bottle of sherry from his hand and examined it closely. "Morgana's saggy tits… Is this actual Goblin-made sherry? Goblin-made sherry from the 1940s? A decade after sherries were invented? Harry James Potter, you are a man after my own heart. Too bad I don't like men, though."
Auror Potter, I'll be sending any and all evidence to your division, including this arm, as I'm sure you would want to examine it further. I also want you to work with Auror Weasley on the development of the magical signature device. I trust that it will be ready in the soonest possible time."
"We're not ruling anything out until the investigation is complete," Hermione interjected. "However, there is no doubt that Malfoy was the one who set the Manor on fire. I'll hand you the file later but we have examined almost everything in the property. Dark magic was definitely used, that's for certain but not in the way that one would expect."
"Do you know what he said that night? He said that he was going to burn the Manor down even if it's the last thing he ever does. It scared the living hell out of me because… the way he said it… I half expected him to start casting incendios all over the place right at that moment."
"Got it, thank you so much!"
It feels like an overexaggeration but Harry felt the world stop when those grey eyes finally looked back at him. They were more beautiful than he remembered them to be.
"Yeah, a bit."
And so Harry was left alone with his thoughts. And Kreacher, who was busy cleaning. But mostly his thoughts.
"You got that right. Born and raised in New York." He said proudly, making his American accent more prominent.
"I wanted to thank you." Harry answered simply, leaning back on the bench. This time he spared a glance to the blond's face but quickly looked away before the confusion starts to settle in again. It was just a quick glance but he did manage to see the other man's stunned expression. "If you're really who I think you are, I owe you a lot. Not just my life but my family too. You don't know how much it meant to me to actually be named Sirius' heir and...call Teddy and Andy my family."
Where could Draco Malfoy be?
"Give it to me." Pansy said with an even tone as she held out her hand towards Harry.
"Sir, I would suggest you get your hands off her," She said in a faux sweet voice. Despite the smiling expression on the waitress' face, Harry could see that her jaw was tensed and that the man was three seconds away from being punched. "The service that you are looking for is not available at this establishment nor will we ever offer it."
"It's him, right? Does he know?" Sonya asked the moment Harry was gone. Adhil took a deep breath sat down on the chair that the Auror was occupying a mere minutes ago.
"Normal people wouldn't try and find magical traces in a gift, Potter." Draco tried to argue. "That's borderline obsessive behaviour."
Ron's eyes brightened up and Harry could almost see the light bulb that lit up in his head.
"Should've said that to me first rather than aiming your wand like a madman." The blonde murmured, flipping the Prophet to the next page.
"Touché." Ron said, lifting his mug as a sign of agreement.
With every year that passed, Pansy could see the light and fire slowly vanish from Potter's eyes, extinguished by the repetitive routine and the act of doing whatever the hell would please everyone. The war is over indeed but Potter has never and will never stop being the Chosen One. He could do whatever he pleases, yes but she highly doubts that Potter could take the backlash. And so, the man's spirit diminished. However, Pansy's life wasn't the only thing that changed in the past 24 hours. For the first time in years, she could see the flicker of determination in Potter's eyes grow stronger. The fire was starting to burn again.
"Yes," Harry confirmed. "It makes sense. Hubert has always been loud and rude but nothing has ever happened to him, not until he decided to manhandle one of the staff."
"But," the Healer said, raising a hand to cut off whatever Harry was about to say. "I can refer you to the Potions Master that's been helping us brew the Cell Cleansing Potion. He is an absolute genius, one of the best people that I've ever met. If Mr. Malfoy truly is seeking an apprenticeship – in Potions, atleast – he would be one of the people that he would go to. If not… then I guess you know how to go on from there."
"What if we test it in the Ministry?" Harry suggested. "I know that they have a facility where they examine magical objects with unstable magic, be it Dark or otherwise. If not, we can always use one of the vacant Auror training rooms. Those have some of the strongest protective spells that I've ever seen in my life."
"I'm Healer Vartan," They introduced themselves. "I understand that you have some questions for me. I would suggest a more formal venue like my office but, seeing as I am yet to have my first meal of the day, the department's break room would suffice, yes?"
"Potter," Parkinson spoke formally as Harry entered her office. "How nice of you to drop by. Have a seat."
"Ladies and gentlemen," The Ministry official began, successfully shushing the crowd who, before then, were murmuring  in awe at the sight in front of them. Harry can't blame them though. Pansy and Luna were positively glowing with love for each other. "We are all gathered here today to witness the union of two faithful souls…"
"Hi, I'd like to know where Building B is and how I can get there?"
Draco heaved a sigh and ran a hand through his hair. The two of them sat in silence for a quite some time before the blond finally spoke.
"True," Harry mumbled under his breath as he remembered that specific case. "Who would've thought that an old woman would be behind a series of robberies…and for no particular reason except to fulfill a bucketlist."
"But I wouldn't be able to find you without it! And we got the inspiration from you so, I guess you helped us find…you?"
This is how Harry found himself standing in front of a potions shop named "La Jonquille". He doesn't know what that means. Its name was written in a fancy gold script against the muted green wood of the building's facade along with an illustration of a wreath of flowers. The shop is located in a street that's a little further away from the hustle and bustle of the main shopping district. He could see a number of witches and wizards still walking around but it was significantly less crowded here. "
"What about me?" Draco asked with furrowed brows, moving his arm to let his head rest on his hand so that he can look at Harry more comfortably.
Twitter:
"Celeste?" Harry asked, confused.
Her attention seemed to be caught by something on Harry's chest.
Belinda went to where the offices were and came back to tell Harry that Ms. Parkinson is free to see him now. He walked to the door labelled "Publisher's Office", knocked three times and went in once prompted.
"Make amends with your past to avoid regrets in the future." That's what his godfather told him.
"He's not dead." Harry insisted. "His…his letter didn't sound like he was going to kill himself anytime soon. Leave? Yes. But die? I don't think so."
That's cool! This is such a great opportunity for Malfoy. Maybe that's why the blonde isn't home right now. Maybe he's at Hogwarts discussing his future employment. Wow. A language professor and a part-time Potions professor too. Not to mention that fact that he's also gonna be the head of Slytherin house. It suits Malfoy. If anybody can get those students in line, it'll be Malfoy. He's been doing a splendid job in doing that to Harry.
And before he knew it, Harry was engulfed in a group hug with the newlyweds. It was at this point that the fireplace flared to life with the arrival of their friends.
"Ah, Adhil, you did not tell me that you've got a boyfriend!" The barista, Emilia, said in French. Draco thanked his lucky stars that Emilia can't speak English because the situation is bizarre enough as it is. He did not need Harry to know that people assume that they're lovers.
Harry's speculations were confirmed the moment that he cast the spell that Robards used on the arm to detect residual Dark Magic. Dark purple sludge started to ooze out from Hubert's cut off neck, indicating that a dark spell was used to cut it off. It seems like it was the spell used to rip off the other victims' limbs as well because the head also sported tear patterns.
"Good," Robards nodded in understanding. "I suggest visiting the Muggle pub. Take Weasley with you. There's no evidence that this is the work of Dark Wizards but we cannot say that it isn't either."
"Well, The Firebolt is better when it comes to speed and acceleration." Draco said, weighing in the two options. "However, Tornadoes have proven to be very durable. It's not as fast as the Firebolt but they say that it can last for more than a decade with proper care. And really, what need does a second year have for a top speed professional level broom?"
"I don't fancy being around children for days upon end," Malfoy spoke matter-of-factly. "And I take personal insult that you compared my level of work to that of Lovegood's!"
"It's a kind of song bird that sings to make people horny." Pansy supplied with a chuckle at their friends' questioning looks. The others let out varying sounds of understanding before they shared a good laugh, not because they find anything particularly funny but because of how they could feel the strong bond of friendship that they shared.
Twitter:
Draco cannot deny.
"Good morning, Belinda." Harry greeted back. "That's fine. I'm actually here for Pansy Parkinson…?"
"You're barking mad."
"I love you too."
"Vodka?" Harry asked. "As in, the liquor? The 'two shots and you're hammered" liquor? That's your secret?"
In time, the French Ministry of Magic decided to work together with its Muggle counterpart for the improvement of both Muggle and Magical healing. At first, magic was only used to improve a patient's recovery time and only during the most dire of circumstances. However, just a few years back, they were approached by a man who introduced himself as Adhil Blanchet. He presented them with the idea of using the Cell Cleansing Potion on Muggles along with an experimental formula that reduced the recovery time by 10% at first. Blanchett is still working with them in an effort to improve the potion to the best of their abilities without sacrificing its safety and effectiveness. The Potions Master is also coming up with new discoveries on a daily basis but Auclair refused to tell Harry what exactly those discoveries are.
"This is a Magical Signature Detecting device. The Masidec for short," Harry explained, ignoring the snort that came from Adhil. "Couldn't we have picked a better name? Sure. But functionality won over creativity. And this little thing is why I'm here, right in front of you, Adhil or perhaps I should call you Draco?"
Another memory hit him.
"Sonya, this is my friend, Harry Potter."
"Sure! Thanks! Sorry for disturbing you." Harry said with an embarassed smile. Julia chuckled and gave him a pat on the shoulder before walking away to serve other guests.
"Wouldn't it be better if you get Hermione's help with that?" Angelina asked. "Things will progress at a faster rate."
Harry immediately jolted upright from his bed, his wand out and aimed at the door. It took him three whole seconds to recognize the voice that bellowed throughout the hallways of his house. Unfortunately, it took less than that for his guest to make the flight of stairs and slam his bedroom door open.
"Yes," Pansy confirmed, letting out a sigh as she placed the pouch and empty boxes on the coffee table along with the small note. Harry took this opportunity to grab the note and read it for himself. He almost shivered at the familiar – albeit tiny – script. He practically has Draco's handwriting imprinted on his brain by the number of times he has read and re-read the letter. "But, our wards are attuned to elves as well. We would feel any sign of disturbance, be it an animal, a house-elf, or an insect. We can't have a Skeeter-wannabe disturbing our privacy."
"There are a total of five people working in The Crystal," Thimble started. "One cook, two waitresses, a host, and a bartender. This includes the owners, Joseph and Julia Freeman, who are both working as the bartender and as one of the waitresses respectively."
"Thanks, Anj!" Ron said, nicking a caramel from the counter and popping it into his mouth.
His eyes widened and he felt his heart stop.
Malfoy's temper has significantly decreased ever since Lucius was freed from Azkaban three months ago. It's been a decade and Harry thought that Malfoy would've already forgiven his father after such a long time. He's clearly mistaken. The contempt and anger isn't the same as before but they're still there. Malfoy's life did get ruined by Lucius' poor choices of following a mad man. Malfoy – Draco – struggled so much in their first year after graduating from Hogwarts. No one wanted to hire him because of his status as an ex-Deatheater. His heart shattered when he was rejected a Potions apprenticeship because of his "previous loyalties". Harry offered to help him because, of course they would listen to their Savior. However, Malfoy shut down that idea quicker than anyone can say Erumpet.
Parkinson remained silent for a long time. She then pulled out a glass and a bottle of whiskey from her desk drawer and poured herself a drink.
Draco sighed and ran a hand through his hair.
"Malfoy used dark magic, specifically blood magic. We haven't looked into it thoroughly but we have a theory that it's something to do with the wards." Ron explained. "We'll go back there tomorrow and check out the spellwork of the wards…or what's left of them anyways. They're all tattered from what I can tell."
Blaise, on the other hand, had the most interesting gift. One that heated up everyone's cheeks in embarassment – everyone except for Luna, Pansy, and Blaise that is.
There's only one thing that's worrying him though.
The place was right in the middle of the countryside, amongst the vast fields of wheat and corn in North Yorkshire. On it stood a small farm with an adequately sized barn alongside a quaint house. The Muggles who owned the place were a family that descended from generations and generations of farmers. Every single day, the mother would milk the cows while the father tended to the fields. The children would feed the chicken and the grandparents could be found either sitting on the front porch or helping with their crops. Their life was fairly quiet and they get by quite well with what they earn from the farm. All in all, it was a place where a severed human body part is least expected to be found.
Malfoy shrugged.
Four victims in a span of nearly four weeks. None of them seem to be connected except for the fact that they are all males. Their ages do not coincide with each other, their jobs are different, and their blood status are of high variance.
"Fortunately, no. I'm here on official Auror business. As I'm investigating the disappearance of Mr. Draco Malfoy, I would need to see his latest bank statements along with any receipts of his expenses for the past year or so."
"We got a report at around 6AM of a panicked employee at a Muggle convenience store about how his table was doing odd things and that he might be hallucinating." The blue-haired man narrated. "According to the Muggle, the table upon which his radio was sitting on started to turn an strange shade of green and emit a truly repelling odour. We have sent Obliviators along with the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad on-site. They have confirmed that the said table is behaving in an unnatural way and that the stench was enough to send people running for miles in the opposite direction.
The Auror shook his head. He was still sold on the theory that a close proximity would be required for the device to work to its fullest capacity because of how little of Draco's magical signature he has managed to get into hollowed crystal. That means that Draco must have been in the room for the Masidec to glow.
Adhil sighed.
"So, you mean to say that our killer could have been in the pub during that day?"
"Anyways, has anyone ever done any research on magical signatures?" Ron asked after they have gone through what they have so far in regards to The Missing Wizards case. "They're awfully useful when it comes to cases like this. Imagine if we could just bottle up their…I don't know…essence or something and then let that find them. It would make things a hell of a lot easier."
"You always say that, Potter." Malfoy dismissed his brattiness. "Come. I asked Kreacher to prepare breakfast. Your tea is waiting, Your Specky Highness."
Roughly fifteen minutes later, he's sat by the dining table with Ron, who he called as soon as he was done with the firecall, in front of Aurors Felicity Thimble and Daisy Grunhild. They handed him a folder filled with information about The Crystal.
"Ah, I'm afraid that's not possible. As much as I can let you take a look at the documents, I am under strict orders to not release a single copy of them to anyone but the chosen heir or representative."
"I'm happy here. " Adhil – Draco – said, his voice even but not entirely convincing. "I'm safe here. No one knows who I am. I help people. They don't see me as a Malfoy anymore."
"You can't tell me how to live my life, Malfoy." Harry hated how easy it was to say the blond's name with such disdain as if the two of them are rivals once again. Maybe the venom that his tone held is because of how close Draco actually got to how Harry actually felt. None of his other friends seem to realize what the blond did. Perhaps they did realize it but they were just too afraid to tell him or they thought it wasn't their place to point it out.
Harry, Andy, and Teddy were led to their seats by who Harry recognized as Daphne Greengrass-Bulstrode. Her wife was probably with Pansy to help her get ready. He spotted Ron and Hermione who were already sat down as well as Neville, George, Angelina, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Bill, Fleur, Blaise Zabini, Theodore Nott, and a couple more of their fellow Hogwarts alumni along with other people that he didn't recognize. Perhaps, they were friends of the other bride from her travels.
The warmth. It spread throughout his body like taking a warm bath after a cold winter's night. His body felt warm, his heart fluttered inside his chest. His mouth suddenly felt dry. There were so many emotions swirling inside him and he could only identify two, for now.
"Fine!" The man exclaimed, pulling away from the bartender's grip. The two of them glared at each other for some time before the drunk man went back to his drink while grumbling. "A man can't have fun anymore these days… too many righteous bastards."
Vartan then vanished the remnants of their lunch and took a deep breath before finally, finally speaking.
"Can I help you, Mr. Evans?" Celeste asked once Harry was in front of her again.
Parkinson only hummed in affirmation.
"It's psychoanalyze but thanks for the warning."
"So, it's not any of those?" Harry asked. Hermione shook her head.
Harry looked at his best friends with pleading eyes, hoping that they would either understand or just leave him be. Hermione was just about to say something when Ron laid a gentle hand on her shoulder to stop her. He then took a deep breath.
"Harry!" The cheerful voice of a child greeted him as he arrived at the garden. A flash of turquoise was all he saw before he found himself ambushed by a small figure. The face of his godson, Teddy looked up at him with a bright smile as he hugged his godfather tightly as if they hadn't just seen each other last night at dinner. "You're here! And right on time! Auntie Mione said that you would probably be late again--"
Harry's thumb went over to caress Draco's lower lip, revelling in their fullness and softness. He heard the blond's breath catch and felt him froze up.
The next day, Harry filed a one-week leave of absence from work. Once it was approved, he immediately went to France bringing nothing but a bag that contained essentials, the pouch that Luna gave him, and the version of the Masidec that he wore a few days back.
"Too expensive. Way too expensive. Get this…" Kevin started to lower his voice. Harry discreetly waved his wand to slightly amplify the man's voice for him. "They didn't admit Martina for cancer treatment specifically. They said that it was just for research. Something about trying experimental medicine. Miranda figured she didn't have much too lose so she agreed. And here we are close to two months later!"
"It's the least I could do for the man who saved us all from the Dark Lord." The Healer said simply. "I'll have Auclair give you the name and address of our Potions Master. If you have any questions, feel free to ask him."
Harry is a bit bothered, to say the least. He was so used to the Wizarding World being so separated from Muggles that the idea of them working together and being "blended" in this kind of establishment – for the betterment of Muggles, nonetheless – is strange. While he is shocked, he finds that he kind of agrees with what's going on here. Harry did grew up amongst Muggles and is now living in the Wizarding World so he has a vague idea of the pros and cons of each. He remembers Hermione say that even though witches and wizards have come up with various potions and spells that can cure ailments in a heartbeat, they are still way behind in terms of technology, architecture, and in Scientific things like anatomy. In short, the Wizarding World can learn a thing or two about Muggles and vice versa.
" is sandwiched between a magical menagerie shop on the left and a fancy looking robes shop on the right. Harry figured that there's a café nearby judging by the faint smell of pastries that's mingled with other strange smells coming from the menagerie.
"You want to be a Magizoologist?" Draco clarified, blinking away the last remnants of sleep. "That's great, Harry."
The incident started with just a single missing wizard. Pollux Grimbleton, 46, was reported missing by his wife when he didn't come home from work. At first, Mrs. Grimbleton thought that her husband got sidetracked by an important business like a rare potions ingredient auction. However, when he failed to come home the next day, she finally decided to firecall the apothecary that he worked at. His husband's assistant said that the last time he saw Grimbleton was when he left the shop the night before. No one in Diagon Alley nor Knockturn Alley had seen him so Mrs. Grimbleton decided to go to the Aurors. The initial investigation showed that Grimbleton seemed to have disappeared in an empty alleyway as witnesses have said that they saw him walking down the street from his shop. One, the owner of a bread rolls cart, even saw him turning at a corner before he got distracted by customers wanting to purchase his goods. Not even the cart owner's memory could help in figuring out the manner in which Grimbleton has disappeared.
Adhil was and still is a stranger to him.
"Hmm..." Vartan hummed again. They look like they were thinking deep about something. Harry just sat there. Waiting. The both of them just sat in silence for a few minutes. It was starting to make Harry uncomfortable. He was hungry and tired but he'll be damned if he was going to be intimated by the Healer in front of him, not when he feels like he's already getting closer to finding Draco.
"I just bought new robes! I wore them to the last book signing, didn't I? I could just wear that." Harry sat up and tried to argue but he knows it's futile. It seems like Malfoy is in one of his moods where he's not going to take "NO" as an answer. A challenging stare quipped by a raised brow was all it took for Harry to oblige. "Fine! I'll go get new robes! But…but…but I'll hate it!"
Harry noticed the amulet on his chest glow a strong navy blue.
"Thank you, Harry…" Pansy said softly, looking at Harry with glassy eyes. She blinked the incoming tears away and went over to the fireplace to hang the portrait above the mantlepiece.
"Why?"
I want to thank everyone who has stuck with this fic so far! Some of you even took the time to message me on Twitter and I really do appreciate that a lot. You keep me going! 💖
Harry rolled his eyes.
"Fine," he reluctantly agreed, already regretting the decision and berating himself internally.
"That's brilliant!" He exclaimed feeling quite flustered all of a sudden. "Very very cool indeed!"
"I need to talk to him as soon as possible. It would only be for a short while…five minutes!"
"The thing is," Grunhild continued. "Their records have been clean since then. They've been good citizens and it seems like they moved here to start a new life. Not to mention, their immigration papers are all in order."
The next morning, Harry was woken up by someone firecalling him. He got up and quickly put on a robe before rushing downstairs to answer.
That evening, as Harry and Draco lay down next to each other, Harry also expressed something that he's been thinking of for a long time now.
