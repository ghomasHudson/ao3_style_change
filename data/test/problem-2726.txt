: just that
“I had a question about something I was planning on teaching this year; could I speak to you in private?”
We got to the top of the stairs and I immediately went to my room, glad to be rid of Harry. Apparently he didn't want to be around me either, as he turned and walked down to the guest room.
“Well, you weren’t at work for the last few days, so I thought maybe something was wrong.
I can tell
Harry gets back to their flat totally unprepared for what he’s about to do.  Unlocking the door, he hears the TV on and knows that Draco is inside, sitting on the couch, waiting for Harry to get back from his weekly pub outing with his friends.
“I don’t know.”
My eyes widened slightly.  The 'baby' just slipped out.  I could've sworn I saw Draco smile, but I didn't stick around to find out.  I slipped my arm out from under him and untangled our fingers.  I threw on my t-shirt and grabbed the rest of the clothes off the floor.  Walking out of his room, I glanced back at him.
Harry pecks Draco on the lips again and uncoils his arms from around the latter’s neck.
: FUCK
“Harry?”
We’ll be fine.”
: so all you’ve got to do is tell him
Confident, but not boasting.
: i think he is
Apparently, that was an unexpected action, as Draco’s hands slip beneath Harry’s and a chunk of very wet clay comes hurtling off of the wheel and towards both of their faces.
He turns around to find himself facing the most beautiful man he’s ever seen.
That’s how Harry gets left alone in the middle of the ocean as the love of his life apparates away.
: boys we need help
“Er- yes, I am.
Draco ponders this.
“You’ll what?”
: nvm what were u gonna say?
“And do what?”
He wakes up on Thursday morning to something tickling his nose.
: i know who it is, and i just want you guys to promise that you’ll trust me and luna and have our backs when you figure out who this person is
And shut your eyes.
: if anything, being family puts her MORE at risk of your pranking
you had me at party
If someone had told Draco at the beginning of the year that he’d be giggling like a schoolgirl next to a near-naked Harry Potter, he’d have told them exactly where to place a sharp stick.
: yeah its not really a surprise
I startle awake at the sound of the intercom.
k brb
"Whatever you say."
“One more round, and I’ll beat you for sure this time.”
Harry laughs.
Draco snorted.  "Are you saying I'm not smart?"  Then his eyes widened as he realized what he said.  I blushed and he moved on, brushing it off.
Misogynists are afraid of any change that’ll bring light to a situation.”
I’d be offended but you’re not wrong
: LMFAO
--------------------
Mum wasn't home, so it was just us in the kitchen and I didn't wanna leave my cup of hot cocoa on the counter. So I had to stay in the kitchen. And he had to stay in that area too, to take off his coat and shoes. So we stood there, awkwardly, for about two minutes.
: why would it matter?
: draco
In fact, he almost misses the thermos on the ground, except for the draft that blows the note inside.
Draco quickly went from stunned to his usual sarcastic self while I stood there, floundering for something to say.
The tears, the anger, the despair, and the hopelessness.
“I do.”
But while Harry may be stupid, he’s not a complete idiot.
: AJSHAKSHA
Why was that so startling?”
LMFAO
I figured my mum had had a long day at the Ministry so I offered to make dinner.  I did steak and mashed potatoes with green beans because its filling and relaxing on this winter day.
"Harry, I'm the only gay boy in our year who was a Slytherin."
Draco laughs that gorgeous laugh of his.  “Pardon?”
I don’t know anything about fashion, so whatever you think will go best.
But teaching potions isn’t too boring for you?”
This time, when he enters, Potter is nowhere to be found, and he can’t determine if the flutter in his abdomen is relief or disappointment.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione are standing on the dance floor, bopping in time to the music, when Ron suggests that Harry go dance with someone.
But what’s new?
Malfoy pauses.
“I don’t have a class this period,
“Luckily for you, Professor Potter, you’ve made a good example for a lesson.
I had known
“What?”
Draco seems excited to spend more time with him, which is odd, but he’s not gonna complain. “No, yeah, that’s great!
“Professors Potter and Malfoy, do we have a problem?” McGonagall’s sharp voice rings out behind them.
when r u not
: er....
don’t feel obligated to share ur name lol, stranger danger online and all that jazz
Ohhhhh this day was going to be so long.  So long, it must be so long-  I blocked that thought out.
: unfortunately that’s true
: idk man just wondering
“They what?” Harry says, sitting up with an absurd look on his face.
"Don't- don't tell me you've got some kind of... messed up relationship going on.  I don't need a step-father, much less a step-father that's younger than me."  I said very firmly.
: agreed
or the Purple Emperor.
Draco pulls away and shamelessly looks into Harry’s eyes finding a gaze matching his own wonder.
: what
is that ur a fucking QUEEN
“You… recognize me?” Draco asks warily.
“What else would I be doing?”
The mixture of alcohol, hormones, and confusion does wonders to Harry’s brain, and all of a sudden he’s a stuttering, incompetent fool.
Entertained.
: okay first of all thanks for letting us know ur alive
: yeah yeah alright i’m sorry i know they’re different colors
We can talk later.”
And a fruit… green apples, probably.
: you wanna fight weasley?
Like Harry can see into his mind, his soul, and his every emotion.
AND UR RIGHT???
“Yeah, that doesn’t seem good…” Ron admits.
"You've been flirting?  I thought you were just being... I don't know... weird?"
“Professor McGonagall!”  Harry exclaims.  She looks like she hasn’t aged a day, of course.  Seeing her makes him realize just how much he missed her.
“I’ve never been
We actually have real things to learn, unlike your students which you obviously afford to leave alone.”
: hell yeah
: what’s poppin bitches
: you didn’t send it did you
Your lunch break is shorter than mine; I’d feel bad.”
"Of course. Where are you living now? Do you have a girlfriend?" she asked teasingly.
Draco lays on his bed, numb.
The man grins, and it throws Draco so off-course that he doesn’t even hear his reply.
“Did you just hear yourself?”
It’s early November and the dungeons are getting chilly.
How bright they are?
“Good game, huh, Malfoy?”
Harry watches as Draco walks over to his bird and pulls him out of the sink, removing the letter.
: has anyone noticed that draco and harry have been awkwardly silent for the last few minutes
I what now
: you two scare me
everything you just said was terrifying
I’m a 23-year old man
WAKE ME UP
: well you go back to the store obviously
Harry sits and thinks about this for a minute (which is a first because he generally never thinks before doing things).
MY FUCKING CAT
“Get your head out of the Amortentia before you drink it, nitwit!” Draco exclaims, awkwardly dragging the pink toilet away from Harry.
“I-“ Malfoy collects himself and starts again.  “I’m here because I work here.”
: no! just go back to that store every day
Though the day may have been uneventful, the rest of the week certainly was not.
: anyway what did you do?
: whoop whoop!
Harry went to catch up with Ron, a smile on his face and a weight lifted off his shoulders.
“You wish.”
: you won’t win this harry
Hello students.
Really made her angry.”
ur pretty cool
What are you looking at?”
Why Is Harry Potter Confusing Me, And When Will He Begin to Make Sense, the fourth book in my personal biographical series.
SMUT WARNING:  This chapter is entirely smut.  No non-con or anything, just pure smut.  If you don't wanna read that you can skip straight to the next chapter, you won't have missed anything important here.
“Quidditch party!”
"Good idea," Harry agreed.  I glanced over to see that he had collapsed on the dark blue couch we'd assembled over an hour ago, when I noticed his shirt.  It was mine that I was looking for earlier.  He must've taken it on accident.
“Of course.
“What happened?” Dean asks Ron.
“I would be flattered that you think I’m smart, but your standards can’t be very high, considering…” Draco says, gesturing Harry.
"Hmmmm... Ravenclaw?"
more likely to be in a relationship with Harry than I am," she added.
He doesn’t stop to see how Draco reacts, however, because he sees a glimpse of gold and goes for it.
: DRACO HAS ABS!!?!??
Harry has to resist the urge to stop and eavesdrop on them.
blush.
It actually… it helped a lot.
feelings for the raven-haired boy sleeping on his chest.
Thankfully, Harry says, “I didn’t expect to see you back so soon.”
By now, Harry is beaming and it makes Draco’s heart swell because he’s beaming right back.
He smiles.
"Except for my room. My room is
I didn’t know at the time though.”
: but ginny and hermione did
“Brown this time?” Draco states stupidly.
: *sighs *
: NO YOU U CANT TELL HER CUZ I DIDNT TELL DRACO
: i have no fucking clue
Harry frowns.  What?
Excitedly, he pulls it out, discovering that there’s probably enough to make a suit jacket and pants from.
I mean, access to Draco’s classroom, gaining his trust, strengthening their teasing relationship… who
Draco knows he shouldn’t return to the shop the next morning, but his body defies his wishes and takes him straight back to that peeling doorstep and rickety sign.
Standing up, Harry says, “Let's get in the water!”
omg r u sirius
that you’re happy, and doesn’t actually affect the chemical imbalance.”
There are no other customers in sight, and if not for the hum of machinery Draco wouldn’t have noticed the cute, raven-haired boy sitting at one of the wheels, throwing clay.
“I’m meeting with some people from Ilvermorny about a teaching opportunity.”
I met up with Hermione, Ron and Ginny at the Three Broomsticks. We all had to catch up and apparently Ron had something very important to tell us.
Draco puts his head in his hands and concedes.
idk i have a feeling the universe is working in our favour
Malfoy deadpans.  “Of course you do.
Beside him, Malfoy rises, his long black robes falling behind him.
Draco shows up for their date on Sunday at 11 am with a late birthday present for Harry that he thinks his raven-haired idiot will absolutely love.
Draco takes a step closer to Harry, bringing them a forearm’s length apart.
What are you specifically looking for today, handsome?”
"Let me come, daddy..."
-------------------------------
My hair grew back!”
: who r u
“I’d advise you to read through the teacher’s guidelines that I’ve had owled to your apartment.”
: ... er
MY LITTLE DRAKEY WAKEY IS GETTING HIS FIRST BOYFRIEND
"I thought so. Draco is the same way and I've noticed some of the little signs. I complete support you though."
And you see my pupils?
Draco has to consciously close his jaw so he’s not gaping at the man.
: so there are 11 ppl in this chat and 5 of them are weasleys
“Defense Against the Dark Arts and occasionally Charms.
“Keep the change.”
Harry nods slightly, inhaling the slight scent of rustic cologne radiating off of the man in his arms.
"Hello Harry, do come in! I'm sorry if there's any mess, the house elves cleaned up quite nicely though," Narcissa welcomed me.
“The problem isn’t me, its you!  You just do what and who you want and you don’t think about me!”  When did this become about Harry?
: ...k maybe a little
: i was being polite
"You... remember last night?"
: i just didn’t wanna do food myself lol
"Draco-"
I shoved him on to the bed and ripped off my shirt while he did the same.  Then I layed on top of him and starting kissing him roughly again.  I could feel my bulge rubbing up against his, and he started grinding his hips to create friction.  It only turned me on more.  Fuck.
“Orright.”
Draco gasped.  "Then he's a Slytherin?  How did you fall for one of them?"
Harry and Draco have this silent agreement not to prank each other anymore, but he just can’t pass up this chance.
hypothetically
Draco snorts, choking on his own saliva and landing himself in a coughing fit.
“I’d love to!” Draco says, sounding a little too excited.
"Alrigh-" the moment he stepped through my doorway I shouted.
Works most of the time, as long as my life stays pretty routine.”
: don’t beg him in the group harry, keep your kinks to the bedroom
I immediately look away.
“Why is she- oh.”
: ajdhakdhsk
: AHAHAHAHA
But you two are on thin ice.
He has this oddly suspicious feeling in his gut, but he doesn’t think too much of it because the idea of being able to embarrass Potter twice in a row is much too enticing.
Harry sees his four mates’ eyes widen and they glance between one another, biting their lips.
That keeps it all together
This bad feeling of his doesn’t ease up at dinner, or after he’s gotten in the shower in his Professor Apartment.
blaise can do it this time
“Yes, contrary to popular belief, the world doesn’t entirely revolve around your arse, Potter.”
“Anyway, what was your idea?”
: should i be worried
Harry doesn’t even realize what’s happened until he notices Draco has gone incredibly still beside him.
"Bet you did," muttered Draco, lazily walking in to the room.
“This isn’t a proposal, because I think we still have a long way to go until then.
He cried a little bit, though he’d never admit it, and he prided himself on the emerald-colored studs that he wore for three months afterward.
What do I do
: I love this
“Wait.
: i have the best ideas
“What?”
: that seems like bs but fine
“Er- what?” Ron asks.
: you didn’t need to tell them abt it
Just two grown men eating dinner.
“…what do you mean?”
Draco takes a step closer, the fall breeze blowing leaves around them.
: THEIR SHIP NAME IS DRARRY
: im touched
: out?
For a while, he thought maybe it was because Draco was getting dates and Harry was single.  But Harry also dated people and the feeling was still there, so he ruled that off the list. Now he has a worse suspicious which sets his gut churning.
: uh guys? hello?
: the color compliments your eyelashes nicely!
Malfoy is being so kind and respectful… it’s unlike the Malfoy that Harry used to know.
They still shake, but not quite as much anymore.
Were you- are you my soup-bringer?”
"Good afternoon dear, what may I help you with?" As it wasn't really back-to-school season, Madam Malkin spent most of her time in this store instead of across the street.  She was an old family friend and didn't really care about my past.
What is this pulling feeling in his heart?
Watch it!”
or to doubt the extent of American idiocy
what did we miss
in the hallway for the party rooms.”
There was a man who saw me carrying that book by Michele Obama that I’ve wanted for a while now
He’s never had a friendship quite like this before.
: luna you’re absolutely stunning!! that dress is so you
“As long as it’s not mushroom soup, I’m happy.”
“Well, it is.”
I do neither.
Draco just gapes at the space above his forehead.
And I’m still confused about how you ended up working in a muggle shoppe-”
As the clay begins to form, he feels Draco smile.
“Wonderful!  I’ll let Mr. Longbottom know that you’re ready to see your apartments.”  McGonagall waves her wand gracefully and the foggy white form of three cats – a kitten, an adolescent, and an adult – appear in the air, prancing around Harry for a moment before floating off.
: about it being equal to spaghetti
i think ron is right, if u like him then you should explore that possibility
The tears escaping his eyes blur his vision, but he’s pretty sure Draco is laughing too.
super focused on me
“Oh.”
: whichever u prefer
“That’s okay!
"Goodbye dear!"
: LMFAO
A young Gryffindor seeker has just caught the snitch in a match against Slytherin.
"Yeah, we're dating. In all honesty, we've kinda been on-and-off dating since the battle of Hogwarts... we just didn't know how anyone would react. We weren't quite sure how we were reacting ourselves!" Hermione said.
About two hours into my studying, I heard a knock at my door, forgetting that it could be Potter (I refused to call him Harry), and called out "Come in!"
"You could've gotten us killed!  We almost were!  Don't you think before you apparate?"  I fussed, trying to keep my voice down as people were looking at us funny.
“See,” he whispers.
you act as if we would have any reason to not like u
“You drink black coffee?
“No, no.
: pffft idr y
So, while I might be disappointed by the fact that Harry left without saying goodbye, the feeling is overwhelmed by my excitement at the thought of having his number.
“Argh!” Harry rams headfirst into someone, tripping and almost falling over, except for the fact that the person caught him.
------------------------------------------
“Good.
Try again.”
They sit in silence for a moment before Harry checks his watch.
: have fun dreaming about him love
Harry didn’t want anything special for his 23rd birthday, only to be with his two best mates in the whole world.
: SOMEONE TELL ME WHATS HAPPENING
“Please, I don’t want to argue.
The boys have gotten to know each other very well, and every day they fall deeper and deeper in love.
“I… okay?
: you’ve always been attracted to him, this isn’t new
“Well, yeah.
First he sneezed, and I automatically said bless you - I was raised with manners, you know - and we just stared at each other, surprised. He looked away first.
: that’s valid
He doesn’t realize how much time has passed until he hears the front door unlock.
: it’s epic how you text at the same time
: uh ron you didn’t have to imagine it
: do it babe
: Park in the Town Square, Sat 7 PM, eat dinner before you come, fancy dress code
“I don’t know what to do…”
“What?”
Which, in itself, is suspicious.
“About the same myself.
Harry begins to worry, since Draco hasn’t been turning around for long enough periods of time for Harry to set the action on the spell, and the potion is almost complete.
But there's no way he felt the same way.  I mean, Draco was totally wasted.  Alcohol makes you horny, he was so drunk he probably just... acted on impulse.  Forgot it was me.  He was using me.  Yea, that's it...
: which pizza thing
"Eh, I'll just find some hangover potions later."
: That’s my cue to leave now as well… *concern*
Draco pretends not to have heard, but he can’t deny the feeling of warmth that blossoms in his chest at hearing Harry admit that out loud. So, two men walk in comfortable silence, side-by-side, towards the Professor Apartments.
oi get a room
He doesn’t know where the sudden playfulness has come from, but he knows that it definitely shouldn’t be for Potter.
: yeah well i’m gonna b polite again
They eat in relatively comfortable silence, enjoying the sounds of children laughing and silverware clinking all around them.
: mood
“Sorry, you’re eating.
How are you liking the professor's new hairstyle?”
And Potter doesn't seem to have noticed him yet.
: i bet they’re having sex
You’re both bloody idiots, but especially you,” Ron grumbles.
Harry beams, taking Draco’s other hand in his.
Once Harry turns to face him, he says, “Thank you.
I walked into my apartment with a bounce in my step, tossing my keys into a bowl. I was greeted by my Shi Tzu, Mocha. Reaching down to pet him, I noticed an owl on the windowsill. I didn't recognize the owl so I grabbed some treats off the bowl on the counter and headed over.
: POTTER
"I love your house. So homey and nice," I complemented.
“Uh-huh.”
"No. I over-studdied, but I'd rather be prepared andnot need it that unprepared and suddenly not know something. You know?"
“He’s only hooking up to try to forget you and get over you ‘cuz he thinks you don’t like him.  That’s why they’re only one-night stands, because he’s too in love with you to actually date anyone else.”
: if anyone gives me shit the girls got my back
: okay n O
Potter seems to relax a bit.
: and your eyes. it compliments your eyes
Maybe it’s because he might’ve just gotten asked out by Harry Potter.
to do!”
Because now, there’s a permanent image of striking green eyes staring curiously at me. I can’t even fathom what would cause Potter to look at me the way he is right now: indescribably confused. I feel him boring a hole in the back of my head, as if laser beams are the result of his staring.
"I'd like to get some Ministry Robes and a few suits for when I do Auror work."
I yawn, and the seatbelt sign turns off, so I unbuckle and adjust to rest my head on Harry’s.
: since when have you and luna been friends?
: okay
just look at me
I’m just trying to make conversation.”
We had previously cleansed and removed all the furniture and moved it into a trunk with an Extension Charm on it so that we could see what could be kept and what would need to go.  Downstairs we sat in the living room, sorting it all into other trunks with similar charms that were for furniture that would be kept and gotten rid of.
Like falling in love.
: please don’t say it
“Who would want to be associated with you?
: bloody bell, where even are you in that snap?
how does it not just like
He thinks quickly and mumbles a hex that sends Draco’s water bottle flying off the desk and across the room.
The soup makes him feel a lot better, though, and he decides that if someone missed him, he’d better get back to work to figure out who.
How about… you read to me?”
: agreed
“…What?”
Did I-” he sighs.
When Harry turns around into the arms of a man slightly shorter than him with striking blonde hair and starts to grind against him, he thinks nothing of it.
we’re gonna need a bit more context love
what do u think dragon
of course it broke.”
: i hate it here
He’s about to respond, but Draco’s coworker comes out and fixes the machine, and then it’s time to pay.
: orright if ur here then ur invited to my 5 year reunion party
“When I say throw the clay, I mean onto the wheel, not your face!” He chokes out between laughs, clutching his stomach.
Now either you’ve got to prank me back, or you’ve got to declare an end to this so I can stop checking my pillows for curses every night.”
"Enemies with benefits," he said.
: IF ANYONE FINDS OUT IM FUCKED
“Harry-”
: great!
“Are you going to keep following me to this club, Potter, or will you finally grow out of your obsession with me?” Draco says into Harry’s ear, continuing to dance with him.
"Congrats mate! Who's the lucky girl?" I said.
"Take off my pants.  Now."  I commanded.
“Yeah, I’ve had more strange near-death experiences than I’d like.”
also ur sounding a bit creepy?
“Cutie,” Draco mumbles, shaking his head.
Draco had forgotten that Hufflepuff dorms were next to the kitchens…
He really should be more nervous about this job, since he isn’t trained in teaching, he’s trained in fighting.  However, he knows just about every defensive spell on earth – the good ones and the bad ones – and Auror training taught him more about using and handling them.
I’d imagine that’s what sewage tastes like.
Harry turns to Draco, stopping in front of the door to his apartment, locking eyes with the slightly shorter man.
Now the rest of the charms that Harry casts will only go into effect once the final step is completed in the potion.
“Ever heard of nair, Potter?”
Before you go go
so i’ve liked a guy for like a long time now and i thought he hated me and then i thought he liked me and now i’m not sure?
“Okay... sure, then we can talk.”
A half an hour later, they’re sitting on Draco's couch, eating spaghetti that Harry cooked.
“But how did it grow back so fast?
All of a sudden Draco feels a pair of lips on his cheek, and then Harry pulls away, blushing at the ground.
It seems that teaching has finally given Potter a purpose other than annoying Draco.
I’ve been helping my mother plan events since I could open my eyes.”
"Well, I had another idea.  Before you say no, just hear me out," she began.  "Draco has marvelous taste, as I raised him to, and you probably want to get moved in as soon as possible to avoid Draco more.  So I was wondering-"
He melts for the umpteenth time that day at the sight of Harry’s smile and knows he’s truly in deep.
He pretends not to notice Harry’s blush or the way his hands are like warm stones in his own slender, cold fingers.
Professors?
Draco glances at Harry to find a look of mock offense on his face. “You don’t like mushroom soup?”
“You need to talk to Harry.”
okay then he died
“I dunno. One minute they were in the ocean together, then I looked up and Draco was gone and Harry was… well, like this.”
“Remind me why we’re planning this the night before it’s supposed to happen?” Draco sighs, leaning back and looking up at the ceiling.
: thank u actually, this was very helpful
one of these things is not like the others
-----------------------------
im beginning to like it here
Why does he do this to me?
“Harry bloody Potter, what did you
harry, he was indoctrinated as soon as you volunteered to elope with him
barack obama?
He’s a coward, always has been, and always will be.
“Yeah, I use a modified Cheering Charm daily.
: BC IDK WUT TO DO NOW
"Where are you going, idiot?"
"Let's get out of here," he whispered huskily into my ear.  I nodded, throwing some cash on the bar before pulling him to the men's bathroom so we could apparate away.
The red-headed girl looked a little defensive at my question.
: AHAHAHA
thank you
funny,” Draco mumbles.
Little does Draco know, Harry does wish.
gtg, lunch break ended ages ago
Please remind students that he is not giving out autographs,” she says, with a quick warning glance at Harry.
They sit in silence for a few minutes.
“I didn’t know what you’d want so I got a bit of everything,” Draco says bashfully. It’s a strange emotion on him.
Harry tries not to think about the students picking it up behind him and squealing.
“You’re interrupting my class, Potter.
If this is what it could be like every day, he’d be pretty damn satisfied.
Harry rests his chin on Draco’s shoulder in order to see what he’s doing, not that he needs to.
: glad u think i’m joking
Quite close,” he responds cooly.
: IS NOT
: a bloody comfy bed too
"No, I just meant- never mind."  After an awkward pause, I noticed something.
My lips left his and trailed across his perfectly chiseled jaw and down his neck, alternating between kissing and biting and sucking his neck.  There were hickeys everywhere, of every size.  i could feel him shivering underneath me and his heavy breathing set me on fire.  Or maybe that was the Fireball from earlier.  Who knows.
Harry looks at his feet, rubbing the back of his neck and mumbling incoherent words under his breath.
Who’s in his bed?
: uhhhh guys it’s all coming back to me
: oh boy
I rolled my eyes.  "Of course you didn't.  You just wanted one night of good sex and then to blow me off.  I get it.  I've done that before.  Just didn't think you'd do it to me after the day we had, but whatever."
: dragon ignore this, you won’t know who he is anyway
Ever heard of medication?”
: ...? er yes i did
: i love you guys 😂
“So I can dress you up?”
Does any part of this eleven-at-night meeting convey to you the idea that this is up for debate?”
: you WILL be polite to draco and pansy, understood?
"Thank you, I may do that later, but I'd agreed to hang out with Ginny, Ron and Hermione this morning. I'm going to go get ready!"
he wanted to marry me but I said no because I have Ron
Draco takes a moment to look at him.
we're binging it
Despite what he tells himself, he really can’t stop thinking about that encounter.
Anyway, it seems interesting so far.”
: no ofc not!
: now show me what you’re wearing
: agh
“What in the name of Merlin are you doing here?”
how about instead of eloping w ‘mione you elope with me
“Hey!”
: really?
He doesn’t say anything after that, and Draco becomes acutely aware of how close they’re actually standing, feeling the dark-haired boy's breath tickle his cheeks.
: yes...
A curse?
Harry blushes and Draco winks, diving downwards at what Harry assumes is the snitch.
: first of all, when did potter become harry
: oh then definitely ballroom fancy x1000
As we walked through the store, I questioned him on what time of vibe he was going for in the place.  He said he wanted a modern but warm, woody feeling, so we settled on off-white and dark oak color scheme with blue accents.  As we walked through, I could tell he was trying to be civil, so I at least did the same.  Plus, he didn't look quite so annoying when he was smiling, which we both ending up doing a lot of that day.
and Harry actually laughs when he reads it.
It’s relaxing, and he lets the smell of fire and warmth and treacle tart fill his mind.
: SHIT I MEANT STFU
All he can think of is how he just ruined the best thing in his life.
: wait you were the unknown number?
The dark-haired man grins, moving to the sink to wash his hands.
That’s all Ron says, but Draco’s head shoots up.
"Oh, it is?  how did I get it?"  Harry looked confused.
Harry comes in, buying yarn, or sometimes just stopping by with coffee, or lunch.
“Well, why don’t you donate your crocheted hats and scarves to the homeless?
“What the- sour patch kids?”
“See you after this set, Potter,” Draco calls.
: and also uh
“Well then you’re not homophobic,” Dean says, grinning.
I hate it here
But other than basic things you learn about your enemy over the years, he doesn’t really
Pris!
: MIONE
I think back to our Hogwarts days together.
: LMAO it’s just drunk sex
Draco wakes up warm and comfortable, more so than usual. He angles his body to the left a bit, letting the human-shaped weight fall into him.
He shouldn’t have listened to his therapist.
Sure, they danced at the club a few nights ago, but they were both absolutely plastered.
You know, we have a quidditch match later that we’re sure to win.”
Harry doesn’t respond, only gazes ahead with empty eyes.
Harry gives him a look, and Draco actually gives a small smile in return.
Rolling eyes is attractive on everyone, obviously.
Draco Malfoy is rather surprised.
: and this is my cue to leave
“Nope.”
THATS SO FUNNY
“Hey, Neville!”
“It was too!
But he’s nowhere to be found.
And why did it smell so bloody familiar?
It’s a fine line, really.
: hey does someone wanna remind me why this is our gc name
before u go go
: WOO WOO
: i love it here already
“Er- yeah, Ron had something to… to do…” Harry gets lost in Draco’s eyes for a moment too long, but doesn’t look away this time.
: idk but i think they need a ship name
Harry shakes all thoughts of Draco Malfoy out of his mind and focuses on sketching his next commission.
Now get out of my office before I change my mind.”
: yeah ron’s been eating all day, why aren’t u hungry
But he can’t stop thinking about how much Malfoy has changed, and how… refreshing it is.
: no comment
: tHE CLUB???
: ...
lmaoooooo
“I suppose so, yeah.
: like a lot...
He pulls his shirt off over his head, staying in his swim trunks, and rushes into the ocean, letting the water lap against his body.
“-so I thought I’d just ask her.
He’s not a very good listener, constantly interrupting me with questions and comments. I just rolled my eyes and moved on, which I suppose he took as encouragement to continue to annoy me.
: so i’m just gonna go find some coffee i guess
“Why?
There’s something in everyone’s eyes that matches what Harry himself is feeling: excitement at the year to come.
“I told him that I haven’t been pretending to like him for the last four months.
“Not even if it’s because I’m running my fingers through it while we kiss?” Harry says boldly.
“Hello!
“…well? Want to play one?”
“Wonderful, thanks. It’d be even better if your presence had been a dream.”
“Then why did he just leave me alone in the middle of the ocean?” Harry says forlornly.
"If he's a Slytherin then he does hate you.  For sure."
“Harry, how on Earth did you manage to get us onto Hogwarts Grounds in the middle of the summer, unsupervised?” Hermione asks.
: uhhh what r u talking abt
in Harrow.
He tilts his head to the left slightly, resting his lips delicately on Draco’s cheek.
: (...)
“I mean… that- that’d be nice.
cuz we’ll choke on the celery
Draco looks like he’s about to object but thinks better of it and nods.
: QUIT BETTING ON MY LOVE LIFE
Oh well.
“Harry.
But I don’t have time to entertain you, as we’re in the middle of class,” Draco snarks.
Harry grins sleepily at that, and I impulsively kiss his forehead.
"Really, you're going to let me - Filthy Potter - touch you?  Wow, never thought I'd see the day."
…unless…
“What was it?” Draco curses himself.
Most of the time it’s manageable, with a modified Cheering Charm once a day, but sometimes it gets so out of hand he can’t even get out of bed.
“Of course not, Minerva.
He looks around but the raven-haired boy is nowhere to be found, so his heart is racing for nothing.
“How the bloody hell did you get into my apartment?”
“You’re wrong. I’m going to break up with you just because you like it,” Draco teases.
"Yes, please don't go into our bedrooms. But you're welcome to go everywhere other than that!"
I took the soup and one potion up to Draco's room after throwing my clothes on my bed.  I gently pushed the door open.  Thank god he was still asleep.
So he stopped me and said, “How many feminists does it take to change a lightbulb?”
I rolled my eyes.  "Are you gonna keep guessing?  I'll give you a hint: he's not a hufflepuff."
"What the hell?  How come you keep almost dying?"  he fussed, his arms still around my waist.
: but you love me
“What does Professor Malfoy have you learning about today, students?”
: that was intentional :)
“Okay, fine… I’ll get up I guess…” Harry says, beginning to move from his position.
I really like Draco, I have for more years than I can count.”
He pauses in front of Harry, and for a moment, there’s silence.
I glanced at the muggle alarm clock by my bed.  Midnight.  Great.  Better get some studying in.
: lmao imagine
So he leaves them be and catches up with Neville, heading to their dorms.
“At least you’re self-aware.
But Harry isn’t most people, and he’s known Draco for long enough to know that he’s raging.
: uhm what
They race towards the grass together, side-by-side, just like the old days.
: you’re family now!
: are we all here?
: again, been pining for too long
They keep dancing until the song ends, and Draco whispers,
Everyone is silent for a moment.
He kissed me back and it was magical.  I wanted the kiss to go on forever.  But it ended when the doorbell rang.  We sprang apart, startled by the noise and walked to the door, opening it to find my mother standing there.
ANYWAY
and then i waved my hand up and down to get his attention and he zoned back in and turned really red and fled the store
: she’s right
After a few minutes of tense silence, Draco speaks softly, “We truly are sorry, Professor.
: heyyy girl, you look stunning as always
: i hate you all
OMGGGG
And better yet, how on Earth has he not recognized Draco yet?
“No, but you’ve probably got customers waiting outside, or… something,” Harry finishes weakly.
Harry grunts in annoyance.
He assumes that’s the end of their little accident.
—— 13.5 hours ——
: *devil grin emoji*
"I'm really sorry to interrupt your day, but... well... I just wanted to thank you.  For- for saving my life that day in the forest.  You could've revealed that I was still alive, especially since you knew Malf- Draco was alive.  But you didn't.  You risked it all out of honor and who knows why else, but I owe my life to you and am so deeply grateful for you.  So, thank you."  Harry stood there for a moment, wondering where those words had come from, when he realized that she wouldn't respond.  So he nodded his head once and turned to walk away when she grabbed his wrist.
like that shit?”
Draco opens one eye warily to find that Harry Potter is wrapped around him like a rather adorable octopus.
I fell asleep reading, but woke up at about 21:00 feeling extremely thirsty.
Nine… ten… eleven…
What do you teach?” I ask, trying to seem disinterested as I lay down more cards.
: i want it to be a proper unproper reunion party
The blue speckles in it suggest that it’s grown moldy, and he doesn’t manicure his hands every week just to ruin it with moldy clay.
: of course it is
“That’s a first.”
: or were you typical draco and glared daggers at him until he looked away
“What do you want, Potter?”
He realizes that he’s at least half a head taller than Draco.
Harry jerks away in time, but Draco gets a full face of clay and water.
: whatcha doin in there mate ;)
“What were you doing, following me to the baths?”
-----------------------------------------
Harry glances over to see Draco blush shamefully.  “Shit.  Sorry.  I forgot the charms, I was just a little caught up in the-“
And I know I was terrible by rejecting you, but if you’ll have me, I’d like to try again.”
“I don’t believe it.
I was informing these two about the fact that honey is categorized as a raw meat by the American FDA
Genuinely?
"Mmm... fuckkkk..." he breathed out.
homophobia
: mine as well, all though you don’t have my undivided attention because i’m reading rn
Like unless you’re gonna tell us you’re hitler or something then your probably fine
Draco has laid out a miniature feast on the kitchen counter, with muffins, chocolate croissants, buttered toast, and cheese danishes. Is he trying to impress Harry?
: THERE IS NO DRARRY
“Good nap, Malfoy?” Harry asks, sounded simultaneously intrigued and peckish.
: quit worrying, it isn’t a good look on you
It's a two-year deal, minus summer break, and I'm in the third to last month. It's been quite educational, and I've already been reviewing my reviews (pun-intended) to prepare for my final exam in three months.
He's suddenly hyper-aware of the leather chair he’s sitting in, the cold floor beneath his bare feet, and the sound of Draco walking closer.
“Well, my parents were very prominent members of their corner of society, so I was raised with an appreciation of looking your best.
alright well I have an 8 am shift so im gonna dip now
I realized my palms were sweaty and my legs were shaking. I couldn't believe how weird Potter made me feel. Not just physically too, like mentally he just makes me freeze. That's how annoying he is.
aw will that be our first date /j
Harry thinks about it.
IS SKITTLES A RAG DOLL
think we have romantic tension.
: *visible concern*
Ron teasingly glared at his girlfriend for announcing it before he could, but she apologized and they kissed.
“That's the thing though.
: of course!
Harry beams.  “Thank you so much, Professor.  I would never have considered teaching if you hadn’t reached out.  Hogwarts is my home, it really is, and I’m so glad to be back.”
"It's wonderful to see you, too, Harry. Where are you off to?" She asked politely.
: at least you’re married to the one with some sense of self-preservation
yes he is
He watches Draco’s expression fly from confused to suspicious to wary and back to confused again, ending with slightly pink cheeks as he thanks Harry and hurries down the hall.
“I- I know for the last few months we’ve been fake-dating, but every second I spend with you is amazing.
Harry cracked open the door and looked at me, staying in the hallway. I wanted to make him feel foolish after that awkward encounter on the stairs, so I said "Don't just stand in the hallway. I said 'come in' for a reason, you know."
Once more, they lock eyes, and Draco takes slow steps forwards.
“So he finally asked you out, huh?” Pris says from behind him, making him jump.
: or something
: WHAHAHAHAH
Only me.
: 0.0
"Nah.  If I dated someone as reckless as me it would be a disaster."
His heart pounds inside his chest, but he can’t feel it.
: beautiful!!!
WAKE ME UP INSIDE
*Draco and pansy breathe together for a few more cycles and he finally calms down*
He tries to stumble back but Draco catches his arms.
: oh shit
I pulled his briefs down a little harder than I meant but he groaned too.  Then i made him lay down again and i pressed my body on top of his, us making out.  My hand crept down to his cock and i wrapped my whole hand around it before squeezing light and hard.  I summoned some lube and doused my hand and his in it before we both pumped up and down on each others dicks.
Just eat so we can leave.”
“No, don’t make Professor Potter leave,” Carolyn, the Gryffindor girl, pipes up.
Get ready for the day.
"Holy fuck I like it when you talk to me like that," he moaned, flipping around.
Harry looks down and discovers that he’s right.
But of course, it’s not.
He realizes that he really didn’t know what to expect because when Harry comes down the hall and stops, staring at him anxiously, his heart skips a beat.
Is there something… smutty in there?”
“Pah.
yes I’d def marry u dragon /p
“You know, I was really set on this turquoise, but midnight blue suits you very well too…” Draco says for the umpteenth time that morning.
“The doctor made me memorize it like a mantra.
tbh sherlock is a fantastic show, so I don’t even blame him
It’s been four months since Harry and Draco began fake dating to appease their friends, and both are in unbearable misery.
As he makes a cup of coffee with his new mugs, he ponders this.
“It’d be okay.
the encounter isn’t likely to become a regular thing
: done
McGonagall sits behind the desk and gestures for him to take a seat.  As he sinks deep into the cushion of the chair he’s reminded of all the times he did so in his youth.
: let’s get this partay started!!!
and his attraction is probably purely physical, because he seems to not have any interest in me at all other than thinking i’m hot
He rolls his eyes again, this time adding a short chuckle. My knees are weak and I’m sitting down. Merlin.
Draco stopped complaining as soon as Harry told him he sounded like Hermione.
: WHO TF IS HERE WITH ME
He was just flirted with???
“Hello, Professor Malfoy.
Hope it gets better.”
Draco spends the rest of his day teaching classes and trying to come up with something to do.
Three months of this goes by.
“Of course he does.
: here’s an idea
Tomorrow evening?
deep breaths love
“You’re still thick,” he retorts.
One, because he just used that word in his internal monologue -
I look across the aisle to find that he had indeed dealt us both our hands.
Draco’s heart sinks a bit.
: HELL NO
“Meh,” Harry responds pathetically.
: why’d u do that
I’m starved, didn’t eat today.”
Harry frowns.
Harry blushes. I mean Potter. Potter blushes.
Harry grins lopsidedly, ignoring the feeling in his stomach when Draco blushes slightly.
: yeah fair
“No, I just need her to come fix it for fun.
“I could ask you the same thing, Malfoy.”  Harry responds.
Maybe he’s wrong… maybe Draco doesn’t return his feelings.  But he doesn’t let that stop him, because there’s no way he’s going another day without Draco knowing how he really feels.
It feels so right, so natural.
“Wait.
“Well, she didn’t tell me you’d be here either.
Harry rolls his eyes, but for some reason it doesn’t seem quite as annoyed as he would’ve expected.
The dark-haired man says in a smooth, deep voice; if black coffee with stirred-in honey had a sound, it would be this man’s voice.
: wehadsexlikealotandsaidsomethingstoeachotherwhilewewerehavingpostsexcuddles
Draco scoffs.
harry please
Here,” I say, flipping back to page one and handing it to him.
He leans in and puts his hand around the back of Draco’s neck, kissing his lips so passionately that he thinks he might never feel this way again. Draco kisses him back, surprisingly, and it takes Ginny smacking them upside the head playfully for them to separate.
IM SO PROUD OF YOU LOVE
: why don’t you stand up and walk around
: alright, in four breaths... ... ... ... and hold seven breaths... ... ... ... ... ... ... and out right breaths... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... good, now let’s do it again, together...
: I have to agree with lightning mcqueen, it’s not a raw meat
: gin! luna!
I think its funny
It takes many minutes, but Harry stops crying.
“What did you do, Malfoy?” Harry whisper-shouts when he takes a seat at the staff table.
: did you?
All too soon, the plane lands, and we have to deboard.
Everything about this man is so sure.
Harry is late, which he should’ve expected.
Fourteen hours. Fourteen entire bloody hours inside this god-forsaken hunk of metal hurtling through the sky at thousands of kilos per hour. And I’m stuck across the aisle from Harry bloody Potter.
: i hate it here
He storms into the Great Hall for breakfast, much like Harry had several days ago.
: AGAIN WITH THE SEX
: that’s not helpful
: especially potter
: no please the screen is bright enough already, don’t make me open maps
: fuck yeah
: when????
: i was just gonna ask if u know how to play chess
anyway that’s funky, i don’t even know how to interpret that
It’s steadying your hands, I can tell.”
Harry beams, and Draco thinks he might faint.
"Wow, I'm going home with
“Potter.
Harry processes that for a minute and then a look of shock explodes on Harry’s face.
: he still doesn’t know ur dragon in his gc right?
Murmurs flutter through the crowd.
: i’m leaving b4 this goes any further
Harry chuckles, messing up the measurements that Draco wasn’t really taking.
*fist bumps blaise*
“Potter?  What are you doing here?” Malfoy asks, too surprised to be rude.
Harry and Draco hastily get up, making their way to the door.
: that would be wonderful!
“Once, when I was little, Mother told me to get dressed for a dinner party we were hosting.
Draco whips around, his smile disappearing.
Playing chess with Ron over winter holidays, sneaking into the library with the invisibility cloak, seeing the Mirror of Erised.
“Now, Potter, if you could kindly turn my cauldron back from its hideous state as a pink toilet, I’d appreciate that,” Draco jokes, lightening the mood.
What Happened On My 14-Hour Flight With Harry Potter, and Why I’m Grateful For It, the fifth and final biography in my series.
“I’m… I wanted to…” Words fail him, but he sees Ron nod encouragingly and leave, giving him strength.
"Well then who is it?  I promise I won't tell.  I doubt I'll even remember in the morning," he hiccuped.
“What’s the difference?”
Draco mocks offense.
As long as you help me, handsome boy.”
: c’mon it kinda is
“Yeah, alright… well, I’ll see you tomorrow!” Draco makes to stand up and head back into his craft shoppe as well, but he feels a hand around his wrist and stops, turning around.
Harry thinks for a moment and tries to imagine Draco walking through the front door with a woman on his arm, but the second he imagines them kiss he squeezes his eyes shut and shakes his head.  “Yeah, I would.”
“Alright.
uh, the other 10% that’s not water?
“What?!”
He hadn’t even realized he’d been leaning down towards it, he’d been so enchanted.
On top of that, it seems that Potter has stopped stalking him.
"Harry! Over here!" I heard Ron call. Once I sat down with them, Ron got right to the point.
“What do you want, Potter?” Draco says, still facing the chalkboard.
Cackling, he runs faster and turns the corner, running down the hallway in front of the kitchens.
where’s the slash j
“Oh it was fantastic, you know, aside from the moaning in the room next to mine.”
"Have you ever even been here?"  He continued.
no we def would
It’s not until lunchtime that he thinks about the candy again.
Daddy always told me I got them from my mother.
It took being told that it’s obviously in the sixth-year potions textbook for him to realize how stupid he was being.
"I love you, too, mom."
Harry raises an eyebrow and looks above him, catching a glimpse of dark hair.
Hence, the last four days.
Draco memorizes the obvious back muscles on the man, visible through his skin-tight tank.
: say smt plz ajdhakdh
I give points to those who deserve it, Malfoy.”
“Yes, very good game.
“After we drop these off, let’s grab dinner.
I looked at him incredulously.  "Okay, whatever.  The point is, I like you too and you're cute and..." I trailed off.  I've never been very good with feelings.  So instead I walked closer to Harry, closing the gap between us.  His chest was on mine and I felt him heart race.  I put my hand under the side of his jaw and chin and pulled him into me, kissing him hard.
I almost broke this!”
The charcoal-colored wooden sign hanging above the doorway from a wrought-iron pole reads
okay ;)
I got to Grimmauld Place and carefully opened the door, relieved when no burning gasses erupted in my face.  So I took a deep breath and walked in, carefully walking around the place.  The floors were a light wood color now that the potion had broken it down, and they were ready to be stained.  The wallpaper had come off and so you could just see the bare walls, which would need painting but it could be done.
But not too sorry- he knows he’s going to get worse in just a minute.
One day, they’re chatting at lunch like they’re old pals, and the next, they’re hexing each other under their breath.
I know a great place a few blocks up,” Draco says, trying not to sound to hopeful.
SO I WAS AT THE BOOKSHOPPE
Draco scoffs, bringing the attention back to him.
The warm water runs over Harry’s hands and into the kitchen sinks he zones out.  He wonders when Draco will be back from his date and immediately frowns.  His date.  Harry hopes he won’t bring the date back to their flat again.
“Harry.
: AHSKSH I FORGOT ABT THIS BLOODY HELL
: ?!?
… Malfoy!”
But the piece he finds himself drawn to is neither.
: hell yeah
Harry smirks.
"I know this might seem strange, but I really have been trying to change.  I know I was never good during the war or before then, but I always felt a terrible pang of guilt and sadness watching everything that my family did in serving the Dark Lord.  So, if you ever need anything, please don't hesitate to ask.  I have connections to places if you ever need help.  Think about it, okay?
More than usual, of course.
“You know, I could tell her what you did,” Harry mutters in his general direction, shoveling chicken into his mouth.
“Well, I kinda thought it was your turn since your last prank failed.”
"Oh pull yourselves together!  Your adults now, not first-years.  Be nice and use each other's first names," Mum said.
That’s why he isn’t suspecting a thing when he steps under the hot water in the shower that evening.
: hmph
if the celery is 90% water, does that make the ocean 10% celery?
: pans did you bet on my love life
Who decided that it would be a good idea to put color-changing wallpaper in a place where ninety-nine percent of the people are plastered?
I Wish I Had and Hadn’t Agreed to Play Hearts with Harry Potter, the sequel biographical work.
"Door!  Close it!" I shouted after him.
It takes him a moment to realize that he’s supposed to respond.
“I mean, it’s your turn to prank me.
“I don’t know!”  Harry says exasperatedly.  He huffs and takes his eggs back to his bedroom, leaving a very confused and disappointed Draco at the kitchen counter drinking cold coffee.
"I should go."
is all it says, but Draco would know Potter’s chicken-scratch handwriting from anywhere.
“I- yeah!
Which was true, of course, but Draco was also looking forward to seeing Harry’s muscles.
I want this bloody potion over with as quickly as possible.”
“Wait!
I love it,” he says sincerely.
He’d been dreaming of Harry admitting he had feelings for him, but when it happened he froze up.
“I’ve won the last three games, Potter. You’re not going to start winning now,” I smirk, feeling incredibly proud of myself. Mother would tell me to be humble. Father would tell me to use it to my advantage.
“Potter… how did I not know about your borderline abusive childhood?” Draco asks, more curious than anything.
"Sirius would've been glad that you're redoing the place."
And then he’s alone on the dance floor.
: what
: (...)
: it’s true, he was a hat stall, remember?
Anyone who tells you that saying things out loud makes it easier to accept is full of thestral poop.
I’ll get you!”
Harry shuts off the faucet and hurries back to his bedroom in time to close his door as his roommate opens the front door.  An emotion that he can’t quite pinpoint surges through his body and his heart falls into the pit of his stomach.  Why does this happen?
the party hasn’t even started yet
Ilvermorny is doing a summer advancement program and was wondering if I’d like to teach there.”
: go for it mate
Leaning into the touch, Harry’s smile melts Draco’s heart totally and absolutely, and he closes the gap.
Ten points to Gryffindor.”
“I bloody despise you,” Draco quips.
“Well, maybe I don’t wanna date someone that doesn’t like it!”
what r u gonna do?
“A few fourth years think that you and I have ‘romantic tension.’”
Tonight at the feast I’ll announce your position to the students.  I’m sure they’ll respond quite positively to have you teaching them.”
It’s a nice arse.”
“What are you doing here?”
“Let me- let me get you a- oh god, Draco-” Harry says, standing up to get Draco a sponge to wipe off his face.
“I know just the place.”
“World domination?
“Harry, can you tell us what’s wrong?” Ginny says gently.
Merlin, that’s the best part,” Harry chokes out, tears sliding down his cheeks.
: THIS IS WHY I LOVE YOU
: also havent you donated like loads of money to the weasley twins joke shop
When he’s awake, he admires Harry, letting his feelings sort themselves out. When he’s asleep, he dreams flashbacks to times when Harry was particularly... attractive.
Somehow, I manage to fall asleep.
"So, how is your Professor training going?" Narcissa asked.
He’s finally gotten me to laugh, and he looks just as surprised as I feel.
"Guess."
Ignoring for two and a half minutes doesn’t seem to make it go away, so he drags himself out of bed and trudges to the door.
There’s a pause, and I think I’ve won, but then he opens that bloody gorgeous mouth of his again.
: ooOoooo
"I- excuse me?"
“Good luck, mate!” Ron calls after Harry, who’s already out the pub door.
So Ron and Hermione took him out.
“Yeah, until our rockstar seeker pulled the snitch out of thin air.
“If we’re so much better then of course you can be kind enough to change my hair back.”
: lmao then why did u send it
: ohhhhh
"Hello Malfoy."
: who’s ready for *hiccup* fire-*hiccup* fireworks!
“Yes, but…” he can’t seem to find an end to that sentence. Good.
At least I had the cats to keep me company or I might’ve abandoned you.”
: thank merlin it’s on the weekend
And I have beautiful feet if I do say so myself
Neither man notices the bewildered looks they’re receiving from one Neville Longbottom, or the money passed from McGonagall’s hand to Flitwick’s.
: oh? do tell
Fortunately - or unfortunately, depending on your stance - the towel falls into position covering Harry’s waist, making it only slightly less awkward when Draco lands on top of him.
Harry tosses over the candy and gives him a small nod, heading to the Great Hall to escape this awkwardness.
"Harry..."  he muttered, shifting so we were spooning and I was the big spoon.
You’re not very subtle, are you?”
: wizard i think! why?
Every time he locked eyes with Draco and felt tingles spread through his body.  Every time they sat just a little too close on couch to watch a muggle movie.  Every time their fingers brush and Harry’s heart raced.  When Draco was sick and Harry missed 4 days of work to take care of him.  Harry admiring Draco’s hair and hands and the way his nose hooks ever so slightly.
: RON UR MY NEW FAVORITE
Have you ever made anything with clay before?”
: UH TELL US WHAT
Now let me help you…”
He’s not
"Ah."  I didn't know what to say after that or why my heart was pounding so wildly.  "Well then, nice talking to you Weasley."
“Yes Professor, that’s fantastic!”
“Well, obviously.
It’s not a question.
Draco imagines that oven-bake clay from first year Transfiguration doesn’t count, so he shakes his head, trying very hard to calm the quell in his chest.
"Malfoy- Black- Dra- What do I call you?  You changed your last name but I don't know if it's still fitting to call you that," Potter awkwardly asked.
Not really.”
twins are truly remarkable
Harry beams.
I meant, what did you crochet?”
How else should I have reacted to that news?”
: thanks for the helpful information
: good to know
: ajshsksjs luna said you’d be fine doofus
Draco rolls his eyes but it’s only to disguise the way his heart just leaped at Harry calling him ‘love’, even if it was sarcastically.
“Er… where will I be staying?”
“Fantastic.
hes not
Maybe you should try it too.”
, Harry reminds himself.
: guys no one tell them
“Yes, of course.  Hermione helped me with it, so it’ll be the best Defense curriculum you’ve ever seen,” Harry assured her.
I’m going to my friends’ wedding, but they’re both a bit out of the ordinary, so the wedding… well, its butterfly-themed.
Ron deadpans.
Harry smells familiar, but he can’t quite place where he’s smelled this before.
Harry thinks about it.
not annoyed but like
Now we just have to come up with something to do.”
“Well, depression is commonly caused by your brain not holding on to enough serotonin, the happy chemical.
He really tries not to be.  There’s nothing wrong with being gay!  Or identifying in any other way, for that matter.  He himself can agree that men are attractive.  But he can’t figure out any other explanation for why he’d be so upset by Draco bringing men home.  And going on dates.  And being gay.  He just doesn’t get it.
: we made out a bit...
"Hey, that's my shirt!"  I said.
: it wasn’t the vodka talking
“Yeah, something for the eight of us to do together next Saturday evening.
"I'm serious!  I do not want you two in a relationship!  Mum, I'd rather you date a sixth-year or something, even though that's illegal.  What's so funny?"
“Yes, Mr. Longbottom.
Harry is currently rummaging awkwardly through Draco’s dresser for a pair of trousers.
Draco grabbed a fourth shot, downed it and hiccuped again.  "That's fair."
: depends
"Oh.  Makes sense.  See you there."
He doesn’t hear it when Ron asks what’s wrong, where’s Draco, are you alright?
: 10 sickles he will
“Hm?”
But now, when I think back… I only really remember the times when Potter was laughing with his friends - or, quite frequently, defying death - and having a good time.
But he shakes it off as misplacing them and sets the small, yellow bag on his desk, resuming work.
“Yes!” Harry exclaims.
It’s a bit like a constipated red raccoon is glaring at him.
Harry gets an owl back from McGonagall allowing them to borrow the pitch and informing them that she removed the anti-apparition wards from that area temporarily.
If Harry sees him blush, he certainly doesn’t say anything about it.
Those are probably his exact words, to be honest.”
dating.
But if it really matters that much, then I will leave you be.”
: AAAAKDHAKDJ
If all eyes were not already on him, Harry tries to stumble backward and trips over his chair, still choking on bread and waving his hands towards his crotch area in an effort to cool it off.
: *raises eyebrow*
Harry stands up, mumbling some excuse about grading papers, and flees the table.
“Er- yeah.
your favor
"Narcissa... I really don't think that would work.  I mean, I suppose I would be willing, only for a few hours, but there's no way you'll get Mal- Draco to agree," I said hopelessly.
: did u say hi
"Hey, er, you go on to your brothers' shop alone.  I'll catch up in a few, okay?"  I said to Ron.
Be quiet.”
: haha
The hallways of Hogwarts are cold at night.
And he looked scared and said ‘I can’t do this’ and apparated away.”
“Well, good for you.
As okay as it can be when you’re in love with someone who doesn’t even recognize you.
: hey hannah
Malfoy shakes his head.
But of course, Draco’s good luck must run out, and something does happen.
“You’re taking a long time with my measurements,” Harry deflects, glancing at his watch.
Then, of course, there’s Dumbledore’s Army, from fifth year.  Just ten years ago, he taught a ragtag group of kids from every house everything he knew at the time, looking at them like friends and comrades, not just fellow students.  People he’d never met before joined a cause they’d only learned about moments prior.  It was that faith that made the right side win the war.
Well, that and- and the sour patch kids!
: i was hoping you sucked
“Malfoy, we’ve sat beside each other for a week of dinners with nothing more than a small grunt of acknowledgment.
: hey you’re both wearing green!
: if you remember more TELL ME IMMEDIATELY
: c’mon don’t keep us in the dark
“Hey!”
: ron look what you’ve done
She’s sent her patronus to Neville.
: i changed my mind
It’s boring.
you’ve literally seen us at our worst
We bid each other goodbye and I grabbed my coat, wandering out the door.
: oh uhm okay
UHHHHHHHHHHHH
: uhhhh i mean nothing important
: ready fred?
Literally.
“Dracoooo, I’m boreddddd,” Harry groans next to me.
Draco just sits there.
“When I was gone those few days.
Professor Harry Potter.”
I was simply showing Professor Potter my support of Gryffindor in the upcoming Quidditch match.”
Harry can’t decide which is worse: his hair falling out or the fact that the laugh of Draco Malfoy is making his knees weak.
Harry turns back to his meal, frowning.
A few weeks later, at the Ministry of Magic, I was headed to class where I'd study to become a Hogwarts Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. I'd been studying all night for my end of semester exam, and after this I'd be home for Christmas.
“I didn’t even mean for it to be pink!
“I work here.
: good choice
My love life is constantly being bet on… although, I bet no one saw this coming.
and I got myself added to a hilarious group chat
“Okay… but don’t read to me anymore or I’ll fall back asleep.
Draco punches in the numbers for the second skein of yarn, because for some reason, it didn’t register the scan.
Draco frowns, confused until he turns it around and sees what’s written on it. The words surrounding a very grumpy cat face read,
"Yes, that sounds wonderful.  I'll teach you a spell to paint walls whenever you want to get started."
When he recovers, Harry is glaring at him and the students and stiffing laughter.
but your crush on him has been obvious since… well, forever
Harry sits there.
Would he remember any of this in the morning?  How would he act around me?  Could it happen again?  Today had been his best day for a long time.  Neither of us thought about the war or our scars or pain... we both just existed together.  It's kind of like... we were healing.
Didn’t really go announcing it to the world, and it's not like you and I were exactly close.”
"As for where I live, I've moved into my Godfather's old place. Only thing is that I have to completely clean out the place, because its very... dark and unhappy feeling."
OR THE FACT THAT HIS NAME IS SKITTLES
“Oh! Right, er- I made a hat and scarf set.”
“Really!”
I didn’t know you’d be there.”
im gonna stay for now
But for Draco, it’s not.
“Well, you’ve got red spots… everywhere…”
: i’m begging you
: AND IDK IF IT WAS JUST DRUNK TALK OR NOT BUT HE CANNOT KNOW
we just do this nickname thing cuz it's funny
So he returns the next day.
I took him when he walked into the doorframe and lost sight in one eye
yes obviously
: plz don’t say what i think ur gonna say
Draco has turned back around, adding ingredients and stirring and casting spells as the class watches on raptly, taking notes.
He places feather-light kissing upon Draco’s cheek and jaw, slowly moving down to his neck and collarbone.
“Well, you’re acting like we’re old friends, not like we’ve tried to hurt each other on multiple occasions,” Malfoy bites out.
Harry frowns and goes back to eating his food, trying to come up with a way to prove that he isn’t thickheaded.
“That’s fair.”
: shit i always lose
: ...
"About 10:00.  I left some coffee in the pot but you'll have to warm it.  Let me know before you leave the house, just so that I know where you are dear."
What has he gotten himself into?
"So Draco did tell you I was here?"  I asked.
"Yes."  I smiled slightly.
"I think ash floors would look good, give the place a homey but modern feel.  What do you think?" Narcissa asked me.  I tried to remember what ash floors looked like, but was drawing a blank, and she could tell because she summoned the floor sample to show me what it looked like.
: ajdhaksjs thanks
Potion-making is more useful and practical than any defensive spell is.”
I realized that I uh
: oh yeah
: PANSYS GONNA LOVE THIS
: but you- you were surprised a moment ago?
When he pushes the door open, Draco looks up and meets Harry’s eyes and instantly he feels himself smiling.
"My place," he said hurriedly.
: doesn’t ring a bell
I fall asleep this way, inhaling the relaxing scent of him and smiling.
They sit in silence again as Draco thinks.
I raised my eyebrow at him.  "A crush?  Draco, I'm 22, not 12.  Crushes are for children.  On that note, yes, I do." I gave him a look, and he egged me on.
He’s an Auror, though, so he can do that.
—— 6 Hours ——
That’s definitely not what he was expecting Draco to say, and he looks up in confusion.
: oi! i don’t get a discount!
They lock eyes once more, but properly this time, and all of a sudden Draco feels seen in a way that he’s never been seen before.
Is this desire to get to know Harry Potter?
Even Draco seems like he’s trying not to smile, despite shaking his head and cursing Harry under his breath.
“I know, I know.
: wait
: okay okay
er thanks
They’re all sitting around the fire, Harry still leaning into Ron.
“Potter, unless you’re going to help me teach, get out,” he teases.
[hiss hiss bitches, 2:04 PM, Tuesday]
"Uhh..."
but then they all said their names and you’ll never fucking guess who these fuckers are
Harry can feel his face flushing for whatever ungodly reason and shakes it off, walking around the blond in front of him.
: i don’t recall :)
: should we wear matching suits in shades of blue or purple?
Nope.
It’s warm, and when Draco puts it on it fits perfectly.
oh merlin don’t encourage him
: *hands hermione 4 sickles*
Draco smiles, recounting his mother holding his hands while he squeezed his eyes shut and let the beautician pierce his ears.
Draco? Gay? But he shagged practically every girl in our year, and others! Well, good for him, I suppose. I didn't know why that made my heart leap so I chose just to keep talking.
“Oh, whatever,” Harry shoves his shoulder into Draco’s and continues walking.
“Oh, my aunt and uncle were very anti-magic, and so when I did stuff like that, they just got angry and locked me in my cupboard without explaining anything.”
: that can’t be good
Merlin knows you do that for me plenty already, I wouldn’t mind returning the favor.”
most popular club in Wizarding London.
Maybe he should just relax.
Draco’s brows furrow even further, causing the man to laugh, full and heartfelt.
I turned around and walked towards the proper entrance.  "Yes, of course I've been here.  I just zoned out, that's all."
HELL YES
Let’s get back to it, yeah?
oh no this partAY is just getting started
: tell him i suck too
: yeah i’ll text them-
What do you think?”
: harry make them stop :(
Draco visibly relaxes once Harry has left. So many thoughts are running through his mind, but the steady repetition of scanning items and bagging them for customers keeps him calm enough to get through the rest of the day.
"You're dating Hermione?!" Ginny and I exclaimed at the same time, huge smiles on our faces.
Then the classroom bursts into laughter, and Draco turns on Harry, fury in his eyes.
“Well that would be why you’re still affected so badly.
in a land of myth
It’s just… your laugh… it’s so wonderful.”
: anyway ur not allowed to text us again until ur dating potter
You don’t have to pretend,” he says, a half-smile floating on his face.
“How do I fix this?” Draco asks, both determined and nervous.
: what was that?
: i’ll be the common sense to your stupid bravery harry
When I accidentally grabbed his hand to apparate... it was like a habit.  My body just did.  I didn't even think about it until he squeezed my hand slightly and I looked up and saw his surprised expression.  I tried to let go, I really did, but my brain didn't let me.  So we held hands.  And I loved it.
{so now they’re at the partAY and i know it doesn’t make sense for them to text but i’m lazy and my hands hurt so imma keep writing in text style.
*facepalm emoji*
Harry wakes up the next day and hopes that Draco’s hookup isn’t still at their apartment, because the only thing worse than hearing them is running into them.
I would have to say no, but then again, I don’t know the context of the question
“I’m fine,” Draco says, but he doesn’t feel it.
"Well... so I have a girlfriend-" at that we all interrupted.
Just fun to make, I suppose.
"We can use spells to muffle and shit.  Just go."  I was glad he was letting me apparate us since he was drunk.  We appeared outside Draco's room and he shoved me against the door, pushing it open and forcing us inside.
Draco pauses.
Neville bids Harry goodbye before leaving to get dressed.
“Potter, in what universe are you even partially capable of brewing a potion correctly?”
He’s been in love with him for years now, although it took him most of those years to even realize it.
: or the ten percent golden boy discount we give you
When Draco enters the hallway of his apartment building to find it empty, despite the rather obvious repeated knocking, he huffs.
He shakes his head, smothering the blush creeping up his neck.
He doesn’t want to draw more attention to himself than absolutely necessary.
that was a weird way to describe that, but go off ig
When the flight attendants come by to check on us, they only smile at the sight of us cuddling.
He’s just begun scrambling a couple eggs over the stove when he hears the notorious creak of Draco’s bedroom door opening.  Shit.
“You tryna assure me or you?”
Draco can’t help but grin at the stupid look on Harry’s face.
At a certain point, Harry’s teasing of me became less rude and more… well, bored.
Both of our heads shot up, wide awake.
Draco feels sorry for the boy, being under the Headmistresses gaze this late at night.
keep going."
: IM STILL HAPPY CUZ U CAN FINALLY STOP PINING
“Oh.”
“Now, one final thing for you to know.  As Headmistress, I have instituted a rule that students may sit at whichever house tables they please, and on the weekends they may travel between all Common Rooms.
Except, it’s neon pink, which isn’t at all a bad thing for Harry.
: we’re never having a party like this again
That’s what Draco’s calling them, he’s decided.
How did Draco never realize Harry was this fit?
After multiple days of this, Harry is fed up.
Nothing to see.”
How could this have happened?
"Yeah, that's what I meant," I said, knowing that if Narcissa wasn't helping me I'd be hopeless.
: business fancy = i tried but only cuz i had to
An hour later, he’s danced with two boys and a very tall woman that could probably crush his skull between her thighs, and he’s having a blast.
im flattered that you’re all so welcoming /s
: did i?
“Alright, you may begin… now!” Hermione exclaims as Luna blows the whistle rather melodically.
There’s a brown paper package on his desk that definitely was not there the night before, and he can only assume it was delivered this morning.
No I don’t.
: really mate
That was the wrong thing to say, and Harry realized this as soon as he saw the mischievous smirk and devilishly glowing eyes of one Draco Malfoy.
“That’ll be £4.17, are you paying with cash or-” Draco abruptly stops speaking, causing the man across from him to look up.
“Get back here, you prat!”
: uhhhhh
But it was obviously too late.
Harry is still lying in bed when Ron shows up.
"Hm?  Oh, uh, we're heading to Ikea."
“I’ll be right back, I’m going to the loo,” Harry mumbles to Ron, sliding across the black leather seats and making his way across the main dance floor.
: let’s get this party starteddd
Only, he didn’t ever expect to run into Draco Malfoy.
Harry Potter sent him a birthday present.
I discovered that my appreciation went even further.”
: mood
What is Harry Potter doing in the suburbs of London running a joint like this?
Here,” he says, taking Harry’s hands in his own and guiding his arms out to where they’re supposed to be.
he thinks he’s smart
: i mean draco and harry
I read to him for an hour and a half, and then he just passed out on me.
: *gives draco terrible puppy dog eyes*
She chuckles.  “Let’s not make promises we can't keep.”
More?
: yeah
Harry has made a habit of going into Draco’s classes when he doesn’t have classes of his own to teach.
what’s happening?
Do you work here?”
: ajdhakdhsk mione shush
Hopefully, it’ll still work, but just in case, he should have his wand ready.
: what are the rest of you guys wearing
With party rooms, private rooms, gambling tables, the main dance area, a restaurant, a stage for live bands and karaoke, and way more alcohol than is probably legal, Harrow Heights has made a name for itself.
get wrecked harry
"-yes, after we had the best fucking sex ever, I layed there, and I held you, and I felt your breathing and I thought about it and figured you wouldn't want anything more with me.  And I know you don't.  But I do.  For some crazy reason, being around you makes me feel happy.  I love that.  I wanna... I wanna be with you Draco.  Even if it doesn't last, I wanna savor every moment.  Because you're amazing and gorgeous and sexy and you smell good and- I don't know.  I'm sorry.  You can go.  I just figured I'd shoot my shot, you know?"
: IM LOSING IT
Waking up with Harry next to me would've been perfection.  But instead I woke up with a dent in my mattress.  I didn't have a headache from the alcohol though, so he must've gotten me a hangover potion at some point.  Which meant he cares about me.  But he couldn't... or else why would he have left?
An opportunity for a prank.
“Malfoy!”
He can only stay lost in those green eyes.
: love you too friend
"Then... what would you say to the idea of being my boyfriend?"
: alright go for it
“What are you going to do with all of them?”
As I remember, Luna and Hermione don’t.”
He really does get into the mojo of designing outfits.
"I feel much better now, too.  Good day to you.  And, for the record, I do believe you're trying to change." Harry said kindly.
I don’t know what… why…”
If he had only stayed quiet about his worsening anxiety, she might not have sent him on this wild goose chase that brought him across England to Number 12 Grimmauld Place.
: a glow up?
RED ALERT
“I could ask you the same thing.”
: AHAHAKHDKSJDK
It wasn’t too bad, really desensitized me to spiders…”
—— 12 hours ——
I was slightly apprehensive about going to the Malfoy Manor, but the address that she sent didn't belong to the Manor, so I was excited about seeing her new residency.
When I realize what I did, I stiffen, hoping Harry won’t notice, but the raven-haired boy on my shoulder only smiles wider.
idk what to do
: me AND harry? why were we together?
Ron and Hermione live together cuz they’re engaged and little mindless arguments crop up from time to time
I can see it on your face.
Draco lying naked on my bare chest was the most fabulous feeling in the world.  It was even better than when we were... he couldn't even think about it.
"You'll cum at my pace, slut."  With that, I thrusted hard into him again and again and again.
doing it.”
“Malfoy!”
when i looked at him he just kept staring, and he looked
“Sorry, wasn’t paying attention.”
Draco doesn’t pull away, and Harry takes that as a sign to continue gently rubbing off the hardening gray substance.
Draco takes Harry’s hands in one of his, the other pulling out the ring box as he kneels.
It was my turn to sigh.  "No, we're going to apparate.  Now Potter-"
: wow someone’s impatient
He’s greeted with the sight of messy black hair sunk low into the steaming baths.
what just happened
They’re itchy and annoying, and Draco’s head spins.
"I can help with the renovation if you'd like! I quite like doing that kind of thing, and I could use something to keep me busy."
"Narcissa?"
For once, I’m making
Mold is good for the clay.”
: OwO
: SO I REMEMBERED SOMETHING ELSE FROM LAST NIGHT
What do you teach? Apparently, McGonagall didn’t think to warn me that you’d be here.”
"What?  Where are you going, mate?"
“Are there such things as purple butterflies?”
He wraps his arms around the blonde, taking Draco’s hands in his own and using guiding his motions.
But finally, the time comes for them to get ready for the feast.  The Hogwarts Express will be arriving soon; they need to be in the Great Hall before then.
After attempting to fix my hair but giving up, I headed downstairs and poured myself a cup of coffee in a to-go mug so that I could head out immediately.
“And anyway, it’s not like it matters what they think, because we don’t.”
“You’re not going anywhere until you tell me what’s in that bag.”
Anyway, I don’t own anything more brightly colored than a red and gold scarf.”
“I remember her laughing so hard and telling me to stay put so she could get the camera, and she took a picture of me told me she thought I looked wonderful.”
Because… I love you.”
: ... flutes?
Harry’s smiling, but his smile is fading as he speaks because with every word, Draco looks more and more anxious.
It only takes him about two seconds to shoot up in bed and mutter, “Malfoy, you arse!”
Harry’s heart is slowly shattering, like an ache that just won’t go away, but he persists.
“What do you want, Potter?”
“About the time you forgot how to yourself.”
This sends Harry into further fits of laughter, and Draco beams.
“A toad?”
“Potions?”
: i’ll only do that if you clean up the puke and shower
“Er- yeah.
---------------------------------
: tho ig after last night we’re friends now too
russian hitmen?
i just don’t want it to be stupid interesting
: we what potter
After making dinner and feeding Mocha and my owl, Ella, I slept nicely knowing that tomorrow would be wonderful.
It took a long time, but we finally had it all sorted.  We kept a few of the beds because we decided that they could be re-stained to match whichever room they were placed in.  We would have to reupholster all the sofas and would need a new dining room table, among other things.  I was excited to go furniture shopping with Narcissa, because she has great taste.
“Well, why don’t you do something about it?
"Ah ah ah! I said they'd be dating by the end of last year and technically they were. Which means you owe me 20 sickles," Ginny said with a smirk.
Could he make this right?
: ... how do you not know where you are
: AJDGAKDHDRARRY
Malfoy, I have to say, I’m offended.
Harry knows he shouldn’t be taunting the Slytherin, but old habits die hard.
So Harry has to move closer to him again to grab the colors.
His brain short-circuits.
“Absolutely.”
Ron smiles a little bit.
: it only took like 10 years
Perfect.
"Ha! I told you they'd be dating by the end of this year!! You owe me 20 sickles!" I exclaimed triumphantly.
"Uhhhh... no- I- I think there's another-" but I was shut up my Draco's lips clumsily smashed against mine.  I instantly kissed him back, not hesitating to wrap my arms around his neck.
“How teaching?” Potter asks, rather hesitantly.
: dra- ugh
Draco and I were silent as Narcissa changed the topic.
I thought.  So instead I changed courses to his ear and whispered "Gonna let go?"
: UHHHHHH GUYS
Harry leaves the clay smeared on his cheek when they leave, not wanting to ruin the moment when he and Draco first fell in love.
"Of course, idiot.  I was drunk, not amnesiac."  I mumbled.
: i’ve been third wheeling for the last 12 years and i’m destined to never stop
Harry thinks back and realizes that he’s never known where the staff stayed during the school year.  He’s sure Hermione knows, however.  She knows everything about Hogwarts.  She’s even helped him prepare his curriculum for this year.
: draco are you still showering
Apparently, their agreement to be courteous extends to making small talk during meals.
“Don’t you dare get my hair wet, you daft walnut,” Draco teases, swimming out to meet his fake boyfriend.
: you’re all allowed to bring a plus one (besides your romantic partner who is likely already invited) bc i want this to be smashing good
: LMFAO WHAT
ten sickles he got his head stuck in the banister
: so rmr when u told me to let u know if i rmr anything else from last night
: *is breathing heavy*
Nor does he suspect anything when he dries his hair and a few stray pieces come off into the towel.
Unlike during their school years, he’s not being followed and watched every second of every day.
“Aw, don’t wanna be associated with me?” He teases.
“Oh, that’ll be easy.
Harry and Draco both turn to him at the same time and give him a look, sending him into a fit of nervous giggles.
The person that saved my life.
“Pardon?”
It’s almost 3 more weeks before Draco and Harry run into each other again.
That’s that.
“Yeah.
: IM SORRY
Obviously, it’s Draco, and he’s going to brew the potion correctly.
“Hey!”
Pris just grins.
"I don't blame you."
Draco hears movement, and all of a sudden Ron is in his kitchen, making food.
: ER- I JUST HEARD A CRASH OUTSIDE THIS ROOM ?!??!?
like on television?
"Oh yes please," he moaned.
Please?” The look on Draco’s face just makes Harry shake his head and do what’s asked of him.
“Why not?  I can feel it, you like me too.”
Draco doesn’t say anything and he wonders if he’s crossed a line of some sort, but then he can make out a small smile etched into the pale features of the blonde man’s face and everything is okay.
That doesn’t happen very often.
: spit it out
: HAHAHAHA
: yeah some of us have shit to do in the morning
Harry closes his eyes, internally groaning.
: rmr when a few months back i told you i’d been harboring a crush for a while
anyway
Of course, it needs to be a high-contrast color to accentuate his muscular figure, and he’ll have to be careful to get the height measurements correct.
: i was out shopping and i saw malfoy
nuh uh
“Yes, and remember, we’re all friends no matter who wins!” Luna adds, preparing her score box.
“Harry, that’s- oh Merlin.
“Potter,” Draco warns, fighting a smile.
What happens in Harrow
but yes
“Harry.”
Anyway, now you have a chance to redeem yourself.”
but no
This is the most wonderful group of people I could hope to work with, and I’m very grateful for your support.”
-----------------------------------
He chokes on it, he wheezes, he can’t breathe, and when he does it only hurts.
“Mr. Potter, how wonderful it is to see you,” she smiles at him.  It’s one of those rare smiles that he only ever sees when she’s proud of him.
“Are you an absolute maniac?
A Cheering Charm would just make you
As he closed the door behind us I thought,
It’s your birthday, you’re not allowed to gift me any gifts today.
I’m… sorry.
Harry scoffs.
Harry is sitting in a muggle pub with Ron, Dean, Seamus, and Neville, trying to sort out his feelings.  He just doesn’t get it.
"Draco dear?  Are you home?"
When Harry blushes for the umpteenth time that morning, Draco winks and returns to his measurements.
“Looking at my legs now, huh?” Harry retorts.
“I’m having a party, obviously.
They exchanged a look and burst out laughing, tea shooting out of Potter's nose.  Which, of course, caused them to laugh more, but Potter's laughter was joined with shouts of sudden pain.
weird asf
: ur right how could i forget
: boys smh
Really… compliments your skin.”
I sigh. “What now, Potter?”
: you really are daft
Give me back my clothes!”
: UHHHHH GUYS
Certainly not.
He’s dropping flower petals all over the floor and putting the roses in a vase when he hears Harry wake up and Ron talking to him.
: uh huh
It’ll be okay.
Friendship?
that was an accident!
The walk to the Headmistresses office has never felt so long and shameful.
Harry smiles innocently.
She left me alone and came back to find me in one of her dresses - she’s a bit on the shorter side, and I was a tall child - and I had just finished slicking back my hair when I told her I was ready.
Harry is a bit surprised that Malfoy of all people wants to be courteous, but he’s willing to agree if it’ll make his life easier.
Harry playfully slaps my shoulder and the thrill that runs through my body at his touch as me blushing and stuttering for hours.
“Of course, Mr. Potter.  I’m glad to have you back.”
They should be able to help you better than I can.”
"He's not my father.  And fine.  I suppose I can deal with him for one day.  But there's no way on earth you'll get him to agree, so good luck."
the man hasn’t even given us his name and you’re deducing where he lives
: you say that and yet you married me
He smells of wood and treacle tart and something else that I can’t quite place.
: you mean partAY
: GET ITTTTT
you’re a fucking qqqqutkk77
“Uhm.
Merlin…
Someone - not someone, Potter - got here before him.
"Draco, where are we going?"  Harry asked with a deep sigh.  So deep, so, so-
: sleep
: me too
skittles is indeed a rag doll
“Draco and I… weren’t dating.
Ron nods while Dean and Seamus smile knowingly at him.
He picks up the thermos and closes the door, heading to the kitchen.
Harry pulls back, looking into stormy grey eyes with his own emerald green eyes.
“My candy?” He gestures to the bag still in Harry’s hand.
: but really, were happy for you
: EYEYEYEYEY
He tries every counterspell in the book, every hair-changing charm that he knows of, but nothing works.
Harry has fallen asleep on my shoulder.
: i was sleeping
✴︎✴︎✴︎
Everything is going great, and Draco can’t help but wish it’ll never end.
: okay...
: you’ve got draco now so ur not third-wheeling anymore
I chuckled.  "There's a lot of things you don't know about me.  What kinds of things should I tell you?"
“Again, not my problem.”
"Do you still want help assembling the furniture today?  I'm free all day," I suggested apprehensively.
While I was eating my soup it occurred to me that he probably thought I was too drunk to remember anything.  Harry probably used me to get laid, thinking I wouldn't remember in the morning.  There go my hopes of being anything more with him.
"I have to use the loo and don't exactly trust the one in their shop.  Could be jinxed, you know?"
The students’ laughter is audible now, and Harry just glares.
“Er… I don’t really know.
“You’re very bad at hiding your house bias, Potter.”
I’ve done a lot of bad, bad things, but the worst by far was lying to you.”
Turns out teaching isn’t that difficult when you’ve got good students.”
“Really?”
He hesitated.  "Uhm... sure.  I'm heading over in about an hour.  Whenever you wanna apparate over is fine."
“It wasn’t
He should clean, but…
So, if anyone’s going to be reprimanded-”
I sighed. "Potter, what do you want?"
“That’s the spirit!”
“Boys!
"Maybe. But don't count on me, Potter, I'm not very trustworthy."
So why did you lie to him?”
: we’ve been friends for quite some time.
The shimmering purple is almost holographic, changing color depending on the angle in which it’s viewed, and captivating Draco.
are you a 50-year old man with foot fungus
Not going to find the toilets down here, he supposes.
: awww is ickle ronickins scared to party with us?
in love with you.”
: gUYS
“You’re home early,” Draco says happily.  Harry loves Draco’s voice.
“Yes, perfectly, why?” He responds, scratching the back of his neck.
“Serves you right for thinking Potions is better than Defense.”
Really, they couldn’t have set up warming charms across the castle?
“Shit guys!  Do I like Draco?  Is that what this is?!”
“Wait- I mean- you don’t… have to…” I regret the words as soon as they leave my mouth - I’m regretting a lot of things today apparently - but Harry only blushes.
: i feel like i got run over by the knight bus
Repeat.
“They requested I use muggle transportation.” A blatant lie. “What about you, Mr. Potter?”
Draco is busy in the living room, setting up.
Draco gets back to scanning the next customers items.
: yeah and
: don’t you remember the gay bar?
Neville speaks up, stifling his own chuckles.  “Well, if he brought home women would you feel the same way?”
He’s been laying in bed just the same as you, doing nothing.
: commence the chaotic celebration
How can I help you this morning?” Draco asks, trying to prevent his voice from cracking.
"Bye mum!" I called.
I just think you all might uh not like me
, I thought to myself.
"Holy fuck," I muttered.
the destiny of a great kingdom rests upon the shoulders of a young man
As long as you’re happy.”
: no i haven’t, and he’s even hotter now
: absolutely
And for some reason I found myself muttering, "Yes, please."
"Hey, this is where you stood up for Potter in second year.  I called it, didn't I?  He got himself a girlfriend," I said with a bittersweet chuckle.
Harry is a bit flabbergasted.
Draco puts his spoon in his bowl and faces his childhood enemy once more.
Harry nods, trying for a smile.
“Well, for the first 12 years of my life, my bedroom was the cupboard under the stairs.
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
Draco blushed and paused for a bit, before looking at me with one eyebrow raised sexily.
“What are you doing?”
: you motherfucker you sent it
: YEAHHHH
“You all made bets on who my boyfriend was and I didn’t want to lose because I didn’t have one, so I desperately asked Draco to pretend to be my boyfriend for the night.
I thought we were better than this.”
It’s a coffee mug that says
Which is why he doesn’t like Harry Potter.
: well how much do you see each other
: wait what were you thinking of?
“I would like to congratulate you all on making it into whichever house you have achieved and remind you that your sorting represents where you’ll succeed the most, not where you’re required to spend all your time.
Fall is approaching, after all, and there’s a much larger homeless population in Muggle London than in the Wizarding World.
: mione and i lost track of you and harry at about midnight
"Okay."  And that was that.  He walked back upstairs.  I poured myself coffee and did the same.
His creamy hazelnut skin is smooth and nearly unblemished, save for a small scar peeking out from between his black birds-nest of hair.
: ugh
Every pair of eyes in the Great Hall for breakfast turns to him as he stops in front of where Harry is standing by the Gryffindor table.
Draco pretends not to hear, but he’s grinning all the same.
They stand there awkwardly, Harry looking at how much Malfoy has changed until he clears his throat.
I said “that’s really cute!
“That’s a secret.
Little do they know, the unusually still tabby cat sitting in the stands
: ??? I could literally be a 50-year old man with foot fungus
: and what, stalk him?
“I think those colors suit you, honestly.
Glancing around, I noticed some natural light, following it to the source and discovering that the place did, in fact, have windows.  I pulled down the curtain and watched the cloud of dust
THEY USED THE SAME SONGS AS US AHAHAHAHA
“And it’s our turn to pick the activity...”
: why are you all ganging up on me ur literally my family
“Potter, I’m going to New York. Same as you and everyone else on this plane.”
"Okay. Remember how Harry had something big to tell us? And then he came out as gay? Well, we still love and support him." After a moment of silence, he confirmed, "We do, right?" Everyone nodded their head in agreement, looks of confusion on our faces.
I’ll demonstrate it now, and…”
Unfortunately, Draco walks faster than Harry thought because he’s turned around before he’s quite finished and Harry has to lower his wand prematurely.
: mostly because we dolt have to listen to you complaining for you
I spend the next two-and-a-half hours pondering my existence, reading, and trying to ignore the raven-haired boy to my right. This sounds easier than it is, because Potter starts bothering me.
: wow, you two look great!
“That’s nice.”
They look so familiar that Draco’s heart skips a beat, but for some reason, he can’t write place them.
WAKE ME UP
When we got back to my place and started unpacking everything, I realized how much assembly we had to do.
At this, Draco sees a flash of anger behind Harry’s eyes.
“No, it’s only fun if we’re both reading.
Interrupting my lesson?” Draco snarks, stalking off to retrieve the metal bottle.
: ahahaha what now
"No!" I stopped thrusting.  I was gonna be a bitch to him.  "Whats my name in bed?"
: where’s all that gryffindor courage
Is he okay?” Draco asks desperately.
: so er
: perfect!
: no u first
"Oh come off it Draco, I am not in a relationship with him," Narcissa said, rolling her eyes. But Draco and I exchanged a quick glance, knowing that not what he was talking about. "I mean,
Go home and get some rest.”
I forced the door open, my mouth on his.  Damn he tasted good.  I kicked the door shut and pulled out my wand, casting Muffliato on the door so no one could hear him scream.  'Cuz he would.
what brain cells
Of course, after he learns the theory of the charm work, he has to practice, except that would require brewing Amortentia, and he really doesn’t want to do that.
He cocks his head. “What?”
: i promise you can trust me, i wouldn’t do anything to hurt my friends’ friend
: seamus refrain me from strangling our incredibly stupid redhead friend
: HELL YEAH GET THAT MAN JUICE
And Draco can’t deny that Potter is attractive, in a stupid sort of way.
I stopped.  I didn't wanna hear it.  But here I was.
: oh?
: uhhhhh no that’s all i’ve got
: ...i did NOT see that coming
"Yep!"
He finds his way to the cash register, manned by Pris, and asks about Draco.
Draco tries not to sound disappointed by how earnest Harry is to leave.
What did you do?”
: it’s called the proper unproper partay for a reason
It’s useless because Draco disappears behind the door and reappears a few moments later with his hands behind his back and a mischievous smile on his face.
The red-haired boy sits at Harry’s desk and watches Harry sleep peacefully.
: you got a video and DIDNT send it to our girls gc immediately?
: oi clean up your vomit!
“Wait, if you’re not starting here as a new teacher, then how long have you been working here?”
“Potter?”
“There you are.”
“A good thing for beginners to start with is making a cauldron or a pot of some kind.
“Why are you all laughing at me!  This isn’t funny!  I don’t like my roommate dating other people and I need to figure out why!”
[screen recording of previous convo, do crime but smart]
: seamus has been puking all morning
: wait we’re actually doing this?
“Who says you’re not following me?” He chokes out.
: or at least date me
It’s also the most unique, with an inner layout similar to that of The Burrow, only about ten times bigger.
: fantastic
"Well, thank you for the thought but I didn't need to be woken up," I tried to say tartly but it came out a lot shakier than anything.
“I’ve made some pretty big mistakes.
harry i know you said to eat before we come but i’ve been dying to make this one recipe so can i bring food for everyone
: but at the same time i also want george and fred’s fireworks and karaoke yk
Harry nods.
: there are 4/7 weasleys here btw
let’s have a party
Draco is about to huff and discard his fruitless search through the purples when something small catches his eye.
After owling Narcissa back confirming the time, I fixed up dinner and made a list of what I needed to do to fix the house.
I immediately responded that of course I would be there. Suddenly, I noticed her name change and made a mental note to ask her about it tomorrow over tea.
What are you in the mood for?” Harry asks.
: sorry i was making harry get us coffee and painkillers
Aside from the giant bag of hats and scarves, of course.
“How ‘bought you go to his place next time, hm?  You don’t always have to bring them back to our flat.  I live here too.”
Harrow Heights is one of the- scratch that,
“Since you obviously don’t know how to follow instructions, let me help you.”
: drarry is cannon
Harry sighs and hands him £5 in cash, hands shaking violently.
bet ur wishing it was a drag queen club
“Oh,” he says with a mouthful of danish.
: IT IS!!
Just make an appointment with the local clinic and tell them your symptoms.
Once I was in my room again, I decided to tidy up.  I picked up the bedding that had been thrown around and put the lube back in the drawer.
I think it might be
The nostalgia hits him like the Whomping Willow, and he grins, filled with such joy and happiness.  Filling his plate wing chicken legs and peas mashed potatoes and pudding, he thinks back to memories of his early Hogwarts years.
He glances back and the look of fury on Harry’s face is absolutely priceless.
He froze, tightening his grip on me.  I leaned in slowly and instantly regretted it.
The second it left my mouth I regretted it, but I was scared and anxious and didn’t expect it.
: AHAHAH WHAT DO I SAY NOW
: AHAHAHAH
: little slow today are we potter?
He hears a moan from the bedroom beside his and cringes.  He’d better put up silencing spells, or it’s going to be a long night…
: that’s good
Mother cracked up at the story and when I got a good look at who it was I almost fainted.
: i’m so ready to get smashed as hell
: it stills screws me up to see ron giving relationship advice
"Morning."
: it was a week ago and you almost bROKE MY NOSE
“You’re doing it.”
: Yes lol
Draco rolls his eyes and relaxes quite a bit.
He would look fabulous in yellow, or maybe green, to match his eyes, Draco thinks.
Again.”
I don’t know what got into us.”
“So then you know this is a date?” Harry asks.
giving the front a welcoming vibe, despite the fact that all the outer walls are blackened with peeling paint.
Well, as interesting as teaching can be, I suppose.”
You check your pillow for curses?”
"Dearest Narcissa, I don't know!  Maybe we should run away and elope!" Potter replied in the same tone.
Then he grins.
Draco was on his 3rd shot.  I could tell he was trying to look like he was a heavyweight, but it wasn't working very well.
Sure, he’s friends with his coworkers, but they’ve never brought him anything before.
Harry frowns.
: agreed
he’s bound to show up again
“Malfoy?
: AJSHAKSJSK
Draco doesn’t mean to say that, but Harry’s smile makes it worth it.
: great
: who are you out to
PLZ SEND PICS OF UR CAT
He gets dressed and heads to the great hall for breakfast, all the while hair falls off his head, leaving a trail behind him.
And suddenly Draco remembers he’s being chased by a naked Harry Potter, and that spurs him into action.
Draco stares.
You looking to make some pottery today?”
The logical course of events would be for Harry to get Draco back, so he’s been staying extra alert, watching for anything suspicious in Potter’s behavior.
The group glances at each other, hoping that whatever Luna’s doing brings Harry back out of this stupor.
, all of his visible skin is covered with funny red rashes.
I accidentally got texted by a random number but it was funny so I responded n stuff
“Gwaine- no, not the sink-“ Draco sighs as his owl barrels straight into the kitchen sink.
There’s also a crumpled-up piece of parchment inside the mug.
Draco walks to his desk and pulls out a hand-held mirror.
He simply pushes past Draco - an easy feat as he hasn’t eaten since the beach - and closes the door behind him.
More like… comfortable in his own skin, something Draco can’t relate to.
"Zabini?  No way man.  No offense but he's not my type.  Also isn't he straight?  The guy I like is gay too."
“Since last year.”
pull just a small little prank?
Just a sliver tucked between two others, but Draco immediately knows.
Naked, in the castle, chasing each other… I simply cannot believe it,” McGonagall mumbles to herself, shaking her head and rubbing her eyes.
—— 4 Hours ——
“You’re beautiful, Harry,” Draco unintentionally mumbles.
"Oh god harry... you're my little slut... you're my toy... Fuckkkk..."
cupboard?”
For a moment, they just both stay there, frozen in place, now detached from each other.
last night, did we?” Harry asks, nervousness clear in his voice.
"Ugh."
How had he fallen for that so easily?
"Well, after seven years of fighting Voldemort, I was kind of done catching criminals," I said jokingly.
“Yeah.”
“You two lovebirds are adorable, but let’s get the snitch back to the ground so I can eat.
Malfoy.
Nothing like waking up to a sunny Saturday with a package on his desk.
Harry’s goofy smirk sets Draco’s heart on fire, and he has to turn away to hide his blush.
: potter check your snapchat
Draco grins.
Harry cocks his head and looks at me, and suddenly I feel naked.
Draco pretends not to notice, but Harry’s hand are still shaking.
An hour later, he’s outside the door of a rather ordinary looking apartment with a large thermos of soup in hand.
I guess I’ll have to have my secret affair with dragon another time :(
: ron we’re all your family
But work called me in early and I had to rush, and it was crazy busy…”
Well, until we finished apparating.  But for the four seconds we held hands, I was in heaven.  And I hated it.  Why was Harry- no, Potter- making me feel this way?  As much as I loved the feeling, I couldn't give in.
Harry sits in silence, staring into the flickering flames.
He hasn’t been outside in two days.
“Also, if we could all be kind to Professor Potter, as it is his first year teaching, that would be appreciated.
: NOTHING
He looks over to the blond, swallowing his mouthful of chicken.
"Draco wait!  Please, if you would just listen-"
But of course Harry’s luck isn’t that good.
: never ever expected to hear those words but continue
: PFFTSJDHAJDH
: okay suddenly you all went silent and it’s oddly frightening
Shit. When did he become ‘his Harry’?
Not that Draco’s been looking.
And then he... blushed?  No, that couldn't be it.  Except... he did blush.  And it was freaking adorable.  But he kept playing it off, so I ignored it.
