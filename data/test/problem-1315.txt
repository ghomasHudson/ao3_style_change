He ran up to the entrance of the building, his memory from the last time guiding him through the corridors and elevators to his front door. He felt the abundance of alcohol washing through him as he ran through the halls, his cheeks growing warmer and his pace growing sloppy. He wished he wasn’t drunk, he wished he had the courage to do this sober, to fight for what he wanted, needed.
“There’s no way in fucking hell that that piece of shit is staying at MY apartment!” He heard Harry booming throughout the hall, even with the door closed. If this was what the Ministry considered alternative housing, he wanted nothing to do with it. Living with Potter was not on his bucket list.
He tiptoed over to the door, his heart pounding in his chest, before opening the door slowly, his hand wearily on his wand. He took a deep breath, turning his head around the door to catch a glimpse of the suspect.
“Oh shut up, I wanted it to have a personal touch.” Harry says in defence, his cheeks blushing lightly.
Harry leaned his forehead against Draco’s before bringing his chin forward, their lips grazing, Draco afraid to reciprocate.
Once he arrived at the Ministry, he got some wide-eyed glances, probably just alarmed that an ex death eater was in their presence but Draco has long since dropped that title so the ignorant glances of others didn’t bother him as much anymore. As he approached the door of the office, he felt at ease, sure that this would be just another routine checkup to make sure that he and Harry weren’t killing each other. He was trying to decide if he would mention that they were honestly doing the opposite.
“What do you need.” he bickered.
“Merlin, Potter. You had me scared shitless, hell are you doing pestering at my door at this hour?” He then caught a whiff of his scent, “And bloody plastered at that?”
“Yes Marvin, Happy New Year” Harry responded, pulling his shirt over top of his head.
“It’s fine” Nick groaned, cleaning himself off before turning around to fall asleep.
“This is not unexpected as we know the group in question has been hunting down disloyal death eaters for the last year, the Goyle family was affected just last week. In the meantime, Draco has been placed under the Ministry’s watch, currently residing with our own Harry Potter.” Harry felt some quick glances in his direction.
“I don’t know. Cause I was on the wrong side of the war? I guess.” Draco felt himself growing uncomfortable at the vulnerability but proceeded nonetheless. “I was such a prick in school, and did some really fucked up shit. It feels like I’m undeserving to go there.”
“Well, you can either get off your ass and go home, or you can stay and help me out with the Malfoy case. Up to you.” Casper said, clearly growing impatient with Harry’s indecision. Despite being a great adviser at times, patience was never Casper’s strong suit.
Draco’s nerves grew at Harry’s ability to be so casual, even the slight scruff on his beard screamed effortless. Though he felt he always looked presentable, there was something about Harry that Draco longed for.
Harry knew he was right, and that the connection between him and Draco had become undeniable. Yet the idea of being vulnerable with anyone, Draco especially, was already making his chest tighten with anxiety.
Harry walked out of the room, the purple sleeves reaching an inch past his fingertips, the pants gathering at the base of his feet. Damn he’s cute, Draco thought, brushing the intrusive thought aside before handing Potter a mug with Earl Grey tea.
Casper and Harry had been doing desk work for hours, it was already nearly 6 in the evening and almost everyone had cleared out and gone home. The pair was used to working outrageously long hours, but it's not like either of them had anywhere else to go. They were going over the details of the Goyle case, attempting to find similarities between them and the Malfoy raid. The only aspects they had in common was a death eater mark left on the floor of all the targeted homes. There was no way to know how many people were in this organization and just how serious of a threat it is to anyone who was a death eater but has since retired that title. Harry had trouble finding sympathy for these individuals sometimes, after all, they had at one point aligned with Voldemort’s ideals, and something like that isn’t easily let go of. Nevertheless, Harry tried to put his own biases aside and protect the potential targets of this organization.
“Woah, you should know better than to apparate while drunk dipshit. Let’s go, we’re walking.” Aaron said as he snatched Draco’s wand from his hand, shoving it into his pocket. Draco grunted in disagreement but knew it was wiser.
“Hello Potter, long time no see.” Draco said cooly, while simultaneously interlinking his hand with Aarons, receiving a perplexed look from Aaron and a glance down at the intertwined hands from Potter. He wasn’t sure why this was his first instinct but he continued.
“Just go home, Potter” Draco sighed, beginning to close the door before Harry caught his foot at the bottom.
“Just pasta in some white wine sauce, it's not the craziest meal but I think it's pretty good.”
“Oh shut up, I was not starstruck. It was just weird to see him after so long, I was caught off guard, besides after all of the news about him in The Daily Prophet saying he had come out and broken it off with that Weasley girl, it was still a surprise to see him at a gay muggle bar” Draco explained, picturing the image of Harry laughing effortlessly at the bar in his head.
Their hips pressed together, the tension in his pants already growing tighter from just the slightest of touch. His mouth opened in a moan and was met by Harry’s tongue slipping in and swallowing him.
It was on the brink of summer, and the hot stuffy air was emanating into the bistro, not even the blasting air conditioning having the ability to cool off his body. He decided to blame the sweat in his palms to the weather. He ordered an iced tea from the waitress, bouncing his foot up and down while analyzing the salt and pepper shakers on the table for entertainment.
It had gotten late in the evening by the time Draco had unpacked but he still felt no urge to fall asleep. He walked over into the washroom, careful to be quiet as most of the lights were off and he assumed Harry was asleep. After getting ready for bed, he laid awake for seemingly hours. Annoyed by his insomnia rising up again, at a time when it was most inconvenient. When Draco was younger, his mom would make him chamomile tea with honey to help him fall asleep, he was sure it was just a placebo at this point as it brought back comforting memories of his youth. He wrestled with the idea of going into the kitchen and brewing himself a cup of tea, he figured Harry had been asleep for long enough to not be awakened by a kettle. He rose from the bed, wearing his silk pyjamas that he had bought himself as a Christmas present, realizing how pretentious they must have looked. He tip-toed into the kitchen, startled by the light already being on. Harry was sitting at the kitchen table, looking over what seemed to be work files, dressed in plaid red pyjama bottoms with a Gryffindor crest on the pocket, and with no shirt on. Draco tried desperately not to stare.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’ve just been doing a lot of thinking and I just realized that I can’t live like this.” He spoke, a tear falling down his cheek.
He felt someone run their hands across his body, he placed his hands on their chest, around their shoulders, through their hair, on their face.
He hailed a taxi home, unloading the grocery bags onto the porch as he got dropped off. He barely spoke Italian, so the communication aspect of the drive was quite awkward, he could tell that the older Italian man was irritated by his English tendencies.
“I’m gonna need you to change out of that god awful bathrobe today Malfoy” Harry said with a smirk. A blush rose to Draco’s cheeks, he hoped what Harry was saying was only an accidental innuendo.
I’m here for you, dumbass Harry thought.
“Ok… what’s your question?” he replies, bringing his attention back to the pan in front of him. He looks hot when he cooks, Draco thought.
“Harry, darling it's no bother,” Casper said, his lips threatening a laugh, “I was just leaving”
“I had one today, as you may have guessed” Draco mumbled as he used his hand to show off his unlike him attire.
Who do you guys like more? Harry or Aaron?
Draco met Harry’s face and placed a kiss on his lips, his mouth already open and desperate to get to the bedroom.
They pulled apart, both clearly eager to get out of an alleyway and to somewhere with a bed and heating.
Draco had a feeling he knew what was coming.
“Romilda! I wasn’t expecting you until later!” Cadmus chattered, clearly afraid of the women.
By the time Harry got home, Draco had been a bottle of scotch deep into his self medicating journey. Although he quickly found that the alcohol was doing little to no good to lessening his emotions, he continued to drink just for the disoriented feeling it provided him with, making him feel that maybe he wasn’t real and this wasn’t happening.
“Alrightttt there, let’s get you to the couch, okay?” Harry led Draco carefully to the couch, careful to maintain the distance between them. Draco shut his eyes and flopped down. Harry took a seat across from him, crossing his legs. He was on his fourth glass of scotch, his face was feeling warm and he could feel his inhibitions falter.
“A month?! I have to spend an entire MONTH living with that ungrateful little-” Marvin stared into Harry, commanding him not to finish the end of the sentence as a few aurors were still making their way out of the meeting.
He was now significantly drunk, having had nothing to eat since dinner and having consumed a little over half of the scotch bottle in only 20 minutes. But it was cold out and he knew that he wasn’t feeling the full extent of his inebriation, still being able to think clearly and not swaying too severely.
The snow wrinkled underneath his feet as he stepped up closer to Harry, who when realizing it was him, stood up abruptly to his feet.
They all sat down at the table, enjoying their dinner and chatting amongst themselves. They sat at a table with a couple of auror’s that Oliver worked with, and alchemists that Draco knew from working with them briefly. Draco had a couple more glasses of scotch, doing shots of tequila with Marie at one point, after which she begged Oliver to try and take a shot from her belly button. Noah and Aurora made their way over to their table eventually, this was by the time Draco was already slightly intoxicated so he was more than vocal about his joy for their marriage. Yelling out how the two were made for each other and grabbing both of them into a buddy hug. A move that he regretted almost immediately after getting a scent of Noah’s cologne and pushing them away quickly. He turned away from the table, unwilling to make jokes and laugh around with them anymore, and walked over to the bar. He ordered another glass of scotch, stumbling into the bar stool as he waited.
The morning chill was getting under Harry’s clothes, biting at his skin and leaving him shivering. It was early evening, the sun was just setting over the townhouses in a small suburban area of England, Casper and Harry were forced to make themselves scarce in between the alleys, careful as to not have anyone see them. There was supposed to be a raid later on in the evening, ex death eaters gathering to gain revenge on another disloyal wizard, the problem was, they didn’t know how many would show up, they were hoping that they wouldn’t be outnumbered. They had arrived earlier in the day in order to evacuate the pureblood and his family, escorting them back to the ministry and returning to the town once again. The day had been long and draining on Harry’s body, his muscles carrying a dull ache that pointed attention to itself whenever he moved. Although he was used to working long hours, it was mainly from paperwork, rarely did they have to spend the whole day on the field.
“Goodbye, Harry. It was good to see you again.” Draco simply stated, leaning down to Harry and placing a soft kiss on his cheek that spent a spark through his body.
“Alright, that’s better. Now follow me.” Harry walked up down that hall and into the main square of the Ministry, walking towards the green domed portals in the entryway. He steps under the cylindrical shape, and grabs onto Malfoy’s hand. The strangeness of physical contact with Harry catches Malfoy off guard. Luckily, he had no time to process this feeling as they apparate to the front door of Harry’s apartment.
“I don’t know. Being vulnerable, I guess.”
Draco marked his spot on the page with a bookmark and set it aside, taking a second to ponder the question.
“Where the hell are you going?” The man exclaimed, Draco ignored him and continued walking. His eyes wandered quickly against all the seats of the bar looking for the familiar head of brown hair, and surely enough, there he was. The man he spent his entire adolescence hating.
“Do you regret coming? I know it must have been weird with all the people from school.” Harry slurred, he was now significantly more drunk than he was earlier on the balcony, his inhibitions seemingly down.
Not to mention, Aaron, his best friend of nearly 4 or 5 years now, had quickly abandoned his side because of his emotional unavailability, he knew that Aaron was probably the more sensible choice; he was calm, mature, and knew the ins and outs of Draco’s brain. But for some reason, all of that was not enough, not when Harry could walk into a room and Draco would fall on his knees to beg for his love if that would change anything. He could barely recognize himself in a mirror anymore, he was so love stricken that that was all he saw, not the confident and cocky Draco he once knew, but a more desperate, pathetic version of him.
“I suppose not” Harry said, chewing his own mouthful.
“Alright Draco, here’s what's going to happen, considering that you can’t go back to your apartment during an active investigation, the Ministry is going to provide you with housing in the meantime. I’m not sure if it will be up to your standard of luxury, but it will have to do.”
The presence at his door caught him off guard, he had been so lost in thought that he hadn’t even realized Marie had walked in, standing as regal as ever with a slightly judgemental expression. She always had a way of knowing these things.
can call on Malfoy’s life debts for Harry? And Malfoy would basically be, what, a slave dedicated to save Harry?”
I will fucking kill them all.
In those times I wasn’t always able to take a shower, but I felt so dirty I would sometimes wash my hands until I bled. Still do sometimes.
The aftermaths of the war was… bad. So many deaths. So many funerals. So many regrets. So much
“Okay, that’s enough ‘Mione.” Ron cuts me in my ranting, starting to show anger. ‘Did Harry tell you we abandoned him?’
Stay safe everyone and thanks again for reading me!!
“No, he didn’t. But - ”
But I don’t remember how to cry.
do. The most urgent matter, right now, is finding out what I will tell my parents. If I am honest with myself, I feel quite relived to know I can’t tell them about the life bond. It would have distressed them, and in their state of minds I don’t know what they would have done. It’s better to keep them in the dark for the time being. But still, they will see that I have my wand back – and I still can’t believe I have it back! It’s such an amazing feeling! When I understood I had my wand I immediately cast a

, having a panic attack at the thought of having contact with the outside world. Malfoy would pay to see that. I’m sure he would have a good laugh.
I wouldn’t have had time to think if it had. I wouldn’t be stuck in my bed if it had. It would’ve been better to spend all summer in Hogwarts, with all those awful memories, than to be stuck in Grimmauld Place in August with another load of awful memories.
I spent most of August like this. Cleaning, fixing things in this hollow place. Hollow like me.
do I grab my glasses again? I think I need to open my eyes. Maybe they’re already open. I don’t even know that.
My family and myself came by a few… hardships after the war. We were incarcerated whilst waiting for our trials. Aurors went to the Manor and divested us of pretty much anything material. Or rather, what was left of it. The Death Eaters had happily helped themselves during their stay.
, concentrating on the shame I felt for showing so much weakness.
So, I cleaned the house and helped Mother choosing furniture. The house elves helped with some chores, but I wanted to be the one to clean. I wanted to see the stains vanish before my eyes. It wouldn’t have seemed real otherwise.
“Sorry we must have forgotten that part. We’ve got some other duties to do so just call us when you need us, Minister.” Said Fang almost happily. Happy to get off babysitting I was sure!  And I watched the both of them walking out of the room and closing the doors whilst the Minister was lazily waving at them, still looking at me. That reminded me to get a grip on myself. I tried to stand straighter and put the Malfoy mask back on, but I could definitely feel some cracks. I think one of my eyes was twitching with nerves.
I had to take a taxi to get to my parents’ house. I couldn’t apparate because I had never been there. The drive was long. So long. Australia’s so big. But I arrived at my parents’ place. It was a Sunday and I could see them in their garden. Laughing. Enjoying the sun with a glass of wine. So happy. Without me.
I’ve spent all of August in Grimmauld Place hiding from everyone. Mostly hiding from myself.
have been a little scared, but really, who wouldn’t? This situation was just… just… surreal. I still couldn’t fathom how, in their crazy minds, they could go from ‘Harry’s not well’ to ‘Draco Malfoy’s the answer to our problem’. Nothing made sense anymore. Gryffindors going to a Slytherin for help. Ahah. Maybe Potter wasn’t the only one in need of a mindhealer after all.
And they gathered I should be pulling my shit together too.
Enjoy!
I’m not thinking about it!
“Thank you, Diddy. Show them to the blue parlour and bring tea and scones, please.” Said my mother in a tight voice. Always so quick to recover, bless her.
The door creaks when I open it. The whole room is left in the dark. I didn’t bother to open the curtains. I don’t see anything, but after living in the dark for so long, I make my way easily to my bed.
I am aware how blessed I am – especially in a pureblood family – to have loving parents. And it unsettles me that Mother has felt the need to remind me so straightforwardly of their love. It infuriates me that
that comes first.
“Mr. Potter gave it to the Ministry as evidence for your trial. Since you are in need of it, it rightly goes back to you.” said Shackelbolt in a gentle tone.
“Welcome, Aurors. Please, take a seat so that we can talk about what have brought you here more comfortably.” My mother told them regally; always the proper hostess.
“We are actually seeking help from
“Hey ‘Mione, how did it go with Harry?” Ron asks, entering the room.
It’s not Narcissa and Draco who are everything.
“My pleasure, Mr. Malfoy. I believe you are free to go, now. Would you like me to call your Auror escort or do you prefer to leave alone? Now that you have your wand back, you can protect yourself well enough I would think.”
, especially in the first few chapters.
“I wasn’t aware I had a choice.” I turned to glare at the two Aurors standing by the doors. They both smiled unrepentantly.
And his eyes. And his voice. It’s like he’s dead inside. He doesn’t even have the will to fight for what he wants anymore. I only had to lay a little guilt on him for him to agree to go back to Hogwarts. He used to be so strong-willed before. Especially against Malfoy.

different things.
Angry at every one.
I owed it to those who stayed behind.
“Hum… sorry, Malfoy. You’re right, it’s too early to start over. I guess that since we needed your help, I thought we should all be on friendly terms. I was too eager and focused on helping Harry to really think about you. Let’s just try to be respectful to one another and we’ll see how it goes from here.” Said Granger with a shy smile.
A large, white, blinding ray of light came out of Weasley’s wand and the spell hit me square in the chest, knocking the breath out of me. I could feel it working inside me, changing me. White, hot pain suffused my chest, throat and neck. I fell on my knees, clutching my chest, my heart beating so fast I thought it would stop, exhausted to death. I started to scratch my neck and throat in a failed attempt to diminish the burning sensation surrounding me like a red-hot iron noose. I was choking on my screams, tears falling freely at last. My heart started to calm down without cause and my head started to pound until I thought it would explode. I bent down on the floor and started to hit my head on the hard surface until I couldn’t move. Someone had probably restrained me, but I couldn’t pay attention to my surroundings. All I could understand was the pain. My head felt like it was expanding, as if my brain would get too big for my skull. And then, suddenly, everything stopped. All that was left was the very physical pain I had inflicted on myself. I started to be aware of my surroundings once again and discovered that three pairs of hands were restraining me. I could feel a pull at the back of my head that was foreign. I knew I was different but didn’t want to know how just yet, so I took the time to close my eyes and just
“Thank you, Granger, but I don’t have any question. If that is all, I will go home now.” I said politely.
“We do not know much about the specifics of life bonds since we couldn’t find a lot of material about it. From what I’ve read, though, I’ve come to the conclusion that the bond is…
For the life of me I couldn’t stop the tears that started rolling on my cheeks at that moment. It started slowly and it just built up. I couldn’t stop weeping.
“Very well, then. Shall we? It’s unbecoming to make guests wait.” And she raised gracefully from her seat, extending me her hand. As I took it to stand, I could see my father had left his chair as well, donning the Malfoy mask. We would be confronting the Aurors as a united front.
I feel hollow now. It took me I had left in me to think seriously and speak this last sentence. It’s so difficult to make a choice. How did I do before, with so much responsibilities on my shoulders?
I feel dirty.
. “I have a few things to tell you. I’m quite famished, so if it’s alright with you, I’d as well tell you whilst lunching.” And, without waiting for an answer, I start walking towards the dining room. I hear them following me and, as we all take our seats around the huge dining table, the entrée is served. As I look at the small plate full of colours – red, orange and yellow fresh tomatoes, white mozzarella cheese, green basil leaves and dark balsamic vinegar – I realize I really am famished and start eating with gusto. After a few delicious mouthfuls, I pick up the conversation again. “I was summoned by the Minister to inform me of a change in my sentence.” I see both my parents bracing themselves for bad news. If it had only been my father, I would have left him time to imagine the worst things. But as I don’t wish to torture my mother, I quickly continue. “He wants me to go back to Hogwarts as a way to make amends. I’ve been given my wand back but it’s under strict restrictions. I’ll also have to stay under the supervision of Harry Potter and his friends.” I feel the overwhelming panic constrict my stomach once again and, suddenly, I can’t bear the thought of eating anymore. I take a deep breath to collect myself and delicately put down the cutlery. I take a look at my parents and see that both of them are sporting shocked expressions.
I thought they were bad before.
help. And this… this smelled of desperation. And it was so overwhelming that all the tension I had been feeling left me. I went against my upbringing and slumped in my seat. I was left tired, and definitely scared to know that the strongest people I knew couldn’t solve their problem and needed my help. But I couldn’t help them. First of all, I wasn’t in any way capable of helping anyone considering my state of mind. Second, I am not brave. And I would’ve needed a lot of courage to help the Saviour. With my mind made up, I started to speak again, rising from my seat.

thought we could start over. All is not forgotten or forgiven so short after the war but I’m –
“Lead the way, Lucius, darling.” Ordered my mother, taking my arm in hers.
I’ve got panic attacks now. Wonderful.
The adults at my school would see me and look somewhere else.
“First, let me introduce my colleague, Auror Fang, and myself, Auror Brownon. We were sent to escort Mr. Draco Malfoy to the Ministry. But, do not worry, young man, you are not in any kind of trouble. It appears that an important matter has arisen and Minister Shackelbolt is in need of your services. We are not privy of whatever the matter is, though.”
“Would you be so kind as to explain to us what exactly entails this babysitting job?” enquired my mother calmly. But I could see through her mask she was amused. Amused! I knew if she hadn’t been in front of guests she would’ve smiled! Laughed maybe! It was really hard for me to keep from showing the disgruntlement from my face. After the war it was becoming harder and harder for me to avoid my emotions and it showed.
It’s the family
I’m depressed.
“Thank you.” I said, once again, not knowing what else to say.
“As you wish, Mr. Malfoy. Let’s take our seats and go over the details of your duties, then.” Shackelbolt, at last, said with a smile. We all went back to our previous seats, my limbs moving mechanically.
sure if we can try to understand each other, everything will be better. Wars happen when people are afraid of the unknown, so it’s our duty to do everything in our power to not make the same mistakes than our predecessors!” she was a little breathless after talking so much without taking a breath. Her eyes were shinning, and I could see she was really believing in her naïve ideas. Well, it was not my place to destroy her illusions. My brain wasn’t working anyway. I was just trying not to laugh each time she was saying I and, afterwards, correcting herself with we; as if the Weasel agreed with her. And I only sat there, brain gone and all, sending wary glances her way – because I could feel this was just the beginning of some sort of impending doom – and finally locking eyes with Weasley, who looked so defeated and
“I need rest Hermione. I think it would be a good idea for me to take a sabbatical.”
Since
“What do you mean?”
When I think about all those people who died… I'm ashamed to wish to join them.
Well, come off your high horses Hermione! I’m not your kid!
?! Is she fucking kidding me? Never!
Here was not my place. I shouldn’t be admitted in the Minister’s office as if I was a helpful acquaintance. I shouldn’t be in the same room as Granger and Weasley exchanging pleasantries, and glances, and making amends. Using first names. Only a few months prior, Granger was tortured in my home.
Aurors. On our door-step. Dread. Fear. I felt my blood leaving my face. My whole body became cold and it took everything in me to keep me from trembling.
So everyone is pestering me nowadays. I know they’re worrying about me now that they’ve started to live again but I can’t handle it. I can’t be bothered to talk. To feel. To think.
“Don’t act all high and mighty just because this is the first time you haven’t run to a bottle of liquor after a minor inconvenience.” Harry spat, regretting the words as soon as they came out but too drunk to take them back.
Harry simply nodded in agreement, not wanting to talk about the situation any longer. They needed to get started on the preparations for tomorrow.
“Merlin, Potter. You had me scared shitless, hell are you doing pestering at my door at this hour?” He then caught a whiff of his scent, “And bloody plastered at that?” Draco said, his shoulders relaxing.
Perhaps it was the atmosphere of the home or their exhaustion from their day long travel to get there, but they both hit the pillow in the bedroom and didn’t wake until the next morning.
“I’m glad you came.”
“Don’t worry I know.” Draco laughed, “Yeah, I am actually. You remember Aaron?” Harry’s jaw dropped open.
“Oh. Right.” The air got awkward.
Draco showered for the first time that week, washing off the grime and heartache he had experienced. It felt nice to have a reason to go out, distract him from the realities of his life. As the water continued to drip down his back, he relaxed further. Once he stepped out of the shower he combed through his hair, styling it, the familiar feeling lifted his mood up. Getting dressed was also helping, the little things he did to take care of himself always left him feeling better, despite this, they felt nearly impossible to do sometimes. He wore black leather pants and a loose button up that showed off his collar bones, adding on a few rings to complete the outfit.
“Yes Draco, thank you for being so cooperative. I know this was less than ideal.”
“Potter? That’s a weird last name, never hear it.” Called out a voice from a few feet away.
“No” Harry sighed in relief.
Ron was nearly asleep, his head leaning over Hermione’s shoulder as she rubbed his hand.
As he was checking out, he grabbed a few bottles of wine and two bottles of whiskey, knowing that with Draco and Ron’s drinking habits combined, he might even have to return for more before New Year’s. He picked up a small book that seemed rather plain in nature, but figured it would help to fill the space in between events over the week. The clerk eyed him suspiciously, probably wondering why he needed 7 bottles of alcohol at the crack of dawn, he laughed when he imagined what their perception of him must have been.
And so Harry did. Down to the details of his reckless nonchalant attitude towards something that was actually important to him.
“You guys know me, I just wanna focus on my work and maybe fuck a bloke here and there when the feeling arises” Draco joked, half of him being serious and the other half wanting to make himself seem aloof so Noah wouldn’t somehow see right through his cool exterior.
“Sorry, I’m just heading out now, I won’t bother you guys.” He called out, making his way to the front door. Feelings of embarrassment all of a sudden rose in Draco, he was kicking Potter out of his own apartment to host friends. If his mother had ever known about this, she would never let him hear the end of it, going on about how disrespectful and ill mannered his behaviour was.
“Just some spaghetti with a meat sauce, cooking is therapeutic for me, helps me calm down.” Harry caught his breath after laughing, startled at his own ability to feel almost at peace near Draco.
“Do you happen to have chamomile?” he asked, startling Harry who looked at him with wide eyes as his body tensed up in defence. His muscles relaxed as he processed it was just Draco.
As he was approaching the crust on his stale and cold pizza, the front door sprang open, Harry’s voice booming Draco’s name through the halls. Draco sighed and laid his head into his hands, hoping if he was quiet enough Harry would stop yelling.
Their hands went back to their own sides as they exited the car, Draco handing him some muggle money and closing the door behind him.
“Took you long enough, always keeping me waiting, huh?” Draco replied, his tone cool and nonchalant.
“I don’t know what else I would possibly do. Guess that's the problem really.” Draco met Potter’s gaze as it was coming up from staring at Draco. His eyes were darker green than he remembered, and they had a sad aging to them, he was sure that whatever Potter had to deal with since Hogwarts was not healthy for him. He stepped an inch closer to him, leaning his face slightly in. Harry glanced down at his lips and back up, staring further until clearing his throat and backing away.
Harry walked over and rested a hand on Draco’s shoulder, which Draco was wildly aware of now.
“Harry?” It still felt odd calling him by his first name, he was so used to the poison laced Potter that he had hung onto in school that this felt wildly intimate.
“Understandable. Nasty habit.” Harry said, raising his glass with a smirk before taking a sip.
Over the years, Draco had made sure that every apartment that he has lived in included an office of some sort, on the days that day drinking wasn’t socially acceptable or it was too early to go and pick up a man at a bar, he needed some other sort of distraction. For him, it had always been his work, and it was effective, except for on the days when his brain was cloudy and felt like it was filled to the brim with his own thoughts. Unfortunately for Draco, this just happened to be one of those days, he didn’t even have the energy to get dressed later in the day or make himself breakfast. He crawled back into bed, knowing that sleep wasn’t an option, but needing the comfort of a soft atmosphere. Whenever these emotional episodes hit, Draco was a mess of a person. They often lasted for days on end, but in this case, it wasn’t an option. He still had until 4pm though so he took full advantage of the staring at the ceiling slump he was in. Hoping that if he lay there long enough, his heart would release and he would feel a weight fall off his shoulders. This moment never came. It was nearly 7 hours later and Draco was still in bed, feeling emotionally drained and unprepared for whatever he had planned for tonight. He regretted accepting the invitation, thinking of any possible way he could excuse himself and stay in a slump for the rest of the day. Yet, he knew that this was something that was unavoidable, if he didn’t go to the wedding he would still have to face Noah and Aurora at some point, and it would be painful all the same.
“Look, why don’t we talk about this tomorrow. I’m exhausted.” Draco stated, pushing his way past Harry and towards the door. He felt his elbow being snagged back.
“Shouldn’t you have a glass of water instead?”

They hadn’t touched each other at all, and even through that small connection, a flood of memories came back to him, how desperately his body was pulled towards his.
“Oh come on, I only have them when I’m plastered. It doesn’t count” Draco said, reaching over Harry’s body and grabbing another.
“Wow. That is definitely the one. Thank God, I thought we were going to be here forever” Aaron said as he came closer to admire the finer details of the clothing.
The house itself was beautiful in every meaning of the word, there was dark green ivy scurrying up the old weathered stone of the home. The porch, accompanied with dark brown window frames, had a light auburn wicker dining set that, among the plethora of outdoor plants, blended into the stone. The building was picturesque and he thanked himself for letting Hermione find the house, he was sure if he had they would have ended up with an old and broken down brick house that he would have played off as ‘rustic’.
Harry nodded a solemn thank you, their shoulders brushing against each other as they headed towards the kitchen table. The dark auburn coloured wood of the table drastically contrasted against Draco’s pale skin as he sat down, hugging his hands around the mug in front of him, the warm ceramic of the cup warming his fingers.
Harry gathered his thoughts, knowing his anger was only coming from a place of assumed rejection.
It was now Christmas morning and the warm morning light was casting soft shadows over Harry’s face, Draco taking notice of this and staring longingly, relaxing in solitude in the moments before the brunette was going to wake. Draco thought about Harry’s gift in his bag, they had decided against getting each other anything big or too expensive, not wanting to place that pressure on their new (Draco couldn’t quite bring himself to say relationship due to Harry’s difficulty to commit) whatever it was, and opted for small trinkets that they thought the other would enjoy.
They chatted about their childhoods, which left a little awkward tensions, so they moved onto their jobs. It turned out that Ron was far more invested in his auror work than Harry or Draco had ever been, he was truly involved and excited about the work he was doing. This left Draco, who hated every second of auror training, to have a spark of inspiration about the occupation.
“I was trying to run away from a lad that got a little too handsy at the pub, and the first place I thought of when apparating was your place. Of course, I wasn’t planning on going in, but after a bottle of scotch and seeing you on your balcony, it was hard to resist the need.”
“I can’t say that I don’t love this view,” Draco began, “But it is a little compromising when I’m trying to focus on reading.”
Harry looked over and giggled at Draco’s stumbling.
The two of them began their walk, stopping by random shops to kill time, it's not like they were in any rush. They walked past one in particular, one that reminded him of when he would shop in Diagon Alley before every school year as a kid, they had books and random scratchy sweaters and the new Nimbus broom. He looked in awe as he realized just how much more developed the brooms had gotten since the last time he had rode one. He didn’t realize until then just how much he had missed flying, it was one of the things that allowed him to forget his problems as a kid and gave him a sense of freedom. A feeling he was desperately craving for at the moment. He looked at the price tag and thought otherwise, Draco was well off but still could not justify spending that amount of money on a broom when he lived in London and rarely played Quidditch. Regardless, he stared at the beauty with doe eyes before turning around and continuing their walk home. Aaron had noticed him staring but chose not to say anything, Draco was glad, he was tired of talking.
He rested him down on the couch, taking the bottle from his hand and placing it on the coffee table.
“You’re twisting my words Potter. All I said was that I wanted so desperately for you to like me that when you blatantly rejected my ass, I was a little hurt to say the least. And so to suppress the years of slight obsession with the Boy Who Lived, I tormented you instead. Made perfect sense to me.” Draco explained, taking an enormous bite out of his waffles as he watched Harry try to wrap his head around the concept.
“What?”
“Please, Draco.”
Sorry it took me so long to release this chapter, I was having a little bit of a mental block. Let me know what you thought and would you guys want chapters from Harrys pov?
“What are you doing?” Harry questioned, feeling strange by the unfamiliar pressure that Draco’s body brought.
Draco should have known that they would have been there, they had been the initial agents to be given this case, it would only make sense for them to come to the meeting. Draco simply rolled his eyes and walked into the office. He had gotten more crude and harsh with Harry again, he could have dealt with the rejection, but the blatant avoidance had gotten under his skin. If Harry wanted for them to go back to being strangers, then that's exactly what Draco was going to do.

“Malfoy! Some of us have to shower too, you know?” He heard Harry from outside the washroom, his voice huskier in the morning, sending Draco over the edge, his dick twitching as he came in his hand, holding onto the shower wall for support. Fuck. He muttered underneath his breath.
There will be smut at the beginning of the next chapter dw ;))
“Say hi to your new fucking roomie.” Potter spat in Malfoy’s face, shoving past him and storming off down the hall.
“Enough.” Draco warned again, “You’re acting like a fucking drunken idiot.”
Placing the plates down onto the table, Draco flinched as he sat down on the chair, his ass feeling slightly bruised from his adventures from the night before. This caused a questioning look to form on Harry’s face, before one of realization, followed by a slight laugh.
He glanced into Harry’s eyes and smiled, unable to believe that the man he spent his childhood pining over is standing in front of him.
As I’m writing this, it is pouring rain and gorgeous outside. The soft pitter of the droplets encasing my room. I hope you’ll forgive me for the week or so wait in between updates.
Nick took his fingers out, grabbing Draco by the hips and flipping him onto his stomach, his ass up in the air. Draco gripped onto the sheets of the bed as he felt the tip of Nick's dick line up with his ass, groaning at even the slightest pressure as he felt the length of the dick enter further into him. Nick pushed his hips forward, Draco letting out a loud moan, his eyes filling with tears as he felt the cock fill up his stomach. The strokes started off slow, allowing Draco to get used to the sensation and the size, becoming faster and pounding deeper into him, his head thrown back in pleasure, his body glazed with a thin layer of sweat as his walls tightened around Nick. A hand pushed his face down into the sheets, holding his hips as he continued to graze over his prostate, causing Draco’s knuckles to turn white as he gripped the bed, profanities slipping out of his mouth. He felt a pang on his ass, his skin slightly red from the slap, the mixture of pain and pleasure was always something that got Draco closer to the edge.
these boys are a messss
“Can I talk to you?” Harry asked.
“Well, now that we have got your jealousy sorted out, can we please continue our date?” Draco said slyly, his lips up turning into a smirk.
He was desperate to escape his present situation, eager to lose himself in a mixture of alcohol and dancing bodies. He forced himself into the crowd, his limbs heavy. The music was blasting and the flashing lights were distorting his vision as he threw his head back and ran his hands down his body, feeling the euphoria of being just another person at the party. Not Harry Potter, not the guy who had hurt the only man he’d ever truly loved, and certainly not the one that continued to fuck up anything good that came his way.
“Good thing we always have today.” He responded. Pushing his face into Harry’s and colliding their lips together. He could taste the sweet aftertaste of brunch and orange juice in his mouth, his tongue exploring the other man's mouth.
Later, when the two of them were chopping vegetables, the only sounds around them being the soft melodic harmony of classical music that Draco had put on and the rhythmic slicing of knives, he felt the difference in their relationship again. It was almost as if the months that they had been friends had been washed away and they were back to the uncomfortable silence that begged for conversation.
“Fuck. I don’t know, Casper.” Harry said, unable to fully commit to the idea of telling Draco how he felt.
Harry leaned his forehead against Draco’s, feeling his soft skin on his. He pushed his chin upward, connecting their lips. There was no response.
The warmth was radiating off of Harry’s skin and onto Draco’s, encasing him in a blanket of protection against the world.
The first time that Harry had seen Draco since Hogwarts was at that very pub, a semi-awkward affair as he wasn’t aware that Draco was gay, and as far as he knew, Draco didn’t know Harry was either.
However, there was a part of it that was still bothering Harry. Draco had attempted to slide into a conversation of what they were, and Harry had found himself unable to answer in any tangible way nearly every time. Either brushing off the topic to a later date, claiming they ‘still had time to figure it out’ or simply freezing in the moment, which left Draco sitting in silence for several minutes as Harry used filler words to glide around the conversation.
“Harry, Ron and I were going to grab a late dinner, care to join?” Although the three of them didn’t see each other nearly as often as they’d like, they all tried to get together at any chance possible. Harry agreed, wrapping up the file he was looking at. Casper stayed, telling Harry that he would only stay for another half hour or so, Harry knew that that was a lie, they never left work earlier than 8pm.
Harry dropped his keys on the shelf by the front door, the metal clattering and echoing through the hall. Maybe he thought he was home alone as a sigh of relief left his mouth when he saw all of the lights dim in the apartment. But the relaxed facade quickly faded when he walked into the living room to be greeted by Draco’s slumped over body on the couch.
The day of New Years Eve had come quicker than any of them expected, all of them scurrying around the house and various stores to get all of the things needed for the night. Hermione had forced Ron to wait in the hour-long line to get to the liquor store on his own, claiming that he drank the majority of it anyway and it was only fair. She was in charge of all of the grocery shopping so her own day was filled to the brim chaotically. Draco and Harry were simply put in charge of all of the cooking, as well as light decorating, including cheesy plastic NYE hats that welcomed the new year.
The momentum pulled Harry in more than Draco had anticipated, their bodies now only a few inches apart. He felt heat radiate off of his own chest, his breath hitched in his throat at the proximity of this man that he was desperately trying to keep at a safe distance. Harry was first to step away, as expected, and walked over to the kitchen to prepare ingredients for dinner.
Sometimes, Draco would rest his hand atop of Harry’s, just for a few seconds, playing it off as a friendly embrace while they laughed. They would have lingering moments like these that always ended too soon, both of them aware of the deeper meaning behind these touches, but neither of them willing to acknowledge it. Draco would stay up thinking about his feelings towards Harry. They weren’t solely romantic or sexual, their bond felt like one that transcended the earthly senses. He would never be able to understand it and would go to bed frustrated at the thought. He liked to think that Harry was in bed attempting to make sense of their relationship himself, that they had a bond that stayed with them even when they were apart.
“Alright, you make a decent point. Still, you never woke me up at three in the morning and made me put you to bed now did you?” Harry said, a blush falling over his cheeks.
“Do you want to fuck or not?” he exclaimed, the irritation thick in his voice. The man quickly rose and began following Draco to the outside of the pub.
“You’re sorry? That doesn’t mean anything to me. It doesn’t change the fact that while I was trying to figure out how to fix this, you were literally fucking someone else.” Draco scoffed, “I don’t know what I expected. I don’t know how I ever thought that we could possibly make this work. I should have known that you would never be able to care about anyone other than yourself! For fucks sake, Harry, you couldn’t even say we were dating! You brought me to fucking Italy before you were able to admit you were my boyfriend.” It was all beginning to click into place for Draco, he had never been Harry’s, and Harry had never been his.
“What do you say we take the day off of work, I’m sure I can make something up to Greg about how my aunt died and I need you there for emotional support or something. We can grab a pint, talk about this Noah bastard of yours?” Aaron asked with a warm smile. Draco nodded, grateful he didn’t have to actually use his brain to do work today.
The rush of bodies welcomed Draco back into the dance floor as he left Harry and Aaron behind, avoiding any conversation with Potter. He grabbed onto the shoulders of the first attractive man he saw and began to dance with him. His arms wrapping around the neck of the taller man as he swayed his hips side to side. Draco turned around, grinding his ass into the other man, forming circles and feeling large hands grip onto his hips. He opened his mouth in false ecstasy, his eyes slightly aflutter to see Harry staring with his mouth slightly agape. Draco wasn’t sure what he was doing, but whoever he was dancing with knew how to move against Draco and he wasn’t complaining. He turned back around, his eyes breaking the contact with Harry’s and kissed the man standing in front of him. His tongue sliding against his lower lip for entry, each forcing hungrily into the other. Their bodies pressing together as Draco felt hands sliding down his back and side. The man broke from the kiss, his mouth hovering over Draco’s ear.
“Aurora! What a pleasant surprise!” bringing her into a loose half hearted hug.
“I’m sure..” Harry said, laughing at the blonde’s untimely attempt at hiding.
Until finally, he felt his mouth connecting with theirs, he felt his mouth open up and a tongue slip in, he felt their hands tugging at his hair, and their hips grinding against his. They pressed him up against a wall in a hallway tucked away at the back of the club, their lips trailing down Harry’s neck, sucking on the spot behind his ear. Their hands wandered down towards his dick, now half hard in his pants.
“I don’t think your actions as a child define you, Draco.”
Harry groaned in rebuttal, his shoulders slumping down like a childs. Draco giggled at his immature behaviour.
Harry had to explain to her what happened when she arrived, and she was furious with Harry’s lack of communication skills, cursing him out for not being more honest with the man he claimed to care so much about. She was, like always, correct. This brought up a mixture of feelings for Harry, not only the feelings of guilt but he also couldn’t help but feel that Draco was slightly over reacting.
They weren’t going to be alone for the whole time either, Ron and Hermione were to make their way over for New Year’s eve, yet he was still questioning what it meant for him to invite Draco for a cross country vacation, but not be able to admit that he was his boyfriend. It was all very confusing.
The conversation ceased at that. Not that it was awkward, there was just nothing more to say.
I'm so sorry for this one ://
“Care for shots you two?” Harry asked with a mischievous smile, offering them both shots of Firewhiskey.
“You obviously fancy the bloke and all this back and forth will only push him further away. What I suggest you do is to stop fucking around and tell him how you feel. People don’t stick around forever at the beck and call of Harry Potter, you know.” Casper replied, his face disappointed in Harry’s blindness to his own emotions.
“How have you been?” Aaron asked eagerly.
All my love <3
If it was any other night, Draco would have told Potter to go fuck himself, he didn’t know if it was because of the alcohol or because he was feeling lonely, but he wanted to confide in him.
“Alright, well, a couple of ground rules then. I usually end up leaving for work pretty early in the morning, and get back typically after dinner, so you can do whatever during the day, just clean up if you’re going to make a mess. I rarely have any groceries so if you want anything extra that’s on you to go and buy. Also, I would prefer it if there weren’t any strange women, or - uh, men, in the apartment, if you’re gonna go out, just go to their place.” Draco was slightly offended that Harry thought he was going to be bringing men home left and right, but I guess keeping in mind how their first recent encounter went, it wasn’t that surprising.
Harry apologized, “What’re you making? I wouldn’t have taken you for one that would be into cooking”
Draco grabbed the last of his things, his eyes hot and brain numb, he picked up his suitcase and apparated to the portkey to England, not facing Harry as he did.
“You are a proper asshole sometimes, you know that?” Casper said, his face showing half amusement and half disappointment.
“Sure… why the sudden eagerness? You hate clubs.” Draco questioned, genuinely curious.
“It’s a mess really. Basically we started fucking every couple of months when drunk. You know, he’s the whole “thinks he's straight but will only hook up with guys” type of person. He was dating Aurora still, but I caught feelings and then they got married and we stopped fucking. Really not that big of a deal.” He sighed as he realized how stupid he felt saying it all out loud. Noah was clearly a prick, and Draco was many things but he wasn’t the type of guy to let someone walk all over him.
Harry stared back at Draco for a few seconds, unsure of what to say.
“How about shots instead?” Draco insisted, trying desperately to drunken himself up so he wouldn’t have to remember tonight. The man agreed and waved his hand to the bartender. Draco looked around the bar and admired the simplicity of it. He had chosen a muggle bar specifically for the anonymity, he wasn’t exactly famous but many people in the wizarding world knew of the Malfoy name, and the last thing he needed was a call from his father asking him why he was published in the The Daily Prophet doing some rather unspeakable things to another man.
“I don’t think so, we’ve just become friends of sorts” he replied. He wasn’t even sure if they were, they floated in this in between, a mixture of friendship and past rivalry.
“That’s no way to greet us, Harry” she said while wrapping her arms around him. He murmured an apology as Ron laughed at his appearance.
Months have passed on this exact balcony. Months of heartache and joy, and probably hundreds of smokes.
“You know about what.”
“I doubt you could do much better, used to house elves making the perfect breakfast for you, eh Malfoy?” Harry spat annoyingly from across the kitchen. Draco walked up to behind Harry.
As far as he knew, Harry wasn’t one for sharing intimate details about his feelings. Draco had been - ironically - the most open out of the two of them, drunkenly confessing about his life since the beginning of them living together. So to see this more vulnerable side of him, was something that Draco was dying to see again. He loved how open he was able to be, despite his obvious inebriation and lack of a filter at the time.
“So now you speak to me?” Harry said, “is this what I have to do to get your attentionnn?” he slurred.
They walked into the apartment, the familiar smell of Harry’s sandalwood cologne slightly fragrant in the air. He’s only been gone for less than 24 hours, this morning being the first he spent at his apartment and he’s already back, it feels more like home than anywhere he’s ever been.
Although he had avoided his parents, he had never meant to make his mother feel like he had any vendetta against her, she was a bright presence in his generally morbid life but his fathers occupancy had left his mental health in shambles. And unfortunately, he couldn’t cut off communication with one and not the other. So when he was met by her soft gaze once again, he nearly broke down in tears. He hadn’t realized how deeply he had missed his mother.
“Did you want to go out today? I mean we don’t have to if you weren’t interested like that but I just thought that - you know - we could just hang out and see where this goes? It’s really up to you though I understand if you’re not interested or-”
“And do what?”
“Last night he couldn’t even get a cup of tea without it being excruciatingly awkward. I can’t handle another month of this.” Harry sighed, putting his head into his hands.
“I think I cheated on you.”
He walked into the kitchen for a refill on his glass, Marie following him to do the same.
Draco had visited the Manor soon after Narcissa had gotten home from the infirmary, she had minimal injuries, his dad taking most of the torture. His mother was battered and clearly traumatized, barely speaking a word the majority of the time he was over.
“Merlin, you sure are dense sometimes Harry.”
Draco regretted his decision to come to the party almost immediately, especially once he saw the faces of his fellow Hogwarts graduates scattered around the room.
“I don’t know how many times I have to repeat myself.” Draco spoke, rolling his eyes slightly at the interrogation. He had gone to the ministry for their help thinking they would be more of use, rather than just being accusatory because of his past with death eaters.
“Um… sure. How have things been with the potions project you’ve been working on?” Draco questioned, confused by the sudden hostility.
“I just didn’t feel that way about him and ever since - well lets just say this was the first time he’s bothered to speak to me since that morning.”
Harry nodded his head slowly, his green eyes boring into Draco’s searching for correspondence.
And with that their lips were back together, colliding softly, more sure of themselves than before. Harry slipped his tongue into Draco’s, tasting the cigarette that he watched him smoke. He wanted nothing more than this, forever.
“Don’t. I know how it must have looked from the outside.” He placed a comforting hand onto his shoulder.
hii sorry about the later upload i had such a writing block. let me know what you guys think as always. also, would u guys want more smut scenes incorporated throughout the chapters?
“Marie? Can I stay at your place tonight?” He asked, his voice breaking for the first time that night, his chest feeling the full weight of what happened.
He watched as Draco glanced across the London skyline, as he rested his chin in the base of his hand, his slender fingers cupping his cheek. As he glanced at his watch to see the time, as he ran his fingers through his hair. Harry wished to see all of it, he would be okay just being a bystander in his life, watching from afar and admiring his beauty.
Draco sat up in the bed, trying to get to the shower but feeling his feet weighed down by bricks, feeling as if he was stuck in his own body unable to move. He sat in silence for a moment, getting up slowly, using his muscles for the first time in hours. He stayed in the shower for longer than necessary, letting the water hit his shoulders and run down his body, eyes closed and head leaning back. Once he finished, he had felt better. Draco knew that a shower was always beneficial in episodes like this but getting himself to actually go was brutally hard. He slowly began to get ready. Blow drying and putting product in his hair, shaving, and slowly starting to get dressed. He went to get his phone off his dresser, in the midst of his day, he had avoided going on his phone entirely, partly because of his physical inability to, but also because he didn’t want to talk to anyone. He opened his phone to several missed texts from Aaron, asking him if he was okay and if he wanted to talk. Although he appreciated the concern, at times like these, he felt that Aaron was overbearing, he didn’t want to talk and didn’t feel like being vulnerable at all really. He decided to leave his phone at home, not answering Aarons texts. He took a final look at himself in the mirror, surprised he was able to get himself so put together after a day of slumming in bed, and apparated to the venue.
He finally pushed his way out of the club, the cold and harsh winter air slapping his face as he stepped out. It was here, in the harsh reality of silence that he had realized what he had done.
Draco felt so alone. He had managed to destroy the relationships that guided him most in life in the past few days, now craving for the closeness he felt to them before a mess of feelings invaded. He felt an urge to confront Harry, his stomach churning in anticipation to speak.
He knew that this year would be significantly different from all of the other holiday seasons he’s enjoyed, yet there wasn’t a tinge of regret for his decision to spend it with Draco.
“I don’t think you’re understanding Harry. This isn’t up to your discretion. You will do as I say and Malfoy does not hear a word about this, you hear me? If Draco interferes with this case in any way, it’ll be your job on the line. I think it’s best you went home now.” Harry stared at Marvin in shock. He had very rarely spoken to Harry in that tone and although it was usually warranted, this time felt unnecessarily cruel. He decided to take Marvin’s advice and leave before he said anything he would regret. He slammed the door on his way out, all his previous anxiety turning into rage.
There was something so intoxicating about the beginning of an infatuation with someone that was incomparable to anything Draco has ever felt; the way his body responds naturally to whatever Harry does, as if he had been subconsciously hungry for the tenderness of his lips on his skin his whole life.
“Okay.” Harry responded, his eyes still in his glass.
(See the end of the chapter for
He wished for nothing more than to find feelings of romantic love in him to give to Aaron, to soothe his pain and keep him next to him forever; but with Harry sitting inches away from him now, he knew that the kiss he shared was pity driven, and no matter how desperately he tried to force it, his body still ignited at the mention of Harry, and it didn’t for Aaron.
Harry nodded his head slowly, tiny sobs escaping his mouth.
“Merlin, you have no idea.” Harry groaned, eager to dive into his work and pretend to forget about the events of the night before. He had promised himself he wouldn’t sleep with Draco for this precise reason, he always hurt the people that had been nothing but kind to him, especially when it comes to romantic encounters.
They lounged on the front porch of the house, bundled up in blankets and layers in order to stay warm while enjoying nature, switching between reading their respective books and chatting casually.
“Scared of what?” Draco replied with a bitter tone.
“That is not for you to decide Potter! I told you already, the Ministry is out of housing after the last raid! And with Malfoy being one of their clear targets, we can’t just have him running around the streets of London can we!” Marvin argued back. Who are they talking about? When he met with them earlier they acted as if they hadn’t had the faintest clue as to who could have targeted his apartment, and why. This was slowly becoming a living nightmare. He reached his hand up to knock on the door, it swinging open by Harry’s force. His face filled with rage, and the sight of Draco did not seem to help his situation.
He debated going to Aaron’s apartment, he had forgotten that he had completely ignored all his attempts at communication today, and felt he needed to apologize. But at the same time, he wasn’t in the mood to talk about his feelings about the wedding, or to have Aaron attempt to make him feel better. So he just continued walking. Taking swigs of his bottle periodically, aware of how it made him look to whoever happened to also be wandering the streets. If his dad saw him now he would be sure to never let him live it down. He would talk about how he should know better than to disgrace the Malfoy name by acting like a boozy bum, wandering off to God knows where. Draco was grateful his father was almost entirely out of his life, apart from an owl sent to him on his birthday and occasionally on Christmas - although Draco knew that they were written by his mother - he didn’t really talk to his parents. He preferred it that way, or at least he liked to think he did. Dealing with the two of them was always unbearably difficult as it made him feel as if he was constantly not living up to the expectations they had set for them, but now dating and fucking men too? It was far more than Lucius would be able to handle, and Draco didn’t want the extra arguments.
“Well, I’m sure he feels out of place, and an unwanted visitor at that. Why don’t you try making more conversation, maybe make him feel more comfortable?” Of course Casper would suggest that. Harry didn’t want to make Draco feel more comfortable, he didn’t even want him there in the first place.
“So which one was it? Did you fuck someone else or not?” Draco asked, wishing he hadn’t as soon as it escaped his lips. He was afraid he already knew the answer. As Harry nodded his head solemnly, Draco snatched his hand back from where Harry had been holding it, his heart racing.
“Look, Aaron. I’m sorry okay? It’s not like you’ve given me many ways to talk to you, ignoring me isn’t very mature either you know?” Draco said, his mind trying not to focus on the hurt on Harry’s face. He took his hand in his attempt of reassurance but Harry quickly pulled away.
They walked past the concierge and into the elevator, Draco pressing the button to their floor. The two of them stood closer together than necessary, barely taking up room in the space. Draco closed his eyes and the world around him spun, he could always tell that he was properly drunk whenever that happened.
“So, I know that I’ve been avoiding a lot of your questions. I don’t really have an explanation for that, I guess I was just scared? Sometimes I get scared about pretty irrational things but I promise it wasn’t because I don’t like you. Basically what I’m saying is that I’ve been avoiding one question in particular, and I wasn’t really sure about it even though I have been pretty relationship-y so far. I don’t know I guess seeing you tonight with my friends just changed my perspective and -”
“Taking action in what? Are you okay?” Draco asked, his eyebrows furrowing in concern.
Hearing the footsteps speed up behind him, he quickly turned into an empty alleyway, apparating to the first place he thought of.
He knew he shouldn’t victimize himself, he was the one that placed the distance between them in the first place. Despite telling himself that being just friends with Draco would be possible, he found himself unable to hold back from touching him, wanting to feel the blonde’s skin against his. This made it incredibly difficult to maintain any semblance of a platonic relationship in between them, so instead of facing his feelings, he withdrew from him completely. Choosing to do what he knew best; avoid.
Sweat began to form on his forehead and Draco took that as his cue to go back to the kitchen, feeling a need to drink more. He left Harry as he danced with Neville, and walked away from the group, grabbing the bottle of Firewhiskey off of the counter and pouring himself a glass.
“I don’t know, I guess I just wanted to say I’m sorry. I know I’ve been weird about you and Harry lately and I don’t really have an excuse. I just want you to know that I’m sorry.” Aaron had been rambling for some time now. Draco hadn’t heard much of it, but accepted his apology anyway. It must have looked in-genuine because of his vacant look, but he was honestly still trying to understand what he was apologizing for in the first place.
Draco poured the hot water over the chamomile tea bag, watching it sink to the floor of the mug. He needed honey, but the idea of asking Potter for more helped repelled him. He chose against it and scurried back to his room, breathing a sigh of relief as he closed the door behind him.
“I think they liked you” Draco spoke softly, placing his hand back at his side but maintaining the close distance in between them. Harry stared into his eyes, his expression soft and longing.
“A party at the Weasley’s? My favourite place.” Draco replied sarcastically, trying to force another attempt at getting past Harry but he was stronger than he looked.
“What do you mean? In this cottage?”
“So tell me, whatcha been up to since Hogwarts?” Draco was just looking to make conversation at this point, he didn’t want to go home.
“Yeah. Of course. You’re right. Just forget I said anything, I won’t tell her don’t worry.” Draco half smiled and began to reach for his wallet in his pocket. He couldn’t stand to look at Noah any more and wanted out of this suffocating room. He placed enough money down to cover the bill and began to stand up, feeling the tears beginning to brim his eyes, he was quick to turn around and put on his coat.
“Hello Draco! Happy Christmas to you.” Hermione said, a grin on her face. He only received a slight nod from Ron.
“Constantly being a bystander in my own life. Never taking any action.”
“That looks like a face of regret if I’ve ever seen one.” Casper said, his demeanor waiting for a response. After being partners for years, Harry’s emotions have become transparent to Casper, oftentimes he knew what Harry was feeling before he even did.
Harry, of course, tried to stop him, chasing him around the home and begging him to stay. As far as Draco saw it, they were over the second that Harry made the decision to kiss someone else.
The cold and blunt winter weather had made it difficult for them to enjoy a proper stroll outside, the wind nipping at their skin and leaving Draco whining to go back to either of their heated apartments.
The sky lit a blue haze over the city, the yellow ambiance of the street lights filling up the alleyways. He could see sparse lights on in apartment buildings, making him ponder how every person in each of those rooms lived their own lives, had their own troubles to face. He walked past a 24 hour convenience store, where he used to buy cheap liquor and get drunk with Oliver. He would tell him about his relationship with Marie and how he was sure that she was who he wanted to marry. Draco didn’t know how to empathize, he’d never met anyone he was sure he wanted to spend more than a few years with, let alone his entire life. He has had to be so painfully independent, not only through adulthood, but even as a child, that the picture of living co-dependently on someone else seemed overbearing. He walked into the store, the fluorescent lighting making his eyes squint, and a trace of a headache begin to form. He roamed through the rows, taking his time, it’s not like he had anywhere else to be. He picked out a small bottle of rum, as he felt his inebriation begin to fade off. The cashier eyed him curiously, Draco walked up to the cash register and placed down the bottle, putting money down on the counter.
“Alright, I think we’ve got everyone in the room, can we all quiet down please” Marvin spoke, his voice echoing through the room. All the hushed side conversations came to an end, and the full attention of the space was focused on Marvin.
He made a fair point so Draco just nodded in compliance. He pulled open the freezer and grabbed himself an ice lolly and began to unwrap it. The weather in London had reached such high temperatures in the last few days that not even the air conditioning in his apartment could save him from overheating. He shoved the lolly in his mouth catching the already melting contents with his tongue. He looked up at Aaron through his eyebrows to find him sitting with his mouth open, his eyes darting away once he realized Draco was looking.
“You either cheated on me, or you didn’t Harry. There's no I think.” Harry nodded his head once again, his eyes were red and swollen, his hand wiping his tears with the back of his palm.
You have been formally invited to the joining of:
“What?”
They were now in the city center and their drunk rambles hadn’t gotten any quieter, Ron had greatly settled after a few glares from Hermione but Harry was still stumbling in his steps and singing. Draco walked up to him and yanked his hand back.
The rest of the evening went relatively similarly, them chatting on the couch, him making her several cups of tea and pretending not to notice when her eyes teared up as he left the room. Eventually he had put her to bed and was now practically alone in the vast Manor.
“Oh shut up, Potter” Draco retorted, his cheeks slightly reddening.
“That’s not true!” Harry tried to reach for Draco’s arm, but it was flinched away. “I’m sorry! I didn’t know what to do, I was scared.” he cried.
“Alright, I’ll leave you to it then.” Harry said, walking back towards the direction of his room.
“This better be the best fucking excuse I’ve ever heard in my life” Draco laughed at this, whenever Aaron was really angry, he would curse like a trucker, something he otherwise never did.
Merlin, were Draco’s palms damp. He wiped them against his slacks, attempting to hide his body's anxiety. He pulled the door to the bistro open, greeting the waitress and taking the familiar table in the back corner of the restaurant. He poured himself a glass of water and glimpsed over the menu, more for appearances than anything, he had already memorized everything that they had.
He slapped his palm over his face in annoyance at his actions, he simply couldn’t have been any more awkward.
Boy, was he wrong.
“Well open it! I can’t stand this anticipation” Harry complained, jittering in his seat like a child. Draco complied, lifting himself off of the couch and walking over towards the present, he sat down on the floor, tucking his legs underneath himself as he inspected the gift. Harry’s wrapping skills were far from perfect, the corners crumpled up in awkward angles, creating a lumpy surface over the box.
The effect settled in not minutes after they walked inside, Draco’s muscles began to feel heavy and solid, his body feeling consumed by the couch. His eyes shifted around the room, his brain processing information just a split second later than his usual. They watched movies for the rest of the night, laughing at jokes he usually wouldn’t find funny. Draco felt effortlessly happy, besides random waves of anxiety he was feeling light, glancing over at Harry through heavy eyelids.
Harry slammed the door of his and Caspers office as they entered, letting out a frustrated groan as he sat back in his chair.
His night had gotten progressively worse and what he wanted to be a distraction from his feelings from Draco turned into him missing him even more than he did before.
“What’s wrong?” Harry asked, placing his back down in the kitchen and walking over to sit next to Draco. The proximity left him longing that he was back to 24 hours ago, when they were both drunk and careless.
“Addict.” Harry shook his head, chuckling.
“Can I talk to you?” Aaron asked, his voice quiet and soft. Draco had planned on talking to him about the events in his life recently but decided against it at the moment, letting Aaron let his emotions out first. Draco nodded in agreement and they sat down on the couch in the living room.
“I’m sorry about him, I guess this wasn’t really in the job description. I know you guys have had a pretty rocky past.” stated Marvin.
“Mine’s not nearly as dramatic as yours I don't think. I don’t really talk to anyone from Hogwarts anymore so didn’t have to come out to anyone besides my family - mom was wary but ultimately supportive, my father was more stern, simply emphasizing the importance of me not being promiscuous with it. Just his way of saying I shouldn’t flaunt that I’m gay. I started out in the auror program too, with Oliver, then realized my hatred for it and moved to potions. Should’ve known really, I was always into potions. I had a few boyfriends, nothing serious or anything that lasted longer than a few months, they were usually far too pretentious for me. And I haven’t gone back to Hogwarts either. Feels sort of weird too - as if it’s wrong for me to be there.”
They walked out of the store in unison, both sweaty and dreading to walk back out into the heat. Considering they were in a relatively crowded muggle street, they couldn’t apparate just anywhere, they made their way into an alley, excited to get home.
He reflected on their conversation, unable to place Harry on a spectrum between friend or lover, for he was always somewhere in between. Draco was surprised by his own pull towards Harry, they had always been tied together by a string, their lives intertwined wherever they go. But it wasn’t enough. It wasn’t enough to have passion and love, for it was never stable and it was never sure.
“Come on now lad, now that’s not the saviour of the wizarding world that I know and love” Casper jokes, nudging his elbow against Harry’s side.
Dinner was more of the same, although once they were more socially lubricated with copious amounts of alcohol, the conversation had a smoother and less forced flow.
Marvin pulled Harry to the side of the office, talking to him in a hushed tone, still with a sense of urgency. Draco could only make out of a few words, none that put together a cohesive sentence or gave him any idea as to what was going on. Particularly strange that they were keeping secrets when Draco was the one that needed their help in the first place. They turned around, Harry’s face compliant.
They walked over to the hall where the couple was standing. Hermione brought Harry into a tight hug as Ron and Draco shook hands, both avoiding eye contact.
Harry flopped back into the man's shoulder, they had only just begun and it was already being cut short. He heard the glorious laughter of Draco as he gave his head a rub, his heart fluttering from the affection.
As he was passive aggressively stirring the vegetables, his anger boiling under his skin as a response to rejection, he felt eyes on him from across the kitchen. This attention had made him feel even more uncomfortable than he was before, actively aware of his childlike behaviour when he was the one to agree to a casual one night stand in the first place.
Draco leapt up from where he sat on the floor and wrapped Harry in his arms, inhaling his scent and squeezing tighter.
“We need to talk.” was all he said, and it was enough for the adrenaline to rush through Draco’s body, suddenly every hair standing on end. He could smell the liquor off of Harry.
“That Harry Potter really is a hoot! I can see what all the hype is about” Marie exclaimed to Draco, her cheeks slightly pink from the alcohol. Draco nodded in agreement, unsure what his response was supposed to be.
“That’s unexpected, may I ask why?” Harry said, waving off the waitress with a tight smile.
The last two weeks had gone by uneventfully, Draco had gotten closer to Harry than he thought possible, not that they knew much about each other or were even super open, but they were comfortable incorporating the other into their routine. Draco would get home after work and make them dinner, they would share stories about their day, sometimes they would sit in silence if one of them was in a worse mood than usual.
“How are things going with Malfoy? Quite the scene you boys caused today in the hall.” Casper said, looking to Harry for a response.
“I’ll be right back,” he promised, with a soft kiss on the lips. Draco pulled himself off of Harry and watched as he adjusted his pants to hide his hard on, and walked towards the door, clearly irritated.
Draco brought their faces closer together, his mouth was slightly open, simply out of the lack of effort to keep it closed. Harry put a hand on Draco’s cheek, his eyes darting across various parts of his face. Draco’s heart rate was rising as they got closer, he could almost feel Harry’s breath on his face.
“Merlin, Aaron, you look like shit” Draco responded, letting him in through the door.
“Nope. No way am I dancing here.” Draco said, shaking his head and taking a seat on the couch.
Drinking away his problems had always seemed like a good idea until Draco was faced with a pounding headache and felt his entire body slimy with alcohol. He woke up to an empty bed. At least he had the good sense to kick out his latest endeavour last night so he didn’t have to face the awkwardness that would arise when the sun was out and they were both sober. Sitting up on his bed, he reached for his bedside table where he picked up a potion that would help with this disgusting feeling in his body. Although Hogwarts was never somewhere he really wanted to be, or go back to, he was grateful it sparked his interest in potions, as they have come to save him time and time again. He gulped down the contents of the small vile and closed his eyes as he felt relief, the pressure from his head easing and his stomach unturning from the knots he felt not minutes earlier. He looked over at the watch on his bedside table and saw it read 8:24, not ideal when you work at 9 but Draco had never been one to look wretched no matter how long he took to get ready. He pushed himself off the bed with a groan and forced himself to the bathroom, hoping into the shower once realizing the state of his hair.
He would always have love for Harry, but he was sure in his decisions that he had made. He wasn’t a child anymore, he had been broken too many times and his life was now a place of comfort and stability, something that Harry had never offered.
“Fine. If you don’t mind, I’ll let you two enjoy your day.” As he pushed past the two of them, head down walking away quickly.
“Draco?” Harry said, not glancing up from his own mug which he was staring at fascinatingly.
“That’s the most twisted thing I think I’ve heard you say yet. Do you not hear how backwards that sounds? Bullying me to show me you liked me?” He responded, his mouth slightly agape to show his bafflement.
He lifted his hands and ran them through Harry’s hair, the soft curls feeling wondrous under his touch. He brought his other hand to Harry’s chin, grabbing and pulling his face closer to his, desperate to close the space between them.
“Just brilliant personally, how’s the boy who lived going about his life?” Draco said, hearing the poison in his own voice. Force of habit he supposes. Harry stared into Draco, making him feel so exposed he might as well have been naked in the middle of the street. Harry broke his gaze before responding.
The phone rang for a few seconds, he had nearly forgotten it was New Years and now nearly 2 in the morning, he hoped that they would answer.
Gentle winds glided through the air as the brisk coolness of autumn was full fledged. Draco had been sitting in the same spot for hours, his body glued down by the wildered shock of affection from Aaron. The absurdity of the situation was enough to drive his mind to race at a fast speed, flashing over any moment that he may have missed these feelings of desire from his friend.
“I know I shouldn’t, but it's true.”
Harry’s cloak dropped to the floor as his breath hitched in his throat. There were few times that he had been noticed even with the invisibility cloak on, none since Dumbledore. Casper eyes were bulging out of his head, his skin pale as ice. There had to be a spy within the Ministry that was close to them, Harry was afraid to face the idea that she had sensed him there, without any other intel. Harry felt weighed down, his shoulders tense and aching, the Renovation was a more impending issue than they had anticipated. Casper finally let in a deep breath, crouching down on the floor and hugging his knees into his chest, needing the physical compression to calm himself down. The anxiety of this job never got easier, it plagued Harry and several of his auror friends wherever they went. He had gotten so used to his chest feeling dense and stiff that whenever he did get moments of relief, they were whimsical. Harry bent down towards Casper, placing a hand on his back and rubbing it in circular motions in an attempt to be comforting.
I thought, enjoying the greenish look of disgust on Weasel’s face.
Breathe in. Breathe out. What’s done is done. I squeeze Mother’s hand to – I hope – bring her some comfort.
“I don’t know. I was really exited to be roommates with him again. But I guess you’re right. When I flooed him two weeks ago it felt like he didn’t want to talk to me. Maybe we’re too close to him. It might do him good to stay with someone who challenges him and makes him do things.” Ron agrees uncertainly.

Hahaha! I thought they were bad before!!!
It was like I shouldn’t even be there. It felt like I had a disease, and everyone was avoiding me, kids and adults alike.
I switch my gaze to my mother. She’s relaxed a little and she’s smiling at me softly.
“Well, Mr. Malfoy. Choice or not, it’s good of you to have joined us so quickly. Please, do take a seat. We have a lot to talk about!” Minister Shackelbolt told me, pointing to the chair next to Granger. I sat without glancing toward the Golden Trio. Or should it be the Golden Duo as their Survivor part was missing?
I shook myself out of my stupor, feeling my face slipping in its undisturbed mask. “I don’t, mother. I guess we will find out soon enough.”
I can’t do anything right. I’m a mistake. Even when I come back from the dead I don’t do it right since it seems that I regret it.

When we were all settled with a cup of tea, the wizard picked up the conversation.
“No, thanks, Ma’am. Our business shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. No point in getting settled down. We just need your son to come with us.” Said the woman briskly.

I’ve been Marked.
I shouldn’t be dwelling on that. Moving on!
“I’m sure, Weasley.” I interrupted calmly. Weasley looked at me insistently, an emotion I could not decipher - in the state of mind I was in – on his face.
“As I told you before, we do not know the specifics of the matter. We were ordered by the Minister himself to come fetch young Malfoy as soon as possible. He told us there was an urgent matter only Mr. Malfoy here could help with. To avoid any trouble the Minister thought it would be better to send two Aurors instead of the usual one.” Brownon explained, faintly amused, looking at me.
“Oh. Yes, Minister.” I obediently pulled out the box from my robes and opened it quietly. I looked at it and found an hawthorn wand inside.
, of course. Who else, eh? Always
“Minister Shackelbolt, first I would like to thank you for trusting me with this… matter. I will do my utmost best to help you in any way I can, rest assured. I just do not understand how I can be of any use to you since I am magic-restricted?” I spoke all in one breath for fear I wouldn’t be brave enough to ask later. I was so overwhelmed at that time I didn’t really mind asking explanations about the

Why was Potter absent anyway? Was he

in my home, to call me by my given name! “Nothing’s really bad happened and we won’t ask anything dangerous of you.” She continued with a little smile, looking me in the eyes. Well, that didn’t make me worry less! It just made matters worse! Since when did anyone from the Trio smile friendly at me? Just kill me already! Now I knew why Potter kept me from Azkaban: it was for better torturing me when I thought I was safe! The man should’ve gone to Slytherin for coming up with this plan!
“What?” asked Granger, taken aback.
One more year at Hogwarts is a great opportunity to think about the future. It didn’t take me long to have Ron adhere to the cause.
“What do you want, Weasley?” I sighed, all the fight going out of me.
“… Yeah, ‘Mione, you’re right. You can call me Ron, Mal-D-Draco” and he looked like he was going to be sick! “I still don’t like you, but I appreciated your letter of apology I guess.” And with that, Weas-
It feels really good to take some decisions. I start to feel more peaceful as I get the impression that I’m once again master of my own life. A little voice tries to tell me that it’s all an illusion, and that from now on Harry Potter is my new master.
But this house is like me. We are so alike it’s funny. Even though it’s spotless it doesn’t feel right. It’s just a big, empty house. Like I’m just a big, empty, clean body.

I moved to the Burrow for the second half of August. Life had won over death, and it was good to see them. It was good to see Ron and reestablish our relationship.
I’ve never been happier in my life than when I was able to lift the charm I had cast on my parents.
Well, can’t feel a thing except for stress and anger.
She is so worried about me… and she doesn’t know half of what happened this morning. As much as I am loathed to lie to her, I am glad that she will never know of this bond I am a slave of. Thinking of the bond, I don’t really feel it now. I should check in the mirror if anything’s different. My parents didn’t see a thing, but I think I remember Granger mentioning a sign only visible to me or something. A glow?
Instead I say:
. It’s not even that I don’t want to or that I’m too tired to get up.
Let’s recap, shall we? Maybe it will help me understand what’s going on with my fucking brain.
year for the students who weren’t able to pass their NEWTs during the war, I saw it as the remedy to all our problems. I could feel that Ron couldn’t start Auror training. I’m not even sure he still wants to become an Auror.
“There is no need for an escort, Minister. I will take my leave, now. Granger, Weasley, I’ll see you tomorrow at Hogwarts. Minister, have a good day.” I said solemnly, properly.
! You should hate me, not smile at me for Merlin’s sake! What’s wrong with you, woman? Unless you want to ask me something really unpleasant…” I said, narrowing my eyes when I noticed the look of uneasiness she sported after my little tirade.
I used to be so good at showing only what I wanted. The Dark Lord only saw fear on my face. Ahah. Well, that wasn’t so hard to do. But sometimes it took a lot of will to
I was at Hogwarts to help rebuild it. It didn’t take long though. Suddenly every wizard from Britain was available to help and celebrate. Every adult. Where were they during the war, I wonder. Guess it was better for them to let
The Ministry took half of our money to help pay for the damages we caused during the war. It still left us more than well-off. I don’t really understand why they didn’t take everything, from our lands to our vaults. I guess they think that if we’re not thrown out on the streets we won’t try to get revenge and we’ll just lay low.
“NO! You can’t be serious!!!” he shouts, horrified. “Tell me you’re pulling my leg! You can’t consider asking one of those backstabbing Slytherin to become Harry’s roommate! And not even any Slytherin but Ferret Face! That’s so much worse! DON’T YOU REMEMBER ALL HE’S DONE TO US? HAVE YOU ALREADY FORGOTTEN WHEN WE WERE IN THIS
“Well, Neville told me he would be going back but he wouldn’t challenge Harry. I don’t really know about the other guys though.” Ron explains.
“Pffrrttt!!!!” I’m choking on my own spit I’m so shocked! I’m starting to cough, and I can feel my cheeks reddening. What did she say? A
Actually, I think it’s really important we all go back to Hogwarts so that our last memories of being students there aren’t the ones we have from the war. It can only help us.
“Listen Hermione, I know how much you want to continue your education. You don’t have to go to this extent for me. I know I’m a little under the weather since I went to Grimmauld Place, but you don’t have to worry about me. I can take care of myself and I won’t do anything stupid.” Even to my ears my voice sounds dead. I’m not sure I can fool her. I should’ve gone with calling her on her bullshit and not the reasonable voice. But I didn’t want to start a fight. Stupid of me, that.

Hermione’s eyes are shining from the emotion raging in her. I can see it even through the green of the Floo. Her lips are pursed in an angry line. Her hands seem to tremble slightly.
want to die, he wouldn’t do that to us. I’m sure of it.” Says Ron vehemently, shocked by what I said.
And when I see them, I want to shout. And hit something. Or someone. Because they’re trying to move on now. They don’t need me to take care of them anymore.
to get out of this fucking bed!
I felt so dirty then.
“As you gathered, Mr. Malfoy, since Mr. Potter is going back to Hogwarts, you will have to accompany him.” I listened to him, motionless, aware that nothing made sense but that I would have to deal with it later, when I would go back to reality. “All the school material you will need has already been bought and sent to the school, so you don’t need to buy anything. You can either take the Hogwarts express tomorrow or floo to the Headmistress’ office from your Manor anytime in the day. Furthermore, you will be granted your wand back, but your magic will be monitored by the Ministry. As such, you will only be able to do the magic necessary for your lessons and N.E.W.T.S. You can do basic spells as well for your everyday life. From what we understand of the life debt bond, if you need anything more powerful to ensure Mr. Potter stays safe, the bond will kick in and help you cast the offensive or defensive spells you need by channeling to you some of Mr. Potter’s magic. In that case, your magical signature will be different, since your magic will mingle with that of the bond’s and Mr. Potter’s, and thus it will not be traced and monitored by the Ministry. You can cast the magic you need for your duties without fear of repercussion since the bond in itself will only allow you to cast what you need to. It is guarantee enough for the Ministry. Outside of this room, only Headmistress McGonagall and healer Pomfrey have knowledge of the situation and we want it to stay that way. Be aware that the bond will prevent you from speaking of it to anyone who doesn’t know of it, including your parents. I think this is it from the Ministry part, I will let Miss Granger continue.”
