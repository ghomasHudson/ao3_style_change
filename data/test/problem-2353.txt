“It’s fine,” Draco replies a bit sullenly. “It’s not just about the memory, Potter. It’s not as easy for others as it is for you.”
“Yes, well, I’ll be going now,” Draco babbles, placing the case on the polished, mahogany console he’s standing next to. “I’ll see you next month, Potter.”
Malfoy struggled into his pyjama bottoms and lay back down with a heavy sigh but Harry simply shifted back until he was leaning against the headboard and laced his fingers in his lap, blinking down at his knees.
Malfoy bares his teeth as Harry yanks at him, his cloak whirling around and catching on his arm before he wrenches it free and then uses both hands to shove forcefully at Harry’s chest, a growled yell leaving him as he pushes.
“I thought Wolfsbane is only consumed during the week leading up to the full moon,” Draco says enquiringly.
Pressing his lips tightly over his teeth to prevent any pathetic, premature sounds slipping out, Draco leaned his forehead into the cool stone and waited. He could feel Harry’s breath on his hole now and Harry’s fingers on the backs of his thighs, calloused and wonderfully warm, stroking him in slow, unhurried caresses.
“Yes, as it is to probably a million other people in the world!” Draco shouts irritably. “Honestly, Potter! Stop fucking waving your galleons in my face, alright, I
“Should have known a mouth that pretty would suck cock like a pro,” he murmurs into Draco’s cheek, that damn hand finally releasing his hair, sliding slowly down his spine, over where his shirt sticks damply to his sweaty back, and down over the swell of his arse. He grabs a handful of arse, kneading,
seen how many of these I have, yeah?” And then, kissing Draco’s nose, “No, it didn’t hurt. Not at all.”
. He’s obviously not interested in living with Potter a second longer than strictly necessary.” He gestures with one thin hand to Malfoy’s trunk and Harry feels his stomach twist sharply. “Potter is here to drop him off, Cissa. He’s no longer responsible for Draco now that
can claim being a werewolf is not a big deal and get away with it, Potter,” Draco studies his fingernails with an air of exaggerated nonchalance before glancing up at Potter who’s grinning rather exasperatedly at him, “The Werewolf Who Cries When He Drinks His Medicine,” Draco adds with a smirk that’s more jocose than anything else.
as it bows again, clutching the vial close to its chest as it Disapparates neatly through the Ministry wards with a resounding
“Why’d you slink away?” He pops another chip into his mouth and comes to stand beside me, our shoulders brushing as he props himself against the graffiti-ridden wall. He smells of his sporty cologne and fresh, clean sweat. There’s a small hickey on the side of his neck, just below his right ear. I hate him for a moment.
“So every full moon you feel the urge to...?” Draco feels excited and also rather guilty at the way he’s shamelessly prodding for information.
I don’t have time to wait around. I need to go home, shower, get dressed, break-up with Simon, and go find Draco at Parkinson’s party so I can kiss him some more.
“No, I’m just going to order you around from now on,” Draco manages to choke out, writhing powerlessly under Potter’s teeth and tongue. “Like a master would his slave. Please!” he cries when Potter’s hand finds and fondles his cock.
“I’ll wait with bated breath,” Harry drawls back, turning away and going to fetch Malfoy’s tea and his own breakfast.
Harry simply shakes his head slowly, more tears silently coursing their way down his face and dripping off his jaw. “I—I think don’t know how to do this anymore,” he says hoarsely, swiping his face with the heels of his trembling hands. “I don’t know how to save people anymore.”
Draco can tell that he’s close; his cock twitches vigorously in his hand with every punishingly hard suck Draco slurps around the head, spurting out thick strings of precome into Draco’s mouth as his balls tighten steadily in his hand.
of the status you hold that people want to know all the grisly details of your life – it’s obscene and horribly invasive, but then they wouldn’t care at all if you weren’t who you are.”
Wheezing under the stab of Draco’s elbow, Harry half sits up, hacking in a combination of laughter and breathlessness. “Fuck, you’re a psycho.”
of him as Draco sobs and trembles and spills inside his mouth. As Draco attempts to catch his breath, Potter starts pushing his fingers back into him, and Draco groans, pinching shut around his fingers and canting his hips up.
,” Draco says impatiently, snapping the lid of the box shut. “Look, I’m not trying to poison you, nor am I here to waste your time. I’m trying to help you. I will explain further, but first,
,” Harry informs him, peering over his shoulder to see a small group of children run up to the house directly opposite 12 Grimmauld Place. “You never went trick-or-treating on Halloween as a kid?”
– instead moving his right heel in sinuous circles over Potter’s crotch, biting his lip as Potter squirms involuntarily, barely even acknowledging his stirring cock.
“Can you take it easy with the cloak?” Harry snaps irritably. “You’re wearing robes, and anyway, nobody’s going to be able to see your bump from way over
His nose was broken from the fall he’d had, bleeding freely and copiously, staining his face and clothes. His eyes were dark with rage as Harry helped him sit up, after which he wasted no time in shoving Harry away with one bloody hand.
Harry is shuddering over him, one hand braced next to Draco’s shoulder, sweat beading on his forehead and trickling down his temple before plopping onto Draco’s collarbones. He’s pulling great big lungfuls of air through his teeth, hissing softly as he grasps at Draco’s hip with one hand, the other still holding Draco’s knee pressed to the bed, holding Draco open.
Harry is very loud now, swearing and barking with each bob of Draco’s head, with each slurped suck Draco gives his cock, his feet planted on the mattress as he uses whatever little leverage Draco allows him to fuck his throat. Breathing deeply through his nose, Draco shuts his eyes, feeling every last ridge and vein along the thick shaft in his mouth, tongue swishing frantically and with no steady rhythm. When Harry’s knees fall further open, Draco’s obligingly cups his heavy sac with one hand, rolling it around over his palm, giving it a light, teasing tug every now and then.
“I thought you’d—” Harry broke off, absently scratching his taut stomach, face still red. “I dunno, it’s kind of—”
in my chest and before I know what I’m even doing, I’ve swerved sharply, right into Tristan’s path, ramming my shoulder into his chest with enough force that I hear his breath whoosh out of him, knocking his broom completely off course with my knee. I have a split second in which I see his brown eyes widen in shock before he’s spinning, totally out of control, a breathless little shout escaping him as he loses his broom entirely and hurtles towards the ground, his limbs flailing wildly.
“I just wanted to say,” Draco whispers, gulping audibly and licking his lips, “I just wanted to say that—that I—that... Happy Christmas,” he manages lamely, looking put out and disappointed with himself.
“Why, good morning to you too, sunshine,” he croons and then sighs, rolling his eyes when I shove my glasses further up my nose, cross my arms and continue to glower. “What are you whinging about?”
Hermionie stared in surprise then spluttered. "What? But...that can't be!.. It's a muggle story isn't it?"
Don't get me wrong I've done this before. A fair few times actually. But this was so different already, normally I was the one giving, but this felt so intimate.
It was arithmetic and Hermionie purposely (and with reluctance) came in late so she could get the back seat beside Draco Malfoy. He visibly tensed but didn't say a word. He had changed in more ways than one: his hair now fell in soft locks around his face making him seem to soften up, he was quieter and he was taller. She could see why Harry would crush on him.
Draco’s shoes sounded harsh against the cold stone bricks, his shadow trailing after him under the flickering torches. He speed up to catch up to Potter who was walking outside, he could see Harry’s dark outline and saw his frosty breath ice up as he stepped outside the castle and started down the dimly lit hill into the forest.
Ron sucked in a breath. "No, look our Harry will get through it, he killed You-Know-Who! He can do this... Merlin I would even let Malfoy kiss him if that could help!"
"But what if I mess up on this date? I'll probably say the wrong thing and.." Harry started but was interrupted.
I'll keep an eye on him, Draco decided finally, and if needs be I might even help him. Who would have thought?
Then he broke it off and I heard myself whine slightly. My cheeks flushed. Why am I so turned off with just a kiss?
Harry wanted to tell him how startlingly similar it sounded to what had happened at Godric’s Hollow; how Ginny’s horse had keep them at bay until Harry could pull himself together.
Straightening up once again, swallowing dryly, Draco says, “And well, after the War,” he blinks, suddenly looking back up at Potter, “after I saw the way you and your friends fight for everything you believed in, after you saved my life...” Draco trails off as Potter smiles awkwardly and dips his head, “I—Well, I decided I don’t want to be keeping such a huge part of me, my identity, under wraps anymore. The curse could only be lifted by a direct descendant of the line, so after a bit of research, and a
Draco isn’t stupid – he’d spent way too long guiltily fantasising about Potter in his teens to have turned him away that night at the club. Potter had been drunk off his mind and indecently charming and Draco had been four cocktails down himself, (besides, he never
“I can’t right now, I’ve to go meet with Erickson, apparently,” Draco says, irritably pushing her feet off the desk. “And clean your desk or something. Stop
“I don’t ever want to talk to you about Harry and me being intimate,” Draco says weakly. “Please stop.”
When I’d cautiously asked Draco if it had been him, he had lowered one corner of his newspaper to look at me impassively, calmly denied having had anything to do with it, and had gone right back to reading. And that was that.
Potter’s hands come up around him, wrapping his arms around his chest and yanking Draco down flat on top of him, tilting and lifting his head to better kiss Draco. His hands slip under Draco’s shirt where the shirttails have come loose, grazing up the length of his back, grip tightening as Draco shivers. His cock is a solid bulge against Draco’s thigh, and as Draco wiggles and shifts atop him, Potter undulates, groaning into the kiss.
Harry grinned at him and waited as Malfoy let Scorpius out of his sling. “I don’t remember ever receiving a letter from a Scorpius Malfoy.”
There’s a sudden giggle from Hermione before she arranges her face into suitable seriousness as Harry and Malfoy stare. “Yes, well, I’m...sorry, Malfoy, but you’re going to have to discontinue the suppressant,” she says mildly, rearranging some of the sheets of parchment. “Like I said, it doesn’t mix with the pre-natal potions you’ll be starting hereon, and we don’t want to risk anything, do we?” Malfoy looks quietly furious but, for once, doesn’t talk back. “You need to take a spoonful of this every day,” Hermione continues gently, pointing out the tall, green glass bottle on her desk. “It’s a comprehensive mix of vitamins supplements, calcium, folic, and immunity boosters; it’ll also help your magic replenish itself faster because you’re going to be spending a lot of your magic on this baby, Malfoy. Would you like me to prescribe an additional energy supplement as well?”
, you see.” He grins, and I deliberately close my fist around a potato, pretending that it’s Tristan’s kidney or liver or something as I squish it completely.
“What’re you talking about?” Potter frowns, getting to his feet, “I’ve been expecting you. I received your owl yesterday--”
They haven’t fucked in over three months now; or maybe it’s been longer. The last time they fooled around at all was a week ago when Harry woke Draco up by sucking him off, before promptly getting interrupted when Scorpius came banging at their bedroom door.
?” he demands at once, voice going shrill with shock. “Ron, I just asked you to get some feelers out there! Just ask around about them!”
, I suppose have no right whatsoever to expect you to tell me about these rather important details of your life.”
to!” Harry bursts out, reaching out and grabbing Draco by the wrist. “Malfoy,” he swallows desperately at the lump rising up his throat, “you—you really won’t mind?” he asks hopefully, not daring to believe him yet.
“You’re such a fucking tosser,” he growls, roughly punching him on the shoulder before flouncing away with a huff.
“Want to—want—” Harry mutters urgently, “Want to mark you—want to claim you—want you to—want to make you mine—want you,
“What’s happening to you?” Malfoy murmurs when Harry shoves back a tall brunet who dances up to them and winks at Malfoy.
He doesn’t even realise he’s crying until suddenly Potter is standing next to him with a hand on his shoulder, the hot weight of it making Draco’s chest clench even tighter. He blinks and finally becomes aware of the tiny, stifled sobs sounding from behind the hand still clasped over his mouth. Swallowing hurriedly, he wipes his cheeks with the back of his hand before slowly lifting the watch out with both hands, the metal cool and somehow
Draco opened his eyes, feeling relaxed and calm. Somehow, like always, he found his eyes drifting towards Harry. Harry who was sitting there and didn't look relaxed, if anything he looked distracted, or distant even. His shoulders were tense and he was sitting up straight, a clear sign he felt...On gaurd or nervous. Draco didn't quite know which one.
"Ah weasly, do you know where Granger is? She checked out a book I need" Draco said, shifting his eyes to Harry for a second. Harry felt his face heat up and he stared hard at his abandoned chicken.
Harry glared at him before spotting the blond In the crowd coming towards them. Harry's heart sped up and gosh darn was Malfoy cute. And damn it he did want to kiss him again. Oh merlin he was doomed.
So without any further thought he walked further into the damp forest but Potter had gone. After an hour of searching he gave up and returned to his dorm room. He fell asleep that night unsure of whether he would be able to become friends with the invisible and real Harry Potter.
Draco approached feeling awkward and stood nearby, inspecting his cuffs on his robes and avoiding the gaze of the boy next to him. Harry was looking at Draco with the same intensity as this morning, he couldn’t decide weather he was feeling hatred or severe annoyance towards the blond beside him. The smile he got this morning was so jarring, he had never seen anything like it before and wasn’t sure what to make of it. A pity smile? Is that a thing? He took in a shallow breath and then noticed Draco’s cheeks were turning pink.  He was blushing.
"Um...Draco would you...want to go to Hogsmede with me?" Harry asked quietly, his voice getting higher in pitch as he finished the question.
The first thing he noticed was that Potter didn't eat much, if any at all and would excuse himself to go for a walk before dinner ended.
Harry reluctantly stood up and followed Hermionie into the great hall preparing for the stares. And there were stares, everyone seemed to turn into fish and hawks all at the same time and he felt extremely watched. He sat down and then the questions started. 'What was wrong?' 'Are you okay?' 'Were you cursed?' He awnsered them as best he could but felt stupidly confused. Malfoy? I mean he is cute...wait I did not just say that.... Oh bugger.
Draco looks up now, half wanting to just backhand Potter across his stupid, handsome face, to break that expression of calm understanding and unfeigned compassion. Potter opens his mouth to speak and Draco braces himself for Potter’s fucking
“Oh, I believe you,” Draco drawls, collecting Lyra once more and leaning in to smack a kiss onto Harry’s cheek. “You’re very cute when you’re all defensive,” he murmurs, nuzzling his ear.
“Milk and two sugars,” Draco accepts with a tilt of his head. Potter watches him as he neatly pulls his gloves off, lifting the expensive suede off each finger before inching them off and laying them on the table in front of him, clasping his hands upon them. “What?” he sighs, when Potter doesn’t even blink.
This time the silence lasted even longer. Outside, thunder crashed loudly enough to make the kids squeal and then dissolve into even more giggles.
Hermione frowned thoughtfully; Ron was wheezing hoarsely like he’d just been chased across the grounds by Aragog and his whole family, his eyes wide and sort of unseeing, his mouth open and slack.
Malfoy, kissing him and kissing him until he frantically shoves at Harry and pulls away reddened, swollen lips, whimpering unintelligibly up at him, thighs falling open wider as Harry ruts his still erect, dripping wet cock against the inside of one.
“I’m fine,” Malfoy says at once, but when he looks up at Harry, his lip trembles again. “I’m... I’m a fucking
“Is this what you had in mind when you asked me to marry you?” Draco asks snidely, scratching some dried oatmeal off Harry’s faded t-shirt. “This complete clusterfuck of a day?”
Face red, eyes firm on the floor, Malfoy keeps perfectly still as Hermione, perfectly casual and professional for her part, briskly makes a small incision below the crook of his elbow, collects a small smear of his blood in a vial, and heals the cut with a neat tap of her wand, pulling Malfoy’s sleeve back down after.
supposed to be) is, and how Draco has been considering boots made of pure dragon hide and dusted with finely ground diamonds so they’d never need to be polished — on top of being indestructible. He then watches the owl fly away knowing full well that Granger will insist that the shoes will be too ostentatious a gift for someone as unpretentious as Potter.
“It’s Tristan, isn’t it?” He looks like he’s about to explode with fury. He speaks with calmness that I admire him for dragging together in the state he’s in. “Tell me why you hate Tristan.”
“Sorry,” I mumble now, concentrating on pulling out another cigarette and lighting it. “Just tired, I guess...”
Draco remains silent; he doesn’t want to rush Harry, doesn’t want to turn this into something quick and rough and fleeting, but it takes every ounce of self-control in him not to simply reach down and wrap one hand around his cock. When Harry moves to run his tongue up the crease of one thigh, Draco emits a soft, breathy little whine and lets both knees fall open and onto the bed.
Now, the thought of hugging Draco or being in close physical proximity to him in general – him with his abnormally bright hair, his puckish smirk and, fuck, that goddamn fucking
the stinging ache, hips canting high and spine bowing inwards, shaking right down to his toes as he squeezes his prick with a broken moan, biting his lip until it threatens to break open just so he doesn’t outright
They’re both gasping at each other, Harry’s expression betraying the same shocked pleasure Draco himself can feel seeping into his bones, his very soul. Even if he wants to, tries to, Draco doesn’t think he can formulate a single, coherent thought, leave alone words. Despite the scalding heat of his demanding need, now burning under his skin, urgent and desperate, Draco doesn’t want this moment to end, doesn’t want to proceed past this incredible point – wants time to just
Harry set out three bowls and poured some chocolate buttons into each of them. Then he cut up some apples and pulled out a pack of chocolate digestives, placing a couple alongside the fruit for the boys. For Lily, he took out a small tub of creamed rice.
Draco’s skin is a pale form in the gloom, and Harry runs a slow hand down his side, Draco sniffling against his neck. “Why didn’t you want to go home for Christmas?” Harry whispers, holding him tighter, their legs tangling firmly together.
“I don’t mind checking in with you,” Potter says after a beat of silence. “I don’t really go out much, myself,” he says quickly when Draco shakes his head. “Just running and meetings and lately...you know, shopping for stuff.”
I just look at him. I don’t want to make myself sound stupid by asking him to confirm that he is, in fact, talking about Draco. “No,” I say steadily.
So why in the name of Merlin’s leathery left bollock does it bother me so much that Draco is sat pressed up against Tristan – pressed up against his
“Malfoy!” he almost shouted, and when Draco winced he looked a bit flustered. “Er ...” His blue eyes flitted sideways in a vaguely nervous manner. “Harry!” he abruptly screamed and thumped Potter on the back hard enough to knock him forward. Potter, scarlet-faced and furiously gulping at his beer, choked and sprayed beer all over the gleaming bar before hacking violently, slapping himself on the chest repeatedly. Draco had the overwhelming urge to laugh until he pissed himself but he refrained, biting his lip and casually looking up at the ceiling. “Look! It’s Malfoy!” Weasley said loudly, ignoring the fact that Potter now had tears streaming down his face. Granger, lips pursed, handed Potter a napkin and Potter, mopping his face fervently, turned slightly to offer Draco a watery smile.
“Hello. I thought you might like some biscuits? And I have a banana each for you. Do you like Jaffa Cakes, Scorpius? They’re Muggle. I don’t know if you’ve tried them.”
the other father of your baby?” Harry retorts, nodding towards Draco’s midriff, hidden behind tightly crossed arms. “Isn’t that what you’re claiming, Malfoy?”
knows your boyfriend,” Malfoy sneers lightly, “There are people who would pay in solid gold to find out more about this mystery wizard you’ve been enamoured with for the last year.”
to have only three legs because I can’t tell where the actual fuck I’m supposed to shove this fourth one?!”
“Right. Happy birthday.” It comes out stiffer than I’d intended. “Er... Just a beer,” I add, when Draco stares at me expectantly. “Parkinson. Long time no see.”
Erickson’s eyes, a slightly eerie, pale gold, flash angrily at him. “I just asked for a colleague-to-colleague favour, Malfoy. No need to whip out the attitude. All you Veela—”
, yes, of course,” he hurries to say, and his challenger blinks around in bewilderment. “Sorry, I’m just legless right now,” Draco affects a drunken sway with a wide grin and I hear Seamus and Dean snort into their beers while Zabini rolls his eyes, handing me a fresh pint.
“For fuck’s sake, tell me this hasn’t got out,” Harry leans in and snarls. “D’you even know what might happen if he were to find out his parents were immediately taken in the moment they were found?”
“Look, it’s not like it’s a big deal, alright?” he finally says, and Draco snorts, hanging up his towel and walking out, unbuttoning his cuffs and rolling his sleeves up, shucking his socks and oxfords to slip his feet into the soft, self-warming slippers Potter had bought him one evening. When he crosses his arms and just stands there expectantly, Potter huffs loudly and turns away with a growl before whirling back around. “What do you want me to say?” he snaps. “Did you want me to give an interview about this added detail?”
It was taking a considerable amount of physical effort to stop himself meeting Potter’s gaze, now fixed so firmly on him that he could feel himself starting to sweat a little.
But now, I deliberately raise the cigarette to my mouth and inhale, letting the smoke stream out of my nose, while I maintain unwavering eye contact with him. The acrid burn in my nostrils grounds me somewhat as I take in the sight of him stood there in his fitted black t-shirt and stonewashed grey jeans tucked into bulky, olive green suede boots. His expression is carefully controlled, his hair flutters onto his eyelashes as it catches the breeze and his lips shine dark pink through the sheen of oil on them. He’s beautiful – he always has been; I’ve always silently marvelled at it. But lately I can barely stand to look at him – not without being rapidly filled with a jarring sense of helplessness that makes me want to punch something until my fist cracks.
Ron makes an odd quack of a sound and I glance over irritably to see him frowning perplexedly at me with his mouth open. Hermione is standing behind him, dressed in a pale blue tank top over plaid pyjama bottoms. She’s braiding her hair over one shoulder with quick fingers, her eyes narrowed thoughtfully as she looks down at me in careful consideration.
But it’s always that first time I think about. The first time my best friend turned lover had finally admitted that he loves me. Just as I love him.
He couldn’t stop thinking about what it’d be like to kiss him, to feel their chests press together, heart thudding in unison; to brush the hair out of his eyes, to have those grey eyes regard him with something akin to what Harry himself felt for Malfoy; to hold his hands and press honest words into his forehead, and to have them be believed.
Malfoy’s expression went from irritable to a forced calm, if still slightly unfriendly. “Was I not clear enough before, Potter? No.” He swallowed; licked his lips. “I don’t want you to stop if you don’t want to stop.”
“I’m not,” Harry replies at once. “Well, not yet anyway.” He squints slightly, pushing his glasses up his nose and blinking as Malfoy finally comes into proper focus, his expression one of wry amusement. “What’re you—what’re you doing here?”
“I don’t like him,” Potter says softly, but Draco can’t relax because Potter’s whole form is still alarmingly tight with displeasure, his face still drawn and carrying a slight hint of betrayal. “
“Did you hear me?” he asks softly, his nose in Malfoy’s hair; it smells of fresh sweat but there’s the lingering sweetness that Malfoy seems to carry about his person all the time.
They end up finding a perfect two-bedroom flat in less than two weeks and by the end of the month, they’ve moved in. The reporters who’ve caught a whiff of it go wild, their articles speculating everything from a hurried engagement to a spur-of-the-moment private marriage ceremony in the Bahamas.
like – I mean, the hex was created by this witch who had her heart broken by the man she believed was her one true love and, well, she flew into a rage and--” Hermione faltered as Harry sighed tiredly, looking desperately sorry for him. “What I’m saying is, the term
Harry looked at the little boy, his heart melting a bit more. “Scorpius. I assure you this: there is nobody – nobody in the world – who would
Malfoy went crimson, and then to Harry’s utter shock, picked up and hurled a large dictionary at him with a snarl. Jerking out of the way just in time, Harry gaped at a fiercely glaring Malfoy for a few seconds before getting up and walking over to retrieve the book that had landed a few feet behind him. He saw Ron get to his feet furiously, as if determined to come over and throw the book back at Malfoy, and shook his head swiftly with a grin.
Malfoy leaps to his feet, practically vibrating with rage, and Hermione hurries to hers as well. “Malfoy, please sit down. Harry, I’m going to have to insist you leave if you’re going to—”
Whether it was the sheer absurdity of the automated diagnosis or Hermione’s nearly hysterical reaction to said diagnosis, Harry doesn’t know, but suddenly he’s stifling a guffaw born mostly of overwhelmed nervousness, earning a furious glare from an already embarrassed looking Malfoy and a silent, but very emphatic ‘
Heart clenching, Draco grabbed his head and kissed him fervently before he realised Harry was trying (and failing) not to laugh. Then he shoved him back roughly and scowled. “That was a shit thing to say,” he informed him. “Why d’you want to meet Mother anyway?”
“He is not going to show anyone anything in public,” Granger stated firmly. “Malfoy,” she added and suddenly Draco wasn’t grinning anymore. “Would you like to join Harry for a drink? Ron and I were just leaving.”
“Show me,” Draco demands irritably. “Let’s see how many attempts it takes you to conjure your Patronus. Chances are, you won’t need more than one shot at it. Go on, show me.”
Draco grimaces another smile at him. “Well, good day.” He grabs the files he’d set beside the sinks and turns to go—
in the crowd even if he tried to, but could probably take in the entirety of the pitch from that excellent vantage.
Malfoy didn’t look up from the floor. He didn’t react at all. Just when Harry became certain that he wasn’t going to reply, Malfoy said, “Kissed and taken.”
It’s really difficult to hate him, Draco thinks grumpily now as Potter sidles into the room and ambles over to Draco who’s lounging across the sofa, to hand him a large mug of warm honey-milk. Damn him — how is one supposed to succeed at sincerely hating him?
He’s barely registered that he’s broken out into light shivers when Potter finally brings his mouth down over Draco’s in a firm, wet, sucking kiss. Draco’s breath immediately catches in his throat and forces its way out as a loud gasp against Potter’s mouth as he flings his arms around his neck and opens his mouth eagerly under Potter’s.
should’ve scored more goals, then,” he snaps, before looking up quickly to see Potter blinking at him with a rather stupid expression. “I just meant,” Draco goes on quickly, his own face flooding with heat, “I mean,
With a deep breath, Draco slowly makes his way over, still garbed in the bathrobe as he climbs onto the bed, and crawls over to Harry, straddling his thighs with a sigh, letting his arms rest loosely on his shoulders.
Malfoy was muttering under his breath about something, his shirt entangled around his elbows as he struggled to get it off. Harry nudged his shoulder so they were facing each other again and then reached around to where his arms were stuck awkwardly behind him. He ignored the way his heart raced and his cock further stiffened at the feel of Malfoy’s warm breath huffing against shoulder and instead focused on getting the sleeves down his arms.
“I’m fine,” Malfoy snaps shakily, grabbing his wrist but not pulling his hand off. “What’s—what happened to—?” he whimpers brokenly, his arse convulsing around Harry’s prick again.
Harry breaks away with an impatient smack, pushing himself back into a sit as Draco slides off his lap with a very pleased smirk. “Why are you such an old ballsack, you little shit?” He digs around in the enormous, magically Extended picnic basket and pulls out two bottles of chilled cider. “As if you and Hermione don’t regularly snog in front of people.”
He was in Auror training and sometimes wore his trainee robes (cream with two scarlet stripes down the sides) when he came into the bar. Occasionally he’d take them off to reveal his ludicrous ripped jeans and weird Muggle band T-shirts underneath. He looked ridiculous like that. Utterly ridiculous. When had he even grown so tall? And was he getting bigger because of exercise or was he just getting fat? Probably getting fat, yes. Why didn’t he
Draco’s harder than he’s ever been in his life but he still glares up at Potter when he jerks away with a sharp yelp of pain, rubbing the raw skin of his sides. When Draco talks, his voice comes out a hoarse crackle. “The she-Weasel probably sucks cock like she doesn’t possess a gag reflex, being the penniless
Potter just shrugs again, waving a hand carelessly, but doesn’t actually answer Draco. “Can you conjure one? A Patronus?” he asks instead.

as Potter latches his mouth around his opening and starts to suck wetly. “Oh god,” Draco’s head falls back and his clammy hands slip over the door, “Potter, you fucking—Potter, I’ve—I’ve
“I’m beat already, and I have a date tonight,” he abandons the last piece of sandwich and then pokes a finger into the beef pasty on Ron’s plate, “I’m going to look like shit.”
“You don’t say,” Draco replies blandly, lip curling into an expression that he hopes is efficient enough to convey his thoughts on that bit of information.
But Harry’s cockhead has barely breached him before he’s pulling out again, barking a laugh at the murderous glare Draco shoots him. Pressing in again, Harry pushes halfway in before yanking back again, grinning wickedly when Draco thrashes and kicks out violently.
you are though.” He lets his hand squeeze, very briefly, and enough to draw a soft gasp from Malfoy, before pulling back.
Harry kept his eyes closed, his heart still thrumming restlessly, his torn lip pulsing with small bursts of pain, his skin feeling ultra sensitive now. He was acutely aware of Malfoy’s hand touching his own, not lightly brushing, but firmly pressed up against the back of his own hand; Malfoy’s smooth leg lying alongside his own; their shoulders overlapped, Malfoy’s bony shoulder rested on top of his.
Right. He had had enough; it was time to go start using his plan. Step 1: Make contact. Now how does someone start talking to someone who for one hated his guts and two was shutting everyone and everything out. Not an easy plan to pull off but Draco was determined.
So it was time for the first session and the eighth years were standing outside the room in curious anticipation. Draco looked down the row of people and saw Potter leaning against the wall and fiddling with his fingers and looking at the floor with distracted interest. They were going to Mr Blamy first and speaking of Mr Blamy, he had now opened the door and beckoned the class in.
"I don't think so, well he had that dream journal malrky and I'm pretty sure at least some of those entries were true"
"This next exercise we are going to do is an exercise where if you are having a panic or anxiety attack and you need something to ground you. The first thing you do is look and five things you can see around the room. Then after that four things you can feel. Then three things you can smell. Two things you can hear and one thing you can taste. This brings you into the present moment and helps you to come back to the moment. Okay let's give it a try."
"Ugh Ron I don't think Malfoy's going to help us" Hermionie said miserably in the common room that night.
"I'm sure everyone has felt anxious for an exam or test. You get those butterflies in your stomach but I'm here to talk to you about anxiety. Some common symptoms of anxiety are shaking, feeling very cold or very hot, a rapid heart beat and feeling nauseous. Before I get into the details of this I want you to know just what anxiety is. Anxiety is the body's natural response to danger. It generally comes about when you feel stressed, under pressure or threatened. But for some people this doesn't leave. That's what anxiety is essentially."
Malfoy shoves him again but he’s laughing this time. “We both know that’s why you approached me in that club, Potter,” he drawls, reaching out to brush his fingertips down Harry’s bare chest. “If I hadn’t been reckless enough to skip my suppressant that day, I’d have blended right in with the crowd and you’d probably be sitting here with some other unsuspecting bastard carrying your offspring.”
There’s a small flurry of movement from Malfoy next to him but Harry never takes his eyes off Lucius who’s looking as though he might just pass out from anger. His lips are pressed together in a white line and the thin line of his wrinkled jowl is quivering as he glares scorching hot draggers at Harry.
“I’m not going anywhere,” Draco says stubbornly. “I don’t care if you and Father think I’m a fat lout now. Sorry,” he adds almost at once as he sees the hurt cross his mother’s face. “
Potter groans even as he chuckles along. “Better still, throw away that rubbish for me,” he rubs his face with both hands, gathering his hair in the same movement and pushing it off his shoulders, holding it back as he rests his elbows on the table and hangs his head between his forearms. “That fucking potion has got to be the worst part of this whole thing –
Harry’s standing just by the hearth, behind the sofa, cradling Caesar to his chest as usual, but his gaze is already fixed at the end of the hallway where Draco now appears, wiping sweaty hands. He looks shockingly good – nothing like Draco had left him in the morning.
“Potter! What do you think you’re—?!” Draco’s startled barking breaks off abruptly as Potter tears at his flies, ripping them open and lifting Draco off his chest just enough to shove his trousers and pants down the rotund curve of his arse, Draco’s cock bobbing pink and damp, brushing Potter’s chin. “Potter,” he whimpers, breath catching in a sharp stab in his throat as Potter grabs his arse with both hands, massaging the fleshy roundness before abruptly hauling Draco even higher, so Draco’s cock slides wetly up his face on a dribble of precome.
“Yes, your womb,” Hermione tells Malfoy, “The provisional womb your body has created to house this baby. And yes, Harry, it’s a
intense into Malfoy, that for several seconds, all he sees is white and all he hears is some sort of keening static that he then realises is his own hoarse screaming.
Malfoy waves a hand carelessly, shrugging one slim shoulder. “Who the fuck knows what the Saviour gets up to in his free time,” he drawls, sipping more tea, posture perfect as he brings the cup up to his mouth instead of bending in towards it. “This
Exhaling shakily, he forces himself to look away, tremors zinging up his spine as he feels that penetrating virescent gaze stay firmly lodged on his face.
“You’re gorgeous like this, Harry,” Draco sighs, licking a broad swathe up the side of his face, lapping up the sweat there, before pulling back a bit, hands still wound around Harry’s wrists. With a tiny smirk, Draco begins whipping his hips in earnest, riding Harry’s cock with a fierceness that perfectly masks Draco’s own rising desperation. His swollen rim locks around Harry’s slick shaft with every pull-out, his prostate so overstimulated that Draco feels the first stinging of tears behind his eyelids now, Harry’s cockhead carelessly nudging past it on each stroke.
Ron pulls his head out of the cupboard he’s peering around in and blinks at me. “I did. What, why? Hermione hasn’t met him yet and Mum wouldn’t believe me when I said Malfoy’s actually seeing someone.”
"Oh honestly you two! I don't think this is any good" Hermionie frowned and then she noticed a small peice of parchment peeking out, curious she took and then started to read.
Her shoulders were being shaken, that was the first thing Hermionie woke up to. She opened to eyes to find Ron standing there in his cannons Pyjamas.
"I'm worried about Potter. You see he doesn't eat, he barley sleeps and he does that thing where he shakes. And I haven't seen him smile once since he's been back" It all came out quite quickly and Draco shouldn't be worried because why would a Malfoy but he had left that life behind...or was trying to.
Thinking to Potter, Draco couldn't help but think back to a time where rumour was that Potter always suffered from nightmares, and if so...couldn't that be Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Maybe there's more to Potter than he is letting on.
I felt my face heat up a bit, I wasn't too sure. Come to think of it Ginny had never really kissed anywhere apart from my lips. I admitted it softly and Draco looked almost...offended.
Voldemort appeared and killed me. Then I woke up and Malfoy was there and he. I think I kissed him??? Malfoy said he. Then Ron came in on a giant rat who killed my parents.
Two butterbeers later and Harry found himself positively elated, they had laughed, joked and had well the most successful date Harry had ever had. They were walking back now, their tummies warm and their faces smiling. It had been hours since their departure and the sun was peeking through the clouds. Draco took Harry's hand and then walked backwards leading Harry somewhere off the beaten track. Harry raised an eyebrow at him but let himself be pulled to what seemed like a tree?
Hermionie lead the way to the Hospital Wing and carefully creaked open the door to the room Harry was staying in. The moonlight hit his face and you could see his dark lashes and his curly hair. He looked utterly peaceful, breathing soft breaths.
Okay now hold it for five seconds. Then breathe out through your nose for eight seconds and hold it for five."
ote there is implied self harm, if this is triggering avoid the last few chapters. DIssociation is also mentioned, I've tried to make it as accurate as I have awareness of. But yeah apologies for abandoning this work but I am back!
"If your mind is racing then think of something you love, or something calming. For example I would think of a precious moment i had with my partner, but it could be anything for you. We're going to keep breathing for a few more minutes"
Harry barely paid attention to the introduction of the class until the class was quiet and the Professor was calling his name. Harry blinked, sat up straight and looked at the teacher.
"Well yes and no. The thing is the curse makes the victim fall into an unbreakable sleep until kissed by true loves kiss" She held her breath and Draco processed this.
Harry tried to concentrate, he could feel his heart beating strongly in his chest, it wasn't as fast as before but still as forceful. He could feel his shoelaces which felt frayed and stretched in between his fingers.  He could feel....the soft cushion he was sitting on. And he could feel the material of his jeans under his robes. And for some reason he could feel someone staring. It was probably Malfoy.
"Okay before we go into the different types of anxiety and symptoms of anxiety I have these pages. I want you, if you're comfortable, to colour in what part of your body you feel stress the most. I have some muggle colouring pencils that you can use"
"You still here?" Draco heard a voice ask, he looked up to find Granger standing beside his table with a stack of books in her hands.
Harry buried his face again and then a second later found Draco not only sitting down on the couch he was on but sitting right beside him.
Hermione looked close to tears as she whispered, to the empty eighth year common room, "What if he never wakes up Ron"
"So you're telling me that Malfoy is my true love? Hermionie that's ridiculous! We hate each other!" Harry exclaimed throwing his arms in the air.
"It would be worth a try, we've already tried two other people, and if it doesn't well no one needs to know about it" Hermionie pleaded.
He brushed the thought off many times, especially because thinking of an answer would resurface that he had actually felt like this many times before, especially when he was younger. Shaking his head, he rubbed his face with his hands, running his fingers up through his hair and then finally looking up.
Hope I Portrayed this okay! I will update this when I get time. In the meantime tell me if you like this and what I could add!
At the end of the session, Harry felt slightly calmer, all the exercises seemed quite useful. But there was nothing wrong with him. Harry was fine. He had had breakdowns in the toilet before, nightmares in bed but that didn't mean anything. He was fine.
He reached for the egg carton box, flipping it open and taking one out. He cracked it onto the counter and cracked it open with ease, landing in the pan.
"Do you like guys as well? Sexuality is such a broad spectrum it's not just straight and gay. You can like both genders. You can only like one. You could like someone based on personality and not gender." Hermionie explained.
Truth be told Harry felt lonely, he couldn’t sleep. He felt just shit. Yeah just shit. Maybe he had that anxiety thing that professor was talking about. Who even cared, not like anything could make it any better. With his mind whirling he turned over yet again, closing his eyes he saw the dead faces of all the students who died because of him flash before him.
Harry's fingers touched where Draco had just kissed it and he beamed. Ron clapped Harry on the back when they went up to bed that night. That night Harry slept as soundlessly as log and as peacefully as a baby (when they don't cry)
He then linked our hands together and shoved my hands to either side of my head and leaned forward more, effectively trapping my arms. He tilted his head and changed the angle and I felt my mind going all fuzzy.
Okay, first smell was definetly sweaty feet, but Harry was used to that after living in those dorm rooms.
Harry coughed up his pumpkin juice. Was he feeling better? Are you joking? No he wasn't feeling better!
"Harry. Just be yourself, besides Draco's been watching you since forever he knows what your normal behaviour is"
"Okay so we're going to go through some exercises that can help calm anxiety." Mr Balmy said calmly.
I was in the dark forest, some centures were chasing me. I think Malfoy was there... And then he took my hand and.
At breakfast the next morning Draco was yawning dramatically over his coffee, he had found it hard to sleep last night. His head was floating with thoughts of Potter all night. One thought kept reoccurring and taunting him.
I didn't have time to reply before he sucked a lobe into his warm mouth. I squirmed, shocks raked my body. Then he gently bit further up and I'm not sure what happened but I moaned. Quite loudly.
Draco walked slowly over to where Harry lay, he looked so peaceful sleeping like this. It's now or never. Secretly he had been looking forward to this because when was he ever going to have the opportunity to kiss Potter again?  He poked Harry cheeks for the fun of it before cupping his cheek and closing his eyes. He leaned in and kissed Potter's lips, finding them soft. He pulled away and opened his eyes and then found Green vivid eyes staring up at him. It worked. What the hell it actually worked. What in Merlin's name... Draco scrabbled out of the room and closed the door hurriedly. He met Hermione's confused look by all but rushing out of the Hospital Wing. Hermionie was about to run after him but then the door opened and Harry stood there looking extremely confused.
They both laughed and then turned the corner to go into the great hall for dinner. It was just after Quiddich practise and after showering and sharing tips they had walked happily to dinner excited for the feast. As soon as they entered the Hall Harry felt a strange sensation running down his spine, then he felt his eyelids shutting on their own accord.
Now it was clear as day, but how to get Malofy to kiss Harry was the question. She supposed she ought to just have a talk but that last time they had 'talked' she had punched him square in the mouth, granted he had changed since but still it was risky. Wait. What if she became friends with Pansy and then... That might not work either seeing as Pansy seems to hex people a lot and she for one didn't want one of her 'special' hexes. Okay. She was going to talk to Malfoy tonight.
It wasn't long before Harry had been transported to the Hospital Wing and Madam Pomfery was fussing over him and waving her wand near Harry's head. Then abruptly she straitened up and rushed to a book cabinet.
"Hey Draco do you actually care about him? It's a bit strange that you were worried about him all of a sudden"
"Um...I think she's in the library. Wait why didn't you go there first if you were looking for a book?" Ron asked looking conspicuously at Malfoy.
Draco looked around, the first thing he saw was the white ceiling that had been bewitched with soft blue swirls. The second thing he saw was the carpet, which was soft and plump - like it was brand new. The third thing he saw was the wallpaper on the walls, it was a calming baby blue colour and had simple patterns that faded in and out of view. The fourth thing he noticed was Potter, he noticed how curly and insestintley messy it always was. And the last thing he noticed was Potter's hands which were nervously picking at a stray thread on his robes. Then Draco went to look up at Harry's hair again (for no particular reason - "I'm bored") and was met by none other than Potter's dazzling green eyes.
Harry relaxed slightly but still didn't reply. Then he felt fingers trying to pry away his cushion, he let them and then felt more vunrable than ever. Oh come on be brave! He bacically just said yes.
But there was no sign of him that evening...or the next. Ron had done a great job of tracking where he went during class but after he left the classroom he seemed to turn to a mist and disappear. So, they tried to find him - Harry's trunk had been taken the pervious night so they couldn't get the Muarders map - and they really didn't want to wait any longer.
The dark lord was dead. Everyone was celebrating despite all the loss that hung thickly in the air...well most everyone. It was the first day back at Hogwarts and people, who couldn't complete their education because of the war, had arrived back. Now, the tension still hung in the air especially when Draco Malfoy with silver blond hair hanging loose around his face, entered the great hall and sat down. Everyone looked shocked, well most everyone except Harry Potter who just looked disinterested. Now a week into the first term Draco Malfoy could tell something was up with Potter and he was concerned.
Hermionie kept an eye out for Draco the rest of the day, trying yo catch his eye but he did a very good job of pretending he didn't notice this.
Although Harry had a bit of a problem breathing in for seven seconds, if felt like.his chest was tight and he could only breathe in so much. And now he was paying attention to everything he noticed his heart beating loudly in his chest. And the more he noticed this the faster his heart started to beat.
Concentrating, Harry listened, and picked out the sound of someone breathing loudly. Diverting away from that he could hear the gently breeze as it blew in through a partially open window.
And oh. Oh. That was nice. I can feel shivers run down my skin. And then he did something amazing. He bit me. I mean normally I would be offended. Who even bites people? But all I could do was gasp and arch slightly.
Draco flashed a brilliant smile before leaning in and kissing Harry on the cheek. "I'll see you on Saturday at 11am. Don't be late"
He had to audacity to grin, making my stomach flip. I could almost feel Hermione saying something along the lines of "obsessed with Malfoy again?"
Harry peaked a look out from behind the cushion to see Draco standing there with his head tilted slightly and a grin on his face.
"Hi Draco" Hermione said quietly while notes. She could see Draco stare at her in her peripheral vision but continued on like all was well.
"Yeah well I'll go look in the library...Good job Granger by the way" Draco said as he moved to the door.
Hermionie gave Draco a thumbs up from across the table and he smiled before settling his attention back on Potter who was poking at his toast.
It was simple... Well not really, just get Malfoy to kiss Harry. She should had seen this coming: The constant talk about him, the obsession in sixth year and the looks they gave each other.
Okay, maybe he was too early but it did take 25 minutes to get to the front enterence...or sort of anyway.
"You're incredible" I whispered, turning my head to look at him. He was on his side looking quite spent but very very smug.
"Yes, well a muggle story caused by magic" Pomfery asserted and then sighed before continuing "Unfortunately the same circumstances must be held...only a true loves kiss will free him...now it's getting dark, I have Mr. Potter in safe hands. I will talk to the other teachers"
Potter did not look up at him again, and he was poking at his food, taking a bite of toast before excusing himself and leaving the great hall. Draco let him go this time, he would follow him again tonight.
"So your telling me Harry has to get a kiss from a true love or he'll never wake up? Bugger...but I've heard it can take years to find a true love!"
"Okay now anxiety has many different types, there's Generalised Anxiety Disorder, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Panic phobia and Social phobia just to mention a few. And some of the other teachers will go through some of these in more detail than I will.
Harry had held it out with wide scared eyes and almost not registering that it got pushed roughly directly onto the surface of the hot pan. The hot pain followed too sudden for him to cry out, he simply stood there and felt and smelt his hand burning.
Harry scoffed "and say what? Thanks for the kiss it really was a wake up call. Mind if we try that again? He's been avoiding me anyways"
The first class that day was Muggle Studies, Draco grabbed his heavy leather bookbag and swung over his shoulder with a sigh. He walked the corridors, the sound of his shoes mixing with hundreds of other students’ shoes and hushed chatter. When he lined up outside the classroom Potter was already there.
Suddenly Draco found himself pressed flush against against the rough bark of a damp tree with a wand pressed into the tip of his throat. Glaring deep green eyes and black shaggy hair met him.
Draco gave one last sour look before turning his full attention to the class. Hermionie sighed and chewed the inside of her lip; Malfoy was her last option thus far. Then a piece of ripped parchment got slid onto her page of notes as the class were dismissed. It read.  I'll think about it.
-	Can we be friends? I know we kinda hate each other but I don’t know about you, but some company would be nice. – Draco.
Harry flushed, his heart beating hard and fast in his chest. His head dropped immediately to stare at the floor and the frayed ends of his shoelaces. Why did I like seeing him blush? I don’t like boys. The Dursely’s always said how bad it was. It’s not like I’m gay or anything. Sure I notice guys more than girls but that is normal thank you very much.
"You don't have to know Harry, you don't have to label yourself just follow your heart. It's nearly breakfast time are you going to come?"
Mr. Smith is an expert in brain bio- chemistry and researched in great deal how the brain chemistry changes due to mental illness and stress. He had lost a family member close to him due to suicide and works to help others overcome their mental illness.
Miss Blake was a Professor in Obsessive Compulsive Disorders and Post Traumatic Stress Disorders. After her wife had arrived back from an Afghanistan war she saw her wife's constant nightmares. Miss Blake at the time didn't know the symptoms until she came home from work and found the note. It was then she had lost her wife and she went on courses to help people deal with it.
"Hey. You look amazing" came a voice to Harry left which Harry suddenly turned his head towards and wow. Draco was the one that looked amazing. He had whitewashed jeans, a dark grey t-shirt and wait...yes that was definelty some eyeliner but damn did it look good.
As the next week passed others seemed to notice this too and questioned him but they only got a one word awnser at best and an excuse to go do homework. It wasn't until Draco noticed Potters leg jumping one day under his desk that Draco tried in earnest to read Potter's body language. He was sitting upright, so paying attention? No. He must just be tense. He was fiddling so must be thinking about something or just uneasy. His eyes were set on a corner of the desk so definetly distracted. He was worrying his bottom lip in his teeth and so he must be worried about something but what? The dark lord was dead for heaven sake! But...suppose that left a scar mentally as most everyone had a scar or two in their minds because of the war.
"I had a really nice time" Draco mummered, looking directly into Harry's eyes before trailing down his face, resting on his lips for a second and then meeting Harry's eyes again. Harry smiled and sneaked a arm around Draco's waist pulling him even closer so now their faces were mere inches apart.
"So comfortably on your cushions and relax your shoulders. This exercise is a breathing exercise. You can close your eyes if it helps"
Harry sat and looked at his sheet of paper with the black outlines of a bodies. Now he thought about it he felt stressed an awful lot but it was a strange feeling in his chest like a tightness. So he coloured the chest area in and back. He thought about the tightness he got in his chest and frowned, it wasn't like it was occasional and most of the time he could feel his heart beat in his chest as well. It is just stress, everyone feels that way, grow up. His inner voice told him.
Now it had been two days and Ginny and Cho had had permission to kiss Harry but with no avail. He was still soundlessly asleep.
All of the year groups were split up to go see different professionals at different times and among those Professionals were: Mr. Blamy, Miss Blake, Mrs. Trixie and Mr. Smith.
"Due to recent events it has come to my attention that many pupils and teachers alike are suffering from mental illnesses. Now as it isn't but should be a known subject there is going to be a mental health awareness day next Friday and I have invited many professors with in depth knowledge about the subject along. And Mr Filch has asked for me to remind you that the third floor is still strictly forbidden."
"Okay, that was one method you can use to help ground yourself, to become aware of the present instead of the future and the past, now we'll move on to other exercises"
This really was causing a scene and it was starting to worry Ron. Now, he knew that Harry had passed out once because of Dementors and You-Know-Who but this seemed completely different; first off he looked peaceful which wouldn't happen if You-Know-Who was in his head again. Second off there weren't any dementors around.
Wait i get nightmares a lot, but some people are probably just more prone to that you're nothing special. Stop thinking it's important.
"Attention everyone!" McGonagall announced at breakfast the next day while Draco was nursing a cup of black coffee.
Without warning he fell to the ground. There were gasps in the room as people watched Harry Potter collapse. Ron crouched low, worry showing on his forehead. It didn't seem like anything was explicitly wrong with him on the contrary he looked almost peaceful. His chest was rising up and down in a rhythmic pattern but he just didn't wake up, not even when Hermionie slapped him - in a hope he had just fainted.
Very slowly, Potter tilts his head to one side, eyes narrowing in consideration before — in a move so quick that Draco couldn’t have predicted it even if he’d been expecting it —Potter grabs him by one elbow and drags him closer, bending slightly and pushing his nose into the crook of Draco’s neck, inhaling loud and deep. His skin is fever hot where he touches Draco, and frozen as he is in shocked fear, Draco finds that heat...
Roughly towelling his hair dry, Harry knocks and pushes into Malfoy’s room without waiting for an answer, padding over to where Malfoy is sitting up in bed with a little bit of a struggle and then leaning back against the headboard.
“Beg pardon?” But Malfoy only shook his head. Harry snorted and took a gulp of beer. “Have you even tried any?”
“I can try, I guess?” Potter laughs, catching Draco’s hand when he hits him on the shoulder, “I mean, I can try and be smugger the next time I eat you open until you can’t stand? I’d just have to eat you out
“Among other things,” Potter mumbles, before sighing and throwing his menu down once more, looking around restlessly. Upon Draco’s insistence they’re sitting outside, under the awning of the Muggle cafe down the street from Grimmauld. There isn’t much traffic here and passersby mostly just hurry along going about their day, not sparing them a glance – well, except Draco
wrong with his face – just the opposite, in fact. He’s really handso—” he breaks off and looks away determinedly, neck starting to prickle with embarrassment.
“Potter,” says a quiet voice in his ear as Harry’s arm starts to spout blood onto the freshly displayed textbooks in the window.
“He’s not going to settle on the first guy he enters a relationship with.” She looks rather confident about it and I do
Determined in his plans, Draco soaked for over an hour, gradually cooling off while also sulking about his ruined robes. That fucking ferret and its fucking nest full of Draco’s fancy things. It was all Weasley’s fault. No, wait—it was all
“I—I thought you might...” Draco feels himself paling as he flounders for an answer. “I didn’t want you to hate me,” he finally says lamely, stomach clenching when Harry lets out a mirthless snigger.
this whole thi--” Harry’s increasingly feverish rant is cut short as there’s a sharp knock on the ajar door and it’s pushed open.
, Potter,” Draco grits out after gaping at him for a few seconds, kneeing him in the side, jostling him lightly. “Do I seem the sort that has
"Yeah apparently loads of these things go undetected which is awful...oh I talked to McGonagall and she said a class would be set up ASAP"
“As you know this lesson is about muggle cooking, would you be able to give a demonstration showing how this fry pan works?”
I mean potter did have a rough life with his parents dying, him nearly dying countless times, his friends dying, well..now to think of it Potter had a life that a book character would have, tragic and upsetting. He is bound to have some kind of trauma after all that.
"You know, Harry, I would love to go on a date with you but seeing as you're trying to disparate into that pillow I would have to wait till you asked me" Draco continued stepping close to the couch.
“Why would he be coming here every night?” Draco asked to himself, pulling his cloak tighter around himself.
"Hey, we should go get some sleep" Ron suggested. Hermionie was lead up to her dorm room and she fell into an uneasy sleep.
It didn’t feel like a question. Suddenly all the attention was back on him and it felt very uncomfortable. He stood up and walked over to the front of the class standing in front of the cooking station, it was a typical gas stove. There was some food items sitting on the counter surface.
Mrs. Trixie was a Professor in neurology and studied in depth the impacts of mental health on the brain. She was the first one in the wizarding community to prove that depression wasn't just a sadness but an actual mental illness. Needless to say she because a well known name she runs a neurology clinic together while her husband works as a vet for magical animals.
I stammered some nonsense I'm sure. Being eloquent as always as Draco always says. This was definitely not what I thought was going to happen when he arrived at my door with wine and a smile.
Draco took a breath in, some part of his brain said to be stubborn. Take the no as a yes and not stop. The rest of the class had seemed to be preoccupied in their own mess and somehow Harry Potter, the boy who lived twice. Harry Potter who was probably the most famous 18-year-old had turned invisible to everyone around him.
Draco startled and pulled a face. Potter was staring at him from two tables across from him. The eye contact was held intensely for a few seconds before Draco forced a half smile unsure of what exactly to do or what the staring meant.
Harry nodded and both of them went on their way. Conversation was easy, which surprised Harry, it almost didn't feel as daunting now. And when Draco slipped his hand into Harry's, he found it the most natural thing.
That's how he ended up long, lean body warm on mine, his legs sitting warm and strong either side of my hips.
Then he did just that without a second to spare. Draco kissed like he fought. It was oh so intense and fierce. I couldn't help but recouporate and a pit of arousal lit up inside me. My hands flew up to rest on his chest, the smoothness of it was refreshing in a way.
Draco looked up and replied "oh...well I guess I do. During the war I went through an incredibly dark time and I don't want Potter to go through that because he knows he's got people who care he just needs some help going through whatever he's going through"
Hermionie jumped up in surprised and joy and quickly grabbed her dressing gown. She was met outside with Draco wearing an oversized grey T-shirt and silk pyjama bottoms.
Draco walked out of the session feeling relaxed and informed, he had no idea just how anxiety could cause different reactions in other people. He knew his mother suffered from anxiety during the war but he didn't know just how oblivious he had been to it.
Friends? Maybe a friend wouldn’t be too bad. He’ll think about it. With that thought in his mind Harry returned to bed and fell asleep surprisingly well all things considered.
This is very long overdue, anyways hope you enjoy. I wrote this due to my own personal experiences and working through difficult times.
The question threw me I'm not going to lie, I told him I liked making other people feel good. He rolled his eyes at that and held my eyes in a curious gaze.
He gripped and turned the dial listening to it click and smelling the lost familiar smell of gas, then pressing the button the create the spark. The flame appeared fiery red and hot with a crackle. The pupils watching looked very interested and impressed with how he had managed to do this well…magic.
"Welcome class, to the first session of mental health awareness day, my name is Mr. Blamy and before you ask I am Blamy!" There was a pause where the students laughed. "However some of you might not be. This is why we are having this day, many people don't even know it or know how to deal with it. Before we start we have some ground rules for this. Number 1. No judging. This topic may be very sensitive to some people so do not judge someone in this room or out of this room if something does come up for them. Number 2. Listen, listen listen. Don't talk over anybody and I'm sure by now you all know to raise your hand to answer any questions. But mostly listen to yourself. Listen to what you're feeling and thinking. Number 3. Get me out of here! If you can't manage then leave. If you just need the loo then give me a thumbs up and if something's come up then just leave and go the small room next door with the cubicles in them, I won't come find you unless you press the red button and need someone to talk to. Number 4. Confidential is important, don't go slabbering to someone that 'oh Jessica started crying today when Mr Barely or whatever started taking about anxiety'." He took a breath and looked at the students. "Last of all be truthful in what you say. This is an honest environment and there is no need to be ashamed or embarrassed. Now sit down, we have a lot to talk about!"
Harry’s hand flinched and he dropped the pan handle making a metallic clang onto the stove below. He was in a classroom. Someone was talking to him. He blinked the world coming back into focus, he looked at the source of the voice to be met by the concerned kind eyes of his professor.
Think of something I love? What do I think about. Mum and Dad? No that would make me sad. Friends? I don't know. Wait Hedwing. And her soft white feathers, and the way she would always nuzzle your hand if you were having a bad day. Yes, I think Hedwing could work.
