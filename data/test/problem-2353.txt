“Per your request.”
The crowd went wild. Martha went something beyond wild. “Yes!” she called out immediately. “Yes, I’ll marry you, baby!”
She ducked into her room, ignoring the suspicious stare from her mother. Sheesh, one accidental pregnancy and the woman didn’t even trust her anymore. “Yes, it is. Who’s asking?”
“So you knew him before the magazine?” Theo figured out.
The wolf-creature seemed to be busy looking at its map, and when Draco’s dragon swooped in closer he could see that the worgen was a paladin. Pffft. Easy kill, especially if the bastard was in his healing gear. Damage output decreased significantly in the wrong set of armor.
With a burst of laughter, Pansy figured that was true, but she really didn’t care. “Yeah, but if you think repeatedly shoving a prick into a girl’s twat is the best way to make her come without any other assistance, I pity the sex you’re having. I don’t miss blokes because Maggie is better than most blokes, and if I ever want to get fucked, we have quite a collection of toys.”
In a swirl of floo powder, a rush of voices rising in excitement and thousands of flashes of camera bulbs from the Daily Prophet, Draco and Harry stepped into one of the only parties that Draco could ever say rivaled a Pansy Parkinson party.
“We saved everything you ever gave us, Draco. Did you think we would just throw them out? I recall on several occasions your complaints about Harry Potter ‘ruining your life’.” Lucius couldn’t understand why Draco was getting so red in the face about that.
There were rarely times where Draco missed the one-night stands with men who snored, couldn't string two cohesive thoughts together, kicked in their sleep, and had awful breath, but there were times that he missed the selfishness of it all, the rush of leaving at three in the morning to never show up in someone's life again. It was tough to be a narcissist when one was surrounded by people so deserving of attention. At least Harry fed into Draco’s inflated sense of self.
Oh, fuck. Was the exclamation point too eager?
“Puppy! Puppy!”
“Wow,” Draco breathed out, an exhale of delight. “You look incredible.”
Harry followed her to another room, this one with black leather covering the walls and floor, a few leather couches to the side sat atop cages and a massive stage up against the wall where Harry recognized as a Leather ‘X’ like the one he’d been tied to in the ballroom of the Manor. A warm feeling stirred in his gut at the memory, like Draco was there pushing up his skirt again. He had to admit he was a little interested in the cages lining the walls, too.
Theodore Nott was always of the distinct opinion that Draco Malfoy was out of his mind, but nothing made him more anxious than when Draco agreed to meet these strangers in person. “Text me when you get there.”
Draco blamed Henry’s comatose state not only on the man’s weariness from the flight—California to Delaware was a haul for all of them—but also on his general lack of wit.
‘Speakerphone,’ Harry mouthed.
Harry slunk out from behind Draco and took the arm offered to him.
Draco, with some effort though he liked to think he was in-shape, carried Harry without the aid of a feather-weight charm. It was only a few meters away but still, the gesture was what mattered to Harry.
Slipping the ring back in his pocket, Theo made his way back to the front of the shop. He’d check on the potion in an hour like he usually did.
“Hey, I said nothing about settling down,” Draco shot back at her with a grin he hoped would win both parents over. They always had been loving, and weak to Draco’s protests should he not get what he wanted. It was why Draco was so damn spoiled.
Harry smiled to himself. Maybe they could be friends united in hatred of transportation. “Finally found something you hate more than me,” he remarked.
“Doesn’t matter.” Sirius bumped their heads together. “You’re the best.” He also thought the same of Remus, Olivia, and Harry’s parents, but the title of ‘the best’ still applied.
“I wish! How interesting would that be?” Draco laughed. “But it’s just some cold case from the first war. Remus and Sirius were apparently friends of the victim, too.”
Remus had emerged from his study moments later to laugh at the development in his renovations. If Walburga had seen the mess Sirius had made, she would have fainted, which would have made everyone else involved incredibly happy.
“Boys,” Ms. Umbridge said sweetly, her hands coming together and fingers intertwining like little sausages. “I’m sure you can work all of this out in detention hall after school.”
“Yes,” Draco laughed fondly. “Roots.”
“—and then they absolutely just go wild. They don’t even talk about it, but Ben summons some restraints and ties the other bloke up on his stomach—“
“Apparently,” Pansy snarked. “No amount of PCP, X, or GHB can make some people even remotely bearable.”
Before returning to his own group, Samuel whispered to Draco, “come find me later for a dance,” winked at him, and then left. Hermione and Pansy, giddy with excitement, nearly squealed while their eyes lit up.
Those memories of his first time with Harry hit Draco like a truck the second he stepped into the bar. Determined to not let him win again, he continued deeper into the venue, the music continually growing louder, until the three settled on a table by the bar.
“About what?” He asked, already knowing what was to come.
He made it to the closest alleyway before apparating back home, where he fell into a heap on his sofa, all the emotions he had felt when they first broke up resurging as if no time had passed at all. Seeing Harry, with the same stupid, messy hair and the maroon knitted sweater he always wore, and those soft, green eyes which Draco only knew to portray Harry’s caring nature, made Draco aware that he may never move on from the other man. And it was stupid, pathetic really, but all Draco could imagine was someone else was running his hands through that hair, someone else having the privilege of holding him, feeling his love that seemed to be endless.
As if he deserves that after what he did to him?
I also may not be able to stick to my updating schedule over the next month as I have my final exams for high school and haven't been writing as often. In advance, I thank you for your patience :)
To make up for it, here are two new chapters! Enjoy :)
Within the hour, Narcissa responded, overjoyed at the prospect of seeing her son. Once Draco received her reply, he threw together a bag and was gone in an instant.
“Hello there,” Draco quipped, trying to figure as to why he had taken the seat right next to him when there was plenty of room. Having been acknowledged, the other man turned to him, smiling.
Harry stared at him, at a loss of what to do, for what felt like an eternity to Draco, who could feel his heart shattering with each passing second. Draco went to leave to any other room but this one, before turning back to take one last look at Harry. His Harry. The one who had shown him that vulnerability should not be feared, that he wasn’t a horrible person, that he was deserving of love. Except now it seemed that the amount of love he deserved was finite, and very quickly coming to an end.
Sooo I wrote a chapter (not this one) and I got so excited by it that I felt like giving you guys another update! I am seeing a lot of dislike of Harry, which I am glad to see because he is definitely not a good guy for much of this series! I am so glad you are all enjoying this fic, it is my baby and the fact that people love it makes me so happy! Thank you all so much <3
Upon arrival to the quaint cottage, Draco is met with the icy, mid-November air biting at his skin, and rainfall just heavy enough to make standing around uncomfortable. He is quick to knock on the door, and even quicker to step inside and hug his mother. She was even frailer than he remembered, the years of stress and her age catching up to her. Her hair seemed sparse, and when he hugged her, it was as if she was made of nothing but skin and bones.
The knowledge that the so-called saviour of the Wizarding World could do this to her son,
“Draco, please. Just hear me out,” Harry pleaded to him.
Draco had been pining over Harry Potter for well over a month now, and no matter what he did, he could not get over it. He would go for a few days, feeling as if he was finally moving on from the ridiculous crush, one that would never come to fruition, before bumping into Potter or seeing him at their weekly drunken escapades, and he would be back where he started.
One day, on one of his better days, he made the decision to go for a walk. He had gotten so lost in his own mind that he hadn’t realised he had walked up the stairs to Harry’s apartment, and had rung the doorbell. Mortified, he came to the realisation that there was no chance of escaping the awkward encounter.
“I already told you. I didn’t mean to, I was lost in my thoughts and didn’t realise what I was doing. I’m sorry I bothered you, now please leave,” Draco walked inside, and tried to shut the door on Harry, who held it open.
The next man the girls chose for him was actually decent. The dinner was tolerable, and he was a seemingly good guy, so they arranged a second date. And although he was alright with the fact of Draco’s past, the sight of the tattoo that protruded on his left arm left him visibly shocked, even shaking, so Draco knew there was no chance of it progressing further than it already had.
“Draco, here,” Hermione handed him his tea, surprising him by her presence.
A big thank you to everyone who has read this so far, it means a lot to me!
He still can recall the exact moment he realised he and Harry would not last. It was two days before Harry had ended it, and Draco noticed how the look in his eyes had changed, and that the nights they spent together were growing strangely cold. He now knew that Harry didn’t feel the same anymore, yet he held on until Harry pulled the trigger, clinging desperately on to the tiny chance that he was imagining it.
He woke again, this time with the winter sunlight streaming in through the gap in the curtains, and the sounds of Narcissa drinking her tea in the kitchen. Draco stretched, then realised what had woken him. A persistent tapping coming from the window.
His first date was a complete disaster. Although he was decent looking, the man was evidently a wannabe dark wizard, who exclusively spoke in great admiration of Voldemort, as if he could have succeeded at becoming a death eater. How pathetic.
To make it worse, he knew that if Harry were to walk in and apologise, ask for forgiveness and beg of Draco to take him back, he would do it in a heartbeat. Draco would ruin himself a million times over if it meant Harry could be his once again.
I definitely feel a bit sad for Harry, but he is also incredibly flawed so he annoys me so much!
Over the course of Draco’s relationship with her best friend, he and Hermione grew to be extremely close, with each of them relying on each other for everything. All Hermione wanted was for her best friend to become himself again, yet all efforts made brought no tangible results.
Enough from me, now enjoy the update <3
Days later, when he finally managed to work his way out of the emotional spiral seeing Harry had sent him down, he worked up the courage to go shopping for groceries. Or, more realistically, he had run out of food and needed to go out. His shopping trip was normal enough, he made small talk with the cashier, and made the short walk home. At least, it was normal, until he arrived home to a very distressed Harry Potter.
Hi there! Thank you everybody for your patience and understanding for the past month while I've been MIA.
“So, what are we drinking tonight, ladies?” He asked the two girls, holding open a cocktail menu.
“Oh, a gin and tonic, and a pink martini, thank you,” Draco glanced at his face. While he did not have the same features that Harry had, which Draco still adored, he was attractive enough. He had long, dark hair, which complemented his striking dark features. He was also fairly fit, with his tight, fitted shirt outlining the curves of bicep muscles, clearly from playing quidditch. While not quite the Chosen One, he would be enough to distract him for the night, along with copious amounts of liquor.
“This round is on me, I will be back in a moment,” Draco went up to the bar, and took a seat while waiting to be served. He sat, looking at the menu trying to decide on what to order. Not even a minute had passed, when a shorter, yet older man sat to his right.
“He is somebody I just met,” Draco explained, wanting the girls to forget about it, albeit they never would. “Can we please talk about something else? Hermione, how is the Ministry?"
Of course, he had doubts about his decision, especially when he saw the gut-wrenching look on his love’s face the day he ended it, but he simply could not continue the way he was, and from what Hermione had told him, Draco had finally been able to overcome the loss and stand alone, which is all Harry ever wanted for him.
Narcissa responded by joining him, and took him into her arms. “Shhh. It’s okay.”
I think we allll know where this is going ;)
“Oh Merlin, I thought you had left for good," his worry-stricken face hitting Draco like a bludger to the stomach.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah I’m ready, just give me a moment to get some shoes on,” Harry smiled back at his partner. They had only been dating for 11 months, but everything felt so right that it seemed like they had spent 20 years together. Unlike Draco, Finn managed to be warm around everyone, rather than wearing a constant sneer on his face and glowering at any given moment. And it wasn’t like he didn’t love Draco, because he did. That man somehow managed to turn his world upside down and make him feel alive, but it burdened Harry that the world would never truly approve of his choice. So, to save everyone from heartache in the future, he decided it would be best to end it.
Except he never left Draco’s life, because all that occupied his thoughts was the golden boy, with his stupid hair and stupid glasses.
?” Draco asked.
The flaming serpents, chimeras, and dragons rose again. Draco felt as if they were coming straight for him. He was sat on top of some desks alongside Goyle’s stiff body. The flames kept rising. He doubted that they’d ever stop.
“Sure. Do you want to see a movie?”
"How many new dorms were built?"
“What did you expect? Most people don’t even know what ‘bisexual’ means,” Draco rolled his eyes and offered Harry another cigarette.
"And you, Potter?" she smiled back.
"Andromeda, do I look okay?" Harry asked. He was dressed in a light gold jumper, his Gryffindor scarf, and blue jeans.
"It's okay," Harry said.
The kids were instructed to read silently, but were allowed to ask questions about word meanings or pronunciations. Harry soon discovered that the children didn’t raise their hands for him to help them, but rather for him to give them attention.
Draco sighed deeply, frustrated with his mother’s impatience and stubbornness. She had been sending him at least two letters a week since Christmas. He had cut off contact with her after they visited his father in Azkaban. Azkaban wasn’t the same as the last time he saw it—back when the war was still going on. There were hardly any dementors left, but the prisoners were still kept in nearly solitary cells. The only time they saw people that weren’t in the cell directly across from theirs was during cell checks, meal times, and visiting.
"Huh?" Harry was drug out of his thoughts.
He looked around before he ran. He ran away like the bloody coward he’d always been. He cursed himself before apparting, mid-day, back to his home.
"Algebra? I'm in Calculus."
“How much?”
“That’s what you do when you ‘square’ a number. You multiply it by itself. What’s your name, sweetie?”
“Okay, so I figure that we can make goody bags for everyone that comes to the party. It won’t be that taxing because it’s only Narcissa, Draco, Arthur, Molly, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Fleur, Bill, George, Angelina, Percy, and...Charles, I think?”
“But he’d be seventy-five…”
“Woah,” the blonde mouthed.
.          Harry journeyed to his SALC class after a surprisingly good night of sleep. He arrived a bit early and was even seated before Malfoy walked in.

Harry stood up right as the professor announced, “Hello, class! Please take your seats. We will begin now.” Harry sat back down and placed his bag at his feet. How did he have such rotten luck? Of
Andromeda let out a small chuckle. She turned the stove off.
“Yes! Oh my God. We can dress Teddy up!”
“Oh, he’s taking a nap. Listen, I’ve started to plan our party and the decorations we need.”
“Wait,
"I don't think that—"
“You mean...you didn’t?” Hermione asked. Harry shook his head.
“No, sir.”
After Harry smoked a cigarettes, he came inside and declared, “Great night, last night.”
“Maybe fifth,” Hermione added.
Why couldn't he just make someone proud?
,” Draco said, moving his hands for extra dramatic flair.
At that time, the fat white cat came running through the room at full speed. It knocked over a table. Harry jumped and it ran the other way.
“Mmm…” Harry replied.
The rest of Harry’s day was uneventful. He had Criminal Justice 101, which he only took because he did not know what to take. He had chosen his classes almost at random.
bloody hot. Draco couldn’t breathe. He couldn’t think. It was all just so hot and smothering.
He was sat beside Neville, Seamus, and Dean, contemplating the afterlife. Suddenly, all of Professor Wilkins's lessons about "existential angst" made sense. He wondered if anyone would ever write a book about his own angst. If his life at Hogwarts would entertain some… Harry decided that he didn't care.
She nodded and held up her left hand. A golden ring, topped with a ruby, glittered in front of Harry’s eyes.
The door sounded at 8:55, and Andromeda welcomed Ron and Hermione in. Harry took a deep and shaky breath. She brought them into the kitchen and Harry set the table. Ron and Hermione embraced Harry with hugs.
After they ate, they sat in the car for a few minutes.
politics? I hate it.”
I will be making a sequel of this story! I hope for it to be longer and much more elaborate. (school, money tw): I don't know when I can start writing it or when I can start publishing it because I still have a lot of work to do for college (financial aid, etc) and graduation, but I intend to start ASAP. Thank you all for being so wonderful and sticking by this story!
“Hey, mate. You doing okay?” the ginger asked.
“Oh.”
, he thought,
“It’s almost like math makes sense now,” added Harry.
Harry still didn't know if he trusted her. After growing up with the Dursleys, hearing about "shrinks" and how mental health is "bullshit," he still couldn't help but feel that all of this was stupid. He'd only gotten a therapist in the first place due to Hermione's pushing. He never expected to go to therapy for this long. He never expected it to help. He never expected to get so attached to his therapist. He looked up from his lap. Dr. Shelly was watching him.
“Wow,” he said. “Is that..?”
“After the war. Andromeda was smoking and I figured that it would relieve stress. Also, why did you start then? Cigarettes are muggle things, right?”
"I don't know," Harry answered truthfully. "What are you going to do after university?"
out of you as a ghost.”
Draco nodded.
“No, no. It’s okay.” Draco gave him a sincere smile.
“Who?”
Today was the fifth of November—a British muggle holiday, but Andromeda wanted it to be an excuse to get together with Narcissa and Draco. They had a dinner scheduled for 5 PM that evening and Harry was eagerly awaiting it. Since Halloween, he had really begun to enjoy—and even crave—spending time with Draco.
"Be careful. Too much of that could hurt you."
His therapist called it “Imposter Syndrome.” He was so tired of being diagnosed with bullshit. He put down his coffee. Maybe he’d had too much. He just wanted to go home and have more coffee and take a stupid depression nap and wait for his mail.
Harry laughed, "Probably."
“Je sais, mais je voudrais te voire manger plus de la nourriture [I know, but I would like to see you eat more food.],” she replied.
“What?”
Harry replied wearily, "I'm tired of fighting. Voldemort is dead, why prolong the war?" He paused when he noticed that Malfoy flinched when he said "Voldemort." Harry added, "You shouldn't be scared. He's not coming back, you know.
Harry spoke up, “Y’know, Andromeda is really proud of me for being so honest with my feelings.”
“Oh, yeah,” Draco replied. “Do you know what you’re going to major in yet?”
"How are you
“Well, I, like Auror Escobar, used to be a high level auror. We were partners, and we were working on a very specific mission to figure out Death Eater business in France…”
When he arrived at the university, he felt like he was in a different world. He’d spent so long assimilating to muggle life, yet he was still attempting to grasp an understanding of muggle reliance upon household appliances and cars and the like. He felt terrified of the university. He swallowed the fear back and searched for a different feeling: adrenaline. He’d always been a fan of adrenaline. It felt like every drug he’d ever done but more natural. A few people stared at him as he just stood at the university entrance. He sighed and walked towards the admissions building.
"If Headmistress McGonagall will hire me," Harry revealed.
“You’re scared!”
“I’ll go,” Neville volunteered. “Anyone wanna join me? There’s no way I can carry everything.”
The doorbell rang again and Harry welcomed Narcissa in. Harry mentally noted that she and Draco still were not close enough to travel together. He let Narcissa, Draco, and Andromeda chat while he carved the turkey and set the table. Harry carried Teddy over to the table and placed him in his high chair.
He stopped in front of the Williamson Building.
Draco bit his lip and held out his fist. Sally glared at him and held out hers.
Draco took a sip of coffee, unsuccessfully disguising his reluctance to answer with dehydration. He commented, “I don’t know.”
.          “Oh, well, yeah. He does. He’s very smart. Can you count to ten for Draco, Teddy?” Andromeda bounced the child,
Draco finally spoke up, "So, I've made up my mind."
Draco nodded. He looked down at his lap in shame.
Wow! You made it all the way through. Thank you so much!
“Harry,” his therapist began, “I think that it is time for me to confirm our previous diagnosis of your PTSD. Perhaps it would pay off if you attended bimonthly meetings for post-traumatic stress disorder, along with attending your weekly therapy sessions. If your sleeping problems persist, then we can talk about medication.”
It was fifteen ‘til nine when Harry arrived at the Ministry. He sulked around the front entrance of the Auror Training Area for a few more minutes. He could not stress how much he hated Mondays. It was always class for three hours, lunch, class, a small break, and some sort of “practical” activity or exercise. The class line-up was almost always the same: ninety minutes of Dark Charm and Spell Disarmament and another ninety minutes of Stealth and Tracking. They would have lunch, and at 12:45, they would have forty-five minutes of an intense theory class. Usually it was Poison and Potions, but sometimes it was something more boring like Ancient Runes and Other Old Wizard Languages or Anti-Deadly Disease Wards. Harry disliked theory, but he considered it to be worth the end-of-day activity. He absolutely hated sitting still at a desk learning about the differences between the Polio Hex and the Spattergroit Spell. He needed to experience what he was learning to retain any information.
Harry continued his week like normal, not sure what to do with his newfound knowledge. He’d be lying if he said that he hadn’t thought about it. He had. It confused him so much because didn’t people always know their sexualities? How could you like someone and not even know it? Harry didn’t want to admit it, but he was scared. He’d read books and watched movies and everyone in them swore that this sort of thing didn’t change a person. But Harry felt changed. He felt like he’d found a missing part of himself. He felt like he found a lifelong secret. He felt like he’d finally taken a breath of fresh air after almost drowning.

.          “He likes hair a lot,” Harry admitted, attempting to defuse the situation.
His speech was predictable. It felt like some cookie cutter bullshit from another green-eyed teen picked for a random prophecy to save the world as it was known. It was about death and sorrow and forgiveness and hope and ghosts. Maybe he’d spent too much time reading YA dystopian novels in the past year. Nevertheless, everyone congratulated him. “It was great, Harry!” “Wow, you really have a way with words!” “That was beautiful!” “It made me cry—it was so great!” He didn’t know how to tell them that he bullshitted it.
Draco was walking home with Sally now. At first, she’d attempted to make conversation, but now she had stopped. An eerie silence filled the air. Draco didn’t mind silence so much. It usually helped him think and plan. Then again, that was when he wasn’t high on meth.
lived it—not her?
“Bloody hell!” Ron yelled loudly. He had been scrubbing at his face for over thirty minutes, and he still could not take off the greenish-brown paint from his face. Their activity for the day was Concealment and Disguise. While many others decided to make themselves invisible through charms or potions, Harry and Ron stuck to a more natural approach.
.          “I’m seeking a master’s degree in history.” Harry saw him clench his fists. His Adam’s Apple bobbed a bit as he swallowed some discomfort. Was Malfoy scared? Why was he scared? “Muggle history,” Malfoy clarified.
“Enough sarcasm! Draco, that’s dangerous.”
"Hmm…" Draco replied. Harry laughed, and Draco giggled, stating, "I love you."
“Hmm,” she made a noise as if she didn’t believe him. “Okay. We have been working together for over a year. I believe that it is time for us to discuss you.”
“Hi, Davie,” Harry said. “I am nineteen years old, and I’ll turn twenty on the thirty-first of July.”
She nodded, evidently understanding. Draco didn’t know what she understood. He didn’t even understand. She ordered the drinks, including the special and another plate of nachos, then she sat back down. It was clear that she wanted to fetch the drinks alone, as she requested a tray from Xavier. The newbie complied. Draco didn’t know if he’d comply. He also didn’t know why that mattered.
“You really have to expand your vocabulary.”
, Draco thought—and he was sure to think it this time. He sighed. “I accidentally took some meth.”
have a bit of a problem with would be Constructing Archaic Greek History, but even that shouldn’t affect his GPA since he expected to be the top of his general SALC course—Standing on the Shoulders of Giants. It was just an introduction to philosophy, art, language, and history. He smirked to himself. Maybe he’d be good at something again.
. [I don’t have the time (wrong word used to show lack of Spanish skills) to listen to you (informal use of “you;” meant to disrespect). Sorry. Go to hell/go fuck yourself.]”
“Hey?”
“I know…”
Harry smiled. “Yes.”
“One,” She said.
Draco
“I, um, am okay.”
long. Harry's mouth was feeling a bit dry. He suddenly remembered the night he visited the university. He thought of how dry the Dreamless Sleep Potion made his mouth, and he wondered if all types of drug-like stuff made him this way.
“Oh..I guess I haven’t. I’ve never thought about identity being important.”
“Why French?”
“Obviously not if he could coax
Draco sighed, “Why do you care?”
“Well,” Andromeda started. “Narcissa and Draco have made up. I received an owl from her, and she is in happy tears. I don’t think you realize how relieved she is. My sister spent most of the past year worried about her son’s mental health. Nevertheless, I have decided to invite them over for the weekend. If that’s okay with you, of course.”
“He’s gonna be proud of us for coming.”
“Hey! How have you two been?” Harry cheerfully addressed the couple.
.          “He changed, you know,” Harry rushed. “Regulus. He changed. When I was trying to locate the horcruxes to defeat Voldemort, I found out that Regulus destroyed the first one. He switched sides and sacrificed himself.”
“Christmas shopping.”
“I dunno,” Harry replied. “Ron and ‘Mione. Maybe your mum…”
The sales assistant nodded.
he failed the course alongside whatever other assignments he had had. What the hell was he going to do now?
“Hmm…was it Neville?”
“You do know who Astoria is, right? Daphne’s younger sister. Lovely girl, but c’mon! It just...it all showed that my mother didn’t really care nor support me.”
“You sure?”
"I do, but I like magic more," he admitted.
“Accio key,” Harry called before he thought. He closed his eyes and braced for the worse, waiting for something like the Gringotts trap. The key flew into his hand. Nothing else appeared to happen. He walked across the room and unlocked the door. He stepped into the fourth room.
Harry inhaled. He did his breathing exercises. “My therapist is going to be really proud of me for talking about my feelings. So I’m going to be straight-forward: I like you…in a, y’know, romantic way. I was wondering if you felt the same and what those kisses meant to you.”
The silent mourning was over and some people began to chat. Harry overheard Neville tell Seamus and Dean, "Yeah, McGonagall reckons that we'll need two professors for each subject, like Firenze and Trelawney did for Divination, because there are going to be so many first years. I guess people had tons of babies in '89."
” Harry exclaimed in disbelief. He checked the clock in the kitchen. “How? I know I didn’t sleep for 14 hours!”
, no.”
. He especially wouldn’t be annoying about the twink, who always closes, dyeing his hair a new color.”
he thought. He laid his head down. Now he understood why his father hated pronouns. It was so hard to tell who “they” was in this thought even though he was the one doing the thinking.
"I bet she will," Luna reassured him.
“Damn the man,” Harry joked.
"You were a really good teacher in the DA," Dean said.
Today was going to be a rather busy day. He had a meeting with an advisor at the College of Arts, Languages, and Cultures at the University of Manchester. He had declared his course, and now he needed to enroll in his classes. He also had to re-affirm his off-campus housing. School was going to be in session mid-September, and there were still many forms left to fill out. It was hard to not feel overwhelmed, but Draco was trying. God, was he trying.
is coming out with a sequel prequel.”
“Cats have a
“Seriously, what in the bloody hell is a twink?” He asked again.
“Yes, but have I ever not kept my promises?”
Both men had awaited this day with anticipation, yet for different reasons. Harry was worried that this one date could make or break their relationship—a gross oversimplification. Draco was worried that Harry would finally learn just how evil he really was—some unfair self-deprecation.
it came in the post. He didn’t know why he felt so nervous other than the fact that the last time he went to a muggle school he got the crap beaten out of him nearly every day. University surely couldn’t be the same, he reminded himself.
"Yes, and that is why I think that this roll is perfect for you. We need someone talented and intelligent, yes, but also humble and gentle."
They shook hands, and the man showed Harry the schedule for the sixth year students. He would be assisting Ms. Claire’s reading and math classes, as well as overseeing recess. Then he would leave during lunch.
They continued their lunch by nibbling mozzarella sticks, smoking, drinking water, and talking.
Draco was already on his second shot and third beer, and holy shit, the pub was busy. He and his coworkers had not had time for a simple bathroom break since the cheese fry incident. He checked his watch again and groaned when he saw the hour hand slowly ebb just past the “2.” He made another few margaritas and rejoiced for the end of Happy Hour. Leaning against the counter, he watched as Fab took orders of cheese fries and beer. He was so grateful for her and Sally.
"How are you, Harry?" Luna said with her sing-song voice.
“Notice how it doesn’t have a diamond,” said Hermione.
Harry soon decided to stop waiting by the door and started to socialize. After talking to the Weasleys for ten minutes, he and Ginny set off to converse.
“Harry James Potter,” Andromeda started, placing her pizza slice on her plate and forcing eye contact between them, “you are anything but weak.”
They all ate lunch at noon and then went their separate ways. Andromeda went to her room to mix the candy together in bowls and to change into her costume—Greek mythology’s Medusa. Harry put Teddy down for a nap and then headed to the kitchen in order to make brownies.
starting PTSD meetings, he still had problems sleeping. He rolled over in bed so that he could face his alarm clock. “Lumos,” he said. It read 4:06.
Harry’s week just before classes began was dedicated to familiarizing himself with his apartment, Manchester, and the university. Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Luna, Dean, Seamus, and Neville helped Harry move some of his belongings to his newly remodeled flat, a modest one-bedroom near Victoria Park. They’d spent a few days doing some light partying, strangely joined by Hermione, and visiting some tourist attractions.
He moved the thought from his head and considered his short-term goals: pass all of his classes and buy some amazing Christmas presents for everyone. He made a list of what he wanted to buy and roughly how much all of it would cost. Early planner? One could say that.
remember his father’s behavior changing slowly.
He saw Draco blush and they approached Andromeda in the kitchen.
.          “Draco, just, um, just grab his hand and take it off your head,” Andromeda directed.
The cold water at first calmed him, but it only took a minute or two for him to realize that the hot water heater had broken again. Being a shitty building, it was often that the residents would have to rely on cold water if
----------------------------------------
of July, and he finally felt like things were going to be better someday. He felt like a weight been lifted off his chest. He still felt overwhelmingly sad, of course. He still had those dumb nightmares and nights where he just couldn’t get to sleep, but he was slowly getting better.
“I think that we’re all hypocrites sometimes.”
he thought
“What’d you say, mate?” Ron asked him. The ginger was holding onto Hermione’s hand as she led him through the bar.
“Is that even a question?” Harry answered, “Dino nuggets.”
“Good morning, you must be Harry,” the man said.
“Woah, Hermione. You could, like, go to Harvard or something,” Harry said, astonished.
“So I was thinking that we could go out to eat for New Year’s Eve,” Andromeda stated.
“Grand.” And with that, Malfoy walked off.
“That sounds great.” Harry paused and watched Andromeda stir the caramel concoction. “Um...I-I need to ask you something.”
Bed or time out?"
“Uh, sure,” Draco said, skeptically.
“Don’t tell me the rumors are true!” Dean said, faking a gasp.
“Yes, of course,” Andromeda answered. She put Teddy’s second shoe on him and picked him up. “Shall we?”
“It’s okay, Harry. It’s okay. In through the nose, count to four, out through the mouth.”
“I am fine. What brings you here?”
“Was he a
“Harry,
.          “Oh, yeah. He, um, he goes to school here too,” Harry affirmed, but his voice seemed to be lost in the wind. Andromeda kept her eyes on the lanky blond man.
Two weeks had passed and it was now the beginning of October. Malfoy and Harry had sat next to each other in classes and did speak on occasion. Their friendship consisted of a mutual desire for respectful silence and careful understanding. It was certainly the strangest friendship that Harry had ever had— and not just because the friend in question was an ex-Death Eater, ex-bully, ex-traitor. Malfoy was probably the only person with whom Harry had interacted that didn’t talk about the war in a way that made it sound like some horrible historical event. He spoke about it in such a way that made it sound like a fact. And, in some way, Harry and Malfoy had an unspoken pact: if they both wanted to talk about it, they’d talk about it; if not, neither would bring it up.
"Yes, I do. I'm tired of fucking up and then not apologizing for "
He fetched the bottle of water out of the mini-fridge under the counter. He went over the order again in his head, causing him to remember the stupid nachos deal. He took a deep breath and went to inform Longbottom and Potter. Suddenly, Draco froze. Would he talk to Longbottom, someone whom he never interacted with except to bully? Well, unless you consider the events of the Battle of Hogwarts, which Draco didn’t. He’d tried his best to shut it out. God damn, he really needed a drink. He looked back at Potter, who was too drunk to tell his left hand from his right.
“Potter!” Malfoy yelled. He did not seem happy, and so Harry was taken aback. Why was Malfoy so pissed off?
I’m doing well, by the way. How are you? Are you ready for your new classes? What’s your schedule?I’m pretty excited for the semester Do you have any plans for the rest of break?
“Okay. Alright. Have a good night, Jerry.”
"Most classes don't start for another thirty minutes, Malfoy."
“No.”
Harry didn’t think that he could stomach anything this morning, so he skipped breakfast. His heart had yet to completely regulate its beats and to get out of the fight-or-flight mentality. He felt like such an idiot having to skip breakfast because he had a little nightmare. His therapist told him repeatedly that nightmares were common with PTSD, but Harry still wasn’t completely sure. He showered and dressed, attempting to excite himself that today was Tuesday, a practical day. Although he normally enjoyed the spell battles and physical activities, he didn’t know how he could handle it. He still felt like an idiot. This is just a bad day, he reminded himself. Harry grabbed a cereal bar from the pantry and swallowed his anxiety.
Malfoy blinked in surprised and replied, “It’s— um— okay. I forgive you.”
"Can I?" Harry swallowed some of his fear.
“French Aa at 6.”
They nodded.
Harry was running. He was being chased, and he knew that he would be killed if caught. He quickly hid behind a tree to take in his surroundings. It was a dark, foggy forest, and a weird, blue-ish gray tinge had set over the atmosphere. He drew several deep breaths and reached for his wand. It wasn’t in his back pocket. He checked his other pockets and his waistband and the ground, and he just couldn’t find it. He began to hyperventilate. He ran again—this time not knowing how he would get away or where he would even go. Harry heard the same cold, sinister laugh as he had heard the 2nd of May however many years ago. He couldn’t think. He couldn’t breathe. He started screaming.
She bit her lip, “I don’t know…I don’t think that…”
“Yeah?”
Andromeda handed Harry two slices of pizza and some breadsticks, got herself the same, and gave Teddy a fruit cup and milk.
His therapist warned him that he shouldn’t focus on being “normal:” he should strive to be more optimistic about the “good days.” Harry normally saw Dr. Shelly once or twice a month, but they set up an emergency session on the 3
“Malfoy?” George asked.
Andromeda’s next plan that would allow their relationships to progress was small participation in Halloween celebrations. This was significant to Harry because he was not sure how this would impact him in his grief. Last Halloween, he spent the entire day paying his respects not only to his parents, but to all of those whom had died due to Voldemort. It wasn’t some sort of self-pity thing, in Harry’s opinion, but rather a means of remembrance.
“Hey, come on in,” the blond said.
As he stepped out of the closet, the shift manager, Jerry, walked by.
“Um,” Harry said. “I still have Andromeda and Ron and Hermione and everyone else…Do you want to do wizarding shopping or muggle shopping first?”
"There were a little less than 300 when you were here in your first year."
“Oh…” Harry said. He felt a little awkward because he wasn’t sure what was supposed to happen next.
“George.”
Draco ate a peanut butter sandwich and a banana before heading off to the university. He was excited and nervous, so bloody nervous, about what he was going to do. The part that still killed him was that he didn’t know if he was doing this to make himself happy or to make his parents angry. As long as he enjoyed it, did it really matter? The kicker was what he was going to study: Ancient History and Theology. His father thought that wizarding history was shit—all written by left extremists to convince wizarding society that slavery and blood purity were wrong. He would have a shit if he knew that his heir was studying muggle history. Draco didn’t know how much of a shit to give.
"I think that I'll just stick to muggle education."
“Draco Malfoy.”
“Professor McGonagall said that anyone is welcome,” Harry retorted.
Harry and Ron finished their lunches just in time for their next lesson. Once everyone arrived in the classroom, Professor Thompson wrote their subject on the board in utter silence. All the trainees groaned loudly once they saw “Advanced Charm Theory” written in thick, white chalk.
"Harry, thank you so much."
“1. It is not your fault.
“Où? Ici! [Where? Here!]”
drifted off to sleep, but this was progress. Harry was slowly getting ready for his 11AM therapy appointment. He got up from the loveseat on the porch, put his cigarette out, and went back inside. Andromeda was bathing Teddy, so Harry decided that he would make them all breakfast. He made a few crumpets, cooked scrambled eggs, and cut up some fruit for Teddy.
“To know if you’re okay,” Harry replied. Malfoy let out a shaky breath and shook his head.
"That sounds good. Are you experiencing any other bad side effects?" She took out her clipboard and pen.
“No, I picked her up from the pound. She was already named. Besides, I wouldn’t name a cat ‘Halloween’ either,” Draco replied, pointing to the brown and orange cat.
Harry stopped after he got inside the doorway. The course looked much different than he expected: it was like a long, wooden cabin. There was some broken furniture inside of it. It appeared that the walls were spelled so that the partners could not hear each other nor the people on the outside. Harry took another look around.
What about hobbies? The last Harry could truly remember having free time was third year, and that was six years ago.
“Wh-why are you here?” Harry sputtered.
Yet, he couldn’t stay home, either. Andromeda was worried about him, and this wouldn’t help his case. He knew what he had to do. He went upstairs, took a shower, and got dressed. He made himself some eggs and coffee. He ate slowly and then went outside to smoke. He went back inside and grabbed his invisibility cloak so that he could apparate to Diagon Alley in peace. He just had to be sure to come back around 4.
“My hair is a little different than yours and Sally’s though.”
"How do you feel about all these life changes? Do they make you feel unstable?"
“Okay. Yeah. That’s fine. G’night, Andy,” he responded. He hugged her and sat back down to eat his spaghetti.
Harry was cut off by Andromeda’s sudden hug. She had put her wooden spoon down and turned the heat on the stove down to “low.”
“Are you okay?” Sally asked. Concern filled her voice, and she moved her hand as if to check his forehead for a fever. At the last second, she must have decided that that was a silly idea because she jerked her hand away. Draco realized that they had never actually touched each other or hugged. He didn’t know why he cared.
"You do? That's fantastic! Where at?" she leaned towards him. Harry knew that she was very particular about her body language. Sometimes he wondered if her personality around him was simply a façade she put up for patients.
Draco scooped both of them up in his arms and carried them to another room. He came back and said, “Hope you’re not allergic to cats.”
“Draco,” Harry said. “You sound like one of those Americans that wants to speak like a British person.” He did an impression of an American doing a crappy “British” accent for the last part of the sentence.
TW exercise, food, anti-semitism m
At 11 PM, Harry decided that he needed to sleep. He took 30mg of melatonin and lied down. As he drifted to sleep thirty minutes later, he could not believe how tired he was.
They walked around the city for nearly two hours, stopping inside game shops and thrift stores. There was nothing really worthy of purchasing, but that didn’t stop Harry from buying an old Trivial Pursuit game and half a deck of Pokémon cards. At 7:30, both men decided that it was time for dinner. They located the nearest McDonald’s and went there. After receiving their food, they sat at a table that was farthest away from the other customers.
He pointed his wand to his legs and screamed, “Unjellify!” He decided to cast his Shield Charm for the remainder of the course. This was obviously supposed to be a logic challenge, and he wasn’t sure that being overly cautious or overthinking the course was the goal. He kept walking through the room, his wand at the ready. Harry felt his legs tighten, then he warded off the
“Which part?”
Draco rolled his eyes. He asked, "How do you feel about Hogwarts?"
Harry was ready to call it a day. He was sat on Draco's couch, watching a Back to the Future marathon. His boyfriend had been beyond happy for him, and it appeared that Cauliflower and Halloween were happy for him too. They had been snuggled up to him ever since he arrived at the small apartment. Or maybe they were happy about the feline-like smell that McGonagall had left on him…
“Hmm?” Harry asked.
…” he said the name with contempt and wrinkled up his nose. “They frightened me, but in different ways. My father was a proud man and Azkaban broke him. He wanted power and he got Hell. Bellatrix reminded me of Lilith from old religious stories. She faithfully and chaotically followed the Devil and
. [Now, please.]” Her voice became harsh, warning him that a time-out was to come if he did not obey.
“Pansy. Pansy Parkinson. She came out to one of her friends in a wizard pub and some journalist outed her to everyone—including her family. Didn’t you see it?”
“Hi, Draco. It’s nice to meet you,” Xavier said, extending his arm for a handshake. Draco blinked in surprise. He shook Xavier’s hand.
“Harry?” Charlie said. His grin fell a bit.
“Shot,” Ron said.
"This isn't special treatment. You led a group named 'Dumbledore's Army,' you defended Hogwarts, you defeated Voldemort."
“Oh. Well, I don’t know. How long has he been sleeping?”
Draco sighed deeply.
Happy Christmas! Andromeda and I really enjoyed having you over last night. Teddy’s up and he’s opened all of his presents. He loves yours; he’s been playing with it all morning. How has your morning been?
"Does it feel good?" Harry questioned, licking his earlobe. Draco nodded his head in response. "I can make it feel even better." Harry voiced seductively.
"Fu-Fuck~Draco~Ah-ha!" He couldn't help the words from falling out, every nerve was tingling around his lower regions, leaving his mouth wide open, struggling to close it. Draco held him still when he came, the sticky liquid clouding the water, painting Draco's hand. Harry's face was twisted with pleasure, his nails leaving red marks on Draco's shoulders once he could move his limbs again. Harry leaned back against the tub, trying to catch his breath, feeling Draco's hands rest on his hips.
His dick slipped in easily each time, going harder and faster gradually. Draco's hips moved in time to Harry's thrusts, demanding more pleasure and movement.
Harry shrugged and rolled his eyes at Ron before biting into his apple.
"Draco, are you going to mov-Ah!" Harry's sentence was left to hang in the air, Draco slowly pulling out from him only to slid back in a second later. He continued the same pace, same rhythm as he repeated his actions, listening to the water splash against the wall and Harry's groans. Waves rippled around them, Draco's hips thrusting rapidly.
Moisture began seeping out of Draco's hole, slicking Harry's hand and staining the chaise beneath them. Harry removed his hand from Draco with a wet pop and felt the muscles in Draco's legs tense against him. He placed a hand on his dick beginning to guide it towards Draco's entrance.
Hermione looked up from her meal as Harry sat down.
Even when Harry handed the items over to Umbridge, he still couldn't look her in the eye, worried he might lose control of himself. Umbridge took the items gladly from Harry, smiling as she watched him turn around and grasp the doorknob, pulling the wooden door open.
Professor Snape stood in the doorway of the Great Hall, glaring at all of the students infront of him. Hermione opened her mouth to speak to him, however he put his hand up to silence her.
"Hm, maybe it will change to a bedroom tomorrow then." Draco joked before shutting the door, staring at the wood where Harry's face had once been.
Walking down the stairs, a few dim lights casted shadows on the walls, illuminating the stone steps, guiding him to the Common Room. The room was shrouded in darkness, the fireplace having gone out once everyone was in bed, the house elves tidying up the place whilst everyone slept. It was well past midnight now, passed the time everyone should be in bed, if he was caught now, he could only guess what Mcgonagall would do. A week's worth of detention likely.
Draco gave him a wolfish grin. “That’s right. It’s mine to mark up as I please so everyone can see.” Draco pushed his body flush against Harry’s and turned his head to the side, going for a wide bite on Harry’s neck.
She bristled at that. “I know,” Ginny retorted. “But it’s inconsiderate, okay? And rude. I hate when men ogle me in public.” It really made her skin crawl since she was just trying to play a damn sport.
“What I need,” Narcissa clarified. She picked her words with the utmost caution. “Is for you to tie up one teensy loose end.” Narcissa put the brush down on the vanity and began braiding her hair. She used to do it for her sisters and her dorm mates all the time, and they all told her she should open up a salon. She liked to fantasize about that sometimes, having a bustling small business with loyal customers.
“Yes, Ron. That’s probably bad.”
Apparently Julian just never asked. It was a noncommittal climate and he figured he’d never see the man again after one sizzling hot night backstage at a night club.
It seemed the battle lines were drawn. Just because they were virtual didn’t mean they made Harry any less enraged.
Once clean Harry did feel better, as he always did, but it was hard for him to envision the results of an arduous process anymore. If relief wasn’t immediate then Harry’s interest was hard to pique. He toweled off, shaving his face clean again when he heard a strange noise from the other room.
“Yes, we’re primary school sweethearts,” Harry answered in his sappiest voice of confirmation. “Oh, the stories I could tell you about what a courter this one is. Our prom was everything I ever dreamed of.”
When the man who always came after Macnair sat beside him, he passed the note under the table. It was a risky move, but the man grabbed it and shoved the note inside his Ministry-issued shoes.
“I don’t even remember who you are.”
Draco made that skin angry and red and didn’t stop there, running his nails over the handprints he left to make Harry shiver.
Should the recipient of the stamp be using polyjuice potion, the stamp ink would turn from green to red.
“Draco, I want to spend every night with you,” Harry told him seriously.
“It’s what’s best for the baby. If you don’t mind me mentioning, you two are very well off. I have a flower shop that needs marketing before we so much as sell a single red rose.”
So Draco apparated to his own front door and knocked on it as a warning, waiting a few seconds. No response. Draco opened his door and spoke from the diaphragm so the whole house might hear. “Darling, I’m home,” his voice rang out dulcet and sweet.
Aubrey agreed, Draco hung up and the torture was over. Harry stopped filming and let himself laugh.
“Yeah,” Harry shrugged. That cutting look in Draco’s eyes was quite something when he knew he wasn’t the target. “I mean, they did get charmed by Albus when they signed up to take care of me. It bound our blood and ownership of my fate until I came of age. They hated magic and really, really did not appreciate that.”
Hermione mostly pitied Harry for having to be around such an insufferable man—even after Harry explained Draco had matured since high school—but laughed occasionally at the bizarre things that happened while Harry and Draco were filming.
With that piece of information warming his heart, Professor Draco Malfoy smiled. The smile stayed on his face long after he bid Professor Potter a good night, walking back to the dungeons with a spring to his step.
Lily walked in her confident strut—like she was on the runway herself—past a group of fifth year boys who were doing all they could to not leer. They knew they’d get a smack-down if Lily saw them staring at her hemline again. Lily was a force to be reckoned with when she caught the unworthy trying to undress her with their eyes.
“Sure,” she said, shaking her head once again. This time, she smiled.
Ruth hadn’t said it with much confidence, though. Her doubts seeped through the cracks in her armor which had been officially damaged upon finding out that she may have been sending intimate texts to a complete stranger.
When no creatures of the night emerged to fulfill Harry’s wish, he let out a disappointed huff. The only way he’d gotten through his abusive childhood was clinging to fantasy novels and sneaking on Dudley’s computer to play simpler games with knights and kings.
“When was your first time?”
“You’re ridiculous,” Draco murmured but smiled the whole way. Whether it took a day or a week, he felt confident he would make a full recovery.
Ron didn’t even look up from his babies to refute that. “Hey, Rose, why don’t you give your little brother a kiss? Yeah, right on the side of the head. That’s your little brother, sweetie.” Harry quickly joined Ron in speaking to the kids as if they could understand. “And this is your Uncle Harry.”
Draco had been glad to join such an inclusive server when he began playing, and he had watched its community and economy grow. In the chat channel that was supposed to be used for Proudmoore trade, people argued over the sexuality of pop icons and debated worldwide issues.
“Good,” Harry answered. Sitting and warming Draco’s cock like this was making his own member twitch but now he was really throbbing with this pressure around the most sensitive part of his chest. It almost hurt, almost, but more than that it was so damn hot to look down at.
When he reached between Harry’s legs Draco gave his balls a teasing tap with the crop, gentle but more than enough to make Harry squirm with fear. He’d taken a few Bludgers to the groin in his Quidditch career and he wasn’t eager to relive the feeling. Maybe something less painful could be fun, but for now he wasn’t even sure how the crop would feel on his regular skin.
“Oh, would you quit acting out your strange fantasy of defying your parents through us? I happen to be looking out for Draco’s best interest.”
Harry shrugged. “I mean, it worked.”
Something truly eerie happened next. Like a mirror image, Draco stepped to the table as Lucius did the opposite side, each Malfoy man pulling out a seat for their significant other.
Draco hadn’t expected that genuine of an answer to his light humiliation of Harry. He withdrew his hand and Harry whined, looking up to him as if to ask ‘why?’. “That’s because we are closer than anyone could ever imagine two men being. I’m not ashamed of what we’re doing, even if your weird family knows about it. Now, tell me something.” Draco switched his hand from the front of Harry’s panties to the back. “Whose hole is this?”
“Is what true?” Remus didn’t exactly give out family secrets at the drop of a hat.
me and I…?”
knew him before the magazine.”
“I’m sure you’ve read about him and Colin in the papers. They’ve moved in together, Colin’s cat gets along really well with his owner’s boyfriend. It’s a cute little tabby,” Harry drawled. “There’s this coffee shop that lets you bring your cat in so it can play with the other cats, and there are toys everywhere… Theo and Colin sometimes go on dates there. They
“Auror Weasley, I have a visual on the hostage!” shouted one of them. “Permission to cast?”
“Is like spun gold? Like platinum silk?”
“In the middle of something!”
Draco snorted, but he wasn’t about to disagree. Granger was an astute woman back in school and was probably more intelligent than Draco and Harry combined with whatever degree she got at whatever college, as little as Draco liked to admit that. “Where did Wesley say he lived?”
“You win, too.”
Harry couldn’t help but laugh. “And how long have you been waiting to use that one?”
“A what?”
Harry and Draco let out a collective sigh of relief. That couldn’t be too awful, could it? Draco would inform his husband of their first offer that he had received from a desperate, sneaky teenager. While he could objectively admire her tactics, that hadn’t been enjoyable.
“Somewhere between dinner and dessert. He was terrible at it and wound up yelling at a waiter halfway through, but I love him,” Colin laughed.
“Yeah.”
“For dragon-keeping, yeah.”
“One last thing,” Harry cut in and nodded to the woman in the booth. “There’s someone who has been so invaluable to this show.”
Remus could have collapsed with relief, but luckily he remained standing upright. “Then what is it?” He could fix almost anything in her life but himself.
If this were World of Warcraft, Draco would have to suffer under Harry’s blades. It was a violent thought, but there was also no such thing as death in WoW. Draco would respawn moments later in a huff and a large armor repair bill and nobody would be permanently hurt.
?” Harry asked from the back of the room.
“On to your next lesson,” Sirius continued as if nothing had happened. “Baking! You’re going to make a chocolate cake.” Remus visibly salivated. Padfoot knew how to rev up a chocoholic and would use his skills when he pleased. “This is much more like potions, so you two Slytherins will hopefully get this without a setback.”
Even when he did, Harry nudged their noses together. “Five more minutes,” he murmured.
Olivia gave him a look. “I don’t want to live off of them forever, though. I want to have my own career,” she decided. It had been a thought of hers for a long while, but only then could she articulate it. “So it doesn’t matter how rich they are.”
!” Harry read aloud, stopping short of screaming the words out for the whole world to hear.
There would be a few more swings as Draco decorated the room but such was typical of an evening alone in the Manor. At least the construction gave him something to do. Even better than construction was decorating the rooms. He’d purchased a great deal of furniture and used the shrinking charm on it so he could store it all in a closet, and need only reverse the spell to get the items back to their full size.
“Oh my god, that was
From a nearby table, a couple looked at them like they were crazy. Harry often forgot that witch could be used as an insult because he knew so many brilliant and caring witches. “Yeah,” Dudley said as he lowered his voice. “And I tried to contact you, but the people in your building said you had moved.”
God, I love Theodore Nott. I feel like even though JK mentioned him a few times as a background character, I connect with him on a spiritual level. I could rant for hours about how I love him, but I think it’s time to check in with some other characters. Onwards! Also, DOMA is dead. Dead, dead, dead. I am so happy. Prop 8, you’re next.
“Are you—?”
“Refill for your wine glasses?”
Malfoy—who had been in the year above her went on a cordial date with her and had taken her back to the Manor unbeknownst to their parents and told her in the exact words of ‘condoms aren’t big enough for me, doll’, she let him go without.
“What-o?”
With one last ragged moan Draco came inside Harry, breeding him deep like he’d promised to. The other man was shaking and practically drooling beneath him for an orgasm, pushed past words when his walls were coated in Draco’s essence.
Absurdly, Harry’s brain wondered what Riddle would make of all this. He couldn’t love, not after being conceived under the effects of a love potion, but he had been in Harry’s head for a long, long time—longer than he hadn’t been at this point still.
People did a lot of things with their hips, Harry realized.
“You love her but you don’t know what she looks like?” Draco finally blurted out.
“Get her inside and we’ll wait for her to wake up. If she doesn’t, well, then you’re going to have to get my father out of Azkaban for a second time.”
“I can’t open any other rooms.” Mr. Lark said every word with great emphasis and purpose.
“They spawned from the earth,” Colin decided with a smile, knowing how silly he sounded. “You plant kids like you do seeds, and then all you have to do is water them.”
“Sorry to disappoint.”
“One second!”
“I won’t let you down,” Grace blurted out. The fire in Draco’s eyes made her skin crawl with nervousness, and gave her a serious case of verbal vomit.
“You’re on hallowed ground, pet. The master bedroom, right where this equivalent is now, used to be where I put on private shows of my mother’s fashions. Her heels were far too big, so I stuffed them with stockings.” Draco allowed a fond smile from a good part of his childhood. It was a private memory that he always thought his mother knew about but never mentioned. That was better than the alternative negative reaction, anyway.
Without another word, the prodigal son entered the interview room. Ron quickly turned on the microphone that would allow the audience huddled in the prison hall to hear what was going on within. They all had front-row seats as Theo moved to use the chair that Harry had previously used to bother Marcus.
“Who cares?” she sighed. “Anyway, my resolution is to attack the problems in my life and destroy them rather than complain about them.”
“What, you’re not upset? Here I am on your turf, after all,” Draco questioned, not wanting to let his guard down just because Potter was pretty and laughing.
Remus put his head in his hands. “I…” He didn’t want to think about Olivia changing from a human to a werewolf, let alone from a girl to a woman. “I know that.” Also, he hadn’t wanted to think about his adoptive child’s breasts.
“Yeah,” he murmured, suddenly wishing he hadn’t brought it up at all. Theo was being far too understanding and making too much sense. Colin would have rather wallowed in in his own distaste. No woman was wonderful enough for his father except his mother.
“Of course,” Pansy joked. “Maybe one day you’ll be A-List enough to get an invitation.”
“I shouldn’t have expected anything different.”
It dawned upon Theo that he had never been inside a cathedral before. Sundays in the Nott family hadn’t included a trip to commune with higher powers.
“Ahem.” Umbridge cleared her throat and adjusted the Siamese kitten pin on her rose blazer lapel. “I said: Do I make myself clear?”
Alvaro’s words rung in Harry’s head—“
“I mean, it’s what you should have done in the first place to be a decent human being…”
Harry snorted. “Sure, Draco. Let’s go with that.” It wasn’t completely untrue, after all. “Is it strange that I feel more nervous for this than I did for all those dangerous missions in our schooldays?”
“And what are your friends having?” Samuel gestured towards Draco’s table.
Shocked at the response he receives, Harry stood back, “I’m sorry. I’ll… I’ll just go,” he walked away, shutting the door behind him.
“I–,” Draco faltered. “One day, I decided to go for a walk, and without meaning to, I went to his flat. I didn’t say anything, and I left before he had the chance to. Then, just two days ago, he came over demanding that we talk, which I refused, naturally. We haven’t really spoken, just seeing him again brought everything back and… I don’t know,” he ran one of his hands through his hair, realising he hadn’t showered since that day.
It's update day! Thank you so much for the comments you left on the previous chapter, it always makes my day when I see someone has commented or left a kudos!
“Hi. I’m Samuel, nice to meet you. Can I buy you a drink?” He boldly spoke, clearly already slightly inebriated. Having gone over two years without flirting with strangers, Draco stood up to the challenge, determined to pull his mind off of Harry.
“We need to talk,” Harry started, and Draco looked up from his book.
“I need you to leave.”
As Draco was attempting to move on, and quite successfully doing so, he did not take notice of the pair of striking green eyes staring at him from afar.
“I just– I don’t know how to say this without breaking your heart.” Draco felt tears beginning to form, the lump in his throat growing. “I just don’t know if we should keep doing this. I love you, you know that I love you, but I’m just not sure that you’re the one for me,” Harry shut his eyes, and all Draco could do was stare at him, the words failing to sink in. “I am so sorry–” Harry tried to add.
I am quite enjoying delving into Harry's perspective on things, are you liking it? Or should I try to stick to just Draco? Let me know!
Once Draco had the drinks, he wandered back to his table and took a seat, thanking Samuel along the way.
Thank you all so much for reading, I love you all <3
Eleven months, and he still sleeps as cold as ever, despite desperately layering blankets over him and casting countless heating charms over himself, anything to replicate the warmth Harry brought him. Eleven months, and he had to cancel his subscription to the Daily Prophet because each day there were images of Harry and his new love plastered on the front cover, rubbing what Draco lost in his nose as if part of some sick, twisted joke. Eleven months, and he no longer knew who he was without him.
Additionally, there are chapters that are flashbacks which I have noted at the top of such chapters, as along with the date. I have tried to make it as clear as possible, so let me know if there is anything I can do to make it easier to see!
Once Narcissa had fed him a decent meal, and gotten him settled in, she decided to finally ask him what was going on.
“Have you...never…shopped for anyone else before?” Harry asked, his voice reaching a higher octave by the last word.
.          Draco stepped towards him and snarled, “
“So, that is how you complete the square. Take the coefficient for the ‘x’ term, cut it in half, and square it,” Malfoy informed Harry. In twenty minutes, Malfoy had managed to sum up over four hours of Algebra.
.          “Twenty,” Harry offered. They were the same age, after all.
“Um…not much. I lived alone for a while and then I moved in with Andromeda and Teddy. I just…relaxed.”
Draco and Harry cuddled their way through
“Damn the man. Damn the man!” Teddy started singing.
Draco finished his cigarette, but didn’t go back inside. Harry took the blond’s presence as permission to continue.
He walked in, closed and locked the door, and checked the place out. It was completely unfurnished except for the bar stools in the kitchen. After observing the small place that he would call home, he converted the area in the living room connected to the bathroom by a door frame with a broken door into a chimney for the floo network. His parole required that he be connected to it.
.          Draco decided that he’d stared for far too long, even though it was probably only a few seconds. Time was strange in that way.
“Merci, Harry. You didn’t have to do this. Really though, I appreciate it. I hope you have a wonderful first day, but don’t work yourself too much!” she yelled after him as he left.
“Yes, but you know my mum.”
“Oh, God,” he thought, “That doesn’t sound manly. Then again, there’s not anything wrong with being girly…”
Although Harry’s mental health had had its ups and downs over the course of the month, his training had only had its downs. It was early June, and Harry had his exams coming up. He’d been trying to study for a while but to no avail. He’d open his textbook and just completely space out. It was like his brain was trying to fail training on purpose. When the year first began, he knew that he’d easily pass the practicals and a few of the written exams, but now he was worried that he’d perform as poorly on those as he would for the theoreticals.
“It’s required, isn’t it?”
“Always what?” Harry asked.
“Because I was depressed,” Draco responded, his voice substantially lower in volume. “Because I am depressed, damn it.”
"You don't have to—"
"Yes, you look lovely," she said. She was dressed in a floral dress, which Harry thought ironically resembled springtime.
.          Teddy struggled in Harry’s arms. Harry almost didn’t hear his whines.
Accepting that he wouldn’t be able to sleep, Harry decided to make a list of everything he wanted to get done before Ron and Hermione arrived, for he had gotten their letter after dinner the night before. He wrote, “Shower, tidy room, vacuum house, wash dishes, fix breakfast, bathe Teddy, fix coffee, do homework.”
“No. I just. I feel so weak...breaking down like that.”
Draco”
.          All he wanted was a shot of something. All he wanted was a shot…or…
When he finally got inside the pub, Ginny was waiting.
“What’s he
This child was a werewolf, and even if he wasn’t, he was a half-blood. Draco felt offensive. After a damned war about blood politics, did he really just insult this child’s language ability in relation to his blood status? Draco felt so stupid. He attempted to clarify but only found himself stuttering, “I didn’t think that he…I mean, he’s not a…he’s not actually…” He bit down on his tongue, tasting blood. His mental gaze went to his wrist. His teeth let go of his tongue.
Harry continued, “She said that the war was pretty hard on you…”
They quieted at Draco’s statement.
"I am fine. Why're you so uptight right now?"
“That’s okay, bud. We can do that. It’s no problem,” Harry said. He smiled and grabbed Teddy’s hand. The toddler wiped his tears away, still somewhat angry. Andromeda squeezed Harry’s arm. He had never told her where Tonks died, so he supposed that she assumed it was here. He offered her a sad smile. It was then that he looked at the Great Hall.
Once the shock wore off, Harry laughed. “Mate, it’s fine. You’ve gotta admit: it’s a pretty brilliant headline.”
“I am so so-“ Harry stopped midsentence when he and the stranger locked eyes. His jaw dropped.
Harry and Draco had spoken since their initial conversation concerning their relationship. They had set up a date for 28 January at 5:30 PM at Olive Garden.
“It’s…. all right.” Draco hesitated. “I haven’t really been here a while.”
.          “I didn’t think that he…I mean, he’s not a…he’s not actually…” Malfoy bit his tongue, literally. He then sucked in his teeth, as if he were telling himself to shut up.
Harry nodded and they both leaned in. Their lips touched and they slowly moved them together. It was gentle and perfect. Harry moved his chest to where it touched Draco’s and pushed the latter back against the wall. Draco deepened the kiss. His lips parted and he began to suck on Harry’s lower lip. They both moved apart and then back together again. Their tongues softly touched and Harry felt like he could stay there forever. Then the door to the restaurant opened and the men moved apart. Harry’s glasses were fogged.
Enjoy today's update!
“Lovely, I’m… my name is Draco, and if you insist, I would like an Ogden's, please,” Draco leaned closer to him.
“No,” Draco jumped up and threw his book at his chest, hard, wanting to inflict some pain on the other boy, something to hurt him the way in which he was being hurt. “Out. Now.”
“Draco?” He stood there, dumbstruck. “What- why are you here?” Draco froze and stared for a brief moment. He didn’t know what to say, how to justify his being there, so instead, he took the ever so noble path of turning around and retreating down the stairs. He had made it halfway down when Harry called after him, “Wait! Did you want to talk?”
, he thought to himself.
This time, Draco refused to allow Harry to send him down that same, never-ending spiral of grief and feeling hopeless. He refused to let that happen for a second time that week. Instead, he wrote to his mother, asking if he could visit her in the countryside of France where she retired to after his father was arrested and thrown in Azkaban.
He was mid-panic when the beautiful, dark-haired man who had ripped his heart out of his chest and walked all over it like it was nothing opened the door, shocked.
He thought about how he had let stupid Potter have such an impact on his life, and how without him, he didn’t know how to function.
I am so sorry for not updating in the past week, I have had trial exams and have been focussing on them.
“Who was that?” Pansy exclaimed, her eyes following Samuel as he departed.
Draco had even gone as far as dating numerous wizards to distract himself from the all-consuming infatuation with Potter.
It was an hour later when Draco finally approached Samuel on the dance floor. He had had quite a bit to drink in order to give him the courage to do so; courage to quit looking back and begin looking forward. Samuel was eager in his acceptance of the invitation to dance, and in amongst the hot bodies around them, he kept his hands on Draco’s waist while he got lost in the music.
He began scratching at his arms, his eyes, his head, desperate to stop picturing the man he had lost. Anything to escape Potter's overconsuming gaze, his soft angles, the hair which constantly refused to be tamed into something remotely presentable. The room around him began spinning, not even the floor felt as if it was holding him up. All he wanted was to escape, to not feel this way anymore. But then he would picture Harry’s eyes, and there was nothing else he could do but experience the pain. Allow the torture to wash over his body until he can breathe again.
Harry wandered into his living room, and was greeted by Finn.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco gasped, “You can’t do that!”
! We’re friends with a bloody foreign prince, aren’t we?”
Draco nodded. "You'd be good at that."
He was cut off by a short Indian girl with half-shaved dark brown hair, skinny jeans, a blue hoodie, and purple socks, “¡Ay! Gonzalo, cállese. Nadie quiere escucharle. ¡Déjelo ahora, por favor!” The man, Gonzalo, groaned and threw up his arms before moving back inside the apartment next to Draco’s.
For the beginning of February, it was quite warm—10 degrees Celsius (30 degrees Fahrenheit). It hadn’t snowed for days. However, this pleased Harry. He was attempting to take a cab to the local cinema. It was 5:30 PM and the fifth of the month. While he was excited to watch
Yet, Harry was not paying attention to that. He was observing the rapidness with which Malfoy took his color-coded notes and how he watched the professor like a hawk, as if attempting to absorb everything the man was saying. What struck Harry as the most peculiar detail was how Malfoy’s head snapped back when Harry answered, “Here” on roll call, and how, afterwards, his head and shoulders sunk down like he was trying to disappear.
Draco fixated his eyes on the officer’s mole. It was located just above his right eyebrow and was by far Draco’s favorite place to stare while spacing out. He’d tried the floor, but Dousselsnorf always called him out. He’d tried the pictures on Dousselsnorf’s desk, but he was unusually secretive about his private life. He’d tried the clock, but that didn’t work because the second hand always got stuck right around the ten, so then he’d be thinking about how much time Dousselsnorf was losing and how that had to affect his productivity and—
“Yes…Harry, why are you asking?”
"Be careful, Harry," she warned. He was confused. Why wasn't she as excited? Upon viewing his confusion, she continued, "You tend to get…what's the word? I      don't want to use the wrong one. You tend to get attached to places and people. I don't want this to become another escape route for you."
Chapter 2 TW/CW: probation m, jail implications, food m, cigarettes, swearing, ableist slurs
“No, I mean you. Your ambitions, hopes, personality.”
“Oh, Merlin,” Draco cringed.
The snow was pouring down rather heavily for early December. Harry had checked the weather before going out, but he really did not expect six inches of snow. Now, because he insisted on continuing his plans, he was being scolded by a blond drama queen.
“How are you doing?” Luna asked.
“Hmm?” Malfoy questioned.
At that time, Harry decided to raid Ted’s old library for some books to read. He chose to settle on Fahrenheit 451. He stopped reading about an hour later and sat outside to smoke and watch the sunrise.
“Guess not.”
Harry smiled. "So, we've grown."
“Hey! How are you two?” Harry asked.
“So did you have fun?” Draco asked, his hands in his pockets. His hair was gradually becoming un-gelled and was slipping into his eyes. Once more, Harry fought the urge to move it.
“Martini!” Ginny practically screamed.
“Do you believe in ghosts?”
“I loved it,” Harry revealed.
“Well, Ginny wanted some Pygmy Puffs.”
“Andromeda.”
Draco woke up covered in sweat. He hadn’t had this dream in months. He rubbed his hands together, eager to get the memory of Potter’s hand, Potter’s selflessness, off his skin. He got up from his bed and walked to the kitchen, towards the cabinet with his pills. He stopped in his tracks when he remembered. Full of shame, Draco made himself a pot of coffee and a few sunny-side up eggs. He smoked while he cooked. He ate the eggs slowly, savoring every bite. He looked through his mail while he ate. He read through his classes again, attempting to memorize the schedule.
“How so?”
It was 10 AM before Harry had stopped sulking. He could not believe that someone had been so low as to where they would actually eavesdrop on such a personal conversation. More important, he couldn’t believe that it wasn’t Rita Skeeter.
They walked into the store and were immediately greeted by George.
His apartment wasn’t much, and he really didn’t need it to be. The University of Manchester required him to either live on-campus or near the school, but he still planned on spending as much time with Teddy and Andromeda as possible. He wasn’t quite ready to completely live alone yet. There were times that, with his mental illness, he doubted he’d ever be able to. He hated thinking about that.
"Oh, wow." Harry could tell that Draco was trying his best to cover up his pity.
"Oh yeah," Harry replied, remembering that Malfoy was technically a Black.
Harry watched as his boyfriend played patty-cake with Teddy. Draco was not as strict with making the toddler bilingual, so he’d spoken in English the entire night. Harry supposed that it was good that Draco only moderately followed the Black family’s values.
“Andromeda and I made it.”
Draco turned around, smiling. He said, “Do you want to?”
“Oh, no. Wizarding therapists hold th-“
It was Draco’s turn to giggle. He then commented, “I wish that we had time to do that stuff when we were teenagers.”
“Umm…I didn’t understand a
“Nice, Harry!” Charlie said, he patted Harry on the arm. “You doing okay?”
This was it, the day Draco most feared had arrived, and there was nothing he could do to stop it.
Harry asked, "Is she going to announce the post-poning of sorting?"
Harry got out all of his notes for his exam preparations. He knew that he’d ace his French, bio, philosophy, and world history exams, so he really only needed to study geometry, econ, sociology, and art history. However, out of all of his courses, he couldn’t pick out one that he loved. Even if he was good at teaching, whom and what would he teach?
“Awesome. All right, you all, try 5
. [You cannot say it. That word is bad.]”
“So, I’ll see you later,” Harry half-asked, half-affirmed.
Harry clutched the letter and reread the first two sentences of the latter paragraph. He felt giddy.
? He put the letter in his back pocket. “I think I’m going to read this later,” he informed Andromeda. “Right now, I’m going to clean the kitchen and then go to my flat, okay?”
Draco sat back down. He pulled his knees up to his chest and tightly wrapped his arms around his legs. He had to quit. He had to quit doing drugs and drinking and cutting and the rest of this bullshit. He had been like
Draco smiled in response. They waited a few minutes before speaking again, absorbing the words already spoken.
better than getting.
After Harry finished his firewhiskey, he gathered the bags of candy and apparated home. He soon put the candy on the dining table, then entered the kitchen where Andromeda was making candy apples.
“A little too much, if you ask me.” Ginny smiled as the waiter had come with their food.
.          “Ahem,” she cleared her throat, “’Dear Andromeda,’ it reads, ‘I am terribly sorry that this letter has come late. I have been busy with my studies and with work in the past day; thus, I have not been able to dedicate the appropriate amount of time to replying to you. Thank you for reaching out to me. I also apologize for my behavior at the university. I was running slightly late for work, and I had to get there as quickly as possible. I would, in fact, enjoy possibly meeting you at some point. The specifics of that meeting shall be up to you. Lastly, you will find a second, smaller enclosed letter in this envelope as well. Thank you. Yours truly, Draco Malfoy.’” Andromeda paused and took a breath.
“And you’re just...okay with it?” Harry asked.
Harry pointed to a girl with long, black hair. She inquired, “Weren’t you born in a hospital?”
“Well, of course, Harry,” Hermione answered, reassuringly.
“No, really, Harry. It is,” George confirmed before walking off to help another customer.
“I’m, y’know, I’m good. You?” Harry asked.
They finished their chicken nuggets, then Harry asked, “Why did you adopt cats?”
"Do you think that 2015 is really going to look like this?" Draco asked Harry.
“Er-no. Th-there’s more to the story.”
“How about this?” Draco asked Harry. He was holding a sterling silver charm bracelet that held three charms: a heart, an owl, and a snowman. Each of the charms was embroidered with diamonds.
Harry awoke quickly. He was sweating profusely and crying. He stood up and checked the time. His clock read 3:04AM. He sat down on his bed and played with his hair a little, twisting the curls between his thumb and index finger.
