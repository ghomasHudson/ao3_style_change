“Alright, sure.  Why not?”  He leaned up and pressed a long kiss against my lips.  I pulled his hips closer, breathing deeply into the kiss.
“What?  You wanted to just drag me out here to embarrass me or what, maybe just waste my time?”  Potter practically screamed at me.  I clenched my fists at my side.  “Well?”
“Come here, Mr Potter, dear,” Umbridge muttered sweetly after staring at Harry blankly for a moment.  He kicked his chair aside and strode up to the teacher’s desk.  I held my breath.  Professor Umbridge pulled a small roll of pink parchment out of her handbag, wrote a note, and tapped it with her wand, sealing it.  “Take this to Professor McGonagall, dear,” said Professor Umbridge, holding out the note to him.  He silently took it and stormed out of the room.  “Now, if no one else has anything to say, please continue your reading.”  Umbridge sat down and ignored every raised hand for the rest of the class.
“You accompanied Draco to the Yule Ball.”  My mother stepped forward with a sweet smile.  I looked past Pansy and saw Harry bustling about with the Weasley clan and a few odd stragglers, including Mad-Eye Moody and Professor Lupin.  “I heard you made a dashing couple.”
“Yeah.  There was an extra bedroom upstairs, but Dudley used it for his extra toys and gadgets.  After first year they gave me the extra room but didn’t treat me much better.”  He sighed.  “The Weasley’s usually take me in for a few weeks towards the end of summer.  First, they broke me out by pulling the bars off my window and—”
“Oh yeah?”  I could see Harry nearly trembling in his seat.  The anger was pouring off of him, seeping into Weasel, whose ears were now turning a bright red.
"We went to this prestigious boarding school up north of Aberdeen, and everyone was called by their last names. It just sorta became a habit," Harry explained as if he had rehearsed it a hundred times. Draco understood why Harry was quick to cut him off — he already had a Muggle backstory that made sense.
Draco watched as Harry scanned the crowd before his eyes staggered onto him for a moment before he turned his back. He saw me. He looked right at me. Harry slowly turned back around, averting his gaze to another part of the crowd, before singing the next verse.
“We landed in a graveyard.  At first, we thought it might’ve been part of the tournament so we took out our wands.  Then we noticed this guy walking towards us, he was holding this bundle in his arms.  When they got close, my scar started burning and I dropped my wand and this cold voice just like… whispered to ‘kill the spare’, and the guy just… just…” Harry let out a slow, shuddering breath.  “Used the killing curse on Cedric.”  My jaw and heart dropped.  Harry took his glasses off and pinched the bridge of his nose.  I wanted to step forward to comfort him but my feet were rooted in place.  “The guy, who turned out to be Wormtail, grabbed me and—”
Arithmancy dragged by and finally, it was time to flesh out the new Defense Against The Dark Arts teacher, Umbridge.
“I should go now,” He whispered, pulling away slightly.  “Rest up before tomorrow, you know.”  He paused and chewed his cheek for a moment.  “I love you.”  I nodded, swallowed thickly and forced a smile.  He smiled again before leaving through the vines.
“Fuck, I need more moonstone,” I muttered to Pansy, quickly folding the parchment.  Pansy nodded and I walked towards the back of the room to the ingredients cabinet, passing by the trio’s table.  I stopped next to Harry and leaned over his cauldron.  It looked putrid, dark green and bubbling like bile.  The whole area smelled like a mix of rotten eggs, stale beer and popcorn.  I grimaced, trying not to add my own spew to the already horrible potion.
"Okay," Malfoy said, but some of the confidence seemed to have oozed out of him.  "We can work around that, I'm sure."
What Draco wanted to do was slip into his comfortable bed and mull over the evening's events.  He most definitely did
"He doesn't," Draco replied quickly.  "It's not like that.  We just...you know what? I'm not discussing this with you." Draco held out his arm politely.  "Let's just go downstairs – dinner should be ready by now."
"Contacts, Weasley." Pansy treated them both to a small, smug smile. "You should try cultivating them sometime."
"I never thought I'd find myself agreeing with that buffoon, Longbottom.  But for the sake of all our sanity, would you do something about this embarrassing crush you have on my godson."
Ron and Pansy had finally surfaced just before dinner, and had promptly been treated to a volley of teasing with they handled with surprising aplomb.   As he watched the looks that passed between them, Harry had a sneaking suspicion that it might be more than a one-time thing. Not that he was particularly bothered – Pansy was a long way from the pug-nosed cow she had been in school, and if nothing else, it would certainly make things easier for Draco and him when
"We were engaged within a year," Ginny says softly, something like sympathy in her eyes. "Did Draco ever even spend a full night at yours?"
"I don't know what you're talking about," Harry replied stubbornly, turning his gaze to the bare tree.  "I suppose he's still coming tomorrow?"
But it clearly wasn't his day.  Potter – the evil bastard – chose that particular moment to stretch, and Draco was unable to resist sneaking a quick glance at the sliver of warm skin it revealed.
Hermione ushered him inside.  "Don't look so worried; I'm not stopping.  I just popped around to offer Harry some moral support."
"But it's your room," Harry replied as he pushed the door open. He was surprised to see how little stuff Malfoy appeared to have.  "Is this everything?"
Malfoy, who wasn't inches away anymore.  Who was still pressed along the length of Harry's body and whose fingertips were tracing intricate patterns on the thin fabric of Harry's t-shirt.
Harry's really not a fan of team building exercises, but he might just make an exception for this one.
His timing wasn't the greatest, as Harry had just crammed a large bit of sandwich into his mouth.  "No one's going to steal it, you know," Draco teased.
The trick with Hermione was to get it over and done with quickly – like ripping off a plaster.  The longer you left it, the more time she had to expound on her theories, and the more questions she came up with – if he didn't head her off quickly, Harry knew all his secrets would be laid bare before the night was out.   And that was something he'd really rather avoid if at all possible.
So Saturday morning he made his way into Diagon Alley – early, so as to avoid the crowds – and headed straight for the Apothecary.  Harry wasn't happy with his planned course of action at all, but the way things were going, Dreamless Sleep was the only option open to him if he didn't want to collapse from exhaustion at some point.
Harry hadn't quite got the mastery of his temper that Ron had yet, and Pansy's sly tone never failed to rile him. "Don't you have a client to see?" he snapped, and added his best glare for good measure.
Tom shook his head.  "Nah, he's as quiet as a mouse, that one.  It's the others making all the fuss."

Harry didn’t miss the definite flush that coloured Draco’s cheeks, and he was fairly sure that his own were a similar shade.  He tried his hardest not to read anything into the friendly offer.  After all, neither of them had mentioned the hand-holding incident, nor had either of them made any effort to take things a step further.
Then Harry gave himself a mental shake – now was not the time.  First he had to get out of this room, bypassing a snoring Theodore Nott who appeared to have only made it as far as the floor beside his bed, and through the dungeons beyond.
Hermione looked from Harry's glare to Ron's pout, and shook her head. "Honestly. Look, why don't you come round after work and you can ask Blaise yourself?"
No sooner had Weasley and Granger departed – he still struggled to think of her as anything else but – than Pansy and Blaise appeared to make their excuses.
"That's not the bloody point, Harry.  We're wizards, we Apparate.  We don't drive around in Muggle death traps."
However, Draco had wanted to go, and in a pattern that had become all too familiar to Harry throughout their friendship, Harry was unable to say no.  There was very little he wouldn’t endure to be the one who made Draco smile.
“Like it?  I think it’s bloody brilliant.  It’ll be like the anti-Christmas.  We can do all those things we secretly wanted to, but Mum wouldn’t allow.”  He paused and grinned.  “Heh, we can even watch those naked women channels if we want.”
"Buying presents for you, no doubt," Molly replied, a fond smile on her face.  "Ron tells me he's quite smitten with you."
Harry walked into the kitchen, an expression of stunned disbelief still etched on his features.  Draco looked up from his spot at the stove and smiled.
"Zabini's crawling back out from under his rock then," Ron commented, flashing a bright grin at the waitress as she took his plate.  "What's that in aid of?"
.  And in the brief moment of lucid thought he managed amongst the delirium of pleasure, Draco swore to himself that he would do whatever it took to keep him.  It had been hard enough these last few years, being so close to Harry and yet
It wasn't the most comfortable of positions: pressed side-by-side, unable to move apart or lounge on the sofa.  Harry bore it stoically.  Malfoy, as was to be expected, not so much.
at the same time.  But now that he knew what it felt like, the taste of Harry's lips, the feel of his hands, the hot press of his body...Draco knew he couldn't be without it again.  There was just no way.
Draco reached out as if to touch Harry, but his hand fell back to his side before he made contact.  "It was never my intention to hurt you."
"Are you crying?"  Harry didn't mean it to come out quite so blunt, but he was more than a little surprised.
"It's none of my business," he says finally, and gives himself a mental shake. "He made that very clear."
"I just wish you'd felt able to talk to us." Hermione's brown eyes were wide and sad-looking. "I can't believe you've been carrying this alone for so long and I didn't even know."
Harry spread the paper out on the table in front of him and heaved a sigh of relief. The chatter of house-elves was silenced, as was the noise their hammering had caused. He felt the smallest twinge of guilt at taking out his mood on the small creatures that had only been doing their jobs, but the peace and quiet he'd gained in return more than made up for it.
“Oh.” From Luna’s expression it was clear the idea had never even occurred to her.  “Do you think she’ll be expecting that?  Only, I’ve already asked Draco.”
The fates were clearly smiling on him for once, because barely had Harry's back pressed against through stone wall, than the portrait hole swung open and Dean Thomas slid out.  Dean couldn't have looked more shifty if he was hanging around outside hidden under an Invisibility Cloak, and Harry couldn't help but grin to himself as he slid through the entrance in  Dean's wake – clearly he wasn't the only one keeping secrets.
It was not to be, however, because Harry had made the fatal mistake of not locking the Floo the previous night after Draco's departure.
"I don't…" Harry rubs his free hand across his face. "Why are you saying this? You never liked him."
Harry nodded eagerly.  He was only too grateful for any opportunity to escape his current house-guest.  "You're on."
It had taken some time before Draco had dared to set foot in the place.  Not because he expected to be struck down, but simply because he didn't feel he had the right to be in such a place of remembrance.  It had been Harry who persuaded him otherwise, who marched Draco there one lunchtime, refusing to take no for an answer.  Now it was a favourite spot of his, and Draco could regularly be found in company, or alone, on one of the garden's convenient benches, book in hand or lost in thought.
Draco just laughed and reached out for Harry's hands.  "Come back to bed," he murmured.  "You're freezing, and we have a busy day tomorrow."
Draco had commandeered the dining room several hours earlier, refusing to allow anyone entrance until it was time to start dinner.  There was rather a lot of noise sounding from the room which made Harry nervous, but Draco had point-blank refused to allow anyone else near the table arrangements.
When Blaise finally leaves around ten minutes later, Harry is still resisting the urge to bang his head against the nearest hard surface.  Blaise walks close by the counter and snags another biscuit from the packet Harry is burying his problems in.
Any further thoughts in such areas were interrupted by the office door opening once again.  Pansy Parkinson emerged once more, and though her smile was a little less bright on this occasion it was still very much there nonetheless.
At the sound of Draco's voice, Harry instantly pulled out of Hermione's embrace.  He turned to see his flatmate lounging against the doorframe, looking sexier than it should have been possible for anyone to do in faded tracksuit bottoms and an old white t-shirt.
"Bi," was all Harry said in response.  He'd learnt early on in their friendship not to question some of Blaise's more eccentric behaviours and statements.  Trying to work out which were genuine and which were simply for effect was the quickest route to a migraine.
and Rita Skeeter's poison pen.  But apparently she believes her granddaughter's oft mentioned beauty is such that it can overcome trivial matters like orientation.
Harry had hoped the dormitory would be empty, to give him time to brood and lick his wounds in private.  But, as the morning so far had already showed, this was not to be Harry's day.
Harry stills at the familiar voice and the cool slide of Draco's hand in his. He turns his head to the side and the shy smile on Draco's face warms his heart.
“You’re mean,” Draco muttered, and Harry was sure that if he looked, there would be a pout on Draco’s face.  But his actions belied his words as he placed his hands atop Harry’s, tightening the grip on his waist.
"Fuck no!" The words are out before Harry's brain has chance to stop them.  The sound bad to his own ears, never mind Malfoy's.  "Sorry," he mutters, gaze fixed on the table.
“I spent most of the weekend on a stakeout near Birmingham. Believe me, there was nothing hot or date like about it.  I think you need to check your sources, mate.”
"So?"  Pansy's tone was incredulous now.  "That doesn't mean he knows what's best.  Look where following him got you last time."  Pansy reached out, and before Draco could pull away, she had tugged the sleeve of his jumper back, laying bare the faded Dark Mark.
Predictably this is followed by a flush and a giggle.  "You're a born flatterer, Harry Potter.  I can't think why some girl hasn't snapped you up already."
"Nice?"  Hermione repeated, her nose wrinkled.  "You spent the night alone with Draco – the man you love – and all you can say is
Harry chokes down a cry of frustration. "Blaise." He nods and can't help the genuine smile that follows.
Hermione beamed proudly at her daughter, before turning a pointed gaze on her best friend.  "And you might want to do it quickly.  I can't get her to stop doing that, and even Ron's going to work it out eventually."
Draco flashes a quick smile at Harry before addressing his friend.  "You know I hate those godforsaken affairs.  They're full of people I can't stand and who can stand me even less.  Outside of you, Pansy, and possibly Theo, there's not one person there that I care to see."
There was no sign of Ron anywhere at the moment, and Harry couldn't help but give the tiniest sigh of relief – not that he wanted to avoid his best friends, but because some conversations just went that bit smoother without a certain redhead's presence.  And while Harry was fairly sure he could handle Hermione's reaction to recent developments, he was in no way ready for Ron's.  Especially when he didn't have answers to most of the questions that Ron would doubtless have.
"I'll catch up with you later," she said after an awkward pause, and Draco couldn't help but smirk because the implied threat behind her words was obvious, and judging from the poorly concealed wince, even Potter realised it.
Which, in itself, wasn't the worst way to pass a Friday evening, but the beer was undrinkable, the pulsing music was doing little to soothe nagging headache he'd nursed all day, and Blaise was currently eyeing up every male in the establishment, apparently with the intent of propositioning them on Harry's behalf.
"What?"  Harry knew damn well what Draco was referring to, but he was nervous and trying to buy himself time.
"That depends."  Potter's voice was low, almost husky, and Draco found himself leaning in closer despite his better judgement.
Ginny was still smiling, but Harry knew her well enough to see the hurt behind it.  "She'll come round."
entirely too often.  Still, at least he’d got permission to start planning the stag – Malfoy could keep his bloody mitts off that.
"Funny you should mention that," Hermione said, and the twinkle in her eye made Harry a little uneasy.  "I'd like you and Ron to be my bridesmaids."
Ron may have been distracted by more pressing matters, but he wasn't the only Weasley interested in Harry's whereabouts.
"I'll make it up to you later," Draco promised, dropping the towels on the bed and smoothing his palms up and down Harry's arms.
When a shadow fell over Draco's parchment, he looked up with no small amount of shock – visitors rarely stayed long enough for contact to take place.
Potter paused – fork full of food midway between table and mouth.  "I'd like one with a table in," he said, more decisively than he had been at any part of the proceedings so far.  "It reminds me of Grimmauld Place."
Ron choked on his tea.  "That's different," he protested.  "Me and Hermione are married.  You and Malfoy aren't... together.  Are you?"  This last was asked with more than a hint of alarm.
"True," Harry agreed with a smile. Then, after a moment's silence, he said, "Draco, what are you doing here?"
"You never know," she said, smiling down at him. "You might want to stay on his good side for a while though. Wouldn't be half as interesting around this department without you here."
"Then why are you here?" Draco sounded more desperate than angry now, and Harry felt the first flutter of hope.
"Harry showed me a few things," Draco replied as he lifted a pan off the hob and poured its contents into the colander.  "And I picked up the rest.  It's not as hard as you think – following recipes is a lot like making potions."
Draco crossed the room in a few strides and quickly filled his glass.  Then he turned his attention back to Harry.  "Budge up."
"It is."  Draco nodded firmly; he knew from past gourmet experiences that Harry was a mean cook, and he planned to take advantage of this fact at every opportunity.
Pansy sipped her wine, as if taking a moment to gather her thoughts. "You defended him. At his trial," she clarified, as if in a million years Harry wouldn't know what she was talking about. "You stood up in front of everyone and told them to give him a second chance. Do you know who else did that for him?"
Draco flopped down on one of the large squashy sofas and hoped that the dying fire in the nearby grate would be sufficient heat to keep him warm.  When he looked up, Draco saw that Harry was crossing the room to join him, and that he, at least, had had the foresight to slip a jumper on.  A hideous bright red jumper with a yellowy 'H' on it, but a source of heat nonetheless.  It clashed horribly with his green checked pyjamas, but for once, the fashion critic within Draco was silenced – he was far too busy noting how adorably sleep-rumpled Harry was.
Harry couldn’t help the grin that crossed his face at Blaise's words. When she'd joined the Ministry, Pansy had experienced more than her fair share of harassment, and Harry had been grudgingly impressed with the way she'd handled both her detractors and herself.
is a bit much."  Harry gulps greedily at his coffee.  "Strongly disapproves would be more appropriate."
"Is that everything?"  Draco emerged from the ensuite bathroom, a stack of fresh towels in his hands.
Harry sighed softly and turned to look out of the window again. "It's beautiful, isn't it?"  he asked, nestling back into Draco's embrace.
"Well, there's that, obviously," Malfoy agrees.  "But that's three days away.  I assume you'll want to sleep at some point during that time."
Despite the rekindled relationship with her sister, Andromeda rarely brought her up in front of Harry.  Something he was more than happy to encourage.  He’d paid his debt to Narcissa Malfoy during the trials, and though he’d offered nothing in defence of her husband, Harry had no doubt that his testimony had been key in releasing both her and her son.  He kept his thoughts to himself, though. He couldn’t begrudge Andromeda the only family she had left.  And Teddy too.  However, much it irked him.
"Both, I think.  I mean, I've always wanted one of those big walk-in showers.  But sometimes after a sixteen-hour shift, you just want to soak in the tub, you know?"
"We talked," Harry protested.  "There wasn't much of...well, you know."  He squirmed uncomfortably.  "I don't want to rush things between us this time."
Struck a little dumb at the sight, Harry stared in lieu of words.  Malfoy, having spotted Harry at much the same time, shifted uncomfortably in his position by the till.  At first, Harry suspected it was embarrassment at being caught in his new uniform, but then he spotted a familiar potion bottle in Malfoy's hand.  What kind of world was it when he had more in common with Draco Malfoy then he did his best friends?
“Very well. What else have you heard about the boy?” Voldemort stayed close to me. I forced myself to meet his scarlet eyes.
“Buffoon!  That’s the best thing you’ve called me!”  He kept laughing, nearly keeling over. “Okay, okay!”  He pressed the bridge of his nose.  “Okay, I’m sorry. Just—”  He started laughing again then let out a long sigh.  “Okay, I’m okay now.”  He looked at me suppressing a smile.
He'd seen Draco mostly naked plenty of times, but something about undressing him felt different.  Harry felt almost guilty when unbuttoning the light blue shirt but let out a sigh of relief noticing the white undershirt.  Draco giggled as Harry pulled the shirt off his shoulders, wiggling to make it harder.
“Is it…” He whispered, their heavy breaths mingling together in front of them.  They had plenty of heated make-outs during or after the movies, but were careful in touching each other, even if they were shirtless the night before.  Both had countless scars and insecurities and neither serious relationships before this.  Draco nodded and Harry’s hand slipped under the hem.  He ran his thumb along the soft skin just above Draco’s trousers before slipping his hand up to his waist.  Draco pulled him in again before slipping his own hands under the collar of Harry’s flannel and over the tatty old band shirt he wore underneath it.
“Why would I lie?”  He laughed, almost maniacally.  “My best friend hates my guts, the whole school is weary of my existence, even Dumbledore isn’t particularly happy about me right now, and I’m about to compete in a tournament people three or four years older than me die in,”  he rushed out all in one breath.  He paused and held up his hands.  “I really have nothing left to lose.”
“Yes. Pansy,” I chuckled. She smiled knowingly again as if she knew there was more I wasn’t telling her.
"Hi." Draco raised his hand as the other boys laughed. Harry shook his head and leaned over the bar to order.
“No, no,” I laughed airly.  “I just saw you had a dog with you.  You never told me you have a dog.”  His brows rose slightly and nodded.
“Okay.  Well, if not,” I whispered.  I drew his face up to mine and pressed a kiss on his lips.  I felt him smile against me as I pulled him closer.  “A good luck kiss,” I murmured against him.  He laughed lightly, his eyes still closed as I gently grazed my hand down his next and pulled him into an embrace.
A few minutes later, I wasn’t the only one staring — most of the class drew their attention from the book to Hermione’s defiance.  Umbridge finally looked at Hermione.
“Do you mind a cleaning spell?” Harry asked.  Draco paused a moment, frozen from the sight of Harry on his knees, hair plastered against his face, cheeks red and lips wet and plump, before frantically nodding.  Harry mumbled the spell and Draco gasped at the cool magic filling him up.  Harry smiled before wrapping his mouth around Draco’s cock again.  His hands explored further, one finger slipping into Draco’s crack and massaging slightly.  Draco dropped his head back at the sudden overwhelming pleasure emanating everywhere Harry was touching.  He accidentally bucked his hips forward.  Harry pulled back and gagged slightly and Draco looked back down.
"You're a bit of a tosser," Harry laughed. They shared a look, speaking unnecessary words they both considered for many years. Harry felt a pull in his gut he hadn't felt with any of the people who had asked him on dates in the past year; Draco similarly felt this pull but couldn't recognise what it meant right away.
“Well, we ended up arguing about his mouthing off to Umbridge and it got way too heated.  He started going off about…”  I waved my fork around and Pansy nodded understanding.  “The current situation with the Ministry and all and he went off about defending ourselves and all that.  Of course, I can’t tell him just how complicated it all is!  My father…”  I waved the fork again, knowing I couldn’t say exactly what was on my mind.  She nodded again, staring down at the table.  “Well, you know.  He knows too, just not the extent of it.  So then he stormed off before we could really even see each other.  We met today during lunch and he apologised and said how stressed he’s been and all and I said it was alright.  He’s got detention tonight but we agreed to meet while I’m on my Prefect rounds.”  She nodded again.
"Really?"  Draco's jaw dropped.  He had only ever seen Harry with girls but then, as he thought about the lingering glances he'd caught Harry stealing at blokes throughout the years, he also wasn't entirely surprised.  He was more in shock that Harry could potentially reciprocate the slight feelings he was just coming to terms with it.
“He’s not really wrong honey.”  I rolled my eyes.  “Still! This is great!”  She gave me a big hug, and I laughed into her shoulder.
“There’s also the fact you literally scream about me all the time!”  He straightened his back, grabbed his jacket, lifted his chin, and mimicked in a loud and pompous tone—  “Potter this, Potter that!”  He shook his head, smiling.  “You really need to work on being more subtle.”
.  I groaned as I rolled out of bed before quickly dressing and fixing my hair.  I try to smile in the mirror.
“Do you want help or not?”  I pointed my wand at his glasses.  He glared at me as he held out his hand.
“But I could’ve been nice to you.  I could’ve not spread rumours about you.  Or pushed you down in the halls.  I could’ve not been a complete ass!”  I stood up.
“Well, we’re reading just now.  If you have other queries we can deal with them at the end of class,” Umbridge said.
“Always when I’m looking at you.”  He pressed a kiss on Draco’s chest before reaching for his trousers again.  “Is this okay?” Harry asked softly, tugging at the belt loops.  Draco felt himself melt at the raspiness in Harry’s voice and eagerly lifted his hips.  Harry fumbled with the button, struggling to get it open before he dropped his head with a laugh.  “Merlin.”  He yanked on the button and tugged the trousers down a bit, exposing Draco’s pants and a small wet patch.  Draco chuckled and reached for Harry’s trousers, undoing the button swiftly and pulling them down.  Harry kicked off the trousers, tossing them somewhere on the floor.  Draco squirmed out of his, dropping them at Harry’s feet.
“Let’s see,”  He said, in his silkiest voice.  “Fifty points from Gryffindor and a detention each for Potter and Weasley.  Now get inside, or it’ll be a week’s worth of detentions.”  We all entered Potions and began class.
Pansy stayed the night with me but neither of us slept much.  I fell asleep in her lap at one point but woke up shortly after a nightmare.  We didn’t talk much.  My mind felt numb to any new thoughts.  The screams of the crowd kept echoing in my head.  As morning rolled around, a Prefect knocked on the door, informing us that breakfast would be mandatory.
“Well, good afternoon!” she said when finally the whole class had sat down.  A few people mumbled in reply.  Pansy and I shared a look and stayed silent.  “Tut, tut,” said Professor Umbridge.  “That won’t do, now, will it?  I should like you, please, to reply ‘Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge.’  One more time, please.  Good afternoon, class!”
“Look Draco!  They quoted you!” Goyle exclaimed, spitting bits of food across the table.  I mentally groaned, wondering why I ever became friends with the oaf.  I read down, and sure enough, my father had used something I said over the summer, tweaking the words a bit.
“You return to Hogwarts tomorrow Draco?” He hissed, causing me to nearly choke on the water I was sipping.
“Did you want to ask something about the chapter, dear?”  she asked Hermione, as though she had only just noticed her.
"Harry,"  Draco said calmly, looking up at Harry, who's mouth dropped open.  "I'm alright.  Just a bit of a headache."  Draco leaned his head back and rubbed his temples as Harry stood, watching.
"I'll get you some water,"  Harry mumbled, fleeing the room.  Draco racked his brain, trying to remember what happened at the club and afterwards.  Loud music, bright lights, a body very close to his own that smelled like sweat and apples, the body taking his hand, going to the bar, another round of shots — a wave of nausea washed over him as he remembered the last round.  Harry came back in the room with a glass, handing it to Draco.
“Yeah, I’ll go first.”  Harry smiled and squeezed my hand.  “See you soon,”  He whispered before walking back to the castle.  I stayed a few minutes after he walked in before going back to my room.
“Miss Parkinson I presume?” He asked, looming over my shoulder, arching a brow.  A test, to see if Pansy could handle the pressure.
"You were banging around in here so I came to make sure you were alright!"  Draco chuckled and rubbed his jaw.
Patronus went on to become quite popular, playing many underground shows before being invited to perform at larger venues.  They became quite well known, and in May, they received an invitation to perform at the local pride event.  Jasper was openly gay, and Harry had eventually figured out he was pansexual, so they agreed happily to play sets on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday.
Breakfast went by peaceful, and Draco was thankful for the pancakes curing his hangover.  They moved throughout the day lazily, neither bothering to change out of their sweats.  Shortly after breakfast, and deciding not to do the dishes, Harry put on a record — Frank Sinatra's Songs For Young Lovers — and dropped onto his sofa, humming along to the soft jazz.  Draco joined him shortly after, with a mug of tea, on his own sofa, Mittens curling up in his lap.  Harry laid back, hands tucked beneath his head and Draco watched, no longer worried that the dark-haired boy would catch his stolen glances.  Eventually, Harry began singing along to the fourth track, Like Someone In Love.
“So . . . on my whistle, Harry and Cedric!” said Bagman.  “Three — two — one —”  With that, a short whistle sounded and Harry and Diggory darted into the maze.  I sighed as I lost sight of Harry.  The other two champions were let in soon after and the horrid waiting time began.  I watched the clock tick by — 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes.  Around an hour I decided to stop watching the clock and instead focus on watching the maze.  I zoned out until something landed on the grass outside the entrance.  Immediately a crowd surrounded the area, screams and hushes escaping their mouths.  The spectators slowly quieted before—
, but then I remembered a problem I thought about last night.  We need to find a new place to meet. Might as well use this time wisely. I got dressed quickly, favouring a jacket over school robes, and left quietly into the early morning.
"Malfoy, it supposed to rain all night.  Just for tonight and I'll take him to a shelter tomorrow."  Harry pouted and held the kitten up to his face, who let out a quiet mew.  "Please?"  Draco huffed and threw up his arms.
“I know.”  A few minutes later, Harry stood up and walked out of the Great Hall.  Pansy and I followed suit shortly after, going to the library to work before our rounds.  We stayed there for three painstaking hours before going to the dungeons to drop our bags off and start our rounds.  After scolding a few straggling first years, the halls grew empty and quiet, and we grew exceedingly bored.
“I just can’t sit here idly while Voldemort regains his power and strength and let everyone else do nothing!  That’s what he wants!  He wants everyone else to be powerless and weak so he can attack us at—”
“He’s probably just tired and stressed.  Wouldn’t blame him,” Pansy whispered as he disappeared behind us.  I nodded as we walked back to the dungeons.
“Of course.”  Pansy entwined our fingers as we left the Common Room.  The castle felt much more alive than when we left it in July — a soft murmur could be heard throughout and the ending summer left the air warm.  I felt a rush at the realisation I wouldn’t have to eat with the Dark Lord for a few more months.  I sat down with Pansy, feeling my shoulders relax as I took a plateful of food.  The Great Hall was noisy with chatter and laughter as the heads of the houses handed out schedules.  Snape unceremoniously dropped a parchment on my plate.
“Well, we all know he and that oaf were close,” Goyle laughed.  I rolled my eyes.  Harry told me many times how important Hagrid was to him, how he was the one to save him from the Dursleys and was the first one to show him magic.  He even brought him to buy his wand and robes in Diagon Alley the first time we met.
“Your father was there,” He stated quickly.  My stomach dropped.  My father.  My breath became ragged and the world spun as I stared back at Harry.  I couldn’t decode the mess in his eyes — pity, guilt, fear, and resentment.
"Grab the cans,"  Harry nudged Draco.  Harry handed off one of the boxes as they stepped outside.  "Alright, try it."  Draco scrunched his nose again.
.” The contents of Harry’s potion vanished; he was left standing foolishly beside an empty cauldron. “Those of you who have managed to read the instructions, fill one flagon with a sample of your potion, label it clearly with your name, and bring it up to my desk for testing,” said Snape.  “Homework: twelve inches of parchment on the properties of moonstone and its uses in potion-making, to be handed in on Thursday.”  Pansy and I began cleaning up and sampling our potion.  Harry darted out of the room as soon as the bell rang.
"Shall we?"  Draco cockily held out his arm.  Harry rolled his eyes, trying to suppress a smile, and took it as they apparated away.
“Keep this between us?”  He nodded, smiled and walked into the castle.  I stood outside alone for a few more minutes, both to distance us and to regain my composure.  I walked into the castle, but as soon as I got in the doors, someone grabbed my arm and yanked me into an empty hallway.
“Shove off Malfoy.”  He wrenched his arm from my grip and raised a brow.  “I’m perfectly capable of walking myself.”  I scoffed and grabbed his arm again, this time much closer to his hand.  A small smile flickered on his lips.
any more boring?” Pansy groaned as we walked out of class.  We had a short break before Potions that we spent leisurely strolling through the halls.  First years ran about, trying to find their next classroom.  Second, third and four years hung out in groups, loudly talking and laughing.  Many fifth, sixth and seventh years paired off, whether as prefects or couples happy to see each other after the summer.  I silently wished Harry and I could do the same — meet in the halls, hold hands, sweet kisses on the cheek before class, sit by the lake during lunch, all of it.
“They let him off,” He sneered as soon as he stepped foot in the room. My mother and I both flinched at his sudden presence. “
I followed the next few days in a similar fashion until a few days before the Leaving Feast.  Pansy came in to check on me late in the evening and found me lying on my bed, staring at the ceiling.
“Draco,” He whispered.  Harry’s eyes searched Draco’s flushed face before quickly pulling his hand out from Draco’s shirt.
Eventually, I decided to just go to Charms early.  The first class of the term was spent fumbling through an overview of the syllabus as well as a long speech pertaining to our future careers, O.W.L.s and eventually N.E.W.T.s.  I let my mind wander through most of the period, thankful to finally have free thoughts again…  A few times Pansy kicked me under the table to keep me from falling asleep.
“Detention, Mr Potter!  Tomorrow evening.  Five o’clock.  My office.  I repeat, this is a lie.  The Ministry of Magic guarantees that you are not in danger from any Dark wizard.”  I suppressed a dark laugh.  “If you are still worried, by all means come and see me outside class hours.  If someone is alarming you with fibs about reborn Dark wizards, I would like to hear about it.  I am here to help.  I am your friend.  And now, you will kindly continue your reading.  Page five, ‘Basics for Beginners’.”  Professor Umbridge sat down behind her desk again. Harry quickly stood up.  Hermione tugged at his sleeve but he pushed her away.
The night was long and the morning even longer as Blaise continued with his unnecessary bitching around our room.  Finally, I left and walked to breakfast.  My hands felt heavy and my stomach had sunk to my feet.  I took a bit of food but ended up staring at it more than I did eating it.
“Let’s find Blaise, Crabbe and Goyle before we do our first round.”  Pansy and I only had to walk through a few cars before we found their compartment.
“I’ll go to Diagon Alley now to buy the new books,” My mother said, taking the book list from me. “Do you need anything else dear?” I shook my head.
“It’s getting dark, we should probably head back,”  Harry said after a few moments of silence.  I smiled and nodded.  The sun had just set behind the treeline, the sky now purple and the air much chillier than when we first came out.
Harry removed his fingers and reached for a condom from the nightstand.  After putting it on, he grabbed the bottle again, lubing his cock.  Draco looked up at the sudden emptiness but didn’t mind watching Harry lubing himself.  The dark hair on his chest was matted with sweat and bottom lip drawn up between his teeth.
"Even without the prospect of the lovely Martha visiting?"  Draco leans forward, arms resting on the counter, and his mouth quirked in a teasing sort of smile that makes Harry want to kiss him very badly.  He's imagining doing just that when it becomes apparent that Draco is waiting for an answer, and Harry has no idea what has been said.
Hermione slipped into the chair opposite.  She reached across the table and placed her hand over Harry's.  "How was it?"
Pansy rolled her eyes.  "I think it's a bit early to speculate about that.  George and I are just having fun at the moment."
Harry turned around completely in Draco's arms now and gently brushed the sleep-mussed hair back from his face.  "You're sure your mum won't be mad at us for just disappearing like this?"
Harry's gaze shifted to meet his, and Draco was startled to feel the touch of Harry's hand as it came to rest on top of his own.
From the look on his face it was evident that Draco did not agree.  "It was the clothes that were the final straw for Mother," he continued.
"How come?"  Harry didn't mean to pry, not really, but he was only human.  "I mean, your parents, they didn't..."  He tailed off and rubbed the back of his neck with one hand – uncertain how to phrase the question.
“Fuck’s sake!” Harry flung back his duvet and braved bare feet on the cold floor.  With another muttered curse, he hurried over and yanked the window open.  A rather disapproving tawny owl ruffled its feathers and hooted something that Harry had no doubt would be rude if he could understand.  He snatched the parchment from the owl’s outstretched leg and, as he tore it open, pondered which hex he should use on whoever was to blame for disturbing his sleep. A quick scan to the bottom of the letter revealed the culprit and did nothing to relieve the scowl on Harry’s face.
After walking for forty-five minutes, Harry finally realised that one, it was cold and they were very far from home and two, he was a wizard.  He stopped, causing Draco to nearly fall arse over tit before Harry caught him.
“Maybe,” I muttered so that only Harry could hear me.  “The stupid great oaf’s got himself badly injured.”
They looked each other up and down, admiring the views.  Draco’s eyes locked on the dark hair covering Harry’s broad, tanned chest, trailing down his navel to his green pants.    Draco laid back on the red sheets, legs slightly apart.  Harry’s gaze travelled upwards from Draco’s knees to his pants, his fingers longing to touch the soft downy hair on Draco’s thighs.
“I’m fine on my own, Malfoy,”  He sneered. He stood up, brushed off his clothes and tried to balance his broken glasses on his face.  He cursed when he realised they were pretty smashed up.
“If I didn’t think you were setting me up, I actually would laugh.”  He cocked his head and crossed his arms.  “But since this seems like exactly that, I’m just gonna head back to my room now and contemplate everything about the tournament.”  He turned on his heel and began towards the castle.
“Then try not to get detention.”  I straightened his glasses as he tiredly glared at me.  He looked more like an angry, sleep-deprived kitten and I suppressed a giggle.
“The Draught of Peace,” said Harry tensely.  I bit the inside of my cheek to prevent laughing.  That was most certainly not the Draught of Peace.
“Don’t worry about it.  I know you do,” I mumbled against his lips.  He paused for a moment before pulling back.  My stomach dropped.
"Potter? Who the hell is Potter?" Jasper laughed loudly, grabbing the extra shot Harry had ordered. Harry glared at Draco, praying that he would just go along with it.
“This is bullshit,” Pansy muttered, trying to get a bowtruckle to agree with her.  I laughed lightly and glanced over my shoulder.  Harry was talking quickly to Hermione, who looked much more focused on the classwork.  She sighed heavily before answering him.  I shifted to hear her better.  Pansy raised an eyebrow but let me move anyways, likely figuring it would be more interesting than the assignment.
On the morning of Harry’s trial, I found myself in the drawing-room with my parents, once again trying helplessly to read another book. My mother had decided to join us that morning, disapproving of my father’s next trip to the Ministry. She had an amazing ability to communicate only through glances and pursed lips. This morning she spent sending glares his way. He ignored her, reading the paper instead.
The flat was small and sparsely decorated.  The door opened into a hall with a kitchen to the left and a living room next to it.  The living room was painted with grey walls and a sturdy fireplace with a hefty supply of floo powder sat against one wall.  Two black couches faced each other and a full bookshelf sat behind one of them.  The kitchen was fully stocked with kitchenware and some food basics.
“As long as you have studied the theory hard enough, there is no reason why you should not be able to perform the spells under carefully controlled examination conditions,” said Professor Umbridge dismissively.
All too soon, it was the day before the last task and Harry and I were meeting in the warm June air, surrounded by wildflowers we didn’t know bloomed there.
"I—" Draco wasn't sure what he was starting to say, but thankfully Harry cut him off before he had to make an excuse.
“Hey you,” Harry laughed, stumbling through the vines.  I turned around to greet him with a smile.  He looked better than the other night — hair washed, eyes bright, a slight pep in his step even.  His bright smile covered half his face as he walked quickly over to me.
“Very much,” Draco mumbled before pulling Harry down into a hungry kiss.  Both men sighed and Harry tucked an arm under Draco’s waist, holding their bodies close together.  Draco felt flooded with warmth as Harry’s tongue slid into his mouth and teeth grazed his lips.  Harry’s free hand gripped Draco’s hip before reaching for the hem of his shirt.  He broke the kiss before giving it a gentle tug.
A week or two later, Harry woke up to yelling coming from Draco's room.  He instantly grabbed his wand and rushed in, quietly opening the door.  He lowered his wand when he realised there was no one else in the room — Draco was the one screaming.  He was lying nearly still on his back, yelling random things.
“Us!”  Harry let go of me and took a step back, motioning his hands wildly.  “All of us against Voldemort!  The Ministry is being ignorant and—”  I put my hands up.
Both men suffered from nightmares and would wake up in cold sweats during the nights.  Most of the time, they weren't bad enough to wake the other.  However, once in a while, one would have to shake the other awake to make sure they were alright.  Harry had the tendency to toss and turn and react quickly when he was woken up, which Draco learned one night when he heard a ruckus in Harry's room and went to check on him.  When he opened the door, he saw Harry thrashing around in his bed.
"Hey, that's okay."  Draco's gaze shot up to Harry's face.  He wasn't sure what he was expecting — surprise, maybe even for him to jump back or leave.  "Really.  Look, I'm bisexual."  Harry laughed.
“Don’t worry, I’ll make sure you pass the class,” I chuckled, pouring in the next ingredient.  Almost an hour later, Pansy’s previously perfect hair was frizzy and I could feel sweat dripping down my neck.  I glanced over to Harry’s table, and the three didn’t seem to be doing much better.  Hermione’s hair reached peak frizziness and she stared at the board, seeming to put the potion to memory; Weasel’s hair was damp against his forehead and was doing much worse than Hermione, instead, staring at his potion with his brow furrowed and a slight grimace; and Harry’s glasses were slipping down his nose, his robes in disarray and his potion gleamed a wicked green — nowhere close to being any colour it should be right now.  I let my eyes linger on him for a moment, admiring the thin strip of skin exposed from the undone top button, his tie hanging loose and the bit of his bottom lip he drew up between his teeth.  I swallowed thickly, pulling my mind away from thoughts inappropriate for class.  I looked down at my own ingredients and took a deep breath — I’d probably need more moonstone.  Perfect.  I quickly pulled out a scrap of parchment and scribbled a note on it.
“Okay.”  Harry moved his lips to my jawline, mumbling as he kissed me.  “I love you.  I’m sorry I didn’t get to say that last night.”  I sighed deeply as he returned to my lips.
“Drop it.”  We walked silently to the Great Hall and joined the other Slytherins for dinner.  My muscles still hadn’t relaxed from the last class.  Pansy watched me with a careful eye.  The hall was loud with gossip of Harry’s outburst during Umbridge’s class.  I tried to tune it out.
"Look!"  Harry said with as much enthusiasm as a kid on Christmas morning, holding up the kitten.  Draco's eyes widened and he started shaking his head.
“Pansy, what if someone sees us?”  I paced my room as Pansy reclined on my bed, painting her nails.  I had changed out of my formal robes into a comfortable jumper over my button-up and dress pants.
“I see no difference,”  Snape said calmly.  Granger’s eyes filled with tears as she ran out of the corridor.  Harry and Ron both started screaming insults at Snape, but thankfully due to the echo in the hall, Snape couldn’t pick out the exact words but understood the point.
"Yeah, I'll join you soon." Harry smiled as the other three left the backstage area, leaving him sitting on an amp, nursing a stale tasting bottle of water. His skin felt on fire and muscles weak. He could feel his magic ripple under his skin in a way he hadn't felt in months. He couldn't decide if he wanted to drown his feelings in liquor, sleep for twelve hours or get lost in a crowd of sweaty bodies in the coloured lights. He only moved when the next band came through the hall, deciding it best to find his mates. As he left down the side ramp to the crowd, Harry's eyes caught on that sharp face again. Merlin's beard.
“And would you defend our cause to the best of your ability, risk your life, use the Unforgivable Curses,
“Good.  Let’s keep it that way.”  Harry laid his head against my chest and sighed contently.  I wrapped my arm around his shoulders and chuckled lightly as he intertwined our legs.
"Sure."  Harry sat on one end of the couch and Draco laid down, laying his head on Harry's lap.  Harry softly ran his course fingers through Draco's silky hair.  He had kept the same cut he had in school but was more lenient with his gel usage now.  Instead, he let his hair part in the middle and frame his face delicately.  Harry thought it made his sharp features look softer and gave him a boyish charm he lacked during the war.
“Wouldn’t be the first time,” I muttered. “Do you plan to attend the trial?” I asked, turning back to my book.
“Harry.”  I reached out and grabbed his arm.  He looked down at my hand then up at my face with a dark look in his eye before wrenching his arm away and stomping away again.  “Harry, wait!”  He disappeared through the vines.  “Fucking
“There, now,” said Professor Umbridge sweetly.  I couldn’t help the sneer that formed on my face.  Her voice sounded like nails on a blackboard but with an out of tune orchestra backing it.  “That wasn’t too difficult, was it?  Wands away and quills out, please.”  I shared a look with Pansy; the order “wands away” has never yet been followed by a lesson we’ve found interesting. We slipped our wands into our bags and pulled out parchment and quills.  Professor Umbridge opened her handbag, extracted her own wand, which was an unusually short one, and tapped the blackboard sharply with it; words appeared on the board at once:
“Okay, Harry.”  By now, the sun had nearly set over the lake, casting a soft orange light across the landscape.  The air was chilled, fall tidings creeping in.  I shivered slightly.  “I think we should head back.  It’s getting a bit chilly now.”
"Pansy dragged me out here," Draco laughed and shoved his hands into his pockets. "So this is where you disappeared to after the war." He smiled to try to cover up the wavering in his voice.
“Spare me the lecture, Malfoy,”  He mumbled, trying to straighten himself out.  I looked at him for a moment before reaching my hand out to him.  He glanced from my hand to my face and I tried to look forgiving.  I don’t know how that is supposed to feel on my face.  “Huh?”
“Hey, remember, anytime you need to sort out your feelings, I'm here for you,” She teased.  I laughed.  Blaise came around the corner and instantly glared at me.  I knew he had a major crush on Pansy, but right now, she was mine.  Or at least acting like mine.  I raised an eyebrow and gave him the famous Malfoy smirk. He sped up in front of us. Pansy rolled her eyes and I laughed.
“I know.”  He leaned in for another kiss.  I smiled against his lips.  “By the way,” He mumbled, pulling away again.  “Did you mean anything by what you said when you were leaving yesterday?”  I cocked my head and tried to keep my eyes from widening too much.
“Hey.”  Harry stopped pacing and turned to me with his brows furrowed and a forced smile.  His eyes were dark and his hair ratty.  His already too big clothes seemed to hang off his body more than normal.  He hadn’t been eating or sleeping.
"Uh, yeah! Sure!" Draco stammered, thanking Merlin the lights covered up his blushing cheeks. Harry grabbed his wrist and started manoeuvring them through the crowd. Both men made a silent pact to ignore the sparks exploding from Harry's grasp.
“I know.  I need to.”  My voice warbled.  I needed to tell him even more now, with everything happening.  Pansy shifted and held her arms out.
“Say you were expecting me.”  She shrugged again.  I stopped for a moment and glared at her.  She smiled sweetly and went back to painting her nails.
“I dragged you out here to actually tell you something!”  I whipped around, glaring at him.  “But since you seem to be in an intolerable mood—”
“No, of course not. I wouldn’t befriend a blood traitor like him.” My voice warbled and she gave me a knowing look. “The rest of the year was fine. Quite boring really. Besides the Tournament and Yule Ball of course.”
“Thank you, Pansy, for everything.”  I smiled at her. We could have been a good couple if we cared enough and actually wanted to.  I wrapped my arm around her shoulders.  “Now come on, let’s get to class.”
“I wonder if Potter will blow up at the new professor here too,” Blaise said quietly as we got closer to the hut.  A group of students were already surrounding the new professor.
“Draco.  Call me, Draco.”  I stepped towards him.  “If we’re going to even try to be friends, let alone anything else, I want you to call me Draco.”  I smiled.  I liked being kind to him.
“Ten points from Gryffindor, Mr Potter.”  The classroom was silent and still. Everyone was staring at either Umbridge or Harry.  “Now, let me make a few things quite plain.”  Professor Umbridge stood up and leaned toward us.  “You have been told that a certain Dark wizard has returned from the dead —”
“I know.  You’re doing your best Harry.”  I rubbed light circles on his back, trying to soothe his tense muscles.
"C'mon." Draco gently took it and let Harry lead them into the crowd. Their hearts beat to the beat of the music as Harry turned around to face Draco. Draco noted how his dancing had greatly improved since their fourth year, now that Harry had actually gained a sense of rhythm. He didn't let go of Draco's hand, instead pulling him close as the bodies pressed in around them. A dazed smiled covered Harry's face that made Draco nearly melt. They gravitated towards each other as the music faded from their focus. Before either knew it, their lips met, and everything stopped for a moment.
“Goodnight Dray.  Love you.”  I nodded.  I pulled away and took his arm again, dragging him the rest of the way to the tower.
“I’m going on a walk.”  I promptly stood up from the table.  Pansy sighed heavily as I walked out of the Great Hall.  I walked around mindless for a few minutes before trying to figure out how to get Harry alone.
As the students finished eating and the food began clearing away, Dumbledore stood again, ceasing the rising chatter instantly.
Draco stirred quietly, letting out a soft moan.  Harry felt a blush creeping up his cheeks as Draco began waking up.  His eyes fluttered open lightly.  He looked at Harry and smiled before startling and shifting back on the bed.
“Don’t you trust me?” Harry asked softly.  I felt my heart weep at his tone — a child scared to be in trouble, a
And many a drink he had that night until he was draped across the couch in a less than elegant way watching Harry play with the tiny kitten.  He fell asleep with his head nearly falling off the couch.
“Okay, Draco,”  I smiled even more.  He somehow made my name sound magic.  “But you’ll have to call me Harry.” He smiled now, and it was the most real I’d seen on his face in a long enough time.
"Right of course," Harry smiled. Draco's eyes gleamed under the flashing coloured lights, and Harry tried to keep his breath steady. Draco untangled himself with a dazed smile gracing his face and pulled his phone out to text Pansy. He drafted a sloppy text saying he was with Harry and was fine before turning his attention back to Harry. He was still moving to the music but kept his eyes fixed on Draco.
“I do not wish to criticize the way things have been run in this school, but you have been exposed to some very irresponsible wizards in this class, very irresponsible indeed — not to mention, extremely dangerous half-breeds,” She finished with a wicked giggle.
"Bit of a tosser really," Draco mumbled. Harry pursed his lips before bursting out in laughter. "What? What did I say?" Draco leaned back. Harry shook his head, his body shaking with laughter.
"I've got— hmm—" Harry pulled away slightly as Draco kept leaning in. "I've got a flat, not too far from here—"
“A note! Potions!”  My eyes widened.  Oh hell no, not in public.  “Snape won't deduct more than five points for passing notes if he catches you.”  I thought for a moment.  What do I have to lose, other than my dignity?
.  Dumbledore turned, his eyebrows raised slightly.  He nodded slightly, sitting back down.  The other professors stared at the short lady in surprise.  I smirked.
Now eye level with Draco, Harry was pleased to see the same soft down on Draco’s legs surrounding his very hard cock.  Bracing himself with his arms around Draco’s thighs and hands on his arse, Harry placed a light kiss on the tip before slowly encircling his cock with his mouth.  A quiet string of curses left Draco’s mouth as Harry bobbed his head, happily tasting the sweat lightly covering Draco.  He kneaded his hands gently into Draco’s arse.  He pulled off with a pop to look up at Draco.
“And it’s meant to feel… that good?”  Draco’s eyes remained wide and mouth hanging open.  Harry nodded and kissed Draco’s cheek.
“Harry?”  I took a few steps forward and gently rested my hand on his shoulder.  He leant into it and I saw the tears threatening to spill over.
Just as I started serving myself some eggs, Blaise came running in and threw something on the table in front of me.
“I do now.”  We joined the others at the Slytherin table.  I’d glance over to Harry’s usual spot but it remained empty throughout breakfast.
"Draco," Harry decided to whisper.  Draco inhaled deeply before slowly opening his eyes.  He wasn't sure what he was expecting — anger, surprise, fear, rejection — but what he met was what he could only describe as anxious curiosity.  Harry carefully slid his hand from Draco's shoulder, up his neck, to rest at the base of his jaw, afraid that if he moved too fast, he might startle Draco.  Draco remained frozen, relishing Harry's touch for what he was nearly sure would be the last time.  "Draco, I..."  Harry's train of thought left him completely when he glanced down to Draco's lips for a split second.
“Will do!”  She drew the curtains around the bed and casted a silencing charm before I shouted a string of curses.  “Draco, a relationship is supposed to make you happy, not stressed out,” Pansy commented, patting her lap.  I shifted and laid my head in her lap.
“To retrieve something we’d ‘sorely miss’.”  Harry shrugged.  “I mean, Ron is practically my brother; I don’t know what I’d do without him.  I guess Dumbledore doesn’t really know about us anyways.”
I kept my eyes on the red vines, carefully following them as they wove through the forest.  I counted the trees as I passed them.  Five… six… seven… Just past the seventh tree, the vines began climbing a nearby tree, connecting a handful of small trees to form almost a wall.  I looked back towards the castle and found that, though I had only walked for just over five minutes, the castle was entirely out of sight and the seventh tree was a few yards behind me.  I followed the rest of the vines through the tree and made a tunnel to a small curtain of green vines. I pushed away a few vines and peeked into a small, enclosed area.
Draco, like Harry, decided to get out of the limelight after he finished his eighth year.  He had to return to Hogwarts as a part of his post-war retribution.   However, as soon as they graduated, Draco and Pansy moved to a town an hour outside of Edinburgh.   Draco worked as a grocer, a relief from the constant attention from the media, and as a means to support himself after donating much of the Malfoy fortune after the war ended.  Pansy had convinced him to come to pride with her, saying he could maybe finally meet a nice guy, and even if he didn't, he could help her find a nice girl.  Once he had agreed, Pansy may have gone a little overboard.   She bought a semi-permanent hair dye to dye the gay flag on Draco's head; she bought him a large flag, small flag, t-shirt with the flag, rainbow suspenders, rainbow bracelets, as well an assortment of chokers and ear cuffs.
"Wonderful.  Your father and I are expecting some friends around later.  It's so much nicer when we adults can be...silly in private."
Ron turned back to the TV and resumed his channel surfing.  “I was just saying,” he muttered.  “Forgive me for thinking you’d be interested in my life.”
It was early enough in the day that most people were still in their offices pretending to be busy, rather than loitering around corridors in search of gossip. So they made it to the Floo chambers without interruption.
But it was clear that he was making an effort, and when the time came for them to finally leave, it was Potter who suggested the walk to the Apparition point together.
The looks they'd got on the platform in King's Cross had been bad enough, but the sight of Harry Potter wearing Auror robes (albeit those of a probationer) on platform 9 ¾'s had caused such a flurry of excitement amongst the assembled crowd that they had barely noticed the arrival of the train carrying their loved ones.
Draco had barely made contact with the soft feathers when Hedwig took flight.  Her magnificent wings beating frantically, she hovered over Draco, screeching loudly, her talons spread as if in threat.  Draco's first reaction was to reach for his wand, especially when he felt a sharp claw graze his scalp.  But he knew just how fond Harry was of his pet, and Draco couldn't quite bring himself to harm the animal.
“Sorry.” Harry knew she didn’t mean it as a jab, but it found its target nonetheless. “I didn’t mean to be late.” He rubbed tiredly at his face, in part to avoid seeing the confused expression on Teddy’s face.  “I should probably get out of your hair.”
