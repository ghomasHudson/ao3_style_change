To shut up everyone mouths, I let Luna paint the walls and I took a small fortune out of Gringotts so Draco can buy whatever furniture he seems good enough to spend his evenings working my ass off, because he is never going to let me slack at my job. I let him buy whatever he wanted to stop listening to his constants complains about his back or his ass hurting. And so, Draco choose a lot of things for the areas he spends most time in: the living room, the kitchen, the bathroom and my bedroom.
I draw a thin line with a knife in the center of the cake and watch Draco pass the icing pots to each, green for Scorp and yellow for James. With the help of a plain spoon they both begin to spread icing on the cake, their faces of deep concentration are an exact copy of the face that my husband makes when we were at Hogwarts, and the one he still makes when he works with other researchers in the psychiatry area of the university where he works.
"It's just..." and I breathe a sigh of relief when James begins to speak. "I like music," and his little hands are intertwined in a nervous gesture. “And they teach it at school, somedays. I am just affraid people will laugh of me if I play bad, really bad,” James' eyes fill with tears and I immediately hug my son with all my strength.
My family at the end of the day... It was always the two of them. And then Remus and James, and then little Harry. Harry, who is now scared that this kid will despise his family and destroy his heart. However, Harry materializing in the Weasleys' yard brings me out of my reverie. I immediately see the Weasley twins open the door, giving me a wide view of Harry and his mysterious boyfriend.
As if his life is worth nothing.
I'm raising my wand again making a message appears in the wall.
His words give me courage and I swallow the potions. It tastes like hell, but I can feel the magic inside of my veins and the throbbing is gone in a matter of seconds.
Draco squats down and the twins leave a kiss on their cheeks. Once he stands up, it's Teddy who clings to his chest.
And I cannot bring myself to disrispect professor Snape. My mother broke his heart because she wasn't brave enought to stand up to my own father. My own father that was a bully to professor Snape. So, even if he is evil or good, because I am not sure of that, I cannot bring myself to hate him. He tried to help Dumbledore to protect me... him? Us?
"I ask for the outside chair, I can't stand a sofa that soft and fluffy right now," he says, as he turns his neck and a couple of vertebrae pops.
Have a nice day or night.
In no time the room is swarmed by healers, Morris and Smart-Haler are here too, and the faces of both are of deep sadness. The both makes all the others healers left the room, with head shakes. Hermione leaving with them.
"I hope you decide to come in soon," she looks at us. "Both of you," she tells me in a firm whisper. “Night will approach soon and this fall is more violent than other years. I hope you still remember the halls of your old school, Mr. Potter,” she tells me in a serious tone. “Albus expects you for dinner at seven. And please, Potter...” she tells me with serious eyes.
Draco smiles at me.
Something ancient awakens within me and I know this is what Zephora Zambroni had been talking about. The seal on Dray is breaking and my blood is heating up inside my body, prompting me to claim Dray as my own.
She nods.
And suddenly, I see someone take them by the hands and I am on guard, my wand between my fingers, ready to send to hell whoever hurts my children. However, the twins smile at the white-haired lady and she leads them to the desk and they both sit on a chair.
"Winky is to change clothes too?" The little elf asks me.
"Better," he says breathlessly after a few seconds.
“I want confirmation on both sides,” she says seriously. “First your house, Mr. Potter,” she says and extend my hand for her to take.
"Well," he says raising his hand, dragging me somewhere. "Today is the day where you will give up your healthy habits and enter the best hamburger place in the world, with me." I see him hesitate for a moment and his gray eyes fix on me. "You eat meat, right?" he asks me, as if he wanted to make sure. I saw him with an amused smile playing in my lips. "If you don't eat meat, that's fine, we can go somewhere else where they make lentil burgers." His eyes sparkle and butterflies starts a strange dance in my stomach.
The noise startle me up. I look to the ceiling and I can recognize this rusty ceiling, the blinding light and the smell of potions anywhere.  I am in the infirmary…
"Shut up, Potter," and Moon takes out his wand. "Not all of us came here because of our name, some of us had to work hard to earn a spot."
And then, the hand of a Kobol is touching mine, making everything rushes back to me.
"So I had to come here," he tells me, blinking slower and slower. “But, I am happy to be here. Because you are here. This is our eternity."
"Pinky swear?" I ask him, turning me in his arms and lowering my gaze until our eyes connect.
"I am James and he is Scorpius," Scorpius replies. "And we are twins. We were born the same day." Scorpius says happily.
I conjure up the blindfold that I bought especially for this occasion and once I have it in my free hand, I show it to Dray.
The vase at the foot of the rest explodes and Winky disappear to somewhere.
I dunno, really. It was mindblowing to writte this.
He sighs. Hard.
"Oh, in that case, I hope you bring her back soon to meet her," my mother tells her happily.
He touches his mother’s forehead first, then he touches his, then he touches mine, and his fingertips touches Narcissa’s throat. Magic erupts from her body, dancing around Draco’s body in soft threads of light blue. New threads are coming out of Lucius Malfoy’s body, and a dance of winter colors starts in the room, shinning, lightning, refreshing, accepting… Until it disappears insides Draco’s spine.
"That's right, love," I reply. "Only when you're a wizard and you have a wand, it only works to kill anything that has a heartbeat," I tell him and Draco stops. Nesha looking at us both.
HARRY
"Our daughter demands our attention," Harry tells me, interpreting the little sounds that escape Nesha's mouth. "Our daughter demands affection."
I look over my own shoulder to see Draco passing behind us. He is dressed with one of my Led Zeppelin long-sleeved t-shirt, a jogger pant that I know is his and he is barefoot. He is reading something from a page and moving his lips. His free hand is running through his hair, while he keeps walking towards the kitchen. His eyes glued to his own notes, while he moves slowly.
I am left cold.
“It will taste like hell,” I whine and Draco giggles at my antics.
I nod lovingly as I open the car door. "I will accompany you wherever you want, Dray Black."
GreeneySilvery.
“Why?” I ask him, because he is still trapped inside the Hallucination.
And I can't help but laugh.
“How can you remember that?” Mione asks me.
"Don't look, Dray," I say seriously. I think about my destiny and the next moment, I feel my magic push on the barrier soft ward that sorrounded Lauren's, until it makes a crack in it. The universe swallows us and we land right in the dining room of Grimmauld Place.
"Does that scare you, Dray?"
I nod, understanding his pain. I can understand where he is coming from.
Left kuddos if you like it. And comments if you wanna tell me something. I really like when people says hi.
Smart-Healer touch my hand with hers softly.
“Well, Aurors, you know what to do,” Kingsley says before turning and leaving.
I look at him in revulsion and shifted my eyes from him to the girl in front of me.
"Harry!" Dray's voice immediately causes the horde of hippogriffs to start raging in my stomach.
"Daddy wasn't on the winning side when the war ended, but it wasn't because he made the wrong choices, James," I say, trying to be as honest as possible. “Your daddy stayed loyal to his former family, because he loved them very much, and they abussed of that love. Your Daddy saved my life when we were at war. Do you know what you can tell all those children that make you feel bad? ” James denies and his hair moves with him. “You can tell them that your Daddy's wand was the wand that defeated Voldemort. Because, your Daddy bravely threw his wand at me, in the middle of a sea of Death Eaters and in front of the face of Voldemort himself, declaring his alliance with me. ”
I have never felt so peaceful in my life. Right now, Draco is practically on top of me, his head on my chest, while the smell of his shampoo warms my soul. James and Scorpius are on the living room floor watching Bob Sponja Square Pants on the muggle television in the room. Right now I think it is a great fortune that the telly works as it should at home.
“Ok,” I say, shaking my head furiously, trying to willing those thoughts into inexistence. “There was this other weird one with two dragons and two big As there,” I say.
"Please," I plead with all the gods that exist that this is not an imagination of my head. "Please," but when I put my fingers on his neck and feel the slight pulse of his heart begin to pick up speed, I let out a sigh of relief.
"Honey," I whisper in his ear and try to print all the love I feel in my words. "My love", in the darkness of our bedroom, I reach for his hands with mine and I intertwine our fingers. "Draco, please talk to me. Tell me what's wrong."
"What do you think about what we saw today, Parkinson?" I ask her, while I look through the kitchen.
I nod gently, as I imagine my cello case in my arms and in a matter of seconds, I can feel the piece of plastic between my hands.
“DRACO! Do you realise what a fabulous chance this is? You don’t need to pin after him secretly all day anymore, you could just go and confess properly!” She exclaimed.
“So, what happened, I assume whatever it happened last night as you were out at the bar.” She stated, her brown eyes staring right through Harry.
Harry had drunk once because he’d been in the prefect’s bathroom before. But other than that, everything was going smoothly. But he had to admit, the Slytherins were being a little too cooperative tonight.
If Ron found out… this would turn out very colourful.
Draco glanced around the room, arousal all forgotten, and saw that all the Gryffindors had similar faces, either shocked or disgust. It wasn’t news to him that the Slytherin remained calm. Most purebloods can remain calm even in the most shocking situations, just like they were trained to do so. And they did so well that even the famous Harry Potter asking if a Malfoy was alright, was not enough to swoop them off their feet.
“Ugh, I never hated him!” Draco groaned, cheeks tinting pink, even though he was drunk, it still felt like confessing. “I love him for merlin’s sake!”
Why? Because it was all swallowed.
“Then take back what you just said, Potter.” Harry knew that the sentence was weak and held no power within, it was almost as if Malfoy didn’t want him to take it back.
But Ron just crossed his arms and lifted his chin.
But it never came.
Harry had just woken up when a very excited bushy-haired witch burst into the boy’s dormitories.
Maybe they could become an actual couple someday, but it’s all over now.
Before he knew it, he was back to reality.
Not being able to stand this any longer, Draco walked right past Harry with Pansy trailing behind.
Pansy smiled.
Draco just finished Potions staring at the back of Potter’s head and was walking down the corridor. He had herbology to get to next.
Draco was aware that this was not planned, but it seemed like it anyways.
Harry couldn’t do anything, because that would just make it more suspicious.
He confessed just yesterday and now there’s already a very suspicious duel issued by none other than his trusted godfather.
“But that bravery he seems to gather out of nowhere, and that luck that kept him alive all these years really amazes me. He should just change his nickname to ‘The Boy Who Just Wouldn’t Die’!” He exclaimed, not noticing the frown on the boy next to him. “Despite all his stupid Gryffindor personalities, it’s actually very hot when he pulls his hair when he can’t solve a question; he likes to scratch his cheek when he’s embarrassed; and that biting on his quill should be banned! Sometimes I think God made this guy just to torment me.” Draco ended his ramble with a sigh.
“Potter…” It was a warning.
“Why?” Did he have to ruin this? Now it’d be more impossible than impossible to find out the true meaning of those words last night, although it wasn’t possible to be more impossible than impossible anyways.
Draco was confused as to why they let it go so easily, it wasn’t like them. But ignoring the throbbing in his head telling him that something bad is going to happen, instead he also bid his friends good night and laid back on the bed.
Granger snorted.
Harry had looked everywhere—even the broom shed—but he was nowhere to be seen. He even went up to Parkinson and she didn’t know. How was he supposed to talk to someone you can’t even find?
Pansy, that sneaky Slytherin!
“I need to find Draco Malfoy,” Harry stated once Hogwarts had been rebuilt.
On the way, Draco kept on muttering about how dead he is if they bump into Potter and his stupid Gryffindor friends…But that was exactly what Pansy and Blaise had planned. Pansy had told Blaise all about Draco’s encounter and confession at the bar, and Blaise had the exact same expression as her. She planned the ‘Mission Drarry’ with him all morning and this is the first step.
Harry almost blushed at the cute pout, but the smell of alcohol stopped it. “I-I’m not Potter, whoever that is, my name is Harold.” Harry quickly corrected; he didn’t want anyone to know just yet. It was fine being someone other than the famous Harry Potter sometimes.
And that scared him. A lot.
“What do you think you’re doing, Potter!” He half-whispered, half-yelled. He’s probably too flustered to think properly, that thought left a satisfying smirk on his face. However, that just seemed to anger Malfoy even more.
Harry hadn’t even told Hermione Merlin’s sake, and he knows that she'd be the one that would accept and understand him. Harry felt betrayed, that Malfoy hadn’t kept their promise, momentarily forgetting that there weren’t any promises in the first place.
But the strange emptiness reminded him that it was only those few hours, and Draco must have left rather early.
Draco froze in his tracks to the front door.
From the corner of his eye Draco saw Granger nod in agreement and rolled his own eyes.
He imagined many scenarios where he’d made up to Malfoy and they had some heart to heart time. However, there were also some depressing scenarios that showed how Malfoy would never talk to him again.
“If I didn’t know better, Potter, I’d say you’re excited.” Draco sneered.
“Didn’t Malfoy kiss a Gryffindor? Do you have any idea who it might be?” Hermione switched the subject, Harry let out a sigh.
“What do you want Potter?”
Besides, not after everything Potter’s made Draco suffer, the disappointment from his father; hatred from the other house just because Slytherins were evil, compared to their golden saviour; and the taste of heartbreaking.
He still doesn’t know if Malfoy would choose his family over him.
Two different thoughts were thrashing around in his head, he didn’t even notice his hand reaching out for the cup seated in front of him.
“Was that Malfoy?” Hermione asked, stunned.
“He might have been a stupid Gryffindork, always diving headfirst into danger before using that useless mind of his to think about the consequences. Sometimes he acts like he’s the bloody saviour of the world, walks around the hallways like he owns the castle.” Draco muttered, getting pissed at the reminder at how stupidly annoying Potter can get.
When his brain had finally come around, he’d already drained his cup and his hand was back in his lap.
Harry stares at his hands, trembling harder than ever, his whole body was shaking as he dreadfully raised his head a centimetre to face the body lying on the floor.
Harry sighed and sat down beside Draco, relieved that he’s drunk and doesn’t recognise him.
At this point, Harry already felt like he was dreaming. And now, he just knows that this is a dream or nightmare.
Would it leave scars?
“Draco wait up!” She yelled, running.
He should’ve known this was a trap from the beginning.
“What if one day, the Dark Lord chases after me, and you can’t defeat t the death eaters?” Draco asked, dreading the answer.
He saw Malfoy murmur something under his breath that sounded suspiciously like ‘sweet merlin’, but he soon raised his head high, posed himself and opened his mouth.
Blinding pain hit him, his skin felt like it was burning off his flesh, something along the lines of a creature ripping his flesh out. His senses were gone for some time, the pain seemed to last forever, but quickly disappeared when he felt something else on his skin.
After a few seconds, he seemed to have drifted back from whatever realm he was in, and roughly shoved Harry away from him.
Draco was making his favourite tea, in the tight kitchen that was included in his small house that was just 300 pounds a month.
Once again.
Draco Malfoy.
But someone else beat him to it. A rough hand shoved him aside, allowing him to stumble to the right. From the corner of his eye, Harry saw Professor Snape rushing to Draco’s aid. He gently lifted the body from the wet ground, his robes immediately soaked. Professor Snape did it the muggle way, as they’d call it, the princess hug.
He told himself it was because of the confession. Harry never had any love as a kid, and because of that he valued love greatly, he wouldn’t blame anyone entirely for their actions if it were because of love. He couldn’t bring himself to hate Malfoy for his actions over the course of the years at Hogwarts.
Pansy mentally groaned, she knew this would happen eventually. If Draco did not get over him soon enough, he would never be truly happy.
Harry wanted to trust Draco. But from the strange acts he’d done this year, that didn’t seem possible.
“I’m leaving.”
“Alright boys, I hope you’ve learnt your lesson, I do not wish to see any repeats of today's behaviour do you hear me?”
Now, when Professor Snape tends to get mad, it’s best to stay away, but from the years Draco has spent with him, he knows that his dear godfather isn’t actually mad, it’s just doing this for reputation. That just pissed him off so much more, knowing that this was all planned.
Potter just stares at Draco, clearly impatient, “Well it wasn’t my fault you couldn’t counter or shield a simple binding spell!”
Fireworks exploded in Draco’s vision; it was nothing like the one they had last night.
“Malfoy, are you alright?”
“Harry, are you sure?” Hermione asked again, with a glint of unsure in her eyes, she acted clam, but Harry knew that she was just surprised as Ron was.
“I KNEW IT!” She screamed and ran over to pat Harry on the back.
“Voldemort was responsible for that, I think.” Harry let the name slip before he even recognised the fact that Lucius was a death eater.
“Ouch! What was that for?!” He yelled, not loud enough for the others around them to hear, but enough for the man in front of him.
He couldn’t believe it, or you could say he refused to believe it.
Draco on one hand just wants to keep this to himself, only to avoid being embarrassed horribly, but on the other hand he really wanted to rant about Harry freaking Potter right now, and the perfect person for that is right in front of him.
He looked around the place as he arrives, nothing too special about the place, except for the fact that it’s a bit cramped, because of all the brooms in there. Draco wasn’t sure if he should wait inside, in case of traps, but he quickly changed his mind as the nightly wind blew past him, sending shivers down his spine.
Granger nodded in understanding. She’s probably learnt a lot about pure-blooded wizarding families from books, was Pansy’s guess.
“You won’t even ask me why?”
“You! What did you do!” Draco exploded, he did not want to be stuck in here with Potter for one more second, whoever did this must be wanting a death warrant.
“What’s so important that It can’t be done after my beauty sleep?” She snapped.
“Honestly, don’t you know already?” she smirked, as Potter laughed nervously under the death glares of his two best friends.
“Y-yeah?”
Draco was feeling quite proud of denying Potter’s wish when he felt something rough grab him from behind and gasped. The boy used the opportunity to shove his tongue forcefully into Draco’s mouth.
He could hear the loud breathing from the other person.
At the same time, Draco Malfoy also finds himself laying on his bed, peeling open an envelope that was poorly written, with the words:
“You were the one who bumped into Harry here, Malfoy.” Ron glared.
“It's us Potter, Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy, it’d never work out!” Draco gave a frustrated stomp.
“Not without giving me a response Malfoy.”
“Don’t tell me you’re going to fly around the room to clean it up!” He laughed.
But deep down, Draco knew that if it all happened again, he’d still choose to trust the Golden Boy, he just liked him too much to not trust him.
“The most important section of the wizarding—” Harry shut her words out before he could even register the meaning, right now in Harry’s mind, nothing is more important than figuring out this business with Malfoy. Because deep inside harry knows that if he doesn’t get this sorted out soon enough, the Dark Lord will use it to his advantage, and he knows for a fact that Lucius will soon break out of Azkaban and all the death eaters will know about his feelings for Malfoy.
“I-I do hate him,” Potter said, Granger narrowed her eyes, “But Hermione why are you standing up for him?”
Harry’s heart sped up at the thought of having to face the git in battle. Would he be able to point his wand at him again? As an enemy?
“How could you say that Harry! HE bullied us and made fun of us for years!” Ron exclaimed; eyes were blown wide at his friends’ reaction.
“I’ll…being going now,” Draco muttered after the silence turned too awkward to handle. Duh, who sits there doing nothing after confession with the person that you confessed to for half an hour? Waiting for their response? Merlin NO! Draco does not want his heart crushed hours before his grand escape.
“Because I saw Potter leaving the Castle half an hour after.” She smirked.
After a few moments of blinking her eyes and adjusting to the light, she realised that she’d fallen asleep while writing her potions report. She’s currently sprawled across the table in the Slytherin common room.
Draco scowled, it wasn’t his fault that some bloody-pain-in-the-ass decides to prank him at such holy timing if anything was to blame, it was Potter and his darn binding spell.
Probably everything between us other than the mutual hatred. Draco grimaced as the voice nagged him inside his mind.
He saw red. It swam in his vision. Nothing else but red. Red?
He watched as Malfoy sat there, mouth open in horror as his hand forcefully grabbed the pint and chugged it down.
He turned his attention back to the brunette a few steps away from him and saw that Potter was walking towards him.
As observant as always.
Draco was so scared. He doesn’t want to hear what Potter has to say next, because it is surely words of rejection and disgust. He could hear his heartbreak. He just doesn’t want to shatter it.
Sadly, there seemed to be some masochists in the group because Theo Nott didn’t stop right there.
With the pain interrupting his senses, he could only stand there and watch as the ropes soared towards him and clung onto his body.
Potter, the golden boy wouldn’t do such things, right?”
“How do you know he’s not playing with you?”
“I can’t take back the words of truth,” Harry replied calmly, knowing that it’d disturb Malfoy the most when he stays in control.
Draco isn’t glass. Many might think he was raised as a brat, got everything he wanted, praised for tiny things, but it wasn’t like that in the Manor. Although he had house-elves and servants to do all the chores and others, he never got praise from Lucius; or any hugs from Narcissa (she was told to show no affection, though she sometimes still did); and if he did something that his father wasn’t satisfied with, he would get punishments. Overall, it was a cold place with no love.
Except it wasn’t.
“And?” Ron pressed.
So, they just sat there, in silence, for who knows how long.
Again, but this time only the tip of his ears gained colour.
“I would’ve thought Slytherins were stronger than that.” Granger frowned, clearly mocking Pansy, but also concerned from her tone.
Who would barge into a small apartment? Unless the rumours about a nearby thief were true and he just happened to be so unlucky?
“The git deserved it! Why are you speaking up for him anyway? Did he kiss you?” Ron roared back.
“PoTtAh!” Harry’s ears perked up at the voice, his whole body warmed up, and there was nothing else in his mind then the snarky face of a blond Slytherin.
The rest of the year flew by in a blur.
There probably will be a sequel to this, hope you've enjoyed the story so far. I know it's a bad habit to leave cliff hangers, but I just couldn't help myself ;)
“You two should be ashamed of yourselves! You shouldn’t be saying things like that behind anyone’s back. Harry you of all people should understand that!” She huffed, and Harry really felt the anger behind those words.
“My types…Malfoy said he preferred blokes my type.” The golden boy sighed, as soon as he said that a flood of relief washed over him, he finally got it out of his chest.
“Huh? Oh, sorry…” Draco frowned, and walked back to his seat with Harry behind him, “You just look like someone I know.”
No. It was more than that. Hot.
What an amazing week this has been.
Maybe when you confessed your damn feelings to him? Harry’s mind retorted back.
“Since the beginning?”
Harry felt a lump at his throat when he imagined the conversation, he and Hermione would have later in the night but brushed it away as it was Parkinson’s turn to choose.
“Ronald Bilius Weasley! If you don’t apologize for this instant, I swear you will never talk to me again!” Hermione gave her last warning.
Now? There’s nothing left for him to break. Potter broke his heart, so Draco will break their chances of winning the war.
The first thing she saw was a pointy face in her face. Now that scared her.
“Well?” A very interested Terry Boot asked.
“It’s the boy’s dormitories!”
Malfoy gave him a polite nod before heading off to the dungeons, from the way his footsteps bounced a little, Harry knows that even though Malfoy wouldn’t admit it, but he was probably the happiest throughout the whole conversation.
Harry knew exactly who ‘D.M’ was.
But Hermione ignored their protest and walked towards Harry’s direction. He breathed a sigh of relief as he had not gotten to the changing part yet.
“Ew! Who in their right mind would want to kiss that ferret!” Draco peered around the corner and saw Weasley sticking his tongue out, “They must have been forced or something!”
He could feel himself being turned on. Furthermore, Potter’s existence didn’t help either.
In his mind, the latter seemed more appropriate.
“Wow, it doesn’t really sound like you hate him at all…” Harry began.
“I-“Draco paused, he actually doesn’t. What if Potter doesn’t like him, but just wants to mess with his feelings? What if he was going to spread rumours and then dump him?
But Draco Malfoy, the boy who had no ways of showing affection for someone, since his parents never showed him any, could only think of one way to hide his crush towards the Chosen one. Hatred.
Harry’s desperate, he doesn’t want to lose any of his friends. Or Malfoy. But what can he do? He likes Malfoy, Hermione might get over it one day, but Ron? It’d be a luxury to ask of him not to hex Malfoy’s bollocks off.
After a while, the dreams and hallucinations have gone barbaric, but in the end, they were still dreams, dreams that could never come true.
But as quick as possible Draco remembered why he’d been in the broom shed in the first place.
Harry watched as Draco turned to him, looked at him with those stormy grey eyes, the hurt that it leaked, soon masked by his Malfoy pride.
“I-I’m not! I’m just saying that if we blackmail him, we’d be doing the same thing he’s doing, which makes us just as bad as him.” He tried to reason with the redhead.
All his friends and people he doesn’t know greeted him with the utmost respect but soon froze as Harry announced his intentions.
Draco’s head shot up to the direction of the voice.
“Hmm? How do you know that?” Draco eyed him, with a glint Harry didn’t understand.
Even after a whole year, Potter was still able to mix up his thoughts.
“Malfoy!”
And so, when he realised, he was about to confess to Harry freaking Potter, a second time, not drunk, it was a bit of a challenge. Then again, Malfoys never back down from a challenge.
“Fine! Have it your way then!”
Why not?
“Huh? I didn’t do anything?” Seeing Potter was just as puzzled as he was, Draco’s rage all leaked out, as he slumped onto the floor.
Harry looked up from the floor, utterly confused. Hermione can’t expect everyone to be like her and understand everything, perfectly right?
“So, who is this Potter?” Harry asked, curious of why Malfoy would be thinking of him, other than how to hex him to vomit slugs for eternity.
“You are such a- “
Pansy groaned, here he goes again, about how Potter hates him and all that. Draco might be blind, oh but Pansy Parkinson sure isn’t. She’s seen the way Potter looks at Draco, matches Draco’s glances exactly. The only reason that Pansy hasn’t exposed them yet is that Draco is too self-conscious too tell anyone, and for Dray’s sake, she’s kept it to herself and Blaise.
“Of course…” Harry said, a little too soft.
He’d known from the beginning that getting Malfoy to open up to him was hard, but the past two days had just proved it almost impossible.
Since Draco’s table was facing the door, he could see everyone that walks in. And maybe it was just a coincidence, but he swore he just saw Potter enter the bar.
Draco screamed in his head.
But this one, it was heated and needy.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about, Nott.” Malfoy pulled on his façade and said coolly. Or as cool as he could be, blushing a vivid shade of red.
“Oh, of course, I don’t, ask Pansy or Blaise, they know best!” Draco exclaimed, somewhat annoyed at the person’s constant questions.
“Oi! That was my line!”
“That Malfoy has kissed a Gryffindor before! This is brilliant blackmail material, guys!” He yelped.
“What do you suggest I do then?” Granger cast a sideward glance.
“You said you weren’t Harry Potter!”
“So, who was it Draco?” Theo Nott added smugly.
Soon, Professor Flitwick was here to try some spells on the ropes, but they just don’t seem to work, in the end, they had to fetch Professor McGonagall too, and she was hella angry at us.
As soon as the words left Harry’s mouth, he regretted it as Malfoy flinched violently and took a few steps back.
“Why didn’t you go with him?”
Thinking about it…the reason he followed Draco around in the first place was that Harry thought that he bore the dark mark and was a spy for the death eaters.
That git must have told Parkinson about their night in the ROR, Parkinson couldn’t have known about it any other way.
That blew Draco off his feet. He’d been so used to hearing ‘Malfoy this’ and ‘Malfoy that’ from Potter, he’d never wondered what his given name would sound like from Potter’s mouth.
Draco peered a little closer to the man in front of him, he somewhat looks like Potter…wait…no way….
Draco yawned, he hadn’t been getting much sleep lately, and the culprit is right next to him.
As soon as Draco left, his footsteps faded, Pansy and Blaise huddled together and talked in hushed whispers.
He’ll just have to pay the price of facing McGonagall’s wrath for not finishing homework on time, not a big deal compared to what he’d heard last night.
“Harry! Big news!” She grinned, “Tonight I managed to get Professor McGonagall’s permission to host an inter-house party in the Room of Requirement! Most people from all the houses are coming, I already have the food and drinks planned, I only need you guys to help with the decorations.” She took a deep breath.
“Malfoy?”
Inside Harry’s grateful for Hermione’s understanding. But right now, he has bigger things to deal with.
“So…that’s it?” Pansy raised an eyebrow.
They were both concentrated on each other, determined not to let the other win, Draco flung another spell at Potter, and used the few seconds of advantage to catch a glimpse at the clock. From Draco’s speedy calculations, he figured that they’ve been at each other’s throats for nearly an hour now, no wonder why Draco was running out of hexes even though he had a whole gallery of them in his brain.
Draco only cuddled up to him more, the voice inside warning him that this will be his last chance.
Draco had planned right ahead, whatever Potter says, he’d not give in and forgive him. That jerk had been playing with him, tossing his feelings around like it was nothing, it was bright red humiliation. However, it wasn’t only once that Draco had thought that Potter was just lying to his friends but soon shook off the thought because if Potter couldn’t choose him over his friends, he wouldn’t love a lowly death eater anyways.
He shuffled nearer to the warmth named Harry Potter.
“Well, he hates me, that’s for certain, although I couldn’t necessarily say that I hate him…” he trailed off.
“Don’t get ahead of yourself Potter, it wasn’t because of you, it was a weird spell that had hit me and entangled with the binding spell. Didn’t I tell you that just then? DO you Gryffindors every listen?”
“So, what did you want to know?” Draco asked, acting dumb. Not a Malfoy thing, but who cares anymore if he was going to disappear from the wizarding world anyway? They’d probably think he's dead than hiding in the muggle world since Draco was sure he’d shown enough of his distaste towards muggles throughout these past years.
“Malfoy…?” He heard Ron mutter to himself, with Ron’s brain he might h=not have noticed but he practically spoke out everyone’s question.
Oh no he wasn’t worried about that. He was worried about him and Malfoy’s relationship. If you could even call it one.
Everything was fine, he could go back to living a normal life.
Draco didn’t know how to feel.
There was only silence.
He swore he heard his heart crack a little.
I want you.
“A test?”
But there was nothing Draco could do when he watched Potter nod in agreement. He is going to make whoever did this pay, most of all, Potter, for being an attractive idiot.
Harry thought that well Malfoy had confessed his crush, why not take the chance, and go for it? What could be a loss?
Gosh, I’m falling for him! Draco shook his head, I can’t do that, father and mother would never approve, besides, he wouldn’t ever love a death eater scum like me…
Draco gave a longing sigh at the movement.
Harry didn’t know what to do, he wanted to help, but what if he hurt Draco again? So, he could only stand there and stare like an idiot as Professor Snape strides out of the room, leaving him with a last glance, saying something like: You’ve done enough.
“What happened between you and Potter?” How clever of her.
Hang on, isn’t the question here “What are you talking about?”
“Must you make this so hard?”
“It’s going to be a long week.”
By the time Professor McGonagall came back, Potter had already cleaned the whole classroom by himself and they were waiting by one of the tables.
When he was going to use plan Z, a place popped into his head. What about the Room of Requirement? Malfoy should know about it since he and Umbridge did catch them in fifth year…With that thought in mind, Harry sprinted towards the seventh floor.
The door creaked a little as Harry pushed and walked through the ‘wall’. The first thing that Harry could make out was a violent flash of white and before his brain could sense the danger coming, his hand was already with his wand in front of him as his lungs yelled ‘Protegro’.
Nope.
The apartment was nothing compared to the Manor, but despite it’s broken looks on the outside, Draco had managed to keep everything nice and tidy on the inside, so that it actually looks like a home instead of a rubbish dump like it was when Draco first rented the place.
“Uh, you literally just confessed Malfo- “Harry stopped himself.
He was the enemy of the love of his life. Or maybe he always was, just that these two week’s interactions had given a sparkle of hope—that surely wouldn’t last long.
Pansy sighed, Draco had already darted around the corner and out of sight.
Harry wanted to dash to the body and perform all the healing spells he knows, everything just to make sure that Draco is alright.
“With what?”
As the sun rose up, the birds happy singing woke up Harry.
Draco’s mask wavered, he gave them a tight smile, “Thank you, I’ll be heading to bed now, we have double DADA tomorrow.”
From the corner of his eye, he saw Hermione nod.
Potter had cast a binding spell his way.
“You agree with me, right?” Weasley growled, “That git doesn’t deserve to kiss any Gryffindor, they probably just wanted to mess with him.”
“I- “
“Yes, you have. I know you overheard the…conversation… we had back then.” Potter turned his head to stare at Draco in the eye. Those emerald eyes worth dying in. “ I want to apologise for saying all those trash about you. I was just worried at how they’d react if they found out of was head over heels for Malfoy.” He chuckled again.
“Harry! Where the bloody hell have you been!” Harry was confronted by the mother tiger of the school, Hermione Granger.
Draco turned around and shifted under the blazing gaze of none other than Harry Potter. The heat radiating off it is kind of disturbing, as he’s never had much skin on skin contact with anyone. Not even his parents.
The hand-stretched in front of him reminded Draco that Potter was still standing in front of him with a worried expression, and he was still in class with everyone watching. Snape’s class, he reminded, which only annoyed him more since it was his bloody godfather’s fault he even got into this in the first place: Tied up on the floor in front of everyone, with the saviour of the wizarding world reaching out to him and with an incredibly hard boner.
Potter went silent after Draco’s explanation, he looks as if he was concerned for Draco’s health, which Draco doubted.
Almost.
“There’s nothing to talk about.”
“Did you really mean that confession, last night, at the bar?” Now that shattered all confidence that might have been gained in the past few seconds.
Weird animal noises that Draco did not want to know what creature they came from were the only things that could be heard through the cold silence. He regretted coming as soon as he set foot on the grounds. The broom shed is annoyingly near the forbidden forest, and trust him, Draco did not have many good memories there after first year.
“It’s not about that, I’m not that narrow-minded.” Draco puffed.
“Uh...I was…wasted?”  Harry itched the back of his neck.
“You’re such a prick Malfoy, no wonder you’ve never dated anyone, I doubt you’ve ever even kissed a girl!” Harry snorted, ready for the smart retort.
Meet me at the broom shed near the quidditch pitch at midnight.
He didn’t know why Potter had said those things if he wasn’t only messing with him, but the thought that Potter can’t even
“I’ve got homework, bye.”
Phew.
Ron and Dean yelled, trying to cover themselves, as they were just changing when she charged in.
His calloused hands had somehow found their way to Malfoy’s waist while still kissing him lightly. He subconsciously squeezed his hand a little, and Malfoy squeaked, like literally squeaked.
Finding Malfoy.
“It’s been an hour already; don’t you think Professor McGonagall would be back soon?” Draco snapped.
At that, Draco let out a pained laugh, life is never fair.
Hold on….
Potter seemed confused, “What I want? You told me to meet here! You mean what do you want?”
He’s never told anyone this, but Draco is actually afraid of the dark, maybe it was from staying in the manor for too long, the emptiness and pitiful darkness always got to him.
That’s right, what can he give to Potter that would make him worthy of the Chosen One?
Yes, it was hotter than anything, his body was on fire and his mind was running at 20 miles per minute. He tried to think, who did this and how could he possibly get out of this situation unharmed. But the more he thought, the more blood rushed to the south.
Draco sneered his best sneer while his face still being beet red, and plopped himself back on the table.
Did he just say, boyfriend???????????
However, his dreams were disrupted when he realized the call came from Mad-Eye-Moody.
Swallowed by what just happened to be Harry’s lips.
Reliving all the deaths of his dearest friends and family, Harry just couldn’t bear it anymore.
“Looks like we’ve been set up, again.” He sighed.
According to Draco himself: “S-since third year…” he mumbled, a slight blush tinting his cheeks.
Unfortunately for Draco, they just happen to bump into The Golden Trio halfway through the corridor.
“Don’t you know that it’s rude to play with other’s feelings?”
And now Harry’s just standing there holding Malfoy’s arm, like some brain-washed maniac to confess to Draco freaking Malfoy.
Harry could see Malfoy’s hesitation at this point, the pain of being thrown into a wall clearly didn’t help much in keeping his Malfoy mask up, because harry could hear the gears in his head-turning. There were a few minutes of utter silence, and Harry could see Malfoy’s shoulders tense up, meaning he’s come to a decision.
And he was just a lowly death eater, running from his crimes and decisions. Draco would never be worthy of the Great Harry Potter, not that Potter would remember him anyways, Draco thought bitterly.
“Malfoy, this isn’t about your father, it’s about you.”
Potter just stared him puzzled. Sometimes he just wants to slap this idiot, how can someone be so dense?
“We have to be prepared for every class!”  She’d said.
“I said it’s none of your business!” Malfoy stood up, leering at Millicent. Perhaps Millicent just had very slow reaction time because she finally shut up and looked to the ground. Malfoy stood there, panting from anger, and shifted his gaze around the circle. Glowering at everyone who even dared to have an interesting look in their eyes.
“Sorry,” Hermione told the librarian, even though they’ve made no sounds at all.
How would the whole school think of this?
Harry bid his goodbyes when the laughter died down, everyone was partying, so it was rather easy to find everyone.
And so, he ran.
Staring at the sunlight streaming through the half-opened wooden door, he gave a long sigh.
How didn’t he notice that before?
Back to topic, Potter would never love him. He was a Slytherin, a Malfoy, who were the enemies of the Weasley family for who knows how long. He had bullied them and made fun of Potter and his friends for years, even if he was only trying to get his attention. Potter would never forgive him. They had no chance together; the world would only break them apart.
He walked along the corridor in a trance-like state, still in shock of what he’d done.
They nodded to each other and soon told Draco good night.
Everything seemed to be in slow motion, Draco slowly pulled out his wand and yelled a spell. Out of sheer instinct, Harry dodged it as it hit the wall behind him.
How long had it been since the last time he was given such an intimate gesture?
“Well, since you fancy me, and I like you…maybe we could start d-dating?” Harry stuttered.
But as soon as that happened, he felt tears rising from within. He just couldn’t keep it in. The first time he’s ever confessed to anyone, or any Potters, and he was played with.
In the end, they took the long way to their next class, Professor McGonagall didn’t seem happy about it, but that was the last thing on his mind.
“Harry James Potter, you are going to tell us everything.” The bushy-haired girl growled.
I promise I won't keep you guys waiting for too long!
“What about Ron?”
“Oof, uh haha, that’s me Malfoy…Good to see you too?” Harry chuckled nervously.
But as soon as Draco’s hand touched the door, a spark of electricity shocked him, and he quickly sprang back.
Maybe in that sense, he was kind of similar to Harry Potter. He was the boy who lived, destined to save the world. Ever since infancy, he was weighed down on the responsibility to defeat the evilest wizard of the century, only because his mother had sacrificed herself for him.
“Well…probably, since I didn’t erase his memories…” Draco flinched, ouch.
No one hurts their dragon and gets away with it.
“What?” Draco cocked his head towards the man who calls himself Harold, “I’ve never told you my name! Also, I don’t love you!” He exclaimed.
He slowly pulled away, leaving Malfoy stunned in silence, slightly trembling, with Harry’s hand still on his waist.
“And I have the perfect plan.”
“He told me that he was…uh…bi?”
“Bloody hell, I knew that’s why he always looked at people differently, I wonder what the Prophet would think about this…What do you think mate?”
“Why do you keep picking fights with me Malfoy? Can’t we just ignore each other completely?” Harry reasoned, he is really getting tired of these fights, especially when Malfoy seems a lot more attractive this year.
He had stopped with his mission ever since that drunk night with Potter, he was afraid that he would damage this fragile relationship if Potter ever found out that he’d been marked.
“Yes, Professor.” They chorused.
“Don’t say his name!” He hissed.
“Oi! Hermione? You’re not supposed to be in here!”
Harry knows that Narcissa was still under the death eater’s control, and with his experience with family, he knew that Malfoy couldn’t leave her to be tormented by the Dark Lord.
Wet lips on his.
“Tell her Harry, tell her how Malfoy is a disgusting worm.” Weasley seethed. To Draco he looked like a complete idiot that doesn’t know where his own brain lies.
Blaise had already seen enough and knows that tonight would be a long night indeed, so he keeps on walking, under the raised eyebrow of a very suspicious Hermione.
No words could describe how much Harry’s heart ached at that moment. How he longed to wrap the crying boy into his arms and comfort him with a gentle kiss on the head. Although he knew that the stubborn blonde would never let him make him feel so vulnerable.
This was something he did not expect. And it seemed like neither did the rest of Gryffindor.
“I-uh, was in the astronomy tower, checking out the stars?” Harry muttered.
That voice that had haunted him for years, turning him into a wreaking mess, and the image of who it belonged to sprang into Draco’s head.
But Hermione ignored him, instead, she kept glaring at Harry, maybe because he hadn’t finished his transfiguration essay and it was due today?
Harry carefully untied the parchment from the owl’s leg, as watched for a moment as it again flew out of the window into the air, before focusing back on the actual letter.
Harry rubbed at his eyes, fondled around on the ground, looking for his glasses, and when he found them, he saw an empty broom shed, with no blondie insight.
They were in the ROR, decorations hung on every wall, candles blazed with light, soft music rang through the room, creating a peaceful feeling. The delicious scent of treacle tarts drifted into Harry’s nose, and it would make his mouth water, if not for the twenty or so students sitting around Malfoy, waiting for an explanation.
As a result of his very short holidays, he was soon back in the castle with a very frustrated Snape and annoyed McGonagall.
“What have I done…” Harry shook uncontrollably as he watched the blood seep out of the white shirt.
Normally Draco would analysis the scene and their facial expressions, but this time he was too emotional to think properly, let alone understanding why Potter had said that.
It was just so unfair. And stupid of him to believe what Potter said.
“Well same here, it was on top of the drawer when I got back.” Draco huffed. Unbelievable, another trick?
The tone of his voice was so soothing Draco almost wanted to believe him. Almost.
“But- “
The heat engulfed him whole, it lit all his senses up. Potter slowly traced his bottom lip with his tongue, asking for access. It was his second kiss damn it, of course, Draco wasn’t prepared for the French kissing! Thinking about it, Potter probably had a lot of practice from the Chang girl and Weaslette. It only made him more frustrated, and he sealed his lip, ignoring the wet licks on his lips.
The kiss they had last night was soft and gentle, and mostly because Draco hadn’t really paid attention to it since he was still in shock of Potter stealing his first kiss.
Currently, the Golden trio is waiting in the DADA classroom, early of course, due to the insisting of Hermione.
“No, stay away- “Too late, Potter was already a foot away from him.
What did he have to tell me that couldn’t be told in public?
Very interesting detention. He reminded himself.
But on the other hand, if he reached for it, everyone would know that he’d dated a Slytherin, no doubt they’d try to pry open the secret information, and when they know that he and Draco Malfoy are dating, the whole Hogwarts would know in less than 24 hours. He wouldn’t mind everyone knowing, of course, that is, in peaceful times. With Voldemort at large? Not really.
Probably will.
“Oh that, uh yes.” Granger managed a small smile, “Yes I have.”
“AHHH- “She yelped, jumping from the chair and three feet into the air.
Deep in his thoughts, Draco didn’t notice the knocking at the door, until a loud ‘boom’ rang through the room, meaning that someone had broken in.
“Ew! Who in their right mind would want to kiss that ferret!” Ron stuck out his tongue, “They must have been forced or something!”
“-you alright?” Harry only caught the last few words of the sentence that Hermione was saying. Only then did he realise that he was deep in thought, about Malfoy.
“Even if it’s Malfoy, we can’t do that.”
Draco Malfoy…. The Slytherin Prince…. That GIT!
“Well…if Malfoy really did prefer blokes, I doubt that’d be much news among the student,” Hermione concluded, and Harry was thankful that she didn’t press the subject, “Most pure-bloods don’t care about the preferences of their family, all they want is an heir to pass on their blood and fortune, after that no one really cares who they elope with.”
“That whoever kissed Malfoy must be either imperious-ed or out of their mind!” Ron seemed to want to carve this as a fact into everyone’s mind.
Lucius was caught and sent to Azkaban again, obviously, since he’d been too much of the inner circle of the dark side; however, Draco’s mother, Narcissa, redeemed the Black family name and had enough to support herself in France.
None of them would gather the courage to break the silence, so they sat there, second after second, minute after minute, maybe even hours.
The broken windows let in the dimmed lighting from the setting sun, if he ignored the broken furniture in the room and the fact that it’s Malfoy that he was talking to, Harry could almost imagine this as a romantic scene.
They were both living with muggles, not using magic unless in urgent emergencies. This way, the other wizards would think they’re dead because they can’t detect their magic signals. Or rather, Draco didn’t even have his wand. After Potter snatched it in the battle of the Manor, he’d never seen it again.
Draco could only stand and watch as Potter stepped into the kitchen and froze when he saw the blonde standing in the middle of the room.
“I think I like you too.” That voice echoed inside the Icy Prince’s mind, or rather, The-Ice-Hearted-Prince-that-had-Melted.
By the time she finished her sentence, Harry was already as pale as a brand-new parchment.
“I- “
Getting Draco to talk to Potter again.
Cya :D
“Nothing, just go away.”
“I’m sorry Potter, but your existence, in general, is a rotten smell in the air that’d never fade.” Draco taunts back, although he meant the exact opposite in his heart.
“No Malfoy- “
Draco froze.
“Mate, I know you hate Malfoy, just tell Hermione how wrong she is! That prick will always be a pain in the ass!”
“Screech!”
The disbelief of everyone overwhelmed with emotions, however, the movements on his arms and legs never moving. Shooting spells like they were his second nature (On second thought, It is his second nature).
All throughout transfiguration, all that was on his mind was Malfoy, Malfoy, MALFOY!!!!
Taking one last glance at Malfoy, Harry reluctantly stood from his seat and strode towards the stage. He only turned around when he was right in the middle, standing as though he was ready for a fight, which was true, and watched as Malfoy walked towards him, never breaking eye contact.
This year has sure been eventful.
“Potter?!” Draco jumped from his seat.
“What’s wrong?” Potter asked from behind.
Never trust a piece of jewellery to not be enchanted and stabs you in the back or rip you to sheds.
Everything would be way easier if you’d just died the first time!” The Slytherin sneered, but his posture seemed to relax just a tiny bit.
“Of course. You see, while you had your argument with Weasley and Potter, Draco, my dear, just so happened to pass by that corridor.” Pansy grimaced, “As you can probably guess, he heard everything. He’s been in a horrible mood lately, refuses to eat or go to the classes with Gryffindors.”
How could he mess with his feelings?
But perhaps, just for tonight, he could forget about all that, and bathe in his lover’s glory. He won’t be able to do this ever again if the Dark Lord’s mission goes according to plan.
Although they didn’t use it anymore, Draco still missed it from time to time. It was his utmost important possession.
“Draco Malfoy! Where the hell were you?” A furious Pansy demanded.
Maybe it was his Gryffindor traits that had gotten him in Gryffindor rather than Slytherin, his rush of emotions that always results in a near-death experience, but the words just rolled off his tongue before he could even think about taking them back. Not that he intended to take anything back.
“Stop acting like some three-year-old you two, Draco has news for us, just sit down and listen, love.” The last part was directed towards Pansy.
Later that day, he finally caught a glimpse of Draco, desperate, in the middle of the Great Hall, staring at Harry with hundreds of emotions mixed together.
“I haven’t. It’s just your broad imagination.” Draco sneered.
Since Draco wouldn’t shut up about Harry Potter since third year, they already knew the Golden Trio’s time table by heart, they also knew that Potter, Granger and Weasley will be either heading towards the Great Hall or already at the Great Hall by the time they get there.
The bell sounded, echoing through the library, as Jackie had just begun to drill Jill about everything she knew. Jill, being the kind of person that she was, replied as vaguely as anyone could possibly manage without invoking Jackie's wrath.
"Did you even read any of the notes that Draco and I wrote?" Harry whispered back. "There was that guy, what's his name –"
"We have Alarm Charms stationed along the street," Remus had told him, because of course they would.
. When it came down to it, though, he was as petrified as Draco.
Not much like the Malfoy that Harry had met in Potions the previous week either, or in those since. Malfoy was strange when they were studying in one another's company; Harry didn't think there were the thick, thrumming undertones of hatred that there had once been, but at the same time, the quiet, reserved, almost sadly aloof Malfoy that seemed to have taken his place every other moment of the day took a momentary break, too. Just as strangely, Harry found it somehow relieving; if nothing else, that Malfoy still found himself capable of sharp retorts to Harry, if only to Harry, was reassurance that not everything in his world had changed.
Harry thought, sharing a sidelong glance with Draco. Draco's expression didn't twitch, but his hand gave Harry's a brief squeeze. "We're good," Harry said. "Did you have something in mind?"
Cursing again, Draco scrubbed a hand over his face. Agitation gnawed at him, and it was all he could do not to step backwards, to stride in any aimless direction in a desperate attempt to duck away from a confrontation he'd hoped never to have. Why did feelings have to be admitted? Why – no,
Dropping out of school was a whirlwind of stupefying change, but more to Harry's friends than to Harry himself. "I'll visit as much as I can," Harry had promised, but it hadn't stopped Jill eventually dissolving into tears or Jackie ranting for what felt like hours about abandonment and betrayal.
Pansy pouted. "You could have told me you were corresponding with Muggles," she said.
Harry listened more than he spoke. Even as weariness weighed upon his shoulders, the company of his friends was doing him wonders. Nothing was fixed yet, and everything hadn't returned to normal, but it gave him hope that it might get there. Maybe.
"Yeah. Probably because it was. Nothing outstanding."
Rolling his eyes again, Harry squeezed Draco's captured fingers. "I've already told you, what I do isn't real magic."
It was a little weird, but maybe that was just the boarding school mindset. With the memory of his brief meeting with the prefects that morning, of their stilted manner, Harry suspected he might be drawing that same on a number of occasions in the future. For better or worse was yet to be seen.
"- everything. It bloody well sucks that it almost doesn't feel right to use it anymore. Like I've used up my quota sometimes by using it in bad ways, or…"
Jackie shrugged, not even bothering to deny it – until she abruptly jerked to a stop in step. Her smile faded into a frown as she stared ahead down the corridor, opened her mouth, closed it again, then asked, "Just what the bloody hell are they doing?"
A magical boyfriend who was absolutely, one-hundred percent real and looking to stay that way.
"Nothing's going to happen," Lily had said. From the set of her jaw, the little nod of her head, it seemed more for her own benefit than Harry's. "Nothing will happen to you, Harry."
Harry's laugh was cut short when Draco captured his lips once more, and any urge to withdraw, to duck away from him and cast a glance over his shoulder just in case, was lost to the glorious softness of his kiss, the taste of his breath and its shivering warmth as he drew away slightly before dropping another kiss.
"See, when you say it like that I feel like you're joking."
"I thought Hogwarts would be a way to get better," Draco murmured. "A way to show I could change – I would change – and that I'd already started to. I know I can't apologise for what I've done, and a part of me still thinks I shouldn't have to. I think… that what I was really trying to do was to survive, just like everyone else, so I don't know how…"
"- but you need to get over yourselves, because this is the topic for our assignment and we're sticking with it. I've already taken notes, and I'm not starting all over again just because you say so." Harry had never been more adamant about his initially reluctant decision than he was now. He was sure he'd cling to it if he had to complete the assignment himself – which was looking increasingly likely. "Get over your superstitious nonsense and pull that fucking stick out of your arse, because whatever problem you have isn't mine. So shut the hell up."
Turning from waving the driver off, Pansy shot him a dubious glance. "What, you wouldn't have come if you'd know beforehand?"
Warm. Soft. Comfortable, yet not without its tingle of something else. Something other. Something that touches and comfort didn't always entail, and something that Harry didn't feel anymore in a hug from Ginny, or in Ron's butted shoulder and Hermione's affectionate pats as she left him in to common room to retire to bed for the night. It was something that had flickered to life only slowly, evolving and growing bigger and brighter entirely unnoticed until Harry regarded it in just the right lighting.
Harry shrugged. It was cold, true, but a different kind to that he'd felt in his bed. This sort felt better. "Whatever."
"And a little sad, too," Melpomene said, the quietest of all of them
Where magic left him, Harry didn't know.
Draco blinked back from his distraction. "Taken what?" he asked, absently flicking the stack of pictures in his hands.
"Fuck off, Jacob," Harry said. "Do you really have to be told when you're not wanted around here?"
"Sixty?" Draco drew his gaze towards the pile of resumes again. "And yet nothing?"
To his credit, Draco appeared to understand his feelings without being told. Squeezing his hand, his pompousness deflating like a balloon released, he tipped his head directionally. "Come on. I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat."
"Is that so?"
"Or not. As it happens, I don't remember anything about the night I, uh, lost my parents. Or anything from before that, for that matter."
Harry had always hated the feeling of Apparition from the very moment Draco had first pulled him into it. But in that moment, the suffocating weight of it was the most wondrous feeling in the world.
Another shrug.
"It enables communication by conjuring the image seen through the mirror's counterpart," Draco explained when Harry had unwrapped it. "It will be useful, I think, for communicating, especially given that I don't use one of those Muggle, ah… what are they called? The things you talk into?"
"So not educational?" Draco asked, sarcasm resurfacing.
"Oh really? What do you call free tickets every season, then?"
Shivering slightly, Harry tucked his arms a little more tightly around himself. His chill had nothing to do with his blankets, magically warmed to stave off the iciness of winter's fingers that seeped through the dormitory's windows. Rather, it was the bed itself. It was his own arms, wrapped through one another, that seemed so insufficient. It was that the bed, once so gloriously his own, felt far too big for just himself.
"What happened here?" James finally asked, intruding upon Lily silent chanting.
"A word to you or to anyone else?"
open.
Unexpectedly, Draco's smile froze. His cheeks were still flushed, his eyes a little glassy, and Harry was all too aware of the tension thrumming through him, of his arousal and the heat within his gut that seemed to throb and grow with each given moment. All too aware of the weight and feel of Draco inside him, the hotness, the tightness that wasn't painful anymore. Yet Draco's smile faded with an unexpected calmness, and when he raised one of Harry's hands to his lips, kissing his knuckles, there was a gentleness in the touch that jarringly contrasted his usual abrasive turn-a-phrase. He lowered their hands back to his chest just as gently before refastening his hold upon Harry's legs.
Pansy didn't argue. She didn't need to. They both knew that she wasn't the one being helped. Not really.
Just as he did then.
"What?"
"Remind me again why you're not my manager?" Harry asked, dodging a crewman himself as they passed into the even narrower hallway leading towards the back rooms.
"Yeah, I know, but I was –"
Draco, in the process of placing his chair down alongside Harry's, paused. "Excuse me?"
"I suppose this is a thing now," a voice said from behind Draco.
"I don't –"
"Mm?"
"You try so hard not to be noticed, and it's so not like you."
"What the fuck?" she whispered. "That's not… that's not a trick?"
"You know," Ginny said, "even though I'm beautiful all made-up and glamorous, I'm so glad it's you and not me, Harry."
"Misogynist," Hermione muttered, and Harry wondered just how much of the conversation she was actually keeping up with.
"Well enough," Draco replied. "The connections were efficient."
"I knew it," he said, a teasing edge to his words. "You always were a wily one, Malfoy."
“And you think that if I...” Minerva trailed off, her eyes drawn back to the cheerfully crackling fire.
“You looking for Harry, mate?” George calls down the table. “He’s in the library. Work call.”
“Theo Nott, a Slytherin in our year. His father was a Death Eater, did some horrible things. A few of them on my family’s dining room table.” Draco’s eyes drifted a few inches above Harry’s head. “Why didn’t you try to save him?”
“Allow me to introduce myself,” Draco held out a hand, Potter half reached for it before realising that Draco was joking and scowling at him, “My name is Draco Lucius Malfoy,” Draco persisted. “I am not, nor have I ever been, called Liam.”
“What is happening?” Draco demanded, fighting to keep the hysteria out of his voice.
Draco’s role as the new Slytherin Seeker had been earned well before the brooms appeared, but he continued to feel a sliver on unease whenever he looked at his new, unGlamoured, Nimbus. He avoided Blaise, feigning a headache when they were partnered in Potions and closing the curtains around his bed earlier than usual. It wasn’t that Draco felt guilty, he’d acted in the true spirit of Slytherin, afterall. Still, he never did get around to asking his mother for permission to holiday with the Zabinis. After a few weeks, Blaised asked Theo instead and Draco spent the summer miserably listening to his father rant about how the Potter boy had “stolen” their last reliable house elf.
“Look it doesn’t have to be with me,” said Harry. “Just promise that you’ll make yourself a sandwich when you get home or at least-”
“Really?” said Draco. “And what about your date? What will he say when he arrives and realises that you have usurped Liam-”
“Very well,” sighing as if his own wand had offended him, Mr Snape performed the incantation, sending a stream of green light to wind itself around Harry’s temples.
“I beg your pardon?” Draco’s mouth went dry. “Houseguest? My parents, ah, my parents are not entertaining at the moment. Professor.” She couldn’t
Ron and Harry reluctantly trudged after him, examining the leaflets and novelty anal beads in their welcome bags. Ron’s beads were bright orange, Harry’s were carved to look like tiny golden snitches (Harry was relieved to note that the snitch wings were etched on, rather than sticking straight out). When they passed the tenth stand (by which point Harry’s guard had almost completely slipped) a giant - monstrous, really - dildo came pelting onto their path. Harry let out an undignified yelp, Ron flinched, first from fear and then, when he realized what the thing was, from sympathy for the genitals of its future user. Cormac guffawed.
Of course, Potter did most of these things as well, and people sometimes called him a hero. But Potter had no aspirations to claw his way into high society, and Draco told himself that made all the difference. But it was as if Potter’s words had unlocked a door in Draco’s mind. Everywhere he looked, lines were being drawn between people like himself and the rest of the world. Of course Draco was a fan of lines, especially those that kept men like Wormtail in their place. But these were new lines, lines between “normal” magical folk and those with creature blood.
“He does look like Malfoy, though.” Ron insisted. “Bet he would have hated knowing his mug portrait likes getting naked for the Chosen One.”
“Yes, yes.” Malfoy flopped his hand back-and-forth. “Auror, Shamuror, potato, potahto. The point, however, stands.” He fixed Harry with a beady eye.
“Professor I assure you I would never-” Umbridge reached up a hand and slowly pinched her fingers together. Draco’s mouth closed, his mind flooding with images of angry pink scars against brown skin.
“Selfishness?” Hermione raised the nearly empty bottle of wine she’d been sharing with Draco and gave him A Look.
"That... you're not making any sense." Greg cast a desperate glance towards Draco, clearly at a loss.
“Gin-nerv-ah Weasel.” Draco spelt out slowly, making a show of filling in the first line on the slip.
“Draco? Still with me?”
“Well I don’t know,” Potter ran a hand through his hair. “Did you even hear anything I said about Hermione? Or are you too busy thinking about
a bit late.” Madam Hooch stepped forward. “This bollocking will continue tomorrow
“Aren’t you Liam?” The waitress frowned. “The table’s reserved for Liam, I’ll have to make you a new reservation if you’re not him.” She was already reaching for her iPad and
“How’s it going with Malfoy?” Ron asked as he ripped open some crisps and nudged Harry’s pint towards him. “Go on, I’m ready.”
And speaking of fat, should Severus fall for Griselda’s ruse and treat himself to a mid-morning HobNob? This was what was occupying Severus’ mind when his gloved fingers brushed against a tiny prophecy, hardly bigger than a marble, and the room erupted into chaos.
“It’s rubbish, isn’t it? How anxious having kids makes you?”
Sensing a pause in Potter’s story, Draco scrambled to retrace the last few sentences. Something about Scorpius and Al both starting Hogwarts.
“Yes, yes.” Stepping further into the room, Mr Snape waved Harry forward. The room was surprisingly big; large windows stretched up to ceilings that must, surely, have an extension charm on them. Someone had charmed the view to match the view from Primrose Park at sunset—Harry recognised it from long walks with Hermione.
“Ohmgee! Croissants!” Cormac appeared at Harry’s elbow. “Can I have one?”
“I don’t.” Draco was smiling back at him now, a small soft thing, almost hidden by the shadows. “You just...” He sucked in a deep breath, making his voice high and squeaky as he said, “Oh, look at me, I’m Harry Potter, here to martyr my tongue and dignity on the altar of social niceties.”
A fourth otter.
“Daring doing, muscular men rescuing babies and kittens, what’s not to like?”
Harry had always thought that none of the however many days in his life he had still to experience would have the same horror potential as the days spent fighting the Dark Lord. And yet, it looked like The Worst Day of His Life Award was about to get a new winner. Worst of all: his friends were to blame for his misery. Ron Weasley (formerly known as his best friend, having been declassed to a mere friend right when they stepped through the entrance of the hall) and Cormac McLaggen (ex-best friend’s excitable boyfriend) were proving to be Voldemort’s strongest competition in bringing misery into Harry’s life. At least Voldemort had the decency to only fill his life with terror and pain, instead of with bone-crushing embarrassment that looked to be more Cormac’s forte.
Had Draco also been ready?
“What? Oh!” Hermione’s eyes darted over to Harry, scanning him for injuries. “How, um, how long has the Phoenix been in the oven?”
It’s a dragon. A beautiful, powerful, dragon.
“Boys and girls are not to be permitted within eight inches of each other.” Janice hissed.
“Draco’s right.” This time Hermione spoke. “Even if we do wait out the prophecy this year there will still be two more years of being hunted by the kidnappers.”
“Stop.” Hermione murmured, placing a hand on Ron’s knee.
“What do you mean?”
Harry gaped. Why had no one told him? How had he not known his grandfather was a fucking lube maker?
“Hermione thinks that we have unfinished business. You and me.”
“Oh.” Harry finally managed to sit up. His sleep-soaked mind was still confused about what Snape was doing lurking in his bedroom—well, his and Draco’s bedroom. The thought made him glance over to Draco’s side of the bed. Empty. “Where’s Draco?”
“Er, yes.”
“Er...” said Albus. Doing nothing to dispel the family resemblance.
as a thank you and Dean Thomas had complimented Draco on his newfound passion for Muggle music.
“Not really,” Harry grumbled.
Draco hurried to stop her.
about the Malfoy Martyrs. “Weren’t they involved in a domestic incident up North? Some protest in Leicester?”
“Oh, all of them.” Potter laughed again and Draco smiled in return. “Well, most of my rage is reserved for the students at Klanghorn Cottage Primary School.” Potter nodded in recognition and Draco continued. “Scorpius was already bigger than the other children when he joined Klanghorn and children... well... they’re very cruel, aren’t they?”
“Er…” Harry found himself alone with the Bumble-bum reader. “Do you actually look at the arses then or…
Draco was asleep on the bed and Harry spent a few minutes glaring at him before lying down. Squeezing his eyes shut, Harry focused on pushing every thought out of his head.
“Forgive each other? See you can’t even say it! How are we meant to-”
The entire exchange had been torturous for both father and son, especially as halfway through Scorpius’ seventh stuttered “er, you know” Draco had been forcibly reminded of Potter at the same age. In his hurry to reject the idea that his darling Scorpius could in any way resemble the muttering, shuffling, gormless teen-Potter, Draco had agreed to the date with Liam
“There is no need,” drawled a familiar voice. Harry spun around, making the two hands fly off his shoulder and almost getting a second bout of whiplash. “And if you ever call me that again, McLaggen, I’ll send you some lube with ground chilli inside.”
“What, aha,” he clear his throat. “What’s not normal?”
“You are welcome.” They munched in silence, Draco was careful to cup his hand under the biscuit. Nodding with approval, McGonagall Vanished the crumbs in his cupped hand and leant forward. “I’m sorry I don’t have any tea to offer you. Now,-” she held up a hand to forestall his assurance that tea was utterly horrid and a biscuit was much better. “Unregistered Animagi are illegal and as a Hogwarts Professor I am duty bound to report all incidents involving said Animagi to the Ministry of Magic. Luckily I did not see any unauthorised transformations this evening, otherwise the rest of the week would have been spent buried in paperwork and the potential expulsion of one of my most gifted students.” She eyed Draco in a beady way. Draco eyed her back.
As it turned out, Harry didn’t say anything. He simply took Draco’s hand and lead him towards the changing rooms, still smiling in that damnably fond way.
Malfoy was coming closer and closer as Cormac pushed Harry up the stairs and onto the stage with so much force that he almost faceplanted on the dildos. When he straightened up, Harry was pleased to note that Malfoy’s smile, too, had acquired a nervous curve.
having Draco wait on him.”
“She’s already gone.” Potter’s voice was muffled and, when Draco glanced up, both his cheeks were bulging with cereal.
“Finally,” a sharp voice rang out, the owner blocked from Harry’s view by Mr Snape’s billowing cape. “Did you bring him?”
“I’m afraid tonight is my night to dine with Mother and Father.”
"I can and I am." Blaise spoke calmly, chin slightly lifted.
“You’ve only seen the inside of a toilet,” Harry protested. “There’s more to Sheffield than empty cans of air-freshener and-” He was interrupted by Madam Hooch opening the door and ushering them all out into the foyer. The foyer was dimly lit, all the furniture covered in white dust-sheets, and the only occupant was a small woman with a high ponytail and big chandelier earrings who was standing behind the Welcome Desk.
“You were having your memory wiped every three minutes.” Draco sat back in his chair, stretching his arms above his head. “I think you can be forgiven for behaving like a normal human being, rather than a sugar-crazed maniac.”
“Can’t really see it myself mate.” Ron piped up. “Chap on the mug you’re holding though, he looks a bit like Malfoy, don’t you think?”
“That’s alright,” said Draco, smiling at Harry and Accioing the Marmite. The jar bounced off two of the cupboards before finally pin-balling into Draco’s hand.
Harry pinched the bridge of his nose and closed his eyes. This was the last straw. From rocketing dildos to starfish bras and arsehole readings, from Ron getting slapped over the face by fake, yet horrifyingly realistic, testicles, and Cormac’s attempts to get Harry on board as a shareholder of every second expensive item he laid his eyes on (be it dildos, cock rings, or fucking diamond encrusted
“Eugh” he gagged. “Strawberry jam.” Of course, Malfoy had to give him the flavour he hated the most. Some things simply didn’t change, and Malfoy being a prick was one of them. “You know I hate jam.”
“I suppose.” Draco didn’t exactly look enthusiastic.
“Fuck off,” Marcus muttered, burying his face in Oliver’s neck.
Minerva dressed with more care than usual the next morning. A new ribbon around the crown of her hat, a sprig of heather pinned to her lapel—tiny things that would hopefully still attract Rolanda’s attention. Not that she cared about that, she reminded herself as she picked her way across the dew-damp Hogwarts lawns and down to the Quidditch pitch. Her concern was for the success of the newly-formed Slytherdor team and their chances of bringing the cup into a close, warm association with Igor’s non-existent bottom.
Fudge was still talking about the campaign he wanted to run, something about a series of recruitment pamphlets for next year’s Hogwarts graduates, with continued mentions of Lucius’ “generosity”. It was no surprised to Draco that his father appeared to have dropped hints at a large party donation. A relatively new presence at the Wizengamot, Fudge was too green and greedy to understand the discrepancy between Lucius’ words and the Malfoy vaults. A gentle tap on his knee from Narcissa drew Draco’s attention back to the game.
“No.” Malfoy spoke through gritted teeth. “I am simply relaying information that we
from the bra he had been inspecting. A mermaid was standing – no, floating – beside him in what looked like a giant martini glass on wheels and wearing a… wearing a…
“In the Weasley library?” Draco asks, even as he leans in for another kiss.
“Hold up Malfoy.” Potter interrupted staring at his own phone for a moment before turning to the waitress. “We need a few more minutes, thanks.”
“Yes?” Snape was now sending a volley of cleaning spells whizzing around the room. It would be rather offensive, if the room hadn’t been occupied for three weeks by a pair of wizards with only two pairs boxers shorts between them.
“Yes, yes of course. I am sorry, Harry. I can’t help feeling a bit responsible; we did encourage you—”
“I was going to suggest a candlelit bowl of Frosties but apparently you and Liam the Underwear Model move faster than myself and Liam the Firefighter.”
“This is revolting,” Malfoy breathed, far too close to Harry’s ear. “The amount of magic she is wasting on this is—”
“Tiger.” Malfoy’s voice was tight, as if he himself wasn’t sure whether he found it funny or irritating. “Merlin, he’s even worse than I remember.” Then, as if finally deciding that Cormac was more comical than anything else, Malfoy laughed. It was a short, quiet laugh, but it still made Harry smile. “So.”
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
“He started it.”
“I do not doubt it.”
“Er, not sure. What, er, what is it?”
“Alright.” The waitress smiled at Potter and shot Draco an appraising look before moving away to serve another table as Kelis started making grand claims about the capabilities of her milkshake.
The hours ticked by and they watched Harry thwart Draco’s attempts to antagonise the barman into ejecting him from the restaurant. Then they watched Draco sing Hoggy-Hoggy-Hogwarts. It was nearly the end of the date and they watched the woman remove her headphones and eavesdrop on their conversation as Harry began talking about fancying Cedric Diggory.
“Whaahugng?” Harry rolled away from the finger.
“Hmm? Oh, nothing a bit of Scourify won’t fix.” She sucked the thumb into her mouth. It was much less distracting than when Draco sucked salad cream off his thumb, which was yet another reason Hermione was Harry’s best mate and Draco was a twattish twat. “Well? Are you going to clear out the spare room?”
“Hmm? Yes. Ms Granger asks that you meet her and one of the Weasleys at the Giggling Gryffindor for brunch.” Snape managed to make bunch sound like simultaneously the most depraved and tedious act he had ever heard of.
“You, Potter, are... you’re... you are a complete, utter... I...” Harry waited as Draco lapsed into silence again. After a while, he gave Draco a gentle nudge, smiling when Draco turned to look at him. “You’re... I hate you.”
Glancing down at his empty pint glass, Harry realised that he may already have had a bit too much to drink.
Harry, remembering exactly how much his own cock appreciated that penchant, gulped soundlessly. Malfoy held Harry’s eyes for a few seconds more, just enough to deepen the flush that had started to rise in Harry’s cheeks. He then cleared his throat and turned back to the crowd.
“Look.” Draco swallowed down a rush of rage, tried to choose his words carefully. “I have a date with a man called Liam. The waitress informs me that this table has been reserved under the name Liam. I am therefore waiting for my date, Liam, and I would greatly appreciate it if you could-”
“Potter.” The was something familiar about the way his prissy voice shaped Harry’s name.
“Do you like these jeans?” Harry heard himself ask.
“Well you’re certainly drinking them with gusto,” Draco observed. Potter shrugged in answer and gazed around the cafe, playing absentmindedly with his fringe.
“My stars?” The mermaid asked, smiling down at the live starfish plastered to her chest. As Harry watched, one lifted a fin and gave him a cheery wave. “Yes, they’re real. If you fancy some yourself there’s a stall-” she pointed out a table covered with scummy green tanks. The woman guarding the tanks was wearing a green scarf to match the algae and, as Harry watched, she sneezed violently.
“Nicely done.” Blaise smiled. “See you back at the dungeons.” He turned to reach out a hand to Ginny.
“What?”
“Ah,” said Draco, slowly raising both hands in a placating gesture. “Now I do understand how that might have—”
“Draco and Ms Granger have already left. I found them in the kitchen and imparted the good news.”
“Yeah. Yeah alright, fair point.” It really was very, very early. Slipping his fingers behind his glasses to rub his eyes, Harry contemplated the merits of calling it all a bad job and just continuing to push his fingers into his eye sockets until they found brain. “Forgiveness, then,” he said, keeping his eyes closed for a precious few seconds more. “Until we come up with a better plan. How do we do this?”
“Well…” Hermione looked at Harry. “Harry told Ron that things aren't going well and…Harry, maybe you’d like to step in here.” Harry glared back at her, his arms folded.
“Please,” Draco swallowed, rubbing his hand across his forehead. “Just cast it Potter.”
“A prank?” After three months of friendship and two years sharing a dorm with Blaise, Draco was fairly certain that the quiet, serious boy would dance naked in the Great Hall before doing anything even remotely prankish. Although what better way to guarantee that none of his fellow Slytherins would believe Ginny if she
“Yes, Mr Malfoy?” She came towards him, casting another useless Privacy Spell.
“You’ve got Roger for that,” said Draco.
“You alright?” Ginny’s voice was closer than before. She’d squatted down in the doorway, her skinny panda face screwed up in concern.
“Eggzactly?.”
“He’s not that bad.” Blaise gave her a small smile. “He is trying.”
“At least give him a chance,” Hermione murmured as their ex-Potions Professor swept into the kitchen.
“Hermione charmed the rubbish bin to empty directly into my bed when it was too full.” Harry interrupted.
The next few days passed in a whirlwind of bad temper and bad sandwiches. After Harry had refused to discuss Malfoy’s mauling (“stop calling it that you make it sound like Buckbeak started rubbing up against you on the bus”), they had spent the rest of the morning arguing about Hagrid’s teaching qualifications while Snape looked out the window and Hermione did a crossword.
picturing his first date in months vanishing before his eyes
“Sorry, er, Draco. When I think about that night you sort of turn into Malfoy, again.” Harry hadn’t realised he felt that way but as he spoke he knew it was the truth.
“Would be nice for Hogwarts not to be a complete shitshow,” Harry agreed.
Harry woke up hungover on Draco’s sofa. He knew it was Draco’s sofa because it was covered in cat hair and yet still looked more expensive than Harry’s entire house. Sitting up proved to be a mistake as the room dipped and swooped around him. Taking deep breaths and trying not to remember why his mouth tasted so horrible, Harry noticed his Auror robes tangled on the dining table with Mouse, Draco’s enormous white cat, curled up on top of them. As Harry watched, Mouse farted happily.
“Oh! No, no, I, um…” Ginny glanced at Draco. “I have the thing and…”
“Goodbye,” Minerva called.
“Do you always sleep in your glasses?” Draco was awake, propped up on one arm and...
He turned seeming to only now remember that they had an audience the entire time. Harry’s eyes swept the crowd. The mermaid was whispering to the water witch, the dildo witches were simply standing there with their eyebrows raised, there was no sign of the arse reader, but the mug witch was pointedly avoiding Harry’s gaze. Ron looked queasy, and Cormac, for once, didn’t seem to know what to say.
greeted Draco as he peered through the condensation-streaked windows and, for the 1000th time, cursed whatever Malfoyian inbreeding had made is physically impossible for him to say ‘no’ to Pansy.
“I didn’t do that. Did I?”
Harry didn’t know whether the bitterness in his mouth was a visceral physical representation of his disgust or had he really puked into his mouth?
Draco slightly mistimed the jump, putting a bit too much power into it and nearly knocking them both off the platform. By the time they’d regained their balance, Draco was finally ready to ask.
Instead, he huffed and marched towards the next set of stands.
“Great, I’ll be back in a few minutes with the drinks.”
Draco closed his eyes and waited for the time loop to catapult him back to Potter. Who he should probably call ‘Harry’, if they were going to... going to... Draco really had no idea what they were going to do or where that conversation had been headed. His heart felt like it was about to burst out of his chest as the toxic combination of adrenalin and booze-soaked Cheerios played havoc with his stomach.
it said in looping gold letters. Ron’s confused stare followed Harry’s and his expression morphed into that of appalled disgust. His shocked eyes fell on the girl behind the counter.
“That would be brilliant.” Rolanda beamed some more. “Chrissy says they’ll need two chaperones minimum so maybe you could come along too? If you can get the time for it?”

“Have you seen Blaise?”
“Fine th—”
Nothing had been said, but ever since Harry came back from his six month tenure on the Isle of Sark there had been
“Alright mate, calm down yeah,” Ron wrapped a hand around Harry’s elbow and tugged him back down into his chair. “Maybe we all need to take a moment.”
“Alright,” Potter reached across and took a large spoonful, chewed it for a few seconds and then gazed at Draco in complete horror. “This is rank.”
Sighing, Severus opened yet another cardboard box full of broken glass. In the aftermath of the scrimmage in the Department of Mysteries all the smashed prophecies had been swept up and packed away by the Ministry cleaning team. Now it was Severus’ privilege to paw through these boxes of glass and dust balls, in search of prophecies that could be either restored or recorded and then disposed of.
“Malfoys,” Draco drew himself up to his full height, “do not prance.”
“I do.” Draco’s eyes were a bit glassy and he was blinking a lot. “I didn’t want to hurt you either, not properly.”
“Fuck off, Greg,” Millicent snapped. “Mal is doing a great job explaining how not to rape someone, and-”
“Ginny? Are you alright?” Blaise’s quiet voice sent Ginny and Draco leaping apart.
“No one cares.” Ginny singsonged, showing a bit of the fighting spirit that had disappeared with Blaise’s arrival.
“Yes, thank you, Malfoy.” Ginny spoke through gritted teeth, contorting her body as she tried to inch along the wire.
“You and Liam the Firefighter saving it for the third date?”
“Oh dear me,” said McGonagall as she waved her wand over Draco. A cool, gel-like sensation smoothed along his overheated neck and Draco found himself returning to human form. “There, that’s much better.” McGonagall inspected him over the top of her glasses.
“Not a lot,” Draco admitted, settling further back in his seat. Potter managed to make the rusty garden furniture look like it was made for lounging but the ridges of Draco’s spine immediately began to ache. He sat up again. “I told Scorpius that he was a beautiful boy who was going to make a first class Beater,” he continued. “Then I had a word with the teacher, and banned mother from talking about diets.”
“Yeah, about that.” Ron stepped forward, taking Draco’s elbow and gently extracting him from Scorpius’ tentacle-like grip. “Nasty things, time traps. What with us having to reset it every time you tried to leave the restaurant, ah, well you’ve technically been on a date with Harry for over 48 hours.”
“No.”
“Er,” said Harry.
“Oh. So it works both ways? The charm?”
“Of course father.” Draco had nodded eagerly. “But a bit of goodwill from Fudge might make it possible to waive the Wizengamot entry fees and-”
“Right. Well, it didn’t look like he wanted to let go either so…”
"Indeed." Oh sweet Salazar, that was Snape's voice. Slinking back into the shadows, Draco flattened his small furry body to the wall and offered up a prayer that he wouldn't be seen. "Nimbus 2001." Snape responded to something Flitwick had said. He sounded pleased. Or at least, like he was a few feet from Death's door, rather than banging on it with both fists.
A Hogwarts team had never won the tournament, mainly because whenever a Gryffindor or Slytherin team qualified (which was 100% of the time), the other team would dedicate themselves to sabotage. With the Gryffindors that meant an endless series of exploding Quaffles, carnivorous Bludgers, dissolvable uniforms and amorous brooms. The Slytherins, meanwhile, favoured the kind of psychological warfare that usually led to broken hearts and angry owls.
“Professor Umbridge?” He returned to the classroom. There was a fresh cut on Potter’s cheek and some of the Inquisitorial Squad members looked upset.
To Harry’s surprise, the corner of Snape’s mouth twitched. “Very well,” he said, settling himself more comfortably in the only kitchen chair. “Let us discard this particular discussion and return to the matter at hand.”
). Harry could deal with that. Handcuffs and frills.
“I’m alright thanks, I’ve had my water.” He held up both hands, relaxing when the woman immediately stopped the advancing mug.
“Don’t be ridiculous, Potter, no one likes treacle tart that much.”
“I think so.”
“Did he now? Well, he’s not the first man to underestimate me.” Umbridge nodded grimly, for some reason making eye contact with Draco. “Mr Malfoy? A moment, if you please.” She walked over to the window and cast a Privacy Charm. Taking great care not to brush against Potter, Draco followed, hoisting his best sycophantic smile into place. It was a bit like his dashing smile but less confident and with a touch of grease.
“Of course.” McGonagall returned his smile as a plate of shortbread hovered between them. They munched in companionable silence, watching the rain sliding down the classroom windows.
“As I said, Potter’s task will be to taste the lube I’ll present him and try and guess the flavour. Some flavours are very simple, some are more complicated, but all are, if I may brag a bit, delicious.” Malfoy flashed the crowd a big smile. Harry didn’t like this smile. It was a fake sort of smile Malfoy gave to people he wanted to impress. The smile of his that was truly charming was the one that stretched his face when Harry said something unexpectedly funny and Malfoy tried his hardest not to show it but his mouth still quirked up and his eyes softened.
“Nope.” Harry’s pint was starting to boil. Stupid fucking magic. Stupid fucking Draco. Stupid fucking—
Potter waited until the waitress was out of earshot before turning to Draco. “I thought you hadn’t been here before?”
a Prefect and therefore should have been the first to-

“Ah. Albus, I presume?”
Potter frowned. “Well he–”
Draco’s mother did not reassure him. In fact she
Two hours later Harry jerked completely, horribly, awake. The bedroom was still cold, thin curtains bathing the room in an orange glow. Malfoy was lying next to him, breathing shallowly, his fingers twitching against the pillow. Letting out a small whimper, he arched his back slightly and rolled his head to the side as a stripe of orange illuminated his long throat.
“I’m not.” Harry glared at his pint.
“31…” Draco had lost track of the decrees after the one banning an infestation of Muggle Beanie Babies. Was 31 something to do with Extendable Ears or-
“Shhh.” Draco hushed him, apparently only just tuning into the couples’ frantic whispers. “They’re talking about us. The ferret and the phoenix. Oi.” He snapped his fingers in front of Ron’s nose. Harry tried not to smile at the sound of his own West Country ‘oi’ coming out of Draco’s prissy mouth. “What are you talking about? Why are we in an oven?”
there.
“Yes.” Harry grinned up at him, pivoting slightly so that Draco’s back was pressed against the wall and Harry was pressed against him. “Now, stop squirming before we both fall over.”
Draco grimaced his thanks and waited until she had moved away to the next table before swinging round to glare at Potter.
“Me.” Alicia held up a hand.
“The war,” said Hermione, her hand tightening on Ron’s knees. “What it was like, being in it.”
“Um, I think it’s actually ‘huddle together’.” Judging by the way Draco shrank back against the headboard, that was very much the wrong thing to say. “I mean, if we’re going to do it we should call it by the right name.” Harry hurried on, reaching forward and pulling the duvet away from Draco. “Come on.” he wiggled down onto his back, holding the duvet open for Draco to follow suit.
“Yeah.” Tonks continued. “Do you think you could maybe watch the screen? Just for a bit?”
“Did we agree on that?” Ron asked. “Seem to remember agreeing that you’re a helpless case-”
“Really?” Snape brushed past Draco and took the only comfortable armchair. “Fascinating. I presume that the forms are limited to cold-blooded animals?”
Bright white light filled the small room and a deep, booming voice began to speak: “
It never failed, Draco thought happily to himself as Janice swallowed heavily. Everyone had secrets, even the most ardent Inquisitors. Whatever Janice
“Not even the tiniest bit.” Harry interrupted her, widening his eyes at Ron.
“Only if you prefer your men malnourished and vampiric.” Draco sniffed, taking a sip of tea.
“He does,” Ron shrugged. “Now that he’s trying to lean out we do it every morning, for 20 minutes, fasted. I’m getting pretty burnt out, to be honest.”
Before Malfoy even finished proclaiming the company slogan, Harry turned around and fled down the stairs to the side of the stage. He couldn’t deal with this. Not here, not now. He didn’t know what Malfoy wanted. When Harry tasted the treacle tart lube he had truly thought that there was something behind it, especially after Malfoy’s reluctance to show it to him. But he was probably being stupid. There were all those flavours available. Of course Malfoy was going to make a treacle tart one. He probably didn’t want to give it to Harry precisely because he knew Harry would assume it meant something more.
“Prefer the live ones, myself.” The gentle voice caused Harry to leap about 10 feet in the air and 10 feet
. The table was set for two and there was a pile of toast and a plate of scrambled eggs steaming under a Stasis charm. “Ullo,” Harry coughed, tried again. “Hello, thanks for letting me crash.”
“Oi, Harry!” A Wotsit bounced off Harry’s forehead.
“Much worse,” Malfoy agreed.
“How did he know they were connected?” Harry tried to remember if he’d seen anything about an attempted Malfoy-snatching in
“Are you alright?” Potter was looking concerned.
“No,” said Harry, already moving to sit next to Draco. “I’m not playing Spin the Bottle.”
Not that it was Harry and Draco’s bed. It was Harry’s bed, or—if pushed—Harry and Oliver’s bed. Although he was fairly sure that Oliver was planning to sneak into the Slytherin boys’ room later on, which meant that Draco would probably be evicted from the bed he was sharing with Marcus and then Draco would probably need to share with Harry and-
“Er, yep. Yes.” Harry nodded, trying to tear his eyes away from her hair. It was currently white and reminded him a bit of… “How do they, er, work? Also… what are they?”
“Oh? Why is that? I had thought you Gryffindors far too noble to be swayed by a bit of totty in a g-string.”
“I...” Minerva was once again distracted by Rolanda nice smile. “Yes,” she heard herself say, “I would like that.”
“Isn’t that my line?”
“She also says that Pansy texted you.”
Malfoy composed himself quickly, all hesitance gone as a small cunning smile curled across his lips. “Perfect,” he almost purred, then turned to the crowd. “We have our volunteer! Potter,” he said, “care to join me on the stage?”
Even Potter’s crass bid for attention via that flying car couldn’t dampen Draco’s mood, although he was a bit sick of the Muggle-born Slytherins comparing Potter to someone called James Bond. As if a Muggle with a gun could in any way compare with the daring feats of Gilderoy Lockhart.
Harry frowned. Malfoy
“No, you don’t. Do you?”
“Really rank.”
“I didn’t want to hurt him then; I didn’t know what the spell did. I really didn’t,” Harry turned to Draco. “You know that, right?”
“The man you spent all of last night slobbering over in Millicent’s shrubbery.” Draco persisted. “Terribly gauche, Potter. What if
“What are you hiding?” Harry asked, gesturing to where Draco’s shirt was stretched over his knees. Draco blinked back at him.
“Ready to order?” The waitress had returned. She was wearing a handknitted scarf now — it really was abominably cold — and it took a few moments for Draco to realise that the wobbly grey pattern on it was supposed to be breakfast spoons.
“What things?”
“Alright, but what about the others?” Harry asked Draco, trying to ignore the way Fred was kissing Angelina’s knuckles while George and Alicia pretended to vomit on each others’ shoulders.
“Right,” said Harry, feeling a bit queasy. “I’m going to just…er…yeah, let you finish up. Have fun with your parents.”
It took a few minutes for the charm to settle, leaving Harry ample time for some brooding. Cassius and Katie were deep in conversation, their hands not quite touching on the purple duvet. George and Alicia were laughing as they sent enchanted Quavers zooming around the overhead light. All the couples were wrapped up in each other, Greg was in the loo, Astoria was reading the room service menu, and Harry was…
“Only that Rolanda seems rather fond of you and a bit of extra attention from you might, ah, work some magic, as the Muggles say.”
People didn’t hear what he and Malfoy were saying, did they? They had kept their conversation to whispers. There was no way the audience had heard. It was probably the act of seeing their Saviour lick a dildo that had the crowd stupefied and Ron queasy. Harry would feel queasy himself if he saw Ron licking lube in public. Or in private.
Unsure of how best to comfort Draco without insulting Draco’s pride by appearing to actually try to comfort him, Harry stayed silent. Except for his teeth. They were now smashing together like the hail starting to bounce off the pavement. After a moment the noise attracted Draco’s attention as he turned rather bloodshot eyes toward Harry and, with a huff, pulled off his own scarf.
“Er. Alright Malfoy?” Opening his eyes, Draco found himself standing on the pavement outside Cereal Monogamist with Ron Weasley.
He was definitely the only person caught in the time loop. No one else had tried to leave since Draco arrived and he was fairly sure that he’d recognise the wide-eyed look of panic if any of them had been jolted back in time. Just because Malfoy’s were trained to wrestle their expressions into submission from the crib didn’t mean that everyone had that habit.
“Hey.” Ginny reaches over to snap her fingers in front of Draco’s face. “Not that I mind listening to Percy drone on about cursed rectums-”
“I apologise,” he says, raking a hand through his hair. “A momentary lapse in-”
“What,” Draco blinked rapidly, gazing around him at the restaurant. He didn’t remember sitting back down. Three tables over he could see a woman offering her companion a taste from her bowl of cocoa-pops that Draco was sure he’d knocked onto the floor less than ten seconds ago. That Kelis song was playing again, wasn't someone going to skip it?
“Sorry, I drank it all.” Draco Accioed the ketchup, it hit the light and then smacked down onto the table, sending a red fountain into the air.
They were currently in the middle of the hall right outside the Potion’s classroom, and they finally had the chance to talk about last night’s events, which Harry really didn’t look forward to.
Harry didn’t know if Malfoy had read his mind or something, but the next second Malfoy was already running through the door, slamming it behind him.
He had no choice, he had to either run away and become a criminal of both sides, light and dark, watching his parents die after being tortured; or it was to save their lives for a little longer, with the price of his own freedom, future and sanity. He never had the right to choose.
Harry seemed to like that more, as he rested his head on Draco’s, breathing in his scent.
“Are you stupid or have you lost your mind? What about the Dark Lord that’s at large right now? What about the death eaters?” Draco nearly cringed for mentioning that, as he was a part of the ‘scumbags’ now.
“You smell nice.” He murmured into Draco’s scalp.
Potter cocked his head and nodded in agreement.
They taste like apples and cream, probably his shaving cream, but it was exactly what he’d dream of. Lost in his thoughts, Harry was pulled back by the squirming of the body under his hand.
“—how about we let Professor Flitwick deal with this?” Draco heard Professor Snape suggest.
Oh no, what if Flitwick sees his hard-on?
So how did this happen? Let’s trace back to that morning.
By now, Draco’s heart was pumping at an inhuman speed now. What did he mean? On one hand, he was afraid, was he going to say he was disgusting? But on the other hand, why would the golden boy just stay back to tell him that, that just didn’t make sense. Unlike the muffin-headed characters in the novels that he’d read, Draco Malfoy wasn’t dumb, in fact, if it weren’t for Granger, he’d be top of the class for most subjects.
The darkness engulfed his vision, as he walked along the grounds. He’d used a dilutional charm to sneak out of the dormitories, even if the knight on the painting did scowl at him for disturbing his beauty sleep.
“Don’t you remember what he did?” Cho asked.
Harry was shocked to hear this, he was raised in the muggle world, and because most gay people were excluded and made fun of because they were different, he was surprised to hear that wizards actually don’t mind.
Typical Hermione, leave it to her to organize an inter-house party right after he and Malfoy duelled and had detention yesterday.
A history of Hogwarts. Again.
Pansy and Blaise were fuming as he finished. Pansy was gritting her teeth and Blaise was clenching his hand.
Harry did not know how to feel.
Draco closed his eyes waiting for the feel of freedom once again when nothing happened, he peeked open an eye to see a very confused Potter and a pissed off Snape.
“So, what are you really here for? I doubt it was about questioning my knowledge and observations.” Granger said calmly.
“Parkinson, what is wrong with Malfoy?” Potter turned to Pansy.
“You can’t even defend me from your own friend’s insults.” Draco looked away. Heart sinking.
“Could we keep this from Ron for a bit?”
Harry saw that Malfoy had no way out of this, he saw Malfoy begin to panic.
“Very well, sit down then, Potter.” He gestured to a not-so-destroyed sofa with Slytherin colours.
Harry wasn’t in a good mood as breakfast went by in a rush, as he didn’t see a certain Slytherin at the green table full of snickering kids.
“Never have I ever dated a Slytherin.”
But seeing as today they could go to Hogsmeade’s, Harry decided to leave the Malfoy thing for a little while longer, and have some fun, just in case his head explodes due to overstressing before he even had the chance to seduce Draco and kill the Dark Lord.
“Is anyone here?” the voice rang again.
“I-It’s not funny, Potter, better scram back to you’re stinky Gryffindor nest before I take house points off you for- “
However, everything in him mind froze as he saw Potter jog towards him and kneel.
Two seconds after the magic had drained out of him Harry immediately regretted what he’d just done. What had he just done????
“It’s nothing.” He said to Draco. “Ron asked how it’s going with us, you and me, and I said that we were probably not going to give the, you know, relationship idea a go but that I’m still happy to work with you and there’s no hard feelings.” He finished in a rush.
“Just a bit,” answered Hermione. “It turns out that we can speed up the process of transforming if we brew a potion with concentrated mandrake as a base, rather than that nonsense with the leaves. The problem is that the concentrated version limits the number of forms we can take.”
“Hmm? Of course. What is it like to die?” Draco winced even as he was asking the question. “Sorry, that is not, ah. Sorry. Please, do not answer.”
“That’s right,” Potter smiled.
“We were talking about you and Harry.” Hermione interrupted.
“No.” Harry gave him a quick once over. “I’d say you’re still pretty desirable.”
“-and after all that they finally finished it and I want to give it to him before the kickoff. There.” Ginny finished winding up which had probably been a very boring story and gave Draco’s sleeve
“Oi.” Harry and Ron spoke together while Hermione narrowed her eyes and Accioed’ the empty wine glass.
“Yep, go ahead. What should we do?” Really, it was like Snape hadn’t just offered to help, the way he was blinking. It wasn’t exactly like they had many other options, unless lobbing the prophecy off the balcony had been considered. Probably not the best idea, Harry decided, what with not knowing how many other versions of the prophecy existed. He vaguely recalled Snape saying something about how most of the prophecies in the Hall had been duplicates. “Come on then.” he sighed. “Let’s have it.”
“Mmhmm, I thought you might need a while longer to come around to my…” Draco trailed off.
“Er, yeah. Guess so. Or a slice of pizza, or something.” Silence falls. Draco is still holding Harry’s wrist, his thumb rubbing across the soft, warm skin. With a huff of air, Harry reaches out to stop the movement. “Sorry,” he says, glancing at the stairs. “Probably should-”
“Excuse me,” the mug witch spoke up. “Are you interested in buying a mug? Because this man has been waiting a long time.” Harry tore his eyes away from the picture of the blond wizard. The next customer was Cormac, clutching nine mugs, all of which seemed to have a picture of…
“Indeed, come along, Granger.” Draco turned towards the door, trying not to smile when Umbridge immediately cleared her throat;
“Alright!” She held up both hands in surrender. “Maybe I’m the one who is a bit tired. Waiting for you and Harry to stop twatting about and-”
“Harry, mate.” Ron paused, apparently expecting Harry to interrupt. “Alright I know it didn’t work out too well last time—”
As the only person who wasn’t involved in the prophecy, Snape had suggested he play the role of Forgiveness Facilitator. Unfortunately, he was about as good at teaching forgiveness as he was at teaching potions.
In which Draco goes to the Yule Ball.
“Why?”
“I know who the Malfoy Martyrs are.” Harry’s mouth was dry, the room appeared to have shrunk by a few feet. “They’re that group of Death Eater apologists who think your dad should have been the Dark Lord.”
“Exactly.” Hermione lifted her head, looked around at the three of them. “We’ve all done enough hiding and running, time for a new plan.”
“That explains the bangs, then.” Harry nodded to the jar.
“Per year?”
“Since forever, dickhead. Don’t listen to him.” Fred turned to Angelina, who looked like she was trying to melt the grey swirls off the carpet. “He’s just being a prick. I’m 100% committed, yeah?”
After some awkward hovering, most of the Slytherin team had ended up on the rock hard sofa. Having spent an ill-advised 30 seconds sitting on that sofa, Harry knew that the shiny purple and grey beast might as well have been carved out of granite. Although, he supposed he could see why the Slytherins felt a bit uneasy about sitting on the hotel room’s other double bed. That was the bed Harry was supposed to be sharing with Oliver, despite the Weasley twins’ protestations.
“What?” Harry peered around Fred.
“Fuck’s sake,” Harry pulls away. “There’s no need to be such a wanker about it, bit of an honest mistake on my part is all. Turns out your love for yourself is the greatest thing of-will you stop fucking smiling?” His voice rises.
“Right then.” Potter downed the last of his drink and then went back to staring in dismay at the two bowls of equally inedible cereal. “This is probably £30 worth of cereal we’ve fucked up the ordering of.”
“Don’t do that,” said Draco.
“Beyond being the chief assassin of your fanclub?”
“Well, well, look who is “fixating on the physical” now.”
“Sold!” Cormac banged his palm on the counter, making some of the taller dildos sway dangerously.
“No thank you.”
“Fond of me?”
“Yeah, suppose so.” Harry laughed along with her. This was nice, he thought to himself, maybe he could just stay here for the rest of the fair. She looked like the kind of woman who might have a flask of tea tucked away somewhere and-
Ron cocked his head to the side, “Taking it slow?”
“Aurors, Potter! You are one. Do you really expect us to believe that your first thought would not be to inform them that Granger, your friend and flatmate, was in trouble?”
!” Harry really, really, really wanted to punch something. He was considering Cormac because, if anyone, he deserved it most for being a twat, but Harry would probably break his fist on his abs or something equally pathetic. “And you didn’t think to tell me?”
“An excellent point!” Fred yelled as he and Angelina took turns jumping between the two beds. “A name, we must have a name!” Before Marcus could respond, the door swung open with a bang and a flash of bright white light filled the room.
“It hasn’t been perfected yet,” Malfoy said, shiftily.
Harry’s head twitched in his direction so hard that he almost got whiplash. “What? We’re not!”
“And she’s getting Luna because...”
“At your service, Ms Soon-To-Be-Lovegood.”
“Right” Malfoy said for the third time in an effort to collect himself. “That was, indeed strawberry jam as Potter correctly guessed. Now, onto the next one.”
“Mafalda’s Muggle-born,” he protested. “Why don’t you ask her?”
“Alright, won’t be long.” Harry grins, swinging his feet down to the floor and turning to face Draco. “Yeah,” he says, uncovering the receiver. “Makes sense. Yeah. Good one Mazza. Alright. Ok.” He rolls his eyes, still grinning at Draco. Against his better judgement, Draco feels himself grinning back.
“Does it matter?” Draco asked, leaning in close to Harry and pressing a small kiss to his shoulder. It was a bit odd and incredibly nice. “After tonight they’ll have more than enough motivation to move out.” He kissed Harry’s shoulder again, grinning as Harry grinned back at him.
“Her favourite daughter-in-law who was divorced from Percy over a year before you began seeing him.”
“Tell me you didn’t.” He stared at her in horror. “Is he coming here?”
“Ooooooooooooooh.”
Draco huffed at Harry’s words.“Well really,” he started, building up to a good rant, “having a good team for the Cup
“Gryffindors.” The woman shook her head, absentmindedly handing Harry a croissant and taking one for herself. “Here. If you get vanilla you’ll find love, if you get chocolate you’ll die alone.” Harry had already taken a bite and was frozen mid-chew - not another bloody prophecy - when he realised that his mouth was full of caramel.
“Fine,” Harry huffed. He spun the bottle a little too vigorously and it shot away at an angle, smashing off the wardrobe. Silence filled the room as team Slytherdor gawped at Harry. “Er... sorry about that. I’ll be more careful.”
“Well.” Harry walked forward, slowly. “Only if you want me to.”
“What, er—” Harry cleared his throat. “What do you mean?” He’d been so sure that they were done. The remaining Death Eaters were dead or incarcerated, fallen friends buried, former enemies forgiven. Well, some of them, he corrected himself, glancing back to the dark hallway where Snape and Malfoy were probably lurking.
And there he was, with that ridiculous pointy face and that ridiculous flush, waving those ridiculous hands and talking with that ridiculous, ridiculous mouth that Harry missed so much. The whole thing was a disaster. They had enough trouble containing themselves when they met in pubs and at ministry functions. Meeting in a hall full of sex toys was begging for catastrophe.
“It’s jager night,” said Harry, glaring at the bar as a crowd of Muggle students did another round. One of them inhaled the shot glass and was immediately hit by a variety of discrete unsticking charms. Harry should probably arrest everyone for breaching The Statute.
“What about me?”
“I am not Tod!” Harry followed Draco, ducking his head to keep the worst of the hail off his face and smiling as Draco launched into a rant about “foolish Gryffindors” who “couldn’t follow a rule to save their lives”.
“A fondness for dangerous creatures is hardly a legitimate qualification, Potter.”
“You know where everything is?” Molly’s smile slips as she asks the question, although this may be due to the loud crashes coming from the kitchen.
She made her way back up to the castle. Something uncomfortable was nagging at the back of her mind.
“Control, Mr Malfoy. The only way to achieve a mid-air transformation is to-”
“Ready for what?” Harry took a sip of his pint. He was trying not to think about Draco and he was fairly sure that alcohol would help with that.
“They don’t need to know, the act of forgiveness and relinquishment of anger is a transformative act,” said Malfoy, he sounded like Hermione.
“Lies,” Ron spoke up. “You’ve never made me breakfast.”
Harry snorted. The one thing he liked about Cormac was that he made him laugh when he didn’t feel like laughing at all. “Who thinks of sex as recreational cardio?” Harry shook his head, finally looking up.
“Is that so?” Draco glared at Potter. “Green?”
“Yes, I do.” She slammed the plate of biscuits down on the table. Harry knew why he was taking his bad temper out on their crockery, but what had got Hermione going? Unless...
Potter flushed and his grin disappeared. “Um. No? Well, maybe a bit.”
In which Draco and Toad Boy try on some robes.
After a while Snape got around to confirming the exact words of the prophecy he’d found (“by luck,” Harry’s throbbing brain insisted):
“Charrrm? What on Earth would charrrm do in a situation such as this?” For some reason, the idea of attempting to “charm” Rolanda was so irritating that Minerva found herself compelled to pace. “This is serious, my dear. If Rolanda continues to be resistant to...” she trailed off, eyes fixed on the fire. What exactly was it that Rolanda was resistant to? She always seemed cheerful enough to see Minerva on the pitch, swooping down with that perfect posture, still holding onto her classic Keeper’s form after all these years...
“Yes, yes.” Lucius interrupted. “Are the Irish really fielding Ryan as first Keeper?” Draco almost turned around to commiserate with his father—what were the coaches
“Oh goodness, Minnie. Do try to stop being such a Gryffindor. Some harmless flirting is hardly the equivalent of auctioning off your virtue to the highest bidder, you never know, but...” Poppy shook as she suppressed another laugh. “You might find that you enjoy it.”
“It’s not canoodling,” he said, wrapping his arms even more firmly around Draco.
“Well it really depends on how you’re feeling,” she explained, wrapping her arms around herself and bobbing on the spot. “Is there a colour you feel strongly about?”
“What sparked it?”
cover-to-cover 148 times, and he knew a time loop when he saw one.
“No. I feel like a man who spent the last however many hours hurtling back and forth across time.”
The shouts and whistles died away as team Slytherdor scrambled to get into less incriminating positions. Fred and Angelina dropped into a sitting position on the twins’ bed, knocking their heads together as they did. The couples who had been intertwined untwined themselves and someone kicked the bottle under the sofa. Unfortunately, it shot out the other side and came to rest against Professor McGonagall’s boot.
“You’re just showing off now,” said Harry. Four days had passed since they’d decided to focus on forgiveness. Harry had spent most of the time arguing with Draco about whether dressing up as a Dementor really counted as a Quidditch foul. Hermione, meanwhile, had been busy having quiet chats with Snape, tearfully hugging Draco, working through her childhood traumas and asking Harry annoying questions like “don’t you feel a bit sorry for Draco? Trapped in that house with Voldemort, hostage to his father’s ambition?”
“I would,” Cassius shot back. “Kissing people who don’t want to kiss me back isn’t really my thing.”
As a fellow Midlander, Severus might have hoped for some support from the Solihull-born witch: a shared smile when their teammates insisted on pronouncing the “s” in “issue”, a roll of the eyes when the department head started using his “Brummie” accent—small things that would have eased the strain of being “practically a Northerner, darling” in a group of Southern County Seers.
In which Draco finds some unexpected allies.
"Salazar, what does it matter?" Draco had asked, admiring Blaise's handmade Italian leather brogues and the understated gold serpent tiepin, glittering in the firelight. "Still Blaise, I take it?" He stepped forward, holding out his hand. A beat passed and then Blaise nodded and accepted the handshake. "Excellent, you can bunk next to me. Vincent-" Draco redirected his attention. "You can move into the spare bed, take your snoring with you." It wasn't a very good joke, but Blaise laughed and the ice melted away, leaving Draco with a potential new rung on the social ladder.
Harry stared at him, incredulous. “Half of these aren’t any good!”
“A tent?” Draco accidentally sniffed up a bit of hot chocolate. “I hardly think-” A small explosion interrupted Draco’s meditation on the likelihood of himself camping out in the middle of Muggle Hackney.
“Because I feel like maybe now we’re past all that school nonsense things could be alright between us, yeah? I know we don’t know each other all that well but—”
Draco’s back straightened and he cleared his throat. “Eyes on the screen, Potter.”
It had taken twelve meals of nothing but sandwiches for Draco to claim he had an allergy to Hellmann's salad cream and insist that Snape teach him how to use the microwave. The two of them were in the kitchen, wrapping the microwave in magic-repelling charms, while Hermione and Harry looked for a way to speed up the Animagus charm.
“Imbecile. I’m sharing a bed with a complete imbecile.” Malfoy sat back against the headboard, shaking his head.
“Oh no.” Cassius’ voice cut through Harry’s jumbled thoughts. “Red is red, young Harold.” A firm hand landed on Harry’s shoulder and yanked him back, away from Draco.
“Would you like me to come with you?” He asked, already trying to work out if he could charm the label on a Waitrose bottle of wine to make it look like it was elf made.
He had, after all, spent his entire 8th year as a rather anxious and irritable but well-intentioned student mentor to the young, Muggle-born Slytherins. He had composed many heartfelt letters and thoughtful playlists for everyone he harmed during the war. Luna had even gone as far as to send him
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
a man who Pansy had met in a Muggle Gardening Centre and who she insisted would be "goals" for Draco.
“Astoria, you, Greg and I are underage,” said Draco. “As for the third Gryffindor-”
“That’s what you came up with?”
“Oh, what does that mean?” Draco tried to keep his tone light but Potter’s shoulders were shaking and the waitress’ smile slipped.
“Alright?” The waitress reappeared, carrying two green bowls. “Here you go,” she carefully placed the fuller bowl in front of Harry, “and for you” she banged the smaller bowl down in front of Draco.
-+-+-+-+-+-
“Look it doesn’t matter-”
It took a while for Harry’s eyes to adjust to the dark, to notice that someone was sitting on the bench.
“Kink and let kink. It’s not that deep.” The girl shrugged. She had obviously become completely desensitized to the abnormality of her profession.
“Sorry,” Harry leaned even closer, feeling Draco’s hair brush against his lips as he whispered. “You think they’re in it for the glory?”
“Yeah, it’s Hermione’s. She must have...” Harry forgot what he was going to say next when a second otter wiggled through the door and sat down next to the first otter.
“Solver, creator.” Harry seesawed both hands, palms facing the ceiling. “Either way, you’re the reason we’re standing around in mud when we could be—”
Severus Snape was thinking about HobNobs when he found the prophecy. Specifically he was thinking about the packet of half-eaten HobNobs he had seen Griselda Grimshaw tucking behind the microwave in the Department of Mysteries staff room. A well-paid position on the Hall of Prophecy restoration project was a pipe-dream come true, even if the work itself was a tad... monotonous.
“And they just left?”
“Cheertinis.” Potter swirled the last few soggy Cheerios sitting at the bottom of his glass. “I asked for a recommendation and then I got embarrassed when she asked if I liked it and ordered another.”
Of course to do all those
“What-” Without thinking, Draco reaches out and snags Harry’s wrist. “Where are you going?”
“You sure? It seemed like you weren’t keen to let go of Harry.” Her words struck Draco between the shoulder blades and he paused a moment.
“The same Liam?”
“You asked me about what it’s like to die, thanks for that, and I asked you why you wanted to know.” Potter pressed even further forward, his right hand almost touching Draco’s cuff and the rusty table digging into his belly.
“And what’s the name?”
“I’m going to fix this.” He said, half-turning to look at Potter.
“We’re not out to get you. Just leave us alone and we’ll leave you alone, alright? Come on, Blaise.” She opened the door. “Malfoy probably needs a bit of time to get used to the idea that people can be friends without first needing to name dropping mass murderers.”
“The stage. Was. On
“Actually I’m a
“Liam the fictitious Underwear Model, apparently.”
“Right, yeah, you’re right,” said Harry, rubbing a hand over his face and up through his hair. “Couple of dates is hardly a relationship. Yeah. So anyway moving on,” he addressed himself to Ron, “do you reckon the Canons are going to play Pennyfogger on Saturday or stick with Shariq?”
“The time.”
“So you’re fine with this?” he asked.
“You might consider following her lead,” said Draco.
version,” Cassius said, holding up both hands.
“Why?” A familiar pressure was starting to build behind Harry’s eyes. The shock of losing and regaining half of his memories in the space of an hour was wearing off. Magic sizzled at the tips of his fingers, causing the kitchen counter to buckle.
“You’ve been in there for two days!” Scorpius interrupted.
“Um.” Draco blinked, rubbed his left eye. “I suppose it might have been helpful. Um, why didn’t you help Theo?”
After Draco gave up on being able to leave through the Cereal Monogamist door, he tried to break a window, only for Potter to intercept him and confiscate the chair. By the time Potter wrestled the chair from him the waitress was already calling the police and so Draco had to make a dash for the door and restart the time loop. In a split second he was zapped back into his chair as the waitress placed a Cheerio-cocktail in front of Draco and Potter, for the millionth time, started mumbling on about their fake date.
Malfoy opened his mouth to say something, then promptly closed it. “Well, it’s a fairly basic taste, isn’t it,” he said, turning to the audience again, completely ignorant to the pang of disappointment in Harry’s stomach.
, could she? Umbridge had spent the last year singing the Ministry line that the Dark Lord had not returned. And even if she had suspected - Draco had ruefully come to the conclusion that Fudge wasn’t quite as much of an idiot as his father believed - surely she wouldn’t, she wouldn’t, wouldn’t just blurt it out in this manner.
“And did you?” Draco asked, raising an eyebrow.
“That’s not how any of those sayings work.” Harry hissed while, somewhere in the back of his mind, acknowledging that this was actually a solid piece of advice.
“Really?” Potter leant forward. “You’re finding the menu that doesn’t exist easy to understand?”
“Very well. Another time, on a proper date.” He waited for Harry to nod. “One we both know we’re on.” Harry nodded again. “And now.” Draco turned back to Hermione and Ron. “To the real matter at hand, isn’t it time you tell Harry that you have moved back into his home?”
In his haste to get as far away from the stage as possible he almost missed Ron and Cormac making their way towards him through the crowd.
“Oh is Moaning Malfoy back?” Harry asked, jumping into the swamp. “What the fuck! Why is it so cold in here?” He gave Draco a look of utter betrayal, as if
“Do you think she’ll come back?”
“Are you honestly telling me that everytime the Dark— Voldemort made an attempt on your life the three of you trooped off to the library and rehashed all the old lore?” Malfoy’s face seemed to be stuck between disbelief and a kind of gleeful horror.
“I can go,” Harry repeated, shifting from foot-to-foot.
“What dating thing?” Draco threw a bewildered glance at Hermione. “Did you hit your head during the raid today? I told Robards to—”
“Maybe so, maybe so. But you know, there are very few problems in this life that cannot be solved with the application of a little kindness. Either directed towards others or yourself.”
Fat chance.
“Yes. Come on, Malfoy. Let us go. Janice already said you don’t like this stuff and-”
“I know you’re taking the piss.” Mafalda grinned back at him. “But in about three seconds, one of these idiots is going to think that’s a good idea and then-”
Harry was fine. Of course he was fine. It was exactly Draco’s luck that, instead of being killed or incapacitated during the raid, Harry strolled out of the Cereal Monogamist without a scratch on him, ready and willing to review the tapes. Which apparently they were going to do immediately. Impervious to Draco’s protests, Ron handed them off to a harassed Auror and disappeared into the crowd.
“Right, um, well actually I-” Draco stops, takes a deep breath. “I’m smiling because I am happy, I think.”
“Meh.” Potter shrugged. “It’s usually more about the person.”
“Hag.” Draco pretended to push her over, only to have to grab the doorstep again when the mud shifted beneath his feet. By the time he’d regained his balance, Millicent had finished cackling and was halfway up the climbing wall. This really was the most ridiculous activity Draco had ever engaged in.
“You think?”
“Very well.” Snape blinked some more, composing himself with a shake of the head. “We must assume that the kidnappers have a duplicate of the prophecy and will be aware if we do manage to terminate it. However. As a mere two weeks from tomorrow will be the third Beltance since Voldemort’s death, I suggest the three of you remain here.”
“Magical creatures must drink at least 1.5 gallons of water to stay hydrated,” said the woman. Without looking away from Harry, she clicked her fingers and a long ribbon of water began pouring into one of the mugs. “If you intend to have sex then you will need another half gallon to avoid symptoms like halitosis, dry mouth, empty testicles, flat feet, premature ageing, and eventual death.”
“About that. My date is also with someone called Liam.”
“Like my arse,” Greg interrupted, speaking for the first time since the team had Portkey’d into the Travelodge toilets.
“If I may.” Draco held up a hand. “I am aware that we ordered Cheertinis but would it be possible to change our drinks to a Sugar Puff Sour for Potter and a Honey-Nut Cluster Fuck for myself?”
“A what?”
“Is that... Is that what you want?”
Harry only hoped it wasn’t quite as excitable in bed.
“It’s not like that.” Hermione kicked back at Harry’s trainer, both arms wrapped around her waist. “The sandwich was for you. Memory Charms always make me hungry so...” She shrugged.
“Yes.” Draco sighs, letting his thumb drift across to press gently against Harry’s bottom lip. “Because I love myself. Or because I, ah-” He clears his throat.
“Bonding,” said Madam Hooch, reaching over Professor McGonagall’s shoulder to Summon the bottle.
“But why the fuck did you become a fucking lube taster?” Harry thought that he might be swearing a bit too much, but who the fuck cared, this was the weirdest fucking day of his life, Blast-Ended Skrewts lesson included.
“That’s Barry Trotter!” Cormac guffawed, flexing to keep all the mugs in place. “I see your ego is getting a workout, even if your quads aren’t.” He gave Harry a meaningful look—he’d been doing that a lot recently.
Much to Draco’s consternation, it did not seem to matter what colour bowl he and Potter ordered. Red, blue, yellow, purple, green, every colour resulted in Potter gazing mournfully down at a bowl of inedible food. Although an upside to the five time loops it took to work through all their options was that Draco did become a great deal more familiar with the Cereal Monogamist cocktail range. Feeling slightly sick and very sticky, Draco stumbled to the door to restart the time loop for the 32nd time and-
“Well take it from someone who knows,” she dropped her voice. “It’s not worth it.”
“Stop right there.” Harry held up a hand. Malfoy’s mouth snapped shut. “The way this works is that we talk about the problem until something clicks. That includes asking stupid questions.”
“It wasn’t safe.”
“A spot of possession is hardly murder.” Draco muttered. The words sounded hollow and Ginny carried on as if he hadn’t spoken.
“So much blood, Malfoy.” Ginny continued. “It’s practically a medical emergency.”
They sat in silence, taking occasional sips of their drinks. The buzz of the alcohol was starting to take the edge off the cold, although every exhale still sent a cloud of steam into the room.
Not even sitting. He was reclining on Harry’s bed. For fucks sake, the man was practically lounging. And since when had Harry started calling Draco a 'man'? He was only two months older than Harry, who was fourteen. And three months. And twenty-one days. So Draco was not a man. He was a fourteen year-old prat. Pale and gangly, with an Adam’s apple that looked like he’d swallowed a toblerone, and a spattering of angry spots across his chin, and-
“Probably, why are you asking?”
“Harry?”
Draco’s white hair absorbed every scrap of moonlight, creating a faintly glowing halo. He was wearing black skinny jeans and the undershirt of his Quidditch uniform.
“Nice to see Draco sticking up for you.” Ron shrugged, toasting Draco with what used to be Harry’s pint. “Come on then, if watching such a miserable film didn’t put him off you, what did?”
“I believe the book was published during a time when alliterative titles were proving rather popular,” Malfoy waved off Harry’s incredulous look. “The point is that prophecies are, essentially, rituals. Rituals that must follow a certain number of steps, in a certain order, to be effective. If our magical cores have changed due to our…” he paused. “Our ability to…”
“Are you interested in M.E.A.T.U.S.?”
“Ginny…” said Blaise.
“You’ve been using that one for decades,” he said, taking the seat next to her and glancing around the box. Narcissa smiled and nodded toward the pitch.
“I’m fine,” said Draco, taking a deep breath. “Just getting my balance.” He pushed off and started pushing through the mud towards the wall.
Harry scowled. There shall be no jam in the vicinity of his body ever. Not on the inside, not on the outside. “I’d rather have a fist in my body than jam on my tits.”
“What is he talking about?” Harry asked Hermione.
“Ah...”
“Hold on a minute—”
“Were those his exact words?”
“Nervy Weasel,” he smirked, relishing the way she huffed at the nickname. “Run out of money and here to beg for scraps?” He nodded towards the stadium merchandise stand, groaning beneath the weight of Quidditch World Cup branded robes, kazoos, posters, and what appeared to be some kind of peaked Muggle hat with two miniature cauldrons attached to each side and a straw leading down to the wearer’s mouth. Momentarily distracted by the hat, Draco missed the Weaslette’s response, tuning back in as she asked;
“Skinny secrets?”
The words followed Draco back to the Slytherin dorms, his mother’s owl forgotten.
“Watch me not care.” Ginny interrupts Percy’s attempt to defend himself. “Anyway, Draco, what’s up?”
As Harry failed to identify the flavours or, alternatively, as he gagged over the terrible ones, Malfoy was getting more and more flustered. In fact, every time Harry licked a dildo, Malfoy’s movements became jerkier and his voice fainter. By the time Harry asked who on earth wanted to lick sunscreen flavoured lube from other people’s bodies, Malfoy’s recurrent
“Hi,” Harry replied, sounding a bit breathless to his own ears. Malfoy’s smile twitched before he turned back to the crowd. There weren’t many people watching, but most of them had stopped after they’d seen Harry climb on stage.
“Alright. Well, here I am.” Harry spread his arms, plastering on a manic smile. “Oi Snape.” He raised his voice. “It’s time for the grand reveal.”
“So…” said Cormac. “Since when are you and Malfoy doing the bang-a-bang?”
“From what I hear that’s more your department,” said Ginny. “Or are you only interested in borrowing brooms?” Her words soured Draco’s mood and he stepped close to her.
“You’re a right twat, you know that?” Ginny snarled, wrenching open the door and staring expectantly at Blaise. Suddenly exhausted, Draco made no attempt to detain her.
*~*~*
“Right,” Harry muttered, almost gagging as he dragged himself to his feet and stumbled along the corridor to the kitchen. Draco was sitting at the kitchen table, reading
The thought of spending a few nights in whatever a ‘Travelodge’ was didn’t exactly sound appealing, she mused as the Third year Hufflepuffs attempted to transform their quills into backscratchers. While the Slytherdor team was bound to be a handful, keeping an eye on fourteen teenagers was nothing for a woman used to patrolling the Hogwarts corridors.
“Oh, I don’t know.” Narcissa’s quiet voice cut through the tension between Malfoy Jnr. and Snr. The three of them were eating breakfast in the third dining room and Narcissa reached for another croissant as she spoke. “Life on the continent sounds rather charming. Or at least, according to Binky Waldorf.” She raised an eyebrow at Lucius, who chuckled and reached forward to take her hand.
“Not as much pain as I am whenever that oafish husband of hers opens his mouth.” Lucius grinned as Narcissa pretended to wrestle her hand free.
“Charms,” said Draco, glaring at them both. “I would have kissed you.” He turned back to Harry.
“I wasn’t planning to.” Potter had stopped smiling, his posture rigid, dark eyebrows drawn together. “What the fuck, Draco. That’s a really shitty question to ask anyone, especially on a date I-” He cut himself off.
the blood in her body. Not that Draco wanted to think about that. He was much more interested in examining the floor of the Inquisitor Squad’s den and trying to remember all of Martin Miggs’ ill-fated sidekicks in reverse order. Intriguingly, Janice looked like she was attempting something similar.
Draco winced again at the memory of Scorpius’ strained reassurances that he “really wouldn’t mind if you wanted to, um, you know, um, meet... someone, a person... you know, for, um... dating, dad.”
“Oh do fuck off Potter.”
“Not today.” Pansy replies, rubbing a towel through her hair. “She called me ‘Pea’ the last time we were here.” The overly casual words drag Draco’s thoughts away from black ink stretched across soft brown skin.
“Someone not wanting to murder me is a pretty low bar for a friendship,” Harry pointed out, lifting three fingers to count down when Draco should jump. “Now!”
“Yessssss, nice one Draco!”
“Very well.” Snape nodded, shifting to allow Malfoy to squeeze past him. The kitchen was too small for them all but, having won what felt like a concession, Harry wasn’t going to suggest moving. Even if that did mean putting up with Malfoy pressing close as he settled awkwardly on the window ledge.
“I just got on a different bus than normal.” Hermione shrugged. “They only had three tracking charms on me. Can you imagine?”
“Well, with Weasley involved in your escapades I can see why that became a habit,” said Malfoy. “However, as neither of us is a complete imbecile would it be possible to skip the First Year Charms class?”
The restaurant was already full, diners packed so tightly together than many of them were sitting back-to-back. Tori Amos had been replaced by Neutral Milk Hotel and the barman was indistinguishable from the customers: buried in his own phone, apparently disinclined to make smalltalk. Or serve drinks. Hovering awkwardly, Draco pretended to be absorbed in the extensive cereal menu painted on the wall above the bar. £8 for a bowl of rice crispies seemed like a lot but Draco had always found Muggle currency a little confusing. Maybe the dish involved a few special ingredients? Possibly shavings of truffle or-
“Oh, um...” Draco blinked.
“Really? Why’s that?” Something about Potter’s easy grin made another wave of heat rush through Draco.
The rest of Lucius’ letter included a comical account of the Dark Lord punishing Wormtail for some misdemeanors by cursing him to stay within 6 feet of the kitchen cat at all times. In rat form. A few weeks prior Draco would have been delighted by Lucius’s description of Wormtail frantically darting and pirouetting around his invisible prison, dodging Mrs Lederhosen’s paws. Now, Draco felt something pressing against his throat, as he tried to imagine what punishment the Dark Lord would devise for a ferret.
“N-no, like rescuing your best friend from almost certain death. Hmm? Do you think that might be on the Auror agenda for today?”
“Right, because involving the appropriate authorities is a terrible idea and definitely something I’m likely to do.”
“Underwear model?” Potter cocked his head. “Hermione told me that Liam was a firefighter, wonder why.”
“She got worried that the fish was hungry,” Potter shuddered. “Took us three trips to St. Mungos before all the rice crispies were scooped out of her ear. I still have both those twins on my shitlist.”
“No can do, Ang,” said Oliver, grinning at Marcus in a most uncaptainly, uninspiring way. “You lot can sort this out yourselves. Although...” He straightened up and glared at the rest of them. “Marcus and I are out if there’s any forced kissing.”
“This cereal is rank,” said Potter, who had started eating again. “Can I try yours?”
“Your turn Draco,” said Mafalda, making rather a performance of spelling away the last of the green smoke as she winked at Harry.
The girl, who couldn’t be more than twenty, inspected her bitten nails. The nail polish on them was mostly chipped off .“Yup,” she replied to Ron. She sounded like she had had to answer this question fifty times that day already.
“Right,” said Draco, swallowing down the pang he felt at how quickly the conversation had gone downhill. “What about when you tried to murder me? Shall we also have a chuckle over that delightful period?”
“Sorry Tonks.” Harry gave her an awkward wave, then reached out to tug Draco back around to face the screen. “Not long now, eh?”
“You’ve never licked jam off my chest,” Harry reminded him, hoping that Malfoy hadn’t confused him with some other bloke he was fucking.
“What are these?” He asked. “Some sort of prophetic pastries?”
Shit.
“Of course.” Draco nodded. “I need to do a few things in town.”
“M’fine, thanks.” Harry tried to return the smile, judging by Draco's confused head tilt, he hadn't done a very good job.
Interestingly, Harry went a bit pink.
Thankfully, Minerva had an ardent supporter in both these ambitions: Rolanda Hooch.
“Oh will you?” Draco was appalled to hear his own voice coming out a little breathless.
“That’s it?” said Draco, staring at Harry. “Was that supposed to be a date? Eating rubbery eggs in my kitchen?”
“What?”
“Yes, I heard you,” he said. “Hermione and Pansy tricked us both into a date with someone called Liam so that we could forge a bond over our inability to choose decent friends.”
Harry had never thought of himself as a particularly sensitive person. He’d survived eight years of the Gryffindor common room, seven years of Neville’s feet, and months in a tent with Hermione’s snoring. If ever there was a man trained to block out external stimuli it was Harry James Potter. But the mugs were A Lot. There were red mugs, yellow mugs, blue mugs, purple mugs, green, black, white, brown, orange, grey, puce, puke, poppy, pumpkin, spotted, striped, glitter and sequin mugs of every shape and size. All this, and on the front of every mug was a hunky witch or wizard, waving at Harry and occasionally rubbing their nipples.
“Holy water.”
“It’s a Muggle word.” Ginny spoke. Honestly, Gryffindors really were the pits when it came to social niceties and discreet lurking. One would think that they-
“Are you even listening to me?”
“Flirted,” Poppy laughed as Minerva shuddered in horror. “Just a little.”
“S’alright mate,” said Ron, looking far too knowing for a ginger wearing lime green robes. “It’s happened before. Most people only hear about time loops so they think that’s what it is and try to work out what they’ve done wrong. Must admit, most aren’t as stubborn-”
“They’re called Sexual Aura Sensing Stoneware,” she said, smiling again and causing her hair to turn Gryffindor red. “They sense whether the drinker is thirsty-” she gave him a long, slow wink, “-and then the picture on the front reflects that, look!” Snatching up a mug, she took a deep swallow. The wizard on the mug loosened his top button, giving Harry a rather smouldering glance but was apparently disinclined to remove more clothes. “Hmm, looks like I’m not in the mood right now,” she shrugged. “Let’s see if we can find one for you!”
“It’s cold. There aren’t any heating charms.” Draco’s voice was muffled as he pulled the hoodie off, revealing a wrinkled grey shirt underneath. “Here.” he thrust the hoodie at Harry.
“Are you sure it was seventeen, Draco?” Harry asked. “And not maybe three or some number that’s easier to repeat?”
Harry’s meditation on the bonds forged in the flames of athletic endeavour was interrupted by the second realisation: Draco Malfoy was sitting on his bed.
“No, I swear.”
Draco was distracted as he looked over the Due Diligence Report from their latest case. Their last case as partners, Harry happily reminded himself. The request to switch partners due to “a personal relationship” was already on Robards desk. All they had to do was cross the ‘i’s and dot the ‘t’s’ – something Harry usually left to Draco – and then they would be free to do all the things Harry had spent the last few months (years, really) dreaming about doing to Draco.
"Of course," Pansy said, tipping her head in a nod. "I couldn't have you waiting on my beck and call, Dimitri."
Harry arched an eyebrow further. "Forgetting?"
As it was, Jackie was waving her textbook in his face so closely that it almost clipped his nose. "Lo-ok," she dragged out. "Isn't it cool?"
He pursed his lips in an attempt to withhold the urge to comment.
"Please tell me you were joking," Harry said as they made their way into the warmth of the lunchroom. The smell of bacon, toast, and coffee, the staples of a hearty meal for the heavy-eyed sixth formers and teachers, hung temptingly in the air. "Please. You're not serious."
"He's been an insufferable git since we started at Hogwarts," Ron had told Harry several weeks before as he'd swung past to pick up Jill. "Bet he didn't tell you even half the stuff he's done."
"Bye, Mum!" he threw over his shoulder as he pulled the door closed behind him. Lily's reply was muffled, but Harry hardly heard it as he skipped the front steps. He was running by the time he reached the gate and hurdled over it in a springing leap.
Draco should have been proud of what he did, for Harry had seen his work. It was, in a word, stunning. How he managed to capture still life in such a unique manner Harry didn't know, but it was impossible not to be more than a little awed. And yet in the single situation that Harry had known him when his childish arrogance would have been warranted, it was absent.
Harry's mother wasn't asleep. From the look of her, Harry didn't think she'd slept in a long time. Smudges of shadow beneath her eyes made her look like she'd had a run-in with a disaster of a makeup artist, and her paleness was so stark that she almost glowed in the dim room. She sat straight backed, hands pinned between her knees, with her unblinking gaze fixed on the floor before her.
Harry huffed. He settled back against the table, propping his hands on the edge. There wasn't much distance between him and Draco, only enough that their knees weren't quite touching, but he was more aware of it in that moment than he'd been in months. "Of course I bloody well am. But I'm not an asshole. You clearly don't want to talk about it."
"I'm working," Draco said, gesturing down at the picture before him.
The rest of the Hogwarts students and their professor had all but disappeared when Jackie began to herd them in the direction of the school canteen. Falling into step alongside a detached Theodore who didn't seem the least bit inclined to converse, Harry settled himself and his concerns to rest with tentative questions to Draco of just what had happened the night before, whether he was really okay, if there was anything he wanted or needed – and, most importantly, whether the offhanded comment he'd dropped at the end of their discussion the previous night was a serious one.
"We've discussed," Picard said, breaking into Draco's thoughts as he fought not to glare at Potter. For some reason, though she looked at Potter, Draco felt her words were directed towards himself. "This correspondence is mutually beneficial. But it is undertaken with the understanding that, should privacy and privileges be infringed upon, the contract declares your safety is to be put first."
"Good, thanks, Harry." She beamed. "Happy New Years."
"Is that your nose?" Draco asked.
Across from him, Draco sat with his own cup, staring blankly at the rising steam though with the blankness of not really seeing it. He slumped back in his seat, deflated and neglecting the poise that Harry had always known him to possess. He was still the same Draco, but it was a version of him that Harry had never seen before. In a way, it was oddly reminiscent of the apartment Harry found himself in.
"Good evening, sir," he said smoothly. "I hope your day has been eventful."
Squeezing Draco's hand again, Harry dropped his cheek onto his shoulder. "I wouldn't have picked it," Harry murmured, quietly enough that he could be ignored if that was what Draco wanted. "She doesn't look much like you."
"And thirdly," Draco said, raising another finger, "whether a magician or a wizard, you can do magic. The title matters little. Will you show me some of your magic?"
The class buzzed at a muted volume around him. The clatter of vials, the shuffle of feet, the murmur of voices, mostly bored and mostly raised in questioning speculation. Elbows propped on the table on either side of his open textbook, cradling his head in a hand, Harry flicked through the pages. He scanned briefly through each ingredient's list and dog-earing those Malfoy's brief mention had deemed relevant. He'd never noticed how many potions contained peppermint essence before.
Planting a kiss on Lily's cheek, Harry started for the door. "Will you be home for dinner?" she called after him.
When Harry muffled a yawn with the back of his hand, Draco's lips twitched. Propping an elbow onto the table, his head onto his knuckles, he extended his free hand and brushed it against the back of Harry's. It felt like the most natural thing in the world for Harry to flip his hand and link their fingers. Perfectly natural.
Harry smothered a private smile for himself. It wasn't any mystery to him, though it was a little strange to think he might be adopting Draco's turn-a-phrase. Draco always did have a particularly proper way of speaking. Maybe it was because he was a pureblood, or from an old family, or a wizard, or maybe all three, but it didn't annoy Harry anywhere near as much as it used to. If anything, he thought it was kind of hot.
James worried too, but more than that, he had the potential to be overprotective. And demanding. And he had a strange tendency to 'assert his dominance as the alpha male' as Sirius jokingly called it at times. Harry hadn't quite considered the accuracy of that description until then.
He was on his feet and out the door in minutes with barely a second paused to recognise the sudden euphoria that swept through him for what it was.
"Remarkably thin."
Harry smiled.
"Jesus, they really are a bunch of bloody poofs," Bruce said, folding his heavy arms across his chest. He jerked a chin at Harry, at Draco, and spat a globule to the floor at his side. "Disgusting. You're infecting them all, Evans."
"Not really."
"That's sensible of you," Draco said absently, taking a sip of his own wine before reaching for the jug for a refill. "I know a lot of people in the industry are partial to substance abuse."
He hadn't realised quite how much that punishment would sting. Ignorance… It was a blow that Draco hadn't appreciated the strength of before it was inflicted.
"Could you just get over it already?" Harry muttered, more to himself than to Jackie and too quiet to be properly heard over the exchange between Jill and the Hogwarts students.
"I would not," Ginny said. Extricating her arm from around Hermione while simultaneously almost crushing Harry's head into her shoulder in a tight squeeze, she stabbed a finger at him. "They'd be totally hot together, and you know it."
"Safe travels, Harry."
Still, he'd bloody-well try. He'd try his best to pretend that he wasn't still walking a tightrope between dissolving into hysterical, flailing terror and sinking into exhausted sleep.
"Yes."
The gate. The back gate. The back of the school always all but empty, the gate always open yet leading to a network of rabbit-warren streets in the opposite direction of the bus shelter, the train station. It was always,
"I don't –"
It was all a show, a performance of too many gestures made more believable and grandiose in the shadows and smoke throughout the room. Harry watched with narrowed eyes for even the slightest hint of real magic, but with the newfound awareness he'd gained, the nudging suggestion of realness that played upon his senses that he hadn't noticed before Draco had enlightened him, remained slumbering and silent.
"Do you have any idea of how long you'll be gone?"
Draco didn't reply. Not until Harry shot him a glance. Then he rolled his eyes, his old snottiness making an appearance once more as Harry hadn't caught a glimpse of since Potions the week before. "I said I was," he grumbled, bottom lip jutting slightly in a little pout.
"She's practically the leading name in Wizarding Tech, you know?" Ron babbled, euphoria adding a slightly manic edge to his words. "She'd incredible. And she's so young too, and all. You know she's the one who built the first television that Hogwarts got its hands on almost single-handedly, right?"
Harry chose that moment to ignore him. Apparently Ginny has decided it was pick-on-Ron-night, which was a welcome reprieve given that, more often than not, he found himself as the target of such teasing. It was nice that Ron would be burdened by it for once rather than partaking.
Draco's face worked in a series of twitches before he managed to smooth it once more. Nodding curtly, he lifted his chin. "Alright, then. Until after Christmas."
