Harry gave him a sidelong look; the professor looked even older and more tired than he’d remembered. He nodded. “It was Voldemort,” he agreed in a harsh voice. “He was the one who threatened her. He was the one who tortured you. Who – “ here his voice broke, and he wasn’t quite sure how to proceed. They hadn’t discussed yet what happened to Draco all those days he was captured, and Harry was not at all sure he’s strong enough to hear.
He was panting breathlessly, the room still spinning unbalanced around him. Malfoy swallowed lightly, and Harry could do nothing but stare at him, eyes wide with shock, heart fluttering faster than ever before. It took a long while until he had enough air to say anything. “Where did you learn to do that?” was all he could bring himself to ask.
Ron’s face was almost as red as his hair. He sent his long arms forward, grabbing handfuls of Malfoy’s robes. “Say that again,” he whispered softly. Harry anxiously looked around to check; Snape had his back to them, leaning low over another group’s cauldron. “Say that one more time to my face, and I will break you.”
“Hermione!” Harry yelped, indignant, but she gave him a little smile that he knew well enough. It was her ‘I-have-a-plan’ smile. There was hardly an expression in the world he preferred. “What did you have in mind?”
Malfoy trembled so badly at the name, it seemed like he might crumble. He looked round and met the green eyes. “He was actually pretty restrained today. I’m sure the Dark Lord has warned him, message only, no games.”
After a while Malfoy sniffled again, and then he let go of Harry’s wrist. Slowly Harry pulled his arm from around his body and took himself backwards so he could look at his face. “It’s going to be alright,” he said stupidly, because he didn’t know what else to say. “Dumbledore’s going to find a solution. He always does. He’s kind of a genius in that sense.”
“Pretty exciting, isn’t it, Harry?” Ernie asked in his usual self-satisfied tone. “Rather different than the Toad’s way of teaching, for sure. A little more like back in the old days of the D.A.”
Potter laughed, and it was again that nice laugh that had Draco close to losing his marbles last night. It was so bizarre to hear it in this kitchen, where Draco was only used to hearing Him. In this flat where mere minutes ago he stopped existing. It was too much to take in. “No, I still do these things on my own. Hell, I don't think anyone's even been in my kitchen in years. I normally go over to Ron and Hermione's, not the other way around.”
He expelled a long sigh, of relief or annoyance, it was hard to determine. “All right. Even.”
“Anything, please, just n-not – Sir – I – please – “
“No, it’s – “
“We'll take it one step at a time. No reason to freak out before we’re even in there.”
Harry didn’t know how the hell he’s supposed to react to that. Of course he was very happy that Draco was able to come back, but – the very thought of him makes Draco sick? That couldn’t be good. “Professor, is there something we can do about it? the nausea thing?”
to go there. You can’t just hop in a Death-Eater den with an ‘excuse me, mind if I just pop by?’, being the number one wanted person in there!” He shook his head in a stunned manner. “The Dark Lord himself could be there! There is absolutely no chance you can go!”
“Very cleverly observed, Potter. I never pegged you for the detective type. I suppose you’d want a medal for that?”
and wondered if he was them, too.
But Potter was so sad.
“Yes, actually.” Malfoy’s eyes traveled around the room again, and he seemed like he was trying to steel himself. “He said he will think about it. So here’s to hoping.” It was a very sad smile he gave Harry as he crossed his arms. “He actually gave me a note from my father. From Azkaban.”
“What? What makes you say that?” Potter’s voice was so hoarse.
“I trust you all will be able to stop me. And if not – “ he drew a deep breath. “I can’t keep going like this. I can’t. I’m sorry.”
“These scars are not what matters, Potter. You want to see proof, but… there's nothing I can show you that will make you understand. Nothing to show how... When I came out of Azkaban I was – broken. Entirely. I thought I'll never get back up again.”
“Master Harry says he is fine, but Master is wrong. Either Master is more foolish than he looks, or he lies. Kreacher wonders which one is it?”
“Are you okay? What do you need? Is – “
Then the yelling got closer as some of the Death Eaters were already gaining on him. He let them get near enough until he heard a very definite shout – “He’s here, we got him, right here!” he looked back; about ten figures running towards him. Good enough.
There was a short pause in which Draco’s blood thumped so hard in his ears, he wasn’t sure he didn’t miss the reply. But then a nod supplied him the approval he needed, and almost fleeing to the bedroom he threw on the heaviest clothes he had and returned to the living room some five minutes later, clad in enough layers to get him through the winter if he lived in the midst of an icy river.
“We will meet when the snows melt. It's code. She was giving me a message.”
Malfoy seemed a little shaken at his outburst, but he didn’t say anything. Instead he used his wand to summon a jar and placed it on the table. “I’ve kept them ever since you said you wanted to practice,” he said in a measured tone. “If you still wish to do that.”
“What do you have in mind?” Harry asked, not without a little bit of concern. He was really quite hot.
They stayed on their knees for minutes, maybe hours, Draco had no idea. It was an entirely novel thing, to have someone so close to him, not berating or hurting him but rather taking some of the horrible fear on their own shoulders, taking a part of the blame. Draco thought he could stay there forever. Potter was strong and still, a mountain of solid support, and Draco thought that if only he could lean on him, he would finally be okay. It was a desolate, hopeless thought, but still there it was. Potter was… too good to be near him. Too good to be doing this. And yet, here he was, and this he was doing. Draco opened his eyes when the wonder was just too great, and found the green pair looking right at him. There was no scorn there, no hate or blame, not even pity. Just warmth, just sympathy, understanding. All the air was squeezed right out of Draco’s chest, and for a second he could hear his heartbeat as if it broke in song. It was elation. It was impossible.
“He had to face a choice, Harry. A difficult, terrible choice, one that none should ever have to make. He begged me to send him to Azkaban, to hurt him enough so he can’t make that choice, but of course, that is not the way these things work. I presented him with his options, but made it clear he had to make a decision. And he did.” A light, pained smile shone on his face momentarily. “He chose you.”
“I’m not doing anything. I don’t have your bracelet, I didn’t – can I touch you? Draco, can I hold you?”
“But…” Harry had looked sad before, now this was just unfair. The whole point was
Draco shook his head, but his annoyance was quickly dying down into pure misery. He was suffocating, and the chains kept him down under the increasing pressure of the water in his stream still rising and rising. He will cave, and the next step after that is the curtain falling, and then he will die. He didn’t want to die. “Please.”
He gently released Draco from his arms, sliding to kneel on the floor between his legs. Draco looked down at him, face wet with tears, scrunched up in question. “I’m sorry,” Harry said in his softest voice possible. “I'm so, so sorry you had to do this. I'm so sorry I wasn’t there for you when you needed me most. Draco, I'm so sorry.”
,” Draco whispered and buried his face in both hands. “Once you know. You will leave. I know you think you can handle anything, but you will leave, and I –“
“No,” Draco was heaving, frantic, “no, I don’t have to listen to you. You’re lying, and I don’t need to – you don’t know what’s happening anymore, you don’t know anything. You’re dead, and you don’t know.”
“And you want to, what… buy it?” Draco asked, tilting his head. The place was a mess; a whole part was torn off the roof, more bricks were missing than were actually on the walls, and the windows were all cracked. It was a hovel. Beautifully located, yes, and a little perfect in a hapless sort of way, but still a hovel.
Then Greyback took a step towards him again, raising his blond head with one long-clawed finger under his chin. “Do remember this, Draco boy. Remember our Lord decided to show you mercy, this time. There's not going to be a next.” Malfoy nodded and shuddered at his touch. Sensing that, the werewolf bent low, and he too kissed either side of Malfoy’s stunned face. He held it for a second longer, a red ember glimmering in his eyes, then bent again and kissed him right on his frozen-shut lips. Malfoy’s eyes went wide with trepidation, and Harry felt every muscle in his body itch. He found himself seconds away from forgetting everything and simply jumping out in attack. Then Greyback released the boy, whose head fell back down immediately, and took Narcissa by the hand. Malfoy looked up just in time to see them disappear behind the trees. He opened his mouth as if to say something, but then shut it back up. He bent his head and looked at the ground for a long, long time.
“I know,” Potter nodded. “It just, again, took some time to figure out.”
“Yes, of course I do. Even in Hogwarts I knew you were brilliant, just… we weren’t ever on the same side. I always thought it was a shame. Well, I mean, later. Back then I just thought you were a prick.” Her smile was somewhat rueful, and Draco felt terrible, because it was his fault they weren’t on the same side then, and that Harry was now shooting daggers at her with his eyes.
“How am I meant to know what’s safe, when I can’t even close my fucking eyes?” he asked, making his voice as venomous as possible. “It’s everywhere I go, it’s everywhere I look. Nowhere is safe.
The last part was practically a whisper, and he had no idea if Potter even heard, but the immediate softening of his tone suggested he did. “Draco, I’m sorry. I really didn’t mean to command you or anything. I’m just not used to being… subtle with my opinions, and you know I’m a little tense with the whole situation. Of course I don’t mean to imprison you here.” He took a strained break before sighing deeply. “If you want to go – fine, I’ll make it happen. But I’m coming with you.”
“No, of course not. He’s nothing but a little coward. There’s nothing he could do anyway.”
“Yes, it does have a bit of a strong effect,” Malfoy laughed and turned to face Harry. “But the best part about it is that it makes you absolutely, utterly smashed. I don’t suppose goody-good Harry Potter ever got drunk before.”
Her mouth was such a tight line. “Oh no, absolutely not. Of course he’d be staying with me.”
“Gone mental? Slughorn?” Draco pictured the plump wizard and frowned. “Why do you think that?”
“You’re not strong enough,” the shadow asked, or maybe declared. Draco glimpsed at it from the corner of his eye. He couldn’t tell if the long hair was exactly the right shade of dark.
“No, I have my practice. How about Friday, then?” Malfoy nodded, and it was set. There was an awkward silence now. Harry suspected that to sit tight and wait was going to be a lot more difficult for Malfoy, especially because he didn’t trust Dumbledore. Or him, Harry had to remind himself. Not that he trusted Malfoy, but still, it was weird for him to be viewed as a possible threat.
“How did you know that – “
“You-Know-Who was the first to disappear,” Ron was kind enough to fill him in. “He must have been the only one who could apparate inside the castle, through the wards, because the other Death Eaters were stuck there. Some of them managed to jump out the windows and the holes in the wall and apparate in the air, but we got some others. Dolohov, Rowle, Avery… about five or six are now on the way to Azkaban. Mulciber is dead.” Harry found that he was automatically relieved that his explosions didn’t kill anybody, and then was mad at himself for feeling that way. He should have no qualms about killing Death Eaters by now.
Hermione grabbed the hand covering his face and removed it gently, looking into his eyes. “Harry, what’s happened between you two?”
sparkled when he looked at him. In that horrible, terrible, awful smile of his that was far too bright for a sloppy person such as he. Draco hated it. Loathed it. Despised it. And also…
Draco laughed. Actually laughed. “Yes, he probably would. Probably try to make it befriend the Blast-Ended-Skrewts. Gods, I hope he doesn’t still keep them. They were an abomination the first time around, but now… the world had seen enough darkness without them.”
about it. Can you please just…” Draco rubbed his eyes. “I wanted you to know because I thought it’d make you feel better. I thought you could maybe be less angry. I know it helped me when… knowing he was dead.”
“You should be careful with that,” the blond gave him a snide look. “You know what happened to the cat that shoved its nose in the wrong cauldron.”
“How – the potion – you –“
Potter took a moment to recover. “Why are you doing this?”
in his gut. It was wrong, but then, the rules did change. They had to. Because now there was Harry Bloody Potter in the way, and Draco had to do something about it if he wanted things to go back to normal.
, and
“I’m not… is that really how you feel? That I’ve used you like that? That all this time you were just – helpless against me – that I forced you into this?”
“What did you do to him?” he whispered instead, because apparently his voice box didn’t get the memo.
“I heard you were quite brave, standing up to him,” Malfoy mumbled. Harry chanced a fleeting look; the grey eyes were now fixated on the rug. “You actually meant to duel him. A fourteen-year-old wizard, against the Dark Lord and his Death Eaters.”
Apparently Weasley and Granger were engaged to be married this spring, and Draco thought it was only about bloody time. They were all but draped around each other ever since they’ve left school, at least from what he read (and although the papers – back when he used to get them – weren’t so full of stories of them as they were of Potter, he was still treated to the odd one at least once a week). He expressed his congratulations and asked for Potter to never, ever pass them on. They were on a light, smiley sort of mood, and Draco was feeling antsy with it.
Draco huffed a painful sigh. “What do you think He will do to the man I’ve actually kissed? Multiple times?”
Potter didn’t laugh, but he didn’t push the matter either. “I don’t think she's got any plans for anytime soon, no. I guess she’s a little cautious of how… you know, people see the three of us around there. She’s constantly on me to keep my head down, not to encourage any special treatment or whatever. She’s worried they’re going to make me Head Auror or something before I’m ready, because everyone still sees me as the Golden Boy.”
it’s been. Every once in a while he stopped and just couldn’t help thinking,
Malfoy gave him an amused look. “I’m fine, Potter, you can calm down. They didn’t beat me up again, although they did remember they have something for me. It was a letter from my dear aunt, reminding me to behave and urging me to speed up. She apparently handed it to them with the hope they can smack some sense into me.”
Of course, it wasn’t entirely like that. There were still rules that demanded following and customs to be kept. Draco made His breakfast (toast and tea being the only things he was allowed to attempt in the kitchen) and waited patiently to be granted permission to eat too. He looked down and said nothing and nodded to anything He said. Still… there was a rumbling, far in the distance, or perhaps only inside his head. Thunder. A storm was coming, and Draco never really liked the weather.
Potter stayed silent for a long minute. “You told me this because I was upset?”
This was impossible; how could he ever make him understand? And more importantly, how could he make him agree? “I – I need this, Harry. I need to be there to make sure. I need to be in control of this situation, or I think it might destroy me.” Hey, that might have actually been somewhat true. Draco looked at him, unrelenting.
“Get up.” When nothing happened, the strong hands grabbed under his armpits and hauled him up. Draco’s feet met the floor again, but he wasn’t sure he was actually standing. “Get the can and come back to the living room. I will be waiting.”
It took a second for startled Potter to react, but when he did it was such a smooth movement, it was almost natural. He just opened his arms and let Draco in, collecting him in an embrace so tight and warm it shut off all the buzzing thoughts in his mind. He held him so tight he’d actually swept Draco a little off the ground, and other than emitting a slight “oh!” of surprise, Draco could do nothing. Would do nothing. Wanted to do nothing. Just to melt onto Potter, to hold on to him with all the strength still in him, to hold like he'd never let go.
“Shut up! Potter, shut up right now!”
“See, I knew that whole ‘I won’t ask for more’ thing was a ruse. What is it now? You want me to quit my dangerous job to become a carrot farmer?”
. Potter nodded.
“No, Potter, what I mean is – have you ever seen a phoenix? Do you think anyone could tackle one to make a potion out of it? It’s ridiculous. Most of the ingredients for it are either extremely rare or legendary. The draught of the living dead is a real potion, though, but I wouldn’t really advise you to drink it. Even made by capable hands it’s still a big risk. You might never actually wake up again.”
“It’s fine, Potter. I mean, receiving sexual favors from people who are in your debt isn’t something completely unheard of. It’s not like I’m wholly unprepared for it or something. I was just – a little taken aback, that’s all.”
Potter laughed and made fast progress on Draco’s plate. “Not nearly enough for all the running around I do, no.” He burped and patted his stomach fondly. “Ah, that’s more like it.”
“Yeah, I was thinking about it. For a summer home or something, I don’t know. It’s just… it’s so calm here, you know? I feel like this could be a good place for me to rest. I think if I could just sit out here in the garden – with a serious heating charm or two and a cup of hot cocoa or something – then I could… I don’t know. Relax. Breathe, really breathe, you know?”
“Undoubtedly. There’s nowhere else for him to go.”
“You should have seen it,” Harry said distractedly, but then he caught on to what he said when his two pals stopped abruptly in the hall and stared at him. He could feel the blood warming his cheeks.
“Do you feel safe?”
“I think he’s trying to say something,” he said lightly, and Draco could only stare at him. “Listening, Grove? I think he’s saying no.”
He helped her load the precious cargo then climbed inside, listening in on Potter’s inane babbling. “Okay, Casanova, we’re out. You can stop that pathetic excuse for flirting now.”
“Hermione let me in, you big oaf. Care to explain why I’ve wasted my gorgeous figure on black clothes for four years, or we do the catching-up later? Are you quite finished being a big baby?”
“Quiet, Draco. On your knees, I will deal with you later. Come, Harry – we have much to discuss.”
“I – there’s more, I can tell you more!”
“But that’s impossible. Why would he be in them?”
Harry scratched his neck, slightly uncomfortable. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
They cleaned together, and it was like nothing Draco had ever done before. It wasn’t like cleaning on his own last week, feeling himself failing harder and harder, and it was definitely not like cleaning with His eyes on him. Potter wasn’t doing it to exercise control, to remind Draco his place or simply to punish him. Instead he did it with him, actually with him, wiping and dusting by hand and throwing the odd spell when he was feeling sneaky. Working silently side by side felt so – so very – Draco had to cut the thought off before he became adulterous in his mind. He could not be thinking so much about Potter. He could not be thinking like
“I… it’s not… there’s no…” words weren’t so reliable recently, and they failed him yet again. Draco thought about trying sign language instead, but he couldn’t come up with anything even near what he wanted to express. The core of it was a pulsating, thrumming
“Yes, Potter. I know.” Draco released a long sigh, feeling his patience wearing. It’s been five minutes of this already. It was getting slightly ridiculous.
“What is it, then? You’re just unable to let someone be miserable on their own? You have to swoop in and fix anything that’s broken? You won't be able to do that here, I’m afraid. I’m a lost cause. Spare yourself the trouble and fucking go.” He was still unbearably angry, so much so that he brought his head up and looked directly at the green eyes. “I don’t want your help. If I didn’t make myself clear enough, let me do so now. I am not interested.”
“Be quiet or I’ll cut your tongue off with this very knife, that’s what!” Malfoy looked pretty close to the edge. Harry’s grin widened. He looked about the room as if searching for something.
“Well, I…” he mumbled, digging in his messy hair. “I don’t really know. I don’t really know what I want from him. Hermione, he’s a
Little beads of comprehension slid down his consciousness, but he was too agitated to string them together. “Of course I do.” Was there even the slightest of doubts?
It worked; there was a little smile on his face when Potter came back. “Nah, you’re good. I’m glad you enjoyed it, though. I’ll get you the lasagna next time, you’ll be absolutely smitten.” Draco felt an excited pang in his stomach. Not because of the food, but because of the promise it came with,
Harry expelled a sigh of relief. “Did you see who was with her?”
Potter’s habit of repetition was straining Draco’s already very frayed nerves. “Yes, all right? I told you because you were angry and hurt and I thought you might not feel as bad if you knew. I wanted to – hell, Potter, you’d already saved my life so many times. I had to give you this back. I had to give you
He bit his lip and worked to keep the sullenness in his voice to the minimum. “So for you it’s been a week
“It’s okay. I’m sorry I tried to kiss you. You did tell me before that you weren’t interested, so I guess I should have listened then.”
He was an absolute fool for listening to that curse of a woman. What was he thinking, going on a walk, on his own? As if he was any sort of good company? As if this was something he wanted more of?
“I know,” Harry smiled, resting his own head on the blond one. “And you love it.”
Potter's voice sounded strained. “I didn’t mean it like that. It’s just that I didn’t want to distract everyone from the…
“Oh, right.” Potter stepped in, unsure but pulling on a brave face. “It’s… well, tomorrow is my mother’s birthday. I was in the area visiting family, and I thought – dunno, I didn’t want to spell flowers for her. I wanted something more… real.”
“You're a nasty little imp, Potter, and you can bugger off for all I care. I'm not telling you anything.” Malfoy was keenly staring at the beetles he was squishing.
Harry couldn’t sleep that night, but it wasn’t for the normal reasons. At least, not entirely due to them. Sirius’s face still showed up as soon as he closed his eyes, but it didn’t remain for as long as usual. Other faces blurred in his mind as always, but he found one in particular that kept returning to center and front stage. A pale, sharp face, with platinum blond hair and silver eyes. He saw the light smirk, and then that damn smile. It made his belly do a strange sort of dance, like it was filled with squirming caterpillars. And then his heart was feeling so much more… Harry paused to think about it. Light. He felt lighter.
He hardly noticed when Theo and Narcissa took over, couldn’t hear them when they spoke to him, could barely see them. He was so, so deep in his own anxiety, he could only breathe in the tiniest little gasps. This was such a huge mistake. Why did he do it? Why did he always have to ruin everything, why did he always have to make the wrong choice, why? The thrum was constant now, a humming sound growing louder, and Draco recognized it, but couldn’t yet place it. Will it feel like it used to, before everything? Back when he kneeled every night and was punished – back when he was
He resumed his walk up. Draco shot Granger a quick glance; she had no choice now but to follow them back upstairs. He tried to read more from her expression, what had they done, where had Bellatrix taken Harry, but got nothing. He thought fast: Weasley was in the drawing room, hopefully with Dobby, ready to go. Granger needs to be removed from their presence at the first chance they get. And then Harry… they had to find him. And once the three are together again, they have to disapparate immediately. If they have any luck at all, Draco could keep his father occupied until then.
“I want to go there as soon as Dobby returns. Just the two of us. No one else.” He sounded sad, yet determined.
“Didn’t see you get any of them, Malfoy,” Neville answered evenly, and Harry swelled with pride. He turned to the blond.
“Yes, I hear they’re
They moved as one unit, spells blasting loud noises and blinding flashes. Neville got his figure no bother, and Draco was running in earnest towards his with Ernie keeping an eye for the others. Harry grinned like a maniac. Draco moved swiftly, gracefully, like he always bloody did, and it was a sight to be seen. That body – now so much better fed, far less brittle, slick and slender in a very appealing manner – made him hot in a way that wasn’t at all to do with the adrenaline rush. He could watch this all day, every day. With a slight effort he took his eyes off of Draco, just in time – “Ernie, watch out, one’s coming right at you!”
After almost 8 months of posting - honestly, after having this fic in my head for most of 2021, we made it to the end. (Please don't look at the wordcount, it's making me dizzy). And just - can I just thank you? god. Thank you so, so much for giving me the opportunity to tell you this story. You can't imagine what it means to me. I loved it dearly, and I’m forever grateful that you joined me on this ride.
. It’s not like malevolence falls solely under Death Eater dominion. We do not have exclusivity on it.”
, Draco reminded himself coolly. Ever since he was a baby, someone was trying to kill him. And Draco was bold enough to call him a coward? To tell him he was acting like a child? To blame him in rejoicing in Draco’s weakness? If he could, Draco would have slapped himself raw. As it were he needed to hold the bed post to remain standing. He was so, so sorry, for everything he said, for everything he thought about Potter in the past few days. Potter didn’t deserve any of it. Even if some was true – could have been true – it didn’t matter. Potter was so brave. Potter was so wonderful. Potter was… before he really knew what he was doing, Draco’s other hand sent to his face, and he brushed wet hair away from his eyes. Potter murmured something in his sleep, but did not stir. Draco found he simply could not take it anymore, and fell to his knees by the bed.
. After breakfast and all his animated talk Potter seemed pretty drained, and Draco suggested he should rest. He sat on a chair Kreacher brought and pretended to read a book, while actually watching him closely. If he was all Potter had, then he had to be alert. For now though he let him sleep and sufficed in watching over him like a hawk, looking for the slightest sign of distress.
That shut Harry up for a heartbeat. “You mean coexist as in, we kill them off like cattle?”
Everything in him stopped still when the doorbell rang. For a moment Draco was scared out of his wits, but then he reconsidered – Potter, it was Potter, he came for him! It was very fortunate he’d been kneeling, and therefore it took him some time to be able to stand; if he hadn’t he would have run to the door and flung it open in a heartbeat. As it were he had to drag himself to the door bit by bit, and that was enough time for the person behind it to speak. Draco’s jaw dropped open and his heart froze over in fear. It wasn’t Potter.
For a moment Draco found himself speechless. This was not going in the direction he expected. Instead of making this a teachable moment, his father gives him a compliment? Before insulting him, naturally, as was his way. What exactly was happening here? He had troubles bringing himself back to the room around him. “I am not going to take Potter by force, Father, as you already know.”
“That’s what you said last week. And the week before it. And the one before. And yet we have not practiced a single time since break.” Malfoy pulled up into a sitting position, looking at him seriously. “You know this is important, Potter. Besides, I wouldn’t be using that word around me unless you were willing to go all the way.”
on the walls and made him wash it – how he made him apologize - how he
That seemed to get the blond’s attention; he raised his head in surprise, almost in shock, eyes zooming between the headmaster and Harry. “What do you mean, Professor?”
“Four more to go!” Neville shouted, and they all regrouped behind a wall covered in posters. Harry took another second to appreciate his surroundings; Professor Electra really did an incredible job with the magic here. Even the air was crisp, everything was so –
Focus! Draco’s inner voice shouted, as already the butter in the pan became dark and ominous. Taking no chances, Draco decided to chuck it and start afresh. So it may take a few attempts before he gets everything right. No big deal, right? Right? He can do this. Hell, he bought a coat for himself, faced the terrifying department store all on his own. He went to the supermarket
have a moment with my mother.”
Oh gods, how he loathed her. “No, that’s not what I… they’re not trying to take it from me. All they ever talk about is how everything’s
“Maybe not. But then I’d just go to Dumbledore, and he would make Snape tell him. And like you're so fond of saying, I'm pretty close to the headmaster, so there's a good chance he will tell me.”
“Oh, damn you, Potter, you and your questions and your options and your fucking free will.” Malfoy looked brittle, like he might fall and break into a million pieces. “She wants to run away,” he added in a shaky voice, finally coming to a halt. “She wants to run away, and we need to fucking help her, Potter. We need Dumbledore.”
“What did you do wrong?” Harry was unable to keep from laughing menacingly. “Are you seriously asking me that?”
. He couldn’t think.
“Just the head and the top of the wings,” Potter waved his hand, though his face was beginning to compete Draco’s for color. It was losing only by a bit, and not for lack of trying.
“Draco, come on. That’s not what I said. I just asked if – “
“I’ll send you a note.” Malfoy cleared his throat and got up. “It’s been… well, as weird as hell, so thanks for that, Potter.” And he left, still smiling that unsure smile. Harry let himself slide down to the carpet and remained there for some long twenty minutes.
The answer to the first question was miles beyond him, so Draco nodded to the second. His head was spinning so fast he was about to throw up again all over Harry’s lap. Gods, Draco had no idea what to think. His entire world just shattered in front of him and he was far, far too broken to deal with all this. What was he to make of it, any damn part of it? What on earth was he supposed to think?
Draco’s head was sore with how much he didn’t like it. “Is there really no other way?”
Potter dawdled in front of the phoenix painting in the hallway, almost like he was about to comment on it, but then moved on. The last room Potter checked was the bathroom, and he came out of it with a grim expression.
“I know what Draco has told you, and I’m aware of what you told Draco. But the person you have been discussing was never, in fact, the
That was unexpected, and Draco frowned. He had to take a moment to adjust to this conversation topic. “Er, no, of course not. Can’t really use a dead man’s name to buy property – and besides it’s not
“No, Draco – I will not leave you here alone with – “
my destiny. I don’t have a destiny. I can choose my own path.”
“Nah, it’s fine. To be honest I’m not very hungry anyway, I just thought I’d humor him. Also, I was a little scared you’d hit me if I said I didn’t want to eat.”
It hurt, gods be damned, it hurt so much. “I won’t be far.” He took the chair and dragged it till he could sit next to him. “See? I’m right here. Now sleep.”
This time both hands were pinning both of Draco’s wrists above his head, so he was unable to push Harry away. His body slammed against Draco’s, crushing him hard into the wall, kissing him like he’s oxygen and Harry was drowning. Draco tilted his head to the side, letting Harry’s tongue explore his mouth more intensely, his own sinking into Harry’s throat nearly. Harry bit his lip hard, making him gasp, then went on to attacking his neck. It was a non-compromising,
“What? What?”
Then, that afternoon, he faced his first test.
Who would have ever, ever imagined.
Draco swallowed an impossible amount of saliva. “Please, Harry. I want to… I want to do this. Please let me see you.”
“You needed my permission,” Potter mumbled, averting his gaze to the carpet. “To get dressed. Because I surprised you and you were only in a towel and you needed to get my permission.”
“No, not so cheerful. Everyone was really on edge all the time, none of us knew what to do. Molly… she was struggling a little, shutting herself off in the kitchen, and I sort of found myself spending a lot of time there with her. I don’t remember if I told you she offered to adopt me?”
and to
“You really don’t have to do that, you know.”
“Potter, we have a problem. Camera number six.”
“If you start doing that, it will all come crashing back to me in the end, and I won’t have it. I told you, I was... a special case. They're going to know it was me. They will know and they will come for me and Merlin, you can't do that. I won't let you do that.”
He can’t tell him the truth. Draco pinched the bridge of his nose, exasperated with himself, frustrated with Harry. “You don’t love me.”
Draco pulled his own hair in frustration. “This. You. I can’t… just stop, please.”
More time passed. Draco was too jittery to actually read, so he flicked through the pages without really paying attention. Then he noticed the edge of another note (another note? His heart wouldn’t be able to take it. It just wouldn’t) sticking out and carefully extracted it from about the middle of the book.
Hate. Hate was something which was both familiar and permitted. Draco was allowed to hate and he knew how to do it remarkably well. He hated Rutgrass and Parker and Field. He hated Grove although he was dead, forever and always. He hated his mother for bringing him into this world, and his father for bringing him into
Draco cried silently into the groove of his neck, and his sobs rocked them both. Harry’s mind was completely blank. The horror of the very idea – Lucius even
“You don’t know what video games are? Right. You’ve not been really living as a Muggle, then. He’s, well… there was this thing he did that sort of preserved his – let’s say life force. So we had to kill all of them first, the little
“I’m sorry,” he mumbled, and his voice caught. He’d never felt more ashamed of himself in his whole entire life. Screaming it all out has finally managed to calm him down, and only in the aftermath could he understand what he’d done. Everything he just said was… Draco watched the smoke curling to the ceiling. He ruined everything. He literally had, with his wand and with his mouth, ruined
“Draco,” he heard the soft grunt in his ear, and everything was falling into place inside him. This was where he belonged… this was what he deserved… he spread his legs even wider apart and pushed down, deeper, deeper, harder… The pain was all he knew, and the arms around him were more necessary than anything. Then He kissed him – slow, real, and for one glorious moment he was there, all there, held and cared for and maybe even understood. But when he closed his eyes he was back in the cell, and the body on top of his entirely different. Draco screamed, but a hand shot to his neck and he became quiet, whimpering slightly on the cold floor… on the warm mat… whimpering and moaning and groaning, faster, faster… It was almost as bad as he remembered, but still it wasn’t enough; he
“Potter…”
A mighty cough rocked Potter’s torso, and Draco held on to him in both hands so he wouldn’t fall. Excruciatingly slow, the deep gashes in Potter’s flesh seemed to shrink, until they supposedly disappeared. It was very hard to tell with all the hardly congealed blood still flowing freely all over his body.
“You know full well why that is,” Harry bit out. He wasn’t in the mood for this verbal back-and-forth between them. “It’s your fucking father and his lot that make me that way.”
Draco fought down a yell, tension raising goosebumps on his skin. They didn’t have the time for this. He couldn’t see the guard anymore; Pansy played the video of the corridor he walked into on a loop, so he had to trust Potter to do his bit right. It was all down to him now. What a fucking joke. Draco cursed his stupid, stupid self and every decision he’s ever made to get him to this miserable position.
“Been practicing, I see,” Harry looked at him appraisingly, and Neville flushed a little.
It was also pretty damn crucial, realizing how little His opinion mattered now. It used to mean the entire world to him. And now… Thomas may always be present in his mind, Draco may never actually get over him, but it was comforting to know the place he occupied was diminishing. That Draco was able to do
“Everything okay?” Harry’s voice asked from the door, and Draco hurried to, fruitlessly, try to hide the papers from him. Not that he was trying to keep it a secret from Harry; he just wanted to be a little more certain about it before he showed him, that's all. Well, too late for that now. He'd already seen.
“You don’t think he’ll do anything to her now, right? I mean, you’ve got your message. He shouldn’t be bothering her.”
Harry took a deep breath. “Malfoy, you’re not a coward. Come on, look at what you just faced for someone you love. You’re the opposite of a coward, really.”
A small huff of irritation in his ear. “Yes, Malfoy, for the eigth time. I have it covered.”
“You alright?”
Now Potter looked so ill it was a wonder he was still sitting upright. “Mark you? That sounds like Voldemort.”
to consider, so much to go over. There was Him. There was how He was – and what Draco did – and Grove being – and the whole entire thing – but going into that loop was too demanding, and he was so tired. Draco avoided it for now. He didn’t know if he’d ever be able to actually open it.
me not to, and I try to respect your wishes even if it
“You won’t touch me,” Draco said, and there was a mighty amount of hesitation in his voice. There was none in Harry’s when he responded.
“I insist on it.” So he will be in trouble – so fucking what? He was already going to be in a world of pain so deep, probably nothing mattered anymore. “Please, it’s the least I can do.” He meant it, too. Keeping Draco’s secret was not supposed to be Potter’s burden. And on top of that… he couldn’t shake the feeling of imminent danger.
“That was such a Slytherin thing to say. It figures that you’d be good at hiding and lying all around. Do they have special courses to teach you these things in Slytherin?”
Draco looked around. There were swords and axes, bows and arrows and an array of nasty-looking sharp instruments that glinted in silver on the walls all around them. It was a rather large room, torch-lit and bare stone walls, only decorated by the obviously very old weaponry. A large flat rock stood in the middle, perhaps a place on which to sharpen a sword, or to pummel an enemy. Its cracks were seeped with a maroon substance which made him shudder uncontrollably. There were no windows and no door but the one from which they entered and which Lucius bewitched shut. It was a terrible place. Draco could
“You smell so good, it’s a sin,” the devil breathed into his neck, pressing his full body onto Draco’s. They shouldn’t be doing this. But even angels had to fall – Draco took in his scent, smoky and slightly ashy and wonderful. His red leather trousers caught the light dusting of hair on Draco’s naked shins, and the feeling was uncomfortable and brilliant at the same time, to be pinned under him, to be this close. Heaven couldn’t feel so good. Nothing ever would.
Not that he liked flowers. He hated flowers. But these were all his flowers, and they were dead, and besides for shocking it also sort of broke his heart. Not to mention his father wasn’t there, which was probably even worse. Harry sat up next to him, mumbling inaudibly. “Draco? Are you all right?”
Frowning, he followed the path made by the stream. There was something in the water, glimmering and dangerous under the surface, and Draco did not want to know what it was. A deep sense of apprehension stole over him – he knew this place. Squinting his eyes he tried to focus, but nothing could be seen behind the fog. Oh well. He kept walking.
“Doesn’t matter. It only matters that you did it then. God, I hope you’ll never have to do anything like it again.” Harry chewed on his lip a little. He looked very much like he wanted to say something, but the thought gave him heartburn. “By the way, why
Draco looked at him. “I do know.” He bit his lower lip, struggling to summon the courage. “I can’t promise you that I’d be able to talk about it all, but I can give it a try. I suppose there is nothing to lose here.”
Draco that, to love him, to take care of him? And promises were very important to Him.
“Please. Draco, please don’t do this.”
“And who said that this one was on you?” Draco added. Potter scowled.
“I do believe Harry has, to a certain level, saved you,” Dumbledore said, not unkindly. “In the same measure that you, in turn, saved him. Other than the bells, what else do you remember?”
“Actually, now that it’s come up, I’ve… er… been meaning to give you something. I wanted to give it to you that Saturday, but then, well, you know what happened.” Potter’s cheeks matched the color of his jumper, that terrible Gryffindor one he loved to wear. He fussed with something on the nightstand for a minute, then handed Draco a rectangular little box, grey and black. It had a small square, shiny like that screen people watch Muggle Quidditch on, and bellow it many little buttons with numbers on them. Potter handed it to Draco as if he’s supposed to know what the hell it meant.
Draco tried to gather the little he had known. Wasn’t there a study where they separated the subjects to jailors and inmates, and had them trying to decimate each other for information or something of the like – where poor Muggles
“Harry, please.”
“Suicide attempts?” Harry gasped. Malfoy seemed furious with himself.
“Well, maybe we need to fuck you first, like he did,” she smiled sweetly. Draco could only gape. “What, no witty comeback? No snarly input? You do surprise me, nephew. Surely you’re not so innocent? You
Potter made a choked sound, maybe tried to say something more, then gave the effort up entirely. The next second they were up in the air, the wind was a fucking pain, and Draco was happy enough to melt.
Harry’s heart was five times its weight, and it was pulling him down hard. He knew very little about blood magic, but the pallor on his friends’ faces was unsettling. “What happened to her?”
He knew he should feel embarrassed, but there was only pleasant warmth inside him. “No,” he answered simply with a light smile. “You?”
“It’s not – it’s as far from over as can be. Will you please just stop being ridiculous for a second?” exasperation made his tongue move without his consent. “You have to listen to me. Whatever it is I told you of Him, I never told you exactly how – He’s powerful, Harry. Very, very powerful. Probably the most powerful wizard I’ve seen, and I’ve been around a few who were dubbed as pretty damn strong. If you thought the Dark Lord was a bit of a handful – what, you don’t believe me?” Harry developed this half-smirk on his face which was frankly distracting.
“Malfoy, are you alright? What’s happened?”
“No,” Draco looked everywhere, frantic, “no, no, it can’t – I need it, I need it with me at all times – please,
“Show me?” Draco asked, unable not to sound a little guarded.
straight anymore, pun probably intended, and he just fell for it. Like an idiot. Wearing eyeliner, too, because that didn’t take a full hour to apply. It was too hot in this damned club, and the house specialty didn’t even taste like liquid, let alone a drink, and he was just so done. The music was blaring, something about rocks? Rocking people? Was it a threat? Draco closed his eyes and wished he were home, wherever the fuck that was nowadays.
He took a deep breath and turned his back to Harry. “Will you come with me?”
“Yeah, sorry. I just – had a rough landing.”
They ate in a far more relaxed ambience than Draco thought possible, especially after his dramatic debacle, and it was almost perfect. Potter insisted on eating as much of Draco’s terrible chicken as he could, munching around the edges and avoiding the dangerously-pink parts in the middle, but definitely making an effort. He even called it ‘delicious’ in such a warm tone, and his eyes gleamed so fucking brightly, that Draco had no choice but to smile. There was plenty to eat even without his horrendous cuisine; Potter bought enough pakoras to last an army a week, and the wine he brought (Draco chose red because he couldn’t quite forgive white wine yet) was terrific and it made everything spin pleasantly. The eclairs were heavenly, and… Draco adored it. Every minute of it. Every crease in Potter’s cheeks when his smile stretched for miles around. Every flicker of the candle Potter lit to make it, and that’s a direct quote, ‘just like a fancy restaurant’. Every time his hand came close to Draco’s on the table and just stayed there, warm, solid, inviting. It was all just so fucking perfect.
, it was like all those feeling Harry was trying to suppress were let loose. He couldn’t help but marvel at him, his beautiful smile, that God damned cute arse. It was unbelievable, really, how much he was able to bottle down. He was now completely overwhelmed by his emotions, so much so that he couldn’t even register them. They just kind of floated warmly in the pit of his stomach and made everything a little fuzzy and sweet.
At some point Draco felt himself dragged out of the cage and brought up to standing. He wobbled a little on his feet, but did his best to remain upright; this was a matter of honor as well. He did not want to portray a picture of a weak, frightened Harry. He owed it to him to be brave right now.
“Yeah, loads. Dudley had way too many books, some of them were downright stupid, but some were good. So I’d read and read and other than those books, I really didn’t have much. It sounds a little sad but in a way, the books were my only friends.”
fact he betrayed Him – he’d been unfaithful in his mind, which was bad enough, but a kiss was so, so much worse, even than a hug, than a random touch. Then the also expected disgust and fear that physical contact always left in his skin, even if he was to blame for this one. Blame, yes, that was another powerful reason. Or did he already mention that? Draco frowned on his rug and kept adding to the list. Potter’s reaction to the kiss – both reactions, actually, first jumping into it passionately and then backing out of it in the speed of sound – was upsetting. He
Everyone stayed for dinner, because that’s how it worked around here, and Teddy was over the moon. Draco wondered if he got to spend much time around so many people. He could understand how it would affect someone who wasn’t used to it, although his first instinct wasn’t overwhelming joy, exactly.
Draco, and he bloody kneeled on the floor with him, so… his debt gathered at the base of his throat and for a second he was choked by it, almost out of breath. His fingers were properly shaking when he undid the button of his jeans.
“Tea. Would you like some? I’m too tired to fight with you. Let me just... make some tea and I’ll tell you the bloody story you’re anxiously waiting for.”
The rays of sun on the grass shifted, illuminating sometimes this flowerbed, sometimes that. Draco followed it in his gaze for a while. “Because I can’t put it behind me.” His voice broke halfway through. “I just can’t forget it, no matter how I try. I think – I think you’d always be with me. What you did, at least, will always be there. I can’t seem to let it go.”
“And if I said I wanted him dead?”
“He found me,” Draco whispered back. “He, the – the man I – He saw me sprawled all over the floor. He healed me, I have no idea how, must have been some pretty advanced magic. He was furious, but said He understood. That after what I’d been through, it made sense that I needed to have some control over my own life. So… He gave me this instead.” Draco rattled the bracelet and it made its soothing jingle. “So I always had a choice. Even if in nothing else – at least in this.”
“What difference would it make?” Harry sighed. “You already have all of me, Draco. Did you think that’d stop at my wand? Don’t be a twat. It works well for you, and if you wanted, it’s yours to keep. But Narcissa and I went to see Ollivander, and he obviously remembered your last wand, and… well. It wasn’t as simple as that, he looked at her wand too, said how it still carried some of your magic. After we talked for hours
Only he had to think about what he’d actually said, too. He thought and thought and thought about it, looked within himself to see what it meant to him, but in the end… he shrugged. It didn’t mean anything much. After everything he’d learned – after
He huffed and looked around the now empty shop. Flowers of every possible color filled his view, and all the scents mixed in the air tickled his throat and made him cough. He'd been working in a flower shop for nearly three years now, and was certain he’s become quite allergic. Not to mention he
“What connection?” Draco asked, but it was mostly because his brain stopped working. Of course he knew what connection Harry meant. What with Him knowing
Draco had every intention of telling him no in a very colorful way. He wanted to explain to him in detail just where he could shove those scissors. Then he thought about the empty flat, the long evening of self-loathing that awaited him, and quickly changed his mind. Even suffering this tosser’s company will not be as bad as being alone. True that up until now, Potter has managed to bring forth some of the worst panic attacks Draco has ever experienced, but still he was a living, breathing human being and Draco was desperate. A real person. Looking at him.
when applied to a human object. It was only in prison that it sort of came together for me – when I understood what it meant to want to consume someone entirely, to own them.” Well, in prison and then some, but there was no reason for him to have to share that, was there now?
“And what, if I may ask, spurred this sudden change?” the fire glimmered in his grey eyes, yet they remained quite blank. His father was always so good at detachment.
What he was is an idiot, but he appreciated the gesture nonetheless. “You should get some sleep, Mother. It was a long night. I’m sorry.”
and I love it.”
“I… guess? Yes, I think I am.” But what did that mean? In the greater scheme of things, in the realms of
Harry couldn’t exactly speak, so he made a non-committal ‘nmph’ sound. Draco nodded and he gave it his all and just pushed.
The bastard took him by complete surprise. Draco’s carefully crafted answer (if by carefully crafted one could mean ‘half-arsed and incredibly inadequate’) was taken right out of his lips. He expected Potter to be angry. He thought he’d yell, curse, demand an explanation. An apology? He didn’t see that one coming in a million years.
“You know I don’t hate you.”
“It’s not even just that. It’s not like it’s all so far in the past – I’ve… you have no idea, Harry. You don’t even know what I’ve done to
… Something bad was about to happen to Potter, and it was very real and very serious. Something bad was about to happen to him unless Draco makes sure he never, ever returns.
Now it was getting a little difficult to swallow. He took his hand off him immediately and shoved it in his lap. “Sorry,” he nearly whispered, and Malfoy gave a tiny shiver. “I didn’t mean to – “ but he really didn’t know how to finish this sentence, so he shut up instead.
He was so tired.
“Take you back where?”
“I see you tried to cook something?” he asked, and Draco felt two red spots of heat blossom on his cheeks. This day would just never bloody end. He practically ran into the kitchen after him, but Potter didn’t look like he was mocking him. There was a smile on his face, but not a bad one.
Potter's eyes were so sad. “Look, I get that you're scared. But I'm sure there are ways to do it that won't lead back to you, and we don't - I mean, we don't have to do anything you don't want to. I just... please, let me do
“No – not at all. I came so I won’t have to. I do not plan to let him kill you. I want to help you.”
Malfoy shrugged and mumbled something under his breath. Then he looked at Harry again. “You know what, Potter, I think that if you were going to attack me, you would have done so by now. So if you don’t mind,” he said and deftly got out of the chair. Harry was so shocked by his realization, that the boy was already at the door when he remembered.
He must have sensed his incredulity. “I mean it, really I do. I know a lot of shit's happened to you and that you’ve had to endure… a lot. But I won’t let it happen again. Not in Azkaban, not from Voldemort, not from anyone. I’ll be there. Whatever it is, whatever you need, know you can call me.”
. What Draco did, the way he spoke to Him, it was truly insane. In that case – what on earth was happening? Draco opened his eyes, which was apparently something he could do. For a moment he worried that meant he was awake, but what he saw then assured him he was still dreaming. His lips were bleeding slightly as they formed a tiny, broken smile; he probably chewed them so hard they burst open. It didn’t matter, since he was still clearly dreaming, and Harry was there.
“But you don’t tell me,” Harry’s method of reproach was all backwards, far too soft. “Why didn’t you tell me?”
“You are not? But – why is Mr. Draco not in contact with Mr. Malfoy?” he seemed confused again. “Mrs. Malfoy will be worried, if they is not speaking?”
“You are everywhere I go. You were running out after me, just now. Spill it already, Malfoy. What’s your big plan here? Bother me to death?”
exist, and yes, he did care for him. The realization – both that he was there, really there, and that he gave a rat’s arse about Draco – was almost too much to bear, and it took considerable effort not to fall into his arms. Not that Draco wanted to touch him – he never wanted to touch anyone again – but he was so, so relieved, and so, so grateful. Potter must have seen the tumult in him, for his eyes burned soft green flames.
The look in his eyes made it unnecessary for him to say any more. Draco shuddered. “No, of course not. I don’t think he was human enough by then to have any sort of
Startled he raised his gaze back to Potter, who was looking back at him like he had something to say, and Draco suddenly realized he must not let him do so or something truly awful will happen.
“Draco…”
“You’ve come to see – but surely that can’t be it, Draco? and bringing strangers in, too?” She sounded somewhere between perplexed and enraged. Hermione gave a little squeak.
“Brilliant. Come on, then, before the old bat comes staring at us.” He started nearly running, and Malfoy ran after him, swearing and laughing. They got to the tower completely out of breath, laughing their socks off, and collapsed onto the sofas in front of the merry fire. Only when they arrived Harry realized he was actually pretty warm.
Draco steeled himself, took a step forward, two steps back, another one forward, one to the side to throw up quietly on the floor, another step forward and stopped at the threshold. He spotted him immediately, and his heart went mad; the sight of the man sent shockwaves up and down his body like Muggle electriticy. Grove was sat behind a wide desk, handcuffed to it, wearing the uniform Draco had donned for two years. He looked unnaturally pale, even considering Draco didn’t really know him in this body. There was nothing else in the small, suffocating room to focus on, nothing but two chairs on the other side of the desk and a ball of floating light. Draco looked solely at it for a second, uncertain. He could still walk out. He could still walk away and never have to do this, never have to face him. He could walk away and leave Harry alone, walk away and let Grove win. He grimaced and took a seat before he got the chance to think it over.
“I think you will do what I want regardless of that,” He smiled. “I’m afraid you’ve shown your hand far too early. About… oh, I don’t know. A good couple of months ago, perhaps. You see, Harry, I am not my father. I am not oblivious to things such as emotions. He had known, of course, what a phenomenal martyr you are – knew all about your admirable hero complex – but he couldn’t have guessed how far you would go for someone you actually loved, having never felt that way for anyone. But I am different, improved. I have loved. I do love. Deeper than you can ever know, you with your simple heart. What Draco means to me cannot be fathomed by the likes of you.”
Definite screaming now; was he hearing them from inside the building? “So you – you let me think you were risking your life, that you were planning to fight Him all alone, when – there were magically able Aurors standing outside the building the whole time?”
“Heard it before, I think. Now come on, give me what I want, or I won’t have any choice but to threaten you again.” His smile was absolutely diabolical. Malfoy glared at him, furious, then rolled his eyes and let out a heavy sigh.
There was so much in that fragmented speech he could not deal with, and probably will never be able to. The whole night felt like a blurry, over the top fever-dream. Draco shook his head and tried to bring himself back to reality, because danger was right here and
On the other side of the world and right beside his knee Harry took a deep breath, looking every bit like he wanted to move closer, but remained still. “You know, actually, it was Hermione who told me that.”
“Ran?”
“I was. I woke up.” There was something building in his chest, a weird sort of pressure that would quickly liquify into sobs if he wasn’t careful. The stress must have been evident on his face, for a large hand cupped it and the other began stroking his hair. For some reason, this expression of affection only worsened the effect, and now Draco was dangerously close to breaking. Too close... he couldn’t stand it anymore, simply couldn’t. “Sir, please…”
There was a lot after that, Draco was sort of lost in the proceedings. More and more guests arrived, which he was absolutely petrified about, but it never got as bad as he’d expected: no one addressed him directly (he had a rising suspicion Harry or the others had warned the entire guestlist to be cautious around him, which was all kinds of fucked up, but he didn’t complain), and they were able to go through the afternoon without any major panic attacks.
Harry couldn’t help but smile. “Bit by bit I will win you over, you’ll see. In the end you won’t be able to stay away from me for a minute.”
Draco was a little confused. He upset Potter, and Potter was asking for
(See the end of the chapter for
“Harry, please.”
And the world collapsed on itself and nothing was ever right ever again.
but not by him, not yet. Maybe this dream was a way to right this wrong.
“Sorry, yes. I’m Draco. Potter, this is Daniel, a customer. And this must be – “
Potter seemed to understand why his tone dropped. “It’s trapped?”
Oh, fucking hell, Merlin and everyone, anyone. He was feeling
A yelp from the boy next to him woke him out of his reverie. “What? What is it?”
“And you shall, very soon, if you do not take some immediate actions. Draco, he intends to kill you.”
Harry felt his face burning. “I didn’t put him in prison. Like you said, I hardly even fought him. I just –“ But Malfoy raised his hand, and Harry hastened to shut up. The blond didn’t even seem so mad.
“I’m afraid the time for that has passed,” Lucius shrugged coldly. He took a step closer, and Draco’s heart was about to break his ribs in its attempt to escape. “I truly am sorry you forced me to do this, boy. Truly. And may I just add that you deserve to bear the shame for this until your very last breath, however soon that may be.”
“I didn’t want to, it was just…” more flashes, and this time Draco imagined he can hear screams too. He found himself shaking and grabbed a bed-post for balance. “I – the most important thing was to keep you safe, right? So I had to lie a little. It was just, well, I didn’t know the extent of the… bond between you and your boyfriend. I thought that if he knows everything you think, and I told you about Aurors being there – “
Potter scuffed the carpet with his shoe. “Jesus, Malfoy, calm down. You don’t have to be so bloody dramatic about this.”
“And what the fuck does that mean?” Draco asked wearily. “I haven’t been him in so long, I don’t even know who he is anymore. I don’t remember his life. I don’t remember his dreams. I hardly remember how it felt to be him. Everything he was, I lost. Everything he had, I lost. Draco Malfoy doesn’t exist anymore, Potter.”
He just wasn’t getting it, couldn’t get it, wouldn’t get it. Harry could explain laws and legality for three weeks straight, still Draco won’t understand
“I basically have him feeding off the palm of my hand, sir.”
The parts of his skin that hadn’t melted off were tingling with the residues of the multiple curses set on his body. Draco tried to think of something, anything that wasn’t the blinding pain, but it was far too strong to allow anything else to cross his mind. Everything hurt; his legs were crushed into powder, his arms smashed into paste; his abdomen burned with sharp pain that made every breath so difficult. His head was constantly exploding at very small intervals, revealing spinning supernovas shattering into dust. His eyes, now opened, could no longer be closed, and were stinging and tearing up all the time. And his heart… if someone had taken it out of his body by sheer physical force, trod on it, brought a whole company of trolls to play hop-scotch on its ruins, dipped it in magma and very carelessly shoved it back into his chest, he would not have been surprised. It felt like that, only worse. He could not even tell himself how bad he was feeling, because his mind was tight and foggy. Not having words to describe the pain did nothing to diminish it. It was a tough, tough task to take each breath as it came.
Fuck squared. Draco understood very little of this confuddled speech, but what he did get made zero sense. “You can’t possibly mean all that.”
But no, no, it couldn’t be. There were ample reasons why it was simply impossible. It didn’t make sense on any level; if He wanted to kill Potter, He would have made His move long ago. Instead of leaving and changing everything, He’d have just got rid of him then and there. The fact He didn’t proves it wasn’t Him, right? Moreover, if it really was Him who attacked Potter, there was no way he'd still be alive – He was just that strong a wizard. Far too strong to
“Oh, er, here in London. Not too far away, really. Grimmauld Place, it belonged to my godfather. He left it to me.”
“Draco. You’re… in my bed.”
So in any case, Potter. Draco had no idea how he was meant to even find him, and when he did, to convince him he was telling the truth. Potter will never trust him if he thinks he lied about Azkaban, and He said to gain Potter’s trust. But how? Draco could not very well go to Diagon Alley to try and find Potter. No reason to start poking around looking for trouble, and trouble was a sure thing if he was to suddenly pop back in the wizarding world, where he was typically considered to be pushing up daisies. Trouble that was very, er, troubling. And if there was one thing Draco was completely certain about – beyond any other thing in the world, beyond even Him– the one thing he knew with absolute conviction was this: he will not go back to Azkaban alive.
“You can’t deny you have an unlikely connection. I want to see if I understand exactly what it means, though. You mentioned before that your boyfriend could… tell how you felt?”
“Avada Kedavra. He was found on some deserted alleyway – we tried for weeks to find out who he was, why it happened, but the only thing that was left in his wallet was this picture, no ID, nothing. At first this idiot in my office said it was a mugging because his wallet had been emptied, but what wizard in their right mind would kill a Muggle for his money when you could just as easily Stupefy them? It never made much sense to me. That was the first murder in a – Draco, are you all right?”
Lucius.
“No, I should think not. If he
Potter laughed. “I’m… yeah, fine. I’m great, actually.” Draco could feel the waves of his laughter on his face, and it made him shiver with need.
But thinking about it wasn’t helping, so Draco took to pacing instead. Having spent the majority of the past fortnight not on his knees, Draco’s abused joints were in much better shape, and he hardly even limped. That’s a good thing, right? Here was something he could think about. Improvement. The path to… something decent or other. After all he was pretty much Potter’s now (because
“Right, it isn’t.” Draco shook his head. “Shall I kiss you again, then, and we’ll see how long you avoid me this time?”
“This is my fault, actually,” Snape cut her off curtly. “I needed the room for my inspection. It is perhaps better that she stays with us for now, Bellatrix. We all need to be present if the boy is really here.”
Come on, it's the holidays. Just a short little chapter filled with sweetness.
“I don’t know. I’m so out of my mind with worry, it’s hard to feel anything. It’s just so surreal, thinking that she'll be there tonight. And with him.” He swallowed nervously. “I guess I should be grateful it’s only him and not the Dark Lord that's coming to check up on me.” He lowered his glance to the fire, musing for a second, then back up to Harry. “Are you ready? Let’s go. Snape’s been meant to leave the front door open for us, and we shouldn’t meet anyone on our way.” nevertheless, Harry covered the them both in the cloak as they made their way downstairs quietly. It was really quite alarming, how natural it felt to be walking alone at night with Malfoy. Sure, he’s spent many nights under this cloak with Ron and Hermione, so walking in the deserted corridors wouldn’t have bothered him anyway. But to be able to do it so easily with Malfoy of all people… that was just peculiar. They walked quickly, and soon they got to the main door, which indeed was unlocked. Bracing himself, Harry pushed it slowly, and then they were out.
Harry made a small, impatient sound. “How? Do you think your being there would make the situation
“Hey there. Sorry if I was a little – I couldn’t really stop myself, the day just wouldn’t end. I couldn’t… couldn’t wait to get back.”
Harry wasn’t aware of his strife. “All right then. Let’s hear it, we don’t have all day. What’ve you got?”
“Come again?”
Potter gasped. If his mouth opened a fraction more, a fishbowl would fit in there nicely.
, his mind quipped, and Draco wanted to slap himself to shut up, but his wrists were chained behind his back. Ah. He hadn’t noticed that before. Shackles – his ankles were attached to the wall behind him, and his wrists must have been fixed to some pole, because when he moved his shoulders he could hear the chain rattle against something metallic. Draco looked down at his body now. There was barely an inch of white skin there; every piece of him was bruised, burnt, torn open, or simply missing. There was a gaping hole in his hip where Greyback scraped a chunk of his flesh with his nails, and it was still bleeding profusely. His ankle was sprained, and both legs had fractures: his right shin was protruding from his flesh in a maddening white, and his left was twisted very awkwardly. Damn it, he shouldn’t have looked; now that he had, the pain only became that much worse. The feeling of a burning colony of rabid fire ants in his legs nearly drove him off the edge, and he was this close to passing out again. No. He needed to use this time he was alone, he needed to stay present, and he needed to find a bloody way out of here.
Draco did know. He knew exactly what Potter was trying to say, and it wasn't at all stupid. Draco asked him to be vulnerable, and he was. He opened up to him and shared this, something private, something real. Something that by the way he sounded, he never told anyone before.
like you care how much you’re hurting yourself.
Draco exhaled the deepest sigh of his life. Fucking Potter. He rubbed his cold cheeks in his hands for a moment. “Fine. You can come to the flat and see for yourself.”
” he pointed his wand at the sitting figure, who jerked awake with a muffled grunt. His mouth was gagged and Draco felt his own heart sinking inside him, lower, lower, lower… “All right, boy, we’re ready now. Get on all fours. Come on, we don’t have all night. Well, we do, but there’s many things I’d like to get done.”

“No, you – you – “ but Harry was having none of it; he pulled Draco into his arms, and the proximity and his touch stole the breath from him immediately.
“Merlin’s balls, Ron, shut up! I’m not in – I wouldn’t say that – for fuck’s sake, do you even want to hear what I have to say, or do you just want to sit there and take the piss all day long?”
“’I am delighted to be able to take part in one of the Ministry’s most advanced endeavors yet. Together with the Department of Magical Relations’ – hey, that’s where Hermione works! – ‘I do believe we can really make a difference. Ask me about my parent’s reaction to it one more time, Roberts, and I will asphyxiate you with this hair tie.’ Wow, wouldn’t want to run into her in a dark alleyway. She's one scary lady.”
Oh, right. He would give him it all –
Harry scoffed, but then sobered quickly. “Wait, Draco, stop. We were talking about something else. something serious.”
This was intended as a first part of a series, so it is likely that part two will appear at some point... It may take some time, though, as I think I need to concentrate on something a tiny bit less heavy for a while! But in the immortal words of Arnie, I'll be back. I hope.
“Nothing, and I’m not, it’s just really hot in here. Shut up about that already.” Harry stretched his legs, feeling weirdly uncomfortable. “God, it really is hot in here.” He was becoming aware of the fact his body seemed to want to get closer to Malfoy. He fought it hard.
Potter melted even more. Then he shook his head, still smiling. “All right, then, what are we waiting for? Time to go get our stuff! The pastries will not wait forever!”
The thought hurt, just as much as it always did, the old wound opening and bleeding inside him. He couldn’t possibly go through it again, losing her once more. In Azkaban he had to let her go to try and keep some of his sanity. Then outside he had to let her go because there was simply no way to reach her. Then with Him he had to let her go to make sure she was safe. And now – he would not stand a fourth time, he simply couldn’t. It would be the last thing he ever did, and he didn’t want to die. He didn’t want to die. Draco didn’t even notice Harry was touching him for a long while.
Then the door opened – then there
“You are,” Draco offered apologetically. “A huge, at times awkward prat.”
“Merlin almighty, I can’t say it again – “
“We could go together,” Harry said, probably joking. “Do one big group session. Would be kind of neat.”
“How could you? How could perfect Potter ever understand?” Draco was horrified that his voice came out all angry, but Potter didn’t even react to it.
“I am all right,” he lied through his teeth, and Potter didn’t even dignify that with a response. “Potter, I’m fine. It’s not been – easy – but it’s all right. I’m getting past it, I think. It’s getting better.”

“What are you doing, Narcissa? You shouldn’t be here. He will arrive shortly – “
moment of your life.”
“Yes, but that was then. That was then, and so much has happened since, it – “
Draco shook his head. “When has that ever happened? It’ll all be okay. Go.” It took about five more minutes, but in the end he really did go. Draco sat himself down in the library a little stiffly and picked up the potions book he left there. Right. He will read a little, then make himself dinner (because he promised Harry, and he’d disappointed him enough for a lifetime, he reckoned) and by the time he’d be done with all that, Harry would be back. Solid plan. Very good. His fingers had some trouble flipping the pages till he got to where he was last, and with a sigh he dove in.
A sharp snort nearly made Draco lose his balance. “Yeah, I heard what you told them. I meant to ask what’s
It took two days for Harry to be able to stand without support, but even after that he didn’t leave the infirmary for a minute. He would not listen to Hermione and Ron’s desperate pleas for him to sleep in his own bed, to eat at the Great Hall, to bloody shower in his own room. He just didn’t care about any of these things. Every minute of every day he spent by Draco’s side, occasionally getting up to check on Narcissa, even more rarely doing some homework. He had no space in his mind for class. He had no space for anything but the boy on the hospital cot, who didn’t wake up even a full week later. Harry was worried out of his bloody mind. Madam Pomfrey and Dumbledore kept saying Draco was okay, that he will make a full recovery, but then why hasn’t he yet? Even Narcissa was beginning to show some signs of life. She was still incredibly weak, and hardly conscious, but still at times she was. Harry sat by Draco’s bed, holding his hand, waiting. On several occasions he thought he would die there if he had to, but he tried not to be so morose. No one had to die now. They can just… maybe they can just heal.
“Focus on my touch, Potter. Focus on the warmth of my hands. Think of nothing else.”
“Are you single, love?” It was so bold a question, Draco gaped in shock. Delilah gave him a wheedling look. “My daughter is twenty-six years old. She’s a very beautiful girl, isn’t she, Mags?”
They decided to take shifts, to sit with him and observe his reactions, two at a time. It definitely warmed his heart to see them, stepping up for him, caring enough to do this. It was very uncomfortable at the same time, and equal measures terrifying, and – well, there were just a lot of emotions in him right now, and actually, he couldn’t focus on any of them. He was too nervous about the bond. How would it feel without the potions, which he should have taken – Draco looked at the clock on the wall – three hours ago? What will happen to him? (
“Please,” Malfoy said, desperate. “Please, I'm doing the best I can. I just need more time.”
. But then that pull in his abdomen would remind him this was all just temporary. That this was not his place, and that it never could be. Sometimes Potter would give him this look, like Draco was something very precious that he wanted to keep close, and Draco would just want to die, because it couldn’t be for him. Not if Potter really knew him, like He did. If Potter knew who he really was –
gods be damned, like a fucking child. Granger was good, yes, but she had no reason to lie to him. Not about this, not about someone she cared so much about. If she said Harry needs him – but – and it was unfair, and not right, and so badly misplaced, but if Harry still needed him…
“I know, Malfoy, I understand. I never – I’m sorry. I can’t imagine how you must be feeling.”
“No, Harry – don’t stop – just, try another angle or something.” His whisper was rather desperate.
“He’s working with Death Eaters?” Harry’s face lit up with curiosity. “You didn’t mention that before. Can you elaborate?”
He felt the same type of feeling today as well; wary, but not scared. Harry was there, which meant no one could hurt him, and Mother was there too, and Pansy and Theo and Blaise, and Ron and Hermione wouldn’t let anything happen either. If push comes to shove he had his own magic as well, the new wand held tight in his pocket. Yes, he was safe. He knew he was safe. He knew, even if he didn’t exactly
He didn’t know what to think, not about any of it, not by a longshot, but somehow the knowledge he was bound made it easier. Horrendous, but easier. If he had no choice, then maybe he didn’t even need to deal with all of this. Sinking into it without a struggle would be far less painful. Harry didn’t seem to share his opinion.
Harry gave an incredulous little laugh. “Me, a buzzkill? The party doesn’t start until I walk in.”
“So maybe before we start with the whole potion-brewing business… a couple of hours’ rest? Then we can do whatever you want.” Harry smiled at him, soft, and Draco wanted too many things all at once. He nodded when Hermione yawned too, and then Pansy, and then Ron.
“Well it might have been like that at first, but…” he shook his head. “It’s not just that anymore. I do care about you, Malfoy, you personally. When I saw you on Sunday – fuck, I was so angry, I could have burned. I wanted to kill them. Actually kill them.”
“Better now?” Potter asked, and Draco nodded gingerly. Now that
The setting wasn’t exactly to his favor; Draco was staggering a bit, because hot, and flustered, and alcohol. Too many people –
Draco hardly, hardly understood anything. What was he asking him to do? What did he mean when he said – when he said that – that his father was – his breath came in shallow and quick. “Please.” He was out of his mind with pure hysteria.
“Harry is sad?” Bellatrix taunted. “Little Harry misses his boyfriend?”
“But Harry,” Neville gasped, gesturing with his chin towards the battling blond. Harry shook his head.
“No, no, I’m trying to, it’s just… level with me here, currently, are you wearing two different socks, or an actual pair for a change?” Draco’s tone was very flat.
“All right?” Harry asked, so attuned to Draco’s ever-changing moods it was frankly annoying.
“You’re
Malfoy nodded and carefully brought his head back up. His lips were very tight. “I – all right.”
He was still aware, though. He could see when they attached a lead to his collar, could feel the unbearable pain as they hauled him across the dungeons and up the steps. He tried to keep up, to crawl on his hands and knees, but the pain from his broken bones was blinding and he simply could not do it. Draco fell countless times, dragged forwards from his neck, and the salty tears in his eyes were the only reaction he could produce.
Harry turned his head to look at him. “How exactly did you research this? And when?”
not helping. If anything, he should be doing the opposite; trying to find a place in his mind in which to hide, to shelter himself. But his mind had been raped for days, ransacked and left breached and cold, and there was no shelter there. Draco sobbed so hard, his chains rapped against the pole as his shoulders rocked up and down, making melancholy music of loss. He was doomed. He was doomed. And he couldn’t fucking bring himself to stop it.
“Snape?”

And it didn’t matter how many times he told himself off, or heard Hermione whisper in his ear; he knew the way Snape treated Sirius was one of the reasons his godfather couldn’t stay behind. One of the reasons he was… the lump in his throat was extremely bitter. One of the reasons he was dead.
. Fuck, how he needed to be His.
“I don’t think that’s as much of a compliment as you imagine it to be,” Draco said, a touch breathless. “And besides, I don’t want you working too hard. You may be better, but you’d still do well to rest.”
Draco tried at a scoff, but it was very halfhearted. “I'm not even enough to be a person anymore, Potter. Alone, I’m just a pile of solid nothing.”
Draco rolled even more into himself. This time he didn’t even notice how Potter said he cared about him. All he could concentrate on was doom (much colder now, thank you, it did feel a little good to be right). Weasley is never going to be satisfied with that, and he’s not going to help them, and he’s going to know. Then Draco’s life will end, because no way these bastards won’t want to put him back behind bars, and…
The temptation was almost too hard to bear. He could have wished for nothing more than this exactly, to rest, to be done. Draco coughed and tried to catch his breath. “I already told you,” he said, or at least tried to say. His vocal cords were singed and his voice was a little less than a croak.
“Is it the sort of nothing that rhymes with… Larfoy?” Ron sniggered. “Not many things rhyme with Malfoy,” he offered apologetically to Hermione’s knitted eyebrows.
“N-no,” Harry murmured, glancing at him then quickly reverting his gaze to the fire. “Nothing. Just a normal day of secretly conniving with you.”
“Oh, here and there,” Malfoy smiled and replied, although that was really no answer at all. Harry stared at him until he chuckled. “I’ve never done it, if that’s what you’re asking. But Pansy did it to me once, so I guess I picked up some tricks from her.” He pulled Harry’s boxers back up and tucked him in. Harry was too spent and shocked to do anything but let Malfoy move him, though he was smiling happily all the while.
Draco hummed, getting to his feet, feeling entirely woozy. “Yes. And I need to give you your gift, too. Oh, I didn’t say yet – happy birthday, Harry.”
“It’s all a matter of concentration,” Hermione said quickly, and Harry caught Malfoy very nearly rolling his eyes. “If you really envision where you want to go, you would get there no problem.”
“But you didn’t want to,” he said, and he couldn’t quite keep the misery out of his voice. He tried so hard all day, and then he was stupid enough to let this happen. How could he do this? how could he let himself? “You said you didn’t want to. I - I made you do it.” He tried not to sound like it was the end of the world, but he kind of felt like it was.
“Try me,” Harry suggested with a shrug. Malfoy sighed.
“Yeah, yeah, all right.” He rubbed his nose and stared at Draco, obviously displeased. “But I have my phone, and I swear to god, if something happens and you don’t call me – “
Well, right now, there were two: he had to remain unseen by the tall lady, no matter what. He knew all too well what would happen if she saw him. If she approached. Gods, if she spoke to him… Draco dashed to the back room, cursing himself for his stupidity. He should know better. Damn it, he’s been warned.
“No, please, go and do whatever it was you wanted to do. I'll tell you some other time.” They had pizza for dinner, and Draco didn't want to see little pepperoni pieces dotting the carpet when he will most certainly sick up if he continues thinking about it. He pushed the uncomfortable thought away.
Now he was just perplexed. “Nothing out of the ordinary, Sir.” Draco was aching to ask why, but that would have been rude, and he was not going to make that mistake again.
“Look, I’m sorry. I don’t know if – hell, I didn’t mean for you to see that. I’m not even sure I knew it was there. I just care about you a lot, okay? I really do. You’re – you’re really important to me.” He held his arms open, pleading. Malfoy shook his head.
A heartfelt conversation under the moonlight, some light freaking out, and a supportive Hermione. Need much more?
Harry shook his head. “It wasn’t you.”
Hermione gave him an equally understanding look. “You know we’d support you no matter what. If you want to cut him out of your life completely, we’d never speak of him again. But if you want to go and talk to him…” she sighed and put her hand on his other shoulder, “then you should really do it now.”
“So it is what you’re trying, then? You want to see how fast I get tired of you?”
Harry chuckled, scratching his neck. “Yeah, I never would have guessed it. It’s still hard to believe, even though it’s happening right now.”
“Promise. Harry, promise you won’t leave me.”
“Are you going to be alright?” he asked quietly. Nodding, though he was completely unsure, Harry sent him over with a smile. The two left and now he was alone with Malfoy who was heaving over the wall, one hand on it to hold himself up.
At some point he quietened, only the minute shaking a sign of what was still wracking him up inside. Harry’s hand softly released the back of his head. “Hey, are you hungry? I saw there’s some food in the kitchen. I could make you something to eat if you wanted.”
“Draco, stop. I don’t want you to apologize for that. I’m not the least bit mad, not about what you said, not about the bond. I’m angry with myself, and I’m furious with him, but not with you, not even a little. Okay? Is that… does it mean anything?”
“I don’t fucking know! Do
“It’s getting better still. I think it shouldn’t take too long till it’s fully recovered. It doesn’t look nice, but it doesn’t hurt nearly as much.”
“Why did you have to do that?” he eventually asked, a long sigh of a question. He didn’t look at the shadow, only at the flowers. “Why did you do all that to me?”
eaten? – Potter was adamant, and Draco had to give in. He didn’t have much experience arguing with men who were as sure of themselves as Potter, who had such steel resolve. Not that he was experienced with arguing, in general. Not anymore, not this version of him. Draco surrendered fast enough, and agreed that after they were done cleaning – emphasis on the
, but I’m giving you the formal release. Okay? Just let it go already.”
“Please.”
Stay tuned for some more delicious sins 😈
. They’ll tell you where you’re needed, but it doesn’t mean you have to do it all on your own again. This time it’s not your fight.”
Draco had to pinch himself continuously to remain awake, since at this stage of exhaustion, even all the adrenaline was beginning to wear off. When the little alarm clock Potter once used as a portkey signaled it’s been an hour, he opened Potter’s mouth carefully and coaxed four more drops of the thick potion in. Potter frowned, but he swallowed obediently, and Draco hated just how sweet his face looked. Just to be on the safe side he gave him a bit more of the pain-relief potion too, and made sure the bandages weren’t soaked yet and in need of changing (not that he thought he could do it himself. He would have called Kreacher. There was a time and a place for being adventurous, even for trying to be brave, but he won’t be helping anyone by fainting all over Potter). When all was set and done he sighed and sat down on the rug next to Potter’s bed.
was too much.
“Sorry,” Harry hurried to say, aghast. He must have been as white as a sheet, and he could feel his heart racing inside him fifty times its normal speed. He wanted to be there for Draco, he really did, but he just wasn’t certain he could take it. Lowering his eyes to the ground he tried to stabilize his breathing.
about Azkaban, to share with Harry things he never thought he’d be able to share. He even pulled away from Harry’s kiss, hadn’t he? Actively refused, something he thought had been rooted out of him long ago. He told Harry the truth, even when he was so scared, even when he thought it might kill him. And he kissed him for no other reason other than he wanted to, which was – madness of the first order, and such a stupid, terrible, human thing to do. He actually did it. He kissed Harry and held him and let him touch, and wanted him to touch, and he even gathered enough courage to ask him to be naked
No, he really didn’t think he could. Something hard was fitting itself into the tight space of his throat. The warm pull in his abdomen was about to drive him even more insane than he already was, and for the first time Draco thought he might know what it meant. For as big as the shock of this revelation was, he did know, all along, in some part of him he already knew. Knew just who He was, and denied it, refused to accept it. Kept it hidden, too – pushed it way down, all of his disgust, his fear, for so long repressed and ignored. He kept it so far down it could only resurface as a dull ache, a maddening pull…
“What are you trying to do, Malfoy?” Ernie asked bravely, putting his arms on Malfoy’s shoulders as he started to move, writhing to release himself from their grasp.
“Will Master Harry want his breakfast served here?” a tiny voice asked and Draco jumped to his feet. He completely forgot there was someone still in the house with them. Potter seemed to have forgotten too.
Potter bit his lip as if he was in so much pain and there was no other way to express it. Draco could only stare. “I’m so sorry, Malfoy. I really didn’t mean to do that to you.”
“Quieten my mind? Do you mean like, meditate?” the edges of Malfoy’s lips were slanted upwards.
“Really?” Ron seemed a little ill. His blue eyes drove holes through Harry. “Did you – did you really...?” his tone suggested absolute shock, and Harry caught Hermione’s surprised look.
Which was most of the reason why he went outside the room; fear was still trying to glue his socked feet to the floor, but he managed to get out there anyway. What he saw in the living room made his already-baffled mind do a frenzied sort of loop into deeper waters – everywhere he looked there were people, casting, punching, tugging, pulling – flashes of spells in every color, the smell of something burning, the sting of smoke in his eyes… it was madness. Sheer madness. And right in front of the door was Harry, his elbow deep in Mulciber’s throat, gasping as he bent the tall man in half and threw him against the wall where he fell. Draco gulped nervously. Yes, Harry was strong, he knew that. But… he just didn’t think… not
It was impossible. Harry was just so –
The silence was even thicker now. The three teenagers looked at each other, speechless. Ron cleared his throat. “He really… wow. I never – I mean, I thought he was – I just can’t believe we fell for that so easily. We should have known better. We
The fright inside him was almost level with the ever-active whirlpool of anger. There was too much of it to even address properly anyway, too much wrong. To think that these men, these
The Head Auror sounded far less jovial. “We’ll discuss it when you’re back. In the meantime, won’t you bloody go to the hospital already? This is an order, not a request.”
“Good Gods, Potter, will you wait a damn minute?” but he was grinning. Harry wanted to kiss him so bad.
The hands ushered him up to sitting on the sofa, and He stood above him. Draco bowed his head low. “Thank you, Sir. It means… everything to me.” A slight tug at his chin made him raise his head, opening his eyes. There was a familiar look on the pale face above him that sent a cold shiver down his spine.
“Now?” the soldier smiled and took one of Draco’s hands. “Now we go home.”
Breathing hard he decided to skip dinner and get a head start on his mountain of homework before he’d need to report for his punishment.
“You – well, this,” Draco breathed back. “You won’t even look at me.” Stupid, stupid piece of –
“I didn’t know who else might be here,” Draco said, keeping his voice even. He searched the face in front of him to see if the man knew of whom he spoke. It seemed like he did.
“Till then, twat.”
The green eyes were so sad.
“The Deathless Elixir of Babylon? The forestaller of death? Come on, you know the one.” It was very evident from Potter’s flushed face that he didn’t. Draco sighed affectionally. “Snape must have mentioned it at least a dozen times in his class. It’s the most famous potion myth! Really, it's even bigger than Midas and his Alchemy. The potion that would allow you to transmit some of your energy into an external source?”
“Sir,” he cawed, and was answered; large hands grabbed him, and in the next second he was encased in strong arms. It was a bit surprising, just how much relief there was in him then, right next to the fear, right next to the overwhelming void that expanded and began to fill him inside. Finally, finally there will be no more expectations of him. Finally he can simply be nothing.
“I, er, might know where it is.”
“I know that,” Malfoy spat, carefully ladling the potion into the beaker. “I never thought you were. I’m just a little tired of begging.” Once the liquid was safely extracted and placed on the table for cooling, Malfoy lowered his gaze. His eyes seemed emptier than the pot Hermione just cleared. “I’m sorry, I know you have no reason to be kind to me. If you wish me to, I will beg.”

“I don’t fucking care about what you have to say. Marvolo is dead, it’s not like he can use anything in that box anymore. You’ve had your chance, we listened, now it’s done. Good fucking riddance.” Harry pulled Draco by the hand, gently, since he was physically incapable of moving on his own.
He pretended to think about it for a second, for which Harry playfully nipped his ear. “Oh, all right, you impatient Gryffindor. I suppose your appalling candor, squeamish naivety and goddamn hopefulness are all quite alluring. Not to mention your dashing good looks, your unbelievable kindness and your indisputable charisma. Yuck, listen to me, I sound like a love-struck child. But it’s true, Harry. You are – damn it, you are fantastic. You're a good person, and you were patient enough to let me try to be one, too. I will never be able to thank you enough.” Harry was far too moved to answer immediately, so he gathered the Slytherin in his arms until he heard a gasp. “All right, you lunatic, that's no reason to smother me!”
“Oh, I see.” Malfoy’s eyes were large and there was a little too much understanding in them for Harry’s liking. “Well, I am all right. He said I need to keep a lower profile, but he didn’t do anything to me, if you were concerned about that.”
before letting your commander know you’ve been attacked! And if that son of a bitch had got you, then what?”

They walked to the castle in complete silence, each boy lost in his own thoughts. He left Malfoy at the entrance hall as he went down to the Slytherin dungeons, and they said they’d meet the following evening so Harry could go with him to see Dumbledore. He actually wanted to go to the headmaster immediately, but Malfoy reminded him that it was the middle of the night, and they’re not supposed to be out and about anyway. Harry couldn’t wait to tell Ron and Hermione what had happened, so much so that he considered waking them up as he made his way to the tower. He crept up the staircase to meet the very annoyed Fat Lady, only to find his two friends sitting in the otherwise empty common room, waiting for him.
And dear gods above, Potter had such a gorgeous smile.
“Yes, sir. I know I may not have a lot of time with him; that is why claiming his heart was the best way to proceed. With the rate we’re advancing, he will soon listen to me rather than his dear professor.” The bitterness in his voice made it almost unrecognizable. Harry shivered behind the door.
“My birthday was on Sunday, Potter.”
Draco looked at the white button-up discarded on the floor.
“No, I’m not saying it was,” now he was really ashamed of himself. “It’s just so different. You’re Harry Potter. You don’t… you don’t know what it means to be alone.”
“Is this… Draco, is this an apology? Because you don’t need to do that. I’m not angry with you. And even if I was, I’d never – “
Exhaustion was a force to be reckoned with, and so Draco didn’t spend the whole night panicking like he imagined he would. Instead he slept, deep and hard on his rug, so deep he didn’t even dream. It was probably the best thing that happened to him in a long while, Potter notwithstanding, because he was also the worst thing that happened to him. In the morning Draco spent exactly three minutes thinking about him – about how he came to the flat last night because he
“No, wait, let me finish. You don’t have to tell me anything you don’t want to, okay? There’s just one thing I have to know. You said that touching your back – that specific spot on your back – activated it, or something like that?” Draco didn’t know if he’s strong enough to speak, so he just nodded. “All right. So I just need to know if there’s any more – spots like that. I need to know I won’t do anything like that by accident. If you will ever want me to touch you again, that is.”
“I can’t, I can’t,” and it was true, he couldn’t. Rutgrass will be in Azkaban still, and Parker and Field… and fuck, fuck
“Seriously, shut it,” Harry warned in a low voice. Neville and Ernie were on the other side of the room, planning their strategy, like they were meant to be doing. For a second he was going to suggest they do just that, but gave up before even trying. They’d just go in and improvise, like they always do. It wouldn’t matter anyway; he couldn’t work with Malfoy. It was simply impossible.
Dumbledore sighed. “As I have expressed before, Mr. Weasley, I believe Draco has had no choice but to share his entire set of memories with his captors. I don’t think there is much he would have been able to keep secret.”
, only His, and it was too dangerous a line to cross. He did not forget the night on the groats. Thoughts turn into words that turn into actions, and he could not, and was not going to, betray Him for his life.
“Sorry,” he replied, buttoning his shirt back up. “That’s not – exactly what I was trying to imply.” He cleared his throat in an unnecessary show of politeness.
“You all right?”
“I mean, I’ve only stated the obvious,” Malfoy said, but his cheeks were coloring up again.
“Nothing. Do you remember his friend, they always used to hang out together. Remember the one?”
it. He rubbed his eyes, furious and confused and bloody sick of it all. It was too much for one person. The Dark Lord’s red eyes, Grove’s blue, His brown. It was too, too, too much, and he was too, too, too small, and he had had enough… he couldn’t take it any longer…
That thing in his chest rattled. “Wow, he must be… what, seven years old now?”
Immediate tears burst out of his eyes, and whatever it was that attacked him – whatever spicy, dry, smokey, terrible substance that was – nearly cost him his life. Grove laughed hoarsely and poured some more of the awful stuff down his throat, leaving Draco dry heaving, fighting for every single breath. Gods, he knew this was torture, he knew it, but… ugh. He hated that he let them play him like that. It would have been a lot easier to bear if he wasn’t crushed by his disappointment, with the lack of water, with the situation, with himself. He really thought he was cleverer than that.
“You need to tell him, Grove. We can’t officially do anything before he knows.”
“Potter, you – those memories – they were of me.”
, who was respected on a global scale and incredibly important to Harry, and he – what, thought he was good enough to contradict her? In what fucking world?
a ten pound note to put in ridiculous places.
“I can honestly say I never did. I didn’t even know that was a thing.” Potter gave a low whistle. “Wizards have some messed-up rules, let me tell you.”
“Yes, but Potter – scanning the scene? Gathering evidence? Doing our bloody
Draco was again too stunned to know what to do. This was a simple gesture, and it was more than he’d gotten in years. For a second he just blinked at Potter, who began to eat in a way that was almost barbaric. “What is it? Not hungry?” It was hard to understand him through the mountain of chips he was trying to conquer.
. Well, bring it fucking on.
Harry didn’t try to initiate any more contact after that, since he didn’t want Malfoy to feel like he is being commanded again. The Slytherin kept his distance from Harry, and as November began, icy cold, he started to think that maybe he lost this battle. It was actually Professor Electra that provided them the chance to speak privately once more.
“It’s going to be cold,” Potter smiled sweetly and offered Draco his hat. “Better wrap up warm. Where we’re going is pretty high up, and there’s still quite a bit of snow all around.”
“Malfoy, I don’t want you to do any of these things. What kind of a twisted fantasy world do you live in?” Ron’s voice was very weak.
“You okay?” Harry asked, small by his ear, making him shiver. “We can tell everyone to fuck off if you want. Or just go back to our room. Everyone would be fine with it, I promise.”
“What, just like that, in front of Greyback?” Harry heard the shock in Ron’s voice.
“Yeah, but when her veins were all lit up – “
. It was hard to imagine where the words even came from.
It felt like they were walking forever, but they still got there too fast for Harry’s taste. At some point, when they just made it past the cover of the trees, Malfoy sent out an arm to stop him. He looked around, more nervous than Harry had ever seen him before. But then he could hear it, too: footsteps on the forest floor. And then, shining in the moonlight, a figure emerged.
Potter said nothing for a moment. “Are you saying they abused you?”
, Potter. You have physical
“I don’t mean himself. If I see him, I’m taking the poison. I can’t face him again, no chance. I – “ he looked down at his bare wrist, and something like shock took his breath away. “Harry, where is it?”
If he hit him, Draco would have been less surprised. This reaction he wouldn’t have expected in a hundred years. Potter made it sound so easy:
“So how would he know?” Potter’s brow furrowed.
“Yes, Harry, Ron’s right. I think that trying to meddle in this will only be a waste of time. If Malfoy wants to deal with Voldemort, what’s it to us? What can you do, anyway?”
“You must have known, Draco, what would happen should you appear here today. You must have known.” His father’s smile paled by comparison to the smile on Greyback’s face. It was somewhere halfway between a grin of pure pleasure and a leer. Draco shook his head back to Lucius.
Draco actually groaned in outrage. “What are you
“Maybe not, but there sure is a lot of other things we can do. I gather he used to make you take off your clothes and then use Crucio on you until you submitted to his ungodly desires? Why don’t we take a leaf from his book, then?”
“Listen to me,” Harry said slowly and clearly. “He's not going to touch you. I'm not going to let him. You do
Shit. Shit. Shit. He didn’t mean for him to see, it’s just, he was always rubbish with healing charms – he’s managed to get by all this time, but – oh, shit. “I…”
“Please!” there was no time for bloody games. “I can’t do it, please don’t let them take me back!”
“No, please, there’s more, I know more – the others, I can tell you about the others!”
“Potter…” Draco expelled a long-suffering sigh. “I know what you’re trying to do here. I appreciate it, but really, there's no need. You told me about my mother, and now you brought me these papers about her, so your debt is definitely paid. You don’t need to feel guilty about riling me up anymore. You’re all good.”
“Potter, you have to relax! Relax your mind, think of nothing!” Harry found himself curled almost into a ball on the sofa when Malfoy lifted the spell. He gave him a very concerned look, but Harry was too furious to consider anything.
“Where are your bodyguards, anyway?” he asked with interest, looking around and still walking towards Malfoy, leaving him no choice but to back up against the wall. “Usually you don’t move without them.”
An hour and a half in the tub made for some improvements in his state, and after it he was able to stand, even if only briefly. Gods, how he missed pain potions then, leaning heavily on doors and walls on his way to the bedroom. Moving was such a nightmare. By the time he got to the shop the delivery van was there already, and a lady he’s never seen before ran to him with a relieved smile. Draco let her in and signed the paperwork, again debating whether or not to ask about David, but he had his fair share of trouble as it was. The woman was kind enough to ask if he needed any help, since she’d seen the way he was limping, but he shook his head and waved her away. This was the last thing he needed. Not any more people coming into his life and making it even messier than it was. When she left he sank into his chair and rubbed his eyes till he was certain he was not going to cry.
“I don’t even think he’s been in the castle recently. I’ve certainly not seen him since before Christmas. Merlin knows where he goes all this time, but I don’t think he was able to do anything about her yet, or I’m sure I would have heard via… other channels.”
“No need,
“No more than usual,” Malfoy shrugged. “Crabbe and Goyle are pretty quiet again now. It doesn’t seem as fun for them anymore now that I’m not injured. Those bastards really liked to watch me squirm.”
“No, I don’t. Sit down, won’t you? You’re making me nauseous.”
“But you knew I was telling the truth,” Harry said quietly. Malfoy wasn’t looking at him now; his gaze was transfixed on the fire.
“Are you mad?” Draco’s eyes went between Harry and Ron quickly. “Both of you go under the cloak, now. I will go and look for her. You’ll remain here.”
When Granger gave him a second article to read through, he’d had just about enough. That morning he woke up to find Harry staring at him once more (with those
“It’s okay, Potter. You don’t have to explain, I understand. You never promised to be my friend.” He tried to keep his voice light, but Harry could still feel it ripping his heart right out of his torso.
The rest of the day passed without him noticing, and somehow it was already five and he closed the shop, leaving the afternoon's memories behind him. Moments like these, soft and warm and tender, were rare and short-lived. He was fully prepared to be greeted with a cold shoulder when he got to the flat. He didn’t much mind, though. As long as someone will
“Here? What, in my bed?” Potter asked, aghast. Draco shook his head no extremely fast.
“You scared the shit out of me,” Harry confessed somewhere to his right, leaning on a tree and shaking his head. “Damn it, Draco, I…” he rubbed his eyes for a minute.
Now Malfoy did look at him, and his smirk was the opposite of humorous. “I seem to recall you called me that, too. An evil psychopath. Is that a sort of go-to expression of yours?”
In the end there was nothing he could do but go and speak to the headmaster, so by Friday two weeks later, that’s what he did. Harry felt like the old man was almost expecting him when he welcomed him into his office, sitting as usual behind the long desk, wearing his sparkling purple cloak.
“Get off me,” he said as soon as he could speak again, snatching the material of his shirt out of Harry’s hands and pulling it back down. Harry could swear he saw some cuts and burns on his stomach and chest as well.
Granger sucked in her lip. “But if it’s not any known curse, or any source of poison…” Draco didn’t actually say
Harry shook violently, hands clenched into fists, unsure what to do with all this burning lava inside him. He had been angry before, one could say that without a doubt. He felt boiling, burning rage before, the type that makes you want to scream and break and kill. He had been furious, seething, eyes-seeing-nothing-but-red type of mad. But this… he had no way of handling this. He had no tools to work around it. He was completely and utterly lost in it, helpless in the raging sea of smoldering hot tar. And he knew that he must calm down, that if he continued this way he will actually burn, but there was no off switch. He was already swimming in it… swimming further and further away… swimming… drowning…
“Shh,” Harry squeezed his hand once, twice, “Shh, Draco, it’s all right, it’s going to be okay, you’re all right… please, calm down, calm down, you’re all right…”
familiar; an exact copy of the ones in the abandoned flat. A copy, Draco knew, and not the originals – the not-so-obvious spots of blood were missing from the places where he knew they should be. Draco gulped, stunned, and the realization took even longer to sink in. Potter transformed the furniture here to resemble that in the flat, so Draco would feel more at home.
In a sudden move Draco spun on his heels and stared at the bin. “Come out, Potter. I know you're there.” The silence was only disturbed by the wind; the street was completely empty but for the two of them. That is, if Draco was correct in his assumption. “Potter, it’s too cold to be standing here like this. Will you just come out?”
“Well, you even got a higher score on your O.W.L.s!”
he can’t be left alone? Draco was just shocked sometimes that people could ignore his very correct observations. Sometimes it was something childish, like
“I do. I really do. I’m never going to – I don’t ever want to hurt you, Draco. Ever. It’s the last thing I want to do. And I can’t tell you how proud I am of you for standing your ground, I’m beyond happy about that.”
“What don’t I listen to?” It wasn’t even angry, his voice now, and Draco faltered.
“But we were told to wait here,” the chubby man groaned, obviously unhappy to be receiving orders from Snape.
“Question you?” Harry’s voice was barely even a whisper as he drew in a startled gasp. “What do you mean?”
“But you jumped in to take up the reins anyway? You’re so used to being the bloody poster-boy that you’d take that one too? Or, I’m sorry, have they perhaps made you Head Auror and I’ve not really been paying attention?”
“Malfoy…” Harry sighed. He eyed the blond wearily. “When was the last time you ate?”
“I said you wouldn’t know love if it bit you in your snaky arse,” Potter spat, and Draco gasped. Such blatant disrespect – but surely he will be punished for it, he will be made to hurt, and Draco wanted to warn him – to protect him – but there was nothing to do; he could not move, and only they controlled the pain.
“You did this to him!” Harry shouted out of nowhere, which was confusing until he elaborated, voice rough with hate: “You did this to Draco! You and your undead Macnair, you did all of this to him! Everything fake Grove did in Azkaban, all of it, it was all you!”
The feeling in his stomach was decidedly rotten. Draco knew something had changed, but he didn’t really understand what. Things – wonderful things, improbable things – kept happening that night, and he could find no explanation to them. Not only that he wasn’t punished for what happened with Potter, not only that he was healed like he was with that terrific bit of magic he’d never seen before, not only that they ate together – later that night He even took Draco to His
Draco staggered out of the boiling bathroom and onto the hall, and the change in temperature made his brain slow so he didn’t catch onto the warning signs quick enough. When he did, it was all he could do not to scream his heart out.
“I’ll give you some privacy, yeah? I’ll be right outside the door. I hope you don’t mind, but I’ve had them cast a sounding spell on you, so I’d still be able to hear. I really don’t want to intrude, but… I can’t let anything happen to you. I’m sorry.”
“-No, but I just might go crazy.”
Draco watched him refill the glass from the jug and resume his seat. He was kind enough not to ask why Harry didn’t just use his wand. “I would understand if you don’t want to stay.”
floating in the air around them as good as if he had said it. He raised a shaky hand to run in his silvery hair.
“All the more reason for you to tell me right away! Potter, this is simply unacceptable, and it is by no means an excuse for your behavior! Failing to notify your commander immediately upon an attack – playing with fire, running off Merlin-knows where on your own, investigating without telling anybody, taking no precautions – “
Something, something, he needed to do something. He had no idea what, as seventeen years of consciousness were jammed into a far-too-tight tube then proceeded to wash over him. Draco was drowning in his own mind. He had no idea what to do, but he knew he had to do it, now. Harry was here, and now he knew where here was, and what was going to happen to him here. Draco could not let that happen, but he was lost under the waves, swept further and further away from shore… he was drowning…
He just stood there, hardly changed since the last time Draco saw him, seven long years ago. Well, changed a little. He was slightly broader, and standing taller, in a dignified sort of way. Better clothes, too, no more the shabby hand-me-downs he used to wear. His hair looked just as messy as ever - perhaps even more so now, when the rest of him looked so well put together. And then the glasses were exactly the same, and so was the vivid shade of green behind them, even if the expression in these eyes now was not entirely familiar to Draco. It was like a sight from another life, but it was right here in front of him. Bloody fuck.
“Dumbledore,” Harry said immediately, hope igniting deep inside him. “He will be able to do it all. He can find a place for the two of you, he can get you the hell away from him. And I will help in any way I can.”
“Easy with the questions,” Malfoy smiled, but he didn’t seem at all amused. If anything, he looked a little nauseous. “I've been taught to use the Unforgiveable curses when I turned fifteen. Over the summer, I was instructed further in the performance of the torture and the Imperio curse.”
from him. His anger, already roaming freely everywhere, was upsurging incredibly fast. Draco held the bracelet in his hand and waited for something dramatic to happen.
“Bollocks,” Harry spat, distracted for a second. “He didn’t even think about you!”
After a while Potter had no choice but to redo the charm, and reveling in his warmth, Draco sighed and tried to take it all in. He had to stop a couple of times to place his other hand over his heart, which was so close to exploding, it made him feel faint. This – the shreds of blue sky, the loch gleaming under them, the clear air – it was almost too much. It was open and achingly beautiful and more peaceful than he'd ever seen. Draco could stay there forever. Then as they turned a corner to surround the hill he stopped and actually squealed. “Potter, what’s – oh, Merlin.” He was frightened enough to pull his hand out of Potter’s and cover his mouth. There was a disconcerting sound coming from his right, and it took a moment before he realized that Potter was
“Here, take this,” Hermione said before he could leave, taking a little bottle filled with yellow liquid out of her bag. “It should help the bleeding parts, at least. It might make the bruises a little better, too. But for the broken bone, he really needs to get it set with a spell.”
“And before all that – what of the times you used me as your own designated cloth to wipe your sword with?”
Draco walked out of the room without looking at Granger. His heart was heavy and his feet were even heavier, so every step was a struggle. Still, this was the only way. There was nothing else he could have done at this point. With a sniffle he brought his head up and walked the increasingly familiar way to the drawing room.
. Draco hadn’t felt good in this life, in the after. It was always bad, very bad or extremely bad. At best it was tolerable. But this was good. It was an unknown territory, which scared him a little, but he could deal with fear. He could deal with anything today. It was a good day.
Some minutes later tea had been made, and Draco received his cup standing in the middle of the kitchen, hands shaking. “Um, should we go to the living room?” Potter seemed like he didn’t quite know how to handle Draco now, like he was something very delicate that he wished to hold with care. He found he didn’t mind that. In some ways he was starved for it, even. He nodded and followed Potter to the sofa, sitting beside him. They were both silent for a while.
Oh gods. Oh, no, oh gods, oh – no – Draco felt it scraping against his trousers, and stiffened to the point of wrinkling time into a pause. No. He won’t – they wouldn’t. Draco swallowed something sharp ang tangy and tried to say something, but he found he simply didn’t have the words. He didn’t know what to think.
Warnings: none
“Like
“Do you understand what must come now, my love? Do you understand why I must punish you? How you made me have to punish you so?” his nod was so, so weak. “Draco…” the sigh was even weaker, almost soft, and Draco’s shuddering intensified. “I didn’t want to have to do this. For months now I only envisioned the joy of our reunion. I never gave any mind to – I didn’t imagine having to resort to this. I am sorely disappointed in you.”
Harry was frozen for the longest moment, completely unable to move. It was Malfoy who finally jumped off of him, landing somewhat stickily on the sofa, eyes open in utter terror. Swallowing nervously, Harry tried to force his lips into saying something, but he failed. He closed his eyes in shame.
“Because I… because I trust you.”
Draco didn’t need to be told – the look in those damn eyes was enough, and he did have some practice by now. He managed to settle semi-comfortably behind the bathroom door by the time Potter’s best friend made it to his bedroom.
And oh, gods, of course. “No,” Draco breathed, all of a sudden comprehending. It took this long, but he finally understood. It took
“I’m sorry, Draco. I didn’t mean to – I never meant to make you beg. For anything. I know how much you hate it.” That was a bit of a comical remark to make, really, seeing how Draco practically lived on begging for years now. “But I meant what I promised you, though. I’m not going to leave you. I’m going to end this.”
“I won’t hurt you.”
“The white one in the back, thorn apple. Only it wasn’t called that – on the list it appeared as
What. The actual. Fuck.
Draco looked relieved, the unbelievable fool, and Harry loved him so much he felt delirious. The weight of the ring on his finger was tangible proof, a physical evidence that this was really happening.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Granger shook her head, still so bloody candid. “You’re one of the smartest men I know. You’d be invaluable. Not to mention you’d know best because, well, it has everything to do with you.”
It looked like Malfoy fainted. Harry knelt next to him, turning him on his back and trying to get him back to his senses. The other two hurried over, and Hermione did a complicated-looking movement with her wand that got Malfoy gasping and waking up immediately. His eyes were hazy, and for a moment he seemed like he didn’t know where he was. Then he came into focus and looked around him, alarmed.
“What?” Ron nearly shouted, appalled. Then he took a steadying breath. “Harry, why would You-Know-Who hurt the son of his right-hand man? This makes no sense.”
“Just you,” Draco whispered, and already his eyes were closing. Harry’s ribs gave up and cracked open, and now his heart took every single inch of his chest. Harry climbed up onto the bed and held Draco, and the little approving ‘hmm’ he got was the single best sound he’d ever heard. He didn’t fall asleep that night either, but he didn’t really need sleep anymore. Just like he didn’t need air, or his ribs, or anything in fact that didn’t start and end with Draco. Now that he had him back – now that they were truly together again – he could be calm.
. “No, I’m not trying to be a – never mind. I just thought… whatever.”
“I see. That is unfortunate. I do wonder, though – do indulge me for a second: you died. What becomes of Draco?” Harry made a choked little sound. “I merely point out – you’re dead. Draco is kneeling at my feet, here in his rightful place. What do you imagine happens to him, if you are not there?”
“Ah. Well. I can’t really – but – oh, fine, what the hell. It turns out it wasn’t him.”
“Just that ever since we started – er, spending all this time together…” Harry felt his cheeks burn as he didn’t meet either of their gazes, “I’ve been – I’ve not been as focused on Sirius anymore. I feel like I… I don’t know. Forgot about him, or something.”
"For being such a masochist,” Grove assisted, and Draco nodded gratefully.
who’s abused at least half the prison, probably? The man was very obviously spooked, and Draco tried to tell himself it made him feel better. But he knew the truth; trapped animals give a brutal fight. If Grove felt this was his only chance, he sure was going to take it. For a second he thought he’d lose it and throw up again, all over himself, but at the very last second he caught himself and desisted. He couldn’t afford to show the smallest sign of weakness in front of him.
“You are. How you’re so… it’s unbelievable. You grew up with people who mistreated and abused you, not knowing anything about the world to which you belong. And then you got thrown right in the deep end and you were still so… bloody noble. And good. I just can’t understand it, Potter. I don’t know how – I mean, surely my life was far better than yours, and still I’m not even…” he stopped, eyes widening in confusion. “I’m sorry. I’m rambling. Please forget I said anything.”
It was all Lovegood’s fault. ‘Oh, Harry goes to that place all the time’, with that bloody smile of hers. He should have foreseen this too – but Draco couldn’t think
He stared at his father uncomfortably. Lucius was so thin, nearly as thin as Draco, and in the brighter light provided by the fire he seemed even worse. Haunted, maybe. There was a darkness in his eyes Draco had never seen before. He cleared his throat. “So… how have you been, Father?”
“Draco,” Harry tried again, hoarse with screaming and with fright and with smoke. “Draco, it’s okay, you’re okay…” but he wasn’t, he
“I thought about it, Potter. I think I will take you up on your offer and sleep at the tower tonight. But only for tonight, though.” Harry’s heart gave a startled little leap. His smile grew, if it was possible, even wider.
“Why are you telling me this?” Harry’s voice trembled when he finally said something. Draco gave him a stern look. Doesn’t he know?
“You – “ and then he gasped, hand covering his mouth, eyes widening in horror. “You heard the conversation. Me and Snape.”
“Yes, I did. How did you – “
The footsteps returned to tap. “Godric forgive me… fine. Report daily with updates on your condition. If anything goes south – and I mean anything, Potter, I don’t care how minor – you let me know straightaway. Even if I have to drag you there kicking and screaming, by Merlin, I will. Understood?”
“All right. We can go to a Muggle pub and you can buy me a beer. One beer, and that will be all. After that you will never come back here and I will never lay eyes on you again.”
“No. I didn’t… I didn’t. Sorry.” He bowed his head low and waited for it to clear. There was still some water in there, and it was becoming increasingly hard to determine if this was real life or not. Nothing felt real. Nothing could be real anymore.
“Thanks, Malfoy. I’m… that’s nice. It’s still the weirdest bloody thing ever, but it is nice.” He cleared his throat and brushed a sleeve past his eyes. “See you around, I guess?”
“So…” That felt like the best he could do. Malfoy glared at him.
Draco couldn’t understand how not
He rose upwards, tongue still completely entangled with its counterpart, and holding Malfoy with both hands he pushed him backwards so he was lying on the sofa, Harry coming to lie on top of him. Malfoy complied with his movement, sliding backwards to let Harry’s body fit better, and now they were pressed so tightly together, Harry’s heart actually stopped beating. One of his hands sent out to Malfoy’s face, cupping his cheek in his palm, and the other went up and down on his chest, climbing under his shirt, finding the smooth skin underneath. He remembered seeing Malfoy shirtless, and that made his already foggy mind even foggier. Everything in his body was on fire; a shaky, tingly fire that sent him moaning and almost leaping at the boy, sliding ever so deeply into his mouth.
“I think you have, yes, once or twice. It was stronger than me, though, you know. Family trait.” He gave an involuntary little wince. “I got a letter this week,” he said in a very by-the-way tone. Harry wasn’t fooled.
“What! Of course you didn’t. You did nothing wrong. I betrayed your trust. I lied to you. I – “ he was going to say he deserved what he got, but did he now? Something about that statement felt off. Well, everything felt off. It was all such a haze, he couldn’t be confident about a single thing anymore.
“You alright, mate?” he heard Ron speaking as if from a different planet, and did his best to pull himself back to the room around him. Apparently he was stuck at the very door to the hall, attracting many glances. He shook his head, steeling himself, and stepped in.
.” Harry gave him a defiant ‘and?’ type of look, and his shoulders actually sagged with exasperation. “Harry, you can’t possibly go anywhere near her!”
“Yes. Sitting in a booth, grinning like a maniac. I didn’t know what to do, Potter. I just froze. I dropped this huge tray, and all the glasses – anyway, he came up to me and started talking. I could hardly even hear what he said. Something about how he’d found me, how he was going to… take me back…” Draco swept a very shaky hand over his eyes. He wished he could not remember what his face looked like. Just to cut it out of his heart.
Harry let that stand between them for a moment. “Wow. That’s big, isn’t it? Does it mean the appeal’s been approved?”
“Again with your delusions, Potter. No one is following you. I don’t care about you enough to follow you.”
back then. Was it possible that he scarred Teddy accidentally, without meaning to?
With this, Draco seemed to have exhausted himself. He fell to the ground, hugging his knees, head leaning on them so his fine hair covered his face. Harry stood there for a second, breathless, horrified. Ron and Hermione were so quiet, they may have stopped breathing too. Then he lowered himself to kneel at his side, looking at him tenderly.
She looked so much like Malfoy, it was startling. Harry could feel the emotion building up in the boy next to him almost like it was in his own chest. He could see on his face that he yearned to just run to her and hold her tight in his arms, but he was stopping himself with what seemed like great force. It hurt a little to see all this raw emotion on the normally blank face, so instead Harry turned to Narcissa. He remembered thinking she was rather beautiful two years ago, and she was even more so now, with her eyes full of tears and love etched on every line of her face. She mastered herself as well, standing tall and keeping her distance. “Draco, my love,” she said finally, and sent her hand forward.
?” his incredulity quickly morphed into frustration as Draco nodded.
. He was supposed to go to his first therapy session that evening. He probably won’t make it.
(See the end of the chapter for
But no, wait, no. What did he learn? What did he
“Nothing,” Harry said as his cheeks turned crimson. “I’m just glad it’s almost the weekend.”
The thought of Harry was warm and oddly sweet. The oddest thing about it was how Draco didn't even need him in order to exist anymore; he was real outside of Harry's eyes, too. Still, and despite what he'd believed, Harry stayed by his side - and being allowed to love him was the best present Draco ever gave himself. Even if he was still terrified. This was a choice he’d made – all of it, everything, this was all his choice. He could do whatever he wanted, no one was going to stop him. The possibilities were endless, and he was learning to accept it, even if very slowly. He could even close his eyes and not be mortally afraid. Gods.
“Are we going to do this, then, Lucius? Not that I’m not enjoying the little stare-down, but…” Greyback’s voice brought them both back in an instant.
“Is that so. Interesting. What do you see, Draco? Who is this boy before you?”
Daniel
to be here for you every night, because you said you wanted routine, because you said you were lost without it – “
A long hiss came from his father and startled him. “I am not going to kill you, Draco. Really, you are being so dramatic. What should I stand to gain from killing my own heir? Surely I will not do such a careless thing.”
“I’ve known you since – “
man, everyone’s
“Can’t you see that it doesn’t matter now?” Harry screamed. “Don’t you see that none of this matters anymore? All this time you’ve been lying to me, deceiving me! You didn’t really like me, you were only trying to get close to me to sell me out! You never even wanted my help!”
Draco nodded stiffly. “Keep out of sight, Dobby.” Then he turned to the invisible three. “Keep the cloak on at all times, no matter what we see. Be absolutely quiet. If I'm attacked – “
Again he could only shrug. The anger bubbling inside him only intensified, so much so that he was physically shaking. His friends registered it, and they passed a worried look between them. “Harry, come on, mate. You have to tell us what’s wrong. If you don’t speak now, I reckon you’re going to explode.”
He did. It was absolute agony, but he did. Draco blinked at the living room light, trying to assess the situation. Harry was not sitting on the chair next to the sofa, and it took a while for his glazed eyes to find him – on the carpet, surrounded by papers. Draco sighed and tried to get up.
With an anguished sigh, Harry nodded. “Of course, I’m sorry. I’ll untie you, but – if it’s going to look like you might do something, I may have no choice but to touch you. I’ll try not to as much as I can, but if I have to, I’ll do it. I’m not going to let you kill yourself over that awful man, Draco.”
He could feel Harry and Mother holding back their
Draco shrugged, looking about him and seeing nothing. He couldn’t quite believe it himself. He couldn’t believe anything, about anything, ever. “I’m sorry.”
“So do you believe me when I say I couldn’t be having a better time than I am right now?” Harry surprised them both by sneaking a kiss to the edge of Draco’s nose, a barely-there touch. “I’m surrounded by the people I love. Ron and Hermione are getting married. You look stunning, and I get to hold your hand.” He shook their clasped fists in demonstration. “There is honestly nothing else I need right now.”
In a swift motion he took off Malfoy’s trousers, letting him release his feet by himself as he pulled down his boxers. He stared right at his erect cock, and a weird sensation stole over him, making him shiver slightly with desire. He sent his hand to grab at the other boy and heard his gasping when his fingers made contact. Smiling and gaining more confidence when seeing the deep red in his cheeks, Harry closed his palm around Malfoy, and was delighted to hear that low groan again.
Draco didn’t know how to explain he’d probably feel comfortable under any ‘phobia’ group under the sun. “I just don’t like… being exposed. That’s all. You know how I’m meant to be dead to all the people who know me.” And then, meant to be
“In a minute!” Potter yelled at the door, confused and upset. “Draco, I’m sorry, I didn’t – “
A sudden thought made his heart tighten in his chest. “Professor – do you think I am a danger to him? that being near me will only – will only get him – “
“No,” the blond said again, his lip snarling. “You will just order me about the castle like your little puppy dog. Aren’t you glad to still have this power over me, Potter?”
His tone might have tipped Harry off to how serious he was, and he squeezed Draco’s hand hard enough to hurt. “All right. I swear it. I swear to always, always be your friend, no matter what happens.” Draco blinked too much and too quick, so Harry won’t see the tears. “Hey, what about you? Won’t you make the same promise? I – I might need to hear it back.”
Only two more to go...
“And he attacked you?” Harry asked a little redundantly, his voice barely over a whisper.
“No, never mind. I guess there’s no harm in this. These are my files – well, all the attacks from the last few months, and the Fergus Macnair file too. That’s him right there, the picture under your elbow.”
Gasping heavily, suddenly exhausted, he dared to open his eyes. Malfoy was just there, beaming at him, and his heart gave a painful lurch as he nearly shot up to kiss him. Malfoy received him eagerly, kissing and licking his lips. Harry fell back down onto the bed and managed a hysterical little giggle. “Fuck, Malfoy,” he said at the end, hand covering his eyes.
But he wasn’t, he wasn’t,
“Well I am glad to hear,” Malfoy said, looking just as sheepish as the redhead. Hermione gave each of the boys a long look, then sighed.
Draco begged his mind, but it was like asking a wild tarantula to go fetch his slippers. Draco’s mind wasn’t built for situations like these. It wasn’t used to being relied upon, or even trusted. And right now it did nothing, nothing to help him. But he had to think – he had to do something for Potter, something for
Potter chuckled. “It’s a little hard to see, only the tail is popping from under her collar. It looks a little like… you know what? I think it might be a dragon.” Now Draco was glad he didn’t look. It would have hurt way too much, because he was fairly certain he knew why she’d choose to get that particular design. “What is it with you Slytherins and tattoos? Have to be badass or you get thrown out of your dorms?”
. What he let them to do to them both – what he let them get away with – it was far, far, far more than he could ever forgive. And yet… looking at him now, at this boy, at the man sitting on that damned chair, at the four guards in their thick cloaks – seeing the whole picture – Draco realized he’d been looking at it all wrong. He was blaming himself for something that was truly, completely, entirely out of his hands. How could this boy be at fault? Just look at him. He didn’t know anything. How can anyone hold him accountable for what these – these
“No, come on. You didn’t do anything wrong, okay? I was a total arse, leaving like that, and then not explaining myself when I really should have. I’m sorry.” He spoke as sincerely as he could, because Malfoy looked like an absolute wreck. He was shaking a little and covering his face, his hair bouncing up and down. “Malfoy, I’m really sorry.”
Potter stretched miserably. “This is very uncomfortable.”
Draco’s throat was a little tight as he nodded. “All right then.”
“Oh.” If he hit him, Harry would have probably looked less miserable. “All right. Do you, erm, want to go back, or…?”
“That’s not true,” Harry replied indignantly. Damn everyone and their obsession with him and his helping people thing. “It was maybe the reason I was drawn to you, but not the reason I developed those feelings. I fell for you because of who you really were, not because of the lies. Even after I found everything out – even when I was so furious with you I couldn’t breathe – still I loved you. And it fucking hurt me so much, I would really appreciate it if you didn’t treat it so lightly.”
. He’s already come to terms with the fact that he likes Malfoy; that was unavoidable. But to be so – obsessed with him… it was a little bit too much. He can’t possibly want to spend every second with him, can’t take it badly when they have to sit apart for less than an hour. He's being ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous. He has to get a handle on himself… but it couldn't be helped, the way his heart leaped with inexplicable joy when Malfoy came out of the Hall, grinning towards him. There was nothing that could stop this sticky, warm feeling inside him as he drew nearer. Damn, damn, damn. Harry just could not control his smile.
“Before you have a stroke.” Draco huffed and covered his face with one shaky hand. This was getting dangerous. As if the stakes weren’t high enough. “I’m not saying
“Well, I haven’t exactly made the best choices myself. I don’t think I have the right to judge anyone else’s.”
There was a very dangerous light in the grey eyes as Malfoy opened his mouth to answer. “I did not ask you to solve this for me, Potter. I’ve been nice up till now, or at least nice enough. I will not be nice anymore. Drop the subject, or else.”
“Draco – “
He grew dizzy, and the voice became muffled. Then he was asleep, or in any case, not awake.
“Ah, I’ve faced him before, it’s really not a big deal,” Harry felt his smile becoming wilder by the second. “I’m not scared of him, and I’m not scared of you.” He pushed his wand into Malfoy's chest, making him gasp again. “You can’t do anything to me.”
“Where… do you have any idea where – “
it really didn’t make Harry feel better to hear him say that, especially in that miserable tone of voice. “…Right. So let’s say we meet on… Wednesday?”
It was obvious he wanted to touch him, and Draco braced himself, but Potter mastered himself and did not move. “No. He's still here. He's right in front of me. Bruised, yes, and he’s been through a lot, and maybe he feels a little lost. But he’s still you. You are still here. Don’t ever let yourself forget it.”
“I kissed – “ he never got to the end of the sentence, and it wasn’t because a wand was suddenly raised at him. It wasn’t because of the imminent pain, it was simply because something dawned on him, or rather, all of it dawned on him. The what the fucks sort of cleared up. And what they left unveiled was just so… so completely, completely horrible.
Draco faltered a little on the explanation. “I just – it’s not like I can forget about it, you know. After everything that... and besides, a mark on your skin is always there, a constant reminder. And I just… I don't need it. I won't let imprison me any longer. I don't want it on me.”
do. Was Potter really going to be all right? Was there something else that needed to be done for him, something that Draco should really be able to think of, something he’s missing? His exhaustion, now returning with a flourish, made it rather impossible to say. The elf says he’s fine, and the elf knows what he’s talking about, so Potter has to be fine.
“He should have received another dose hours ago – “
Harry’s face became quite a deep shade of red. “Are you sure you want to practice now? On your birthday?”
“And what about the other fella?” the one next to him asked. Harry took no time to think about it, though he was surprised, and nodded.
After what must have been forever, the food was gone. A light cough startled him into attention. “Draco, have you noticed anything… unusual today?”
He tensed even more. “Yes.”
, he almost expected his answer to pass.
Potter slammed the table so hard Draco jumped. “No. They won’t. You’re lying.”
“What? But of course I’m not. He didn’t even turn me down; I never offered him anything."
But the sound he was waiting for never arrived, and it took a couple of breathless moments before he could grasp the reason why. Harry had covered Teddy’s mouth with one big hand, his eyes wild, Teddy looking curiously amused. The rest were all quiet.
“You cannot stop me from seeing her,” he said with all the conviction he could manage. He knew, naturally, his father was well able to stop him. But still it felt like the right sort of thing to say right now. He had forgotten all about Weasley – about Granger and Harry still searching somewhere in the castle. Only his father stood in front of him now, only he existed. He hated him as much as he feared him. He feared him as much as he loved him. He was full to the brim with nausea.
Gods, he never stood a chance, did he? He should have known his defences will crumble against him. He could never withstand those green eyes, even if it would get him killed, which it most certainly will at this point. Who the fuck cared about that? He would have torn himself open with his own hands, clawed himself from head to toe if Potter asked him to. Potter was here. Potter cared about him.
Harry opened his mouth to say something, but then he shut it quickly. He could think of nothing, nothing at all. The horror in the words said so casually was too much to tolerate. He was afraid if he’d open his mouth again, he would be sick. “Malfoy, I’m… that’s awful,” was all he managed in the end, after about a minute of stunned silence.
? What was he, some love-sick puppy-eyed buffoon? What next? Writing a
– it was almost normal. Potter struggled a little to eat , Draco could tell, but he did his best not to let it show, and to keep the atmosphere pleasant. He made excessive jokes about every and any subject he could think of (Draco didn't understand the one about the tractor turning into a field*. What type of transfiguration spell would work on such a large scale? Also, what the hell would be the use of that?) and spilled juice all over his bed in his excited chatter about nothing in particular.
There wasn’t a really good answer to that, only that he was. He just... was, and he didn't think too much about it. Nor did he think of what Potter said about Him – not for a minute, not even a second. Suggesting that He
“I’m sure it’s open. We could do whatever you like, Draco. These two options, or something else, anything.”
Dumbledore sighed. “That does explain it, yes, to some extent. While your mother held the connection between you open, using your blood – as you are kin, I suspect she was able to intercept and take the effect of the shield spell herself.” His next words had to be a reaction to Draco’s face, because he looked positively sick: “I do believe it was her choice, though. The magic didn’t do this to her. She took it to save your life, just like you risked yourself in order to save her. I think balance was kept in a truly fascinating way that evening.”
So anyway, he was taking walks. Draco was always reluctant to go – every single time, without fail – and always felt better when he returned. It was some sort of a circle, but maybe not entirely vicious. He kept walking, and that was some sort of progress, he thought.
“No, no, I’m pretty certain it was. I mean, I don’t know for sure, though. Might have to… might have to do it again for me to be able to say.” Potter’s smile softened even further, the bloody
“No,” Draco squeezed his head between two palms, wishing he could somehow
There were no words to describe how he felt, so Harry settled for a kiss. He made it as soft and heartfelt as he could. “I love you,” he murmured into Draco’s lips, and felt the reply not only ghosting on his but also in him, warm, fuzzy, bloody great. He kissed him again. They could go on like this all night – who needs sleep? They could do this for the rest of their lives.
“You know, social events. Dates in public places. It was all complicated enough before, but thinking that Ginny will have to see the pictures splashed all over the Daily Prophet – so I kept it as low key as I could. Hell, the last year I was probably only on about two dates. They were both the most stressful evenings of my life. And that's taking into account the time I faced a ten-feet tall Acromantula way deep in the Forbidden Forest.”
“And what about the time you said my hair looked girly?”
Apparently, it wasn't very long.
He couldn’t fight the horrified gasp. “He tortured you to find out information about me?”
going to think about that. No, not at all. What he needed to do was to concentrate on the cock currently in his mouth alone, on the fiery love in the brown eyes he witnessed. To only think of this man, the man who held him, the man he loved. Not a thing more.
He gave a quick nod. He’s heard about therapists from Him, actually. There were all these psychological experiments that interested Him greatly, and – but he wasn’t going to think about that now, he won’t think of Him. “I – they deal with the human mind, don’t they?”
. First he killed one of his own Horcruxes, then he died on his own curse. Funny, right?”
“Yes, a coward! Using your ex-
when he himself was in shambles. In an instant Draco knew what made him so angry, furious even; it was that Potter was
The silence was longer this time, and Potter broke it very hesitantly. “You said other guards made you apologize. What for?”
“Riddle, Tom Riddle.” Harry’s eyes widened when it was evident the name said nothing to Draco. “You know, Voldemort? That was his real name.”
All right, so He lied to him about Grove not being dead. And Draco knew that they knew each other in the past, that they were… partners, something, he wasn’t sure of the details. And yes, he knew He murdered people – actually murdered, innocent people, for the most shit reason in the universe (him? To kill for him? A tub of butter was worth more). And you know what? He even learned that He was
There it was again, that almost overwhelming craze to wrap the blond in a tight hug. If he weren’t careful, Harry might find himself leaping forwards, arms held wide open. He blinked the mental image out of his mind. “I’m glad to hear that, Malfoy. Truly, I’m glad.”
“Yes, Potter, gods be damned – Harry, yes, yes – “
“Was it good?” he asked provocatively, although Harry knew he knew full well it was. Staring at him with disbelief, Harry could think of nothing else to say.
, but his face must have done.
“Is it something to do with the venom, Malfoy?”
was just evil. Potter wasn’t a bad man. Potter was good, the epitome of good, he was good in a solid form and Draco made him so angry that he left and he’d never return, really this time. It hurt too much to consider, so Draco didn’t think about it, not even for a moment. Not at all.
“He's been worried about you,” Selwyn jeered, and the three spells he cast one after the other only very narrowly missed him. Not that Draco did anything to evade them, really; Harry had to literally grab him by the waist and move him along, because he was simply frozen with fear.
This was, without a doubt, the worst he had ever felt. Upon returning to Gryffindor that night he told anxious Ron and Hermione everything Malfoy said, omitting the part where Harry used an Unforgiveable curse on him. He still couldn’t quite believe he did it; it was like someone else had taken control of his body somehow and did it using him. But Harry wasn’t going to fool himself; he knew full well it was him, fueled by his rage and feeling of betrayal. to find out he had such a dark side – was capable of doing such terrible things – was wholly rattling. He hadn’t slept a wink all night, and come Saturday morning he refused to go down to breakfast with the others. All he wanted to do was wallow in his sadness and pain and never see the light of day again.
Dumbledore’s nod was like an elbow to his stomach. Suddenly that odd night came into a completely different view. “I was under the impression he would tell you himself. I thought it might be best if you two spoke about it, without my interference.” Dumbledore’s eyes were large and mournful. “At this meeting with him, Harry, I had some very difficult questions to pose. I used Legilimency to the best of my abilities, and a little bit of Veritaserum too. I forced him, in a manner of speaking, to make his choice now; either go to the Dark Lord and attempt to reach you, or surrender himself fully and face the repercussions of his actions. He chose the latter. He chose you.”
the first part of the chapter deals with the emotional abuse and manipulation Draco's suffered, as well as his suicide attempt.
Draco’s dark laughter surprised him too. “Oh, no. He wouldn’t have infused the thorn apple with
So Draco did the only reasonable thing there was to do and got up from his bed, misgivings put aside, and all but dove into Harry’s. His duvet was thick and smelled like the lemony shampoo he used as body wash, and Draco inhaled it like a man dying of suffocation. He was, in a sense. Being deprived of Harry’s presence felt like suffocating, and it bade such terrible, terrible things for the future. Because if a few hours away from him at night were almost unbearable –
“Okay,” Draco said, and he thought he meant it, too. “That’s fine.”
Making his way with Harry to their room, Draco kept running his fingers over Harry’s wand, feeling the magic in it like some sort of revelation. It was a bit like being eleven again, getting his first real wand. A pure, magnetic kind of excitement. He had his magic back. Gods, was there a better feeling than this? He felt he could do near anything; confess his darkest secrets (check), let Harry touch him (check), slay a dragon, you name it. He felt powerful. Like he could actually do something, for the first time in possibly forever. Draco thought he was hiding it rather well, but it became clear Harry could see when they closed the door behind them and Harry deposited himself on his bed. His grin was almost like it used to be, so warm and genuine, only that much more exhausted.
Harry sighed sadly. “Are you sure?”
Harry didn’t hesitate for a second; his hand sent forward and landed next to Draco’s on the armrest, not touching him but very near. “Whatever happens,” he said, and he was so full of conviction Draco shuddered, “
“Well, as it were, my plan was simply to kill him. I had promised him, after all. I wondered if perhaps you had any objections to that.”
evening. Like a normal person. And Potter, with the way he kept looking at him… it was dreadful, an absolute nightmare. Potter made him feel warm. Potter made him feel there.
Draco shook his head, hoping for some clarity. None came. All he could focus on was one thing, and it seemed rather insignificant, but it was all he could manage to care about. “So you’re not… angry with me? For – what I’ve done?”
“I just thought… you know, to say hello.” His voice weakened. Hermione shut her eyes in horror.
Hearing Potter,
Right, that’s what they were. Magic dampening potions, of course. That’s why the cottage’s wards affected him less than they did the others, why it took so long to heal him. He nodded, a little choked, because now that he had it back, he felt like such an idiot for not recognizing the feeling of his
“Believe what?” Potter chuckled, following him into the kitchen and plopping down to a seat in his usual familiar way that annoyed and exhilarated Draco so.
“Yeah,” Draco’s mind was spinning slightly and he leaned against the wall for support, “he’s a real champ, isn’t he? So respectable. Having all his men here to fight one wandless teenager. Sounds like a frightening man.”
“Father,” Draco said for the third time, his mind frozen with fear. He stared at the familiar face, too astounded to say anything else. His father knows, he knew all along. He was a bloody fool for thinking otherwise. He should have foreseen this… stupid, stupid Draco, too numb and dumb to see clearly… He stepped right into his father’s trap, and now he brought Granger along with him.
Draco couldn’t look at either of them, and he still couldn’t look to his left where he was (not, couldn’t be) standing, so he stared at the door. He could see the
Which was a fair point, too. This was out of Draco’s hands. He would stay and be Potter’s for as long as the sodding idiot allows him, for as long as he can. How could he not? What on earth could he do against
“Okay,” he whispered, and Draco would have kissed him were he nearer. “Okay. Once Ron’s owl gets here and we know what’s going on, I’ll go. I promise.”
The man hissed something in return that he didn’t quite catch. “Tell me the truth, Draco. What is going on here exactly? Where is Potter?”
things, but alluding to them, the damned clever woman). And So Draco settled on the idea of taking walks around the cottage, where the wards were still meant to protect him. There was quite a large area in the surrounding fields and the little forest where he could go, and although he was far from enthusiastic, he brought up the idea one dinnertime when it was just the three of them.
Because he took Draco. It wasn’t enough that Harry had to give all of his bloody life to this – that he had to let go of his parents, of his childhood, of his godfather, of his dreams even – all of that was apparently nothing. No; in this ruddy world Harry also had to give the one thing that made him happy, the only thing that was ever his. And this was just not right. It was not done. And he will not let it happen, not as long as he could stop it. Right before the door he stopped to take a deep breath and assess his situation. Inside were about twenty five armed and trained murderers, topped by their megalomaniac leader. He was a clueless teenager, without a wand and on his own, with nothing to guide him but the raging screech in his head.
“Are you sure? Because I can stay. Honestly.”
“All right,” Harry said, out of options, and Narcissa gave them both her softest smile, taking Harry’s hand in hers. “All right, Draco. If it’s what you want, then… you’re right, we promised.”
“Is this what you used to follow me around the castle and corner me in highly uncomfortable situations?” Malfoy asked lightly. Harry went red, but the grey eyes were twinkling.
Draco. It took a moment to understand they even meant him; he opened his eyes, for he had two of them, and expelled a shaky breath. Slowly the impenetrable white began to fizzle into sharper detail. A face above him, one that he knew and yet could not place. Draco – that must have been his name – blinked. Even this small movement hurt.
“Malfoy – Malfoy, God damn it, wait a second!” amazed, Harry jumped after him, pulling him by the elbow as he tried to walk away. “I don’t understand, what’s wrong?” that was an understatement; the whole night was a complete fucking puzzle.
“No – you guys should take the cloak – “
Draco tried to hold as still as possible. He refused to let them see how they get to him. Yes, he was terrified, but unlike Grove liked to say all the time, he wasn’t a child. He was a man. Not a particularly brave one, but a man still, and he will sit with his back as straight as an arrow and pretend to have some dignity. Yes, that’s what he will do, because
Laughing with Potter – talking to him so freely – looking at him like that, letting him save him – it was so, so horrible. He needed to suffer for it. How could he do this, betray Him like that? How could he let himself feel it even for a second? He needed to be punished – but how can he pay sufficiently if there is no one there to do it? How to make up for the terrible, terrible sin he committed? In the end he fell to his knees in his corner and closed his eyes, thoughts buzzing around his mind and confusing him. It wasn't enough and he knew it. He had to be severely punished, monumentally so, he had to be
Since it was Christmas, they had a festive dinner in the Great Hall. It was the most bizarre event Harry had ever attended; there were only two professors, McGonagall and Sprout, and the nine students. They all sat around one small table in the center of the large room, and ate almost in silence. Harry couldn’t even look at Malfoy throughout the whole meal, since every time he met his gaze he fell into a fit of giggles. The food was as delicious as ever, but it wasn’t the same without Dumbledore laughing and pulling weird hats out of Christmas crackers. Harry was quite relieved when it was over and they could return to the comfort of the common room. When they walked in, still laughing at the terrified looks the younger students wore all night, they had a little surprise expecting them.
and Draco fainted again because his mind just could not cope with any of that. He woke up with Harry holding him tight, which was a thing, he supposed. Good or bad, he didn’t know. He didn’t know anything anymore.
“I – what – Malfoy, you’re alive!”
“You have nothing to be sorry for. Draco, come here? Please?”
“Yeah,” Neville chimed in excitedly. “Only this time we’d need to face some sort of attack, I suppose.”
“Oh, I don’t know if I’m – well, all right, I am good. It’s actually Mrs. Weasley who taught me how.”
Now he relaxed. “Yes, obviously a git. Draco, are you sure that this is okay? Are you sure it’s what you want?”
“This isn’t really about us, darling.” Mother smiled too, as if
The wet thing returned to gently touch his face, and Draco wondered blearily if He somehow forgave his manic outburst and was cleaning him again. But he sobered quickly – there was no chance in living hell He’d forgive so easily, not for something like
Harry watched quietly as his words were taking effect on the pale face. Malfoy lost whatever color he had, and he swallowed hard again. Harry waited. “All right,” he said in the end, lowering his gaze to the shaking hands intertwined on his knees. “Fine. I will tell you. But it’s not going to do you any good, and there’s really nothing about it that you will find remotely interesting.”
“I’m ready, yes.” In a manner of speaking, anyway. He looked at Harry fixing his own robes, ever so handsome all in gold, his best man outfit. The effect the bright golden shade had on Harry’s dark skin was mouth-watering, actually. Draco was finding it difficult to stop staring. Harry looked like some sort of ancient god, a deity, too beautiful to be real. His eyes never seemed more alight than they did just then when he looked at him.
