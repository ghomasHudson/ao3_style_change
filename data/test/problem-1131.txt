Harry bends his knees, trying to force some stretch into the fabric. He should never have let Malfoy transfigure his scrubs—should’ve known something like this would happen. “I can feel the denim on my skin.”
“I didn’t mean to,” Harry says, and the tears come. They finally come. Despair and rejection, shared history made liquid. “I didn’t mean to,” he says, to his empty kitchen and his cat.
“Handover in A&E is at five,” Draco says, looking down that long nose at him. “I know. I spend quite a lot of time there.”
“Took you long enough, honestly,” Ron says as Hermione puts the kettle on. “I’ve known you fancied him for years.”
“What on earth are you all thinking!” And Draco realizes he knows that voice; it’s an insufferable voice who thinks she knows everything. Someone who was always smarter. Always better.
Bodies are everywhere. Dead eyes staring up at him in the Great Hall, corpses on the Quidditch pitch, Dumbledore broken at the bottom of the Astronomy tower and Dobby limp in his arms. White blonde hair covered in blood, pale lips blue. Bodies cold on a stretcher, bodies twisted by curses, bodies covered in angry gashes gorging into flesh. A body living in his chest, cold and sick and dormant.
“I don’t like when you know more about Muggles than I do,” Draco says, glum and still stewing in self-pity.
“You’re an idiot,” the other Harry says, pained. “One day, you’re going to show up and I’m not going to be able to—”
And Bella has pushed it to the very edge of the countertop, letting it teeter. One gentle tap, barely a push, and it will go clattering to the floor.
“—and then I went and fucked it worse?” Harry takes another long swallow of his rum drink, because this barely counts as cocoa anymore.
Draco moves away from the noise, heads straight for the kitchen, and seizes a large knife from the block. Voldemort lived in his home, his aunt Bella crept into his careless thoughts, and Draco had seen his fair share of horror movies. He will not walking towards an unknown entity unarmed.
This was not a phantom from another universe. He was not a Chosen One determined to save him—to save him and hate him. Not-Potter was looking at him like he was something to eat and it was so much more straightforward.
“Okay” Draco still chewed his lower lip nervously, but Harry could see that he had relaxed. Remus was soon attacking them both with a duster getting rid of the soot until Severus was calling them to attention.
“Come on, Harry, Draco I’ll take you to the great hall.” Diggory smiled looking like a muggle popstar and Harry gave him a grateful smile tugging Draco as Blackmore spat and shouted that he would get Diggory.
“You are nothing close to trouble, Harry, now how about a drink? We have pumpkin juice, or perhaps you would like to try a butter beer? You won’t have had one, Jinx!”
“Yes, mama, when will you be returning to England, Pants?” Draco asked as they made the way out of the palace gardens, once again going through the private gate. The street seemed to have less people now and it was easier to walk through but Harry stayed close to Draco.
“Um, I dunno, the will was actually a voice recording as was mum’s letter to Uncle Sev’ so yours might be the same” Harry remarked and Remus pulled out his wand and muttered a spell causing the letter to glow bright green for a moment or two.
“This will be your doing Harry, she would never dream of giving me chocolate this close to bed time” Draco chuckled as he elf vanished leaving them alone. “She will be back in a moment but would you like me to show you around your bedroom? You will notice the four doors. The largest and the most ornate is the main door out of the room, it is the one with the two casts above it. That one near your bed leads into my bedroom. If you need me at any time of the night the door will be open. Of those two doors there the right leads into your bathroom and the left leads into your closet”
Those eyes, green as a killing curse and a summer afternoon, look at Draco in the mirror’s reflection. Draco’s grateful he’s not taking the full blast, grateful that it’s only a reflection because his knees are already weak. “So do you.”
Harry flings his ballpoint pen across the table, shouting, “don’t look at me like that. I’ll get to you later!” at his documentation before slamming the door behind him. It was a stroll. A casual jaunt through the hospital to clear his head. It has noting to do with Malfoy.
“No.” Harry has no idea why Draco is here, but he refuses to let him further into his life. And if there are no flat surfaces, Harry won’t be tempted to push Draco against them and—
As soon as the verdict had come down, Narcissa spirited Draco out of the room. “To the apparition point,” she had said. “Quickly now.”
“I thought of that, of course,” Hermione says, quiet but the sudden serious set to her brow settles the brewing tension between Pansy and Ron. “But then I remembered that there’s precedent for—” she chokes on the words.
“In this universe?” Draco’s voice is small, because it’s the question that holds everything together.
“Look,” Harry said, and Draco watched that chin slot into place, jutting forward Draco knew that Potter had made a decision that he planned to see through.
“Excellent literary criticism,” says Robertson. “In this graveyard, Hamlet stumbles upon the skull of the king’s jester and a man he once knew. Enter Yorick!”
But Pansy isn’t cleaning. She’s gathering all of the little vials, setting each of them back into the box. “What are those?” Harry asks, because there must be dozens.
The man is enormous, and Harry’s not sure how he missed him standing there beneath the open window, fingers stroking the spines of a title resting on the ledge. Two shaggy eyebrows arch into question marks. “You don’t look like much of a reader,” he says to Harry, who, for a moment, wonders if this should be offensive.
As his feet clack against the industrial tile, it occurs to Harry that he may be slipping back into dangerous patterns. The rationale for discovering what Malfoy is up to is much thinner at twenty-three than it was at sixteen. But Harry’s feet have carried him to the correct wing of the hospital and it would be a waste to stop now.
“I don’t know what I did.” Harry flops onto the dirty tile. A chair seems like too much of an effort right now, and it hurts to sit. Harry hates that it hurts to sit; it makes him feel used. Ashamed.
. Still wobbly from whatever had been in those shots, Draco pulls his cell phone from his back pocket and tries for a text.
Draco thinks, and barely resists making a public display, internal logistics of the universe be dammed. But he doesn’t, instead forcing himself to be content in the delicious red flush up that long neck.
“Oh, I don’t know,” Pansy says. “Perhaps it was the phrase ALL BY MYSELF, booming over and over so loudly that I could hear you from the street?”
It’s a plea and a prayer that builds until Harry is begging and Draco is moving and their bodies stop fighting and surrender to a tandem that ruins them both.
After a moment, and with very clear sinuses, Harry says, “I think we were actually good. For about a day, and then he went and fucked it—”
“You were like this,” Harry says, words unvarnished and he should be terrified, but he can feel Draco’s panting, breath warm on his cheeks and fear feels impossible when he’s this close. “I thought you might kiss me...”
pulsed behind the metal doors and Harry hated that song almost as much as he hated the panic attacks. The night air was tinged with an edge of cigarette smoke and Harry felt his heart start to slow. “Not dying,” he whispered, and looked around.
They are clinging together when the curse comes for them. They tip over the edge of the world, tumbling through a yellow ocean and a light at the top of the stair, across fields of snow and a tightrope between life and death.
“Potter, if I have to listen to details of your sex dreams, I will hex your balls off,” Pansy says and Harry flinches. Then he blushes.
“Look,” Ron says, collecting their empty mugs and dumping them in the sink. “Just find him at work tomorrow. Talk to him. It’s honestly not that complicated.”
“Ugn? Well, you stop calling me Potter, we have another shower and then we think about it. Next time though I probably wouldn’t want it in a pretty public shower” Harry answered sheepishly looking around the pretty public space they were indeed in. The words seemed to stir something in Draco who blinked slowly saying; “Next time? So you intend for there to be a next time?”
“It will be okay, Harry, I promise” Draco whispered before going to the stool and sitting down. The hat slid over his eyes and Draco heard its voice in his mind.
“I...A spell like that, it must be based on influence, and the Malfoy’s have had time to influence...”
Severus regarded the students with a frozen bored stare his eyes dark and unreadable. The response from almost all the students wasn’t as warm as it had been for the other teachers and Harry felt a twinge of sadness for his father. He knew Severus wouldn’t care, but Harry knew how long and hard Severus worked to make the potions for the school as well as his own lesson plans. “Next to Professor Snape, is Professor Quirrell, some of our older students may remember that he acted as our Muggle Studies teacher, I am glad to say that this year he has re-joined our staff as Astrology professor.” As Sinistra spoke the name of the turban wearing man Harry’s eyes drifted over. He was a pale nervous looking man who had a visible twitch in his left eye. He looked around the hall for just a fraction of a second before turning his attention to his plate. Harry couldn’t bring himself to look away from the strange purple turban that was coiled neatly around the man’s head.
“Harry, those that matter know, those that don’t, well they simply don’t matter. My mother made me realise that. I have always been a Malfoy Harry; I have always had people like Albright thinking the worst of me because of it.” Draco informed him with a careless shrug his voice causing his chest to vibrate loudly. Harry had already known this though Draco had never gone into much detail, Pansy had told a few stories about her own childhood and the bullying she had received, and he had guessed Draco had had much of the same. It was hard to hear his friend talking about it though and he rubbed his nose lightly against his chest. “The first time I had something like that happen was when I was younger, about five, mother took me to a park, I wanted to play with some other children, their parents wouldn’t let me play with them. They snatched them away. I remember crying, I was only incredibly young, I didn’t know about the war and the dark lord or why adults hissed at me. Mother found me crying holding my Pigmy puff stuffed toy in the middle of a now empty playground. I sobbed as I told her what had happened, and she told me that I wasn’t to blame. Mistakes in the past cast shadows over the future. It wasn’t fair, she said wiping my eyes, and I wouldn’t understand for a long time but one day I would have friends who wouldn’t care about the shadows. The next day I was introduced to Pansy. Growing up I always thought I would only have friends with ‘Dark’ children. Then I wrote to you and you became my greatest friend. I don’t need the world to like me, Harry.”
“Can...Can we do it now?” Harry asked sounding calmer than he had done for the last few minutes but Narcissa continued to hold him “Please, I can  do it...”
“That was amazing mother” Draco announced as Harry sent a punch square into the face of the Dudley dummy. His green eyes flashing with such delight that Severus could see quite clearly that the boy had needed this. “Way to go Harry!”
“Master Draco sirs" A simpering high pitched voice said after there was a loud crack of self magic. Draco tried not to frown at the strange elf, he had always been an odd creature even the other house elves tended to avoid being with him if they could help it.
“I’m a Kitsune crossed with a Yuki-Ona…” Nino explained with a smile when it was clear that neither of them knew what she was. “A fox spirit and a snow spirit. Hey Sho! Where did you vanish to?”
“Lord Malfoy, Heir Black-Potter, welcome, I’m very happy that we have finally been able to  sort the matter of your key” The half goblin said with a jerky bow. Harry remembered what Lucius had told him and bowed enough to expose his neck. The goblins liked that and respected you more if you followed their customs.  Even a half Goblin like Tormuld was grateful for the display “I am so very sorry that it has taken us so long, but I have it here now and I was able to visit your vault and find the item requested by Lord Malfoy. Unfortunately, Mr Dumbledore is mentioned on the will and will need to be present at the reading”
“He used an unforgivable on my father…The floo was blue. You two can go first” Draco said softly wanting to talk to Harry for a little alone. The twins seemed reluctant to leave at first but then stepped into the fire calling out the name of the stadium. They vanished almost immediately and Draco looked at his friend. “You okay Harry?”
Severus shuddered to think of how many howelers he must have been receiving and hiding from Draco and Harry to keep them happy. Lucius was nothing if not stubborn and he would not shy away from them, but it took its toll. Coupled with his worry for Harry it was little wonder that his friend didn’t have a few dummies of his own that he wanted to hit. Somehow though the moment passed, sooner than it should, and the lord was able to give a genuine smile “But I believe Harry would be honoured to be adopted by you and he could not ask for a better father”
“I think I can eat something” Harry said though it was more or less a lie. The lump that had been in his throat had come back and he could barely swallow but he didn’t want to be sick in front of the people that were coming.
“Severus, I’m truly sorry for all that I did to you during our time at Hogwarts. Dumbledore told us what you did and honestly, I wanted to kill you but then I sat with Harry and I thought about it. I am still angry for what you did and if I survive, I will probably punch you at some point but then I would forgive you, eventually, probably, look I’m trying here. You didn’t know it would be us, but you know that it would be somebody...But I also know that I had a lot to do with the way you turned out and I am sorry for it Severus. I was a class A idiot, spoiled in the extreme...I’m sorry...I wish things could have been different between us, maybe if I had known that you and lily weren’t...no excuse, but yeah...Crap, Lily’s coming. Goodbye Severus...Live your life well, that’s how you can make it up to us, live your life better...”
“The sage, Harry,” Hermione says, gesturing to the dried bundles behind her. “Move into the centre of the circle and—oh! Don’t disrupt the salt.”
was a bookshop he’d stumbled into while questing for electronics. He’d been smitten from the very first.
“Don’t lash out because you’re secretly processing your fucked up feelings about Harry Potter,” Pansy says, but Draco ignores her.
“Are you planning on assessing that patient?” Horwood had gestured at the room where Malfoy was and Harry knew that he
“I know!” Harry had moaned like a beached whale with no hopes of ever returning to the sea. The pub moved around them, fuzzy at the edges. “What do I do?”
Harry had rolled over and opened one bleary eye. “Not depressed,” he’d said, throwing an arm over his face and trying to blot out all of the noise his two best friends had brought into his home.
…” The snake hissed softly back opening a lazy eye and peering at him as its forked tongue poked out of its mouth tasting the air around him. “
“Into the forest. Boris rode slowly to the edge of a dark forest. A hag was said to live within, a fearsome hag with long black hair and skin so dirty it looked green. Her fingers were as long as a mans arms they said tipped with black nails that were more like the claws of a beast. Boris the brave had always been afraid of the woods and dared not enter them even when his huntsman travelled into them to fetch wild boar. “I am Boris the brave” Boris said standing at the edge of the wood not feeling very brave at all. “I will go and fight the hag and take one of her nails back! It will prove I am brave” He said still standing at the opening of the woods not attempting to move forward. Suddenly movement to his left had him jumping with a shout that sounded so high pitched it might have come from a mouse. “”Who goes...Who goes there? Speak quickly for I am Boris the brave...” Boris called feeling as far from brave as he could possibly be but determined to be so. “Come out! Come out or I shall...” As he spoke a small mouse ran from the bushes and stared up at him with beady black eyes. The creature twitched his nose and waved his ears before scurrying off again leaving the knight bemused, embarrassed and shaken, glad that nobody had witnessed his fear he took a deep breath and marched into the forest...”
“Draco is better at it than I am.” He said with a flush aware that both girls didn’t appear to be breathing as they watched them with open mouths.
“You have such a high opinion of me uncle!” Draco pouted from the doorway jerked his head to look at his friend who had a mock hurt expression creasing his handsome face. “Actually I’m here with a message from father. The Goblins have finally gotten the key to Harry’s vault from Dumbledore”
OMG! It’s been weeks! I am so so sorry! I got sick and was once again tested positive for Covid 19. This time my entire body all but shut down.  My doctor thinks my ability to fight it was dampened by the sheer fact that a small part of me didn’t want to fight it due to what happened with my boyfriend.
“I still can’t believe Snape has a kid…Even an adopted one! And Harry Potter!” The boy over the other side of the table said in a rush while his friend nodded in agreement. The rest of the table were listening in but they weren’t be overly aggressive though Chao-Xiang looked as though she were about to fight both of the older boys if they didn’t shut up sometime soon.
Draco was sat on one side of the four poster bed in what was now Harry’s room. Only yesterday this room had been a plain brown colour with beige furniture now the walls were a warm but soft purple. The hangings around the bed were royal purple with gold trimmings as were the plush chairs beside the fire. The room was empty of personal touches but he was sure that Harry would soon fix that.
“It’s not your fault, Severus should have known better. He should have accepted Father’s word and memories”
“Yes, Lucius, have no fear, Narcissa you can put your wand away now, I will no longer harm Harry Black-Malfoy. But I cannot say the same for my employer. I am sure Dumbledore genuinely believes that he is doing it all for some unseen greater good but he is a damned fool” Severus huffed darkly as Narcissa began to fill his plate with some of the food from the table that hadn’t gone cold even as they were talking. “When I returned to the castle last night he was waiting for me, I gave him no answers as I had none to give but he won’t rest”
The Hogwarts Express was beautiful, with deep crimson plush coverings on the chairs and luxurious wood panelling on the walls. Although the train chattered and clicked on the rails it was a smooth ride and after about ten minutes of gazing at the scenery flashing passed the window those in their carriage began telling Seamus about their trip to Japan while he told them about his trip to Rome.
“Rightnen aways!” Jinx vanished with a pop just as the stream of light left Lucius. The potion master blinked and then swung around descending on Harry his wand raised. Before anyone had time to react Severus was hissing the spell and the light was now going into his head.
“I rarely sleep, but last night I spent most of it working on your potions, there is a lot of them but I trust that Narcissa will make sure you take them as you need, if you  find the flavours too bitter let me know I will change them to suit, have you given any thought to contacting Lupin?” Severus asked and Harry gave a nod looking down at his plate which was being filled with various food stuffs by Lucius.
“Oh, I wouldn’t, they loved it. They can’t wait to write to their mum and dad.” Seamus laughed before cracking a few jokes with Chao-Xiang until Madam Sinistra called for silence.
“If Harry is to be a friend then he should know the whole story and we will be friends, right Harry? I do hope so! It will be nice to have a cute friend for a change!”
“I think they sent us all the same things. Uncle Sev must have told them about the sorting.” Draco laughed pulling out diaries with the symbol of Ravenclaw on as well as new Quills with blue feathers with gold flicks. At the use of us Harry looked over to their friends at the Gryffindor table and saw that they too had packages with red feathered Quills.
“I don’t take as long as Draco, he takes hours.” Pansy said even as she was getting down from the bed and making her way back through the door to her room, which was Draco’s, not that he used it anymore.
“So, you think my True love is a Slytherin? Who raises rare birds? Who do you think it is?” Harry asked looking to the empty Slytherin table almost missing a pair of grey eyes and blonde hair that would normally automatically turn to glare back at him. He shook his head quickly refusing to even finish that thought. He was not missing Draco Bloody Malfoy. Okay, Hogwarts was a little emptier without him and he did have nice eyes.
“I have asked you not to use that nickname” He said knowing there was no heat in his words as he crossed the room to his sparse drinks cabinet taking out two of his finest glasses, gifts from Lucius one Yule, and set about pouring them both a half measure making sure it wouldn’t be enough to mess with the potion Remus needed to take later.
“You and Dad are always having challenges, Uncle Luci” Harry chuckled himself, knowing that the pair would turn anything into a playful contest. Even the crossword that came in the morning paper. They would race to finish it first. The guilt was still there but he could see that Lucius truly didn’t blame him for all the extra stress he was currently under.
“Hop on one foot” She hissed and immediately Kingsley did as she bid causing Bella to let out a wail of manic laughter while Narcissa cringed hoping the Auror would forgive her. “It has taken months of planning, years of ground work to build our names in the ministry but, we have done it. Lucius is in the Minsters ear, we have gotten Dumbledore out of Hogwarts, he is without friends…The time has come Bella, all is ready for the Dark Lord. All we need is a way to return him to his rightful place…”
“Mbali” Kingsley answered and Narcissa gave a smile looking up at the imposing man who seemed a little less imposing when speaking of his daughter.
“I don’t attend school. When I go to Hogwarts next year it will be my first time in a school situation, I was home schooled by some of the best tutors mother and father could get. Of course I have not been taught magic but mother and father gave me their old school books to read and Severus gave me a children’s potion set for Yule one year. It only included some none dangerous potions but Mother didn’t like me using it unsupervised. She can be such a worrier. I should tell you that she has written to Mrs Figg about you but don’t worry it is just formalities.
Harry relaxed his throat, the weight of Draco heavy on his tongue, saliva dripping from the edges of his lips, and had pushed. Draco had wanted more. Harry had given it to him.
“Harry?” Hermione says as he lands in the middle of the living room. It looks like a library threw up all over Draco’s fastidious decorating. “Harry is that you?” She’s papered over with dozens of stray parchments.
“Put that down,” Pansy snaps, dumping her purse on the floor and standing over him, pointy elbows on hips.
“Hmm?” he answers, not turning around. The gold in the fields reflect the bonfire in the sky and Draco closes his eyes and breathes. Just breathes.
“Typical,” Draco says, as Harry sinks into the chair next to him. “You bring your uncultured friends to the pinnacle of Muggle sophistication and they’re already embarrassing us.” Behind him, someone screams in genuine terror as another roars, “A FUCKING TARRASQUE, YOU’VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.” Draco ignores the disturbance.
Rain clings to Harry. It’s like he’s made of ink and his hair should melt right off, drip thick and squiggly. “I come here. All the time,” Harry says, not looking away from the street. Never looking up.
Hermione laughs and Harry chases the sound, tries to hold it. The collection of people around this table is unlikely—Harry still can’t quite believe how easy it all is. How all it had taken was a bottle of wine and a five-hour game of chess before Ron and Draco were draping their arms around one another, a writhing giggling mess of blond and red hair.
“You wouldn’t know shit without me,” Pansy snaps back, sharper and meaner than Harry. “I gave you your only clues. And cocoa!” she adds, and has the gall to sound offended.
“He wasn’t ever wrong,” Harry says, anger hot in his chest as he remembers Pansy’s face when she’d said, “he thought there was something wrong with him. Was obsessed with being better. With being good enough for this universe.”
Draco had not meant to follow Harry—he had never thought of himself as particularly obsessive. He was definitely not a stalker, not like Potter had been sixth year.
“Everything, I think,” Pansy says. “The curse, the words, the location where Draco found the stupid thing—”
“My wand,” Draco says. The world where he’d yearned for this moment when Potter would finally return it to him feels like a carbon copy of the horror he’s living now.
Suddenly, the whispers coalesce, startled back to life. They’re so loud and Draco doesn’t want to hear. He doesn’t. But he can’t make them stop.
“If you want to get your medical advice from your friend, be my guest,” Harry says, itching to get the man out of his office. This is his morning appointment and there’s a chance that Draco’s in his office and it’s easy enough to just walk over there. Harry knows where it is. There’s nothing weird about taking a stroll.
“I’m going to remove your skin with my tweezers,” Pansy says, tears in her eyes, before she crashes into him. “I was worried,” she whispers and it’s so vulnerable, Harry wishes he weren’t hearing it.
In the four months since he cast the spell, the curse had come for him a half-dozen times. When he considered it logically, Draco knew that the fingers that slipped between his and tugged him into another version of his life couldn’t be real—were just an expression of a spell in physical elements. Still, the touch felt kind, delicate. The curse talked to him and Draco could feel the honesty in the words—it was a magic that didn’t know how to lie. Draco squeezed her hand when she pulled him into other worlds and he went home with her when the story was done.
“It’s also a metaphor my dear boy. You can keep deflecting if you want to, but I think that whatever story is in your chest should be out.”
The fire burns soft in the grate, embers crackling into the silence. Draco pulls at the sleeve of his shirt.
“Excuse us,” Hermione says, tugging a curious Ron away from an intense Dungeons and Dragons campaign. Behind them, someone shouts, “Perfect 20! How do you like them apples, Kurt!!” The table roars in response. Somewhere, a pint crashes the floor.
“What are those?” Harry asks, looking for something, anything to distract from the fact that he’s here, with Malfoy, and filled with a want that he’s definitely not supposed to have. The wall behind Draco is enormous and covered in dozens of colouring pages. They’re mostly done in crayon, with a wobbly hand.
“It sounds like something worth doing,” Hermione says, inspecting a chickpea bobbing lazily on her spoon. “And I bet it’s quite the story.”
“I came to return your wand,” Harry says weakly, answering the words Draco hadn’t quite managed. He lifts one hand and gestures to a box, a deep walnut with images of whimsy carved into the top.
pulled into another universe,” He steps around the corner and into the room. “And I didn’t believe him and now he’s—”
He’s become so used to the universes twisting these two threads—weaving their story as the central focal point. Draco had always hated novels where the romantic subplot took over, subverted the driving force of the narrative. But that was their thing. These threads were what pulled the rest together.
“What conversation?” Harry asks, genuinely perplexed and still struggling to adapt to a Malfoy that’s not actively antagonizing him.
It’s fun, at first. Squished in between the windshield and the clutch, Harry smiles as Draco stutters his way through social interaction.
“Then?” Draco takes a breath to prepare for the plunge. “Then, I was in a pick-up truck driving across the Tundra with Harry fucking Potter.”
“I was at the market!” he bellows, a stray orange dropping from the paper bag with a pathetic thump.
“I know it’s a bit weird,” Harry tried again, feeling sheepish. “But I’m not trying to be. Weird, that is.”
“You literally cast a curse on yourself to try and figure out the if your soul was—how did you put it? Irredeemably evil?”
Harry thinks, as he babbles “I want” and presses back into Draco’s erection (“I need,”), writhes against the hands that won’t give him an inch (“More”), that hold him and Harry knows will pull every pleasure out of the places he’s never shown anyone else.
“Didn’t they run that headline ten years ago?” Harry says, trying for nonchalance. Draco’s never gotten used to the press, the microscopic attention honed in on everything that should remain private, blown up for the world to see.
Harry saw a flash of white blond and felt his pulse ratchet back up. Malfoy, tangled in an urgent knot of limbs and lust with a stranger, someone Harry didn’t know but who Malfoy seemed to. Intimately.
“And you expect me to welcome this criminal element into my shop without knowing you personally, vetting your credentials, or surrendering to my preconceived notions of you felonious types?”
Draco tells Pansy that it was like fate had wrapped herself around him, slipped her fingers between his, and
“He was going on about something called horsepower?” Draco looks up at Pansy, eyes beseeching her sympathy. “I think I drew fairly logical conclusion.”
“I didn’t try to die,” Draco snaps, because it really hadn’t been his plan as he wandered the streets towards Archway Bridge. Feelings swirl in his exploding skull—blonde hair dipped in blood, full lips kissing his neck, strong shoulders looking out over that hundred-foot drop, a boot on his neck and the wind in his air as it screamed across the Tundra. Stepping off into something else, something easier. “It was more complicated than that,” Draco whispers.
“Sure,” Amber says, and Harry can see her backing out of the door. Slowly, as if retreating from a predator. Which she is, in a way. “Sure.”
okay?” Pansy is a sneaky sort, moving softly through the flat. Draco suspects she’s spent however many days since the funeral walking on the tips of her socked toes, treating Draco much like she would his old boom box, easily startled into explosions. Until she’d spoken, Draco hadn’t known she was there.
Draco wanted to dissect it. To pin his selfishness to the petri dish, to watch the skin of his ambitions pull off muscle, to wiggle the tendons of his cowardice with the tip of the scalpel. To conduct the autopsy of his mistakes.
“Of course,” Robertson says, seriously, and Draco wants to bash his skull into the countertop. Sarcasm rarely pierced Robertson’s armour. “I woo it, Draco,” he says with a wink that leaves nothing to the imagination. “I speak to it the sweet nothings of poetry and wit, now lost on this generation of hustle and bustle.”
It’s 2003, but Harry can’t help but feel like he’s back in 1998. Harry hadn’t asked for much—just that Draco stay this time. Of course, when has anything they've done ever gone to plan?
The sigh feels like he’s spitting out his insides. “If I’m good, if I’m bad? It doesn’t matter, Pans. Nothing changes.”
“He does what I do now. He was a crisis worker. He was…” Draco swallows. “Kind to me when no one else…well, he was kind and I thought, this…this is something worth doing. This might be able to fix things.”
The air is even cooler, the wind blowing his hair across his forehead. He feels the strands catch in his lips.
Pointy features have become sharp angles, sneers have softened, and Malfoy is grinning at him. With teeth. It’s all a bit much.
The night sky washes the scene in a black and white filter. Harry takes in the familiar street, the slant of the house—his house. A few feet away, atop the front steps of Number 12 Grimmauld Place, blood pours from Draco’s chest.
Draco considered locking the honesty away, but he was so cold and Potter’s voice was so earnest. Eighteen years of pure blood breeding and Potter still—always—had him undone.
Malfoy drags Harry to the precipice of a crumbling staircase when Harry forces him to stop. “What if Emma doesn’t want me?” Harry asks, years of living as quietly as he could catching up with him.
Draco takes a few long, wobbling strides, feels destiny hum through his blood. “I knew I’d be back here,” he says, lifting his head to the sky and closing his eyes. “The lines got tangled and this is a part of my story now.”
The wind rolls across the canola. For a moment, Draco contemplates wading out into the yellow sea and drowning in the blooms.
The shock rushes through Mike’s body, and his eyes fly open. “Sweet merciful Jesus!” he yelps, and a few laughs stutter out. Tears are streaming down Frieda’s face as she smiles at her husband. “I felt that go through me. Down to my toes, I felt it!”
“I think eccentric is a generous interpretation,” Draco says, and the stranger smiles at him. It’s all teeth and goodness.
. Pansy had come with him to the Muggle shop, had said she felt like a Mr. Bond from the film they’d watched a few weeks ago when they’d purchased the camera. “For surveillance,” Pansy had whispered, looking scandalized. It had all felt exciting at first.
“What then?” Harry asks, stepping closer, wondering briefly what would happen if he were to reach out and touch. “Try being direct. I’ve heard it’s quite a concept in the modern world.”
, Harry thinks absently. But they’re both close enough to Malfoy now that Harry’s name must have slipped through the open door. Or maybe they had always been so caught up in each other’s gravity that Harry’s proximity was enough.
Now that the action has finally slowed, Draco takes this opportunity to look around. The curse rarely dropped him into a situation he couldn’t handle, and Draco had learned to look for clues. The first hint stands out in an enormous sign above a clean shop—modern looking with green siding. APOTHECARY, Malfoy reads, and this universe starts to shift into place.
. Malfoy got a shot at a life bigger than war trauma and reparations. Harry knew he should have been happy with the outcome. But as he pushed through the crowds of people, the shouted questions, the camera flashes, all he could think about was the way Draco’s skin had felt under his fingers. The way that grey eyes had pinned him in place. The way that his dead flesh had felt warm for those few moments when Draco Malfoy had been paying attention to him.
“What on earth has you in such a tizzy?” she says, brushing soot from her shoulders and dumping her ostentatiously large bag on his countertop. Bella sluices out from beneath a piece of furniture—Harry has no idea where she hides, but suspects that it’s some kind of high powered cat-lair, where she plots how to best make him miserable—and hops into Hermione’s lap.
Harry sheds his insecurities like a second skin. It’s always been this way; he’s always worked better in a crisis.
Draco knows this face. Its inches are as familiar as lines on a map. He knows the wrinkles and the shade of his lips after he’s been kissed by tender violence. He knows the muscles under that skin and the spectrum of green alive in the threads of those irises. The addition and subtraction of a quirked lip or a stern line can add up to love. In every universe except for his own, on the face of every version of Harry Potter but the one who matters. Except—
Harry hadn’t had an answer for that. So he’d tried to let it go. To forget that Draco Malfoy was out there somewhere, and Harry couldn’t find him. Off kissing strangers and getting publicly mauled and Harry didn’t care because it wasn’t
Harry surrenders. “Fine,” he growls, rummaging for her food and then throwing it into her dish with far more force than necessary. Flecks of brown mush stick to the backsplash. “Now leave me alone—” Harry’s ravings are interrupted by a loud ping.
“No,” Harry chokes, really chokes, because he can’t breathe. “Oh no.” Vials and dirt and air. Harry doesn’t know how he gets to the floor, but his hands are pushing soil around, trying to scoop the plant back into the pot.
“Would I have been different? Better? If things had been different. If I’d been brave, just once. If I’d made one good decision, been kind instead of selfish. If I’d been born in a Hobbit hole under a mountain and no wizards ever came to bother me—”
It hadn’t been what he’d meant, when he’d asked to hang out. A dozen invitations had died as drafts, never to be sent to their destination. Harry’s two days off had passed, and he’d not found the courage. Here, as the day ebbs away the midnight sky blinks down at him, Harry finally asks for what he needs.
“NOTHING!” Pansy roars. Legit roars. The windows shake beneath her rage and they’ve got three panes of glass. “You had the shit kicked out of you by a literal mob!”
“Who you got there?” asks a girl with a fringe cut high on her forehead. There’s two red spots on her cheeks.
But Malfoy was true to his word. He hadn’t attended any of the fancy pure blood fundraisers. He never came back to the club where his father and his father’s father had stirred their money into magical society and watched it simmer.
Harry thinks as he stares at Malfoy brushing hair from his eyes. But they come anyways. The memories always have, with Malfoy.
This universe has left them both scarred, Harry realizes as he follows the memory up the stairs. Draco’s body is twisted with the white brands of dangerous days—a raised ugly thing above his heart, nicks all over Draco’s hands and two angry looking tears across each of his shoulders. This older version of himself is no better, mangled by what his healer training tells him are dark curses designed to wound with permanency.
“What then?” Draco says, voice unrecognizable. “Do you enjoy seeing me low, Potter? Suffering for my sins?”
“I do,” Draco says, knowing it’s an empty promise—the chances of Robertson running into Potter are miniscule, even without considering Potter’s aversion to the written word—but taking him up on the offer anyways. Robertson means well, even in his eccentricities. “Ensure that he’s equipped to woo me properly, will you?”
“I can’t believe Potter!” Pansy greets him with a shout, tapping her acrylic nails on the tabletop. Pansy chatters non-stop about how horrible the Muggle world is, how slow and dirty and inconvenient. And then she turns up with fake nails and, today, with frosted tips.
(a brilliant fic that I love more than Pansy loves nail varnish). It's a wonderful read, if you've not experienced it already <3
“What’s wrong with you?” Draco says, and his face narrows in concern. “Has someone cursed you? Is that why you’re like—”
, Draco thinks. Even years later, the memory of Potter in the middle of the Wizengamot, green eyes hard and flat, “
. It’s a strange universe, he supposes, as he lets his eyes drift over to the man sitting across from her.
“You can’t just walk into my life and stomp all over everything. You can’t just show up at my trial. You can’t…” Draco feels blood in his ears.
Back in 2003, Bella destroys Harry’s kitchenware and Harry pretends that he’s not stalking Draco Malfoy (sure Harry).
The slip into his last name seems to stun Draco; Harry watches him flinch and then scramble to recover. “Harry,” he says, in the same voice he’d used last night. “I can explain.”
“But he’s scheduled to be here,” Harry says, mania rising with each syllable. Flo is holding four tiny needles and looks ready to put one through Harry’s eye.
The man in front of him is built like a pit bull and is looking at Harry like he’s the world’s biggest joke. “Are you sure? Cause I’ve talked to my friend who’s a chiropractor and she said—”
He’d been so lost in the sting streaking through his toes, that Harry’d almost missed the gate swinging gently open.
“Of course not,” he snaps, and the fury is back. Does his own mother think so little of him? That he would beg for the saviour’s help? But then he remembers Potter, shoulders squared against the public who loathed Draco and the Wizengamot who wanted to make an example of him. Remembers Potter’s voice—low and even—when he’d said, “
“If you didn’t have hangover potion, you’d understand why no one else drinks those awful things,” Hermione says.
Harry stumbles out of Trauma Bay 4, jotting notes and admission orders onto Viola’s chart. The Emergency room is still squirming and alive, crisis after crisis unfolding in the partitioned rooms. Catastrophe in miniature. Contained and sterile and tragic.
“Yes, well, neither can I.” Draco frowns at her. It’d been disturbing, to realize that he vanished when he was pulled into another universe. Until that moment, as he’d sat with Pansy in front of his brand new telyvision and watched his body vanish on the screen, there was still a secret hope. Possibility had been prowling the more optimistic habitats of his psyche.
Someone from the highest benches above says, “The accused being present, I call to order the trial of Narcissa Cassiopeia Malfoy and Draco Lucius Malfoy, on the fifth of August, of the year 1998, into offenses committed during the Second Wizarding War, in which the accused allegedly harboured and housed He Who Must Not Be Named, committed acts of torture, knowingly participated in… ”
“Yeah.” Harry finally closes his eyes, leans in to the pressure of a thumb stroking his jaw. Something warm brushes, soft, gentle against his lips.
“Lucy doesn’t just see insects crawling all over her body, although that would probably be enough to drive each of you over the edge.” Malfoy is channelling the tight rage from behind his eyes into words. “She feels them. She can feel their legs scuttling across her stomach. Slipping on top her eyelids. Would you want to keep your clothes on if you had an infestation living in your skin?”
Potter moves through the chaos, magic spilling from his lips, through his fingers. A Death Eater dashes across the street, dark cloak rippling in the wind, wand out. Potter’s eyes twitch, he barely reacts, and the bricks beneath the Death Eater’s feet reach out and grab at his ankles.
The world realigns with a shuddering crack, as Harry’s knees collide with the smooth tile. The smell of sage and lavender burns his nostrils. Harry remembers that he has a body and that everything hurts just as he registers the smell of lemons and sweat in the hollow of a neck.
“Mione, c’mon!” Ron hollers, but he needn’t have bothered. Hermione is stomping down the stairs, her feet heavy with sleep, hair a wild halo around her face.
Ron is spreading a line of salt in a circle, operating under Hermione’s careful instruction. “Yes, that’s right,” she says, following behind him with a cloth and a small bucket. It looks like the kind of toy a child would use to make a sandcastle.
For a moment, Harry can’t believe he’s said it out loud—given voice to the things he’s not supposed and said them aloud in a world where there are consequences. Harry braces for the kind of tongue lashing he’d witnessed only moments stumbling into the office.
“No, no I’ve never had that specific problem.” Those socked feet have entered the room and are creeping closer to Draco.
“Moral support!” Ron roars, his hunger getting the better of him. “Don’t mess with the system, Parkinson. You’re the new element here. We’ve been solving mysteries together since we were eleven!”
“You know?” the stranger says, his confidence wilting under Draco’s confusion. “It depends on if you’re single?” The last word squeaks out.
It’s been four days since he’d apparated into Draco—and apparently Pansy’s—flat and he’s not slept more than a few hours since then. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t pull himself away from the memories, pouring bottle after bottle into the pensieve.
The noise rushes in, the volume turning all the way up. Screams, jagged and afraid, shouting that barrels through the air, the worried sort of shouts: “Martha! Where are you?” and “Look out!” and “they’re coming!”
“Pansy was just updating me on the situation,” Hermione says, crossing the room and leading Harry to a squishy accent chair.
the curse says. But Draco can’t. Not yet. Not until he’s fixed this. Until he’s taken this ragged draft of a man and redrawn his lines.
Those angry green eyes stretch wide, the fury in them blinks out, and Harry Potter is suddenly soft. His lips—that have kissed Draco until his cheeks were raw from the stubble—fall open. Draco hadn’t known this look for what it was—not at first—but he’d learned.
. Draco had fallen in love with him under the stars of a frozen tundra, in the throes of a haunted house determined to suck out his soul, in the middle of mystery of vanishing portraits and under the auspices of a thousand will they, won’t theys. He’d loved him in robes auror red and healer green. Muggle or magician. He loved every version of Harry Potter.
The night ends with Pansy on top of the table, beer bottle doubling as a microphone. Her feet are spread in what Harry privately thinks is an excellent duelling stance, the muscles in her throat flexing as she tries to match Celine’s superior French vocal range. “ALL BY MYSELF!” The table shakes under her furious attempt at the high note.
Draco had thought three exclamation marks a bit excessive, but he had not met her in the grass to tell her so. Instead, he’d owled her a time and a place deep enough in Muggle London that no press would catch on.
table. Pansy casts a subtle notice-me-not on it every few weeks to ensure they will always have privacy away from the “insufferable Muggle gamers.” Pansy’s knowledge of Muggle colloquialisms really has improved, Harry thinks, smiling as he spots the shiny black gleam of her hair. Thick liquid eyeliner traces deep lines on her dainty face and Harry realizes with no small amount of horror that the feeling in his chest is
Anti-death eater sentiment had hit a fever pitch. Since the gentler nature of Draco’s sentence and Potter’s public push for a leniency, there had been a dangerous shift in public opinion.
“What’s the point!” Harry had stood up. “What was the point of saving the fucking world if we’re just going to kill everything that’s left behind?”
“I…” Harry almost loses his nerve. But the words were poison and they needed to come out. “Malfoy,” he says, lowering his eyes. “I think I might fancy Malfoy.”
Draco follows Pansy’s skeptical glance around the room, and does feel that he owes her an explanation.
. The cab was far too small. Draco could feel the heat of his thighs where they’re pressed to the ancient leather. Warm air wheezed through the vents and Draco was far too hot.
“In every universe,” Draco says, teeth biting down on Harry’s bottom lip and sucking it into his mouth.
“Somewhere quiet,” Malfoy calls over his shoulder. “To drink this, I think,” and Harry remembers the wine in his other hand.
Harry opens his eyes, because he still has eyes that can look and hands that can hold, and realizes that he’s in a tangle of limbs in the middle of a circle made of blood.
Harry loses himself in the moments—his leg over Draco’s shoulder, the way Draco bites his bottom lip as he moves, slow and determinedly. Harry wants to look everywhere at once but he can’t and he wants to cry because it’s all happening at once and he can’t hold on.
“You do look a bit…” Ron trailed off, clearly reaching for a word that was kind rather than disparaging. “Well, you look a bit shit, actually.”
“Don’t worry,” Ron says, throwing him a knowing look Harry’s missed so much it’s ike a physical ache in his chest. “She’ll wanna be here for this.”
“That won’t be a problem,” Draco had answered, seriously. He’d learned early on that it was best to treat all of Robertson’s concerns with levity.
, revels in the feeling of hands on him and the smell of people who want him. Lights pounds his eyes but, fuck, everything feels so good. The tablets had been strange and it had all seemed like madness at first, but now—
“Set up a perimeter,” a familiar voice says, and Draco feels his muscles loosen, feels himself lean towards the sound. Inexplicably drawn to Harry Potter.
It starts with magic, but it ends with fists and feet. Draco is on the ground, can feel the pavement kissing his cheek. The blows land, one after another and Draco doesn’t cry out until a shoe connects with his nose and the world blinks white and then red.
Harry breathed a silent sigh of relief as they moved back towards the door. He was going home, Ron and Hermione be dammed. Night clubs were stupid and he’d almost seen Malfoy’s dick for fuck’s sake.
A warning for this chapter: there is some medical trauma (similar to Chapter 2), but with fairly overt descriptions of death.
“I can’t do this.” His words were greedily swallowed up. “I can’t…” Harry pushed blindly through the crowd. Move. They needed to move.
Each iteration of his name lands with more force than the next, waves gathering strength as they are sucked back to sea.  “
John nods. He has a thick head of brown hair and an enviable hairline. “Here to try and figure out if you’re safe to leave or if you’re gonna try and die again.”
Draco approaches the contraption and digs his fingernails into the drawer. “You will open,” he says through gritted teeth, “because I say that you will, and that’s” he yanks and strains, “final!” He lifts one leg up to the counter for leverage and pulls and pulls and—
“Malfoys walking free in Diagon,” says someone else. A fuller person, someone who’s cheeks aren’t sunken but who carries sadness between his shoulders. Atlas, balancing his tragedy on the knobs of his spine. “It’s wrong.”
Harry could see him swallow as the stranger started to kiss him there, could see his Adam’s apple bob under a pair of lips.
Amber does not sound like she knows what placate means. “Thank you for your commitment to excellence. You’re doing great work. Honestly. I’ll take think about what you’ve said.”
Harry think, as he lifts his hand to knock anyway. Self-preservation had always fled the stage whenever Malfoy was due to feature.
It turns out, Pansy’s solution to his public flogging is to abandon Wizarding London altogether. For a moment, Draco’s too touched to feel anything else. But it’s only a moment.
“This is serious!” says Pansy, and Draco realizes, a bit belatedly, that Pansy is distressed. That she’s barely holding herself together.
“Aren’t you supposed to be smart now?” Pansy says, and yes, Harry’s definitely going to hit something. “It’s just a collection of potentially observable universes that represent every possible future in every possible world. Obviously.”
Draco looks up for the half-dozen multi-coloured tablets he’s just poured onto the plastic top of his record player. “It’s not candy,” Draco says. “I don’t think.”
Harry hadn’t believed him. No one would just leave the magical world behind. Especially not someone like Malfoy, who had lived his entire life steeped in pure blood traditions and the mantra of magical superiority. Harry had let him go.
The canola fields sway in the afternoon wind and Draco stands at the edge. Behind him, a 2002 Renault Mégane coupé is parked on the side of the road, with this universe’s Potter asleep in the passenger seat.
A content warning before you dive in: suicidal ideation features in one of the scenes, so if that's a trigger for you, please consider skipping this one <3
“Well, since I am the authority on Shakespearian tragedies, I assure you, this cabbage is the spitting image of Yorick.” Robertson grabs hold of the cabbage and lifts it up to his nose, as if attempting to make eye contact. “I was tempted to recite Hamlet’s speech, when he seizes upon the skull of a man he’d once known and reflects deeply on the inevitability of life and death. Upon how we all go to rot, king or jester, nobility or peasant. Of how death will come for every man. There is no escaping it.”
“I suppose, given your sordid history, you may not know that force is not the only way into the interior of very ancient cash registers,” Robertson says, looking down at Draco’s sprawling form on the floor.
“I’m sorry,” Harry says. The truth of it is too heavy; he’s alone now. The last Malfoy. He’s never been very good when left on his own. “I’m so sorry.” An apology is not enough because it won’t bring her back.
“Well,” Draco says, brushing the dirt from his knees and massaging his throat. “This world is going to be interesting.”
Water presses his hair flat against his face, drips into his eyes, soppy and a fucking harbinger of futility. A metaphor for his entire fucking existence.
A touch that hovered just close enough make his hairs stand on end, but not enough that it had felt like anything had changed.
The Yaxley manor went up in flames. Antonin Dolohov was beaten within an inch of his life by twenty people in front of the Three Broomsticks. Celestina Warbeck put out a single called
“I don’t know—” Harry spins in place, gasping. There are books and antique lamps, throws and plants, shoes and Harry’s spinning, the air is coming, faster and faster. He can’t breathe, his head is white noise and panic. Because he’d only just started to know him, and now he’s gone again.
“Then what’s the point of you?” Draco asks, and it’s only once the words have left his lips that he realizes he’s being quite rude.
, for some reason, you wouldn’t have fared any better,” Draco huffs. “He’s worn me down with his persistence. That’s all.”
“No,” Harry stumbles. “Never tried.” His back presses tight against the wrought iron curling around them.
The mess is his fervour boiled over—violent urges that roared in his ears whenever Malfoy completed his orbit into Harry’s atmosphere. He’s ashamed of it. Of the uncontrolled ugliness of it.
“It’s such a waste,” Hermione had said, sighing into her coffee cup. Harry was sitting across from her, nibbling on a piece of toast. He’d graduated from the couch to the kitchen on occasion and Hermione marked this a victory.
Strings of light exploded from his wand, plain and colourless and Harry waited. The air smelled of iron and frost and Harry blinked over and over—tried to banish the red spots from his vision.
“Me? Make fun of you?” Malfoy’s lips twitch and for a second, Harry is sure they will share a smile. “I wouldn’t dare.”
“You’re being ridiculous—” Hermione tries to divert Ron’s attention, and Harry appreciates it, but he’s already opening his mouth.
The bell jingles behind an elderly man, who’s tottering out of the shop underneath a pile of books. Draco is becoming quite proficient at this whole
The first time Pansy doesn’t notice him was innocuous; it could have been the noise in the gaming café or the distractingly fit bloke trying to charm her at the bar.
Draco lets the words wash over him. He still doesn’t look up. The world will see him, they will look at all he’s done, and they will judge. There’s nothing for it now.
, he thinks, but only briefly. There’s a pressure building behind his eyes and he decides that tonight he doesn’t care who he’s supposed to be or who he’s supposed to want.
doing here?” Pansy closes her eyes, mutters something under her breath. “Potter, you hideous wet sock, I live here!”
Going out had been one of Pansy’s more horrible ideas. “But we’ll all be there,” Pansy had argued. “Blaise, Theo, even Daphne! We won’t let anything happen. It’ll be completely safe.”
A bald head spins around, and the expression on the face attached is rouge. “Got a problem?” he asks, lips smacking on each syllable.
Any fantasies that he’d clung to were banished in that bathroom, the day Potter had carved him open.
“Fuck off, Malfoy,” Potter says, tucking that brutal face behind a mask of confidence. He strides away with the same easy confidence the real Potter had always managed, the wind making his robes dramatic.
Harry apparates into Draco’s flat, prepared for the angry end of a wand or the violent end of a fist. He finds neither.
“Wait!” Harry shouts, sliding to a stop in the entranceway in nothing more than his pants, with  a ragged throw draped haphazardly across his shoulders.
“Not to worry!” Draco says, mania spilling over. “We’ll be all over the front page of the Prophet. What luck. You’ve always loved that.”
Harry comes with Draco Malfoy inside of him, green eyes meeting grey, pinned in place by desire that’s raw and desperate and
“It’s how I show affection,” Pansy says, and she’s off before anyone can say a word or place an order. No one protests. Pansy’s done this before, and seems to knows what each of them will have to drink before they know themselves.
“Help me get her on a stretcher!” Harry shouts at the same time the waifish figure standing behind the seizing child lets out a single terrified scream.
“It’s weird, isn’t it?” Hermione says, and Harry hears her voice change, in that way it does when she’s talking about puzzles and ideas—it’s richer, a more vibrant shade of her. “You and Malfoy, both working without magic. I never imagined he would leave all of that pureblood nonsense behind. I wonder if he misses it.”
“I’m going to die,” Draco said, out loud again because he’s an idiot. But he was trapped in the cramped cab of a fucking pickup truck with The Boy Who Lived and what else was he supposed to say?
They’re nearly home now. The wind moves across the grass like a hand drifting over velvet—a soft touch against the grain. Draco feels it on his cheeks, feels the cold in the corners of his eyes.
Harry'd wanted to eat him, had done so later that night, looking up from his knees as Draco thighs shook. Harry nosed Draco’s skin, pressed his wet mouth in the hollow of Draco’s hips.
“But—” Harry’s desperate to turn over this one rock, to stare at the hideious underbelly of what they’d done to one another.
More often than not, Harry’s dreams were innocuous, simple in the way that a day in the life often was. Harry dreamt of nights on spent the couch, Draco’s head in his lap, and when he woke up, he could still feel how soft Malfoy’s hair had been between his fingers. He dreamt of farmer’s markets and flowers, of showers and the scent of lemon. Of kisses under a sky splashed white with stars, of road trips and fights and wedding rings.
“Feeling sorry for oneself isn’t really brave,” Draco says and then mutters, “I wish I was brave,” softly.
Draco’s breath is hot and Harry can hear it, can feel the grip in his hair tighten. Pinning him, his body pulled against the hard planes of another man’s chest.
“Drinks?” Pansy asks, hopping to her feat, eyes alight with villainy. Harry hates how much he enjoys her.
, Draco thinks. It can’t be, because it’s a memory. Draco remembers this night after Potter had cut him open. It had stretched long and lonely, the despair dark as Potter's horrible hair, because Draco now knew the  price for the crimes he’d planned to carry out. The cost of standing against the Boy Who Lived.
“I can get you some pain meds if you want,” the voice says and Draco chases it. Find the source a few feet away, lounging casually in a plastic chair.
“I can’t believe I’m doing this with a death eater,” and Draco had started to understand. Had known that he was a thrill and not a person. But Draco had shut Not-Potter up with his mouth and chased the stranger’s release to its peak.
“Merlin, Potter, are you trying to rough me up or help me?” Draco says, knows that that easy blush will light up Potter’s skin.
And then, “Have you thought of healing?” Hermione had said, offhand. Harry had seized the idea with single-minded attention, had sunk his teeth into the concept. Healing was the first thing since Malfoy’s trial that had made him feel alive.
“Wanted to send all the witnesses out, did you?” Draco tries for anger, but his composure is a loose hangnail and he’s pulling. The pain is ready to unzip his skin and let the hopelessness come gushing. They’re both going to leave this bloody.
And it’s all too much. The eyes, the whispers, the arrows. It’s all going to fall upon them, and it won’t just be Draco’s shame anymore. It will be Harry’s too.
“What? Why?” Harry turns back around, can’t seem to stop looking down down below. The cars are so loud, so fast underneath them.
“This was a terrible idea,” Harry said, but Hermione had dismissed his concerns, leaving him alone with the feline from hell.
Harry can’t believe how sharp Pansy’s words are, given the graveyard of shot glasses scattered across their table. “I’ve decided the posh one is my idol.”
The anger is back in Potter’s eyes, green as a killing curse. He strides towards them, red Auror robes flapping and Draco suddenly understands how this boy could have been the sigil of righteousness for an entire generation.
warmer since Draco moved in. “It’s because of my superior blood claim,” Draco had said as they watched the house slowly open itself up.
Draco caresses the ledge, presses his palms flat against the concrete railing. “I don’t want to die,” he says, and the crisp winter air balloons from his lips in a smoky puff. Pansy would call him a dramatic little shit, because of course he would narrate his own descent into despair.
The mystery is peeling away and Harry says the thing he always says when the world feels out of order. “I need to tell Hermione.”
“I thought it was entrepreneurial, but I see your point. After this miraculous virgin birth, enter Jesus. Who grows up, performs miracles and, I think he threw some gamblers out of a church? But I’m definitely playing fast a loose with the source material. Robertson would know.”
“We will consider your testimony and return with a verdict,” the man with the gavel says. “This court will recess for twenty minutes.”
Harry ignores her. “Do you think he…” he struggles with all of the concepts that’ve just been explained to him. “He got pulled into a universe and couldn’t get home?”
, Harry realizes as he catches a glimpse of her ID tag—perks right up. “He’s over in mental health.”
Bella swaggers across the counter and sniffs at Draco’s plate, nose held high in something that approaches feline elegance. Draco feeds her the corners of his toast.
Draco hadn’t drafted a memorial in the paper, although the investigation was made public and the Prophet printed the story anyway. He’d buried her in the gardens on a Thursday, with Pansy Parkinson and Minty as the only witnesses to his grief.
“That’s woefully inconvenient,” Robertson says, sounding genuinely distressed on Draco’s behalf. It’s touching.
Draco wonders if there is a currency for remorse. If his guilt guts him like the spine being ripped out of a fish, does that edge him closer to decent?
Which had nothing to do with why Harry had walked up to the manor, a small box in his hands, in the middle of February.
He could have made it, he tells himself, except he was in clinic most of the week and hasn’t run into Draco at all, and besides, who lets their lips almost brush up against his and then just leaves without a word?
“It’s probably your subconscious latching onto your suppressed adolescent urges,” Hermione has said once Harry had gotten the words out.
Because grey eyes snap up, and Harry doesn’t have time to run. He’s frozen in place. An object at rest in a world without gravity. Draco Malfoy vanished from wizarding society five years ago, and Harry hadn’t stopped him.
The ancient register is sticking again. Robertson insists on using an outdated metal contraption that could be confused with a torture device and whose handle refuses to budge on the regular. “Robertson,” Draco shouts in a vague direction—there’s really no telling from where the man will emerge. “The register is being contrary again. I need you to do whatever it is that you do and make it open.”
“Doesn’t want you?” For a moment, Malfoy looks at Harry like he’s a math problem. “Potter, are you trying to tell me you fancy Emma?”
The lip of the mug is chipped. Harry stares into the steam, watching it lick the porcelain, and Draco doesn’t say anything. The quiet is a kindness.
The desire for sleep presses heavy on his eyelids, but Harry knows the wounds will fester. Years ago, he’d have let them, but he’s not seventeen anymore.
All these years later, Harry thinks that’s what did it. His need to play the hero and save the day had dragged Narcissa Malfoy out of the grave, and he would have rejoiced if she had returned to the world as she’d once been.
“But nothing! This is so stupid.” Harry yanked the magazine out of Hermione’s hands and tore it in half. Let the glossy paper fall onto the checkered tile. “So stupid,” he said again, softer this time.
—Freckles, in abundance, with wild dark hair that looks a lot like Potter’s. The eyes, though, aren’t right. They’re deep cerulean rather than blinding green.
The rain is soft today, gentle in its assault on the windows of Grimmauld Place. Bella prowls the deep ledges, watching the drops wandering down the glass with suspicion and the occasional swat of a snowy white paw.
“When you wallow, you tend to spiral,” Hermione says, blowing on a spoonful of Harry’s taco soup. “And we’ve worked quite hard to bring you back to life.”
décor is uninspired and the air is a bit musty. Draco sets what the Muggles call a Cooler (and what Draco calls alcohol-juice) in front of Pansy and settles into his gin and tonic.
“But I’m just—” Harry had floundered and Draco waited, barely afloat himself as he rode this wave of fate and the lives that could have been.
Harry looks at him, and it’s not indifference or embarrassment, and Draco wonders if maybe he’d misunderstood, all those years ago.
“Have you only just realized you’ve committed to a length-yet-to-be-determined road trip with a Death Eater?” Draco tries for humour, but it falls flat.
Muggle music knocks around the empty walls, the sultry tones of Will Smith bouncing off vaulted ceilings.
“You’re mine,” Draco presses the confession into Harry with his tongue. He feels the moment when Harry gives himself up, body going soft.
“Please,” he says, and again, “Please,” but the word stutters on the pleasure, it’s so intense. He’s sweating and squirming. Draco kisses the inside of his thighs, and Harry has never been kissed there before.
Pansy drags him to the bar, her eyes all pupil, giggling uncontrollably. “Six shots of Jäger!” she shouts the order at the bartender, fighting with the music and a hundred other crushed bodies for his attention.
“You entitled little shit!” the man shouts, and this would’ve wounded Draco on any other night, because he thought he’d been quite polite.
A woman with a short grey bob and a set of knitting needles glares up at him. “Do you work here?” she asks, her tone crisp.
Unlike his father. If Draco ever saw Lucius again, it would be in chains. Lucius had been sentenced to ten years in Azkaban. Draco has no idea how to process this, and so he hasn’t.
,” he insisted, when Draco had wept himself dry after a jeweller had gone to the Witch Weekly about a ring he’d purchased. “
“Why don’t we focus on the more pressing matter of a grown man who thinks he can fly.” It’s becoming difficult to breathe. Draco rubs his calves.
The laugh that tears out of him bleeds at the edges. “In what universe,” Harry says, slow and furious and cold, “could I ever love you?”
“Because you were looking for a carpool? And I agreed to take you, because I’m way too nice, apparently?”
Harry shakes his head, slow, like it’s filled with water and not brain matter or grief. “You’re in joggers,” Harry says, knows that this is stupid, but his mouth isn’t listening.
“At least I don’t run away!” Harry roars back, because this is what they’re good at. Hurting each other.
It’s his last night as a free man and, while he will never tell her, there is no one he’d rather spend it with than Pansy Parkinson.
He was alone outside, in a large patio area, with tall fences and enough space for several parties to mingle comfortably. Harry crossed to the far corner and settled next to a large potted plant that Harry assumed was meant to be decorative but actually looked rather lonely. “I’ll keep you company,” Harry said to the plant, rubbing a textured leaf between his fingers. “Don’t you worry—”
“I will do so on my way out. You did very well today Draco don’t forget to keep practicing between lessons. You will never be the best if you forget to practice”
“You are welcome, Harry” Severus gave him a thin lipped smile and Harry flushed turning the vial in his hand noting that it looked like liquid silver as it caught the light of the sun that was coming in from the stained glass window. It was beautiful and he couldn’t stop moving it back and forth in the vial.
“No, but you will, and you will be great, you and Draco will make excellent fathers.” Luna beamed and Rolf’s laugh filled the cosy kitchen waking Lorcan with a whimper.
Thank you all so much for your kind messages. I read and treasured them all. The last week or so has been a blur as you can imagine. My boyfriend’s official funeral was last Thursday but of course I wasn’t able to attend. His parents have said that when we are able, we will have another ceremony so I will be able to say goodbye. It is very kind of them. I still keep waking up thinking that it has been a horrible dream and that he will phone, and everything will be okay
“I am as unsure as you are, my old friend. There is much we don’t understand about how Harry survived that night. He is the only person in recorded history that has survived a killing curse so we do not know what affects that might have on him…” Lucius answered sinking into his chair with a glass of straight whiskey gripped in his long graceful fingers. His head was resting against Narcissa who was lightly running her fingers through his hair. “I believe our best course of action is to find all we can on curse scars and their meanings. I can search the ministry records, you Hogwarts, Remus here in the manor and perhaps Professor Flitwick might be able to search the Goblin libraries. We should also ask Ninomiya about any Japanese magics that might help. I am also interested in his ability as a Parselmouth. It is a rare family trait after all and as far as I remember James didn’t speak it”
A/N: Okay I seriously didn’t mean to make this part all about Severus and Lucius and I’m sure it wasn’t very good but I like their friendship >.< Next part Lupin will be there for dinner and the hearing of James’ will for him. 😊
“Harry, I didn’t mean to upset you!” Draco said catching up with him and trying to grab a hold of his arm. Harry shook his head and then managed to give a half-smile that didn’t feel genuine. “I just…Thinking about them stopped me thinking about Aunt Bella. I don’t remember her, I was only a baby when she was carted off to Azkaban, however, I don’t think there is a witch or wizard alive that hasn’t heard the name Bellatrix Lestrange. She was the Dark Lords most favoured; she was also his torturer and she enjoyed it. Growing up all I have ever heard is how bad she was, witches and wizards would pull their children away from me because of Aunt Bella and my father. In my heart I can ignore the stories about my father because I know that he hated what he did, but Bella…She enjoyed it, she would happily do it…” Harry threw his arms around his blonde friend hugging him tightly as Draco started to shake. In all the time of their friendship Draco had been the one to comfort him but now Draco needed it and Harry was happy to return it. “In my dream last night, I dreamt that she killed you…I can’t lose you Harry, you’re my best friend”
“Morning people! Why do I have to be stuck with a morning person?” The mirror bemoaned his fate as Draco styled his hair with a little product. The blonde grinned at his own reflection giving it a wink as he replied,
“I was just thinking…How much I rather like the language of serpents when it is not being spoken by a madman” Severus smiled, or at least his face softened and his lips curled upwards, as he looked at Harry. It was a very Severus smile though and Harry could tell that he meant it.
“Okay, I will go first and make contact with the auror if it is safe then I will send blue sparks through the floo” Nino swallowed and took a pinch of powder her eyes closing as she huffed out the address and then vanished in a swirl of green flame.
“Enough!” Severus growled breathing heavily waving his hand so the will went still and silent. His face was coloured rather unnaturally, and his breathing laboured. “Potter…He thought I was better father material than Black? Potter wanted me…This must have been…Potter hated me…”
“Wakey, wakey little Master Harry, youse is being wanted in the Drawing rooms” Jinx said, and Harry gave a breath and reluctantly pulled himself out of bed. On his bedside table was a collection of items that Ernest had found for him. A quill, a bottle of ink that had rolled under the bed and he hadn’t been able to reach. A sock, a glove that he was positive he had lost in the maze at the back of the Malfoy house. It was strange to see the items there waiting for him every day, but he had gotten used to it. The first time he had woken to a dozen or more lost items he had been scared until he had remembered the Brownie and had quickly gotten some milk and honey and wrote a little thank-you note. Draco had promised that it wasn’t needed, and Pansy had laughed, but Harry liked to be polite. He rarely saw the Brownie about the manor during the day, however at night he acted out the stories of Boris the Brave in Shadows on the walls along with snow white for Pansy. “I has gotten the Milk and Honeys for the little Ernest, Little Master, Harry”
Urgh! For goodness sake…Hopefully it wasn’t such a dull chapter…But…I can only blame the second injection. God it takes it out of you but now I am fully vaccinated.
“Bless my soul! You look just like your mother!” He said with a squeak jumping back for a moment before apologising and introducing himself. Tormuld cleared his throat and then very slowly explained everything to the small Hogwarts professor. As they spoke Narcissa found herself studying the two half goblins closely wondering how common it would be for the two races to marry and produce children. There were a lot of likenesses in the pair. “Albus surely you can’t think that somebody was able to bypass the security of Gringotts and access the Potter vault when you had the key and  mess with the will record?”
“Are we going to get through this maze or not?” He huffed taking Harry’s hand in his and marching forward ignoring the laughter from his friends. Last year he never would have imagined that he would be friends with not one but two Weasley’s and a half-blood, then he had wished a happy birthday to Harry Potter and his life had changed direction dramatically and he was glad of it.
“Harry, do you need the bathroom?” Draco asked ignoring the rude boy who was causing the other two to look at Draco with suspicion.
“Then think bigger, yes, it will need a few tricky spells and wards but I happen to be excellent at wards as is Theodore for all that he is working as a robe maker” Draco shrugged gracefully his slender hands moving as he spoke and Harry found himself watching them wondering what they would be like moving over his body in the heat of passion. Neither of them had mentioned Draco’s comment from that first lunch however he could feel the tension bubbling away under the surface.
Urgh I am so very sorry for the lameness of this part. I rewrote this chapter so many times but it just wouldn’t fit no matter what I did in the end I settled on the adults figuring out how to help Harry…>.< I’m sorry it isn’t a good part…>.<
“Pants and I are like brother and sister. We tease each other all the time, but I love her dearly. She can be more than a little blunt but she has a heart of gold with it” Draco answered giving him a smile while Harry nodded numbly chewing on the corner of his mouth. “Are you okay Harry?”
“Unfortunately, we have to return home” Narcissa said casting another spell which showed the time in a ghostly white light. They had walked around the rest of the zoo and some of the gardens. They were pretty but Harry genuinely thought that the Malfoy’s gardens were prettier. “We will return some other time, but for now we must return Pansy to the hotel and make our way home”
“I know…Just excited…” Harry smiled getting back onto the bed and allowing Draco to tug him into a hug. “What if Sev is only doing it because he feels forced?”
“We are going to Diagon today to get our wands!” She announced as though the two boys hadn’t been speaking about it late into the night. All three of them were good at wandless magic now, thanks to Nino, but there was something special about getting a wand even if they couldn’t use it outside school. In just three days they would be starting Hogwarts and Harry was both excited and worried about the whole thing.
“Indeed, rather like yourself I assumed Miss Parkinson was a true Slytherin. That being said, I am sure she will do well in the house assigned to her, unlike the youngest Mister Weasley.” Severus wasn’t a man who let his expressions show easily but Harry could see the distaste in his dad’s face as he talked about Ronald and he couldn’t help but wonder.
“It has been a strange day” He remarked lightly swirling a sugar cube into his cup while watching as Severus took it black. His thin lips pressing to the rim of the cup his long fingers gracefully holding the delicate handle. As a teen in Hogwarts it had been Severus’ fingers he had noticed first, they had been paired together in potions for their third year when Slughorn had wanted to separate the marauders. They hadn’t spoke much beyond talking about their potion, but Remus would remember those fingers till the day he died. “Never would have I have dreamed I would be here, with you. In Lucius Malfoy’s home”
“I named mine Ares, but he is an eagle owl, you will figure out a good name for her, she’s beautiful” Draco muttered through a yawn grabbing hold of a toothbrush and smearing paste onto it. Harry followed suit watching the owl that was bobbing up and down and swirling its head around while clicking her beak towards him before hooting. “Father left Dumbledore outside in the rain for almost half an hour. I would love to have seen his face, Dumbledore is so used to everyone just jumping and doing everything he says and looking at him as though he is the only reason the sun shines or the trees grow. He really should be put down a pig or two”
“Okay, Lily made sure of it…You can't see but I’m sticking my tongue out…Another thing. Watch Dumbledore. I have no idea what it is but Lily has a bee in her bonnet about him and I have to admit he’s been putting the willies up me a bit. It’s the way he keeps looking at Harry…Like he’s not seeing a baby…Speaking of which, here’s Harry, say hello to moony Harry”
We are almost at Hogwarts people! This is not a drill, I really hope that this hasn’t dragged far too much >.< I always worry that my stories get bogged down and become uninteresting >.< I know that there is a lot more OC’s than some people might like but given how much life is different for Harry its expected that he would meet new people right >.<
“I see, it’s nice, not may see father as I see him. Pants is a little afraid of him truth be told and the other heirs all treat him with respect but are just as afraid. Oh well, its good...Are you done I guess uncle Severus is here with your potions”
“Nothing as of yet, the auror department it seems refuses to act on what is a clear case of child abuse without evidence” Lucius answered in a clipped tone the magic seeming to fly from him in a burst of electricity and Draco opened his mouth while Harry gave a fearful gasp as one of the flower petals met with Lucius’s wraith.
“My parents were both Claws, Dad was a Prefect, mum kept getting lost and he helped her find her way, my dad’s Scottish, my mum is Chinese, her parents came over when she was six…Oh your friend is being sorted!” She said pointing as Pansy was called to the stool to have the hat placed on her head. Pansy looked happy and confident as she sat on the stool with her legs neatly folded under her, her hands resting on her knees like a proper lady of the manor but Harry could see that his friend was nervous from the way her smile was frozen on her lips.
“Of course, something so childish would tickle you, Lupin” Severus snapped colour appearing in his own cheeks but his tone was fond more than disproving and there was another hint of a smile around his lips. “Though, I wonder what things other animals are saying when people are gawping at them”
“Me neither. But we don’t live in that world Harry, we live in this one and I’m glad of it” Draco’s lips very lightly brushed over his forehead and scar and Harry smiled closing his eyes and snuggling into the arms that were wrapped securely around him. They were so wrapped up in each other neither were aware that the bedroom door had opened and that Narcissa was in the room until she gave a little chuckle.
“Because I think you have punished yourself enough, Uncle Sev, you weren’t much older than a child, you were at war...” Harry remembered watching a documentary in History class about a Jewish woman who met with a German soldier after the war. He had never understood the words that she had said then. He, like the rest of his class, had wondered how she could be so forgiving when she had suffered so much but he could always remember the words. “You were a small part of a big war. You made mistakes and you will carry that with you always but it is your actions now that will determine the type of man you are. If I hate you, I will never know peace, you have to live your life with the weight of your actions. I will not add to that. If you truly seek redemption live your life well...My parents wanted that for you too...”
“No! I can’t be in Slytherin! I can’t! Only bad wizards and witches are in Slytherin!” Ron whimpered genuinely looking as though he were about to cry as the hat was taken from his head. He looked at McGonagall with a pleading expression. “Please, can’t we try again? I can’t be a Slytherin! I’m a Gryffindor!”
“My dear Lady Malfoy, what an unexpected honour to have you here. When the message came, I thought that there was a mistake. You make even Azkaban a brighter place by your beauty, Lady Malfoy”
“Hey! Thanks again for the tickets, the game was fun, and the Hummingbirds were great. Where do you go next?”
“I know, but I have to at least try, mother. There was always something between Harry and me. As a child it was rivalry that grew out of petty jealousy that he chose Weasley over me, as teens it was more complicated but still we were connected…I think that always there has been a part of me that has longed to be by his side…I will regret not seeing what will happen more than trying and having it go badly” Draco admitted nervous about having so much emotion on display but needing his mother to understand what he was feeling, what he had been feeling since Harry had held out his hand and introduced himself. Narcissa gave him a smile squeezing his fingers. “This isn’t a game for Harry, mother, anymore than it is for me.”
“Dumbly-dore…Hoggywarts!” The elf squeaked its voice gravelly from lack of use but already he seemed to be radiating with happiness. His oddly shaped limbs moving slowly as he tried to bob into a bow. “Dobby knows you sire! Youse is a great mans!”
“I…Um…I…” Harry spluttered his eyes blinking rapidly, his mouth feeling incredibly dry as he looked to where Remus was pointing and saw a vendor with a push cart that had the words ‘Mama Marbles Fresh Yrun Milk Ice Cream’ painted in changing colours on the side. The man pushing the cart was grinning at children as he handed over cones.
“Harry, why…Yer know, why is Dumbledore so set against you? From what I’ve ‘eard he made a big stink at the ministry. Me mam thought he was sure that he who must not be named were coming back or had a kid or summot”
“I need to brush my teeth and wash my face. Do you think I should have spoken to Dad?” Harry asked following Draco to the bathroom and leaving the other boys to look at each other. Harry wasn’t nearly as good at ignoring people as Draco, but he was determined to be better at sticking up for his friend. Draco was going to get a lot of people bullying him just because of who he was. “Do you think he was upset I wasn’t a Slytherin?”
“I have had lovers, Severus, not many and none that lasted but I have not been a saint. However, even in 50 years I still imagine that I would be pulled to dark hair and dry wit. If you were willing I would very much like to see where this attraction between us may go” The words were out before Remus could convince himself to stop them and Severus looked at him with his dark as sin eyes, twin spots of colour appearing in his cheeks.
“Yes.” Harry straightened his back fixing him with an impressive Severus stare one eyebrow lifted primly up his forehead. “Is that an issue?”
“I’m already out mother” Draco drawled having his hair dried by one of the elves. “Today is Harry’s day”
“Thank-you for attending” Severus said smoothly a little stiff in his body while Remus was smiling brightly at his side.
A brown wolf with amber eyes had come upon him first and the prince had feared that his life was over until a boy with tanned skin and dark messy hair had whistled to the beast and had it lumbered away looking for all the world like a lap dog as his tongue fell out of its mouth.
“Why are you apologising? You’re not at fault for the stupidity of old men. I will make a promise to you, I will make sure to leave one day free before Yule and we will build snowmen together. Perhaps we could encourage Severus to join us and make a challenge of it” Lucius let out a warm chuckle his breath coming out in a slow cloud before sailing over the garden.
Phew…Not much to say beyond I hope it wasn’t a garbled mess >.< I promise we are going to Hogwarts, soon…I am thinking of making that into a new part of the story cause this is already nearly 100 parts give or take >.<
“Stay close Harry” Severus said as they stepped out of the floo into a small chamber that held a sign saying national floo station on the far wall. Harry was quickly deciding that he loathed travelling by floo and he was more than happy to stand close beside his new father as he caught his breath waiting for Draco and Lupin to step in behind them followed by Lucius and Narcissa. All had changed out of the formal robes, but none looked like a muggle. Narcissa was wearing a beautiful silk periwinkle gown that wouldn’t look out of place in a west end theatre while Lucius was wearing what Harry thought of as his Mr Darcy outfit. Severus had simply removed his outer robe and was wearing black trousers, boots, and a high-necked shirt. Remus looked the most muggle though he looked like an Oxford professor wearing a green cardigan with leather patches on his elbows and brown trousers. Harry and Draco were both wearing formal trousers and shirts.
“Is that what you are doing? Because at dinner it looked to me like you were caring for the boy and doing a fine job of it. Please Severus, do not mistake me for one of those blind to the faults of Albus. I told him 11 years ago not to leave the boy with those muggles, that they weren’t fit to look after a mouse.”
“Happy New year!” They all chorused back, and Harry thought back to last year. The Dursley’s had gone to a new years’ party leaving him locked in his cupboard his back sore and bleeding from Vernon’s belt. He had heard the countdown from the neighbours and then the fireworks, but he laid on his front wishing for something good to happen, not believing that it ever would. Now though, now he was safe and loved surrounded by people who genuinely cared for him and all he could hope for the next year was that his family was safe and happy.
“There is a chance you could make matters worse. I have seen a few cases of malnutrition and a course of potions is the best answer. I have not had medical training however and could not say but any potions that are needed send word, I will be happy to make them, I don’t trust the mass produced ones in Saint Mungo’s and they always make them bitter” Severus hummed wrinkling his long crooked nose like a child. “Thank-you for breakfast, Lucius, Narcissa, and thank-you for accepting my apology, Harry, but I must return to Hogwarts I have lessons. I will await your owl Harry”
“Honestly, Harry, I can’t say that I’m surprised, nothing your cousin does surprises me much anymore, but it does make me hate them all the more” Draco grumbled with feeling just as Remus came into the room. The amber eyed werewolf didn’t have the same bellowing robes that Severus did but he was brimming with joy his body so much better rested after his full moon transformations with Severus’ potion. The air crackled with his excitement his ring proudly on display on his finger.
“You guys are aware you have chairs, correct?” Pansy asked as she came in from Draco’s room, but she dropped down beside them hugging a stuffed cat to her chest. Before anyone could make a comment, Seamus was coming in carrying a bag of Wizarding games and the four of them spent the rest of Samhain playing Exploding snap and Gobstones the only disappointment was that the twins hadn’t been able to stay.
” The snake rose pressing its pretty rainbow coloured belly to the glass and focusing its eyes directly into his. Harry looked over at Remus and Severus feeling almost sick when he saw how shocked their expressions were and how pale Severus looked.
“My heart, you a like a fussing hen, but she is right Harry, you should have some of the beef, it is wonderfully cooked” Lucius said taking a few slices from the serving dish and placing it onto his plate before adding some of the roast potatoes. Flushing brightly Harry lifted the cutlery and carefully took a bite of the beef. It was juicy and extremely well cooked with a smoky aftertaste and he imagined that it had been slow cooked all day. He swallowed it down and took some more along with a corner of the potato which was just as amazing on his taste buds. “You like?”
“Is he who is eating all your food?” Draco asked his narrow face twisted into a glare as he poked his head around and looked at Dudley’s retreating back. Lucius’ lips twitched in a smile but he said softly;
“Yes, well, I wait with bated breath, now if you will excuse us.” Draco let out the tiniest of sighs and then stepped around Ron and carefully pulled Harry with him.
“And so, after that eventful sorting, it is my greatest duty to welcome you all to Hogwarts” Madam Sinistra said standing and giving them all a smile. Her deep chocolate brown eyes shining in the light of the thousand candles. “This year marks my first full year as head mistress of Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a position I am truly honoured to have been given. My fellow teachers and I are proud to dedicate our time to teach you. So, before the feast I would like to introduce the first years to our staff here…Professor McGonagall you have already met, she is my right hand, a talented witch head of Gryffindor. The rather excitable fellow is Professor Flitwick, charms master and head of Ravenclaw. The wonderful lady next to him is Professor Sprout, the brightest Herbologist Hogwarts has ever known and Head of Hufflepuff. Next, we have a new, we have for this year, Kazuko Ninomiya, a white robe graduate of the Japanese school of witchcraft.” Harry smiled at Nino while the small Japanese witch gave the students a bright smile and a wave. Around him he could hear some of the older male students catcall and whistle, not too loudly but enough that they were heard. “Professor Ninomiya will be teaching Defence against the dark arts. Next to her is Professor Snape, he was the youngest potions master in the world and is currently head of Slytherin house…”
“Malfoy.” The boy spat his voice deeper than Draco’s or Harry’s. Harry didn’t recognise the name Blackmore, but he had a feeling that he had seen this boy somewhere before. “What’s two Ravenclaw’s doing in Slytherin territory? Bet your daddy’s upset that his little princess wasn’t in his house. Well good riddance, everyone knows the Malfoy’s have gone soft…”
“Hem hem, as modest as Mr Potter is it is my job to ensure that a proper examination is being carried out”
“Harry” Lucius smiled reaching out to pour him a glass of pumpkin juice and to hand over the first batches of pills and medicines he had to take before eating. “Is Draco preening?”
“The elves will be very happy to hear that, Harry dear, now don’t be afraid, take what you would like” Narcissa encouraged as Lucius and Draco started taking food from the various dishes on the table. Harry didn’t know where to start and the voices of the Dursley’s were on a constant reply in his mind telling him that he had to watch them eat and he could have the scraps. The Malfoy’s didn’t eat like the Dursley’s. They were delicate in their movements taking a little of the food eating only that before taking more if they wanted. Dudley would have eaten everything and more adding to the many chins that decorated his face. His stomach gurgled loudly and he hit it to silence it.  “Would you like some potatoes? Try a little of the beef”
Lunch with the Parkinson’s was a lavish but relaxed affair. The courses were small but there was plenty of them. Narcissa had even allowed the children to have a glass of wine and although Pansy and Draco seemed to have enjoyed it Harry thought it was like drinking vinegar and had quickly switched it out for another glass of butterbeer. He was sure that he would have embarrassed them but Magenta let out a tinkling little laugh and gave him a wink.
“Me too. Remus…” Harry stopped speaking his mouth dropping open in awe as he saw in the centre of the village a magnificent carriage. It was pale blue with gold fixtures and trimmings, on the side was a coat of arms with a white fox curled in the centre. A team of four white horses with plumes were pulling it and a man dressed in the finest blue silk was sitting on plush pillows. Almost all of the village was out of bed and surrounding it and Harry could only gape like a landed fish before asking his friend. “What is that?”
“Nice to meet you” Harry said again clutching tightly at Draco’s hand, so much so he had to be squeezing his fingers to almost breaking point. “This is my friend, Draco Malfoy”
“Oh, I’m sorry” Harry mumbled feeling embarrassed that he had assumed that it would be the same in the wizarding world as it was in the muggle one. He felt so completely out of place here and he was sure that the Malfoy’s would grow tired of him for not knowing anything. As it was Lucius gave him a gentle smile his grey eyes warm as he stole a square of chocolate from Draco’s bar. He perched himself on the arm of the chair saying;
“Its not his gold.” Remus grumbled but ran dirty fingers through his already greying hair. “Though I am happy we get to talk.”
“It’s okay, you’ll be amongst friends, and we’re at home if you ever want to get out of the ballroom just give me a nod and we can come up here with just our friends, alright?” Draco assured him his hand slipping into his and Harry felt the frisson of nerves slip away. He squeezed the hand in his and nodded before letting go and allowing Remus to help him into his costume. He blinked as flower, bees and butterflies flew up out of the box and decorated one side of his face and entangled themselves into his wild hair. “Wow! You’re the Fae Child! You look so good!”
Most of the residents of the Drive thought that Mrs Figg was a witch because of how many cats she kept but the book hadn’t told him that having lots of cats was a requirement for being a witch though it had said that students were allowed to take an owl, a cat, or a toad to school when they attended.
“Afraid? No, surprised, Yes…” Severus admitted “However there are many reasons for it. The Potters are an old family…We will think about it later”
“He’s just gone to Romania to play with Dragons or something!” Fred or George said while the other nodded. Conner gave a laugh running his fingers through his hair again as his teammates came out of the changing room chatting happily. They all looked relaxed for having lost a game and Harry admired that, a lot.
Draco didn’t know how long he stood there watching, it could have been hours or minutes, but it was too soon when the boy got up and put his book into a hole in the stump before moving away in the opposite direction leaving Draco alone in the woods with a fading scent and a bitter realisation that he should have spoken to the boy. His fox was howling at him for not doing so. He had vowed to come back again the next day and he had but there was no sign of the omega, nor the day after and on the third he had left the country estate to return to the city palace.
People are crowding together. Not in the hundreds, but it doesn’t take one hundred people to make the streets feel dangerous.
“I’m fine!” Draco said, trying to dodge as Potter’s hands reached into his space. “Just going to be out for a second.”
“An incident?” Draco is struggling to process, still has one foot in another universe, itching to race to Archway Bridge.
Draco wobbles across the room and collapses into the cushions of his sectional. “I’m never doing that again.”
“I’m attaching these pads to your chest,” Emma says and Harry is happy she’s here with him. The heart rhythm is not behaving and Mike is quivering on the stretcher.
Sixty-one different lives have left Harry’s head fractured and loose and right now, he just wants to wander through a life that was his and not some spectre from a future he would never have. He wants to put himself back together.
Harry knows what will happen next. Hermione had repeated the process over and over until she’d worn a verbal footpath into his memory. “For safety,” she had said. “So you know what’s happening to you,” she had said.
“Draco,” Robertson says, and the words drip with gravitas. “As your employer and an adult figure to whom you look up to a great deal, I must voice my concerns regarding his approach.”
“It’s not like people haven’t died before,” Harry finally says. “I’ve seen it. I see it. All the time.”
For weeks after Malfoy vanished, Harry’d lain awake at night, replaying the last time he’d seen him, revisiting every memory he had from after the trials. It’s agony, but Harry replays each moment, trying to pinpoint if there was a place where he could have done things differently.
“There are Aurors all over London looking for you, Draco.” The man turns and Draco realizes he’s a stranger, with heavy eyes and hair that’s greying at the temples.
Draco breathes deeply—they’re not with Pansy, and it’s a small thing, but it sets him at ease. Focusing his courage on the single point of light, Draco smooths the tremble from his fingers and steps into the doorway.
“I’ve given you no reason to find me sinister,” Draco says, but Robertson’s in a bluster and doesn’t hear him.
But Harry’s mouth refuses to heed him. He pulls Draco’s arm to his lips, starts kissing those cheeky dark lines that he’s ogled for months. That had snuck under those rolled up sleeves, refusing to let him see.
“Hmm,” Draco says, looking at his desk. Nothing about the office is ostentatious, not in the way that Harry had expected it to be.
“Excuse me?” Draco does not think he’s ever been more confused, and Robertson is a very confusing person.
“Unlike some common criminals, I have good manners,” Pansy says on her way into the kitchen, shouting, “Don’t touch anything else!” as she goes.
. Draco’s conscious enough to know. Pain splinters and punches its greedy fingers through flesh and bone and Draco feels it at the centre of him.
Bella’s purrs are a concerto of contentment. Harry buries his face in his mug and breathes in the smell of coffee.
“I just wanted to give it back—” Potter starts to say, but is cut off. It’s a noise that stops Draco’s heart. Like the last of the water sucked down the drain, of a lung collapsing or a heel crushing a windpipe. Potter drops his face into his hands and starts to shake.
Draco thinks, and the planes of their bodies drift together, arms buried in shirts and hair and skin.
Draco eventually maneuvers Harry into a large group of people, makes sure that Harry’s inserted into conversation. It’s only once Harry settles in that Malfoy disappears.
“Absolutely not,” she says, poking at the pills with his pinky finger. “We will sort out whatever that stupid curse means by
“I know,” Harry says, and finally stops pacing. Draco had wound him up, charged the springs with his mouth and his hands on Harry’s chin and just left him to unwind. Like one of those little mechanical toys.
The words are a tether, a germ around which he can remember what it feels like to stand. Harry blinks, realizes he has eyes, and then looks around, realizes there is something to look at.
“We’ll go to Malfoy Manner,” Pansy says. “Draco gave me access to the wards after—” she trails off. “I can get us in.”
Harry tries to hold on to the concept of seeing and being seen, but it’s no use. The world unravels, the multiverse twisting like a tornado made of tapestry, and it takes Harry with it. Starlight streams, rather than sparkles. Liquid ribbons twist.
“Oh.” The tension settles. “Sorry. I don’t know…how to act with you,” Draco says, and Harry knows exactly what he means. Fighting and dancing aren’t all that different.
Harry steps again. They’re close now, so close that Harry is nearly standing on his shoes. Draco remembers Potter’s hand on his elbow in front of the Winzengamot and then the ghost of his lips on a balcony. “I’m not very good at this,” Harry says and Draco’s close enough to taste the words.
Draco knows he should tell her about the spell. Deep in his guts, at the centre of him where his honestly lives, he knows he should tell her. But as he breathes in the smell of her—of lavender and hairspray—he can’t bring himself to do it. For just a little while, the weight of her head and the weight of his future seem to balance and everything feels calm.
His chest dissolves, fragments of himself splayed through a prism of infinite variations. It’s the squeeze of apparition, but inverted, pushing every little bit of him apart, until Harry is reduced to the pieces that are indivisible. Everything is undone and he’s mixing with the stars.
“Mental health,” Draco says, swirling the unfamiliar words around in his mouth. “Is that why you’re here?”
The hand moves from his shoulder blade, is tracing circles up and down his back and this is what finally breaks him. Because suddenly they’re Frieda’s hands, pressing soothing circles into Mike’s back, until they’d taken his body and worked it and worked it until there was nothing left.
John holds up a hand and Draco lets himself be silenced. “Past is fixed. Stone. You’re not changing it. Future though. That’s something worth doing.”
For a moment, the world holds its breath. Sending electricity through someone’s heart is not something Harry has gotten used to.
“But I didn’t mean to. I just wanted to help—” It’s all going wrong, the infection lanced and oozing,  and Harry can’t stop. His words have always been blunt objects, and this explanation deserved so much more care than what he’s bleating out.
But a part of Harry knows that anything so direct would be a gunshot in a field of birds. They’re still dancing, Harry knows. And it’s better than fighting.
Draco rolled his eyes and then realized that Harry couldn’t see him. “I’m not nice, Potter,” he said, distilling his look into words.
Draco raises one eyebrow, and Harry briefly wonders if this is a skill that's innate or requires practice. He wouldn’t put it past Draco to spend long hours staring into a mirror, wiggling his blond brows trying to look sinister.
“It’s multiple universes actually. The multiverse,” Draco supplies, and Pansy looks like she wants to hit him.
The night had started to tilt after that—everything felt like it was one of those Muggle records (Draco needed to buy some of those) spinning and spinning. There’d been eyes on him all night. Angry ones, but others too. Eyes that were hungry and black and, fuck, it had been so nice to have someone look at him with something other than disgust.
“In one universe,” Draco says, “I fall to my death.” There’s no answer. Just the sounds of a city at night.
Harry forces his eyes open, tiredness gritty under the lids. Draco is hovering on the very edge of the room, a pair of joggers hanging low on his hips. Tight arms cross his chest, fingers gripping elbows, white and nervous.
“Right, so we’re carpooling,” Draco said, trying for small talk. Anything that would remove that horrible look from Harry’s face. “I knew that, obviously. How much longer have we got?”
The bartender lines up six shot glasses and starts to pour. The wooden countertop is filthy, varnished with the sticky remnants of shots mishandled. “Race you,” Pansy cackles, downing shot after shot with the confidence of someone practiced.
“—for our sins! The similarities are honestly quite stunning. If he’s not a Christ rip off, he’s at least Christ-like.”
Narcissa stops, bracketed by smooth lawns on either side of her slim shoulders. “Draco,” she says, and her voice wobbles. “We’re …we’re going to be…”
Harry dreams of a light at the top of the stairs. Of snakes that talk and Celestina Warbeck. The voices seep in, his sleep’s seal broken and leaking.
They’re inside the Fiendfyre and everything is burning. Draco feels his rage lashing out in fire and fists. “Why is it always you?” Draco's hands are flailing, his whole body curdled with violence. He’s hitting something. Harry.
I've described a few universes in this chapter (which are sly references to brilliant fics you should absolutely read if you haven't already).
“That’s disgusting, is what that is.” Ron said, shaking his head. “I honestly don’t know why you’re bothering at that place. Doctors are just men with knives and apparently fridges full of blood.” Harry had bit his tongue and wrestled  the hot rage back into his chest. Wizards, even good ones like Ron, we so removed from Muggle culture. Too removed to understand or to care about the magnificence of modern medicine and too arrogant to appreciate how the nurses washed the dead. Handled with care, even on their way out of this world.
“Yes, that was rather hasty,” Hermione adds, and Harry sinks glumly into the couch cushions, the exhaustion inflating behind his eyes and just pushing. “We’re not sixteen anymore Harry. I thought you knew better.”
“We’ll have her body cleaned and transferred back to the Manor,” a nurse had said, later. Hours had passed. The logistics of death stripped him clean, his chest cavity was bleached bones. Draco could see the daylight high in the sky out one of the windows.
“Right,” Harry said, worry lines still nudging his expression. “You remember it’s minus forty, yeah?”
“You came back with books and not food?” Ron howls, sounding a lot like Bella. Harry shrugs, dumping his purchases into the squishy accent chair he’s claimed as his own in the disaster area that Pansy and Hermione have created. The living room looks much less like Draco’s clean modern lines and more like the inside of Hermione’s brain. Harry is briefly relieved that these two were never forced together at Hogwarts, before Ron drags him back.
“Are you sick?” Potter said, and there’s something wrong with his voice. “Do you have a fever or something? Cause you really should’ve told me about that before you jumped in my truck. It’s rude to trap someone with your germs, y’know.”
Harry’s hands haven’t moved from his shoulders. Draco felt contained, bracketed in the safety of the Chosen One. Different universe. Same boy. Same weighty certainty that, when Potter had you in his sights, everything would be alright. “You’re not a villain.”
“Sometimes I think you look for people to blow you to pieces,” this Harry says, and Draco must hear the tremble in his voice, because he rolls over, grimacing in agony.
“S’let me get this straight?” Ron had said, and then cackled into his cup. “You’re dreaming about domestic bliss with Malfoy?”
A curse flashes white, someone screams, and Potter’s magic flares. Draco blinks just as a bright shield erupts, collects around a young boy who is crying on the pavement. And Harry keeps moving, untouchable, his mouth pressed into that same determined line.
Draco pushes his hair off his forehead and Harry wants to press him thumb over the worry lines. “If they’re going to invade our personal lives, they should at least strive for originality. Confunded? What a bore.”
“Are you dreaming about Draco?” Hermione asks, her bushy head popping up from behind a pile of books.
“There was an attack,” someone behind Draco says. “A group of extremists. We’ve been following their movements for months.”
It’s 1998, and Draco's busy wooing the owner of his favourite with his favourite Muggle bookshop with wily felonious charm. However, everything is not so rosy as regular employment with musty novels. Draco is somehow much less charming when he runs into what Pansy calls “A raging, mindless, hateful mob!” (We’re with you on that one, Pansy)
But Malfoy’s already striding away, in the direction of the doctor’s office, as if everyone else in the department stopped existing as soon as he’d lost interest.
“I’m going to fuck you,” Draco whispers, and Harry groans, desperate and delirious with how much he wants. He tries to turn his head, to get his lips on all that smooth skin. The hand is his hair tugs him closer, won’t let him, he can’t…
“No use pretending this is anything else.” John has smile lines—wrinkles around the edges of his eyes. “I’m not really that kind of counsellor. There’s too much bullshit in the world already.”
Two Malfoys stride up the path to the manor, backs perpendicular to fields of green. Neither has said a word since apparating from the ministry.
For years—ever since that horrible night in the forest—Harry had clutched his magic tight, fought with the frantic moments when it surged close to the skin.
“Why don’t you say it?” Harry is startled by how rare the voice sounds—it’s his own, and he’s never heard it bleed like this. It’s raw as a sore throat.
Draco resisted the urge to hide behind the stack of books in his arms. Robertson had a firm “no bags” policy. Not in an effort to save the oceans or out of concern for his carbon footprint. No. A sign on the door proclaimed that “BOOKS NEED TO BREATHE! CARRY THE STORIES IN YOUR ARMS; DO NOT STRANGLE THEM IN PLASTIC! RESPECT THE CRAFT!”
“You’re the actual worst, Potter,” Pansy says, a bit manic but less angry than before. “You’re stale laundry and an unnecessary movie sequel. You’re all of the bad things.”
Malfoy snorts, but Harry pushes on. “We snogged. It was nice. But since then, I’ve been with—it’s—blokes. Almost always blokes.”
The room is clean but for the mess they’ve made of the bed. The colours are light and pastel, every surface covered with plants—waxy leaves and sprawling shoots and creepers that crawl across the walls. There’s far too many throw blankets—at least twenty, draped across chairs and folded on his dresser and hanging from hooks behind the door.
“Potter,” Draco whispers, and he can’t stop thinking about the way he’d looked. Like someone drunk had tried to draw him. Like he hadn’t slept in days.
“Harry Potter!” Harry roars, wishing just this once that the power of his name would make everything work out. “I’m a resident. I work with Draco.”
“I should’ve brought it back ages ago,” Harry said, shame deepening the blush on his snow-scrubbed cheeks.
He’d tried to take his time. With shaking fingers, Harry had opened the box and laid every vial on his bed. There were sixty-one, and each had a date scrawled onto a paper label.
“We figure Draco cast the spell in the library or on the balcony overlooking the gardens,” Hermione says, throwing an approving look at Pansy.
“Years?” Why was Harry always the last person to gain insight into his own feelings? Why had no one bothered to tell him?
, Harry thinks, and the need to know is a wild animal. Question after question expands in his chest, a thousand conversations he can’t wait until his next shift to have, but that he knows he must endure because he has stalked Malfoy before and knows the signs.
Hermione had swished her wand and vanished the pizza boxes. Harry felt a pang of loss. He’d grown quite fond of those pizza boxes. “You,” Hermione said, poking his cheek. “Shower. You smell like cheese.”
The wounds are red as sirens. Harry can’t help him here, can only watch this older version of himself cast entry level healing spells that sew up the skin and ease the swelling.
Harry thought. Neither man seemed to know that Harry was there, tucked away next to the lonely plant. Malfoy’s eyes were closed, his head pressed back against the damp brick, his neck stretched long.
The stranger had trailed his hands down Draco’s arms, had pulled him close and buried his face in Draco’s shoulder, and it had been fine at first. The night air nipped at his neck, but Draco licked into another man’s mouth and forget everything.
“I’m not sure anyone will ever live up to those standards,” Draco says. “But thank you. Honestly.” He means it—feels something in his chest kindle knowing that there is someone out there who thinks him deserving.
“Is this like the zoo we went to in France?” Harry asked as a thin wristband appeared around his arm, but it was Remus who shook his head and answered lightly
“I see, then you are in good hands Harry, the spell for the brace can be taken off at night but must be recast straight away in the morning”
“Madam Hester” He said with a bow he had spent the afternoon talking to her painting and had found out about much of her life. She had been born the youngest child of a miller and had seemed to be destined for a life of poverty until Hogwarts had been opened. She had been the first student sorted into Ravenclaw and had become renowned for her intelligence forming the order that would eventually be called the unspeakables who dove into the deepest depths of magic. She had married one of the lesser Malfoy’s and had sadly died in childbirth along with her second child, one of the first affected by the curse that sought out the Malfoy’s. The woman in the portrait smiled at him inclining her head just a little before frowning as the sun crown slipped over her eyes.
“There has been some progress made with the wolf’s curse potion, Lupin, it was mentioned in the Journal I am taken to reading” Severus hummed as they waited for the boys outside of  Zonkos joke shop. Severus had forbidden them from buying anything but Draco had insisted on showing Harry.
“I want to stay with Draco, Jinx...And the Malfoy’s if...If I can...Please...Don’t make me go back to the Dursley’s...Please...” He whispered staring into the Auror’s face and to his and Dumbledore’s surprise Kingsley nodded and smiled.
“I wonder why he doesn’t seem to trust Quirrell?” Draco asked in a hushed voice as they walked through the school dungeons up to the main floor. It was a shorter walk than to Ravenclaw tower, but it was teeming with both Slytherin and Hufflepuff students and almost automatically Harry reached for Draco’s hand as though it was an anchor to ground him. Draco threaded their fingers together tightly and carried on walking until they were almost knocked over by painful pushes to their backs. “What do you think you are doing?” Draco hissed spinning on his heel and finding himself face to chest with a burly third year in a Slytherin green tie. The boy looked like Dudley if Dudley had had his face repeatedly hit with a spade. The third year’s nose was smooshed against his cheek after having been broken so many times, the angle causing his top lip to lift in the middle to reveal yellowing buck teeth. His hair was a simple short back and sides. “Blackmore…”
“Yes, very much like a policeman. You are not in any trouble, but I need you to tell me, is what Lord and Lady Malfoy saying true? Did your relatives harm you?”
