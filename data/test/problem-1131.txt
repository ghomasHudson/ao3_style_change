But as many people disbelieved the article or criticized Harry, there were several thoughtful faces and a few more filled with fearful belief than before. Shadow noticed all this and smiled internally.
Draco went down hard, but he rolled and jumped right back to his feet. His teeth were bared and shone as lightning flashed above. Severus made a hand gesture. Neville couldn't believe it, but Draco instantly backed down and began hurrying back toward them.
The few Slytherins in the room looked surprised at this as everyone began talking about what they could write down, not seeming to bat an eye at that.
Shadow wondered if what the girl said was true. Maybe he
One blue, one green eye opened and Shadow looked over at them from behind his knees and wrapped inside a black straightjacket. Grief but also a strange calmness pervaded his expression. Severus strode over and sat in the second chair. He didn't want to touch him until he knew it was welcome and he didn't want to tower over him, either.
Her girlish dance came to an end in front of Ollivander's Wand Shop. Powerful wards surrounded the store. Bellatrix pulled out a small box from her pocket. It was a gift from her Lord. She placed it on the doorstep and backed away, excitedly casting an opening charm.
Shadow fell back, eyes wide. "
the Hat seemed to chuckle. It's voice was old, making Shadow think of ancient books and dusty pages.
Every time he closed his eyes, Shadow saw Draco getting hit by his father. Half of him wanted to know why the blond had done it, but the other half already knew. This was the same person who struck down Dumbledore to save Severus. Draco gave him dance lessons, laughed with him about Skeeter's humiliation, and worked beside him in companionable silence for hours over a basilisk corpse.
Having three leaders to double check the others would hopefully prevent corruption like Dumbledore’s, and three leaders should insure at least one person would always be available to make decisions. Kingsley Shacklebolt, an Auror, and Minerva McGonagall, Headmistress of Hogwarts, were elected as two of the three. The third to complete the Triad was surprisingly Bill Weasley, Curse Breaker, and only he would be devoted to the Order full-time.
"Is that all?" Shadow drawled sarcastically. He stood and poked his finger in the solid-feeling chest. "I don't want you living in my head! You said yourself it's stressful for my psyche or whatever!"
"Yes."
"Neville tells us the truth. He doesn't lie to us," Augusta said firmly, misinterpreting the look. She flicked her wand and two plates came soaring over and landed heavily in front of the two teens. A third landed more gently in front of the old man.
Severus lifted an eyebrow at that and conjured some bowls. He carefully ladled out five.
"I never knew Hagrid very well," Shadow answered, keeping to his Slytherin persona. "But I doubt the Headmistress would let him leave Hogwarts if he meant harm. She would have contained him somehow."
Neville gasped. "Rodolphus… Where is he? Is he okay?" He looked around wildly for his friend.
"Still…" Harry turned back to his letter.
"Yes, Minister?" the young girl asked, flustered and about as exhausted as Fudge was himself.
Ginny nodded stiffly, hugging her pillow tighter to hold her emotions in-check. All she could think about was her brother moping around like a zombie and Hermione crying herself to sleep for nights on end.
Remus had gone back to Hogwarts to teach History, leaving Sirius, Severus, Draco, and Shadow to look for the locket. The problem was that all four of them were wanted by the Ministry, and the Ministry made sure everyone in the Wizarding World would be watching them. They couldn't exactly wander around without drawing unwanted attention to themselves and Polyjuice wasn't viable for long term use. Severus, Shadow, and Sirius could use their Animagus forms, but they couldn't exactly ask questions as a bat, lynx, and a Grimm, and that wouldn't help Draco who had yet to master the transformation.
"The creepy feeling that I'm being watched has let up a bit," he offered with an excited grin.
"Yes, sir," Draco answered with a smug smile. "I think we are."
Shadow was panting. He wanted this. It felt so good. He wanted to know, intimately and inarguably, that Draco was with him. That at least this one thing in his life wouldn't change no matter what. It felt good after everything to just let go and simply
Remus's eyes went wide with understanding. "We're not going to hurt you,” he told the damaged alter. “We just want to help get you free."
"He's not cursed! That's just coincidence. Bad things happen to people with eyes the same color, too! Think about Harry. He's had awful luck, as bad as Shadow's. We don't even know if he's alive! He could have died at fourteen," she said, her voice trembling with tears.
Shaking, Ginny couldn't even offer him a hand. She just blinked at him in shock. "Did you swallow any? Dear Merlin," she moaned, "I'm so sorry. I wasn't thinking!"
"The dungeons are this way. Longbottom will probably be there," Draco murmured, pointing in the direction the man had gone.
Shadow waved for him to hurry up, obediently not saying a word.
Draco continued to murmur soothingly, coaxing Shadow's breath to even out and the hysterical light in his eyes to dim. After about fifteen minutes, Draco asked carefully if he was all right.
Harry opened his eyes and blinked against the bright, late morning sun filling the room. For a wonder, he was alone; the chair residing beside his bed was empty. He sighed in pleasure and just enjoyed the solitude while it lasted.
"Yes, Lucius. You know all this," Severus was careful to speak evenly, careful not to provoke any of them.
Shadow struggled to yank free of Severus’s grasp.
"Remus," Neville greeted dully not turning around to look at him.
Shadow's face regained color as he was reminded of their fight in Draco's dorm room. He'd trusted Draco enough to let him take some of the burden Lockhart had left him to bear. Just like then, he stared into Draco's face, looking for something he couldn't quite name. And just like then he found what he was looking for. He nodded once, sharply.
"Male or female, Shadow, you would only chose a partner who is worthy of your love," Severus insisted. "You are too smart and discerning for anything else. The only way Lockhart could influence your decision is by making you deny a relationship out of misguided fear, and I'm proud of you for working so hard to keep that from happening. You are confronting what happened and healing the mark it left on you. You're giving yourself a chance, which is more than a lot of people have done who have been hurt as you have."
"He needs space from the event of his nightmares," Luna agreed, "but not from his friends. It hurts him when he is alone with the memories. Try to put yourself in his head, so you can understand.”
Shadow flushed red. "I was a bit overwhelmed by everything he was telling me. I mean, I'm really grateful that he can accept me and Seraphim, and he said he loved me. We, ah, made out, I guess, before really finishing the discussion. I, ah, haven't brought it up since then."
"Not at all," Hermione said happily. "This is great! The more people the better when it comes to practice."
Neville glanced up at Remus, but the werewolf only shrugged. He didn't know what was going on either. Together they moved downstairs, but they slowed when they saw three Aurors in uniform standing in the foyer. All three turned and watched them descend with hard, evaluating gazes. Augusta stood tall and regal before them while old Uncle Algie stood in the doorway to the sitting room scowling.
"We can't let the Death Eaters win," Charlie said with absolute finality. "It will swell the Dark Lord's ranks with insane criminals. They will be unpredictable and devastating in their attacks. It will also win the Dark Lord the Dementors. The creatures are only loyal to those that can dominate them. We won the last war against them, so they serve the Ministry. If the Dark Lord proves his strength, they will follow him just as obediently. Your victory is essential. Don't hesitate. Move quickly and come back safe."
He knew he wouldn't get anywhere by pushing. Especially since the dream was so fresh. So he just smiled and reached out to give Harry a one-armed hug that was barely tolerated. He'd let things pass in silence for now, but Neville would be watching. He'd wait for a moment where he could help his brother, the way Harry had helped him.
"Whatever the hell you want," he answered wryly.
Draco kept his gaze level, his stance unwavering. "We appreciate your thorough security measures. It reassures us that the Black family has not misplaced our trust."
Shadow stepped forward and squeezed Draco's hand briefly before following his godfather from the Chamber.
"I told him… I told Neville I kissed Draco!" Shadow screamed. He reached back and grabbed a pillow and flung it at Severus. "Are you happy? Get out! Just leave me the fuck alone, you sadistic asshole! GET OUT!"
"We'll destroy him, Shadow." Draco reached over and gently squeezed his shoulder. "Severus will be fine. You know how capable he is."
we can do!" Neville exclaimed.
Draco shot a look at Shadow, seeing the teen's shoulders tense, and took the envelope. "Thank you, Omi."
Draco considered. He definitely had a problem in his pants to take care of, but on the other hand Shadow very rarely let him get so close for so long. Decided, he moved forward and crawled onto the bed. He grinned happily when he saw Shadow's small smile when the bed dipped.
Draco rolled onto his side, panting as he curled around his stomach. Little shocks and zaps of energy sparked along his muscles making him twitch and wheeze. It didn't hurt, exactly. In fact, it felt kind of good, but it still had his eyes watering and his lungs shuddering lightly with every breath.
Harry blushed and offered her a smile. "I'm fine, Mrs. Weasley. The monks took very good care of me. I'm sorry I didn't write more, but… Well… I needed the time to recover. The Death Eaters and Voldemort almost killed me. I was out of my head from the pain for several weeks afterward."
Still, the Marauders returned home an hour earlier than they said they would. Sirius's posture was stiff and his eyes were bright. Without waiting, he went in search of his godson and the treacherous little snake. Remus followed quickly after, preparing to intervene if Sirius began to make a fool of himself or upset Harry.
"Nope." Rogan sat next to him with a grin. "It was a really cool prank. How'd you do it?"
Finally, Remus-Sirius strode into the room. His usually well-kept appearance was askew and his grey-streaked hair was wildly framing his face. "Good, you're all here."
Severus silently agreed.
"Professor!"
Shadow admitted.
"You have bigger pockets. I don't want the bread smashed," Draco explained as he put the now inch tall bags into the alter's roomy jacket pockets.
Kingsley finally spoke up, his voice grim.
It had been fifteen days since Draco had met Professor Snape at Diagon Alley. Everything had gone according to plan. Draco slowly convinced Lucius that it would be best if the family split up, to give the creature a harder time of tracking them down. Narcissa went to France, Lucius was in London, and Draco told his father he was hiding somewhere safe with friends in Italy. And because the inside of Severus's safe house really was in Italy, any tracking spells would reassure Lucius that his heir was right where he was supposed to be.
"Mundungus Fletcher stole the locket. You hid it and he took it. Is that right?"
Remus's eyes flashed gold. "Never, cub. Never."
The figure didn't answer.
"I'm glad you guys could come."
Shadow smiled at that, feeling smug. He crouched and prepared to spring. His attacker wouldn't know what hit him.
"Goodnight," Neville answered tiredly.
"How are you feeling?" Shadow asked. He had woken a moment ago to find his friend sitting up and staring at the wall.
"Just waiting for the perfect moment…"
The girl took it nervously, her round hazel eyes wide with fear. She knew something was wrong to be summoned to the Headmistress's office before breakfast.
of anything else while that
Draco took a deep breath and raised his wand, "Alohomora." There was a click and Draco slowly pushed the door open just as loud bangs and yells sounded from downstairs. Sirius had been discovered. Of course, that was the plan, for him to be discovered and try and get as much information about the Order's movements and what they knew about the Death Eaters while Draco looked for clues in Regulus' room.
Neville looked up at Draco. His brown eyes were bloodshot, but his hands stopped shaking as he realized that Draco truly did understand. He nodded. "I'm sorry," he said softly but firmly. "I didn't realize. Of course I'll help you. I never meant to make Shadow feel like that. It isn't true. He's
Ginny pushed his hand away and pulled out of his lap. She turned to face him, sitting cross-legged. "You always pull away. I'll try to kiss you and you won't let me."
”Hey. Draco and Severus are making breakfast. Why don't you see if you can help them?"
Neville grabbed her hand and pulled. She knelt before him and was wrapped up in a desperate hug. She hugged him back. The cold snow smelled fresh and soon she couldn't even feel the cuts on her arm. The sky brightened to yellow, then blue. It was a gorgeous day. Luna smiled, her head resting against Neville's.
Severus glanced past her to the two medical beds. Poppy was hovering over Marissa at the moment and Draco was watching the mediwitch's every move. (Poppy had asked that he remove the violet contacts. She wanted as few things to disturb her readings as possible.) Seeing him lying on the small bed, Severus was abruptly reminded that Draco was only fifteen years old; still a child, really.
the same person. This was perfectly clear to Draco. The same person that he would do anything for. It killed him to know that he couldn't protect Shadow from this, that it had already happened. Gently, he brushed a curl off his love's forehead. Just to touch him. He hoped Shadow wasn't having nightmares.
Draco smiled and pulled him into a loose hug. "He said he was sorry. That he's glad we're together. He liked how happy you looked when we were dancing. He left because he's still struggling with issues of his own, but they have nothing to do with you. He's coming back down to the Chamber tomorrow night."
Tears burned his eyes as he really listened to his own thoughts. He wasn't this weak! Not anymore. With painful effort, Neville forced his hands apart and met the eyes of the girl he loved.
"I did not say anything sooner because you comport yourself very well with him."
"It's over. It's over, Draco. You were strong and now it is over."
"I think I can help with that.” Sirius grinned. "I have some family heirlooms that might be able to dismantle most of these wards and traps. We already know the coordinates to get into that open space between the two sets of wards. I'll portkey outside the parameter and then Apparate into the blank space Shadow came from. If it works, we can key most of our portkeys into that space."
Remus shook his head slowly.
“Yes, Professor.”
After their spat at Madam Malkin’s, Remus took Harry and Padfoot to Florean Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlour which had a lifting effect on Harry’s mood, which Remus was pleased to see.
Harry nodded, uncomfortable at being told about his mother by this stranger.
Harry nodded, his eyebrows furrowing.
to hang out with him.
The entire lesson was punishing and, in Harry’s opinion, useless. He was given a textbook and told to craft a Calming Drought by the sallow-faced professor. While there was the small mercy of all of the ingredients being laid out on the table for Harry, Snape did nothing else to aid him in his venture.
“Well,
An aging, red-haired witch next to him slapped his arm.
“So, um… who are the rest of you?”
Harry gets some shopping done in Diagon Alley, meeting a handsome boy in a robe shop.
“He said it was a name I was familiar with, even though I don’t know anyone by that name. He liked it, so that’s what we named him.”
He turned to Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, who were staring in shock at the fire.
As Harry was looking at it, Professor McGonagall strode into the office.
“A car crash, kill Lily and James Potter? Absolute rubbish.”
Remus chuckled.
“I’ve… I’ve always wanted a friend. James, would you like to come home with me? Leave the prison?”
Draco nodded in awe, extending his hand.
“Harry Evans… no, I haven’t heard your name announced at the Sorting. You do attend Hogwarts, don’t you? You look to appear to be in my year.”
"I see you have gotten on the young Mister Malfoy's good side, Mister Evans. Let's get started."
I have a feeling that I'll make these chapters relatively short. I think it'll help me feel like I'm accomplishing more than I am XD
“Do you have any questions?”
The old man took a moment to think this over, very hesitantly conceding after thinking.
Remus smirked.
“Ah. Did the lesson not go well with Professor Snape?”
Harry shrugged. Why did he have to get treated so shittily because of stuff his father did? It made no sense to him. Remus crossed his hands.
“Yes, Professor Dumbledore, sir?”
like the rest of you. He will do well enough here, in America. The distance will keep him safe.”
He looked at the mirror, pondering his face.
, whatever - into his office the next morning.
“Ah, a fellow student, I presume. The name is Draco Malfoy. Are you getting your shopping done early as well?”
“Regardless, were you looking to get in some Defense work before Sirius finished up lunch?”
“Then it should be no issue. I doubt the headmaster would have an issue with making an exception.”
Remus had said that people would only truly be able to identify him by his scar. Well, what if he somehow transfigured his scar into disappearing, or cloaking it to make it invisible?
“Well, well, Mister Evans. Let’s take things up a notch or two, shall we?”
With all that under his belt, there's no way Minerva could turn him down for the position of Potions Master at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, right?
Harry stared at the soft hand, dumbfounded. He reached out and shook it.
. Why?”
Harry turned to consider him.
“Yeah, you’re not taking me anywhere. Fuck off.”
Harry looked at him a little sheepishly.
“I would recommend you keep that to yourself, Harry. Not many wizards or witches have that particular ability.” He took a moment to think. “Also, why did you name your snake James?”
He shook the hand, which was calloused and rough.
They finished up at the bookstore and did the rest of the mundane shopping until Remus brought Harry to a pet store. Harry frowned when they stopped.
And with that, Harry was decided. With more confidence than he’d ever expressed in his previous twelve years, he approached his Aunt Petunia and demanded that she adopt the snake James for him.
Harry’s eyebrows furrowed.
“He’s my friend. Where I go, he goes.”
The man’s eyes looked… saddened, almost.
Once a month, on the full moon, he turns and becomes
“I am here for you, my boy. I am here to take you home.”
The first time Harry truly fought for himself was at a pet store. Dudley was being treated to any pet of his choosing for his twelfth birthday, a privilege Harry had never known. He had been brought along simply because Petunia didn’t trust the boy to be alone at the house.
Harry figured there must be an easier way of protecting his privacy without commanding every person who got near him to ignore him. That’s when he got an idea.
Harry’s guard was immediately up. He was prepared to lob fire at the intruder, or blast him with enough water that he was thrown backwards, should the man make any sudden moves towards Harry.
“It’s simply how magic works, dear boy. At least, that’s how we use it.”
“I see. Definitely
“Apparition?”
Harry shrugged, keeping his eyes to the floor.
“No. I’m not sure what he expected, especially since the Calming Drought required the use of a wand to stir it and, as I’m sure you know, I
A man with brown hair and kind, sad eyes spoke.
Harry looked at him curiously.
All-in-all, the welcome wasn’t as horrible as Draco had expected it to be. Quite a few of his old professors were still there, and while he definitely got some upturned noses and cold shoulders, a couple were relatively amicable towards him.
, and not so much the
And that’s how Harry adopted James into his family. His first, true, family.
Remus arrived back at Headquarters feeling glad to be back. Minerva had set him out on an errand for her and only now had he completed it. He found her in the study she had claimed as her office. She looked up and smiled, but her face was tired, her eyes dark.
Arriving back at Grimmauld Place, Severus parted from Shadow, who went upstairs to put his things in his trunk and conspire with the twins most likely. The Potions Master made his rounds of the house, observing the Order members he came across and the Gryffindor students in residence. He wanted as much time as he could observing them since he knew his son was considering making them part of his own inner circle of trusted friends.
Shadow spun to face them. Fred and George wore identical smirking grins, but their cocky attitude turned into open-mouthed shock when they caught sight of his eyes.
Neville looked down the hallway, and seeing no one, he hurried across and knocked on Remus's door. His mentor opened it with a welcome smile and gestured the Gryffindor into his quarters. Neville felt his muscles relax as he settled onto his comfortable couch.
Shadow laughed weakly. He couldn't help it.
"Make him beg!" The snake-man laughed. "I don't hear him begging."
"Thank you. We'll think about it. Unfortunately, we have to leave before someone finds us here. We're kind of hot items right now. We'll come back when we can."
"And people think
"Pritchard is in need of some assistance," Charlie said softly, pretending he didn't see the forbidding expression.
Harry stepped free of the tunnel that led from the Chamber to the forest. Cold instantly washed over him and his insides quavered. Dementors were near. He didn't look around for them. He kept his eyes steady and pinned on the smirking Death Eater waiting for him.
topic, he was going to strangle someone.
Umbridge also grilled the following two groups of that day: the seventh year Ravenclaw/Hufflepuff class and sixth year Slytherin/Gryffindor class. She again demanded to be told who was guilty for the pranks being played on her. No one said a word. At first it was because they saw no reason to give her anything. Then when she forced them to do lines with the blood quills, they wouldn't tell her anything out of spite. Slytherins especially resented being tortured. It was a stupid and short-lived gambit that earned no respect from them; they reacted better to bribes.
"I… I can't… It's
He jerked as the voice finally reached him and he reached our desperately. Strong arms wrapped around him and he sobbed in utter gratitude as he was pulled up off the floor and back onto a bed. He blinked tears from his eyes furiously. Severus came into focus and he crumbled against his father's chest, grabbing onto the front of his shirt as struggled to pull himself together.
Suddenly, Shadow's view of the rest of the pub was obscured as a figure in a dark purple robe stepped in front of him. His hand tightened around his wand as the figure pulled back their hood to reveal a woman in her forties with tight pink skin and pinched, thin lips. Her eyes were a faded hazel and they filled her face.
"Not yet, Headmistress.” Umbridge smiled, but inside she was far from happy.
"How are you?" Remus asked kindly, taking in Shadow's worn expression.
"Okay. Pretty much how I expected it.” Shadow smiled wryly, but then he turned serious. "Be careful. Umbridge is a real bitch. If she finds out about your condition…"
"BEND! Don't break."
Draco reached for him, but Seraphim flinched, uttering a low cry before turning and fleeing the room.
…" Seraphim bellowed, terror and fury rising in his voice.
"Are you here for the Order?" she demanded coldly.
Severus came forward and gently guided Draco into the bed he had so recently abandoned. The fact that the usually fiercely independent blond let him do this told him volumes about Draco's mental and physical state. Severus felt a pang of worry for the teen as Draco's eyes closed before he was even horizontal.
"But it does matter," Severus snarled. "Obviously the boy is still having visions."
Charlie, McGonagall, and Shacklebolt sat at the War Room table across from Severus, Draco, and Harry. All three of their faces were grim. Harry glanced to his right and left, noticing both Severus and Draco had their Slytherin masks on tight. No emotions could be read from their faces or eyes. He sighed and slouched a bit in his chair.
"Flagrate!" Hermione said sharply and a fiery X appeared on the stone, burning brightly.
He was incredibly aroused, his skin twitching. His breath hitched in his throat as he was stimulated by magic and physical touch. He heard cloth rip and the faint scratch of sharp talons along his back. The cool night air caressed his skin, making him hypersensitive to the Black magic that oozed and teased, slowly setting him burning with need.
Reluctantly, Shadow turned and ran for the blond. It was quick work, levitating the unconscious blond with his wand and then casting the spell again, this time wandlessly, on Hermione. George staggered in front of him. Muttering a password, he stepped out onto the water and walked easily across its surface as if it were pavement. Shadow quickly copied him and followed after with the two injured teens.
The magic exploded from him, streaked across the shortening distance between them, and struck the man in the chest. Eyes wide, not even having time to scream, Rodolphus was flung off his feet with a hole half a foot wide in his chest. There was no blood spatter, no gore. It was as if the flesh had just vaporized. The corpse slid backward into a group of strangers, but Seraphim didn't focus on them. They weren't laughing or pointing their sticks at him. Instead, he focused on the brown-haired teen with black orbs for eyes. He knew what he had to do.
Neville stopped and turned to look at the redhead. His eyebrows scrunched in confusion. "What about Shadow?"
"Not much. The Death Eaters have gone to ground again after the attacks." Charlie palmed his wand and sent certain maps into the air to float before their eyes. "These are the areas most likely to hold Death Eater hideouts. We've scouted as best we could, but we can find no definite proof that Neville is being held at any of them."
No one in the class saw his expression melting into a shamed fascination. It felt so good. At first it was a shock, but then the familiar sting, the hypnotic sight of light shimmering off the ruby liquid, it came back to him like he had never stopped. He sank into the embrace of numbing pain and slowly his thoughts disappeared. All he was, everything that existed, was the gentle sting and throb, the tranquil shimmer.
"Shadow…" Seraphim whispered, confused. He turned and reached for the door.
"Nothing," Shadow wheezed, trying to breathe again. His heart was rocketing in his chest and he felt cornered, but he wasn't sure why.
"Looking bad, am I?" She gave a tired laugh. "Nothing's the matter. Except for the fact that the teens have all willingly been working with Severus down in the potions lab. I dread what they are doing, especially with the twins involved." She leaned back in her chair and rubbed at her eyes. "And the dementors were freed from Azkaban, the work of the Death Eaters no doubt, and breeding across Europe. The Foreign Ministers are not happy, but it does get Fudge off our backs, as well as Severus’, for the time being. But the biggest blow is that Macleod Vance, the agent that gave the most detailed reports on the Death Eaters, has been killed. Emmeline is devastated."
He turned to go back when Draco grabbed his arm hard. Harry opened his mouth to pull away when a man with blood drenching half his face came around the corner.
"First, Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade were attacked last night," Draco told him carefully.
They had both come through difficult trials and decided to stand on their own against an unfair world. Draco understood him in a way no one else could, except maybe Severus. But unlike Severus, Draco had actually traveled the hard road of self-discovery with him. It wasn't one-sided. Shadow had seen Draco change and grow, had helped him and had been helped by him. And he was beautiful. Shadow wanted to express how much he cared about Draco, how much he loved him. He wanted to touch him, kiss him; he wanted to physically prove that what was intangible between them was solid and real.
“Talk to James? Yeah. What of it? Can’t you do that?”
Anyway, hope you enjoy it!
Potter looked a little put-out.
Snape stared at Harry still, seemingly unperturbed.
“Well, Harry, he tried. He cast a killing curse at you, leaving a scar on your forehead. It rebounded and destroyed his body instead. For reasons the wizarding world is still unsure of, you survived where no others had. In our world, you are legendary. You are the Boy Who Lived, the Chosen One. The one destined to kill Voldemort for good.”
“Which one is Mr. Evans, Headmaster sir?”
Hermione strode away, a glowing book having caught her eye. Remus turned to Harry.
Harry’s mouth went dry. “He… wants me?”
“My name is Remus Lupin and this is Sirius Black. We were both good friends of your parents’. I am the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor here at Hogwarts, and Sirius is-”
Lupin. But he doesn’t have any family, does he? Why would you be…?” He seemed to ponder this issue for a moment. As Madam Malkin walked back in the room, still fiddling with a few robes similar to the one she was fitting Draco in earlier, Draco’s grey eyes lit up in recognition.
“-Harry Potter! Why didn’t you say so?”
“Yes, it was to be expected that you are completely unfamiliar with our way of life and school subjects. My apologies. The study of Transfigurations is, quite simply, the study of turning one object into another. For instance…”
Harry turned back to the old man, who looked slightly amused at the conversation.
Harry looked at Dumbledore in confusion.
It was clearly a chilly morning, as Potter’s nipples were rock hard underneath his tank top. His muscles were well-defined, not something Draco would ever thought would be associated with Potter. His legs were sturdy and his face smiling.
Draco scowled slightly.
The old man stopped in his tracks, turning back to Harry.
“Harry will most certainly be coming with me. Neither you nor he are safe while he is here.”
“Fine. I’ve made up my mind. I’ll go to stay with Remus and Sirius while I am caught up before this next school year.”
Harry thought about this.
“A ‘passport,’ hm? What is the purpose of that?”
Harry looked down at his feet, hoping his hair could cover the bright blush warming his face.
Harry nodded, thinking.
“I figured you would, Harry. Again, you are your own person and free to make your own decisions. It’s unfair, but your decisions affect more lives than just your own.”
“...thanks for feeding me, I guess.”
Harry learns the names of his protectors, finds some new family, and settles down at Grimmauld Place.
. Seconds later, he was back in existence next to the old man. Dumbledore, evidently. What a strange name.
“Yes, well, about that. Harry, most wizards and witches - and by most, I mean everyone in Britain, at least, and certainly everyone in this room - require a wand and incantations to use magic.”
Ollivander’s eyes twinkled.
Ollivander looked Harry up and down,
“That it is, Harry.”

A few tsks went around the room.
Remus nodded.

“Fine. Let’s go, Arthur.”
He heard a small
Harry touched his hand to the scar and traced his finger along the scar, willing it to now be unnoticable.
Remus’ face darkened. Harry noticed and frowned.
“His name is James.”
His life in America wasn’t any grander than that in Britain. He was still tasked with the cooking, the laundry, and the cleaning. His cousin Dudley was still treated as the next Messiah. Nothing beyond the expectations Harry's aunt and uncle had set for him.
“That I do. I’ve been looking for you for some time.”
Harry nodded, figuring he must stay inside due to the whole “being a criminal” thing.
He turned towards Harry.
He glanced over at the clock just as it struck midnight.
“I already have James. Do I need another companion?”
Harry sat there for a moment, stunned.
Ollivander closed his eyes and nodded.
“So what, you can predict the future now? Do I have a psychic snake as well as
Remus’ face took on a quizzical look.
“That’s good spellwork. Notice-Me-Nots are sixth year material. But didn’t you grow up in the Muggle world?”
Harry sighed.
The lightning-shaped scar on his forehead stood out in bright contrast to his golden brown skin, usually hidden under a mop of black coarse hair. He pushed his hair aside to stare at it with his brilliant green eyes. His aunt and uncle didn’t permit any questions about it, or about the weird things he could do.
“Yes, dear boy. You are the only one to have ever survived a direct attack from him. For this, and reasons we are yet to discover, he is focused on capturing and killing you. Therefore, you will always be protected by members of the Order, no matter where you are.”
Harry stared at the snake, mind running wild.
“Well, why don’t we give it a shot? What, ho, Harry!
How in the hell had he managed to coincidentally name his snake after his father?
Harry jumped with joy on the inside.
Petunia stepped forward, placing a hand on the gun to lower it for Vernon, whose face was purpling.
Draco meets the new staff, as well as a couple of old acquaintances.
Harry coughed uncomfortably.
She smiled even bigger, if that was possible, before her eyes shifted to the many books Lupin had set aside.
She flicked her eyes over to him before turning to Dumbledore.
Minerva ended the interview with a small smile and thanked him for his time.
“Good. Is there anything left?”
“Oh, I’m… sure. Well, I really should go sit down. It was… good to see you, professor.”
He was still giddy when Remus came into the shop.
He knew better than to ask the Dursleys for any presents or recognition of the day. It’s not like they could give him what he truly wanted anyway - a new life. He would turn 15 and go to sleep, only to wake six hours later to begin breakfast before his uncle left for work.
“Very well.”
Draco was never one to pass up a dare.
Petunia and Vernon?”
“Now then, there’s just the matter of where you will stay during your nights before the term begins, Harry. I believe Molly has-”
Creeper.
Harry sauntered over to his seat, walking past the brown-haired man, the black-haired man who had called out “Severus” earlier, and the two redheads.
He walked up to the room that he assumed was Remus’ study, as it was the only room on the second floor whose door was closed, excluding Harry’s own room. He listened at the door for a second before knocking.
“You wouldn’t believe the amount of work it took to get it to this point. But, since I’m stuck here most of the time, I had plenty of time on my hands to get it done.”
It didn’t last long, however. Potter made his way over to Draco and stuck out his hand, a small smile gracing his handsome face.
He tipped his head towards the portly witch as he approached Harry. He handed the boy a small pouch, noticing the happy look on his face.
He raised a hand, silencing her.
With that, he walked in the front door. Harry and Sirius followed.
Sirius interrupted her loudly.
The next one he handed to Harry split nearly in two when he tried to cast a spell.
Ron swore, spinning around and punching the wall.
, Shadow realized.
"Neville!"
"You're dismissed," she said with a tired sigh. Her eyes were filled with disappointment as she watched the men march out of her office and return to their respective quarters.
"I think my father's gone mad."
"You don't know that he will," Severus countered. "He also saved my life and healed Draco and George Weasley of possibly fatal wounds."
"He murdered people," Shadow growled. He stood and walked a bit away, needing space. "That's not admirable."
They went through more memories. Shadow listened to the things Wizarding children talked about as he watched a few of the gatherings Draco had attended with Pansy and the others. He got to see Wizarding customs and birthday rituals, magical games, magical punishments - like sweets being charmed to taste bland or being spelled color-blind or mute. Draco was even spelled asleep a couple times when he was being especially difficult.
Draco exploded as that breathy plea reached his ears. The orgasm rocked him backward and he cried out hoarsely, "Merlin, god, fucking hell!" Shaking, his muscles shivered as wave after wave of pleasure catapulted through his body. Almost blind, Draco collapsed forward and grabbed Shadow's curls in a vicious grip. His other hand snaked between them, tore the button on Shadow's slacks, and slipped around his lover's steel hard need. His hand moved firmly down the hot shaft, pumping in hard, short strokes.
me," Shadow yelled furiously, knocking Draco’s arms away from him violently. "Who else is responsible for his actions?"
"He will not harm you if you don't make any gestures that could be interpreted as threatening," Draco explained, still keeping his voice level and serene. "Please do not come closer. Proximity is considered threatening."
All this shimmered in Draco's intense gaze as he spoke. "Have you seen the Dark Lord, Pansy? With your own eyes? I have. Can you honestly tell me that since his resurrection the Death Eaters have not behaved strangely? Lucius Malfoy was a great and powerful Pureblood wizard, but my father came home changed. He would wear the same clothes for days on end, forgetting to bathe or eat. His temper became unpredictable. He
Finished, he rolled up the parchment and handed it to the serious phantom. He still found it amusing to think that the real Godric was more like Percy than the Marauders. Godric disappeared without a sound or a word of goodbye. Shadow shook his head, bemused.
Sirius threw his head back and gave a barking laugh. The tension left his shoulders and arms as he grinned at his godson. "I can live with that," he chuckled.
The Potions Master had his hair pulled back in a low, short pony-tail. Worn like that, it looked shiny instead of greasy, but it revealed his hard, chiseled face. His father had been through too much to look young and his features were never considered beautiful. His skin was pale in a sallow way, his nose was large and hooked, and his eyes were deep-set and almost as black as his pupils. But he looked respectable and powerful. That mattered more than beauty in most arenas anyway.
“Are you sure about that? From what I can tell, you are already intimately familiar with wandless magic. I think, at this point, trying to use a wand would be more of a hindrance than a help.”
“Well, I, um… I don’t know what my parents do, or,
"Wonderful. I look forward to seeing you at the Sorting Ceremony, then. Here's hoping for Slytherin!"
Sirius chuckled darkly.
next to the old man.
Harry looked around for the voice, before settling his gaze back onto the python, frightened.
“I’m afraid our school doesn’t allow-”
“Is this Diagon Alley?”
Well, it’s not like
A look of shame crossed Sirius’ face.
Harry looked down at James, nodding. Then he looked up at Dumbledore.
Dumbledore looked up at Harry, eyes widened in amazement.
Draco nodded.
He stepped back onto the steps leading into the house and held out his arm.
Harry nodded, excited that he was the subject of a veritable shopping spree for the first time in his life.
The corners of Draco’s mouth turned down. That hurt, being reminded of such a trivial thing amongst thousands that he’d missed out on.
“Those are the symbols for Gryffindor house. It’s the house that Sirius, James, Lily, and I were all sorted into at Hogwarts. I wouldn’t be surprised if you followed in your parents’ footsteps with the sorting, but we can change the decor based upon whichever house you are sorted into.” He looked at James. “What’s its name?”
“Now, Harry, there are members of a group who have worked especially hard to recover you from the Muggle world behind this door, some of which could be considered your family. I ask you to keep an open mind for the discussion that is about to happen.”
“Madam, would you please give us a moment?”
Molly tsked and waved a hand dismissively.
He and Sirius - Remus told him to call him Padfoot in public - walked on over the Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions. Sirius laid down out front, dozing slightly under the shade. Harry walked into the store.
Remus’ expression went back to being friendly.
Inside was an equally ancient-looking man whom Harry presumed was Ollivander. The old man looked up at Harry’s entrance. His mouth opened slightly as he gazed at the boy.
Draco looked at Potter curiously. Why did the man insist on using his first name?
When Uncle Vernon was promoted, given a position as a General Executive of a new branch of his company in America, Harry sighed and said nothing. After all, the policy his family held for him was “be neither seen nor heard.” And that’s what he did, good boy that he was - he was neither seen nor heard. Practically, for all intents and purposes, the boy was invisible.
Harry did so, blasting a small stream of fire at the wizard.
Remus shushed him. Harry felt a small spark of irritation run through his chest.
in the secluded alleyway of Diagon Alley. Remus had Side-Alonged Harry and Sirius went on his own. The minute Sirius’ stomach settled, he crouched to the ground and began to morph into his animorphmagus form.
The door slammed behind him. He shrugged and looked ahead, grabbing the old man's arm, never to look back.
“But, if it’s regulated, then why doesn’t the Ministry of Magic know about Sirius’ form?”
Soon he was finished and whisked James up to his shoulder.
“She seems wonderful.”
“I thought that might do the trick. You are most curious, Mister Evans. Phoenix feather wands are some of the hardest to master and are incredibly rare and potent. The rarity of this wand is tenfold that of a standard phoenix feather wand, as the phoenix who donated its tail feather for it only donated two in its lifetime. Could you guess who wields the wand with the other feather?”
Dumbledore nodded.
Harry sat raptured, listening to Remus’ possible explanation. He definitely took note that Remus was just guessing, but it made a lot of sense to Harry. He wondered if he could teach his way of using magic to others, but put that thought aside for now. Now was the time to learn, the time to embroil himself in the world he never knew existed and, maybe later, he could explore what his magic truly meant to him.
The witch sighed and stood up.
world. It’s what’s best for him!”
Harry hummed in response. He set James down on the floor and his bag on a desk.
Harry beat him to the punch, narrowing his eyes.
Harry followed Remus and Sirius through the fire to Grimmauld Place, taking James and his backpack with him.
“You said, ‘destined to kill him
Sirius’ anger faded at these words.
“A wand? Incantations? Why?” Once he finished the drink, he simply tossed it to the side and vanished it. A new round of gasps arose.
Harry nodded.
outside of his house. He stood up and glanced out the window, watching a person in a heavy, billowing coat walking past the house. They brought out what must’ve been a lighter, as it lit up brightly at the tip. They waved it around, glancing at his house before snuffing out the light. The figure continued on.
When Harry was cornered, he closed his eyes in fear and brought his hands in front of him to protect himself. You could imagine his surprise when each of the boys suddenly started spurting blood from their broken noses and ran away screaming.
“Could I… could I get a drink?”
Loved ones. That’s a stretch.
Remus thought on this for a second.
The old man nodded. “Certainly. Dobby?”
“Voldemort.”
“That’s so cool.”
They made their way out onto the street and walked down a short distance. They stopped outside of a run-down bar with a rusting “Leaky Cauldron” sign hanging in front of it.
He turned to look where Harry was, a painting of a woman actively brushing her hair under water. It was gorgeous, with her silky golden hair flowing in a halo around her head.
Harry nodded enthusiastically.
Just as Dumbledore predicted, Harry was quite easily able to teleport -
The old man smiled softly.
With the letter hopefully telling him what he wanted to hear, that would end today. It was a week before the start of term at Hogwarts, and he would be informed of the decision today.
Sirius and Remus both barked out a laugh, one more animalistic than the other.
He swiped his finger through the air, cutting the packaging and bringing out one of the long, white cigarettes. He tossed the rest on the bed and stuck it in his mouth, pressing a finger to the end of it to light it.
“Well, well. It appears the
that. Magic.”
“It is hardly past 6am. What the hell are you doing at my door?”
“That’s not what I meant and you know it, Sirius.” She turned to Harry. “Harry, Remus is… he’s a
Everything seemed to freeze for Harry.
Harry concentrated on the man and whispered under his breath, “
“I just mean that he’ll be with children his own age to be around. He can stay in Ron’s room, I’m sure they’ll make quick friends.”
“My apologies. So, then, who are you staying with if I may ask? Perhaps I know them.”
“Well, this is all fine and dandy, but I have some business to attend to.” He stepped towards the large fireplace in the office, grabbed a handful of green powder, and tossed it into the fire. It flared green and he shouted out an address before stepping into the flames.
“Correct. Your wand’s twin is powerful, Mister Evans. The wizard that wields it is a terrible man, but he has done incredible feats with it. Do take care.”
“What’s with the lions?”
“Yeah, I’m working with Professor McGonagall to catch up.”
handle this strange midnight visitor. Whatever.
have a rightful claim to Harry's protection as his Godfather. He will stay there unless he decides otherwise.”
Draco tried not to get too distracted by him. Fantasizing about old school rivals was not what he was here to do.
Harry shuffled his feet.
if you like…” He shot a glare at Kreacher, daring him to question the decision. “...but there is absolutely no expectation upon you to do that.”
Madam Malkin was an old, robust witch. She was kneeling on the ground next to a platform, pinning needles into a set of formal robes on a young man.
Harry nodded.
“I wonder…”
The man nodded, validating his questions. He seemed very pompous to Harry.
“Yes, Professor Potter. Neither I, you. It is a… pleasant surprise to see you here. What do you teach?”
Remus thought this was a curious request but complied.
She turned to the fireplace, lit it green with the powder, and called out an address before stepping through.
“He has arisen.”
“Morning, Draco!”
Remus looked at him.
“Albus, please-”
“Thank you, professor. It was nice to meet you, Harry!”
“Well… ready for a new life, James?”
Harry furrowed his brows.
Harry nodded.
Molly spoke up. “It’s the school you’re in. Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry.”
“My apologies, Mister Evans. Have you received your wand yet?” He looked at her.
Hermione’s eyes lit up.
He eventually fell into a fitful sleep with James curled up next to him.
After all, by this point there had been plenty of strange occurrences surrounding Harry - teleportations to roofs, vanishing of bullies, starting of fires - all unintentional, of course, but nothing that Aunt Petunia would believe. In her eyes, Harry was a miscreant who loved causing trouble - always had been and always would be. The fact that this trouble seemed impossible for such a young boy was never questioned nor mentioned in the Dursley household. Odd things happened and Harry was blamed. Plain and simple.
Harry stepped back, feeling his hand start to heat up. He was a moment away from blasting a stream of fire at the weirdo.
Harry gave him a small smile and closed the door behind the man.
older and uglier) ran at him and started hitting him with a wooden spoon screaming about the half-blood trying to steal his job. Harry was quick to put the pans down and back away from the stove, the menacing creature staring daggers at him.
Harry nodded, a firm look in his eyes.
“Now then, since you can apparate onto Hogwarts grounds, I would ask you to appear in this office tomorrow morning at ten AM to begin your lessons with Professor McGonagall. Sleep well, Harry.”
The old man made his way behind a large desk and sat down, sighing. He straightened his robes and looked up at Harry, a small smile decorating his face.
Harry had the decency to not ask why Sirius was anxious, assuming it was him in the first place, and gave a small chuckle. He decided to go upstairs and see what Remus was doing.
Draco and Harry have a meaningful conversation over breakfast.
Harry nodded at her. She was a very stern woman, who clearly got straight to the point.
"No!" Neville cried and then hastily clamped his mouth shut. They were trying to trick him!
"I'll be here," Charlie continued, "watching the action through the scrying bowl. I'll contact you through the phoenix pins if something goes wrong or to warn you of incoming attacks as much as I can."
"Gee," he said with mocking gentleness. "I didn't know I intimidated you so much. We don't have to if you don't want."
"Well, I hang out with Ginny and the twins mostly when I'm not being tested by the professors to see what level I'm at. Today is my Potion exam." Shadow moved to sit on the couch and Remus sat across from him.
Neville jumped and spun around. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to wake you, I just wanted to, I mean, look out the, I just…"
a deeper voice echoed the first.
Shadow got up from the floor and walked quickly out of the room. Neville stood more slowly, trying to get his bearings. It didn't take long to recognize Harry's room back at the house. He sighed in relief and hurried after his brother. He made it to the doorway just as he saw the bathroom door shut and heard the sound of a lock turning.
"Help!" Neville cried, bursting into the house. Remus and Draco came running out of the library. Sirius came skidding over from the dining room. Severus appeared at the top of the stairs. "Harry! Seizure!
Shadow tensed, ears straining. Had someone come in? Had he heard something? Heart rocketing in his chest, he didn't dare to breathe. He'd been trapped, blind, for hours it seemed. Was someone finally using the darkness as cover for an attack? Crouching, he forced his eyes closed and silently brought in air through his mouth.
The male garbled something at the fledgling. The female obediently sat and occupied herself with some objects that were covered in her scent while his soon-mate came toward him, his intent obvious. He wanted to hunt with him. Seraphim tilted his head, considering it. It was better for the fledgling if one of them remained with her, but the female was obviously content alone.
"Draco…" he whispered. He was terrified speaking would tip the balance and wake Demon, but he decided that he couldn't just stand there silent as the worst happened.
Remus held his gaze. "It wasn't your fault, Severus, and it turned out all right."
Marissa looked over at Shadow and Draco doubtfully.
"What about?" Severus asked with a dark frown.
"He lied to us!" Ron yelled. "Don't act like we were the only ones who weren't good friends! We deserve to know what the hell is going on!"
Bill nodded.
. He knew he could get killed. He must have done something to ensure the locket wouldn't be lost forever. I know I would!"
Severus squeezed his fingers. "You had every reason to have a moment of hysterics, Shadow. We do not look down on you for that momentary weakness. We all have them. I would only wish that you felt you could have unburdened to us."
Neville froze and stared down at the clothes he had in his hands. Head hanging, he closed his eyes and tried to keep from screaming. Taking a few deep breaths, he turned and faced his mentor. He opened his eyes and Remus winced at the self-hate he saw. "I… Explain it to him somehow… No… Here. I'll write him a letter. Take it to him… I just… I can't see him. I don't want to hurt him and I don't have it settled in my head yet. Draco will be there and I just… I can't yet. Please?"
Severus lifted an eyebrow. "And yet you are kissing Draco."
regret going to Neville's in that state. I wasn't thinking clearly. I guess I was afraid to come and hear about my condition. It would make it real, I suppose, but it wasn't so bad, really. At least we got good news with the bad." He laughed weakly.
"Draco! DRACO!" he yelled as he ran down the circular hall with many doors.
"Only the Dark Lord or Potter can touch the prophecy orb," Severus said with equal regret.
Yes. This was exactly what they needed. It was too bad Severus was so stuck up his own arse that he couldn't see it. Well, he'd just have to make sure he grabbed enough cake that he could bring the party back with him. Draco and Shadow definitely needed a break and he wasn't about to let Snivellus take that away from them.
"But not before we do something to slow down Mad-Eye," George said, arching his eyebrow suggestively.
a new voice interrupted.
"Oh no!" Neville scrambled back toward the door. "No, Luna. I can't!"
"Seriously, Dad, who cares? Boy's Boy," Shadow insisted, staring up at Severus in consternation.
"For now," Draco said in disgust, throwing the paper down. "But martial law is right around the corner. Welcome to Hogwarts, the Induction Camp for the Ministry. Here all the little children are indoctrinated into being mindless, Ministry-abiding citizens."
"What do you mean?" Shadow asked, smiling at his friend's antics. "You're just jealous I'm smarter than you."
The Wizengamot had listened to their arguments without comment until finally ruling in favor of Minerva, stating that without the Order's help at Azkaban they would have suffered far greater losses. However, she had been ordered to disband the Order and transfer the members over to the MLE where they would be inducted as Aurors. The reason for this was stated that they needed to stand united.
"There you are," Remus said and gestured grandly at the full tub. "It's all ready for you."
"Go on now," he said gently as he stepped forward toward Amycus.
"Yeah. We need help taking care of her." Shadow sighed and glanced at his godfather. "You're not busy. Can you watch her?"
"Seph, wait." Draco stepped up to the alter's side, but he was careful not to get between him and the threat. "This is Shadow's father. Remember? Hurting him will hurt Shadow. That will hurt you. Please. I don't want you to get hurt. Put the knife down. Severus won't hurt you, I promise."
"Ah, he's awake. How do you feel?"
Thankfully, the bottom spectator seats were empty. Only the top rows were full. The lighting was so dim, the figures were shadowy and ominous. Neither Severus nor Shadow stepped further in the room. Carefully, gently, Shadow opened his senses. Severus was shielding, but anticipation and harsh suspicion snapped around the people sitting up high.
What was he supposed to do now? The Dark Lord might be alive… His best friend might be dead… and his father had lost it… What was he going to do? What
Neville woke and smiled at the summer sun that was pouring in through his window. That was the one good thing about coming home. He got to work outside more freely. Flinging his bed-covers back, he got dressed in some clothes he put aside for gardening. He found his grandmother and uncle already at the breakfast table.
"A little one!" the Fat Lady said, startled.
"Be careful," Neville sighed. He stood and pulled his brother to his feet. "It's already past curfew. We should go."
"Speaking of the young…" Remus squared his shoulders and sat straight in his chair. "I have news."
Severus nodded sharply and led the way down to his office.
Shadow stared at him incredulously. "Are you crazy?"
"Yeah," Ron said thickly. He lifted his eyes to Neville. "Yeah, and I'm not going to mess this up. Shadow's my friend. We may not be best friends, but that's okay. I'd rather have something real."
Severus obliged him after one last pat on the shoulder. "From what I understand, I think the best thing we can do is return to Grimmauld Place. The Triad will not be pleased with you disappearing again.”
Severus stood in the hallway for a moment more. He pulled the black silk robe closer around his body. He could feel the thin scar over his chest where he had made the cut. His limbs still trembled faintly, though the potion he had consumed after the ritual had helped greatly. It was done. Shadow was his in blood and name. He had a son.
“So, James… Do you
“Yes, I expected Severus might be somewhat… difficult for you to get along with. He and your father were always at odds with each other in school.”
One of life’s mysteries, he supposed.
“Very well, Harry
He thought on it more, but kept coming up blank.
no wand yet.”
on his window.
“Harry, please, you don’t know everything about-”
Magic.
Harry nodded, a pleased smile crossing his face before darkening slightly.
“No, Harry. From methods we are unaware of, Voldemort arose from the dead last year. At least, that is what intelligence reports state.”
The bar was, indeed, not run down as Harry had thought. It was somewhat quaint and quiet, but Harry suspected that might be due to it being the middle of the afternoon, post-lunch rush. There were a few witches off in the corner and what he suspected to be a goblin at the counter. An old man behind the counter greeted Remus before his eyes shifted to Harry and narrowed.
charm.
Remus nodded.
Harry’s stomach settled. He felt queasy.
Harry’s eyes widened at the first mention of Sirius’ name.
Harry raised his hand and stretched for the goblet, making it soar through the air and land in his grasp. Not a drop was spilled.
“Here you are, Harry. Anything happen while I was at Gringotts?”
“Well, it’s a bit of a long story. He and your dad both had unregistered animorphmagus forms in order to keep me company when I turned at the full moon during our Hogwarts days.”
“I didn’t
“No, Harry, you can’t apparate within-”
Remus nodded and gestured to follow him. He led Harry up two flights of stairs before opening a door into a room decorated with red-and-gold banners with lions featured on them. Everything in the room followed this coloring scheme.
“Kreacher, what are you doing?!” Sirius yelled at him, waving his wand to knock the wooden spoon out of Kreacher’s hand.
“Um, no, Professor. But I don’t need it.” He waved his hand over the needle. When it fully passed over and returned to view, there was a matchstick sitting on the table. The professor stared at it in awe.
A minute later, three more knocks, louder and more insistent, resonated through the house.
Harry sat anxiously on the floor of his room. Luckily for him, America didn’t really have cupboards under stairs. Even though his room was still the smallest in the two-story house, it was still, at least, a room.
Harry chuckled, uncomfortable.
They died when I was young.”
It was especially awkward now.
“My name is Arthur Weasley, and this is my wife, Molly. We have a son your age who attends Hogwarts.”
Harry smiled.
She brought out a goblet, which was silver, and waved a complicated set of movements over it with her wand while uttering words under her breath. She finally tapped it, turning the silver goblet into a small, stone statue of a cat.
Harry nodded slowly.
“Well… uh… I can already
“And I, dear boy, am Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts and leader of the Order of the Phoenix. There are other members who are not here tonight due to current missions, but this group of people will be centrally responsible for protecting you.”
The old man sighed. “Please put that away, Severus. Harry doesn’t need to-”
Harry’s stomach clenched.
will keep him safe.” He turned towards Harry. "You're a wizard, Harry, and it's time for you to come home."
