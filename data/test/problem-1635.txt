Of the mountain… of stepping out of the cabin into the valley, barefoot and shirtless, proof of Charlie’s love still splattered across his stomach. Of a cold that is feather-light and refreshing rather than biting. Of the cry of a dragon, and not being able to tell if it’s just a few hundred yards away, cloaked in the mist, or on the next mountain. Of Charlie coming to stand behind him, to kiss where his neck joins his shoulder, pulling him close with one hand, pressing a cup of tea into his hand with the other.
Harry is still cupping his cheek, his fingers tangling in his hair. His hand is still trembling. “So good… touching me… feels so good…”
Draco tries—and only partly succeeds—to stifle a flinch. He feels his fingers tighten on Harry’s wrist.
The clock in the hall chimes. Midnight. It’s Draco’s turn to pull back. “I… I have to go.”
The bottom step creaks and Harry shuffles into the kitchen, bare-chested and looking a little worse for wear; at least he has bothered to put on pajama bottoms.

Draco does.
while Voldemort used the Cruciatus curse on me… when he tried to kill me… I thought I was going to die.” Harry takes a deep breath. “I promise you, Draco, your father doesn’t care about a few cuts on my hand.”
He did it for the same reason that he is always first into the office in the mornings, and the reason he is always last to leave. The reason he always works harder than he needs to… maybe even harder than he

Harry has mixed feelings about the flat, but it’s all he can afford without a trip to Gringotts, which would alert the Wizarding world to his presence and entirely defeat the purpose of a Muggle flat in the first place.
Draco takes control of the kiss then, stroking Harry’s tongue with his own, wishing with all his heart that the

“Do I look all right?” Malfoy’s sneer has returned, if only slightly.

The suddenness of it hits Draco like a punch to the stomach.
His pause must have been a little too long because Hermione’s face got a bit redder. “Please don’t be offended, Malfoy! It’s just that Harry said that the broth really bothered you and… well… I thought I’d make a pizza since you won’t have… had it before.”

.” Draco doesn’t say anything else, he just presses his lips to Harry’s forehead. His fingers move gently through Harry’s hair.
The vision faded quickly, but not before a sick jolt of anticipation left Harry with very little hope that he would stay that way.
“You’ll leave when you’re ready, Harry,” Charlie whispers, cradling his face in the way that makes Harry feel as though he can float. “You’ll not leave a moment before that, or stay a moment longer. Do you understand?”
Harry’s tongue brushes against Draco’s lower lip before the kisses slide away, down his jaw, to the spot on his neck that he loves so much. Draco throws his head back, giving Harry better access, and moans.

His shout of surprise as he nearly trips over Kreacher makes no sound.

“What?” Softly.
Draco picks up his coffee. “You’re leaving because of me, aren’t you?” he says quietly. He’s overheard him arguing with Harry about it. “Because Harry’s right—there’s lots of room… you don’t have to…”

“Although, I fully expect you to play the hero again, and get me out.”
“You haven’t kissed him yet, Uncle Harry.”

That’s not true.

is scary. But that one was from a guy.”
Smug satisfaction pinches Pansy’s face. “The choker, darling. The choker Harry salivated over at brunch last week. You were practically sitting in his lap, pet.” She puts her straw between her teeth and smirks.
Harry sighs. “Fine, but you owe me a dozen chocolate frogs, yeah?”
“I burned a wish once,” Luna says. She tucks her arm into Theo’s. “I’ve always wanted to study mistletoe kissing mites.”
“Trust me. I told you it was exciting.” Draco swings his leg. His velvet-clad foot taps Harry’s chair to a beat matching the pitter-pat of Harry’s heart. The buckle capping the top of his loafer glints in the lamplight, catching Harry’s attention like a Niffler with a gold sequin.

“If you must know, my
Draco tips the liquor into his mouth, Adam’s apple bobbing as he swallows, a wave beneath the silver links of that fucking choker.
Petal-soft lips eagerly open Harry’s mouth and a strong wind rises up around them. Tornadoes tear through the curtains, scattering papers and lifting Harry’s fringe, while he quietly melts into the twist of a velvet tongue. The wind howls, a freight train barrelling down until, with a loud pop, the fire snuffs out entirely in a tiny wisp of smoke.
“It is.” Malfoy cinches his grin around the cigarette, inhaling his cheeks hollow.
“I always like to look impeccable.” Draco cards his fingers through Harry’s hair. “But yes, I did select my ensemble with you in mind.”
“The student council meeting was annoying.” Harry rests his chin on his bicep and fiddles with one of Draco’s pens. “If you ask me, protective socket covers for all the bathrooms is a shit graduating class school gift.”
“Oh!” Luna says, radish earrings swinging. “The Magical Fire Brigade! I knew I smelled a Fire Imp.”
The door slams open. Harry peeks through his fingers, and his heart plunges to his knees. Draco’s wearing his Quidditch jersey, and it’s cute as fuck.
“With potatoes and pumpkin pasties,” Ron adds. His stomach growls, and he looks at Harry with big doe eyes.
“Sod off!” Harry hops off the counter. He jabs two fingers into the icing and swipes it on Ron’s jaw. A hunk drips off and lands on one of the balloon boobs.
The bottom of Harry’s stomach drops out. And just as he fixes his gaze on Draco striding into the kitchen, nose aloft, Ron plucks the dick hat off Lottie and places it tenderly on Harry’s head.
“Too bad it wasn’t their first,” Ginny says.
Harry scoffs. “Whatever, I’ll just…” He sets the bottles to rights with a sweep of his hand. Another little complicated flourish and the icing swirls and covers up where their fingers had been. The golden letters aren’t quite as tidy and the butterflies still lurch about, so he adds an extra dusting of pink sugar crystals to the strawberries.
“No,” Draco repeats. He tangles his fingers into Harry’s hair, eyes sparking hope into Harry’s chest. “The day after that we will prove Weasley’s theory about handspan.”
Draco blushes and shoves Harry’s face away with the pants. “Heathen,” he says fondly.
Wind howls through the pub’s alleyway like the hollow note singing from the bottleneck of a stout. Another lightning strike bleaches Harry’s vision, but it’s the crack of Apparition a moment later that shocks him. His magic eddies in his palms, coiled and ready.

. Harry bites his tongue to keep from moaning.
“I can’t wait for you to see what I’m wearing underneath my pinstripes.”
“Hey, blondie,” a greasy voice cuts through the rain. A Muggle bloke stands nearby—too close, Harry thinks. The man sways in a drunken cloud of stale beer. “You got a cigarette for me?” He licks his lips, leering at Malfoy, and Harry’s magical hackles rise.
Draco rolls his eyes. “Bollocks. Everybody loves ice cream.”

Ron’s eyes glaze wistfully. “Mmmm, bramble jam.”
Draco lifts a dark approving brow and reaches into the car to turn off the ignition. Harry sneaks a peek at his arse in his trousers as he stretches. The letterman jacket rides up, taking Draco’s shirt with it. Sunlight glints off the fine pale hairs dusting Draco’s lower back. Harry’s skin tingles and he adjusts himself in his jeans, remembering too late that he isn’t wearing underwear. The button-fly seam catches the edge of his cock
Enough is enough.
He nods his head at words coming out of Draco’s mouth, willing Draco to
Pansy grins. “Maybe they swapped more than spit.”
“You’ll be late, too,” Draco says. “And you have a test.”
He squares his shoulders and lifts his chin. The jersey’s collar slips off his shoulder, baring his bony collarbone. Harry’s brain short-circuits.
Pansy drapes her arm on Hermione’s shoulder. “Fucking finally.”
“And to wish you luck on the test.”
He presses a firm thumb against the corner of Harry’s mouth and with a rough swipe, delivers a bead of ice cream to his own mouth. Harry’s magic flares up his back, popping at each vertebra like WWW firecrackers on a string. With each crack, the flowers covering the Christmas tree ignite one by one.
Harry tugs at a curl caught in his glasses. “Don’t know what you mean."
when the jersey’s sleeves cover Draco’s hands so that his fingertips peek out?
By Harry’s next birthday, the Ministry had proclaimed his day of birth a national holiday. Ron laughed himself hoarse at Harry’s visage on the banners, and Harry decided at that moment that 21 was a perfectly respectable number of birthdays to have had.

Malfoy stares. Rain pelts his face and drips from his eyelashes. He summons a crumpled pack of cigarettes out of his back pocket, and in two steps he’s in front of Harry, Amazonian-tall and weed-thin. A crescent bruise mars his cheekbone.
Sure, two weeks ago, he had snogged Draco sloppily in the loo at that bar. But it was whatever, a one-off fueled by beer goggles and Draco’s tight leather trousers. Those bloody trousers should be

Harry snorts.
Harry’s magic hiccoughs in his chest and pushes a tingle through his arms to his fingertips. The violet flame flickers to life again at the parchment’s corner. Harry’s alarmed sputter extinguishes it.
Theo blushes to the tips of his ears and stumbles out of the room after Percy, a beaming Luna hanging on his arm. The remaining firefighters vanish in whooshes of Apparition, leaving Harry alone with Draco.
“Obliviate me, Gin!” Ron yells into the blanket. “I beg of you!”
“I know.” Draco fists Harry’s curls briefly, eliciting a cascade of promising thrills down Harry’s spine, before releasing him. “I’m leaving,” he calls out to the heathens, “in three… two…” He exits the kitchen with a parting wink.
He snags a blackberry from a vine heavy with shiny, plump fruit, and bites into it. Dark juice stains the dip cleaving his bottom lip, and Harry
Hermione’s fading blush deepens again. “You know, I love it when you talk Muggle science.” Theo ducks his head bashfully.
A hex slices through the air, sizzling orange, and grazes Harry’s shoulder. Draco stumbles back, and another hex explodes a grouping of berries overhead, splashing berry shrapnel over Draco again.
Draco’s back stiffens. “And how did the salve I brewed for that mistletoe rash work for you, Mr December?”
“Cheers,” Harry says.
“Bollocks,” Draco mutters, and Harry couldn’t agree more, because fuck, he could drown in Draco’s mouth all day.
Ginny peers over Luna’s shoulder. “You prats better repair it before Malfoy sees it.”
Hermione’s suspicious squint in response to Harry’s query at dinner about where one might find a sloth brain, a Class A Controlled Substance required to brew the Draught of Living Death, put any subversive plan to rest.

Ruddy splotches bloom on Draco’s neck, and he fumbles with the button until finally, with a strangled growl he grabs his wand and Vanishes his trousers and pants. His cock, full and flushed, swings and taps Harry’s cheek.
Draco unfolds himself from Harry’s lap and stands. Harry’s quite impressed at the level of dignity with which he smooths out the wrinkles from his unbuttoned dress shirt.
“So.” Draco stares at the ground. “Penises these days then, Potter?” He lifts his gaze to meet Harry’s, his eyes so focused Harry’s heart pulses out one, two, three quick beats.
“If you’d quit feeling up the melons, it wouldn’t be a problem,” Ginny says.
“Well, I mean the room was already quite messy…” Draco pauses. He frowns, brows knitting together, body tensing.
“You’re my problem.”
Ron and Ginny both say, ”been in the Prewett family for generations!”
, I had nothing to do with the alarm!” Harry’s raised voice attracts the attention of students nearby. He hisses, “And we didn’t kiss!
Luna smiles, eyes bright. “Fancy pants at Fortescue’s!”
“She…?”
“What the fuck, Weasley?” Draco cries, cringing as another hex whizzes by.
“I like you wearing my jacket.”
In retrospect, maybe too much. Harry’s 19th birthday, orchestrated by the Weasley brothers, can never be discussed—the Gryffindor lads all forged an Unbreakable Vow. A small rash blooms on Harry’s elbows if he even

a masochist, Harry chances a darting glance at Draco. Draco hides a smirk behind his glass. Pansy, scarlet lips stretched into a wide smirk, leans to whisper in Draco’s blushing ear.
“You’re forgiven,” Molly says, patting Harry and Draco’s cheeks in turn. “And the jam you shall have! I’ll send Ron out to fetch more berries. Besides,” she says over his protests, “he needs to collect those pails, they’ve—”
. The aster purple shifts Draco’s grey eyes violet, and the pearly buttons glint. Harry’s magic expands to push hot against the inside of his skin.
“And I like that.
, he hopes he put on deodorant. “I mean, cock is brilliant, too. I’ve nothing against cock. I’ve got a cock on my… head,” he finishes lamely.
Ginny pours out champagne and hands Harry a glass. “Blink twice if you want me to mercy kill you.”
And on his fucking birthday!

Draco enters the kitchen then, polished and posh in his crisp oxford, looking fresh and un-harried. “Good morning, all,” he says, smiling brightly, morning prick that he is.
Draco holds up the pail and shrugs, throwing a leg over the hedge.
“It’s official. I love my birthday,” Harry announces.
Draco sets a glass next to Harry’s elbow and moves around to Harry’s side of the desk. Up close, the velvet shifts through deep blues and violets in the golden light from the singular desk lamp because
“It’s roast pork tonight,” Greg says wistfully.
“Think this is funny, do you?”
Draco halts and stares, the twist of his lips stretching the moment thin. Petals drift in the wind around their feet.
Granted, the first year Malfoy appointed himself the Master of Ceremonies—
Luna lights an incense stick with a tiny pink flame from the tip of her wand. Harry settles back in his chair, content to let Percy and Luna’s soft conversation drift over him on patchouli and bergamot laced smoke. Outside, the snowfall mesmerises, filling the gaps between the seconds.
Luna vanishes stale tea rings from the inside of mugs and pours a fresh dandelion brew. “Creative genius has no timeline,” she says.
“And we wonder where Lily gets it.” Draco opens the freezer and removes a carton of vanilla ice cream. “I’ve bought you five minutes,” he says, placing the carton on the table. “What say we put that filthy little mouth of yours to good use after I drop the kids at school?”
I was bloody joking.”
The door slams open and Percy bursts in, his bowtie askew, his hands fluttering frantically. “Merlin’s saggy ballsack! What is happening in—” He halts so abruptly Luna collides with his back.
Draco grins and Harry leans in, only to pause at a strangled sound.
Harry glances around the room. His eyes skim over Draco and then dart back to linger. Draco’s heart leaps up into his throat and thrums against the cold links of his sterling choker—the same choker Harry has admired. From afar, yes, but more recently, up close and personal at Hermione and Theo’s engagement party last week. But Draco wore the jewelry because it suits his ensemble, and
“Look at you,” Pansy says. “Preening like a bloody peacock. When will the eye fucking progress to actual fucking?” She stabs her straw at a cherry swimming at the bottom of her drink. “I’m already bored.”
“That’s what I mean,” Draco grumbles, pressing his forehead to Harry’s. His fingers tangle in Harry’s hair. “Prat.”
Something cold and nasty, foul but familiar, skitters around in Draco’s chest. “My, my, my, isn’t she droll, Harry’s ex with whom he is still so chummy.” Draco doesn’t realize he’s standing until Hermione rubs her foot over his calf.
And he’s not wearing a shirt.
He avoids Draco like Dragon Pox.
Draco’s maniacal laugh explodes from the den, and Harry tries not to look, he really does. But how can he resist when Draco’s head tilts back like that to elongate his sinuous neck? When his Adam's apple slides smoothly under nearly-translucent skin with each chuckle? Harry sucks his drink through his straw until air gurgles around the ice.
Harry presses his palms against the wall and widens his stance, presenting. “I would. How about you?”

spelled out in gold. He holds the glob up to Harry’s lips. “Take it, Potter. You know you want it.”
“So, Pans,” Theo says, “where did Mr. Longbottom scamper off to anyway?”
“Come back to me.” Draco sucks Harry’s earlobe between his teeth, each pull of soft lips spreading the muscles in Harry’s groin, each suck of hot tongue a throb through Harry’s cock.
Harry drops another berry into the pail, and Draco takes hold of his wrist. Red welts and nettle pricks mar the skin on the back of Harry’s hand.
“Now now, Pans,” Theo says. “Let’s be fair. It was only his hand groping the Golden lap.”
Ron pulls an orange beanie crowned with a large pom over his buzz cut and groans into a shoulder sag. “It’s too late in the season for blackberries.”
, Jack Frost, or whatever.
From amidst wrestling arms and wild hair, James and Albus both yell, “
“A pity and a… penance.” Ron’s voice trails off, attention caught by someone headed towards them, away from the school. “Hello. What have we here? Not even first bell and ditching already?"
“Leather at the Leaky!” Draco pulls Luna into a waltz. “Battenburg at brunch!”
Another hex pops nearby and fizzles out in the crisp autumn air. Draco bursts out laughing and, glancing over his shoulder, extends his arm to offer Harry his hand.
“If you say so. Oh, wait.” Ron smirks. “You have. A lot. A lot a lot. A laahhh—”
“There are other Aurors—” he begins.
Ron catches the ball before it smacks him in the face. “Says you. Harry and I de-gnomed the garden before sunrise. Oi, mate!”
“Ok, well!” Ron claps his hands. “On that note, I gotta run. If I’m tardy again, McGonagall will skin me alive and make a football from my freckled hide. I’ll leave you”—he points at Draco—“in our star quarterback’s capable and rather large hands.” He grabs Harry’s wrist and waves his arm about. “Span of ten inches. Good for palming footballs… and other things.” He winks and departs, answering his ringing phone. “Hi babe! I’m walking in the doors right now…”
“Steady on,” she says, eyebrow lifting.
“You can’t be serious,” Percy says. He squints at a photo of a man wearing what looks like a lace romper with a leather codpiece and appeals to Harry. “He can’t be serious.”
Ron hums and snuggles his head into her hands. “Boners are a way of life, babe, as you well know—
“Oh, you
Draco strides in dressed for the party in a raw silk bespoke tuxedo in the exact dovetail grey colour as his eyes. A mink-lined cape billows around him as he marches to Harry’s desk, pointy chin stuck out above a large bow offset at his shoulder. The irritated pinch of his mouth hollows his cheeks, sharpening the cut of his cheekbones. He’s stunning, and Harry burns.
Harry’s lips brush Draco’s fingertips as he bites into the fruit. Juice, translucent red, runs down Draco’s hand like the trickle of desire tingling in Harry’s groin.
By the time the sun sets, the building has transformed the upper floor into a cotillion in preparation for the gala. Harry slumps in his chair, his magical core exhausted from casting multiple anti-conflagration spells and magically manipulating quills all day.
Ginny shakes her head, scrolling and skimming. “Only like 50 comments about Finnegan beating off.” She snorts. “Posted by Finnegan.”
Draco stands under the shower, fingers pruning. If the daggers he stares were knuts they’d bounce right off that firm arse.

Lottie twists in his arms. The balloon breasts squish between them. “Right here!” She holds up a glass. “It’s a Buttery Nipple.” She tugs at the balloon’s knot, releasing it with a snap. “Seemed appropriate.”
“Do you often find you need to pluralize penis then, Hermione?” Draco asks.

“I didn’t do it on purpose!” Harry watches Draco
Draco crosses his arms against the wide leather belt that cinches his waistcoat. It’s an obi belt—
The bell rings, reverberating through the parking lot, announcing the beginning of the school day.
Draco walks the hall like a runway, all long legs and smooth gait. He’s fucking gorgeous in tight pinstripe pants, and Harry decides that his button-up should be illegal. The lace offers an occasional glimpse of petal pink nipples.
.” Ron sits up. “Not many could thread that needle.” He looks at Harry with that same squinty thoughtfulness, and Harry’s skin again prickles alarmingly. Ron opens his mouth to speak, but Harry is spared by the gruff monotone of Assistant Principal Snape demanding students return to class.
Ron sighs from the passenger seat. “Isn’t that just gorgeous?”
“I would also be quite interested,” Theo says, ears practically purple.
“It’s
“Arthur’s favorite hawberry wine, of course, as requested. And a goose for Michaelmas Dinner and various trimmings.” He leans in conspiratorially. “I shot the game myself.”

Harry swallows around his heart thrumming in his throat. He catches Draco’s wrist and sucks down his thumb, closing his lips around the knuckle. His tongue, coated with tart strawberry and sweet icing, presses against the muscle mounded at the base.
Harry groans at the ceiling and resumes pacing, pausing only when he hears the door click shut. Draco leans against the jamb and appraises the room. His gaze lingers on a pair of red pants patterned with golden snitches draped over the chair, then his eyes flick to another pair—blue with green dragons—pooled by the chest of drawers.
Ron snorts. “All that money and he drives a piece of shit.”
James digs a hand into the box, elbow-deep. Nuggets overflow onto the table and floor. “There should be a prize—”

, from his polished loafers, up the crisp seam of his trousers, to the jacket.
“Stop talking,” Ron mutters.
“No, I…” Harry lets his head rattle around against the headrest, shaking memories loose in his brain. “I must have forgotten it in the library at our last study session.”
Harry was doing him a favour, really.
“Tell me this, Potter,” Draco drawls. “How many more parties are we to suffer celebrating Theo and Hermione’s pending union, for fuck’s sake?” He hands Harry a shot glass full of amber liquid. Elegant fingers trail over Harry’s knuckles in the handoff, red-painted nails shining.
The drunk shuffles away. Harry wrinkles his nose and the stones beneath the man’s feet lift to trip him.
Ron inhales sharply. “How dare!” He lunges for the cake and his balloons knock into the champagne bottles, causing them to tumble. There’s a scuffle and more damage to the cake. Paper butterflies and cranes scatter in a flurry. A bottle topples over with a clang.
On the Christmas tree, one of the mushroom decorations transforms into a flower with a small pop.
“It’s a strong, assertive word.” Ron punches his fist forward. “Cock.”
“Only one of your statements is true,
Molly huffs and casts a stern eye to her sniggering children. “I’m sending you lot out into the countryside. The fresh air will do you good.”
The liquor bottleneck skyline shifts, revealing Draco’s smirk from his languorous lounge across Harry’s couch. “My rim doesn’t bite, witches, but it
Harry sniggers at juice dripping from Draco’s dark scowl.
Pansy’s hyena laughter draws Potter’s attention. He grabs a shot glass from a passing waiter’s tray, tosses it back in one swallow, and disengages from his conversation with Ron. He takes two steps in Draco’s direction, only to be waylaid by Ginerva Weasley. She places her hand to Harry’s jaw and leans in to whisper in Harry’s ear. Harry laughs, cheeks pinking.
Per usual, Potter struts around the Auror Trainees’ locker room as if he owns the place.
“I haven’t seen the sun glinting off a dew-drenched field since summer two-a-days.”
“Ugh.” Ron flails his legs off the sofa. “
Harry’s magic flares, a white-hot strobe, and he climaxes, spilling over his fingers.
“So. Eighth Year, Mr Malfoy.” Harry reaches out and snags Draco’s pinky with his own. “Your arms must be tired. You know, from carrying that torch for me all these years.”
Malfoy moves as if to offer, and Harry yanks his hand from his pocket, littering the stones with papers. He digs the cigarette out of the pack and puts it in his mouth. The taste is sharp and biting.
“I want—” Harry groans, chasing Draco’s mouth. “
Ginny tosses her magazine onto the coffee table. “Have fun?” She shifts her satisfied smirk from Harry and Draco to Ron’s flailings.
And… he is
“Bollocks,” Draco spits.
Pansy snorts. “You would.”
” Harry amends hastily. “But I can’t be around you.” He looks away from the pain slicing through Draco’s features, dropping his gaze to the silver flames now pouring off the desk and licking at the curtain hem. “My magic…” His blood roars like a fire alarm in his ears.
—he can’t look away. His heart slams into his ribs, and his cheeks warm at the memory of wanking to an embarrassingly quick finish to thoughts of that necklace.
“First course.” Harry hikes Draco’s shirttail and caresses firm cheeks, marveling at their perfect plumpness before parting them. He whispers a cleaning spell, his gentle breath eliciting a wave of goosebumps to cascade beneath the fine blond hair lightly dusting the flushed skin of Draco’s low back.
Harry stares, unsure where to land his gaze.
“Actually,” Hermione says. “Harry’s attracted to the

“Why didn’t you tell me?” Draco says.
Ron yells, his voice a high screech between gasps. “You’ve… the cheek… to ask
But must Potter always select the shower stall within Draco’s direct line of sight?
“I was thinking about you.” Harry says, far too eagerly, but he’s too happy to care. “And in bed. And in the shower—”
Draco nuzzles his nose against the stubble shadowing Harry’s jaw. “Spring lace,” he says. He bites his lip and unbuttons his shirt, revealing lace, lace, and more lace, in an agonising striptease.
Ginny slaps him on the back, mouth cinching into a pout. “Damn, woman. You got a crystal ball in that tote, too?”
“I’m sorry,” Draco says, frowning. “I shouldn’t have—”
Harry nibbles, wetting the fabric until a pink nub pushes against the translucent lace while Draco squirms. “I like to think that you wore this for me,” Harry says. He feels Draco’s chuckle against his lips.
Draco rolls his eyes. “I bring seasonal offerings ever since…”
He feels, that much is obvious. There is

He slips Potter’s shirt off over his head… he brushes his hands, then his lips down Potter’s chest.

“I am.” I pause. “It would be just… us.”
Harry’s fingers find the third scar, deceptively thin, deceptively straight… Harry sees it for what it is. “I could have killed you.”
Harry is clad only in boxers and a shirt that is so ragged and so threadbare that it can scarcely be called a shirt. “Am I?”
“I’ll make sure you get your fee, of course.”
He doesn’t know who snapped his picture and what they might have heard, but he can no longer pretend to be out of the country. His relationship with Draco is public knowledge. He might not even have the luxury of announcing his own damn pregnancy.
Draco takes a sip before asking, his voice hoarse and harsh, “What time is it?”
Draco leans into Harry… trying to decide if he feels better or worse than he did the day before… trying to decide if it even matters…
It’s getting easier… to be out of Grimmauld Place, to be among people. But it isn’t easy yet, and Draco has to wonder if it ever will be again.

His tongue brushes his lower lip. Then, “Harry… This evening was… really nice.”
“I… happy, I think?”
Draco takes a deep breath. “Yes, I am.” He tilts Harry’s chin up and meets his eyes. “I am going to go to work. I am going to because I
He blushes. “Thank you,” he says, looking down.
“Did he die, then… in the War?”
The white queen huffs at him, but he ignores her. He is looking down at the chess board… but not really seeing it.
“Harry…”
“Are you… happy?”
you!”
Draco ignores him, gently unwrapping the handkerchief.
It’s the flash of blond that catches his attention.
The railing to the second floor is smooth under his hand.
Harry hasn’t let go of Draco’s hand and rubs his thumb gently over the knuckles.
“What if your parents weren’t there? What if you’d been raised in a Muggle orphanage? Or with relatives who resented you?”
Harry took a few steps forward until he was close enough to place his hand on Malfoy’s shoulder. He didn’t touch him, though. “Those are over a month old,” he said unable to keep the horror out of his voice. “They should be healed by now.”
Draco can play chess with Weasley, or check an Arithmancy proof with Granger, or even just sit, reading, on one end of the couch while Potter flips through a Quidditch magazine on the other.
He refuses to consider the

He nods, concentrating on breathing.

The light in the white, windowless room was bright, but it was a suffocating, unnatural bright… white and raw, not golden like sunlight or candlelight. Draco blinks and he is back in the room… waiting.

Harry blinks. “I… I’m a

Draco shakes his head, putting on his drawing room drawl. “Really, Potter, I am tragically out of shape…”
Our words jumble together, our phrases tripping over one another, getting tangled.
“Draco… I…” It’s a whisper. That fades to nothing.

Draco was still feeling dizzy, and achingly hungry, and was fairly certain that the fact that his hand had at some point become clasped in Potter’s was the only thing keeping him upright. But…
“Yes, Uncle Draco,” Rose says and scampers off.

him about not having any parents. And suddenly it feels desperately wrong—Harry never had a mother to sing him to sleep, or cuddle him close when he fell off his broomstick, or send him sweets. Or care if he’s being forced to scratch his hand open every night.
Luna materializes out of nowhere. “Seamus,” she says, her voice floating, “I don’t think Draco wants to be touched right now.” She gently removes Finnegan’s hand from his shoulder.
His hands are full, so he allowed to follow her down the basement stairs under his own power.

“I brought soup, too. Do you want some?”
“I don’t know the moment when I started loving you, Harry Potter, but I know for absolute certain that I’m never going to stop.”
He can feel Harry, hard against his own hardness, and rubs gently against him. He feels, rather than hears, Harry’s breath hitch. Harry doesn’t move, trying to gauge the proper response to

Draco lets out a little sob.
He lay there in the darkness, every scream, every sob wrong from him, with his head in Harry’s lap. One of Harry’s hands gently carded Draco’s hair. Draco couldn’t bear to move.
“I know. But… just stay. Please.”
But Potter was pulling back a little, a red smear on his fingers. “Malfoy, you’re… you’re bleeding.”
He is strong, but the hands are stronger. With horrifying suddenness, he finds himself face down, the hard stone of the floor digging into is cheekbone.
“It’s not that,” Draco says. “Or, it’s not

Arithmancy book. When he looks up, Harry Potter is standing beside him.
“You said you were hungry.” Potter frowns, looking slightly guilty.
He did what he was told. If he didn’t, something painful happened to him; if he did, something painful happened to him anyway.
Harry’s cock is hard and already weeping and fits into Draco’s hand like it was made for him. He runs his thumb around the head and Harry groans.
“Draco, my boy! Come in for a bit. Keep an old man company.”
Then the three of us sit on the bed and Victoire spreads out the drawings. They are surprisingly good, and each comes with a long and convoluted story.
“No. I don’t want to get even.”
Draco feels his eyes fall, briefly, on the bed. His desire to crawl into it is just as strong as it was a few moments before… but now for completely different reasons. He feels Harry’s eyes follow his.
Harry Potter is crying. Great tears roll down his cheeks. “I… thank you,” he chokes out.
“Oh, Draco, I am so…
“Absolutely.”
“And she’ll go over them with you if you like… whenever you feel up to it.”
Draco looked at the large, round, open-faced… pie… casserole… thing… on the table. It appeared to have some sort of red sauce spread over it and was covered in melted cheese and what looked like mushrooms and bits of meat.
It’s is mostly empty. A few people are gathered around on of the tables, obviously studying. They look up, smiling when they see him, before returning to their work. Ron Weasley is seated, alone, at the chess board.
He was going to throw up.
His hipbones stick out, almost grotesquely, and are marred by fingertip bruises.
For one brief second, his hand is cupping my cheek. “Everything’s perfect, Harry.”
Draco’s fingers abandon Harry’s nipple and trace lower, unbuttoning Harry’s jeans, slipping his hand inside.
“Yes. This means something.” It might mean everything.
“I’m not asking for your permission! It’s inside of me, not you! And I don’t want it there!” Harry’s words trip over themselves.
We ended up talking about everything unimportant.
“God, you look gorgeous,” Harry says.
him… but Harry can tell she’s mostly talking to Draco… because the words she’s using are long, sound very specific and technical, and don’t make any sense to him at all.
He will always want Harry. It’s the only thing he’s sure of.
“Do they… still hurt?”
Harry nods slowly and holds out his hand where
To his surprise, Weasley is enchanted with the library.
“I just didn’t want it,” Harry says, his voice sounding like torn paper. “People died.

He doesn’t move. Neither does Potter.

to say. He whispers a spell to dry the ink, and carefully folds the parchment.
“Am I hurting you?”
Draco catches the thumb and bites gently.
My shoes are still making that odd clicking noise.
Above him, a soft, feminine voice uttered a breathy, “
“We’ll come visit, and you and Draco will come visit us. And it’s not as if we’re moving out tomorrow, Harry. There’s quite a bit of work to do on the place before we can live there.”

For a moment, Draco says nothing. “I… Harry, are you sure?”
“You make a fair point,” Draco said, turning to lean on the sink. Potter actually made an

Suddenly, his eyes snapped up, meeting Harry’s in the mirror. “How do you know… when…?”
Potter’s front hall is warm, full of polished wood and invitingly dim lighting.
The spring rains come and the snow melts.
“Of course I do.” Harry’s smile is shy. “But… if we can’t, ever, this will

friend than his father’s; he was a Seventh Year, Head Boy, top marks, excellent family connections, the undisputed king of Slytherin house the year Draco first came to Hogwarts. He had already achieved every goal Draco had set for himself.
“Thanks, O’Brien.”
“Oh, I’m thinking about it, Malfoy. Do you actually work for a living” —he nods at the girl down the street, freezing in her fishnets and high heels— “or do you just sit there and beg?”
Draco turns the handkerchief over in his hands. He doesn’t think that the tears are for something he has
“No. He has the chicken pox, remember?”
Draco is far less filthy… but he may be the dirtiest he has ever been. He’s been handing Harry tools all afternoon—and even adding his own muscles to unsticking the stopping mechanism.
“Erm… thank you, Kreacher. Oh,” Draco said, remembering. “Severus said to give this to you.” He pulled an ugly golden locket out of his pocket.
This new Malfoy seems to always be on the verge of exhaustion, running off some sort of inner strength made up of a quiet tenacity, sedate optimism, and an awful lot of coffee.
When the snow comes and the wind turns bitter, Charlie builds up the fire and spreads out furs and blankets before it.
, he needs to derail this train of thought.
“Oi!” Pansy yells. Her shrill voice sets the strands of Harry’s hair not clutched in Ron’s sticky fingers on end. Harry and Ron freeze.
“Yes, off with you now.” Molly shoos at them with her dish towel.
“Right.” Harry exhales forcefully. “Blackberries.”
Smoke curls from the tip of Malfoy’s cigarette, an ephemeral rope cast asunder by the wind, as murky as the puddles peppering the cobblestones between them. Slick film coats the water’s grey surface, shiny with misshapen rainbows.
” Ginny rolls her eyes. She flips another page, and Ron flips her two fingers.
A bit of tension drains from Harry’s limbs, and he relaxes his grip on his jeans. Keeping his head down, he swipes his thumb over the keyboard.
Harry takes the pan off the flame. “Five minutes to cook in peace,” he says, eye twitching. “Five
He’d left on assignment an hour later.
Harry blinks at his phone, and blinks again, eyes scanning the messages once, twice, heart racing as if he’s outrun a defensive line.
“Gorgeous.” Harry clears the tremor from his throat. “You look gorgeous.”
“Holy shit,” he says to his red-faced reflection in the mirror. “That just happened.”
“You give him too much latitude,” Percy complains. He swishes his wand to pepper the blank canvas with swirling snowflakes.
Without batting an eye, Draco sweeps off his cape, fanning the flames. He yanks the dragon cufflink from his French cuff and tosses it aside. “I thought”—he savagely rolls up his shirt sleeve revealing his arm completely covered wrist to elbow in brilliant floral tattoos—“we were past this.”
“No.” Harry sighs again. “After that.”
In Harry's some-odd years on this earthly rock, spinning around a dying star, he’s learned a few things about himself.
Scorpius starts, jostling loose a cereal crumb caught in the blond cowlick tuft at his crown. He grabs Harry’s tea sat next to the hob and pours it over the appliance. Sparks spew from the slots, and with a loud pop, the toaster dies.

bestowed with magic so powerful it oozes from his flawless skin and disrupts Draco’s heartbeat.
“Nott,” Draco snarks.
“That he’s wanted,” Harry says. His magic vibrates, stretching wide, exposing hopes and dreams to tumble forth, unfiltered. “That he has a chance. That he’s worthy of—”
Scorpius stands at the counter, sleep rumpled, and he looks so much like Draco, Harry’s heart melts. His un-seeing thousand-mile stare widens his amber eyes as he waits on his toast—
“You know, you play with your hair when you’re lying.” She turns another page. “You’re seeing someone.”
An aged voice yells from beyond the foliage. “Bloody Weasleys! Stealing my berries! I’ve caught you red-handed this time!”
Draco hums, half listening and half watching Harry laugh and carry on with Ron. Harry runs his hand up into his hair and sneaks a peek at Draco over that beautifully bunched bicep.
Draco’s eyes darken, and Harry decides that he
Harry shifts closer. “I don’t mind, though.”
Ginny rolls her eyes. “This is why I’m gay. Well, that and… " She outlines the sinuous curves of an invisible female with a roll of her hands. “
“Turgid?” Ron says, frowning. “It’s a balloon with a fucking hard-on.”
He’s running his thumbnail along the groove of a marijuana leaf carved into the wood when Draco arrives. He sits beside Harry and arranges his books and pens into alignment on the table. “You’re early.”
“Can I wish for the earth to open up and swallow me whole?” Harry pouts further.
Harry’s magic thickens his blood like molten lava. Every remaining mushroom and bauble on the tree morphs into flowers and buds, petals opening and closing in a cycle of perpetual bloom.
Draco’s eyes dart up and Harry glances away. “Anyway, you can’t just walk around rock hard all day—”
Heat quivers through him, pushing blood to his groin. By the time they stop in front of Draco’s classroom, Harry’s light-headed, his dick is fully hard…
“Harry,” Draco says sharply.
“The frosting is still lumpy,” Draco complains, “and I can see Weasel’s oaf fingerprints but...it’s tolerable.” His gaze shifts to the top of Harry’s head, the gold flecks in his eyes sparkling. “Is that a turgid penis on your head, Potter, or are you just happy to see me?”
Draco holds out Harry’s jacket. The blush high on his cheekbones matches the reddening splotches dotting his neck. “Your jacket… ?”
Ginny, unhelpfully, winks back. She snaps another picture.
Draco’s magic slices through the fire now climbing the walls and skating across the floor. The

A tsunami of hot shame drowns him, and he chokes back a mortified sob. From the direction of the front desk, Mrs Pince’s shush confirms that he is not—repeat,
Lottie gives Harry a royal wave. Above the balloon bollocks nestled against her forehead, her hat’s penis quivers toward the heavens. Ron kisses her dimpled cheek, grinning like a loon, the lucky bastard. They’re entirely too cute, and Harry is entirely too single to have to witness this loving display.
, Mr Potter.”
Malfoy guides Harry’s face to whisper against his lips, “Fuck me yourself.”
Theodore Nott takes off his firefighter’s helmet and ruffles his hair. He’s fit in that rugged, sexy, man-in-uniform kind of way. And, thanks to the Fire Brigade’s calendar Pansy has tacked to her wall, Harry knows that beneath the heavy gear, Theo requires quite a large bunch of mistletoe for adequate coverage.
Draco leans closer, close enough that Harry can see the golden embers in the pewter of his eyes, close enough that Harry can taste the cool sweetness of Draco’s breath.
With a hitched breath, Draco swipes his sticky thumb along Harry’s bottom lip, catching gooey crumbs.
Harry Potter loves his birthday.
One by one, the showers turn off and the locker room empties until only he and Potter remain.
“It is my birthday. And I should eat my cake as instructed.” Harry turns his head and mouths at Draco’s growing erection through his trousers, dampening it with his lips and tongue.
“Cocci is actually the plural of coccus,” Theo states. “It’s a term used in microbiology referring to any spherically shaped bacterium.”
“I bloody wasn’t.
Even Draco’s hum is posh as he leans around Harry to inspect the cake. He smells so fucking good, Harry’s magic wobbles, as twitchy as the few crumpled butterflies still lurching over the cake.
The students clutch notebooks to their chests and, averting their eyes, hurry toward the school buildings.
Smoke now puffs out of the toaster.
“Hey, you’re wearing your jacket,” Ron says. “Did you exchange it for

“And whipped cream.”

Harry finds Draco leaning against the shelves, casually leafing through a technical book about how to polish rocks and minerals.
Peeking out from Draco’s open collar, Harry spies a love bite as berry pink as the juice dotting his skin. “You didn’t heal it.”
“Gossip feed.” Pansy holds up her phone, and Harry leans in with the others to read.
Draco stands tall. Papers, books and pens litter the ground around him. He blows his fringe out of his eyes with an exasperated huff. “No, thank you. I am fine.”
Draco tuts. “If you tell me your wish, it won’t come true.”
Nor that bit of grinding.
“Bold, though.” Draco uncaps a pen and doodles on the corner of his notepaper, five swipes of his Papermate.
It’s a kiss that curls Harry’s toes and kicks him in the back of the knees.
Harry glances over his shoulder. “You got a problem, Malfoy?” Soap bubbles shunt down through the valley between plump cheeks.
“It is when you think about your crush.”
“He’s so pretty,” Harry whines.
The first thing Harry registers is the blue and white ginger jar full of asters before Draco is on him, kissing him. Warm lips move against Harry’s urgently, desperately, and he opens into the kiss, blissfully,
and says, “Yes.”
turgid.” She nudges Draco’s side and shakes her hips. The balloon penis she wears sways side to side. “Now. How about cake?”
. After Voldemort’s defeat, Harry was simply thankful to be celebrating his birthday at all.
Draco hooks the handle onto his finger and smirks.
“What happened to Fitz?” Luna asks, as if reading Harry’s mind. “I liked him,” she says. So
“You know,” Molly says, smiling wistfully, a devious glint in her eye. “Arthur and I had our first kiss blackberrying at Michaelmas.”
Percy straightens his bowtie. “I can help you with that. Follow me.”
“Fine,” Harry says. “Your nose is too perfect, your knees have cute dimples, that one incisor is a tad crooked, and yes, there’s a spot on your forehead.” He takes a deep breath and exhales his heart back into his chest. “You’re a gorgeous quirky prat, and when you wear my clothes I want to snog you into next Tuesday. Can we go eat now?”
Pansy dives her fingers into Ron’s hair. “Neanderthals, the lot of you.”
Harry grins so big his face hurts. “Well, happy birthday to me.”
“They have family in from America,” Hermione adds.
Draco appraises Harry with a sweeping glance. “Are you leaving?” He parts his overcoat to slide his hands into his trouser pockets, and he’s wearing
” Her hungry eyes track Luna skipping across the parking lot. “And speaking of… Later, losers.”
” Photographs of men and women dining, shopping, and banking wearing all manner of leather and lace replace Percy’s snowflakes on the storyboard.
“There’s a blond prat who always shows up wearing something... ” Harry’s voice trails and he waves his hand at Draco vaguely.
Draco stares. A blush blooms high on his cheekbones and bleeds upwards, overtaking the teeny red spot on his forehead.
Harry says around the spoon.
Draco considers indulging the urge to run over, dive his fingers into Harry’s ridiculous hair and lick that smirk right off his stupidly handsome face. His pulse quickens at the thought.

Draco ribs him about his blandness every time he delivers a scoop atop his dessert, and so Harry reminds him of how
“You can remember that…” Draco’s eyes narrow. “But can't recall Newton's Second Law?”
Draco snorts. Under the table, his knee bounces.
Ron barrels ahead to disappear through the bushes, his acid-orange hat contrasting with leaves just turning warm golds.
A shiver cascades through Draco that Harry feels coiling through his own body. A gentle tug at silky strands pulls Draco’s head back. He offers his neck, a surrender given without hesitation. The necklace glints in the dim light.
“I have the information,” Draco announces.
As he works, Harry studies Draco’s features, beautifully flushed and achingly gorgeous. His heart trips over a beat.
He knocks his forehead on the table, fuck, fuck,
quells the magic licking warmth at the base of Harry’s spine. The mantra is an old trick, a calming chant Hermione suggested he employ in the chaotic months following the final battle when he found himself in need of thwarting bone-crushing anxiety and whirlpooling panic.
Harry’s heart inflates, filling his chest, and he realizes… he’s gone for this boy—completely and undeniably, truly and rightly buggered.
Draco shakes his head
“If he were dating,” Ron adds. “I’d be the first to know. And I know nothing. Ergo, Harry is not dating.”
. Harry secretly loves that Scorpius shares his penchant for the simple things, a vanilla kinship.
A muffled yell recalls him to the Burrow’s den. Ron has flung himself onto the sofa, face buried into Aunt Muriel’s afghan.
He focuses on plucking fruit, shoving his hands deeper into the brambles, letting the thorns prick him back to his senses. Even in his limited experience, he recognizes the fragility of this thing between them, like autumn fruit, heavy with promise, yet easily bruised.
“Come with us,” Harry says. It’s not a question.
“About Lottie’s perfectly plump bum?” Luna offers. Ron leers, and his hand migrates down Lottie’s curves to regions south.
“So Devon is stuck waiting?” Satisfaction warms Harry’s bones. He doesn’t feel bad about it, not really.
And he kisses Harry’s smile.
“To be fair,” Ron says. “Harry likes fanny as well as penis.” He shimmies his balloon breasts around. “Though it’s true that at the mo, penii are the front runner.”
Sparks jump and sizzle, as if there’s a tiny dragon hidden within.
“I don’t”—Draco’s scowl deepens—“no,
Harry recognizes the blond head approaching and his stomach swoops. Draco Malfoy—Hogwarts High salutatorian, debate god, and the recent star of Harry’s fantasies—trots along the sidewalk, springing off his toes.
Ginny exits the kitchen, cackling and Levitating drinks to follow her. Ron passes by her and gives her a high-five. The two large balloons attached to his chest, drawn with enormous areolas around nipple knots, bob up and down as he trots into the kitchen.
“It smells like a smoky flower shop,” Percy says, re-entering the room. He points to the corner where the tree once stood. “What happened to the Christmas tree?”
“Oh, thanks.” Harry grabs the jacket and bolts, shielding his crotch with the garment. “I’ll see you sixth period, yeah?”
No, in addition to all the privileges graced upon him, Potter’s Golden DNA seems to have twisted within its double helix the formula for a perfect bubble butt.
“Okay,” Harry exhales shakily. “I’m going to stop saying cock now and get me some
His second mistake is unbuttoning his jeans.
Harry sniffs his pits and shrugs, standing to follow Ron into the front foyer. Ginny snags his pant leg with pinching, white-polished toes. “Tell me,” she says, eyebrows wagging. “Could it be a pointy blond prat?”
Harry frowns. He’d been warned by his superiors, cautious tales of undercover Aurors gone rogue, good men and women who got too involved, who couldn’t separate the job from reality.
“Oh ho ho!” Ron rah rahs the poms, punctuating his words like a cheer. “Bodies in motion. Generating heat. Setting off alarms—”
Draco glances at Harry, the flush bleeding down his neck. Harry gives him a little wave. “Hi-lo,” he says, voice cracking. He blanches and scrubs the back of his head. “I mean, hi. And hello. You know, hi-lo. Like, er, blended—”
“Oh god.” Harry buries his face in the crook of his elbow, realization percolating through him.
And his tell doesn’t tempt him because it’s not a lie. It’s… well, it’s nothing, really.
Draco knows the moment Harry enters Theo’s flat.
Ron squacks.
In a flash Draco is on his feet, fingers tightly clutching his wand. He contains the blazing tree in a protective bubble. The fire fizzles out, filling the sphere with smoke plumes. With a flick of his wrist, Draco vanishes the burnt tree, smoke and all.
Draco takes Ginny’s champagne, tips the glass to his lips, and drains it. His blush spreads up his jaw to settle in a small rosy patch near his ear.
Draco's mouth gapes. “Those are just quirks!” he cries. “Endearing quirks! I’m talking about something important!
The jar shatters, and Harry blinks his vision clear. “Huh?”
Draco’s teeth flash pearly white, and he sets the plate on the chest of drawers. “Cake is brilliant. Or so I’ve heard.”

“I know a little something about polishing rocks,” Harry quips. Draco’s lips curl, and Harry’s going to kiss them later. “I could tutor you.”
“Erm.” Harry chews the inside of his cheek. This is entirely too much talk about cocks and penises especially with the one and only penis to whom he’s attracted. No, wait. He’s attracted to Draco and not his cock. Though he wants that, too.
Hermione closes her book with an exaggerated sigh. “For heaven’s sake, Harry, would you just go get him already!”
“Sorry,” he says. He moves to repair the jar, casting non-verbally, magic tickling his palm. The jar repairs itself and hovers into place on the lace-covered table.
should have.” He slides his fingers into the short hair at the back of Draco’s head, cinching it tight.
“You’d like that wouldn’t you,” Draco sneers.
. His heart pulses a throb straight to his dick.
Albus tugs James’ forearm away from his mouth. “With marshmallows?”
“You forget your Care of Magical Creatures, Potter.”
He groans, Draco’s name rolling sweetly on his tongue, and comes so hard, his ejaculate paints the wall.

to hand out the worksheets.”
“And Weasley can untwist his knickers,” he says. “My feature is perfect.” He pours two fingers of whiskey over an ice sphere materialising in a glass. In the bar’s oblique lighting, he looks like a Greek god distributing manna from heaven.
Harry snaps his fingers, magic lancing, and Ron’s breast balloons pop.
His upended chair hadn’t even hit the floor before he Apparated.
Draco collapses onto his knees. He surveys the room. “We made quite a mess.” He takes the pants and cleans Harry’s face.
“Yea, but the precision.
Harry pounces. He crowds Draco against the wall. “Oh, you

with Ron’s encouraging and evil older brothers.
Lily wiggles excitedly, blue eyes big and shining. Draco sets the egg timer ticking.
Lottie taps her chin. “So, then the plural would be…cocci?”
“What are you so happy about?” Draco preens as if he doesn’t already know. He collects a mound of icing off the back of the overturned plate.
, he mouths.
Face still buried in his arm, Harry slips his phone from his jacket pocket. A text message pings.
“Good boy,” Draco purrs. Warmth coils through Harry’s veins like the smoke still rising from the candle, pushing heat through his fingertips. The balloon pops.
“Oh, honey.” Lottie pats Harry’s arm. “You’re precious, but I figured that out on my own.”
“What’s up with you?” Ron narrows his eyes. “You’re all splotchy.”
Harry closes his eyes for a beat and dies a little inside. “Hi,” he says, forcing a grin.
“Just kiss already so we can go eat.” Greg presses his palms together in supplication. “
The door opening is no surprise.
Harry’s heart skitters in his chest, and he stumbles out of Molly’s way as she collects Draco into a fierce embrace.

Harry releases Draco’s thumb with a pop and crowds him against the bureau. “Just to clarify, since all the blood has left my brain—” He hooks his fingers in Draco’s belt loops and pulls their hips flush. “You’re offering me cake, and by cake you mean—”
Harry chuckles.
To do all the schmoopy things boyfriends do
Harry guides Draco to face forward, and he sits back on his heels, taking a moment to unfasten his jeans. Draco, mouth as slick as the tip of his cock, watches Harry take his own erection in hand. Another whispered spell, this one emanating from Draco’s wand, slicks Harry’s palm.
mother reads our magazine,” Harry says to Draco. He picks up the spoon and carves a valley into the ice cream. It tastes like Draco’s magic—cool and sweet.
“Well, I don’t think—” Ron grunts and hisses. He rubs the back of his arm and frowns at Ginny standing in the doorway.
minutes!”
Harry’s laugh snuffs out the candle. The cranes expire in a puff of purple sparks.
They come together, a mutual tug of fingers curled in Harry’s denim, and a firm hand to the back of Draco’s neck. Harry leans in to Draco’s body, a solid weight novel yet achingly familiar. His magic buzzes, fat and honey-drunk like the flies hovering around the fruit.
“And the room could use a good airing.” Ginny wrinkles her nose. “Smells of… stinky boy.”
Percy spits his tea. “That’s hot.” He clears his throat, a pink blush high on his cheekbones. “
He finds Pansy perched on the high ledge surrounding the statue of Hedwig, Hogwarts High’s owl mascot. Ron has draped himself against Pansy’s legs and is tossing around her cheerleading poms.
“Yes, well,” Draco huffs, “there’s more than one way to collect berries.”
Pansy kicks Draco with the pointy toe of her Louboutin. “Pay attention to my plight, for fuck's sake,” she whines. “My eye candy has buggered off.”
Ron drags his hand down his face. Lottie toasts Harry while Ginny snaps a photo using Harry's new Muggle cell phone. Thankfully, Hermione’s too busy snogging Theo to witness Harry’s stupidity.
, Harry is coming apart at the seams, he’s coming…
Draco plates the eggs and pours Harry another cup of tea. Harry goes to fetch the milk, only to realize the bottle is empty when he slams it into the inside top of the fridge.
“You poor dears!” Molly exclaims. She glares at her son.

“Bloody
Harry shakes his head. “I’m not risking my eyebrows again. They’ve only just grown back.”

The kids dash from the kitchen in a frenzied mass of skinny limbs, but not before Scorpius gives Harry and Draco quick hugs. From the head of the pack stomping up the stairs Lily exclaims, “I get to wear James’ new jumper!”
“Ten minutes, Harry. Ten fucking minutes and we wouldn’t be parked in Outer Darkness with the”—Ron squints at a gaggle of tiny students passing in front of the truck’s hood—“sophomores.”
Molly lifts her brows expectantly.
“Pansy’s insider scoop on the spring-summer menswear runway is far more exciting than that play’s opening act, I assure you. Adjustments to my feature had to be made.”
Draco glares at Ron. Ron feigns innocence and points a finger at Harry.
He tugs off kid leather gloves with tight little jerks and tosses them onto Harry’s desk. Harry’s half surprised they didn’t rise up to slap his face.
“I’m lactose intolerant!” Percy sputters, red-faced. “And not the ice cream. This!” He twitches his hand at the half-naked models on the board. “The Minister for Magic reads our magazine. My
Harry's shoulders relax. “You wish.”
“Don’t you have that meeting—?”
Theo’s lips twitch. “I’m surprised to see you here.” His eyes dart to Harry. “And in the lap of luxury.”
“I thought I’d bring you a slice,” Draco says, “since you went on and on about”—his lips twitch—“
Fiftieth Anniversary Celebration tonight is mandatory.
The acrid smell of burning toast assails Harry, and he sighs at the bubbling eggs. “Scorp, the toast.”
Ron leans an elbow on the counter. The balloon breasts loll to the side. “The one about Nimbus’ new racing broom? Fuck, I hope you’re gifted one for your birthday.”
“Countdown starts
He’s hardly processed that he’s dry humping Draco Malfoy in the hallway of Theo’s flat, in direct sight of anyone looking for the loo, when Draco moans his name. And Harry comes, releasing like an unruly curl stretched to its limit and freed, recoiling, reforming.
Draco lifts his gaze to stare over the top of the book.
“I’m bisexual.”
“The boys are headed out blackberrying—”
“You’re a mess,” Draco says softly.
“Weasel,” Draco sniffs. He levitates to Molly a trunk-shaped basket large enough to store a body and tied shut with leather buckles.
There used to be small fanfare when he showed up, a funny little charm Draco incanted, but the inevitable hexing—from Ron, Greg, and Harry, just that one time—had put that to a quick end.
Draco clears his throat. Harry takes a mental picture of the perfect pink of his cheeks. For later, when he can savor it at his leisure.
A breathy moan escapes Draco’s throat.
Ginny sighs. “You poor, poor daft man.”
“And the Junior League Garden Club.” Draco leans back and props up his feet.
A flash and a boom announces the storm’s arrival seconds before the sky opens up.
. Behind Draco, down the hall, a guy exits a bathroom. Relief loosens Harry's tight chest.
“Myself,” Ginny says.
“There’s another meeting next month,” Malfoy says. “Bigger fish.”
” Draco sneers.
The Quaffle whizzes past Harry’s head. It knocks over the blue and white ginger jar full of purple asters, upon which Harry had been fixated, his mind preoccupied with a delicious and rather confusing new
“I think you need another drink,” Hermione says, tucking her wand away.
“Yes,” Harry says. “Cock would be brilliant,
“Well, now… ” Draco lifts Harry’s head with a firm hand to his jaw. An earnest, hopeful expression suffuses Draco’s face and nearly brings Harry to his knees.
“Harry likes balloons,” Luna says. “And penises, too.” She conjures two flowers; one she tucks behind her ear and the other she tucks in Harry’s hat, probably between the balloon balls.
“The area is secure, Commander,” a female voice barks. “Ten-fourteen, false alarm.”
“Before that,” Harry says. He rolls his eyes at Ron. “And that was less a conversation and more a monologue, mate.”
The car engine is running as they walk up, doors and windows locked up tight. Draco is smacking the hood with the hanger, cheeks flushed with the effort. He’s having a little fit and it’s cute as fuck. Harry grins.
The moment Draco speaks the Summoning Charm, the berries explode like tiny grenades, pelting Draco with pips and berry flesh.
and peruses the images with a lofty ginger eyebrow. “You’re awfully distracted.”
“Personally,” Ron says. “I like the term cock.”
” he whines. “
“Fire Imp’s leave no trace,” Luna states.
Ron watches his sister pursue Luna, a pensive pinch to his face. Pansy scratches his scalp. “I can feel the wheels cranking in there.”
“Something’s sprung for sure,” Harry growls. He grabs Draco’s hips and drags him into his lap, thumbs digging into sharp hipbones to grind him onto his half-hard erection. Draco’s groan stokes Harry’s magic, spreading warmth through his groin, plumping his cock further.
Magic swirls around them, a cacophony of blues and golds, Levitating the items littering the top of the chest and the dirty clothes strewn about the room.
Molly’s eyes light up. “You little devil!”
” He nuzzles his nose beneath Lottie’s balloon crown to whisper into her ear. “Harry wants the

“This morning, I wanted to thank you again for helping me with my car.”
with tongue.
“Only part of my birthday wish came true.”
Harry laughs and tugs Draco back into his lap. He buries his face in his neck, mind reeling with the tart leathery scent of him. “What say we ditch this Gala tonight? We can go to mine, have some wine.” He drags his lips over pink flushed skin. “Start a fire.”
“An improvement,” James smirks. Lily smacks his arm, sending dry cereal spilling over the table. “Dad, Lily made a mess!”
He’s collecting paper towels to dry his hands and clean up the evidence of his climax when he hears it—a
Draco’s soft footsteps retreat.
“You’ve a bit on your face,” he says, breathless as he cups Draco’s jaw. The juice bead smears beneath his thumb as he trails it along Draco’s jawline and down under his chin. Draco’s smile fades and he swallows, his Adam’s apple rolling under Harry’s thumbpad.
“He’s not going to leave,” Harry says, using the tone he perfected post-War, the tone that brought immediate results, the tone that insured that Draco was able to stand beside him now and was not rotting away in a cell in Azkaban. “He’s here with me.”
“I’m writing a book about dragons,” she says. “Did you know?”
Potter turns, his mouth breaking into a smile. “Ginny plays for the Harpies now… so, yeah, I’ve got a lot of their stuff.” The smile twists into a smirk. “And I didn’t figure you’d want anything that said ‘Gryffindor’ on it.”
If everything goes perfectly, they might make it.
And my hands are shaking.
He’s never noticed before, they are so pale, but Draco’s eyelashes are long enough brush his cheeks, and he has a little freckle, high on one cheekbone.
I signed Elladora’s contract to the day Harry pulled me out of there, there were exactly
Draco sighs. “Not a lot,” he says. “It’s obviously not a Muggle thing.”
“What about your aunt and uncle, then? Surely they…”
“Not bad, Malfoy,” he says, dropping a few notes on the ground, “I might even come back for another go.”
“Sounds like they didn’t much care for you.”

Malfoy shrugs. “If you say so.”

A number of Draco’s most secret fourth-year fantasies are quietly entangling themselves around his current nightmare.

Molly Weasley wanted him to move into the Burrow. Ginny Weasley wanted them both to move into Grimmauld Place, and she started picking out curtains and wallpaper and hinting about wedding dresses and nursery furniture. Percy Weasley had a mile-long list of projects he wanted Harry to consult on.
“I’m sure. Please, Draco. Show me your scars.”
In the daylight, his eyes are lighter, with flecks of blue and even lavender in them. I want to say something. To apologize… explain.

“They’ll publish it in the papers, though, won’t they?”

Draco feels the corners of his mouth turn up.
“Thanks.” Ron reached out and was unnerved at Malfoy’s flinch. He gave the bonds an experimental tug. “They aren’t too tight, are they?”
“Okay?” He forces the word out.
This is how he wound up in Lance’s arms… his flat… his bed… in the first place. Harry knows, too, with a sick twist of his heart, that he won’t stop Lance from fucking him again now… even though he’s sore, even though he doesn’t really

He tries to smile when he sets it down in front of her.
“Ok, Twitchy, stand down.” Ron’s eyes are still narrowed when Ginny comes over.
“Fire Marshall just left,” she says, smirking. “You’ll never guess what caused the alarm.”
Pansy’s voice travels over his shoulder as he retreats. “You’d better quench that thirst in the hallway or I’ll never speak to you again.”
Draco’s voice follows him, but all Harry hears is the blood roaring in his ears. He stumbles into the bathroom and quickly scans the stalls. The room is empty. He presses his palm against his erection, drops his backpack, and is about to throw down the jacket when he catches a whiff of something clean and spicy. He buries his nose in the wool and inhales deeply.
Harry’s heart rockets up into his throat.
From his perch on the kitchen counter, Harry grins at the motley crew of Hogwarts Alums congregated in his flat, assembled by Draco’s pure charisma and manipulative charm. If someone had told Harry five years ago that these individuals would be gathered here by choice, laughing and joking and not yelling and hexing, he’d have put them in a body bind and deposited them in the Janus Thickey Ward at St. Mungo's.
Draco darts forward and silences Harry with a kiss sugar-sweet, full of velvet heat… and a promise of

“Oh?” Draco squirms in Harry’s lap and fuck if Harry’s cock isn’t stirring against the curve of warm bare skin. “What else could you possibly want? Seems to me you have everything you need, birthday boy.” He smears icing onto the tip of Harry’s nose.
“So you admit I have a spot,” Draco says. He crosses his arms over his chest. “Because I expect my boyfriend to tell me if there’s something amiss.”

“But why are you here?” Percy asks, voice bordering on panicked. “Was there a fire?”
“The devil hasn’t put his foot in those brambles yet! We’ve a few days before Michaelmas, and I want to make some jam.”
Draco’s mind hitches on the endearment. He watches Luna skip across the room and into Ginny’s waiting arms. The growl in Draco’s chest loosens, settling near his baseline rumble—a purr strangely buoyant, a lightness akin to relief.
“Is it working?”
, Draco mouths.
Theo coughs and adjusts his crotch, cheeks pinking. “Fine, yeah. Just fine.”
“Lewd news travels fast,” Ginny says, impressed.
“Do you come here often?” he asks. “To the Burrow! Do you come to the Burrow often?”
“Our kids are squabbling again, sweetheart,” Theo sighs.
“I only have one left,” Malfoy says softly. Blood pools in the inner white of his eye. It’s shaped like a heart, and Harry wants to drown in it.
“Archibald and I had a late lunch.”
Draco smirks and douses the fire with a murmured

“Penises, Ronald,” Draco says. “Hermione says so. She’s the expert.”
A bowl of vanilla soft serve sprinkled with Jelly Babies—Harry’s favourite—sets down on the table in front of Harry. Harry lifts a brow. Draco winks an ember to life in Harry’s chest. Another flower replaces a mushroom decoration.
Harry laughs and grabs him, hauling him to straddle his lap. Their kiss is slow and sweet and almost chaste. Harry’s smile breaks the seal of their lips.
“Says the witch whose panties burst into flame at the mere mention of greenhouses.”
Back when the dawn wasn’t the only thing rising.
A slow measured count of
“Ah.” Draco takes his pen from Harry and places it exactly parallel with the others. “Wankgate 2021. Our legacy.” He chews on his lip. “Twitter is still blowing up.
Draco jogs in front of the truck. He’s bathed in a soft glow, the royal blue of his letterman jacket contrasting beautifully against his alabaster skin. His ridiculous bouncy gait makes his hair flop and Harry’s heart along with it.
Hermione settles back into Theo’s lap and offers him a petit four from a crystal plate. She chases it with a chaste peck on his lips.
“It’s not! Er, I mean…” More petals flutter to the ground, petals the exact purple of oxford cotton that Harry knows wrinkles softly under his clutching fingers.
Not only does his casual lean against the wall provide a direct line of sight of the doorway, but his magic roils, a hot blue tempest, cresting and rippling in response to Draco’s magical signature. The wall, thankfully, supports him. He’s a little breathless and a lot enchanted by Draco’s attire—by Draco himself, truth be told.

Too bad Harry’s a cock-happy troll.
Harry had survived October’s black-polished fingertips peeking out from the long sleeves of oversized jumpers, and withstood November’s clinging sleek turtlenecks and tweed trousers in monochrome palettes. Not a single flame flickered.
Across the room, Harry is all smiles and happy-to-see-yous. He looks delectable in a black cashmere jumper, and Draco forgives him the well-worn jeans, but only because the faded fabric broadcasts that Harry packs his crotch to the left.
He shoves a large bite of ice cream into his mouth, twisting the spoon upside-down and letting the cold steel bowl stick to his tongue.
” Draco gasps.
Draco frowns. “Manners, heathen.”
With a glance up into hooded eyes blown wide, Harry circles Draco’s cock with his thumb and forefinger and takes Draco into his mouth. His tongue maps the weeping slit, the ridge of Draco’s cockhead, the bulging vein running along the underside. Damp hair at the base presses against his palm.
Hermione giggles and buries her blush in her hands, setting Theo’s face ablaze. Harry smiles. It’s lovely to see her so relaxed and happy.
” Harry slides his fist over himself, cupping the tip, eyelids fluttering.
“Percy doesn’t,” Luna says, pirouetting in Percy’s arms. “It makes him flatulent.”
had Harry scorching her potted Leaping Toadstools.
Harry swallows the saliva pooling under his tongue. “I’ve no sense of self-preservation,” he announces, chuckling at Draco’s lifted brow. “Hermione says.”

“It is impressive,” Pansy concedes. “Disgusting, but impressive.”
“He’s your roommate!” Pansy huffs into her crossed arms. “And the tables are already set with supper!”
Harry guides his truck into the parking space and slams the gear into park. Morning light angles through the windshield, a bright veil beyond which he can barely make out the yard lines striping the practice football field.
Harry trips up the stairs and catches himself before he slams into Draco.
“You like that,” Harry says, humming with satisfaction. He chuckles when Draco’s fingers tug his hair.

One of them holds up their phone.
Ginny and Luna chat together as Harry looks on, amused and indulgent, hands stuffed into his pockets. The girls wave him off, and he disappears through an open doorway leading to the back bedrooms, his magic a siren call urging Draco to follow.
At the sound of his name in Draco’s supercilious voice, Harry thrusts erratically into his fist, chasing the throb pulsing through him. He clutches Draco’s hip. His thumb finds the divot behind Draco’s hipbone and presses, urging Draco to slide deeper into his throat.

Hermione would be rightfully appalled.
“I think you like that even more.” Draco traces Harry’s lips stretched wide around his girth with a soft fingertip. “
Ron wrinkles his nose as if he’s smelled something dodgy. “Ferret.”
Draco glides his pen over the paper.
“And speaking of morning wo-
Draco scowls and slouches further, smoothing a wrinkle from his sheer lace button-up. “Now I’ve certainly no idea what you mean.”
Molly smiles knowingly. “Is this…?”
Lottie tosses her black plait over her shoulder and explains in her American accent, “The grapefruit is tart, and the salt rim bites.”
Lily sticks out her tongue. “Tosser.”
Harry swallows hard.
, Draco?”
“I’m gay,” Draco blurts, cheeks flushing a baby pink.
His favourite day is today, the first day of autumn—a harbinger of all things gloriously fall: crisp walks amidst golden leaves, pumpkin hunting at the farmers market, and Molly’s blackberry crumble...
He needn’t celebrate ever again.
Harry draws back, cringing. “Oh god. I had quite a bit to drink that day. I should never have said—”
“Teddy fucked up my phone alarm yesterday. I’m sorry, ok?” Harry slouches back against the seat and pouts. “I was so rushed I didn’t even have time to make a deposit in the wank bank.”
“Really,” Draco deadpans. “You don’t say.”
Harry’s stomach drops. “I’m not!”
Cracks of Apparition fill the silence, and for a moment Harry thinks the fire has reignited. Voices shout, and Harry hugs Draco into his lap, alarm spiking through his desire. Over Draco’s shoulder, bodies in protective gear bustle about the room.
—the party had been, in a word, lame. But if there’s one thing Harry has come to appreciate over the last four years about Draco Malfoy, it’s his tenacity.
It had been Draco Malfoy, of all people, who had saved the day.
Harry stands in the eighth-years’ common room, awaiting Draco’s arrival.
The third time Harry sets the office on fire is a foregone conclusion.
Colourful embroidered flowers cover the suit jacket and trousers, budding and blooming in a continuous loop. A heavy silver chain bridges a wide leather cuff at Draco’s wrist and a matching choker at his neck. Black velvet hems his trousers and frames the jacket’s lapels. Unbuttoned, the jacket swings open…
“And I'm the dramatic one,” Harry mutters. “Won’t you be late for the opening curtain?”

A push away from the door and Draco approaches, a small pretentious smile gracing his face. His magic expands, soothing and minty cool, and the plate Levitates in front of Harry. A wand tap and a whispered
“Leather and lace for spring,” he says. “That’s… different.”
A gaggle of tiny sophomores stand at the end of the aisle, mouths agape, eyes wide, books clutched to their chests.
“An accident, surely,” Harry mutters.
Luna enters the kitchen carrying a large cake blanketed in creamy white icing. Colorful paper butterflies and white cranes flutter over strawberries nestled in peaked swirls.
” Pansy loosens her grip and Ron continues. “They’ll happen anywhere, anytime. In the shower, boner. Gassing up the car, boner. In the grocery, boner—”
Draco’s expression flattens. “Yes, Ronald, it’s what turgid
not the… naked mushrooms. Er, tell me more about this aura hair-braiding you’ve featured?”
“And pray,” Draco says softly. “What lies float around under Harry Potter’s pretty curls?” He inserts his finger into the rogue spiral, pinching the dark strands, pulling it taut.

Draco wields the book like a shield between them. “Just to be clear,” he says, piercing Harry with those stormy eyes, that sweet pink blush creeping up his neck. “When you wanked in the boys’ bathroom—”

door closed while I was putting on…” He pauses, ears pinking.
Draco’s stern expression transforms as he laughs, and Harry can’t help but to touch, to get his hands on pale skin.
Harry intentionally limited interactions with his undercover agents, but this was borderline negligence. And insubordinate and dangerous and...
Not only does his artfully contrived perch on the arm of a creamy leather chair afford him a direct line of sight to the door, but his magic flares, a white-hot beast attuned to Harry’s magical wavelength, stretching to life and licking warmth at the base of his spine.
“Fuck.” Draco inhales sharply, sucking his bottom lip between his teeth. “So good. You’re
* * *
An icy trickle of dread slides down Harry’s neck and stalls his breath in his lungs.
Harry focuses back on the parchment. He sets a Correction Quill to the handwritten paragraphs, reading as it skims along. The quill makes a few grammatical changes and writes a notation in the margin, but Draco is correct—the writing is damn near perfect. As was last month’s fashion editorial. And every editorial before that. It’s cheeky, witty, and brilliant, much like the bloke who penned it.
Loud laughter punches through Harry’s haze; a reminder that the world dares to exist outside of a willing body long desired packaged in designer wrapping. He frowns at the party barely visible through the doorway at the end of the hall. Laughter swells. Bodies shift. He registers red smiling lips and bushy hair through a shimmer of magic that seals the doorway.
Guilt blazes through Harry. He buries his chin into his jacket collar and quickly turns away.
Harry glances at Hermione and Theo seated at the kitchen table, engrossed in conversation, eyes only for each other. The tops of Theo’s ears blush a darker red the more Hermione smiles. Harry’s eyes stray back to the den. Ginny has settled onto an armchair, and Pansy stands behind her, manipulating balloons into penis and vulva shapes. Pansy tugs Ginny’s hair, and Ginny tilts her head back to receive a kiss.
Apparently, it’s not enough that Harry fucking Potter
“To answer your question,” Draco says. “I come to the Burrow every Quarter Day—”
So he does what any level-headed grown man who has a charring crush on his fashion editor would do.
His first mistake is sliding his arms into the sleeves.
Ron yelps. “Hey!” He protects his chest with his arms. “Rude.”
” he groans, a whine scratching the back of his throat.
Harry clinks his glass against hers. “Cheers.”
“Close your mouth, darling,” Pansy says. “Your Potter-lust is showing.” She Levitates a glass to Theo seated in the chair upon which Draco sits.
And, sure, they’d kissed in the pantry at Hermione and Theo’s flat last week. But Harry blamed the abundance of joy and general gushiness pervading the party in the wake of Theo’s proposal. Besides, he’d kissed Pansy, too. And Ginny. Well, pecks, really. And definitely
“So I, er, followed you into the bathroom… ”
“No, really, I’m fucking
” Embarrassment blazes through him, heating his armpits. Did he put on deodorant?
In a flash, she wields her wand, and Harry has just enough time to shield his privates before a brisk cleaning charm zaps him. He shivers. “T-Thank you, ma’am, may I have another.”
Molly smiles sweetly. “I’m sure it wasn’t you, dear.” She bangs the Quaffle onto the dining table. “It’s not the first time that ginger jar has been repaired. The jar that has”—Ron and Ginny both pantomime Molly’s words—”
His jacket slips open wider. The V-cut muscles at his hips disappear into trousers with a rise so low, Harry can see fine dark hair dusting his pubic bone.
Draco shoves everything inside his backpack. A green dragon figure hangs from the zipper.
With a final cry of
“You’re no better,” Draco says, a reprimand gently delivered. He caresses into Harry’s hands a healing magic that scratches beneath Harry’s skin and it’s
“I know,” Draco says, a smug smile bunches his cheeks beneath a blush. “You’ve said.”
“Potter,” Nott says. He nods to Percy and smiles dimples at Luna. His grin slides into a smirk. “Malfoy.”
“Fuck me yourself.”
Molly swishes her wand to open the front door and pushes them out into the bright afternoon. Harry jostles into Ron and slams into another solid body stood on the porch, accidentally trodding on a polished brogue.
Harry can’t even appreciate the sixty-nine retweets, he’s so overcome with a skin-pricking panic. “Are there comments about, er, who it was?”
Harry’s mind crackles, static clouding his vision. He must have blindly followed Draco into the main building because suddenly they’re inside. Draco’s talking about his dragon collection or something. Whatever it is, it’s hella cute because his hands are gesturing and his lips are curling in that pretentious way that makes Harry’s brain melt. Harry tries to focus, but his mind is crowded with
“Nice of you to bring the goose and such,” he says. He plucks a daisy from the vivid purple clumps dotting the lane and pulls a petal free from the flower’s golden center.
“You needn’t be so dramatic.” Draco wets his forefinger and thumb on his tongue and pinches the flame out of existence. “I’m only twenty minutes past the deadline.”
A sly grin slides onto Malfoy’s face. He crowds in closer, igniting the Muggle lighter, protecting the flame from the rain with a bubble of dry magic from his elegant broken hand. Harry cups his hand over Malfoy’s. His healing magic leaches into pale skin, knitting sinew and bone. With a deep inhale, he draws the flame onto the cigarette, smoke into his lungs, only to collapse into a coughing fit.
But Draco discovers it’s difficult to put his foot down when he’s on his knees.
Ron’s raised eyebrows fold his freckles into wrinkles on his forehead. “Uh huh.”
“No berries?” Ginny asks. “You boys are in quite a jam. Or no jam, apparently.”
He schools his face into what he hopes is a neutral expression, one that doesn’t broadcast his ridiculous crush. “Tell you what?”
Draco sticks out his tongue. Pansy returns the gesture.
“That is the question.”
“Ugh,” Lily says. She collects her long auburn hair into a wad at the back of her neck. “Now my hair will smell all burnt.”
that doesn’t come. He retreats to look Draco in the eyes. “No?”
Harry ignores Ginny’s eerily clairvoyant stare.
“I’m prepared.” Harry slips the hanger into the door. “I have an excellent tutor.” He grins at Draco’s eye roll and snags the lock’s innards. “Besides, McG likes me.”
A nudge to his shoe opens Harry’s eyes. Underneath the table and into his lap, a piece of notebook paper edged with a galaxy of inky stars slides into view. A note written in Draco’s slanting script says,
Malfoy jerks his arm away. “Don’t.”
Pansy scowls, hands on her hips. “What
before the boom of thunder rattles his bones. The storm approaches quickly; the last gap had been five. He pulls up his hood, muscling a shiver into submission at the caress of soft cotton against his shorn scalp.
“He’s saving to pay his own way abroad,” Harry says absently. “His dad is a dick.”
just happens to have a
“Jizz shorting the socket in the boys’ bathroom.” Pansy tosses the nail file into her Louis Vuitton tote triumphantly, and Harry chokes on his own spit.
The thickening underbrush snags at pant legs with prickly thorns as they pass through a natural archway, bramble vines towering overhead. The seasonal shift into autumn is palpable here; the decaying leaves trod underfoot kick up an earthy musk.
Draco holds him close, his hands a soothing pressure over the shuddering plane of Harry’s back.
Ron collapses back onto the sofa, clutching his chest. “Someone,
“Of course you can!” Harry slumps against the wall. The bricks dig into his shoulder blades. “You’re the best agent the Ministry’s seen since the First War.” He punches his hands into his hoodie pocket and finds a siege of paper cranes. He wads them in his fist. “You’re”—
spine unfolds a full bar out of the stacks. Draco steps behind the bartop and levitates the stopper on a crystal decanter.
Behind him, firefighters point Y-shaped wands at the walls and curtains, muttering incantations.
Thunder rolls, and Malfoy steps from the shadows, an agonizing emergence, each step a revelation that he’s alive—a scarred Chelsea boot, soft-worn jeans sagging below a Ramones t-shirt, his blond hair.
Draco cards his fingers through Harry’s hair and leans to brush his lips on the shell of Harry’s ear. “I canceled it.”
Draco withdraws and comes over Harry’s face.

like a goddamn monkey.”
“We can’t bloody get rid of him,” Ron interjects.
“Well, you see,” Harry says. He stares pointedly at Ron. “We were too busy running—”
what the fuck?”
-vanilla they are. It draws a blush to the back of Draco’s neck and elicits enthusiastic retching sounds from the kids.
“Alright, you’re a narcissist and a sociopath. You’re probably a psychopath, you’re paranoid”—Harry takes a deep breath—“and you make fun of the elderly.”
. The fierceness of it overwhelms him, a dull ache that coats the back of his tongue.
” He blinks frantically at Ginny. A mercy killing would be fucking brilliant right about now.
Harry can hardly keep his lips sealed around Draco for want of smiling.
Harry gasps into the deafening silence. His hands clasp Draco’s arms and squeeze his biceps. “I should have done that a long time ago.”
Draco steps into the open door and pauses. “That was second grade,” he says quietly.
Inside
Ron murmurs an
Harry ghosts his lips over the cold chain. “I like this choker.”
They watch Draco wrestle a wire hanger into a lopsided shape and jimmy it between the driver’s side window and the door.
Harry knows the moment Draco arrives in the hallway.
Harry silences the phone and stuffs it into his jacket hanging on the back of his chair. “Girls are scary.”
Ron sighs dramatically from the couch.
Draco chuckles. “Good. We can’t have you looking like a naked mole rat when we debrief Robards tomorrow, now can we?”
Draco’s eyes darken as purple-black as a pail full of berries. “Why would I?”
flies off Harry’s bookshelf. Glittering flames on Harry’s desk recede, and the book lands, falling open. Pages flutter to a halt at an illustration of a dragon’s egg nestled in a ring of fire.
