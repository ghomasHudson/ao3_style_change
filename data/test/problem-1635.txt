He didn’t really know what to do about the man. On one hand, anyone as utterly devoted to Voldemort as he was was someone to get rid of as quickly as possible, but on the other, Harry didn’t know if Barty Crouch was even that much of a threat. Sure, he was a Death Eater, and thoroughly indoctrinated into the cult of personality that Voldemort had developed, but the Voldemort that he served was thoroughly and utterly dead. How would Barty react if he came to learn that the Dark Lord he would be serving was one considerably younger and, if Tom was to be believed, thoroughly out of the loop?
She seemed to think about it for a moment, before sighing. “Hadrian, there is no reason to fear the unknown. Regardless of the future that the gods have in store for us, we must remember the things that we have for ourselves. You are powerful, Hadrian, overwhelmingly so for such a young boy. And I do not doubt Draconis’ abilities either. We may not be prepared for every possibility, but it is also very true that every possibility may not be prepared for us.”
Marvolo fell to his knees, gripping his temples with hands still full of little fingers and children’s whispers, and gave the rest of his composure away to insanity. The purpose of wariness lost its edge-its meaning-as he fell further into the grasps of his own memories. He had been created in the very manor, swept away in the thrill of the hunt as muggles screamed and he destroyed the bloodline that had forsaken him. Marvolo had been birthed in the blood of innocence, had been bathed in the sweet nectar of chaos, and this was the aftermath of his handiwork. This was what he had to show for it, the corpse of a great family that he had never been a part of, and all he wished from it was solace? A place to wait until knowledge and power fell into his lap? Foolish. Foolish. Foolish!
With that, Draco turned away, and stepped into the purple flames with a firm shout of the address given to him.
Squinting harder, Theo got his face as close as he dared to the candle and the flame as close as was safe to the books without actually burning either. Despite the clear issues with the Nott library, he had still managed to spend most of his time in it as a child, reading by candlelight and the occasional sunlight whenever the weather was nice enough for him to sit outside comfortably for hours on end. That wasn’t to say that he didn’t have a problem with it, and had spent many years of his time trying to get his grandfather into any shambling sense of responsibility over the manor. It seemed, though, that the old man was intent on leaving eventual repairs on Theo’s shoulders. Or perhaps he just wanted to subtly influence where Theo spent his time, as it was all too likely that keeping the library as it was had been a continuous effort by the man to make Theo spend his time doing something more constructive to his future.
Pansy huffed, quickly putting her shoes back on before pulling the taller girl back onto the path. “The break in the grove should be just up here, and it's hardly that complicated-just family dynamics.”
Death raised an eyebrow, his towering frame not unlike the tower of babel as it reached into the heavens. Voldemort was unafraid of the force that now existed in front of him, knowing for sure that it wished for him to be its master. It was clearly unsatisfied with Hadrian Potter and wished for him to recover the Deathly Hallows from the boy. That was the only possible explanation for it to bring him back to form and function.
He laughed lightly, sitting down as she waved her wand towards the stove top, setting it to work making a pointedly english breakfast before sitting down with him. He smiled at her softly, finding that she was likely one of the most fascinating people that he had met in quite a long time. Sure, Nicolas had amassed a wealth of knowledge that put Dumbledore to shame, but Perenelle was far more traveled than her husband, as she apparently spent quite a bit of time hunting through remote places looking for potions ingredients and various other fascinating things. They had talked for hours about her travels the night before, and he had noticed that her accent was much less distinct than her husband’s, though it seemed to be mixed with several other tongues as well, forming a vague amalgamation that he could never hope to pin down on a certain region of the world. He had realized their dynamic quite quickly after the first few hours really, understanding that she was the far more extroverted traveler that was off for months on end, while Nicolas was the introverted recluse that preferred to disappear from the world for decades at a time.  Harry could only assume that after so many years together they had managed to find a perfect sweet spot between both of their preferences and needs. It was fascinating to watch them go about life together.
Theo opened his eyes, gaze unfocused as it roamed the room, searching for something that might make him focus on anything but Luna and his concern for her. Strangely enough, his eyes settled onto the mason jar of honey, and he found himself watching how the sun hit the glass and refracted through the golden-brown sweetener. He focused on the bubbles trapped in the honey, how they seemed perpetually stuck-as if time had stopped for the mason jar alone, keeping those pockets of air trapped inside, never to be moved until someone came along and disturbed them. Theo took another breath, beginning to slowly calm himself down forcibly.
He quickly fell back into his mindscape, opening his eyes to find Tom staring at him with annoyance. For a moment, he just blinked, stuned that they now stood eye to eye. He had never expected to grow to be the same height as Tom, having seen him as something of a giant until realizing how small he looked next to Death. Harry smiled winningly, “I didn’t realize we were already the same height-”
“Oh don’t tell me you two are still fighting, Harry? Whatever the argument is about, it's completely ridiculous.”
Instead of an answer, he only got more questions. Xenophilius shook his head gently, hands palming a strange talisman wrapped around his neck.
Fleur : "Je déteste vous déranger Madame Perenelle, mais j'ai toujours eu un amour pour les potions et-"
Sucking in a breath of air—more out of habit than necessity—Harry sighed, forcing his shoulders to relax as he took a step away from the door. Taking out his frustrations on Barty Crouch would get neither of them anywhere, at least not anywhere helpful. Besides, he was angry enough about how the World Cup had ended, he didn’t need even more reason to wring the poor bastard’s neck.
Draco shuffled, and Harry stiffened as a distant, pained shreek met his ears. He reached out, gripping tightly to Draco’s shoulder to keep him in place as he made a move to let go and investigate. They needed to leave. No matter what was happening, Harry knew he valued his own life over the faceless masses of people who might be in danger just beyond the treeline.
“Ah, un maître de potions en herbe? Je dois admettre, après que Nicolas a pris Hadrian, j'ai souhaité avoir mon propre apprenti. À quel point es-tu douée?" Came the sudden reply, the two voices overlapping each other as Perenelle seemed to gain a sudden interest in something. Draco snorted, causing Harry to glance his way with a raised eyebrow. The blond wasn’t even looking at him, his gaze instead locked on the long hallway stretching out to the front door, clearly trying to peek down it and get a sense of the people speaking.
“Well… we ought to get going.” He finally said, giving Perenelle and Nicolas one last, slightly desperate, glance. “I’ll write to you both as much as I can, keeping you updated on everything.”
Theo made a face, contemplating the past week as he moved through the darkness. His first few days back at the manor had been filled with a great deal of sleeping and eating, which was all that he felt he could manage after such an utterly wretched last week. After that, he had fallen back into old habits and had gone three days without sleep as he holed up in the darkened library, trying to find a solution that he knew didn’t exist. There was very little that was known about creature inheritances, and even less about the creature that Theo suspected Harry was, so even with the expansful Nott library to guide him, there was very little that he could even find. Sure, he had taken many trips to Diagon Alley in order to see if there was anything there that could clue him in on anything important, but either the Canadians weren’t as concerned about the demons in their forests as Theo felt they should be, or none of the knowledge was escaping the tribes living there.
Draco peered at him from over his book, eyes narrowed into slits. They sat there for a terse moment, caught in some sort of absurd standoff, before the blond boy sent a short, barely perceivable glance towards Daphne, before he was immediately back to glaring at Blaise.
“Did it work? You said his pulse hadn’t returned!” Nicolas looked to his wife, who shook her head with shock.
Tom didn’t answer at first. He didn’t know how to. He just stared, viciously, at those icy blue eyes and the small, sad smile that accompanied them.
His lord was aware of him, Barty was certain of that, but Harry Potter seemed to be in control. At least, that was what Barty thought. Surely then, there had to be a way to distinguish the two of them apart? Perhaps his lord was merely sleeping away, compelling the thoughts of the real Harry Potter into acting a certain way?
Draco read the entire letter three times before finally letting it fall into his lap, where he stared at it with a particularly pinched expression on his face. The signature at the end of the letter proved that the woman writing to him was a member of the Delacour family, and belonged to a branch of it that was relatively close to the main branch, considering that she was the current lord’s first cousin. However, that was seemingly the only one of his questions that was actually answered with the letter.
Blaise hummed a second time, seeming to mull it over for a moment before pressing another kiss to her hand-this time the back of it, right over her middle knuckle. “How about those tiny sandwiches? The ones that are smaller than your little sister’s palm. And some lemonade with it.” He nodded to himself, muttering about how that was a good idea, before settling down and seemingly going back to sleep. Daphne swallowed thickly, tightening her grip on his hand as she watched his serene face.
Tom left it there, frothing at the mouth and sobbing hysterically, in the middle of its own twisted, insane little soul.
He wondered what was going to come of the next year, beyond the same old delirious madness he had grown used to.
“Harry-Harry Potter, is it? Wonderful, absolutely wonderful to meet you. This is the-yes, this is Harry Potter… the boy-who-lived? You know of him, I’m sure.”
“No lock…? How peculiar.” He pushed open the door, slipping inside quickly before shutting it behind him. The interior seemed to be a vague skeleton of the grandiose splendor that had once graced the halls, and as Marvolo traversed through the barren walls and eerily silent corridors, he took in the peeling wallpaper and waterlogged plaster, slipping past downed portrait frames and a single, broken chandelier. He remembered walking the very same route decades prior, and was reminded of the feelings of ecstasy he had experienced as he chased the Riddle family through their home. He had been the one to sever the chandelier’s chain, hoping to catch one of the fearful muggles underneath it. The effort had been in vain, but he had cornered the pathetic insects all the same.
Theo realized then, that if there was nothing that he could do to change the future, then why should he even try? Even if he saw it being ripped asunder by the people that he loved, nothing he did would ever change the outcome in any real capacity.
That overarching feeling of confusion seemed to follow him through the rest of the day like a thick cloud of smog, not dissipating in the slightest once Perenelle and Fleur returned and created a buffer between Gabrielle and Draco, who seemed to have it out for each other in the worst way possible. Perhaps worst of all, Nicolas, who he would have usually turned to as a last resort when the environment around him became too illogical, seemed to be caught up in his own head as well, sitting slouched in his chair with a brooding air about him. If Harry didn’t know any better, he would have thought the immortal man was pouting, but it seemed more realistic to assume that he was just thinking very hard about something, as he had been doing for the past week ever since he had taken a trip to Beauxbatons the week prior.
The one downside, it seemed, of subtly pushing Harry to close the door, was that he had no way of opening it back up again if it was locked from the opposite direction.
Tom looked at the hole, his head tilted to one side and eyes narrowed in both worry and confusion. It was particularly unlikely that the horcrux had been destroyed, especially considering where it was currently locked away. It didn’t help that him and Harry were currently in France, and had been there for several hours. It seemed, to him at least, that the death of his most troublesome horcrux was not only, sadly, quite unlikely, but probably impossible considering that there still seemed to technically still be a connection of some sort.
“And that isn’t the least bit suspicious to you? You’re aren’t concerned that Luna, a person who could manage to over-explain every conceivable subject, just refuses to discuss something?” Theo snapped back, sparing the older man a quick glance to see what he was looking at, following his line of sight to the honey jar. Deciding the man was momentarily blind once more, he turned away and sped up his pacing.
Tracey seemed to smile a little at that, taking a moment to observe a wild berry bush a little ways off the beaten path before quickly turning around to give her an odd look. “Don’t call me ill informed for this, but what does him being the heir have to do with anything?”
He took another small sip of his tea, shifting the blankets tighter around himself as Pernelle’s tapping increased in speed. He bit the inside of his cheek, wondering how long he could draw this out, before she stopped altogether and threw both hands up into the air.
Dropping his hands, Harry picked up the letter again and reread it. Maybe he should just write back to her, asking if she was alright. It seemed like the simplest way to go. Sighing, he reached towards the stack of parchment on the edge of his desk, brushed off some of the fly-away glitter that had landed on it, and reached for his quill. If Luna was scared about something, then he had every right to question her about it, he had every right to know.
He creaked open the door slowly, peeking his head in to find her sprawled out across the floor, a piece of parchment and at least four jars of half-empty glitter surrounding her. The parchment was, while already nearly drenched in ink from the large loopy lettering of Luna’s handwriting, further weighed down by a substantial amount of glitter. The girl glanced up at him, her face sparkling with different colors of glitter and likely just a smattering of glue.
The fourth floor was equally empty, the vaulted ceiling and elaborate carvings inlade in the oak supports making the space feel far larger than usual, what without all the students and professors milling about during the day. Nicolas passed it all by with a feeling of misplacement, as if he did not belong in that empty space. Perhaps his feelings of unease were being elevated by the uninhabited academy.
Locket dissolved into cackles again, thrashing in its bonds as it slammed its forehead into the stone floor repeatedly, the rest of its body still reclined in the fallen chair. Tom took a sharp breath of air, closing his eyes and trying to block out the torturous noises as the evil, twisted creature continued to croak out its demented, hollow pleas.
“I do hope it doesn’t. We planned all this for today because of the low winds, so it would be upsetting if the weather decided to change on us.” Nicolas replied idly, also disregarding his overshirt into the fire. “But I doubt that it will. Today is one of the more still days of the year, and there is no reason for that to change.”
“What was in the bloody letter, Harry.” Draco replied in a barely-discernible whisper, his pacing stopping short as he turned back to look at Harry. He looked so breakable at that moment, so utterly terrified of the known unknown. “You had gotten it this morning, yeah? So your crisis this morning had been about it,
Theo shook the thought from his head, ignoring the returning ache in his chest as he reached forward and firmly grasped the pristine handle of the door. Still, nothing particularly brazen occurred, so while wincing slightly at the thought of anything dire happening, he slowly turned the knob and pulled the door out towards him.
He nodded, his core flickering, and seeming unsure. “I heard you screaming. I just… wanted to make sure you were okay.”
He stared at the page blankly for a moment, not quite able to entirely focus on the words printed there, before sighing tiredly. Reaching out with one hand, he snatched up Harry’s considerably larger one and intertwined their fingers, squeezing slightly to the confused noise Harry made in response. He only had to wait a moment to get a squeeze back, feeling his mind and soul relax slightly as Harry noticeably relaxed, his head lolling back against the couch cushions as his entire body seemed to finally settle down. Draco settled back himself, finally being able to focus on the book in his hand as the crisis averted itself.
would he explain how his heart stopped in the first place, and after that how would he explain why he had singled out Ginny Wealsey over all of the other students at Hogwarts? How could he possibly explain away every little thing they asked him without digging a hole so deep he wouldn’t be able to get out of it?
“And I also have every right to refuse one,” came the immediate reply. Harry sighed, shaking his head at the statement. It always came back to this, didn’t it. “Just like you have every right to refuse an explanation to your friends’ questions. Harry, we both have the right not to say a word.”
Harry pieced together what had happened instantly, and with a low groan let his head thunk against the wall of ice.
Perhaps the former then. Barty wanted to dance with glee, terribly excited to see what his father had in store for him. Perhaps he would put a quidditch poster in the room Barty was kept in? Even knowing that something new was nearby would keep him entertained for at
but you disobey me to my face? I would have thought you befriending the Malfoy heir would fix that rotten mouth of yours, but perhaps any positive influences he had were overshadowed by that girl’s efforts to ruin you. I never should have agreed to this-this
“It’s very dear to me, though not particularly useful.” She remarked quietly, reaching out for it as he offered it to her. She took the red gem between her fingertips and pulled slightly, a gentle smile on her face as he let go and, watching with a separated sort of fascination, spun it between her fingers.
Harry sighed silently, letting his head fall into his hands as Draco’s posture straightened, his shoulders falling back into a familiar poised, impossibly straight stature that had always made Harry roll his eyes. Now though, it just felt like an admission of defeat.
Harry nodded slowly, resting his elbows on his knees as he gazed at the west wall, which had certainly seen better days after the rather aggressive attack. “But how had any of this happened in the first place? And why exactly do you think the ring has gained a body because of it?”
hear that from across the room? Draco swallowed wetly, the heat of his body rising to the point that his breaths were coming out in visible puffs, hotter than the surrounding air. He could feel the familiar sensation of flames flickering across his arms.
The man shook his head, flipping the page of the booklet so Tom could get a glimpse of the contents. “I agree with your plan from a logistics standpoint, but giving such a gift as that is something that I am wary to agree to, especially considering what Hadrian is now like.” Icy blue eyes watched him closely. “You understand, Tom, that we are quite the selfish person. I am hesitant to give up my separation from the whole if it means that in a few years time we will die and my magic… well, you understand my wariness in that regard. However, that wariness could be ignored if I was positive that my death would fuel a good cause, but I am not optimistic about Hadrian’s cause, whatever it may be.”
Tom was quiet, introspective, and as infinity stretched on between them, the realization slowly started to dawn on him.
Closing his eyes, Harry leaned back in his seat, a headache starting to form behind his eyes as the noises rose to incredible levels. He certainly didn’t remember it being
She grit her teeth through the discomfort, rubbing at her eyes furiously for a sparse second longer before whipping her head up, eyes wide as saucers as she searched out that familiar, horrific sight of Harry’s soul. She found it easily, the mass of writhing colors and brilliant shapes. It washed over her, gentle and foreboding and impossible. Comforting and vast and knowing.
“I suppose you don’t want to see him till September?” She stated, finally standing from the ground with her unsealed letter in hand. He watched as she got out a candle and wax melt, and began to warm up some wax to use as a seal.
Tom didn’t reply at first, either too busy formulating a response or contemplating if it was even worth it. Harry certainly thought it was, as he fought his own mental war, waging a final, climactic battle between using Barty Crouch’s appearance to his advantage and the overwhelming urge to tuck the issue away in the Flamel basement where it could rot for the next few years.
Theo took a deep breath, gathering himself before he took half a step back. The door didn’t move, didn’t breathe, or reveal itself to be some sort of shape-shifting beast before attacking him with a mouth full of sharp teeth. No, it just sat there… like a door.
“Luna? Are you sure you’re alright?” Theo’s voice shocked her, somehow, and she visibly jolted again, before relaxing her shoulders and continuing to take deep breaths.
How many times had he used the imperius on innocents during the war? How many times had he used it without question, without even considering what kinds of potential it had as a torture device? If he were able, Barty would laugh bitterly, and continue to consider all the things he would force his father to do once he had escaped from this agonizing existence. Maybe he would force the bastard to skin himself alive. Slowly though, and jerkily. A somewhat fast, if agonizing, death would be far too sweet for the wicked man. Perhaps Barty would just lock his father up in a dark room, leaving him there without food or water or light. No, he would bring the fool food and water, but wouldn’t let him relieve himself. Yes, that was an excellent idea. Barty would make his father feel exactly what he felt right now, but without end and without relief. Would his body try to force its way despite the curse? Or would his muscles cramp to painful amounts, his body being forced to refuse its own needs?
A glass beaker filled with a dark and opaque substance fizzed, the glass cracking as the liquid inside swirled. Nicolas picked it up with a pair of tongs before pouring it out into the container. The molten metal cracked and creaked upon contact.
The air felt cool and moist in that early morning way that couldn’t be replicated after the sun had fully risen into the sky. Harry breathed in deeply, his spindly fingers rubbing against the smooth porcelain of his teacup as he stared out into the countryside. It was just barely dawn, and the sun had risen just enough for the sky to be a muted blue and the birds had started to wake and fill the air with noise. Perenelle hummed from his left as she shifted, pulling her legs up onto the wicker chair she was curled up in. He didn’t know where the question had come from, but he was suddenly very glad that he had asked it. After all, he had died once, and might be existing in an altered state of death now, so it would be fascinating to see what an immortal would have to say about the experience.
He groaned, and fell back into his seat with a thud, watching as the Bulgarian team slowly made their way into the top box. Draco seemed to be calming down somewhat, but his eyes still held that gleeful tint to them as Krum rounded the bend, sporting two black eyes and a lower face drenched in blood, his nose slightly offset in two distinct places.
The winding nature of everything and Duncan’s insistence on making it as knot-like as possible had turned each room into something out of a fever dream, as you could walk into every single room there was and never find a perfectly sharp corner. Each room seemed to curve slightly or bend, and one of the most common structures ended up being a vaguely tube-like shape for many of the bedrooms. Growing up had seen him get lost in identical and dimly lit hallways, where he would sit there and do nothing until his grandfather or the occasional servant found him. It was what had eventually made him love reading so much in the first place, as the second he learned how to read he would be able to carry around a stack with him and begin to read whenever he got lost or was just generally bored. And considering that some of the doors in the house just disappeared or refused to be opened on occasion, it was a good thing that he had found a way to pass the time before he got better at traversing the twisting manor.
Harry felt slight irritation surge through him as the old man continued to deflect the questions. “Well? What is the issue then?”
He stopped, fist half-raised and eyes blown wide and wild with anger. He gulped tightly, his grip on the letter loosening as his father’s voice echoed through his skull, gentle and utterly authoritative.
“Are you worried that history will repeat itself?” She questioned softly, observing as he sparingly watered a cactus of an indeterminate species. Harry huffed a laugh, moving on to a pot of spider lilies as his nerves began to calm more and more.
She waved her hand around flippiantly, a habit he could acknowledge was her own personal way of waving off concerns. “Mortal men and their denseness, you’ve fallen victim to it too you know. It seems that no one under three hundred ever understands that, so I suppose I can't fault you for it. Don’t worry Hadrian, I’m sure with age you’ll gain wisdom.”
Her eyes flew open, and Luna lurched upwards, throwing her hands over her freezing cheeks as she threw her head wildly around the room, searching for the woman desperately. Scrubbing at the frost covering her cheeks, Luna pulled her knees up to her chest, grabbing haphazardly at her duvet before finally managing to grasp it to pull it up to her face. She held it for a moment, still breathing heavily, before she began to aggressively rub at the painful cold covering her face. Her breath came out in short puffs, somehow hotter than the open air around her despite her entire body besides her face feeling hot and sweaty. She bit down on a sob, dropping the duvet to instead bury her face in her knees, curling up into a ball in some irrational hope of comforting herself.
down the stairs, taking three at a time as he swiftly dodged around a poorly placed armor set. Slipping down the main hallway, he was quick to pick up his pace, gathering speed as he heard the scrape of a chair and voices slowly filtering out into the hall from the kitchen, its door oddly ajar.
“I’m sorry, Dray.” He started, setting the glass of water onto the table as Draco glanced back up at him. “You’re right. It’s just… well, see here’s the thing, I got a letter from… shite, no.”
He scrambled up to his feet again, glancing furiously around the winding tunnel. “I’m not hallucinating this, Riddle. Why are you
Tom slowly sat back in his seat, rubbing a hand down his face in thought. “This is why you have refused me for so long. You don’t want to give yourself away for his benefit.”
Harry looked fascinated, if anything, and reached out to touch it before she gently maneuvered her wrist away, entangling his long, awkward fingers with the necklace’s chain instead. “But enough of that, we’re set to leave in five… four… three…”
The woman smiled, her purple eyes glimmering with mirth and pity and horrible, horrible knowledge. She knew what would happen, she knew and somehow he didn’t. For the first time, Theo had no idea what was in store for him in the future.
The nameless man seemed amused at that response, his eyebrow tilting upwards with a slight turn of his lip, as if he found Tom’s understanding to be infantile or crude. It was very likely that he did, and despite that realization, Tom couldn’t help but feel that his intelligence being insulted was a cause for great annoyance. He quirked a brow in return, his fiery red eyes narrowing in distaste.
Theo stood rooted in place, watching the man across from him warily as the memory of the summer prior forced its way from where he had pushed it down and away. He hadn’t considered the prophecy at all after that day, trying to keep the memory out of his mind as he went about the issues with his left eye. It hadn’t been purposefully of course, but more out of a subconscious sense of self-preservation.
“It’s quite alright dear. But I would like to speak with you extensively in the morning, if you wouldn’t mind?” The woman—Perenelle, he thought she had been called—replied, patting his still-numb arm gently as she led him forward.
His mouth snapped shut, and Harry shook his head before following after her, unsure of if what he was feeling was exasperation or fondness.
She hummed, before biting into the unidentifiable pastry she had chosen from the platter. “I was never very interested in Quidditch, though I did dabble in the earlier renditions of it in my youth.”
“That wasn’t there before.” He muttered, shifting his balance to the other foot as he studied the door with narrowed eyes. He was positive that it hadn’t been there before. Beyond a shadow of a doubt, it had appeared while he hadn’t been looking.
worried about was Hogwarts’ wards picking up on the man entering the school, since neither of them were certain of if the trunk was capable of masking magical signatures, but he didn’t really think that it would be much of an issue regardless. Crouch had managed to parade around in the body of Moody for an entire year without Dumbledore doing much about it, so
He laughed lightly, absentmindedly patting Gabrielle’s head as he did. “No, my godfather actually lives lives up by the coast, but I’m staying with the Flamels for the summer-”
“I… who are you?” He questioned instead, finding difficulty in keeping his attention on one thing at a time. The shop around them was utterly jam-packed with everything he could think of, from chairs to knives to strange, glowing orbs to what looked like a dog collar with spikes going around the inside of it. It was all just far too much all at once.
With the urge to scream only growing more impossible to ignore, and the agonizing seconds dragging on, he couldn’t help but try to reach out for
It didn’t really matter. In the end, Marvolo was never going to be Harry's largest threat. His attention was, for that moment, turned elsewhere.
“The second name is that of Justin Finch-Fletchley, who suffered from a fatal fall off the Hogwarts express while returning from spending time with his parents over the holidays. Please take the time to wish his family and friends well.”
Marvolo waited for a moment, cautious to move forward unless he was certain that the Aurors had not been alerted to his minor display of magic. He had no idea how much the trace had developed since his time, but if the scope of it had grown at all from how it had been when he was living at the orphanage, then there was a slim possibility that, if there was a magical child in the town below, the trace might have caught his little trick. When no one came, and the only sound he could hear was the wind and falling rocks from the cliffside, he dubbed it safe and moved on.
The nameless horcrux smiled then, and Tom felt the weight of his many years suddenly come bearing down on his back.
now, so you better get me out of these chains and start explaining!” Whined the locket from its position on the floor, its malnourished legs flailing around in the air as Tom raised an eyebrow, unimpressed.
Harry lagged back a little as Draco let go of his arm, the other boy pulling a small bag of floo powder from his satchel. Harry looked around the old house, so full of memories and happiness, trying to take it all in and sear it into his memory as the ticking of his pocket watch echoed from his pocket. Maybe he could carve out a piece of his mindscape and make a replica of the estate, if only so he could feel more secure and at home whilst so far away. Because, really, that was what the Flamel estate was to him now. It was his home, just like how the people living within it were his family, in every sense that mattered to him.
Splintering out from behind those inky black tresses of hair were sharp spikes of a pale scar, zig-zagging along a predestined line of fate as it danced along the man’s skin and tore through his eyebrows, separating the black hair there and carving indentations into his flesh, ripping away at his skin as if it were the sky gods ripping the heavens apart with their fury.
“Theodore, please understand when I say this, but could it be possible that you are being willfully ignorant presently?”
“Your heart is beating really fast.” Harry muttered, and Draco realized he could feel it against his skin. The ring, pressed up against his cheek, was beating along with his heart, fast and loud and
Harry clenched his fingers into a fist, the feelings of inescapable destiny creeping up his back like a vine. If he had time to lay out some sort of story, a few hours to get his bearings, then maybe he would be able to pull something off, but there were mere seconds left for him now, and with that realization came the beginning stages of panic.
The elderly man wearing the insulting drab jumped slightly in surprise, before turning around to face him. “Nicolas? My, what a wonderful surprise this is! What are you doing here, my friend?”
have a physical connection to the portkey, tends to have one considerably dangerous side effect. That being, the foolish individual in question runs the risk of being considerably less protected by the portkey’s magic than the other individual, and may find themselves bearing quite a bit of wind resistance as they are flung through space. The general consensus seems to be that these individuals usually survive, though not without considerable damage to their joints.
“Hadrian, do you remember what we were speaking of just last week? About soul mates and immortality?” Perenelle’s voice was soothing, and so incredibly loud in the silent room that he nearly jumped in surprise at the sound of it. Her’s were the hands holding his own, steady and firm despite how he knew she must be pained by the temperature of his skin. Gathering himself, Harry nodded, swallowing down the tears as they threatened to erupt.
He took a seat across from her, and grabbed the wine bottle away from her outstretched hand and poured himself a glass. “He is out there still, milling around. Now, I have no doubt that his patience outlasts yours Olympe, so please tell me what the issue is so we can solve it diplomatically.”

He took a slow breath, trusting in the strange woman as she started to relocate his fingers’ digits one by one, nimbly resetting them with the skill of someone very used to doing so. He idly wondered if she was a healer as he watched her work in the low light, still pointedly keeping his head down as he heard more than saw his lord slowly stand, the man’s eyes turning from him to glance towards the third person, the boy, who’s own gaze still bore into the side of Barty’s head. His lord said something quiet—so quiet that it was indistinguishable to his sharp ears—to the boy, and immediately Barty felt the inspecting eyes leave him.
She watched a flicker of his soul-the smallest of movements. He had shaken his head, she was certain. “I can’t-just… I can’t without some sort of assurance that he is who he says he is. You understand that, don’t you Luna?”
The locket was obviously vying for Marvolo’s affections, and it seemed to have, sadly, gotten just enough information from the exchange between his idiotic son and his soulmate to know that Lucius Malfoy had sent a very…
They stared at each other for a moment, before Harry turned away. He still had reservations about this whole plan, but he and Tom had both agreed that the man was rather agreeable and would work well for this purpose, considering past memories that proved he was quite good at it, so not much but more good things were sure to come of it.
“Ten…” Perenelle started, eliciting a lamenting groan from Draco as he extinguished his lumos, tucking his wand away into his pocket as Harry watched Perenelle merely dim her’s to near darkness, still needing to see the pocket watch as she counted down. They were enveloped in near-darkness, and Harry’s eyes quickly adjusted to it, the faces of his companions revealing themselves out from the shadows.
Theo was unsure what exactly he should do, standing there with a warm cloth pressed onto his cheek and a madman sitting across the room from him. In an attempt to understand
Voldemort had felt the inklings of strength twisting around him before actually trying to grab hold of it, assuming that it was nothing but his pathetic excuse of a future self trying to tempt him with false hope. He shifted, groaning as his soul’s mental and physical injuries screamed in agony. The bastard that called himself ‘Tom Riddle’ had come back to him time and time again after their first physical altercation, finding sick pleasure in returning to cut pieces out of his mind and soul. He couldn’t remember so much of what he was sure he had remembered before. His graduation from Hogwarts being the most blantand, as well as the day he killed his father and extended family. It was all nothing but a blur after that Failure had taken it all from him.
Harry nodded, about to reply before he quickly got sidetracked, turning to watch as Draco’s nose crinkled up in distaste. He followed the blond boy’s line of sight, sighing slightly as the pudgy form of Minister Fudge came scrambling over to them, the Bulgarian minister trailing behind with a confused expression. Brilliant.
Nicolas had come out to see them off, his fingers coated with ink and a half-crazed look in his eyes as he muttered on about Merlin knew what. He didn’t look like he had slept for a week, and Draco couldn’t help but feel that he hadn’t as he Draco watched Perenelle laugh, whacking her husband in the shoulder as if he had said something outrageously funny.
Harry shook his head at Draco’s words, turning to watch as Bagman screamed into the sonorous wrapped around his neck. "And now, without further ado, allow me to introduce. . . the Bulgarian National Team Mascots!"
She nodded once, taking only a moment to observe his shocked-still soul, before swiveling around on her heel and determinately walking the opposite direction. She cared deeply for him, she really did, but if he just wanted to see things a certain way and not admit that there is deeper truth underneath, then she was hardly going to sit around and agree with him.
Clearly, there was something very wrong here, and she didn’t have a single clue on how to go about figuring it out. It was just all
“Oh but you two can’t go alone can you? You’re only fourteen after all.” Perenelle remarked, amusement and concern overlapping each other in her tone. Draco paused, not having considered very much past getting a ticket into Harry’s hands.
Nodding to himself, Harry forced his thoughts away from the stinging sensation, turning to look once again towards Barty Crouch, who was still very conveniently cowered in the corner. He forced his shoulders to relax—forced his entire body to stop shaking—as the one heartbeat in the room started to slow. He just… needed to plan. He couldn’t let emotion lead him down the wrong path again. He just needed to keep his instincts in check, no matter how hungry it made him. He just needed to keep those he loved safe.
Draco felt his cheeks warm again, the familiar thrumming of his heart picking up through the ring pressed into his cheek and making his chest ache.
“Yes… so, I’ll be off now.” He stated, wincing slightly at the terseness to his voice. This was hardly a good way to cap off his time with his parents, though neither of them seemed terribly invested in changing the atmosphere into anything but unbearably tense.
Luna hummed, peeking out from behind the waves of pale curls framing her face as she watched familiar shapes and colors trail into the great hall. She observed the gentle, snake-like motions of deep green light slithering sluggishly around happy, cloud-like puffs of blue. It seemed that Blaise Zabini was still doing rather well, with the crueler half of himself seemingly placated from whatever anger it had felt early on in the year before. Luna hummed, watching as the boy’s bubbly blue soul motioned sweetly to a deeper, more glacial purple besides him. Daphne Greengrass, she thought sparingly. Luna hadn’t spoken much to the older girl before, but had always found the royal hues of her soul quite attractive. She could almost compare the texture to satin, though she couldn’t exactly touch the girl’s soul and confirm such a thing.
“Barty Crouch…” he mumbled, observing the trunk for a tense second longer. He didn’t know if what he was having the man do was a good idea, but it would certainly make the school year work out in his favor. He hadn’t really thought up much of a plan besides ‘help Draco’ for that year, besides laying low after the Ginny Weasley drama, but Crouch had offered him a fascinating new possibility.
Harry let Draco pull him along towards a waiting Perenelle, who had a comically large map in her hand and seemed to be trying to find the nearest plot of unclaimed land for a tent. She folded it back up as they approached, and quickly shoved it into one of her pockets. Harry raised an eyebrow, wondering why she hadn’t bothered to claim a plot for their tent. He had told her that there was a large, night-long party afterward, right?
a sentient creature, it couldn’t want anything from him besides dinner, right? Seers weren’t exactly difficult to find outside of Britain after all. It was hardly going to want him for his abilities.
Stones are thrown at unsuspecting heads as windows are nearly broken by falling owls, and the hidden secrets of an old soul pile up higher and higher until Fate herself decides to bloody do something about it already.
The rock was a crude effort in hindsight, but with enough forward momentum, anything could kill a man.
Eventually, he sighed, and shook his head. “As long as no children have to die for the entertainment of adults, then I will be satisfied.”
“I do believe Draco should go to visit heir Potter in France a week early darling, the French sun would do him some good. Perhaps he should stay there for the rest of the summer, in fact.”
It was a slow walk towards the west wall, even slower when he occasionally had to let go of one bookshelf to grasp another. Upon reaching it however, all thoughts of his discomfort and unease flew from his mind.
The boy’s entire body seemed to shift slightly, his shoulders pulling back and back straightening, neck, hands, and fingers, all shifting near-imperceivably.
The noise ceased, dwindling only to be replaced by familiar shuffling and sparse muttering. Still grating. Still impossible to bear. But quieter. It was quieter. He tried to take in as deep a breath as he could, his mind starting to slowly ease as the normal noises and sparse, mild movements replaced the chaotic affair from seconds prior. This was how things were meant to be. He could manage this. This was how things always were, as they had been for a long, long time. His mind slowly settled back into familiarity, sluggishly returning to a dissociative state as the panic began to subside.
Tom replied scathingly, driving home his displeasure with a familiar, aching pain that branched out from his hairline and spiderwebbed down his face and neck. Harry shivered at the attack, brushing at the skin of his cheek as the sensation slowly fizzled out. He frowned, rubbing at his jaw contemplatively as Tom continued to mutter obscenities from deep within his conscious. Harry didn’t remember the pain ever branching out that far. The farthest it had ever gotten was the tip of his nose, where the longest branch of his scar ended. Why was it now sneaking down his neck?
Despite his occasional conversation with Perenelle about the potion, Harry spent most of the rest of his freetime in the potions laboratory watching Draco work. He didn’t personally have a need to use the lab for anything other than stretching out and relaxing after being stuffed up with Nicolas and burning metals for hours on end. Draco, however, seemed infinitely inspired by the space, going on and on about how it was a travesty that the Hogwarts potions classroom was situated in the dungeons, where there was minimal light and minimal ventilation. Harry had to agree because, well, Perenelle’s laboratory was perhaps the exact polar opposite of professor Snape’s. Windows lined every wall that shelves did not, and when there was no natural light to guide them, there were enough candles to light the whole of the house, all closed off in little bubbles of magic to minimize any incidents. Everything was clean, and bright, and there were even a few potted plants that Perenelle would take snipits off of only to immediately throw into whichever cauldron was closest to her. It was a crisp, professional, and airy place, and it suited Draco’s instincts perfectly.
Blaise sighed, slouching further in his seat as the trolley witch tried to get the door open for the third time that evening. In all honesty, he did have quite a few questions for Harry—quite a few more than one should usually have for a friend—and while at first, it had made him incredibly upset to think that Harry didn’t trust him enough to know everything about himself, Blaise had realized something over the summer that he hadn’t even considered before: Harry does trust him. Maybe not with deep, personal secrets, but Harry had trusted him enough to ask him to send a bloody
Wormtail was dead and Bellatrix was rotting in Azkaban, so the two most notable people who had either the means or ability to bring him back were out of commission. There was always Barty Crouch, who based on Harry’s memories had not died in Azkaban, but he hadn’t given the young man knowledge of where the ring was being kept, so that was also extremely unlikely. He doubted this was any sort of ploy by Dumbledore as well. The man was old and batty but he was, sadly, not suicidal. Tom also doubted that there could have been any sort of godly intervention, even if this was exactly something that Fate would cook up in that twisted little mind of her’s.
Marvolo grinned, slowly beginning to laugh as the sun set on Riddle Manor, and the sounds of night slowly converged onto him. He had cast the killing curse without so much as a blip from the ministry, so surly summoning an inkwell and quill would not be too terribly difficult, yes? What was summoned paper in the face of eternal rest? An owl would hardly be an issue either, so easy to force into compliance with the right incentives.
He sighed, the familiar action bringing him some semblance of comfort as Perenelle shook her head. “Whatever you think might work is good enough for me, Hadrian. Anything to help you settle your mind.”
“My sister wants to apprentice under Madame Perenelle, you know? It was all she talked about in the days before today.” She whispered to him, conspiratorially leaning into his shoulder as she mumbled the ‘secret’ in his ear. Harry made an ‘ah’ noise, nodding along with her words.
Glancing out the window, he watched as rays of sunlight streamed in through lace curtains and bathed the entire room in gold. It was a beautiful day, by the looks of things.

Side-along apparition, while having some risks, is still perfectly safe if the apparitor knows how to do it without the worry of splinching either themselves or their passenger. Attempting a side-along portkey however, where a poor individual does not actively hold onto the portkey, but instead, another individual who
Draco deserved to know every single thing that he hadn't been told by his father, and he deserved to know every little thing that he had been withheld by the man for his own ‘protection’. Draco deserved to know about his creature inheritance, and he deserved to know that he was being
Sighing a breath of defeat, Harry shook his head at himself before walking half a step to pick the letter up. Pinching it between two fingers, he righted himself before turning it over and over in his hands, carefully examining it for foul play or, Merlin forbid, more glitter. On the back was his full name written in a crisp, flowing font and... nothing else. No return address, no name of the sender. There was nothing but his own name, sitting there plainly on the back. Harry felt the beginning of unease settle deep into his mind as he turned the letter over to the front.
She really laughed then, loud and boisterous. The noise startled him slightly, and with a small jump he turned to face her again, finding her nearly toppling out of the dainty wicker chair she had perched in. He blinked, surprised, as she threw her head back and slapped at the reed-like arm of her seat joyfully.
“Soulmates, as you so very subtly questioned about, are a different force entirely. Magic connects them, yes, but both definitions of the soul can be used in regards to soulmates. Mind, body, consciousness, and magic all converge to connect such a pair together.” She paused, as if wondering if she should continue, before pressing on. “Nicolas and I have such a union, which is in part why we wished to gain immortality in the first place. Soulmates are terribly inconvenient for mortals, after all.”
He grunted, pulling himself up onto an appropriately sized branch before gripping onto the trunk of the tree, hoping desperately that he was no longer in danger of falling now that he was not dangling by his fingertips twenty feet up into the air.
And as there came a knock at the door, signaling that the birthday party was going to start soon, Draco paid attention as Harry glanced his way, and smiled a wretchedly fake smile.
Really, his good luck and the substantial acts of chance alone could not save him from the situation for long, and it was an immense leap in logic for him to believe that the Flamels were stupid enough to ignore that his presence in the house was not a human one. Though this…
“What did you say to her?” He questioned Draco quietly, the other boy still looking a few seconds away from strangling the girl.
He nodded, handing her the glass before sitting back down. She took a slow sip, contemplating the news. “I had no idea you were familiar with the boy. I know you and Perenelle are private people, Nicolas, but wouldn’t that knowledge becoming public do very well for your image?”
She raised an eyebrow, siping the orange juice as he took another bite of his eggs. “Well, I surprisingly do not know nearly as much about alchemy than my husband-”
He took a breath, taking the cloth off his face for a moment to flip it over to the other side. “Everything that I have been told has already come and gone in some way or another.”
Draco sighed at the thought, settling further into the plush couch cushions as Harry continued to silently seethe. He could feel an instinctive urge to help his soulmate tugging at his side of the rosary, but forced himself to ignore it. If he was going to get any sort of progress done with his creature inheritance, or his looming disownment, or even just schoolwork once school started up again, then he would have to trust that Harry was mature enough to sort himself out.
face. “That, Potter, was a bloody travesty for my peace of mind. How on Circe’s green earth did you think that was at
Luna had gotten used to the sharp, angry lightning bolt of blood that ripped down Harry’s face. She had seen it for years and had grown almost…
Harry leaned onto the large desk, crossing his arms as he watched Nicolas with narrowed eyes. “Yes, that particular question had been on my mind ever since we started this little demonstration.”
going mad. Maybe combining with his creature had been a bad idea, though it was hardly like he meant to do it. Maybe it was affecting his psyche negatively? Or maybe the combination of his argument with Theo, his birthday, Luna and Lord Malfoy’s letters, the apprenticeship with Nicolas, and everything in-between was finally getting to him.
Harry snorted, fiddling with the nearest throw pillow while Tom tiredly unbuttoned the top button of his dress shirt. “That would just about do it I reckon. So do you think he would be much of a threat if he did have a body? Just considering how many memories he has.”
He forgot about the soot, forgot about his parents, and with a mangled sob Draco threw his arms over Harry’s shoulders, practically
Theo jerked away from her suddenly, his voice bitter. “He’s shown who he is well enough. I don’t need to go out of my way to ask.” She felt a spike of annoyance for no particular reason other than he was being difficult, and sat straight up to glare where she thought might be his eyes.
“I got a letter last night, and another one this morning. Neither of them had anything particularly pleasant in them. I feel like both on top of each other are driving me mad.” He admitted, reaching forward for his lukewarm tea as she made a noise of concern.
Harry took the minister’s hand, shaking it firmly before taking the other’s and giving it the same treatment, smiling down at the pair of them kindly. “A pleasure to meet you as well, Minister. Who is this?”
These two were likely the easiest to draw, because they're both based on (ripped off of down to every little detail) OCs of mine that I already draw quite regularly, though their personalities do not tie in with said OCs in the slightest. Just as a little note on the character reference itself, but I decided to type out Death and Fate's names instead of write them, to separate them from the other characters in that they are not tied to the mortal plane and never will be. They are, as far as the universe is concerned, seperate from the rest of the world, and this is shown through a separation between my terrible handwriting and a nice, plain font.
“Ah, the heiress of the Delacour family? A pleasure, mademoiselle.” Piped up a family voice. Harry felt the overwhelming urge to wring Sirius’ neck as the man cut in front of him to address the eldest Delacour daughter, his attempt at wooing her being dashed by his rather sleazy demeanour. He caught Fleur’s eyes over Sirius’ head-not that it was very hard to do-and tried to convey apology through his expression as best as he could. She, thankfully, seemed to understand well enough, as she smiled before addressing Sirius.
He paid attention as Harry seemed to regress slowly into himself as the morning dragged on, and he paid attention as he became a mere echo of himself by the time Nicolas came down around mid-day. He paid attention as his soulmate, usually so impassible and indistinct, seemed to sag under an invisible weight, his mask of indifference momentarily
The overwhelming silence droned on. The butterfly's green and yellow wings slowly opened and closed. The tapping of his foot nearly overshadowed the ticking of his timepiece, and Harry felt himself slowly losing in his battle against madness.
Shifting so that his shoulders were pressed gently up against the trunk of the tree and one of his legs was dangling lazily off into the open air, Draco quickly found the letter with Harry’s familiar flowing cursive font and studied it for a moment, feeling for a bump in the parchment that told of something more than paper inside. Ripping it open, Draco felt his excitement rise as something glittering fell from it and onto his lap. He grabbed for the glittering thing immediately, holding it up to the light with blatant curiosity.
He wanted to thank her right then and there. Out of all the contingency plans he had made, he somehow hadn’t thought of just up and leaving before anything even happened. Why he hadn’t even considered it was beyond him, but he was glad that one of them had.
Draco took a shaky breath, setting the pen down slowly as he ran a hand through his hair. Harry watched the movement from the corner of his eye, grabbing tightly to Draco’s shirt as the pale hand reached down and started to card through Harry’s own, ever unmanageable mane.
two weeks. Or maybe even more than that! He could be getting a new carpet in a quidditch team’s colors, and would be able to see the blurry shades in the background during the daytime. Now
There was a pause in the air, as they all stood silently—save for Draco’s muttering as he fumbled with Persephone’s cage. Nicolas’ eyes got a little hard then… a little more serious than Harry was used to, and the old man nodded sagely. “Be sure that you do, Harry. Don’t fumble about in the dark if we are capable of helping.”
Theo stared at the feather quill, eyes tracing down the rachis of the feather as he observed the unnatural coloring, light blue pigment mocking him from the unassuming shelf it sat on. Then, he let his gaze fall sideways, taken by a shockingly red feather with brown spots. It was bold, yes, but natural, in direct contrast but of similar feeling to the blue feather.
“Enough of that Narcissa, let the boy go.” His father’s gruff voice spoke from behind them, and Draco couldn’t help but jump slightly as a large hand came down onto his shoulder and he was firmly pulled away from his mother's warm embrace. He glanced up at Lord Malfoy’s face, trying to discern the emotion there. They were… infinitesimal, if they even existed. He looked away quickly, suddenly feeling inadequate.
“You don’t like those chains very much, do you Locket?” He cooed, reaching a hand out and brushing it across the thing’s bald head tenderly. “You must want out of them, hm?”
Harry thought warmly, his hand absentmindedly coming up to the middle of his soulmate’s back as they went further away from the tents, the voices around them slowly receding until Draco’s was the only voice of note, spare for the quiet murmurs of people faraway.
His change of subject made her smile gratefully, still dabbing at her eyes as he placed the dirty wine glass on a side table and poured her a fresh glass of iced water. “Ah, that explains it. Who is your guest?”
“I don’t care.” Tom’s words were hard, and in an instant those icy blue eyes widened in shock. “I don’t care what Harry does with it, as long as Dumbledore dies in the process. If he wishes to destroy the world, then that is his decision to make.”
upwards, and the stone floor beneath their feet came surging upwards to sweep his grandfather off his feet. The man stumbled to the floor, and as he fell Theo scrambled for his trunks, throwing one near to the fire as he grabbed for the floo powder. There was a curse behind him as his grandfather hit the ground, and Theo didn’t bother to look behind him as he scrambled into the fire, picking up the thrown trunk as he yelled out ‘the Rookery!’ and fell away into a blaze of green.
Barty strained himself to try and hear more, but could not discern if his father had merely stopped talking or was speaking too quietly for him to gather anything.
“And what is the right path, horcrux? Is it death and destruction? Knowledge and power? If consciousness is subjective, then the right path is as well.”
Weird question, but does anyone actually read the summaries? I put an unnecessary amount of time into them sometimes, so I just want to know if that effort is recognized at all. Either way, you should totally read them (or continue to read them) not only are they most of the time very indicative of important parts of each chapter, but I sometimes try to make them funny too.
“You were born mad, you know that Potter?” He shot back noncommittally, hiding the bite to his tone as he shoved the biscuit into his mouth and began to chew. Harry snorted a laugh, leaning back in his chair as Perenelle jolted forwards, her eyes curious and hands idle.
Harry righted himself, ignoring the ache in his back and tightness in his chest as he smiled at the pair. “Thank you—both of you—for all you’ve done for me. I will be sure to stop by whenever I can.”
He studied the emptiness for a moment, contemplating it with narrowed eyes. It was strangely familiar in a way that he couldn’t entirely place. It reminded him of what Harry’s mindscape had looked like before it had been fully constructed, when there had been nothing but the occasional passing memory that he could latch onto or the whisper of thoughts that the boy might have through the day. Humming, perturbed with the familiarity, Tom neared the hole again and reached out with practiced ease, searching for that familiar tug of a memory as he tried to grasp onto it. At first, he tried to reach out for a memory he shared with Harry, but upon gaining nothing but a book from his own library soaring from the stacks to hit him in the head, he cautiously settled for a memory of his school years.
“Of course.” Harry smiled wide, his back very nearly breaking as he leaned down as far as he could, grin growing wider as Perenelle leaned up and, as she gave him a playful little pat on the cheek, kissed him sweetly on the forehead. “I might be able to come around for Yule too, if you would care to have me.”
His father sighed lowly, rubbing a tired hand down his face as they neared the steps. “I don’t know how it happened, but I think the ring horcrux has gained a physical form.”
Draco had already put his trunks away in the overhead compartment when he entered, and was now sitting sternly near the window, aggressively reading through one of the course books for the coming year. Harry tried to recall when they had gone out for school supplies. It had to have been in the last week, though he couldn’t quite remember what day. Oh well, it hardly mattered.
Lucius Malfoy stepped out of the west wing, a glass of ludicrously expensive champagne held aloft in one hand. He stumbled, hiccuped, before letting out a burp so crass and undignified that a sewer rat would find itself taking offence. His wife, who was equally drunk and carrying the bottle from where the unnecessarily expensive champagne had been held moments prior, merely laughed, and loosened his tie.
The spell broken, Harry gazed out into the empty hallway, rocked to his core and seconds away from destroying either a wall or himself. The air was impossibly still, dead as a corpse and rotting just the same. His hands shook as he slowly lowered himself to the floor, his fingers clumsily seeking out stability as he eased himself down onto the cold stone, finding frost and sleet and shards of glass-like ice waiting for him there.
before. He couldn’t remember ever even being grabbed roughly, or touched in any way that wasn’t gentle. Firm, yes, but gentle. Blood drumed through his ears, and in an incredible moment of clarity Theo thought that he might just understand why Harry had done what he did. In that moment, he wanted nothing more than to rip his grandfather to
“Right… well, thank you very much.” His voice betrayed the confusion he felt, though Harry seemed to be the only one to take any note of it, now very obviously fighting not to laugh as Draco gave him a confused look. Perenelle, however, waved her hand flippantly again, now in his direction, as she stood from her chair.
“I s’pose you’re draggin’ me off ta the study, darlin'?” He slurred, his words dragging together into an amalgamation of his own son’s unfortunate diction and the general cadence of a piss-drunk aristocrat. Narcissa hummed in response, hitching up her long skirts in an effort to move more efficiently through the Manor’s halls. Lucius saw the action differently, and reached out to caress the large expanse of leg that had been opened up for his viewing pleasure. “Are we off ta Alaska, then?”
Luna is always a lot of fun to draw, mostly because I don't typically let myself use a lot of bright colors in my art and she basically just strong-arms me out of that mentality. I've always seen Theo and Luna as a very telling 'polar opposites' couple, which is why in direct conflict with Luna's bright colors I had Theo in mostly beige and browns. This was not only a subtle nod to his elemental magic that will be more touched on in this year (oh boy) but also just how hard he tries to be very structured and, in the end, very bland. (Theo looks so dorky in this drawing whY-)
Her fingers left his cheek, and as he turned to water the next plant, she rested her hand on his upper arm.
Tom blinked, a sudden thought creeping into his mind as he turned to glance at the locket for what felt like the millionth time. He bit at the inside of his cheek, contemplative as he watched the creature writhe pitifully in its bonds. Surely the chair and chains wouldn’t disappear if they traveled from his mind to Locket’s, would they? Nothing from his mind ever disappeared if it was taken to Harry’s, and sat there until one of them brought it back. Though, they did have a unique living arrangement. It could easily be different for him and his soul shards.
Draco’s expression was confused, his face slightly illuminated by the light from the two wands as he glanced between the pair of them. Perenelle backtracked slightly, her face coming into view out of the darkness. She seemed amused.
Harry thumped his chest, clearing his throat as he set the offending biscuit back onto the plate. “Y-yes, I suppose you have a point. Though, people usually say I’m difficult to read, you know.”
loud, though perhaps he wasn’t giving his inheritance enough credit. If he could hear whispers from a room away, it was reasonable to assume that a crowded stadium would be nigh-unbearable to his sensitive senses. He sighed, before reaching up and plugging his fingers in his ears, hoping that most people would simply think that he was trying to avoid any embarrassment by the Veelas’ dancing.
Harry wheezed a laugh, doubling over as he seemed to almost gasp for air—not that the bastard needed it. Draco rolled his eyes, pushing Harry roughly in the shoulder as he continued to seemingly gasp for breath, tears gathering in the corners of his eyes. Draco took a moment to admire the wide smile on his soulmate’s face, before quickly getting sick of the mockery and pointedly rolled his eyes.
Theo let out a tired breath, holding a candle up close to his face as he squinted at a bookcase. Despite whoever had ‘allegedly’ designed his home, knowing their name wouldn’t change the fact that there were only a handful of windows in the manor and only
“Do you happen to know of anything going on at Hogwarts this year?” He pressed, wondering if questioning the spacey man might make the apparent ‘secret’ easier to discern. Xenophilius hummed, his fingers dancing across the dusty lid of an old glass jar.
His caution slowly bred curiosity, slowly as the door continued to sit there silently. It seemed to call to him, in a strange way. It felt eerily familiar in a sense, as if he had seen it before out of the corner of his eye several times, but had never stared straight at it. It was… just a little too tempting for his taste.
“Well, that’s peculiar.” Narcissa had an unreadable look on her face as she read the back of the letter, before handing it off to her inebriated husband. Lucius muttered indistinctly as he took it, ripping the envelope open without even glancing at the name or address. In fact, once he had wrangled the letter out, he threw the envelope into a random direction with insouciance, declaring it irrelevant entirely as he settled in to quickly skim the letter. It was quiet for a moment, before Lucius paused abruptly, as if personifying a lump of wood, before shooting up into a more respectful sitting position and reading the letter again, his inebriation being won over by pure shock. Narcissa watched him with concern for a moment, but as her husband began onto his third reading of the letter she stood and made her way over to the thrown envelope, reading the back of it again to make sure that she had not been fooled.
Theo went still, watching with narrowed eyes as the man sped around the house as if looking for something. “Who is ‘Her’?”
“Harry, what do you think this is? Lucius Malfoy disowning his son, the dark mark at the World Cup, Barty Crouch Junior being freed from the imperious... and many other things, I’m sure. It happened in your last life, and it's happening again right now. It isn’t going to stop and it is going to get
“Well, she certainly wrote this into existence. That, at least, is obvious.” He was doubtful about any other people that could have done it, as Lucius no longer had a horcrux in his possession and all other means of giving him new life were either very near impossible or so improbable that he ignored them on principle. In the end though, he supposed it didn’t matter. He could sit there and contemplate what had happened until even Harry showed signs of age, but that would get him nowhere. The end result of the ring gaining physical form was not made null and void by an impossible and unknown cause.
Harry definitely wasn’t sorting out whatever potion he had been brewing, but Draco wasn’t going to pry. The other boy had been spending the vast majority of the past month doing piles upon piles of paperwork for Gringotts, something about needing to circumvent his magical guardian for ease of movement. Harry hadn’t been very keen on sharing more than that, and Draco had already gotten a good idea of just what he was doing, so he had left it be. Besides, Harry seemed to want Draco to focus on ‘sorting through his emotions’, whatever that was supposed to mean, instead of bothering with the legality surrounding his new… familial issue, so he had left it be and focused on… well, he didn’t really know what to focus on. He certainly hadn’t been focusing on his emotions though, that much felt obvious.
“I… I’m fine.” He croaked, his shoulders beginning to shake as his grip suddenly loosened, and in a single, swift movement his face was buried in Harry’s collar, his sobs barely muffled by the soft cotton of Harry’s blazer. He wrapped his arms around the sobbing boy tightly, pulling him closer as his body continued to shake, his hands gripping at Harry’s sides so hard it nearly stung.
Harry Potter wasn’t a monster quite yet, and Draco Malfoy proved that. Or, he at least had to prove it
In that shadowed darkness of night, free from the binds of his blood and breathing the hot summer air of late August, Barty Crouch smiled. He smiled so wide that he thought his cheeks were going to split in two. He smiled so wide that his jaw ached, groaning against the pressure as he fought down a crazed, glorious laugh. Immortal! After years of conquest, of anguish, of pain, his lord had truly become immortal.
“I’m fine. Once that happens, I’ll change my name officially and move into the Black family’s ancestral home. I believe it’s somewhere along the borough of Islington, but specifics are shoddy at best. I’m sure the bank has its exact address, so it won't be difficult to find and move into over the summer after fourth year.”
the time to meet with Sirius once more before leaving France, though only shortly, and only to say that Draco was taking up the Black heirship. Sirius hadn’t said much to that, seeming rather unapproachable around the subject, before he had given Harry a very heavy look before telling him sternly to be careful.
She couldn’t figure out why though. It was niggling at her subconscious, trying desperately to drag back the memories of dreams of a world that she didn’t recall ever living in. She was missing something, something so incredibly
“It's alright Pans. I’m used to it, you know?” Pansy frowned as Tracey stretched, her leg kicking out as she stepped up onto a fallen tree. They were far out in the woods at this point, and had come across a rather shallow creek that they needed to cross. Tracey had apparently decided to take her chances with the fallen log, which looked about as stable as a piece of twine.
Her hand was hot, an inferno compared to his own. Surely she was in pain, right? He tried to tug on his hand slightly, distantly hoping she might let go and save herself the unnecessary discomfort and potential hypothermia. She tightened her hold on him instead, so comforting when he knew that he must be hurting her. Harry sucked in a breath, grabbing weightlessly for her hand as more tears began to fall. It was cruel, and selfish, but she seemed to feel that he deserved the comfort, and he certainly wanted it terribly.
Tom’s voice was soft and understanding as he whispered gentle promises through Harry’s mind, his tone somber as it echoed in his skull. Harry unwittingly found himself relaxing, the shards of crystalline ice weaving up his arms slowly receding.
“Damn it Luna.” He hissed, grabbing for his wand with his right hand as he tried to shake the glitter off of his left. Unsurprisingly, his efforts were met with silent mockery from the glitter, which stuck firm. Waving his wand sharply, and with a muttered ‘scourgify’ under his breath, the majority of the glitter on his hands and desk disappeared, though he was certain that he would be finding many individual particles of the sparkling material all over his room for the rest of his time there. Sighing, Harry wrangled the letter free, spilling even more glitter onto himself and his desk. With a muttered curse, he brushed the majority of it off of the letter and left the rest, making a mental note to clean it off of himself after seeing what Luna had to say to him besides that she wanted him and all of his clothes to be covered with sparkles.
Harry huffed a laugh, his cold, steadying hands leaving Draco’s shoulders as he stepped away and, going off the considerable dip in the cushion beneath his legs, sat down on the other side of the couch from Draco. He groaned in pained anger, bitterly wondering who Harry thought he was, abandoning his soulmate like that, before tucking the thought away for a time that his stomach wasn’t doing somersaults. No, that was an inaccurate descriptor, the bloody thing was doing a synchronized dance with the rest of his organs.
