Harry's felt his eyes widen: he never really stopped to think if there were others like him, he had just always
“Zabini?” Harry asked and only continued when Nigel nodded in confirmation. “Zabini wants to go to the ball with me?”
“Loony, can you go downstairs? We need some extra rope for Neville,” the first voice asked, even though it seemed like less of a request and more of a command.
, Harry thought as he walked back to the Gryffindor common room. Tomorrow was the ball and he, in fact, did not have a mask yet.
“Ouch Eduardo! English idiotas?! That really hurt,” Pansy said, walking by with faux hurt written all over her face.
Harry turned around at the sound of the voice and wasn’t surprised to see Blaise there, a grin taking up half of his face, teeth shimmering in the hot sun, and his sword hanging threateningly from his belt.
What followed was Eduardo chasing Ron and Pansy all over the main deck while cursing them in Spanish. It was rather a spectacle really, and Harry couldn’t help but smile to himself.
The man took a step backwards, into the flames that were trying to devour him. “Is that so? Then indulge me, what’s your name?”
What he didn’t notice though, was that even though the streets might be busy, some people on the streets could often be seen staring at Harry, and with every street that he went into, there were more people on his trail, following him, almost seamlessly.
smiled at Luna, it wasn’t at all like the shark grin he'd given Harry on more than one occasion. "Good thank you," Blaise said before turning back to face Harry, the toothy grin immediately back on his face. "Don't worry Potter, you're going to learn how to fight properly in no-time." And with that Blaise turned and left, leaving Harry with Luna together on the quarterdeck.
Far away a scream could be heard, it was a voice that Harry recognised vaguely, but not enough to name it. The tone was desperate, yet even though Harry had heard plenty of desperate, devastated tones he hadn’t heard one quite like this before. The voice screamed a name. A name that seemed to be so familiar to Harry that the edges of his mind were trying to grasp it.
Before they could think about it for much longer, someone yelled a loud, “Look!” And it was immediately clear what the person who had yelled had meant, because far below the horizon, in the distance, a large patch of land was to be seen. For now all that they could really see was a kind of blurred yellow spread of land but it was enough to send the crew into complete excitement and as Harry looked up he saw how Neville was changing the black pirate flag to that of a normal merchant’s ship.
Yet, Pansy didn’t seem the slightest bit surprised as she huffed. “Positive. I should know, I’m the person who has had to tend to you.”
A breath, a burning city, one man slowly arose from the flames: the skin on his face was pale and his nose seemed to have burned off, leaving only two gaping holes in his face to breath through.
Immediately a grumbling noise came from behind the door, the voice unmistakably the Captain's. "Blaise I swear to--" The Captain's words trailed off as he saw Harry standing there, his eyes growing wider. "You're awake." The statement sounded like a breath, the volume barely above a whisper.
about the map: there was a golden line woven across it, the end of the line seemed to be fading while the new beginning was bright and clear, sticking out proudly against the sand coloured background. The line seemed to be
Suddenly a pale finger moved to set aside the barrel and all Harry could do was sit there, frozen, exposed. He now had a full view of the woman in front of him: blonde hair shimmering in the dim light, her eyes shining in a curious silvery grey, her smile broad and her clothes circling in loose ruffles around her.
“Ah yes, that’s our very own figurehead ,” Ron said noticing what Harry was staring at. “She's beautiful isn't she?” Ron smiled fondly, nostalgia crawling up his face, making his features seem softer.
“You can also stay hidden there if you want. I myself always fancy some hide and seek.” She walked towards him, her feet barely touching the ground, and crouched in front of the barrel. “You’re quite the special one, aren’t you? My name is Luna by the way, even though everyone aboard this ship calls me Loony.” A small smile graced her lips at the mention of her nickname. “What’s yours?”
Before Harry knew it he was enveloped in Luna’s sage-y scent, her arms embracing him tightly. “I’ll miss you Em. ”
Blaise threw him a sword, and Harry barely caught it in time, the hilt scraping his shoulder. “Yes, don’t use your powers,” Blaise said, the grin still plastered on his face.
“C’mon show the people how powerful I am, show them your light,” the shadow said, their voice unrecognizable, distorted, but known to Harry’s ears.
Lavender clearly chose to ignore this remark as she directed herself at Harry. “Have you already found out who your date is? We’re all very curious.” She winked at her last sentence and Harry decided that he didn’t even want to know who she meant with ‘we’.
“S’fine, now you two can fight over which mask is going to be worn by who.” Ginny nudged Hermione with her elbow, just like Harry had done with Ron moments before. “This is going to be fun.”
Harry stood at the railing of the deck for another hour or so, thinking about nothing in particular, hypnotized by the waves below, until a certain scent broke him out of his trance.
Blaise grinned, his white teeth shining like a shark's when he'd just spotted his prey. "I was just about to say the same thing, Draco."
“Calm down Pans, he’s going to work with me, I’ll feed him until he drops.” Eduardo winked at her and Pansy just huffed in return, clearly offended by both Ron and Eduardo cutting her off. “Come along now Harry, we’ve got work to do.”
Harry gathered all his power together to nod and the Captain carefully removed his hand from Harry’s mouth.
The door to the space that Harry was in was softly pushed open, light from upstairs blinding Harry slightly as he saw the silhouette of a long haired woman stepping into the room. She calmly walked past him, not even seeing the barrel he was hiding behind, and grabbed the rope in the corner, cutting a piece of it off with one sharp pull of a knife.
was the Captain and only stopped when Harry and he were mere centimeters apart. “Come,” Blaise said. “I believe it’s time you and the Captain have a
"Yeah," Harry answered as he let his gaze wander over the horizon, looking at the infinite blue that was the sea, the waves crashing on the ship, as if they were trying to grasp the wooden front of the Amortentia.
HI thanks for reading !!! Omg I really hope people will even click on this AHH im so nervous about uploading this.
“Yes Ronald,” Hermione hissed. “I think Harry made that fairly clear with the words: ‘I’m going to the Yule ball with a Slytherin.’” She pinched the bridge of her nose. “Now the rest of the school knows as well, congrats.”
“Rule number one: never lower your sword before battle is over,” the Captain said, looking way too smug.
Luna didn’t answer, instead someone else spoke up, “First of all it’s not ‘this ship’, it’s the Amortentia, and second of all you can always just get off at the next harbour when we stop.”
there, coming from above, seeping through the wooden planks that separated two floors of the ship. In the space Harry was in, he could see barrels, just like the one he’d hidden behind, stacked up against each other, all on their sides to be balanced.
from him, somehow. It seemed slightly out of place for this many people to feel remorse over him taking his leave, but Harry brushed it off, it wasn’t important anymore.
Harry arched one brow, confused as to why she was going there, the kitchen definitely didn’t secretly include the infirmary, that Harry could be sure of.
real illusions. The way the fire had always circled around him in the dreams ominously: threatening and intimidating, too much of a threat to be real.
The tall boy in the crow's nest yelled something inaudible to Harry's ears, but understood by the panicked crew as the first lightning bolt hit the ocean not too far away.
“Okay,” The Captain said softly, both in character and tone. “C’mon.” He lifted Harry by the shoulder, wrapping Harry’s arm around his neck to keep him up. Harry’s feet seemed to refuse to function: he was completely numb, as if his body didn’t belong to him. As a result the captain basically had to drag Harry through the streets, back to the harbour.
Then Pansy did something strange: she stopped right in front of the door that led to the galleys and knocked on the wood next to the doorframe, after she’d done this she took a step back and waited.
“Here,” Luna said, a soft smile on her face. “copy me.” She started making twists and turns with her sword and Harry tried his best to copy her, but it never quite came out the way she had done it.
Harry had been determined to see the sunrise and he wasn’t going to back out just because the Captain was here. Luckily, the Captain was standing on the very left of the quarterdeck looking in the direction where the sun was going to rise, meaning that Harry could just stand on the very
“Oh, just shut up and kiss me already you mumbling nuisance, I’ve been waiting way too long for this.”
Harry smiled slightly at Ron’s rambling, the guy didn’t seem so bad, certainly not what Harry had expected pirates to be like.
Blaise rolled his eyes. “Fine Weasel, go for it, don’t fall into the sea, please.” And with that Blaise turned around and walked back to the sterncastle deck. “Draco for the love of everything wicked, let me steer the damn ship, you steer like a maniac!”
Harry squinted, trying to properly look at the man without being blinded by the fire behind him. “Who are you?!”
Harry could see the man who had spoken now: tanned skin, dark glistening eyes and a playful smile on his lips.
“You two are positively hopeless,” Ginny said as she saw Ron and Harry standing in front of an empty basket, that previously, had contained masks. “I just knew that you two idiots weren’t going to buy yourself some proper masks before they were all gone. It’s the bloody night right before the ball, and you only go looking
Harry could feel the familiar lighting seep into his skin as he welcomed the storm. He smiled when he recognized the storm beckoning him, knowing that they'd met many times before.
Harry was confused, that was his name wasn’t it? He had been called plenty of names before but this was his
try to be back as soon as possible! I hope you've been enjoying the story uptill now because trust me it's only gonna get juicier from here ;) (at least I hope you'll like what I'm working on as much as I like working on it)
compared to the flames in his dream. His breaths seemed to come and go way too fast as he could feel the hysteria building up in his body.
Harry couldn’t help but snicker at Ron’s unfortunate practically ancient robes, earning him a desperate glare from Ron. “I’m sorry Ron, but look at it this way, no matter how ghastly your date’s dress may look, you'll always outshine her and hopefully it will comfort her to know that she could never go more wrong in her outfit than you already have.”
“I need a little bit more than that to do a proper check.” She rolled her eyes, again. Rolling her eyes really did seem to be something she rather enjoyed doing. “It really would be best if you would just take your top off, I promise I won’t jump you.” She spoke the last part of that sentence with extreme exhausted sarcasm, as if to make clear that she would much rather do anything
Harry folded his sleeves back down, covering the scars again. He turned his stare back to the horizon, but now that he’d started thinking about his past, he couldn’t distract himself from his thoughts anymore.
"Come on in," said a voice drenched in a Spanish accent from behind the door. "I can hear your hunger."
“Harry! Mate!” Ron came running towards them, breaking Neville off in the middle of his sentence. “Welcome back to the world of the living I should say!”
Harry forced his breathing to slow down, taking long breaths and letting them out again, just like Lily had taught him. Slowly something else began to dawn on him.
“No-o I don’t mean for me, no, erm, Blaise told me to ask you,” Nigel said, while going red and rubbing the back of his neck in a nervous gesture.
He eventually crawled behind a barrel and froze, fearing for his life, as he had done for practically his whole life.
“Oi mate! Over here!” Ron yelled as soon as he noticed Harry, waving frantically at him to come over.
, his head was seemingly trying to split into two. Harry couldn’t help but crawl up into himself. What was happening? And why was it all happening so quickly after one another?
. “It’s especially cute when they try to hijack the ship. Anyways we jump out and take their belongings, while killing them as payback for even daring to set foot here.”
“You leave the ship for what? Half an hour? Less? And you’re almost dead already?!” The Captain yelled in frustration as he easily beat the people in black robes. “How is that even possible?”
Slowly she shifted her eyes from the shirt on the floor to Harry’s upper body, and as she murmured a soft ‘Save the Queen’ under her breath Harry knew that it wasn’t because he was so incredibly good-looking.
“So, anyway Blaise was standing there literally holding a candle, the hot wax dripping on his fingers, and I kid you not, he passed the burning candle to Neville as if it was a bomb, and Neville gave the candle to Eduardo, and so a chain reaction suddenly formed, everyone passing the damn candle to each other, until Loony eventually caught it and calmly walked to the main deck to throw it in the sea while her hands were burning. She had burns for weeks after that.”
Harry didn’t get a chance to touch the food during dinner, running around doing chores, not getting a moment of rest. The pirates around him were laughing but not necessarily at him in particular, just everything and everyone, taking the piss out of each other and even their beloved sea, enjoying the light topics of conversation that flowed seamlessly. Harry even found himself slightly smiling when Ron burned his hand on a piece of chicken, Neville laughing quietly next to him and Blaise rolling his eyes playfully muttering something that sounded suspiciously like 'Greedy bastard' under his breath.
Harry nodded and followed the Captain inside his quarters, shutting the door behind him with a distinctive click.
Ginny ushered them both out the common room hastily and kept following them until they were well down to the great hall, before joining Neville as his date.
Nigel grinned widely, his teeth showing in the process. “I’ll go tell him then,” he said as he started running back towards the dungeons, his feet hitting the  floor hard.
Neville took Harry to a room where beds were hammocks up on each other in rows, some were already in use by snoring pirates and other were still empty. He pointed Harry to one of the empty spots.
Neither of them had looked at each other for the whole duration of the conversation - if you could even call it that - but Harry didn’t mind this, he wasn’t ready for the Captain’s glaring intensity and he was far too enraptured with the stars to look at him himself. “I don’t think I could ever get used to it, not after living in the city and knowing what you miss out on by not seeing this.” Harry spoke softly as if he would chase the stars away if he spoke too loudly.
Harry couldn’t move, his body refused to, he was frozen to the spot, too scared to move a single muscle.
It might not have been Harry’s most clever moment: running onto a ship, but he had already decided that he would hide here until he could be sure that the man really
He softly grabbed the railing and he felt the Captain’s eyes on him for a second before they directed themselves back at the night sky. The sky was clear and stars were lit up, seemingly dancing their way through the night sky, like little lights lighting up the dark, flying high above them in wonder. Harry hadn’t seen stars like this before in his life: he had always lived in cities, hiding in deserted buildings or running under the prominent street lights that blocked out the stars above. To see stars so openly now was a true wonder and it would be a lie to say that he wasn’t in pure awe.
insecure about showing his scars, - the people aboard all already knew who he was, it was impossible to miss with the light show he’d given yesterday - but still, he couldn’t help but feel terribly bad about it, sweat beading on his forehead.
When after what Harry could only presume were several minutes nothing happened, he let out a sigh of relief and finally allowed himself to look at his new surroundings. It was dark, the little light that
“Are you sure that I’m the right person?” Harry asked, still confused, but slightly relieved that Zabini hadn’t, in fact, meant to ask him. Who in Slytherin could be in their right mind to want to ask Harry? They all hated him. Who could it possibly be? Parkinson? Bulstrode? A shudder went through him as he briefly considered Goyle to be an option. Maybe it was someone from a lower year?
“Don’t worry Em, you’ll be safe here. this is the sea, no one can trap you here.” Luna glanced at the infinite turquoise waters that were stretching out below the horizon. “At sea everyone is free,” she added with a smile, her gaze distant.
“He used to work in the kitchen with me,” Eduardo said, giving Ron a push in the side with his elbow. “that is, before he got promoted.”
“Weasel! Come here! I know you ruined this, it has your fingerprint of destruction all over it!" Blaise's voice carried over the whole ship, making both Harry and Ron turn in surprise.
Once Ron had unfolded the gangway, ready for the pirates to get onto land, Harry heard Luna call out for Harry. She came running for him, bolting past everyone in a hurry.
The next hour was filled with Ron excitedly rambling about every part of the ship: showing Harry everything on board and talking with a fond tone to his voice about everyone that was present, laughing about the crazy adventures they’d been through.
As Harry looked more closely at the masks he could see that the detail on them differed greatly: one was decorated with gold and red, a lion standing proudly between the holes for the eyes, golden leaves curling around the lion’s body as it roared; the other one, however, was decorated with green and silver, a snake carefully navigating in a figure of eight between the eyes, its tongue slipping out viciously while silver branches were positioned around it.
The Captain got straight to the point. "Did you see a man in your mind when the men in black robes attacked you?"
Harry frowned, a bit of uncomfortable anger coiling in his belly, Pansy seemed way too indifferent to killing. “That seems unfair, shouldn’t you just face them and fight?!”
The wood started folding in on itself, revealing a gap with a big hollow space behind it, the gap was so big that two people could easily fit through at the same time.
Dorian gasped lightly and touched his lips as if savoring the lingering feeling of Harry’s lips there. Slowly he looked up at Harry in surprise and gently, oh so gently, put his own delicate hand onto Harry’s face. He leaned in just like Harry had done just moments before and kissed Harry, Dorian’s kiss, compared to Harry’s, however, was harder, as if desperate, almost as if he knew that he wasn’t going to get a chance like this again.
. He couldn’t stand the stealing and killing that pirates were notorious for and even though Harry hadn’t seen them doing any of those things, he still knew to be wary. Besides, Harry thought as he remembered Lily’s death, he couldn’t have these people undergo the same curse that everyone else that he had ever been around had been forced to suffer. He couldn’t drag them along in the game of cat and mouse that everyone seemed to want to play with him.
aboard this ship?! He needs inspecting, who knows what diseases he could carry!” she yelled as she started inspecting Harry, lifting his sleeves and nodding at the scars she must’ve seen there. “For the Queen’s sake, do you even eat?” She lifted her face shifting her calculating stare to Harry’s eyes. “Or sleep?”
Eduardo quickly let Harry go while shoving a packet of food and some coins into his hands. Harry smiled softly at him as a sign of thanks.
Harry knew he had struck a nerve when the Captain eventually replied, his eyes shifting from Harry back to the night sky. “No.” The word was direct, making it clear that this was an out of the question topic for him.
The Captain's eyes seemed to pierce Harry's with all the intensity that they harboured. "Yes, he's… a criminal, to put it lightly. It surprises me that you don't know about him yet." He paused looking away from Harry for a second before continuing. "You're not the only person in the world with powers you know?"
“I know it’s not ideal to wake up this early, but when you work on a ship, you’ll have to,” Ron said, waiting for Harry to get up. Harry groaned again as he swung his legs over the side of his hammock.
Hey! Sorry, posting took a bit longer than expected hehe, but I'm back and I'm going to post normally from now on yet again :) Enjoy!!
The scars would light up whenever Harry used his powers or when he would feel something intensely, and naturally, now that he felt so incredibly anxious, his scars lit up in the faint fleeting way that indicated fear or nervousness.
The man behind Zabini really was breathtaking, even though his mask allowed Harry to see practically nothing of his face, the mask still perfectly carved out the man’s high cheekbones and piercing grey eyes that Harry seemed to recognise vaguely but not enough to properly place. The man was also tall and lythe, pretty in an almost feminine way.
Harry smiled slightly, the fragments of his nightmare threading on the borders of his mind, and walked over to Ron and Neville.
Harry wanted to angrily spit out ‘countries’ but before he could, he registered that there was something profoundly
Harry twirled Dorian around in a circle, copying the other dancers on the floor. As he looked around he saw that more people had joined the dance: Ginny winked at him while dancing with Neville, Hermione was softly smiling at Victor Krum while he held her hand surprisingly gently, and even Ron and Lavender were spotted dancing, even though Ron looked rather uncomfortable and kept shooting glances at Hermione.
Harry opened his mouth, but his mind was empty: no letters or words forming in his head and the more he tried to think of his name the emptier his head seemed to get.
Before Harry could tell him that that wasn't reassuring in the slightest, Blaise had already turned and left, walking decidedly towards the helm of the Amortentia.
Harry recognized the voice that had spoken, it was the first voice he had heard on the ship, and apparently it was the voice of the ship's Captain.
longer but that would mean that it was too much hehe (it would've become like 5k words if not more). Anyways thank you for reading and I'll catch ya next time ;)
Ron grinned. “Well just put some clothes on and meet me on the main deck, we have loads to do today.”
Ron immediately looked pained. “Bloody hell Harry, what am I going to do? I look like my great aunt Tessie!” He sniffed his robes briefly. “And I smell like her too!”
Harry softly padded out of the sleeping quarters and left for the quarterdeck, realising only as he stepped onto it that someone was already there: rays of starlight hit the person’s light hair, reflecting it, making the person almost seem as if they had a halo surrounding their head. It was beautiful, but it was also clearly the Captain, making it a slight problem.
Malfoy turned around in one sharp movement and let out a bitter laugh as he spotted Harry. “Yeah Potter it’s me, are you happy now? Now you know who I am!” Malfoy’s tone was harsh again, back to the mean bitter side of him. For some reason this struck something in Harry.
“I don’t see how that’s any of your business Zabini,” Harry said, sighing and beginning to slightly regret his decision of saying yes.
The world around Harry had grown very quiet apart from the buzz in his ears, but he was used to it, it was home, the only real home he would always have.
Sometimes he even felt his scars, almost as if they were alive: whenever he used his powers the scars would light up and slightly rise on his skin, and other times when he felt emotions very intensely the scars would slightly glow, creating an almost ethereal shimmer. Lily had always said that that was when he looked the most alive.
“Guys! We-” Ginny came barging through the door but stopped dead in her tracks when she spotted Ron. “Don’t you look just pretty Ronald!”
“Why does it do that?” Harry asked as he pointed to the gap in the wooden wall, the same gap they’d just stepped through.
“Your position is good, you just need to move your body in line with your sword, move as if the sword is an extension of your arm.”
Harry snickered warmly. “I already hated you, you were never very nice to me. Doesn’t mean that can’t change if you would want it to.”
“Isn’t it beautiful?” Eduardo asked from his left side. “Your first time experiencing the land in sight moment is always the best.”
“How do I know that you’ll let me go when we arrive at the next harbour?” Harry asked, trying to ignore the dread that was coiling in his stomach.
worth it, as a wide span of colours started flowing over into each other: pink mixing with red, red with orange, orange with yellow, all the while the golden ball of fire emerging from above a multicoloured sea.
“Please just call me Harry.” Harry didn’t want people to call him by his full name, it made him feel icky, made him think about things he’d rather not think about.
“Zabini told me that I would find out who you were tonight,” Harry said, smirking slightly as he leaned in closer to the stranger.
. There were only two doors on either side of the main deck: one leading to the galleys and one leading to the stairs for both the forecastle deck and down onto the orlop deck, so logically Harry had no idea where exactly to go next.
“I didn’t almost die,” Harry said, his voice quiet. It was true: he didn’t almost die: he had had a few vivid hallucinations, a slight panic attack and then he had fainted into the Captain’s arms. Nothing too close to death, unless you counted the people who had dragged him into the narrow alley, but they didn’t seem to want to kill him, they had wanted to kidnap him, just like so many others.
The Captain in turn took a step back, closer to the door. “No I’m afraid he can’t; don’t you want to experience your second time seeing land from the ship? I bet
“I can do it!” another voice answered, as a red haired man covered in freckles came running towards Blaise and Harry. From the corner of his eye Harry could see Luna’s smile grow wider, as if she’d accomplished something.
Ron nodded. “Sorry that we couldn’t tell you ourselves mate, it really was the Captain’s story to tell. It must be quite a shock to have that Riddle bastard suddenly in your bloody mind.”
still available for you.” Ron’s gaze was filled with pity now, almost overwhelming Harry with the intensity of it.
“Don’t what?! Don’t what Potter?!” He spit Harry’s last name out as if it was a filth that the world needed to get rid of. Harry slightly shrunk in on himself at the sound.
Harry grasped his aching forehead as the exhaustion that always came with meeting the lightning set in. Lightly he rubbed his eyelids, and smiled contently, momentarily forgetting that he was on a ship in the middle of an ocean with people that he didn't know, but who definitely
Only Neville, Pansy, Eduardo and Harry were left standing near the railing of the ship, they didn’t have jobs on the ship that required them to do anything right now thus they watched the people on shore yell at one another. None of them were particularly thinking of the people of Valencia, though, as they all seemed immersed in their own thoughts.
After Harry had finished his bowl of soup he kept looking at the sky, enjoying the warmth on his face, thoughts swirling around in his mind, creating a storm of emotions: he’d done and felt a lot today, too much for Harry to truly comprehend.
. Not now. He didn’t have to look around to know that the man was following him close behind, pushing aside the same people that Harry had pushed just moments before.
“You’re truly overreacting Ron,” Hermione said from his left. “It’s a masquerade ball, Harry may not even recognise them
As they stood by the railing of the deck, looking over the sea, Harry noticed the figurehead that stood below the bowstrip: it was a golden woman, standing proudly with the scale of justice balanced in her hand, smiling as she seemed to weigh the amount of justice, the hand that was not holding the scale was wrapped around the front of the boat itself as if protecting the ship by means of the justice in her other hand.
Harry nodded, remembering the promise he'd been forced to make earlier that day, and made his way off the quarterdeck, leaving Luna to gaze at the stars. Once he arrived on the main deck though, he remembered that he had absolutely no clue where the infirmary
Harry’s spirits were crushed as Cho Chang told him that she already had been asked for the Yule ball
"Oh that, that is my famous tomato soup." Eduardo moved to a large steaming pan and stirred around in it, eventually taking out a spoon of soup. "Here," he said, pointing the spoon at Harry. "have a taste."
“Okay, Dorian,” Harry said, softly smiling. “Is that a promise for me to hear about your real name then?”
Neville’s excited yell sounded from above, the sound of his voice so strong that it was even heard in the galley. “Land in sight! Land in sight!”
“Hey,” the red haired guy said, distracting Harry’s attention from the spectacle of Blaise yelling. “My name’s Ron or Weasel, the opinions about my name are divided so t’is your pick.” Ron’s gaze scanned Harry. “And you’re Harry Potter!”
Inside it smelled of musk and wood, not at all damp like you'd expect from an enclosed space at sea. Currently they were walking in a narrow corridor - if you could even call it that - passing two doors before they headed into the third one. Behind the third door there was an office space: there was a big desk at the end of the room, a map sprawled out over the table, on the walls there were other maps all with different designs, next to that, there were also various tools that Harry didn't recognise, but looked like navigation equipment on the hard wooden desk.
It was another night of Harry working for Eduardo and Eduardo as always was yelling ruthless commands at him. Tonight was the night that Harry was to eat with the rest of the crew and he didn’t know how to feel about that: eating with pirates did not seem like something he’d want to comply with, but then again, everyone on board except for Blaise or the Captain perhaps had been okay to him, not really barbaric in any way, so, he had decided that it couldn’t be any different from any other interactions that he might’ve had with the crew beforehand and to just go along and see where it would bring him. He was stuck on a ship with them anyways.
“What do you reckon they’re talking about?” Ron asked, suddenly next to him and whispering in his ear.
Ron opened his mouth to reply, but was quickly shut down by the Captain putting his hand up towards Ron’s face, signaling that he’d heard enough. “Nevermind, I don’t want to hear the excuse, what’s the nearest place we can take harbour? Blaise?”
“Oh yeah, definitely, I know what it feels like.” Dorian seemed to frown underneath his mask, but made his frown dissolve before Harry could look at it for too long.
Harry and Ron shared an alarmed glance. “Well,” Ron said. “your Slytherin date better hurry indeed, otherwise we might have a problem.“
The Captain took a step closer, his hand twitching: as if wanting to reach out but not quite knowing how. “Yes,” he eventually said, in a soft voice. “He always tries to find your weakest spot: he
Harry didn't need to try hard to remember. "He was pale and had a strange lack of a proper nose. As for how he talked: his voice was gravelly but weirdly smooth at the same time, whenever he spoke it was always in mysteries, as if he was asking me, daring me, to solve his riddles." Harry paused, looking at the Captain's frown. "It wasn't just a dream then?"
Harry nodded and started placing plates on the table, putting the large pan in the middle. The exact moment Harry was done with the plates was when the first people started walking in.
“Well,” Ron said, shrugging. “It could’ve been worse, we could’ve gone looking tomorrow night, five minutes before the ball.”
“Finally looking for the infirmary huh?” It was Pansy, sounding rather annoyed. Harry began to think that that just came natural for her.
“I suppose that’s logical.” The Captain’s voice was softer than before, and he was still looking at Harry, although his eyes were less intense.
Nigel began to shake his head frantically. “No,” he said. “No, he was asking for someone else, Blaise said that the person was too afraid to ask you themselves, he also said that you would find out who it was on the night of the Yule ball, if you accept that is.” He seemed to think things over in his head, as if checking that he said everything that Zabini had told him to say.
She made no intention to move when Harry didn’t answer yet again, instead she remained in front of the barrel, patiently waiting.
“Oh by the way, Captain?!” Ron yelled once dinner was almost over. The captain turned to Ron with one sharp movement. Ron continued, “We need to make a stop on shore soon, the supplies are running low. Again.”
“Shit,” Harry breathed, as he came to a screeching halt, realizing that he had run straight to the docks.
For the second time that night he felt the Captain’s eyes on him, but this time they felt different: somehow even more intense as a question seemed to be buried deep within that gaze, inspecting Harry much like Pansy would.
“May I?” Harry asked his date, in a perfect reenactment of what Mcgonagall had taught him, while extending his hand.
“You might be strong with your lightning and stuff, but are you worth anything without your powers?” Blaise grinned like a shark, teeth white and visible. “Fight me,” he said.
Harry shook his head, trying to properly register what just happened and started to, yet again, walk back to the common room, only this time, with completely different thoughts than before.
Luna winked at Harry. "Don't mind him Em, he's just a bit stressed right now," she added before leaving him behind and helping others to prepare for the storm to come.
hadn’t lost the man, so, Harry picked up his speed again and took a left, running along the seaside, his feet hitting the paved road harshly. A small voice in his head reminded him that the docks would stop at some point, it wouldn’t lead him anywhere, it was a dead end, but Harry didn’t listen, desperate to get away.
“Quick!” Lavender hissed while waving for Harry’s mystery date to come closer. “On the dance floor! Now!” She practically pushed both of them onto the dance floor when the man had reluctantly come over to where they were standing.
Luna guided Harry up the stairs, his eyes still wide from shock. It was only when he reached the top of the stairs that he noticed that the ship had long been set into movement, swaying on the endless Mediterranean sea.
would be so excited about him waking up. Instead of asking about that, Harry asked something else, though, something that seemed more pressing. “How long have I been out?”
“Hi there! Like I said, you don’t need to be afraid… ,” she trailed of, seemingly thinking about something. “You don’t need to be afraid Em.” she smiled while saying the last word.
Luna followed quickly after Neville and by the time she had sat down most of the rest of the crew had already entered the room apart from the ever absent Captain.
“Potter listen, this really isn’t my story to tell, and even if it’s true that I could, that doesn’t mean that I should. Please talk to Draco about this matter.”
It was beautiful and heart wrenching at the same time, as the lightning seemed to mourn with Harry about all the things they'd been forced to do with that power.
Harry stepped into the room with a sheepish look on his face and scratched the back of his neck. "Sorry," he said, embarrassed.
“At least it matches your eyes,” Ron said smugly about Harry”s mask, as he wrapped his own lion mask around his head, tying the red strings together in a knot. They were getting ready for the ball and Harry’s nerves were dancing around in his stomach.
“What?!” Harry said loudly, not quite understanding and not quite sure what to do with himself. “I’m sorry Nigel but I don’t think-”
“Interesting,” she said, before dropping his hair back down, covering the bolt shaped scar and scanning his body once again. “Yes,” she eventually said. “you definitely need to eat and sleep more.”
When the sun started rising it was the most breathtaking thing Harry had ever seen, it was painstakingly slow, but
Eduardo smiled at Harry. “Oh yeah, we met.” He turned back towards Ron, the smile fading from his lips, his features now serious. “I heard your conversation. I could give him a job in the kitchen.”
Sadness glazed over Dorian’s eyes for a moment and not long after he suddenly turned around and began leaving the hall, pushing people aside in a hurry to get away from Harry.
“Okay,” Ron started as soon as Harry arrived. “we need to give you some kind of job here aboard the ship, Captain’s orders.”
He couldn't help but grin as the storm created another lightning bolt that hit even closer to the ship, eager to reach Harry.
Malfoy let out a shaky breath, pinching the bridge of his nose  “honest to god Potter I want to bloody
“Clearly I did not.” Draco stated, sneering when Potter pulled his tongue out on him. Yes, seeing Harry Potter splashing disoriented in the black lake had been quite a sight, one he might imprint in his memory and tell his grandchildren, how he tricked the all mighty Harry Potter, the chosen one, to fall face down right into the black lake, letting out the most girly scream as he did so. You know, for pettiness sake. What he won't tell his grandchildren however, is how he himself fell to the very same trick, leaving him all wet and uncomfortable, his shoes squeaking with every step he takes.
He thought about making something special for lunch but he didn’t trust his still lacking cooking abilities. When he arrived at the House, Harry wasn’t waiting in the kitchen. Draco immediately set down the meal and went, running, upstairs. He found Harry on the second floor. One door was open and Draco almost burst into the room. Harry had open the window and he was sitting on the large double bed, looking at an old piece of parchment that he immediately closed when he saw Draco.
After cleaning the kitchen, he quickly answered Granger’s letter because the owl would not leave without an answer. After putting his black shirt and trousers, combing his blond hair and taking what he needed for the day, he finally went to the fireplace in the living room.
Harry smiled before laying on the bed, putting once again – Draco noticed – his arms behind his head. Draco remained silent, waiting for Harry to start, only to realize that he was now asleep. Draco couldn’t help smiling. He took the warm, and now clean, blanket which was at the end of the bed, to cover Harry. He stayed for a second, watching him sleep and he strangely understood why Harry hadn’t woke him up the day before. He closed the curtains before leaving the room.
Once again, Draco wanted to kiss Harry. Instead, he just went to hug him very tightly which caught Harry by surprise. The hug lasted maybe a bit longer than the norm but Draco needed it.
Harry had an aura of magic surrounding him and he was almost cornering Draco against the door. Draco was starting to feel his blood boils, which was a strange feeling after months of apathy.
Harry rolled his eyes before opening a parchment. On it was written the recipe for a Victoria Sponge Cake. The writing was very sloppy and Draco managed to read the post-scriptum “PS: The house-elves were not happy to see me. Why are you baking Malfoy’s favourite dessert?” before Harry snatched the letter from his eyes.
He could hear Potter protesting, asking Granger to drop him but she wasn’t listening. The loud shouts of Harry made them turn heads on their way to the Hospital Wing. Once Harry was on a bed, she finally let him go.
Granger immediately stepped back and made a few wand gestures. Draco quietly stepped forward and kneeled to look at Potter.
Harry looked at him until Draco understood that he wanted some privacy. Draco then went into the next room which was a bathroom, a very dirty one again, and he started to clean. Later, once Draco had got ridden of the cockroaches, he went back to the room and saw that Harry was still looking at that odd piece of parchment. It looked like a map. Before Draco could see more, Harry closed it again.
When they saw him, Draco immediately understood that Harry hadn’t told them that he was going to be here.
The next day, an owl did come to Draco’s house. It was carrying a nicely written letter asking him to come to London, at Grimmauld Place, later in the day. The letter was also explaining that he would have to talk with Harry about their schedule, and other various dispositions.
Harry then put the product in the trolley and he started to push it in directions of checkout. Draco was so confused, and a bit flattered too but he didn’t have time to think about it and instead followed Harry, scared of getting lost.
He really didn’t. Despite his signature messy black hair, and his washed-up clothes, Harry still looked handsome.
Draco woke up to hair tickling his nose. He realised that Harry was now laying on his chest and his left arm was around Harry’s body.
They stayed silent and Draco noticed how tired Harry looked. He wondered if Harry actually had had a good night sleep in a while.
She murmured something and before Draco could understand a thing, she had linked their arms and Apparated at the gate of Hogwarts.
They stared at each other for a while before she wished him good night, and left the room, taking his plate with her.
Draco felt his cheeks flushed so instead he went back to the kitchen to make sure he had turn off the gas. Harry followed him in the small kitchen.
Draco was immediately flustered, not used to being hit on at all. He didn’t have time to say something because he suddenly felt Harry’s presence and he saw that he was back. Harry looked at the man then at Draco, before putting a hand on Draco’s shoulder.
Draco had to admit that the moment he had seen Harry, he had immediately felt better. Perhaps that’s why he agreed to come with him and clean the attic once they were done eating.
Before leaving the place, Draco left a note telling his mum that he would not come back before the next day. It was probably earlier than usual when he arrived because Harry was nowhere to be found. Draco immediately started to panic but continued to search for Harry. He found him on the 2nd floor in one of the biggest bedrooms of the house. Harry was still sleeping so Draco walked away as quietly as he could and instead he went downstairs again to cook Harry's breakfast.
“Once I was old enough they … they quickly realised that I could be of use to them. So I had to learn how to cook, and clean, and do all the tasks that they didn’t want to do. My cousin was always hungry so I had to get good really quickly. And his appetite was so important to his parents that I would mostly eat leftovers if there were any.”
The fame was important to his parents but Harry’s name was too intertwined with the Dark Lord to be a positive connection.
Harry nodded then pretended to think about his question but it was easy to see that he had wanted to ask this since the first day.
He was trying to be indifferent but it was impossible because Harry was standing right in front of him, shirtless with his hair still wet. Draco was avoiding Harry eyes, looking instead at the nice landscape painting behind him.
Having cleaned the basement in two days, Draco was coming the next day, expecting to clean the ground floor. However, Harry was not in the mood for anything that day.
“I thought about it and maybe we could start with a big cleaning, and then a refurbishment. A lot of the furniture is damaged or missing or just too old.”
Harry looked away when Draco sat next to him. Draco gently took his hands to examine the damage. It wasn’t broken and the blood came only from the superficial wounds.
He noticed 'it’ when he sat down with pansy, suddenly realizing that the weight on his back wasn't just the glares and the shouts in his direction, but it felt more physical, like something was
When they finally reached the castle there was no need for a clock to tell them it's way past curfew, they walked quietly through the silent hallways, dim candle light stretching over the stone floors making the boys look way taller than they actually are, none of them talked just walking together in comfortable silence, it's exciting, mischievous even. If someone saw them they'd assume they went for a night swim, sneaking out of the castle to dip into the dark lake, perhaps they should do that for real some time, with them being friends now and all.
The platform was flooded with chattering students, with Hogwarts Express kindly waiting for all the students to return, Draco felt his mother's grip on his shoulder, clearly reading through his nerves “I will be fine” he mumbled, smiling at his mother weakly, tears flooded her blue eyes and she pulled Draco in into a lung crushing hug, even though she's way smaller than her now grown son, she still was a strong woman.
“Perhaps they will call us trash, murders maybe” Blaise chuckled, pushing from the window and walking over to Draco who was struggling with his tie “well that would be unoriginal” Draco smiled at him “they already called me that yesterday”
Harry tensed up at the sight, Draco Malfoy, a former death eater, was walking uncomfortably between the glaring crowd
He kind of stood there, looking everywhere and nowhere in the same time, the office was filled with so many things it was uncertain where to look at, so in his new manner, he simply stared at the floor
“I.. I know all of this sounds like an excuse.. I mean..” Malfoy bit his lower lip, thinking over his next words “but this could explain what I did to Longbottom and Hermione...at least a little…”  and it did, even though his bullying could never be justified, Malfoy is trying, and for the first time Harry could see it. “I know I don't deserve any more of your help Potter, but thank you for coming for the room of requirement with me” and with that he stood up, brushing grass off himself, the pale moonlight made his skin glow with a tint of blue “I should go, it's way after curfew.” Malfoy said and turned on his heel, and as he did so all the Solus leaped out of Harry's lap in order to run after their master, slowing him down as their claws dug into his pants. “M-malfoy wait!” Harry collected himself quickly hopping on his feet running right after Malfoy almost stumbling into the dark water, after he caught himself he reached out a hand at Malfoy, looking at him with pleading eyes. The boy rose a pale eyebrow in his direction, his eyes glistening with question while the Solus climbed up his torso back to their usual place at his back.
“Well, you almost did.” Harry mused, his voice hoarse only to squeak like a little girl when Malfoy lifted the Solus in an aggressive manner, kindly reminding him that he could go back to choking him at any moment. “I'm sorry I'm sorry please don't kill me!” Harry sobbed “I didn't die for this!!” Malfoy rolled his eyes dramatically, dropping the Solus into his lap. “You should've just stayed dead. Would make my life a whole lot easier.” and for a mere second, Harry agreed with him.
“Draco...you….” Snape's painting spoke, moving slowly just like he did when he was alive “...look horrible, your father would never allow you wander around looking.. like that.” Draco felt a dry chuckle leaving his body “father’s in jail” he said, Snape nodded “of course he is.”
“Are you okay?” The Gryffindor whimpered, his whiny demeanor making Draco's blood boil, so he pushed him, hard. “ Fuck off!” He yelled, Ignoring Longbottom’s cry of pain as he fell on the ground, Draco ran, blurry doors and corridors leading him somewhere, somewhere safe
He remembered his lessons with Dumbledore, telling him that Voldemort was created from a man who had no love, no heart, what if leaving Malfoy like that will create an another Voldemort? Harry rubbed his scar, kind of instinctually, it didn't throb like it used to when he who must not be named was alive, but Harry remembered the pain clearly.
Maybe that's his purpose? Harry wondered, could it be where he comes in? To help Malfoy get to the finish line so when the next time comes for him to turn his back so carelessly to Harry, just like he does now- “hey,” Draco turned to him, one hand resting on the bathrooms door handle “don't just stand there, or does the mighty Harry Potter doesn't need to wash his face?” He snorted, already following Draco in “shut up Malfoy.” He said.
“What the fuck?!” Draco exclaimed, his back pressed to the trains window “what are you doing?” Pansy frowned at him looking as if she wasn't seeing it
Everything about this action startled Draco, why would Potter care, out of all the people? This was so unusual, so un-Potter like, Draco was so tired of things changing, deep in his heart he hoped that at least his relationship with Potter would stay the same, yet that jerk went all the way to offer him
Look, I know it takes so long for each update, And I deeply apologize. This story is very important to me, but life keeps twisting and turning in such ways some times I feel like I'm drowning.
When he entered it however, he immediately knew why the Solus has led him there. Neville Longbottom was sitting there, his figure small and hunched under the sink, just like Draco had been when he just returned to Hogwarts, skipping meals and spending most of his time falling apart in the bathroom, that's when Neville came in, bringing him sandwiches. He probably made a noise, since Neville's head perked up sharply, his bloodshot eyes wet and leaking rapidly. Draco had taken a reflexive step back, and then saw the Solus strolling right up to the boy, sitting there, waiting. He took a deep breath and did the same, sliding down the wall at his side, far enough for both of them to be comfortable yet close so he wouldn't have to yell. He stared into nothingness for a minute before just offering the boy his plate. “I made pie.” He said, Longbottom just glared at him. “I, uh.. don't eat sweets so..just take it.” He shoved it in his direction until Neville took it, giving him a sceptical look “I didn't poison it or anything, otherwise Potter and the Weasel would probably be dead.”  The boy didn't answer, but Draco didn't expect him to. His chest had been heavy and bothering even without his words, telling how he's not interested in hearing Draco out, so he didn't give him the chance to do so, “what happened?” He asked him, leaning his head against the cold wall, he had the indescribable urge to fiddle with his sleeves. “You know, um, it's sometimes easier to talk so someone you hate than er..a friend.” Longbottom just stared, and it had gotten on Draco's nerves, can't he see he's trying hard here? This git is probably debating whether he should smash this pie right into Draco's face, and he wouldn't blame him; he gave him the pie after all.
Harry would always accept, letting the bolt run through his veins and letting it curl around his body in twists and turns, careful to avoid shredding his clothing, gentle and oh so powerful. Infinite power as far as Harry could feel, his eyesight growing white, a sign that his eyes had taken on the same colour.
Harry knew all too well how his arms, front, back and even neck were covered in one big lightning trail. It was as if the lightning had used him as a conductor: gruesome purple forks covering his back, branching out over his shoulders and neck and from the shoulders reaching further down his front and arms.
“Well for starters,” another voice came from behind Pansy and Blaise. “he could get you lot out of the doorway.”
“Listen Harry,” he started. “If you ever need our help or if you, um, just want to come back, we’ll be there. We would love to have you on our ship.”
His back and arms were exposed, only a pair of trousers clinging to his sweaty legs. Harry was sitting crumpled up on the floor, pain angrily flaring in every part of his body.
“Always.” The voice of the man was, again, recognisable, but it was soft and careful in a way that Harry hadn’t heard before.
The question went unanswered, the thundering of the storm easily overpowering the meak sound of Blaise's voice.
Blood was gushing from the black robed man’s mouth as he slowly seemed to open it to talk. He directed himself at Harry, not paying any attention to the Captain’s sword hovering above him. “Don’t believe for a second that you’re safe, he will come back, stronger than anyone you’ve ever fought before.”
”Don’t know how much value you would attach to a pirate’s word, but you have my word that you can get off at the next stop,” the man said, the grin still plastered on his face.
“Ah,” Eduardo said. “Valencia, one of the most beautiful cities of the glowing country we call España. I wish we had more Spanish people on board, but no, instead I’m stuck with you English idiotas.”
Naturally Harry followed him, he rushed past various dancing people who all shrieked when they were pushed aside in Harry’s run. “Sorry!” Harry yelled.
The whole crew had gone ominously quiet now, Luna slowly retracting her arms from Harry. The pirates shot each other a few
When Harry frowned, Luna seemed to take notice. “Get it? Em? Short for Emerald? Because your eyes are the colour of emerald?”
“Ah Ron! There you are!” Lavender came running towards them as soon as they set foot in the already overflowingly busy hall, her lilac dress waving around her legs as she ran and an equally purple mask in front of her face. “Interesting choice of robes.”
“Oh that? That’s just the Captain; Draco Malfoy, he can be a real pain in the arse, and either has one of two moods: grumpy or slightly less grumpy. You probably would do best avoiding him, he can be kind of scary.” Even though Ron spoke about the captain in a negative way, Ron's tone was still somewhat admiring, his eyes looking to his leader with respect.
The man’s smile grew. It was twisted. “You’ve made this name your own to such a degree that even here, where I’m in control, the
“I haven’t been able to sleep for a while now, yesterday was the first time I slept in forever,” Harry said, as he let out a soft yawn, knowing that if he would try to go to bed now he would just be stuck with his thoughts all over again.
Venom laced the captain's voice when he spoke again, pointing a dagger, Harry hadn't even seen him pull out. "Who are you and what are you doing here?!"
When they dropped off the soup bowl and bid their goodnight to Eduardo, Eduardo just winked and smiled at Harry before shooing the both of them out of the kitchen with a bunch of rushed Spanish curses.
Malfoy’s eyes grew a bit wider and then he said, as if he couldn’t help it, “Haven’t you heard Potter? Mean and bitter are my specialities.”
“Are you barking mad Harry?!” Ron yelled as they were sitting in the great hall the next morning. “You’re going to the Yule ball, with a Slytherin?!” The hall had gone strangely quiet and Harry wasn’t surprised to see that most people were either looking at Ron for his outburst or at Harry. Even the Slytherin table had gone quiet and Harry could see Zabini smirking at his victory.
Ron was just about to open his mouth to say something in return, but was quickly shut up by Ginny. “Don’t Ron, we all know it’s going to sound stupid, whatever you were going to say. Here,” she said as she tossed two objects in their direction. “Be happy that I thought of you morons last minute.”
Before Dobby earned his freedom, he had been serving the Malfoy family, with Lucius abusing him endless. Only thanks to Harry's trick during his second year he managed to free him, he often wondered if the Malfoys got a new house elf since. Harry rubbed his nape sheepishly “yeah, he protected me to the end.” Now Harry found himself looking at his shoes, it was weird talking about death like that, especially with Malfoy, his feelings never really occurred to him, how he should probably speak about what he is going through more, he remembered openly mourning someone only after Sirius- oh great, another death on Harry's account, maybe he shouldn't think about anything, maybe he shouldn't speak at all. “He teleported you guys out of the manor” Draco went on, not paying much attention to his distress  “what.. um..”
“Potter.” He said, the boy immediately noticing him, with his whole gang turning over to look at Draco, all glaring at him.
“What did you do?” Hermione replaced her silly boyfriend, eying Harry with concern “i offered him help” Harry answered, “oh, that's good” Hermione’s face lit up, she was all about helping those in need, even if it was Malfoy
Draco blinked a couple of times frowning “sod off Potter, I was already falling asleep!” He said, pushing Potter off his bed. “No please! Your common room is freaky and I don't know which bed belonged to Crabbe and I don't want to sleep in a dead person’s bed!!” he begged with pleading eyes, a slim hand grabbing the wrist Draco was pushing Potter off with, leaving him no means of escape. He jerked his hand back but Potter only held him harder, green eyes filled with determination “I don't want to sleep on the floor Malfoy please.” He wanted to struggle, he really did, but something in him softened, remembering those lonely nights at the manor, small feet tapping on the marble floor as he made his way to his parents room, sobbing to his mother after having a hideous nightmare, and how soothing it was so sleep besides her, feeling safe thanks to her warmth. Before he knew it, a sigh left his lips and he was already falling back into his pillow, shifting slightly to make room “fine just shut up.” He growled, pulling the covers over himself.
in the middle of breakfast wasn't helpful, Draco understood that he's the only one seeing them, hearing his footsteps loudly echoing through the hall, he stopped, surroundings himself with uncomfortable silence.
Startled awake Draco called out frustratedly “wha- wait a second-” he stumbled at the door exit, groaning before going back to grab the - not to be dramatic-
He snuggled up in his bedsheets, enjoying the well missed warmth. Closing his eyes shut he was ready for dreams to overtake him, he didn't hear any rustles from Potter's side of the room, which was weird, maybe he's a very still sleeper. Burying his head into the pillow he could feel himself drifting into sleep before he felt a firm hand on his shoulder. “Draco.” Potter's voice said through the darkness, and Draco my or may not have released a very loud screech. He snapped his eyes open, jumping up quickly up his bed so now he was almost falling off, his eyes got used to the darkness already so he could clearly see Potter
Merlin, now he was all un-Draco like, apologizing? He would've never even thought about that, clueless of what to do, he wandered around the castle hoping that if he goes far enough those creatures won't follow him, with quick pace he turned around every corner, groaning when he found an another set of dark blobs already waiting for him there
He flopped down next to Pansy, too focused on the creature in front of him to care about Pansy's complaints.
the art this chapter was made by my wonderful friend @ugh_ghost_account on Instagram! you should definitely check her out <3
And a part of Harry felt like he was slipping, just for a moment. Right through his fingers. A drifting smoke just like a Solus in bloom. For a moment Harry wished it hadn't made him as nervous as he did.
But he didn't. Instead, Draco slid off his bed silently, bare feet tapping on the cold floor as he made his way to the bathroom. Harry could see it now, how the bundle of Solus seems a bit smaller, with two of its compatriots gone the rest seems more challenging, as if they're ready to hold onto Draco until his death, keeping the boy from letting them bloom.
Boy do I love disappearing for a year and then coming back with a chapter, sorry guys. This has been the hardest year of my life, I went and I’m  still going through so much changes. I write  this fanfic to cheer myself up, as twisted as it may seem with the amount of angst and existential crisis this fic provides.
Behind him, Death Eaters flew in like a swarm of snakes. Their venom deadly, spells swarming of fang like wands, killing him.
“ But all of us had seen- death..” Ginny mumbled, raw pain in her expression, Ron flinched, but nodded anyway “that's true, maybe Harry saw something that Draco had seen” the group hummed, all staring at Malfoy while slowly chewing their breakfast.
Suddenly, as if Harry had been apperated someplace new Draco shoved him off him by the shoulder, his eyes terrified. Something changed, Harry could feel it in the air the moment their lip parted, as if the air mixed itself with tarl, making it hard to breathe.
A cling of glass rang softly, Harry and his friends turned around to the source of this voice, McGonagall, their old friend yet new headmistress, was standing with a glass in her hand and a little fork in the other, she looked so out of place when Dumbledore is not besides her, but she continued his legacy, now standing proud in front of all the damaged students, and it's her job to fix them.
Thus he decided to help him, he decided to try, so he won't repeat his previous headmaster's mistake, he won't let an another broken child slip away like that.
He should try again, Luna's speech gave him a hint, these Solus do appear for a reason, if he can find why, getting rid of them should be easy right? Malfoy may be frustrated now, but he will be calmer soon, and Harry will approach him, offer him help again as many times as he can until the prideful Slytherin gives in, Harry dealt with difficult people before and if he managed to give Kreacher in, he could win Malfoy over easily.
“This man was Snape.”  Draco's heart skipped a beat from the sound of this name, sandness overflowing him, he truly missed Snape, usually his support was there for all the Slytherin students, even though he was kind of an ass to everyone else.
“Spirits?” Hermione skipped through the green grass, her bushy hair bouncing as she walks, Harry nodded, his gaze locked on the familiar hut in sight “I think so, after looking more closely, they're definitely slightly see through”
But this time nothing seemed to work out, weight, unwanted burden made his movements tense, cutting uneven pieces, burning some parts, Draco found it hard to concentrate with the glares at his nape, why won't it work out? at some point he snapped, pushing the cauldron off hsi table, shattered pieces flying everywhere brought shocked gasps, everyone were looking at him, Draco’s shoulders rising and dropping as he breathed heavily staring intensely at the mess he made.
somehow” he rolled his eyes dramatically but the eyes looking back at Harry were amused, which is much better than their heartbroken version, didn't change the fact that Harry was fuming though.  “So you just abused my trust like that?! Throwing me into the black lake?!”
“Nice earrings” Harry caught himself saying, “Thanks!” Luna smiled at him softly “they are made of a first year's broken glasses” now when he looks at them, he does notice a thin frame around the glass pieces “oh.” He gaped, poor student.
What? It was past lunch already? Draco really lost the flow of time, nevertheless it was a clear explanation of Longbottoms actions, Draco was still confused as hell
"He does?" His eyebrows shot up, he wished he didn't react this way. Since his best friend bursted into a fit of hysterical laughter. "Merlin Harry you're thick, are you? When you're not staring at him for once, the bloke sends you very subtle, but curious glances. It's more of a circus really." Draco looks at him, was all Harry could hear or care about. "..huh" he said, holding his tie between his fingers, his gaze lingering there. "You have it so, so bad Harry" he groaned, falling back on his back dramatically. "Better skip this morning, or else you won't keep it in your pants and start snogging in the middle of the classroom."
He looked down at his slice of pie, and then looked up at her, remembering his previous conversation with Neville. “Hermione I'm sorry, I really am.” he blurted out, and she froze, staring at a slice of her own, a small but honest smile curling up on her lips, her brown eyes sad but knowing “I know.” She said, taking a fork and digging in into it, chewing as if trying to keep herself from speaking. Did it work? He really had meant it, even though he didn't say much, his gaze fell to the pie on the counter, noticing a Solus standing there all alone, it's while eyes reflecting his figure looking back at it, holding his plate, little cracks appearing on it's long form. This one didn't have ears, more like a sharp pair of horns and a short tail, though it didn't happen yet, it clearly was about to bloom, with orange light clearly seeping in through it's black fur. It then turned, jumping off the counter and walked casually towards the exit, then stopped and turned to look at him, waiting.
After yesterday's events the eighth year Slytherins decided not to attend the sorting ceremony, instead they all stuck together to Draco taking him to the hospital wing to check that his nose is not broken, they knew that attending Hogwarts will be dangerous with their dark past, and Draco was glad his friends were there besides him, they made the whole situation a kind of a joke, handing Draco a galleon each time someone called them trash, he would then put it in a cup, maybe all this money will buy them a couple of butterbeers to chug down all the bitterness their fellow classmates had for them.
“You looked really hurt, so I thought I'd grab you something” Longbottom murmured, dropping a wrapped up piece in his hands, Draco stared at it thunderstruck, his eyes moving back to the Gryffindor boy “what the fuck?” He whimpered, his voice broken and raspy “just eat it.” The Gryffindor sounded colder than he looked, his expression slightly uncomfortable, yet eyes warm and worrying
This is a softer one, it was hard to write after the piano scene since I'm so proud of that one, hope I won't disappoint!!!
But seeing him now, curled up in such a pathetic state, Malfoy’s shaking figure made Harry's heart ache. Malfoy looked like he was in a lot of pain, which wasn't a physical thing, it looked like the blond was tearing up from the inside, only his Hogwarts robes keeping him in tact. The Solus were only the frosting of a fucked up cake, all on top of him, biting and nagging him, as if he wasn't through enough pain.
“Mr. Malfoy?” Slughorn's eyes were the biggest, cutting through the darkness, making the flashy light even scarier, he didn’t notice the man’s heavy hand on his shoulder which should be a calming gesture, but for Draco nothing was calming now, everything was dead weight- weight- just take off that horrible weight!!
What could bring them so much pain? He wondered, hating his hero instincts for checking it out, opening the door slowly , a similar scene revealed itself before Harry: Draco Malfoy curled up, crying on the floor
“Not everyone are as kind as McGonagall” he muttered, his breath leaving warm fog on the cool window “don't say that, Pansy will be attending too, you won't leave her won't you?” Her soft voice had a stern edge to it, not that there were any reasons to scold Draco, no matter how much he complains, he will be returning to Hogwarts this year anyway.
“I- I almost killed Dumbledore I- I let death eaters inside of Hogwarts!” His words escaped quicker than he thought about them, feeling the weight increasing on his back
And they have a dirty history together, unresolved rivalry that never died down, when Malfoy wasn't sending hexed in his direction, he was cursing and shaming him with everything he got, using any given chance to knock Harry down
soft click of the door Draco sighed, leaning against the wood. His cheek hurt from smiling so much, he couldn't believe he's done it. He went and kissed Potter, and got everything he wanted and more in return. He wanted to scream, to sing, to run across the Quidditch pitch like a lovesick fool. Pansy would tease him, Blaise would straight up laugh. But what could he do? He was happy, and he was smitten. No matter how stupid it was.
His eyes drifted to the boy walking next to him, Potter had removed his tie, twisting it in his hands to get some water out, what a muggle thing to do, he could simply use a spell for that yet he didn't. As a drop of water slid down his nape, making him shiver, Draco knew he was as stupid as Potter was, for not drying himself that is. But something about walking together at night, completely soaked up like total idiots was surprisingly magical in his opinion, so special he'd stay wet and shivering as long as it means he won't ruin it.
"So you're into smooching terrible people, Draco?" Harry teased, quick steps catching up to Draco's long strides, damn his ridiculously lean legs. "You know what I'm into?" Draco turned abruptly, making Harry's stupid, stupid heart leap in his chest. He almost nodded, almost nodded enthusiastically up until Draco grinned, saying. "Peace and quiet. Which you're currently disturbing." Harry froze, frowning. If his hands weren't occupied by heavy books right now he would've shoved him, maybe he should've just thrown them at his face and left. "I can be quiet." He blurted instead, satisfied with how blond eyebrows quirked up with interest. "If my mouth is occupied." Harry said, surprised how easy said words left his mouth, damn. Malfoy froze, his eyes widening just a fraction before he rolled them, pale cheeks useless against his evident blush. "Seems like you're a little bit obsessed with our fling there, Potter. If I didn't know you better I'd assume you're right after your first kiss." He grumbled, cold tone contrasting against the pink of his cheeks. Touchè.
Sitting down in the Slytherin table, Pansy still ignored him by chatting with Blaise instead, she had all the right to be mad, he thought.
I know I'm jumping between humor and angst but that's what I like, I feel like this fanfic is really bittersweet and kind of real? For my feelings at least.
begged Malfoy to let him in his bed.  Should he wake him up? Would that be rude? On the other hand, Draco was sleeping so soundly, he remembered how he caught the boy sleeping when they were brewing a potion together, there's something so soft about him like this, with all of his guards down and his cheek squished against his chest. It's like he fits there, to snuggle up against him- wait. He shook his head, feeling a blush creeping up his cheeks, was that weird to think about Malfoy in that way? He is his rival! Well, not anymore, but they  just became friends, and friends shouldn't fantasize about each other. Tearing his eyes off the blond forcefully Harry looked around the room,with the night gone and a soft sunlight creeping in he could definitely see a comfort in living here, green patterns on the beds fitting just right with the green-ish water seen through the round window, while feeling cozy and secure, it will never be as comfortable as the Gryffindor common room is.
“You can come out you know,” she said, her voice airy and light. “There’s no need to be afraid.” She didn’t look at him, keeping her focus on the rope.
“But you don’t anymore,” Neville said excitedly. “Come Harry, I’m sure everyone will be happy to finally see you again.” He grabbed Harry’s wrist and pulled him off the doctor’s bed and in the direction of the door.
Harry softly took Dorian’s hand into his and as he sung along to the swelling music, Dorian wrapped his hand tightly around Harry’s as if trying to imprint the feeling into his mind.
The sun painted the sky in beautiful colours, the soft breeze circling around Harry, making the temperature pleasant even with all the clothes he was wearing. And even though he was stuck on a ship filled to the brim with
“Harry! You’re awake! The Captain will be so excited to hear this!” Neville’s voice was filled to the brim with utter excitement.
Harry walked among the buildings, he made sure that his sleeves covered his scars before he left the ship, he couldn’t have the cycle of someone seeing his true self repeating again. It would be too dangerous. Harry kept mostly to the busiest streets, going into narrow deserted alleyways was a recipe for disaster, especially if you were him and a simple shove of his sleeve could cause him to be in grave danger.
Before Harry could properly retort, Luna spoke up: her voice always soft, barely audible above a whisper, but oh so strangely powerful, demanding all attention, it was eerie really. “Oh, so that’s why you were so nervous today, now I get it!”
It was only when a man’s wide eyes got stuck on Harry’s arm, that Harry noticed that his sleeve was the tiniest bit rolled upward, revealing something that he had purposely hidden. Revealing something that betrayed him and everything that he was capable of.
“Yet I am trapped on this ship aren’t I?” Harry asked, exhausted, he realised he was done, he didn’t want to go from one prison to the next, he would rather be eaten by sharks at this point.
: all consideration gone, replaced by a cold stare, the distant look was a look Harry knew all too well on the Captain’s face. Harry hadn’t even realised that the hard look had been off his face for a while now until it was suddenly back up.
As Harry looked at where the tall man had disappeared, he saw that the skies had grown dark, despite it being afternoon.
Harry opened his eyes and screamed: there were flames everywhere, while the people in black robes were nowhere to be seen. Slowly, a man,
Far away a scream could be heard, it was a voice that Harry recognised vaguely, but not enough to name it. The tone was desperate, yet even though Harry had heard plenty of desperate, devastated tones he hadn’t heard one quite like this before. The voice screamed a name. A name that seemed to be so familiar to Harry that the edges of his mind were trying to grasp it.
Thanks for reading ! I have exams this week and a part of next week so I might not be able to post as much as I usually would, next to that my betas are having issues planning, so it might take a bit longer to upload, but I
“Harry! Mate!” Ron called out from where he was standing. Harry grinned at him and walked over, trying to push all unease about the Captain aside.
Harry slowly stood up, not finding the power within himself to reply: his head was spinning, and his mind felt foggy. He didn’t understand what had happened, at all. Who was that man that kept showing up in his head?
“Come back if you need anything,” Pansy called from behind, not bothering to follow them. “And do stop by later, I still need to take your temperature.”
"Nice try." Blaise grinned. "Loony! Can you teach Potter to fight?!" He rolled his eyes at Harry's apparent frown. "Listen lightning boy, you might be able to control the merits of storm, but you can't always use it, it's too noticeable. If we're ever attacked while you're…" Blaise paused to make some wild hand gestures at Harry, his blade swinging from his fingertips. " …present, you will need to use sword fighting first before your thunder, we can't have news spreading that you're here."
They stopped at a small wooden door, a door that Harry had walked past before, but never had paid much head to. The door had a square of orange stained glass above, letting Harry see the mere shadows of what was lurking behind.
Harry swung his sword forward for what seemed like the millionth time, and he wanted to wince when he saw Luna’s expression morph into something slightly sadder.
Nigel ran towards him, out of breath and panting. “I ran all the way here from the dungeons,” he breathed.
Luna nodded and diverted her glare to look back at the sea, she looked even more distracted than usual; her brows arched.
A breath, a burning city, one man slowly arose from the flames: the skin on his face was pale and his nose seemed to have burned off, leaving only two gaping holes in his face to breath through.
Harry barely had time to prepare before Blaise suddenly latched out, his lean blade missing Harry’s face by a hair's breadth. When Blaise lashed out again, Harry clumsily held his sword up to his face as his only defense, the harsh clank of metal against metal echoing through the light night air.
Harry had, in a haze, moved to the main deck and immediately spotted Luna and Ron talking: he couldn’t quite help but think of the Captain spitting Ron’s nickname out as if it was a foul curse and yet again Harry wondered exactly
Truthfully speaking, both masks were beautiful, but naturally neither of them was ever going to admit it, this was a matter of principle.
Ron put on a playful look. “No,” he said as he put the back of his hand in front of his forehead as a fake dramatic gesture of distress. “Please don’t, not the
“Who in the name of everything wicked left the gangway unfolded?!” A voice laced in a thick posh British accent sounded from above, immediately waking Harry’s fear once again.
He heard the dreaded sound of someone coming down the stairs and with every light step Harry’s heart seemed to leap, trying to run away from his chest.
Harry let go of Dorian in surprise as he looked at everyone around him bursting into laughter and excited dances. He let out a loud, surprised laugh, breathing in the exhilarated atmosphere in the room, next to him he caught Dorian’s grey eyes looking at him in wonder as if in awe because of Harry’s
“What you experienced,” a voice said, the crew splitting like the red sea to let the person who had spoken through. “was very much a near death experience.” Harry had expected that it had been the Captain speaking, but instead it was Blaise, his voice serious and dangerous in a way that Harry hadn’t heard from him before. “And contrary to popular belief: we
Blaise looked at the way Harry had wrapped his fingers around the hilt of his newfound blade and his smile widened, covering practically half of his face in a toothy grin.
exactly was on the black piece of cloth, but it was clearly a pirate flag nonetheless. He cast his gaze down again and pinched the bridge of his nose tiredly, wondering when it was all going to simply stop.
Lavender arched one perfectly tamed brow, all the while still ignoring Ron, who was groaning and plucking at his robes beside her. “Well they better hurry up then, you’ve got to dance soon.”
He was pondering this over as he was making his way back to the Gryffindor common room, he had purposely taken a long route back, not ready to face his housemates just yet. The Yule ball was a masquerade ball this year and practically all of his housemates - with the exception of Ron that is - already had a partner
Neville had already closed the door behind them and was rambling about where they’d be going next, seemingly in such a good mood that Harry didn’t have the heart to stop him. “We’ll be arriving at Robards soon, so you woke up just in time. Robards has this-”
He spotted the Captain: grey eyes, sunkissed hair, arched brows and an expression that was strangely close to concern.
Blaise withdrew his lean blade before he immediately rushed to attack Harry again, Harry barely fended him off, clearly not knowing what he was doing, but trying anyway. He lashed out at Blaise once he withdrew his blade yet again, but unfortunately he fended him off with ease.
“Well,” Harry said as he leaned in very close. “that’s settled then, let’s just see where this goes, we don’t have to put any labels on this, and we still have a
"Why does it look like it's aiming for us?!" the dark man, that the Captain had called Blaise, cried out.
“Call me whatever you want,” the stranger said, his tone still soft, shy almost. The man was seemingly more comfortable hiding behind his mask.
There was a ship with its gangway out in the open, ready to be walked on, ready for people to enter the ship.
This was when Harry was reminded of the deal he’d made with Blaise: he would leave the ship today, and exchange the seas for the land once again. Somehow something that he’d been so sure of just two weeks ago now seemed a bit hollow. The people of the Amortentia had treated him almost like an equal, not like someone that needed to be chased down or trapped and that was strange to say the least, yet, he knew that he wasn’t and never would be a
“I slept?” Harry asked, genuinely confused. He hadn’t slept in ages, especially not in times like these, times when he wasn’t extremely exhausted.
“It’s all mechanics Potter, no need to worry, you’re still the only one with powers here,” Pansy said bitterly, but also with a slight hint of wonder in her voice, as if she couldn’t quite grasp that he was here, but refused to give up her permanently annoyed aura.
It was almost as if the pirates themselves had accepted Harry to be part of the crew already, seemingly not even remembering that Harry had made a deal with Blaise to get off at the next harbour, coincidentally the harbour of Valencia.
Eduardo showed him how to do simple cooking tasks and made him cut and stack the vegetables, before telling Harry to throw them into a large pot. The kitchen was hot: steam coming from the pans, combined with the pressing warmth from outside; the temperature was almost unbearable, sweat beading on Harry’s forehead as he was cutting what seemed like his hundredth batch of vegetables.
"He uses the lightning to kill?" Harry asked, affronted: he had never met any storm that was eager to kill, ever, and he couldn't quite imagine the lightning willingly killing someone. With Harry knowing what destruction the lightning could bring, not only to others but himself as well anger flared within him, combining with the shock of finding out there was someone like him
“You should honor your own rules,” Harry said before quickly whisking his own blade upward, deflecting the Captain’s sword away from his chest, instead Harry now had his sword pointed at the
your arm, pretend like it has been there just as long as your lightning has. I know it’s hard, but please try.”
Harry nodded again and took the plate, walking out the door of the kitchen and onto the quarterdeck. The stars were out already, shimmering brightly, an early spring breeze whirled around Harry, making his hair even more messy than it usually was. It couldn’t be later than seven in the evening, yet the night looked as if it was midnight. Calmly Harry finished his food, thinking the past two days over in his head.
Em, being so passionate about something that you want to fight to achieve it, that’s the art behind sword fighting, nothing more nothing less. You’ll learn to grasp that feeling sooner or later, today is just not that day and that’s fine.” Both her smile and voice were completely devoid of judgement, reflecting an utter confidence that Harry
Harry turned towards him, not trusting Blaise to make just small talk with him. Blaise wasn’t the small talky sort of person.
“What about him?” Harry asked, indicating the blonde haired Captain, he had barely been in any of Ron’s funny adventure stories. The captain was currently standing next to Blaise, his hair shining in the sunlight and a frown gracing his features.
Harry didn’t bother taking his eyes off the map to come up with a witty reply, instead his eyes seemed to be glued to the thing, one question moving to the forefront of his mind. “What is it?”
Harry lightly took her hand and she pulled him upwards, supporting him when his muscles still refused to move. Luna had the rope in her other hand, but her knife was now tucked away in her belt. She was using the hand she had used for wielding the knife to hold Harry up, until his legs regained their ability to move.
Harry arched a brow in confusion and Eduardo took notice, his smile growing a bit wider. “You really don’t look like you want a pirate's company right now. If I may be so blunt, you kind of look like
Luna, however, seemed unaffected as she moved to give the rope to a tall man, who immediately after he'd received the rope began climbing up towards the crow's nest that was seated on top of the main mast.
The Captain frowned and for some reason shot a worried look in Harry’s direction. “You should’ve told me earlier.”
As Harry looked at the Captain for a second he saw that a frown had formed on his face, creasing his eyebrows. The Captain gave no further reply though, and as their conversation died down the first light of day started showing.
Harry shied away from Luna's touch, remembering all too clearly what others had done to him after inspecting him like that.
Harry did just that as he leaned forward, the thought of tasting random food handed to you by a stranger being somewhat dangerous not even crossing his mind. His senses were overwhelmed as soon as his lips touched the soup, the soft taste of the tomato combined with the sharp taste of the herbs made for an amazing experience on his taste buds. "It's good!" Harry said excitedly as he finished the spoon that Eduardo had given him.
The other was tall and lanky, and there was great status and wisdom in his stance. His eyes looked like storm clouds, and they were swarming with pride. His pale hands rested on a delicate cane, and he looked like safety, he looked like home.
“Please” Potter said, treating him like some kind of a small animal. Draco didn't want to, he won't show it even if he'll be begged to. “It's proof that he's dead.”  His gray eyes shot open quickly, widening as he met Harry's gaze. The eyes that once were only looking at Draco with pure hate, the same look he'd give the dark lord, they were soft now, pleading, asking for permission. Just like him, Potter had been afraid. He needs proof that the person that ruined his life is really dead, and Draco, as foolish as it is, gave up for him.
Harry adored this softness, craved it. So he claimed it. Pulling him back into his embrace, his tongue exploring Draco's warmth hungrily, like yesterday wasn't enough. Like his whole life he'd been drowning in water and now he was breathing him. His smell, his hair, the press of his hipbone against Harry's hip. Draco gasped, shivering a soft breath against his cheek as Harry pulled him closer, his knee keeping him trapped against the wall, resting sturdily between his thighs.
His heart dropped to his stomach when his gaze locked with an another pair of eyes. Blaise was there, standing right next to his bed with his eyebrows quirked up and a rather cocky smirk painted on his lips. “Comfortable?” He said, his eyes glistening with amusement. Choking on air Harry immediately jerked up so violently the poor sleeping Malfoy slid right off him, awakening a bunch of sleepy (yet still hideous) Solus, who started screeching and running all over the bed.  With no time to take in the situation Harry's head turned back to the dark skinned boy “it's- I can explain!!” Harry screeched, so panicked he didn't notice a figure shifting on top of his chest. Blaise just stared, long and emotionless, as if he was knowing something Harry didn't quite catch that grasp of yet, but he didn't care, not in the moment, when he is found in the Slytherin common room in no other than Draco Malfoys bed.
“Oh don't worry about that! You're a lost case anyway you fucking moron!” Potter yelled, kicking the floor angrily before storming out of the toilet leaving Draco alone with his misery, he stared at the now empty marble floor thunderstruck, slowly his face winced in pain “fuck!!” He exclaimed, hitting his head on the wall, completely leaning on it, he opened his eyes wide staring at the high ceiling, his vision becoming blurry as tears flood his eyes, the white ceiling suddenly gained black dots Draco gazed at them and groaned “not you again” he buried his face into his knees, hugging himself, quietly sobbing as a new batch of creatures surrounded him.
Hope you liked this chaotic chapter! Is a bit more rom-comy than the rest of the fic but it had been a blast to write, I just love their dynamic as a group, I hope you do too ;3
He had been hit with a sudden cold all the air jumping out of his lungs from the surprise, it wasn't even that deep, even worse, even through his closed eyes Harry knew his forehead hit the soft ground underwater, putting his hands if front of his chest Harry pushed himself up gasping loudly. His vision was blurry, shit, his glasses must've slid off him in the water, he blindly moved his hands in the water searching for the well known circular frames, when he found them, he dragged them out of the water right on his nose. After taking a few quick breaths analyzing what hell had just happened, Harry jerked his face in Malfoy's direction “what the fuck?!” He exclaimed, trying to get on his feet only to fall back down into the cold water with a loud splash. Malfoy had the
But now more than ever, Draco really felt like being a dick actually, because it annoyed Potter, and annoying him made Draco feel better. besides, playing hard to get is way more amusing. Harry did not find this amusing however, picking up a fork he pointed it at him. “You will help me young man.” He said, trying to be intimidating but honestly Draco thought he simply looked like a joke. But something in Potter challenging him ignited a spark of interest inside him, Draco's gray eyes glistened as he leaned back on his chair smirking mischievously at him. “Make me.” He said, suddenly feeling the mood shifting to something more heavy, some sort of tension he could not get the grasp of yet, seems like Potter felt this too, since he shut his mouth tightly with his brilliant green eyes burning bright with challenge, or something else, that's a thought he should think about later.
"Was it- was it the kiss? I'm not taking it back, besides you're the one that started it so you can't just go and avoid me like that." Harry glared, noticing how the taller boy seemed smaller against his frustrated tone. "So if you are angry, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you or harass you or whatever your Slytherin brain made out of the whole ordeal-"
"Only because I'm dealing with a brat." Harry answered easily, his mood immediately lifting with the knowledge that he wasn't the source of Malfoy's discomfort. But.. if it wasn't him, what happened?
“You seem edgy” a dreamy voice woken Harry  from his daze, turning over with a jolt, Harry's surprised to realize Luna is standing right in front of him, right, the lesson ended and he was just about to leave for Herbology, not quite noticing the people on the way, Luna always delivered herself in a weird floaty manner, this time around she wore huge circular earrings made of a glass like material, reflecting Beautifully with her long blond hair picked up in a ponytail, with her wand and several quill's and feathers sticking out of her hair-band
"You will be better." Lucius was so sure, everything in his well masked expression said so, making Draco see exactly what he wanted to; pride.
Right, he and Potter are now friends, he would be embarrassed to admit how happy this actually made him, he had to throw Potter into the lake just so his stomach would stop fluttering.
“Your mother loves you.” Harry said at last, remembering how the woman defined Voldemort, lying right to his face for a mere chance to see her son, While Lucius risked his whole family for power, Narcissa Malfoy was ready to lose everything in order to keep her family safe. Draco softened at that, his shoulders relaxing slightly “I know..” he mumbled, pushing his knees tighter onto his chest, perhaps thinking about his mother alone in muggle London, well, at least that's what Hermione had told him after reading the prophet one day, telling him something about the Malfoy manor being taken away when Lucius was arrested. Harry wondered how the boy felt about that, but this wasn't his question to ask.
It left uncomfortable warmth on his right shoulder, Draco was sure he could feel little claws cling into him, so while Pansy was rambling sweet nothings, Draco dared to take a look.
as if Draco was someone worth saving, he knew what he's worth, and it's definitely not the savior of the wizarding world pitying him, stupid Potter.
"S-someone might see-" Draco whimpered, shuddering when Harry's lips busied himself with his neck. He didn't mind, didn't care even. Not with the blond making such sweet, pleading sounds. Harry's hands were curious. Running over flat chest and sharp bones, Draco was nothing but sharp edges. His cheekbones, his shoulders, Harry noted how his collarbone stuck out when he tilted his head back. And yet, Harry did not crave anything else. As if each touch melted Draco away, layer by layer until cold ice withered away to let in the warmth of spring. "H-harry-" the blond whined, his voice sending shivers down Harry's spine. This was so much better than fighting, if Harry knew how soft Draco would turn from the slightest attention to his jaw Harry would've done this ages ago. "Hm..?" He allowed himself to answer, not stopping his streak of kisses on Draco's face as his lips brushed against his earlobe. "What is it?" He whispered, smirking to himself when the blond whined above him. "N-now I get how you Gryffindors keep getting into so much trouble." Draco murmured, tilting his head to give Harry more access to his throat, hm. "Gryffindors? Dare I remind you that you're the one who kissed me right in front of the Slytherin common room yesterday, so if anything. Whatever this is, is totally your fault."
Thank you guys for the patience, especially the ones who keep up with me no matter the waiting time, it means a lot.
Harry never thought he would be coming back to Hogwarts, not after Voldemort, not after last year, yet he found himself marching down the familiar corridors anyway, with Ron and Hermione at his side, he now knew, that even after defeating Voldemort, thinking about an another stressing year at school seemed just as scary
And it seems like Malfoy was tired of it too, or perhaps he simply didn't dare to approach Harry after what he did, Malfoy may be a coward, but he has a brain.
Running his eyes around the great hall, Draco's gaze locked on a messy curly hair surrounded by two annoying redhead and a literal bush of hair- Harry Potter.

“just leave me alone!” Draco snapped, slapping her hand away, she pulled back her face curling into pure anger
They battered a nice pie tray and Hermione did the rest, rolling out the dough and pouring in the surprisingly liquidy apple mix, cutting the dough into thin striped and knitting them into a some kind of confusing pattern on top of the pie, it did make it look a tad prettier though. Now they were seated on an elf size sofa, all eagerly staring at their baking masterpiece, filling the room with a deliciously sweet scent. They had made two batches( which Hermione definitely did in purpose so he would suffer more than he already did) one pie for them and the other as a thank you for the house elves that, by Hermione's words 'so kindly let them use their kitchen’. Draco couldn't understand the whole kindness towards house elves thing, these creatures kept peering at him as he might stand up and beat them. For a second he'd get angry at them, but then remember that they're not too far from the truth, since by Potter's words Dobby worked here for a while after leaving the manor, he probably told them all about the Malfoy family had done to him. Draco was perfectly aware that his father was hitting the poor elf, but if he wanted to avoid a slap, he kept his mouth shut about it, sometimes even doing it to the elf himself. He clenched his fists, staring at their pie in the making.
Previous events ran through his mind, when Potter found him in the most vulnerable state, if Draco knew better he'd guess Potter would hex him or at least call him out for old times sake, but he didn't, for he offered Draco help instead.
They broke up after the war, both understanding they were too hurt, too damaged to care about relationships right now, but this break up made a beautiful friendship bloom, and Harry was all about strong female friends.
“I was surprised too” Draco said honestly. “It looks so much like a scar.. especially now.” Potter hummed to that, his thumb rubbing his skin gently, his eyes mirrored how he was drowning in thought “have you ever thought about covering it up?”  Potter said, and Draco actually laughed. “A tattoo made by the Dark Lord himself? No magic could remove such evil, also, I'm covering it up the whole year. You know how hot it is to wear long sleeves during summer?”
Draco had mixed feelings about Minerva McGonagall, but she brought him back, so he should be grateful? He wasn't sure anymore
It looked like someone casted a spell on him at first, since the floor had absolutely nothing to trip on, but a glimpse of black mass caught Harry's attention, that thing was tugging Malfoy’s leg and Parkinson didn't seem to notice it, Harry blinked a couple of times and frowned, the creature was gone, weird, with laugh echoing through the hall Draco stumbled to get up,shooting everyone an angry yet defeated glare, pulling his robe up and leaving the hall running.
“Once, he took in a broken man, a wrong man for many, and yet, he took him, gave him an another chance..”  after a  pause, she went on
“Look how far they are” Harry didn't look at her, so she shifted her gaze to look in the same direction, eyes locking on the small green pack, she stared for a long minute before sighing, her face visibly softened when she turned back to Harry “you think it's the creatures?”
Draco stared back at himself,he was flooding, drowning in dismay with each tear sliding down his worn out face, when did he start crying? Putting his hands down onto the sink in hope to keep himself stable, he crumbled down with the weight on his shoulder, desperately holding onto the sink while his body was curled up on the floor, loud cries echoing through the room, he hated this, these forsaken walls, those people who looked like they knew him, he hated himself, wheezing and screaming in the bathroom that was way too familiar, only two years ago he was here, crying, scared for his life, turns out nothing changed much, since he was still falling apart on the same cold floor, when each day feels like stepping on sharp needless tearing his pale skin apart revealing dark, cruel red, with a shaky hand he grabbed his sleeve and lifted it, revealing his ugly death mark, he hated this mark the most.
“Why are you asking Harry?” Ginny poked his cheek, smiling softly “I can see a black creature bullying him” Harry said, making his friends turn and stare in Malfoy's direction shamelessly, after all they've been through they knew better than to call Harry a madman  for seeing things only he could see
Draco might've been a complete coward, but he didn't kill anyone, not even Harry, when he had the chance to.
“Language, Mr. Malfoy” a stern voice behind him made Draco freeze, slowly turning his head, he smiled awkwardly to McGonagall.
reached her office, Draco moaned with delight as he dropped those bloody books on the dark wooden table, looking at his poor beautiful hands dramatically when he noticed how red they became, this was absolute torture, McGonagall is an evil woman.
“ Have you seen the glares?” Pansy smirked at them, her voice having a pained ting to it,her dark eyes showing what they all felt,alone,and most definitely tired,they know they deserve such treatment but Pansy had a weak heart, she may be able to bully others but can’t handle bullying herself,  “how could we miss it?” Draco flopped into the chair besides her, using that moment to push off the creature on his shoulder, reaching to grab some toast, the creature didn't like this treatment much and jumped on Draco's hand and scratched it “fuck!” He yelled, failing to yank his hand away since the creature now went for his toast, pulling it from his hand, the other black blob beings pulled at his hair or ruffled his collar, all bugging him “let go of me!” He managed to pull his toast away from the beast's teeth, throwing the toast at his plate angrily, not that he could  eat it now.
Without saying anything else, McGonagall strode down the hall for Draco to follow, he stumbled behind the graceful woman, creatures pulling down his pants with their weight, thank Merlin he's wearing a belt.
Suddenly he felt himself bump painfully into a hard surface, groaning loudly Draco stepped back only to see Neville Longbottom standing right in front of him, great, just what he needed to get more annoyed
The Solus hissed, biting down on Draco's nape as he blinked, shooting back to his senses. He blinked, realizing that he was still in the dungeons. His knees throbbing against the hard stone floor. In front of him, there was his father's letter. Torn to tiny little pieces. His father's only chance of freedom discarded by his own son, his last hope. The shaking returned, together with a nasty burn at the back of his eyes. Draco doesn't realize he's crying until a tear falls onto his father's neat handwriting, messing the ink.
“I thought that- that it would soothe him too..” Malfoy's voice turned quieter, and Harry needed no explanation to know who he was talking about. Vincent Crabbe had died in horrible flames, his screams still visiting him in his dreams, Harry was the one to fly Malfoy out of that place, only to follow him back inside a year later.
"I see.” She said, her tone cold “I guess there's no choice then.” Something inside him told Draco that this is not going to end well, he'd been hanging out with Hermione for two months or so, and even he knew that when she had ideas it's either genius or the worst thing that has ever to you, so it is only natural that he automatically said: “no.”
Were they heavy? Could Malfoy deal with them? Not that Harry cared about Malfoy in particular, he'd rather not associate with him at all, he's a death eater, a criminal, but Harry found out that he didn't have the urge to hit him like the others did, he found that he doesn't hate Draco Malfoy, when did it start? When Harry stopped being utterly annoyed by his presence? No, he was definitely still annoyed, but Draco didn't bother him as much anymore, after the war Harry matured, he had no patience for rival games anymore
Before Draco knew it a gasp left his throat, he just stared at Potter, wide eyed filled with utter disbelief “help me-?” He whispered “help me?!” Potter stepped back from Draco's sudden yell, he couldn't believe it! Absolutely couldn't process it, Potter? Helping him? This is some kind of a joke! His blood was boiling feeling every nerve in his body completely snapping “I don't need your help!!” Draco spat at him, noticing Potter's anger raising under those stupid circular glasses, finally, a Potter he was used to.
But what could he see that only Malfoy saw? that thought followed Harry through his day, maybe it was his thirst for mystery, but Harry found himself staring at Malfoy during magical history, this time there were three, one black creature sitting on his shoulder, the second one on his head, and the third one- the cat like black blob that has been attached to him the longest, has been nagging his hand, just them being there felt pretty annoying,he wondered how Malfoy hadn’t snapped already.
"You will not let go of this stupid kiss huh." Draco groaned, Harry grinned knowing he rolled his eyes just now. "Nope." Green met gray as they glared at one another, Draco sighing softly. "you are a sore loser." Before cupping his cheeks and pulling him back into a kiss. Merlin, he was just as smitten as Harry is. It was clear in his eyes, so why must Draco always get the upper hand? He cannot lose to him. Not even in this. So keeping his lips occupied his hands roamed, sliding from his shoulder down to his ribcage, smirking when the blond whimpered against his lips. He was so sensitive. So delicious. This feat will surely be explored later, when they will have a little bit more privacy. But for now Harry used what he could reach for, meaning that Draco's lower back is to be thoroughly explored. Untucking Draco's button up Harry's hand snuck past the fabric until he met soft skin, running his fingers over it as the blond gasped sharply, breaking the kiss momentarily before pulling him back in. His back was smooth and oh so warm, Harry could probably melt into him if he kept this any longer. His hand slid down slowly like candle wax until it met the coarse fabric of Draco's pants and before he knew it he was squeezing Draco's arse, some kind of paper crunching beneath his palm.
I BEEN WAITING TO WRITE THIS CHAPTER FOR BLOODY TWO YEARS!!! TWO YEARS OF MY LIFE FOR THESE FOOLS TO FINALLY KISS OH MY GOD.
“I do too, my father as well.” He said, not really knowing why is he being so honest in this situation. It became quiet after that, Neville sobbed but made no effort to push Draco away from him, and he didn't leave, just sitting the in the heavy silence, finally deciding to break it. “Look, I know you could never forgive me, and I don't expect you to.”
“Dumbledore, was one of the most amazing wizards to set foot in this world, especially this school, he truly was, a marvelous man” McGonagall finished her cup, placing it on the table “and he was incredibly forgiving, for those who wanted a chance.” Draco frowned at her, what does Dumbledore have to do with this? The bloke is dead, and it's Draco's fault.
“Ugh- fine I'll think about it it.. or something.” He exclaimed, yanking his arm from Potter's grasp and turning over so his back would face the git, he pulled his covers back over himself, his cheeks heating up in a very much annoying manner.
Even visiting the room of requirement again was surreal, he couldn't go near there through the whole year but only now, with Potter by his side, he felt like he got the courage, which is totally stupid, since Potter was angry at him at the moment and yet he still followed him there, even comforted him for fucks sake.
Malfoy got up slowly and Parkinson jumped to his side in panic crying quick words Harry couldn't overhear, Draco nodded at her and made his way to the exit, suddenly tripping and falling
There was always something in Luna's demeanor that made her presence so calming, she spoke in an airy dreamy-like voice, always soft, always collected, she was safe to speak to
“It's okay for you to get help" he recalled Snape's words in his head as he made his way through the great hall, eyes, eyes around him all staring, making him feel so small- but he went on, determined, doing his best to ignore the burdening weight on his back constantly pulling him backwards
And with a soft light, the parchment weaved itself back together until it was whole again. Without thinking he threw his wand aside, yanking the parchment and reading through it again.
this method, it's just too cruel. Experiencing your trauma all over again only for a slight chance for the Solus to disappear, Harry would rather carry that weight for the rest of his life than to try and get rid of them in that way. “Revelio? No.” Malfoy shook his head, his broken expression turning serious. “The moment I heard her say it I decided I will never try to cast it on them.” he shot the Solus on Harry's body a quick glance, his hands clenched into tight fists. “
To his relief, Malfoy had enough mercy stored in him to lift off the creature just in time when Harry started seeing white, he gasped loudly taking a deep breath as if he'd just been underwater. Malfoy had been glaring at him with glossy eyes, one Solus held tightly between his hands while his chest rose and fell quickly, Harry could hear every quick breath the blond boy takes, perhaps because he's practically wheezing air in and out of his lungs, or because he nearly got fucking
“Are you free, Mr. Malfoy?” She asked, her expression unreadable, it seems like she didn't notice Draco talking to the creatures, which is good, he wouldn't want to explain why he was talking to himself to an already sceptical headmistress. He nodded, not saying anything, fixating his gaze on her pointy heels instead, somehow it's hard to face her, like he knows he's done something bad
