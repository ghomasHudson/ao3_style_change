“The first – right.” A small crease appeared between Harry’s brows, just for a moment before it vanished as he shook his head. “Right, that’s – a bit earlier than I – right. Ok then. Have to admit I feel like a bit of a prat now.” Harry lifted a hand to the back of his neck, scrubbed it through his hair. “I also told you – ah, some things that were –“
Draco picked up his phone and unlocked it, chewing on the tip of his thumb as he opened his messages and started to type.

Well, Draco hadn’t been expecting that at all.

And he can definitely feel Malfoy smiling against his skin, can hear the quiet, pleased sound Harry’s words have elicited. Malfoy backs off just enough that Harry lets out an embarrassingly loud whimper at the loss of him. He fists his hands in the red jumper so Malfoy knows not to back off any further.
No. That couldn’t be right. Except for the fact that it was.

“Duty calls,” Potter murmured, stepping away.

Thoughts of Malfoy’s not-unattractiveness need to stay buried in the recesses of Harry’s mind though, along with the shoulder-bumps and the soft smiles and the coffee visits and that one time he made Malfoy laugh so hard it had made Harry’s heart soar. That was the day Harry realised his feelings were more-than-friendly and more-than-purely-physical, that seeing Malfoy, being around him, had become the best part of Harry’s day. It frustrated him that he couldn’t even remember what had been so funny in the first place, because afterwards he found he wanted to make Malfoy laugh like that all the time. He remembered the way Malfoy’s head had landed on his shoulder as he shook with laughter. Harry had wanted to bury his face in the crook of Malfoy’s neck, just nuzzle against the bare skin there and breathe him in forever. Malfoy had squeezed Harry’s bicep as he’d straightened up, lifting his head, meeting his eyes as his fingers ran down the full length of Harry’s arm, lingering on the pulse point of his wrist

Draco unlocked the screen.
So, Draco and his notebook and quill are set up at a little table in the DMLE break room and each Auror he has photographed sits with him, blushing like proverbial virgins when it dawns on each and every one that Draco has seen them utterly starkers. They all leave happy enough though, grinning with both a touch of embarrassment and pride, which Draco thinks is quite sweet actually. They’re alright, the Aurors.

Malfoy presses a kiss to his lips. “Good.”

He’s relieved when they arrive at his office and he has something utterly benign to concentrate on like removing the protective wards from the door before he unlocks it.

weird. He was sure Madam Pomfrey could have sorted it out - she’d healed him quickly and efficiently after the hippogriff incident. It was quite impressive actually. He’d asked her loads of questions, after his father had gone. He told her he liked seeing how things worked, putting them back together again. Isn’t that what healers basically did? She’d laughed and said ‘more or less’. Told him to stop by for a chat any time he wanted, if he had more questions. If he wanted to learn.

Perhaps a small measure of his anger was misplaced - after all, Theo had been quite unfairly vicious (and Draco would need to deal with that sooner rather than later) but for now the person he was most cross with was himself.

Draco felt his cheeks warm up, partially hidden by his scarf. It had been an afterthought really, the hat, snatching it up and shoving it on his head, a tuft of white-blond hair poking out from beneath the burgundy knit. He hadn’t bothered to stop and look at his reflection as he’d left, letting the door swing shut behind him. He just wanted to get

So Draco had played his part, the way he suspected others were too. He pretended not to be scared. He pretended he was pleased. He was monumentally cruel on the train and hexed for his efforts. And he pretended like none of it mattered because Voldemort couldn’t be back, he couldn’t be. Potter had to have got it wrong. Something else had to have happened. He was going to go home and feel safe and his parents would explain and it would all be fine.

[21:24] No problem
Harry settles his palms on Malfoy’s thighs either side of him, runs his palms up and down the taut muscle, the fine hair there soft against his skin as his boxers are slipped off; his furiously red prick springs free and he instinctively lifts a hand towards it, but Malfoy bats him away, wrapping his pale fingers firmly around the shaft, stroking him excruciatingly slowly.

Draco thinks, shaking the thought of buying Potter presents from his mind,
“Oh.”
Potter shifted beside him, quickly digging into his pocket. “Sorry, sorry…”
Harry takes his time. He licks at the slit and under the head, strokes Malfoy’s length with his fingers and presses light, fluttery kisses to Malfoy’s hip bones and the insides of his thighs, nuzzles the blond curls at the base of his cock, breathing him in. Harry runs the tip of his tongue over the leaking end, then he’s swirling his tongue and sucking lightly on the throbbing head of Malfoy’s cock, the precome salty-bitter on his taste buds.

Harry can hear Malfoy muttering ‘well I never’ and chuckling to himself from the nook. The sound lifts some of the tension he’d been feeling, being a bit gossipy like this. It’s quite fun, and Harry sort of wants to sack off this meeting with Shacklebolt altogether and just hang out with Malfoy. Alone.
[08:41]
“You’re welcome,” Draco says, and suddenly he’s not sure what to do with himself. He’s just standing in Potter’s bedroom, still holding the omelette, watching Potter lick a stray drop of water from his upper lip.

Potter looks down at the kitchen table. It’s a lovely sturdy thing, probably a bit too big for the space but Potter skates his fingers over the walnut wood as he heads towards the french doors at the other end. They open up onto a small balcony and the view isn’t really anything, just London streets and rooftops, but it’s nice.
[12:41] Fuck off now, we’re both busy
Draco sets his jaw and continues to stare resolutely out of the window, counting how many trees and shrubs and plants he can see. He’s up to 14 when his mind wanders back to Potter’s office and the distinct lack of foliage or anything personal.

Draco decided he should probably say something, it seemed like the right sort of time after all. But he kept getting distracted by the pad of Harry’s thumb against his skin and the fact that he smelled like chocolate and bonfires so he thought
Harry gently removes his fingers and shifts closer, wrapping a hand around his cock, stroking a layer of lube up his shaft. He presses the head against Malfoy’s entrance, bends at the hip so he’s leaning over Malfoy and propping himself up so he can kiss him, so sweet, so soft.
“It was just cows.” Draco sips his wine and Potter gives him a bemused look. “At the magical animal sanctuary. It was just cows. I took photos for over two hours in a cold, wet, muddy field wearing horrible muggle wellies for completely normal, ordinary non-magical cows.”

It’s perfunctory, and when he gets a response back a few hours later he’s mostly expecting something formal in return. Not even from Potter himself but most likely an assistant, with a suggested date and time. He’s half right.

At some point he’s going to have to go home, he’s going to have to leave Potter on his own looking all soft and lovely and warm to rest and recuperate like he’s supposed to. Potter switches on the television that’s at the end of his bed on a chest of drawers and nestles back into his pillows. He’s finished the omelette, taken his potions.

When Harry lifts Malfoy higher off the pillow it changes the angle of his cock and hits Malfoy’s prostate, causing the release high-pitched whine-sob from underneath him that alarms Harry for a moment, has him take down the tempo.
Draco’s distinctly less-than-pure mind gallivanted off through a thousand Harry-related scenarios, his skin feeling tingly and flushed. As he shifted in his desk chair, he decided he might need another minute or two before going to meet Neville for dinner.

Harry hasn’t said anything in response, has just kept staring. He flicks his gaze away and notices that the label in the neck of the jumper is sticking out. He reaches up and gently pushes it back down, tucks it inside. He knows he’s letting his fingers linger too long, but Malfoy is - he’s leaning into Harry’s delicate touch, turning his body to face him so Harry leaves his hand where it is and watches the rise and fall of Malfoy’s chest as pale hands come to rest on his hips, pulling him forward.
If Harry had thought the training session was unbearable, then the rest of the afternoon is pure torture. Of course, it’s all Ron’s fault.
Draco doesn’t move away.
“It’s fine.” Potter waves the question off which is neither a yes or no. “Anyway you said it’s just five minutes away right?”
He’d been out flying when everything became horrifically clear. The sun was starting to set as he landed near the edge of the woodland, his father beckoning him over from the veranda. So he’d left the broom propped up against a tree and walked forward, not being able to think of a good enough reason not to. His father didn’t quite meet his eye, but urged Draco to follow him inside, saying things like

his arm is still pretty solidly pressed against Harry’s in a way that says...something. Maybe. Harry doesn’t know. Why hasn’t Malfoy pulled away? Should Harry? He feels like he ought to, if only for his sanity, if only to stop his heart fluttering in his chest like a trapped bird. Instead, Harry tilts the back of his hand to rest against Malfoy’s. The reaction is small: Malfoy stiffens, ever so slightly, and sucks in a breath before relaxing, his own hand pressing back against Harry’s.
Is this about your man Harry?
Ivy ignores him.

Harry barely touches a nipple with the pad of his thumb when he hears a sharp intake of breath from underneath him. He locks eyes with Malfoy and runs his thumb over the nipple again, circling around it with slow, careful consideration. Malfoy’s whole body seems to mutinously arch into Harry’s touch and he flushes, sucking his lower lip into his mouth.
Harry strokes it back with affection. “You’re so fucking beautiful. I could come just looking at you.”

Harry lowers his hands to Malfoy’s arse again, hooks an ankle around his calf and rolls his hips. He tries not to grin too much when Malfoy wobbles a bit against all three movements because he does it again, with more gusto, and then Malfoy’s on his back on the bed looking a bit startled as to how he got there. Harry surges over him, legs clamping either side of Malfoy’s hips and wrapping his hands around his wrists, pinning them to the bed.

The memory of it does nothing to calm his nerves which only seem to amplify as the doors open and he sees Malfoy standing there waiting for him. He’s still wearing Harry’s red jumper and a small soft smile that tugs at Harry’s heart.

Hair messy and ruffled, the edge of his scar that crept down to his temple only just visible under the arm of his glasses. Jumper sleeves still pushed up to his elbows showing off taut forearms and incongruously bony wrists.

The Dark Lord had returned, his father was seeking some sort of absolution and the price, it seemed, was Draco.

[20:14] What happens in your head when we meet in the tunnels
. Draco should leave. It had been an unfathomably terrible idea to come down here. He didn’t even really like hot chocolate all that much (a bald-faced lie if there ever was one). Besides, Potter was likely here for his date wasn’t he? That must be why he was here. Draco definitely didn’t want to see that (except he actually sort of did).
The office is much more boring than Draco had expected, with a normal boring desk and chair and grey filing cabinets. There’s a partition of some kind in the corner that seems to be leading to a small hidden area. Apart from the name on the door and the fact that Potter is actually
This was starting to get sad. He should go and find Neville, go to the cinema. Get popcorn. Watch the thing. 80s Sci-Fi. He slipped his own phone out of his coat pocket, unlocked it. Nothing new. He hovered over the SSPS Instant Messenger icon and then moved to the text messaging one instead.

“Usual suspects.” Draco shrugged. “The minister, obviously. Benefactors. A few celebrities.
“You’ve got to,” says Ivy, her tone coming out less like a commiserating friend and more like a strict mother admonishing a naughty child.
Behind him, Draco could hear the quick pace of Neville’s approaching footsteps; closer now, slowing down and finally coming to a stop.

Harry frowned and then, rather incongruously, huffed out a small laugh. “Um, I don’t think you understa–“

Harry breaks their kiss, breathing hard, tonguing at the spot where Malfoy bit him. He tastes copper.

There’s a shared smile that lingers a bit too long to perhaps be considered friendly but Draco knows he’d be playing a silly game with himself if he let his mind try to unravel that, so in the end he just holds his hand out for Potter’s towel.
When Harry licks a long line up and over the tiny, puckered hole Malfoy lets out a sound that is something like a whimper and groan. Harry grins and licks firmer, focusing his tongue back and forth and around Malfoy’s entrance, teasing in circles that has him shuddering.
When he finally wakes up, he’s alone, but still in the woods. He wonders how much time has passed. Hours maybe, could be minutes though. He’s lying on his back and when he opens his eyes it’s to see a dark, cloudless sky full of twinkling stars. For a moment he forgets himself and thinks of the enchanted ceiling in the great hall, the start of term feast. Blaise trying to steal potatoes off his plate for literally no good reason other than to piss Draco off.

. It was Malfoy’s contract work with the DMLE Auror Training Programme that changed things between them. The trainees and new recruits absolutely adored him and his ‘cool-as-fuck’ inventions. They always seemed to try a bit harder whenever Malfoy was present for one of Harry’s training sessions and it was difficult not to get caught up in that. Harry supposed he should’ve been a bit annoyed or jealous about this, but he decided he just couldn’t be bothered when everyone was working so hard, and especially when Malfoy bumped their shoulders together with a soft smile. Sometimes he leant into Harry for a few seconds longer than was strictly necessary to look at his clipboard or murmur his thoughts about one of the trainees in Harry’s ear. Once he’d even corrected Harry’s duelling stance, practically manhandling him into a ‘position much more suiting to a Wizarding gentleman’, and Harry couldn’t help but feel pleased by the pinkish hue to Malfoy’s skin immediately afterwards.

Draco hates the fact that it probably is. Minutely, he increases the pressure against Potter’s fucked up leg.
The Auror, who Draco remembers is actually Mr April from

So instead he just thinks about Naked Photo Fantasy Potter, who is always naked and uncomplicated, as he slowly strokes down his shaft. He’s already hard when something starts to feel a little off. Or rather, not enough. He reaches into his bedside table and pulls out a small vial of lube. He coats two fingers and shuffles awkwardly, massaging at his hole until he’s able to slip a digit inside and he pushes back against it and fuck, yes. That’s what he wanted. He slips the other finger in alongside the first and thrusts in and out, working in tandem with the other hand on his cock and his hips jolt up so that he’s fucking hard into his fist and picturing Potter’s cock. Draco licks his lips and fucks himself on his fingers faster, harder, the pressure building low and lovely in his spine.

He’s about to ask him again, seriously this time, when the bill arrives and Potter grabs it quickly, leaping out of the booth.

Dearest readers, thank you so much for your patience!
Draco’s arms have been stretched out, perpendicular to his body, bony wrists pinned to the polished rosewood ballroom floor. The movement had tugged at something, dull and achingly familiar in his right shoulder and he’d just thought: Potter.

Didn’t want to have to remind you of how when he smiled your way you turned the same shade of red as his kit
Harry doesn’t hear what he is, just hears a low guttural sound as he wraps his mouth around Malfoy’s cock and takes in as much of him as he can, loving the weight of it on his tongue, the feel of the head butting against his throat. He feels rather than sees Malfoy yank off the red jumper and flop back onto the bed, hears him release a shaky sigh as Harry starts to suck in earnest, hollowing his cheeks and curling his tongue around the head of Malfoy’s cock whenever he draws back. When he hears the tempo switch of Malfoy’s breathing he goes as deep as he keen, feeling inexplicably harder when Malfoy’s hips twitch and he fucks up into Harry’s mouth. Harry moans at the feeling, sucks harder, encouraging Malfoy to do it again. And again. And again.
You’ve become very annoying since you grew into your face
And Draco thought he saw the hint of a smile skirting over full, perfect lips.
“Thank fuck you’re here,” he’d said one night, sidling up to Draco as he stood changing the lenses on his camera.
[00:14] It’s getting there :-/

Harry licks his way back up to the base of Malfoy’s spine, presses an impossibly affectionate kiss there as he nudges for him to roll back over. He does so, and Harry can see that

The man nods once. “Very good Mr Potter.”

Draco took a deep, steadying breath that did absolutely nothing to quell his nerves. “Harry...what Theo said, I - I wasn’t messing you about, that wasn’t what I wanted. You and me...you and me, he didn’t—he has nothing to do with—I didn’t know that he would—we’re not—I just wanted it to be you and me and—“
Potter takes his tea in the exact same way he did at school; extra hot and too strong, barely a splash of milk, one sugar. Their fingers brush when Draco hands it over and they migrate to the kitchen table.
The question surprises him, but not as much as Potter’s tone; soft and interested. He’s definitely shifted closer to Draco too, there’s a warmth pressed against his right calf and he doesn’t need to look to know it’s Potter’s leg against his.

Out of the corner of his eye, he watched as Potter picked up his phone, put it down, picked it up again. His thumbs skating quickly over the screen. He put it down again. Shook his head. Picked it back up.

This is fine, he thinks. This is what a friend would do.

Malfoy doesn’t help with the boxes at all. In fact, all he does is walk silently behind Harry all the way to the DMLE training rooms, with Sebastian trotting along happily at his side, chattering away and floating the eleven boxes of peaches that Harry is fairly certain he’s been overcharged for.

Draco pulled his gloves off, shoving them down into his coat pocket before retrieving his phone. He’d felt it vibrate several times as he’d stormed off; no doubt it was Neville, firing off an array of concerned messages as he’d run after Draco. He could be quite persistent with his worrying and Draco was fairly certain those were Neville’s quick footfalls he’d heard in the distance behind him.

Malfoy just nods at Harry to lead the way, leaving Ron in their wake.

The pressure building at the base of his spine is too familiar and his hands fly to Malfoy’s hips, slowing him down but not pushing him away; Harry’s cock is achingly hard in his jeans and every drag and press against Malfoy makes him shiver with need.

“It would be just like you to spite-drink that entire thing just to piss me off.” Potter watched as Draco took another mouthful, this time drawing the spoon out much slower.
“Stop fucking about. Open his mouth, he needs to drink it all.”
[01:07] ;-)
The healers assess Potter’s leg and determine he can spend the remainder of his recuperation period at home. Two or three more days, as long as he keeps up with his regimen of healing potions and physio exercises. He’ll need to come back in for another assessment before he’s allowed to go back to work.
“Oh how wonderful for me.”
“We’ll see about that.”
what I do.” Draco smiles, because he realises how true it is and that thought makes him happy. “Working for Luna is wild and sometimes I meet some interesting people at the charity events. I’m sorry if you were expecting something deep and profound, but I do feel the need to point out that I just spent an afternoon taking pictures of twelve naked Aurors for a
I thought you forgave me for that

“You’re so…”
Draco,
Draco twisted his elbow out of Theo’s hold but didn’t leave, unsettled by the look that was creeping across his ex’s face as he looked at Harry.
You should come down, get a bit of fresh air

“My photography ‘stuff’?” Draco laughs, it’s gentle but he can see Potter’s cheeks colour a little.
[21:21] And so on, etc.

By ‘might have’ do you mean ‘definitely did and now I’ve left it too long and it feels really awkward’
And now here he was, in a stupid fucking bobble hat, frozen in place not saying a single word.

“Is that a question?”
“You said you’d stop when I got here.”
“So...what you’re saying is, you’re seeing him now?”
What do you think that means?
“Er, yeah.” Potter nodded, and grinned back at her. “Really festive. Thanks Luna, this looks incredible. Doesn’t it Draco?”
Then he’s pulling Malfoy after him out of the nook and reluctantly letting go before he opens the door.
Draco holds up two paper bags, puts them on the table before Potter. “Pierogies and potato pancakes. And some cake.”
“Meditation?”
[05:51] On the upside the coffee in Pret is rather excellent. Do people know about the coffee in Pret? Everyone bangs on about Starbucks but Pret is vastly superior.
Says he who phones his Grandmother twice a week and names all of his plants
The gnarled hand lifts, and Draco barely takes a breath before someone is pouring a potion down his throat. He chokes on it, spits a mouthful out.
[21:02] I believe we very much did not like each other in the beginning
[20:12] What do I do???
[23:13] So what happened next
Yeah okay :p except for the fact that it sounded like the most date-y non-date ever
“As I recall you beat him,” Draco says.
What?
[23:09] I believe I just did
[15:42] I have to go and meet my father for an early dinner before my flight back so I might not reply much
He must’ve been successful because Potter turned around and walked away without a backwards glance.
Malfoy shakes his head. “Just want you. So much.”
A fucking
Thanks
[20:15] You figured out the secret tunnels
“Uh…”
Harry’s smile dropped immediately, his face clouding with darkness as he glanced away, jaw tight with tension.
“More,” Malfoy gasps, his hand wrapping around his own cock and stroking up. “Harder.”
[16:18]
“Is it for religious reasons?”
Draco raised an imperious eyebrow. “Twenty minutes? That has to be a new record. You usually don’t come and find me for at
Harry arched into him, just a little. “Well, we might never have talked to each other properly if we hadn’t had this. We might never have gotten
‘not unattractive’. He’s still slender but has filled out a bit since Hogwarts, particularly in the shoulders. And his hair isn’t slicked back severely anymore but cut into a more fashionable style with a slight quiff at the front. He’s still pale, but has enough colour in his face that makes his hair almost look white. Harry knows it’s got a little natural wave to it as well that he must spell into submission. He knows because one time he popped into Malfoy’s lab to find him all flustered and annoyed with what appeared to be an inanimate golden snitch. Pink-cheeked and hair ruffled, Malfoy hadn’t seen Harry standing by the door for a full glorious minute, Harry wondering what that lovely hair would feel like if he ran a hand through it, maybe tightening his fingers a little. Would Malfoy be into that?

He should think about that later.
[20:20] Didn’t think he had it in him tbh
Harry considered him for a moment. “Why didn’t you?”
Football can be a very violent sport
[23:24] That is
if he wasn’t off his face on a cocktail of potions. Wouldn’t look at him like -
Draco opens his eyes, steals himself and looks. The bite marks are fresh and bloody, and there’s mud caked into the broken skin. It’s already starting to feel hot and itchy, like it’s infected.
[10:39] Not that I didn’t love that
Good colour on you btw
He’d be lying if he said he hadn’t thought about it a few more times since.

I don’t have an answer to that question
that had made him feel this way, he knew talking to Harry would have made him feel better. He’d listen (well, read), make him laugh, maybe flirt a little.
[09:48] You didn’t
[20:07] You’ve never actually seen these secret passages have you
“Sorry,” Harry said. “Not Neville. I can go and get him if you’d prefer?”
Which is, in Draco’s opinion, somehow
He said “nice bobble hat”
[19:35] I take it he didn’t agree
Talk to Harry today?
“Someone like Malfoy, for instance,” Ron supplies.
[20:32] I’ve got quite a lot to do and I still haven’t edited my EPQ stuff from last weekend
[22:34] Intriguing
[21:26] Do you really expect me to believe you can get me a present here tomorrow morning?
FW: Good news
What if he’s annoyed at me for ignoring him?
Which was absurd of course.
“I swear all the time when I text you.”
When the flames die down Draco is a little stunned. What he’d been expecting, or fearing -
So Harry doesn’t stop. Doesn’t stop until Malfoy clenches around him, coming all over his stomach and his fist and shouting Harry’s name.
[23:41] This is stupid, you’re an idiot
Potter shrugs. “I want to know.”
“You’re right I’m not.” Malfoy’s hand is on his jaw, his thumb skating softly over Harry’s lip.
[21:21] Not quite sure what to make of that
No he didn’t.
[13:35] She always does stuff like this on a fucking whim
“It’s lovely,” Draco says, and he means it.
Harry nods, perhaps more vigorously than necessary. “Yes,” he grits on, when Malfoy presses against him and fuck, he feels so bloody good.
Otherwise I’ll be stuck with Theo
Going to check in a minute
Draco thinks.
[22:58] Star crossed snugglers

Draco rolls his eyes. “I don’t know! I can’t think right now, with you all -” Fuck, what’s he saying? He needs to shut up immediately. “What do
. This is how Draco justifies it to himself as he brings himself off once - sometimes twice - a day imagining that beautiful cock and who it’s attached to.
[16:03] I hope your afternoon has been more productive than mine
Draco felt the crushing wave of guilt wash over him.
Glaring at his smarmy smug little face
“Alright Harry. Let me know about Will, okay?” He knows she’s trying to sound casual, but there's an undercurrent of something else in the way she speaks to him. “When you’ve figured out what you want.”
, alright? You fucking fluster me. Happy now?”
[16:07] Neville is otherwise engaged

Potter gestured to the tables closer to the window.
[19:18] Again
[13:50] Facts are facts
And then it was gone.
[19:16] People tried to talk to me, it was fucking awful
“Everything except the borscht.” Draco sits back in the booth and folds his arms as Potter glances up at him with curiosity. “It’s not quite there yet.”
but they are now a permanent fixture on Draco’s shit list. Possibly on Potter’s too as Draco catches a flash of irritation in his face, but maybe that’s wishful thinking on Draco’s part. Either way, it doesn’t change the fact that Potter is leaving.

See you in a bit
[08:54] Some knight in shining armour you are
[19:20] You talk to your friends about me?
[08:34]
Draco burrowed deeper into his scarf, trying to protect as much of his face as possible from the biting November chill. Crisp leaves crunched satisfyingly under his winter boots as he made his way through Hogsmeade to Puddifoot’s.
[09:56] I know it’s stupid to care about this
at the time, obviously—and he looks like…well,
. In a way, it was perfect.
He’s lying in bed, two days after their impromptu drink at the wine bar. He’s still half asleep, one hand tucked comfortably behind his head while the other trails lazily down his abdomen.
[04:23] Ugh I definitely should have gone down the night before this is so fucking shit
[19:10] Really? Why didn’t you?
The waitress arrives to take their order and Draco’s so distracted by thoughts of what Potter’s home looks like he realises he hasn’t chosen anything and just asks for the same as Potter himself.
No. Not Harry. Fuck. Potter. He’s
“...hi.”
“He’s not boring, Ron, he’s just a bit qui-”
And that was obviously wrong of me
(9:20) There is such a thing as eyes being TOO GREEN you know
I know, that tall ginger lad already had a go at him
Draco huffed out a small laugh and looked down at his cup, running a gloved thumb on the edge of the lid.
“That’s not what you’re saved as in my phone anymore.”
[08:54] I can’t believe you’re abandoning me to the forbidden forest you lazy shit
[09:50] Where are you?
[21:25] Thanks
. Maybe it’s the thought that this is the first time today that they’re really (finally) alone together, and in such close proximity too. They’re so close that if Harry reaches out he could touch him. Maybe it’s that. Or maybe it’s the fact that the item of clothing that Malfoy has chosen to borrow is Harry’s favourite red jumper. Well, it's more a deep burgundy. And a bit on the thin side from so much washing because Harry wears it so often. But it is amazingly soft. And Malfoy’s wearing it.
[13:29] I appear to have fallen out of her good graces

But he doesn’t do that, just pats the space on the bed next to him and shuffles up, waits for Draco to awkwardly sit on the edge before he speaks again.

Are we going to talk about The Theo Incident
“Ah. Yes...that.” He laughs, looking down at Harry’s jumper as he reaches the front of the room. It isn’t his real laugh, Harry notes, and smiles to himself. “I had a slight altercation with Auror Weasley’s caramel macchiato.” He pauses for dramatic effect. “I lost.”

It was him though
Draco offered up a sad little wave, trying not to let his face betray him.

want to send him away, but there were things that needed to be said; Harry deserved to know the truth and Draco had been prepared to do it, right before Theo decided to drop napalm on any chance he might’ve had with Harry at all.
Yes you did
The lunch rush at Galen’s is starting to die down when they arrive and Draco holds the door open for Potter, who has donned a buttery-soft looking leather jacket over a dark green shirt.
“fucking hell Nev, the things I would do to him in that coat if he let me”
“Well yes, but -”

[09:31] We’re not talking about me
[20:46] Last year
Draco clears his throat, pushes his wine glass a little further away. “What do you like most about being an Auror?”
“-licked his face instead of-“
He didn’t think about it again beyond the odd daydream until he heard the rumour that Potter had cast a corporeal patronus in third year. Outwardly he’d scoffed in disbelief to anyone who would listen, rolling his eyes at the mere prospect of it. Privately, he’d looked up the stag patronus in the library, idly running his thumb over his knuckles as he stared down at the words
; he’s flushed and pink and lovely, a sheet of sweat covering his entire body, grey eyes glaring up at him dark and wild and there’s something almost feral in there too, like he could absolutely kill Harry if he doesn’t fuck him right now. Malfoy reaches for his own cock again, impossibly hard and leaking precome over his stomach. Harry licks it off, grabs Malfoy’s hands and pins them down by his head, giving his wrists a gentle squeeze.
Neville was indeed waiting for him in the hall, and was indeed still shooting moderately angry looks at Theo as Draco arrived.
A flash of annoyance crosses Malfoy’s face, as if to say
[15:44] I don’t like sourdough
Neville, there is nothing in the world that would make me want to leave the confines of my very warm and comfortable bed to sit on a plastic chair on a freezing cold Saturday morning

Still, Draco realised that pain had the dual merit of distraction
[13:40] You’ve no idea
“Right. Yeah. Sorry.” Harry shook his head, peering down at his feet before looking back up again. “It’s just I had this whole—and it all sounded so much better in my head, but how do I even try to—oh, fuck it.” He gave Draco’s hand a little squeeze. “I knew it was you, too.”
Which makes me think I am reading too much into the hat comment? If he knew who I was he wouldn’t be flirting at all

At our table in the hall
Malfoy’s breathing sounds ragged and broken and he snakes a hand towards his cock before Harry pulls it away and lifts his head. “Not yet.” Malfoy grumbles something incoherent into the duvet that sounds suspiciously like a combination of French expletives and frustration; Harry smirks, massaging around Malfoy’s hole with the tip of his index finger before sliding it in, slow and gentle up to the knuckle.
For now I’m going to quietly fume

That seems to be the only explanation that’s being offered and Draco has to admit that it
He didn’t even take his notebook out of his bag.
[16:14] Even the waitress looked uncomfortable

They lie like that for a long time, Draco curled up in Harry’s arms, head tucked under Harry’s chin, pressing little fluttery-soft kisses to Harry’s throat; when Harry feels the tingling coolness of a cleaning charm wash over his body, he pulls back from a grumbly Draco and peers at him curiously.

Malfoy is gesturing to the empty fruit basket and murmuring something Harry couldn’t make out and then the other man winks at him before scurrying off, returning moments later with an armful of peaches and handing Malfoy the biggest, peachiest-looking peach in the fucking pile.
Then hands are pulling his mouth open and more liquid is poured down his throat. Another hand over his mouth again but at least he can breathe through his nose this time.

[10:34] For rotation
Potter’s grin is mischievous. “Hm, where you saw my everything.”
Nothing else suspicious apart from the hat thing
Weasley nodded his head towards Harry, who in turn busied himself pouring out Draco’s drink from the silver canister in front of him into a disposable cup. He put a lid on it and handed it over.
How the hell did you change my name?
They removed their coats with minimal awkwardness, only occasionally knocking into each other. Draco unwound his scarf and dropped it onto his lap. He left his hat on because he was still a bit chilly. It had absolutely nothing at all to do with the way Potter would occasionally glance up at it and smile to himself.
“Maybe. If you’re good.”
Pick up your phone.

I toyed with the idea of sending Draco to London on the train but then I thought nah, of course he would fly!

Malfoy bites his lip, a small tugging at the corners of his mouth as he releases it. “Are you asking me or telling me?”
That's why I added the ‘too much’ ;-)

. Potter knows what he’s getting himself into. And he’s well within his rights to tell Draco to fuck off and do one and why does he care anyway?
“Can I walk you home?” Potter asks, coming back to the table having paid. There’s a bag with Esther’s sweet cabbage pierogies dangling from one hand as he reaches for his jacket with the other.
Potter’s thumb doesn’t even falter, his mouth curves into a devious little grin as he looks at Draco. “Dunno, do you want to take me home Malfoy?”
In all fairness, he did ask you to
He seemed in good health
“Bonjour.”
How’d it go yesterday

But Malfoy catches Harry’s mouth back up into a kiss, licks tentatively at the tender spot on Harry’s lip and starts to pull him forward.
“That’s n-“ Potter shakes his head looking a little flushed and grasps a menu. “Can I at least order first?”
[23:16] Ugh, I strongly object to being called Trouble
And wonderful.
I made no such promise
“I am. I could work for MI-5. Like James Bond.”
He’s met with a contraction of muscles as he licks at Malfoy’s stomach, and follows it up with his lips and teeth, travelling across Malfoy’s pale abdomen with gentle biting kisses. Harry’s half off the bed when he reaches the waistband of Malfoy’s trousers, nipping at the skin just above as he considers what to do.
“I might...wish you were here a little bit too.”
I wonder why he didn’t
“Right. Well, I’m sorry to disappoint you but my pyjamas are very not-posh at all, just joggers and a t-shirt.”
“You can’t see it anyway.” Draco says this more into his wine glass than to Potter and at first he doesn’t think he’s been heard. He sets the glass down because he realises he’s taken rather a large gulp and that can’t be good when Potter suddenly nudges him in the leg. He looks up, startled. “Sorry, what?”

Dear Mr Malfoy,
Draco doesn’t move, just watches Potter take his stuff. “October. Some international quidditch thing.”
“Well yes. Quite.”
“We’re too close. We should move.”
“Hypothetically. A hypothetical wooing.”
[19:14] I want you to

“I really am sorry!” shouts Ron, and to Harry’s relief he looks sorry too.

“I guess they had run out of whatever fancy hair potion you use,” said Ron, “what is that? Poncy Prat No.5?”

When Malfoy gives him a curious glance Harry looks a bit sheepish. “Some of the trainees like to prank me, alright?”
When Draco looked back down at his screen he could see the three tell-tale dots, fading in and out, as Potter typed him a message.

It’s awful, the meeting.
“Yes,” Draco says. “You said you were busy. With meetings. That I needed to make it worth your while.”

Harry breaks the texting ban. Draco makes a decision.
[16:03] Not too familiar, that could be...problematic

He’d wondered about the tie thing too, in the late night quiet of his room. Did Harry like being tied up? Or was it the thought of someone else at his mercy that flipped his switch? Would Draco be into that? What would Harry do to him in that position? Would he be slow and teasing? Would he like it if Draco begged a little?
“I - uh...there is a specific reason I wanted to talk to you though.”
It doesn’t matter now

Stop that
Potter arrives last. Unlike the others, he’s not wearing his Auror robes but a plain grey t-shirt and faded jeans that sit a little too low in the hip to be decent.
McGonagall had turned him back and he’d taken deep, desperate lungfuls of air until the panic subsided. Being transformed on the fly had felt like being suffocated and squeezed and broken and reshaped which, he supposed, he had been. Not-Moody had been unashamedly smug, McGonagall appropriately horrified.
The thin fabric of Potter’s t-shirt has rucked up enough during their slightly awkward amble that Draco’s hand has slipped underneath the hem, resting somewhere between Potter’s hip and the small of his back and Draco’s mind is racing like mad with the feel of him, all heat and soft skin.

It doesn’t take long to get to Malfoy’s bedroom. Seconds maybe, Harry isn’t sure. It’s entirely possible they apparated. The room is cast in the warm glow of a bedside lamp. The bed is huge and pleasingly solid-looking with more pillows than one person needs.
Classic 80s sci-fi :-)

“You know, the Ukrainian place you always go to after the events.” Potter says, smiling softly at him.
“Pfft, that’s what they want you to think,” replies Ron knowingly.
“Could end up being too much.”
“I hate it when you’re sensible. I much prefer you inviting yourself over to snuggle.”

Harry pulled away, looking up at him through his lashes as he licked his lips. He chewed thoughtfully for a second before swallowing the morsel down. “Gotta go. See you later, Malfoy.” Harry shifted the canister in his hands again and walked off, as if he didn’t have a care in the world.
“Is this okay?” he asks.
So, Harry comes up with a plan. It’s early when he walks into the canteen and buys

Harry is desperately trying to look anywhere that isn’t Malfoy. He’s already had an eyeful of a nipple that he wants to clamp his mouth over but he needs to not think about that right now. Aside from the fact that he’s not sure he’s going to be able to concentrate in this meeting with images of a wet, half-naked Malfoy in his brain, he needs to be

Harry doesn’t even care that Malfoy seems to have caught him out because today Malfoy’s shirt is the periwinkle blue, which happens to be Harry’s favourite. It’s open at the collar and it’s doing something to Malfoy’s skin - Malfoy’s neck - that is frankly pornographic. Harry licks his lips, finding it difficult to look away from the expanse of pale throat. His trousers are the same charcoal grey colour as the other day, still fitting Malfoy like a dream and Harry has to will himself not to hook his fingers in the belt loops and yank him forward.
“Yes, alright, thank you, that’s quite enough.” Harry says eventually, lifting his head and trying his very best to look cross.

“Wanted to see if you were alright,” Harry said.
And if those thoughts stayed with him well into the night, after everyone else in his department had gone home, and he cast a locking charm on his office door, as he fisted his cock and imagined tightening his fingers in Malfoy’s silky-soft locks as he sucked Harry off...well, that was Harry’s fucking business.

Draco heard someone calling his name as he quickly walked away, and was sure it was Neville judging by the familiar Yorkshire cadence. But he didn’t want to look back, didn’t turn around to see if his friend had followed. Instead he let the welcoming silence envelop him as he ran the rest of the way back to the school, grateful that he would find it empty.

Luna, tiny as she was, steered him towards an empty corner table and bodily shoved him down on the banquette. Potter went to take the chair furthest from Draco, but Luna stopped him. “No no! You should go and sit next to your friend, Harry.”

The last portion of blame goes to a man named Kettering, who Draco has never actually met. Waiting for his turn to be photographed, Weasley confides to Draco - because apparently a grown-up Weasley is also an exorbitantly chatty Weasley - that Potter initially declined the invitation to take part in the charity calendar. Hates having his picture taken, had to be convinced - Kettering guilted him into it, the prick (Weasley’s words).

[16:41] Yeah

Of course the interviews fuck everything up.
SIGH. Yes.
Harry’s so caught up in his thoughts that he doesn’t immediately register what’s happened and has, in fact, carried on walking. When he spins on his heel he sees Ron looking almost as red as his hair, and Malfoy’s shirt is soaked through.

“What the fuck was that?”

Harry just nods.
One of the volunteer students that was supposed to help with the fireworks event was not permitted to enter Slytherin Prep premises on Saturday morning. There seems to have been a misunderstanding that he was ‘trespassing’ with the intent to destroy school property. This is preposterous. Harry Potter is an exemplary student and I have the utmost confidence that he was simply looking for the way through to get to the school field.
Potter snorted. Draco kicked him gently under the table and tried not to notice Potter hiding a smile as he did it back.
Well no

“I have the final results from the session,” says Malfoy, clearing his throat and looking a bit flustered as he flips through his notebook. He finds a page, rips it out and hands it to Harry. “For when you debrief, if you want to use them. I’ve already broken the news that nobody beat you.”

Potter yawns, leans on Draco a little heavier. “I’m sure I’ve got a packet of ham in the fridge or something. Will that do, Nurse Malfoy?”

He still thinks you don’t know who he is right?
Everything was going fine until Draco spotted a bit of whipped cream on Potter’s knuckle and for some reasons felt the need to

Harry finds Malfoy’s prostate once he’s got two fingers opening him up and he relentlessly brushes over the bundle of nerves as he pulls out and pushes back in. After Harry had released his wrists, Malfoy had stretched his arms above his head, hanging them over the edge of the bed and Harry nearly came at the sight of him; the long lines of his exquisite body practically offered up to him like a gift. He’s kept this position and bears down on Harry’s fingers every time he thrusts back in, the only sounds above the slick-sucking sounds of Harry’s fingers are Malfoy’s groans and Harry’s heavy breathing.

“Fuck off.”
“I can help with that, Sebastian.”
“And you called him handsome.”

Potter stuck a mouthful in and grimaced before swallowing it down. “Ugh. Fuck I don’t think I can do this. No, I can. I can. It’s fine.”
When it’s Malfoy’s turn to pay for his food, Harry’s ears prick up at the sound of his laugh. It’s unexpected, gravelly and flirtatious, and Harry peers over to see that a good-looking wizard has come out of the kitchen to speak to him. He’s practically
