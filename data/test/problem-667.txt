Talking to Lovegood is easy, because she's utterly barmy and a complete delight once you get to know her. Longbottom comes next, despite everything, and now you feel only respect for you man he has become. Next comes Weaslette, the cheeky little thing she is, and you love being able to gossip with her and you find it amusing when she picks out men for you to ogle. You think she's your best friend. She won't admit it, but she thinks the same.
Harry nodded, smiling. "Obviously. But first, you need to pack and then we're going to the Burrow. I promised everyone I'd take you because they're all desperate to see you."
"But that's mental! You could have made plenty of other friends in other houses." It didn't make sense. If Malfoy was so lonely, surely he could stoop to the other house's level and try and bloody well make some more. It was too late now of course, but the option had been there once.
Malfoy shrugged, the scars on his face shining vividly as they caught the light. When he spoke next, his voice was borderline despairing, but as if it was trying to be casual.
Rogue Death Eater…. "Uncle Regulus." Draco blurted out.
"Draco..." Ginny pulled her hand away, still looking at him with that odd, soft look. "It's going to get better." She smiled at him and walked away
"I'm so sorry for that, but I couldn't think of any other way to get you alone." To his credit, Potter did actually look apologetic. Still, that didn't excuse him from literally
Professor Sprout had been really happy to receive Draco's results. She didn't question why he'd dropped it, they just picked up where they'd left off and for that Draco was grateful. They discussed for an hour or so, and for that blissful hour Draco didn't have to think about Harry or tomorrow or anything but Herbology and potions.
"Ginny!" Luna flushed a soft pink, and looking at her, Harry could almost see...Draco. He blushed the same pink, and the sunlight caught in his hair the same way it did Luna's, spinning into what looked like pure starlight. Luna smiled at Harry. "Harry, I promise, I don't mind kissing you. I'm sure you're a wonderful kisser, even with all those Wrackspurts."
Snape swooped by the table. "Draco, 5 points to Slytherin for trying to fix an utterly abysmal preparation, and 10 points from Gryffindor for perhaps the
bleeding. He forgot.
Add to all of this, the stress of the Horcrux hunt. Draco had read of Horcruxes in a few of the books in the Malfoy library, but none of them had gone into any satisfying level of detail. Still, he knew what they were and how they were destroyed, and though Draco did not know the process of creation (nor did he want to), he knew the general mechanics. He explained as much as he could to the trio, with Hermione taking notes.
you!"
being clingy but he was sleepy and Draco was warm but Draco was so
Draco watched as Harry convulsed, shivering as if bitterly cold. Harry shut his eyes tight, and Draco repressed the urge to reach over and comfort him. Then, just as fast as they'd begun, the tremors ended. Harry opened his eyes, and it was Draco's turn to shiver at how cold they were. Without a word, Harry rose from his seat and walked out of the room, leaving Draco alone.
about Draco's situation, and she'd been remarkably sympathetic. She'd promised to help Draco talk to Dumbledore, see if they could stage something and get Draco's family to safety. Draco had been quite adamant that his mother should be given priority, should that come to importance. His father...Draco hated to say it, but his father was too far gone, too fanatic to be saved. Even when being explicitly threatened, he continued to believe that the Dark Lord wouldn't dispose of him, that he was fighting for a cause that was just, for someone...no, something, the Dark Lord was no longer human, of that Draco was sure, some
"Later, Luna. This is important."
And...for some reason, they'd also gotten close, well, as close as they could get given...everything, with Malfoy and his little gang. He'd noticed Malfoy spent a lot less time with Crabbe and Goyle lately, instead hanging with Parkinson and Zabini. Ron still called them all by their last names but Hermione was already on first names with all of them except Malfoy. Malfoy was clearly less nasty, and even when he'd attack them, Ron didn't go quite as red, Hermione wouldn't get quite as angry. It was...weird. Uncomfortable.
A variety of emotions passed through Draco's face. Frustration, irritation, contemplation and….relief? Draco chuckled, and Harry relaxed. "You know what, Harry? You're absolutely right." He kissed Harry's forehead, and Harry relaxed. "Always the knight in shining armor."
"We'll figure this out, Draco. I don't….I don't know whether I'm going to remember any of this, or how I'll feel without the potion but….Hermione will understand. Let's...let's go tell her. If anything, you'll have at least one ally when I'm…." Harry felt Draco shake in his arms, and the two sunk to the floor. Draco's head shifted to Harry's shoulder, and Harry could feel his robes grow moist. His own tears flowed, silently, but he didn't let go of Draco.
Harry sighed, leaning back. "Just...please guys. I need some fresh air or else I am going to go
"He's done something, and it's working, I can
Harry sighed. "Luna that was-"

Pansy stuck her nose up as she stood up and smoothed down her skirt. "I would penalize you for your rudeness if we did not have Potions forthwith."
power over Draco, he would kill his family without a second thought. Or vice versa, the Dark Lord had a...thing about love potions, his father had told him stories of Death Eaters being killed for using them. Something about "not needing false strength", though neither Draco's father nor Draco had ever understood what he meant. It would be so much more efficient to seduce the other side, rather than to kill, but that was never on the Dark Lord's agenda.
Hermione and Ron shared a look, then Ron sighed. "Go for it, mate. We'll see you in a bit, yeah?"
us if we missed the wedding."
The initials looked familiar to Draco. He felt like he
There was always someone by him. Hermione, Ron, he was pretty sure Ginny and Luna had come once or twice, and always Madam Pomfrey with some potion he had to take. It felt like he'd laid here forever, sleep a tantalizing poison, being awake too painful to consider.
Yes, he was a pining mess.
Draco laughed, derisive. "Congrats, Granger, you've finally caught up. Now that you know I am innocent, may I
"I assume you're going to want to go somewhere private, hm?" Before Harry could get a word in edgewise, Draco was pulling Harry into some secluded nook and maybe Harry was just overthinking things, of course Draco couldn't be public about him, Harry was being stupid. Now they would kiss and it would all be better. Draco even pulled Harry close when they were there and, ah, this was it. "Oh Harry..." Draco cupped Harry's face and Harry melted into it. "Did you really think I was interested in you like that?"
"Good. Now, face Luna." Ginny moved so she was sitting in the middle of Harry and Luna, but not between them. They formed a little triangle on the grass.
Harry raised an eyebrow and Ginny went red. "Okay, just because I find him annoying doesn't mean he doesn't need to catch a break once in a while. He's been bullied pretty hard, thought I'd...give him something to smile about. Besides, I could see you were searching for the words, you needed the backup."
"Or else he'll kill your parents." Harry rubbed gentle circles into Draco's back. He was well aware that the potion was affecting his response to this but….if he'd known, even before the potion...perhaps the only difference would be that he wouldn't be holding Draco like this. Draco was...horrible, at least Harry thought he was before this whole situation but...even he wouldn't choose this. Clearly, he didn't choose this, no matter how much he was blustering in that train compartment.
, he kept staring at some dingy cabinet in the corner of the room. Harry couldn't think why. Yeah, that cabinet was giving off icky vibes, and Harry could
Draco rolled his eyes. "Any imbecile who reads the
Draco drew his arms across himself as a draft caught the two of them. "Nothing, Pans. I don't know why you think he was flirting, he was just being...Potter. He even tried to sabotage the potion."
"Conflicted?" Draco leaned on a nearby pilaster, trying to appear nonchalant.
Harry didn’t look convinced. “I still...for some reason I feel like things are going to go wrong.”
Then nothing more until he found himself in front of Hagrid's hut, which was aflame, dueling Snape. Harry vaguely remembered he said something about being the Half-Blood Prince, but Harry didn't
"I knew you were the one who did this to him. At first we thought it was just a prank, but no, you wanted to seduce him, and then what? Bring him to Voldemort?" Granger's eyes were narrowed, and since Potter was gone so was his
"Harry could get-"
"Grind the scarab beetles."
"Harry, I don't- I don't know what to do, I-"
Harry laughed, turning to grin at Ginny, and heard the grass rustle again, this time on the other side of him. He turned and saw Luna smile at him, dreamy as always. Her platinum hair fanned across the grass and Harry's smile faltered as he remembered running his fingers through platinum hair just like it, though while Luna always smelled of grass and trees and nature, that hair had smelled like...vanilla, coffee, a hint of some expensive cologne.
"You don't have to tell me, Draco," Harry said quietly.
Harry sat up, Draco adjusting to let him move. "Hermione-"
"They’re….a bit caught up with members of your Order. But I don't need them right now. Not for the job I have to do." Draco adjusted his grip on his wand and Harry would have screamed if he could.
Draco scoffed. "Pathetic, though I assume that can be blamed on the potion. Yes, Harry, I know about the potion. Last night, I just thought you wanted to get some action and I was bored out of my mind, so I went along with it. To be honest, I wouldn't love you even if I had whatever you're under right now."
Dumbledore refocused on Draco. "It does seem that Mr. Malfoy is slightly...indisposed at the moment." He smiled, kindly. "You are many things, Draco, but a killer is not one of them."
"Well of course there isn't now, you dolt. You're too caught up in yourself for there to
"Draco, I've been...thinking. If I die in the war, and that's a possibility so don't make that face….I want you to be able to move on. So maybe, we shouldn't..."
Harry's breath caught in his throat.
Draco raised one eyebrow in silence.
His hair was vaguely lanky and hung around his face, completely unlike the pale halo of gloss that Harry had grown accustomed to. His skin was paler, and he seemed to have lost weight. His cheekbones were prominent, cheeks hollower than they had been. The wrist that held the door open was frightfully thin.
"Draco." He whispered, reaching out to take his hand for comfort, support, or whatever the hell he wanted to call it. But Draco flinched away as if his touch burned.
"Anything for you." Harry said honestly.
Malfoy's desk, Malfoy's perfectly and systematically organised desk, was a
They sat down in silence. Harry pulled out a file requesting his signature - but he found he couldn't concentrate on it at all. The whole ordeal was weighing on him, and the words on the page just began to blur together even as he stared at it. Merlin. He had to do something. He'd been mean to Malfoy for long enough. He sighed, and he skipped to the bottom of the document, scrawling his name on the dotted line absent-mindedly.
His voice was so casual, but what he was saying was so
"Sorry-"
Draco took a deep breath and squared Harry with a look. "I'll live with you if you can get my wand back."
Draco stood frozen.
"No." he replied, far more bluntly than expected.
Feeling an odd sort of déjà vu, and a shameful reminder of what happened in that bathroom five years ago, Harry drew his wand and warily stepped inside.
Harry realised that he'd been gaping in horror at the Slytherin and smoothed his expression down in a way that Draco used to do. He hoped it was convincing, though he never had been very good at acting.
was like. Though, he was surprised that Malfoy was asking, or even talking to him in the first place.
The third was the worst.
"I knew you didn't understand."
You laugh, but inside you remember the unexpected pain of her punch, and thank whatever god is listening that Granger likes you now.
It took him a moment to realise that Malfoy's eyes had filled with tears, though only one escaped. Harry had to fight the unbelievable urge to join him in his crying and settled on remaining still from where he sat at his own desk, watching Malfoy.
And then he shut the door.
Harry made a choked sound without thinking. His voice cracked and dropped to a whisper.
Granger is by no means one who cries often, but you manage to bring that side of her out. Apparently, nothing gets to her more than building new bridges and equality. Although, you do think she should have left S.P.E.W tucked away in the corners of her mind, because you know with a shadow of a doubt that it won't succeed. She doesn't understand that house elves enjoy serving their masters, if treated fairly, but you remain silent. Instead, you keep your opinion to yourself.
Harry stared at him in horror.
"Nothing. I..." he trails off, still smiling. "I though I'd lost you, Malfoy. You've been acting weird and quiet, and it's... it's nice to see that you haven't lost your fire, is all."
is why." He said it like a statement, rather than a question. "Merlin, all it takes is one second of loneliness and you're ready to throw everything away and sweep in like the knight in shining armour!"
" This was the closest Harry had ever come to begging, and he didn't even care.
"What?" he nearly yelled. His mind had narrowed down to the sight of Ron handing in the doorway, face alight with hope. Ron nodded at again, stepping into the office with a grin.
Years of animosity apparently were harder to overcome than he had thought.
"Don't you ever get lonely?"
"Uh... don't say that? I'm sure they did miss you-" he began awkwardly, but Malfoy suddenly turned to look at him, and Harry was able to see his face.
You've lost yourself, you know. What you are, what you've become... it's wrong, it's what you've been forced into. But how can you find the strength to be
"It's okay. You don't have to tell me this." he said quietly. He didn't like seeing Malfoy cry. He'd seen too many people crying in his life. Ginny cried loudly and Hermione cried with deep, shuddering breaths and Ron cried with gruff sobs that he always tried to stop. But Malfoy did none of these things (except if he was having a panic attack). He just sat still and quiet, tears silently trickling down his cheeks.
Many of the occupants stared at him as if he suddenly had a halo, and Harry found himself signing a lot of autographs before he was able to find Draco.
It was then that he registered Ron's question, and the fact that Malfoy hadn't answered.
Draco's face was nervous and wonderfully hopeful, yet the sudden youth in his expression was heart-breaking, as he watched the flowers.
"Can I be an Auror again?" Draco asked, his voice sounding hopeful even as his expression remained wary.
Harry was so shocked that he could have fallen off his seat; all those years of hatred, and apparently it wasn't even true.
"Draco, Merlin. I... I'm so sorry. I didn't know you'd end up here in terrible place like this." No, that wasn't what he had wanted to say. He shook his head. "I've been looking for you since you left. We've all been looking for you, thinking something had happened, that you'd been hurt, or..."
He brought a shaking hand to the door, hovering it over the wood before knocking.
- and his eyes were glittering with menace and mirth. "What are you gonna do about it?" Memory Draco had seemed to unconsciously gravitate towards him, matching his intensity but retaining some fondness that spoke of how close they were.
glimpse the old Slytherin that had long since been buried.
"So, do I get to see this new house anytime today or what?"
He doesn't come over to you, even though you know he knows you're there. You wish that Pansy were here, or Blaise, or even Crabbe and Goyle. They'd make this fun. They'd talk to you.
for the first time.
But, the next time he discovers you in a corridor alone, tears slipping down your face and blood streaming from a cut on your lip, his face falls. He sees the way you cradle your throbbing left arm to your chest, after someone has wrenched it behind you forcefully, and he sees the bruise around your eye.
Finally, he came to stand outside door on one of the higher floors.
Panic attack, Malfoy was having a panic attack.
"That's...what I'm
"You got suspended?"
He is so close to you, his expression so gentle and  his magic so soothing on your beaten skin that something inside you warms and your heart begins to beat with what feels like hope. It's been so long since you've felt it, you can't quite recognise it. At this proximity, his eyes are flecked with streaks of brown around the pupil, and his hair is shot with lighter brown strands, seeming almost golden in the pale light. His skin is smooth and unblemished, which surprises you, because he's been through the war like you, so how is he so untainted?
, isn't it? It's not even a her, is it? He's the one you've been pining over for years. You would never tell us who you liked, and
Malfoy did as he was told, closing his eyes.
From now on, you can be you, and you will be amazing.
When Christmas is nearing, which means bleakness and despair, you find yourself wondering why you decided to attend the party that is only for the seventh and eighth years. Wondering why you would put yourself through this when all you're doing is sitting in a corner alone, a drink between your hands, feet sadly tapping along to the beat of the song, while everyone else laughs and dances around you. You're nothing to them, and they don't care.
"Come with me. Live with me." He hadn't meant to say it so abruptly, but now it was done and he would have to deal with it.
"...Because he said you were scum and that you spent your time torturing muggles." Harry was almost afraid by the sudden rise of anger in Malfoy's eyes. "And I thought it was wrong. He, uh, can't treat you like that."
The rest of the day passed by without conversation.
He had never had one himself, he barely even knew what happened during one, and he certainly didn't know how to stop one.
, one I only woke up from a week ago?" His grey eyes gleamed hard and silver in the darkness, the breeze whistling through his pale hair menacingly.
If Harry was being honest, it was going great, especially since he was preparing to ask Draco out.
"Malfoy? I thought you were still in the hospital wing?" he asked, hovering behind Malfoy, who was stood by the railings. His long fingers were gently resting on the cold metal, and his blonde hair was blowing gently in the breeze. From the angle Harry couldn't see clearly, but he thought that Malfoy's pale face looked impassive in the cold lighting, eyes closed, contemplative. Malfoy didn't even start at his question.
You were so stupid before. Living in terror your whole life, afraid to be different and to break the mould, that you took it out on others and you squashed yourself to be who you thought you had to be. Pureblood snob Draco Malfoy, the one who idolised his father and discriminated against non-Purebloods, as if that means anything, and who was friends with those who thought the same as him. The Draco Malfoy who hated himself for being gay, and who pretended to be everything he was not.
And then, Harry had asked him to a pub get together with his friends. It had been... interesting. Interesting, but not awful. It had taken a few mean comments and a whispered apology from Draco, before he had run from the room, almost in tears, for everyone to realise that Harry was serious about wanting Draco to be included. He had made that perfectly clear when he yelled at them all in front of an entire pub.
It's hilarious, until it's boring. You only have two months left of school, and he still hasn't made a move, making you wonder whether he will. That won't be any good. You didn't turn yourself around just for him to watch from afar, as if you haven't taken over his friends and become the person you've always wanted to be.
The Slytherin slowly opened his eyes, and his silver gaze rested on Harry. He swallowed.
Harry just stared at him, before it dawned on him that he should respond in some way, so he nodded rapidly. And this prior realisation caused another realisation, which was that he should try to appear calmer. If he was calm, then hopefully Malfoy would follow.
"Maybe. And anyway, it'll be okay either way." Harry had never heard such support from Zabini; his heart rate began to quicken for some strange reason as he watched the scene. The common room was now completely silent.
Whatever. He couldn't think about that now. He began to knock on various doors, asking shamelessly if they'd seen a gorgeous blonde man recently, and if so, where. He did realise that this made him seem rather dodgy, but the only one to question him was an old woman who threatened to call the Aurors if he didn't explain himself. He hastily explained himself.
Today, Harry sauntered into their room, holding two still steaming cups of coffee, ready to greet Draco and tell him about the awful TV show that was on last night- when the sight that met him froze all of these plans.
Malfoy was actually alright once you got over his past. He was surprisingly supportive, funny and just quite pleasant. Which was a word he would
I'll move in with you if you need me so badly."
But silence followed their words, no one daring to speak in the wake of this revelation. It was so abundantly explicit now how Draco felt about Harry, how he had for years. Even if they had wanted to speak, no one would have known what to say.
It's worse when he discovers you alone in the corridor, sobbing, just after you've been thrown to the ground and spat on by a nameless student. He just looks at you, doing nothing, his wand curled in his hand. There is no warmth in his eyes and yet, if you allow yourself to hope, you might even glimpse some hesitance. But still he does nothing. Just watches you as you stare up at him, face stained with tears and chest shuddering. You reach your hand towards him, not knowing why but praying that he'll take it and hold you in his arms- and he doesn't. He looks at the hand and turns away, striding out of sight.
Then Zabini's eyes widened, and he genuinely looked shocked now, if he hadn't already before. "It's
Even in the hazy view of the muggle camera, Harry could clearly see the glisten of tears in Draco's eyes.
But to his surprise, Malfoy's face just cleared completely into an expression of tiredness as he rested his head back and closed his eyes. "Potter, stop." He didn't elaborate further.
you."
Harry had scoured what felt like all of London for Draco, including the seized Malfoy Manor, but to no avail. Each new lead transpired simply to be a dead end.
That stings more than it should; you're not doing anything, not being weird. You're not manipulating him into feeling sorry for you because above all else, the last thing you want is pity. You would prefer hatred over pity. Bristling, you ask him why he followed you up here.
Behind them, the other members of the room were smiling, a single tear falling down Pansy's cheek, echoed in the way Zabini breathed out a small laugh.
Harry didn't say he was sorry, because words like that were meaningless. Instead, he stood and slowly walked over to the other desk, where he laid a hand on Malfoy's shoulder.
He doesn't speak to you still, and doesn't defend you when his friends jeer at you, but his face pinches when they do, and he looks pained. You wish he'd speak up and save you the humiliation, but he rarely does, other than the few times he glares at whoever is speaking.
Sure enough, there was Draco, stood aside without Parkinson (Harry could see her giggling with another boy in the background) and watching Harry. His expression was rather strange- unsure, hopeful? Memory Harry was oblivious to the gaze, and sat alone, looking miserable.
When a Beauxbatons girl suddenly swept into view, placing herself elegantly by Harry and extending her hand to him. Memory Harry seemed delighted by the attention, taking her hand and awkwardly rising to his feet to ask her to dance. She accepted gushingly, and together they departed from the shot.
You're not certain what he means by this, because what can he possibly mean? He doesn't care about you. You tell him that you're doing the best you can, and this only makes his brow furrow even further, impressively so.
Harry just stared. The words felt like a slap to the face and the insult wasn't even directed at him. It just didn't sit right with him that people felt it was okay to call others scum. He didn't care that Kingsley looked about to say something, perhaps to admonish Dawlish, or restrain Harry.
To his surprise, Malfoy just rolled his eyes. Irritation sparked in Harry, not overcoming the guilt but rising to the surface faster than he was proud of. He felt the need to explain himself, to make Malfoy understand what he was talking about, to not dismiss him as he always had done.
He jerked to his feet, grabbed his coat and Apparated away a moment after Ron gave him the location, despite his friend's call for him to wait a goddamn second.
Malfoy remained facing away from him. "Not really. No one visited me anyway, so it's not like I was missed or anything."
- and he responds instantly, his hands smoothing down your back and into your hair, grasping it as if he's been waiting to do this for Merlin knows how long. He deepens the kiss, ignoring the catcalls around the room, his breath hot and heavy on your face, and you feel like you're dying in the best way possible, feel like this is where you were supposed to be, that this is what you've been missing.
Then he saw it.
He seems to want your attention though. You see him glancing at you surreptitiously, and then looking away when you notice. You see the way his eyes follow you across a room, and you see his reaction when you bite your lip and muss your hair on purpose. It's a good reaction.
"But," Harry continued, "They'll just have to wait a little longer."
Malfoy was cut off by cries of protest.
A cold feeling wrapped itself in his stomach. The urge to be sick was stronger than ever.
And then, he was gone.
Draco laughed slightly breathlessly, entwining his arms around Harry's neck. Harry's own arms lifted up to wrap tightly around his thin frame as he breathed in Draco's scent, his eyes closing.
Hermione sat back, her hand falling to her side from where it had switched off the camera.
Someone had completely trashed his workspace.
He's here tonight. He doesn't look at you for the whole evening, instead dancing and drinking like the rest of them, and you're almost disappointed by how normal he seems. He's not supposed to be normal. He's supposed to be special, and brave and the saviour.
You blink at him, quite thrown by his response. Your fire?
Malfoy narrowed his eyes.
A tear spilled down Draco's pale cheek.
Harry didn't see Draco for several weeks after that.
"Harry..." Draco whispered into Harry's mouth, resting his forehead to the other's and opening his eyes to gaze into the green. Harry's mouth curved upwards as he smiled.
was volatile, but
Desperate tears prickled in his eyes, and to his horror, they were dangerously close to falling. He hadn't known it was possible to feel more guilty than he already had, even after threatening to punch the boy he'd almost murdered.
when no one will let you?
His forehead was creased where he was frowning sadly. His mouth was partially open.
"So where were you at the Yule Ball, Malfoy?" Ron asked, his face laid back as he watched the memories play back on the wall before them. In front of their eyes danced figures of elegant grace and vivid colour, girls giggling and boys red with embarrassment, but all enjoying the music. It had been Hermione's idea to watch back the Yule Ball from the footage in a Muggle camera she'd set up in the hall. She had thought it would enjoyable to see them all as they were four years ago, even if not all of them were here today.
Harry thought of Dawlish, his older, more aggressive fellow Auror. Dawlish had always been a pain in Harry's side ever since he had joined, always trying to take credit for Harry's case solves, and steal his cases. Luckily, Kingsley was not fond of him and he rarely succeeded. However, he was a
it was.
"Merlin, you do! You want to make Potter feel better!"
Suddenly, Memory Zabini had appeared beside Draco. The common room noise level rose significantly as everyone jeered at Zabini, who was by Draco in the present; at first he looked amused at his appearance, before a single, sharp tap from Draco made his face drain of colour. He no longer appeared to be enjoying the viewing.
. How in the world could Malfoy stand it?
That beautiful blonde hair almost gone, the pale skin almost never seen again, his snarky voice never to be heard.
You continue. Of course you're subdued, because everyone treats you like the dirt on their shoes. But you're not dirty, you realise. It's not weakness to be unable to kill someone; it's not weakness to want to protect your family, and it's certainly a strength to not give your enemy in to the one you've sworn allegiance to. You've been judged and you've been tried, and now you can move on.
You can't respond because you don't know, but you don't want to disappoint him, so you only look away. One of his hands takes your chin and guides your face towards him.
He stared at the place where Harry had once sat alone, his body slumped, his face absolutely crushed.
Harry was speechless for a moment. He suddenly realised the extent of the situation, and the extent of people's hatred for Malfoy; Merlin, to think he'd been enabling them, and allowed himself to indulge in such ignorance.
Harry, with no thoughts of antagonism for the blonde, sprinted around behind his own desk, to find Malfoy hunched over in the small gap between the desk surface and the floor. His bony arms were tightly coiled around his equally skinny legs, where they were drawn up to his chest.
Harry instantly knew it was the wrong thing to say as soon as Malfoy's face shut off, all mirth disappearing from his eyes, his mouth hardening. Why the hell would he say something like that?
Draco laughed, and then tears were in Harry's eyes at the sound of it. "How very Slytherin of you. I'm impressed." He laughed again. "Okay,
Harry? Draco had said
Things change very rapidly after that. Now, when they try to humiliate you and to hurt you, you don't let them; you smile carelessly and simply return to whatever it was you were doing. Their words can't hurt you anymore. Nothing can. You've been hurt, and that's okay. It's in the past.
It's not enough.
And here he was, with next to no serious consequences for his actions.
Harry stared at Draco.
voice said into the common room and Harry realised that he'd moved away towards the door, one pale hand resting on the handle as if ready to flee.
Slowly, he walked to the door, and Harry could see the gleam of tears in his eyes.
Draco had known about the lilies, and that was enough for Harry.
Harry persisted. His heart was hammering in his chest and a sick feeling was rising in his stomach.
Except this time, he appears saddened by your dishevelled appearance, and he bends down by your side. He takes his wand and murmurs some healing incantations under his breath.
"Why?" Harry's voice dropped to match the volume of Draco's. He thought that he could hear his own heart pounding and wondered if Draco could as well.
"Oh, don't worry. I love you anyway, more now without the icky mushy romance."
"No! I- that was an accident! I didn't mean to! I didn't even know what the spell did-"
Honestly, the last person Harry expected to see on his nightly wandering was Malfoy. But here they were.
"What?" Harry exclaimed, louder than he'd meant to be. "Malfoy, I understand. Did you not listen to me just now? If you're too wrapped up in yourself to notice-"
They were horrified by what I'd done. They-"
But resolve seemed to have settled in Draco's eyes, and he was able to
There was only silence on the other end. No sound of anyone getting to their feet, or walking to the door, or even asking who was there. Harry's heart dropped for what felt like the thousandth time.
"Draco, I'm so sorry." He began. His voice sounded nothing like him. "I am
You watch him go, wishing he'd stayed.
Harry frowned, thrown. Draco had gone to Dumbledore already and he wasn't a Death Eater? Did this mean that they were on the same side? He wondered how scared Draco must have been to have thought that Dumbledore, a professor he hardly respected or believed in, was the safest option. Draco continued, cutting of Harry's confused thought process.
But the other boy just set him with a level gaze.
Dawlish seemed surprised at his unexpected reaction. "Well...he is an ex- Death Eater. He clearly can't be trusted to keep his office tidy let alone protect our people! Honestly, Kingsley, it's a wonder you even hired him in the first place."
then he always will and then there'll be nothing you can do. And besides, even if everyone else hates you, you'll always have me and Pansy." He grinned as Draco stared at him, stunned.
He means everything to you.
Harry thought derisively,
In this moment, you hate him.
that Harry couldn't reconcile this Malfoy with the one he'd known at Hogwarts, or even the one he'd found trembling under Harry's desk. This wasn't right. According to routine, Malfoy wasn't meant to be so... empty.
Slowly, the whole room turned to see Draco stood by the door. His face was sad, and his gaze was focused on the floor.
And to add to that, Harry was absolutely torn up with guilt over the
Harry thought to himself, mostly as a distraction from his remorse. Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, the Chosen One, the Saviour. Yeah, he had no clue what
Because, yes, he did love him.
Except you don't. You love him. You always have.
"I mean," he continues, sensing your confusion. "that you're not the same anymore, and I... I don't like it. I mean, I'm glad you're not calling people 'Mudblood' anymore and bullying me and the first years, but... you're not supposed to be so- subdued. It's just wrong."
"I can't, Harry. You made sure of that."
Harry scoffed, despite himself, not even contemplating this possibility for a moment. "He loves you anyway, so why would you need to? I never had my parents, so you can't be all upset about having the ones you got. You should be grateful."
"I'm sorry I wasn't good enough for you."
There he went again, getting ahead of himself. Merlin, he really was more impulsive than he had thought. What was he going to do? Kidnap Draco and force him to live with Harry?
Weaslette cackles when she sees what you're doing to him, and she gives your tips on how to torture him further.
Harry stood motionless again. His hands were still by his side, in contrast with the fluttering of Malfoy's fingers on the railing, perhaps from anxiety. Harry's heart felt dead in his chest. He was struck very suddenly and almost overwhelmingly by the notion to hug Malfoy, to comfort him and wonder to himself how he had missed that Malfoy's life was worse than he made it out to be.
But then again, Malfoy hadn't renounced his beliefs yet and was therefore still an enemy. Or a possible enemy.
"Go ahead, I won't stop you." He chuckled, laughter fading again. "Perhaps you should even slice me open in a bathroom and permanently disfigure me and then never apologise instead. That rather sounds like something you'd do."
The door made a disconcerting breaking sound.
Behind him, Malfoy stood up- somewhat shakily- and went over to his desk.
Draco's head snapped up so that he was staring at Harry. "What?"
Harry was growing frustrated, and soon
Malfoy only barked out a laugh bitterly, eyes narrowing slightly. "How could I? After you so kindly refused my friendship, of course."
"Why would I do anything about it?" he drawled. His eyes were alight with defiance.
. And Lucius Malfoy, that- that evil son of a... paying for his son to have bodyguards. And not even friends. That was just
can hardly be described as scum. He is
- but it never came.
The image of crimson spraying from a pale face and chest lurched back into Harry's mind's eye. The quiet sobs and desperate gasping breaths were loud in his ears. If he thought hard, he imagined he could feel Malfoy's hand, bound in a spasm, jerking in his own. Harry flinched. He tripped, in his shock, and fell to the floor with a heavy thud, wincing. But astonishingly, Malfoy didn't laugh. He smirked, but not truly. His face suddenly looked years older and far more tired than it had before.
"When I first came to Hogwarts, everyone was... all over me, because of who I was. They only saw Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived. I did something completely accidentally when I was only a few months old and it cost me my parents, and that's all anyone cared about." He said quietly. The volume of his voice was in contrast to his annoyance.
"Do you know what's it like to have people only care about you because of your name?"
You hum quietly along to the songs as they play. You watch as everyone lets go, the first real joy to be seen all year, ever since that accursed last year. You drink your drink silently. You smile at Lovegood when she smiles at you. She's perhaps the only one who is kind to you anymore, although you're not entirely sure why, given the way she was imprisoned in your house not too long ago. Well, perhaps she can see that you were as much a prisoner as she was.
"Would you be willing to confirm that under Veritaserum?' He hissed.
Your pulse is racing, as if you've run a marathon, your throat sore from shouting, and yet you've never felt better.
Harry went to work each day, and each day he glanced over the empty desk as if the sheer force of his gaze would materialise Draco.
Only the two of them would ever know how much Draco had wanted that and how long he had been waiting for that kiss.
His eyes were bright with mirth and happiness. Harry grinned into the kiss as their lips met in the distance between them. The kiss was perfect, like a gust of warm air on a Winter's day, or a gasp of air in the ocean. Draco's hands tangled in Harry's hair and Harry's hands cupped Draco's cheeks, sliding over the sharp cheekbones. Harry would never grow tired of his, he knew, as happiness overwhelmed him.
Ginny fanned her face. "Dear me, all this praise, whatever shall I do? Now lay back down, you're wrecking my view."
Potter wasn't just a good kisser, he was the perfect kisser. He kissed with fire and Draco was melting, burning. Every movement was pure passion and Draco was aware he was making noises that he'd usually find embarrassing but he didn't care as long as Potter-no,
"Ginny!" Luna's voice was lightly admonishing, but even then she couldn't keep the mirth out of it.
Harry nodded, carefully wrapping his arms around Draco.
"I always liked Colin and Dennis." Luna smiled. "They have a nice energy around them."
Draco lifted his arm, waved slightly as his soulmate’s eyes landed on him. He felt some of the weight lift off him as Harry grinned back, before quickly disappearing back into the shadowed interior of the house, the window shutting behind him once again. Draco watched the empty window for a moment, before letting his arm fall back to his side, his smile falling in tandem as the dull ache returned.
“Yeah, thanks. I noticed.”
He thought, his shoulders sagging slightly as he closed his eyes, slowly giving in to sleep as the hours ticked closer and closer to morning. No matter how Draco reacted to the news, telling him on the same day had always been the right idea, regardless of how or why Tom thought differently.
Draco deserved to know every single thing that he hadn't been told by his father, and he deserved to know every little thing that he had been withheld by the man for his own ‘protection’. Draco deserved to know about his creature inheritance, and he deserved to know that he was being
The man was pale, almost unnervingly so, and his hands shook slightly as he carefully folded the letter back up and clutched it tightly in his offhand. She watched as he flexed the fingers of his free hand, before reaching up and adjusting his wand’s holster from where it was fastened around his forearm.
“No. In fact, it is quite easy to come by, but very tricky to continuously find in large quantities.”
The red was calm, branching down and around the pulsating, angry strings of green and gold, just barely touching it until fizzling out just barely before his own soul began. That was another thing he was now acutely aware of. The red lightning bolts were not touching his soul. They seemed, for the most part, completely disconnected from Draco himself, only associating with the familiar colors and shades of Harry’s soul as it pulsed and writhed through the air with sharp, angry movements.
Until clarity came rushing back to him, and he slammed the letter down on his desk, denting the wood and causing one of the legs to crack under the pressure. Draco’s words from the week prior raced forward from the back of his mind, ripping into him like a knife as their truth rang through the air in his uncomfortably silent room. The new year, mere months away. Less than half a year, if that, would pass before suddenly, without cause or reason, Lucius Malfoy would disown his son.
The boy and old woman turned to look at him as his lord’s voice broke the painful silence, the man’s observation drawing them out of their silent conversation. Immediately the woman gasped, her shadowed face revealing eyes wide with surprise as she rounded his lord to come up beside him, her wand still in hand.
His eyes narrowed, and he turned slightly to look at the man one final time. “How is that possible if the prophecy has not been fulfilled?”
Theo knew he was in control.
Nott Manor was very indicative of its name.
“Am I going mad?”
The man shook his head, flipping the page of the booklet so Tom could get a glimpse of the contents. “I agree with your plan from a logistics standpoint, but giving such a gift as that is something that I am wary to agree to, especially considering what Hadrian is now like.” Icy blue eyes watched him closely. “You understand, Tom, that we are quite the selfish person. I am hesitant to give up my separation from the whole if it means that in a few years time we will die and my magic… well, you understand my wariness in that regard. However, that wariness could be ignored if I was positive that my death would fuel a good cause, but I am not optimistic about Hadrian’s cause, whatever it may be.”
Draco's face lit up with hope and Harry was once more struck by how young he appeared here, like a small child who just wanted approval, or love. Draco turned once more, the lilies held higher in his grip-
The common room went silent in anticipation.
"Talk to me, Malfoy." His eyes are imploring.
It had been hard to even look himself in the mirror without shuddering in disgust. He couldn't bring himself to check the Slytherin table for Malfoy's return, too afraid the Slytherin would walk in and be scarred beyond recognition. He'd nearly
"Malfoy." He growled. "Shut the
Harry lurched to his feet. "
From his position, steps away from his door, he could hear... sobbing? It was coming from inside.
And, in some ways, that was worse. He couldn't even cry passionately anymore.
. Father would be horrified and probably disown me, and everyone would hate me. Including
What-
It was December 15th, 2001, and still there was no snow. It wasn't expected to snow, but Harry felt the disappointment, nonetheless.
It feels exhilarating to truly speak your mind for the first time in at least two years. To be able to unleash all the pent-up myriad of emotions and thoughts and to just blurt them all out. You haven't felt so free in years, haven't felt this liberty to speak your mind and to be
As the night progresses, you feel the distant hope that someone might speak to you start to fade away, until all that is left is a cold sadness inside. It makes your heart hurt a little. Even as a child, you knew how it felt to be lonely, because you hadn't met your friends yet and you have no siblings, so it had always been terribly lonely when your parents had to go out without you. Except this time, instead of simply being alone, you are surrounded by people and this time, it's that no one wants to speak to you.
Harry began to grab an extra coffee in the morning, having casually asked which order Malfoy preferred. The look of surprise on his face the first time Harry had done it had been upsetting, but as Harry had continued to do it, he became more used to it.
up. I can't believe I ever felt bad about-" His remorse vanished in a torrent of fury. How could he have felt guilty for someone who still used prejudiced slurs? It served him right.
Malfoy's voice, normally so calm and collected, was shrill and thick with shock.
Harry smirked wryly at him. "Only for the rest of the day."
His pristine schedule was tilted on the wall, no longer charmed precisely horizontal to the wall. His pen pot, a rather odd thing for a
Draco glanced at the floor, looking embarrassed. "I'm not starving myself intentionally, don't worry. It's just that I work long shifts in a few nearby places, like the shop down the road, so I often forget to eat, and I don't get to sleep much." He paused. "It was hard getting people to hire me initially and even if they wanted to, they couldn't because I don't have a wand. You'd be surprised how much you can't do without them." He sounded matter of fact. Harry hated it.
"No. You helped me before, so I owe you an answer. Besides, if I don't talk to someone, I'll probably go mad. At school, I had friends. Lots of friends I hardly knew and a few friends who meant the world to me. They're dead now, or in Azkaban. But, although they loved me, they never understood. They never understood my aversion to chaos and the panic it would make me feel. They always looked at me weirdly, and it was always the thing we didn't talk about. At the time, I hated it and I wished they would understand me, but now... I'd give anything to have them back."
And now Draco was paying the price.
Harry's hands curled into fists by his side. He would not hit Malfoy, he would not hit Malfoy... come on, Harry. "You prick. Perhaps I should punch you like Hermione did in third year."
Dawlish laughed but his eyes were confused. "Come on Harry. Yesterday you were bemoaning having to share an office with him and now you're singing his praises? Please. You don't have to defend him just because Kingsley's here. We all know he's scum."
Completely fabricated, Harry knew. But points for his creativity. He'd clearly had minimal time to think of an alibi.
Harry had no idea what to say, or do. He was... horrified. And distressed at the sheer sadness and familiarity of what Malfoy was saying. He didn't want to, but he understood.
Seriously, though, he didn't understand how Malfoy had gone from obnoxious, superior and smug to downtrodden, disinterested and morose in the space of a few years. How did he not care about Harry anymore when he'd done his utter best to irritate him every minute of every day at Hogwarts? It didn't make sense.
The night drags on slowly, and you long to take yourself to bed and to fall into a slumber of nightmares and exhausted blankness, but you don't really feel like being alone tonight. You're always alone, and no one's actively trying to remove you from the party, so why would you give up your precious time of being around people peacefully? It's a miracle you're here to begin with, and you suspect it has something to do with Granger and Lovegood. For all Granger can't stand you, she would never pass up an opportunity for fairness. Even you, in your isolation, has heard of her S.P.E.W campaign.
And then suddenly, Malfoy burst out laughing. He bent double over his desk, and Harry had to chuckle at the violent shaking of his shoulders and at his clear amusement. Malfoy straightened again and Harry snorted at his red his face was. Malfoy grinned at him, completely unexpectedly.
You sob harder, endless tears streaming down your cheeks. You wrap your arms around yourself, almost as if it is another person, and you stay there until the moon is high in the sky.
And they leaned in again, heads twisting to get closer, the touch tender and affectionate as they discovered the other's face
It leaves you bewildered, wondering why you thought that and what possessed you to even yield to it as you do now? Why does it follow you around and stir your thoughts when you see him? Why is he so beautiful to you?
"Mate, I think we've found him."
Harry's friends were also angry with him for what he'd done. Hermione had had a right go at him, fairly, in the moments after she'd discovered it, and then proceeded to ignore him for a full week. They were all assisting him in locating Draco, but none of them had yet to have any luck either.  Hermione was working all around the clock to get the new law revoked, using Draco's case as her evidence on its harshness. She was making progress, but it was slow. She'd managed to get some people to come forwards in defence of Draco, including people he'd saved in the line of duty.
Draco quirked his eyebrows, a sneer marring his already marred features. His face was derisive and all too familiar to Harry. "Hurt like hell. Though, no one ever visited me, not even Saint Potter who did it in the first place."
But the worst part is the distaste in his green eyes when he sees you, the way his mouth curls down and his brow furrows and he turns away in disdain. The others, his friends, do the same, but none of them can touch you; you're used to it. They don’t respect you, don’t understand why you never fight back against the jeers. You don’t care what they think. But when
He'd done this.
It wasn't for lack of trying. He had gone to Draco's flat countless times and had been turned away by the neighbours who had insisted that Draco didn't want to see him. The last time he had gone, the landlord had told him that Draco had moved out. Apparently, he'd been unable to afford it as he couldn't pay his rent anymore.
Weasel comes next, though you're not as thrilled about that one, because it means that you won't win all your Chess games anymore. He's alright, you suppose. Remarkably mature now, in comparison to his younger years. War and grief does that to a person. Still, he's fine to be around, good to have on your side.
wasn't enough for Parvati, I think she'll be forever disappointed." Parvati flushed, but grinned. Harry, who was still watching Draco, saw the unease spark again as the other boy cast his gaze to the images again.
In contrast, he suspected Malfoy was OCD. Everything was meticulously arranged on his desk, he had a detailed schedule above his work, which he
"I do wish you'd all call me Draco." he muttered, and Harry nodded, contrite.
"God, Malfoy, Draco..." He murmured, grinning like an idiot. "I've been wanting to do that all year. I never said anything, and you thought that I didn't like you, and then you blew up at me... and now you're
Silence festered between them again.
He went down the corridor- and paused.
Still, she smiles and moves on. Dances with Longbottom, laughs with Weaslette, never sitting or speaking with you. You don't expect her to. She's far too pure for that.
They give up when they see that you don't care anymore. In fact, you think that some start to respect you for it. The teachers certainly do, because you see them giving you appraising looks when you're hard at work, and you hear how pleased they are for you when they remark on your improving grades. The eighth years begin to speak to you, though it takes you a while to trust what they have to say, and to reciprocate.
to have forged it. There was no way he would sign something that disgusting... except if he hadn't read it properly, or even at all. His mind flashed back to the day of Draco's panic attack and the form he had scrawled his name on unthinkingly, without reading.
"How could I not be?" You ask teasingly. "Now that I know what I want?"
"Whatever, Potter." Malfoy rolled his eyes, his gaze hardening. "I know that you just want to know why I was crying in that bathroom."
But, of course, something had to go wrong. Because he was Harry Potter, after all.
Draco had returned, pale and silent, to an awkward round of apologies. From then on, they had all worked extra hard to incorporate Draco into conversation, and Harry had firmly stuck by his side, one hand on his back.
They were sat in the eight year common room, shared by all houses, and right at the start of the year they'd decided to all bury their differences and work together to create a happier environment. After a few fights that mostly removed the animosity, the plan had worked surprisingly well and Harry had found himself with more friends than he'd had at the start of the year, including
person with a large presence, which meant that you always knew what he thought of you. Dawlish had always been upfront about his hatred for Malfoy, so Harry knew that Malfoy was telling the truth, and this infuriated him.
But then he lurched back into gasping again. Harry threw his conscience out the window and just leaned forward and grabbed Malfoy's hand, pulling it to his chest tightly. The other man shot him a frantic look but did nothing to pull away.
"Would it?" Malfoy snarled. "As wrong as slicing someone open in a bathroom while they're literally sobbing?"
Harry looked away from him then, not wanting to think about the anger this incurred in him, or the gratitude on Malfoy's face and the funny things it made him feel.
Malfoy laughed humourlessly. "I don't have friends. I have followers. Crabbe and Goyle are literally payed by my father to be my bodyguards, Pansy only wants to marry me so that she'll be rich later in life, Nott wants me to promote him to higher society and Zabini literally asks for money because he's weird like that. The closest I have to friendship is Millicent, who smiles at me occasionally. When I went to the common room last week, Crabbe and Goyle laughed at my scars, while Pansy was disgusted and had a go at me for being 'inconsiderate'."
But what could
You smile at him.
"Wait, Malfoy... I didn't know." Harry stammered, realising that he had, in fact, never apologised. "I didn't know what the spell did, and I... I thought you wouldn't want me there. I'm so sorry. Really. It was wrong and I'm sorry about the scars because I never meant to do that to you. Merlin, I'm sorry-"
"Don't." he murmured brokenly. "You've done enough."
defence mechanism began to show its ugly head- retaliation. "No! I was just angry... and
He is beautiful in your eyes.
Perhaps Malfoy should have been in Gryffindor.
Draco looked sharply away, his face suddenly flushing. "Maybe I don't want to do that now."
When his feet touched the ground again, he saw he was on an unknown pavement with people milling around him, clearly unperturbed by his sudden appearance. They had to all be wizards then. Thank goodness, he thought as he realised how badly this could have gone. Kingsley would have been furious. Several gave him shocked looks when they realised who he was, but he paid them no mind.
On this particular morning, Harry grabbed a biscuit- custard cream- and strode to his office on the fourth floor, foregoing the Floo. He glanced into Ron's office to see if he'd arrived yet but was greeted by an empty chair and piles of paperwork. Honestly, who knew being an Auror meant so much
"Mal- Draco..." he stuttered. Malfoy whipped around to glare at him.
"Potter?" he whispered, and Harry nodded. "Thank you."
Dawlish only rolled his eyes. "Malfoy, you may have a flair for the dramatics, but you don't have any authority for a suggestion like that. If Kingsley deems my reason valid, then such a request is ridiculous and unnecessary."
say, you volatile dolt. And you calling me Malfoy is kind of ruining the point of this entire self-pity fest I'm having, so stop it." Malfoy's voice was far calmer than Harry's, but irritation had seeped into it, making it biting. It washed over Harry like a burst of ice water, cooling his temper instantly. Harry could have kicked himself for reacting so fast. He was not the one who should be angry.
He wanted to collapse to the floor and never have to feel this unquenchable, rushing guilt that pounded in his ears and rose in his throat and choked him. How could he have done this? Even to someone he had once despised, who had called him names and mocked him. How could he have so permanently marked him as a reminder of a fleeting moment of fury? Harry wished that he were the ones wearing the scars, not Malfoy. Never Malfoy, Death Eater or not.
He would also casually ask him about his day, no matter how sad an answer he got. Draco started to tell him more and more things that
Draco stood frozen. The lilies wilted in his fingers.
A whole month, gone.
"Desperate?" Draco sounded sceptical.
And it suddenly became abundantly clear where Malfoy was.
Malfoy smiled faintly, his body leaning into Harry's touch.
"Hermione managed to rally public opinion against the new law, forcing the Ministry to abolish it mere months after it was introduced." Harry clarified. "She used you as an example mainly, as well as some others who had been getting their lives on track, and one woman who wasn't allowed healthcare when she needed it. Hermione made people realise what the law actually meant, and some people you helped as an Auror even came forward in your defence. That was pretty great." Harry smiled. "But this is the best part."
Perhaps it's because he saved your life. Because he's chosen, and heroic, and brave and good and pure- and everything you're not. He's everything you wish you could have been when it mattered most.
-------------
"I was there. Just in the background. Not all of us are Chosen, you know." Malfoy drawled from behind Harry, in the midst of the cosy group that had formed. Harry snorted; Chosen One comments no longer irked him, particularly when said so frankly. But when he turned round to look at Malfoy, he saw that the Slytherin's face was uncomfortable, eyes cast down and hands fidgeting. "You know, we really don't need to watch this-"
Harry was yanked unceremoniously out of his thoughts by Tom, who dragged him over to the door while muttering worriedly. “If you would stop daydreaming leech, we can get on with fortifying this blasted hole.” He nodded companionably, forcing himself to focus back onto the topic at hand as Tom guided him through the motions of creating a more complex ward that he had only really studied in an intellectual sense.
“I suppose it does, doesn’t it.”
“Yeah? And how do you know anything about that? Did you sneak off to France to spy on him from the bushes?” He teased, snorting as Draco’s face erupted in a quite lovely shade of fuchsia.
“Yes master.”
“I do hope it doesn’t. We planned all this for today because of the low winds, so it would be upsetting if the weather decided to change on us.” Nicolas replied idly, also disregarding his overshirt into the fire. “But I doubt that it will. Today is one of the more still days of the year, and there is no reason for that to change.”
Lord Lucius Abraxas Malfoy is the proud owner of no less than three offices.
He shook his head slowly, slumping low into his chair as Fawkes finally returned to the room. There was so much for him to consider, and it felt like there was so little time for him to do so.
but clearly, she was the only one who could
“What the
He settled on a mix of both.
“Good morning, Hadrian! And happy birthday.” She replied, slowing to a stop before turning to look at him. They stared at each other for a few moments, before she smiled in a very gentle, concerned way. “Are you alright, dear?”
“Hadrian.” Perenelle’s hand came to rest over his own, and Harry found himself stuttering to a stop, his eyes locked onto the table as her comparably tiny hand squeezed his own. “We have lived hundreds of years, Hadrian. I highly doubt that you will be able to surprise us.”
Daphne trailed behind him as he continued deeper into the compartment, her hand a familiar comfort in the crook of his elbow. She made a surprised noise from the back of her throat as she looked at the pair in the corner, barely seeming to notice as he took her trunk from her and placed it on the overhead with the rest of their things. Draco made a face at the noise, wrinkling up his nose as if he had smelt something foul.
“Yes, I am just fine love. If you could give me a moment, I believe I have to write a response.”
“You’re right, I… yeah, breakfast.” He muttered, rubbing his cheek with far-away confusion as he slowly trudged away from Draco’s door, wondering if he actually
No cost was too great.
He gaped for a moment longer, before cautiously snapping his jaw shut. “Nice to see you too, mate.”
“A portkey, boys, ever heard of it?” She teased, and Harry rolled his eyes as his hand came up to wrap the thin chain around his pointer finger. Draco glared at her, still looking terribly confused with the ordeal but understanding enough that they were leaving, before he too grabbed ahold of the chain.
“I don’t trust him much either, but it's late. Perenelle, we should just put him in the basement for the night.” His lord’s voice echoed through the night air, punctuated only by a disbelieving scoff.
Theo stared at the man blankly, before silently turning around and leaving the kitchen, writing off Xenophilius’ words as nonsense. They usually were anyway, so he really shouldn’t have been expecting much.
Harry thought haphazardly, slowly standing as well as Draco turned and began to pace through the room, muttering to himself nonsensically as fire danced across his arms and inside his eyes. Harry worked to steady himself for a moment, discombobulated by all the emotions racing through his own mind and towards him through the bond. His heart was aching, or maybe it was Draco’s. If his own worked for anything, it was for being useless. Yes, it was probably Draco’s.
Harry stayed there for far longer than was really necessary to warm himself and melt the ice, but he eventually got out and got dressed, meandering down to the dining room just in time to see Perenelle pay the delivery owl for the paper.
“Said this said that, it’s always about what you’ve said but never what
“Please enjoy yourself tomorrow Hadrian, for your own sake. Leave the worrying to me, please. I have the age needed to bear the brunt of it, and I desperately want to. For you, just this once.”
Theo felt like she was trying to confuse him on purpose, saying things that made even less sense than usual. He also felt like he had gotten pretty good at telling when she was trying to be confusing and when she was just saying confusing things, as most of the time her confusing-if-important moments tended to actually relate to the conversation, while other times she just spoke nonsense for the sake of it.
talking about or dealing with anything related to the bloody boy-who-lived.
Krum nodded along to his words, his face about as readable as a waterlogged book floating about in the Atlantic. Draco grimaced slightly, his eyes flying between Harry’s ever-impassable visage and Krum’s apparent poker face.
Gathering his wits about him, Barty swallowed thickly, taking a few sharp breaths of air as the boy and old woman glanced between themselves, stuck amidst a silent conversation as his lord continued to silently study him, his green eyes no longer betraying the man’s emotions as they regarded Barty calmly.
“Hadrian Potter.”
You may be able to see now, dear reader, exactly where this is headed.
Perenelle’s voice cut through his thoughts as she sat down next to him with a glass of orange juice in hand. “Nicolas never seems to get up before noon, so you’ll just have to bother with my inane ramblings until then.”
“You will
She wondered if Blaise Zabini pushed that boy off the train.
The not-Moody’s soul was orange—it was quite a pleasant shade actually, reminding her of the fruit with the same name—and whipped about in excited coils of light. It was wonderfully boyish, really, and had an air of ache to it that felt almost infantile. Luna rather thought it was the soul of a previously withdrawn person, with the way it whipped around the room as if it had never been able to before. Yes, that was it; the soul seemed to have been contained tight to the body for a very long time, and had just recently been freed to do as it pleased.
The door came crashing down between them, silencing Tom along with his worried shouts. He would deal with the man later, when his mind wasn’t overflowing with other issues and he could actually
“Bloody hell.”
“Get back into my
“... How much sleep did you get in the past week?” Draco muttered, his tone hinging on concerned.
Just a little warning here because it's honestly kinda funny (if mostly cringey) but I understand if it's not something a lot of readers are here for, but if you don't feel like reading my medication fueled ramblings you can skip over the normal text in between each drawing and just look at the pretty pictures. There is a liiiiiittle bit of lore analisis thrown in there somewhere but it's mostly just me talking randomly about thoughts that each drawing brings forth from my twisted, evil little gremlin subconscious, so you don't have to worry about missing anything important if you just skip over those.
Nicolas coughed again, taking deep breaths of the fresh air outside with clear relief. “I will have to-to step out, however. The fumes will become lethal to me once you do, even with the elixir of life in my blood.”
His mother fidgeted with the collar of his shirt, pressing out the invisible wrinkles as he watched the time with barely concealed impatience.
And that knowledge, the knowledge that he was utterly powerless to help Draco in any way but how Lord Malfoy wished, was driving him utterly
“I’m sorry, Dray.” He started, setting the glass of water onto the table as Draco glanced back up at him. “You’re right. It’s just… well, see here’s the thing, I got a letter from… shite, no.”
“I missed you... a lot.”
The thought sent a wave of panic through him, and as Lord Malfoy’s hand left his shoulder, Draco’s gaze zeroed in on the fireplace across the room. There were mere minutes left until the international floo was opened for him, and then he would be off to France a week earlier than scheduled, without the ability to know anything past what he had been told at that moment. What would happen at the manor while he was gone? When he returned during December for Yule, what would have changed? There was a certain oppressive weight to the air, one that had followed him around the manor for the past week, ever since his father had stood up one morning and stated that he should leave for France earlier than scheduled. Draco just didn’t know what to make of it all, but knew that it wasn’t anything good. Maybe that was why he had instinctively written to Blaise, knowing that the owl would take too long to get to Harry and feeling unsure with where he stood with Theo. He had just desperately needed to tell
Before we get started, I've got a very quick announcement:
Draco: "I suppose I am, yes."
“Take a good look at your own damn hypocrisy, Potter.”
He stared at it, blinked, before rubbing his eyes. He looked again, squinted, before shaking his head.
Harry snorted, his shoulders shaking as Draco quickly followed suit, the both of them silently laughing together as the distant feeling of a looming danger washed over them. Harry felt like he was falling in and out of hysterics, teetering on the edge of either insanity or breaking apart into a sobbing mess again. He didn’t know if that was his own feeling or Draco’s.
Luna suddenly realized
Nodding to show that he understood, Blaise leaned back in his seat and sighed, feeling the harsh gaze of the boy across from him dissipate as Draco went back to his reading. Following the curve of the ceiling above him, his eyes trailed around it, mapping out the geometric layout with familiarity.
Harry laughed as Draco shakily stood, using the taller boy’s shoulder as support while he looked around for Perenelle. He spotted her wiping her mouth a few yards away, a thoroughly assaulted bush next to her having gotten the brunt of her half-digested dinner. She stumbled slightly, before righting herself and reaching into a pocket in her blouse, pulling a handkerchief from the folds and dabbing around her mouth with it.
Tom didn’t know why the twisted little thing had decided to come crawling through its door and into his mind, but he was positive that Marvolo had something to do with it. The connection between them was very… he glanced up at the door that had once been labeled ‘ring’, smiling weakly at the iron-plated door that now stood there. The connection was quite... impassable, from Marvolo’s perspective at least.
The butterfly was nowhere to be found. Harry supposed that it must have flown back out to the dangerous world outside his room.
He fumbled with the thing for a moment, before nodding, falling in step beside her as they slowly made their way down the hall, him watering the potted ferns and occasional flowers as she began to speak.
Hadrian Potter takes his tea with lemon as a chess player finds himself overwhelmed by his own hubris, screaming with frustration as a prisoner awaits his freedom, biding his time as his body is strung up like a puppet with strings of twine.
“Bloody-what the hell!”
Draco seemed to have settled into the daily happenings of the Flamel estate surprisingly well, though Harry barely noticed, too caught up in the joy of actually having him there than anything else. Each morning started about the same as before, with the difference of Draco joining him and Perenelle for a respectably timed breakfast only a few hours earlier than Nicolas typically woke up. The days beyond that changed depending on a wide variety of factors, though the general consensus seemed to be that, once he had found his footing and realized exactly who she was, Draco had taken to worshiping the ground that Perenelle walked on, and tended to follow her about her potion’s laboratory, trying to not-so-subtly pick up some tips and tricks as she, in a fair use of actual subtly, gave him pointers as she worked. Harry didn’t get to see the vast majority of this, finding that Nicolas seemed intent to give him just enough general knowledge in alchemy to manage anything on his own, and with the added distraction of Draco’s general presence had seemingly decided that Harry could use another few hours down in the laboratory, carrying and melting and alchemizing various metals.
minutes? I’m not letting you out of the damned chains.” He hissed, turning to glare once more at the hideous amalgamation of Voldemort’s paranoia and insanity. Tom sneered at it, hateful and angry at what it represented. He had acute memories of Voldemort making the locket, and none of them were particularly lovely. They certainly explained why the small slip of a soul had turned out the way it had, especially since its physical vessel had been saturated into a potion designed to mentally torture people for the, incredibly pivotal, first few days of its existence, until Regulus Black had gone in and saved it from going even madder.
“How much?”
Spurred on by the reaction it had elicited out of his soulmate, Harry took great joy in making even more unnecessarily flowery declarations of his affections as they walked up the sharp upward incline of stairs and to the very top of the stadium. Draco laughed a few times, and simply smiled at the rest, refusing Harry any more cheeky quips or equally obnoxious declarations until they nearly reached the top of the absurdly tall and unnecessarily thin stairway.
He rolled his eyes, “very funny. And I suppose you’ve gone off and started, what, chopping
Draco sighed, rubbing a hand down his face as his soulmate went and did whatever he pleased, that apparently being shaking a random man’s hand and introducing himself.
If Barty were capable of it, he would have toppled over backwards in his chair. The World Cup! He would be taken outside! There were so many possibilities-so many potential noises and voices to listen to! Adrenalin spiked through his system, the thought of not only leaving the house, but going to somewhere as overpopulated as the World Cup-! It was almost too much to bear. Barty wished he could unfocus his eyes, if only to see if the adrenaline was rushing so quickly through him that his hand was actually shaking. What a wonderful sight that would be! The thought that, even in this tortuous state, he was capable of sometimes breaking through, and wrangling some semblance of control away from his father, even in such a small way as a shaking hand. What an utterly glorious thought!
Luna groaned, shaking her head with frustration. No! There was no possible way that soul belonged to an aged man like Alastor Moody. There was just no way!
Olympe took it gladly, before dabbing at the frustrated tears lining her eyes. “Thank you Nicolas, you are, of course, correct. I wish that was the first thing I had thought of, or he might have never come ‘ere in the first place.”
“Lovely seeing you again, Gabrielle. Do you want to sit-?”
The sudden movement jolted him from the familiar stupor, the numbness of constant discomfort ripping away from him as it was replaced with acute awareness. His pupils dilated, focusing in on the vague forms of people milling about around him as the dull roar of hundreds upon thousands of people assaulted his ears. It was so loud. It was too loud. It was too much. He was confused. He was scared. How had he gotten there? Why was it so loud? The last thing he could recall was his father coming home from work, just like any other day.
Xenophilius hummed, eyes moving very suddenly from where they had been observing a section of the wall to lock onto his own and stay there. Theo jolted in shock, finding it difficult to look away from the man’s gaze. Xenophilius’ eyes were a shockingly light gray-almost white-and had a feel of having seen far too much far too quickly. The man smiled knowingly, tapping the side of his nose as he spoke again. “Are you sure? She has told me that you have had a prophecy nearly a year ago. Has it already come to pass?”
He could slowly feel the wind-his fingers flexing as his muscles and bones and nerves lit alite with life. He was
“I’ll see you both at Yule, if you still want me home for it.”
“Master… the-the young master needs food and drink, and… and he’s has not been washed or relieved today.” Winky’s nervous voice spoke for the first time since Bartemius Crouch left that morning, quiet and unimposing as Barty’s father’s footsteps echoed through the house. The man merely grunted, the sound of fabric swishing making Barty wonder if he had hung up his coat. Or perhaps he was planning on leaving again soon and was changing his work coat out for a different one. Barty desperately wanted to know, if only so that he had less things to contemplate than he already had. Contemplation could only do so much for boredom before a man would go insane, after all.
behind it that unsettled Theo slightly. He refused to take a seat even after the man motioned for him to do so a second time. “Come now Favorite, tell me what she’s shown you. I would dearly love to know.”
“This is getting me nowhere.” He muttered, trying to force the noises out of his immediate attention as he turned once again to the door. It was a simple enough fix, if he wanted to put the door back to the way it was, but that amount of security didn’t seem effective anymore.
Daphne fell silent. Even Draco didn’t seem to know what to say to that. Blaise, in direct contrast, felt rather giddy.
Hearing the words come out of his own mouth made Theo realize something, and he began to focus more onto what they might convey. Who was this demon? He had a sneaking suspicion that he already knew.
Despite the weirdness I get with drawing this female OC with a more manic and cruel personality (because she's usually a sweetheart on even the worst of days) I actually really love doing it. I think that insane characters that have something deeply wrong with their psyche are fascinating and something that I want to delve into deeper with Fate. Of course, there aren't a lot of scenes that have her in them, just because she isn't usually necessary to the plot as anything but a faceless deity for Theo to fear and Harry to curse on occasion. Of course, that will be changing somewhat in the coming years as the climax of the story reaches its head, but we don't have to talk about that here.
(See the end of the chapter for
And then, there was a scream.
“You don’t need to be afraid of him Theo. Trust me, please?”
“Did it work? You said his pulse hadn’t returned!” Nicolas looked to his wife, who shook her head with shock.
Luna took a deep breath, a calming breath, before finally looking at Theo closer. His magic was erratic, jumping about with feelings of concern and… and embarrassment, strangely enough. It was all there, swimming through his core. Luna adjusted her duvet back over her legs, before forgoing simplicity and pulling it up to her neck, burrowing her face into the warm blankets. The woman’s hands had been so impossibly cold, far beyond the cold of ice or snow; they had felt like death itself, and Luna just didn’t know how to react to that thought, or that feeling. It had been so strange to actually see a person, their eyes and lips and that
Harry grit his teeth, staring at the warm oak shade of Draco’s bedroom door. Not yet? What kind of-?
to confide personal things in him as well. For all Blaise knew, Harry wasn’t telling any of his secrets because they were even worse than anything Blaise had hidden away in his head. No, Harry was just fine keeping his secrets, and after so long contemplating it, Blaise didn’t see any reason to press harder to try and uncover them.
“Tom, now is
Harry bit the inside of his cheek accidentally, cursing as crumbs of the biscuit came tumbling out of his mouth as he lurched forward. Perenelle laughed, patting his shoulder as he coughed in an attempt to clear his throat.
She raised an eyebrow, siping the orange juice as he took another bite of his eggs. “Well, I surprisingly do not know nearly as much about alchemy than my husband-”
“...but would you let her go if she wanted to?”
worried about was Hogwarts’ wards picking up on the man entering the school, since neither of them were certain of if the trunk was capable of masking magical signatures, but he didn’t really think that it would be much of an issue regardless. Crouch had managed to parade around in the body of Moody for an entire year without Dumbledore doing much about it, so
“Good enough, I suppose.” He muttered, placing the vial back within its confines without a second glance. “Keep at the pace you’re going and we should have enough to keep stocked till June.”
He let out a stifled snort, finishing the bite that had been in his mouth before replying. “That’s just fine with me. I actually have a few questions for you, if you wouldn’t mind answering them.”
“I was thinking a bit closer, love.” He nodded in agreement, still caressing the large expanse of her leg and rather blatantly attempting to caress a bit further up than that as they walked. His devious exploits were squandered, however, as his darling wife opened the door to his office and shoved him inside, where Lucius found himself thoroughly reacquainted with the carpet there, which was thankfully
“There you are Hadrian, let it out.”
Harry stopped where he stood, squinting in confusion as he watched the ‘ink’ swirl around in an oblong glass jar. “How is that possible? Bottling your own magic, that is.”
That familial, comforting presence felt so earth-shatteringly real. “You’ll have that soulbond for the rest of time. Keeping too many secrets and telling too many lies is a sure way to cause you both pain for a long, long time.”
“Any part of my soul gaining a body is a concern, Harry. Especially considering he knows… well, he was created at a very inopportune time for my mental strength.”
Harry grinned, feeling warmth travel up his arms to encircle around his rotting heart as the barest flickers of a spark lit up across Draco’s cheeks, which were flushed to comedic levels.
He blinked for a moment, contemplating the thought. Was Harry… overwhelmed? Something seemed to click inside his mind, and the sleepiness from just waking up immediately dissipated as he lurched into a sitting position, pulled from his stupor by sudden panic. What was he doing, just sitting there thinking about it when something was happening to Harry? He half-stumbled half-slid off his bed as he quickly reached for the nearest shirt, intent on figuring out what was wrong and putting a stop to it as fast as he could.
There was a pause, a deafening silence, before the boy beside him shifted forward slightly, and confused green eyes came into view.
Groaning a second time, Nicolas stuffed the letter back away and took off towards the sparkling towers of the academy, purpose in his step as Rèmy shouted a rushed goodbye after him. He was particularly against speaking with Albus ever again, especially after Hadrian had discussed in full just how far the man was willing to go to achieve his goals. The cruelty was revolting to him, and in thinking back to every second that he thought kindly of Albus now made his skin crawl. However, Olympe was a dear friend that he had met while she was still a student and he was still entertaining a stint as a professor at Beauxbatons, and after she had graduated and become a professor herself, the professional relationship between them had evolved to the point that she was better described as a family friend, and for all her life had been very dear to him and Perenelle. So, despite having grown apart in the few years that he had thrown himself into study of the deathly hallows and all that came with them, he felt a certain need to assist her in the likely quite bothersome situation that Albus was undoubtedly putting her through.
Draco has cast a silencing charm on her so fast that none of them even registered it until she waved her hands indignantly, albeit silently, still looking amused. Zabini burst out laughing, followed by the rest of the group.
This time Malfoy properly laughed, tipping his head back and shutting his eyes. His shoulders shook.
Unfortunately, Kingsley was nodding along, writing something on the paper before him. Beside him, Malfoy narrowed his eyes and seemed a moment away from snarling. Harry saw his fists clench at his sides.
He broke off, remembering with a jolt of horror that Malfoy had a very strong, very valid and very disfiguring reason for being wrapped up in himself, because of Harry. He had just helplessly fallen back into his old habits of insulting the Slytherin and preparing to be insulted right back, and had momentarily forgotten their situation and setting. He wanted to curse himself for being such an irritable, blundering, insensitive prat, as Hermione always told him.
"Oh." Draco whispered.
"I was, thanks to you." He said, tone light despite the statement. "Pomfrey let me out earlier."
Literally no one cares about me, which means no one visits me, which means my tiny flat gets quite lonely. Especially at Christmas. I haven't had a present in four years. People are supposed to see each other, eat nice food together and give each other stuff that no one really cares about but it matters all the same because it's proof that someone cares. I just want someone to care. About me. Not the Mark on my arm."
Before you, he swallows hard. You think he looks ashamed, guilty- in awe.
It was a violent purple, as if the white wasn't awful enough, and it carved just around his eye, forming a path across his nose and to his cheek. From there, it split into two, branching across his cheek, falling over his jawline and disappearing under his collar.
Malfoy's colleagues hated him, society spat on him, he had no friends and
someone.He'd nearly obliterated someone from existence in a brief moment of anger. Malfoy, gone forever. No Malfoy. No one to tease or insult or stare at when he's not looking.
That was harsh, Harry thought, as he winced. He waited for Malfoy to explode into a fiery pool of rage but was sorely disappointed when Malfoy only stared for a few moments, before rising and striding from the room. He looked oddly resigned, as if he were used to such treatment.
Harry didn't really know what to say that. How do you tell your rival who you almost killed that you're sorry? The reminder of what he'd done was fresh in his mind. He knew he was sorry, but the question was, would Malfoy believe him? "Oh...good."
"Look! Wait, is that Malfoy? Sorry,
"Malfoy?" He asks, almost timidly.
You feel as if you've been living in the dark, unable to see, and now you catch a glimpse of a light, as if you're seeing yourself for the first time and you've accepted who you are.
Did Malfoy trust him?
Zabini's face dawned with sudden realisation. He leaned even closer. "Unless you want to do doing something else? Perhaps you want to... go to him? Be his partner? Cure his loneliness?"
"Don't." Draco hissed, but his eyes were burning with tears.
"Malfoy, you... what's wrong with you?"
said it was true? Is it not enough that you had to have your misconceptions thrown at you when the Dark Lord moved into your house? How the hell are you supposed to be
Harry actually thought he would be sick at the thought, and the guilt that followed and engulfed him.
But today that didn't happen.
Draco barely spared him a glance, his eyes bloodshot and tired, as if he hadn't slept at all last night and had cried instead. His gaze was distant and desolate, the familiar emptiness returning. He continued to quietly pack his possessions tidily into the box in that meticulous way of his.
Harry's hands ran lightly across Draco's pale hair, their lips joined perfectly in a sweet kiss as they breathed one another in.
"Thank you." Draco whispered.
Instead, you cowered in the corner and cried. You used your wand on countless innocents and made them scream in agony, all because a madman threatened you. You cried alone because you couldn't fix a cupboard and you couldn't kill an old man and you couldn't do anything. And now you know how it feels to be shunned, and hated, the way you used to hate others.
.'" He simpered, voice affected into a high-pitched whine. "Or is it just because I'm a Malfoy?"
and everyone else he lost. But then he thought of Hermione and the Weasleys and Neville and Luna and everyone he had now, and he couldn't imagine being without them or being without anyone. For the first time ever, Harry Potter realised all that he did have when met by someone who had none of that.
But he didn't look quite right.
Harry didn't say anything because this was true, though that wasn't the only reason he had come here.
He shut the door behind him and was shocked to see both his and Malfoy's desk empty. But the sound of crying only grew. Well, perhaps crying wasn't the word- it was more like gasping. Harry glances around, so intent on finding Malfoy that he managed to completely miss what was right in front of him.
George, who seemed to have grown the fondest of Draco despite everything, made a veiled comment about what happened, and Harry just snapped. He didn't mean to yell at them until his voice was hoarse and his eyes were brimming with angry tears but he was just so fed up with being held continually accounted for, and reminded of, something he'd stupidly done in the past - something he was trying to undo.
It started out with small things.
You're not sure why you came, and you tell him so. He frowns. It seems he has no idea what to say.
He frowned. Maybe it was too soon for that. He didn't want to scare Draco off by rushing into things as he always did and confessing his sudden undying love to a man he wasn't even dating. He would settle for caring a good deal about Draco for now and go from there. That was better.
Draco lived here, in this dump. Draco was on the other side of this door. Draco was close to him... Harry could have screamed at the nervous tension this brought.
Memory Draco had pulled his wand out, and Harry watched as flowers suddenly appeared in his hand after a murmured spell. Merlin, he was actually about to do it. So why hadn't he? What had gone wrong?
But the image kept playing.
his eyebrows. Draco grinned.
Draco took a halting step towards Harry, then another, and another.
And it became routine for Harry Malfoy-Potter to pull Draco Malfoy-Potter close to him as snow began to fall on Christmas Day.
Harry stood, anger thrumming in his chest, and prepared to leave when Dawlish's next words halted him completely.
Then, suddenly, he had turned back around, face stricken. "What if he tells me to get lost? I would, in his place. Everything I've ever said to him, he'll just be repulsed!" He whispered furiously to Zabini, who shrugged.
And Harry didn't like that. It meant he had no idea what to expect.
Malfoy just stared at him as if he were the dimmest person he knew. He raised his hands in an aggressive manner, despite the gesture itself being defensive.
"Don't worry, Dawlish was suspended for two months for 'inappropriate, unprofessional and prejudiced comments towards a colleague'. Dawlish is a prat, so... he deserved it." Silence followed his words, and Harry glanced back over to see Malfoy with a peculiar expression on his face. He looked to be biting the inside of his mouth hard and his face was slowly gaining colour.
Inside a long, thin box sat a hawthorn wand, precisely 10", with a unicorn core.
"Explain to me what happened to Malfoy's desk."
"You're not allowed to work here anymore."
"It was Dawlish." He said. "I saw him leaving the office this morning just as I arrived, but he left before I could do anything."
Draco drew back and raised one haughty, aristocratic eyebrow at him. Harry was insanely happy to see his old personality returning.
stuck to, and he never wore patterned clothing. He always fell quiet when Harry wore patterned clothing, which he often did after seeing that it bothered Malfoy. He had considered that perhaps Malfoy simply just didn't like patterned clothing rather than having a natural aversion to its design, but the outcome was still the same.
But he is special. So, so special. You can see it in the way his green eyes are alight and the way his body moves to the music, so awkward yet so uncaring, and the way he tosses his head back when he laughs. You want to make him laugh like that, want him to look at you the way he looks at those he loves, like you mean something to him.
to possess considering that it was a Muggle invention, was tipped on its side, pens spread across a disarrayed pile of paper, and scattered across the floor. His clock, also Muggle, was a mere ten minutes out, though Harry knew how infuriating that could be. His immaculately pressed robes, which he always folded with care and draped over the back of his chair when he got to work, was crumpled on the floor. It struck Harry that Malfoy had no photos on his desk of anyone he loved.
Draco looked around the highly decorated hall, as if afraid someone would see him. It really was quite unfortunate that Hermione had set the camera up there, as Draco was now stood for them all to see. They were in the far corner, tucked away and secluded. Harry assumed that the three of them had just skipped the Draco part when they'd watched it back, because he'd never seen this footage before.
Harry knew the feeling, as these words sparked images of Sirius and Fred and Dobby and Remus and Tonks and his
His gaze was fixed on the ropy block of flats before him. It was the only building that could be a flat, as the rest were shops or small business firms. The flats really were ugly and in awful condition. There was graffiti everywhere, cracked windows, peeling paint, and scarily precarious looking walls.
Malfoy still looked furious. It was an almost exciting thing to see emotion in his eyes again.
It's this that makes you grin suddenly, an action you haven't been able to replicate for quite some time.
"You're right. It'll be okay."
"What... how-" he tried but seemed to abandon the effort later on. Instead, he began to open the present, his gaze suspicious.
In the doorway stood Draco Malfoy.
He has a scar as well. It defines him, just as the snake on your arms defines you.
Dawlish gave Kingsley and Harry an honest looking smile, as well as a nod. "Well, Sir, I'm afraid it was all a complete accident." he began, sounding so genuine that Harry had to catch himself, "One of my recent assignments resulted in me taking a criminal into custody, and unfortunately he tried to escape while on the fourth floor. He ran into Malfoy's office and I was forced to use violence as a means to detain him, resulting in the mess."
Harry knocked on the door with his free hand, the other carefully holding a wrapped-up gift, albeit a small, compact one. The door made the same creaking sound as it did before, especially when Draco opened it and almost reeled back at the sight of Harry. He looked even worse than he had before, with what seemed to be sleep deprivation joining the mix, but Harry had never seen anyone so beautiful.
One was thin, a stark white on his already pale face, curving around his left eyebrow and following the contour of his sharp cheekbone, pulling the eye outward ever so slightly. The second was raised and thicker, cutting though his mouth and twisting the lips unnaturally.
"My parents don't love me. They just want me to be a Death Eater, which I don't want, which is why I refused the Mark over summer. I was crying in the bathroom that day because they sent me a rather nasty letter about what a disappointment I am and threatened to disown me. They obviously hadn't heard that I'd already gone to Dumbledore for protection already."
"Oh, Draco, darling, I remember you there. You were dashing!" Parkinson cried. "I do distinctly recall, however, that you were rather displeased at having to be my partner. You were always watching Pot-"
His eyes flared wider, if that was even possible, and he took a single, jerking gasp. His terrified gaze was suddenly fixed on Harry with such an intensity that Harry almost shrank back. He hadn't seen so much emotion in those eyes in the entire time they'd been colleagues.
"Shut up." He said. "I said that's what
"Malfoy?" he said, gingerly crouching down in front of the man. Malfoy didn't acknowledge his presence, and probably wasn't aware of his presence. He just kept hyperventilating.
"Breathe. It's okay. You're okay." Harry intoned, taking slow, deep breaths in the hope that Malfoy would copy them. "We can fix this. There's no danger. Everything is okay. Just breathe."
"No, he's just torturing their muggle family members instead."
He supposed that the chaos of war had made him enjoy a quiet, organised life far more than he thought he would. He was fairly certain he wasn't OCD, though. He didn't hate it when he did something abnormal; he simply felt more comfortable in a routine.
Draco was stood by his desk, one hand pressed to his mouth and the other efficiently picking up everything on his desk and placing them in a box. His half of the room was sparse, everything stripped bare of Draco's belongings. The timetable was gone, his papers were stacked in the box and his Auror robes were nowhere to be seen.
Harry's eyes widened at the blatant show of self-deprecation. Why would Malfoy tell him that? And surely Malfoy was surrounded by friends. Parkinson had probably been in there every day, kissing him all better and sobbing in that dramatic way of hers. Harry frowned at the thought of Malfoy kissing someone else.
You realise that through this tumultuous period of change and new beginnings, that you haven't even spared him a thought. This doesn't upset you as much as it would have at the start of the year.
on me, I hate that."
Finally, it becomes too much, and his eyes are still roving over you hungrily, and you watch him back, waiting and hoping- until one day, you snap, and you pull him forwards during a party, your hands clutching his shirt collar, and you press your lips to his, as passionate as you dare-
He was met with silence. Malfoy just stared at him. Then, he said, "But why?"
Malfoy actually stepped back at the words, as if shocked Harry had even thought it. Harry was shocked he'd thought it as well. This was not his place to bring up his sob story. And besides, who would be grateful to have Lucius Malfoy as a father, who buys his son bodyguards? Who would be grateful to know Lucius Malfoy, full stop?
"And since having a wand is required to be an Auror..."
No one made a sound as Harry got to his feet, slowly making his way to Draco by the door. Draco's head was now bowed, hair concealing his features. Harry approached him quietly and paused right in front of him.
December 25th, 2001
Malfoy broke off, his eyes unusually misty and his face white in the wash of light. He turned away and grabbed the railings tightly.
He kept this up for a few minutes, beginning to wonder whether he should call for some medical help, when the hand clasped tightly in his own relaxed. Malfoy's shuddering was now subsiding, and his breathing was evening out as his panic alleviated. Harry thanked anyone who was listening that this was almost over.
"Because... I can't. You don't want that; you don't want me." The tone of his voice made Harry want to cry all over again and throw himself to his knees in front of him and beg him to forgive him and kiss his fingers and pretty lips.
You know that you have tiny scars across your face where the chandelier shattered, little shards of glass embedding themselves in your skin painfully. It had taken Mother hours to remove them all.
He sighed, as if collecting himself and turned away from Harry and towards the door.
Harry thought, thinking of how Malfoy always left alone and never received any personal owls or notices.
Hermione, rather uncharacteristically, giggled at him and seemed to be quite taken with the curls she'd charmed in her hair and the lovely dress she'd been wearing. Harry had no doubt that he'd be seeing those curls again in the near future.
"Potter?" he rasped.
"No, actually, I think living here has been positive because there not a thing I can do about the instability and everything. Although I make sure that I keep everything I can organised."
stay!"
But the conversation had already taken a nastier tone, and Harry was helpless to stop it. It suddenly dawned on him that Draco's animosity was fuelled by his defensive nature. It was his defense mechanism, to lash out and distract others from himself. It wasn't a healthy reflex.
And from then on, Harry vowed to show Malfoy he was cared about.
But just as he was about to knock again, there came a scraping sound, and the door was being pushed open.
"But, why are you with them then?" Harry choked out.
He laughs, and leans in to kiss you again. You let him.
This is what he meant by your 'fire', you realise.
This strikes you in the exact wrong way, because why should you talk to him, when he hasn't bothered to give you the time of day this year? He was the one who left you cold in the corridor, your hand outstretched and sobs racking your body, and
Here Harry had to laugh, even though his own embarrassment warred with the amusement. Malfoy raised a perfect eyebrow at him expectantly. "I punched Dawlish in the face."
Harry was beginning to suspect that Parkinson was a bit drunk; so was Draco, because he laughed and the uncomfortable expression evaporated.
You feel strange when you look at him, and your first, involuntary thought is
As he paused, Harry held his breath.
"I'm surprised you don't already know, Potter." Harry flinched at the use of his surname, and Draco looked equally pained, but he continued. His voice was quiet and void of emotion. "A new law is being ratified decreeing that no witch or wizard bearing the Dark Mark is to have a wand."
But Malfoy didn't appear to notice his staring, and his next question caught Harry entirely off guard.
Harry's breath left him in a rush. For a moment he could only stare at the other boy and will himself to calm down and not punch him. Yell at him, yes, but punch him, no. Anger boiled in his belly frighteningly fast. Of course, Malfoy was still the same prejudiced git he'd always been. Maybe he deserved to be disfigured, if he was still a racist ferret. All those sad, self-pitying words earlier... and to think Harry had actually sympathised.
You don't reach out your hand again, because he won't take it, you know that.
Harry didn't know whether to press further or to wallow in his guilt, but it seemed Malfoy had decided to answer his question after all. "Sometimes. Yeah, sometimes it gets lonely."
Draco grinned back then suddenly fell silent. His expression slid into something surprisingly coy, almost reminiscent of the sneaky looks he used to sport in Hogwarts when he thought he'd bested Harry (which wasn't often). His mouth curled into a sly smile, maddeningly seductive. His hands remained clasped around Harry's neck, so that they were now close enough to lean in, and ...
Harry also began to call him Draco. It showed that he cared about him as a person, rather than just his name and his past. In return, Draco called him Harry.
You look down at him, and your smile widens. You tell him that his hair looks nice today and that you'll see him around. You feel only satisfaction when he gapes after you.
He was invited to all the following gatherings, and not just at Harry's insistence. His friends had actually become fond of Draco, especially after he profusely apologised for everything that happened in school.
And damn, if that wasn't the saddest thing Harry had ever heard.
"What?" He asked sharply. He barely recognised his own voice.
Draco cut him off. "Spare me, Harry. I've been let down by enough people in my life. For me, the worst part of all this is that you actually made me feel, for the first time in years, that I was worth something. That I deserved happiness. Or, at least that's what I thought it was."
Zabini suddenly moved away, his hand resting casually on the table behind Draco. He smirked. "You know what? Do it. I dare you.  Ask Potter to dance, make him feel better, tell him how you feel. Tell your father it was all a joke, whatever works." Draco looked at him, but couldn't seem to say anything, which shocked Harry. The silver-tongued Slytherin, contemplating asking Harry to dance? Harry had absolutely no memory of this whatsoever.
-------------
Harry stood still, staring at him. He was shocked into silence, utterly stunned by both the immense sadness in the words, and the fact that Malfoy would
would tell each other, like how he had loads of work or he had bought himself an ice cream for the first time in three years. Harry secreted away that information, memorising the flavour.
This time Draco looked at him. Harry's heart dropped further at the coolness in his eyes and the... betrayal. But what had he done?
Harry quickly cast a silencing charm on the office, so that no one overheard. He was completely out of his element. Fighting criminals with a mere stick of wood he could do, but comforting his old-school-rival-turned-office-partner? What the hell? This wasn't right. Malfoy wasn't supposed to have feelings, wasn't supposed to need comforting, particularly by Harry. Because if he did have feelings, then Harry was about to feel hella guilty.
Nothing I can say or do will make up for this, but you have to believe me when I say that I didn't know what I was signing! I would
"Of course I do." He began tentatively, waiting for Malfoy's mood to shift to anger. "I probably understand better than anyone."
"Inspecting future prospects."
Draco crosses his arms and stares at him from the other side of the table. If he didn't know any better he would say he was glaring. "Okay, but what about Cassowary's comet then? Still not even a whispers in any of these books."
? What do you think is stopping me from grabbing you right now and delivering you to him?"
Draco was about to get up when he heard a door slam shut loudly from downstairs. It wasn't long after that until he heard yelling. Shivers ran up his back at the all too familiar noises. He pressed his back against the bed frame and held his hands over his ears to try and block it out. At the manor, all he had to do was go inside his room. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case here.
A wistful smile tugged at Harry's lips as it always did when his godfather's misdeeds during school were told. It would have been hilarious to watch.
They are
"It's... fine. Just go to sleep."
Malfoy looked over at him. "What's so amusing, Potter?" He sneered but it only made Harry want to laugh more. How had he never made this connection before!
and it clicked to Harry. Ron and Hermione increasingly broke out into conspiracies about what had happened to Katie and if Draco was involved. He wondered if he should mention it to the blonde.
"Can you see them?"
Vincent took his chance to shake his wand violently and tossing Draco around like a game of hacky sack, a few times which made Draco exceedingly close to banging his head back on the floor. He could have guessed they were trying to knock him out.
She had the most prominent adult figure in his life up until I was eight years old. His father found out she had been teaching him muggle literature and fired her on the spot. Draco still remembers his father throwing them into the fire as soon as the door slammed shut. He forced him to watch them crinkle into ash despite the tears that were rolling down his face. His temper involving blood-purity was always short with him after that. Hexing for stepping even the slightest out of line or locked in his room for hours on end.
Draco rolled his eyes and snorted. "Right. Of course."
"I said I'm
"Give it here."
"On what?"
Draco fell silent for awhile. What Potter was saying made sense but that didn't mean his mind would accept it. Potter was just making things up out of his arse. He wouldn't be saying that if he saw the mark on his arm or the evil psychopath taking residency in his home.
(See the end of the chapter for
he couldn't have told. That was crazy. Even Lucius wasn't that crazy-
"I'm sure Dumbledore will think of something. He wouldn't let that happen."
There wasn't an index, causing Draco to read the entire book. So far there had only been mention of visible effects. Random vomiting and dizzy spells were common side effects which made filtering everything else out hard. He had to have gone through at least a third of the library already. What he needed was something from the restricted section, yet without a note, he had no other way of getting past the security enhancements. There would be no way his teachers would ever even consider it either with a tainted last name such as Malfoy.
Draco groans and walks over to her couch without answering. Making sure his shoes aren't touching, he lays down, taking up the whole couch in the process. His arms cover his face dramatically.
the same thing. You're the chocoholic. You out of all people should know the difference."
Harry smirked and crossed his arms victoriously.
DRACO
Malfoy was standing in front of the bed and fixing the sheeting the sheets when he walked in. His head swirled around quickly at the noise of the door opening. The movement caused his un-gelled, blonde hair to dangle in an angle the sun caught perfectly through the window.
Harry mumbles something underneath his breath. "But...he put you under the cruciatus curse? He's a deatheater. What are you even talking about? Of course he's
They were in the library again. This time they were both huddled over books clear of tears.
Harry's gaze finally breaks from Draco to his best friend and he shook his head. "He wasn't
Draco flushed. “Sorry…”
about it." Malfoy's hands tightened into fists, undeterred by the calm in his voice.
"Yes, Potter?"
"Hiding, 'Alfoy?"
Draco physically bit hit tongue to prevent himself from lashing out. He wanted nothing more to turn around and hex the redhead into the ground for wounding his pride. It was like a snake coiling back, ready to pounce on its's prey.
anything. That makes you just as bad as the rest of them. "
With the start of November came an avalanche of homework. Teachers seemed to think they needed to start cramming for the end-of-the-semester exams despite them being weeks away. Draco didn't mind very much (only after his detentions had subsided) because it gave something solid for his brain to focus on other than Brambles's reappearance, his father's absence, his mother's lack of communication, or for Merlin's sake, Harry's impeccably messy hair.
Draco pushed his chair back and looked around the packed library. He was hexed, he knew it.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry gripped the stair railing to pull himself off the floor. His gut was aching along with his jaw. At least most of the bruises were covered, so that was a plus side. The fewer questions the better.
"That you've finally decided to withdraw from Hogwarts and pursue your life long dream of starting a bat dung farm?" Snipped Pansy. They had just as much hate for him as Draco did. He was a leech on all their sides.
The gargoyle didn't budge.
He had to remember Harry didn't mean it.
yikes I can't write sorry ://
"I don't get it. The Festival of Wonder is supposed to be a wizarding holiday! How is there
"Fine. So be it. See if I share any of my sweets with you, prick." Draco says, cradling his redding cheek. "I was
, Malfoy. Some of us aren't rich and have house elves to do everything for them."
"What are you doing here if you aren't going to study?" Draco finally snaps when her finger drumming reaches its peak. She was ignoring the book she dragged out under the title 'Magical Remedies and Broken Charms' and was instead opting to stare at Granger over Draco's shoulder a couple tables down. Draco figured this was another one of her hopeless quests for 'true love'. Not that Draco was much better.
Draco huffs with a glare. "I did
"Salazar's name you're annoying." He says though it doesn't take much damage with the tiniest hint of a laugh pulling at the corner of his mouth. "It builds up your immune system from unexpected curses or hexes. Might help with whatever if with your stomach until you decide to man up and go to the hospital wing."
The footsteps came closer and stopped within a couple feet in front of him. He refused to acknowledge his own existence and instead took to glaring at the Gryffindor's shoes as if they themselves had wronged him.
Harry's mind automatically flew to Draco. They had snuck out a few more times since the night at the lake and he was finding himself to become increasingly addicted to the blonde's presence. He was smart, witty, and surprisingly mischievous after Harry had finally cracked his goody-two-shoes shell. Their midnight visits had quickly had become a highlight of his er- well, night.
At the mention of his headmaster's name, Harry's eyes cracked open. The three of them were standing at the foot of his bed. Both Remus' and Poppy's face were pulled into concerned grimaces as they conversed. Ron has pulled up a chair and sitting right next to him. He was the first to notice Harry's awareness.
Draco smiled warmly at the old woman behind the Honeydukes trolley. He reached inside his pocket where a small bag filled with coins and began counting them out once by one.
"That'll be fifteen galleons and seven sickles."
"And why is that?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry nodded stiffly. He had honestly no idea why this topic of conversation was being brought up now.
"I... don't know. It was dark. I got hit by a bunch of spells that day."
There was Cedric.
"Do you want to make that three weeks of detention?"
The two waited in comfortable silence. Harry had been taken to using a nearby bench under the bus stop. He could have been mistaken for a sleeping homeless man if Draco didn't know any better. For the secound time that day, he couldn't help but stare in pure wonder of the beauty of the boy. He had curled my dark locks, that always danced in between a black and brown so that they hung in more waves than curls. His features were small and perfectly related; his nose deliciously interrogative at the tip. Harry's brows and lashes, drawn in a darker hue, gave touches of character and distinction.
"Spit it out before this ends up being last our last encounter. Three against one, right?"
Also, sorry this is sorta a filter?? I PROMISE a kiss is coming very soon... I just can't say when yet.
He pulled himself up with the stone walls with an elegance taught to him by years of etiquette tutors. He swooped down to grab his wand and bag that fell down with him. A couple books had escaped and flown down a couple meters down the hall.
“No, it isn’t. But it's tragic and that what makes it beautiful.”
Draco narrowed his eyes. "Aside from mental damage?"
Unwelcome thoughts of Cedric come in his mind. Harry didn't know much about his own sexuality but ever since the night at the graveyard he didn't like to think about it. It was just something else he was buried deep inside him long ago. Not because of some internalized homophobia, but because of some crazy physiological fear of attachment. And besides no matter what, announcing who you are to the world was terrifying, because what if the world doesn't like you back?
"Ok, I'll climb up first and just open the door for you, okay?" Harry asked. Draco was hesitant. Harry might looked healed but he doubted he had regained enough of his strength to climb the rope. Draco had seen how much he had struggled to carry his books back to the inn earlier that day. He was still weak and no doubt suffering some sort of fatigue from the fast-paced medicine.
Draco's wand tapped the side of his leg. The more the boy talked the more he wanted to hex him. His 'he would have to be the better person' thing he had going on didn't count when the person in question was already an utter ass. But Draco had to admit, he had a way of having people hang onto his words.
"I'm fine." Harry shuts the book a little harder than necessary and looks up to where Remus was holding a cup of tea and leaning against the kitchen island. The man had been treating him like a ticking time bomb since his outbreak yesterday morning. It almost made him wish he
"I said
For the millionth time, he wondered if his parents would even notice his absence. The clock on the nightstand read five. There were only a few hours until they ate dinner and his father definitely know by then. Draco's blood was cold at the thought of his reaction. Why couldn't bloody Potter let him go home when he wanted? He was smart enough to could have figured something out. Draco had to stop himself from jumping out the window.
"Shove off,
Remus' eyebrow quirked, as did Ron's. He hadn't heard this part of the story yet. Pomfrey was scribbling hastily on her clipboard which made his stomach squirm.
"I got hit. By a curse."
Words: 2517
"Come on mate, Remus is going to want to see you."
He looks back over his shoulder where he can just faintly see Draco boarding the train with an expression on his face Harry couldn't place.
Harry tore his burning gaze away and shrugged his shoulders. "We could search the Hogwarts library when term starts. Your collection is a paperclip compared to the school's."
"Magic is instinctual and very possessive of the wizard it lives inside. It's a living thing seeking to protect itself. Therefore it protects the wizard from harm. I'm sure you've already figured that much out for yourself. It's why we heal faster from ordinary humans." Dumbledore elaborates as he unwraps a candy from the bowl on his desk. Harry nods for him to continue. "So, naturally, magic refuses to hurt itself. Same reason you cannot cast an unforgivable without the real intent to do so or you cannot turn your own wand against yourself."
He ripped off a leg of the now inanimated frog. "What's in the envelope?"
“A fight," he chooses his words carefully like he was trained to do. "And I regret it. Don't mistake me as petty, though. But if he hadn’t commenced it, I wouldn’t have been incited. My words were vile and I think I might have gone too far."
He throws it and Harry catches it with years of seeker training. "Trying to outright poison me now? A new low, really. Even for you."
He decided to split the toast between him and Hedwig, seeing as she can go out and hunt for herself, and saved the rest for himself. He ate as fast as his stomach allowed him too. Before he knew it, his plate was empty, leaving him with only a bellyache.
"Did you not hear what I said?" Draco seethes. "This is my goddamn house. Leave me alone. I don't need
"Nothing," Harry says. "No one."
Draco doesn't correct him on how wrong the statement was. There was no point. He would only hear what he wanted to hear, just like his father. He knew fair well what a life was worth to the person he had been forced allegiance to. The memory of tortured screams from the cellar as he ate his dinner still haunted his dreams.
His heart beats fast against his chest when their cynical and disgusted gazes wash over him.
"No." He answers simply, "But it's not like I have much choice, do I?" He chuckles and gives a smile that doesn't quite reach his eyes. Draco was about to comment on it when Harry cut him off.
His throat felt clogged and his brain was racing. He didn't know if he had just overstepped or not. Draco refused to think about what Harry and his next conversation would include.
It's Harry's turn to draw a deep breath. The words leave his mouth almost in slow motion. "Cedric. The boy I brought back with me after the third task." He didn't look up to see Remus' reaction. He soldiered on. If he didn't spit the words out now he doesn't think he would have the strength to do it again for a couple decades. "I wanted to curse that rat's body until it was unrecognizable. But I didn't, you know why? The best revenge is living well. Nothing has infuriated Voldemort more. Let someone else do the task, Remus. You aren't going to gain anything from it. Trust me."
Draco hissed and looked around to see if anyone had heard him. Was he crazy talking about him in such a public place? Or was he simply that self-centered he didn't think it would matter?
Ron and Harry both nodded furiously.
Draco seemed to know exactly what he was planning and shook his head. "No. Don't even think about it."
Harry looked back to where Draco was standing a couple feet behind him. It surprised to hear him speak up seeing as it seemed he was being ignored. He was more distant today than he had been all year.
"Bollocks. You just vomited in my toilet and on the edge of passing out. You
The button off his robe came undone and slipped off his arms onto the floor. Draco at that moment was never more glad he had learned to luck his shirts in or else his embarrassment would be even worse.
Remus sets his cup back on the table at Harry's frightening glare. He twiddles with the loose strings on the end of his jumper sleeve as he tries to not to meet it. He gulped rather timidly which Harry found strangely timid on a thirty-year-old man. "He didn't want you to know."
"Manipulating is a harsh word... He knows what he's doing. Fair enough I would probably be safer somewhere else but he's thinking of war. Long-term stuff. He has his reasons. I can't sacrifice everyone else's lives for my happiness."
Draco felt something in his chest break. Draco knew abuse like the back of his hand but his father had never left a physical mark on him (if you didn't count the mark on the forearm). Something about seeing if front of him made it seem all too vivid.
"You ready?" Draco whispered to the smaller boy beside him. Harry was looking down at his feet with his jaw clenched and hands shaking mildly as they gripped the edge of his shirt. He was obviously nervous about returning to that ghastly place so soon. Draco couldn't blame him, he felt the same way about returning to the Manor. His stomach dropped at just the thought.
(See the end of the chapter for
Yatin only hummed. "No, not yet. Maybe in the future though. I heard it can be sold in some countries for quite a catch. Of course I couldn't be caught dead doing the dirty work. I'll be willing to hire you of course. If you desired."
Harry bit his lip. He clearly was nervous but still obliged. "Fine..."
"Oh, you're not getting away that easy!
He flipped the page. It was only halfway through the album yet the pictures had come to a sudden stop. Harry's heart goes numb thinking about why.
"Thestrals are, undeservedly I tell yeh, known as omens o' misfortune an' aggression by many wizards because they are visible on'y ter those who have witnessed death at least once or cause their grim, gaunt an' ghostly look. But they don' really mean anyone any harm, do they? Nah, they're gentle creatures really... "
"We better get going if we want to get to get there on time..."
Harry backs up hesitantly, suddenly nervous and scared. Out of the corner of his eyes he sees the boy subconsciously pat his back pocket for his wand. It only caused the back of Draco's eyes to burn hotter.
He wanted Harry to leave. The other's words were only making the stones in my stomach heavier. There have been too many touchy-feely moments between the two of them the past few days. One more and he'll be ready to jump off a cliff.
There's a deep understanding when their eyes meet. "Ok. As long as it helps. Try to come back at a reasonable time, though, okay? There's no point if you miss out on your sleep entirely."
Hagrid came back a little after that with the thestrals for each group. It didn't take a genius to notice the way Hagrid eyed Draco carefully when handing Harry the chunks of meat to guide it away.
"Draco."
He shoves a chocolate frog in Harry's hands with a demand to eat. In his other is an already opened envelope he seems frantic over.
Harry didn't know to continue on with that. It was like talking to a brick wall. "He seems to like you," he points out, talking about the creature. Draco only nodded and threw another chunk of meat at it. It stumbled back a few steps trying to catch it.
"Oh, um, on my back it's mostly some bruises. Maybe some cuts. My ribs and ankle hurt on the inside." He was clearly embarrassed by having Draco simplify it for him. Heat blossomed in Draco's chest all the way down to his toes when he saw the faint pink blossom across Potter's cheeks.
"Well, he should have thought about that before delaying coming to me. It's his life we're talking about here, Weasley. You can bring him his notes and classwork if you're so worried about him failing. If I remember correctly you have transfiguration in ten minutes."
"Mate? Are you changing?"
The mug was pushed back toward him. "Drink it. Your body can't cry and drink at the same time."
Harry eyed the creature carefully. It reminded him of his stunt last year. It's boney frame sent chills of guilt to line his stomach. He cursed Hagrid for picking one of the worst animals possible.
Draco considers the repercussions. He might be able to escape without his father ever noticing he was gone. He could practically feel the electricity of the crucious curse in his stomach. It might just have been the fear, but at this point, were they not the same? His father didn't care what he used as long as it got Draco to listen. On the other hand, Ferris would more likely smell the blood impurity on him. The Dark Lord wouldn't hesitate to kill him.
"Are you sure?"
2/28/19
It technically wasn't a complete lie. The stars did help. Just not in the way neither of them could expect.
