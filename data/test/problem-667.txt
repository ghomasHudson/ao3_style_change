“If you say so Potter.” Draco smirked instead. He eyed Harry’s presents again, noting that, considering Harry had a huge number of friends and fans - and of course the Weasley’s as his claimed family, he didn’t have many gifts. “Do the redheads not send you gifts, or your fans?”
They did as Draco explained - cautiously, and much to Ron's surprise, it worked. Their potion was now yellow, and ready for the next step. Harry tried to thank Draco, but he was too busy talking with Blaise, and he didn't make eye contact with him agian after that.
“I’m still reeling from what Silas did. I can’t believe–” Draco shook his head, unable to finished his own sentence. There was a cold wind of uncertainty regarding Mr Avery that he didn’t like leaving unchecked. The boy was corrupted, ignorant, and dangerous with his opinions and beliefs. Draco hoped that Harry could get through to the boy, but he was worried.
Harry didn’t lose his smile, but he made a mental note that he needed no more fire whiskey tonight. He’d dated enough men to know how it goes: you get drunk, you kiss, maybe shag, then wake up regretting last night. He really didn’t plan on doing that with Draco; it would be so awkward if he had a one-night fling with a work colleague, but it was on his mind - no doubt about that.
“You’re ‘ery han’some.” Draco murmured, his eyes still closed … but then he groaned and opened his eyes.
The long response time and the disbelief he could feel radiating of Tau’s words, convinced him that he wasn’t going crazy. No, Harry was certain now that Tau’s opinion of Elliot, was his opinion of himself - or to some degree at least. What else could it be?
Harry laughed agian, but Draco knew that laugh. It was the 'funny you should mention that laugh'. Harry palmed it off with a single word, 'later.'
The Great Hall was already decorated for the Christmas holidays, students excited about going home for the festive season while they enjoyed breakfast. It was Saturday December the eighteenth, a week until Christmas, and the train would be leaving Hogsmeade in a few hours to take most of the students home.
It took a long shower, and those pressing, unwanted thoughts that plagued you the moment you wanted to sleep. Why did his mind do that – become the most active when he wanted it to shut the fuck up?
Harry knew that Draco was confused, it was expected, but he could also see the appreciation in coin-grey eyes. He was relieved to have something to direct the focus away from himself, even if he was curious about his own gift… that could wait a moment.
Yes, I'm quite horrified actually, but in the process ... she accidentally revealed her own sleeping habits. Suffice to say it's been sorted now, but I doubt Ginny will be speaking to me for a while.
Harry laughed, causing Draco to raise both his eyebrows.  Harry almost dropped his plate, having to sat it down while tried to stop laughing.
“Course not!” Harry shook his head, pouring two glasses of the tawny coloured Whiskey. He handed a glass to Draco before sitting down in the arm chair opposite him. They both sipped at the whiskey, and Harry felt a slight burn as the sweet flavour slipped down his throat. Draco looked around after his first sip, and over at the food. “Help yourself. I didn’t know if you had eaten or not. I didn’t bother with dinner tonight personally.”
Harry was happy to just fly past - get on with his day, but Malfoy decided to fly over to him on his Firebolt Supreme. Harry hovered a few feet away from Malfoy, and apart from being polite, he really didn’t know why he’d stopped.
“Thanks—” Harry drawled bitterly, removing the charm on his top canines. He felt rather stupid now to be honest. “Did you just come to insult my costume or-”
Suddenly music started playing. Both Draco and Harry felt almost like they had been possessed, like they were in a vivid dream like state.
“I’m sure you have some likeable qualities Draco, or else, I must be mad to enjoy your company.” Said Harry, bravely daring to step into what could be dangerous ground with Draco. Harry knew the blond wouldn’t accept pity, but he had no idea how he would react to his backhanded compliment.
Harry didn’t have to wait too long for Tau’s reply. He sipped his milk as he read the words upon the parchment.
Harry lifted his head, blinking as he repositioned his glasses, realising he had indeed fallen to sleep at Draco’s bedside. His back ached from the position he’d been in – his head resting on the bed while still sitting in the red armchair he’d conjured.
Their eyes met again, this time with loud unsaid words that resonated through Draco’s body. Those green eyes glowed in the fire light and looked at him with such conviction. Draco could be mistaken, but Harry
Draco was looking at him, waiting for his answer, and Harry caught the way his eyes flicked down nervously… Was Draco nervous? Harry then saw the blond swallow as he made eye contact with him – uncertain maybe? Harry smiled at him, making his decision.
“I’m sorry … for whatever I said to piss you off earlier. Here, I just wanted to give you this.” Harry handed the short letter out to Draco, his body already turned in preparation to leave once the blond took it.
“Unless you plan on aiding me in the shower…” Fuck – Draco thought, wrong choice of words! “Which I sincerely warn you against even thinking about, then I suggest you move away from the door.”
“I’m okay Draco, really!” Harry repeated for the third time. He really didn’t want to discuss his mental instabilities. “I told you, it was just a bad flash back – a PTSD episode maybe. I haven’t had one in years, but this is why I try not to talk about past events.” Harry toyed with his mug, looking at the reflections on the porcelain surface. His episode had past, he just wanted to pretend it never happen really.
Draco cursed himself for his moment of weakness. What the fuck was he thinking? The friendly battle was one thing, but what the bloody hell was that at the end? He had to stay away from Potter, the risk of doing something he’d regret was too great in the man presence… he had, for a moment of foolishness on his part, wanted to kiss the man again… and in front of the students and the other two teachers. ‘
Harry caught up to Draco once again – and before the man even had a chance to enter the castle, Harry had used wandless magic on the doors so that Draco couldn’t open them. Draco spun around when they wouldn’t open, and the rage was so obvious in his tear stain face as he glared murderously at Harry.
Pushing through the crowd urgently, Harry gasped when he saw Miss Camellia Nixon – a fifth year Gryffindor, laying on the floor unconscious and looking rather pale. Minerva was forcing the Wiggenweld Potion into her mouth, but it didn’t seem to be working as they had expected.
Harry smiled lovingly at that notion. What would it really feel like to return ‘home’ to a family that wanted you, that loved you, that was all yours?
Harry’s screams followed him as he awoke; sweating, tangled in the bed sheets, each breath trembling, and the pain he’d felt in the nightmare… reduced to ghost like shivers along his nerves. The terror still had hold of him, a sickness deep in his gut, and his memories fought to substantiate reality.
“Minerva sent me to fetch you,” Draco continued, “something along the lines of, ‘Mr Potter will not be avoiding meals today!’”
After finishing with his teeth, he wrapped a towel around his waist and blushed before he’d even left his bathroom; he wasn’t a prude, but there was something embarrassing about an unrequited love interest seeing you almost naked.
“I scared it?” Draco whined in incredibility, his eyes wide in disbelief. “Father said they’re vicious, bloodthirsty beast!”
Draco frowned, why was she looking at him like that – as if she expected him to bolt from the room or something?
Once the unpleasant and disconcerting sensations of apparition had passed, and their feet had firmly reconnected with solid ground, Harry felt Draco’s warm body abruptly leave his hold. The man looked confused – possibly angry, as he surveyed his new surroundings through tear blurred eyes.
“Damn!” Harry winced awake. He rubbed his sore cheek and noes, before sitting up and rubbing at his tired eyes. He wasn’t ashamed of his fantasies, rather, he was embarrassed at himself for starting to become attracted to an imaginary figure. He didn’t know Tau outside of the parchment, and his appearance had so much range of possibility within blond hair and grey eye that he could look like… well, anything. He blamed his fantasies on the work load, and the fact that Tau had also been on his mind a lot, so it was no wonder his mind was conjuring up unhelpful reminders of his total lack of romantic or sexual aspects in his life.
-Harry comes home from work and sees Draco on the couch. He smiles at him, drops his bag, and goes to make a drink for them both. Draco follows him, wraps his arms around him, and rests his head on his shoulder. Harry turns around to kiss his husband.
Harry gave a short dry chuckle. “Askes the master of masks.” Harry shook his head. “I’m not, Draco. Its just… I was that half-cocked sixth Horcrux
Draco: "Just add two more lacewing flies, stirring counter clockwise between each one four times. Then add a drop of marmite ink. That should correct it. Next time however, I suggest you learn to read."
When Seamus threw the paper at him, he saw the heading 'The boy who lived, corrupted or cursed?' It was a full spread, full of moving photos of Harry in Diagon Alley a week ago with Draco. At homely abode, the owlery, Quidditch supplies, and the wonderful display they put on in Twifits and tattings.
Harry shook his head - no! He would leave the coffee for now; he could always make some when Draco was here if they decided on it.
Harry had caved to Draco scent, given into his hypnotic aroma and reciprocated the kiss. As soon as they parted however, Harry was confused and angry. He wanted Draco, but Draco would never change. He couldn't keep playing these messed up, ludicrous, fucking games with him ... and, Ginny was safe, consistent, and perfect for him - right?
He retched again when he heard his mother pleas and screams – the vile taste it left behind made him gag, and when green filed his vision, so did the battle of Hogwarts: Hexes – curses – screams – blood – death…
Harry dragged himself out of his thoughts, ready for a hot shower to start the long day. His first lesson started at 9:40am today – having no class first period, but it was already 8:20am so he needed to get a move on. He’d missed breakfast, but Kreacher could always bring him something later.
Ron whined to Draco - making him chuckled. This was his new friendship with Ron - playful insults and ... perfect, but he didn't respond seeing Harry was creeping him out a bit.
Harry lifted his left hand in slight panic, and managed to use wandless magic to explode the head halfway towards him. Using his wand, he tried to imprison Draco in the snow that he was causing to build up and around his legs fast.
- Harry In his room, laying on his bed looking at a news article with a moving picture of Draco chained into a chair at is trial.
Waiting in the common room was Hermione - in a beautiful red dress dotted with sparkles, and Draco - wearing the same as Harry but silver instead of green. Everyone looked amazing. When Harry and Draco shared a kiss, Hermione kissed Ron, then they made their way to the Great Hall.
-Tuesday 15th September 9pm, Draco his room laying on his bed, looking at a news article with a moving picture of Harry defending him at his trial.
recover. It was foolish, to be as worried as he was; the virus wasn’t life threatening to a powerful wizard like Draco, and he would be more then okay with Poppy looking after him. He was just being unreasonably protective of the man, and seeing him so vulnerable in that childlike state… it must have just triggered his foolishness.
“Really?” Minerva sounded shocked. “That must be difficult, what with her standing marriage to Lucius.”
“What the fuck do you want Potter? Come to take the piss, have you?” Draco screamed, suddenly brandishing his wand and firing the knockback jinx at him.
"My age." He blurted, before quickly scraping to correct his thoughts and cover up his moment of inattention. "So, Thirty? I suppose ... twenty-eight to thirty-two would be okay." Harry answered.
-Hand roamed everywhere, backs, chest, hair, face, and t-shirts forgotten as they made out- falling onto the bed.
Draco and the girls emerged with non-slip charms on their boots, they started lobbing snowballs and quickly gaining back their numbers. Students glowed green and red for their change of teams as they were hit, and It was utter madness once again. In the chaos that rained – in snowballs quite literally – Draco threw a well-aimed snowball straight at Harry’s shocked face as the raven-haired man tried to dodged and reflected a multitude of other snowballs. Harry’s chest glowed green, signalling his new team position.
Harry shrugged at Ron, just glad he agreed to give Draco a chance. Ron was even happy that he weren't snogging his sister anymore, but every time they were alone Ron would ask the same question - 'Why Malfoy?' In Ron's eyes, Harry was famous and could have any blond man he wanted. Harry even had to deal with the theatrics  .... 'But Harry - mate, it's a disaster. I can't have that git as a brother. It'll kill me. In fact ... I'm getting ill just thinking about it.' Ron proceeded to groan on the bed - like he was dying.  Yeah he'd had it all, but Ron had settled down to snide remarks and scoffs, with the occasional 'i'm watching you Malfoy' look.
Harry: *Laughed* "Dray, you idiot. We're getting married. Of course you can bloody live with me you prat. I wouldn't have any other way."
The bear sized snowball, that Harry had only managed to move about a foot in Draco’s direction, rapidly melted! A huge wave of freezing water poured down over Harry’s panting, exhausted body. Harry was both literally, and metaphorically frozen to the spot in a shivering mess.
When the song ended, Harry didn't realize who's arms he was in for a moment, just that they felt so safe around him, and the smell was comforting. When he did realize, he pulled away quickly, realizing Draco now knew more about his life than anyone one else. All his bad memories, all his trials and tribulation, all his failures and mental scars. How could face Draco? How could he answer his questions or talk about it all? He just couldn't.
“Alright! I’ll let you know.” Harry said, realising the urgency to go and find the girl. He turned and rushed off toward the Hufflepuff common room, sending a patronus message to Neville asking him to meet him there.
Harry was in fact, downstairs with a cup of tea. He didn't fancy coffee, hoping he could get some more sleep in a while before Draco noticed him missing. Unfortunately, he heard a door close upstairs put his tea down, and went up.
He flicked his wand, levitating and manipulating the tables and chairs once again as he tried to form a semicircle this time.
cold and it wasn’t just the close proximity. Any arousal he was starting to feel was instantly invaded by his growing concern.
He would try to separate the cursed moments of music and singing, from his un-cursed moments - swearing blind that they weren't real ...  but they were. Potter wasn't stupid enough to think that their actions during their cursed episodes were total fabrication. How could he deny anything when the fucking curse kept contradicting him.
“Unless your father knows how to brew a potion that doesn’t exist yet, I feel your efforts will be in vain.” She replied, deciding not to mention his father’s imprisonment – Draco was confused right now, so that news would not go over well at all.
“I don’t know Mr Potter.” Said Reece Leonard, who was fidgeting nervously and clearly worried about his friend. “She was drinking from that cup…” He pointed to the orange cup still on the floor, the remains of the liquid splashed over the stone. “…I think she took the wrong cup though, because I remember her putting it down by the brain cake and it’s still there with her lipstick on it.”
Harry had forgotten one of the most important rules of battle… Never let your guard down until the last opponent is taken out! Smirking when Harry looked at him in surprise, he realised he didn’t need to win this – he’d just needed to hit stupid Potter. Now however, his smugness was turning to anxiety as Harry moved closer to him with a smirk of his own.
Once Harry had drawn the rune to send his message, he froze ... realising that he'd added a kiss to the end. Oh Merlin!
Kreacher returned shortly after leaving, and Harry practically inhaled the first half of his ham, tomato and lettuce sandwich. Hunger wasn't something that usually bothered him all that much, but he could imagine the bread was a certain blond Slytherin's head at least - and he'd only had a piece of toast that morning after forgoing dinner last night.
Eventually Draco stood under the raining shower head, warmth cascading over him. The simple luxury of a shower that had been denied to him, on account of his illness, was now perfectly divine… much like bloody Potter!
Harry summoned a muggle notebook and pen, and began writing down the oath of silence. He’d finished before Draco returned, but sat there patiently waiting – thinking about Horcruxes and souls, things he’d hoped never to explain nor think about again.
Harry: "I'll listen, I promise I won't jump to conclusions. I'm sure it isn't that bad. I'll love you either way."
Harry would tell himself, and every time Draco - or one of his friends looked their way he would quickly look back at Ginny or out across the lake.
Harry managed to cancel the blizzard around him, the snowy gust whooshing upwards and dispersing in a show of falling snow, and he used his wand to encase Draco’s feet in ice.
“Deletrius!” Harry said, ending the spell and looking back up at Draco. “The evidence is now in my memory. If it comes to it, they can use a pensive, but we only get one chance to save Silas from a life in Azkaban. I want to try and convince Silas that his beliefs are wrong… I have to try!”
-On the horror roller coaster, Draco screams clinging onto Ron - who is also screaming and paralyzed by the spiders with red eyes.
“Just read it.” Harry told him, and then turned to leave once Draco finally took the letter from his hand. He was all the way down the hall when Draco called.
"Sorry, Malfoy." Harry apologised sincerely, but it came out mumbled as he continued on his way - his mind now thinking of Severus. He wondered if things would have been different if the man had survived the war twelve years ago. How much of Severus's cold demeanour and unfriendliness had been his façade as a spy?
“He flies a broom, he talks about the magical world in detail, and he knows about spells and potions. He isn’t a squib!” Draco insisted for the fourth time, and very defensively too Harry noted.
-Images of his mother and father when he was a few months old play out around the room, capture his attention.
The brown haired, sixth year Slytherin delinquent, brought with him an eerie cloud of dread that seemed to pervade the entire room. He sneered at Draco; his obvious feelings of indignation made apparent, but Draco forced himself to react professionally.
Draco didn’t finish his sentence; he was hightailing it through the Hogwarts gates and away from him. Harry knew that feeling - of not wanting anyone to see you breaking down, for being seen as weak. He knew the feeling of denying the truth because it hurt – just like Harry denied the fact he’d been abused by his Aunt and Uncle. He didn’t want to humiliate Draco, but he wanted to man to know that he wouldn’t judge him – not for this, and not for being forced to take the Dark Mark.
“To be truly cunning you need wisdom to pull it off, and there are many kinds of wisdom. It never hurts to know more than your adversaries, and it certainly helps when one wishes to be ambitious.” Draco told them. “Did you not wish to spend the night with your brother Mr Sayer?”
“Right!” Harry frowned, closing his door and following Draco to the Headmistress office in a hurry. “What’s this about – – Silas?”
It was immensely warm, so warm that he wanted to return to his slumber – – but his left hand stung painfully, especially when he tried to move it. Biting back a groan, he blinked his eyes open only to shut them again when the light nearly blinded him. He tried again, opening his lids slowly until his eyes adjusted to the bright white light –
-They walk to Gryffindor table together. Harry gives anyone that weren't happy, a look of pure warning.
Harry stood up and left the Great Hall before he died of embarrassment. Draco followed him, ignoring the dirty comments.
- 20th September 8am breakfast, Harry biting his lips, staring at Draco across the Great Hall, and Ginny's words going unheard again.
“Mr Malfoy,” Poppy started, turning to face Harry – for once, she was glad he was here, “Is refusing to eat and will, apparently, be telling his father about it.”
He watched as Draco finished the coffee, wondering where he would hide the parchment if he had one. A though then dawned on him – what if Draco wrote in his bedroom like he did?
Neville, was still shocked at the power Draco and Harry wielded, even now – the passion behind their friendly battle was surprising too, and the two of them were so into it that they’d forgotten the students. They were completely focused on each other…
“Potter!” Draco’s eyed met his own. Harry saw Draco’s throat bob as the man swallowed, and Harry noticed how uncertain he was to what he’d seen – embarrassed maybe?
“Actually, I think it was intentional to some degree. I remember wanting to get rid of her, to shut her up for once. I wanted her gone, and then suddenly the wall was no more. I also realised that I’d been using wandless magic during my entire rage. That’s when I discovered that I didn’t need a wand for basic spells, and half the slightly more difficult ones either. On top of that, Hermione pointed out the next time she came over, that I had somehow broken the curses or what not in the house, and dispelled the dark energy.”
Harry's heart wilted as he moved away from the man to continue on up the hill – he really had fallen hopeless in love with Draco Malfoy.
an illusion - to him at least, because until he met the man he couldn’t be sure if the real version was … well, real.
“Good.” Draco decided to change the subject, he would never admit that Harry’s appreciation set of fireworks and bright fires of warmth inside of him. He also wanted to puff out his chest with pride, but what a ridiculous thought! “Now, I say we catch the end of breakfast before Minerva finds us.”
Looking down at the leather lanyard with the shrunken vial attached, he tried to blink away a few stray tears… Fucking hell! Why was he getting emotional over this…?
He didn’t know what he was supposed to do now however, he’d promised Padfoot that he wouldn’t just stop corresponding with him without an explanation at least. What was he supposed to say – ‘
Harry said nothing else, he simple walked over to the small kitchenette, and with wandless magic he started boiling some water for the coffee.
Before I could see whatever expression crossed his face, I turned around and walked away. I felt a prickle of danger in my neck telling me that he was pulling out his wand but the Moody came to my rescue. I turned around to see Malfoy turn into a....ferret? He let out a squeak and I giggled because oh my merlin...he looked adorable. I just wanted to pick him up and cuddle with it. But then my eyes widened because, 'did I really just think that?' and 'he's my enemy, I can't think things like that.'
"That's...t-" she stopped as a shaky breath escaped her. "That's great, Draco. I'm happy for you." She spoke softly, a little bit of sadness in her eyes. I rose an eyebrow in suspicion.
Draco blinked. Ever since the second task, seeing Potter selflessly save two people even though he could die, made Draco think differently of the Golden Boy. Since then, Draco's spotted him in a crowd of thousands, his heart has sped up just by the mere thought of him, and he's noticed just how damn attractive the smaller boy is. Of course, Draco recognized these thoughts as very gay ones. Draco has been sure he wasn't attracted to girls ever since Pansy had a full-on make-out session with him third year and Draco wanted to puke afterwards. But he sure as hell wasn't going to admit being gay.
Draco starts to realize just how much he fancies the golden boy and is forced to write a letter about his emotions.
"I did WHAT?!" He gasped and looked around. He looked down and noticed the bulge formed in his pants. He stared at it dumbly, "How did this happen?"
"Harry Potter? At Hogwarts? Oh boy, I should've gone to Beauxbatons," she scoffed while entering our cabin. I frowned and squinted my eyes as she sat down next to me.
'I could kiss him and shock the fuck out of him and while he's not looking grab the letter', Cons? 'Do I even need to list a reason?'
"Give that back, Potter," he snarled. I tilted my head to the side in fake contemplation. Then I grinned innocently.
"Draco, are you alright?" She asked whilst popping a treacle tart into her mouth. I grew annoyed. "Pansy, I'm fine. Jeezus, bugger off," I murmured. She and Goyle looked baffled at my absurd language. I immediately felt tremendous guilt as Pansy's eyes started to glaze over and she excused herself to the bathroom. Crabbe looked judgingly at me. "I'll apologize later. Sorry guys." I frowned while turning my thoughts back to Harry.
'I have Potter...he's my friend now.' Then a faint smile, not a smirk, formed on my face and I suddenly felt a little better. I quickly used a glamour spell and hmphed in acceptance.
I felt bad when he was forced down Crabbe's pants. The fear in the ferret's eyes was a little saddening. But Professor Moody shot me a wink and I smiled.
I noticed while putting on a spray of cologne that my hands were shaking tremendously. Dark circles and puffiness formed under my dull gray eyes and I wondered if I should use a glamour to cover the bruises on my wrists.
I lowered my head to her ear and whispered, "Pansy...I don't like women." A few seconds of silence and her head popped up, shaking the table. Crabbe looked up from his textbook that he was staring dumbly at a few minutes ago and cocked his head to the side, nudging Goyle to pay attention to us.
I extended my hand, "I can help you there." I smiled, getting ready to become friends with the amazing Harry Potter. I could feel excitement bubbling up and then-
'Maybe he'll be at breakfast!' the thought just hit me as I quickly rushed out of my room and to the great hall.
“I find strange things fascinating. Your mind haze episodes are strange and fascinating. My questions simply allow me to get to know you better, but if it bothers you so much, I suggest you simply request a change of subject.”
“Draco?” Harry called to him over the bangs, laughter, and squeaks, holding out his own cracker toward him. “Will you do me the honour?”
Draco: "We barely remember what we've done for the past two months - some of which I might remind you, is totally immoral and spurious ... yet you're worried about a useless holiday that started during the inferi wars of the 18th century."
Draco waited for Harry to come back, but he slowly grew confused. Wasn’t his father in prison? Wasn’t he just a vile, corrupted Death Eater now? Tearing back the sleeve of his pyjamas, he stared at the fading dark mark there – the confirmation that he was indeed tainted. That mark represented who he really was, the darkness that flowed in his veins, the errors of his past… he didn’t want it!
His mind muttered - realising with horror, that he was arguing with himself. On top of that, he just remembered that he loved Tau’s amusing arrogance. They were both arrogant!
“With all due respect Minerva, I’d rather not talk about this here… but I’ll say is this,” Draco whispered, “Mother will be divorced before the new year.” Taking a forkful of roast potato to indicate he would say more on the subject, he thought back to his Mother’s letters.
"Does he no longer feel the Nimbus 2000 to be satisfactory?" Draco was curious about his cousin – well, first cousin once removed – and he had yet to really speak to Andromeda beyond letters.
“Now this one, then you can have your breakfast!” Madam Pomfrey instructed in her no-nonsense attitude.
“The Warmendall potion. You have the Snowflu Mr Malfoy, remember?” Madam Pomfrey informed him, impatiently shoving the vial into his hand.
-Herbology class. Harry watches Draco shove his way to the front of an outside demonstration eating an apple.
“Well, I can’t trust you not to go rummaging through my things obviously. You just admitted your desire to go through my closet – a heinous crime has thus been prevented.” Draco sniffed as if he’d been personally insulted. Harry also noticed how Draco was blocking the view to his bed.
“Where the hell is this coming from? I thought we were okay. And no, I won’t forget. I can’t forget. But I have forgiven you.”
“It’s fine.” Draco said, finishing his bowl of porridge and sucking his spoon clean. “Maybe you’ll tell me one day, maybe you won’t. Like I said I’m just – Aughhh!”
They sat near Covent Garden in a pricey coffee shop, Draco agreeing – albeit hesitantly and with a dash of criticism for good measure – that the drink was rather good. Harry could not contain his smile when Draco lowered his mug and left a mustache of milk foam behind.
Harry nodded with a smirk, “Thank you! I really do appreciate it.” His smirk morphed into a small smile.
"Let me guess. Your friends decided that you needed company in the form of a life partner. They brought you a voucher and then forced you redeem it?" Malaise said confidently, crossing her legs under the fabric of her long dress.
Harry was rather surprised at the way Draco had been received by Mrs Allaway. The greying older lady smiled at him, pottering about quickly to make sure he had everything he needed, and she even patted his shoulder before they’d left. It was nice to know that Draco had friendly acquaintances.
Draco huffed, downed the last of his liquid courage in one, and then helped himself to another – filling up his glass with rich amber whisky. “Fine! Bloody manipulative bastard. Once you have finishing explaining what you meant about his soul being in your head, I’ll tell you some of the finer details to my
They both started to open their respective gifts, slowly, sneaking glances at each other all the while. Harry was the first to reach his gift under paper, a few seconds before Draco in fact, and he frowned as he opened the lid to reveal a potion vial and what looked like a leather Lanyard.
It wasn’t long before he found himself outside Draco’s private chambers. He dug up his courage and knocked, waiting for the door to open.
Harry drunk his coffee now that it had cooled down, and waited to see if Tau would reply. He had things to do before the day ended, and he had work to mark. Once he’d tipped back the last sip of his drink, he decided to come back to the parchment later.
“Potter!” Draco spat as he lowered his mug with a thump. He leaned across the wooden table. “It is none of your business!” Draco’s whispered annoyance was weaved with embarrassment and self-contempt, but Harry knew no anger was truly aimed at him.
"Potter, listen. Have a coffee, a whiskey for Merlin's sake! And calm the fuck down! You're a Gryffindor with Slytherin traits for Salazar's sake!" Draco was practically shaking Harry by this point, perhaps annoyed that Potter was getting under his skin and into his heart, but he let go of Harry's arms before he hurt the man. "Just … just sit down and think. Check you haven't missed anyone else and … If Minerva can't let you rush out to buy what you need tomorrow, then … I'll go for you if you're amenable to that. I don't think I have any duties beyond being available for any student that need my assistance… I'm sure I can deflect them to you for a few hours."
Harry fled the hospital wing like a scolded child caught with their parent’s wand; the matron could be bloody scary sometimes.
Blond hair, grey eyes, same height, same personality, same fears, same arrogance, same dating company, both purebloods, both had a weakness for chocolate … … and he went giddy at the knees for them both.
“I expect a nice balance: details, ideas, history, uses, and how it could save your life.” Harry continued. “I want to see the pros and cons of your chosen shield, the technique, how to pronounce the spell to activate the shield, and so on so forth.
“I have an idea. I’ll think about it over the holidays and make a list. Don’t worry about it now Draco.” Harry fixed together the coffees and returned to the armchair opposite Draco.
It wasn’t just the coffee that was making him restless though, but the bomb of thoughts, feelings, and memories that had gone off inside him. The more he got to know Draco, the harder it became to deny the truth of who Tau actually was. It was so blindingly obviously, and yet, he still wasn’t ready to accept it. Soon - soon he would find out without a shadow of a doubt, but right now, Draco had just agreed to the tour.
Harry could hear the pain in Draco’s voice - the hope that Harry right but the inability to believe him. It made Harry even more determined to make Draco see what Harry now could.
He must have been there for at least three hours before he was finally handed ten different possible matches, or possible secret chérie's. Malaise left him to go through them alone and only returned once with a cup of tea for him with a few biscuits. By the time he had finished his tea, he had already decided that he wasn't interest in seven of them. One of the aforementioned seven was into strange role play animal sex games - a rather big nope from Harry after nearly chocking on his biscuit. Another had an ultimate life goal of traveling the world to find new or extinct magical creatures, but Harry felt that it clashed with his own goals of having a crazy little family and keeping his job.
"I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks." Harry looked up at me, a little bit of hate showing in his eyes. I furrowed my brow in confusion. Surely he must be joking. But the look in his eyes told me he was dead serious. I slowly lowered my hand, feeling my face and neck burning with humiliation from being rejected.
I swallowed back the lump that was forming in my throat and I looked away. Around the room, near the Ravenclaws table, the doors, anywhere that wasn't Pansy. I could sense her stare on me and I just took another bite of my apple.
I felt hysteria build up in my stomach as I pointed him out to Crabbe, Goyle, and Parkinson. I quickly put on my best cool face and smirked. "It's true then?" I said loudly and saw him turn to look at me. Along with everyone else. "What they were saying on the train? Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts." I smirked. Everyone started whispering. I saw confusion in Harry's eyes.
"The letter was asking if we could be friends. I didn't want to ask in public just in case you..." he gulped, "in case you rejected me." He shuddered, "A-again..."
Draco fake seethed, trying to cover up his fear, "You shouldn't take my things if you don't want to get burned, Potter. Maybe now you'll learn a lesson."
"Harry, are you alright?" she asked, concerned but impatient because I was taking too long to pack up.
Draco: "Potter please. Don't say anything. Not yet anyway. If it happens again, we'll go to McGonagall. I just know what people will say though.''
Harry: "I don't know what's real anymore Draco. This curse is fucking with our lives, and even you said it wasn't real ... so, what's changed?"
Being around 8pm, the stars were bright in the night sky - cloudless and endless. He leaned on the rails, searching for constellations. An owl spotted him, swooping down with a letter from the ministry. He petted the bird, watching it leave before opening his letter. He read it, smiling afterwards with relief in his face, turning back to the stars.
visited muggle towns since the war, for curiosities sake, but not enough to grow accustomed to the vehicles and unusual noises. A kid on a skateboard had nearly scared the magic out of him a while ago, speeding past within half an inch of his life, and jumping down the drop curb with a bang.
Thank you so much if you made it this far. Oh my, this has been so fun to write; a bit silly and crazy but i enjoyed doing it. Please let me know what you think In the comments.
“Need a hand?” Draco smirked down at Harry, holding out a hand for him to take when Harry showed no signs of getting up.
Yes, Draco had talked, or in this case, written his ears off last night. He’d already heard all about wizarding traditions – yuletide and winter solstice, seeing as Draco had educated him about it until the early hours of the morning. He knew exactly what that poem meant:
Harry: "I'm also struggling to recall what I've learnt Headmistresses, It's not just Malfoy. With all due respect , we came to you for advice not bias judgment. You're the headmistress, we assumed you would want to know if two of your students were being affected by a curse, and we trusted you to address this matter professionally."
Their bodies were rather close, reminding Draco of Harry’s disastrous interest in him, and in turn, reminding himself that he was falling in love with the raven-haired man. Preposterous!
Draco abandoned his book hunting, practically throwing himself down on the identical couch opposite Harry.   “You- Potter, you do realise that now my father is in prison you can preside over my own mother!”
“What of my own students? As head of Slytherin, shouldn’t I be assuring my students are ready to leave likewise?”  He knew what Minerva was going to say before she said it.
Madam Pomfrey then turned to face Draco again, observing him for changes in symptoms, health… and mentality.
He reached into the draw and pulled out the copy of Tau’s Le’Amortentia profile: Thirty years old, five-foot-nine in height, grey eyes, blond hair, pure-blood.
eyes, and I didn’t watch him kill my mother over and over again in my dreams because of them fucking Dementors! No of course not Draco, of course I have no fucking idea!”
Harry remembered how Mr Graves was particularly interested in Mr Avery. If he didn’t know any better, he would have sworn that the man was shocked at the fact that ex-death eater - Mr Avery senior, had even sired a son. They hadn’t yet spoken with Silas - as far as he was aware, but they’d promised to return once they’d reviewed everything back at the ministry. Harry didn’t know what they could do however, there was still no evidence to implicate Silas.
As soon as he left the room however, he remembered that Samuel had been waiting for him. “Erm, Dra- Mr Malfoy isn’t feeling to well. I’m going to fetch Madam Pomfrey. Come with me!”
the most tiring part of being a teacher. It was tedious, arduous, and it took ages. He also had to give it to Headmistress Minerva McGonagall in two days for approval. He’d been working at his defence against the darks arts plans for five hours straight today already, and he’d only finished about a quarter of the work.
Midnight was rapidly closing in by the time Harry had return to his room, had a shower, and climbed into bed with mug of hot chocolate. He twisted the warm mug in his hands as he thought back over the last several hours.
Harry couldn't help but glance over at his charmed parchment once more, his heart missing a beat when he saw the new words there. Grabbing it, he read what Tau had written - the essays forgotten for the time being.
He glanced up at Draco, withholding a smirk as the blond helped himself to the chocolate yule log. Harry helped himself to the sticky toffee pudding, and then froze – only for a few seconds – with the spoon of toffee dessert on its way to his mouth when he heard the quiet moan of delight escape Draco’s chocolate covered lips… he quickly continued to shove the spoon into his mouth before anyone caught him staring at the blond teacher, and he looked down at his plate to hide the blush that was mortifyingly on his face. Sounds like that should be illegal!
Harry felt sick - what the fuck was happening. He had memories of the past two weeks, but they felt dream like. Surely he didn't just spend two weeks crushing over Draco Malfoy. Someone up must fucking hate him, even his eight year at Hogwarts couldn't be normal.
Harry burst out laughing as he went to finish the last sip of firewhisky, spitting it out across the table as he guffawed and gasped for air.
"I think Bouncing Bantlings have a few quidditch themed baby toys. I remember seeing wooden blocks with moving images of snitches and brooms and the like." Harry paused to think, "I'd avoid clothes, I think Kaison has enough to last him five years. A few books wouldn't hurt, but remember, he is only thirteen-months old."
was. They weren't quite friends yet, but it wouldn't take much. A few moments like this, the right words ... and Harry could see them getting close ...
He saw Minerva help herself to another serving of honey roasted parsnips. Draco was thankful that she’d taken the hint and didn’t ask any more on the subject, he didn’t want his business aired all over the school – students had a knack for overhearing things and spreading gossip.
Blond haired thirty-year-old man with grey eyes, pure-blood, with a passion for reading and aesthetics including nature, paintings, and poetry. His life goal was for a family, a chance to be loved and to love another without expectations, and a chance to be seen for who he is now and not who he was in his past. His quote was – 'Give me the storm and tempest of thought and action, rather than the dead calm of ignorance and faith! Banish me from Eden when you will; but first let me eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge!'
Harry once again nodded. This actually didn't sound too bad, and he found himself gaining an interest as he started to relax. "How do you pick a ... chérie?"
Swotty bowed before leaving to follow her orders. A level two FGI (for general illness), was simply a small breakfast for someone that hadn’t eaten much due to being unwell, or for someone that couldn’t stomach much due to an illness. It was to be something light, small, and easy for someone recovering. If a particular diet was otherwise required, Madam Pomfrey would be more specific – the reminder that Draco was allergic to Lupine, was just a small example of this.
of January… five weeks away. He really didn’t want to wait that long; leaving Draco to believe that Padfoot was going to sweep him away in some romantic notion, while denying any feelings for him/Harry, was almost crippling him with guilt … but he felt that Silas was more important than his own personal matters right now, and there was no way this would work if Draco wasn’t on speaking terms with him. So… he checked his letter one last time before sending it off.
Harry: "I was thinking of visiting the shops. I was gonna grab some Bertie Bott's every flavored Beans."
“Your gift?” Harry had started to blush in his neck again, he could feel it, but he chose to ignore it.
He blinked - the phantom itch was back again. What was it he was thinking before he returned to the Great Hall – before everything went downhill?
“Yes well, we can only reduce the pain I’m afraid. No potion will be able to stop the cold flashes entirely.”  Madam Pomfrey explained, she knew that Draco had suddenly regressed in age, again – not something she enjoyed at all. “You will just have deal with it until it passes.”
Harry: "We could go to Diagon alley? I know you refused but, there's more to see there and I've been meaning to visit Homely Abode."
. It was immensely obvious what Draco was doing – avoiding Harry and investing all his time in Padfoot, obviously hoping to speed into ‘something’ with Padfoot, so that he may avoid feelings for him – Harry ... or have an excuse to avoid and reject him at least.
Harry went to direct Samuel towards the Great Hall – planning to lead the boy with a hand on his shoulder – thinking that Draco would be there eating dinner, but Samuel shook himself free and a loud ‘ARRK’ sound erupted from the boy’s mouth like the honk of a goose. Samuel covered his mouth with both hands and looked positively horrified.
“It’ll be fine in a second Draco, just hold on a minute yeah!” Harry said, rubbing Draco’s arms in an attempt to warm up the man, even if just a fraction.
The music had stopped, but the kissing lasted for a whole fifteen seconds longer. When Draco pulled away, it took Harry a moment to realize they were no longer under the effects of the magical radio. The look on Harry's face - questioning, hopeful maybe, imploring, and dazed with infatuation, was enough to encourage Draco to speak.
"Why not buy it for his birthday then…" Draco's voice tore Harry away from his thoughts, "wasn't he born in April?"
see him. Harry smiled, nodding. He was relieved, he didn’t even know if Draco was allowed a calming drought. “That’s it, Draco. Do you feel like you’re ready to get back into bed?”
“Potter!” Draco practically shrieked, shaking of the snow. “You can’t attack me! you’re on my team now!”
Harry thought that he could ask a similar promise, that Tau wouldn’t suddenly see only his fame and fortune. This was what the secret parchment service was for, to get to know each other as they are now - not the past, not the lies and stories the media made up, but each other’s true personality. Harry was sure there would be instances of his own past that he would feel hesitant to share, so Tau wasn’t alone in that either.
Draco: "You're delirious Potter. Tell me, did you want to share all your horrible little memories with me, or snog my brains out?"
His brain was so scattered right now! Cursing his panicked brain, he rushed to find a top first and foremost … any fucking top!
Harry: "Am I? Maybe you did curse me, maybe you're behind this damn fucking radio. Maybe its all a trap to get me back for killing your beloved Dark lord!"
“Don’t forget to grind your dried Hycanitade leaves into a fine powder, Miss Payne.” He reminded the girl. The last time she had attempted this potion, she has simply crushed the blue leave into flakes. “Can you tell me the correct colour of Murtlap essence if brewed correctly?”
His mini panic quickly abated when he imagined the reaction Draco would have had, if that had been the case. Draco would have killed him, or at very least, he would have brought him up on it with some very loud words. No, it couldn’t be that, he was sure of it now, and it wasn’t the Snowflu either… although, Draco had said some very interesting things during his illness.
“I know this isn’t about that fucking reporter.” Harry continued. “Something at the Three Broomsticks started this. Whilst I’d like to know what that is, I’d rather you snapped out of it and joined me for a whisky or something! You can tell me or not what has you in such a foul mood, but I won’t be scared off so easily.”
soul in my fucking head for nearly seventeen years. I didn’t wake up puking my guts out every time I watched
“No.” Draco frowned at Harry again and block the door. “Potter, I cannot in good conscience let you leave this room like that.”
-Harry looks up at Draco, who is still watching the moving images play out the darker parts of Harry's life.
If Draco's heart rate sped up, if his breath hitched and stomach flipped at the contact of Harry hand … he ignored it.
Harry:  *Nodded* "It reminded me why there are less student at Hogwarts this year, why the carriages were't as full ... and of all the people i'd failed.
“One of your mind haze episodes?” Draco asked with concern. Harry was grateful he never mentioned the bloody tears.
He was very tempted to tell Tau about Malfoy. He wouldn’t use names of course, and he’d avoid mentioning anything to give away his own or Malfoy’s identity, but in the end … he decided there was no point in bringing that up. He would only sound like an idiot if he did, and he and Malfoy had far too much history to explain everything in a way that Tau would understand.
As much as Draco was loath to admit it, he still wanted the boy to suffer for what he had done to Har– to Potter. He didn’t like the boy, and it was obvious the feeling was mutual.
“Alright then Harry, if you’re sure.” Draco stood up too, a small smile gracing his lips. “Let us get what we need, and then we shall enjoy the melody of nature.”
Harry wandlessly used the shield charm on instinct, and that only seemed to add to Draco’s anger. Draco pounded Harry with jinxes, hexes, or spells, and each time Harry skillfully deflected or shielded against it with his wand, all the while moving closer to Draco until he was standing in front of the broken man.
Harry sat down opposite Draco, and he started looking over the parchments. He had been corresponding back and forth with Narcissa through Draco for the past five weeks, and he’d learnt a lot about Draco and Narcissa’s life with Lucius. He felt sorry for them both, but he knew his sympathy wouldn’t be welcome so he never offered it.
His eyes roamed again, and he found himself tapping his foot as he became restless. Out of nowhere, flashes of a sexual nature invaded his mind, and a twitch bellow his waist made him shift back in the chair. Harry rubbed his eyes - chalking it up to boredom, and scratched his jaw line with the slight stubble. His attention was then stolen by the strange purple flowers near the windows - they sat in round terracotta vases, almost alluring in nature and seemed to move like a breeze on a hot day. Harry felt a little hot and had to restrain from fanning his face with the voucher. He fidgeted in his seat, aware of a growing tightness in his boxers, but he couldn't figure out why his body was acting so strangely.
“I’m not sure.” Harry admitted, gently squeezing his shoulder. “But I’m sure that Madam Pomfrey will have her fixed up in no time. I’ll take you back to Gryffindor tower in a moment, I just need to speak to Professor Flitwick quickly.”
-Wednesday the 2nd December: Draco approaches Harry, but Harry won't listen to him, or give into him agian.
“You can ask Kreacher if you like.” Harry said, wondering how this had turned onto his own eating habits.
-Harry stared at the closed door from which Draco left, perching his bottom on a rickety old desk and sighing, thinking.
Draco stood panting, wet, covering in snow, exhausted, and with thoroughly mess up hair. They were both breathless and sore, both bruised from the onslaught of snowballs, and both freezing bloody cold – although Draco might admit that Harry must be worse of on the cold front right now.
Draco looked between his two confused friends. If they really had no memory, maybe Potter didn't remember either.
“No. Its okay, really! I’m just being stupid. You just -- you have no idea what those words meant to me.” Harry sat up and smiled warmly at the man next to him, before looking out at the horizon. “I always hear such rubbish. People thinking I’m a hero that single handedly won the war, but everyone played a part – even you Draco!” He turned to face Draco once again.
“Potter?” Draco’s voice suddenly caught his attention and he froze. He hadn’t even realised that Draco had opened the door.
“You do have a tendency to cause explosive reactions Miss Payne.” Draco smirked slightly at her look of mortification. “Not to worry, I’m teasing… but I must say, that hat rather suits you.”
Draco and Harry were still in Rosa Lee teabag's - a long rectangular shaped tea shop specializing in serving tea and cakes. Very few alternatives - such as basic coffee or sandwiches, were also sold over at the counter with the cake display.
questioned his sanity many times in the past: when he was a child and strange things happened around him: when Voldemort was in his head and he thought he was going insane: when he heard voices in the walls that his friends couldn’t hear: when he raced into danger with no plans: and when his mental stability crashed after the war. He couldn’t share any of that with Tau however … not yet.
"How many Weasley's are there?" Draco asked, blinking in disbelief when Harry panicked that he'd forgotten the baby. "What baby?"
Harry smiled at the last few students now watching him and Draco with frowns. Draco caught on and did the same. Harry motioned them to hurry up before the train left without them, they were the last students left to board thankfully.
"Watch where you're going, Potter!" Malfoy drawled, his voice was still as clear, as sharp, and as snippy as Harry remembered it, but the tone was lower - deeper, and there was a smooth wrapping to it. In a way, it reminded him of Professor Severus Snape – a great man that had died in the war playing spy for the side against Voldemort, but not a very likeable potions professor.
He shoved a glass of whiskey into Draco chest – forcing the man to take it, as he passed him on the way back to the dark-blue chesterfield sofas. He all but collapsed into the one on the right, tiredly. He sighed and ran a hand down his face, replaced his glasses, and then looked up at the blond again.
Harry’s mind was screaming as the pieces of the puzzle slotted into place. The girl’s words – ‘do worse to me’, the fact she bolted from the potions room when Silas entered it… he needed Poppy to do a medical scan.
Entering his private rooms near the defence against the dark arts classroom, Harry threw his satchel down on the bed.
“Then good for her!” Minerva said, stopping him from dwelling any longer on his pathetic excuse of a father.
Harry had eventually figured that much out – Draco’s involvement with the landlady had been hashed out in much detail during Draco’s trial. In fact, Harry felt like a royal idiot for suggesting the Three Broomsticks in the first place; he wondered why Draco hadn’t rejected the offer to drink there from the get go. Right now, however, he just hoped that if he stayed quiet long enough, Draco would go on and elaborate. His patience paid off.
Tau to be Draco, but he wondered if the man would even give him a chance once he realised that his illusion of Padfoot … was just Harry.
He couldn’t think right now… his mind was a mess – Harry’s laughter, and his smiling wasn’t helping in the slightest – he needed space.
Shockingly, Draco looked like he was struggling to not burst out into painful sobs. Harry saw him wobble, frozen in place in fear of crumbling before his ex-rival, and then he muttered through clenched teeth, “I made bad choices.”
“Not now Draco.” Harry pleaded, leaving the door open as he went back inside. He picked up his half mug of black coffee. “Why are you here? Minerva?” He asked, before downing the last of his caffeinated drink.
Madam Pomfrey, on the other hand, tutted as Harry left her hospital wing, shaking her head as she turned to face her patient with a knowing smile gracing her lips.
Draco slammed the door behind him, telling himself that he did not see Potter’s perfect green eyes turn glossy!
It was obvious to Draco, just how much joy it gave Harry to buy gifts for his family and friends. At one point in Draco's life, this would have been an inconceivable concept… giving for the sake of giving and nothing more… but since the war, he had come to appreciate the gesture. It made him wonder, again, if Harry would appreciate the gift that he'd brought from him, a small gift that lay in his desk draw back at Hogwarts. He hoped that it wasn't too personal, hoped that it wouldn't give of the wrong message.
“Yeah, sorry. I shouldn’t have bothered you. I should just-” Harry stopped talking the moment a warm hand touched his shoulder.
older now and with ages came maturity … but he’d never have expected this from Malfoy of all people. Was Malfoy scheming and up to something? He had wondered why Malfoy would accept the potions professor job and move back to England, when the last Harry had heard, he owned a book store in France and was living with his mother there.
As he glanced up at Harry again, he couldn’t help but blame his father for dealing the cards that had inevitably stolen his chances today, to explore and admit the feelings he was developing for one Harry Potter. In fact, and he sneered at the thought, it was his father’s upbringing that had inevitable caused his rivalry with Potter in 1991; his beliefs, his holier-than-thou attitude, and his narcissistic nature … were all thanks to his sire’s misguided beliefs of what, and how, one should teach their only child.
Harry and Neville then went to talk to Miss Payne. Neville sat down at the end of the bed Miss Payne occupied, and Harry sat on the empty bed to the left.
If you find yourself bored, I suppose I could take the time from my very busy Christmas schedule - to meet you in Hogsmeade.
“That was AWESOME!” One of the male students shouted over the loud cheering and clapping. Neville and Filius could be heard ushering the students back towards the castle, but Harry and Draco were still a bit distracted with pulling themselves together to pay attention just yet.
Harry chuckled; he knew exactly what that translated to: Let's change the subject because this is getting awkward, but I am impressed that you can even remember all of your adoptive family members.
When Harry handed it back to him, their hands brushed and Draco felt bereft when the contact was lost. It confused him and frustrated him, his feelings, and he quite frankly didn’t wish to feel the way he did… he couldn’t afford to; the Golden boy and an Ex-Death Eater would never work out, his father’s actions had sullied the Malfoy name, and the media… people in general, it would go to madness if they found out. He would be targeted most aggressively for daring to ‘corrupt’ the boy whole lived, and Harry’s life would he a living hell – Merlin, Morgana and Salazar together wouldn’t be able to prevent the chaos and calamity that would erupt.
