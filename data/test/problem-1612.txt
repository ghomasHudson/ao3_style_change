He filled the kettle. The best thing to do when he woke with this feeling was to get on with his morning. Sometimes it meant an unexpected storm was on the way. Sometimes it meant they’d be out of eggs down in the village.
Of the last loaf of bread, four slices remained. He arranged them into the toaster and once again put water on to boil. It was morning yet. He could still get his day on track.
Malfoy speaks in a haughty tone, but his voice is little more than a murmur, and his hands cradle his cup of tea as if he can contain all the warmth there.
Inexplicably, Harry feels the backs of his eyes heat. He clears his throat and glances out the window.
Malfoy walked up to the counter on the customer’s side, wearing a button-up and jeans. No flour on him today. No evidence of last night’s revelry on his face, either. Harry suspected he kept a lot of sobering and hangover potions on hand. Luna had said he brewed.
all of them for parts, thank you very much. He wasn’t a complete savage. And in any case, if Potter ate meat of any kind—which he had while at Hogwarts, Draco remembered quite well—then he wasn’t in any place to judge Draco for what he did with the animals he bred, which lived perfectly happy lives in their spelled habitat cages, thank you very much.
He peeled the label away. “I mean, I wasn’t almost top of the class with my marks, was I? Didn’t have parents who loved me enough to— I didn’t have parents. So yeah, it was nice when someone told me I wasn’t a waste of space.”
Costs grew especially steep during experimental potions development. Draco might run dozens, even hundreds, of combinations before he discovered the right formula. The longer a brew was in development, the more costly it became.
In seconds, he’d got three more of his blue markers to disappear. The fairies thrummed around him, but because of the Shield Charm, they weren’t in his face. He pushed on.
“Oh, I’m sorry, Harry. I don’t know. Possibly nothing. Have you heard from Draco? I haven’t been able to get in contact with him all day.”
She smiles her thin smile again. “I plan on it.” The smile drops. She grips Harry’s hand on the blanket. He grips back, hard.
His pulse races. He pushes a hand through his hair. “Has there been a hearing yet? Or has he just talked to the aurors?”
Harry ripped at the corner of the beer bottle label. “Well, yeah. Nice to feel good at something for once.”
“Er—yes.” His gaze flicks to Malfoy, who is watching with bored half-interest. He doesn’t know why he feels self-conscious to do this in front of him, but he fears Hermione’s basilisk stare more than…well, whatever he fears from Malfoy. So he lifts his wand and spells a thin golden wisp of light from his temple, not unlike a memory. Except he doesn’t direct this one into a pensieve; instead, he points it into the rectangular mirror in Hermione’s hands. Golden light shivers over the surface, and when it’s cleared, words appear.
“The thing is,” Harry says, leaning forward, “Malfoy is right. I looked through the newspaper archives this morning. Poesy did move their factory early on, from a magical community to a muggle one. Because wizards don’t use—”
Harry peeled back the sandwich’s flaky bread to see what kind of frilly thing passed for breakfast here. There was the ham with some kind of white cheese on top, flecked with green specks and a drizzle of sauce. There were no pickled carrots this time. Instead, there was a hash made with some kind of purple veg and onions. He tucked in.
Harry wondered why Robards had bothered. It wasn’t like Harry would participate in the interview, and he wouldn’t have anything to do with the case for another week. Even then, he wouldn’t be allowed to interact with Malfoy—of that, he was sure. Robards must have called to update Harry for nothing but the sake of it, and maybe to flout the Unspeakables. Harry didn’t know if this made him feel better or worse.
To his surprise, Luna crouched and looked at the ground near the base of the ward. “They’re trapped inside.”
His hands were so bony, Harry thought. Knuckles and tendons and long, graceful fingers with nails carefully trimmed. Pearlescent burn scars. A thin silver band with a single rune, the only one Harry knew the name and meaning of:
“No. I just—” He stared at the sick tree. The realization hit him: “He’s around a lot.” Whereas, Harry hadn’t even known till now what Ginny and Luna got up to here in Oregon—
“I didn’t,” Harry said again, even as he placed the wrapped gift on Draco’s lap. It was rectangular, slim, and vaguely lumpy, having defied Harry’s attempts to keep it as flat as possible. Though, he supposed it added to the charm of the thing.
doing with the aurors still? Since we’re on the topic of jobs. I distinctly recall reading something about your…mysterious retreat from the DMLE. Yet here you are.”
“I don’t want to get into it right now, Hermione.” He pauses with the knife over a parsnip. Adds, “I couldn’t be a part of—that—any longer.”
“Where’s your sense of adventure gone, Potter?” Malfoy said, and reached for the handle of a door at the far side of the structure. He pushed down on it once, and then up, and then pushed it open.
Draco Malfoy. The name on the parchment raises a flurry of unwanted questions. Where has he been these last fifteen years? What has he been up to? Who is he now?
A sigh from behind him. “Fine. Touché. You’re right. Come sit down. I didn’t poison the tea. (If anything you did, with all that sugar.) I just—find it hard to process the words ‘I’m wrong, you’re right,’ coming from the mouth of Our Savior, Harry Potter. And—I admit I’m more than a little incensed to learn about those records. Those donations
.” At that, his scowl deepened. “I mean, I’m not properly living if I can’t eat or drink or fucking…
While Draco drafted up the contract, Potter explored the kitchen. Though Potter’s legs moved as though walking, this was clearly out of habit or perhaps for appearances. Like a ghost, Potter glided. This was evident in the smoothness of his movement. That was distracting enough. But the git had the habit of sticking his face close to things as if myopic as a mole.
“One of them gave me your information and suggested that you might be able to help. And I thought: I’m desperate enough.”
“Well, good for you.” He paused, felt a weight settle over him like a heavy blanket. “Maybe being an Auror is all I’ve ever wanted to do. Maybe I’m not made for anything else.”
“All right. Take your positions,” Ginny said. She, Luna, and Malfoy each took up at a corner of the field near their color.
“Well, it smells bloody divine. And it looks— Well, it looks good enough to eat.” He rubs a hand over the back of his head.
“I’m glad Ginny picked you up all right. I would have come myself, but I didn’t want to overwhelm you.”
Part of him wished he’d given Ginny and Luna a heads up about his return to Portland. It would have been nice to let Ginny drive him back to the farm. At least the Apparition was over in the next moment, and he was standing on their gravel drive.
be having him on this time. Then it swung wide, and a wave of ink and parchment smells wafted out, along with the sound of voices.
“Yes,” he says immediately, though his face heats as he realizes everything he may feel compelled to spill.
Malfoy ignored him. “The next steps are likely similar to what you learned. But I doubt you’ve ever used the charms that I do. Because I developed them. They simulate hand-mixing. Otherwise, using charms to mix would be no better than using a non-magical appliance.”
had been thrown in for good measure, his mouth opens and he says, “Haven’t met the right wizard, then?”
Just as Harry lifted his hand to knock again, the door opened. Malfoy held himself back, face neutral. He was dressed in a t-shirt and pyjama bottoms.
Meanwhile, the herd of unicorns galloped by in the window, including the little rose gold foal, which they all paused to admire. The colored light from the lamp above the table threw highlights over Malfoy’s hair that reminded Harry of the unicorns outside.
, Harry wanted to say, but Malfoy looked too sincere standing there with his hands hooked in his pockets, gazing down at the city.
The haughtiness was gone. That’s what. And he held himself confidently, but not ramrod straight nor slouching.
The afternoon was lazy and dripped with sunlight. It shone through the leaves of the plants and gleamed off the wings of the crows that flew by overhead. Smells of lavender and herbs wafted up from the garden with the heat.
The seething water and the tang of salt churned up old memories: sea cliffs and cold spray and Dumbledore. The Inferi belonged to another lifetime, but they lurked there under the black lake in Harry’s mind.
Malfoy did not look at Harry, but he didn’t have to. His amused attention on Harry was there in the way he held himself and in his smirk. “A little draining, but a Quick-Pick-Me-Up went a long way to restoring me. I’ll be back to full strength tomorrow.”
Harry wondered if he’d been making bread again, if he had made the croissant Harry had just eaten. He had a confident step, just a hint of a swagger, but that might have been put on for Harry’s benefit.
Harry had got that sense. And that should have intimidated him, probably—work that never ended—but instead it filled him with a sense of rightness.
Malfoy narrowed his eyes in thought as he chewed, fork held to his mouth. Harry watched, fascinated.
They ate the egg and bacon croissants in the kitchen’s little break area, leaning against the counter. From the corner of his eye, Harry watched the steam rise from Malfoy’s breakfast croissant as Malfoy chewed, the bob of his Adam’s apple as he swallowed. Malfoy held the croissant neatly with the tips of his fingers. His hair was slightly mussed from the morning of baking. The sweat on his skin had dried, but he had a glow about him.
As if he could hear the words, Malfoy paused in his work. He looked up. Met Harry’s gaze across the street.
She plucked the hat from his head and dropped it onto her own, turning the bill so it pointed sideways.
He asked Ron if Ron wanted to go to the pub, but Ron—who had a tiring week—is staying home to collapse on the sofa, and Harry doesn’t blame him.
Potter opened his mouth, paused, and snapped it shut again, looking even surlier. Draco shouldn’t have been amused by this. Really, he
Malfoy had grown up. Malfoy had grown up, and he owned a coffee shop, and he lived in Oregon. And apparently he knew Luna and Ginny and spent time with them, and they had told him Harry was visiting them.
“I think you’d like Curse-Breaking,” Bill said to him one morning as they worked together to unravel the magic woven into a moth-eaten tapestry.
A movement caught Draco’s eye. He glanced upwards, but immediately switched his attention back to Edward as the old man took a turn towards the greenhouse, where golden light glowed from within the glass walls, incubating the fanged geraniums. Oh, fuck no.
Time had softened Harry’s memory of the Thestrals. The reality struck him with a hard chill. The five that stepped from the deeper recesses of the forest were huge, as black as the void, and starkly bony. Their white eyes were the only bright thing about them—glowing blanks.
“Usnea” read the label in Draco’s neatest handwriting. He counted the number of bottles in the tray and checked that they were all the same type of tincture, then added a few more remedies for sore throat and cough.
The next day, Harry is rattling around Grimmauld Place, restless and at a loose end. He tries to think of what he usually does on a Saturday. Typically, he’d do dinner at Ron and Hermione’s, though Hermione begged off, and Harry can guess why. He tries not to feel a sting at that. After all, he’s the one who got her involved in Malfoy’s case. He’s
He opens his mouth, but he can’t say the words. He knows his face is turning terribly red, and even in the flickering light of the fire, it must be obvious.
His gaze fell on the far corner of the room, where a stray sunbeam slanted over a stool. The tortoiseshell button eyes of a stuffed rabbit stared back at him.
“I don’t get it. You opened a Muggle coffee shop with charmed decorations under illusion but have a completely Muggle back kitchen.”
After she’s gone, he hovers at the floo. The tension drains from him, leaving an unsettling emptiness. He glances at the clock on the mantel. Quarter past nine. He doesn’t think Malfoy would be asleep yet. But he remembers the night before and flushes. He can’t make a habit of appearing in Malfoy’s floo late at night—even if he really
Harry isn’t sure what to do with that. So he just gathers himself for the last fall from pride. “Malfoy. You’re doing incredibly important work. More—more than I’ve ever done, myself.”
The road was bordered by shrubs on both sides. It was long and straight and disappeared into the distance. An occasional break in the shrubs showed an endless, flat scrubland.
He returned to the house in time to join Ginny in picking blackberries, which was surprisingly companionable, even though Ginny laughed at the scratches on his hands and smashed berries against his neck and arms when he wasn’t looking.
“Oh, good. But, you know, I’m happy to help you stage another rescue any time.” The memory inexplicably reminded him of Malfoy, and his apprehension mounted. Harry hadn’t planned to bring this up with Luna or Ginny yet—he’d decided that he belonged here, independent of whatever Malfoy thought of him—but he had to know. “Luna… When I was talking with Ron and Hermione about my trip, they said something, and I was wondering if you knew anything about it.”
“I didn’t ‘retreat’ from the aurors,” Harry says, scowling. “You’re right. Here I am. Fully present.”
Malfoy’s touch as Malfoy moved his hands away. Even well-marinated, he knows saying that would be a bad idea.
He stomped down the steps, paused to glare at the bread on the kitchen counter where he’d left it, and went out the front door. He took a few steps down the path and stopped to stare, despairing, at the endless grey landscape. Most of the trees were still bare, and the flowers and herbs that would block the view come springtime were still seeds and roots in the earth, so the rocky, hilly countryside spread out mostly unobstructed. It was such a vast space. Theoretically, it should make looking for Potter out here easier, but it only made Draco feel how big the landscape was and just how hopeless it would be to find him.
The cottage door opens for him as easily as his own. He takes off his shoes and drops them next to Draco’s neat line of brogues. He follows the smells and sounds of cooking into the kitchen.
The mouth opens and closes again, but no sound comes out, as if Robards was hit by a silencing charm.
Teddy had drawn something vaguely crude on the bracelet, the off-beat humor of the 12-year-old son of Tonks and Remus. Harry smiled to see it, and then frowned. That hospital visit had been the only time he’d seen Teddy in the last three months.
He regarded Luna with his experienced Auror’s eye and tried to detect any hint of playfulness there, but she only smiled at him in her guileless way and said, “Would you like a turkey egg? I hardboiled several this morning, but there are some fresh eggs if you’d like an omelet.”
Harry relaxed once more. He placed one of his hands on the ground next to Malfoy’s, and was pleased when Malfoy didn’t move away.
“Oh, bloody fuck, Draco. I’m sorry. Come on, you pests! The three of you. I ought to put you in boxes and nail them shut.”
Harry shook his head. Malfoy stood nearby with his eyebrows raised in a quizzical, lightly mocking expression.
Anyway, it was fine that he hadn’t got a chance to talk to Malfoy; he wasn’t sure what he would say to him, now. He’d already thanked him for the coast trip.
Harry sighs. This is more of what he’d been expecting when he came this afternoon. “Listen, Malfoy…”
fascinated by the open kitchen and the cooks he could see inside it—flipping things on the grills, tossing food onto plates, sliding orders onto the steel counter for the waitstaff.
Harry spends time cleaning his kitchen. Pulls up weeds in his garden. But his thoughts keep straying to Malfoy. He wonders what Malfoy does on a Saturday. He probably does something worthwhile, like reading through stacks of books and government documents and serving himself shortcake and strawberries with tea while he puts it all together. Unlike Harry, who’s done nothing with his life since defeating Voldemort, and even that was kind of by accident.
“Don’t be a baby,” Malfoy said, and dumped a large dollop of sauce onto his own plate. “Here. You can have the rest.”
Harry holds his breath, lets it go. He says, “You have to know the Ministry would find a way to keep tabs on what you do.”
Harry peered around it to find another little alcove, this one smaller and brimming with felt, needles, feathers, leather cord, and tools. A desk had been crammed against the wall. A slight man with bottle-cap spectacles and no hair sat at it. He blinked at Harry with a perfect lack of recognition.
been watching the back of the shop. He hadn’t.) He carried a box in his arms, and something indecipherable crossed his face when he caught sight of Harry standing next to the pick-up counter. His gaze cut to the staff behind the counter and then back to Harry.
That was enough to settle his nerves and his stomach, and Hermione practically force-fed him soup and bread and his favorite cheese. She didn’t ask him what was wrong, only sat by until he’d finished the meal and then escorted him to bed and pressed another potion on him, a draught of dreamless sleep.
Harry clears his throat for a second time and pushes himself upright. Closes the book on his lap. Sets it aside. To his surprise, Malfoy offers him a hand. And after a moment—even more to his surprise—Harry takes it.
He gave one last deep push of his hand, then he was sliding his fingers out. Harry felt a brief sensation of
“Harry’s helped around the farm, too,” Luna put in suddenly. “And he’s helped with the Quidditch camp. He’s really good at teaching, and he’s really good at flying. Aren’t you, Harry? You’re very good at collecting eggs, too.”
“Hey,” Harry said, a little sheepishly. He stepped closer. The Thestrals turned their white eyes to him but appeared unconcerned. “They, er, seem to like you?”
, Potter. Really. We’ve said everything we need to each other through letters. Merlin’s saggy balls. Is this what your friends have had to put up with? I swear you’re a more dangerous friend than enemy.”
He stood in line again, though before he’d got to the front of it, the purple-haired barista winked at him and called him back behind the counter.
Malfoy lived in a terraced house in Chiswick. Harry wasn’t sure what to make of the scene as he walked up the brick-paved pathway past benches, a trimmed lawn, and topiary. A fountain burbled at the center of the front garden. One slender tree stood before each door. The location both surprised him and didn’t. The neatness reminded him of Malfoy Manor’s tidy grounds. It was, however, distinctly muggle.
Harry got it. They were shooting their Emitters at the same time so that the fairies didn’t dive into another mound and then each throwing one of the quick sealing charms at the closest open mound.
Harry squeezed Draco’s shoulder and huffed against his cheek. “I’ll drag myself up before sunrise and clean it all myself so you need not lay your pure gaze upon it, if it would please Your Highness.”
“Actually, next week would be great,” Draco said. A week would give him time to move things around, place the more dangerous plants out of the way, and cast a stronger disillusionment over the creature cages and the less threatening but showy magical plants.
“Not a miracle,” she warned him earlier, during her last visit in his room. “This could have ended poorly. You were lucky your friend found you quickly and that we’ve already treated you for this.”
“I have to see what your garden’s got up to,” the old man said. “Do you still have that great big blackberry bramble?”
Draco planted a hand against Harry’s chest and pushed. Off balance in every way, Harry fell back easily. He caught himself on his elbows.
Luna showed him how to harvest a little herb called scullcap and handed him a basket from the stack beneath one of the tables. Harry worked his way down one row, while Luna went down another. Her voice drifted towards him, singing softly, sweetly, and a little off-key, but in a pleasant way.
He lands with a jolt. In hindsight, apparating probably wasn’t the smart thing to do. It’s a miracle he makes it to his own front step without splinching himself. It’s a miracle he makes it home.
Ginny slapped his hand away. Luna said, “It’s not. Don’t worry. It looks very nice on you.” Her eyes laughed at him.
Frustrated, feeling uneasy and jittery from the caffeine he shouldn’t have been drinking after 10 at night, Harry headed home. Thinking: for all the conveniences of spellcasting, magical folk still haven’t devised a twenty-four-hour instant information network to mimic the Internet. Cursing the fact that the library and Ministry archives were closed for the night.
Luna slung the bag she’d brought onto a large flat rock that looked nearly like a table. Harry spotted other clues that she visited the spot often: a wilted chain of wildflowers, a metal trough of water that bubbled gently, a single wooden chair, depressions in the ground where large bodies had lain recently. From the bag, she pulled several large hunks of meat and began distributing them to the Thestrals. They waited in a loose semicircle, watching intently but motionlessly until they were thrown a portion.
“It’s good,” he said a while later, although he hadn’t seemed to enjoy it so much as eat it mechanically for Harry’s sake, which was all right by Harry, really, as long as Malfoy ate it.
At one point, Sophie wandered over to praise Harry’s charm-work. He also complimented Malfoy (who was wearing a grey newsie cap at the time), which pleased Harry but also made him bristle.
He walked up the stairs to his bedroom, stood in the doorway staring at the rumpled covers on his bed, then turned and walked down again.
“The— Oh. The fridge thing? It was. Uh. I mean. It was impressive.” He thought he’d already told them about the trip? But a moment later, Ginny cried, “He likes your larder!” to Malfoy, and Harry felt his face flame.
—made him turn his head in time to see Edward approaching the venomous tentacula. It’d been defanged, but the spiky mass of tentacles would still lash out if approached.
The front window stood empty. The bell dinged as he pushed inside to the familiar scents of coffee and baked goods. He scanned the space but didn’t see Malfoy. His heart pounded from his near-jog from the Apparition point.
“No worries,” Malfoy said, which was so strange to hear from him, Harry thought in that in-between, fuzzy way of being half-asleep.
“That’s very nice for you,” Draco said, depositing the box of herbal remedies onto an upholstered bench. He made a face at the curious portrait of the duchess. Her eyes widened, and she went still.
He steps into the room. Many books still line the shelves. Whoever cleaned the study out didn’t remove everything. That makes the entire scene more frightening.
, but not with the old man there. Until then, it would seep into the stone and into the moss between the cobbles. He’d be catching whiffs of sweet, rotting fish for months.
Ron gives him a smile. Exhausted, but genuine. “Good. Just rest a moment, then. Hermione is on her way.”
Weirdly, Malfoy didn’t seem to be enjoying this. He looked nearly as uncomfortable as Harry felt. He was as white as Harry remembered him being that night Williams and Chesterfield brought him in. The feeling of betrayal was still thick, the sick anger at Malfoy, at himself.
“I think it’s rather like a three-toed othelia den, myself. Grimmauld Place is dark, but it’s not smelly enough to be a bat cave.”
“I’ll give you the tour I give all of my new coffee shop employees,” Malfoy said, and took him around the kitchen again, except this time he showed Harry the bags of green coffee—the unroasted beans really did come green—and the roasting machines. He explained that roasting brought out the fruity, nutty flavors, but if you roasted the beans too long, they would taste burnt—“Which completely defeats the purpose of buying expensive beans.”
Harry stares. Malfoy gazes back, calmly, a reflection of Harry with his arms crossed at his own chest.
“Hmmm.” Malfoy exhaled against Harry’s neck, and Harry smelled the sweet, fruity aroma of stout. Malfoy’s cheek was close enough to Harry’s that Harry could feel the warmth off of him, but he didn’t actually touch Harry.
“You’re taking the piss,” Harry said because, if nothing else, the word “cookies” sounded bizarre coming out of Malfoy’s mouth.
They were paintings. Dozens of them. Many of the frames were empty, but that was probably because all of their occupants had gathered in the few near the front door.
Softly—until he turned like a shark, still hunting, sleek and determined. He darted forward, and then he was watching Harry meet Malfoy in Madam Malkin’s. He examined Harry’s vague contempt for 11-year-old Malfoy.
At that moment, someone else enters the room. It’s Healer Catherine, and she wants to work on untangling more of his core from his lungs. It only just occurs to Harry that maybe this time, he’s done permanent damage. Maybe this time, they won’t be able to free his lungs. He may be stuck on ventilation spells for the rest of his life.
When Harry didn’t move or comment, she cautiously continued. “When we apprehended him, he was doing the same thing. Williams thought he was fucking with us, but he looked frustrated.”
“I was under the impression that’s what we were doing. What, pray tell, were you under the impression this interaction entailed?”
Draco suppressed a little jump at the sudden proximity. He opened the back door. From her wall, the duchess gave him the same curdled look she’d given him before. Her gaze went to Potter, and her expression soured further. Draco resisted saying,
to lecture him on separation? But he couldn’t bring himself to say anything now—not after he’d seen Malfoy talking so seriously and quietly to Luna. And not while walking down the street to the library with him, Malfoy striding with his hands in his pockets, looking Muggle, himself.
Robards, leaning out of his doorway, retreats into his office, so Harry must follow. He takes the guest seat across the desk from him. They are a study in opposites: Robards sitting back with his fingers steepled, Harry sitting at the edge of his own chair with his hands on his thighs.
Malfoy settles back in his seat. “Some background may help. I’ll give this to you for free because I doubt even you can find any nefarious intentions in my recent employment history. As you surmised, I was faculty at Gnosis University. Research faculty. I was working on a proposal to study the differences in brewing practices between traditional single-cauldron brews and potions made in tanks. Considering Poesy is the first mass manufacturer of potions, I was up to my ears in their manufacturing processes. I became especially interested in how they disposed of their waste materials and byproducts.”
Harry hissed and stopped holding himself up with his elbows, let himself lie flat on the ground. Draco unzipped Harry’s jeans, and— He slid his hands over Harry’s hips to the floor. And smirked.
A whiff of carrion alerted Harry before he stepped into the little clearing where the Thestrals stood. Malfoy was there, facing them. Harry held his breath, not wanting to disturb the scene. The largest Thestrals’s ears twitched back. It blew air from its nostrils.
For a moment, Harry couldn’t speak. He looked up at the fluttering leaves of the tree until the tightness in his throat had passed. He swallowed. “Thanks.”
After briefly losing himself on the wrong level of the airport, he emerged onto the pavement outside, where the rumble of automobiles reverberated.
Harry gives him a grin. His heart races recklessly. He holds out a hand. Malfoy glances at it like he’s never seen one before. Harry squeezes and releases his empty fist, beckoning, challenging.
The letter is addressed to Malfoy care of Gnosis University’s Alchemy Department. So, Malfoy works for the university. That catches Harry by surprise, but he sets that information aside for later and skims the contents.
, read the name on the front. On the other side, embossed above the precise V of the envelope’s flap, was,
Eventually, Hills places the manuscript down. He stomps around the floor for a few more minutes—checking the bathroom and the linen closet—then returns downstairs with a mutinous Bate in tow.
Half-stunned where he lay on the cobbles, he watched as a small, white form whirled gracefully overhead like a miniature helicopter. Beady black eyes stared down at him. Draco was sure the tiny mouth smiled.
This time, Harry took the liberty of activating the popup by sliding his finger over the bottom of the page. The cutouts sprang to life, and the scene of them baking Christmas treats played itself out.
He hopped off the broom. It’d been a long time since he’d flown that fast; he was half breathless. “What’s going on?”
Sometime after sunrise, he must have fallen asleep on the sofa in the drawing room because the next thing he knows, he is waking to noise and green light, and he surges to his feet, looking for the emergency.
It’s evening by now. Harry called her late in the morning, soon after returning from the Ministry with his box of things and the case file which Harry couldn’t look at without Hermione’s little mirror.
It takes Harry a moment to understand that Robards wants him to go through all of the surveillance information.
“Sometimes we have non-magical guests,” Luna said, as they passed doorways. “Though usually they’re magical. Like you. There’s quite a lot of rooms for the conferences we hold. I’ll give you a tour soon, but I thought for now you’d just like to settle in.”
as often as needed to soothe the throat. Same with this, for cough. Add as much honey as you’d like; it’ll help.”
While Sophie was in the back of the shop taking a phone call, a customer in “a rather big hurry” approached Harry with a bowler hat that needed to be refitted. “Er,” Harry said, before attempting to recreate the Fitting Charm. He miscast it—making the hat too large—but got it right on the second try, just in time for Sophie to arrive from the back of the shop and ring the smiling customer up.
A flash of green flames. Hand still on his cheek, he looks at Malfoy. “I’m not backing out of this.”
They liked the gibberish potion. That was a good one. They added the ingredient that would make it permanent. Nice, that he couldn’t talk back. Couldn’t cast spells, wandless and wordless.
“Quite impressive, really. ‘The Chosen One Quits Aurors to Blow Whistles’ clearly takes precedence over ‘Potion Corporation Makes Muggleborns into Squibs.’”
Malfoy rolled his eyes. Heather clapped, and the customer on the other side of the till said, “Congrats!”
Harry had no response to that—at least none that was polite—so he didn’t say anything else till they got to the house, and Luna showed him how to hang the herbs to dry.
Harry had forgotten how much he enjoyed Quidditch practice. He hadn’t known what he would think about the quiet of the farm being disturbed, but he found that he liked the shout of voices, the creak of wood and leather, the dart of movement.
“Shit,” Harry hissed as Robards’ patronus, having finished its message, dissipated in a burst. He’d missed most of what it’d said. Leveling a glare at Williams, he said, “Pick him up and don’t drop him again. No matter how tempting it is.” To Chesterfield: “Did you hear all of Robards’ message?”
They said goodbye to each other in the entrance garden next to a gnarled pear tree. Parkinson had decided to stay with Malfoy for a few days, to Harry’s relief and dismay. That killed any idea of visiting Malfoy again before he left for England, but at least his peace with Luna and Ginny wouldn’t be disturbed.
Bill told him that he did a lot of his work alone in his office—old family heirlooms sent to him to un-curse—drinking copious amounts of tea to stay alert.
“I think you’d love it,” Malfoy said, edging closer. “Because you love people kissing your ass, don’t you? The Saviour.”
He stared at the list. The handwriting was his own, but it looked foreign. He shook his head, took a bite of slightly-stale pastry and began to make notes next to the items.
Harry pulled his hand away (he could still feel Malfoy’s warmth against his fingers) and scowled. “Yeah, I fly. It’s not the same as this.”
questioning if I’m compelled to be examined. Do you stop to ponder the absurdity of the laws you enforce? Or are you just the dumb muscle they send when they need someone hexed without asking why?”
It occurs to him towards the end of the second day that he has no idea what he’s actually looking for, no idea what kinds of riots Malfoy is supposedly conspiring to incite. When the thought does come to him, he straightens up from the descrying bowl to search the scatter of papers on his desk for the case notes.
“So,” Harry said as they climbed the hill towards the house. “Malfoy sells coffee. He bakes bread. And he brews potions.”
During one lull between customers, Sophie said, “Impressive. Your taste is terrible, but you have a real talent for charming people.”
It opens to admit him, which is a relief. He didn’t realize how apprehensive he was that Robards had already removed his clearance until the knob turned in his grip. He closes the door behind him. Locks it, not that it will matter much. He won’t need it for long.
The currents of Malfoy’s thoughts, mocking but also…affectionate?…drew Harry farther in. This time, the way to the occlumency wall was clear, no storm of thoughts obscuring it. Harry hesitated, but the mocking thought came again:
There aren’t many people in the office when he arrives—many of them will be out in the field at this time—but he feels the weight of several gazes on him. He ignores them as he strides towards the head auror office.
With alarm, Harry recognizes the roughness of tears in her voice. It hits him how much this might be affecting her. Not only because Malfoy has become her…ally, but because the situation brings back memories of her parents and all the buried emotions with them. He grasps her hand awkwardly.
In the silence that follows, the knife clicks loudly against the cutting board, and Hermione winces.
, but faced with the adult Malfoy, Harry can see he’s lost the smoothness of youth, and he feels an odd pang for the scowling, sneering, pale-faced boy. He’d been so
they were Muggle.) For that matter, did Malfoy live in a magical district? Or did he live in a Muggle home?
Then his window was sliding down, hot wind roaring in. The air in the car pulsed in his ears. Startled, he laughed. “What the hell, Gin?”
to me. Please.” She places a hand on his blanket-covered knee. “The aurors arrested him the morning after your visit to his house. When they questioned him, he admitted to developing the potion himself and releasing it into the water supply, as well as attempting to connect it with Poesy Potions.”
“What? Didn’t she tell you? She brings us our dill pickles and some other things. Eggs. Goat cheese.”
“It’s nice, isn’t it? We were so excited when it opened a few years ago. They have outside seating on the other side with a small rose test garden. Did you get to see it?”
Malfoy is sitting so far on the edge of his desk chair that he’s in danger of toppling out. He leans forward with a feverish gleam in his eyes.
A moment later, when Ginny yelled, “Blast!” Malfoy pressed the trigger twice before laying down the sealing spell.
She allows a small smile. A loud sound suspiciously like a crash comes from somewhere in the background. She tosses a look in the direction of it. “ROSE,” she bellows. To Harry: “I have to go. You’re fine. I’m fine. We’re fine. If you’re going to apologize to anyone, apologize to Draco Malfoy. You said some not very nice things to him, as well, you know.”
“Sure thing,” said the woman with the purple-streaked hair. She slammed the change drawer into the till, ripped the receipt from it, and handed it to the customer in front of Harry, then slid around Malfoy to disappear into the back of the shop.
In that moment, he honestly didn’t care. Screw the other offenders. But he needed a moment to think, needed an excuse to break away from the angry eyes.
Harry frowned and pushed his free hand into his pocket. “So why baking? Some deep-seated need to take your frustrations out on something that won’t hit back?”
“So, I take it we’re not working with a time limit. You aren’t…” Draco fluttered his hand. “…fading more, are you?”
Harry needed an alibi, which was the only reason he found himself pushing open the door to Malfoy’s shop the next morning.
Again, that piercing look from Robards, and Harry warms under his collar. Robards pushes a file towards Harry. “Your report. On my desk. By the end of the day.”
So as Draco followed Edward from the room, he was thinking about which kind of jam he’d treat himself to. Of the tea, there was no question. Earl Grey was the only clear choice.
Ginny did indeed have a broom he could borrow, and he spent the rest of the afternoon flying over the farm and over the same forest he’d walked through, and beyond, to a river that ran shimmering and cool. The air and the terrain still felt different from England’s, but in a pleasant and fresh way. He felt like a different person outside the dark walls of Grimmauld, with the bright open sky around him. With his feet dipped into the river, feeling the current of the water, he had to admit that Ron had been right: a break from the house was what he had needed.
This one was narrower and cleaner than the other. When they emerged onto the pavement outside, Harry saw they were in a part of the city with sleek office buildings and hotels.
The upstairs hallway was just as nice as the front and ground floor of the house (but it was different from the “nice” of Malfoy’s arse; that was a whole other category). There were some little paintings and photographs and nature-type things and Muggle—non-magical—things on the walls, but Malfoy didn’t point out any of the rooms or things up here. He took Harry straight past a bathroom (this must have been the “upstairs bathroom”) to a door at the end of the hall.
Harry shuddered, remembering the stench of burnt coffee and the din of mouthy hats. “No, thank you.”
The only question remained: stop by the fish and chip shop on the way home—he was tiring of it, but it was open late—or stop by Ron and Hermione’s with a hangdog expression? Conveniently for him, they nearly always kept leftovers, a fact which Harry tried not to look at too closely. Ron insisted Harry was always welcome over, but Harry had caught them on their way to bed more than once, and not always to
He goes into the kitchen. Malfoy trails in a few minutes later, hands in his pockets. He leans a casual hip against the counter and takes in the kitchen. Harry is conscious of the sheets and sheets of tiny quiches along the countertop. The kitchen still smells of pastry and ham and butter.
“Malfoy,” Harry says in a warning tone that has an edge of a plea in it. He closes his eyes for a moment, and when he opens them again, Malfoy is watching him. Well, in for a knut. He takes a deep breath. “I was wrong. You were right. The Ministry— What it’s doing is wrong. I talked with Hermione—”
The corners of Malfoy’s lips turned up. “Well. I was thinking of starting by sucking you off. As long as you’re not opposed?”
It was. The walls and honey-colored wood floors were very clean and modern-looking. A bit like the coffeehouse—except it felt like Malfoy’s home and not like the coffeehouse, so the resemblance sort of ended there. Maybe because of the smell—or the lack of it. Harry had come to associate the aroma of coffee with Malfoy, but the house did not smell like coffee.
“Would you like to stay for a beer?” he asked Malfoy, the first thing that came to mind. Then, belatedly, he remembered that Malfoy had to wake for work early in the morning. Back at the house, Malfoy had said he’d been getting ready for bed, hadn’t he? At the time, Harry thought Malfoy was using an excuse to avoid him. Now, Harry remembered how exhausted Malfoy had looked yesterday. Shit. He opened his mouth to say never mind.
“Yeah, he did.” Harry cheerfully speared some Brussels sprouts and chewed them, meeting Ginny’s disbelieving look with his smile.
“No rush. I’ve got nearly two weeks,” Harry said. “I’m just as happy to hang around the farm. What are you going to use these for, anyway?” He held up a bronze feather the length of his arm.
The sound of the surf rolled in and out, slowly. They walked and walked, and the immense silhouette of Haystack Rock never seemed to get closer—until they were standing in its lee.
Malfoy set his nails into Harry’s shoulders, and the pleasure-pain of it trembled through him. Harry’s hips snapped forward, hard, and the bed creaked, the headboard rattled. A smile cracked Malfoy’s face—bright and unguarded. Harry panted a laugh and fumbled for his wand to cast a Silencing Charm, but Malfoy gripped his wrist. Eyes gleaming, he growled, “Let them hear us. I want them to hear what you’re doing to me.”
He realized there’d been a long beat of silence, and everyone was looking at him. “I’ll return on Saturday. Yeah.”
Harry smiled and took the broom from him. He accepted back the Snitch, too. It was cold from its flight but warm in the places Malfoy had held it.
Still confused about the trip—it had gone so well but ended so strangely and abruptly—he didn’t know how to say no to Luna, especially when she had that beaming expression on her face and had clearly stayed up just to tell him. So, he had thanked her. And now he was following Charlotte—“Call me Charlie”—around the brew space as she told him how they made their beer.
The haughty chin lifts. Shadows shift over his face. Grey eyes darken with cool contempt. “Of course she did. Well, no apology necessary, I assure you, Potter. If that’s all, then.” He stands in a slow, graceful sweep, and Harry stares up at him even more helplessly than before.
, for now. I’ve already spoken to Luna, and she can get this into tomorrow’s paper. She’s set up for an interview with Draco after that. I’ve contacted the
Harry’s eyes flitted to Malfoy’s left arm. Malfoy noticed and tugged at his cuff. Harry’s gaze flicked back to Malfoy’s. “I reckon not.”
Hills turns steady eyes onto Bate. “Would seem so. Potter.” He gives Harry a slow nod. Harry can’t be sure, but he reads a somber respect in the gaze, and maybe something else. An acknowledgment, an unspoken “be careful.”
“What do you mean, the charities?” Malfoy asks sharply. The challenging edge is gone, replaced by true anger.
rather look like a muggle rowan tree, especially at the end of winter without its distinctive—and obviously not muggle—silvery leaves.
Making the book, however, had been Harry’s suggestion. He remembered the popup books that Dudley had got when they were kids. Of course, the books had never lasted for more than a day or two under Dudley’s care, after which he cast them aside. This meant Harry had never been able to play with one that wasn’t torn, but he’d been enchanted by them, all the same.
This time, when they rattled to the end of the road, they really had reached the end. Malfoy parked and led Harry down a sandy path to a beach tucked out of sight by steep dunes.
From there, the conversation turned to Luna’s experiments with pickled herbs and garlic scapes and other things Harry had never heard of before. Malfoy glanced at Harry more as the evening progressed, but never when Harry was looking at him.
“I thought I’d leave something for you,” Malfoy said archly, but his smile flickered again—just enough that Harry noticed.
That did Harry in. The pressure that had been building in him surged and then released in a rush—cock untouched.
But Draco didn’t disengage. He stretched his length along Harry’s and buried his nose against Harry’s temple, and Harry felt the gentle lapping of Draco’s thoughts against his. Relief, smugness, echoes of fear and pain. Wonder. And some great, trembling emotion that Harry wouldn’t put a name to yet.
The third, he stays up till dawn creating tiny quiches—first mixing the dough by hand, then pressing it into tiny crusts, then filling them with savory custards.
“We’re not going to kill them,” Ginny said, “but we are going to make things extremely uncomfortable for them.”
Potter looked at him and his eyes grew comically round. That snapped Draco out of his moment of alarm, and he dropped his armload of books on the table with a satisfying bang.
Hermione sinks into the chair at the bedside. Her face looks drawn and worried. “Harry. I need you to promise me— No, hear me out. I need your word that you will stay in hospital until your healer releases you. There’s nothing to be done right now. Do you understand me?”
Malfoy scowls when Harry stares at a particular photograph for several minutes, and he hastily turns the page.
Hermione gave him a narrow-eyed look, then turned back to Harry. “It’s not about making money. I didn’t mean that you have to
Only two days have passed since Hermione took him to St. Mungo’s—nothing at all like the two and a half weeks of his original treatment on ventilation spells, and so, so much better than the eternity he thought he’d spend on them this time. Once he’s out of here, he needs to send his healer a gift. Something ridiculous and over the top. She’s performed a miracle.
Potter’s arms were crossed at his chest. “What did you want, Malfoy? I told you even the potions masters at St Mungo’s had no idea what dropped on me.”
“What, without telling you? Never,” he said, and ignored Ginny’s snort. He looked around the patio. The sun shone through the leaves of the vines spilling around them, and a butterfly fluttered past. “Beautiful afternoon. What’s for dinner? Should I get anything from the garden?”
part of the house primed for surprise muggle visits, and with the arrival of spring, he’d been spending every nonrainy moment outdoors—and even some of the rainy ones, as well, with an umbrella charm—and thus the cottage was unusually cluttered.
“Ginny and Luna and Pansy took me to the coast shortly after I arrived. I wanted to be able to return on my own,” Malfoy added almost too casually.
The piles of books around Luna grew and then shrank. Luna was much more casual, with none of the frenetic energy that overcame Hermione, and Harry liked when she shared information with him as she read and made notes. Maybe it was because he hadn’t grown up listening to her wax pedantically and so hadn’t fixed himself to automatically tune her out as he did with Hermione.
Behind Harry, the door slams itself shut. Malfoy crosses his arms, and Harry realizes the interview’s to be here in the entryway.
He took a narrow path around the side of the house and down a series of paved steps. Looking out over the rolling field, he wondered if he should send a Patronus, though he was exhausted from the trip and the heat of the sun through the car windows. Then he caught a glimpse of movement and saw that it was Luna.
They’re standing close now. Malfoy does not step back. Harry slips his thumb to Malfoy’s pulse point. It flutters beneath his touch.
Harry Potter stood on his doorstep. Broader in the shoulder than Draco remembered, with scruff roughening his cheeks and chin, hair just as wild as ever, dressed in maroon auror robes.
“Your magic, Potter. What’s become of it? If you’re not dead, you must have some measure of control over it still, even if you can’t wield a wand?”
Just—it made him uncomfortable, anyway. Inexplicably. He desperately wanted to go through the rest of those letters. But he was also afraid of what he’d find.
good that he quit the aurors. True, he shouldn’t have left quite in that fashion, but he’s too tangled with Malfoy now to stay involved with his case; and really, no matter how he left, whether it was with a
Harry smoothed it down—in vain, of course. “Leave my hair out of it, thanks. At least I don’t wear it slicked like an eleven-year-old git.”
Harry returns to the bottom floor of the cottage. For some reason he can’t explain, he walks past the kitchen down a short hall Harry hasn’t explored before. Malfoy led Hills and Bate here when they visited and he took them to the pantry.
Not all of the eggs had hatched yet. Of those that had, some of the hatchlings had already started to wander in the wrong direction. Luna had tried her best to keep them in the same general area, but she didn’t speak Parseltongue, and she couldn’t direct any spells in between the wards.
She sits and scrolls through the pages. He goes back to his chopping, more relaxed now that Hermione is absorbed in scanning the case file.
The table and chairs were empty. The place looked just as Draco had left it, the plates and cups where he’d placed them, his chair pulled away from the table at an angle.
“Glamours leave a trace, and polyjuice—you know. They’d have known immediately. Anyway, there’s no better camouflage than my own tarnished reputation.”
A blink. “No.” Malfoy began to close the door, but Harry took Ginny’s advice and jammed his foot in the way.
He let the quiet and stillness of the room settle around him. Someone—he guessed Luna—had decorated the room with a string of colorful ribbons hung across the far corner of the room, fresh flowers and paper birds in a vase, and a painting of vines that curled around the far window. The quilt on the bed was made of old Quidditch uniforms and patches of denim and of floral printed fabric, and it looked like the sort of thing Molly would make.
“Oh, they’re quite normal on farms with turkeys on them. They taste a bit like turkey, the same way duck eggs taste a bit like duck and chicken eggs taste a bit like chicken. Did you ever notice that?”
“Let me guess,” Malfoy said. “Luna put you up to this. Or have you taken up the hobby of following me again?”
So, he made the walk to Knead. He would tell Malfoy about his plan in case his supposed “day at the shop” came up in conversation. Also, he would grab a coffee.
“Lay off. I’m not worried, anyway. I’m— Worried. Yeah.” He pushes a hand through his hair. “What those bastards did to him. What they almost did to me.”
By mid morning, it’s been more than twenty-four hours since he’s seen or heard from Malfoy. He continues to push aside the dull worry in his gut. The hearing has passed for now. The aurors have nothing on Malfoy. There’s no reason for Harry to reach out, and anyway, it won’t be long before Hermione calls a war council or Malfoy bursts through the floo, brandishing the morning paper and demanding answers in his sharp, posh way.
He waves his wand around the office. Items fly off of the shelves, out of drawers—not so many of them, considering the number of years he’s been here. Shrunk down, they all fit into a box. A crumpled, worn-out cardboard box.
His frustration built until something in him snapped—and suddenly he was on the Quidditch field with Malfoy again. This was a challenge, and Harry wasn’t going to lose—not to Malfoy.
Malfoy tilted his head in the equivalent of a shrug. He was looking at Harry in an odd way that made Harry squirmy. He set down the magazine. “I was thinking. Since you’ll be returning to England soon, you might want to try a few more things before heading back? What happens in the States stays in the States.”
He has the overwhelming impulse to bridge the gap between them and…Merlin. Kiss Malfoy? Touch his face? Push him backward onto the rug? And he’s terrified again.
and he can’t spend another minute in the cramped DMLE suite—and politely requests the files he needs.
— Don’t touch those,” Draco snapped, and then quieted his voice. “They’re poisonous. Terrible rash.”
“It is! He’ll be over after work, which is perfect, really, because there’s a song we need to sing first, and herbs we need to burn. It won’t do to relocate it without blessing the new land. Would you like to see the location? I’ll make us breakfast first. I never did eat. I had a dream about this chapter and came down. I suppose the sun will have risen by now.”
Malfoy spoke as he walked around to the side of the table with the tubs of dry ingredients lined up, leaving the trays of dough. It took a moment for Harry to understand.
The next morning, Harry woke, put on an old t-shirt and tracksuit bottoms, and stood in the sitting room. He regarded the peeling wallpaper, soot-darkened walls, and rainy oil landscapes and did not feel inspired to action. He needed to start
sure what had happened, but it had been good. Very, very good. Possibly one of the best things ever to have happened to him. And it had been with Malfoy.
In the end, Luna left a haphazard stack of books next to her seat in the sitting area and concluded that they were missing some information.
Potter glared and opened his mouth, but before he could deliver a heated rebuttal, Draco said, “Stay here till I return. And
Harry stares at the file for several minutes before opening it, feeling like he is accessing something he shouldn’t, like he is in the Restricted Section again. He’s restrained himself from accessing the file several times over the years. Every time he itched to see what Malfoy was up to, he heard Hermione’s voice in his mind, chastising him for stalking Malfoy.
At last, the old man and the box of remedies were tucked into their respective seats, belted and secure, and the page of directions was folded neatly beneath the bottles. Draco took a deep breath of relief, and then Edward was rolling down the window to thank him again.
And that’s when it sank in: this was Ginny and Luna’s home. And the strangeness of being far from home dissipated because their presence was here. Harry’s home had always been where his friends were.
A pause, as if she weren’t certain whether to say what she had to say in front of Malfoy. Harry, however, wasn’t going to let him out of his sight. The supercilious shit was up to something.
Malfoy shuddered, spine curling, hand stripping over his cock in long pulls as he added to the slippery mess already covering Harry’s belly and chest.
Around them, full dark had almost completely fallen. The garden was a dark, tangled shadow. Beyond it, the lights of the house were visible through the silhouette of branches and leaves. Smaller pinpricks of light glinted among them. It was hard to tell which were stars and which were fairies until they happened to take flight.
Robards continues: “Possible counts of conspiracy to incite riots. The trace on his home has given us letters to friends, calls to family, and garden catalogue purchases.”
At Harry’s sharp look, Malfoy lifts his chin. Recalling that he is not here officially, Harry decides not to pursue that line of questioning. Instead, he looks at the document in his hands. “What is it you want me to look at?” Then, when Malfoy grimaces, he says, “
Harry huffed a laugh and relaxed his head back against the pillow, surrounded by Malfoy’s scent and warmth. “They creep me out. But yeah. I liked them," he said. "I liked them very much.”
The initial madness settled down, however—and so did they. In a few months, they fell into a comfortable working partnership again, this time without Robards’ shadow hanging over them. They were able to choose their own cases, focus on the aspects of the job that they preferred, streamline paperwork and finish it at their own leisure, and—perhaps best of all—stay out of the path of stray curses and hexes.
As Draco set the box down in the truck, Edward said, “The directions?”—which they’d left in the house—and Draco spent another minute assuring Edward he’d grab the paper himself,
That brought a pleased little smile to Malfoy’s mouth. He glanced at the gulls as the victor took off, two more in pursuit. “Still not a good idea.”
“Yeah, I quit,” he says, steeling himself. “I can’t work for a corrupt Ministry. I’d rather put my attention toward doing something to help. I thought—” He thought Malfoy would be pleased, or at least neutral.
For lunch, he chose a place that served curry, hoping he would at least be familiar with the food here, but found that even this menu was foreign to him, so he’d ordered the special and was subjected to more smiles and odd looks from the staff. Feeling self-conscious, he ate his food at one of the little tables. He glanced in the wall-length mirror, wondering if he had something on his face, but he looked like he usually did, and he’d put his shirt on the right way around.
Harry is alarmed by the force of her bitterness. Then he understands. She’s angry at herself, or at least angry that she cannot step forward as a witness with her own memories. Harry doesn’t ask why. In the past, Hermione would have stepped forward without a thought. In the past, before Rose. Before Hermione had someone else to live for.
The water lapped gently at the shore. They were along an inlet, not the ocean side, looking across the water at buildings on the near-distant shore. Gulls perched on the wooden pilings out on the water. The air had a sharp tang.
Harry thought of the letters; he hadn’t been able to stop thinking about them. He shrugged. “Got through some stuff in the attic. Lot of old cursed junk up there. I need to talk to Bill.”
“Most normal people sleep, Malfoy. I am not going to stare at a ceiling eight hours out of every day.”
Dazed, Harry blinked up at Malfoy, who had done this last time, too. He expected long fingers to dip down and tease him, tracing circles over his sensitive skin, and his body tensed with anticipation. But Malfoy stretched across Harry and brushed his mouth over Harry’s neck and jaw and said, voice low, “Fuck me.”
The interest isn’t quite genuine; it’s polite, a little remote. Alex has got something else on his mind, but he’s trying. Harry shrugs again. “Looks like Malfoy’s only crime is forgetting to cite his sources.” At Alex’s puzzled look, he adds, “He’s been doing research—” Something makes Harry censor himself. He ends with, “Hard to get him just on research.”
Next to Harry, Draco lifted his own wand and cast a charm on the colored paper scattered over the table. Finally, here near the end of December, they had this part down: the dance of paper and ribbons and magic as they translated the projected memory into a physical representation. Excess paper curled away from the sheets floating and spinning above the table. The little figures took form: the tiny Teddy, the Harry and Draco. The kitchen, too: cabinets and sink and table, the rows of ingredients and baking implements. The figures arranged themselves in the paper kitchen, and they were making biscuits. Soon, the neat rows of ingredients and tools became a jumble. Splotches of colored frosting flecked the counter and cabinets. Teddy stole spoonfuls of dough when Draco was turned away. (“No
While they were still stopped, Malfoy glanced at him. “Seatbelt? Good. You did pack more than one pair of underwear, correct?”
And anyway. It just surprised Harry. It wasn’t like he was crying into his coffee over thoughts of poor forgotten Malfoy.
They returned to the broom shed in silence, and Harry put the equipment away. Though the night was still young, one flight seemed like enough—but Harry wasn’t ready to say goodbye.
The look on the duchess’s face should have warned him. But Draco was used to her strange moods and indecipherable expressions, so he only returned the look she gave him before opening the back door and casting a strong umbrella charm to float over him, and didn’t think anymore about it.
Hermione looks in danger of biting through her lip. He knows she’s probably having the same flashback he is to their later years in Hogwarts—the lies, the propaganda, the eagerness to throw Harry under the Knight Bus. No, this situation wouldn’t be a precedent. But it
Malfoy follows him up the stairs and hangs back as Harry pulls the pensieve out of its cabinet. The liquid is pearly with a memory, and he stares at it until he remembers the memory of the letters the Ministry sent Malfoy. Instead of removing it, he decides to leave it in. He adds the rest of his memories in with it: from first arriving on Malfoy’s doorstep till the end of the court hearing. Maybe he should leave that particular memory out, but he thinks Malfoy ought to know what he was made to believe and say.
As Malfoy worked the till and the coffee machines, the hand of the wizarding clock behind the counter inched itself into the green “late-morning lull” segment. The queue emptied. Malfoy rifled through the racks of bread, taking stock; several trays had already been emptied. He rearranged these, placed several new pastries in the glass case, and glanced up at the clock. He leaned towards the purple-streaked server. She laughed.
“That would be— Nice, actually. But. You seem unsurprised to see me.” The weird feeling like no time had passed tickled over his scalp.
He lowered his numb legs and dropped the report into a drawer. He’d have to tackle that in the morning. Right now, his vision was too blurred to make anything of the words.
Robards stands behind his desk, both hands planted on its surface, looming like a bear. “What do you think you’re doing? You can’t get out of explaining why you were at Draco Malfoy’s residence this morning.”
They set off down the street, not holding hands, but close enough that their knuckles brushed, and Harry sensed the phantom of a smile at the edge of Draco’s mouth.
Harry Potter sitting—hovering—at his dining table. Harry Potter cursed, and a ghost, and needing his help, and not having anywhere to stay. He’d said he couldn’t sleep. But what did he plan to do for days, weeks, possibly months while Draco worked on the potion? Haunt the moors?
All of Potter’s symptoms related to the fact that he was, for all intents and purposes, and despite all of his protests, a ghost. He couldn’t feel or touch, which he illustrated—to Draco’s horror—by waving his hand through the corner of the table. He glanced at Draco. “Malfoy, are you all right?”
A thrill went through Harry, and he had to pause a moment as he tried to keep himself together. Another man’s cock.
All of Harry’s fantasies. Dozens of them—hundreds—a shivering heat haze under Harry’s most profound occlumency walls.
She rolled her eyes in a very Hermione expression that had not changed in twenty years. “Because. For one thing, you’d go mad. You’re a very active person.”
The green seal on the largest letter made his heart clench. All thoughts of breakfast fled. He sank to one of the kitchen table chairs, staring at the envelope.
Still chewing, Malfoy flashes him two fingers, but his cheeks redden. The rest of the quiches on his plate go the way of the first.
“I didn’t mean to be on the front page. I just—wanted to add to what you were trying to tell the public. It’s not my fault this was blown out of context.”
And he enjoyed working with Ginny. After an hour or two of instruction, he fell into easy sync with her. It struck him that they were more relaxed than they’d ever been when they were dating. He liked it. He’d
Harry looked around the attic. It hadn’t fundamentally changed. Most of the old junk was there, only rearranged. They hadn’t actually needed to Vanish much of it. What was left was inert, benign, dusty, ancient. Useless to Harry. Would Andromeda want any of it?
She stood near a tree with curling blackened leaves, dressed in jeans and a t-shirt, her hair pulled up in a plait. There was a smear of dirt over her neck.  She smiled beatifically at him.
apparent weakness he’s focused on. Maybe it wasn’t as obvious as he thought. Maybe Harry only noticed because he knows what to watch for.
Harry lay on the sofa in the drawing room, in his robes but with the buttons undone, hand around his erection. His leg was rucked up, his other hand reaching to slip fingers into his arse, and he was thinking— Malfoy’s mouth around his cock, his slender, clever digits pushing into Harry, the most intimate part of him. Taking him apart, breaking him into elemental pieces, as he did in all of Harry’s fantasies.
Then Harry took the Floo back to the farm, where Luna was still awake. She asked how the trip had gone, and told Harry that she had arranged for him to shadow one more job the next day. Since his trip was coming to a close, she wanted to make it a special one. And, well, he’d shown interest in learning about beer, so she had asked Charlotte of Sassy Spider Magical Brewery if Harry could learn about their process.
“Oh, Harry,” she says, leaning over the kitchen table to look down at it. She flashes him a smirk. “No one can accuse you of having bad timing.”
“I—yeah. Okay.” He took the window seat, and Malfoy sat next to him in a wash of coffee and bread and citrus scents.
Draco barely stopped himself from pressing a hand to his thundering heart. “What? Did you think I’d never get my hands dirty?”
In the end, the decision is easy to make. Because it isn’t a decision at all. There’s only one course of action, and Harry faces it the only way he ever faces these things: full-on, without looking back.
Maybe it was nothing. His imagination. Probably, he was so used to being recognized everywhere he went that his mind picked up cues that weren’t there.
He could have been eating roast beef at the Granger-Weasley’s instead of the sandwich he’d bought for lunch but hadn’t touched. When Harry had turned down their invitation yesterday, Hermione had looked more troubled than disappointed. “I’m just worried for you, Harry. Are you sure everything is all right? It feels like you’re closing off.”
Swirling his spoon through his chowder, Malfoy said, “I supposed it never occurred to you to do anything else?”
“Go. Take care of Rose. Tell Ron I said hi when he gets home. I’ll give you a call as soon as I’ve checked on Malfoy. I’m sure he’s fine.”
Hermione flicks a finger over the surface as if she is flipping pages of a real book. Words scroll by. At length, Hermione nods. “Good. This is what we needed. Thanks, Harry.”
. He watches them, spoon in one hand and sandwich in the other, as they rise and head up the stairs with hardly a backward glance.
Harry refrained from asking, and only nodded along as Malfoy talked about finding the right flavor balance and roasting the coffee evenly (because something about
The truth is, he’s ashamed of his anger and what he said to Hermione. That was a rotten thing to bring up, even upset. Something he’d have expected from himself at age 14, not 32. Underneath it is a seething feeling he recognizes as jealousy, and he’s ashamed of that, too. He doesn’t even know why he feels that way, only that he’s felt more than a bit left out since Malfoy and Hermione hit it off last week. Which doesn’t even make sense; them getting along should be a good thing.
At that moment, a fleet shape dived down. Wings flapped in his face. A sharp bill nipped his fingers. Then the seagull was flying away, and Harry’s bread was gone.
He gnawed on his pen for a few more minutes, trying to ignore them, then sighed, placed the coffee and pastry half-finished into the bin, and left the coffee shop.
This clue that his family has been to see him relaxes something behind his heart, and he closes his eyes once more.
“Lay off, Malfoy. They don’t have your chicken. You can either wait here till next week or pick something else.”
Harry watched from the top corner of his vision. He opened the next book in the pile Malfoy had pushed toward him. He’d already forgotten the terms Malfoy had asked him to search for. He glanced at the page with its dimpled text. ‘Sickle Leaf.’ Right.
. It’s a farce. Hermione continues to shoot him needle-like looks, and Harry ignores her, and Malfoy ignores him.
He walked into a solid wall of coffee and bacon aroma. The breakfast crowd hadn’t cleared yet. Malfoy was working behind the till again, easily identified by his hair. His eyes widened and then narrowed when Harry reached the front of the queue.
Malfoy smiles a crooked smile, and sitting here on the man’s study room floor with an upside-down book and sleep-fuzzed brain, Harry feels his stomach flip over. The sensation catches him by surprise, and it unseats the dull disappointment of Hermione forgetting him. For a moment, he can’t breathe.
Harry spent another day on the farm with Luna. He met the white bison, managed to anger the Erumpent (though Luna calmed it with a song), and collected fallen Thunderbird feathers from the forest’s edge.
Harry checked the time. Two o’clock. That gave him a jolt, although of course Portland was eight hours behind London time. Ginny had told him not to bother sending a message unless he’d be delayed, so he hitched his bag onto his shoulder and followed the flow of people towards the exit and into the Portland airport.
Harry felt strange, felt especially aware of his body. It was probably the alcohol. Mostly the alcohol. Maybe?
The expression that crossed Malfoy’s face was complicated. Then he sniffed. “For about five seconds. But of course you’d notice.”
She doesn’t ask where he went or why. It’s not like his involvement in Draco Malfoy’s case isn’t plastered all over the papers now. He appreciates that about her: her quiet discretion, her focus on the task of healing. But he still knows, somehow, that she is recalling their conversation from his last office visit. The awareness of it sits between them.
He kissed away the worst of Harry’s pain and fear. Each kiss a benediction on the frustrated attempts with Ginny. The loneliness. His guilt and regret after
The memory of Malfoy’s voice comes with a memory of his expression: the mulish set of his jaw, the clench of his fingers over his crossed arms. The obstinate glint in his eyes gives Harry a flash of half-forgotten memory: being fifteen, fists clenched, glaring defiantly at Umbridge while being told he was a liar.
“I wouldn’t have worried,” Harry insisted, although that wasn’t true. “And I did make a social visit. A number of them, in fact. We got on pretty well.”
Draco led him upstairs and spread an arm. “Here you are. The guest room. Because you are, much to my bemusement and dismay, a guest in my humble cottage until I get you sorted.”
He heats water in the kettle and puts on a pot of chamomile tea. Sits with it in his pyjama bottoms. He stares at the mirror on the table, the scatter of notes left by Hermione, the Ministry letter at its corner. He doesn’t go through any of it. Just stares.
But Harry manages to check himself before responding. Right. Professional. He takes a steadying breath. “Conspiracy. Sedition.”
“Liked that, did you? I thought you would, friend to gingers that you are; I took my inspiration from the best. Yes. Harassment. You want to know about the wards on my door? It certainly is a relevant question, considering I only placed them once your Ministry started sending me its little love notes.”
Harry blinked up at Malfoy, who looked completely debauched. He stretched over Harry and propped himself up with one elbow. He used his other hand to undo his trouser button and pump his cock over Harry.
“Welcome to our kitchen,” Malfoy said. “This here is a roaster. We roast all of our own coffee. All of the chocolate we use, as well. That happens over there.” In a dry voice, he added, “Just about the only thing we don’t do is mill our own flour,” and Harry couldn’t tell if he was being serious or taking the piss. He didn’t have a chance to ask because Malfoy was already several feet away, pointing out the ovens, the cooling racks, some other machines.
Harry thoughtfully scratched through the rest of his sweet and sour chicken, and mopped up the remaining sauce with a soggy chip. “What do you reckon the Chinese food is like there?”
“I took what we had to the market yesterday,” Luna explained, as she brushed wood shavings and a stray feather from two of the eggs in her hand.
Harry loved the honey lemon ice cream, and he loved the marionberry pie flavor, too, though when Malfoy asked what he thought of them, Harry only shrugged and said, “They’re all right. How’s yours?”
“Do I call them all Harry?” He licked a stripe along Harry’s clavicle, even as his nimble hands went to the button of Harry’s jeans.
Malfoy sniffed and made a show of looking over each shelf while Harry stood aside, watching him hum and cluck and stroke his chin. Harry wanted to stuff one of the hats over his face.
Draco refilled the kettle at the tap deliberately by hand. After the first unexpected visit from Edward and his granddaughter Kara three years ago, Draco had removed anything overtly magical from the kitchen and sitting room, so the biggest risk of breaking the Statute remained forgetting himself and casting a bit of casual magic out of habit.
Fuck, Harry was not going to hold on much longer. He bit his own lip, clutched hard at the base of his cock. Only the tip was pressed against Malfoy’s hole. He rubbed the head against slick skin, then pushed back in, slowly and exquisitely. Malfoy made a little high noise in the back of his throat as he slid all the way in.
Sophie was kind but clearly just waking up. He yawned hugely between sentences and took deep pulls from his mug. The strong, burnt smell of the coffee filled the cramped space, and Harry tried not to wrinkle his nose. Maybe it was that he’d spent so much time in Malfoy’s shop over the last few days. He was sure that, a week ago, the smell wouldn’t have bothered him. It would have just been coffee to him, like all the rest.
He hitched up on an elbow and studied Harry with an intense expression. It was different to the hunger from before. Harry’s breath caught. He couldn’t read Malfoy’s expression, had no idea what to expect from him. Even when Malfoy leaned down, Harry didn’t know whether he’d…headbutt Harry or…
“Why should I know what I’m going to do next?” he asked Hermione and Ron when he saw them the next day. “It’s not—” He lowered his voice and glanced at Ron apologetically. “It’s not like I’ve had to touch any of my parents’ savings. I don’t exactly need to work.”
The communication spell takes some effort on his part, especially when he’s drugged. But maybe they decreased the dose of the potion because his thoughts are clearer now, and the concern and anxiety are closer to the surface.
“There’s nothing wrong with them,” Harry said, his own tone a bit defensive. He scrunched his face up. “I just…don’t want to.”
“Drink this,” she said, indicating a blue glass vial. The label indicated it was a calming draught, but even so, his heart raced. Hermione glared. He had no reason and no strength to protest. He took it.
Harry regarded the mound of whipped cream. He didn’t know what Malfoy was up to, but he was about to find out. He set the shortbread biscuit aside. He lifted the mug and took a sniff: sweet cream and lemon. He tasted the whipped cream; it was thick—nearly as thick as icing—and sweet, with the tang of candied lemon zest. Tilting the mug a bit more, he got a taste of the coffee underneath: sweet, smooth, caramel-flavored. He frowned because it reminded him of something, but he couldn’t quite place his finger on it.
Harry expect from Malfoy’s tastes? Not a coffee shop in Oregon, that was for sure. Harry only had his memories of the Manor and the Slytherin common room. More than ten years had passed since school, and this Malfoy was clearly a different persona. So, who knew? Maybe Malfoy liked, um—Harry glanced at the art on the walls—coffee beans and flowers, farm equipment and…some kind of sea rock rising from the sandy surf; some kind of rocky well surging with water.
And he couldn’t help it; his gaze skated over Edward’s shoulder to the empty path behind the man, to the empty cab of the truck. His shoulders dropped. “Come in, then. Coffee?”
“Thank you, love,” Luna said, leaning to peck Ginny on the cheek. Ginny returned the kiss. She dug several bright red tomatoes (and a purple one) from the bottom of the basket, along with a couple of vegetables Harry didn’t recognize, and set them into the bowl next to Harry to be cut. Then she took a yellow flower from atop the greens and tucked it into Luna’s hair. Luna reached up to touch it lightly with her fingers, met Ginny’s gaze, and traded a fond smile with her.
Draco, at a loss, stepped aside and said, “Come in.” He felt oddly light, as if he were in a dream. His skin buzzed. “I’ll make you tea.”
Malfoy pointed his wand toward the ovens along the wall, and their doors opened. With a pop, flames sprang up inside of them.
But as he reaches for the floo powder in the drawing room, he pauses, looking down, gaze unfocused. He looks at Harry, and Harry can’t read his expression.
There was a beat of silence, into which the people in the painting by the door burst into a loud round of laughter.
He responded to Harry’s reactions—changing pace and rhythm and depth at Harry’s every noise and movement. Harry wanted to grab his cock, but also, he didn’t. When Malfoy’s hot hand squeezed him, he nearly shouted. Saw stars. Tried not to come.
“Don’t look so surprised,” Malfoy murmured. “You’ve had Bertie Botts. Meet the non-magical equivalent—as ice cream.”
Hermione hasn’t said the words out loud, but Harry knows she thinks he should find a different career, that staying with the aurors is not practical, is in fact probably making him miserable. They are on their second bottle of wine tonight, and Harry still hasn’t told them about the field assignment he was placed on, nor that his subject is Draco Malfoy.
As if hearing his thoughts, Malfoy whispered an incantation, and a ball of gentle rose gold light floated from his wand like a bubble. It briefly illuminated his face, then drifted lazily into the air. He turned to find Harry watching him, and his face creased. “What? We aren’t going to fly in the dark.”
From deeper inside the shop, a muffled voice said, “Hello?” Harry hoped it was human, and he squeezed through the shop towards it.
The house was the same as before. Nothing had changed. But something about it made him pause before going up the steps, something that felt a little uninviting, a little disapproving. But it was nothing, of course. The house was just a house.
He tried to catch sight of Malfoy at his station by the window, but he couldn’t see around the tall case of baked goods in the way, so he took his usual seat in the corner. From there, he could see Malfoy’s back. It was hard to tell from the distance, but it seemed like Malfoy was moving more slowly than usual, without the same finesse.
Harry grinned. “Hold on.” He popped into the shed to grab a practice Snitch. When he returned outside, Malfoy had cast his own
In the sitting room, Teddy was still passed out on the sofa as Harry had left him. He had green and blue smudges of icing on his cheeks, and his hair had turned matching streaks of color.
“Mind if we make some tea, love?” Ginny asked, and pressed a kiss to the side of Luna’s head as she reached for the kettle.
“With pleasure,” Malfoy said, very close now, pushing into his personal space, close enough to hear him breathe.
Neither he nor Malfoy said anything. Harry couldn’t shake the feeling that Malfoy was staring at him, but he knew Malfoy was only looking past him through the window.
Actually, Sirius would have cheerfully told Harry to burn the place instead. Had he had a single happy memory there? Maybe Lupin’s letters. But beyond that? The place had held nothing but misery for him. Put like that, Harry’s commitment to clearing it out and fixing it up did sound senseless—for someone like Malfoy, anyway. Malfoy had a family and an ancestral home; he’d grown up with parents and things that belonged to him. Harry had the invisibility cloak, a few photographs of his parents, and a cursed house.
The file stretches back to Malfoy’s school days and includes his alleged and confirmed activities related to Voldemort. Harry skims the list with a morbid fascination, his skin tightening.
and flooed to the Ministry directly from the hospital. Now this. Malfoy, punching the breath from him.
“But you can’t stick me in here like a boggart in a chest. Anyway, there’s nothing to do in here. What do you expect me to do, stare at the wall?”
newspaper.” The paper flies from Malfoy’s hand to his own. He scans the article. He feels a little ill. “Malfoy, this isn’t—”
“Well, Monsieur Rabbit. How would you fancy a new home? No?” He sighed and set it on the boxes he planned to deliver later that week. He’d return the wayward toy then. “Yet again bested by a child.”
Malfoy’s breath hitched. Harry entered him slowly. Malfoy tensed, and he paused until he felt Malfoy slowly relax around him, waited for his whispered, “Go on,” and pushed in more, inch by inch, until he was fully seated. They both groaned, Harry panting at how warm and tight Malfoy felt around him. “Fuck.” It took all of his control to pause there and not rut senselessly into him.
With a last muttered expletive at his desk, Robards scoops up the newspaper and waves Harry out of his office with it.
was the visitor here, not Parkinson. Though she’d been traveling, she was a part of this family that Ginny and Luna and Malfoy had made in America, just the way Harry had his own life back in England: Hermione and Ron and Teddy and Andromeda. And Grimmauld Place, which needed him to fix it up.
“Yeah, thanks.” Harry accepted it from her and took a sip of the reddish liquid. “Bubbly and sweet. I like it. Is there any alcohol in this?”
, reads the name on the article, next to Hermione’s, and the sight of it on the page warms his heart.
Harry covered his face with his hand. He didn’t care that this exchange was being recorded by charms.
“You’re right! They’re just her color, aren’t they? In fact, why don’t I send you home with a pot of these. I divided the bulbs and have more than I need.”
He finds them near the bottom of the pile, overlooked because most of the text on the page has been blanked out. When Harry touches his wand to the paper, the silvery word
They cleared up the mess from dinner and then Ron ducked back through the Floo with leftovers for Hermione, leaving Harry in the silence once again.
There was a smattering of news about Perfect Products, mostly positive or at least neutral. Company profiles, press releases, reviews of the products. There was a news piece about the company’s charity in the community. The Perfect Products website itself was sparse but sparkled with photographs of smiling people and declarations of the company’s commitment to bettering the lives of its customers.
She smiles at him, a little sadly and a little bracingly, and squeezes his forearm. “It’ll be fine. Truly.”
“No, Potter. I’ll be by myself. My mother is on the continent. But no one needs to know that.” There is an outright speculative look on Malfoy’s face now. And all right. That’s enough.
“Sure,” Harry says, tired beyond belief and filled with a deep, slow anger, like a dragon rising slowly beneath the cold surface of a lake. “No one wants to hear their ministry is involved in a plot to prevent muggleborns and throw innocent researchers into Azkaban for trying to tell people about it.”
Harry, however, held on tight; he had lots of practice. He pressed his face to the side of Draco’s neck and smiled. “Sex under the invisibility cloak. In the park.” He could feel Draco’s skin heating and Draco’s muscles tensing as if he were preparing to push harder. Harry sniffed. “Careful, now. We’re in your lab. And I’ll remind you that was
Light flooded down into the courtyard beyond and gleamed off the leaves of trees and potted flowers and bushes and vines that climbed up the walls of the building toward the sun above. A fountain tinkled merrily in the center of the courtyard, though it was hardly audible under the din of voices, laughter, and music. Harry recognized strains of “You Should See Me in My Robes” by Billie Wixish.
Harry felt a creeping nervousness as they turned down a two-lane road flanked by thick forest, though he didn’t know what he had to be nervous about.
Malfoy looked up from the little circles of biscuit—cookie—dough. “Excuse me? I need the powdered sugar.”
Pots were stacked near the work table. Next to them stood a wheelbarrow filled with potting soil. The air above the wheelbarrow shimmered lightly, and Draco belatedly remembered the shield charm he’d placed over it so the soil wouldn’t get soaked by the rain. Wincing, he covertly cast a
Something isn’t right. The sense of it settles around him with the cool, sweet scent of Malfoy’s house, and he understands Hermione’s worry.
The Mark was a non-magical tattoo. Harry could make out the faded pink scar of the original Mark beneath the tattoo, which was made up of dozens and dozens of words in a fine black script. Names.
“Right. Well. Not everyone has a personal solicitor. The point is, you should be given time to seek appropriate representation.”
“And an IPA,” Harry remembered to put in at the last moment. When the waiter had turned away, he said, “Shut up,” before anyone could tease him for being predictable.
He didn’t understand the change in tone. Decided to change tacks. “And Luna seems to be doing a lot of things. Taking care of creatures. Gardening. Making pickles for Malfoy’s coffee shop. She mentions him a lot, Malfoy. It sounds like he helps out a lot.”
He stared at himself in the downstairs bathroom mirror and considered changing his clothes. Then he realized he was worrying about his appearance and rolled his eyes at himself.
Hermione-in-his-head was right, of course: it would just take more time to get comfortable with the changes.
Malfoy folds his hands on his lap and raises one supercilious eyebrow. “I think you overestimate your importance, Potter.”
Though, to Harry’s chagrin, he stares at the page for far longer than he should need; it takes him three tries to actually focus on what the words say.
Harry looked around the dim sitting room. He’d stoked the fire in the hearth, but its light was swallowed by the ever-present shadows. “I guess. Yeah.”
Luna came in with a basket of apples on her hip. “We’ll do our best,” she assured him. “But there are a few with similar menus we could probably skip.”
Malfoy’s gaze drops to his plate. He picks up a piece of shortcake. “I liked seeing you knocked down a peg for once.” The grey eyes flick back to him, and he mutters, “Not so much anymore.”
Still, he stood on the balcony and listened to the chorus for as long as it went on, the hairs on his neck standing up. At last, it quieted, and he took another dose of Sleeping Draught and slept until six. He woke to the sound of a rooster crowing and wandered downstairs feeling puffy-eyed and over-rested. Neither Ginny nor Luna were around, so he rustled around till he found some butter to go with the bread on the counter, made a cup of tea, and went outside to watch the world wake up.
She is putting things away. In the act of dropping something into a drawer and closing it, she glances at him questioningly.
That night, well after Ron had left, Harry lay staring up at the ceiling. He could hear a rhythmic knocking noise coming from the floor below, where the agitated books had never calmed down.
Malfoy was propped up in his bed, reading a magazine. He’d removed his shoes and socks, but those were the only things. Something about seeing his pale, knobby feet while the rest of him was clothed made Harry’s mouth go dry.
Ron said, “You don’t mean those fancy coffee drinks, do you? But that’s brilliant. That means coffee for us.”
In the last year, she’d changed, too. Where Ron had softened around the edges, she’d sharpened. Being mother to a toddler, and dealing with a belligerent and convalescent Harry Potter, had only brought out her ruthlessness. He knows she is well capable of carrying through on her threats to immobilize him.
The kitchen is just as empty and untouched. The entrance hall is dark, the front door closed. He’s standing at the base of the stairs, regarding it, when he recognizes the sensation that has his every nerve on edge, the source of the “off” feeling. The wards have been broken. The air of the cottage sits around him, bare, unshielded.
Malfoy runs a hand over the nape of his neck. “I have absolutely no idea.” Before Harry can speak, he continues: “They restored my memories. Most of them. Granger saw to that, apparently. I have no idea— No idea why she’d do that. That’s just the thing. I can’t remember much of the last three weeks. You, arriving on my doorstep. It’s mostly a blank after that.”
He dresses in khaki trousers and a burgundy jumper. Then, after a moment’s hesitation, he pulls on his auror robes.
“Yes, in fact,” Malfoy says, taking in the way Harry notices the setup. “I was just sitting down for breakfast.” And then, with another long-suffering sigh, adds, “Would you care to join me?”
He reached a hand to steer Edward away, but the old man stepped forward along the path. Draco’s hand closed on air.
Harry’s mouth dropped open to respond with—what, he didn’t know. But at that moment, Luna appeared from over the rise.
Malfoy tossed it into the air a couple of times and then threw it back to Harry. His eyes tracked the movement as Harry caught it. “And neither have you.”
at Oliver’s arse. It’d been kind of hard not to, considering they’d been on the same Quidditch team. He’d seen Ron’s arse a fair number of times, too. Though, given the context of the current conversation, he wasn’t going to say
“I don’t have to be a Quidditch star to go flying. I fly for fun all the time. You forget I have Ginny for a friend.”
at the puddle of fish emulsion. Indeed, much of it had seeped into the pathway. Draco mourned. Finally, wrist stiff, he discovered another trail of pots and containers the featherfee had upturned. The little beast had been after something. Draco had no idea what, and this bothered him. Was there an insect nest he wasn’t aware of? A bee swarm? But a quick search and a few hastily cast charms revealed nothing.
Parkinson’s eyes went round, and then she laughed again. “You cheated! You’re drinking that Brewmaster’s.”
“Malfoy invited me back to shadow in the coffee shop,” Harry told Luna casually over breakfast. It was a lie, of course—but, for a cover story, he thought it wasn’t too bad. “I like working with people. I thought I’d give working behind the counter a try.”
“Yes, you seemed to like this. I remember the noises you made. I was so tempted, you know. You are so tempting.”
Harry only caught a quick glance of the article, but from what he saw, it looks like at least one of the letters the Ministry sent Malfoy was published alongside the article. On his lunch break, he’ll have to surreptitiously pick a copy up from the newsstand outside the Ministry canteen.
Harry—realizing he was staring at Malfoy in disbelief—tore his gaze away. The Unicorn Room was done in rich, red-hued wood and embroidered upholstery. There was a tapestry on the far wall, next to a door that must have been for staff. Silver strands glinted in it, as if it’d been woven with unicorn hair. In a pastoral painting above, a unicorn drank at the water’s edge. In another, a unicorn and a lion lay together. The lion licked the unicorn’s face slowly, calmly. Harry wondered how old these things were and how the restaurant had come across them.
Harry grinned at that. “Hey. Would you, um.” He scratched the back of his head. He was smiling hugely, and he had no idea why or how to stop. “Would you like to get together tomorrow? I’ll meet you after work.”
To Harry’s fascination, Hermione ducks her head and blushes. She swipes a lock of hair behind her ear and clears her throat. “I was just thinking, this is the sort of issue that’s hurt by publicity. We need this to be as visible as possible, while the Ministry needs this to stay as hidden as possible. That’s the reason they pushed the hearing so soon. Because the longer they take, the more time Draco has to gather his resources.”
The fourth time Harry pulled all the way out again to rest the head of his cock against Draco’s entrance, Draco growled his protest. So Harry pushed in—fast.
A man who looked like he could have been a uni student leaned over the counter to ask a question of one of the goblins. The goblin glanced at the piece of paper the man slid toward him, nodded, and spun in his swivel chair to pull a leather tome from a shelf behind him.
Malfoy was staring. Harry couldn’t quite make out his expression in the darkness, but his voice sounded surprised. “You love attention.”
Then Malfoy pulled away, one hand pinning Harry’s shoulder to the bed. He chuckled as Harry strained to follow. Pressed a kiss to Harry’s chin, his neck, his collarbone.
Harry didn’t have time to feel surprise before Malfoy was rifling through Harry’s other memories of him. And this shouldn’t have surprised Harry; Malfoy had always been self-absorbed.
He set the rest of the garden to rights. He calmed the venomous tentacula with a thick application of fresh compost, which he applied from a distance, well away from the flailing arms. Then he cast
The sight of Potter’s expression of enjoyment made Draco scowl harder. “I told you not to go around inspecting my house.”
They crested a low, craggy rise, and the fenceline came into view. There, small but steadily growing as she jogged towards them, came Heather.
The cottage sitting room is dark and empty, just as Hermione said. But it was the same way when Harry came over earlier.
One chest was locked with a newer ward, and the magical signature felt familiar. Intrigued, and despite his lingering giddiness from the cursed dolls, he spent some time undoing it. It was a tricky little spell, but somehow, he felt like he knew how to pull it apart. At the last moment, he erected a hasty Shield Charm, but the ward gave way with no more than a gentle pop of air, and the lid of the chest creaked open.
“It was nice of Luna to connect you with job shadowing opportunities,” Hermione said with a little smirk. “Did you enjoy any of them?”
“Actually—yeah.” After the dirty chai experience, Harry was all for sticking with something he knew. He handed over his card. “Where’s Malfoy?”
He scratches another request and drops it into his inbox, and a few minutes later, several old editions of the
Shadows moved across the ceiling. The fire popped. Gold accents on the chest gleamed. He stared at the box for a long time. From elsewhere in the house, a book banged against a wall.
. Harry was not surprised to learn that Malfoy flew for pleasure. The sky here was so big and inviting. Harry had the urge to Apparate back to the farm for his borrowed broom.
To Harry’s surprise, the hall leads not only to the pantry door but also past it to a back door which opens into a garden.
Harry kicked off after him. He took one glance around for the Snitch and then abandoned the search to climb, drawn toward the sky. The wind roared in his ears. The lights bobbed out of his way.
Malfoy’s gaze flicks to the head auror. His lip curls. “I hardly think even Harry Potter would be capable of that.”
“Fine,” he says, turning blindly to the kitchen door, hoping he doesn’t sound as breathless as he feels. “I suppose you both have it handled, then.”
Pats of butter. Rolling pins. Measuring charms. Malfoy directing him exactly how to fold the dough before rolling it again, and stopping him every time he rolled in the wrong direction, or unevenly, or too few times—until Harry wondered why he hadn’t wanted Luna to choose a job shadowing opportunity for him. Surely anything was better than Malfoy ordering him to cut blocks of butter
“No, that’s all right,” Malfoy said. “It’s right here.” He picked up a relatively shapeless round black hat. “Classic beret.” He placed it on his head and adjusted it in one of the little mirrors on the shelf. He turned to look at Harry, and Harry’s heart skipped a beat.
He finished his own broom, and with one more he had finished the row. He looked back at all of the brooms, which gave off a faint aura of fresh magic, and was surprised at how fast he’d gone through them.
“What?” Harry places the glasses back on his face to find that Malfoy’s expression is serious—or at least, the challenging gleam in his eye is.
“To cleaning up the polluted Ministry!” Harry and Malfoy cry in response, clinking their glasses, and they laugh. Harry’s heart squeezes at the gleam in Malfoy’s eye and also with the little band of guilt and worry still bound around his chest.
“Er, thanks,” Harry says as he takes the proffered plate. There is not enough room for it on the table with the platter of food and Malfoy’s own plate, so he has to place down the tea in order to balance it on his knees. The strawberries shine ruby red and smell of sugar and sunshine. The shortcake is crumbly, and its scent rounds off the fragrance of the ripe berries with a sweet nuttiness. The fresh cream gleams white in its saucer. Harry doesn’t know how to tell Malfoy that he can’t eat. His stomach is twisted into a knot.
Harry nodded along, though it all washed right over him in a stream of American-and-posh. He was used to Molly Weasley’s kitchen with all of its washing and cooking charms, and he was used to Weasley Wizard Wheezes and its backroom filled with bubbling cauldrons and contained explosions. This was so
Wary, cautious, Harry settles cross-legged on the rug. The fire is warm against Harry’s side, the air near the hearth tangy with smoke. Malfoy calls a deck to his hand. To Harry’s slight surprise, the cards are bent, well-worn, and a bit singed.
read and he does know what research is, thank you very much. Of course, he only knows what an abstract is thanks to Hermione. He doesn’t mention any of this to Malfoy.
Draco couldn’t read the expression on Potter’s face at that, and it shouldn’t have mattered to him, in any case. Potter gazed off toward the cages, and he gave another of those shrugs. Devil-may-care. It made Draco want to hit him.
“What can I get you?” the cashier said when he reached the front. It took a moment for the words to register in his caffeine-starved brain because of their unfamiliar cadence.
The kettle was just beginning to chuckle as the water heated when Draco heard the rattle of a familiar engine coming up the drive. Sighing, he dumped the loose leaf back into its jar and took the canister of coffee out of a high cabinet. Draco did not like coffee. But some of his customers did, this one in particular. He poured the grounds into the cafetière, poured the water over them, and set it aside to steep. He added a generous helping of sugar and milk into his biggest mug and went to get the door, wondering if this was why the house had woken him early, if this was the reason for the feeling of
The sick, cold feeling returned to his stomach. He didn’t need to open the letter to know what was inside. News of his father’s ailing health, carefully coded in euphemisms. Inquiries into his progress with his potions mastery. And best of all: the questions. When would he return
Out of habit, Harry Apparated to the alley near Malfoy’s coffee shop. He realized it when he stepped onto the pavement and looked down the street to see the familiar big windows. He paused, then turned and walked in the other direction.
Harry spent most of the next week with Bill, staying out of Molly’s way. He loved her; he also knew better than to stand accidentally between her and stained upholstery. It was no real ordeal. Bill was laid back—even when dismantling a generations-old Thief’s Curse—and he gave Harry a running narration of what he was doing, which evolved into casual teaching.
He scratched the back of his head. “Well, I guess I’ll use the bathroom, unless you need to use it first?”
“No shadowing today?” he asked as he set both the mug and the plate down in front of Harry. “Given it up? Or are you already finished for the day?”
“Did you really?” She peered out the window. The herd of unicorns had moved across the meadow to a bright patch of wildflowers. At the edge of the group, two of them leaped into a chase in dream-like slow motion.
A swift movement caught Harry’s eye. The silver form of Luna’s Patronus streaked toward him. It bounded across the ground like a real hare and then took a giant leap into the air, galloping as it climbed toward him.
The best part of the hubbub is that it keeps Robards distracted for the rest of the day, so Harry escapes the office without being pulled aside.
She gives his hand a squeeze. “Well, you flooed to Draco’s. Then you called me. Do you remember that much?”
Malfoy is a completely different person; completely the same person. He’s a puzzle Harry can’t stop worrying at, the way Harry used to worry at his cases—turning them over and over in his mind, working through the details, except there’s no solution to this one. There’s no solution to this problem, because there is no problem. There’s only Malfoy, and there’s no reason he should confuse Harry so completely.
Hermione thanks him again, the edges of her eyes pinched, bottom lip pulled up into her teeth. Harry sits for another few minutes after she’s gone. The fire’s returned to its normal orange. The cup of peppermint tea lies cold on the side table. He takes it to the kitchen to dump it, then lingers to make himself a sandwich. He slept more than six hours in the drawing room after returning from Malfoy’s earlier. Merlin. He washes the sandwich down with a glass of pumpkin juice. He still feels a little off. Probably sleeping through half the day in a chair had something to do with that.
He looks at the bowl on his lap, at the remaining soup. Then he shrugs and scrapes it up with his sandwich since no one is here to take him to task. He pours another cup of tea with extra sugar and drinks it with his elbows propped on his knees, bemusedly listening to the creaking floor and muffled voices above and wondering how he’d come to be at this place in his life.
Malfoy smiled faintly. He flipped a few more pages, made a note. “What, is the Saviour not good enough for a common job? Must it all be heroism or bust?”
“We need everything we can for our legal team to look through. Or shall I have them look at your pensieve memories?”
“Oh, good,” she said, looking over the field. “You thought to mark them this time. It did get rather confusing last time when they swarmed and we lost track of the mounds.”
Harry collected the glass and the bottle and walked as calmly as he could to his room. A warm floaty feeling worked its way through him, and he didn’t know if it was the alcohol or the “special effect.” He set the bottle and glass down on the bedside table, stuffed a couple of pillows against the headboard, and sat back in bed. He’d left the curtain open. Through it, he saw blue skies and the tops of trees. He briefly considered closing it, but the only person likely to fly by and see inside was Ginny, and even that was doubtful—and Harry liked looking at the sky and the occasional bird as it flew by. He liked sitting back in the pillows. He liked the bed. He liked the beer with its tang of cherry. He liked Malfoy.
Harry, whose gaze had dropped to Malfoy’s collarbone, where the first few buttons of his shirt were undone, was taken aback by the abrupt question. “A ham sandwich and one of those brulee coffees.”
Malfoy squeezed past the woman with the purple-streaked hair to scoop a pastry from the glass case with a pair of tongs. He served that to a customer along with a tall ceramic mug topped with whipped cream. Next was a cup of tea. A sandwich with a cone of chips. A cardboard tray of coffees to go.
, with his so-familiar pale hair falling over his features—looked down and gently pulled Harry’s hands away from where they’d been wrapped loosely over his erection.
At the sound of Draco’s footsteps, Potter looked up from where he hovered above the ground. He’d approximated a supine position and had been gazing up into the bare branches of the hawthorn tree.
“And…what exactly are we doing with this?” he said, wondering if maybe selling shoes would have been the better choice.
too much. He was almost disappointed when Malfoy took his hands away to support Harry’s hips again. But Harry could still feel the ghost of his weight on them, and didn’t try moving them again. He twisted his hands in the duvet.
Harry cast the Fitting Charm and miraculously got it right on the first try. Malfoy raised his eyebrows slightly, which was his only acknowledgement of Harry’s success. He turned to look in the mirror again, made a minute adjustment to the hat’s placement on his head, then removed it.
Draco pursed his lips. He could press Potter, but the other man stared back mulishly. This was the person who had stood down the Dark Lord. Draco wouldn’t get anything out of him that Potter didn’t want to give. Knowing the git, he would just as soon walk away, even if he
The smell of it reminded Harry of Malfoy. Hell, the entire process reminded him of Malfoy—mixing the ingredients, kneading the dough, shaping it. Harry didn’t say anything about it. What was there to say? The smell of baking bread should not have made Harry feel bad. Thoughts of Malfoy should not have made Harry feel bad.
In the end, it was the five of them: Harry, Ginny, Luna, Malfoy, and Parkinson. Harry braced himself for more taunting from Parkinson, but she was surprisingly subdued today. She gave him a polite nod when they all met on the little hill, but otherwise directed her attention to Luna as Luna finished walking circles around the spot that would become the new home for the tree.
, Malfoy. Just give me what you served me yesterday, you dick. The coffee thing with fancy bits on top. And the bougie bread is fine, thanks.”
Across from him, Malfoy stared at him with an unreadable expression, and Harry tried not to be pleased at the attention from him.
“Fine weather we’re having,” he said, which was his standard greeting, rain or shine, but Draco looked dubiously at the overcast sky anyway, and Edward laughed. “Heard me coming up the road, did you?”
Fact was, after the initial shock of being startled, Draco was relieved out of proportion by Potter’s reappearance. Not that Draco should have been relieved. He
Malfoy scowls, but Harry catches only a flash of the expression before it disappears into the pensieve. Harry braces himself against the edge of the table and plunges in after Malfoy.
“I try.” Draco sipped his tea. See? Civilized. Calm. Tea, toast, then the day starts. No madness before then.
They sat, Harry taking the inside with Ginny next to him and Luna on the outside. The arrangement felt odd to Harry—as if Malfoy and Parkinson were a couple, and he was the third wheel to Ginny and Luna.
His dark thoughts follow him into the bathroom and then down the stairs into the kitchen. He paces, bare feet on chill wooden floor. The space looks unexpectedly normal with the lights on, not like it is the middle of the night. Smells of rosemary and meat still hang in the air.
or hesitated. But she’s had months to adjust to Harry’s situation and lose the soft pity and the fragile worry, months also spent as the mum to a little hellion. She doesn’t hesitate anymore. And deep down, Harry is grateful for that. He’s angry at her words, but only because they’re the truth.
The clock downstairs chimes the hour. Eleven o’clock. It reminds him obliquely of the cuckoo above Malfoy’s door, an image which clashes with his recollection of the haughty, vicious pureblood boy and adds to the growing puzzle of this adult Malfoy. Technically, Harry is still on the job today, but he can’t abide the thought of returning to the office right now.
His words, however, pull Harry out of his reverie. “Whatever happened with you and the girl Weasley?”
, he was going to say, but Luna turned a glowing smile on him, and he said, “You know what? That sounds great. Thank you, Luna.”
“What, Potter? Honestly. They’re in here.” As he spoke, he gave a lazy wave of his wand, and a lamp came on at the other side of the room.
Malfoy’s eyes light up madly, like he’s waiting for something. Like he’s waiting for Harry to take a shot at him.
“I don’t, really. But thanks.” Actually, he does. He really does. His mind is already spinning through considerations: the manor will be well-warded, but on the other hand, his enemies will expect him to go there. “Will you be there with anyone else?”
Harry dutifully scraped them onto the pan Luna proffered, and—at her direction—spread them around to dry.
Ginny was in full-on convulsions now, and Harry’s alarm and confusion rose. “There’s no way Draco Malfoy lives in Oregon and works in a coffee shop.”
“It hasn’t gotten better, but it hasn’t gotten worse. The leaves have curled a bit more since you last saw it, though it looks like the black discoloration has stabilized and it hasn’t lost anymore of them. So that’s a good sign, I think.”
Draco stared in astonishment because…was Potter making a joke about one of his precious friends? And including Draco in on it?
By the time the water is hot and the tea is brewing, Malfoy’s regained his composure and his prickles.
Harry doesn’t say a thing. He waits out Robards’ display of anger, hoping Robards won’t direct any questions to him because he’s not sure what will come out of his mouth. He’s tired and buzzing.
. He realized he was babbling half-incoherently and begging Malfoy. Begging Draco Malfoy to kiss his arse. He laughed at himself, then gasped as Malfoy trailed his tongue close—sending tingles of surprise and pleasure through Harry—close, close—and over his hole.
Evening had fallen by the time he arrived in the attic, damp with sweat and hand tired from clutching the legal pad all day. He leaned in the doorway and looked in at the piles of junk. After being attacked by an almanac, nearly unleashing a deadly gas, and almost walking into a void, chucking a bunch of old stuff seemed…doable.
“Pansy!” Malfoy hissed. He snatched his hat back and jammed it on his head. “I meet plenty of people all day.” He said it as if it were a joke, but there was an edge to his tone.
Before he could try to catch Malfoy’s eye again, the server appeared to take their drink order. Apparently, they had all been there before because all of them ordered their brews with minimal menu-perusing, including Parkinson. Luna and Ginny ordered beers with rhyming names he didn’t remember Charlie mentioning, while Parkinson ordered a Dragon’s Breath (which seemed appropriate for her), and—curiously—Malfoy ordered one of the non-magical beers, although it was a coffee porter, so maybe not a surprise. The server came to Harry last, and Harry felt the attention of the rest of the group on him.
Luna and Ginny were already waiting for him in the living room when he came down twenty minutes later. A cool shower had cleared away most of the daydreamy driftiness—and an orgasm had, uh, certainly helped in that—but Harry was still tipsy from the alcohol. He’d briefly considered asking if they kept a Sobering Potion around, but they were headed to a brewpub, after all, and if Malfoy was going to be there, it probably wouldn’t hurt to be a little well-along already.
All of the gazes at the table were now turned to him, and he realized some kind of response was required. “Er.”
A couple of the potatoes went flying. Ginny snatched one from the air. Harry dropped the basket to snatch the other.
Draco regarded Potter. He was trying to decide what really grated on him. Did it rub him the wrong way that an auror so clueless could be allowed on the force? Or was it that it seemed more and more like Potter was purposefully excluding something?
“Charming,” Malfoy drawled. “Come on, Potter. This way. Before you break one of my coffee machines simply by existing too close to them.”
And thinking about it makes Harry’s chest constrict a little, almost like it does when his magical core pulls on his lungs, and he’s worried for a moment that it’s an attack. But it’s not. It’s just an emotion he can’t name, coming from a source within him he’d forgotten existed.
Harry blinked and realized he hadn’t even looked at the menu. He glanced up. His eyes glazed at the number of choices.
“Why not? Better now than in another decade. We might as well get along since we share friends. And if Luna and Ginny say you’re all right, then you must be.”
The fourth time their hands tangle on the cards, Harry suspects it isn’t an accident at all. Malfoy has a little smirk at the corner of his mouth. His fingers are too sure in their movement. Soft fingertips drag over the back of Harry’s hand. It’s a ploy to break his attention, and it works.
As he entered the shop and the little bell rang above him, Harry realized he was planning to count on Malfoy for something, which was
Once, Malfoy glanced up to find Harry watching. His expression turned unreadable. Then he scrunched his nose and turned away, grabbing a loaf from one of the racks behind the counter.
That really only leaves the question: what do they expect the DMLE to do, exactly? They had to know the surveillance would find nothing on Malfoy. Or maybe they hoped that the tracing charms would turn something up on Malfoy—anything. After all, who expects a former Death Eater to lead a completely innocent life. But even if the charms didn’t unearth something for law enforcement to pin on Malfoy, they had to be angling to give him trouble. Disrupt his life with information requests and auror visits and hearings—all the while heaping his character with suspicion (as if Malfoy doesn’t already struggle with that) to decrease the trustworthiness the public would put in his research.
He walked a while down unfamiliar streets till he came to one that was more familiar, and he realized he’d come to one of the magical alleys—the one with the hat shop. He immediately dismissed the thought of visiting Sophie and the hats. Maybe sometime before he left, he would go in and say goodbye—but not when he risked getting sucked into making sales.
Then the ground under his feet and the air around him trembled, and the fairies blasted away, screaming. The summer sun once more flooded over him.
The press jumps at that, asking so many questions it’s hard to distinguish their voices. Harry raises an impatient hand.
He leveled off sharply when he’d reached the middle of the lit space. He scanned the air, but he wasn’t looking for the Snitch.
“And three tablespoons of milk.” Draco closed the door behind them. “Left Kara at home, then?” He hoped he sounded the right amount acerbic and not at all disappointed or concerned.
“Good,” Harry said, although this couldn’t be right. He couldn’t be facing a thirty-year-old Draco Malfoy over a Muggle till, exchanging bland pleasantries. Malfoy, with half an American accent. “You own a coffee shop,” he said, though there was a question in it. That wasn’t right, either. So he quirked his mouth and sniffed. “Never thought I’d live to see this day.”
“For a while,” Harry muttered. Well, it was true. It wasn’t like he hadn’t noticed how attractive men were since—since Hogwarts, probably. Malfoy didn’t need to know that he’d only really started to suspect recently.
It was fascinating to hear the posh lilt come out in his voice despite the jarring use of “garbage” rather than “rubbish”—almost enough that the insult nearly slid over Harry.
Harry glowered, tears itchy and drying on his face, refusing to break eye contact. Let Malfoy get a good look, if that was what he wanted.
Meanwhile, Draco scanned the screen of leaves above, searching for movement or a tell-tale flash of white fur.
They arrived at the back door, and Draco felt a moment of panic as he glanced out the square window panes and spied the silver bars of the creature cages gleaming in the overcast light. Edward had slowed behind him—oh, he had paused to inspect the portrait; Draco
Malfoy only raises an eyebrow, and Harry feels relief, just relief, when he then turns in the direction of the drawing room. Harry trails behind, ignoring the way the straight, narrow shoulders fill his shirt and the way the trousers fit snugly against the slim waist.
“I say!” the duchess said as Draco ran by fast enough to clip the edge of a cabinet with his hip—the one previously uninjured. He cursed, stumbled, opened the back door, and hobbled into the garden, pain still spreading along his nerves.
He could almost hear a voice in his head sneering that Harry had got used to his adoring fans. The voice sounded suspiciously like Draco Malfoy’s. And the irritating thing was, the voice was kind of right. Harry
Luna smiled. “Hi, Harry. Would you like to do the honors of Apparating us? Since you know where we’re going.”
This is exactly what Robards is trying to avoid: publicity, and for this case to blow up into something bigger. This is the opposite of Harry sweeping the debris under a rug.
“All right,” Harry says, slowly, as he absorbs this, his voice calm despite the fact that his throat is squeezed tight. “But you flooed me, and you’re here. Did Hermione tell you I was helping you?”
“Tsk. Ron. Harry, you’re not going to be a barista.” She said it in the same tone Molly used when telling George,
Malfoy’s tone was mild enough, but it still caught Harry a bit off guard. He’d been replaying the image of Malfoy diving and laughing. His slight smile fell into a frown. He glanced at Malfoy. “You weren’t half-bad yourself.”
