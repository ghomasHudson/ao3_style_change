“Bloody hell, Potter! You better fix it right after or I swear you’re really going to regret it!”
“Let the party begin!” he shouted before wrapping his arms around the shoulders of two of his friends and walking away, hilariously.
Harry frowned as he tried to unravel the situation.  What student would be so disturbed that he would be plunged him into an indeterminate sleep?
“I never forced you to do anything about me. You were the first to tease me” Harry said, crossing his arms on his chest.
Harry took great inspiration and anchored his eyes in Malfoy’s. Malfoy displayed a victorious, almost sadistic smile that had the effect of upsetting Harry who then advanced to attack him. But Malfoy spoke before Harry had time.
Harry frowned, finally seeming to reconnect with reality.
A pretty young woman stood before him, a little smile adorning her lips made of rose. His long brown hair cascaded down from curls on his shoulders, his hazel eyes gently looked at him, his long lashes touching almost the top of his eyelids.
” he mumbled, still angry at having to postpone the preparation of this bloody cure.
“I’m about to contact your friends through the floo, maybe you’ll listen to them,” he explained without bothering to turn around.
“Oh fuck, Hermione! Sorry, mate but I have to run…” Ron exclaimed, letting go of his shoulder.
“Girls… Always looking for good where there is none...” Ron sighed, shaking his head with spite.
“No Malfoy, I’m not going anywhere. Not until you answer me.”
Ron shook his head negatively before turning it towards the door leaf.
Harry pinched his lips before giving himself the courage to repeat.
Shamefully, he hoped that perhaps Malfoy had experienced feelings similar to his own at that very moment. Because he didn’t think it was possible to feel something that strong for someone. A feeling so powerful that it became painful. And if he wasn’t the only one who lived it, then it wasn’t his own… He wouldn’t be the only person to stand out for his many faculties that made his fucking fame.
They blinked, slowly detached, regaining a correct distance between them.
Walking down a paved driveway, they leaned on a barrier that ran along it and quietly finished their ice cream in silence.
Swallowing with difficulty, he squeezed the flask a little in the palm of his hand, before turning to the Pensieve to deposit the memory meticulously.
Harry moved forward leaving the door open behind him.
Ron was actually already sitting in one of the armchairs in the living room, sipping a cup of tea in discussion with Malfoy sitting on the couch.
Dumbledore stared at him intensely, his blue eyes gleaming strangely as a smile stretched his lips.
Harry opened his mouth and took out his tongue to pass through Malfoy’s lips and embrace his. Malfoy let him do it with a fleeting appetite and tightened his hand on his neck to bring him closer.
He forgot Malfoy and his indisposition and jumped into of Ron and Hermione’s arms, shouting the name of his beloved. Ginny flew up to them and made a perilous jump to greet them. The exclamations resounded even louder as she walked around the stands.
Harry reflected for a moment, confused by the young man’s way of speaking to him.
"What did you say, Harry?" Ginny asked.
“But that’s exactly why I came to talk to you. To warn you that it was over, all this bullshit... Then, you’ll be nice to go fuck yourself!” Harry scolded.
Harry took the time to swallow his sip before dropping his pint and licking his lips.
Harry could distinguish the light blue that covered part of his nostril where his fist had hit. He slowly lowered his eyes, ashamed of having lost his composure so much while he was the only one responsible.
"Merry Christmas to you, too, Scarhead!" he shouted, smirking.
As he positioned himself in front of his classroom with Ron, his eyes stuck in the eyes of his not-exactly-enemy, he saw Malfoy walking towards him and thought for a moment that he was about to talk to him.
He had a slight jolt when he felt Ron’s weight leave the bench before hearing the wooden feet gently scrape the ground when he rose.
“It’s amazing that you got out so quickly,” Nott added, staring at him, with an excited look.
"You're going to make me think you don't know?" he asked again, shaken by his recent laugh.
And he wasn't wrong, Potter and his gang were the first to stop making disparaging remarks to him as soon as they had the misfortune to meet.
Theodore Nott was standing in front of the doorway, looking as shocked as he did.
As usual, he and Ron were doing it at the last minute to study, they had both been very busy.
Draco was convinced that Harry had no intention of revealing his meeting with Theo and was determined to know the outcome. So he had went to his old classmate’s strange office and had knocked on the door. Theo’s voice had been heard behind the door, inviting him to enter and he had not been begged to do so.
Potter’s eyes darkened instantly when his mouth met his fingers, avidly following his gesture as Draco kissed them one by one, gradually lowering into the hollow of his palm where he laid a burning kiss.
“What, is that a secret?” Harry asked, crossing his arms on his chest.
Harry flattened his hands on his face, bringing them back to his hair, pressing his palms on his forehead, elbows in the air.
OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoO
The next day, he woke up next to Ginny, no dream had disturbed his sleep and he sighed of contentment when he noticed that all his thoughts were turned on his girlfriend.
“Are you kidding me? You just fucking hit me!”
Her lips were warm and slightly chapped. They were too thin, and the kiss deviated a little to the side.
“Oh yes you did... Do I have to remind you that you
“It suits you to say that when I just emptied your balls. I still have the sticky hand of your sperm” Harry sneered, rubbing his fingers.
The walls of the room were decorated with several wizard paintings, including beautiful landscapes, moving quietly in their frame.
"I know" he heard Ron reply.
Malfoy had glanced at him silently, his cup at the height of his mouth, where he sometimes blew on the smoke that emanated from it. He had had a sip of it before putting it on the coffee table and joining his hands together, his eyes firmly resting on it.
It was almost terrifying this need to see him, to want him that way. Admitting it, was even more disturbing. It had been very complicated to feel desire for his lifelong enemy and if now Harry had gotten used to the idea, he just couldn’t believe it even though they had just had sex.
Harry noticed that this young man was different from the one he saw at the Quidditch game. He squeezed his teeth, remembering Malfoy sticking his tongue in the throat of the first stranger.
Draco sneered, looking up at the sky to see that Potter was standing where he had been a few minutes earlier.
Draco sketched a new smile, crossing Potter's sparkling gaze in front of him, as his friends handed him packages all carefully packed.
He felt absolutely unable to return to work for today. He was in dire need of a break and alcohol was the best way he knew to cloud his mind.
Harry tipped, his foot meeting the first step of the small staircase that preceded the door and felt his body bending dangerously, preparing for the fall.
Harry blinked as he resumed his breath. Malfoy had finally let go of his hand and moved back enough to have no contact with him.
He felt Malfoy’s hands grabbing his hair, while he eagerly responded to the kiss and let his tongue enter his mouth to embrace hers.
Malfoy smothered a groan and surreptitiously closing his eyes.
"Harry, are you sure you’re all right?" he finally asked, looking worried.
"You’re not joining us?" Malfoy asked, who had obviously abused witch cigarettes to offer them such an invitation.
Harry shook his head, chasing this stupid idea out of his mind, already too disturbed by the last few days.
Blaise made a long whistle and grinned to Harry.
He remembered being dragged by Harry into a shop far too silly to his liking, pink and white all over the shelves, frames and hearts swirling on the ceiling.
“Blaise? What is this impromptu visit worth?” Draco asked, raising a suspicious eyebrow.
‘Cause it was the eyes of the one he loved, because it was Potter and nothing had animated him as he had done. As he continued to do… And even then, despite the lack of memories that might remind him of how much he loved him too…
“I don’t know, maybe guys just like him?” he dared in a neutral tone.
He risked a glance at the door of his room and then turned completely to face it.
heart. Fear increased as Hermione continued to look at him to see him through.
But he did not have time to intervene, Harry’s heart had already exploded in his chest, his green eyes were already drowning in Malfoy’s grey ones.
enemy...
Not physically, although he gained muscle, he still had such messy hair and round glasses on his nose.
Draco had clenched his teeth, intimating himself to remain calm in front of this fucking prick who had taken a clever pleasure, it seemed, to show him that he had the full power over the situation.
“Fuck it! Come on! Stop making yourself pray and get your ass back! …. And before you open it again, it’s not a question!” Ron ended, seeing Harry about to retaliate.
, if the guy I’m interested in didn’t have someone else in mind right now, it would probably already be
The pain that hammered his heart made him feel particularly gloomy, reducing his morale to the lowest. As for the ball that had formed in his throat, it did not seem to want to deflate, completely clogging his oesophagus and preventing his from swallowing anything.
Harry shivered, closing his eyes under the damp and warm effect of Malfoy’s tongue against his skin.
“A simple precaution, in the event that your trauma is far too great to contain,” he explained, ironically.
Harry did not blink and squint his eyes dangerously towards him. He swallowed nervously under the intensity of his cold gaze, feeling his hairs bristle along his arms so much the exchange was striking, the excitement rising up along his dorsal spine to finally have his attention.
Just feeling the weight of his body was exhausting. The rough sheets against his skin irritated him, as if he had spent several months lying in a bed without ever getting up.
Harry, sitting in front of Ron, leaned forward to look at Dean’s sketch more closely.
He really had to calm down, he had to forget that scene from the past and focus on his studies and his relationship with Ginny.
“Are you sure you didn’t leave them lying around somewhere later?”
Harry glared at him before stretching a smirk.
It was clearly not normal what had just happened, he knew it, deep down, Harry had
Harry loved the excitement in the stands during a game, the adrenaline ignited his body, rising up to his spine, making him shudder with pleasure.
“I’m dreaming? Yes, that’s probably it, I’m in the middle of a nightmare,” he added for himself.
Yeah, except he didn’t know shit about that.
Yes, he definitely had to be much more careful in the future.
Potter stopped his friction movements against the plate and leaned his head back as he sighed.
His heart was shaking, when he thinking about it.
Harry did not understand what was happening to him, but the hatred he felt at that moment exceeded anything he had ever felt for Malfoy from as far back as he remembered.
He wasn’t even thirsty; he just came in here to get one foot down for the night. Her throat was too tight anyway to swallow anything. The mere fact of swallowing his saliva was already too much for his stomach which painfully contracted to remember what he had done. About what he’d broken forever.
It was almost laughable to know that it was Malfoy who had chosen his outfit. Getting dressed by him was more than absurd.
Harry looked in his mind for a clue that might put him on the trail, but nothing came to him.
He had delicate but also very masculine facial features. Harry had always envied Malfoy’s class and charisma. Not that he was jealous of it, but he knew that his own outfit, on the other hand, seemed almost neglected. And that fucking aristocrat, in spite of the war, still as classy, had the ability to put him off!
"No…you can't be serious…"
He felt his throat tightening when thinking about Malfoy, it was something he wanted to forget, but the memory of what he had done remained firmly anchored in his mind and his low stomach reacted every time he crossed his head.
For him, for Ginny…
He was lying naked on the bed and Malfoy on top of him was practically naked too. He detailed his thin bust his pearly skin so sexy. He lowered his eyes to his belly button and then to his hard-on cock that was pointing at him. His own was just below and he felt blush by this sudden closeness.
He squeezed Ginny tighter and Malfoy’s smile widened, revealing his white teeth, before finally giggling. Then he detached his eyes from Harry and started a conversation with Blaise Zabini who had turned to talk to him.
the dream you invented and the most fascinating thing about it, Harry, is that it makes it a full-fledged reality in a universe parallel to ours.””
Draco looked at him without blinking and then nodded.
Harry blinked, to make the point as his view had become terribly disturbed since he had started drinking and then because he was not sure if he had understood what he had just heard.
Years they had swept everything away, years they were just Harry and Draco, and now everything was going up in flames…
Harry frowned.
The muscles of his lower belly were contracting painfully, indicating that he was nearing the end. So he encircled Potter’s back with his arms, pinned it totally against his body and accentuated his desperate gestures.
And Harry was...
He vaguely remembered Nott, this student always in his corner, rather lonely and very discreet, never drawing attention to him.
was one of the best of his generation and was fully aware of it.” Malfoy sneered, looking back to his book.
“You don’t have to worry about that anymore, your role in the war is over” he tried to comfort him.
Malfoy gently pushed every inches of his dick against his ass, slowly getting inside him. Harry was impressed by the delicacy he displayed contrary to his own habits. He had always been brutal when he took Malfoy and prepared him quickly without being tender. He always did according to the moans he made and as soon as he seemed to get a hit, he entered into him without even asking him.
“I hate to see you with all these guys hanging around you, I can’t stand that they can touch you when I don’t...” he added, clenching his teeth.
Harry swiftly turned his eyes to the dial of the clock, which had a time of 00:30 before he placed one hand on his forehead.
Harry detailed the many shelves filled with jars of all kinds, whose labels bore the names of various potions or ingredients. He thought he was in Snape’s personal stash and felt a pinch in his heart when he thought about Hogwarts.
He closed his eyes and thrust his nails into the flesh of his palms to contain the breath of hatred that overwhelmed him. He struggled to swallow so much that the muscles of his jaw were so tight and clenched his teeth so tightly that he would not have been surprised to feel them crack.
He felt pulled back but tried to resist. Malfoy stopped and pulled him harder to force Harry to turn around. Harry had kept his eyes closed, and when he opened them again, he plunged into a grey ocean where bright lights that it reflected.
"But it can be fixed, Potter," replied Malfoy, with a devastating smile on his lips.
Malfoy rolled his eyes, looking exasperated before he looked down on him.
“Absolutely. This was not the case before you did it, but you yourself created an opening to another universe simply by using your subconscious.” he explained, passing his wand on the pile of Cauldron Cakes on his left to the right to demonstrate his theory.
So he maximized his chances to keep Harry from coming back. If the fact that he did not remember anything for ten years made him feel like to have a dagger in the heart, to imagine him killing himself by destroying the rest was all the more painful.
“Potter? But what are you doing here? You’re not at the game?” he asked, puzzled.
He sighed, before taking out his wand, rolling his eyes.
A renewed hope filled Draco’s heart with these words and he could not prevent a slight grin, which he quickly swept before nodding.
Potter looked up to him, a mixture of surprise and incomprehension shining in his green eyes.
Harry closed his eyes and took a deep breath that stuck in his lungs. He focused on the spell he wanted to cast and the object that would be impacted. He clearly visualized Neville’s wand and saw it fly away from his hands once the spell was pronounced.
He felt less alone now, surrounded by a loved one whom he recognized, someone who had not changed, a pillar which he desperately needed to move on.
He thought he’d come back to a normal life after kindly recalling Malfoy and his explicit need to go further. He had foolishly allowed himself to be consumed by jealousy, seeing Malfoy so coveted by the various young men circling him.
Harry wrinkled his eyes at him with contempt, before slowly pulling his hand out of his pants.
Harry had always had great regard for Neville. Especially since last year when, thanks to him, a horcrux had been killed. And not just any… That fucking Nagini.
He already saw the headlines spread on the cover of the newspapers in bold with a picture of him claiming “Harry Potter, saviour of the wizard world, leaves his fiancée just a month from their wedding”. He could imagine the sheer number of letters he would receive to get to the whole story…
Harry spent all his emotions in that kiss, trying to express all craving he had for him, all the lack he had felt of having had him so far in the past few weeks. He closed his eyelids tightly, concentrating more than ever on letting all his feelings flow in the way he kissed him. Applied more than usual to show him that he was more than determined.
As for Hermione, she had abandoned her teenage body for that of a beautiful, blossoming young woman.
Nothing happened, however, it was as if blocked and totally unable to make its magic work.
Malfoy ended up pinching his lips in a very thin bitter line before swallowing and lowering his eyes. He stared at the floor for a few seconds and then raised his head to turn it towards the stage without a look for him.
Harry undertook long back and forth while lowering his mouth on Malfoy’s chin, biting the muscles of his jaw, then on the thin skin of his neck which he licked avidly, putting kisses on his collarbone, and accelerating his hand on Malfoy’s sex who no longer restrained his moaning.
Potter raised his eyebrows to Blaise's corner smile.
Harry sighed and looked away to plant it on a corner of Ron’s bed.
«Ten years... ten years of my life gone up in smoke... » he blew, in a sob.
Malfoy sneered, stretching his lips enough to make part of his teeth appear.
So he had been in class and made the effort to participate in the conversations and touch Ginny as much as he could. Trying to be reassured…
Draco raised his arm between their bodies to enclose Potter’s waist and quietly put his hand on his hip before holding his breath and having them both Side-Along.
“Potter… Are you feeling okay?”
Potter ended up sitting down too, putting the parchment beside him before sticking his incredible green eyes in his own.
It’s been weeks since Harry was convinced something was up.
and the man of his life.
Draco saw clearly the burning desire illuminating Potter’s gaze as he stared at his mouth. Harry’s lips opened as he slowly leaned his head to the side and brought his face close to his. Draco tensed up instantly, while Potter’s eyelids were lowered, showing a last green glow before closing completely by reducing the gap between their lips.
“I’m ready to go further this time” Harry promised.
Harry wrinkled his eyes but simply glared at him and didn’t fight back.
“Since when Hermione make a deal with the Slytherins?” he asked, undoubtedly troubled by this latest information.
Potter’s grin widened as he laid his beautiful green eyes in his own, arrogantly.
As soon as he wanted to put his hand on the handle, a magical field pushed his arm back, preventing him from accessing it.
He suffocated in his presence and felt Weasel’s inquisitive gaze behind his back.
The assumption that ten years had passed seemed increasingly plausible in view of their physical changes.
OoOoO
“It’s not poisoned if that’s what you think,” he answered, Harry’s dumb silent question.
In a startle, Draco opened his eyes, holding his breath in his lungs, recognizing Ron’s voice through the sound of the kettle on the fire.
“Oh, that’s an interesting idea! What are we waiting for?”
“Potter, stay where
” on the front of the paper.
So the guy followed Malfoy’s glance and fell on Harry’s, who automatically turned his eyes to stick them in the starry sky. His heart was pounding and he was breathing hard. His cock was still pulsating and he really wanted to deal with it!
An awkward silence ensued between them, leaving room for the music, the bursts of voices and the laughter of their classmates echoing in the room.
Harry blinked before figure it out what his best friend was telling him.
“You’re right, I would most certainly be devastated” he said, in a tone filled with bitterness.
“It’s okay, you can go, I’m done” Malfoy replied as he turned to him with a smile.
He focused his attention on Ron, who had recovered his cup of tea, drinking a new sip before smiling at him again.
He had never been sucked in this way, never to the point of losing his mind and of letting himself totally get into Malfoy’s bed. Malfoy was the only one who made him go through this, making him lose his head so much that he kissed him rather than hit him. Being in need of his gazes and his voice for over a month. Not being able to let go of him when he passed him in a corridor.
"You invite me in or you let me rot here?" Harry replied.
“I told you, this is our home,” he said, calmly.
“Yes… He won’t come back if that’s what you want to know” he said in a dragging tone.
Ron stood up and walked up to him, grabbing his shoulders and getting close to him to force him to look him in the eyes.
His eyelids pounded frantically as Malfoy’s expert mouth rose and descended on his sex. He rolled up his foreskin, which pounded against the roof of Malfoy’s mouth, and put shivers on him that wound up in his whole body.
He could not decently thank Malfoy for choosing these clothes, much less be grateful to him since they were pure enemies in his mind.
Harry turned to the side before throwing up the leftovers from his dinner on his shoes. He coughed before he got up and took out his wand to clean.
It was Malfoy who guided him and he felt his own hand move in rhythm with his. He wanted Malfoy to have pleasure, because he also took it.
“What do you mean?” he asked, wrinkling his eyes suspiciously.
He closed his eyes and squeezed the sheets between his fingers when Ginny accentuated his movements on his dick.
"Let me show you" he replied, in a hoarse voice, standing on his elbows.
OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoO
Harry slowly looked up to look at him and Draco felt once again lost in mind by the intensity of his green eyes. Then, still with a marked slowness, Potter lowered his gaze on his plate and resumed his meal where he had left it.
“Of course, I hate you Potter, how can you even doubt it?”
“It all depends on what you plan to do with my ass…” he added, in a smirk.
Malfoy had become his drug, and he was taking more than enough. The very idea of knowing that he was so close to him electrified him far more than he would have liked.
“It could have been much worse…” he whispered before closing his eyes, firmly grabbing several dark strands between his fingers.
“I didn’t get lost! It’s cold and apparently I’m not walking as fast as you.” He hissed, before forcing a slight crisp smile.
“Aren’t you supposed to find your fiancée, Potter?” he asked, always contemplating the flames that danced in the hearth of the fireplace.
And he had to be half drunk to figure it out.
“To our fiancées, who make us cloistered here, to flee all that concerns the wedding preparations?”
Maybe Malfoy really liked him? He himself found his company rather pleasant when they did not spend their time insulting each other.
He was particularly relieved not to see their face surely worried about his condition which he imagined quite pitiful at that moment.
He looked like Malfoy but did not act like Malfoy, didn’t look at him with that despicable glance that he had always been destined for him.
A silence settled for a few moments, before Blaise resumed speaking.
Yes. If he dared to. If he touch Potter the way he wanted to… It would destroy him…
That’s the phrase that’s been running around in his head ever since he thought about her more often than he ever did before.
"Are you hungry?" he asked, raising an eyebrow.
Malfoy stretched his lips slightly before sneering.
He startled slightly when Ron’s hand fell brutally on a table before his murderous gaze fell into his green eyes.
He never thought it would end this way, but life is sometimes filled with surprises that are not suspected…
“Never again do I want to relive such a thing, even the war seemed sweeter next to what Mom put me through…” He then turned to Harry and looked him in the eye.
He pushed them aside slightly to see that they were not round as usual, but rectangular and finer.
“And so do you!” Draco retorted, in a smirk.
A wide smile split Nott’s lips as he quietly stowed his wand under his shirt, looking down on him.
He said, pointing his wand at the packet to get the Cauldron Cakes out.
"As your friend just told you, I came to have an explanation with you," Harry replied, putting his hand down and stuffing it in his trouser pocket.
Did it really happen?
It was as if someone had upset the order of things. As if, a part of the story had been coldly torn to leave only a crumpled paper ball. A missing square in the history of his life, where only the first fruits of an unfinished drawing would be represented.
“Another who would have done better not to mess with him…” Ron sneered.
“Well, have a good ev-”
- dates, just after Harry wanked him. Malfoy had refused to return the favor because he was tired of never going any further.
“What?” he asked, perplexed and somewhat annoyed to be disturbed in his introspection.
In a final sigh he drew his hand into the pocket of his pants and licked his lips as he slowly rose from the bench. He took a deep breath and headed head down towards his dorm. He would roll the pebbles under his shoes by dragging his feet and beat the bigger ones to the sides of the aisle.
"Yes I did" Malfoy simply replied.
The vacation would allow him to forget him a little while he stayed with his adopted family for a few days before returning to campus.
Harry tried to calm his ardour a little, without however obscuring Malfoy from his thoughts. He remembered the moment of complicity they had shared, when Malfoy had for a moment abandoned his impassive mask, making him more agreeable than usual and unveiled a facet of his personality that he had particularly appreciated.
“Great, ‘cause I’d no intention of being nice to someone like you” he replied.
Harry allowed himself to be disturbed by Malfoy’s gentle gestures as he turned his palm to examine it. He could not help deflecting his gaze at his roommate’s face, concentrating on his task.
"You are serious?" he added, perplexed.
Draco took the time to stare at him, happy with the small advance they had gained in only one late evening. He had not expected so much from the Harry of his past, but Potter was unquestionably unpredictable and would never cease to surprise him as he lived with him.
No, he always looked the same as the one he knew.
Draco leaned over the pan, lifting the lid to check that everything was cooking properly, and stirring for a few moments before closing to simmer.
“The rumors were well founded from what I saw,” he said, before turning his worrying gaze on Harry again.
When he climbed into the elevator shaft, his heart was horribly heavy, and his throat was tightly squeezed. He had not yet pressed the button on his floor and was contemplating the dark and bright corridor of the Department of Mysteries. The torches diffused their bluish light which reflected on the whole of the walls with a hypnotizing side.
"Oh, that’s what we did! You couldn’t hear, you kept going, I had fucking no choice!"
It was a long time, not without problems, but they had held out, they had resisted and now Harry was sharing his life, an integral part of his family.
Harry immediately froze when he saw him sitting on his bed reading a Quidditch magazine nibbling Fizwizbiz.
“But you said you found their hideout?” Harry replied, louder, the hope he felt at the announcement of the probable arrest of those responsible for his amnesia went up in smoke.
"So, what do you want me to call what we do?" Malfoy asked, in a dragging voice.
He planted his nails in the flesh of his palm where the powder continued to fall as his eyes filled with tears. His throat was tightly squeezed as he slowly became aware of his feelings.
“I don’t know, maybe because I don’t feel like you still do?”
"I leave you the room, I’ll sleep on the couch" he said, slowly rising.
Draco could feel the warmth of Harry against his palm and he had great difficulty not to hold it tighter. Instead, and because the temptation became too strong, as he kept it in his, he stroked the back of Potter’s hand, gently. Feeling the grain of the soft epidermis under the skin of his thumb made rough by his manual work of making potions, was a little happiness that he no longer believed possible yesterday.
He was the only one doing this to himself and he couldn’t stop.
Harry closed his eyes, biting his lower lip so as not to moan louder.
Harry threw his head back, pinching his lips, before finally closing his eyes to the overwhelming pain that forced the barriers of his mind.
Their jerky breaths filled the room and their warm breaths crushed each other on their still tightly bound, oozing bodies.
“Or, Nott is a fucking asshole and besides selling me his science infuses and belittle me, he works in no way for that purpose” he retorted, cynically.
Malfoy let him do it, examining every move he made, visibly expecting Harry to stop and leave again. But Harry, sure of himself, began to unbuckle his belt and blow the buttons out of his pants, prompting him to remove it entirely.
Harry was almost offended about that. Malfoy had clearly messing with him and he could not let this go by without saying anything. He had to pay. That asshole had to explain why he sudden stoped everything.
“Thank you, but I think I’m going to bed, I’ve eaten too much,” Harry replied, falsely contrite.
However, now that the subject had been put on the table, he knew that he could never sleep without the certainty that Voldemort had died during the war. Whatever Malfoy and his friends say.
Harry crushed his lips on those of Malfoy, in a most vertiginous kiss, releasing Malfoy’s erection to wrap his arms behind his back and lift him to deepen the kiss.
“I think I won’t be long anyway,” Ron tells him, as if he was reading his mind.
Obviously, his popularity hadn’t waned, and he suspected that sharing the life of someone like Malfoy surely didn’t make it any better.
Of course, it ended pretty badly. Malfoy, having failed to move the book by the sheer force of his mind, had grabbed his wand and sent it to crash against a wall under anger. Harry had to calm him down and explain to him that it took time to get there the first time, and that after that, everything would go by itself without really needing to concentrate.
"I promise you, we’ll do everything we can to get your memories back as soon as possible" he whispered, when he finally put his palm on Potter’s hand.
Harry was forced to put his hand on his mouth to stifle the laughter he had failed to control and bit the inside of his cheek so as not to make more noise and draw attention to himself. Ron had a pronounced startle at his side and immediately raised his head in a light snore. He blinked several times before squinting them and looking at the stage as if he had never dozed off.
Malfoy stared at him intensely, a wound inside of his eyes.
Dumbledore gave him a small indulgent smile before resuming.
Harry frowned, more and more disturbed by the strangeness of the situation, searching in his memories if he had ever been confronted with such particular events without finding a single one.
“I don’t run away”
When the elevator stopped, they get out to the indicated floor, moving closer to the small reception post that stood in the middle of the central aisle.
Harry, who always stared at his hands with furrowing eyebrows, cautiously raised his head in his direction, looking away at Draco’s fingers anchored on the table and opened wide his eyes.
He had rarely seen anyone so sure of himself and so calm. It was evident that Nott had belonged to the house of the Slytherins, his malicious and aristocratic side was exhaling with all his being. But he had a very erudite side that might have suggested that he was part of the Ravenclaws, because he looked so witty.
He opened the window delicately to catch one of the bottles at random, to read the word that was written there.
He remembered attending Ginny’s match with Ron and Hermione, then seeing Malfoy kissing Noah. He had decided to leave the match, feeling the jealousy win to him and had crossed paths with the young man at the bottom of the stands, who making him understand that Malfoy was already seeing someone.
Everything had been too good that night, his desire for Malfoy, already particularly pronounced, had increased sharply when he had get inside him, feeling Malfoy everywhere around him.
explain to me what is happening here, I don’t understand anything anymore..." Harry added, hoping she can help him see things through.
“Hey! You could answer when I’m talking to you! What’s your problem, Potter?” he spit out, with a wicked gaze.
This is why Harry was there, jumping almost on the spot, cooled, and to give himself the courage to face his ex-enemy again, for reasons that he himself did not confess.
Ron to the right, laughed brightly, snaking the air, leaning on his broomstick, pushing a little to overtake him.
OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoO
"What the fuck are you talking about?"
As if a huge weight had been removed from him, from the moment Malfoy had put his lips on his. Dropping his glass that fell to the ground, he kept his eyes open too shocked to deign to close them.
Harry stared at him, a determined glimmer shining down his irises.
Malfoy once again focused all his attention on Noah, totally disinterested in Harry, who opened wide his eyes before sighing with contempt.
Harry resisted and drew deep down, to bring out his magic even more. The soft blue light between his fingers intensified and crystals formed around the candlestick, replacing the powder that had settled there.
“I could ask you the same question.”
He advanced a few steps before finding himself in front of the ugly stone gargoyle that guarded the director’s office.
"Well, I'll leave you, have a good New Year's Eve," he said in a sad voice, before turning his heels to move away again.
Harry could see in his eyes the path of his reflection, as a genius who seeks a way to solve his equation.
Harry jolted, acknowledging the tone of that voice between a thousand and turned his head sharply in his direction.
This sod didn't realize, of course, that he was standing just below the mistletoe branch from which Draco had shifted.
“Fuck, yes!” Harry exclaimed, making large gestures of his arms and then came towards him to find himself a few inches from his face.
“All right, Potter, so you’re going to get back on the bed and I’m going to get you off the ground like you’ve never done before in your life.” he assured, his lips a few inches from Harry’s.
He turned his head in his direction while pulling out his magic wand in a defensive reflex.
Harry glanced at him, frowning.
OoOoO
Harry sneered slightly before clearing his throat.
Nott gauged him for a moment before answering him in a voice almost as dragging as Malfoy’s.
“I do make it a point to reserve this aspect of my personality only in your presence.” he affirmed, with his dragging voice.
Harry was not fooled, he had already felt that feeling in his life. He never thought he’d feel
His old friend materialized immediately, his large woods and his vaporous silhouette got closer to him majestically, staring at him with his small piercing eyes.
Draco then raised his head, satisfied with the result. He was about to take his glass back to finish it, turning his body in his direction, when he crossed two blue eyes a few inches from his face and a mysterious mouth stole a new kiss from him.
Then Harry’s voice resounded in the room, in an almost imperceptible breath.
Draco had done everything possible to shorten his working day in order to save Harry from being alone too long.
“Maybe if you stopped acting like I didn’t exist, I could even show you.”
Leaning his head gently forward, he could feel Malfoy’s warm breath caressing his face as he inevitably approached his thin lips, inviting him to take them. Harry filled the last inches, crushing his mouth against Malfoy’s mouth, sticking his tongue in to revel in the taste of Malfoy who tore a deep moan from him.
Harry turned to one of the cabinets to detail it, going through the different vials where labels indicated a keyword of the memory they contained.
“I’m sorry to get to this, and believe me when I tell you it hurts me, but I have no choice…You really need to calm down, Har… Potter” he blew.
He paused and reread the last sentence he had just written and passed his hand between his glasses to rub his tired eyes. He then raised his head and beating his eyelids to focus on his view.
Harry passed his hand over his cheek, down his neck and his collarbone and pressed on his shoulder to force him to lie down. Malfoy tensed himself but let himself be, without letting go of his eyes, his impassive look no longer leaving his features.
“It’s not clear enough for you? You want a user manual maybe? It seems to me that you’re no longer in your first time.” he grinned.
A clear and cold sneer escaped from Malfoy’s lips, his abdomen shaking with small tremors as he continued to scowl at him.
“What? Would you prefer me to be more violent?”
!" Harry said, horrified, mimicking with his arms.
Harry frowned at the lack of respect shown by this individual who, in addition to being bloody late, was no more interested in him than if he had been part of the set that covered the room.
Harry took great inspiration and prepared to answer him, but a finger landed on his lips.
The students crossed the gigantic campus with greenish alleys at the end of summer to get to their first classes of the year.
He needed to relieve himself, he had much,
Harry had always been clumsy in his way of expressing himself. He did not think about how to turn his sentence so that it came out well-worded and smooth. All the words that came out of his mouth were raw and brutal, without any filter to soften them.
Malfoy had made him discover every part of his body with the help of his hand before making him touch his cock. Harry tightened his hands on the book, thinking about the texture of Malfoy’s sex between his fingers. He risked a look at him and was happy to see that he was no longer staring at him. His attention had focused on Zabini with whom he was chatting.
But like every time Malfoy found himself in trouble, he ran away, taking advantage of what he had mastered, knowing full well that Harry would let himself go because he too was terribly in the mood.
He should have felt relieved of this new hypothesis but strangely, his heart compressed into his chest and a bitter taste dyed his saliva.
He was, however, inevitably terrified of being taken by Malfoy, but lust took over the fear, prompting him to want to test, just once to know what it would look like… Once, to experience the pleasure felt in this position, Malfoy seemed to appreciate what he was getting him.
"A bit like Hermione at the very beginning" he said.
“What the hell is going on with you?”
Harry let himself go for a moment, enjoying Malfoy’s meticulous movements over his sex before bringing his head forward and biting his lower lip. He leans forward again to kiss his ferociously.
“And why would I do that, tell me?”
Without a word more, Blaise went into the fireplace and left where he came from, leaving him alone in the living room still a little stunned by their last exchange.
Malfoy was still sucking it when Harry’s hands came off the bed and stuffed them in blond, almost white hair. He felt Malfoy flinch and this made him moan louder as Malfoy accelerated again the coming and going of his mouth on his sex.
He remained still, with his quill still in his hand as he searched for his next sentence. A drop of ink fell right next to his last word and he still had no idea what to say next.
Harry suddenly realized that he had just learned Apparition, having succeeded in doing them after only a few courses with Mc Gonnagall, during the few months that elapsed from his sixth year.
Malfoy was pinned to Harry's back and wrinkled the skin of his neck by biting it, licking the epidermis in places to make him moan with pleasure. His hands had slipped under his t-shirt, which he had just put on, and was hurtling through his chest with lust, lingering on his belly, stroking his abdominals and then retracing with the tips of his fingers the line of hair that went down to his groin.
“If you say so ...” Harry replied, without really being convinced.
Harry could feel the tears in his eyes, unable to open them to make it stop.
“Look, I understand that this is complicated for you, but it’s even more complicated for me too, so if you could just make it a little easier it would be greatly appreciated,” he said, between his teeth.
"Listen to me, you fucking ferret, you stop right now what you think you can do, or..."
Nothing had changed, however, whether Malfoy was here or not, he still did not want to go home. He couldn’t help but feel some guilt when he thought of Ginny who might have to wait for him to eat but quickly swept away that feeling when he thought of the many questions he would have to answer once he got home.
Harry raised his eyes higher to meet the cold, grey gaze that had haunted him since he had returned.
He visualized very clearly the location of the original box on a clear desk in accordance with the decoration of the room which he had walked along in the last months of his existence. Harry could still feel the wood rolling under his fingers as he gripped its edges as he struck inside Malfoy’s body.
So he went looking for the sod, half hoping never to run into him and thus avoid the conflict... But as he suspected, it was not difficult to find him...
Harry sighed as he surreptitiously closed his eyes and placed them on the flames of his fireplace.
That was the moment Malfoy chose to Side-Along.
Harry answered nothing, trying to find a regular breath, staring at a point in front of him before frowning and raising his eyes at Malfoy.
He then moved rapidly in his direction, pushing Harry in his path to move the vial. Raising his arm to grab the bottle, he was abruptly stopped by Potter who grabbed his wrist, preventing him from going to the end.
Harry frowned, assembling the elements in his mind to try to determine if what he was saying was true. After a brief reflection, he shook his head and prepared to deny.
And Harry dreamt of Malfoy…
“Yeah… Speaking of which, as I explained to Draco, I have some important news to tell you.” He exclaimed, in a deep voice.
Harry knew he should have worried about his heart beating too fast at the mere thought that Malfoy was here moments ago. That it was not normal to have the breath running as soon as the very idea that Malfoy was perhaps observing him and that the heat taking possession of his belly was more than displaced.
Malfoy was no longer paying attention to him and holding in his hand a book that he read quietly, looking perfectly relaxed.
OoOoO
Blaise’s face appeared in the middle of the green smoke, his beautiful almond eyes immediately landed on Draco and a slight smirk stretched his lips.
Malfoy stepped slowly in front of his face and examined him for a moment before smiling full teeth.
He cleared his throat before trying to speak.
OoOoO
What if all this is not true? What if he goes back to the other world before he can talk to Dumbledore and clear things up?
Malfoy was going into the room for a reason, Harry didn’t know what yet, but he was going to do everything he could to find out...
“I don’t believe you.”
Health or Economics?
The picture of the nightstand came to his mind. What if it were true? If really ten years of his life had been taken from him? Ron and Hermione seemed to believe it, too, and Harry had no reason not to trust them.
They had had sex that night and it had been without sweetness. Malfoy had dropped him on the bed and impaled himself violently on him, hitting his pelvis hard against his own while Harry grabbed his protruding hips and his fingers were sinking into his translucent skin. His fingernail's marks were still there when it all stopped and Harry just loved it.
Malfoy remained silent, still looking at him with this glance so involved, so much pain and sorrow contained in the eyes.
Knowing the maniac, he was convinced that Potter was going to try to escape. When Harry had an idea in his head, there was nothing to dislodge it, nothing to reason with. He was anyway, the least reasonable person Draco ever knew in his life.
“I’ll, uh, forward my report to you once I finish writing it.” he assured, moving the scrolls on his desk to occupy his hands.
"I want all this to end" he said, a pain that is hardly contained in the voice.
"About yesterday’s evening," Malfoy said, a smile on his lips that stretched as he saw Harry wriggling.
Harry remembered studying it in potion class this year -
Malfoy stood straight in front of the doorway and stared at him coldly and impassively. Harry felt his throat closing as he stared at Malfoy who hadn't moved since he opened. He looked like a wax doll that had simply been placed on his doormat while waiting for him to find it.
Draco raised a skeptical eyebrow.
Harry measured his friends for a moment before loosening his grip on Malfoy, pushing him and tipping him forward.
They all met at the Three Broomsticks to celebrate his engagement to Ginny. Harry had proposed a little clumsily, just after a game in which the Harpies had emerged as the winner. He was carried away by the outpouring of victory and found her later to hug her when she ran to him.
He felt Malfoy’s gaze upon him and the closeness made him blushed.
Potter nodded briefly, breathing always quick, seeming in a terrible panic.
Malfoy wasn’t here anymore. Only Noah stood in the middle of the grass, throwing his foot into one of the pillars of the stands, looking angry.
Even worse, he realized that his feelings for Ginny had diminished and that it had already been going on for several months without him noticing. He had to admit how he felt about Malfoy to understand that he no longer felt the same way about his fiancée, and it had been particularly painful to realize.
Draco had mumbled that it would be difficult to continue if Harry did not let him use his arms. But Harry had smiled at his neck, turning him abruptly, biting his lower lip, admitting to him that he had other plans for the evening.
“Seriously?”
“Thank you, mate, that’s very optimistic of you.” Harry jeered, pinching his lips while nodding his chin.
Dean represented very well the atmosphere at their table a few years ago. He had always been very good at capturing those good moments on paper. Dean had a gift for drawing, it was undeniable. Harry was almost jealous of how easily he transcribed emotions.
Harry stayed in that position for a while. The small luminous dots gradually disappeared behind his crooked glasses which he put back straight on his nose.
Inexplicably blocking on this too white skin, whose texture seemed to be so soft to the touch, he blinked his eyes to lift them up on those of his owner who stared at him through the mirror reflecting his fine face and his denatured grey orbs.
And it was so powerful, he was shaking...
A soft blue light sprouted from his hand, the colour of which rapidly darkened and let appear some snowflakes that flew inside, in a small whirlwind.
Neville focused again and cast the spell.
“I’m sorry Ginny, I’m just tired and I didn’t notice that I was so distant...” he explained, clumsily.
Potter then invited him to sit at his desk next to that of the Weasel.
Malfoy...
“She's not here and do you honestly think I’m here to dance?” Harry laughed in a raw tone.
The post-game was as usual. Ginny’s team wore her in ovation, singing their hymn and everyone gathered to drink and eat in the dining hall that had been decorated for the occasion. Hundreds of bewitched plates revolved around the students, letting them use the different dishes that were there. A giant fountain flowed out of a liquid that looked like, it didn’t go wrong, to ButterBeer.
Draco raised a skeptical eyebrow.
“You’ve already seen it! Need I remind you that there was no later than yesterday you found yourself dismally petrified?” Draco jeered, raising an arrogant eyebrow.
"Merlin, how do you explain that your misguided mind had the wonderful idea of snogging ME at the expense of a girl?" he asked, and rightly so.
He spread the cloth and eventually found Malfoy’s belly warm. The skin was soft and velvety, and he still groaned at the irresistible urge to lick it. He raised his hands higher until he touched one of Malfoy’s nipples, who gasped against his mouth. He retraced the ribs under his fingers and went down again until he went around his navel before putting his hand on the edge of his pants.
His legs pounded the ground, the pebbles screeching under his shoes. The building of wellness and health witch appeared before his eyes, in a last effort he ran faster.
“If during your task you are not satisfied with the result, you can always go back and pronounce the
It was Harry who ended their exchanges, he, who decided to stop everything.
"You can't decently throw that kind of bomb in my face and just walk away from me!" Draco said, moving towards him.
“The Burrow” he announced distinctly from his dragging voice.
"Oh, that? Nothing very important, a crazy idea that just crossed my mind," he replied, sweeping the air with a wave of his hand.
More than a month since he had this clandestine relationship in the eyes of all his friends. Harry had been blinded by how he felt about Malfoy and allowed himself to be swept away by his urges and desires, without ever thinking of the consequences of his actions.
Harry Potter, a young student, was walking up the stairs that separated him from the hallways that he would walk for five years.
Potter abruptly opened his eyes and stared at him strangely, burning desire still shining in the back of his green eyes. He took a step forward, seeming to want to resume where they had stopped but Draco interrupted him once again by forcing on his wrists.
Draco could not repress a smirk adorning his lips in front of Harry’s sheepish look, remembering that he had the same when he was accused when he was 17.
Malfoy was everywhere.
He wanted more, he wanted
He had always known that he was particularly resistant to these kinds of spells, since his fourth year to be quite accurate. He had demonstrated this during the lessons of the false Alastor Moody, who had insisted so much on teaching them by subjecting them to the
Ginny swearing and laid his eyes on Harry, to kiss him one last time before getting up with a sigh and putting on his clothes properly.
"And may I know what explanation I have to give you?" he asked, wrinkling his eyes.
Harry had never seen Malfoy look at him like that. He squeezed, and swallowed before scraping his throat, turning away his eyes, feeling much too embarrassed to continue to challenge him.
Harry quickly turned his head and bump into Malfoy. He frowned at his thin grin and wondered how long he had been waiting for him. He opened his mouth to ask him but preferred to answer the question he had just asked.
“I’m not looking weird! I’m just a little bit tired from the classes, it takes a lot of energy, and sometimes I probably have to burn out more than I need to without meaning to” Harry replied.
Almost no longer holding on, and because he was more confident now, he took out his fingers delicately, pushing back Malfoy’s hand and put it on the bed and straightened himself up to stand in front of him.
And Harry saw it...
“And I say it’s past all that, you’d better focus on your studies rather than belabour the fact that Draco Malfoy has changed or not. Besides, I’m going to go, I’m exhausted and I still have a chapter of law to read for tomorrow”, Hermione blew up on his way out.
Harry then entered Malfoy’s dormitory, his wand in his hand, more determined than ever to stop the charade that had been created between them.
His breath was stuck in his lungs and his heart was beating too fast in his ears.
Wherever he is.
Instead, Harry went up the stairs, opened the door of his room just as abruptly and threw himself on his bed, clutching his pillow in his hands, making his knuckles bleach. He smothered a hoarse growl against the pillow on his face as his breathing became more complicated.
Harry gasped while trying to catch his breath and winced when the pain became more present as he came to his senses. He put a hand on his chin and moved his painful jaw from left to right before raising his eyes to determine the origin of the blow.
"I thought I’d never be reduced to this with you again, after all these years..." he noticed, sadly.
Nott stared at him quietly, visibly amused by his behavior, not seeming disconcerted by his remarks.
The more he replayed the scene, the more he wanted to experiment, to go to the end of what his body was screaming at him.
Her dark grey t-shirt highlighted his arms, his bust and marked her waist.
He frantically blinked his eyelids to do the correct focusing behind the damp which was slowly beginning to dissipate in his eyes. Draco then raised his wand in front of the cupboards to take out the plates and cutlery that he had carefully arranged on the table.
"Wow, calm down, Potter, if you so much want to talk to Malfoy, I’m not going to stop you, I care too much about life for that!" Zabini answered, raising his hands before him as a sign of peace.
"You understand why I was so surprised that you didn't know!" Potter exclaimed, with a movement of his hand.
“Right, but confess that it’s not every day that we see you around, Scarhead” Zabini sneered.
He looked happy. At least that’s what he was showing. Soon they would be married respectively, and it did something to him. Like when you found out that one of your old acquaintances was coming back into your life. That was not the case, of course, since they were working in the same place and they had already crossed paths in the Ministry corridors, but he was no longer the same person.
Harry, who had not moved an inch, allowed himself to breathe.
“Just a nightmare...” he mumbled, hoping his excitement would go unnoticed by his friend.
“So… I would been Obliviate?” he asked
Harry, now completely naked, took advantage of the opportunity to quickly get closer to him, making him vaguely startle.
“So, shall we eat this ice cream?” he said, in a smirk.
Harry sneered slightly before turning in his direction, a desperate look glued to the face.
Potter seemed to prefer a Draco who hated him over the man he had become today, in love with the
voluntarily.
“I will not accept any such behaviour in my next classes or I will immediately remove you from the academy, am I clear enough?”
Of his last memories, the Dark Lord was building an army, gathering as many Death Eaters as he could. Terrorizing Muggles and ransacking cities with black magic to show his many powers and power unparalleled over the centuries.
Harry’s spirit was extinguished at that moment, letting a deep hatred take hold of him, seeing Malfoy respond to the kiss, moving his lips against those of the young man, holding him tighter against him.
Harry followed him with his eyes until he saw him disappear and lowered his head again on the scroll, he had just given him.
“Yeah... You’re probably right...” Harry blew, staring at Malfoy.
"Malfoy…" Potter adds, in a dragging voice.
Harry had nevertheless come to plead for his cause, recounting the fact that he had no doubt that Draco had no choice but to rally with the Dark Lord. Draco was surprised to learn that Potter knew that his life and that of his parents would cost him if he did not fulfill his mission.
This evening was welcome, Harry needed to clear his head after the last exchange with Malfoy.
“What- Who are you talking about?”
“I don’t belong to you, Potter” he said, in his dragging voice.
Harry nodded and Malfoy grabbed his arm to bring him back.
He knew that the
So he had let the day go by, waiting for the evening, hoping inwardly that Ron would want to cancel everything. But when Harry told back to him, Ron had become very excited, as if his tiredness due to yesterday’s party had left his body at the simple thought that in the evening they would come out.
Draco blinked, staring at him like he was in front of a madman.
We could always count on that asshole Malfoy to interfere with what was none of his business. While his hatred had finally moved on to another, it seemed inevitably determined to return to Malfoy whatever Harry did to divert it. The insulting relent once again passed the barriers of his lips to spit out the venom he could no longer repress.
“So what?” Harry mumbled, annoyed, standing up a bit on his headboard.
Harry remained alone for more than an hour before the infirmary door opened again on Ginny.
Harry looked in front of him, pressing the call button without giving him a single fucking gaze.
Harry tightened his legs a little more, lest the bulge of his trousers became visible.
Was it real? Did it really happen, or did he just imagine it? Or did he just dream it?
“Potter, need I remind you that we all have obligations? Have you forgotten that you’re supposed to be getting married next month and that I’m going to be married in a few months too?”
“I have vaguely been able to see it, yeah…” he mumbled, as he crossed his arms on his chest, the discomfort again present in his voice.
"Wait ... You're kidding me, aren't you?" he asked, in a slight grin.
“Is it your habit to keep people you invite waiting for a drink or were you stupid enough to get lost, Potter?”
“Did you doubt that? Who else could I have asked, if not my best friend? ” Ron smiled, pressing Harry’s shoulder a little more in his hand.
“We think they’re in France, apparently they spotted us and ended up running away” Ron scolded, snapping his tongue on the top of his mouth, visibly annoyed by the turn of things.
Ron stared at him for a moment before disappearing behind his magazine again.
He always knew how to fight back against Malfoy, whatever he said. If he did not win every time, he was well enough to rebuke him with a replica that would make him squint his beautiful grey eyes and distort his thin lips into a scornful grin. Today, however, he could not even separate his teeth, which he squeezed under the pain that spread along his chest and partially blocked the air in his lungs.
In a resigned sigh, he pushed back the blankets and headed for the small crystal bottle on one of the shelves of the room. Fixing the scrolls of smoke dancing inside, he opened the bottle and turned his head in the direction of the door which materialized at that moment.
"I really don't see what's funny" Draco jeered, offended.
A few strands of his hair fell before his eyes and Harry raised his hand to remove them, leaving him all the leisure to admire the grey pearls with silvery reflections.
Malfoy had not stopped baiting him and showing him that he still wanted him. Harry had finally succumbed.
He had missed this asshole, it was true... he would have wanted him not to listen to him, he would have wanted to continue to exist for him...
"I’ll shut your fucking mouth, you fucking bastard!" Harry erupted, clenching his teeth.
He was about to speak when Potter pulled him forward, snatching a gasp of surprise, while his bust met his own.
A warm breath fell on his face and he was convinced that he was dreaming.
Harry had made various and varied apologies in their seventh year and had continued long after that. He had confessed to him that it was impossible for him to forget the sight of Draco bathed in blood on the white tile, his shirt gradually dyed with hemoglobin, while he watched him die, unable to make the slightest move.
Draco rubbed his mouth vigorously before raising his head looking for any branch of mistletoe, probably responsible for this new fucking kiss.
He was a tall young man, with short brown hair framing a slim and fine face with soft features, although very masculine.
His breathing was erratic, his hair sticking to his forehead. He was sweating, cold and Malfoy was standing there, on the floor, looking at him painfully.
He was about to open a new file which he had to deal with in addition to all those who littered on his desk in a messy pile where a few parchments ran between each.
, now”
Draco has clenched his teeth to repress another crisis of tears and gripped his glass firmly between his fingers before carrying it back to his mouth to finish the contents.
“Your witness? I’m your witness?” he asked, a little smile that hardly hided his joy.
A small grin adorned Malfoy’s lips.
He found Malfoy handsome while sucking his dick with his mouth. Malfoy was handsome, and it was the first time he see that. Seeing him take care of him made him beautiful and he was coming soon, he knew it.
“It’s not as if the question is on your mind every time you come…” Malfoy sighed, casting himself a cleaning spell before getting dressed.
Harry swallowed before turning completely to his chimney, feeling suddenly embarrassed.
Why had he not become Auror as he had always claimed to want to become one?
“I don’t understand.”
They had come to encourage her, as well as good numbers of students of the university, Quidditch gathering, as always, the different factions.
He didn’t want to go back to his dorm, Ron had probably gone to sleep at Hermione’s like almost every night. He didn’t want to be alone in his bed with Malfoy’s visions, his voice in his ear telling him to let himself be done...
So he gave in to a half-sleep he couldn’t control.
“I’m hurting you?” He asked, in a breath, frowning.
Harry sighed. He expected Ginny to do this to him as soon as he saw her. She had waited for him after his last class of the day and had intimately asked him to follow her to her dormitory to talk to him. He would have done the same if he had been in his place.
Ron nodded, patting him on the shoulder with his hand.
Malfoy raised his eyebrow a little more before sneering.
bed...
Malfoy took the time to unbuckle his belt and then opened the zipper before rising to remove his trousers and his underpants. He then moved closer to the bed and sat delicately on it.
Harry looked down on Malfoy, always laughing. He lowered his fist and finally got up.
“That sounds strangely like what I could tell you while you’re fucking me.” he scoffed, while the book still did not move an inch.
Visibly abandoning his fear of the desire he had felt against him a few moments earlier, he set out towards the bedroom, slamming the door in a thud behind his back.
He pinched his lips, wrinkling his eyes like he was trying to get through the epidermis to make sure there was nothing to hide.
“Malfoy, what year?” Harry added, pointing his wand back to him.
“For what?” he asked, raising an eyebrow.
Harry suspended his hand and raised his head at him, frowning.
A bitter little laugh escaped from his throat, in a sound strangled by the tears it contained as much as it could.
He looked into Malfoy’s metallic eyes, always focused on the coffee machine, and felt his heart racing for no reason. For him, Malfoy had always had bland eyes and no expression. He had to admit that he had made a big mistake when he stared at the bright reflections reflected in it and marked the different shades of grey that he had never noticed before. He lost himself in the gentle look of multiple hues while his lips slowly spread.
"What is bothering me is that I see that you have used me," he replied between his teeth.
"More seriously, I can't stand this mistletoe bullshit! Even Ron is ready to play! I was sure with you at least I wouldn't have a problem with it" he explained, sighing.
Seeing Malfoy in these conditions after trying to put words into what he was feeling only reinforced his feeling of discomfort. Greatly blurring the emotions that overwhelmed him as soon as he was by his side.
Malfoy wrinkled his eyes. He lowered his hand, which still held a few strands of his black hair between his fingers, and pinned it on his neck to draw him sharply towards him.
His heart accelerated in his chest at the thought that Malfoy was beneficial to him during his training, since he had agreed to go further with him. To think, fucking with Malfoy made him more adept at magic and amplified his ability to master his power.
They turned to face Hermione, arms crossed over his chest with a straight face.
The stag disappeared in a volute of smoke, leaving a thick mist hovering in the room behind it.
Harry gave him a black gaze before biting his cauldron cake again.
Then George and Bill had followed them, the twin had pulled the brooms out of the storeroom asking them if they were brave enough to fly in this weather. And Ron immediately accepted, grabbing the brooms of his hands and handing one over to Harry.
“Harry... I think you can let go of Draco, he did nothing wrong...” Hermione said.
Saint Potter, the most deserving and powerful Auror of his class, in the flesh.
Harry followed the various birds flying from tree to tree to feed their young before slowly straightened up. He looked at the various tables invested by several students, seeking to occupy his mind as he could.
Was he really ready for this?
Harry had never wanted to go any further and he had obviously forgotten his rival in the equation.
"I mean that I respect human feelings and that being attracted to men rather than women makes absolutely no difference to the functioning of our society," he concludes, with his arms crossed.
“So what do you think?” Hermione asked, after a few seconds.
Harry couldn’t help but think that on this point they were alike. He was also the centre of his group of friends, although he had always been uncomfortable occupying that position which he clearly didn’t think he deserved.
“So, I’m listening to you, what explanation you want from me?” he asked.
What if he just doesn’t come home?
Malfoy raised a skeptical eyebrow.
Harry tensed up, suddenly.
“You’re out of your mind, you know that?”
Harry walked to the building where Malfoy was studying, refusing to enter. Malfoy couldn’t have been far, he was still early and Harry didn’t think he was already in bed.
Then she went to the door and opened it, Ron was already gone. She turned her head slightly, a little smile on her lips.
«Let me guide you... » Malfoy replied, taking hold of his lips again.
"We’ll see, I have other things to do than deal with Malfoy and you too if you want my opinion" Harry replied, in a weary tone.
Dumbledore’s smile widened slightly as he still looked at Harry’s eyes with this heavy and overwhelming intensity.
"Yes, and without insulting me," Hermione added with a smile.
“Yeah, let it slide again, he’s
Much of the library’s books had been spread on the floor. He figured it out that they had been violently thrown under anger.
Harry shook his head, straightening up, closing his eyes again to refocus.
Harry stood still for a few seconds, then sighed, closing his eyes before opening the door and going through it.
Draco could feel Harry’s jerky breath rippling off his cheek. He had difficulty swallowing while his muscles tightened under his touch. Potter’s eyes were always tightly closed, as if he did not accept his gesture enough to confront it.
He did not have a clear idea of what might cause a student in his own home or one of the other three to be pushed him out.
He forced his eyebrows as high as he could, slowly loosening the mucous membranes to glimpse a net of light seeping between his eyelashes. With his eyelids half closed, he did not distinguish much but it was enough to see some silhouettes standing in front of him.
Malfoy tightened himself around his cock and he could not help moaning, resisting the urge to sink completely. Malfoy groaned with pain when he pushed again, making him stop in the middle.
The crockery parts became totally motionless and silent, as Harry turned his palms toward the sky and stared at them in a panicked look. He remained frozen for a few moments to contemplate them. His lips and fingertips were covered with slight tremors, before he finally turned his hands over and slowly laid them flat on the table.
After the war, he had decided, like almost all students of his age, to redo their last year at Hogwarts to validate their N.E.W.T.S.
Malfoy, still focused on Zabini, seemed to tense for a moment before slowly turning his head and scowled at him. Harry almost took his breath away. The pale, almost bland grey of his eyes seemed to have darkened as he stared at him and a dangerous glimmer of light was floating in his irises.
“Fuck you, Malfoy! I already explained to you that I don’t know what took me, it’s just done! We won’t talk about it again, so print it in your perilous mind, is that clear?"
Harry watched him suck one of his fingers to cover him with saliva and quickly turned his eyes to the ceiling when Malfoy pointed his finger at his orifice.
A slight smile was born on his lips as he remembered the past moments of the day before.
“Oh! Yeah… it must not help” Ron sneered, in front of the discomfort of his best friend.
Harry could almost feel his fucking smile when this one sneered, sending a new breath, caressing the skin of his neck that made him shiver.
He rushed to the door and opened it before letting go of the handle and opening wide his eyes.
A malicious smile stretched Malfoy’s lips without ceasing to look at his target.
His breath pounded against his chest, while the image of Malfoy playing his tongue with Noah was painted before his eyes, diffused by his sick mind. The light in his hand lost its color to be almost transparent, seeming to blink at times, like a light bulb about to give up the ghost.
“This filthy press definitely doesn’t know how to do it discreetly.”
"You panicked?! Did YOU panic? Nobody kisses people when just panic, Potter!" he hissed, rubbing his lips again with his fingertips.
He could not hold a sigh of relief from this crucial information sent directly to him by his heart. Everything would surely come back to normal as he had hoped, even though he was not sure that she felt the same way about him. Knowing that what he was feeling was still present was a small victory that brought him back to the reality he knew.
The whistling of the kettle becoming more strident, Draco closed his eyes, remembering the sensation of Harry’s wet mouth running through his body, his tongue tracing his muscles, going down dangerously to his belly, biting his belly button.
His heart was pounding so hard, he thought for a moment that he was out of his body. He had never felt that way when he masturbated and yet he had done it often. But he never touched himself thinking about Malfoy on purpose.
And even though he wasn’t quite sure what caused Harry to throw himself at him in that way, he couldn’t bring himself to let go of him so they could talk about it. Because that’s what they had to do, he was undoubtedly aware of it, but for now he still wanted to feel Potter’s hot breath against his skin, to shudder under the shy caresses of Harry’s fingers that tickled the small hair on his neck.
They were already hard and wet from their recently exchanged lovemaking.
“I have never been one, Potter, but no one could blame you for having thought of it…” he said before putting on the top of his pajamas to hide the object of the discomfort that weighed between them.
Blaise raised an eyebrow, in a perfect imitation of Draco and gave him back his smile, his brown eyes in almond shining malice.
“Fuck you, Zabini! My neurons and I work perfectly, and if I were you, I’d get my ass out of here before I use my practice class against you,” Harry threatened, his wand in his hand.
It suddenly emerges from the Pensieve in a great inspiration, before moving away from it by backing, a hand stuck on the mouth.
But Harry didn’t give him time to ask what he was going to do.
“It’s not ironic, I didn’t know the effects of that spell. It was an unfortunate accident.” He breathed in a harsh voice, planting his green eyes in Malfoy’s diabolically grey eyes.
He waved to Fawkes with a nod of the head before taking a brief look at the Pensieve behind the door, and then walked to the wide desk with the feet shaped like a bird’s claws where Dumbledore was standing.
“For fuck’s sake, Malfoy doesn’t make me drag you here!” Harry exploded, his patience disappeared immediately after his last remark.
When he woke up the next morning, the first reflex he had was to grab his glasses and put them on his nose and look at the door. It lasted only a few seconds but enough to make him want to hit himself for being such a git.
“Well, Mr Potter, you can go home. As agreed, we will be expecting you tomorrow for your appointment with your wizard therapist. Maybe he’ll be able to fix some damage…”
"Yes, I'm gay, Malfoy, and I'm very surprised that you don't know when all Hogwarts already aware about this" he replied, defying him with his eyes.
Harry simply raised his eyebrows before blowing his nose.
Harry examined it, turning it in his palm to read the fine and beautiful writing on the label.
Like all good self-respecting Malfoy, he didn’t let on. Like any good member of his family, he put his cold, impassive mask on his face to better hide the upsetting emotions that were impeding his heart and mind.
Draco had a amused little laugh, remembering the nickname he had specially invented to piss off Harry in their childhood. And oh, how it worked…
"Malfoy, do you realize how stupid your question is," he sneered, wiping a tear at the corner of his eye.
“Well, you see, I may be wrong, although this happens only very rarely, but I hypothesize that you found yourself in one of them, or especially that you created it yourself.”
Harry watched one of the drops fall, crashing in a round circle on the back of his hand before figure it out where they came from. He raised his hand intact and passed it under his nose, collecting the dark liquid from which he seemed to soak, thus awakening his mellow spirit.
He unbuttoned the bottle and swallowed a sip of a bitter orange liquid that engulfed the entire trachea, like a protective shield sticking against its walls.
Harry nodded, taking another sip of the beverage.
"Answer, bloody hell!" Harry hissed, wickedly.
Draco frowned desperately seeking in his memories the question that burned his lips a few seconds earlier.
He released his arm, painful efforts undertaken. Harry breathed for a long time, his breath being lost on the candlestick to create a little mist. He had partially succeeded. The ice was still too thin, but the candlestick was completely frozen.
OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoO
He clearly had in mind the fact that Malfoy was shagging him and that he especially seemed to appreciate it. The condition of his underwear and sheets proved to him that this was indeed the case.
Glancing quickly at Malfoy, he reached out to the small bottle and meticulously uncorked it before sniffing its contents.
“Do you want to keep ripping your skin off or will you tell me what’s going on with you? Your nervousness is so palpable that I can barely finish my work.” Malfoy said with his dragging voice that made him shiver when it still rang in his ears a few seconds later.
Harry felt left amidst the hospital linens and the pleasant silence that surrounded him. It did not take more than a few minutes for him to abandon himself to sleep and definitively close his eyes.
"Malfoy?" he called, unsure of himself.
The good mood seemed to invigorate him, thus dispelling all his resentments that he had been dragging since the night before because of bloody Malfoy.
"Yes, I admit that I was out of my mind that night, but admit that you pissed me off too!"
Opening the drawers of the dresser, he took at random the clothes that appeared in front of his eyes, opting for a black sweater and dark blue jeans.
Malfoy took off their pants and sat over him, blocking his hips with his legs before bending over to kiss him passionately. He then stopped kissing to stand up and Harry became aware of what he was seeing.
But then if she did, she would have told Ginny everything and clearly murdered him for betraying the young woman and lying to everyone.
What did he still want? Had he not humiliated himself enough by coming to him to confess what he had done?
“Glad we agree”
He fills more than a dozen before finally scraping the bottom with his ladle.
Frightened, he tried to rise up to get as far away from Malfoy as possible, looking for his wand which he had dropped while he was throwing up and pointed it back at him, trembling.
Harry frowned, turning his face towards his friend.
“It seems to me that it was you who first stared at me.”
«Wow, great job Harry! You did it! It was amazing! » Neville claimed.
Harry shrugged his shoulders, unable to argue more.
When they Apparated to the hospital, Potter wouldn’t let him go right away. His arm was firmly wrapped around his waist during the ride. Draco could feel Harry’s chest rising with difficulty, his breathing becoming heavier, while the frenzied beats of his heart were echoed against his bust. He himself could not control his own to feel Harry so close, his woody scent filling his nostrils.
The frightened look when he approached him to press his lips against his own.
Nott raised a skeptical eyebrow.
"What if I want to?" Malfoy asked, raising an eyebrow.
Malfoy did not answer, content to turn his head towards the clock before again placing his eyes on him.
Draco stood upright, waiting for Potter to finish dressing up, his face firmly lowered on his feet, visibly resigned to the fate that awaited him.
He and Ron had carelessly settled down on an outside table despite the cold of the incipient winter, the fresh air of the wind had cooled their much-used brains in recent hours.
He went through the various tables in front of him before falling on Harry and his friends' tables and blocking them. Malfoy stared at Harry for a few seconds when Harry could feel his stomach contract every time, he met those piercing grey eyes.
“Forget it, I don’t want to fight with you again”
“You got a problem?” He spit at Zabini, as he came closer to the table.
Draco watched him go, strangely soothed, though definitely too tight in his pants.
"Err... Yeah... strange, indeed..." he answered, clearing his throat, embarrassed.
The chubby woman behind the switchboard then pointed him to a desk door, inviting him to settle there to wait for his wizard therapist who should not be long.
“What, Malfoy? Why are you talking about him?” he sighed, correcting his blow.
Ron took a quick look at him before resuming reading his magazine.
Draco detached his hands tightly closed on the earthenware. He groaned under the pain of having squeezed too hard and frantically beat fingers to release them. He then turned the cold water tap and passed his hands under the jet to collect the flow, lowering his palms on his face to cool off.
Harry had always been able to shatter the impassive mask that he constantly tried to tackle on his face. Erasing the effort and the hours spent practicing alone in front of his mirror to get at a result that he considered almost perfect.
... After all, you’re only here to get emptied, aren’t you?” Malfoy jeered, losing his smile.
Abandoning his reflection, he turned his heels to head for the shower, opening the hot water tap before beginning to undress.
glance.
He also found it wisely placed on his nightstand and pointed it in front of Malfoy, rising quickly.
Once inside, Malfoy crossed his arms on his bust and waited.
“I bought them with Ron on the last Hogsmeade trip.”
Harry could feel the panic returning to his brain, sweating through all the pores of his skin.
He heard Ron finish changing his clothes before he pulled on his blanket to get into it in turn.
The sensations were not the same but they were pleasant and the more Ginny touched him, the more his desire grew. There was always Malfoy with him, in a corner of his head and maybe that played too. Maybe that, too, contributed to his screams when Ginny touched him.
“Stop saying shit like that.” Harry hissed, between his teeth.
Malfoy glanced at him sideways, staring at him for a moment before shifting to his reading.
Harry sneered again, before rolling his eyes.
“Right?! Who on this bloody planet has ever ordered “blueberry red” tablecloths, I ask you!”
“You can say that, yes, let’s say we’re old acquaintances,” he explained, grabbing a leaf at the top of the pile of scrolls to place it in front of him.
Harry passed a hand through his dark hair, ruffling them a little more, visibly embarrassed by what he was about to ask.
Harry pinned his arm against his belly, thus hiding the scratch before answering him.
“Because it is. I know you, Harry, you are the first to go to the front without worrying about your safety, but things have changed.
"Oh Really? And how do you intend to do it, please? Because other than hitting me, I don’t really s-" Malfoy mocked, before being abruptly interrupted.
They each had their own circle of friends now, but they didn’t ignore each other. Harry noticed the enormous progress his friend had made since the dissolution of Dumbledore’s army in their fifth year. He had continued to encourage him, and it worked. He was delighted that Neville chose the same path as him.
“Yeah…” he blew, as he continued to walk to his office, the heartbeat of his heart resounding harshly in his ears.
The winter was already well under way and their warm breath was becoming foggy as they moved through the frozen-looking grass, crackling in places beneath their steps.
Draco turned his eyes on Potter’s hand and clenched his teeth, suppressing the urge to rip it off.
“Yes, Sir.”
" Malfoy. You’re also involved, for your information and it seems to me that you particularly appreciate “
Malfoy turned his face in his direction, raising a sceptical eyebrow.
All three sat down, Ron and Hermione on the sofa, Malfoy in an armchair next to the fireplace.
Harry squeezed the sheets a little more between his fingers to the bitter memory that this unfortunate slip left him and closed his eyes in the hope of annihilating him for good.
With rage, he kicked the blankets, uncovering his torso and the top of his thighs, the sheets slipping from the fingers that held them against him.
A deep hatred took hold of Harry, turning on his misty mind a few seconds before.
Malfoy was obviously looking for something in particular but Harry had no idea what it could be...
Tomorrow everything would resume as before, he hoped to have quenched his thirst for Malfoy for good. It wouldn’t happen again. It had to...
“Unfortunately, without supporting evidence, we can only assume this possibility but aside from the fact that the potion is extremely complicated to make, it is indeed likely that a student managed to get one and get it into the castle.”
He had to calm down.
Malfoy squinted his grey eyes and glared at him behind his blond, almost white eyelashes.
“Okay, bad idea… I won’t talk about it anymore, but look out for her, okay? Because if you ever hurt her, you’ll have to deal with me, best friend or not!” Ron retorted, pointing his finger at him.
However, everyone seemed very happy to be together and he too was delighted to share this moment with his family.
“I’m talking about the fact that you hardly touch me anymore, or that you are barely present in moments of intimacy, that’s what I’m talking about!” Ginny taunted, pissed.
OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoO
He never thought he would one day become an Auror beside Potter. Longbottom made a small gesture of his hand.
"Don’t messing with me, Harry, you know exactly what I mean" she hissed.
Harry sighed as he leaned forward to rest his arms on his thighs and join his hands together. He bent his head forward to fix the floor and touched the cuticles of his thumbs until he pulled out small pieces of skin.
Ron nodded his head, a slight smile on his lips.
"I’m tired of being a stress reliever to the
Malfoy uttered an exclamation of surprise before scowled at him.
"I figured that if I came next to you, no one would dare come near me." He said, smirking.
Harry didn’t answer. He opened the door wide and once on the landing, slammed it behind him, sighing.
Harry, still motionless, didn’t move. Then, after a few seconds, consented to blink his eyelids in a calculated slowness.
What happened to him? Did he really make it all up?
Harry felt himself pale at the evocation of one of the many nights when he had opened Marauder’s map in order to spy on Malfoy’s actions. This time he had cost him much more than he had wanted, but knowing that Dumbledore was aware of his way of dealing with Malfoy made him tense on his chair.
Harry raised his eyebrows, caught unawares.
“Draco, Harry, step aside as you can” she added, grabbing a handful of powder that Ron was handing her in a small bag.
Draco measured his hand for a moment before placing his gaze in that of the survivor and answering him.
He was fiddling with his brain trying to find himself in the midst of this too full of emotions.
Did he hear right? Did Malfoy promise him that they would do it
that you’ll have trouble getting up tomorrow.” he affirmed, when he reached his height, his bust meeting almost his own as he stared at his eyes intensely.
of him…
With his eyelids tightly closed, he took a moment to calm down and breathe softly, his hands resting on his knees bent against his chest. His fingers tightened on his trousers while his body trembled slightly as he tried in vain not to cry.
“Potter…And Weasel as a bonus!” he exclaimed, pulling his cigarette again.
Harry remained frozen for a moment, looking at the door, overlooking the landing where the second staircase that ascended to the second floor would lead him to his room.
“I honestly doubt it will be, unless I’m a total masochist, no one can stand having you as a student, you’re too exasperating!”
“Obviously, since I’m here studying to become one” he affirmed, without detaching his eyes from his book.
The murmurs became more distinct voices, ranging from the deep to the most acute, indicating to him that both men and women were at his side.
"Oh, yeah? Well that’s not what came out of it, you’ll excuse me for being afraid for my ass and everyone else’s at the expense of your fucking face.”
Four years he had not seen Potter again and he didn’t know what attitude to adopt when he would meet face to face with the Magic World’s savior.
Harry turned his head towards Malfoy, who was staring at him, with a slight smile on the corner of his lips. He felt blush by this more than explicit glance. Harry knew very well why Malfoy looked at him in this way.
“I’m not a Death Eater, Potter, and regarding your memory loss, Ron and the Aurors are going to do everything they can to get you out of there, so
“Ron…” Harry blew, closing his eyes to contain his anger.
Harry realized he wouldn’t win this time. He was far too disheartened to fight the frigid words that Malfoy had formulated with the obvious aim of lowering him to the ground.
“Potter…” he threatened, turning his face toward his captive fingers.
Neville nodded silently and then took another sip of his Butterbeer while Seamus frowned at Malfoy and his friends.
Theo had not bothered to stand up to welcome him, nor had he even looked up his eyes as the files on which he was leaning.
Harry recognized the Janus Thickey Ward where many witches had been suffering from incurable spells for several years.
Harry lost ground. He was trapped, he knew it. An immeasurable desire devoured his bowels and came down to his crotch. He had to hold on to the wall, so as not to fall from the violence of the emotions that were going through him at that moment.
“Where are you going? What are you going to do? ” Harry asked, reaching forward to threaten him.
Harry instantly froze in front of the proximity, which had yet nothing special compared to everything else they had shared in the evening. He noticed that he did not feel Malfoy’s body behind his back, since he was obviously not attached to him. Only his arm was in direct contact with his skin and diffused a gentle warmth there.
Ron shrugged his shoulders, then glanced him sideways before focusing on his task again.
Despite everything, Harry stuck to his guns, determined to prove that Draco Malfoy had become a death eater and that he clearly had a mission for Voldemort.
“This is what most wizard’s think.” assured Malfoy, turning a new page of his book.
How could he tell them what he had seen? Dreamed? Lived?
Harry raised his hands to put them around Malfoy’s face, one on each cheek, pressing his lips one last time on his own, before slowly moving apart, opening his eyes. Only a few inches away, his nose touching his own, he anchored his gaze in the perplexed one of Malfoy, who had difficulty catching his breath.
“So let me show you how serious I am” he said, before moving away.
He did come home and that was enough for him.
Blaise frowned.
“You won’t achieve anything if you don’t let go of your wand,” he said.
A small moan answered him before Harry ended up turning and frantically beating eyelids. Always leaning on him, Draco saw him very clearly open his eyes in the dark, meeting his own before growing in amazement when he finally seemed to see him.
“But… it’s impossible… I can’t want what happened! There must be a mistake!” Harry retorted in a breath, an insurmountable fear taking him to the guts as he stared at the Cauldron Cakes.
“That’s because you weren’t fully focused on your task!” Hermione hissed, looking furious.
"Shut up, George!" Ron scolded.
Ron shook his head as his grin had not left his lips and seemed to enlarge further.
"When you're done laughing like a moron, maybe you can share what's so twisting?" Draco sighed crossing his arms over his chest.
“Okay, I’m taking you to St Mungo’s” he had replied, supporting him more to encourage him to move forward.
Harry glanced at her briefly before turning to Hermione, who seemed troubled to have been so sharply interrupted in the middle of his question, for information that should not have been in the discussion.
“Please, no need to thank me for pointing out that the
Harry stood in front of him with an empty gaze.
“Malfoy!” he cried to him who was already running down the stairs, probably to get to the dungeons.
She gave him one last smile before heading towards the exit and Harry could only hear the door closing behind her as his eyes closed.
Harry had dreamt again of Malfoy who took him with lust, while he moaned under his assaults and his hips were tumbling against his pelvis.
And it put Harry out of his mind... Knowing that asshole had leverage on him and that he was playing enough to piss him off, forcing him to contain what he was feeling.
They looked like they were having fun, but more than dubious vapors were flying around them, suggesting that this cloud of pink smoke was the cause of their laughing.
After all, they had shared seven years of common life when they were in Hogwarts. Every morning, they got up and every night, they fell asleep in the same dormitory. They had also occupied the same common room, attending school classes together, although their schedules differed depending on the specialties they had both chosen.
Harry rolled his eyes at Malfoy’s lack of subtlety. He was fully aware of his scheme, but it didn’t work. As soon as Malfoy was in trouble, he persisted in masking his discomfort and his disappointment at not being able to master this nonverbal spell by doing everything he was capable of to try to destabilize Harry.
Draco sighed with exasperation before releasing the handle and brutally pushing back the door that went against the wall in a thud.
“Far be it from me to make you wait longer, it’s not every day that I have the visit of two of my former comrades, the most famous of all Hogwarts! In our time, at least” he had hissed, interleaving his fingers.
Malfoy drank up his glass and turned his head towards Harry, always this nebulous look stuck to his face.
Harry wrapped his hand again on Malfoy’s wet sex before Malfoy did the same on his and they went back and forth again, lascivious at the beginning, then stronger and longer. Their breath quickly became erratic and both knew they would come soon.
He spent most of his time worrying about Harry’s reactions. Apprehending what he might be thinking at the moment.
"You definitely don't do anything like the others, it's a real problem with you, you know?" he heard him answer, without really wanting to.
Harry gauged him for a moment without answering and finally put his wand in the pocket of his jeans before anchoring his green eyes in Malfoy’s grey ones.
"Relax Potter, I’m not going to jump on you, I have better things to do than to suffer the company of a depressed sod" the ex-Slytherin replied, warms up.
Harry was still in shock from his vision of Malfoy in the middle of an endorphin demonstration with a man. He was even more confused when he realized it had turned him on a little. Probably because he had an idea earlier to bring Ginny back to his room tonight, hoping to do the same to her.
He ended his day as he started it. Lying in bed, his mind is even more cluttered than in the morning.
Harry frowned. He fucking screwed up... If Ginny’s eyes threw lightning, the moisture he saw shining there was in no way due to anger.
He tried to follow him, but the little effort he made was exhausting and he had to give up in the middle of the second staircase to catch his breath.
"Harry, did you say you were in your bed in Hogwarts when you fell asleep? Did you?" Hermione asked, looking focused.
A neuron exploded in Harry’s brain and in an excess of anger, he grabbed Malfoy by the neck of his shirt. He lifted him up towards him and gave him a deeply evil glance.
He explored the dark walls where a few torches scattered a bluish light that hardly reflected on the cold stone surrounding the room. The offices were of a wood as black as the rest of the furniture, as if the colour was banned in this section.
“You make me sorry…”
“For my part, I don’t know him at all and I don’t care at all that he is part of a line of pure bloods, as long as I've seen him, I don’t like him at all, his behavior disgusts me to death” Harry hissed, staring at him.
He had saw himself puzzled in his memory but nothing that put him in the state he was in right now.
“You piece of sh-”
But the failure had been gruelling on his last night traded with her. Since New Year’s Eve, he had not renewed the experience, lest his desire for Ginny be marred by the one he felt for Malfoy.
Harry frowned.
Every time he closed his eyes, Malfoy’s face materialized. Every time he passed by his side, he could not help but breathe the smell that he had finally identified. Every time he spoke to him, he anchored his eyes in an ocean of pearly grey, the depth of which instantly caught him, gripping his heart and accelerating his breathing.
«Fuck, Malfoy answers! And since when do you call me by my first name?! » Harry shouted, walking a little more, his wand in front of him.
That’s why, that night again, Harry was lying in bed, browsing the Marauder’s map widely unfolded, looking for Draco Malfoy who had not stopped obstructing his thoughts since the beginning of the year.
Draco fixed for a moment the frame, the powerful memories in his mind, the moments shared with Harry permeating and overwhelming his heart to know that he was now the only one to remember it…
His mind was still foggy when Malfoy detached himself from him and took his wand to clean them.
“I don’t doubt it, but trust Hermione’s judgment, because she contacted him.” Draco added, placing his glass on the coffee table before settling comfortably in the back of his chair.
Harry stretched his wand a little more in protest, forbidding him to go further.
Other students had the same idea and walked between the alleys of the campus, talking about things and other things, or had breakfast on the adjacent tables.
"But you seem to like it..." Malfoy whispered.
Ron paused, then sighed before resuming.
“Ron! Do you realize what you’re saying? If you go that way, then you’re no better than him,” Hermione said, hitting his shoulder.
Yet Harry was happier every day when they crossed, and it scared him as much as it made his days brighter. He had trouble forgetting the comfort he had felt while they were at the bar. This warm and pleasant feeling that had gone through him and made him feel like home.
Harry nodded.
“I don’t know, Harry, but this person definitely knew what she was doing by integrating it into yours.” Dumbledore sighed, resting his hand on his desk.
He felt Harry tense under his fingers, but despite the fact that he seemed strained by their pressure, he did not move, leaving his hand firmly on the table.
He then unbuttoned his pants, under the gaze of Malfoy who loosened his arms around him, hypnotized by Harry’s moves.
Harry’s smile turned into a wince as he snapped his tongue on the roof of his mouth.
Blaise shrugged his shoulders.
Harry Potter stood up with a smile on his lips and he reached out his hand.
“Hermione told me that it was rather ingenious despite the message that was written there and that the spell to create them was particularly difficult to achieve.”
“You had a preview to promote it last month.” He pointed out, looking sideways at him.
From the corner of his eye, he saw Malfoy come closer to grasp his arm with delicacy and pull it up to him.
“Potter… it’s cold and I’m getting hungry, so let’s go home,” Malfoy said in his dragging voice.
They dressed in haste and kissed one last time wishing each other a good day before going to class each on their own.
"Merlin Potter, I have no idea what you're talking about," he replied in a slurred tone.
If Harry dared, he would confess that Malfoy was very attractive and would slap himself afterwards, to have thought such a thing.
But before he could repair his impulse of feelings, Potter’s voice resounded in the room, making him tenser to make him close his eyes expecting the scathing reply he knew.
Harry, who felt exhaustion catching up with him, could only blink to try to keep himself awake, unable to make the slightest movement to prevent him from leaving. He dropped himself heavily on the bed, dropping the sheets he had barely held on, and fixed the white ceiling with an absent air.
The opposing team scored another goal reducing the gap to four out of five for Ginny’s team. It was very tight and it proved the top level of the various players.
He no longer saw Ginny as a result of her repeated flight training, making her even more tiring and thus preventing late-night meetings between her and Harry. So Harry was entitled to only a few kisses here and there, as soon as Ginny had time to give him, and even if it was little, he was content.
As Harry walked out of Weasley Wizard Wheezes, he began thinking of Blaise Zabini and his connection with another Slytherin.
Him and Harry would spend hours uncovering artifacts, logging them and researching them. It had been such a relaxing time in his life, that he hadn’t even realized the evolution of their friendship until he was in so deep that he didn’t know how he was ever going to climb his way out. He had honestly stopped trying despite himself. But there was so much pressure from Lucius to stop playing in dirt and get back to England do what was expected of him. To marry a pureblooded witch and produce the next generation of Malfoys.
“I do but, I have decided that Papa is tired and would like to take you to visit with Grand-mere and Aunt Dromeda and your cousin Teddy, while Papa has a little time to finish up some work. Now hold on tightly, I don’t want to lose you.”
Harry just listened to this conversation, summoning bowls to serve soup and bread. Pondering on what it all meant. Was he ready to face Draco? He knew he had been a coward over the years. Avoiding coming back to England. Making sure not to encounter the other man. Draco had made it easy at the beginning staying in Wiltshire or at his other residence, because of Scorpius’ young age. But that had changed. He knew the two women were right, but he was scared. He was scared of what would happen. What might happen.
“We’re not convinced,” said the twins at the same time.
“Thank you Twinkle, you know I wouldn’t let mother blame you.”
“That would be lovely Scorpius, but why don’t you go inside with Teddy and find Ted so you can wash your hands. I am sure you are hungry after playing all morning. I brought sandwiches, for you two.”
“I know, but sometimes it is really hard for me to not be bitter about them and what they forced our family into.”
Sending the patronus off, and turned to the fireplace and lit the fire and pulled down his wards, reconnecting his floo to the network. After a moment the fire flared green and the form of Draco Malfoy’s head came through.
And Draco walked away, no more emotionally grounded than he had before he had started on his walk. Disapparating away, and arriving back in his office, he walked up to his fire place and shouted out the address of the person who he knew would have the two things that he needed at that moment. A copious amount of stiff drink and sage advice that Draco desperately needed.
“’Night,” said Draco as he transfigured his clothes into a set of black silk pajamas and removed his shoes. Pulling his wand out he thought of his happiest memory and conjured his patronus, a massive Common Welsh green, “I am going to spend the night at Blaise’s house but I will be there in the morning to pick up Scorpius, I love you.” Sending it on its way to the Manor and his mother. Making his way into Blaise’s spare bedroom, Draco pulled back the blanket and sheets, laying down, allowing Morpheus to wrap his conscious into sleep.
“So, Draco are we not going to address the proverbial Hippogriff in the room?” asked his mother with the subtly of said hippogriff in the middle of Muggle London.
“You came after me?” asked Harry, shocked.
Though to be honest Harry hadn’t been back in England for more than a week or so at a time since he had graduated from Hogwarts. After which had decided that he had had enough of fighting and taking down dark witches, wizards and criminals to thoroughly last him several lifetimes he had to come up with a plan b. He had been staying with Bill and Fleur Weasley at Shell Cottage, trying to avoid the press and the notoriety that came with being Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived. Bill had suggested that with his excellent background and Outstanding on his Defense Against the Dark Arts NEWTS, he should look into getting a job with Gringotts as a Curse-Breaker. It would be work that would take him out of the country and the limelight that he so despised. Once there however he realized that his love wouldn’t be the excitement of Curse breaking but the relaxing unearthing of artifacts and the history behind them. He had met some amazing people along the way and reunited with a few that he would have rather forgotten existed.
Kreacher nodded in confirmation and headed of back towards the kitchen, while Harry raised up out of his spot in the overstuffed armchair that he had been occupying, detouring towards the front powder room off the front hallways.
After dropping Scorpius off at Andromeda’s house and greeting both his aunt and mother, who had been spending a lot of time with her sister because of the lack of company at the Manor. His mother was lonely, but he really didn’t know what to tell her. He didn’t know if she would ever marry again after the death of Lucius. Despite what had been the beginning of their marriage and how it had come about, Lucius and Narcissa had in the end been a love match. Draco had wanted that, but unfortunately that had not been possible, for Draco’s heart had already been taken with full willingness by Harry. Draco loved how it felt to be with Harry. Harry’s go with the flow attitude towards life allowed Draco to see the world so much differently than he had ever been able to. And now that he had the freedom to dictate his own life, he had decided that it was time to live the way that he wanted.
“I don’t believe so, I took a partial day at work today, and decided to come by and spend the afternoon with Teddy and you two.”
“Hey, you have turned out pretty damn great, despite Lucius and Abraxas Malfoy, and Scorpius is amazing, and so lucky to have you as a dad,” said Harry as he reached across the couch in an effort to comfort the other man.
“Right away Master. Please don’t forget to eat, or else it will be I that has to face Mistress Narcissa.”
“Yeah Blaise mentioned that Fred finally plucked up the courage to owl him and ask for a proper date, instead of their pointed “run ins” that Blaise kept arranging,” chuckled Draco. “He’s been mad about Weasley for years, noticed him all the way back at Hogwarts.”
“Of course, he has a bedroom here and he can just spend the night here,” replied Narcissa before looking over at Andromeda. “Would you and Teddy like to spend the night? Scorpius could probably use a playmate. And we can get up to mischief and drink the expensive wine and gossip like we used to as girls.”
“6:30 or 7?”
“You are so hard on yourself Draco. Harry is to blame as well. He didn’t fight for you, he took the coward’s way out and ran, and he’s been running ever since,” replied Andromeda.
, however, Lucius’ passing did cause your family a level of sadness and loss, and for that I am sorry.”
“Um, I don’t know about that Scorpius, that’s really up to your father. And shouldn’t you want to spend the time at the museum with him?” asked Harry, stuttering over his words in shock.
Draco nodded before walking off, grumbling about nosy batty women who had nothing better to do with their time. But thinking better of it and took out his wand and thought of the first time the two men said that they I love you to one another, and conjured his massive Common Welsh Green Dragon patronus and said, “Harry, my son has informed me of the issued invitation to the museums tomorrow, will it be possible to floo and discuss it. This seems faster than sending an owl.”
“Thank you Twinkle. We appreciate it. One last thing and you can go back to your embroidery for a bit, would you mind taking the packages that I deposited onto the Breakfast Room table to my flat. You don’t even need to put them away and just put them in my office.”
Making his way through the crowds of people, he was so caught up in his own pensive thoughts that he wasn’t watching where he was going, wandering aimlessly, not as interested in his ice cream and quiet afternoon as he had been just an hour prior. From across the street Harry heard an all too familiar voice.
“Right away, Master Draco,” replied the little elf, and with a snap of her fingers she disappeared.
“You still love him?” asked Blaise.
Another couple hours later, Harry left with the promise to be back sooner rather than later to visit.
After the remnants of lunch had been cleared and cleaned up, the boys hurried off to continue playing, dragging Harry with them. They wanted Harry to play the Dragon while they were knights trying to “defeat him to save the castle and its inhabitants,” which turned to be a group of stuffed toys that they had crammed into the makeshift castle.
The boys came rushing back into the garden followed by Ted. “Alright, lets eat, anyone want fruit?”
“Well I am sure that Andromeda and my mother will be at my flat around 9:30, and we will leave immediately following. We will be taking a car, but you are welcome to apparate to the park nearby and meet us there. We are going to the Science Museum first, having lunch and then heading over to the Natural History Museum,” said Draco.
“Oh? Who else is here?”
“Oh Draco, you just missed Harry,” said Andromeda.
“Yes, I caught a glimpse of him in Diagon Alley just a little while ago,” he replied in a way that he hoped didn’t give away how shaken up the encounter had really made him.
Harry woke up early on the following Friday after his run in with Draco. He had worked hard all week but decided to cut out early on Friday and take a half day. By just going into his office to finish up a couple of fire call meetings with the Chinese Ministry to finish up the final negotiations for the rights to the findings of the last dig that they had conducted in the mountains of northern China. Afterwards he decided to grab some soup and sandwiches from a café in the muggle part of London and take it to Andromeda’s house so he could visit with her, Ted and little Teddy. After ordering a couple of large containers of hearty French Onion Soup and a large loaf of crusty bread. As well as a large cold cut hoagie sandwich cut into four portions, Harry headed back into The Leaky Cauldron and apparated get to Andromeda’s house in Southern England.
He quickly put out the fire and tipped the water from the kettle into the teapot with his wand before returning to the living room in a hurry.
make it better". he promised, looking Ron in the eye.
Harry’s head turned dangerously, carrying his body with her, forcing him to hang on to the office in front of him, to support himself and prevent him from falling. His hands touching the small notebook, now wet, the fine snow having melted almost immediately after his magic stopped.
That's why he ended up sipping a ButterBeer at one of the many buffet tables that the establishment had set up during this Christmas Eve with his own company.
Harry got in the way and faced Malfoy.
“What are we toasting?”
This one looked at him calmly, his grey orbs were piercing, but no hint of animosity seemed to have settled there.
Harry frowned before remembering the night he had just passed.
“I’m really sorry…” he said, pouting.
Harry sneered.
OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoO
Harry only held for a few seconds before unveiling his teeth slightly and emitting a little puffed laugh. Malfoy ended up loosening his lips a bit until he displayed a thin smile before turning his head towards the stage.
Ron’s smile when he held his shoulder.
When he had arrived in front of the hospital, Malfoy had escorted him to the secretary’s office where he had announced and abandoned him to go to work.
“What-”
How could he have slipped that far? Without thinking about Ginny? She who loved him and for whom he had deep feelings, but that had not been the case last night. For a few minutes, Malfoy was all that mattered. He and his fucking hand, Malfoy and his fucking mouth gave him a totally confusing desire. So much so that he had forgotten his girlfriend for a moment of pure madness, of a need to satisfy his desire for Malfoy which had been dragging for too long now.
Harry turned his head, looking for Ron among the students of the class. He had only created tiny flames all over the canvas stretched out in front of him, but seemed quite satisfied with his efforts for today as he smiled at him.
"It is very weird, but that's the story of my life, isn't it?" said Harry, laughing as he realised this. "It's been OK so far, actually. No doubt we have all sorts of problems yet to come, but the first few hours of this bond have been... encouraging. We actually just came to tell you that we'll be living at Malfoy Manor for the time being; Kreacher's moving my stuff across from Grimmauld Place as we speak."
"It's a date," said Harry, and with one last kiss he stepped into the Floo, leaving Draco lying on the sofa with a soppy grin on his face.
Draco smiled and lifted Harry's hands to kiss them. "I am too," he said. "And it
He led Harry to the small dining table, where two formal place settings awaited them. "You're the first person I've ever actually cooked a meal for, other than me," he confessed. "So please don't laugh too much if I do something wrong."
Harry laughed hollowly. "Not even then. That sort of felt like a chore, actually. It was always Ginny that instigated it, and she liked to get straight down to business. I didn't mind – it's part of marriage, isn't it? And my kids wouldn't exist if we hadn't done it. But I've never really been able to see why people rave about sex itself so much. It just felt awkward to me. I certainly don't miss it."
"You know, I was quite surprised when I found there were wizarding communities all over the place," said Harry, remembering. "You wouldn’t believe how long I thought all wizards lived in either London, Hogsmeade, Godric’s Hollow or Ottery St Catchpole."
"Never thought I'd be in a threesome with Draco bloody Malfoy, but times have changed, haven't they?" said Ron. He winked at Draco, and Draco was privately amused when he caused Ron's jaw to drop by winking back.
"Perfect," Harry told him. "But all your displays are always amazing, so you sprang to mind immediately when I was trying to think of a distraction."
Each of the Catherine wheels stopped spinning and seemed to explode, one after another in a rhythmic sequence. Each of them produced a shower of brightly-coloured sparks which persisted some time after the explosion, and when the sparks had died away there was a message left on the wall in sparkly blue and purple writing. It said "Welcome back, Draco!"
"I almost daren't ask, but... what do you mean by 'someone like me' in this particular case?" asked Draco.
“It just annoys me every time,” she was saying. “Coca-Cola are the worst. Have you seen their posters this year? They’re all over the place: Holidays are Coming. And I know they’re an American company, but surely they could have done some
to do it, but actually you're making an awful lot of sense. Can we talk about it again tomorrow, in case either of us feels differently when we've slept?"
"Is that alright, Harry?" asked Draco. "Or would you prefer something else?"
"Not even tomorrow," said Draco. "I've got the day off. I don't have to be at work until Thursday afternoon."
"He keeps in quite close contact with his Beauxbatons counterpart, I believe; I imagine your name must have come up in conversation. Anyway, as I told you earlier, Harry arrived yesterday with the students, and will be here for the first two weeks of term, but will leave for his trip after lessons end on Friday the thirteenth of September. If you were to arrive on the morning of Saturday the fourteenth, that would be most convenient: that way, the house-elves could be sure that the rooms were ready for your use, and you could have the weekend to get acclimatised to the school before starting teaching on the Monday morning. We'll need you until Friday the twenty-seventh, but you'd have to leave that evening because Harry will be back on the Saturday morning. How does all that sound?"
"We've managed OK since Saturday without me being in the wizarding world, haven't we?" Draco pointed out. "And I do have a life
Ginny isn't like that... hasn't been like that for ages, except that I was too stupid to notice."
Harry raised his eyebrows. "I'm not convinced you could ever include yourself in that description," he said. "I'm certainly prepared to believe it about myself, though."
remember of it?" he asked gently. "We both said that we're thrilled to have each other as good friends, but that we're definitely also very attracted to each other. You said you wanted to go slowly, for very understandable reasons, and I said that I was fine with that, and that I want you in every possible way but am very happy to be patient. Does that help?"
(Benjamin Bernheim)
Prompt: 12: A snowy walk through the city
"You look like a woodland nymph," Draco told her. "I love it. Also, green is a very appropriate choice, for reasons to do with all this magical stuff that we
"I feel slightly sorry for them, actually," said Hermione, when Harry pointed this out. "I imagine that the four soloists are supposed to be fairly equal in importance, but Draco was so obviously the best. Bet they weren't expecting that, when they turned up today. According to the programme, they've all done lots of these solos, but this was your first time, wasn't it?"
"Do you really think we should approach them in the pub, though?" Hermione wondered. "It seems a bit informal for such a big discussion. Plus, I don't think we should do it as a group. What do you think, Draco?"
“No! Well, yes, in a way! But no,” she said. “But I don’t know what to do, and you seem to be quite good at miracles, so I figured it was worth asking you.”
"I know, and it's OK," said Draco. "As long as
happened to be there if she really had an accident. Sorry. I'd send her a Patronus to prove you're lying, but I know she
Harry looked at him, aghast, and replayed the conversation in his mind. "You're absolutely right," he said, when he'd done so. "I'm an idiot, and I'm so sorry. Of course I can see you've changed – I doubt I'd be here right now if you hadn't. But I guess now you can see why I'm single. I always seem to do this – every time I make a connection with someone, I say something stupid and they run away."
"Ready, willing and able," said Harry with a grin. He took hold of Draco's arm, and held his breath as they Apparated.
just a one-off, trust me. So please will you show me your cock now?"
Draco raised his eyebrows and grinned at Harry, his eyes twinkling. "My hero!" he said. "I'm impressed. Thank you for the support. I'm guessing she hasn't replied? How long ago did you send it?"
Draco grinned. "Now
Ron looked uncomfortable. "I'm sorry I can't say the same, mate," he said, "but you know I was stupid in fourth year, don't you? And I was wrong, and I hope I've grown up enough not to make that mistake again."
he was staring at – was encouraging, however.
When he reached the Leaky Cauldron, he winced, because he could hear Ginny's voice while he was still outside. He couldn't make out any actual words, though – just the shrieking and excessively loud talking of a group of women who had clearly been drinking all afternoon. He took a deep breath and opened the door.
big," protested Harry. "It's probably because you're looking up at it or something. I'm sure that must do something to the perspective, or something."
Harry and Ron realise how brilliant Hermione is, and Draco receives a message.
"I think there are probably people who fancy you who'd surprise you," said Draco. "But I don't want to freak you out, so I won't speculate. Are you sure you want another song? I thought you'd be sick of them by now."
Draco burst out laughing. "No – and I've never made this connection till now! We donated the books to Hogwarts!"
Ron Weasley was standing in the doorway. "What’s
"Sounds like an interesting way to spend your time."
Draco nodded and Apparated.
"We're
"Hello, Potter," said a voice that couldn’t possibly belong to Draco Malfoy, as Harry stumbled from the fireplace. The voice was deeper than he’d been expecting – not exactly a bass, but definitely a baritone, thought Harry. It hadn’t been that deep last time they met, had it?
"Oh, stop it," said Harry. "I admit I'm still a bit freaked out by the whole thing, but that doesn't mean you should keep apologising. Who knows? Maybe we'll turn out to be a perfect match!"
"We'll have to look into that sometime," mused Draco. "See if there's something that's causing the problem. Although they should have spotted that when you did your exam."
now seen all five seasons in the last few weeks, that's not the same as being obsessed with it for five years."
*******
Draco looked up at him, alarmed, but Harry drew him in tighter. "It's a good thing you didn't do that," he told Ron. "I would have been extremely unimpressed if you had."
, but then a
"Sorry," said Draco. "It was nothing, really. It's OK now, so it doesn't matter."
The waterfall was breathtaking in more ways than one; the water thundered down a hundred-foot drop, creating a deafening din as it crashed to the rocks below, and the resultant spray was icy cold.
it, so I had a hair transplant. I feel a bit of a fraud, but I'd rather that than have no hair. Shallow, aren't I?"
"Well, you’re not a stranger, are you?" said Draco, smiling. "Plus, I happen to know that you’re gay too, so maybe it felt a bit easier."
Harry, who had smiled slightly at 'hooligan', suddenly looked on the verge of tears again. "The bathroom," he whispered. "Draco, I've never apologised to you for that, and I should have. I had no idea what that spell did, but I knew it wouldn't be anything pleasant. I should never have used it. On
“So how are we going to do this?” asked Draco.
Draco pulled his head out of the fireplace and cut the connection. Draco went into the kitchen, asking Ted if he would like him to take the plates, forks and napkins outside. “That would be lovely, thank you Draco. It is almost finished I am taking it out of the oven and we should let it cool for about 10 minutes. I will spoon some onto the children’s plates and put them in the cold cabinet for a minute or so, so it’s not so hot for them.”
“Oh Kreacher, I didn’t even to think that you might be lonely here by yourself while I am away. Yes, you are welcome to go where you would like. I am sure that Molly would love the help, and even someone to knit with her. I am sorry Kreacher, I should have thought of that much sooner than now,” said Harry ashamed of his insensitivity towards the elf.
“You both have taken to many experiment backfires to the head. If I didn’t know any better, I would swear that Molly or Arthur dropped you as children. I really must ask them if you retained any head injury as a child,” laughed Harry, shaking his head in disbelief. “But seriously though, Blaise is alright. We talked a bit when we all went back for the make-up year and to take our exams.”
“Master Draco, Mistress has sent me to give you this plate of dinner. She suspected that you would forget to eat supper without anyone here to remind you,” squeaked the small creature.
“Mr. Potter, there is no need for you to be unnecessarily polite. We both know that was no love lost between you and Lucius. And call me Narcissa, please.”
“Just some French onion soup with a cold cut sandwiches and some crusty bread if someone doesn’t want a sandwich. Hello Andy, Hello Mrs. Malfoy. How are you two ladies doing today?”
“Oh, thank you Kreacher. I’ll be in there in just a moment, just going to freshen up and wash my hands. Make yourself a plate if you would like, like I said I’ll be just a moment.”
“Harry, we’re wizards, we could go to Paris, Rome, or Madrid in a matter of a seconds. That could be beneficial. You loved Paris when we went.”
Blaise had just closed the window sending off the owl carrying the letter he had just sent to Fred Weasley, confirming their lunch date for the following day when the fireplace chimed, indicating someone wanted to come through for a visit. Considering there few people who knew where he lived, he figured it could only be a handful of people. With a wave of his wand he allowed the person entrance, unsurprised by the identity of the person who stepped out of the fireplace in a fire of green and onto the rug in front of it.
“I’ll always love him. With Harry, I could breathe. I could be myself. I truly loved Astoria and what she gave me, for what she sacrificed. For that I will love her, in a way. Like one loves their very best friend. But there was nothing ever romantic about our relationship. My mother and father don’t even know this, but when we had Scorpius, we used muggle methods. Astoria understood that I felt like I was dishonoring Harry even more by, sleeping with her. Our marriage was never actually consummated. I couldn’t do it, and thankfully Astoria understood. So, we went to a muggle fertility clinic, and we put on the front that I was just a friend that was making her dream of having a child of her own come true. When really it was the other way around. Astoria was someone who will always be precious to me. However, without Harry, I am lost. I have been lost for over five years. Five years of feeling like I was drowning under water. However, Harry will never forgive me. That was made clear this evening. He can’t even stand to be around me. I have lost that chance, forever.”
“Hello, Scorpius, it’s nice to meet you too,” said Harry while shaking the little hand that had been offered.
“I don’t know if I can do that.”
“Right away Master Draco,” came the squeaky reply from the female elf before she went back into the manor.
“Okay grandmama, come on Scorpius,” said Teddy while he grabbed Scorpius’ hand, and dragged the little boy into the house.
“That would be lovely. Would you also get some pumpkin juice for Scorpius in one of his special cups?”
“Oh! Anyone I might know, Fred?” asked Harry of the other man, who had turned a shade of red similar to his hair.
As Draco made his way through the pass of Admiral Arch leading to the roundabout leading into Trafalgar Square. As Draco crossed the square looking at the Lion statues, reminding him of Harry. Heading towards the National Gallery, thinking to himself that Scorpius may enjoy going there soon. He stopped at the steps and took a seat looking out over the lit fountain and clear evening.
There was a collection of various greetings from the rest of the group, as they walked into the large stone structure. They made their way through the museum, having fun with all of the different things for the kids to do. Between playing with the different hands on exhibits and the science demonstrations they were busy from one thing to another until they had to stop, to get lunch, the large group, walked up Exhibition Road to the Natural History Museum that also hosted a café where they could stop and eat lunch. They grabbed an ordered they food and drink before grabbing a table in the busy seating area. With the sisters next to each other and the boys taking the other two seats at the four-seater table. Which cause Draco and Harry to awkwardly take the table next to them. Harry opened his sandwich without comment, despite Draco looking across the table at him.
Draco hummed in response and walked straight over to his liquor cabinet and poured himself a generous portion of Odgen’s.
Draco didn’t sleep as well as he would have hoped. Memories creeping into his dreams, that would morph into nightmares.
“And I told you last week that I didn’t want you putting your noses into the middle of it. This whole situation is complicated enough without Scorpius getting attached to Harry, without any forethought. Because he will. Harry is great with kids; he seems to attract them wherever he goes. So now I have to go send an owl to Harry, hoping that he doesn’t disappoint my son. So, thanks for that.”
Harry looked up surprised to find that Draco was right, “How did we completely miss that?”
“You two are the busiest body women that I have ever met. You could give Albus Dumbledore a run for his galleons. I don’t need your help. I need to be focusing on taking care of Scorpius. He takes precedence over everything.”
“I mean Father was never very fond of Zuri, he thought that she was unrealistic and flippant, more concerned to her wealth and status, than following the cause to maintain the purity of our society. He saw her just as another society wife. My mother I think respected her at least, for allowing Blaise to make his own decisions in his beliefs. I know sometimes she wishes that she could’ve given me that choice. But Father was the head of the house, what he said was law, there wasn’t to be any deviation from his quote, unquote grand plan to keep the Malfoy name where it stood within society. Well lot of good that did him. He lost society’s respect, the Malfoy name is in the dumps, and he died leaving Scorpius and I to clean up his and his own father’s mess.”
“Yes, he is at the Manor with my Mother, Aunt and playing with the small Lupin boy. They are very close.”
“Draco, you and I both know that you are not known for your patience. And if we are going to do this, we may as well do it proper and in full. We can start off as dating, and we will take it slow. I need to get to know not only you again, but also Scorpius. If I am going to be in his life, I need to know him. However, I do believe that it would be better to wait to tell him a bit, I also do want to take this slowly. We go out, we spend time together, but for now I would rather take sex slowly. We didn’t exactly do that the last time.”
“That does sound wonderful.”
“Oh, nothing other than telling me where my mother is.”
Draco Malfoy wasn’t usually one to let himself be caught off guard. He had survived a war with nothing but his wits, intelligence and a lot of self-preservation. He had the uncanny ability to have one eye on what was happening around him. So, when he was caught unaware by the man across the street with untidy black hair and soulful green eyes, Draco was perturbed to say the least.
Harry looked down at his half-eaten sandwich, not feeling hungry anymore. “I should apologize for not trusting you enough, for just running off, multiple times in fact. I was a right coward, and it wasn’t very Gryffindor like. I saw that announcement in the Prophet, and I just couldn’t be there anymore. I went to Jones, and asked for a transfer, a different dig site, anything, as far away as possible. I ended up in Peru. I told Jones and the rest of the guys that if you came looking for me that I didn’t want you following me. I owled Ron and Hermione and told them what I was doing and where I was going. They had owled as soon as they saw the paper and were concerned. I just ran, and your mother and Andromeda are right I have been running ever since. I have avoided relationships, and anything to do with them.”
thought a voice that sounded suspiciously like the haughty and sneering tones of his former school nemesis. And just like that Draco Malfoy looked up, finally taking in his surroundings, spotting the messy haired brunette from across the street less than fifteen meters away. Eyes of liquid mercury met those of emerald and softened.
After finishing the dragon disappeared. Harry pulled out his wand and conjured his own stag patronus. “Yeah, give me a moment to pull down the wards on the Floo.”
Harry looked at the twins with a sheepish guilty cringe. “I have no idea what you mean.”
“Closure,” Harry provided.
“6:30 is fine gives me time to get Scorp settled at home and with my mother,” replied Draco, who looked around, realizing that their companions had left them behind. “It appears that we have been left.”
, on the corduroy trousers and the blue button-down shirt and green plaid bowtie. While also transfiguring his loafer, style shoes into some athletic shoes. “Go on, Scorp.”
“Well thank you all the same Twinkle.”
“Thanks,” said Draco sniffling, and pulling away. He looked at Harry one last time before reaching onto the mantle and took a handful of the powder out of the pot, stepping into the fireplace and threw the powder, waved his other hand at Harry, and called out the Tonks’ address.
“I guess not. Thank you Kreacher. I think I will go take that walk you suggested,” said Harry rising from his chair taking his plate to the sink and rinsing it off and setting the brush to magically start washing the dishes.
“Merlin, George shut up,” mumbled Fred through his fingers.
Chapter 1
“How are you Mrs. Malfoy? I am sorry to have heard about your husband’s passing,” said Harry.
The rest of the evening passed rather quickly. After eating dinner, Scorpius became rather subdued, having spent so much energy playing with Teddy and Harry, as well as the excitement he expended when Draco informed him that Harry had agreed to accompany them to the museums the following day. With a very sleepy Scorpius in his arms, Draco left the Tonks residence and apparated back to his flat and getting the little boy ready for bed, with a quick bath and a short story. Scorpius was already asleep not even half way through the book. Draco kissed his son on the forehead, brushing aside the pale blonde bangs in the process.
“So, Harry, tell us about your travels. We heard you were in China last. However, I haven’t seen you since you were in Istanbul. Or was it Germany that you were when we last saw you?” asked Andromeda.
Crossing the Alley, Harry slipped into the shop as the bell jingled above the door.
of you to be happy.”
“I ran into Harry today, twice.”
Draco thought of all of the things that he had come to regret over the years at the top of those things was leaving his relationship with Harry the way he did. With Harry he had had it all. A friendship so deep that he could never replace it. Astoria had been a god send because she knew that his heart and thoughts strayed to another. She would see the far off look on his face when he thought she wasn’t looking. Despite all of that, she gave him his son. His beautiful baby boy, Scorpius. She had given him a precious gift without judgement. He didn’t want to take that for granted.
“I know it can’t. I just feel that these are things that you should know,” said Draco quietly. “Look I know that you plan on leaving for South America in a couple of months, but I would like for us to try to be some semblance of friends again.”
“I appreciate it, Harry. We will see you tomorrow.”
“Maybe, but Lucius Malfoy has never been a man that you say no to. Let alone tell him to buzz off and let you live your life. I remember how angry he was when I tricked him into freeing Dobby in our second year.”
Teddy jogged over to Scorpius and grabbed his had and dragged him over to the group of adults. “Scorpius, this is my Uncle Harry. He travels a lot so he isn’t around a lot. He digs in the dirt and finds really old people and their stuff.”
“Yep, the one and the same,” grinned George mischievously as Fred buried his face in his hands, horrified.
“You’re gonna- “
Scorpius bound over to his father, wrapping his little arms around Draco’s legs. At least trying to. “Papa, Papa! I met Teddy’s uncle Harry. CAN HE COME TO THE MUSEUM WITH US? I ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD COME BUT HE SAID IT WAS UP TO YOU!”
Harry sputtered. “Kreacher, I- uh, hmm, yes. He was.”
“Thank you that is an excellent suggestion Kreacher. I’m sorry that I haven’t seemed myself today. I saw someone in Diagon Alley that I wasn’t expecting to.”
“You really shouldn’t have to apologize, I knew what was happening, I should have told you and trusted you with what was happening,” said Draco.
As Harry made his way down the cobbled streets of the wizarding part of London, he thought about the past few months. He had just got back from the far east, where he had headed a joint project with the Chinese wizarding government. They had discovered some interesting artifacts that seemed to be dated around the time of the Hogwarts founders.
Harry and Draco got up and threw away their trash and made their way to the exhibits, taking their time walking around. They didn’t really have the need to rush, knowing that Andromeda and Narcissa had the boys well in hand. They got through the museum by 4 pm and made their way to Hyde Park, where they decided to apparate back to Harry’s house, Harry having to hold onto Draco, before showing him the slip of paper that the address was written on, revealing the house as it emerged between numbers 11 and 13. Opening the door Harry called out for Kreacher, asking for tea. Harry led them into the living room where they sat on opposite ends of the couch turned slightly so they were looking at each other.
“Master Harry, dinner is being ready,” called Kreacher from the doorway. Harry looked up from the spot on the carpet that he had been staring at when he had gotten lost in those memories from what felt were so long ago.
“Well thank you for the pep talk Mother, but I must get back to London. I have some work that I must do. Is Scorpius okay to spend the rest of the day with you?”
“So polite. I heard that you have already encountered my son.”
Harry went and grabbed a sweater off of the back of the chair in his office, putting on his shoes and heading towards the door, making sure he had his wand and wallet, walking out the front door into the cool early evening air.
Before either of the women could answer there was an excited screech from across the garden. “Harry!”
“That’s fair, what time?”
“Oh, Scorpius, I don’t know if that is a good idea. Teddy’s uncle and I have some adult things to take care of before we can go to the museums together,” said Draco, looking at his Mother, whom he could tell was trying to put on a face of innocence.
“Harry, I would love to try again. I know that we can’t start where we left off, its been to long, and our lives are so different than they were in Egypt. I have Scorpius, and that makes me a package deal now. I also know that you are supposed to being going to Central America on that exhibition, but I would like to try. We could even start out as friends like before, take it slow. All I know is that I still love you, and I want to be with you again,” said Draco, who was wildly gesturing with his hands.
“He was here to visit with us and Teddy. He’s Teddy’s godfather, having been close friends with both Dora and Remus. Remus went to school with my cousin Sirius and James Potter. He was sort of an honorary god father to Harry after Sirius succumbed to the Veil in the Department of Mysteries.”
Over the course of the next week, Draco avoided the pointed questions of his mother and stayed busy with Scorpius and work. On the following Friday, Draco took Scorpius to Andromeda’s house to visit with Teddy while he was out to a few meetings with potential business investors for Malfoy Enterprises and trying to close up some loose ends before the weekend. He had plans to take Scorpius to the Science Museum. They had a children’s tour and activities that Draco was sure Scorpius would love.
After finishing his rather filling dinner, Draco decided that it would be a good idea to head out and take an evening stroll, if nothing else than to help digest the large dinner he had partaken. Reaching for his blazer and wand he got up and left his flat disapparating into the abandoned streets of London.
“That’s bull shit and you know it, Potter,” grinned Fred. “So how was it? Did you enjoy the dig?”
“Oh, shove off you prats,” Harry muttered. “So, what have you two been up to? Any one got your knickers in a twist?”
“Not officially or permanently I suppose. He is apparently getting ready for an excursion in Central and South America. Something about ancient civilizations and their religious leaders being seers, and prophecies.”
“Ah, well that explains it. You haven’t seen him since you came back here from Egypt and your father announced your marriage to Astoria. So, he really is back?”
“Oh! Yes, I think you do, he’s from your class in fact! Zabini is his last name.”
“Can we please talk,” asked Draco.
Snapping out of his reverie, Harry saw the flash of blonde through the crowd of families making their way down the street and in and out of the museum, Harry straightened up and walked the few feet over to the entrance.
thought Harry to himself. Harry right then knew he was screwed. He always told himself that Draco’s son was going to be a photo copied version of Draco at that age, or at least what Draco portrayed himself as. Draco had never been shy about the fact that he had in fact been quite the terror as a kid. An act of misbehavior to gain the attention of his inattentive parents.
Draco appeared with a crack in front of the Tonks’ residence at half past 4 later that afternoon, prepared to pick his son up before heading home for dinner, a bath and some reading. Draco knocked on the door, waiting until Ted Tonks answered the door, wrapped in an apron, wooden spoon in hand. “Draco! You must be here to pick up Scorp. They’re all in the back. Go on ahead, would you like to stay for supper, it’s no trouble we have plenty for everyone. Its Shepard’s Pie night.”
“ I am sorry to bother you, but it seems that Scorpius has gotten it into his head that tomorrow while we are at the museums, I will be bored and lonely because he will be spending all of his time with Teddy, and I will end up a fifth wheel.”
“Papa, can I go play with Teddy?” asked Scorpius.
After staring after his son for a minute he turned back to the women, and took a seat at the table they had settled at. A pop sounded, announcing Twinkle’s arrival with fresh tea and an assortment of cakes and tea sandwiches, as well as Scorpius’ cup and an additional magically chilled carafe of pumpkin juice.
With a flick of the wrist the large dragon dissolved into a light and swept out of the house.
Thinking back, he considered if there was anything that could have saved what was.
“Oh, that sounds wonderful. And even better it keeps me from having to expose my son to my horrendous cooking skills,” laughed Draco.
Draco looked at Harry, “I should go get Scorpius and take him home. He is probably exhausted from the excitement of today.”
“Thank you, Kreacher, it all looks wonderful,” thanked Harry.
“Well, I don’t know if you really can label Blaise, he probably wouldn’t appreciate it. The thing with Blaise is that he loves the finer things in life. He also is attracted to those who he thinks are beautiful, and that doesn’t exclude those who he sees as beautiful on the inside too. He’s kind of a romantic like that. He has ideals that people should follow. Probably from his sketchy upbringing. His mother was someone who looked at her husbands as a means as an end. They were someone to raise her status in society through station and wealth. Which is probably why she never sought to follow Voldemort and Death Eaters, she saw them as just lowly thugs, and didn’t really involve herself with the politics of it all, thus keeping Blaise out of it. She knew the realities that there were muggles out there that had even more money and power than even the most influential of wizarding families, why should the fact that they can’t preform magic effect the way that they make their wealth or control and run a country? I mean looking back on it, she had a point. Alas, hindsight is 20/20 isn’t it?” explained Draco.
With that Twinkle disappeared with a pop. Draco sighed, he really wasn’t up to eating but knew that somehow the little protective house elf would know that Draco hadn’t eaten his dinner, and he would have to endure both his mother and Twinkle lecturing him on the importance of keeping himself healthy. So, with reluctance he uncovered the tray and dug into the salmon, vegetables and roasted potatoes, but pleased to see that there was also a rather large dish of chocolate mousse topped with a heaping dollop of cream and berries.
“But I came back, I came back after the first two weeks, to try to explain it to you. However, you were already gone by then, and no matter how much I would ask the other people in our group, they wouldn’t tell me where you had gone. Look, Harry I am so sorry. I know that there is seldom chance that you will ever forgive me. I miss my best friend, not just my lover. I did- I do love you, and I don’t have any other explanation except that I was a coward. I should have stood up for myself and for my relationship with you. We could have worked it out.”
“Maybe not,
“Harry! How’s it going, mate? When did you get back from Asia? Ron and Hermione haven’t mentioned it,” exclaimed Fred from in front of a large display of Skiving Snackboxes.

“So, her political and personal views didn’t bother your parents when you were associating with him,” asked Harry.
Draco cast his eyes down for a minute, trying to regain his mental equilibrium. He knew that his mother had some semblance of an idea as to what had happened while he was in Egypt, but to the extent of that knowledge he was unsure. He dearly loved his mother, if he hadn’t, he wouldn’t have put himself through what he had. However, Narcissa Malfoy nee Black was a woman that liked to put her nose where it had no business being.
A little while later, Narcissa called over Scorpius and quietly said something to him, before he responded with a rather loud confirmation, before running back to Teddy and Harry. “Mwister Harry will you come with us to the Museum?”
Harry was making his way across the front of the National Gallery towards Trafalgar Square to look at the fountain, but stopped as he reached the steps. There he was, an unmistakable head of the palest blonde hair, the man that had plagued his thoughts since that morning. Harry had thought about turning around and making a run for it, but he must have been heard, for he turned around on the step he was perched on. For the second time that day, molten mercury eyes met those of the brightest emerald, and the two men were lost. Having spent so much of the day lost in memories of years past. Wishing that they could just go back to those days spent in the hot sun, and chilly nights surrounded by sand and stars. Endless amounts of stars, where they would lay on thick Egyptian cotton blankets looking up at the stars, finding the constellations, and the stars that they studied. However, that wasn’t the reality for either man.
Harry looked at the time, before deciding that he should head out to meet with the Malfoys and Tonks. He apparated into a secluded part of Hyde Park, before making his way down Exhibition Road towards the Science Museum. When he arrived at the outside of the Museum he leaned casually against the building’s exterior, waiting for the others. Harry was early so he wasn’t worried, plus there was the matter that the adults would have had to rally the two children to be ready and on time. After experiencing Ron and Hermione’s whirlwind entrances to family functions, with their two children in tow, but usually either right on time or late. Hermione, even with all of her timed planning down to the minute, couldn’t deny that having children made being early to events was certainly a harder task than many would believe.
The next morning Draco woke up early. Having tossed and turned all night, finally giving up around 6 in the morning before going back into the living room and grabbing a book from the shelf and sitting down to read. He really had no other choice but to sit around until it was an appropriate time to go pick up his son.
“Draco dear, Harry is a very complicated man. He has had a difficult life, dealing with more than anyone his age should have. Both of you have. You both have the right to be happy. He has spent the last five years running. Running from the press, the expectations that the wizarding world has for him, expectations that he has for himself. And most of all he has been running from you. Now, a little birdy in the Ministry has told me that he is set to leave for Central America in two months. You have until then to make your case of him forgiving you, or at least be back in his better graces,” explained Andromeda.
“Well, it is good for Scorp to have a playmate around his age, who knows maybe he will be introduced to the other Weasley children, the oldest has children around that age as well as does Ronald.”
“Hi Fred, I just got back about a week ago, but to be honest I slept the first couple of days I got back because of the time difference and trying to recalibrate my internal time clock. I was just in the Alley to go deal with some business with the Goblins and to get a book that I needed for my research and I decided to drop by while I waited for the crowds to calm and the lunch breaks to end.”
“Oh yes, closure, thank you.”
“Maybe you could teach at the Wizarding side of Cambridge or at Oxford. I am sure they would love to have a professor of your caliber. I heard that Hogwarts was looking into a new History of Magic professor, finally.”
“Thank you, Ted.”
“Excellent idea, Harry, I also have some fruit cut up in the fridge that can have as well. Teddy will you tell your grandfather to bring that out as well.”
The father and son duo reappeared in front of the towering wrought iron gates of Malfoy Manor, the wards recognizing their patriarchic head of household and let him pass through without much more than the cold chill that was felt as they passed through the invisible barriers around the property. Walking up to the door he opened it, calling as he entered, “Twinkle?”
“Me too. It’ll be a lot of fun,” said Harry with a smile. Harry looked up at the others that had joined them. “Hello, Scorpius, Narcissa. Hi Andy. Draco.”
“Oh well come in, come in. We were just in the back garden with a spot of tea. You aren’t the first person to pop over however.”
“No, I didn’t. But to be fair I never went looking for it. I never went and confronted him.”
“So glad you approve little brother,” exclaimed George as he clapped and rubbed his hands together in a clearly puckish way.
As Harry passed Florish and Blotts, Harry decided to take care of his business at Gringotts first before going and retrieving his book that he had ordered the week before. Maybe after he would go to Florean Fortescue’s and get a sundae and sit out on the terrace and spend some time reading his book. It was a beautiful early May morning and he knew he would enjoy the nice weather while it was available. He had spent so much time in the past few months in the bitter cold of Northern China that the change in climate had been most welcome.
“She’s being in the garden with your Aunt and cousin. Would you like me to bring fresh tea?”
“While that is sweet, I think the first couple of dates, I would rather it be just us, I know there are still some things that we need to take care of before we involve him. I also would like to let him get to know you better, so it might be smart if we just have time with everyone and let him get used to you being around. I am not even sure what to tell him at this point that he will understand what is happening, I haven’t actually been in a proper relationship since you. Astoria and I weren’t really a true couple and Scorpius never got to meet him.”
“Oh, Harry it’s so good to see you, we heard that you were back in the country. What have you brought with you?” asked Andy.
On two different sides of London, two men sat in their offices, thinking about what used to be.
“Will there be anything else, Master.”
“Um yes, will you take this letter and send it off with Archimedes. It needs to be sent to the Ministry.”
“Can you even call it a relationship, Draco?” asked Harry, running his hands through his dark hair. “A relationship implies that you communicated with me, that you trusted me enough to know what was happening. But you didn’t you just left me.”
thought Draco, inner voice sounding very much like the biting voice of the man who had just disappeared.
True to his word he was only but a couple of minutes before he was in the kitchen and taking his seat at the table looking at the food that Kreacher had prepared.
“Oh,” said Harry.
“Oh, Draco, we just felt that maybe you and Harry needed a little push,” said Andromeda.
“Hmm, you’re probably right. Wait, what do you mean international?”
Harry ended up wandering aimlessly along the Thames. So lost in thought, without direction. Lost in the memories of a time when he was unafraid of getting hurt. Times of laughter and loving embraces. Getting lost in the street markets of Cairo. Squeezed in alley ways and cobbled streets surrounded by old stone buildings with their stoops and arches. Harry decided that even though he was regretful of the loss of his lover, he was even more so of the loss of a great friend. Harry knew that he would never have another friendship like the one he shared with Ron and Hermione, but they were friends on a different level now. They shared an intimacy that he couldn’t share with them.
“Thank you, Master Harry. Would Master mind if I went over to Master’s friend’s house and see if Mrs. Molly has any need for help. That is where Kreacher spends a lot of time while Master is out traveling.”
Chapter 5
“Then I will worry about that when it happens. But Harry Potter is never going to see me as anyone other than the man who made his childhood miserable and then broke his heart.”
“Really? I didn’t even know that he was gay.”
“No. It wasn’t. He just vanished, without as much as an explanation or a good bye. Just a wedding announcement in the Prophet.”
“Seriously though Fred, I think that Zabini would be lucky to have you. Send him an owl, invite him for lunch or drinks after work. From what I understand he works at St. Mungo’s as a healer,” said Harry pensively. “Anyway, I best get back out there, I am going to go grab some Fortescue’s before I head home. See you guys, I’ll owl your parents about showing up to Sunday dinner.”
“Well.. I guess if he says it’s okay,” replied Harry, convinced that either the idea would be forgotten before Scorpius could ask his father or Draco would recognize the terrible idea when it was suggested.
“And I am assuming by the fact that you have not brought him back here to meet anyone, that you have since stopped seeing one another. And by the reaction you have been showing today through your pensive thoughts it wasn’t a good break.”
“Hey,” said Draco so softly that Harry almost missed it.
“Tank you, Papa,” called Scorpius as he ran off towards his cousin.
“Scorpius, I think that’s all for today. Are you ready to go see Grand-mere and Aunt Dromeda?” he asked focusing on the little boy on his hip that had been his world the past four years since his mother, Astoria, had succumbed to the blood curse that had weakened her body so during pregnancy.
Looking at his watch Draco said, “well we have been sitting here for almost an hour and a half. The boys probably got bored waiting for us to finish, and Andy and my mother didn’t want to interrupt us, since they have been scheming to get us to talk for weeks.”
With a loud snap Draco appeared in the middle of an empty part of St. James Park. Walking along the paved path with trees towering over him with their freshly budded leaves, the late spring breeze causing Draco to stuff his hands into his pants pocket. He thought about those hot afternoons in Egypt spent in the loving company of a certain green eyed brunette. He hadn’t allowed himself to think of Harry Potter in so long that he was surprised that he really could remember how it felt, even though he shouldn’t be. They had spent a year and a half together in the Egyptian Desert. Moving from one dig site to the next. Uncovering all sorts of things, and loving the feeling of freedom that they weren’t able to enjoy while in the British Wizarding World. Harry had been right that first day, stuck in that ancient chamber surrounded by the past. He had been running away too. He didn’t want to live with the repercussions of the war. He had had enough trouble getting up the courage to go back to Hogwarts to finish his education, but his mother had been insistent. That he should have that experience to focus on school and nothing else, he was thankful for that. He couldn’t have dealt with Lucius’ declining health and the pressure that he had already been putting onto his son to make sure that the Malfoy name would live on.
