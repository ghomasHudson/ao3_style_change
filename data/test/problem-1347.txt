Yours sincerely, Minerva McGonagall."
Harry Potter was going home.
Some things I totally forgot to mention in my haste to upload the first two chapters. First, of all, I know the story of Good Omens happened more recently than Harry Potter, HOWEVER, that doesn't jive with me. SO, we're pretending Adam is older and the whole apocalypse that wasn't happened before Harry was born. Because it fits better with my Narrative.
, and that his parent’s names were only because of Draco’s.
I told him of course he couldn't keep the thing, but he made some very good arguments to the contrary and well... well now we have a pet snake apparently. He's named him Sirius, after his Godfather. He is very well behaved and very protective of Harry. So I suppose it isn't all that bad.
Crowley couldn't help but smile, patting the angel's knee before laying back down and relaxing. "He'll be alright, angel. Trust him."
Harry stared at the angel for a moment, his face scrunching up in what some might consider concentration. For a moment, Crowley feared the boy might burst into tears, or that perhaps he was soiling yet another diaper. Instead, he reached forward and smacked a hand onto Aziraphale's lips and grinned. "Ba! Ba!"
Lucius watched curiously through the glass, eyebrow raised as he turned to Severus who gave no answer.
pictures of the quidditch teams, especially the ones of James Potter hitting quaffles through goals and being hoisted onto the shoulders of the other daft gryffindors. The other boy seemed most interested in the photos of his mother, however, so Draco didn’t tend to dwell long on the other sections, instead flipping quickly to the sections with the Charms and Transfiguration clubs. Lily Potter was in many of them, her red hair standing out in the dull sepia of the photos, her smile as bright as Harry’s as she laughed silently.
Number 4 Privet Drive was… disgustingly normal. It looked identical to the other houses on the street and had absolutely nothing about it that was even remotely unique save for the number 4 painted on the mailbox. There was no car in the driveway, though Severus didn’t expect one as Petunia and her disgusting husband were no doubt still on whatever trip they’d decided to take, and all the lights in the windows were dark save for the one in the front room.
He knew he was, it was incredibly obvious, but the boy didn’t react to either of their requests and it made something anxious and worried knot in Severus’ stomach.
And Albus has allowed this? How long have they been treating his supposed golden boy like this?”
Oh and the smile that lit up the angel's lips then nearly broke Crowley. It burned his eyes to look at, so perfect and heavenly. He didn't dare look away.
Harry’s eyes grew even larger, if possible, and his smile was even brighter than Lily’s had been. “
Minerva
"Punch 'em in the face if they're mean!" Harry grinned, nodding.
Both angel and demon froze at the sound, neither sure they'd heard right. Crowley sat up straight on the couch, watching carefully as Aziraphale lifted Harry up. The boy waggled his feet and giggled as he stood on the angel's knees, fingers reaching eagerly for Aziraphale's curls.
"Both of them passed? Oh how dreadful, and their little one?"
"You could have bought the whole cart with all that money! I didn't know you were rich," Ron said, dumbfounded.
Harry nodded and smiled brightly when his dad placed a hand on his head, ruffling his hair. “
Hence, him being back at Hogwarts.
Taking the initiative as the boy’s newly appointed best friend, Draco took a step forward and bowed his head, his hands out flat to show he wasn’t holding his wand. “It’s a pleasure to meet you,” he said, trusting his godfather to translate for him since he didn’t know how to sign. “I’m Draco Malfoy and I’m going to be your new friend.”
for. He could perhaps list on only three fingers the amount of people who had ever seen him so much as
"Ssssshut up," Crowley hissed again, his forked tongue slipping between his lips and Vernon tensed in fear.
I struggled hard core on whether I wanted Harry to be in Slytherin or not, but I decided to keep him in Gryffindor for now. OOp.
“Which leads us to believe Dumbledore didn’t know,” Lucius continued with a frown, “because a parental blood tie is much stronger than an aunt or uncle. However, Dumbledore deliberately ignored the Potter’s wills, making it suspicious as to why.”
You will find enclosed your official job offerings, as well as further details into what they will include. I look forward to hearing from you.
After a moment of hesitation, Crowley plucked the boy off the broom and pulled him into a hug. Harry returned it, his little arms wrapping too-tight around Crowley's neck, though he'd never complain. "No, little one, mum isn't sad. You've only scared us is all."
Crowley pulled his glasses off and rubbed his face. "Alive it seems. Sirius is in some sort of prison, dreadful place really. Looks almost worse than hell. I don't know why. He has... he has cashed in on a favor owed." Crowley held up his arm to show off the golden design now imbedded into it. Aziraphale took his hand, fingers tracing the thread with wonder. He knew what it meant. Knew it was important if Crowley was willing to allow the spell to take hold. "The Potter boy, Harry, has been shipped off to his Aunt's house. Sirius is adamant that he not be allowed to stay."
"Yes, and I'm not happy about that," Aziraphale huffed, straightening his shoulders and glaring out the window.
Harry looked at the options with wide eyes and frowned. "I've never had any of these. I've only had muggle candies. Could I have one of each? But two of the frogs?" The woman laughed and nodded, unloading one of every treat into Harry and Ron's arms before accepting the coins Harry handed over to her.
“Oh my.”
Minerva,
Aziraphale was right behind the demon, breath coming short and hand pressed hard over his chest. "Harry, dear- I thought I'd be discorporated. Bloody heaven, Crowley. You never ought to have shown him that awful show."
"Alright Harry," Aziraphale said suddenly, turning the boy to face Crowley and leaning him up against his chest. He pointed to the surprised demon and grinned. "Now what shall we call this one, hmm? Daddy?" Crowley sneered at the word and Aziraphale chuckled. "No, I suppose not. Perhaps, dad? Or mum?"
Your friend,
Draco nodded excitedly, smiling big as his uncle got Harry’s attention to translate what Narcissa had said. Just before the silver-haired boy could turn towards the table however, Severus put a hand on his shoulder and gave the boy a grateful smile.
He reeled and struggled to regain his balance, groaning loudly in the dark space.
Crowley's grin told him everything he needed to know and Aziraphale sighed, fighting back his own smile. "Oh Crowley. You're absolutely hopeless, you know."
"Bugger," Ron sighed, shaking his head. "You gotta be careful with them. They always try to run. Who did you get?" The boy leaned over the isle between them to look as Harry pulled out a small playing card the shape of his box. "Dumbledore! That's a good one to start with, but I've got loads of him."
"Baba! Mum! Its here, its here, look!"
"Oh Crowley my dear! You had me so worried, just up and disappearing like that! Oh I thought- well I thought-" He fussed with his vest until Crowley stood and took those soft hands in his own and watched as the angel slumped slightly. "I thought hell had taken you again. It was- it was a summoning yes? I did not think many knew of your sigils."
"Crowley, my dear, are you quite alright?"
Sirius smiled, the expression a bit wobbly as he nodded, head resting on their clasped hands. "It is enough. Thank you Crowley. Thank you."
Anthony Crowley
Still didn't believe him.
Age 1-
wasn’t allowed to sit at the table next to the other boy. But Draco had just expected him to sit beside him and the adults just smiled.
Harry nodded, eagerly. "And?"
And so Harry met his first two friends.
There was a lock on the door, but his father must have understood the question because his smile turned sad again and he nodded. “
Crowley shrugged again after what felt like too long of a silence. "Yeah well, had a reason to come back this time. What, you aren't happy to see me? As I recall, you quite enjoyed my Defense Against the Dark Arts class when I taught you. What, now that you're older, you're sour about it?"
"Oh wait- watch the-"
Goodness yall are all the best! Thank you so much for all the support with this project! It's definitely a coping thing for me. She who shall not be named is ruining everything I love about this series, so I'm fixing it by writing my own. Right now I'm uploading pretty regularly, but it's been known for me to skip weeks sometimes. So please don't expect something crazy scheduled. I'm just writing when I'm inspired.
It didn't look familiar to him, so he knew at least that Hell hadn't caught up with him. But the bloody sigil he stood in wasn't a good sign either.
Aziraphale sputtered again and shook his head. "We can't darling. He was born here. If we let him out, he'll only get caught again or he won't be able to survive on his own. Come now, let's go."
And unfortunately Severus couldn’t argue that. The old headmaster had too much power, especially considering the fact that he was currently holding power over any of Harry’s proxy seats in the Wizengamot. Regardless, Lucius still held a lot of power in the ministry and he would be damned if he allowed this all to be swept under the rug, Severus was sure about that.
” in translation.
Anyway, you'll probably hear from me a lot in the future. The angel and I aren't really up to date on Wizard stuff, and you know we aren't ones ourselves. Regardless, Harry is taking the move wonderfully. We've moved into a small cottage in Tadfield near some friends. You can write to us there. Feel free to visit if you like, though Aziraphale usually appreciates a heads up before receiving guests.
My Dearest Anthony,
“It appears,” Lucius said slowly, almost carefully as his gaze drifted to their friend before returning to her, “that the Potter boy is not, in fact, James Potter’s son.”
alright. But can't you feel it, dear?" The angel shivered and tugged anxiously at his labels and began to fuss with his overcoat. "There is hatred in this house. So much of it, I'm surprised it's not seeping out of the floorboards."
“Tipsy,” her husband called, turning when the head house elf appeared beside him. “Fetch us some water and blankets. Perhaps something light to eat.”
Lucius hummed, nodding his head in agreement. “Lily Potter would be rolling over in her grave if she knew. Severus,” her husband waited patiently as their friend struggled to collect himself again, waited until he pulled away from Narcissa and turned his gaze to the man, “I cannot begin to understand how difficult this must be for you, but you must decide what your next course of action is.”
Crowley chuckled in response and shook his head. "No, little mischief, you can use magic. But we will need to set some rules, alright?"
Thanks for all the sweet words! You guys are the best!
,” he signed slowly, making sure the boy understood what he was trying to say. “
"He's not," Sirius hissed, pulling Crowley down by his wrist so they were at eye level with each other. "You must, Crowley. This is my favor. This is what I ask of you. You must do it."
Also, I do not necessarily plan on following the full plot of the books, as I don't see that it'd be very believable with Crowley and Aziraphale involved. So at a certain point the story will probably go a bit divergent from the series.
"We must get this child away from here at once," the angel decided, all but stomping up to the front door. Or he would have, if angels stomped. Which they don't. "Come dear, don't dwaddle. I'll not have poor little Harry here any longer. I simply won't allow it."
,” Narcissa hissed, scolding. “Surely this is not the time.”
Aziraphale narrowed his eyes at the demon, curiosity sparking in his eyes. "And who, may I ask, gave the stairs that idea? I know Albus to be quite the trickster, but that seems a bit dangerous even for him. And I know Minerva would never allow such a thing."
I did make a small change since the first chapter (and updated the first chapter) so that anything being said in sign language is italicized! Hopefully it makes it a little easier to read. That being said, if it ever gets too confusing, please let me know and I'll try and figure something else out!
"Yeah, okay. Okay."
'What a gentle thing you are, Harry. Your parents would be so proud.'
Hermione, as the girl would introduce herself, didn't seem as phased at Harry's 'legend' status as Ron was, but she did manage to educate them on what to expect once they'd get to Hogwarts, as she had done a
Merlin, Severus had never seen a child his age this small.)
Anthony,
brood."
Harry just grinned brightly at them and continued to the front of the room where Dumbledore stood waiting. He gave a short speech of strange words that Harry didn't quite understand, before turning it over to Professor McGonagal.
Aziraphale ended up saying yes, of course. But only after a very long conversation about Harry's plans to take care of the snake, making sure he was prepared to research how to do so (as he was not allowed to ask Crowley), and a brief conversation about where on earth Harry had learned parseltongue. ("I just heard mum doin' it and I knew it.")
WIZARDRY
Upon verification of identity Griphook had given him a file with his name scrawled beautifully on it in Lily’s exceptional handwriting. It contained Harry’s (Hadrians?) true birth certificate, the adoption papers signed by James Potter and witness Sirius Black, and a single photograph.
“Oh nonsense,” Narcissa interrupted with a scoff. “You practically live here anyway, Severus, darling. We have plenty of room for both you and the boy, you may stay as long as you both need to. Even longer if you wish. Besides,” she said with a smile, “it might do good for Draco to be here to help soothe him in a new environment. I’m sure if our suspicions are correct about how he is treated, he may not trust adults very well. I will speak with Draco about it while you two are gone, make sure he is fully aware of his duties in welcoming the boy.”
My best wishes,
"No trouble will find you, I assure you," Aziraphale shrugged. "The wards on your house will remain until the boy comes of age. Until then, I can promise you that you'll have no more contact from us or the wizarding world for the rest of your life. You will live a practical and normal life until you die."
"Nah, angel, he's fine," Crowley mumbled from where he was elegantly sprawled across the opposite seat. They had an entire room to themselves, as not many professors actually took the train to school, and the demon had no qualms in making himself comfortable. "Besides, he knows not to take anyone else's shit."
“Oh my dear, what on Gaia has happened?”
Draco quickly flipped a few pages back to show Harry the photo of his own father, back perfectly straight and poised like he was sitting for an oil portrait instead of a school photo. Draco pointed it out before straightening his own back and flattening his face in an attempt to mimic his father’s expression. Harry giggled loudly at the sight and Draco couldn’t help but feel proud that he’d managed to relax the boy so quickly.
Harrys eyes widened and he groaned. "Whaat? No! Come on, mum! Thats not fair!"
After a long moment, Crowley groaned, looking up at the ceiling. "Fine! Fine. But!" He held up a hand before Harry could celebrate. "You have to ask your Ba. If he says no, then that's your answer. And you'll have to take care of him, we won't be doing it for you. I'll talk to the school when you get your letter. Maybe they've lifted their rules on snakes since I was last there."
But his mother was patient with the questions and smiled at him when she stood fully. “We aren’t quite sure the truth of the whole matter yet, but rest assured your father will find out. All we know is that the boy is Severus’ and Lily Potter had kept it a secret from everyone but James Potter and Sirius Black. We don’t believe even Dumbledore knew.”
,” his uncle was saying, slowing down their names as he spelled them out with his fingers. Draco wasn’t daft, he knew his uncle was using sign language- he’d known a child a long time ago who couldn’t speak so she used the silent language- but that didn’t mean he knew what the hand signs meant. He made a mental note to learn.
"Yes! That's very good, my dear boy! Your pronunciation is a bit off, but if that's what you wish to call me, who am I to object?" the angel laughed. Harry, perhaps not able to help himself, laughed in return, reacting perfectly to Aziraphale's praise. He batted at Aziraphale's lips again and again, yelling 'ba! ba!' to get the angel to laugh. "Do you hear, Crowley?"
"I'm sorry I had to make you smaller, but it was the only way to fit you in my backpack," Harry was whispering. "But I can't make you bigger without my dads seeing you."
He couldn't imagine ever being happier than he was right then.
"Do you want to sit with me?" Harry asked, looking for some empty car where they could sit, but the other boy shook his head.
Loud cheers and claps rose throughout the room, filling the air around them and causing the older woman to grin through her tears as she accepted the applause.
"Fell," Harry corrected. "It's-it's Fell now, not Potter."
But Severus was determined and seeing this little boy- looking so much like his mother that the old man’s heart
"Crowley!"
Crowley reeled back slightly, eyes wide in shock. "Take care of him? Sirius, you cannot be- well serious! I cannot take care of a child! He's better off where he is-"
Harry's magic had been making little appearances here there ever since the broom incident. Nothing major, and nothing strong enough to draw the attention of the ministry, (though Aziraphale and Crowley had made sure they wouldn't notice even if it had been major enough.)
"Oh yeah! He was asleep on the train so I couldn't show him to you," Harry grinned as they lined up outside of the Great Hall doors. "He's a service animal so I get to bring him with me, that's why he wasn't ever in his case," the boy answered, shifting his scarf just enough for Sirius to poke his head through. Ron's eyes widened and he took a shocked step back, running into a curious Hermione and Harry shook his head frantically. "Oh it's okay! Mum said some people are scared of snakes. He's fine though, I promise! He's very nice!  Mum had me get him trained as a service animal, but he was already super smart, so that helped."
Harry wasn’t sure what the boy meant, his face scrunching up in confusion as he glanced back at his father. “
Not needing prompting this time, Harry waited until his father was finished signing to turn towards the woman.
“Go on.”
Stern eyes shot down to glare at the student who'd dared say her name, only to soften when she saw Harry and a barely-there smile tilted her lips. "Harry, my dear. I trust you're excited to be here. I see you've made friends already." He nodded eagerly, but she didn't continue the conversation past that, only turning to the students as a whole and raising her hands for silence. "First years! I am Professor McGonagal and I will be your Gryffindor Head of House, as well as Headmistress under Albus Dumbledore. Now listen closely, because I will not be repeating myself."
so much food before outside of Aunt Petunia’s Christmas' or the rare occasion Harry was allowed to go to the potlucks at the church. He couldn’t eat very much of course, and thankfully no one pushed him to, but it was the most delicious food he’d ever had in his life! Even tastier than the birthday cake he’d snuck before Aunt Petunia had him take the trash out on Dudley’s birthday one year.
” the boy replied, fingerspelling the names of his relatives. “
Silence fell immediately as her voice carried across the crowd effortlessly.
"We've come for the boy."
Aziraphale sighed and nodded, turning to Crowley again with a smile. "Very well. Let's talk about something different then, shall we? I have never been to Hogwarts, what shall I expect? I remember you were quite fond of the castle itself."
Somehow, Harry doubted that.
As if expecting the answer, Lucius nodded. “Good. Then you have our full support,” he answered with no hesitation. “If your headmaster has a plan for the boy that requires him to be with that family, then this is going to be a difficult road. If I recall, the Potter’s never had a public will reading, and I was not privy at the time to visit the private one. Neither were you for that matter.” Seeing her husband drop into business mode, Narcissa straightened up and waved her hand towards another chair, pulling it up close enough that she could still clutch at Severus’ hands. “As a member of the Ministry, and with you as his true father, I can escort you to fetch the boy whenever you wish. Dumbledore does not even need to be notified as whatever hold he has over the boy is likely no longer legal, if it had been at all.”
It was… very cool, if he was being honest.
"Yes mum."
Hope you're all well, tell Snapes hi for me.
"Ba!"
“We’re going shopping tomorrow,” Draco said once the potion’s master finished, looking eager to join the conversation. “We can get you books for your shelves and decorations or something. I’ll show you my room too! I have posters of all the great quidditch teams and father gave me his old Slytherin banner to hang on my wall! We’ll get you all kinds of things-“
His parents stood, Aziraphale with his chest puffed out slightly, giving a small bow, and Crowley with a lazy twist of a hand before he dropped back into his sprawl.
'The snake,' Crowley realized, smacking his forehead and sighing. He should have known Harry wouldn't leave the thing there.
So Crowley couldn't help but laugh when they were watching the telly days later and saw reruns of the news article showing a missing snake and a cage with no glass to be found.
Harry turned back to his father with wide, tear filled eyes.
And there he was.
Dear Mr. Potter-Fell,
By the time dinner came around, Harry had tears in his eyes again, but he quickly wiped them away and Draco pretended not to notice them as they stood. He did look surprised though when Draco thrust the book into his arms and told him he could keep it. He refused to take no for an answer, even as Harry asked him for the fifth time if he was
Draco figured then that maybe Harry wasn’t used to getting gifts, that by the tears in his eyes maybe he’d
I also must admit that it does not surprise me that James' boy is a natural at flying. I've no doubt he will excel in Quidditch once he is old enough. Madam Hooch is already preparing to have another Potter to train. No doubt it will be just as chaotic, especially since you've raised him. While I trust Mr. Fell to be calm and collected, I distinctly remember you only encouraging James and his friends' antics. We can only hope that Mr. Fell's influence acts as Lily did in keeping the chaos at bay. Though somehow I doubt it.
Harry shook his head quickly and for a moment Severus’ heart sunk to the pit of his stomach, but before he could let it get to him, Harry’s hands were already moving and he looked to be blinking back tears.
His temperament has always been on the harsh side, but he kept his emotions close to his chest, kept his secrets even closer. In fact there are very few who have ever seen a crack in his perfectly sculpted mask, and fewer still who he trusted to take the mask
Harry frowned, eyebrows scrunched up in question.
Harry was clapping for him as well, trying to catch the boy's eyes but unable to keep sight of him through the crowds, and then a loud "Harry Potter-Fell" rang out through the hall and all went silent. All eyes in the room turned to him, even hidden in the crowd like he was.
He mumbled a few different options before Harry began reaching his pudgy little hands out in Crowley's direction. Unable to deny the boy, the demon reached forward and snatched the boy up. Harry immediately reached for Crowley's glasses and yanked them off. He let him, as they'd learned early on that the boy had no fear towards Crowley's yellow eyes. In fact, Harry quite liked them and he giggled as they blinked down at him. Crowley couldn't help but smile in return and Harry batted at his cheek, that same look of concentration on his face for a few long minutes.
"Harmless fun," Aziraphale scoffed, shaking his head. "Those poor children."
. And considering the wills have been
"Sorry Mr. Snake," the boy said a bit sadly.
Harry gets Sorted!
. He was used to being poised, hardened. He hid his emotions behind a wall of Occlumency that even Dumbledore had never managed to break through.
And then he'd remembered how much he cared about Warlock and how much he missed the boy. He'd never admit it, though he was sure Aziraphale knew, but he did love the boy. He cared about him. Hell, he'd raised the boy more than his own mother had. Aziraphale always said Crowley would be a great parent, but he'd never believed him.
The words choked off and the woman reached up to pull him back into her arms, glancing back at her husband. “Well then? What does it say?”
Harry glared at the demon, as if challenging him. When the demon didn't budge, Harry raised a hand and smacked it on Crowley's mouth. "Muh-um!"
Draco nearly scoffed at the idea that the old coot
"Yeah, I'm Harry. My dads are teachers at Hogwarts," Harry replied, eager to make a friend.
Yours sincerely,
“Sevvy, dear,” Narcissa said quietly, gracefully dropping to her knees before the dark haired man and putting a hand on his, “you look awful dreadful. Let me take this and we’ll get you some water, yes?” He didn’t fight her as she gently pried the parchment from his fingers, noticing it wasn’t actually one letter, but two, and she dutifully ignored the stench of firewhiskey on his breath, instead ducking her head to search his face for any hint of what might have happened. She was met with blank eyes and tear tracks down both cheeks, a look she hadn’t seen on him in nearly nine years. Not since he’d lost the closest thing he’d ever had to a soulmate. With the assumption that he wouldn’t be able to speak right now, she turned to her husband and took the blanket he held out for her in exchange for the letter. With a grateful nod, she draped the heavy knit over Severus’ shoulders and grabbed a glass of water from Tipsy. “Severus, darling, I need you to drink for me, okay? Come on, head up. Just a few sips to ease my mind, yes?”
know something, but his mother seemed sure and he wasn’t about to question her of course.
Uncle Severus snorted and rolled his eyes, but he still translated the question when Harry turned to look up at him in question.
"Can I give you one? Or would you like to pick one," he'd asked after both boy and snake had sprawled out across the floor to talk.
"The Potters," Aziraphale nodded, remembering. "We sent them a bassinet a while ago yes? For their little one?"
Aziraphale pouted, slumping slightly in his chair before nodding. "Yes, yes I'm sure you're right. Still... perhaps I should go check, just in case."
"And you've got your wand and your robes?"
"You kept a baby in the cupboard?" Aziraphale finally managed to get out, voice laced with a the anger of the heavens behind it.
I've discussed your concerns with Albus in depth, and after a very, very long discussion, we've come to an agreement. With young Mr. Potter-Fell's history with the dark forces, I agree with you that as he grows older, it's possible he could be in danger. While Voldemort is gone, his followers are not, as I'm sure you are aware. It is the reason for the wards we put on his aunt and uncles home, and the reason I believe he is the safest with you and your partner, Mr. Crowley. In regards to what can be done about it, I believe Albus and I have managed to come up with a solution that I trust the two of you will accept eagerly.
Severus hummed in agreement, his eyes drawn back to both boys and watching them as Harry taught him a few signs after writing their meanings down and then pointing towards the yearbook. “I am grateful he is here,” the potion’s master said quietly, relief evident in his slouched shoulders and his soft gaze. “The boy was so eager to leave, I’m not sure he’s ever even had friends before, and Petunia’s boy was no doubt as horrid as she is. I’m sure it’s not going to be this easy always, and we’ll have our struggles, but I-“ he paused to take a deep breath, glancing up at his two best friends and smiling. “I am forever grateful that you are all here with me.”
,” a few times which always had his father smiling and backing down.
He’d never been more grateful that Lucius and Narcissa were his closest friends. That they’d stood by him no matter what and were willing to help even though he was barely functioning. Even though his Occlumency was crumbling around him.
Tell the young Mr. Potter-Fell happy birthday and that I loved the letter he wrote me last week, and thank your partner for me in translating what it said. You would think since I teach children I would understand their scribbling. But alas, in that regards I am useless. I've enclosed a reply if you'd be so kind to deliver it to the boy. I've also included a gift for his birthday, from both me and Albus.
“Yes of course,” the woman agreed, waving a hand. “I’ll see to him after dinner.” There was a brief pause where they all watched the boys, their faces softening when they saw Draco make a mockingly straight face that sent Harry into giggles. She smirked, turning to raise an eyebrow at her husband, knowing exactly what their son had shown the boy. Lucius dutifully ignored her however, and Narcissa chuckled. “Regardless, I’m sure there are other things to discuss, yes? What did Gringotts have to say? And the ministry?”
He took another moment to glance around before glancing at the door. “
he said, repeating the gesture, “so you don’t have to spell his name every time. It’s an H,” he said, showing off his pointer and middle finger,
he explained and Harry nodded. “
Lucius hummed, nodding. “Safe seems to be a loose term for it.” He turned the piece of muggle parchment towards her, this one a dirty white with little blue lines across it. The words were written messily with some sort of muggle device, some crossed out like the writer tried to reword things or had spelled something incorrectly. She couldn’t read it from her place before Severus, but she could see the large “Mr. Harry Potter” scribbled at the bottom of the page.
Crowley sighed and sat up slightly, leaning back on his elbows to look over at his partner. "Angel, you'll only embarrass him. He's fine. You'll see him again when we get there. Besides, you'll have to get used to it once he starts sleeping in the dorms. We can't always be there with him, you know. He's growing up."
"Harry, you are going to school soon. You can't just steal a pet and expect your Ba and I to watch him for you," Crowley said. He looked away from those big eyes, unused to not giving Harry what he wanted. Usually Aziraphale had to play the bad guy in their family.
Narcissa frowned, wracking her brain for some memory of Lily Potter’s family. “She’s muggle, isn’t she? Lily Evans came from a muggle family? I recall you complaining extensively of a Petunia.”
The cheers around the room were almost deafening and Harry grinned, blushing slightly as he stood from the stool and watched his robes change from black to black and red and gold. He turned to his parents, wondering if his mum would be disappointed he wasn't in Slytherin, but instead he just got proud smiles and claps.
Despite only seeing a photo of him a few hours old, Severus couldn’t deny the boy was his. His hair was wild and curly, falling messily around his chin like his mothers had when she was his age, and his big green eyes blinked up at them behind a pair of spectacles. But he had Severus’ dark hair and sharp cheekbones and his nose was long like his but it turned up in a little button just like his mother’s. As Dumbledore had told them years ago, the boy had a scar starting under his fringe and stretching across his face like branching lightning, just slightly darker than the rest of his skin. It was mostly on the left side, but parts of it reached across his nose and stretched just slightly down the side of his neck.
It sounded a bit grim to Crowley, dreadfully boring, but the Dursley's perked up at the promise and Petunia sighed, nodding slightly. "Very well. It may take me a few moments to gather his things if you'd like to wait?"
The uncharacteristic hesitance in Lucius’ words had Narcissa’s heart lurching even more and she glared at him, willing him to get on with it.
” Confusion slipped into the boy’s face, his nose scrunching up and his head tilting slightly before he pointed the hallway, signing ‘home’ again in question. But Severus only shook his head. “
But it was fine. It was okay because they were happy tears.
Again, thank you all for the support!
It's lovely to hear from you again. I know with Harry staying with Adam and you and Aziraphale taking your trip, it's been a while since we've written. I am happy to hear that Harry received his letter in such high spirits. I know he, like most children his age, have been looking forward to getting it. As requested, we've set aside a shared apartment in the teachers quarters for you and Mr. Fell to stay during the school year, however Mr. Potter-Fell will need to stay in the dorms with his classmates, same as the rest of the children. Your classrooms have also been set up as requested, though you will have three days to settle in after you arrive on the train with the students. Feel free to change up whatever you wish.
” he answered carefully, not wanting to lie to the boy. “
Without further ado, Mrs. Malfoy pushed the door open to reveal a room bigger than the Dursley’s whole living room! The walls were a simple crème with pretty silver designs at the top of them, and there was a big four poster bed draped in blacks and greens sitting diagonally in one of the corners. There was a desk and a dresser pushed up against the walls, and a few bookshelves in one corner with a chair, though the shelves were all empty. At the end of the bed was something he remembered his aunt calling a ‘fainting couch’, and there was a window on the back wall that stuck out just enough for a bench to fit up against it to sit on. Harry could just barely see the hint of a garden and maybe a lake in the darkness.
Now, it'd been quite a long time since Crowley had been summoned. Properly summoned. In fact, he had erased his sigil from all written demon texts after the apocalypse that wasn't for this very reason. In fact, only five people knew it by heart: Aziraphale, Warlock, Adam, Ananthema, and a friend he hadn't heard from in over a decade.
"Ah! There's my boy! Go on, you've got it," Aziraphale cheered, nodding eagerly to the boy. "Go on, say Papa."
at the fact that Harry had named them
“She is writing to tell Severus of Hadrian’s true parentage and that she’s left some documents with the goblins in case anything happens to her and Potter. The boy has written, claiming he too received a letter telling him about Severus.” Lucius frowned down at the dirty page, surprisingly unbothered to touch it as he re-read the words. “He writes that his mother told him to contact Severus if he ever needed help and-“
The angel hummed, nodding slightly as he glanced off to the wall, Crowley's hand still gently in his. "We are quite different from wizards, but it would be a shame for a young boy of his power to be in a home where he isn't taught to properly use it."
"With rules," Aziraphale reminded him. "We will need to practice your flying, and you are not to jump from anything anymore. Understood?"
In regards to our previous inquiry about Harry's school letter in the coming years, I know both Crowley and I had quite a lot of questions about what we should be prepared for when Harry turns eleven. I'm sure it's a lot of information, so I thought perhaps you might join us for a spot of tea sometime next week to discuss it. I am aware that Crowley and I are not muggles nor wizards, so we wanted to be sure what the rules are upon attending events, visiting Hogsmede, and so on. Crowley mentioned it wouldn't be an issue, as he was a teacher at Hogwarts for some time, however that was before anyone knew our true nature. I'd like to be sure of everything before hand, just in case.
"Angel, he'll do it when he's ready," Crowley grumbled from where he rested on the couch. Aziraphale was sat in the arm chair across from him, Harry propped up excitedly in his lap. They had only had the boy for a handful of months, but the angel had taken to him splendidly and Harry seemed all too comfortable with the both of them. As if there was no other option. Which, he supposed there wasn't really.
Grim and equally upset, Griphook nodded. “Indeed. There was little the goblins could do at the time with the Ministry backing his decisions. However we will of course assist in correcting this grievous mistake once Mister Potter nee Prince completes his own inheritance test and we are able to verify his identity. As stated, this would be best to do as soon as possible in order to get things moving along to their correct holders.”
"Yes,  only it appears right now he is being chased by the snitch instead of the other way around."
His partner shrugged, pulling off his apron as he walked over to sit on the arm of the chair. "I dunno angel. His birthday technically isn't for a few more hours."
Lucius sighed and rolled his eyes, telling Severus that no doubt the ministry business was going to be messy, but he didn’t interrupt as his friend spoke.
of a doorbell that he’d expected, a bright red light lit up on the inside of the foyer, flickering a few times before stopping.
And then Harry had fallen right into his life.
"Mmmm," Harry grumbled, sounding almost contemplative if he wasn't barely under two. Crowley let him think, ever patient for whatever wisdom the child would bestow upon him, until finally Harry let out a very serious, "Muh!"
"And we'll be picking up a few classes there to teach. Ill be teaching Magical History and Crowley will be teaching Herbology. We aren't wizards you see, so we are a bit limited on classes. But I think they work very well."
The boy swallowed around a lump that suddenly formed in his throat at the attention. Not used to the eyes on him. He took a few steps forward, reaching up to rub at the scar that trailed down the side of his face as his nerves set in. He could feel Sirius weighing heavy on his shoulders and it calmed him slightly as he walked up the short stairs towards the stool. He glanced towards his parents who gave him smiles and soft, encouraging nods.
he assured the boy.
Next he knew he was back in the bookshop, knelt on it's clean floors. Aziraphale was pacing back and forth before him, startled at his sudden appearance.
"Yeah well... maybe pay more attention next time," he said, but there was no heat in his words as he adjusted his robes.
Hi everyone! I'm glad everyone is liking this so far!
Harry wasn't sure if he had a choice in the matter, but Hermione seemed to have a say in where she ended up, so maybe he did too. "My mum was a Slytherin professor," he told the hat quietly, not sure if the others would hear him or not. "But my friends are in Gryffindor. If- if it matters."
"Well, it has been quite a while since we've been in Scotland. And your mum taught at Hogwarts when James was your age. So we had a talk with Dumbledore."
"You have freed me, given me a chance at something better. I think it only polite for you to choose. I have no preference either way, young master."
"You told me of the other one," Sirius argued, as if reading the man's thoughts. "The Warlock boy. You raised him, you can raise Harry."
“Thank you, Draco. This was a thoughtful gift.”
Harry nodded, snuggling down under the covers, more content than he’d been in… well ever, he figured. He grunted when the lights turned off, drawing his father’s attention just before the door shut.
"Welcome back students, thank you Headmaster for the lovely speech. Now, before we get into the sorting ceremony, we do have a few announcements. It is with great honor and respect that we must bid farewell to our Madam Sprout." There was a series of gasps and 'no!'s as the short, stout woman stood up from the table and smiled, waving to the students. "She will be remaining through the first semester to help our new Herbology  professor settle in, and I'm sure she'll be sad to leave everyone here, but we are honored by her time here and wish her all the best."
“Hello, we are looking for a Mister Harry Potter,” Lucius said, though the boy’s eyes didn’t leave Severus’.
"Anything from the trolley dears," the woman asked sweetly, smiling down at them.
She wasn’t sure how conscious he was of her words, but he lifted his head regardless, eyes staring through her as she placed the glass in his hands and helped him raise it. She didn’t let up until he’d at least drank half of the glass, slightly surprised when he then dropped his head onto her shoulder and let out a heavy, broken breath.
Aziraphale sputtered behind him but Crowley just snorted, kneeling down beside his son.
Harrys smile was bright enough to outmatch the sun, and Crowley couldn't help but smile back as the boy hugged him as tight as his little arms could manage, thanking him greatly.
Also a note, don't worry about the backstory with Lily and Severus and timelines and such. I'll explain things as the story goes along, but for now just go with the flow! (Though I will be changing up a few things from the canon obviously to better fit my story.)
Age 11-
Crowley shrugged, unconcerned. "Dumbledore doesn't tell me what to do." There was a long silence after that as they sat through a few more students. After a while, Crowley sighed and looked over at the potions master again. "Say what you want, Severus. You know I hate it when you brood."
"My letter! My letter!" He cried, holding up a thick envelope and waving it around. Aziraphale hummed, holding a hand out for it. Harry bounded over to him, pointing at the thick seal. "See? Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!"
Harry taught him the alphabet first since he wasn’t allowed paper at the table, and Draco took to it immediately, only forgetting a few letters the first few times. Then Harry taught him the signs for all of the foods, taking his time after he was finished eating to spell them out for him before repeating it again in sign language. On more difficult names or explanations, his dad would translate, but for the most part Draco was happy to learn without assistance. Something about it being easier to remember if he was forced to pay attention.
Crowley nodded, trying to hide the pain this situation brought him. He was a demon for badness sake, he should be mourning the lives of mortals. "The Potters are dead it seems, I'm not sure how. I haven't looked. Sirius Black, James' friend, was the one who summoned me," the demon sighed, slumping back against the couch like a particularly upset serpent.
Harry was actually happy to teach Draco. He learned quite a few words while they were flipping through the yearbook such as “mom and dad”, “school”, “magic”, and “student”. He also learned “pretty” in regards to Harry’s mom and “grumpy” in regards to Severus. The other boy was absolutely fascinated with the moving pictures, but especially the ones of his parents. He’d stopped to stare for a long time when they’d reached the seventh year individual photos, staring at his mother’s image as she winked smartly at the camera. James Potter was a few pages past, his cocky smirk and wild hair nothing like Harry’s. How anyone thought the boy was Potter’s, Draco would never know. He also spent a bit of time on Severus’ photo, amused at the shaggy black hair and the dead looking eyes.
Dinner had been… interesting to say the least.
Severus sighed and shook his head. “Not yet. I wanted him to settle just a bit before thrusting everything at him. I’ll explain it after dinner, though I’m not sure how much of it he will understand.”
We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.
Minerva
Harry frowned, head cocking to the side. "Tell me what?"
"No, you don't get it," Ron said, moving to the front of his seat excitedly. "You're the boy who lived! We grew up on stories about you! The greatest wizard in the world! You defeated the dark lord when you were just a baby! That's so cool! Wow, I can't believe Harry Potter- uh- sorry, Harry Fell, is sitting with me on his way to Hogwarts! Here! Do you want a chocolate frog? They have cards inside to collect! I got Merlin!"
The stern tone of her husband’s voice and the straightness of his spine began to draw Severus back into himself, and she could see that he was grateful for something stable and direct to focus on, no doubt wondering himself what his next steps needed to be.
(See the end of the chapter for
and force us to raise one of your little monsters, and out of the kindness of our hearts, we accept, and now you've come here and assaulted us in our own home! I absolutely refuse to allow this any further! We have had enough of your-"
"Says the angel who is a literal soldier of god," the demon laughed, rolling his eyes behind his glasses. "And come on, angel, Harry knows he isn't supposed to hit anyone unless he has to. He's a good kid. I'm sure he's already made all kinds of friends. And if he hasn't, we'd probably know about it by now."
and no more. You will not contact us for more. Well honestly you wouldn't be able to even if you tried. If anyone contacts you in regards to Harry, you'll give them this card and they may contact us," the angel said sternly, handing a pristine white card to the red faced Vernon. It simply read 'Mr. A. Z. Fell' and a phone number. "As promised, the wards around your home will remain until Harry turns 18. Beyond that, you have no protection. If you leave this home, you will have no protection. Goodbye."
"James and Lily," Sirius choked, tears once again welling up in his eyes. Something violent shook through the wizard and his head shot up, eyes finding the door to the cell. "I don't have time. You have to promise me, Anthony," he said, turning back towards the demon with desperation in his eyes. "James and Lily, they're gone. They're gone and Harry has no one left," he choked, fingers gripping tight enough to bruise if Crowley was human. "I heard- I heard they've sent Harry off to his aunt's but- but they're cruel people, Anthony, absolutely horrid. You have to- you have to get him. You have to take care of him, until he's old enough. Please."
Aziraphale waited for the demon to continue, but when he didn't the angel began to connect the dots himself, eyes widening and back straightening. "Oh. Really? Us?"
"The boy?" Petunia frowned. "But- but you've only just dropped him off!"
“No.”
Age 10-
"Not exactly."
"Papa, go on say it, Harry. Say Papa."
The red haired boy grinned big and nodded, waving to the seat in front of him. There was chocolate on his fingers, Harry noticed, and he finished swallowing whatever he was eating as Harry put his travel trunk on the rack above the seats.
"They told us he'd be protected here," Petunia interrupted, fingers clutched tightly in her own lap as she looked at them. "The letter that was left with him said James and Lily were murdered and that whoever it was would try to come after Harry as well. But he'd be protected here. Something about magic around our street."
"Your mum is a boy?" Ron asked curiously, shoving a handful of jelly beans in his mouth.
Aziraphale snapped his fingers, popping the seal perfectly, and opened the letter. He cleared his throat, hands searching his head for his glasses. Harry groaned and handed them to him impatiently and Aziraphale chuckled. "Ah, thank you darling. Let's see.
The boy frowned, glaring at Severus’ lips for a moment before grunting and grabbing at his hand. He tugged the potions master until the two men were following him into the house and living room, the door shutting behind them. Once he was satisfied with their destination, he snatched a notebook from the table and scribbled something on it before he all but shoved it in Severus’ face.
“If you wish, I will act as your lawyer in the case,” Lucius offered gracefully. “We will need to visit Gringotts to examine the wills and whatever the Potters have left the boy, as well as get to the bottom of what happened to the wills in the first place if the boy was placed with Petunia Evans. I doubt very much that it would have been Lily’s first choice of guardian for the boy, especially after you turned back to Dumbledore’s side once the war was over. You should have been notified as soon as possible.” Humming, Lucius waved a hand and one of their family lock boxes appeared in his lap where he placed both letters and magically sealed them. “I will keep these as evidence for now if you don’t mind, but you are happy to them whenever you wish. No doubt the goblins will require an inheritance test for the boy, but we will need to do one for you as well upon opening the investigation. Without it, the goblins will not allow you access to any information on the boy or his accounts.”
Harry frowned, thinking about it for a long moment before nodding. He remembered it vaguely, a long time ago. Big white rooms, a man in a blue uniform. Lots and lots of medicine. “
He was sure this was going to be a great friendship.
A spike of pain shot through the man’s heart at the question and he could tell Lucius knew what the boy was asking even if he didn’t technically know of the meaning behind the fingers pressing to the boy’s lips. It wasn’t hard to figure out it meant ‘food’.
Severus jolted slightly in surprise, eyes widening and fingers twisting through Narcissa’s so tightly she was sure she might have bruises forming. “So quickly?”
"Oh angel... you're perfect you know? Completely perfect."
Lucius stepped forward, dropping a heavy hand on his friend’s shoulder, thumb brushing the side of his neck, and smiling at the man. “Severus, you are family. Malfoy’s always take care of family. Now, go get freshened up. I will have Tipsy bring you a potion to rid you of the alcohol and fetch you when I am ready. We will leave upon the hour.”
A few more people went after that. A scared looking boy clutching a toad who got put in Gryffindor. An adorable blonde with funny glasses that got sorted into Ravenclaw. And then there was the blonde boy - Draco Malfoy, as the professor called.
So when the dark haired boy turned back to him, trying desperately to keep his tears from spilling over, he nodded.
"Harry," the demon said, pushing the door open and crossing his arms. The boy squeaked, pushing something quickly under his pillow before turning to look at Crowley.
Please give Mr. Fell my greetings and keep me updated on how young Mr. Potter is doing.
And Harry… Harry looked like he was shell shocked to be honest. Like this had never once been an option he thought he had when he’d written that letter to Severus. His big, green eyes- Lily’s eyes- were wide as dinner plates and there was a sudden hesitance that graced his features, an uncertainness in the way he wrung his fingers together and shifted his feet in front of them.
They didn't have time to talk this out, Crowley knew that. This was a decision they were just going to have to make. But still... Crowley with a child?
Still, his magic had been limited to floating on his broom, making his toys move on their own, and the occasional magical tossing of items when he threw a fit. Nothing quite as big as making an entire glass enclosure disappear.
In regards to your most recent letter and questions, I'll answer them in the order in which you asked. First and foremost, we do ask that you purchase all items through Diagon Alley instead of 'creating' them through your miracles. It's very important for a wizard to choose their own wand, and first years are required very specific items to start off with. He will also need to visit with Madam Malkin to get his robes fitted. While I'm sure you could create all of these things perfectly well, most children are very excited about the experience and it would give young Harry a good introduction to the wizarding world, as I know he has not visited before.
Congratulations,
"By mum! By Ba!" Harry called as he rushed towards the train, his travel case in hand and a smile on his face. He was eager to get on and find somewhere to sit, determined to make friends so his parents wouldn't worry anymore-
"Ah, a Potter, eh? Interesting. Been quite a while since I've had such a challenge in store. You're quite the pickle aren't you?" The hat asked, humming to itself. "You've got the power and the ambition for Slytherin, but the heart of a Gryffindor. Quite tricky. I'm sure you would excel in both houses no matter what I choose."
"Harry no!"
His friend bobbed his head and waved a hand. “Latricia Horntail has been Draco’s tutor since he was an infant. She’ll no doubt be able to catch Harry up in time for Hogwarts. And Draco will help, I’m sure of it.”
“They had him sleeping in a cupboard,” Severus said quietly, careful to keep his anger in check as to not draw the boy’s attention. Narcissa looked shocked, like she almost didn’t believe him but when her husband didn’t contradict his statement, her face turned red with anger. “The room was barely big enough for him and all he had was a mattress on the ground and a piece of parchment on the wall that said “Harry’s Room”. It was under the stairs, for Merlin’s sake,” he growled, fists clenching in his lap.
,” Harry wrote on a spare piece of parchment, letting Draco read it before he signed it as well.
he was allowed to sit at the table next to Draco.
"No more mag-ick," Harry said with a stern nod.
,” he said, smiling softly at the boy like he did whenever he smiled at Draco. “
Perhaps he was getting ahead of himself.
to be. Still, one thing had been bothering him since his mother had interrupted his library time. “I didn’t know Uncle Severus had a son,” he frowned, holding out his hands for his mother to straighten his sleeves even though they were perfect. “And if he’s Uncle Severus’ son, why is his name Harry
with it- standing in the middle of an ugly, muggle living room dressed in nothing but rags, gave him a warm, protective sort of feeling that he hadn’t felt since Lily Evans.
"And Sirius is tucked up under your scarf right?"
“I think it did,” Severus smiled, patting his shoulder once more before pulling away. “Harry knows how to write and read, so if you have trouble communicating with him, you may do it that way.”
"Yeah," Harry agreed. "I plan to make that up to you, though." And with those words, he said a quick prayer before gingerly pressing his lips to Draco's. He had barely allowed himself to hope that Draco would kiss him back, but he had been mostly sure that he was going to be immediately hexed.
"It's fine," Harry tried to shrug casually but knew the jerky movement had been nowhere near casual. "None of those things are your fault, Malfoy."
"So what does this make us?" the blond wondered aloud. Were they boyfriends? Lovers? Fuck buddies? Did Potter want them to remain a secret? Draco wouldn't blame him if he did. Sometimes he wished he could be kept a secret from himself.
Harry and Draco exchanged another glance. "That's not necessarily true," Harry shrugged. "They could have moved him there right after we left and then joined up with one of the groups immediately after. They could have killed him in the lounge and then moved to another room. That wouldn't have been that difficult since the lounge has three exits. It connects to the entrance hall, the main hall, and the room next to it. Most of the rooms in the main hall are interconnected, so they could have moved quickly through the rooms to get ahead of us. In theory, they could even have had Terry in the very next room and moved him into the lounge immediately after we left it." He shook his head. "We don't have any clear answers."
"I love your hair like this," Harry mumbled into the other boy's mouth, and he felt Malfoy smile.
"Oi, I'm scary!" Weasley protested, frowning as he was met with laughter.
"Just shut UP!" Everything else Harry had been about to say was cut off by Draco launching himself at him. As a pair of lips suddenly attached themselves to his own, Harry gasped in shock. Two hands tangled themselves in his hair, tightening painfully and tugging him closer. Draco bit Harry's bottom lip, his tongue sliding into Harry's mouth when the brunet made a noise of surprise. The shock quickly wore off enough for him to wrap his arms around the blond as he responded to the passion of the kiss. It was angry, demanding, open-mouthed, rough. Malfoy tugged on the thick black strands of hair caught between his fingers, pulling sharply and forcing Harry's head to tilt at an angle so Draco could deepen the kiss.
Hermione sighed again. "Yes, Harry, that staircase. They said they had been wandering around and were trying to find the rest of us, although why they didn't go into the lounge to look is a mystery to me."
"Educated people," Draco sniffed.
Both men shook their heads.
"Well, I don't really know too much about his past, but I'm certain he can hardly be blamed for that lack of trust. Based on what I am able to infer about his upbringing, I'm sure his first instinct in any sort of stressful situation is to keep everything bottled up inside. From what I've seen, he does seem the type to find confiding in others a challenge. What if he didn't do it out of spite or maliciousness, but simply because it's his nature and he doesn't know any better? Most people don't know how to go against their natures—most people don't even realize that their natures are anything to go against. People don't often think about things like that when making decisions driven by such strong emotion."
Only one chapter left on this little angst-filled journey of ours!
"What, then?" Harry asked, unsure how to name any of the dozens of emotions howling fiercely throughout him, clamoring loudly enough to nearly drown out the beating of his hammering heart or the deafening rush of blood in his ears. "What do you want, Draco?"
Harry could only gape. "She's not horrid," he finally insisted. "And it's not like I can just
Harry hesitated, unsure what he should share with Draco.
"I can't believe you actually have a date with Potter," Pansy said for what must surely have been the sixteen-billionth time that week; Draco wished he had thought to keep track.
"Do you promise?" she asked, speaking to Harry. She was looking into his eyes without blinking, and Harry tried not to look away. "Do you promise we'll be okay?"
Although, considering the fact that they belonged to two club members, he supposed they really didn't have the luxury of that option.
"No," Malfoy answered, and Harry frowned and began to rethink enjoying the flattery—until the blond continued speaking. "I think
"I'll make sure we're prepared for an attack," Seek continued, still sounding far too calm about the situation. "I'll make sure they aren't able to catch us by surprise. And I know you're scared, Draco. But I can't just back out of this fight. They're coming for me, they're coming for my brothers. But I promise you, that'll be the last mistake those bastards make." There was something grim in his voice, a quiet sort of violence, and Draco knew that Seek
Leaning back, he heard the leather chair he was sat in creak as he gazed at the onyx vase of dried flowers next to his elbow on the desk, a sort of pointed white petal that Harry was unsure of the name of. Nearby, a set of dusty bloodred drapes hung heavy and silent where they framed the unreachable outside world. A black metal bookstand stood before the window, holding a large tome of what appeared to be ancient wizarding bloodlines, and the sight made Harry's stomach clench in discomfort. The entire room made Harry want to shy away as he thought of young Draco being sat before the large imposing desk in silence as he listened to his father recite wizarding bloodlines between lectures about what it meant to be a Malfoy.
who did this to him, it was
"Harry."
Sighing, he pulled back his curtains to discover bright sunlight pouring into the empty room. Checking the time, he was surprised to see that breakfast had long ended and that the first class of the day was nearly over.
Nott snorted a laugh and Harry couldn't help but look at him in surprise. He wasn't sure if he had ever heard Nott laugh before. He wasn't sure if he had ever really seen Nott express amusement before. Or any sort of emotion, come to think of it. "I'm sure if he ever one day finds a girl with enough self-loathing to actually let him touch her, he'll be entire kilometers less angry."
"You really like me?" Draco still wasn't sure if he could believe it, but Potter seemed so embarrassed and sincere that it must be true.
"Not a guard dog," Harry shook his head. "Also, I thought I was meant to be an honorary Slytherin now."
"Erm…" Draco took a deep breath. "I couldn't sleep. And I…I can't stop thinking about you. Which makes sense, I suppose, since I'm in your house, wearing your clothes and sleeping in the room next to you, and everything…" he swallowed. "But…I can't sleep. And I—I was wondering if…you know…if I could…"
He needed space to think everything through, to be able to just
about it? He was
"Are you saying," Wescott's voice startled Harry from his thoughts, "that the two of you, even for the sake of his own life, are not able to put a schoolyard rivalry from years ago aside? Not even in the recent face of everything that has been happening over the past several months?"
to find your answers?!" For a moment, Harry couldn't breathe through the force of his rage. Draco would rather turn to some shady criminal that he met up with in pubs and that he most likely barely knew in order to find his answers rather than trust in Harry? And as Harry remembered how desperately he had sought those very same answers, desperate to find any scrap of information he could for Draco, desperate for
, even when certain sexy blokes with black hair had pressed their hand flat against Draco's magnificent erection—his proud manly Malfoy erection—and began to rub their palm against the bulge.
"Well, I'm going with you," Potter said immediately, folding his arms and narrowing his eyes in challenge as though daring Draco to argue, which was exactly what the blond intended to do.
"At least I'm worth helping," Smith glared. "Unlike them."
But the thought made his heart pound even harder as a smile crossed his face.
At the dramatic statement, Pansy rolled her eyes again and Draco considered flicking ink on her, ultimately deciding not to risk it just in case it landed on a library book and Madam Pince really did crucify him right there in the library as an example to all other would-be book-defilers, all of whom were worse than the Dark Lord in her eyes.
"Draco," Harry started, sounding uncertain, but Draco interrupted before he had the chance to speak.
"Harry…" Draco whispered, feeling his eyes prickle hotly. "Harry, I…"
Draco gritted his teeth, hiding his face in Fenrir's chest and clenching his eyes shut to stop the storm of emotion that wanted to escape. God, the man was infuriating. How long had Draco been blind to the type of person Fenrir Greyback really was?
A wide, almost wonderous smile lit up Potter's face. "Okay," he said softly. "Yeah, let's do that. I-I mean, I'd like to do that. Together. Er, the two of us."
"And none of you have left since?" Harry pressed. "You've all been here the entire time together?"
Blaise scoffed as Weasley mouthed "Bosom-less twats?" to Potter.
"A Muggle illusionist," Harry explained, staring at the far wall. "They're Muggles who figure out ways to make it seem like they have magic, sort of by tricking people into believing they can do things like levitate or appear across the room in the blink of an eye or survive being stabbed by swords and stuff. But the tricks are always so incredible and so clever and I had always been so fascinated with them when I was younger, the way they seemed able to just change whatever they wanted about the world around them...just like that, in the blink of an eye…"
Draco had only taken two steps into the room before he paused. He was unsure of what to do—he did not want to sit next to Blaise, but he did not want the good-looking man to sit next to Potter, either. Daphne had turned in her seat to smile at Potter and Blaise was eyeing Draco in a way that made the blond flush and glare.
Frowning, Potter played with a torn bit of parchment, crumpling it up and rolling it into a ball. "Is he really upset?"
And Draco did.
"Are you objecting, Draco?" Harry raised one eyebrow at him.
"Feeling healed yet?" Weasley drawled sarcastically, and Draco glared at him as best he could through watery eyes.
"Fuck," Hermione breathed, glancing around cautiously before rattling off a series of detection spells.
The thought twisted Harry's insides even tighter.
you're you that I'm with you."
By the time they returned to the room, Pansy was tucked snugly in Blaise's bed, dark hair spilling across his pillow. Blaise had Transfigured himself a narrow mattress on the floor and already appeared to be falling asleep, his breathing becoming slow and even. Harry and Draco crossed the room as gracefully as they could, hitting walls and furniture but thankfully managing to avoid stepping on anybody.
"Mean what?" he asked in confusion.
"I've missed you, Draco," he said in a low voice, staring Draco directly in the eye without blinking. "More than I'm sure you believe possible of me. I know after everything I've done you don't really believe me capable of having genuine feelings for another person. I know you don't think me capable of falling in love," his voice was soft, his dark eyes were large and sad, and Draco could not look away as more pretty words continued to pour from the man. "But I really have missed you. So much, Draco, you have no idea. God, I love you. Just give me the chance to show you." And with that, he leaned forward to press his lips to Draco's stunned mouth.
"Malfoy, pretentious?" Dean asked sarcastically, pretending to sound shocked. "When did that start happening?"
one isn't allowed on the pitch anymore," she stabbed a finger in Harry's direction, "and we lost most of our team to graduation or the fucking ban, as well as our subs."
"Mmm, sounds lovely." I cross the room and sit as he hurries to the kitchen to open the wine. By the time he returns with two glasses I have served the both of us salad and smile gratefully as I accept my glass.
Draco's smile widened as he hummed, shifting closer into Harry's touch. "I don't think I've ever met a more thoughtful man than you, you know. So far, I've been impressed no matter what you do, Seek, you don't even need to try."
And with that the Patronus faded away, leaving a ringing silence behind in its disappearance. Triggs was dead? Harry had barely known Triggs—the man had only been an Auror for a few months. He was still new, he should never have been assigned to guard Greengrass, the killer was dangerous! But Harry remembered that he and Ron had been assigned to cases just as risky before they had even officially become Aurors.
"I'm just telling him what the likely outcome is of pursuing this particular plan," Pansy said with an unrepentant shrug. "A lot of misguided people like to think that men, especially the sweet men, are romantic and gentle and adoring and would love nothing more than to wait until their wedding night to finally be intimate with their beloved," she sniggered, "but I can tell you for a fact that most men are just dirty perverts who literally want nothing in this world more than getting their cocks sucked. Even heroic Gryffindors want their heroic cocks sucked, Draco."
"Give it some time," Blaise shrugged. "Best friends fight. And then we get over it and make up. You're one of the Slytherins, Harry, and you can't get rid of us so easily."
"But I have no family left," Draco pointed out. "I mean, I have an aunt somewhere and a cousin, but I don't know where or even who they are."
"—the scar!"
Neither of them spoke for several minutes. "Thank you, Luna," he finally said in a quiet voice, looking her in the eye. "I'm glad that I'm lucky enough to have you for a friend."
"What are you doing here?" Harry asked stupidly, glancing around as if his surroundings might answer the question for him. "Last I heard, you'd just been traded to the Kestrels."
With a smile, Harry pulled off completely as he withdrew his fingers, climbing up Draco's body to collapse at his side with a happy expression. "God," he said, ignoring the sticky sweat and the sticky mess and wrapping himself around Draco, "that was incredible. Fuck, you're so incredible, Draco."
stop whinging on and on about Potter?"
The tips of Weasley's ears turned red. "Yeah,
Extra lil' p.p.s. first—I also wanna explain real quick about Caelix and his lil' tantrum at the safehouse and how it didn't really amount to much since he really was innocent the whole time. That conversation was in the story for several reasons, the first being that it made him look like a shady suspicious douchebag despite his innocence, and I do so love red herrings and the writing of them! They're fun and I like them, so there. The second reason was that I wanted something to induce Harry's possessive side and what better than a scorned almost-lover? The third was to subtly show that people really do tend to lump all the Slytherins together in one group, even those who didn't go to Hogwarts. I just wanted to give Daphne's reasonings a little more validity. The fourth reason—and this really is the main reason—was that I needed Caelix to show a darker, more inexcusable, unforgivable side of himself. I wanted to show him in a light where, like Blaise, the feelings were real but they were ultimately overshadowed by extreme dickery. I didn't want Harry, Draco, and Blaise to be the only ones who regretted saying nasty things to one another, and I didn't want Caelix to be some push-over who would just accept his rejection with polite grace and still then help Harry out with his confusion and hurt over Draco. That just verges on obscenely good-spirited and grossly kind at that point. Eh, the kid just needed a bit more edge, even if he was a total dick about it. At the same time, I couldn't invent him just for the sake of his pain, so in the end, I gave him Dean, even though I had never really planned on that.
"Did he," Hermione mused, voice flat as she continued to scribble across the pages of her notepad, and Harry wondered what she was writing.
Harry shook himself back into the moment; he had to get Draco to believe him. "Nothing happened. Nothing is going to happen," he vowed in a low voice. "Even if Oliver does want more than friendship, I don't. I don't want anyone but you, Draco. Ever. I love you and we're going to be together so I'm sorry because I'm never leaving. I'll never feel even close to what I feel for you for anyone else. Nobody else matters but you. You're the only person I notice."
Then it was Harry's turn to clasp the lion necklace around Draco's throat with a kiss and everything was perfect.
"Just for you, I shall try my hardest not to," Draco agreed.
"Oh yes!" Her eyes sparkled as she clapped her hands together. "That was most clever, was it not?" Spinning around, she turned to address Goyle. "Would you like to explain things, darling, or shall I?"
Neville nodded and Harry continued. "Zabini showed up last night." At Neville's raised eyebrows, Harry shrugged. "Yeah, out of nowhere. Nobody knows where he's been or what he's been doing. Malfoy hadn't seen him in months before yesterday."
The corners of her mouth twitched as she turned to Harry. "He's right, Harry. Speak to Draco before Zabini can use the situation to his advantage, because you know he will."
Satisfied, Draco lay back and smiled to himself as he felt a gentle cleaning charm tingle over his skin. Harry settled back down next to him, running his fingers up and down Draco's torso.
Looking around at what was left of his surroundings, he frowned. Not even the wallpaper had survived. It appeared as though Pibby was going to have to seal that room off, as well.
Damn. Draco knew for a fact that he was talking absolute bollocks and even he almost believed himself. Pride rushed through him as he smugly decided what a golden answer that really had been—it certainly made him sound like a very modern, very accepting sort of bloke.
yourself?!" Harry was not sure if he could remember ever feeling so angry. What did Draco think he was playing at?!
"Morning, Draco," Potter panted, placing his hands on his hips as he tried to catch his breath from the climb upstairs.
"You don't need to, it's already implied in everything you say."
Without warning, the world suddenly started moving, everything spinning sickeningly as Harry felt something hard hit his back. When the world stopped twirling and everything fell still, Harry looked up to realize that Malfoy had grabbed him by the shoulders and spun him around, slamming him up against the stone wall of the corridor and pinning his arms tightly to his sides.
"Are you okay?" he asked softly, somehow resisting the urge to comb his fingers through Draco's hair or pull him in for a hug. A sudden desperation gripped him as he hoped that Malfoy would not be angry at him for interfering so publicly.
Draco snorted softly. "Git."
"What?" Caelix asked curiously.
Harry looked torn, yanking harder at the feathers on his quill until there were whole clumps missing.
"So you say," Smith spat. "Why the hell do you think we would we ever just trust the word of a Slytherin?"
"Harry?" the redhead asked weakly.
of a dwarf wearing wings and carrying a damned harp, he was leaving that castle forever, classes be damned.
Glancing over at Potter, he found the man staring at him and Weasley in astonishment, as though unable to comprehend the sight of the two of them trading barbs in a somewhat friendly manner, making Draco cringe internally. It wasn't possible that he was becoming friends with a
"Ah yes, the mysterious Severus Snape," Caelix sighed. "I do so wish I had met the man, from what I've heard from you and Ronald. Makes me wish I had gone to Hogwarts." His voice turned wistful.
"Only pretty sure? How am I meant to be certain if you're not even certain?"
"It's not like we'll have to cook every single meal," Hermione said. "We're going to take it in shifts until we can figure out a way out of here. For now, I think we should keep it simple. I'm not sure how much people are really going to want to eat after what happened earlier this morning."
"Oooh, ten points to Draco for that one!" Pansy cackled.
"Stay away from her minge, Pansy," Blaise said with a grin as he followed behind. "That minge is taken."
"No, that's not what that was," Harry said cautiously. He wanted to be perfectly, unarguably clear with the other boy—no more misunderstandings. He had already revealed an embarrassing amount the previous day, it couldn't hurt his pride any more to try to see this through. As a Gryffindor, Harry was left with no choice but to square his jaw and face this the same way he faced everything else in his life—head-on.
"What about you?" the man asked, taking a step closer, until he was only inches from Draco and Draco was having trouble breathing. Lord, he was standing so close that Draco could smell him—a dark, leathery sort of scent that reminded Draco of pine trees and rain, fresh earth and melting chocolate. It was definitely not a bad smell, and Draco inhaled as subtly as he could. Christ, the man smelled amazing.
"So you don't have anything else planned?" Pansy wondered, nudging Draco back out of the way of the mirror so she could fiddle with her bangs.
Ravenclaw girl. Not
Still smiling, Draco released him completely, using the same hand to stroke himself just as agonizingly slowly, smoothing the oil over himself until his entire cock was slick and gleaming. Leaning forward, Draco released his shaft in order to drape himself over the Auror once more, like pale, flowing silk, whispering the man's name before kissing him deeply, a slow, nerve-melting kiss, one that made Draco's head spin. Behind every press of their lips and slide of their tongues was a silent vow, promising things that Draco would never dare have the courage to say aloud, despite an overwhelming part of himself longing to spout pretty words of that magnitude to the man. Somehow, Potter managed to make Draco feel torn in two, half of himself feeling bold, reckless and brave, whilst the other half felt downright terrified. It was dizzying and overwhelming and confusing and frightening and Draco loved the feeling.
"What?" Ron asked incredulously. "Why would you worry more? That would mean we found the one doing this! That would be a good thing, Hermione!"
. I just—I never meant—I'm really sorry," he trailed off in a whisper, feeling a burning in his throat. He found that he was unable to look the other man in the eye, and settled instead for speaking to the ground beneath the feet of the familiar scruffy shoes he would recognize anywhere.
She shrugged. "Haven't heard it today, at least."
"What do
Remaining just as silent, Harry reached out to take his hand, squeezing it gently and feeling relieved when Draco squeezed back. They sat that way for several moments, both lost in quiet thought as they stared out at the steely blue water stretched before them.
Fenrir hummed, reaching under Draco's shirt to twist one nipple painfully, and Draco whimpered. "I could make you," he hissed, scratching his nails down to the waistband of Draco's trousers, and Draco's stomach flinched, trying to shy away from the touch. The tears came harder as Draco sobbed, preparing himself for whatever Fenrir wanted to do to him.
The words echoed through Draco's dazed brain and his jaw finally unlocked enough to utter a single word: "No."
"Seriously, though, Harry," Caelix said, appearing somber once more. "While I might not agree with his methods or the fact that he did keep the identity of the killer a secret, I think I might understand his motivations."
Pansy grinned around the circle. "If you lot don't want to play a game, we can just have a drinking contest instead."
"I should go help Ron and Hermione," Harry protested, already knowing that his body would not be able to walk away from Draco at that moment. "They're still examining the scene and I should be—"
"Used to be?" Draco and Blaise both asked at the same time, snickering as Pansy stopped laughing to glare at them.
With another uneasy glance at the unknown man, Malfoy shook his head. "I'm in the middle of something, I'm afraid. It will have to wait for another time."
Harry wanted to respond with something casual and light, something teasing and airy that would help relieve the tension still sparking between them, but he found himself responding far more seriously than he had been intending. "Yeah, Malfoy," he murmured, staring Malfoy in the eye as he spoke. "I think I did."
Taking a step back, Harry ran a hand through his hair in annoyance. "Fine," he relented. "Fine, you want confessions? Yes. All right? Yes, I fucking meant it. I meant what I said earlier and I meant what I said that night when I told you not to forget me. I realized that I had feelings for you and I was afraid that it was the side effects of the potion that made you want me. Clearly, I was right." By the end of his speech, his voice was icy and bitter, but there was a slight undercurrent of panic lacing his tone as he finished speaking. Why had he admitted to all that? Malfoy would be sure to sneer and humiliate him, possibly yell it to the entire student body or sell it to the Daily Prophet.
Sirius Black, or whatever remained of him at least, grabbed Crowley's hand tight and swallowed. It was clear he was in pain, but there was a crazed sort of look in his eyes that made Crowley worry. And he didn't worry often.
His new friend leaned back to glance in the direction Harry was nodding and a vicious sneer twisted across his features. He scoffed and crossed his arms as he straightened back up. "That's Malfoy," he said, the name like acid on his tongue and it made Harry frown. "Comes from a family of purebloods, he does. His da is always trying to get mine in trouble or fired for something or another. He's a right git and no one can convince me otherwise."
“It’s a year book,” Draco said easily, shifting the heavy book in his hands to prop it open and show Harry the large group photo on the first page. “It’s got images from everyone who went to Hogwarts with our parents,” he explained, pointing to a silver haired man that he knew Harry recognized as Lucius, and a dark brown haired woman that was his mother. Harry’s mouth was hanging open in surprise as the image shifted and moved, the students shuffling or smiling as the camera ran. Draco shifted it again to point towards a dark, greasy looking man and the red-haired woman hugging him. “That’s Uncle Severus and your mother.”
Draco couldn’t help the break in his normally cool mask when he smiled brightly, his eyes all but lighting up at the name. “Brilliant! Did you hear mother? I’m a silver dragon!”
"Harry James Potter, if you do not get off that broom this instant!"
please
“Nothing to eat,” Narcissa demanded, surprised at how loud her voice became as she tried to hold back a shriek. “The boy is ten years old! How do they expect him to fend for himself at home for a fortnight with
Draco grinned and nodded his head in acknowledgement.
The boy looked to be thinking for a few moments before he turned to Draco. With a determined expression on his face, he touched one finger to his ear and brought the hand down into a fist, before moving it towards his mouth and wiggling his fingers outwards. It looked absolutely ridiculous to Draco and he couldn’t even begin to understand what it meant, but his uncle looked pleased so he didn’t imagine it was awful. “Well?”
Narcissa frowned, glancing back at her husband who had moved to take a seat on the nearby couch, his hand spread over his mouth as he read the letters in his hands. “What is it? What’s happened?”
Severus said as the boy signed, smiling before Harry faced his hands out and bowed. He looked a bit unsure, his gaze turning towards Draco for just a moment. But Draco’s smile seemed to relax him and he straightened back up to sign something else that looked similar to Draco’s sign name. Severus’ grin only widened and he dropped a hand on Harry’s head. “He says this is your sign name,” Severus told them, motioning for Harry to repeat it, before he could explain however, Harry pointed towards Lucius and did a similar sign only he touched his forehead instead of his chin like he had for Narcissa. “It means Mother Dragon and Father Dragon.”
Hermione politely declined the offer to pet Sirius, and Harry quickly covered him back up so the others wouldn't seen him as they entered into the great hall.
The ceremony went slowly, and in no particular order that Harry could gather. It wasn't by name or birthday, but simply from whatever list it was that Professor McGonagal was reading from. As he expected, Ron was eagerly accepted into Gryffindor without the hat even touching his head, and judging from the many cheers from other redheads at the table, they were just as excited as his friend. Hermione sat up there a little longer, speaking with the hat as if they were having a debate. After a while she nodded and straightened up with a convinced smile before the hat cried out a loud, "Gryffindor!"
Harry frowned, a blush decorating his cheeks at the praise and he raised a hand towards the lichenberg figure tracing down his face. "Uh- it's Fell now, actually, Potter-Fell, but my dads said I can just use Fell at school. And- and I'm not a legend! I'm just Harry," he answered, shaking a head.
Harry bit his lip and glanced over to where Lucius was holding a family photo. Severus couldn’t see what was on it, but his friend looked a strange mix of confused and angry. Harry simply looked torn.
And they were staring right at Harry.
There was a tingling sensation then around their hands and Crowley knew that when he looked there would be a golden thread seared into the skin of his arm, wrapping around it like a coil. It would fade if he wanted it to, part of him wondered if he'd let it.
"Hey, don't take that attitude with me, mister. I'm just making sure."
his dad answered with a grim nod. “
The loud voice of the hat boomed through the hall and echoed against the walls.
She nodded.
His father’s hand on his shoulder had Draco pausing, Harry still trying to catch up on Severus’ translations. After a brief pause, Lucius smiled softly and tugged Draco back a step. “I’m sure this is all very exciting, Draco, but perhaps we should let Harry rest now. It’s been a busy day and we have a lot to do tomorrow. Come, off to bed with you both.”
Severus took a moment to think about it, running through the various choices. “Minerva was there when they dropped the boy off with Petunia. I’ve known her as long as I’ve known Albus and I trust her much more. She has only ever had her students safety and happiness in mind whereas Albus runs games no one knows the rules of,” he sneered, running a hand through his hair. “Besides her, I trust Poppy Pomfrey as well. She too would go against Albus if it meant the safety of a child. In fact I’d trust her to look the boy over much more than a random healer, especially with him being so… recognizable,” Severus said carefully, gesturing towards his face to indicate the boy’s scar. “I can contact her tomorrow.”
Petunia lead them to a hall just outside of the living area before pausing, hands reaching for a key in her pocket. Something wicked and sick twisted in Crowley's stomach as they drew closer, only growing more and more angry as she pulled a small cupboard door open under the stairs to reveal a basinet. Harry was laid inside it, cuddled into a ratted blanket, brown hair incredibly messy and a wicked Lichtenberg scar  splicing down his forehead and face.
His son was deaf, something he must not have been born with or he assumed Lily would have told him about it in her letter. How he’d grown to be so, Severus wasn’t sure but he didn’t like the thoughts swirling through his mind at the new information.
Draco laughed before pointing to Harry’s eyes. The other boy grinned in understanding before signing “
"Yes mum."
Blinking at the sudden change in conversation, Harry shook his head and took the small box from Ron's hand. "Uh- thanks? I didn't know I was a legend, but I guess that's cool. My Ba always said that no one is better than anyone else though so, I don't see why we can't sit together." The boys shared a smile and Harry popped open the lid to the oddly shaped box.
Now, about the Potter's will. I am aware that we previously discussed this after you and Mr. Fell adopted Harry, but I find it pertinent to remind you, just in case, what with Harry taking his first voyage into the wizarding world. I'm sure you remember, but Harry does have a sizable fortune left to him from his parents that is sitting in his Gringots Vault. Since he's turned eleven, he is now allowed to access that vault, so it's asked that you visit Gringots before school begins in order to put Harry's affairs in order. Since he is so young, he will need to have an adult put on file as his guardian officially, but he will be allowed to use the money left to him to purchase his school items.
"Don't be nervous, Harry, you'll do fine," Minerva said quietly, nodding to him.
The photo was one Severus hadn’t seen in a very,
"Seems like."
In truth it wasn’t
"Right. Forgot how fucking awful that is." He straightened his jacket and kicked at the sigil, his foot bouncing off the invisible wall with a soft thud. "Wonderful. Hellooooo? Anyone alive in here?"
"Baba, why is the snake sad?" Harry asked, frowning at the large serpent inside the zoo enclosure.  It didn't move, didn't look at them, but Harry somehow knew, as the boy often just knew things. "Look at him, he's like mum when you forget to kiss him."
“Thank you, my friends,” Severus whispered, a bit of life finally returning to his eyes as he looked at them both. “I can never repay you for all you’ve done for me.”
"Yes," the demon nodded in agreement. "But Harry has gone through a lot. He may not know it, but he has. It's bound to push him back a bit. The kid had to watch his mother die in front of him. I believe he's earned a bit of slack on the talking front." There was a long silence and Crowley peeked open an eye to stare at the angel. It was clear Aziraphale was still upset, perhaps worried, but he knew the demon was correct in his assessment so he didn't deign to continue the argument, or the gentle pushing towards Harry.
Harry shook his head, reaching for the snake. It went eagerly, wrapping almost protectively around Harry's shoulders like a scarf. "But mum, you said he was sad there! You said he was trapped! I couldn't- I just pictured you in there, stuck with people watching and watching but never offering to help." Crowley blinked down at the child, at his clenched fists and his stern face. "I couldn't leave him there! But- but you said I couldn't let him go because he'd die without someone to take care of him. So- so I figured- I thought-"
As Mr. Crowley was a previous employee of us, it is an easy thing to return him to his position here at Hogwarts if he wishes to take it. I am sad to say however that the Defense Against the Dark Arts position he had previously is taken, however Professor Sprout is eager to go into an early retirement. I suspect it is due to her fondness of Mr. Crowley after his many years here, and the fact that her wife wishes to travel throughout their elder years. So she was happy to give him her position if he is amendable.
He didn’t look much like either of them really, not freshly born and barely an hour old. But he was pale as snow with pink in his cheeks and his little button nose. And when he blinked his eyes open, they were the most beautiful of greens.
Harry glanced down from where he was standing to see a boy his age on the floor, knocked over by Harry's not paying attention. The boy was shorter than him, with bright white hair and big blue eyes. He wore a sharp looking green tunic and slacks, and he had an upset frown on his face. Harry couldn't help but think the look was kind of cute on the boy.
"Which is why I
"Harry, where's your pet? Did you bring one?" Ron asked, frowning as he glanced back at the case Harry had left behind. "I didn't see it in there."
hate you. Come on, spit it out."
Harry pouted but after a moment he shrugged. "That's okay. I can wait. This is going to be so awesome! Oh, but- you guys can't go..."
“It’s out of control and downright annoying right now. I’m sure you can do something to stop all of this.” Harry was pleading with the minister to put an end to this madness.
Draco blushed again and said quietly “Me too. But…”
Kingsley sat back in his chair and thought for a moment. “I assume you don’t want to join the Aurors by any chance?” Harry shook his head, about to speak but was cut off by Kingsley. “Yeah, Robards can make anyone want to leave the Aurors, nevermind join them. He’s a tricky one, that man. ...I do have a position that will soon be free. My right-hand adviser is retiring at the end of the month. You are welcome to take the position. It’s a fairly easy position. There’s not much to do unless I need a second opinion, or a hand with difficult cases, which aren’t too common. I’m glad you came actually, because I’m certain you’d be perfect for the job. It comes with your own office space. As for Draco, he can be part of the Ministry’s ingoing/outgoing memo and mail responding staff. We always need more of them. It can be arranged for him to work close by you.”
“Ok, first of all, you’re a right cunt for saying that. But words don’t hurt me like they hurt you. So, bitch, tell me or I will come up with something myself. You know of my powers in the ministry, I’m aware?” She sipped her drink.
“Give. It. To. Me.” Snape ordered. He Summoned it and Snape caught it. “If i ever catch you using that spell on anyone, I will use it myself. On you. Understood?” He whispered menacingly to Harry.
Harry shook his head, saying “No, it’s fine. I love them.” Draco smiled and felt his cheeks heat as he looked back down to what he was doing. Harry sat down beside him and they stayed there in silence before Harry asked “Is there anything I can do?”
Harry sighed deeply. “I took a walk after my meeting with the Minister, grabbed a bite, and sat outside for a bit. I just wanted some time for myself.”
“I am an adult, Harry. I don’t need everything done for me by a house elf, you know.”
“Oh, you've got business to do. I'll just…” Draco said, pointing to the door.
As he walked up the boardwalk, he saw Harry sitting, with his legs dangling over the edge, looking down into the water. When he approached him, Harry gestured for him to stop.
Harry arrived to the ministry after his talk with Draco, and was allowed to wait for the minister in his office. He needed a moment alone anyways, to really think about everything that was going on with his mate. Aside from the whole Alpha/Omega thing, he just wanted a regular relationship with Draco. He wasn’t keen on how fast things were moving between them, even if he did love Draco and want to spend forever with him. He just wanted things to be normal for once. He wanted to go on dates with Draco, without being pummeled by the press, he wanted to go to sleep and wake up with Draco by his side, without thinking about another thing to worry about between them. He wanted to touch and make love to Draco without worrying about hurting him or making him uncomfortable. He wanted to do things normally, without the risk of his magic threatening everything and everyone around him because of how stressed he was. He just wanted to live a normal-

“Find someone else that is more competent.” He claims, throwing his chin up, an attempt to look more defiant.
“Please.” Draco smiled.
Draco kissed Harry.
“No.”
“How I know you're and Omega?” Draco just shook his head, not trusting his voice. He thought it was something to do with scents, like he'd read in the book, but Harry seemed to know more about this than he did, so he let him explain. “I can smell you. Something like spearmint, soap and I think sugar but I'm not sure.” Harry paused and watched Draco’s unchanging expression for a moment. “There's this thing I can do, being an Alpha and all. Basically I can block out your smell, which in turn blocks out your emotions, which would normally translate into your scent. I can't smell you right now, because I'd probably be all over you if I could. It's quite addicting actually.”
The two of them filled the couple in on their visit and all that they talked about with their healer.
“Harry,” Malfoy softly whispered.
Harry immediately stopped laughing and his face fell. “Oh, right. Sorry ‘bout that.” He mumbled.
“What is it, Harry?” Hermione asked.
When Ron and Harry came out from the study a little while later, talking more about what the other missed and how life was going in general, they saw Hermione and Draco sitting at the table, teacups in hand, their conversation paused while the two boys came to join them.
After a few moments of sniffles and shushes, Draco pulled back and wiped his tear streaked face.
Draco allowed it for a moment, then pulled away. Harry stopped kissing him, but didn’t stop softly caressing him.
Harry looked at Draco, calculating. “Draco….” Draco just looked at him expectantly. “Draco, I- are you sure?” He asked seriously. Oh man, things were moving fast.
“Oh no, Minister, it’s my fault. I’ve been a little stressed lately. I can’t seem to focus on my thoughts without being interrupted or given something else to worry about.” Harry said, rubbing a hand down his face and sighing.
Draco shook his head with a smile before saying “Merlin, you’re such a muggle.” Harry made an offended sound, realizing that that was the first quip Draco had thrown at him the whole time they’ve been together. He stuck a finger in the batter Draco was mixing and spread it along his pale arm. “Hey!” Draco exclaimed before doing the same along Harry’s cheek. They both broke out into laughter as their actions had quickly become a game of ‘who can spread the most amount of brownie batter on the other’.
I've always wanted to swim
“You’re so gorgeous, Draco. And that man was a fucking creep.” Harry growled deeply, leaving Draco’s hard cock to throw a wet tantrum in his pants. “I would’ve fucking ended him if you hadn’t stopped me.”
Draco sighed again, put off that he had to delve deeper into his thoughts, doubts, and emotions, all on display for Harry to see how vulnerable he hated being.
They were both very aroused, and while Harry’s hands never left Draco’s skin, Draco simply stared into Harry’s eyes, thinking what alternate universe he entered that this was his life, and this was really his reality.
Once Harry was seated inside the courtroom again, he glanced up to the Minister's place and caught the slight frown that Kingsley threw his way.
“Is this what that bloody message was about, Malfoy?” Seamus asked.
He sighed, stretched, and made his way to the kitchen to make some breakfast- he was so hungry.
Their month long honeymoon had sadly come to an end, but it was a time that neither of them would ever forget.
“Before class, you also showed a...willingness to be with Malfoy, or for Malfoy to be amongst your company, during my lectures. This information now leads me to believe there was another reason as to why all of this doesn’t add up. You supposedly cast an unknown curse at Malfoy, who was incapasitated at the time of the duel, which effectively altered his mental state. Which I, being the creator of said curse, knows that the spell was not meant to cause any harm aside from physical. Now, being the…
“What?” he said. They had started the day out so nicely too.
“Hermione.” Harry breathed a sigh of relief. “You're here early, is everything alright? I thought you were coming over after work?”
Not only did she call him ‘Draco’, but she also said she was worried about him and asked him quite nicely to talk. His eyes narrowed and he asked “Why? What are you planning?”
“Fuck,” Harry groaned. It was the most euphoric feeling, having his dick touch another one, while they’re both naked and hard as rocks.
“Yes, you uneducated barbarian. I’m surprised you don’t know any better than to not cast such ridiculous charms on your friends, no less. Shame on you. Someone should do the same to you, you great lout.” Draco finished, sipping his whiskey rather loudly.
He was playing, and Harry respected him too much to just tackle him on the bed and have his way with the blond. So he stood and walked into the bathroom, if only to get away from the (practically) naked Omega. He waited a few minutes until Draco called him out. Thankfully he was dressed, because Harry wouldn’t have been able to control himself if he wasn’t.
“I enjoy having intellectually stimulating conversations, normally about philosophical or astronomical subjects.”
The Omega felt his cheeks heat up before he grinned too. He started pressing kisses all over Harry’s face saying “You stupid-ridiculous-act-before-you-think-Gryffin-dor.” Finally he pulled back and said “But why? Why not wait? You didn’t tell them that we’re…”
Harry sighed dramatically. “Seeing as we don’t know anything about each other, I thought we could converse in a civil manner about the hobbies we like to partake in.”
“I’m just asking. If you had the option, would you?”
Another blow to his chest. Draco revisited the memory of his and Harry’s wedding day. Not a very good one, if you asked him. “I see.” he said. He began backing out of the room, trying to give Harry space, again, lest he get hurt even more.
“But I do! I just want to wait a little bit.”
But Draco wasn’t making the most of this situation, no, he made it worse. He makes everything worse.
“I suggested the window, but Hermione said it was too cliche.”
“My hero.” Draco said sarcastically with an eye roll. Harry lightly smacked his bum.
He sighed “Look at you,” he took Draco’s face in his hands and kissed him so lovingly, Draco’s heart couldn't handle it. A tear fell down and Harry swiped it away.
Harry looked dumbfounded and draco thought about it for a moment. “That does make sense…” He said slowly.
A whispered “thank you,” was all Harry heard as he made his way inside.
When Malfoy’s eyes landed on him, the foggy mist that invaded his steel-blue orbs seemed to dissipate. His eyes lit up, and a smile bigger than any Harry has ever seen on anyone, let alone on the blond, graced his features.
“You know I don’t think that way, Draco. You know that’s not true. If I was aware of any of that, I would’ve requested something better for you, or declined the notion downright, never mind supporting you to accept the offer.”
Harry was taken aback. He really wasn’t expecting that.
Draco stared wide eyed at him the whole time he spoke. When he was finished, Draco stiffly nodded his head. They stared at each other for another moment, the all-encompassing grey affecting Harry more than he’d like to admit.
That was something draco had discovered, actually. A few weeks into living with Harry, he could feel what his Alpha felt, emotionally, just from touching him. And aside from whatever Harry was feeling in the moment, there was always the feeling of pure love somewhere in the background. It would get stronger by the day. Sometimes it was so strong, that’s all Draco could feel come from his mate.
“Mhm?” Draco turned to face him. “What do you need?” he asked, stroking Harry’s hair.
“I am not frequently moody.” Draco said hotly.
She smiled over at him. “He told me about you two as well.”
Harry knew he was crazy for thinking this way so he shut it out and waited for the Minister's reply.
He returned several hours later, only because the sun was getting too hot, and also because he might’ve passed out since he hadn’t eaten his breakfast from earlier.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah, I’d love to know what Walkins had to say about your questions.” Hermione joined in. Draco noticed she looked calmer and more vibrant than when they’d left the bathroom.
“Like the other night?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Being the powerful Alpha he was, Harry was able to 'block' out the scents that flooded his senses. Why didn't he do this when the blond first came in the room? Well, he had never been in the presence of such a fresh Omega, let alone the strong, addictive scents he gave off.  Harry tried his best to focus on the trial and not the pestering need that itched at the back of his mind to break free.
He nodded, not really having a choice. “Ok, I promise. But you should tell Ron soon. I can’t imagine he’d be too happy to find out you’ve been keeping this from him. Oh, god. It is his, right?” surely Hermione wouldn’t…
Draco laughed. “Finish your eggs love. I’ll be in the library.”
Harry pulled off Draco’s tie, Draco pushed off Harry’s jacket. Harry slipped off Draco’s jacket and Draco untied Harry’s tie. They both started to unbutton each other’s shirts.
He never calls her Parkinson, only when he’s really mad or serious. “I swear, Pansy. I don’t want him to be embarrassed by me. We haven’t established anything, yet. I don’t want people finding out, then tormenting him because he’s with a marked Death Eater, and him leaving me, all because you have a big mouth. I fucking swear, if you ruin this for me-”
Draco went back to gaping like a fish, but a new blush found it's way on his cheeks. Harry refrained from speaking until Draco did, letting the information sink in. Eventually he found his voice and words “So, how does that work?”
Harry laughed. “I wish. But no, just the stories.”
I literally cried while writing this-could be because I'm hormonal rn but also because Drarry is my OTP especially this soft, loving Drarry. I love this trope. I love this fic. I love this update. I hope you enjoyed it too.
“Everything alright, love?” Draco asked quietly, taking Harry’s hand and looking up at him.
Harry sighed, still in a mood, and got comfortable as Healer Walkins began casting her spell tests. After twenty minutes or so of her checking and recording his vitals, magical core strength and any other key physical tests.
Harry chuckled. “Ok, it’s fine. We just went out for a little while.”
He never really got over the bloke, but he did pursue his passion, which was undoubtedly hair styling, which he’d practiced throughout school on his fellow students, mainly in his eighth year when he had the freedom to do so.
“Harry, mate? Draco?” Ron called through the Floo, seeing if the couple was home.
Harry was panting raggedly, lust and power overtaking his whole being. Within seconds, the room thrummed with his magic, Draco could feel it pulsing through the air towards him.
“Well, yeah. I tried to, but the bugger held on tight. It took me a couple tries, but I’m here now.” Harry answered. He was still shaken up, unsure if Malfoy was pulling a prank, or Harry really messed him up.
“Just because I didn’t kill you this time, doesn’t mean I won’t!” Harry snarled at him, the only thing stopping him from jumping the blond was Hermione’s hand twisting back his tricep.
“Ron, mate? What’s going on? It’s the middle of the-”
“I enjoy drawing.” Draco admitted quietly.
Or so he thought.
Hermione and Ron sit quietly in the supplied chairs beside the bed. Draco sits still, looking at Harry. His face is the same, save for a slight bruise on his cheek. He wonders why the medi-team didn’t heal that. He reaches over and gently caresses his cheek, the spot where the bruise lay. When he extracts his hand, the spot is gone. He gasps.
Draco just raised an eyebrow at him.
Harry felt much, much better he got that off his chest, but now very, very hungry. The corner of his lip pulled slightly as he said “Starving.”
Oh dear Merlin, Draco thought.
“Did you pack the toiletries, love?” Draco called from the kitchen.
“Why not?” Draco retorted. “I like doing hair and making people feel good about themselves; Merlin knows I screwed up enough shite in my life, it was about time I turned things around.”
“Whatever, Malfoy.” Harry returned to his notes, his neck finally vacant.
“Mhmm.” Harry responded softly.
We didn’t only fuck every time we were together. We went on dates, met up with friends, stayed in and cuddled. We broke up a lot, yeah, but we always came back to each other, more often than not me to him.
“I will let him know. Thanks, Kingsley. Have a good one.” And with that, they ended the call.
Potter laughed again. Draco decided he really enjoyed hearing the sound come from Potter.
“What can I do for you love?” Harry asked, peering into the blond's stormy orbs.
Malfoy gulped from where he was looking up at Harry. He looked positively miserable, about to burst into tears. He nodded.
Draco succeeded because he used his talent and skill to help others, which made him feel complete. And once you feel complete, you feel accomplished, and once you feel accomplished, you’ve succeeded.
After Draco was fully hard and leaking, without a word, he pulled out of Harry’s mouth, crawled down the bed once more, flipped the brunet over again, and promptly ate his arse out with the most splendid sounds.
Draco almost had to wipe drool off his chin.
“Ok.” Draco said with a nod.
“Merlin, you’re a pain.” Harry said affectionately.
Draco was also very happy where he was with Harry, but he did always feel bad when he'd end their heated kisses and touches, because he knew how Harry would get really into them. He would end the contact before things could escalate too far, and silently thanked Harry for not making a big deal of it. Actually he was really thankful because Harry would only smile and roll over to his side of the bed or resume his daily activities. Draco really did feel bad about it, and it's not that he wasn't ready to take things further with Harry, he actually really wanted to, he just wasn't sure how to tell the raven-haired beauty that he was ready to give him everything. He wanted his first time with Harry to be spectacular and memorable, not rushed in a moment of heated passion. However, he wanted it to happen and since he and Harry hadn't formally discussed it yet, he thought now would be a good choice to bring it up, with both of them fresh from a long restful sleep.
As he exited the courtroom, Hermione and Ron rushed right too him, asking what happened, what all the shouting was about, if he was ok, what happened to Draco, and so on.
“Oh, nothing. Just a list of stuff to remember for this week.”
As Harry gave the two hugs goodbye and waved them off, Draco approached him, hands stuffed into his pockets, and a glumish look in his eyes he tried to hide with a half smile.
Without a word, the blond took his place and was submerged into the pensieve. When the memory was finished and he extracted himself from the dish, the expression his face held was shock, but also had a hint of understanding.
“Nothing, just that it belongs to the most awful house at Hogwarts.” Draco snickered.
Harry’s hands found Draco’s hips and sat up, pulling the blond onto his lap. They continued to snog for long minutes, taking small moments to press their foreheads together as they caught their breath. They kissed and made out for longer than either of them could tell.
“I like you begging,” Malfoy said, biting his lip in a seductive way. “You got the devour part right. I’d love to just swallow down your-”
“No, no, it’s ok.” Draco said. “I’m aware of your feelings. Not much has changed, I guess. You rest, ok?” and with that, he all but ran from the kitchen, ignoring Harry’s daunting sighs.
Draco awoke the next morning to an emptier bed than he was used to. He remembered what happened the night before, before even opening his eyes. He sighed and felt a heaviness settle around himself.
“I want to go swimming, the water looks so nice right now and it’s so warm out.” Draco laughed through Harry’s tender assault.
She eyed him with pity, something he hated that she did quite often. “Was Draco doing something? You guys seemed ok in there. What happened?”
“Someone’s in a good mood.” Draco realized, as Harry approached his side of the bed. He leaned down and kissed him square on the mouth. It immediately made Draco light headed. He accepted the kiss happily, albeit confused.
Eventually he released him, and Draco stripped as went running down the boardwalk towards the beach. Once there, he removed his boxers which were last, and ran into the water without hesitation.
He stepped out and stood at the end of the aisle, for everyone to view. Sweat beaded on his forehead, heart thumped as if he just ran a marathon, head pounding like a hammer, and vision softly blurred around the edges. His eyes caught one particular blue petal in front of him, and he wished more than anything that he was just that: a useless piece of organic material that would be swept away at the end of the day. He continued his mantra almost like a prayer, as he slowly lifted his head. Green met grey before
His head drops into my neck, groans emotionally, and pulls out. We’ve finished together. Something we’ve always done since the beginning. Something that’s never changed.
He just shrugged and said “Yeah, I guess that works too.”
“You know I won’t.” Draco calls behind him, sashaying his hips on the way out.
Harry sighed deeply, thinking over his choices; which were none, to be completely honest. Hermione was right, he needed to at least try. Ugh, he really hates how right she is sometimes.
“You’re so gorgeous.” Harry claimed when he wrapped his arms around Draco once again.
Harry pushed his shoulder away with a sheepish smile, curled up on his side and went to sleep. Draco soon joined him, curling around the back of his little spoon.
“Our relationship, whatever it is, will not be based on sex. Just so you know.”
Harry shushed him with another kiss.
Upon turning the corner, he bumped into the medi-witch that had talked to him when he first arrived the night before.
“Well, um, cause I thought that every time you said that, it wasn’t you actually saying or feeling those things. It was the prophecy.”
“I didn’t think about this part.” Harry said, glumly.
He Apparated them within his apartment, straight into his room. He sat on the bed, never letting go of Draco.
“Oh, come on now.” Harry said, easily, EASILY, lifting Draco up and settling him back onto the large table. “Tell me, what did you want to talk about.”
“Would you if you could?”
Harry's eyes snapped to the frail blond that stepped through a side door where he was lead by two aurors to the seat that stood in the middle of the room.
Draco blushed. “We were, well…” She nods her head, knowingly. “But we stopped to talk for a minute.”
He nodded. “ I did. I told them, about us.”
The trio didn’t speak again until Harry was once again dressed in his expensive suit, hair combed and fixed, and breathing deeply to Ron’s administrations.
“Morning.” Draco said quietly.
“I did too, but there really is no reason to. I realized that when I saw you dressed like that… then you said, ‘this is for my bonded’ and I realized that would be me. But then I thought what if I wasn’t to be your bonded, and you were referring to someone else? I just got so angry at the thought of anyone else seeing you like that or touching you like I do. I knew then that there was no way I would ever let you go. I know you meant it was for me, and that I am to be your bonded, but that was really a wake up call. Then the way I lost control because of you… Draco, you have more control over me than I do of anyone, even myself. You contain more power in the way you control me, than I do in my whole being, magic and all. You own me entirely. There is no one else I want, there is no one else that will have you. And I realize that now.” Harry explained, looking deeply into Draco’s soul.
Draco nodded frantically. “Merlin, yes.” He cried.
Snape came through the doors moments later, courtesy of McGonagall's patronus to him, alerting him that Malfoy had woken up.
“Harry! Nice to see you again. And Draco, you as well. I hope you’re both well?” The Minister greeted them, shaking both their hands firmly.
Harry couldn’t stop laughing.
“It’s alright baby, I like that you knew about that though. Have you been reading up on manifesting?” Harry asked, switching from petting to rubbing soothingly up and down Draco’s back.
As Draco stepped out of the shower and started drying himself, he sighed as he remembered he didn’t have clothes to change into. After his and Harry’s little food fight, his only casual outfit got covered in brownie batter. He inwardly scolded himself for kissing the raven-haired boy, and for no reason. Once he stepped under the scolding water, he willed himself not to think about it. Now, he was without clothes and really didn’t want to ask Harry for more. So, towel wrapped around waist, he quickly moved to his room and threw on his pyjamas.
Draco ran to the bed and started shaking the boy “Harry! Harry, wake up! Harry! Oh dear Merlin...Harry!” When the screaming stopped and he saw the boys eyes flutter open, he dropped on the edge of the bed, clutching over his heart with his hand. “Merlin, Harry. What the bloody hell was that for?” He asked, looking down at the raven-haired boy, worriedly.
Draco had barely sat up when Harry was already stumbling out of bed and into the bathroom. The door shut behind him and the lock clicked proudly.
“Oh, ho, kick my butt, huh? You think you can?” Harry said, joining in on Draco’s laughter as he started to tickle the blond.
“So,” Ron said after a moment. “Did you two fuck, then?”
Draco thought for a moment. Harry was literally saying he was falling for Draco. Draco was already in love with the man, so there was no need to build on his emotions for the man, he just needed to know that Harry liked him back.
“Good, now make love to me.” Draco said, pulling Harry down once more.
One particular deep thrust had Harry gasping.
Harry never really cried. Even with his panic attacks, he rarely ever did. But today was different. He felt as though he was allowed to, seeing as how his life just went downhill ever since that day in the hall with Trelawney.
As a new day started, the sun peeked through the drapes and the birds chanted loudly outside the window. Hushed whispers and shy kisses were shared between tangled limbs and warm sheets. Although they were quite close now, they hadn't gone further than a few makeout sessions aside from their sweet kisses and small touches with each other.
“Trade?” Draco asked, ignoring the ‘too much of a challenge’ quip.
“Mr. Malfoy?” A medi-witch appears at their end of the long hallway, the one Harry was taken down.
“Attached? You’re saying that Malfoy attached himself to me? In-in what sense? Does he, oh Merlin. He liked me, doesn’t he?” Harry hid his face in his hands, the thought of Draco Malfoy liking him being to hard to bear.
“Did he have a history of seizures?” Draco asked a moment later.
Potter growled lowly. “Don’t make me do this, Draco.”
The positively uncouth behaviour of Potter had been shoved out of his mind, as if it was just another encounter with an unwanted pervert grinding up on him in the club.
Harry shrugged and grinned sheepishly. “They’re going to know eventually, right? I mean, you are my mate ‘n all.”
“No.” Draco said. “I’d rather converse with a baboon. Then I might actually have a civilized conversation, unlike with your neanderthal arse.” Draco said, still struggling to remove himself from Harry’s grasp.
“Mrs Walkins has heard of your case and would like to discuss all the possible explanations as to why this has occurred.” Marigold spoke again.
Harry watched from the boardwalk as his husband was having the time of his life amongst the waves.
“You knew about french toast but not pancakes?” Harry asked incredulously.
“Ah, yes. Kingsley will be meeting with you personally, and you must be Draco Malfoy.” She beamed up at the blond, who was partially hidden behind Harry’s towering frame.
He was smiling at Harry. Harry, still mentally retreated into himself, refused to process this, and slightly flinched when he felt a soft hand find a place within his own. Draco got close and whispered to him. “There’s nothing we can do about this now. Let me help you. I promise I’ll always be here for you, ok?”
“It’s alright, Harry. I’m not upset. You would’ve come in me anyways had I not passed out. I am a little concerned about how you lost control. I just meant for a little bit of teasing but…” Draco looked away, ashamed that he let things escalate to what they did. It wasn’t a matter of consent, more about not getting his point across, and rather giving into their carnal desires.
But he hesitated.
Draco was stuck. It seemed he truly couldn’t escape the fate the prophecy had decided upon the two of them.
It was half way through Potions, the first period having just passed. Harry had managed to copy all the notes he needed to, and Malfoy actually sticking to his seat and not having touched Harry once.
“No, let’s go and make something.” Harry smiled.
As they were walking to the Floos, hand in hand, Draco stopped. “You mean to tell me that you had a private office all to your own and you took me to an abandoned conference room to fuck me?”
“Aside from protecting the wizarding world.” Draco said. It wasn’t a question.
Harry smiled and turned back to his friends. "Alright then. You two coming along?" He asked.
“He-he had a bruise. They didn’t heal it so I- I just touched it. It’s gone, though.”
“Malfoy?!!” Harry screamed, almost slipping on the soap he squirted from the bottle.
“Please, I assumed you’d want time with him.” Draco said with a chuckle.
He stopped when a hand grabbed his wrist and he heard a mumble similar to “Stay.” He turned back to see Harry who just looked up at him with wide eyes.
Harry groaned and relaxed into his boyfriends actions.
“Did exactly what you said you did. You sucked me off. Do you expect me to return the favour?”
Because the prophecy was making Harry feel the pain.
“Yes. Bloody great invention it was too. It ends up in each person's mailbox on their floor.” Jonathan said.
Harry addressed them all when they arrived, saying that yes he and Draco were together and that they liked each other both very much, and that if anyone had a problem with it, they could return through the door they had entered from. No on left, but they were still surprised how it all happened.
“Since our honeymoon. I got fed up with the fucking heart palipitations so I started hanging around you more. It helped, apparently.”
Walkins nodded, sitting in the chair beside Hermione. “Yes, that sounds possible.” Hermione smiled at the confirmation.
Draco didn’t know if it was because of all the wine they had, or because Harry had hit a soft spot with his flirting, but before he knew it, he blew up.
Harry was responding to a letter that Kingsley had owled him when he heard a noise come from downstairs. Normally he would’ve brushed it off as Kreacher before he realized that it wasn’t just the two of them anymore. He quickly scribbled the rest of his response and sent it off with the ministry’s owl that had been waiting patiently. He quickly grabbed his wand and made his way down the stairs when he discovered the sounds were coming from the kitchen. He pocketed his wand before pushing the door open. The sight that greeted him was shocking.
As they walked closer to this beautiful piece of architecture, they could see sheer, white linen drapes cascaded down every wall, covered every window, and framed every doorway. Beautiful white and brown accents and decorations brought the whole theme together.
“Perfect. I’m not one for arguing so much as getting my way in things. If we fight, we will resolve our differences and make up. Also, neither of us could stand being in much pain, so I don’t think we’d fight for very long before giving in and figuring out a solution to the problem. Neither of us would kill the other, as we would both die, so that’s not a worry. I think that’s settled. Neither of us will purposefully cause the other pain without a legitimate reason as to why.” he reached across the table and thumbed at Harry’s lip. “There really is nothing for you to worry about, dear. We have to be more careful, yes, but we will come out stronger in the end for it.” Draco finished.
“And what might that be?” Draco asked.
“What..where’d you get this?” Draco asked.
After he dried off and dressed, he took his clothes down to the basement only to find some already down there. He recognised them as the ones he lent the blond. Wondering why Draco didn’t just use magic, seeing as he didn’t know how to use muggle devices (the oven, for example), Harry threw them into the wash along with his own. Then he realized that he could've too used it too. After turning it on and making his way back up the stairs, he saw a familiar shade of pale skin and blond hair outside. He saw some tea that was made so he silently grabbed a cup, wondering if he should go out and talk to him. ‘Let him come to you.’ Hermione’s words unhelpfully popped up again so he turned on his heel and all but stomped his way back up to his study.
Walkins thought for a moment. "It's very possible that the prophecy's magic needed time to strengthen and become accustomed to both of your magical signatures. If the arguments or temporary separations occurred in the first week or two of the bonding, it is very likely the magic hadn't become used to the situation and both of your signatures."
Fuck.
“Just tell me Draco.” His Alpha said, barked really.
“Don’t bother. She already came in. She explained everything to me, except why. I really have no clue. I didn’t see it coming at all.” his eyebrows knitted together at the thought.
“He didn’t have any animosity towards you. He told me so at the wedding. He actually has loved you for quite some time. But I’m guessing you already know that. You were the one to have to get over your animosity, not him. He’s actually a great guy, you know.”
“Right now you won’t.”
“Ah, Harry, so glad you could join us. Draco here has been informed of the recent event that took place. Now, if you remember, I require your memory from the moment this afternoon.”
“Oh, and Mr Potter, I will send living arrangements and a course schedule for you two to follow. I expect you to be responsible, Harry. Don’t let me down.”
He is dressed in nothing but pyjama bottoms, red and gold as always, shirtless, with a sneer almost as perfect as mine. It’s ironic, really.
He ran his tongue over his lip, still able to feel Malfoy’s softness there. He enjoyed the kiss, and he would’ve enjoyed it more if it wasn’t coming from Malfoy.
He wrapped his arms around the blond and kissed his forehead. “How long have you been awake?”
“That’d be nice.” Harry said, a smile playing on his lips.
“So, if I didn’t kill him, what did I do?” Harry asks solemnly.
Potter smiled a lopsided grin. Draco’s stomach squeezed again.
“Um, I’m actually unsure about that, to be completely honest with you.” Hermione responded, blotting her mouth with a napkin.
Ron just snorted. “Mate, are you that daft? Who do we know that you hate and makes you angry, with blond hair and grey eyes?”
“Of course. Whatever you’d like.”
“I guess I’ll just…”
He ripped off his jacket, suddenly his skin feeling hot and prickly, and started undoing the buttons of his shirt as he was sure that’s what has causing him to suffocate. But nothing seamed to work. He began pulling at his hair because his body failed at trying desperately to get air to fill his aching lungs, when a pair of strong arms wrapped around his torso, supporting his buckling knees and bringing his body back to the present. The stuttering thumping of his heart beat slowly faded out as worry-stricken voices took its place, trying to get his attention.
“Mhmm. Take some. They’re amazing with maple syrup - here.” Harry said, passing a jar with some brown liquid in it.
"Thanks," I mumble.
"I thought you would never speak to me again," Draco confessed, reaching out to pick up one of Harry's hands and trap it between his own. "I thought you hated me now."
Draco raised one eyebrow, still grinning. "You do realize that I'm dating the most powerful and famous human being in the entire country, don't you? Probably even the entire continent, maybe even the world, if the colonials across the sea know anything, so insulting my dating life just won't work anymore."
"As if anyone would need to cheat when
Gesturing to do so, Draco watched in morbid amusement as the brunet conjured a glass and poured himself a generous amount. Was he about to drown his sorrows in alcohol with Harry Potter? Were they really drinking together?
The return trip was much quicker, however, due to the large trays of food they were both levitating. The house-elves had piled dish after dish into their hands until Harry and Draco could no longer carry them all and instead had to wait as large silver trays were fetched and loaded up with steaming platefuls of food. The tray Draco was floating was piled high with chocolates and desserts and he had claimed it immediately as his to take.
On to the epilogue we go!
"You two are the hogs," Draco muttered. "Fine!" he huffed, just as Pansy began opening her mouth again. "Fine, you goddamn flamingo slag!" Blaise laughed loudly, earning a smack on the arm from Pansy. "Harry and I talked, everything is fine, we decided not to hide our goddamn—" Draco paused to grimace, "
"Tracer," Weasley explained, thumbing lazily through a folder, still seated in his reclined position with his feet up on the desk. "Works in Magical Evidence Analysis."
"Okay, maybe we get a
"I am not—" Harry began in outrage, but Draco cut him off.
Malfoy's gaze was nearly intense enough to scorch; it reminded Harry of the heat from the large stove in the kitchen earlier, hot enough to sear the flesh from his bones if he got too close.
The confusion on Harry's face deepened.
Weasley hesitated, clearly not wanting to turn Potter down at the same time he clearly wanted to turn Draco down.
"Touch them and die," he warned her, fixing his hair one last time before casting a breath freshening charm and spritzing some of his most expensive cologne on himself.
"I'm saying…" Potter fidgeted for several moments while Draco struggled not to faint from how hard his heart was pounding, "I'm saying that I—I don't want
"That," Draco grinned, nodding to an old, weathered path in the long grass and hard dirt, leading down from the road toward the gritty beach. They carefully stumbled their way down the trail, Harry's boots sinking into the soft grey sand. The beach was completely deserted, and Harry smiled to himself, wondering just what exactly Draco was planning to do to him down there. He really hoped it involved his dick and Draco's mouth.
Approaching carefully, Harry's heart began to hammer harder and harder the closer he got to the unmoving cadaver until he was feeling dizzy from the force of the blood racing through his veins in sickening surges. She wasn't moving, wasn't breathing; Harry's heart beat faster as he gazed down, nearly choking in disgust as nausea twisted his gut into horrified knots. Lying stiffly in a crumpled heap was the corpse of whom Harry had to assume was Daphne.
" Harry murmured, fingers stroking the silver lettering of the title. The book was intimidatingly large, and Harry could not imagine picking up a book that size at the age of twelve and attempting to read it for personal enjoyment.
"Erm, he's at it," Harry shrugged sheepishly.
"Sorry," he said quietly. "Are you still at the clubhouse? I'm outside."
I consider twirling straight into them and knocking them off course—hopefully knocking Chang unconscious—but decide a public forum is no place to act out such childish fantasies, especially when those fantasies are the result of envy.
or something. Something was definitely wrong with him, but Blaise would never tell me what happened. He would only say that some people deserve everything they get, and not to worry about it."
"Oh, right, the potion," he said weakly. He had completely forgotten that he had asked Hermione to look into that, and, never having explained the reasons or details behind the question, she was now bringing it up in front of Draco, who raised a silver eyebrow at him.
Silence draped the grounds like still death—nobody moved or spoke, the crickets had gone quiet, and not even the wind dared make a rustle. Harry wasn't even sure if he heard anybody
?!" The question rang out harshly along the corridor, echoing down the darkened hallway, and Harry immediately regretted his tone as Malfoy flinched sharply, drawing in a pained breath as he clutched at his torso.
Malfoy seemed to understand and was eager to comply. His mouth left Harry's to trail down his throat and chest, licking a burning path down his abdomen until Malfoy was on his knees, mouth hot against the skin of Harry's hip, nimble fingers slipping open the fastenings on Harry's trousers. Without warning, Harry felt his remaining clothing tugged down to his ankles before Draco's mouth was suddenly on him.
"Sounds like you should definitely fit in then," he chuckled, earning a good-natured glare.
The scratching of his quill, normally a sound Draco found to be calming, was doing little to slow the racing of his heart. Harry should be arriving at the Potions room at any moment. In an effort to distract himself from his impending heart attack, Draco had allowed the thick Potions book to fall open to a random page, pulling a blank parchment from his bag and beginning to copy down the text word-for-word. It had done little so far, however, to distract him from the hammering in his chest, the sweat on his palms, the trembling of his fingers.
"Right, okay," the brunet nodded, his words undermined by yet another kiss.
"The Ferret?" he gasped. "You ditched my sister to be with the fucking
, don't you, Pans? So maybe the word 'best' is a bit extreme for his relationship with you. That makes you third on his list of favorites, right after Draco, of course, since Harry obviously loves me the most and naturally put me at the top of the list on account of us being so very close. Right, Harry?"
"Of course I'm upset about it!" Malfoy said incredulously. "How the hell could I not be? You're telling me that other students attempting to potion you without your knowledge is a common enough occurrence for you to speak so casually to me about it, and then get surprised when I get upset? Did somebody slip you a moron potion as well?"
"Okay," he relents, lips quirking up into a tiny smile.
anything ever again. Draco was giving him his old self back and Harry wasn't quite sure how to thank him for it. And thanking Draco seemed like a brilliant idea. Immediately Harry began making a list of all the ways in which he could thoroughly thank the blond, but he heard quick steps and turned instead to face them, mentally vowing to come back to the list at a later point.
"Just get it over with already," Malfoy said quietly, voice small, and it was then that Harry noticed that, despite the bravado and perceived resignation to his fate, Malfoy's fingers were trembling where they rested on his knees.
Fenrir said nothing.
"No detail in an investigation is unimportant," Hermione told him. "Especially the time frame."
But trying to picture Bellatrix in her bedroom, doing normal things like brushing her hair and sleeping, were all far too out of place and made Harry's skin crawl attempting to imagine it. He could imagine her killing and maiming and screaming with mirth at the sight of blood, but the thought of her having somewhere she was comfortable enough to lower her guard and actually sleep made his head spin. He did not want to think of her doing normal things like brushing her teeth and preparing for bed, because she was not a normal person. She was evil, and Harry did not like seeing anything to counter that fact. And he did not like to think about her sleeping in her enormous bed in her enormous room of the enormous mansion that she had lived in. For some reason, it was much more disconcerting to picture that than the uncountable acts of violence she had committed whilst alive.
"So, Potter," Blaise continued, turning to Harry. "Let's get this over with now then, just so it's out of the way."
"Well, you hadn't!" Malfoy snapped. "You had no idea who was behind this until Cyril Crabbe was literally standing right in front of you!"
to coach the younger boy and he
A moan escaped Malfoy as he began to back Harry up, the two of them stumbling along together until they had found the nearest wall and Harry's back was pressed up against it. Malfoy tore his mouth away from Harry's to suck a trail of kisses down his throat, making Harry pant and squirm.
on Draco, let alone hands.
," he pleaded, bending both knees and lifting them to his chest.
Closing his eyes with another groan, Harry bent his head forward to press a kiss to Draco's mouth, deepening it as the blond moaned breathlessly. He could feel the heat building within him, even though it felt like it had only been seconds that he had been touching Draco. Eyes snapping open, he reached over to catch Draco's wrists in both hands, pinning them to the bed as he moved faster against the writhing blond, hearing a low growl issue from his own throat as Malfoy broke the kiss with a sharp cry, back arching as Harry suddenly felt warm liquid on his stomach.
Pansy laughed. "Oh don't worry, Tracey did. Blaise was about a second away from thumping Theo when Theo dared Daphne to wank him off, so he backed down from her and instead turned to Tracey and pretty much demanded that she let him touch her tits." Pansy grinned widely at the memory. "And Tracey stands up without a word and walks over to him and he starts getting all excited, thinking she's really going to let him do it—"
that?!"
"Oh really?" Harry asked in amusement. Had he really been wonderful? "Think about how I shag very often, do you?"
Grey light was flooding the room when Harry awoke, slowly blinking into a dismal morning of awareness drifting in through the windows. His arm was numb, and he gently pulled it free from where it lay trapped beneath Draco's sleeping body, shaking the pins from it and flexing his tingling fingers before rolling onto his side to observe Draco sleeping. The man lay facing him, both hands curled loosely atop the mattress. His breathing was deep and even but changing in a way that made Harry think he was going to wake any minute. His pale hair was fanned over his face, fluttering softly every time he exhaled.
"They loved helping out, it was the highlight of their day."
"Hey," Potter murmured, stroking Draco's jaw with gentle fingertips. "Look at me."
"God, I hope he actually shows up," Malfoy muttered to himself, sounding worried, and something about the sadness and the obvious anxiety in his voice tugged at Harry's heartstrings, making him momentarily soften toward the blond.
Seek was waiting for him, and Draco couldn't wait to see the man.
Draco took a deep breath. "Harry Potter is in love with me."
"I…" He clears his throat. "I'm bringing this back." He waves the folder in the air and crosses the room to place it on the stack of parchment before me.
! And you should be happy
Double p.s. Just in case any of you were wondering, the title of this story is taken from a poem by my most darling and beloved Miss Emily Dickinson. And if any of you lovelies have read my first mystery, I know you know just how much I treasure and adore that brilliant woman and her brilliant, gloomy brain.
Harry shook his head. "It's not your fault, Draco. You had nothing to do with it and you have nothing to be sorry for. I know exactly whose fault it is." His words had taken on a biting tone and Draco lifted his head to peer at him.
"And, Harry," she continued, the expression on her face somehow becoming even more stern, "I know you're angry, but please don't take it out on him."
"What does that mean?" Harry asked slowly, struggling to understand. "It
"Daphne," Draco repeated in a daze, feeling numb shock course through every inch of his frozen body. How was Daphne standing before him, without a scratch on her? She was dead! Draco had heard her die! He had been right there and he had fucking
"You couldn't like him then," she said wisely. "Not as he used to be. He had to first change into the type of person you could love."
the bloody fucking
"Good morning, Draco!" Blaise beamed, and Draco glared harder when he noticed the other boy was already dressed. Lord, his friends were aggravating. Blaise should not already be out of bed, and he certainly should not already be so damn happy. It was clearly not a day for happiness.
"Don't I?" Draco's eyes flashed as he stepped closer. "Do you think it even FUCKING compares to how sorry I was?!" Anger pounded through him in hot spikes, fury crackling along the length of his body like burning embers. "Sorry for TRUSTING you!" He shoved Blaise away from himself, not caring if he was shouting. After what Blaise had done to him, the man was lucky Draco was not cursing him into tiny jagged pieces. "Sorry for allowing you into my LIFE!" He took a step forward and shoved Blaise again. The man did nothing to fight him, only caught his balance as he stumbled back several steps. "Sorry you ever made me feel…" The words trailed off into a broken gasp.
"They would never have just left without saying something to him!"
As Malfoy moved faster and faster, Harry felt his thighs start to tremble, his entire body quivering as he felt the familiar heat of release building within him.
It showed him already waiting in the Charms classroom next to Zabini and Parkinson. Tucking the Map back inside his bag, he hurried to the room, praying earnestly for the opportunity to force Malfoy to listen.
"God,
"Contact me the instant you know anything," Draco said in a low voice, gazing at Wisp through narrowed eyes.
The sobs continued, gaining in volume. Draco knew from his experiences talking about the war with Pansy that sometimes retelling a trauma could be even harder than going through it, especially when not protected by the shock that sometimes accompanied such situations.
Her eyes narrowed. "Draco, you get ten points."
Pulling back, Blaise fixed him with an incredulous look. "Are you fucking serious, Draco? You're stopping
The three syllables reverberated around Draco's shocked skull, freezing him to his chair. How was that true? How could that be?
Or maybe he really was just drunk.
"You all right, Harry?" a voice asked to his left.
But the Dursleys were gone and Harry no longer had to see them ever again if he chose not to. He had not seen any of them in years and felt no desire to break that record. Maybe one day he and Dudley might exchange Christmas cards, but that was all the contact Harry could picture any of them ever having.
"I should get back to work," Granger's voice seemed to sound out of nowhere, startling the blond. He had all but forgotten about her, lost in his own woolgathering.
"I'll be okay." He had Seek, after all. "I better get back though so he knows everything is fine. I love you, Tracey. Pansy too."
"I'm saying we'll then know for a fact that this is about us as a group and not them as individuals," Malfoy said dryly. "Two is coincidence, but three makes a pattern."
Weasley flushed slightly as he tightened his hold on Granger.
"You'd be surprised at what people are capable of, Anthony," Harry said quietly.
"I haven't been hiding," Draco responded honestly. Avoidance and hiding were not the same things. Draco had heard Potter loud and clear the night of the Hospital Wing—he would not be the Gryffindor's newest charity case. Potter's need to save everyone he encountered would not extend to Draco just for the sake of it.
Averting his gaze, Harry nodded, remembering the choking, strangled feel of the air, the way his lungs had refused to draw breath, leaving him nearly gasping.
"Do either of us have to be the stupid one?" Draco asked with a gentle smile. Potter was pink-cheeked and fidgety, and it was surprising how sweet he could be when he was nervous.
But there was nothing to detect. There was no one to be found.
At the question, the man's eyes hardened. "Getting something that belongs to us," he said in a voice as hard as his gaze.
Unable to resist the temptation any longer, Harry reached up to brush the hair from Draco's forehead, smiling as he did so and allowing himself, at least in the privacy of his own mind, to admit that Draco Malfoy really was an intriguing mystery.
"But YOU fucking did!" Harry shouted, taking one step forward as he tried to push the searing reminder of his uselessness and many failures from his mind. "You knew all along and you said nothing! You knew who was responsible and you could have done something about it from the start! Daphne fucking DIED and you still said NOTHING! Daphne died because of YOU! You left us all stumbling around in the dark like fucking
Remaining silent, Draco didn't move. He stared at the ground with red cheeks and downcast eyes, fingers locked tightly together.
"I've known him for ten years," was the simple reply. It felt odd, to think that Harry had known Draco Malfoy for ten years, practically half his life.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry's lips twitched as he shook his head. "You really are such a wanker."
"Oh, sod off," Harry sighed, rubbing his eyes. "He's impossible to find out on his own now, you know that. None of the Slytherins wander about on their own anymore. And just because I'm stuck having to talk to him doesn't mean I want to talk to the rest of them. We had a
"I'm not saying they're not," Blaise said with a shrug. "But I'm telling you that Potter is the type of person who would willingly allow himself to be hurt before allowing anybody he cared about to be hurt. Were you not there when he walked into the fucking Forbidden Forest to
"You only earned
"And extreme dickheadery," Blaise muttered.
"Well," said Hermione in a troubled tone, "that's not quite true. It's more what we
In which moods are chaotic, denial is demolished, reintroductions are made, and guilt is experienced. And content is adult.
"I already said that you look good in green once, I won't say it again," Malfoy flushed.
There was silence for several moments before Malfoy scoffed loudly. "Well, that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard, surely you don't actually believe that, Harry?"
fall in love with the Death Eater son of Lucius Malfoy if not for the use of Dark magic.
Keeping his movements as unhurried and even as possible, Draco began to slowly rock his hips, sliding deeper and deeper in gradual increments and forcing himself to keep to a slow pace, determined to take his time and do this right. All the while his lips stayed locked with Harry's own, one hand tangled in the man's black hair while the other squeezed between their bodies to wrap around Potter's cock, stroking lightly in distraction as the blond continued to slide deeper inside the man.
"Well, shit," Ron said, kicking the nearby wall. "This whole thing is always gonna be one step forward, two steps back, isn't it?"
"Oh, good," Harry smirked, tugging on the robes covering Draco's chest and slipping one finger through the gap between fabrics to stroke Draco's bare skin lightly. "Well, look at the two of us with all our work finished, left alone together with nothing to do."
"Listen to me, Draco!" he requested, holding tightly to the other boy until he stilled. It took a bit longer than Harry thought it would and he was even more grateful for the massage the night before; his shoulder no longer hurt at all and he was able to hold Draco much more securely.
Blaise's smile widened. "Coming from you, Draco, I'll take it."
Unable to fight the damned tears slipping from between his clenched eyelids, Draco ducked his face beneath the searing flow and tried to tell himself it was simply water, he was not crying. He was fine. He had always been fine and he would continue to be fine. A gasp tore itself from his throat and before he knew it he was crying, properly crying, gasping and sobbing and shaking, and he could no longer tell himself that it was simply the water from the shower wetting his cheeks.
Secondly, the length of this story has been mentioned to me by quite a few of you, and I'm sorry that I am unable to answer in specifics. In all honesty, I never really know how long my stories are going to be. I never plan a set length, what I write is what I write. If anybody hasn't guessed it by now, this story is going to be a long one. If I were to guess, I would put the remaining length at somewhere around eight or nine or so chapters still to go. But who knows! It could literally be any number! I know the story is already pretty long and slightly detailed, but I swear I don't do it on purpose just to drag it out.
So much had changed since his childhood.
It was supposed to be easy; it was supposed to fun, simple, relaxed. It was supposed to be a year of school, Harry's final year—his
"Do you fancy me?" Harry interrupted, cutting the other boy off.
"Nah, he works in the lab. Cae's a Tracer," the brunet informed him. "Fucking brilliant one, too. If anyone's gonna solve this, it's gonna be Cae."
"No," Malfoy said sarcastically, rolling his eyes. The
At the sound of his name, Malfoy's eyes widened as a fusillade of emotions flickered across his face, much too quickly for Harry to be able to name any of them, and he wondered if Draco was feeling the same sort of hurricanic inner turmoil that he himself was. "I…I wanted to say…" Draco hesitated, continuing to take small steps forward and gradually lessening the distance between the two boys.
"I'm glad that you're okay," Harry interrupted, cutting Malfoy off before he could either scold or insult the brunet. "I was worried."
"He, uh, well, he kissed me," Harry admitted, rubbing the back of his neck.
Draco said nothing, collapsing against Harry's chest in an embrace that sent Harry's heart pounding. Draco was now his—he was now Harry's responsibility. He was Harry's to care for, to protect, to make happy. Harry was nowhere near perfect, but for Draco, he would try.
Justin was nowhere to be seen.
"Well," Nott drawled, "I for one have no problem thinking he could be the one behind it all. If we do end up finding him, what exactly do the super Aurors have planned for the prat?"
"Hey, I expect to be paid back for all of this," Blaise said seriously, and Draco rolled his eyes. "I don't mean in Muggle money, pay me back in Galleons, obviously."
"We should go get set up now then," Hermione spoke up, still on her feet. "If anybody would like to wash up before bed, please do so now, but make sure you have at least one other person with you at all times."
"You too," Pansy said, sounding close to tears. She reached out for Tracey's hand, who did not hesitate to take it. The two women walked to the nearby car, staring up at the clubhouse for the last time before looking away. They shared a single lingering kiss before Tracey left Pansy's side to walk around to the passenger side, opening the door and climbing in. Pansy waved sadly at Draco before climbing into the driver's seat and starting the engine. The headlights flared to life, startling Draco with the unexpected brightness.
Potter's dark head bobbed in a serious nod before he kissed Draco again. "Maybe we should sit back down to talk." He pressed a kiss to Draco's lips and chuckled into it. "In separate chairs. I seem to have a problem concentrating on anything else when I'm touching you." The words caused within Draco a surge of both fierce joy at Potter's confession and a swell of disappointment at the thought of separating his body from the man's.
"And in what way exactly did the two of you enjoy yesterday?" Malfoy asked coldly, arms folded tightly across his body and grey eyes staring at Harry with disdain.
"Was it not enough, having only me and Zabini interested? Was it not enough
"Did you get it too?" Harry demanded. "In the post?"
be an idiot."
"There are always other body parts we could discuss, Weasley," Pansy smirked.
"It doesn't look like noth—"
"Draco," he murmured, releasing the other boy's arms in order to tangle his fingers lightly in Malfoy's silky hair. "I just…" he hesitated. How would his worries be received? Would Malfoy scoff? Laugh in his face? Confirm them and hurt him even more? Maybe this had been his real evil plan all along—seduce Harry into realizing his feelings for the Slytherin, leave him hurting and alone, then convince him to lower his guard once more before shattering him forever. It was an undeniably evil plan. Harry wanted to trust Malfoy, he really did, but would he be able to? Would he ever be able to truly trust Draco Malfoy?
And, if he was being even more honest with himself, he was terrified of Fenrir's retaliation. What if he tracked Draco down? What if he found him? What would he do to him? What would he do to Seek? Oh, god. Just the thought of Fenrir hurting Seek made Draco's stomach twist with nausea. No, Seek couldn't be hurt. Draco couldn't do anything that would lead Wolf straight to Seek's door.
but being with Draco made him feel complete in ways he had never imagined, filling empty slots within himself he had not even known he had been missing.
A toothy grin spread across Wisp's face, as though the name he was about to speak was giving him joy in its absolute impossibility. Who had been visiting Cyril for months? Who had broken him out? Who in the entire world wanted him free and for what purpose? The force of the questions swirling through Draco's mind threatened to overwhelm him completely.
Draco's eyes widened in surprise a moment before Seek bent forward to press a warm kiss to his mouth, and Draco didn't even think, he just responded. He parted his lips and pressed back, clutching at the leather cut hanging from Seek's broad, muscled shoulders. Oh god, the man felt amazing pressed against him like that. Seek pulled him closer, kissed him harder, but still held him so gently, in a way that Draco could not ever remember Fenrir holding him. It felt good—it felt
Nearby, Malfoy was shooting Zabini a vicious glare, and Harry had no idea what was happening.
Draco jerked one shoulder in reply, still not saying anything.
"No, Padma!" he said angrily, still glaring at the Slytherins. "Someone killed him. It was someone in this room! And they're the only ones capable of something like that!"
"It's okay, I know what you meant," Ron said in a normal tone, but Harry noticed a pink flush spreading along the tips of his ears and decided to steer the conversation away from Ginny.
But the blond only craned his neck and peered down the corridor, confusion creasing his forlorn face, and it was at that moment that Harry noticed the bruises. Malfoy's eyes were puffy and swollen, and Harry would have believed it was from the tears still streaking his pale face if not for the large purple tinges coloring the very cheekbones that Harry had been unwillingly admiring only just a few days ago. As Harry continued to stare, Malfoy lifted a hand and placed it gingerly against his ribcage, wincing as he inhaled. His lip was split and eyebrow bloody as he gave up on looking down the corridor, leaning his head back to rest against the wall, and even in the dim lighting, Harry could see dark finger-shaped bruises outlined on the Slytherin's slender throat. The sight made Harry's heart constrict painfully in his chest.
Glaring, he reached over for the half-full bottle of vodka when a sudden noise made him pause. It was the distant revving of a single engine, and Draco lowered the bottle in confusion, wondering if anyone from the club had come back. They had only been gone a quarter of an hour or so, they should not be back for at least another hour. He cocked his head, creeping over to the door to peer out at the empty yard. There was nobody there. Not a single motorcycle was left, and Draco did not see anybody approach.
I crushed Blaise beneath an iron fist of wit and you're only awarding me five points for my triumph?"
It didn't take much small talk for Draco and Ron to discover a shared love of chess, a passion of Ron's that Hermione and Harry could only be thankful to now be spared. Ron summoned his set from the dorm and they immediately set up a game, arguing heatedly over who would be white. Draco won and smugly made the first move.
him of things that weren't even true just wasn't
The soft sound of a doorknob turning and the door to the dorm being pushed open pulled Harry from his spiral of painful, confused, contradictory thoughts. Rolling his head to the side, Harry watched Ron and Hermione enter, both staring at him before exchanging a glance. They strode over to sit side-by-side on the bed next to his, both gazing at him with concern.
Draco rolled his eyes. "Yeah? Is that why you're with Wire? Because of his nice tits?"
Draco tore himself away with a gasp, stumbling back as he raised one hand to his mouth in shock, eyes as wide as saucers as he stared at Seek. "Do you have some sort of death wish or something?" he whispered, feeling his heart hammering fiercely. "Kissing me like that, breaking into their compound, stealing Wolf's truck…are you trying to get yourself killed by the entire sodding gang?"
"Right," Malfoy said, turning away from the sight.
Turning to stare at him, Malfoy smiled. "I've known Weasley just as long as you have, Potter," he said, not unkindly. "I do recognize the sound of his voice, and I did sit exams fifth year." He shook his head with amusement. "I do remember seeing the Patronuses you had taught all your little army."
But Draco shoved the thought away, reminding himself about his promise to his own mind not to allow it to wander along that particular path.
"Blaise is in the north tower…" Draco hinted, pressing a kiss to Harry's chin, and Harry grinned.
"Draco?" a soft voice asked, and Draco glanced up into Seek's eyes, wondering why he was feeling so panicked over such a simple question. "Draco," he said again, resting one hand against Draco's nape. "Relax, babe, what's the matter? You look like you're expecting me to hit you if you don't get the answer right or something." The words were so close to the truth that Draco felt his eyes widen in response.
"You looking for Harry?" The question was innocent enough, but for one wild minute, Draco's palms broke out in a sweat at the thought that Weasley might possibly suspect his growing attraction to Potter. But the redhead kept speaking and the few seconds of panic passed. "He stepped out for a minute, but you can wait for him if you want." The words were accompanied by a gesture toward the desk at the other side of the room.
"You are so fucking hot, Draco," the brunet groaned, licking over a large patch of skin before breathing hotly over the area, earning a shiver from Draco in response. "
He pulled the letter from the envelope and unfolded it to find thin slanted writing belonging to Wisp. The letter was short.
"You do realize that it doesn't actually make anything true just because you say it, darling," she pointed out, still sounding far too cheerful for Draco's liking. "Besides, I knew that if there was any chance of anyone getting to manipulate Harry Potter into a snog, you would be the first to take it."
Harry nodded again, wandering back in the direction he had come from. He took another swallow of lager, wondering if it was the alcohol that was making his mind feel fuzzy, or if it was the lingering memories of blond hair and soft lips.
idea how many people have tried to—and then for him! In such a fucking way! For him to—" he broke off, breathing heavily. "How am I meant to forgive such a thing?" he asked quietly, turning his face away.
at the time—!"
"Okay, I'm taking points
And now he was responsible for four more deaths as a result.
"I'll be safe tomorrow," Draco whispered, wishing Seek was there to wrap his arms around Draco and tell them that everything would be okay, they would both be okay.
?" At the accusation, Draco flinched and Harry laughed, a sharp laugh of bitter disbelief. "You hired your own sodding fucking Tracker to hunt down Crabbe, is that it?" Ice had settled into Harry's veins, into his heart, into his words. "You don't trust me to do my job at all, do you? You have absolutely no faith in me."
"Er, are you saying that you define yourself by your tits?" Weasley asked in disbelief.
"Why not?" asked Draco before he could stop the words. What was that supposed to mean?
"I've been wondering that myself," she said grimly. "But honestly, I think it's better to remain as a group. That way, at least we know where everybody is. We'll have at least two of us keeping watch at all times, and we can rotate through sleeping shifts. I doubt that anyone here is going to get very much sleep, regardless."
Sighing internally, Draco stepped forward into a sharp twist and felt the familiar uncomfortable squeeze always accompanying Apparition. The view of the crumbling shack vanished to reveal the pale walls of his sitting room, dazzling sunshine streaming in through the windows and reflecting off the yellow of the walls and impossible whiteness of the furniture.
"He's been stabbed," Harry told them quickly. "He's already lost a lot of blood. Take him to St. Mungo's with Ron, hurry!" One Auror peeled himself from Ron's side before sprinting forward to support Neville as gingerly as he could, two cracks resounding through the rain-drenched air as the guard vanished with the two injured Aurors.
Draco shot him a withering look. "I'm very well aware of that fact. I have Muggle money, of course."
"Harry has done nothing but love me," Draco shook his head, refusing to be intimidated by the broken shell of a man before him, "
The three Slytherins exchanged a significant look.
Shrugging, Draco took another bite, chewing as he thought over his response. "I dunno. I just don't really associate it with bikers. None of the D.E. knows how to cook. That sort of thing is always left up to the property vests and hangarounds."
"Yes," Draco agreed, "and I'm clearly the more terrifying one out of the two of us. Fear me, Blaise. It's the best advice I can give to you."
And maybe it wasn't Harry Potter that he needed. Maybe it was just Harry. Maybe for the first time, he would truly be allowed to be just Harry. Ever since he had set foot in the wizarding world, he had been Harry Potter: the Boy-Who-Lived. Even with Ron and Hermione, in ways. They had both met him knowing exactly who he was. Hell, they had both met him knowing so much more about his own life than he himself had. He had been Harry Potter to them first—the Boy-Who-Fucking-Lived.
"Please, Potter," he said quietly, his entire body suddenly relaxing in a way that confused Harry for all of two seconds, until Malfoy finished speaking and all Harry was left with was a feeling of horrified dread burning through his chest, "please. Just finish it already. I would honestly rather it be you than some angry, faceless stranger whom I've never met before but still blames me for their every misfortune.
To his surprise, the flames spat him out onto a large hearth dwarfed beneath an enormous fireplace. The fireplace was carved entirely out of bone-white marble, stretching upward into pillars and smooth columns. It was tall enough to stand in comfortably and wide enough to fit several people in at the same time. The mantle was an enormous slab of stone above Harry's head, holding several more identical marble pillars that stretched all the way up to the ceiling. The room was paneled in dark wood, with several paintings of ancestors blinking disdainfully down at him from the walls. A long table was spread before the empty fireplace with a number of straight-backed chairs lining both sides. Dangling directly over the center of the table was a large chandelier. Glancing upward, Harry could see patterns and designs carved into the high ceiling stretched what seemed like miles above his head. The floor was a wood so dark it was nearly black, and Harry suddenly realized with a jolt of fear what room he had ended up in. The only other room in the Manor he had been in before two weeks ago—he was in the drawing room.
"And thank you, by the way," she continued, as though determined to see Draco struck mute forever, but this time, the words made his lips unstick to ask a question.
"Yeah," Harry chuckled, "we both live alone, but my flat's about the size of your bedroom." Malfoy shot him an odd look, one eyebrow raised. "I mean, I'm assuming," Harry added hastily. "I've never actually seen your bedroom, but I'm guessing it's the same size as my flat. Probably even bigger."
be fooled?" His eyes were unfocused and Draco knew that Wisp was mostly speaking to himself.
"I just…" Harry paused to rake a hand through his hair, feeling well past awkward for what he was about to say. "I just wanted to say…that I'm sorry. About your dad."
"Learnt it from you, love," I grin, stepping back out of the range of another slap. Her lips twitch and she glares even harder.
"What happened?" he cried, taking in the man's appearance. Fenrir was covered in blood. One eye was swollen completely shut, he had a large, jagged gash stretched along his temple, his lip was badly split, and his cheeks and jaw were mottled in purple bruises.
Harry groaned. "We just spent
?" Unable to formulate a proper response, Harry could only gape in disbelief as strong, sticky fingers made of his own sudden and very well-justified anger gripped him tightly, paralyzing him in his seat and holding his entire body still. "You lying prat, I don't bloody
Pansy snorted loudly. "What kind of moron could bring Potter here without even fucking realizing it was Harry Potter they were bringing? I mean, that really is its own level of idiocy."
"Excuse you, Potter," Draco corrected, "we are
Draco nodded, chewing one fingernail as he glanced around the clubhouse. Only about half the members were there. A small group of men stood clustered around a pool table, laughing at some joke. He could hear a motorcycle revving in the yard outside and could see two prospects seated at the bar.
"So what does it do then?" Harry asked curiously in spite of himself. The potion was tangerine-colored and the steam it gave off almost crimson. Despite his conviction that the potion was to be used in some sort of nefarious plot he still had yet to figure out, he found himself intrigued.
"Yes. Obviously. They adore putting picnics together. It's their favorite thing in the world."
"No!" Draco gasped, feeling his eyes prick with tears, threatening to spill over and run down his cheeks. Oh god, what was Greyback going to do to him? "Please, Fen, I promise!"
"All right, fine," Blaise said, sitting up and sounding determined. "When are you meeting up with him?"
"It's okay, Blaise," Draco wept, vision clouded with tears. "It's okay! Just please, please snap out of it!"
Pansy snickered and leaned closer to show Blaise a letter, the long strands of her dark hair brushing the bare skin of his arm and making him shiver. The warmth of her body was making his heart pound faster, not quite touching but close enough to almost feel. He swallowed, feeling the blood pooling in his face, cheeks turning red at the sound of her soft laughter.
