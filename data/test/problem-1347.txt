"So, what now?" Harry asked the quiet room, noticing the tinge of another daybreak through Draco's kitchen windows. It was that liminal time between days, the time they used to share solely while panting, skin slipping against one another's sweat, Draco handsy and talkative and Harry sated and scared for the messy ball of emotions fast developing. And now they were here, no rules, no clear boundaries.
Harry sat up halfway, the muscles in his core screaming at him not to bother, and then lay back again. He folded his hands over one another in the centre of his chest.
“It’s a wizarding house, Potter. If it’s treated like it's a dull, unloved thing, it’ll act like one. But show it a little kindness, and it’ll show you a good time. Speaking of," Draco put his drink down and licked his lips, leaving them shiny and pink, "if you show me a good time, I'll come back. I could probably get it to re-do the wallpaper for you." He wiggled his eyebrows suggestively over the top rim of his glasses.
himself, but he's decided being loaded and bitter is good enough, and for what, honestly?" Ron sunk his face in his hands and exhaled.
like a hail mary during that fateful spat in the kitchen of Grimmauld. He’d already packaged them up alongside his final letter, to be sent with a family owl the following morning. He’d shared a draft of it with Hermione for her help revising his grammar, and it had left her stuffy with unspent tears. Harry had to believe that it was enough. His heart ached, and his stomach roiled when he thought about those notes, all that emotion normally bottled up, splashed so openly on the page, so he tried his best not to think about it at all. The quidditch helped, though once it was gone he knew he'd need some new thing to preoccupy his time.
"Did you really date?" Harry tugged Draco's hands more tightly around him. He was curious, though the tug of sleep also threatened to pull him under any minute.
Harry sent a note via Floo back to Tom to ask if there was anything he could dig up from St Mungos or the Ministry. A hospitalization would do, or some minor infraction. Gertie returned with a sheepish note from the assistant that his contacts hadn't been able to come up with anything, but would Mr. Potter like him to begin with bribes, and if so, would one hundred Galleons suffice as a starting bid for information?
“Not on paper,” Draco said, and Harry started to see what he was getting at. “Not how it counts if we were to...”
"Oh, I'm well aware," Draco drawled, masterfully keeping from showing how the airing of their recent dirty laundry definitely freaked him out. He drew snickers from the opposite side of the table as Harry sunk into his chair, a burning flush erupting up his neck. "I can good as see straight through that Invisibility Cloak."
"I am!” He pushed back from the table, subconsciously crossing his arms, on the defensive. “I figured, my hair is behaving and I
"No room for sleep in that schedule." Jacqueline faced Harry and scanned him again. She thought he was worthy of a second look, then. "Or a personal life, which means no time for
Draco was eager to. What Harry had thought to be a chart was revealed as a calendar, with new pluses and minuses planned for each day, only in this version, the final tally steadily went up, up, up. The entire next page was a list of rules, some of which were obvious, and some so minute, Harry couldn't believe that one person could keep track of such minutiae in their mind at any one time. Certain foods previously eaten in groups of three could now be done in sixes. Things once forbidden were allowed, albeit rarely. Black coffee could go milky, with
"Would you still want me, if it weren't for this, do you think? For the games, you know—without the sex."
Draco was a nerd—a terrible, irrepressible, verging-on-mad-scientist level nerd—and even the loss of his apprenticeship and the 9-to-5 position that went along with it wasn't enough to keep him from reaching for more knowledge. Harry had picked up that his work was on water purification and synthesis, but Draco didn't regale him with much in the way of explanations beyond that. He was out of the house more often too, running even in sleet, and dancing, Harry had learned, though doing exactly what kind and when was sort of an enigma. His was frenetic energy, and Harry slowed in the face of it.
“S’okay though, don’t worry bout anything,” he added, patting Draco’s shoulder. He was nice and warm and so inviting to be slept on. “You need it, I’ll get it for you. Always. Easy.”
. But that was when he saw it, the diamond in the muck. He sat up from his relaxed pose, laying flat against the long bench that had once held half the Order over busy supper times. He absentmindedly brushed crumbs from his t-shirt as he re-read the words—the bacon sarnie had been eaten after all.
"Drop it. I will, thank you," Harry breathed and held his eyes. They were there, in the bed, doing this. It was incredible and so unbelievably
Being used like this. To be dirty, sucking and gagging with the sweetest yet filthiest things being whispered, just for him. Only for him. To be a slut for someone who appreciated it. Who loved, if not him, at least what he could give them. And who better than Draco to give him that?
“I’m not sad, you berk, I—" he sighed, and wrested an arm free to hook around Harry’s shoulders. He touched his hair, the most soothing of gestures, and kept on petting it flat, though of course it never worked.
"I think it's a grand idea, Harry," he said quietly, nudging until Harry was splayed out on his back on the bed. He lay on top of him as he had so long ago, aligning their fingers and toes as best he could, his live, naked weight a balm to Harry's nerves. A warm, beautiful blanket; a person and a place where Harry could go to feel safe and loved; acres of softness to make wet with open-mouthed kisses, and hard planes, bones stronger than stone, and magic, deep, roiling, eternal.
“There’s you, needing this thing only I can give you. It’s only me, and you know it! For a Gryffindor—”
Harry knew he was smiling strangely. It felt funny on his face and he touched his own cheeks like he had to be sure the feeling was true.
"What was that?" Draco asked. Harry followed him a few steps until they were protected from the oncoming downpour by the moss-covered awning of a vintage clothing boutique, both of their eyes still glued to the high heel. It started to smoke, and Harry looked away. He should feel embarrassed, but the only burning in him remained rage.
Harry exited the club with his jacket retrieved and spotted an elegant line leaning against the wall across the street, cigarette dangling from his lips. Harry walked over, shaking his head in disbelief.
Draco waved him off with a gentle motion of his fork. He wasn't really listening anymore. He was somewhere else behind his eyes.
"Not running today," Draco mumbled, frowning down at the page. Harry peeked—it looked like long division. He settled back into the pillows stacked behind him—there wasn't a chance in hell he'd be able to figure it out, not upside down, without his glasses on.
Harry, for one, was agog. His throat was tight with emotion, touched by the thoughtfulness of it all—Draco had remembered Harry’s nervous rambling, all these long months later. His mouth opened, and his jaw moved, but he couldn't say a thing.
"Don't you wonder where it's all coming from?" Harry asked, trying to mask his rising hysteria in the face of so many
"I won't make good company," Harry said. His throat hurt from the want of a scream or a cry. He wanted the whisky, but did he want it more than he wanted Draco?
Ron nodded along. The mead was loosening everyone up—Andromeda and Mrs Weasley were engaged in a conversation down the other end of the table, and Hermione tried to be subtle while checking in on Angelina's well-being, considering her husband's early departure from the table. Harry worried that he’d been gone so long—it was unusual, even for him at his lowest to abandon mealtime like this.
this morning. And I still have to have breakfast, which, may I remind you," he crooked a finger to point at Harry, "I don't have an elf to cook for me."
"Thank you," Harry said. He didn’t know why, but he felt like Draco had given him some sort of gift. Draco shook his head.
He finally removed the sunglasses, aware that it was a tad too much the mark of a spoiled brat to continue wearing them inside, no matter his anxieties.
"What are we talking about?" Percy stopped, halfway out of his chair, having said his goodbyes and preparing to leave to find where his girlfriend had absconded to. "Did someone say Toulouse? Now, the Basilica of St. Sernin, wasn't I just telling you about Romanesque architecture—"
"Books. Trust me, don't forget," Ron pointed at him, making quick work of the stairs. "None of that depressing shit either, something stupid! Quidditch Weekly!"
Beyond that, he needed the break. The gruelling hours required for physical and magical combat training, rigorous studies (made all the more puzzling considering he never had the chance to finish seventh year) and his charity and government work nearly ruined him. While still a teenager, he hired a tutor, a PR manager, legal counsel and a stylist, and even with Kreacher cooking meals and taking up the tidying, it wasn't enough.
"I said, it's not going to be necessary," he said firmly. He didn't know why he was suddenly so sure that Malfoy wouldn't let the whole debacle slip, if only to his own friends, but his gut told him that he wouldn't. "Don't worry about it. I told Ron and Hermione the details—"
Harry powered on, feeling like a naughty child forced to explain himself to an adult, like he was waiting for his punishment to be doled out, only he hadn't done anything wrong. It choked him up, how much it reminded him of begging his Aunt and Uncle not to be cross with him when he was a boy.
"Those boys, they're the tip of the iceberg. There are all sorts. The sort who pretend they're not looking to be sucked off in an alley, even if they surely fucking are, and will accept, and then punch you in the face for the pleasure. They pretend that they're not like us, that they wouldn't be caught dead within ten feet of us. They can't, for whatever reason, admit it. They have to make sure that they're not femme at all, as though that's what makes it worse. The moment we stop trying so hard to hide, they know."
"Don't! Just—don't." He slashed his arms through the air. "My—" he gestured to his hips, "you know! The thing, my—
"The bar must have been exceptionally low for a cocktail to have this kind of effect on you," Draco said.
"And now I know all about this and look, look! I'm still here! I'm not going anywhere, there's nothing about you I'll ever find too much, or disgusting. You do not, cannot disgust me," Harry said, and Draco's eyelids lowered as he looked away, like he was ashamed to hear that. Harry knew that feeling, of it being too much when someone said
"And I'm not enough," he said. He turned away, clenching his eyes tightly together. "Of course, I'm not. Who'd want me, right? Spoiled goods and all."
And there was no sex, not even the intimation of it. A preponderance of baggy shirts were pressed into service as Draco's chosen pyjamas, and his pants stayed on overnight. He disappeared behind a shower curtain in the mornings before Harry could see much of him, so though Harry could feel the ridges of his ribs through his nightshirts, he didn't see them anymore, couldn't tell if there were fewer to count now that Draco was eating three meals a day again, even if they were picked at and pushed around and left half-hidden in napkins.
The sun had been blazing in the sky for hours by the time Harry dragged himself from his bedclothes, but he didn't know it. There were no clocks in his bedroom at Grimmauld Place for good reason. He'd won the battle with Kreacher long ago to keep the curtains drawn—a Permanent Sticking Charm had been threatened, and Kreacher finally acquiesced to leaving them closed, if only in Harry's private spaces.
Harry took his hand, heart beating in his throat as the bass pounded ever louder, and pulled him up to stand. "Let's find out."
"You're right. He's not my son anymore," she said, so quietly that Harry held his breath to hear what she said next. "I'll grant him my maiden name to use, and you, my duties as an emergency contact."
"Is she going to be okay?" Harry asked. With this turn in the conversation to the personal, each new word felt like it had to be chosen carefully, like picking up a piece of glass. Touch one the wrong way, and you'd end up cut.
Harry pulled back to enjoy watching the effect of his words explode in the imagination of Draco. The moment of pique at being told to shut up, followed by the surprised inhale at the promise of that word. Of a
Draco stared at him in disbelief, eyes wide. "Are you kidding me?" He choked on a hollow laugh. "You're really going to ask how a pair of prepubescent boys could tell we're poofters? Do you actually live under a rock?"
Both of them stopped moving at all, dual deer caught in headlights. Harry was surprised at the words sneak-attacking him like that—he thought it would happen one day, sure, maybe, but also Draco's family didn't say it the way the Weasley's did, and Harry could
Hermione snorted into her glass of wine. "Cold feet," she said. She and Ron shared a knowing smile—they'd been committed to one another already for a quarter of their lives and hadn't ever faltered in their shared belief that they would continue in that vein till death did them part. Where Envy used to flare up, uninvited and bitter, Harry now had his own warm, wriggly feelings of forever to deal with. Marriage was a lost option to him—he'd known that he couldn't entrap Ginny into a false union, and it truly wasn't an option now that he was out and older, and legally couldn't.
Up and away from his heart. There should have been movement inside. Instead, lungs were levitated to the sides like grotesque wings, revealing a bloated purple mass where a beating heart should have been.
"No," Harry managed, clearing his throat. He didn't want to be trapped in his body anymore, wished that he could watch the scene from above. His voice barely felt like his own when he spoke.
"It's nothing, like I told you," he'd snapped, getting out of bed. "I don't remember. I'll start taking a low dose of Dreamless Sleep again myself, and then I won't wake you anymore."
"It's Hangover Cure, arsehole. I'm not trying to poison you at my place of work. I'm rather over the whole rivalry thing, I'll have you know." Harry knocked them back. The feeling of nausea rose to a fever pitch as the pain in his brain sharpened to a pick-axe point behind his left eye, so badly that he had to cover his mouth with a hand. Just as suddenly, the feeling seeped away. Other than a bit sweaty and overly cold, he suddenly felt fine.
But no. He'd made the moving, impassioned speech that people had come to expect of him. He'd left faces in the audience glistening with tears and was now often quoted at other graduation ceremonies across the globe.
Harry looked at him, his thickly freckled face, and felt the hollowness like a hole cutting directly through his torso. It was a wonder that nobody else could see it when he felt it so plainly.
"If there's one thing I've learned about you tonight, it's that you're untrainable in the art of dance."
"As long as you're there, it's good with me," Harry said, and he swore he saw the side of Draco's mouth twinge with the threat of a smile as he Apparated them away.
"Mate, come on. How many times do you want to be Witch Weekly's Most Eligible Bachelor, eh? You do want to date, right?"
Draco leaned against the wall in the near darkness, arms crossed and with a little smirk on his face, as though this were the most natural place in the world to wait for somebody. A single pearl earring studded his right ear, and Harry's breath caught.
Harry blinked hard, switching the topic the way one switched a channel. He couldn't think about Draco right now. It was time to compartmentalize to make it through the meal.
Harry nodded mildly, and the sound that exited him when Draco slipped back inside his loosened hole was something of a sob. He felt like water itself, limbs useless, body moldable to the shape of its container. Harry wanted to be fucked by Draco forever if it meant they stayed connected this way. He felt like he could. Everything else in the world was blotted out—it was just them and this, the slick down his crack, the insides of his thighs sticky where they clamped around Draco’s body, the feeling of fullness, how pressure translated to radiant waves of pleasure. He was properly hard again too, each slap of their hips together a building of tension inside his belly, the nebulous place where his orgasm built. When he thought the feeling would plateau Draco adjusted the angle, checking in on the look on his face and the sound of his little grunts on each inward thrust until he smirked, proud of the sure signs that he'd found his prostate.
The wind whistled through a crack in a window frame, accentuating the silence that fell. Draco puffed, his grasp on normalcy loosening rapidly.
"Stop it—no, really, you've got to stop that!" Harry caught Draco by the chin and forced him to look at him. "You're smart and hard-working, and you're so stunning that I can hardly look at you most days without forgetting what I was going to say."
Draco's nostrils flared, but he didn't look up. Instead, he flipped the page he'd been scribbling on over, read something quickly, flipped it back.
"You're here because you think I don't know," he said, putting down his cup shakily. He probably had a headache and was covering for it, and Harry’s chest was tight with anger and confusion, and there wasn’t a minute for him to deal with that because now he had no clue what Draco was on about. Harry's head snapped between him and Bill, trying to decipher whatever secret language they had started speaking in.
Harry had expected to run into him again, sure, but as the week wore on with nary a piece of correspondence in the interim, he’d begun to think that their meetings had been a blip. Simply an odd couple of weeks fuelled by chance. He'd assumed that if he saw Malfoy at all again, it would be from a distance, his haughty laugh floating down to Harry from up on high.
Stalemate. It was clear now to Harry that Draco wouldn't answer a question unless it was asked outright. He wasn't going to freely admit to anything.
"Not just because he's your ex or anything. Separate from whatever happens between us, he's not good for you."
"I started brewing it for Pans, the wench," he answered from the other room. "She was going on about how great the pills are, but they're bog-useless—the actives in the recipe reduce in potency once dried. She's basically been flushing her coins down the toilet, buying as much as the stuff as she does."
"Okay." Harry closed his eyes to accept the kiss that accompanied his words. It was soft, almost chaste. Draco's palm cradled his jaw as he deepened the kiss, tongues meeting and probing further, and it was in this very delicate position that Harry heard the words that, in some ways, he'd been waiting with bated breaths for two months to hear.
"I'm trying my hardest to parlay my Bachelor's into a Mastery in potions, but that plan's all gone tits up now," Malfoy said simply.
that he somehow, through osmosis, knew the words to. It lasted until the gentleman at the cashier informed him that he best buy the hairbrush he'd been spit singing into or to move along. And while he wouldn't call the effort a lost cause, it seemed that Draco's store of smiles had been used up in the morning, and nothing Harry did in the shop could change that.
"Let me finish," he said, and Harry closed his eyes, awaiting whatever nasty thing Malfoy could think to hurl at him. "That was all very consensual back in there."
"I'd been meaning to ask my mum, but—" Draco broke off, shaking his head, lips curled in a smile that grew less believable by the minute. "I don't know why I'm surprised anymore, honestly. It's almost romantic, isn't it, the way she always picks him over me."
"Get out? Really?" Harry asked, following him out of the room. "Is that how you usually tell your guests to leave?"
Harry didn't even gasp. His shock was silent. Draco's tongue dipped in again, deeper. He was licking his come out of Harry's body. He wanted to; was enjoying it. Groaning into it; shifting closer when Harry instinctively flinched and drew away. Stopping; starting again, he nose bumping against Harry's body in his attempt to get closer, closer still.
The two of them made easy work of the stairs, or so Harry thought until he bungled the last step and quite nearly face-planted into the wall.
Collins lifted a hand to interrupt—broad, like the rest of his burly body. The man was built like a rugby player, hazel eyes livelier than the grey in his close-cropped hair and brows would make him seem. Strong, sharp, some years on the force under his belt.
"No," Malfoy's perfect eye-roll came out, and Harry caught himself happy to see it. He clearly hadn't grown out of getting off on riling Malfoy up.
"You should have an out that’s non-verbal. It can be difficult to speak anyway. What with the choking," he added and Harry gave a crooked smile, exhaling long and slow. Draco accepted what he’d said and moved past it, like his
Molly made a little sobbing noise, and Harry widened his eyes, though Ron only held his hands up, defeated before he'd even joined in on Harry's behalf.
Draco's voice rang clearly in Harry's mind, not the quiet remembrance he'd been living off of the past two days. It was wonderful to hear not the echo but the sound, even if it was—he wasn't sure what it was that they did with one another, exactly. Conversational Legilimency?
"You do what you've got to do. I'm going to get cleaned up and then we could order some takeaway. I wanted to try—" Draco snapped his fingers, searching for the word. Harry noticed, but his heart no longer stammered with a bit of pain during the wait. This was normal—their altered version of it. He summoned a pair of shorts from the closet of clean laundry, then a pair of trainers. He would sneak in some rowing—exercise kept him even amidst the chaos of daily life, and it was also helpful to enter the evenings exhausted.
"I work, Harry." Draco's voice interrupted the spiralling thoughts. "I’m up at five, I run, I work twelve, fourteen-hour days," Draco spoke evenly, returning to an even keel. "Every weekday but Thursday, I’m doing research in the lab well into the evening, and Saturdays are for my thesis. I have to work to live, I can’t—there’s close to nothing left in the bank. Enough to get by, but I’ll graduate in debt, and that’s fine, it is, really, but I need this job. When I’m not in the apothecary, I’m in the library, and if I'm not there, I'm in the lab, and on my off days, I have classes at the studio—"
Spin, spin, spin. The sun set properly and soon Ron lit a bonfire, flames electric blue at the tips and icy white in the centre, spewing warm air outwards. Harry wanted to ask when they'd be leaving for the bar—he wanted to stay sober as long as possible but was feeling sleepy already without the stimulation of movement, or food, or something.
Draco dragged his fingernails along the ridges of Harry's ribs, the muscles contracting at the touch.
Draco sighed into Harry's neck as he went boneless. Neither made an effort to move while they caught their breath, and Harry was happy to hold his weight and just be until Draco shivered harshly, sweat starting to cool. He sat up at last and tucked his cock back inside his pants, pulling his jeans up without zipping them.
"No, Ted, not Mr Brown. I rather think he's already married," he answered, and Harry turned back to the table full of puzzled faces with a smile in his heart rather than the jumbled feeling of worry that he thought he'd say the name with, and finally spoke the words aloud.
"Not that he needs me to defend his abilities, but he has made it his life's mission to provide a stable, caring home for children who need one. I can hardly think of a better candidate."
Harry skims his fingers over skin that is no longer scarred. Takes a forearm unbesmirched by ink and kisses it tenderly.
"Who’s in drag then?" Harry asked, and the slow, sly look Alex and Draco shared, followed by explosive laughter, didn't do anything to answer the question. Alex directed his wand at his bag and out levitated a slip of something shiny—silver fabric, and very little of it.
there was no way of that. Harry's imagination supplied thoughts of teeth and lips, and that pink mouth sucking around much more than a straw.
Draco closed the little gap of space between them so that they were toe to toe, hip to hip, resting one hand on the wall over Harry's shoulder.
"Thanks for leaving it out for me. I might honestly be dead without it." Harry gratefully took a bowl with shaky hands. Even with the potion, he was still delicate, studiously avoiding strenuous work and brightly lit rooms.
"Are you always up at the crack of dawn on a Sunday? Don't you ever go out?" The question was asked casually, and then, as though he remembered that he had to say something rude, Malfoy added, "You've got enough time to, what with your unemployment."
The thing that annoyed Harry the most during the hot, hazy days that followed—days spent avoiding Kreacher like the plague, reading up on the odd collection of books tucked into the shelves of Sirius' room, and wanking—the thing that really got his wand in a twist was how very little information there was on Malfoy to dig through. It just didn't make sense that there was
"What the fuck, Kreacher?" This was new and startling, and while not terrible (he had been boiling in the things), he would have preferred a warning before they were snatched from his body.
Ron pushed away from the table, his hands holding the edge of it as he screwed up the courage to say his piece. "Before anyone decides to have a go of it, know that Harry told Hermione and me months ago—"
"That's impossible, though." He swatted a hand between them. "Everyone has secrets. Even right now, how many more secrets would you say that you have from me?"
"Yes, I said it. Frankly, I can't believe all the missed opportunities we have to make advancements to our own society by incorporating their methods, and vice versa. Also, why can't we have telly? We could vastly improve telly, don't get me started."
Harry nodded, made a sound. He wanted to collapse onto the stairs, not climb them. It would be so good to be dragged down by feeling—to find a shirt of Draco's and breathe him in, assuming the worst from the floor of the study, preferably so drunk that he couldn't see.
needed sorting, but it was a lost cause. So, his reality was already set out for him to be the worst possible case: getting out and never returning.
"I bet that's why you fucked me through the headboard. So I wouldn't forget it." Harry opened his mouth to complain but stopped short. Draco's eyes lit up when Harry didn't scold him. He thought he was gaining the upper hand and clearly liked it.
tell me what to do about Draco," she hissed. "As soon as the Firecall came, I came. My son wouldn't be here if he wasn't consorting with you, and now who knows what's happened to him, pain potions are hardly doing a thing—"
“Hush now.” His voice carries and the shuffling stops. “Nearly supper time for my good boy, is it not?”
"You can find plenty of it in stores," Draco said dismissively. Harry gave a few slow nods. His eyes roamed Draco's face—everything about it seemed more explicit now that there were no wisps of hair to frame it. His skin was poreless, smooth porcelain, with those kissable, rose-stained lips and those haughty, almondine eyes, clear and cold and watching Harry, waiting—for what?
"What wouldn't I get?" Harry asked carefully. He took a swig of his drink and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. He hated this, hated the feelings Malfoy brought up.
Ron’s quiet was excused by the audacity of it. Harry knew he’d see it as a plan hatched alone, even though the three of them were never alone. Every night, Harry waited for the swish of a blanket pulling at worn carpets, and the telltale creak of the treads on the stair as they all found one another in the dark. Harry only found rest on the chesterfield in the front room; only slept when his fingers hung nearly to the floor but met the rise and fall of Ron’s back instead. Hermione tucked next to him on the pallet transfigured from a single feather.
, at least in the kitchen? Please," he amended, softening his tone. Kreacher gave him an apologetic look but returned his attention quickly to Draco.
"I’m so sorry," Hermione said quietly, putting the quill down, "really, Harry.” She gave him a bracing look to make up for her want to hug him again, but he was done with touch for the day. For the week, maybe.
Though he'd be the last to admit it, that stung. Victoria knew about Harry's childhood; that she so clearly didn't empathize was a bit of a kick in the teeth. The monster that lived way down deep at the bottom of the pit of Harry's fears perked up, sniffed the air. That she didn't care wasn't surprising—that no-one ever had or would care about him, not really—that was the pill he felt that he was continually finding new ways to swallow.
Draco closed his eyes, shifted his weight into his back foot, the better to lean away from Harry. As the warmth of the water leached from him, his cheeks passed from a wholesome pink back to the downy blue-white hue he'd taken on lately.
"That's what Hermione said." It took a second, but Ron cracked a little smile too. The water was still running, so Harry wasn't all there in the room with him, but he had enough wherewithal to add that he was sorry about what was happening.
"You look starry-eyed even with your eyes closed, Potter. It's about the only time other than when you're feigning a smile that your forehead isn't twinging into a frown, and don't bother trying to bluff with me about your counterfeit smiles. I've been in this business far too long to be fooled."
Ron scoffed, muttered, "Yeah, nothing serious at all," and shuffled on the spot, one leg jiggling. He was all nerves. Harry wished he'd sit down.
"You've been fibbing all this while?" Draco asked. He sat up and regarded Harry, who was glad beyond belief to see that his unshed tears were gone, and he looked—worn, but hopeful.
"Oh, pet." Draco purred the words, stopping on the threshold of the room for a beat before entering. When he got close, even the sight of his bare feet was a balm to Harry's vision; when he stood before him and pulled him close so that Harry's heavy head could rest against his thigh, his touch sent a violent shiver down Harry's spine.
He ripped the envelope open with his sore thumb. It held a single sheath of parchment, thick and smooth to the touch. The elegant, swooping script was familiar even after all the intervening years since school.
"Mmm, yes, perhaps it would be prudent to get Mr Sparks on standby. If there's going to be libel, we should draft some cease-and-desist orders." The edge of spite with which Draco said it was enough to get Harry to crack something like a smile. He needed Draco to be a fighter to make it through the oncoming storm.
"Uh, what—what's that potion for?" A flush spread across his chest at being caught so obviously staring. At least his hard-on had flagged in the bath, and he wasn't stood with a hard cock and a stammering mouth all at the same time.
"Take yours out now," he whispered, and Cissy obediently did. She was shaky now, cock filling out again, a thick bulge, wet spot growing.
“Mmmmm,” Harry answered. He had to sit up to try to stop the rocking. It was better than lying down, but only marginally. Who’d set the bed at such an angle, anyhow?
"I thought you were cutting back," Harry spoke under his breath. "And where are you getting Witch Weekly? I told Kreacher to trash any he sees."
"Yes, well, Draco, the poor thing, can't hold a tune to save his life, and is being far too polite to refuse the offer of a turn at it." Satisfied with the look of his shoes Blaise crossed over to Harry and thrust a hand into the cabinet behind him, plucking out three cold butterbeers, passing a pair of them to him. He lowered his voice and leaned in.
"Lastly, Harry would have called me a knob for doing this if he'd known at the time, and he'd have been right to," Draco turned to look at him again and Harry grinned, heart swelling in his chest. Draco finally cracked a nervous smile before looking to the little bag in his hands and tugging it open, pulling a cylindrical bottle of brown glass from it.
This was more like it. It was easier when it was all breath and tongue and teeth. In the dark, up close with no room for words and no space to see. Harry didn't want to have to use his words.
"Yeah," Ron answered for Justin Finch-Fletchley, clapping a hand on his shoulder and shaking him. "Ran into him on the way, figured it would be a good catch up. You ready to head out, Harry?"
Then, Draco gave him a carnal smile, tightened his grip around the base, and fully brought Harry's cock into his mouth.
"Alright, well, down to business," he said, clearing his throat. He cracked his knuckles, odd, something Harry hadn't ever seen him do before. "You asked about the sunglasses.”
They were silent for a while, watching foam build on the waves. Harry wondered if this was the part where he was supposed to say something deep and meaningful. The worry started to rise, so he took a chance and asked what was really on his mind.
"Bacon sarnie," Kreacher implored, pushing the plate closer to Harry's elbow, frowning as Harry sat with the magazine spread between his hands. "The Master's favourite."
"It's really something," she spoke slowly, tiptoeing. "I'm a little surprised that you were as candid as you were. Luna does find a way to get to the root of things, doesn't she? The photos are striking, it's—"
"Of course it is!" Harry exploded, and he was up, chest to chest with Ron, blood rushing in his ears. He felt as though he was vibrating.
“Please,” Malfoy pled. The word startled Harry from doing up the buttons to his coat. It wasn’t a word Malfoy used, and there was something about the sound of him begging that was so pure, it lit up Harry’s heart.
There were many stages, rooms for engaging in a variety of kinds of "play" in, and neon bartops slick with booze. They ran into Matilda and Blaise only once—one room had trance music playing, and the two of them were there to dance, nothing more, nothing less. Harry felt like a child at the zoo, eyes and ears absorbing everything. His usual panic didn't set in, likely due to the cavernous nature of the space—high walls painted black and wide-open doorways allowing for a constant flow of bodies from one space to the next. Harry was enraptured by all of it.
Harry watched as the smile drained from his face, knowing it was put on. There was tension around his clear grey eyes, and he looked pinched. Tired, especially for the morning. Everything seemed so calm on the surface, and he knew then that it was time, finally. The scrabbling thoughts were pushing at the lid of the box and it was getting hard to breathe again. He saw Draco's notes, the pluses and minuses, each time he closed his eyes.
"It's funny that it's only now that you care to pay attention to what's going on," he said one day, pulling at the skin beneath his eyes as he judged his skin's pliability in his newly installed mirrored headboard.
"George is being released today," he sighed. "I wanted to tell you both in person. But how did you know?"
"Not getting any younger, are we," Malfoy deadpanned. Harry wished he'd smile after saying it, but his look remained even, a joke falling from lips immobilized from their usual smirking.
"Be good and keep your arms up here now," Draco poked at one of Harry's biceps and bit his lip, that adorable sharp snaggletooth catching. He watched as Harry flexed his arms for him, bending them back and over the sofa. "Yes, just like that. I don't want you to get any ideas about pushing my head about."
"I know the really big ones excite you," Draco mumbled, trying to act annoyed and failing miserably at it. He brushed his lips against the scruff of Harry's jaw and Harry inhaled his scent, thanked whatever deity had granted him the time he’d had with Draco to grant him a little more. One more day. And one more day after that.
"You, I mean, uh," Ron looked sternly at the floor before turning his gaze to Hermione, and at her nod, finally at Harry. "Yeah. Sure." He cleared his throat as though that might rid it of the emotion behind his words. "That would be huge, mate."
"I wanted to see if you'd care to join? Otherwise, I'd be the odd duck out, so to speak. They asked me whether I'd like to bring someone along, and I thought of you."
. Others, plural, could mean lots of things. None of them good, but somehow, none of them important. After all,
." A flash of pain jolted him, as though a hornet had crawled up and stung his face. He lost his grip, and Draco scrambled off of him to the bottom of the bed.
"As lovely as it's been catching up with you, Potter, I rather think I've got something to attend to." He made a contemplative face as another, better idea occurred to him. "Or some moping. I wouldn't mind a good, long mope, actually, so if you don't mind, you can dress upstairs and get out."
"Okay. I've got to deal with George. I'll call this in—we'll be right behind you, okay? You're both going to be fine. He's going to be fine."
Draco's scowl intensified, and Harry could tell he was only digging himself a deeper grave, but he had to keep talking now that he'd started.
Harry contemplated the silver snitch in his hand, wiping his face with last years Christmas pullover. He'd forgotten how therapeutic it was to fly—how very quiet his thoughts got when the wind was whistling in his ears, and he was up high, looking down upon all the little players. And if he’d learned anything over the past few weeks, it was that there was a whole world beyond the walls of Grimmauld place, full of responsibilities and pleasures, and they didn’t all begin and end with Draco Malfoy. And even though it made his chest tight to think about it this way, he had to admit that he’d be better off with a roster of activities that kept him busy and brought him joy, whether or not Draco returned to his former position of importance in Harry’s life.
Before Harry's hand could re-emerge from his pocket with his wand, Draco drew his own, pointing it and calling out, "
Draco looked Harry's body in its eyes and found them dazed, but that wasn't unusual, and he squared his shoulders. Harry was impressed, distantly, with the body. It had to be brave if it was going to take the next step, but it couldn't feel anything—
"I told him to leave before I had the chance to ask," he said, which went a long way to explaining the note Harry received by owl later that evening, inviting him round to Blaise and Matilda's place.
"I could tell you wanted me to sing a song for you, and that’s fine. To want." He let the foot go, and Harry forced himself to look into his face rather than at that bruise, a manifestation of some pain he wouldn't share unless pressed.
"As long as it's not a bottle of Veritaserum, count me in," Draco groused, and then he took Harry's proffered hand.
Draco had been kicked to the curb once, and the flat was the cushion he’d fallen onto. It was the only home he’d ever known other than the manor because he’d never really seen Hogwarts as home, had he? In that way, it was the only thing that had ever really been his—safe, a retreat from anyone and anything—the whole of the magical world, even.
"Fucking rights," the man said—it was definitely Noah, the ex—hale and hearty and sounding oh so very and abrasively American. "Aren’t you Harry Potter?"
"Was he drinking?" Harry took one last pull of the cigarette and tossed it to the ground, extinguishing it with a twist of his toe. He sniffed, certain that this wasn't enough to set him off crying again—he'd decided on no more crying, it was too exhausting when he could sleep instead—stuffed his hands into his pockets and looked back. Draco stood at the side of the room as the class ran through the routine, one arm supporting his lower back, his other aloft, marking the time, comments slipping from his mouth.
Draco ended the spell, let the stones fall into the pattern he'd made. "I think of him as the Boy Who Died. They all died. I never saw him again."
"I think it's time another round of Quodpot," Bill said, leading them out from the room. Draco took a sip of water to play for time as they left, and then all eyes were back on him.
"Chemistry." He turned to Teddy and added, "It's like Muggle potions," as though only for the little one's benefit.
"I'd like that," she said, and that was all there needed to be said about it. Harry wasn't going to punish her for having a rat in her ranks. "Not that housing for orphans is the sexiest topic on this green earth—"
"Oh no, not at Persephone's, silly." Draco's faux-lightness was a treat to see, now that Harry found his silken tongue and icy delivery to be turn-ons. He touched Justin's arm lightly, and
"I was going to say, you know what they say about fucking and funerals," Draco said with a hint of awe in his voice, watching Harry dutifully remove his socks for him. He was wonderfully hard and finally naked, and Harry was quick to get rid of the last of his vestments and then he was on him, grinding the lengths of their hard pricks together. He sucked Draco's bottom lip into his mouth and worked it between his teeth until he groaned; Harry couldn't form a sentence to ask what it was people said about funerals if he tried.
meant. The numbers were so small on some days that they were unfathomable, but these would sometimes still be paired with unhappy faces. And then the symbols Harry dreaded. Each minus a slit, like a cut into soft flesh with a box cutter, only Draco made his on the page with a pencil sharpened by razor's blade.
"You wouldn't happen to have any evidence of your feelings, would you? Playing to your audience is important, and Draco's very analytical. Something empirical will bolster your case."
delivered with a smile and a breathy kiss, but he wasn't going to get that, so he breathed. In through the nose, out through the mouth, each tiny shift reverberating through his entire body. Every muscle in his body was strung tight, and each breath brought a new loosening as he relaxed around the intrusion, learned to accept it as needed and not a painful nuisance.
He nodded slowly. It was beyond strange. Harry had never seen him so totally unanchored, like driftwood, floating whatever way the waves carried him. All through the time when they were
His face was back, but smooth this time, fingers clutching the edges of the shower curtain. The smooth expanse of his forehead was a lie, as he pretended that Harry's search wasn't bothering him, and he was doing it badly. Harry knelt in front of the last cupboard, expecting—what was he expecting? Empty bottles of Smirnoff, maybe, or Dreamless Sleep, or bloodied bandages, or a store of pills, maybe. Something, anything that would explain the tightness in his chest, a tightness that was directly proportional to how Draco was acting right then, which when it came down to it was just a feeling. Only a feeling.
"I'd call it helpless," Draco answered him at last, interrupting his thoughts, which were quickly going down the rabbit hole of wondering who'd been in Harry's position before, or put Draco in it, and it was so easy for him to succumb to senseless possessiveness when it came to those things.
"Enlighten me to your usual," Harry said, opening the drawer closest to the sink. It was filled with regular ephemera, some Muggle, some magical—iridescent hair serums and elixirs with ingredients like the blood of bats or moth wings, tucked alongside colognes and spot treatments as-seen-on-TV. Everything in meticulous order to Draco's exacting standards. The next drawer held hand towels, and the cupboard under it more towels, of the full-bodied variety.
Cissy's cock had been held towards her hip, barely contained by the fabric, and now it floated free, tenting the dress, making a mockery that it had ever provided any decency. Harry took her balls in his left hand and tugged, gently, guiding the head into his mouth as he closed his eyes and tongued at it.
"Close your eyes, and think. In a year, what would you like to be doing?" Draco spoke softly, twining their fingers together.
Harry hoped Malfoy would return his smirk with the appropriate amount of condescension. He was surprised when his partner looked up instead, slowly, a dawning comprehension smoothing a wrinkle from his brow.
Draco blinks again and the forever blackness grows sharp, builds right-angled corners and fills them with possibilities. The space has edges now, and it’s shrunk tightly around him. A room. His quickening breaths fill it with sound. It’s a room he’s been in before, so when he unfurls from his crouched position he’s careful to keep his chin tucked into his chest. Otherwise, he’d bump his head on the ceiling and wake with a goose egg.
"Would it surprise you terribly to learn that the answer is dancing?" Draco answered, drily enough that Ginny audibly snorted at the response.
he mused, realizing that he was overeating from the stress of being with Draco just as much as the stress of being away from him and he wished, dangerously, that he was with Draco rather than enjoying an easy evening in with his friends at Ron and Hermione's flat. Wondered what he was doing and if he was okay. He was working on his second helping of dessert already and wasn't precluding the possibility of a third.
Draco shrugged, one insouciant shoulder rising. "How often do you waltz through life with your heart on your sleeve?"
"Sissy?" Harry threw a handful of lime slices into a cup and turned around, wiping his hands on the tea towel.
"Exactly. It's said that Muggles know less about the bottom of the ocean than they do the surface of the moon. I say that we magical folk know less about the brain than Muggles do about the ocean if you catch my drift."
"No. Yes. I don't know. It's different from what I'm used to." Draco picked imaginary lint from his cuffs. Harry knew it was imaginary because he was so fastidious that there was never any lint to be found at all on his clothing. "I can't get a straight answer out of most of my friends without an Unforgiveable involved." Harry bit back even the briefest smile. He could contain himself, appear friendly, but not overly so. Not interested.
“Look at you, gagging for it so beautifully. Again, then,” Draco said. He pushed back in, and Harry took him deeply, so deep that his nose nestled in the short thatch of dark blonde hair at the base as Draco held him there. Harry was glad to have his desire to inhale Draco’s scent—clean sweat and the scent of almonds that must be his soap. Draco held him so long that Harry started genuinely struggling to breathe, his body gagging out the intrusion even as his mind tried to make it work.
When Malfoy put down the drink and steepled his hands in front of him, Harry took a deep, steadying breath and slid his under the table—the sight of Malfoy's manicured nails made his stubs seem especially unsightly. He vowed to ask Hermione what the name of the potion for nail-biting she was always recommending was next time he saw her, and he tried to think about nothing, turn his mind blank to will his cock into submission.
They both bit back laughs at the increasingly absurd line of conversation. Harry felt distinctly like they were flirting, which typically went much more disastrously than it currently was.
have recommended you do so. You know this means we’re going to be asked to attend their matches now? Where we can be seen, and might be thought of thusly as fellow fans? In
"And did you," Harry licked his lips, finding his mouth suddenly dry, "did you used to pick up? Have you been in contact—for how long?"
"What an incredibly compelling offer you make. Please give me a moment to collect my thoughts so I can keep from creaming myself that the magnificent
"What's this about, Malfoy?" Ron said, brows immediately furrowed. "He skulking about, making weird apologies still? I heard he's a right ingratiating little twat at work."
"Security checks? Are you listening to yourself? What—it's a matter of national security where I am on a Friday night?"
"This way," Harry motioned across the street, and they walked side by side, quick, long strides carrying them a block left and up, and on they walked, Draco turning around every so often to check that they weren't being followed. His silence was unnerving, and once they'd cleared four blocks, Harry slowed his pace and stopped, knowing them to be around the corner of the donair spot, Dean's braying laugh audible in the cold night air.
A massive robins-egg blue oblong box awaited him on the kitchen table, a sight he looked forward to every year. It sat among a mountain of other mail that he cast a sour look at; some ripped open from the days previous and unanswered, some brand new, and more likely to show up every hour. The box was his special treat, so he pulled it from the pile and sat crosslegged on the floor, grinning as he hunched over it, summoning a fork with a thought.
It was afternoon, sat on a rough wool blanket on a little hill overlooking a marsh before Harry realized he'd hardly done anything but listen to Draco talk all day, had barely noticed them Apparating, other than the squelch the jump gave his stomach. The knee-high grasses surrounding them had been made to bow and break before, as it was evident that the clearing they'd landed in was purposefully made. A picnic basket was at Harry's wrist; he only vaguely remembered watching Draco pack it.
He wanted to reciprocate and call on Draco at the weekend but felt that something about it would read as desperate. The last time Harry had Ron and Hermione over for brunch, he'd barely been able to eat his eggs Benedict because of the dirty look Kreacher levelled at him when he insisted that yes, he was having two guests over and no, neither of them was
"I wish that wasn't a promise you felt the need to make, Mr Malfoy. We have you on non-opioid pain potions now, and I have a list of supports you should look into after you're home. It's a short list, unfortunately, but they span mental health and substance recovery care, with knowledge of therapies from our world and from Muggle expertise."
, he thought as he ascended the stairs, knees protesting after too many trips up and down them all day. He was about to turn to head for the loo when he heard something from his bedroom. It sounded at first like hissing, and cold shot down Harry's spine, thinking it could be a snake, here in his haven. Harry held onto the superstition that thinking about things brought them closer to reality and for a horrible moment actually believed that by speaking Nagini's name aloud recently he had invited the awful beast back to life. Curious and fearful, he stepped closer to the room, and the floorboards didn't creak anymore, so that Draco didn't hear him approach.
Now was Draco's time to scoff, sitting up and wrestling with him until Harry let himself be pinned down to the foot of the bed. Any more tussling and there would be bruised egos, one way or another.
"You're not just here to apologize, are you, Potter?" he murmured. His height advantage was more obvious up close, and he leaned in, taking full advantage of it. Harry's breaths sped up as Draco's lips approached his neck, warm breath caressing his ear on each exhale. Harry was caught on a knifes edge, terrified of what was about to happen, what it meant that he'd followed Draco at all, and equally ecstatic that Draco had waited for him in it.
That day, he made it out to collect curry from his favourite takeaway spot, nary a pap to be seen. His next few ventures saw him out for gradually more extended periods. Eventually, he polished up his broomstick and hopped astride it for a jaunt around London, hands still filthy with grease that spread to his white singlet and decrepit baby-blue jeans, and even if he was ultimately tailed and snapped midair, the photo gracing the cover of that week's
One of Draco's hands rested on the outline of Harry's prick, hard inside his pants, a wet spot growing—but Harry took the hand and pulled it away, held it in his.
"Cryptic, much?" Harry said, looking away, afraid of what emotions were likely being telecast by his face. "Anyway, I can't just. You know. Date. Wizards."
“You know—half of the things. Half of the closet,” he looked over to it, saw Draco’s lips twinge. His closet was a pittance—Draco had to stoop to get through the doorway of the thing, as the doorframe only seemed to care about accommodating those of Harry's stature or smaller.
Harry hid his face in his shoulder. "What does it matter? I like looking at you a thousand times more than looking at myself in the mirror."
"Harry," Ron screamed into the darkness from what sounded like forever away, "where the fuck are you?"
He had to repeat this to himself whenever this happened, as his chest started to tighten. What he couldn't begin to think about was why, if it was no big deal, he could never put it off until later. Why he couldn't, just this once, let it go?
"I don't know if living under the lake made all you Slytherins partial to cold baths, but this one can't be doing you any good."
Malfoy narrowed his eyes, looking devastatingly feline. "A question I will surely bring to the authorities if I catch you near me again without due cause, even if they are indubitably in your pocket. Stop trying to change the subject, Potter. Here, take a look for yourself."
"No, it's only that you say things differently than I do, sometimes, and that's a good thing. It's a melding of cultures or whatever." Draco was about to open his mouth, no doubt to say something harsh, and in the same jovial tone he'd been speaking in before, Harry asked, "What really happened to your first phone? I called and called and—"
"That's only because you're trying to take into account literally everything," Ron said. He counted on his fingers, "Global wind patterns, whether or not Victoire will have to miss any school, the birthing season of dragons, as per Charlie's notes—"
“Fuck,” Draco puffed the word out, watching Harry intently. Harry knew full-well that there was something foul about it, about
The charm to fix his vision had worn out completely, and Draco's form was nothing more than a ghost. A spirit with a warm touch. Harry wouldn't be surprised to wake up to discover that the whole night—the entire affair—had been a fever dream.
Harry hesitated for a moment, long enough for Draco to notice. He leaned in close, the better to speak the words directly into Harry's ear and make him shudder with want.
"In this instance," Draco said, "Largely, yes. They are. I haven't denied the stories of my behaviour directly following the postwar trials in the press, and I won't here, either."
"It's only that the person you asked about, well, he's here and—" Sparks looked off to the side and said something indistinguishable before facing forwards again, "perhaps I should let the two of you hash this out. Good day to you, Harry, and good luck," he said in an uncharacteristic rush before Malfoy's face replaced his.
"And you don't even want it," she said wistfully. He chuckled, putting a strain on his neck to do it.
It slammed into Harry all at once. He had to chuckle, though it was an empty one. Justin's strange turn of phrase, an oddity among the rest of his speech, niggling at Harry like a loose tooth that he couldn't stop prodding at.
"No," he said, a little too loudly. Draco frowned, his soft smile gone in an instant. Harry recognized that he'd gone and fucked the moment up.
Jokingly, one night, as he chopped herbs to top their dinner, Harry asked, "So what is it really like lately, dating Harry Potter?"
"Consider it granted on my end. He hasn't got family anymore, as far as we're concerned.” There was a tremble in her voice, Harry was sure of it. She was doing this for her own reasons, reasons he couldn't fathom. She turned to leave, but before she did, she said one last thing.
Draco gestured at the apron slung beside him and smiled. “Getting on with a lot of this." He faked congeniality well.
Like a bird flapping its wings, a hopeful feeling went up inside him, and he wanted to stamp it out and smash it away.
"He’s a berk, and we have nothing in common. I've never given him a second glance, and you can ask Luna and Pansy, they were there—we spoke a dozen words to each other all weekend! When I saw Andromeda, I mentioned the trip—she assumed, and clearly, she passed those assumptions on to your mother. I feel nothing for him, Draco. He means nothing to me."
Draco always made a big show of saying hello. No matter the time, he politely asked for a cup of tea or a spritzer when he was greeted by Kreacher, inquiring about the cellars' state or the facade in the garden wall that needed fixing, or some other household oddity that eluded Harry in its perceived importance to the two of them. He forced Harry to join him in doing it until they'd eventually say their goodbyes and set to explore the rest of the house, expanding their meeting places to the lounge and then all those other rooms Harry didn't bother to give names to.
"Harry, I'm sure you have lovely things to say, but I'd be remiss if I didn't take this chance. You'll have to excuse me and let me say my bit," Draco said. He took a deep breath and looked directly at the Weasley heads of household.
Not more than ten minutes later, Harry stepped from the kitchen fireplace grate and immediately knew something was amiss.
He swayed precipitously on the spot and grabbed hold of Harry's shoulders; the shoulders everyone else seemed all too happy to slap lately. Harry was glad that Malfoy seemed content with squeezing instead.
A flush rose from Harry's chest to his neck and he was going to be completely flustered in a second, and Ron was biting his lips to keep from laughing, and they were supposed to pick up Teddy in all of an hour, and—
Harry bit his lip and nodded, eyes gone misty when he picked his gaze up from the path to spot Teddy's yellow slicker, stopped now as he squatted over a newly found slug that he was trying to get to move back to the grass with some helpful prods with a twig.
Having eaten its body weight in treats, the owl stood at attention as Harry tied the parchment to its leg.
The last glimpse he caught was a smudge of white against the blackness of the hallway; Draco's body elongated in a yawn before he disappeared out the doorway.
Harry waited until Ron's footsteps thudded down the stairs before he slipped the pillow from his head and tugged the tin close. Sure, biscuits would leave crumbs absolutely everywhere, but he was both happy and sad, and it was Christmas, and he was alone, so fuck it, he was going to eat crumbly things in bed if he wanted to.
"Yes, well, it was a bit more expansive than that. I'd call a lot of them concepts, rather than words."
," Ron chucked back at her, landing with an inelegant thud at Harry's feet, and dropping unceremoniously on top of him, thus starting the dogpile that always followed any annual Weasley Family Christmas Quidditch victory.
"I came to let you know that your agent, the Cresswell woman? She had nothing to do with any of this."
The conversation was easy, the mash and roast beef mouth-watering, and the wine fairly free-flowing. There was a certain tension in the air as Arthur poured flagons of mead and George refused, hand held over the mouth of his glass, eyes cutting daggers into Draco from across the table.
"I didn't know, Malfoy, honest." Harry sat back in his chair, biting at a thumbnail. "That explains the bill, though," he added in an undertone. Draco took a deep breath, gearing up for another diatribe, but Harry beat him to it.
"Your dance card," Harry repeated, "were you actually born in 1781? Because if you're a vampire or something, I can deal with that."
It was such an odd thing to ask—a change of direction from where Harry thought the conversation was going. Harry nodded, focusing on the high-shine of the silverware and the bubbles running up the inside of his glass to keep from looking around at the many tables covered in white tablecloths surrounding them. Within it was the sea of Very Important People sombrely drinking expensive wine, eyeing each other up to determine how valuable they were based on how closely they were sitting to the Other Very Important People in the room. Harry wished they'd agreed to come earlier so they could have been included in the regular seating charts. They could have been sat with Hagrid, or at least their friends. But it had apparently been enough of a nightmare to conjure two additional chairs and a table when they'd signed on a week prior.
"Head Auror Gawain Robards suggested a secondment of a room here for your uses," he gestured at Harry's previous room.
Harry sighed. Justin was well-dressed, a little taller than him, broad-shouldered. The wind-bitten rouge of his cheeks from time spent playing sport brought him pretty close to Harry's usual type. He was polite enough to Harry's most intimate friends that if Harry had any interest in him at all, they'd be a comfortable fit.
"I've almost done it. It's ten pounds, not a stone, but still," he whispered. "No purging in thirty-three days, either." The vein visible at the opening of his pale blue button-down shirt was filling and emptying at a dizzying rate, his worry made palpable. He looked expectantly at Harry, eyes wide.
"We can use magic to defend ourselves against Muggles. What he said constituted an attack on our safety. So, self-defence."
It was happening again—Draco's sweet words making Harry's insides twist and hurt. "I'm really sorry about—you feel like you have to make me feel better. I'm a shit Occlumens, but I could try—"
it, clearly. Always had. When he pressed his lips against the ring of muscle and sucked Harry gasped aloud, gripping the sheets in surprise with one hand and the back of Draco’s head with the other. Suction, there, was unreal; fantastic, wild. His cock wasn’t so spent after all—it jumped, thickening again.
figured we'd try to get into Gatecrasher if we could, but it doesn't open for another half hour, and it's cold as fucking tits out there."
"Too late," Harry said flatly. "Looks like I'm carrying a torch for you for something like forever, whether you want me to or not. Please tell me what's going on. You seemed good, today. Things have seemed—good."
"You do know you're famous, right?" Malfoy's exasperation seemed to swell with each passing moment. "Everyone knows your birthday. Christ, what anyone wants with you is beyond me."
Harry nodded, though Charlie wasn't looking at him for a response. He focused on the platters of food and buckets of iced drinks on offer, hands smashed in his pockets. Normally so animated, Harry noticed that he got a bit bashful around new people. For a big man, he seemed small.
Ron's facial expression flickered through a handful of emotions, one of them readily recognizable as disbelief.
"Just shush, you," Draco replied, aligning them fingertip to fingertip, his cheek pressed against Harry's. "Close your eyes, and don't say anything for a minute."
"It's fine. No need to beat around the bush. I'm not going to explode at you two for noticing that I've become a bit of a—"
As if on cue, the hacking, dry cough that Harry had written off as just desserts for a chain smoker, clicked.
And Harry thrilled to hear it, was glad to get away before Draco could point out how red his ears went, before he choked on his own spit from the compliment in there. He swooped and dove, spun circles hundreds of feet high, but nothing would dislodge the squishy feeling he got from the fact that Draco thought he had
Harry made tea mechanically, his hands moving between the tasks with practised ease that brought him back to childhood. He gathered vegetables for a crudité, creamed paprika into chopped eggs, and stuck a knife in a crumbly parmesan slab. He did so in ways that would make Aunt Petunia self-immolate if she could see him and which were, therefore, his preferred methods for doing so. Though his day had taken a turn to the surreal, the familiar motions brought him a dependable sense of calm.
"I know," Harry said. He gave a weak smile and a wave as the signal that he too was going to leave, now that he'd had his fill. "It's always at seven."
"No. You'll go, and you'll have a wonderful time, and we'll all be better for the little break. He’ll come round. He loves you, it’s plain to see, he and your Weasley family." Harry's heart swelled to hear him say the words so easily,
, because Draco was haunted by demons that said these things to him every day, and it was probably a relief when someone gave an actual voice to them.
"We'd hoped to walk you down the aisle, is all," Molly said. Her voice was watery, and Harry found her couldn’t look at her, stared instead at his shoes. "You know. Take the place of your parents at your wedding."
The question took Harry off guard. He lifted his head and turned to catch Draco's eye over his shoulder. His face was pinched, almost pained.
"I'll try harder this time," he spoke at barely a whisper, but Draco heard him and said things he didn't quite make out because he was quickly losing track of reality, but he caught on that he was to lie still and close his eyes and relax, so he tried to do that.
"This whole thing reeks of Lucius," Harry started. "The timing. She started cancelling on you right after you got the letter. What if—"
It was early evening yet, but the streets were dark already, the sun setting at its ungodly hour on this, the shortest day of the year. A flood of youth had been exiting the building across the street over the past few minutes, parents reminding them to pull up the backs of their trainers and zip their coats as they collected them and bundled them off. A woman in a rusted-out Fiat hatchback honked the horn and held it until her son emerged from the building, dragging his feet the long walk over to the car. Harry winced as he slammed the door, and they were off, the tyres crunching on the thin layer of frost that had accumulated on the pavement.
The change was instantaneous. Wet fabric was replaced with the fluffiest terrycloth as a thick robe took the place of his previous outfit, cinched at the waist and swinging down to his calves. Harry looked over and, with a flick of his wrist, sent the pile of wet clothes from the room.
for Harry sitting down with some of Draco's friends in a way that he would construe as going behind his back, unless Harry
Then he pushed further until the crown of his cock popped inside. The movement drew a sharp inhale from Draco's lips.
"You're still an insufferable show-off and a prat on top of it, but that doesn’t make your little tricks any less amazing.” Draco frowned, his nose wrinkling up like that of a bunny, adding, “If you tell anyone I said that, I'll hex you into the new year."
Draco growled, throwing the bottle with unbridled ferocity. It smashed on the doorjamb to the toilet, hitting the wall hard enough that the clock hung there fell off its nail, its glass face exploding across the floor in a thousand shards, and he wasn't done. He lunged forwards and swiped everything on the table with such force that it flew to the wall too, a great, loud mess.
He sucked in a deep breath, and with it, exhaled all the bitterness swirling in him. All the want to gnash and hurt.
With a snap of his bony fingers, the table's shattered glass reassembled itself once more into a flat pane, the bottle righting itself on top. Kreacher directed a mutinous glare at Ron, croaking, "If Master would stop acting beneath his station and allow Kreacher to do the serving, the idiots wouldn't being destroying the things." He then Apparated away, leaving total silence and stillness in his wake.
fucked Harry's throat in a way that could be called gentle, though the muscles in Harry’s jaw strained to the point that he whimpered to keep it open.
"Yeah, that's it. When I push, it'll be easier if you kind of push too, just a little. Let's try now," he said, and Harry gasped. Even though it was a push from Draco, he could feel the squeeze too, how his body pulled Draco in.
"I know what it is," Draco said. Harry nodded, and fresh tears fell. It felt pointless to try to stem them now, so they fell where they may, little wet bombs darkening the blanket below.
“I’ve given you all of me. My essence, Draco. If I took a swab right now, it’s my cells coating the back of your throat. My blood courses in your blood—”
"Alright, there, Harry?" Tom asked from behind a steaming mug of tea. He always perked up when Harry walked past—he'd never really moved past being star-struck about Harry coming by the office, even coming on three years. Harry smiled wider as the feeling of an icepick tapping from behind his eyeball worsened.
"It's not that," Harry said. He pushed Draco's hand away, but it came back a second later, and he didn’t have the resolve to push it away a second time. Harry let him scratch his skin ever lower this time, into his pubic hair.
"Who wouldn't be?" Draco said, with a smidge of self-deprecation. "I'm splendid. I've been telling people this for years."
Draco's peeved face rounded the corner of the translucent shower curtain, eyebrows pulled down into a piqued 'v' in the centre. Harry swallowed the want to prod his mood, remembering the night that had brought them to this place, the tenuousness of the thing between them. He'd do anything to keep that word in his vocabulary,
"My doctor housed me on the eating disorder wing. She wanted me to be on the same meal plan as the ladies—I say, ladies, though there was another lad who joined us near the end of my tenure."
Harry realized that Draco was muffling the sounds that kept trying to escape his throat. He brushed his lips against Draco's jaw.
"You? Odd?" Harry looked over as Draco's eyes flicked around his face and then down to his hands, his trainers, back up again. "You strike me as more of a—how do you say—"
He hands you the roll and it's already dry, warmed by a charm held in his palms, no wand required. You run a droplet to wet it again, use the flame of a lighter to dry it, light the end, inhale deeply and pass it to him.
"Halloween," Harry supplied, but that only drew questioning stares from both her and Luna and Harry quickly followed with a, "never mind," to keep them from prying into the details of that night and the ensuing morning.
"Yes," Harry said, grinning out towards all the students, "delightful." He smiled nice and wide so that the teachers at the table, and the press, and the dignitaries and alumni, so that the whole world could see him smiling. He was in so much pain it burned his insides, but outwardly, he gleamed.
"Yes, we remember," Hermione said wearily. She craned her head before turning hastily back around, a mischievous smile on her face. She and Ron had probably gotten into some happy-hour wine already. He'd ditched his Auror-robes, and she was looking fit and relaxed in a black jersey tank dress and gladiator sandals, gold hoops in her ears. "Ooh, but they are looking rather lush, aren't they?"
He lowered it, but Harry couldn't stop staring. A potions accident, of a sort. The fact that he'd applied it himself. That it wasn't supposed to burn, or maybe just not the way it had. Not permanently.
Harry thought it was a gorgeous photo, wanted it hung in a place of pride. It was from the shoulders up, after all. There wasn't anything lewd about it unless one considered how very fuckable Draco's mouth seemed while slightly open, bottom lip looking pillowy (which Harry very much so did).
"I can't imagine doing the day sober," Hermione muttered, eyeing the dwindling supply of wine in her glass. Ron huffed and she startled, shocked that she said it aloud.
He turned back to the woman with green hair, allowing the worry that he'd kept at bay to seep into his voice. "Why are you asking? Where is he?"
"Wait. Potter," Draco said, pulling further back as comprehension slowly dawned. "Have you never..."
It wasn't until they were sat to eat—properly for once, the regular debris of loose parchment and mittens and pre-packaged snacks that lived on the table relegated to the unused chair in a precipitous pile—that the chill of reality seeped back into Harry's bones. He stared at the mountain of food on the plate before him and knew that he couldn't eat, not if he tried.
Harry waited patiently for the moment when Draco extended his arm and dangled him a half, dropping it into his extended hand. Draco popped his own portion directly into his mouth and went to pull another from his jacket pocket, starting the process all over again. He'd grown even paler than usual of late, complaining of swollen gums, and Harry had joked that he was probably developing scurvy from lack of sun and proper food combined. He'd responded by doing this—secreting bags of mandarins into his pockets via extensible charms and eating them in bulk whenever Harry was around. Harry didn't mind the new habit—he liked the fragrant oil on the wind, and licking the sweet juice from fingers—his or Draco's, he wasn't picky.
Ginny's characteristic scoff carried down the stairs. Harry hadn’t seen her come in, but his stomach did a hopeful swoop upon hearing her. She sat a few steps up from Ron and picked through a handful of every flavour beans even as she addressed Molly.
—my eating is easily the most orderly thing about me." He crossed his arms tightly. "I was careful after that. Only did it when I needed to—once or twice a month, maybe, when school was on. More in the summer. By sixth year—" he shrugged. "By sixth year, things weren't going so well."
"And you thought I could just fuck you after one finger." He carefully withdrew both of his own as Cissy panted above him.
"How is it that you're so bendy?" he asked. Draco only grinned, then laughed, his muscles drawing a gasp from Harry when they squeezed his softening prick. He took his legs behind the ankles and stretched them so that his feet were flat against the headboard and wiggled his toes at Harry's expression of wonder, and then let them loose, to curl back around Harry’s shoulders, heels bumping none too gently onto his back.
Draco bent in half, sobbing into cupped hands. Harry had to wonder if he was going to continue, lower, lower still to the floor. If he would grovel up at him from it. It seemed a distinct possibility at that moment that if Harry told him to, he could get Draco to beg. The curl of Harry's lips mellowed, and he held his tongue, leaving space for Draco to explain himself.
"It's a club," Draco said nonchalantly, though he smoothed his shirt down over his stomach as he did it. His tell.
He could barely admit it, felt sick to his stomach to say, "It's nice, not having to try so hard every day." Martin, his healer, had given him another version of Hermione’s advice, and Harry went back to his old mantra, haunting him once again—
Harry stepped forwards and took Draco’s hands, damp with sweat and bitterly cold, hopeful that his touch would relax rather than rile this time. He was always cold these days and brittle—he clearly hadn't slept well in the intervening time since they'd said goodbye the Thursday before, dusky shadows smudged under his eyes.
"Small spaces," Draco said with a sad smile, and Harry hadn't entertained a discussion on the topic anymore, though it was unspeakably refreshing to have someone who
Harry shook, or the bed was shaking, or the foundations of the world were, and his orgasm poured out of him hotly. He
It was late April by the time Harry decoded fully that if he was to play his old part and make a special guest appearance for one day, there might be funding for a new hospital ward in the years to come. It was one of those "you say jump, we only ask how high and whether you want your name on it" situations.
"Alright, for your home for lonely waifs, if, if," the finger was back again, holding back the comment Harry so desperately wanted to insert, "and may I emphasize only if they get some meat on the bones of the story and get it out in print the next morning. They're keeping staff overnight, mind you." She gave Harry a meaningful look, one that said
People mingled amiably enough, and cracked the windows as the temperature rose, cuffs pushed up, and buttons popped, the music incrementally growing louder as the scent of gillyweed wafted in from the back garden. Harry accepted Blaise's offer of "the best bramble this side of the Atlantic," and was surprised to enjoy drinking something other than his standard ale or whisky, though, after months of cutting back, he found that the single cocktail loosened his tongue and lowered his inhibitions considerably more than it would have done previously.
He wished Victoria goodbye and, when asked later, wouldn't recall falling asleep in the taxicab home. He made it up the stairs with the aid of Kreacher, who pulled off his shoes but otherwise left him to sleep on top of his coverlet, the t-shirt of Draco's that he always slept with now clutched in his claw-like hands, and he slept properly for the first time in weeks. He slept, through firecalls, and slept even when Luna popped over and hovered at his door, glad to be able to report to his friends that he was, indeed, alive and breathing, and better than that, resting. And in that sleep, he dreamt of another world, one where he woke up to the smells of coffee and freshly laundered sheets, a world where when he woke, it was to the rustling of paper and the deep voice of the person he loved rumbling in his ear, saying, "Good morning, love." Saying, "Welcome back."
, drugs. I—it's legal. It's for my arm." He squeezed it unconsciously, one hand tightening and creasing the fabric of his jacket over the burned wrist. He squidged his lips to the side, deeply unhappy with the words he was being forced to speak. "Sobering charms don't work with potions. I'll ralph everywhere if we Apparate."
"I don’t hear a please," Draco said as he withdrew the fingers. Harry whimpered; he was bereft; incomplete.
"'Attempt to tamper with evidence,' 'auxiliary attempt to tamper with evidence,' and there aren't any," Malfoy ticked the answers off one by one on his fingers. His eyes blinked under heavy lids doing their best to remain open. Harry could see that the potion, food and drink had shored him up some, but he still needed rest. What Harry should do was to politely leave, yet he wanted a little more time. A bit more information to flesh out the image of Draco Malfoy in his mind.
help. If you break my concentration, I'll force you through my stretching routine with me, and you'd likely lose the use of your hamstrings, permanently."
He shuffled forwards until his knees nudged Draco's leg and propped himself up on an elbow. Draco's breaths were already speeding up, shallower than before, and this simple fact made him smile. He dropped Draco's cock in favour of pulling down the blanket to reveal his long torso, the concave bowl of his stomach just asking to be tasted.
to be loved by you," the corners of Draco's lips quivered downwards, even as he blinked up at the ceiling, losing the battle to tears. "For the chance to one day be loved by you. Do you know that?"
"What do you call this colour?" Harry continued to eye the ceiling with just one eye open, allowing the other to take a much-deserved nap.
Harry nodded. The house provided a mirror on the ceiling whenever they were in bed together. He'd been too transfixed by the real Draco rising and falling above him to spend time admiring the show in the reflective glass above.
"I can just tell," she answered. "When you're not getting any, you literally stand with your arse clenched so tightly you couldn't get a stick in or out of it."
Harry leaned into the continued romancing of Draco’s fingers along his hairline and into his scalp, let his eyelids flicker shut. "And that photo with both of us in at the charity game last weekend,
Harry thought. Against his best efforts, he melted a bit. As angry as he was, as lonely as he'd been, his want for Draco to be happy and safe, even if it wasn't with him, still reigned paramount.
"Telly-wand," Draco said, his fingers rubbing soothing circles into Harry's skin. Crunching followed.
Harry sniffed. "She did." Ron gave a thoughtful nod, staring down again at the little people moving about below. A group of boys had set up a speaker, the fast cadence of some new rap song spewing out into the street. The smallest in the group was teaching the other two steps to a dance, arms akimbo, light as air on his feet.
"Goat stew, prepared by my personal chef. It is a closely guarded family secret that Mr Malfoy asked the recipe for last week."
Harry was babbling, and the warm feeling was back; he wanted to move. He rolled his shoulders experimentally and flicked energy down and out through his fingertips, his magic welling up inside him like a fountain of electricity in an open circuit.
. Harry didn't have a good way to explain that he needed the burn in his muscles to feel prepared enough for what could be thrown at him daily. There were things for which he didn't have words these days, not even for Ron.
Luna shrugged, placid as could be. "She's a bit nervy," she said, pulling up the cascades of blond waves from her shoulders to fan at the back of her neck. "She's also very particular about her lippie. Could be having a difficult time charming it in place," she said, knowingly.
"We all hate that you do that, you know?" She shook her head, though her stare stayed strong. "You literally don't hear a word we say about what you need for your own recovery."
"You can do whatever you want to me, James," he said, and Harry took to his knees at the bottom of the mattress and brought him off in a few short minutes with his mouth, one hand massaging the inside of his thigh. He came loudly, and his spunk didn't taste like much of anything at all, thin and hot in his mouth. Harry rolled to lay beside him, and Oliver licked his lips and descended on him much the same way, and when Harry closed his eyes and found a grip, firmly, not the way he'd ever dared to with Draco's fine hair, it was enough. Yes, he pretended he was someone else, and no, Oliver's tongue did not have the finesse of his previous lover, but a mouth was still a mouth. He was very, very careful that even as he made the shape of the name
Harry studied the perfectly smooth plaster ceiling of Victoria Cresswell's office, in awe at the lack of cracks. She'd had the place redecorated in a mad dash, as though a fresh coat of paint and a new theme could wash away the stain that her assistant Tom—Harry couldn't recall his last name, wasn't sure that he'd ever learned it, or if anger made him forgetful—from the place.
Malfoy growled and stomped up another step, then another. His cheeks were flushed as though with rosacea, broken blood vessels from where he wouldn't stop rubbing them.
Ron's shit-eating grin; that's how wide it was. The trio sat in the drawing-room, one of few rooms in Grimmauld Place that Harry had refurbished for daily use. No matter how much puttering Harry managed, offering whisky and butterbeer, fighting with Kreacher over who would serve the cake and on which set of china, it was only a matter of time before the couple began to poke at the erumpet in the room.
They'd agreed not to text or call or owl—too much chance of being caught, one way or another. Harry had taken Dreamless Sleep to keep from waking up his friends with an unanticipated scream, and so he hadn't dreamt of Draco; similarly, he hadn't had nightmares about him either.
"I'll walk with you," Harry blurted, heart in his throat. Had he imagined that look? Was it in the judgement of his outfit or...more?
Malfoy took his time selecting a fresh cornichon to munch on. He liked making Harry wait for it, Harry could tell. He enjoyed teasing him.
"Alright. Let's get out of here." Harry stood and gestured for Draco to walk ahead of him, following him out the front door, not looking back to see when Noah would return and find the table abandoned.
Rather than the standard black or jewel-toned dress robes that were the charitable class's uniform, Draco wore a motorcycle jacket of lived-in leather, a primly buttoned white shirt, and tight black jeans. The same riding gloves he’d worn to the café hugged his hands, and Harry was able to take in a silver stud earring and the ubiquitous pair of oversized black lacquer sunglasses hiding his eyes before Draco noticed.
, that's good." Draco groaned again, head falling to his shoulder, and Harry smiled inwardly, pleased with himself.
Draco gave a slow nod. His right hand pulled a packet of cigarettes from his jacket pocket, which he removed and threw on the table. He lit one with a little Muggle lighter and pulled a drag, tugging the ashtray closer with a finger. It was like he'd forgotten that magic was an option, and it irked Harry until he realized that perhaps his magic had abandoned him as it had once before.
"Brandy, boy, brandy. And don't be cheap about it, or you'll be in tartan velvet into the next decade."
"But you didn't," Ron said, and he looked at Harry with pity, and that was the only thing Harry couldn't stand.
Ron flicked his wand, sending a dribble of water to splash him in the face. Harry was fast and sent up a shield charm, dispersing the stream into a fine mist.
Harry wasn't sure where Justin travelled to, but he did a good job pretending to care, even as the white-blond hair he knew so well sailed across his sightline. His pulse raced as he watched Draco in his peripheral vision as he ordered and sat at the far end of the room, facing away from their party.
Draco pushed the bottom button through the hole first. Paused before doing the same with the next one.
Harry really was tired. The conversation wasn't going to be resolved in an afternoon, but he could see a long haul ahead of them. Inside there were scones, and ahead, days, and weeks, and months, and years and years to try to unravel all the frayed and twisted bits of yarn that made up their memories and habits, healthy and terrifying alike.
Draco looked to Harry, and he nodded again, and he placed his hand over the scar and held it there. His palm was warm, and it looked nice, to see Draco's skin against his own, those long, spindly fingers scratching lightly at the sparse black chest hair growing from his unmarred skin.
"Worth it," Harry grinned, taking his hand and holding it still on his thigh, though judging by Draco's frown there were still a few burrs caught where he could see them.
Draco looked perfectly content; white ribbons of hair stuck to his forehead as he went a high pink—Harry had him nearly incoherent. He kept one finger inside, pulsing gently in and out as he leaned down to kiss him.
"Er, um, health," Harry said as his phone went off again. He was thankful for the out, pulled it from his back pocket and pointed to it as he backed away from Jessica. "Sorry, I should take this."
Harry snorted. "We can give them that. How about the first chapter of the book? They can do a preview or whatever."
"Let's go to yours," Harry mumbled. "I want to wake up in your bed tomorrow." Draco didn't say anything as they stepped up to the spot, grasping him close as he jumped them away.
What could he do though, that wasn't direct intervention? That wasn't—god forbid he use the word with Draco—
Neither of them managed more than a handful of bites of takeaway, and when Draco excused himself to the loo as the group decided between Exploding Snap and watching a film, Harry escaped to the kitchen to catch his breath.
He tapped the tines of his fork against the table, waiting for hunger to come for him, knowing it wouldn't. Draco wouldn't be able to eat tonight either; Harry knew that. He'd be pacing, now, or god forbid, he was having an attack. He'd need something for his nerves to calm down, wouldn't reach out for help come hell or high water—Harry should owl Pansy or Blaise. Should have before he'd come over to Ron and Hermione's—what if Draco was—
"Okay," Harry broke the spell as the cramped feeling in his legs suddenly came to him. He rocked back onto the balls of his feet to the sound of his knees crunching and winced.
Draco was a vision in white, hair falling in soft waves, crimped in a flapper's style. A column of iridescence in elbow-length white gloves with fingers pointed towards the heavens, he danced with no-one in particular though many surrounded him, his eyes half-lidded behind a mask of mother-of-pearl. His mouth was a crimson dream, the little dip of the cupids bow glistening with sweat, and Harry was so glad his lipstick was perfect, clearly unmarred by the lips of anyone else—Draco's sweat was Harry's to lap up, after all. His thin shoulders, light as a sparrows bones were framed by the spaghetti straps of the chemise he wore, tucked into the high-waist of white silk trousers, nipped and then flowing out, billowing almost as a skirt would, and fuck but he was gorgeous—a nymph, an androgynous dream swaying to house music, alone but right at home, dancing on his own.
"Wait here for me," Draco said, and then he was gone, off to the en-suite, the door clicking behind him. Harry arched his neck as far as it would go, the back of his head drawn towards his spine so that he could lose himself in the show of crackling red and carbon black of the fire behind him. He was stuck there, suspended in thought, left wondering if Draco felt the need to purge the handful of nuts he'd eaten or if his reasons for leaving the room were innocent, as innocent as whatever carnal desire he was currently planning for could be. He wished that all of the new worries zipping through his mind could be placed in the box where he'd hidden his feelings earlier but knew that they couldn't, or they'd spill over; he could see how it would happen in his mind's eye—the arm of something slippery—an octopus, perhaps, a negative thought with eight dreadful alternate endings forcing up the lid on the box until the little anxieties could creep out, like so many centipedes. A thousand hairy legs attached to the bodies of a hundred evil thoughts would come to him in a flood, and he'd be back where he was last summer, overwhelmed and useless to help anyone, blacking out on his rooftop and wishing that he'd fallen off the side in the night. And so instead he breathed and tried to lose himself in the fire.
Harry looked over and caught the moment when Draco stilled, and if Harry knew him any better, he’d be sure that he registered hurt in the brief narrowing of his eyes. Or derision. Perhaps he took offence to the word
When Harry fetched them juice boxes and packaged sandwiches, the witch behind the counter jerked her head over towards where Draco ran zig-zags, Teddy laughing maniacally as he chased him about in their newly invented version of tag.
"Fashion week ready," he joked when Harry ran a finger over the crests of his ribs through his back. He’d been shirtless and backlit after they’d rolled around under a full moon, sharing blow jobs and, after, an ultra-slim cigarette that looked like a toothpick between his long fingers. "Not just New York either—Paris too."
Harry closed his eyes, concentrated on the touch, and the birdsong, and the rushing of the winds. It was enough to keep the ugly thoughts down, at least for a while.
nine stone was the last time Harry outright refused meals, the grief of Sirius' death too much to bear. It was inheriting Grimmauld Place, and Draco stomping his nose flat to his face, and every other shit thing that had happened during that, overall, shit year. But he'd sprouted up that year, and put on some weight while at Hogwarts, at least. He hadn't had a scale or the time to care about one during the year that followed, but he'd plummeted back to thereabout's again.
"Can you take the last of it?" He was panting now, and Harry knew it wouldn't be long. Harry moaned and nodded as much as he could, and Draco rolled his hips up, Harry's throat constricting around the intrusion of his cock into his throat. The feeling was electric—a cold sweat broke out across his skin, and still Draco pumped his hips, fucking his mouth so carefully, and under a minute like that, Draco's back arched off of the bed.
Best case scenario, Draco would ask him nicely to get out and to come back once he'd sorted out his shit. Which would be never, because it wasn't just "his shit" that needed sorting.
"Say the spells," Draco panted out once he freed his lips from Harry's bruising kisses. Harry touched them, amazed at how puffy he'd already made them, and concentrated on the spells. The familiar sensations whispered through his body; uncomfortable, but momentary. He sucked two fingers into his mouth and reached behind himself; he could be ready for Draco's cock in a minute, less, he would push it, why wait—
The next week, the call came every other day. Draco took the lead in requesting company, always in the late evening or night, and Harry decided he wasn't going to ask why, as that would open him up for ridicule and reveal a level of care that Draco would probably find trite, or worse, stifling. He didn't need to know what Draco did with his evenings, didn't get to ask that question. He wondered if someone else was worming their way into Draco's life—if he were going for dinners, the cinema—whatever it was he liked to do with other men. These other men were nameless and faceless, but in Harry's imagination, they were suave and gorgeous, stockily built Daddies and spry, well-dressed twinks and everything in-between, all of them vying for Draco's time. He added runs to his morning routine, lacing up and pounding his knees into painful submission as he tried to outrun thoughts of these others, making Draco smile, touching him, of other mouths making him gasp and groan. Harry's response-time to the call of the Galleon was quickly cut down by half.
"You paid attention, sure, but now," he said with both eyebrows raised. "I hate to be a reductionist, but you can hardly get over how good you look when I fuck you, and I think it speaks to your being a true bottom. Personally, I'm all for it."
They manoeuvred so Harry was on all fours and when he looked up and was confronted by a mirror behind the headboard, they caught each other’s eyes in it and smiled the way hyenas do. Of course, he’d need to see this. He’d probably never looked more debauched, a thick thatch of hair still pulled back and off to one side from where Draco had gripped it, the rest shooting off in literally every direction. And Draco—Draco really was his wet dream. Lips as pink as he was across the sharp rise of his cheekbones and nose—he’d burnt, somehow, in the afternoon sun. The look of concentration on his face as he conjured lube and pushed two fingers inside of Harry in a way that would be rough if he wasn't already loose, the smile on his face going lax as the muscles in Harry's back and thighs tensed at the intrusion and he gasped and then relaxed, Draco’s free hand rubbing his lower back.
