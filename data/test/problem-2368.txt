Harry spluttered at the word. "I- I wouldn't call it-"
Hermione gasped and smacked a hand to her forehead. "It was so obvious! How did I not get that?"
"No, we won't!" Hermione cried. "Harry is the foundation of our friendships! He's the glue that sticks us together! How will we do this without him?"
"Ah, boys," Professor McGonagall said as they entered her office. "I'm glad you chose to accept the offer to retrieve your memories, Harry."
Kisses peppered his face, and he opened his eyes with a smile.
"I'll do it!"
All three of them jumped at the sound of Neville, and they looked over to where he stood in the doorway. Harry hid his head in Ginny's shoulder and groaned.
"Hmm... it was on the fourth, wasn't it?" the pair nodded. "I was, uh, I can't remember, actually... oh, wait! My buddy, Mike, and I were in our sewing club!"
"Whatever it is, you three will get through it."
"I'll murder her!" Draco seethed. "I'll cut her up and tear out her innards and-"
"One can hope," Harry said half-heartedly.
"I fail to see how that links in with the murder, Harry," Malfoy deadpanned.
"Thanks," Harry said quietly. Malfoy said nothing.
A familiar voice called, pulling him out of the darkness.
Ron, Hermione, and Ginny had come to the Hospital Wing immediately when they had heard the news. Hermione hadn't left Harry's bedside, and neither had Draco, and Ginny was sniffling as if she had a bad cold.
As for Harry and Draco, well.
Harry's breath hitched as Draco's lips covered his own.
"No," Harry said. "Don't apologize. We can't let his death ruin our good memories of him. We won't let him be forgotten."
Ron grumbled a little just as Hermione came in with the tea. She looked jubilant to see him.
"Harry, you fancy him, don't you?" Ron said, his eyes glittering with amusement.
"How come?" Harry asked breathlessly.
"Professor, are you alright?" he asked, bolting out his chair to go stand beside her. She nodded weakly.
"Fine. I'll let you off this time. But just so everyone's clear, that isn't allowed!" Parvati said.
"Let's take her back for questioning," Harry said, turning around and exiting the room.
Draco sat in the near-empty Great Hall with a stoic expression, picking at his food moodily. The Christmas holidays had started, and Draco had stayed at Hogwarts, along with Hermione. She was visiting him, and the thought of her alone with Harry's helpless body made his blood boil.
Harry woke again to bright light pouring in through the large window and banging on the portrait outside. Sitting up, he tugged on his boyfriend's arm.
Draco nodded encouragingly. “Good! That’s good! Come on, Harry, we can do this.”
"Sorry, Draco, I didn't know you were a nurse now," Harry said icily.
He knew what he was going to say before he had even thought about it.
"When will he wake up? This is agitating," said a cold voice. Harry turned towards it slightly, and he felt someone flinch on the bed.
"They're like the next Fred and George," Draco joked. Harry felt his heart crack at the sound of Fred's name.
"I'm hot."
"And Harry?" Ron said.
Malfoy opened his mouth to protest, but Harry obliged readily. "Of course, Professor." he took Malfoy's arm and dragged him over to Hermione's desk, grabbing an extra chair and plopping down into it.
"But what about me? What am I, Harry? If she liked you, what was she stringing me around for?"
Draco abandoned his position from in front of the door and knelt in front of Harry's shaking body. He took his face in his hands and looked deeply into his eyes.
Harry looked behind him to see where the whisper had come from, but he couldn't make out the source of the noise. It was as if it had come from
"Potter... you are testing my patience," he said lowly. Harry clutched his head and leaned against the basin. "What the fuck is wrong with you?"
Harry turned and made to go back to his seat. He locked eyes with Draco.
Harry sniffled slightly and nodded into the blond's chest. Draco's heart was beating faster than a hummingbird. It thrilled Harry.
"Why?" Malfoy asked exasperatedly.
"...Yesterday never happened."
"Oh! I know!" Harry groaned. "Harry, come on over! Stop sulking! I'm sure you two will be able to work with each very nicely!"
Madame Pomfrey cut in quickly. "We think it's because of your scar, Harry."
"Fuck you," he said, trying to keep the pained tears at bay. He was wearing was his best
Draco and Harry glanced at each other, and stood up, following Professor Sprout out of the classroom.
"That you're a time-wasting moron," Draco yawned.
"He's been acting weird, Hermione," Draco said, gesturing towards Harry. "He's having these really weird mood swings."
"Well, Mr. Potter, that would extinguish any hope for a cure," she reminded him. He scratched the back of his head.
"Fuck no, Harry! I'd never do that!" Draco looked disgusted at the thought.
"Thanks."
"Exactly. It's not your fault," he said earnestly. Draco shook his head.
"Why do you always have to be so dramatic, Potter?" Draco said, rushing forwards and crushing Harry's head to his chest.
"You won't have peace! You'll create a bigger war inside your head! Think about this; you're taking away a
"While Slughorn was testing out new ingredients to substitute the old plant, he stumbled across a combination that brewed quicker than he could have ever hoped for!" Hermione said, her eyes all but shining with happiness.
Harry, who was laughing, brushed it off of Draco's face, his expression looking considerably traumatized.
shirt. "Give a guy a warning before parading into his office."
“Sorry I’m late,” Harry panted, walking into the classroom looking mildly ashamed. He saw everyone was working in groups of threes.
"We need some level of mutual agreement to make this partnership," Harry said, wiggling his hand around in front of him lightly. Malfoy looked at the hand held to him in poorly disguised disgust.
Draco shuddered next to Harry before coughing to mask the moment of vulnerability. But Harry could see right through the facade.
"Well, something ripped through your abdomen. You had a big cut across your stomach. I got a cut on my chest, and I started crying tears of blood for some strange reason," Malfoy said wonderingly. "You didn't put anything in the potion that you weren't meant to, right?"
and I?" Ron inquired, swallowing the hunk of chicken.
"Yes, I'm Molly. Lola was my mother," she said sadly.
The Headmistress nodded, looking into Harry's eyes. "The good thing about this situation is that you have to option to reject being Draco's mate and leave him to find someone else. But the reason the bond made you stay together was because of the potion."
The matron nodded her head understandingly and conjured a clipboard, scribbling down notes with a pen at lighting speed. "It may be possible that your brain has repressed the unpleasant memories of your childhood."
"Draco! Calm down!" Harry said hastily, eyes widening in surprise. His lover sighed.
, Harry! I tried flirting with Draco to make you jealous, but it never worked! Because you're oblivious!"
"You mean that it'll hurt?" Draco asked worriedly. Madam Pomfrey's eyes fell to the floor guiltily.
Harry paled a little; he had forgotten. Professor McGonagall had enclosed a slip of paper with their new timetables that day with the password, and Harry had kept it for safekeeping. But his robes had been changed after he had gotten drugged. Who knew where it was now?
"As some of you may know, Tobias Henley has been murdered a few hours prior," Robards said gravely. "The main suspect is his daughter, Molly Reeds. She has abandoned her children and fled her home. I'm dividing you all into groups to search for her. Potter, Malfoy," he addressed the pair directly. "I'm going to need you to look through every record of Molly Reed's existence. Every single one."
"But I like picking you up," he complained.
Neville chuckled before going back to his half-eaten breakfast with his mind whirring, trying to figure what the pair couldn've possibly argued over.
Dean chuckled. "You know Harry hits hard, Seamus."
"I think you've forgotten that we are now partners, Potter," Malfoy said coldly. "Which means that, unfortunately, we have to work together."
work together, and I don't want to hear another peep about it!"
Harry frowned, and Draco tried to peek at the letter once he got up from the ground. Harry immediately took his wand from his nightstand.
Draco, thoroughly nettled, grabbed Harry's hand and pulled him up so that he was standing. He leaned in.
“No! Please!” he moaned, pushing himself away from his lover’s outstretched hand. “I’m sorry! I’ll fix it! I’ll fix it just please don’t hurt me!”
"Where's Ron?" Harry asked.
"I feel pathetic," Ron said, leaning against the doorway. Draco got up and joined him, confused.
"We haven't fully bonded yet," Draco pointed out.
"She was crying in your arms, I bet," Ron snorted.
"The only one losing is you," Harry shot back at him. "
Ron scurried away.
"Don't be. It was nice to let it all out," Harry said truthfully.
Neville was affronted.
"Who saw her last?"
"Now, Harry," she said. "We think this might be because of an underlying illness. Did you ever experience any unexplained physical pain when you were young?"
Of course they were afraid of him. He was a monster.
"Sorry," Harry told Neville. He just shook his head.
Harry jolted awake to a bustling classroom. Malfoy was still crushing the horn, his eyes a little red around the edges from the sting of them, and Harry was still chopping up a flobberworm. He felt a stinging sensation in his hand and realized with a start that he had accidentally cut his hand. He hissed in pain and pressed on the deep cut with all his might. Malfoy's head perked up. He scowled at Harry and promptly left their table.
McGonagall had invited all the previous seventh and fifth years to retake their OWLs or NEWTs the year after the war, since students had been too worked up to focus on exams. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had accepted eagerly. Harry was immensely thankful for such a caring Headmistress.
"Sleep now, love," he heard his boyfriend say.
He made to exit the bathroom but was stopped when Draco's arm pulled him back. "Maybe you should wait a bit, Harry. She might need some space."
Mike laughed on the other end. Rob let out a sigh of relief.
"Fuck!"
"Hangover," Hermione explained. "I told him not to drink so much!"
"This is Draco Malfoy from the Auror Department! Open the door! If you don't, we have permission to break it down!" he yelled, thumping the door loudly. Harry rolled his eyes.
"I hate this! Help him, please!" the torn boy pleaded. McGonagall grasped her temples in frustration. She should know how to fix him! She should've- she should've-
Harry turned his head to look at him and nodded slowly against the floor.
Malfoy looked as if he was about to argue, but Harry intervened again.
Hermione groaned, tears flooding her eyes. She grasped Harry's pale hand.
time, Harry?”
"I think you've forgotten that we're wizards, Malfoy," Harry said, rolling his eyes. "And save the theatrics for your father."
After a few minutes the two smelled smoke and Harry's eyes flew wide open. "Fuck!"
"Don't be ridiculous," Harry said, rolling his eyes.
"Guys, I know you love each other, that's great! But we don't need to see your snogging sessions!"
"Sorry," he sniffled, wiping his cheeks. "I've just really missed you."
“What if he actually does leave me, ‘Mione?” Harry sobbed into his friend’s shoulder. Hermione sighed and resumed stroking his hair.
"Ah, Draco!" Slughorn exclaimed happily. "Let's see..."
"I came here to say that I love you back," Draco whispered in his ear. Harry gave him a shit-eating grin.
"I lo... you," Harry mumbled, before slacking against Draco. The blond's heart sped up as he grabbed Harry's wrist and pressed, trying to get a pulse. He relaxed when he felt the pulse, however faint it was. The doors to the Great Hall pushed open once again, and numerous students poured out to circle Draco and watched him weep. Draco glared at them.
"What do you mean?" he said dumbly.
"Fine," he answered. "What about you?"
"Come on, Harry! We haven't even looked through it yet!" Hermione protested.
Hermione snapped out of her daze. "What? Of course not..."
"Thank you for being so brave, Harry. And you, Draco," she said to the blond, who was taking in deep and labored breaths on the ground.
"Yes?"
"Be quiet, Malfoy!" he hissed, snatching his glasses from the nightstand. The blond smirked at the use of his last name and got up to follow Harry. The portrait swung open to reveal a Hermione that was red in the face. Harry stowed his wand away and smiled uncertainly at her.
Draco had grabbed his arm and all but flung him onto the bed. Harry flushed.
The Aurors took Molly into custody. They also took Dylan to St Mungo's to ensure his safety. He had had his memory modified and now resumed his normal life. Rob had been kept for further questioning on the matter. And the case was closed.
Draco Malfoy was a fucking hero. After all, he was the one who had thrown Harry his wand when he needed to kill Nagini. He had also saved Harry Potter in Malfoy Manor by lying to his father when he was asked to identify him.
"He's taking it surprisingly well."
"Harry! Oh, Harry!" Hermione exclaimed, rushing to the back of the classroom where he sat. "Are you okay! I went to visit you in the Hospital Wing but you weren't there! Harry, you should be in bed right now!"
"This
"A few minutes should do the trick," she said and promptly left. Sure enough, Harry's eyes blinked open a few minutes later, and he looked around. Draco flung himself at him, sobbing into his shirt.
“SO WERE WE!” Harry exploded suddenly, facing her. “WE WERE ALSO CHILDREN. WE WERE FACING SOME FUCKED UP SHIT! BUT DID WE TURN INTO ASSHOLES?! I DON’T THINK SO!”
, then," Malfoy said, his pale face slowly filling with color at his moment of weakness. "Let's use that. Any reasons she could have been feeling
"So what have we got?" Harry asked, walking around the desk to stand next to his partner.
"It's about the cure," she started. "It... is going to be delayed."
Ron nodded approvingly. "Yeah, I like Miguel. He was like Harry in his first year."
"If it wasn't, then he would still be alive, Hermione!" Harry pointed out exasperatedly. Hermione thought for a moment.
"And you didn't tell us this because it would make her a liable suspect," Draco guessed. Rob nodded.
Hermione entered Harry's office with a file in her hands, startling him. He had been staring into space once again, so he took a bunch of papers and started rifling through them to look as if he'd been working. The Minister frowned disapprovingly as she took in his disheveled state.
"Call him in," Harry said after a few moments of silence. "I have a few questions for him."
Madam Pomfrey looked up and answered hesitantly. "Now... I wouldn't have suggested this if the Headmistress hadn't convinced me it was the only way but... we may need to extract memories from your mind and look in a Pensieve to see what it was about your childhood that was so... horrifying to you."
The offer sounded tempting, but Harry wasn't about to fall for another one of Draco's games again and be forgotten about and ignored.
Harry screamed as he felt the Professor probe through his head, trying to rip open his brain's secrets. He could hear Draco fall to his knees next to him and cry out in pain. They gripped each other's hands tightly.
"You think I've got an imprint?" Harry said, bewildered. "I don't think you've noticed, Hermione, but I'm not an animal."
"He was an employee at the Ministry in the Department of Mysteries," Hermione explained. Draco scrunched his face up a little.
"This is Draco Malfoy. We need to speak with Henley," he said.
"Agh!" he clutched his scar and fell off the bench, blacking out as the pain blinded him and took control.
we tell Granger?" Draco groaned. They walked through the doors and went to sit at their regular table. Draco hesitated.
"How are you feeling, Harry?" the matron asked, coming forward with a blood-replacing potion, which he eagerly drank. "You lost a lot of blood there."
Harry ran a hand through his hair.
"Draco! Someone's trying to get in!" Harry said, pulling Draco into a sitting position.
"Hermione! What's up?" he said in an attempt to act casual. Hermione rolled her eyes, but there was a bright grin on her face.
"What now?" he said exasperatedly, flinging the phone onto the small table.
Ron stared at him from the doorway and Harry gave a sigh.
"It was not misogyny-"
Harry flushed. "I'm just saying."
"I hope you know, Smith, that homophobia is a form of discrimination. And we do not allow discrimination in our school. So if you know what's good for you, leave."
"Was she a witch or Squib?" Malfoy asked, giving up.
want again?" he inquired in an irritated tone. Draco raised an eyebrow.
Harry squeezes his eyes shut. "I'm sorry, 'Mione. I'm really sorry."
"Then how-"
"Dad," she said. Draco smiled at her. "Ice-cream? Please?"
"I came to give you a Sleeping Potion. Try and get some rest, Harry. You lost a lot of blood. You're going to need more than one day to heal." she pushed the vial into Harry's hands, and for once, he didn't argue with her. He downed the vial and passed it back to her.
asking for it!"
and I thought it would be nice to call each other by our first names.
The kiss was the most exciting thing he had ever experienced. Draco tasted of green apples and coffee. Harry's hand grasped the blond's platinum locks while Draco made his claim on Harry's waist.
"Harry, I hope the fact that Albus Dumbledore is human doesn't shock you," the Headmistress said gently. Harry didn't say anything.
"Prove it."
”That’s not fair!” Malfoy argued. “You used that spell on me in self defence-“
"You can like more than one person at one time, Ron," Harry said gently. Ron turned on him.
Draco wrapped his arms around the smaller man and sighed. "We weren't expecting this. Only a few days before this man had been walking about with a smile on his face. It's okay to be surprised."
They both pulled away again, and the circle laughed.
Draco laughed. "Of course."
The Hufflepuff spun around idiotically. Harry whooped as he saw the Gryffindor Seeker, a short blond boy named Russo, speeding after the small ball.
"What's that supposed to mean?" Dean frowned.
"I've missed you too," she said, her eyes shining. "I'm glad you gave me space."
"Thank you," they said, bowing their heads slightly, filing out the room once she dismissed them with a nod of her head.
"How have you been?"
"I sent her a letter a few weeks ago," Henley said, looking a little sad. "She even responded. I wanted to reconcile before we died, but I guess we lost that chance."
Malfoy chuckled, and the deep sound sent shivers down Harry's spine. "Honestly, Potter, do you even know what to do?"
"I'm back!" he said, laughing in joy. Draco nodded.
The man in the photo had long dark hair and black, hooded eyes. But that wasn't why Harry was shocked. He was talking about the fact that the man had been convicted of rape thirty years ago. He got a seven-year prison sentence.
But Harry wasn’t listening. His head was spinning and he felt bile rising in his throat. “Want Draco...”
"Draco... are you mad at me?" Harry said in a small voice.
The match began, and Smith had no problem intercepting the Quaffle. The Gryffindor Chasers had been passing around as if they were playing pass the parcel. Harry stood up from his seat and all but yelled at them.
The two nodded. Harry felt cold inside. He had only known the bloke for a few days, but still. Henley was harmless. He hadn't done anyone any wrong.
Harry walked through to the fireplace of Grimmauld Place and looked around appreciatively. To him, there was no place like home. He dropped himself onto the couch and flung the files onto the coffee table. He flinched when his phone rang.
"Because now I know what I want," Draco said, leaning down and capturing Harry's lips in a kiss. Something tightened in his stomach, and all he could think was
”Being my boyfriend doesn’t mean you control the ins and outs of my life, Potter,” Draco replied coolly. Harry flinched; Draco never called him Potter unless he was really mad.
Draco gave him a look and tilted his head slightly. Harry scowled a little.
That made Harry's face erupt in a smile. He pulled Draco back by gently tugging on his hair and wiped away his tears.
Ron flipped her off, and Draco laughed.
"You want to, then?" Harry asked, a heavy blush forming on his cheeks.
"Harry! So glad to see you're awake!" he heard the familiar voice of the Headmistress call out. The curtains around his bed were pulled back to reveal her and Slughorn looking wary but cheerful.
"Like you would've killed me?" Harry asked, but his gaze had softened.
"I don't sense any evil entity inside of you, Harry," she murmured after a few minutes, letting him go again.
Henley let out a sigh, and Harry looked up to see his eyes full of yearning and loss.
"Five more minutes, Harry," Draco grumbled groggily.
"Please, Madame Pomfrey!" Harry pleaded. The matron huffed.
An hour or two passed, but Harry was still wide awake.
It was evening, and Harry and Draco were once again headed to the Room of Requirement. Once they had entered, the two sat down on the cushions by the warm fireplace.
a rustle and a moment of silence.
Lavender took the bottle from in front of Hermione, and when it stopped, it was pointing at Draco. He looked cautiously at Lavender, who looked green in the face.
"But then you'd have to wait too."
"Who do you like as of now?" Malfoy asked suddenly, obviously hoping to dig up dirt on Harry.
Harry remembered the hazy feeling of being taken under. He felt as if his soul had been ripped out of his body, and he was watching it function with its mind. He had been terrified when he had stepped over to the window, but curiosity had overpowered him, and he couldn't stop himself.
Harry had the grace to flush deeply.
"Do you have any proof you didn't?" he asked.
"-An apology I will gladly accept," Malfoy carried on, smirking. "As long as you promise not to do it again. We're a team now, Potter."
"The Ministry has gone to the dogs," he muttered. Harry laughed heartily beside him.
"Yes, but you do have a motive," Malfoy countered.
"Harry, please reconsider," Draco begged as they walked down to the Headmistress's office.
He and Draco had become good friends in the past few weeks. Always being around one another had formed a reluctant friendship between the two boys.
"It wasn't that scary," Harry teased as they continued their walk down the corridor.
"What?" the Slytherin said, backing up slightly. Their spells faded away, and Harry grinned manically.
Ron looked as if he were about to disagree but nodded eagerly when Hermione leaned in and whispered what sounded suspiciously like
Harry took it in his hands carefully.
Hermione chuckled. “I’d go find Draco if I were you.”
, in the past," she said and swung her arms around maniacally, obviously thinking it represented their relationship. Harry thought it was pretty spot on.
Draco chuckled, leaning in before stopping abruptly. "I'll catch something."
"Then how pray tell, is he alive?" she asked, eyes widening.
Malfoy rolled his eyes once again, drinking his coffee nevertheless. Harry frowned and groaned loudly.
"But, Harry. Why this guy? What's so special about him?" Ginny asked, giving Draco a questioning look.
”I won’t,” Draco murmured, kissing his forehead as he set him down on the bed. “I’ll protect you.”
"So you know who pushed you off?" Hermione asked.
Draco smiled warmly. "No. I won't push you into anything you aren't comfortable with."
Harry thought for a moment. "Really? You don't mind?"
"Did you?-" Malfoy ignored him and merely scowled at him, brushing down his shirt. Harry shrugged.
"The two were very close, apparently," Draco said. "From what her other neighbors have said in their statements."
"Are you alright? You idiot, what were you thinking?" Draco exclaimed, looking over Harry's body for any injuries.
"Make me, Weasel."
Draco screamed in shock as he watched Harry plunge down at the speed of light.
"Oh come on, Harry!" Hermione said exasperatedly, taking out a book and skimming through it hurriedly. "When has that ever worked? We were always the ones fixing the school's problems! You had to fight a basilisk, for Merlin's sake!"
"MY EYES!"
"You know very well by now that Draco is a Veela," she started wearily. "And those Veelas have mates."
Harry didn't say anything. He stared at the ground and let Draco and the Headmistress discuss different possibilities. The voice kept taunting him, jeering at him, muffling all sound around him.
"Sorry. It's uh, top-secret," Harry said.
"I'm the arsehole?"
"Fine... I'll tell you," Harry mumbled, looking the other way. The truth was, he really wanted to let it all out, and telling somebody was the best thing he could think of. Even though it had been three years since Sirius' death, Harry felt as if he hadn't had the chance to mourn properly.
"Calm down, Harry," Draco sighed, clamping a hand over the brunet's mouth. "Don't waste your time on Thomas."
Malfoy scowled at the phone screen. "This isn't something we can talk about over the phone. It's is very urgent, so please hand the phone over to Tobias."
"We have nothing! Nothing, I tell you!" he said, moaning in frustration.
His wand came out from his sleeve, and he held it in front of him defensively.
"Why did it hurt him?" Harry asked, evidently confused.
"Since now. Now hop to it," the brunet said, winking. His face slowly flushed red and he quickly hurried up the rest of the stairs.
"Goodness! What- Poppy, explain!" McGonagall stood in the doorway, her face a mixture of horror and fear.
That earned him a smack in the head.
"I think I'm going to throw up!" Harry exclaimed. Ron rolled his eyes a little. Next to him, Hermione couldn't tell if she wanted to feel jealous or amused. But she knew the boys had no feelings for each other.
When he opened the door, his mouth hung open like a fish.
"I wanted to talk to you." Her eyes darted to where Draco stood beside him. "Alone."
"Draco, you and Harry have a bond, don't you?" the Headmistress asked, panic in her eyes.
Harry laughed at that. He doubled over in his chair and thumped his fist on the desk as rapturous laughter consumed him. "
She sighed, leaning her head against his shoulder. "How's Ron?"
"It'll be alright, Potter," he said softly. Harry shook his head.
"I'll check up here, you take the bottom floor," he ordered Malfoy. The older wizard crossed his arms in front of his chest.
"Hermione, what's going on?"
Rob complied and dialed the number.
"Boys," she greeted them. "I see you're doing well."
Harry had wandered over to the window and was now leaning out, his arms flailing around as if he was a drowning man.
Harry narrowed his eyes. "She's very happy with Ron, Draco."
"I cut my finger," he breathed, realisation dawning on him. "But why can't we be apart from each other?"
The next day passed slowly. Harry spent most of it avoiding his boyfriend and wondering what he would find out on the Astronomy Tower. The smarter, logical part of him wondered why she would want to meet there. The scared part of him wanted to make sure that it was her letter, but the determined side of him needed midnight to come as soon as possible.
"They'll probably go in the system," Hermione had said when Harry asked. And although he had hated the fact, there was not much he could do about it.
“I won’t care either!” Draco yelled, getting up as well. “He’s a lot better than your annoying arse, you controlling little shit!”
"Oh well," Draco shrugged. "I've been obsessed with you ever since I first laid eyes on you. This was bound to happen."
The alternative is angsty and short. It can be found on my Wattpad account @m-blackhart
Malfoy and Harry stood in front of the small house with equal looks of fury and distaste.
"No. And nor do I want to," she spat. Harry gaped slightly, and Malfoy elbowed him.
They were the color of liquid gold. If Harry looked close enough, however, he could still see a tinge of silver hidden beneath the gold.
"Don't worry, mate. I won't tell a soul. I'm super supportive of the LGBT stuff!" Neville chirped happily. Harry looked up.
So I sit facing the window and this time I’m quiet. I’m just looking out at the grey sky and wondering if the windows open. You’re arguing alongside your lawyer, but I can feel you sneaking furtive glances in my direction. I can hear you growing quieter with each passing moment. It takes the mediator clearing his throat loudly for me to realize
“Because that would just be too obvious! And I did not raise my daughter to be so obvious. She’s much more clever than that.” Greg laughed again.
-Gimme Gimme Gimme
“I listened to him plenty. He doesn’t
I want to tell you that I love you. I want to take it all back. I want to beg you to come home with me, to stay, to pretend like this never happened. But I remember how you looked last week, standing with him, and I don’t say any of those things. Because you stopped looking at me that way before we even got married, to be perfectly honest. And I can’t go back to the anger and the resentment and pretending like it’s all ok, like this is all love really is.
Steeling himself once more, he took a deep breath and stepped into their room.
he felt so nervous, why his Gryffindor courage was failing him now, but he thought of Malfoy teasing him in the pub and the conversations they had finally started having over break and his mouth ran dry and he realized with horror that he didn’t just fancy Malfoy. He actually
“Dad floo’d him two days after Alex proposed last year. I remember because Uncle Theo congratulated me. He was happy for me, but almost a little sad too. I totally forgot.”
“No, I said
“Harry, what are you doing up so late?” his best friend chided immediately. He smiled up at the woman sitting on the couch in front of the fire he hovered in. Her brown bushy hair had been pulled up into a messy bun and she was wearing a pair of well worn, Cannon pajamas that he knew her husband had got her many Christmases ago. In front of her on the coffee table sat two empty wine glasses.
In case you don’t speak Greek, “ Kefáli tou Drákou” is poorly translated Greek meaning “head of the dragon.” The Latin, “caput draconis,” was the very first password to the Gryffindor common room. Please leave a round of applause to my beta for that wonderful idea!
“Is Theo Uncle Theo?” Victoire asked and Lily nodded. “Who is Charlie and who is the other one then?” Lily’s face flushed again.
“What’s the name of the game?” Benny crowed from his perch on the Greek God’s shoulder. Lily laughed.
“Yes. We’re married.”
“This came express from Lavender.” Luna’s face lit up.
“I’m just barely able to pay for this wedding, no way I can pay someone to work here full time,” Draco said coolly. Drystone houses rose up out of the hills as they walked. They were all a stark white, but the natural island greenery alongside brightly colored shutters, curtains, and outdoor furniture stopped the scenery from looking so bleak.
“Don’t you
“There’s a crack in our bloody atrium is what’s wrong and half the guests are arriving tomorrow!” Draco rolled his eyes again.
The couple in the dark stared wide-eyed at the emptying alcove across from them. Vic had never been more grateful for Teddy’s charms skills in her life. The disillusionment spell he had cast on them had held firm, aided in part by their staying perfectly still in shock (and disgust) at the scene that had unfolded before them. Vic finally released a breath she didn’t realize she was holding and turned to look at Teddy, who was already looking down at her with a (she was sure matching) horrified expression on his face.
“Everything is set, ‘Mione.”
“Why don’t you hire someone to do that?” Daphne asked and Draco sighed as they made their way along the cobbled road. They had this conversation every time they came to visit. Surely one day they would give it a rest?
Draco pressed his chest against Harry’s and Harry could feel the sudden weight as Draco leaned against him for support. He grinned against the taller man’s mouth at Draco’s sounds of frustration. The blonde was trying to get his own pants open with one hand. Harry’s hands slid down from Draco’s waist, tugging on Draco’s flies for him. And then Harry’s nails were digging into the bare flesh of Draco’s bottom when suddenly the other man’s cock was pressed flush to his. Harry threw his head back, uncaring of how hard it hit the wall, and moaned loudly. He pulled Draco closer, thrusting up into the hand that now wrapped around both their pricks. It was too much, it was overwhelming.
“I sent the invitations,” Lily explained, her voice so quiet they all had to lean in to hear her. She cleared her throat and looked up from the ground, her expression almost pleading. “Dad doesn’t know I sent them.”
“What the fuck?” Malfoy spat, his gaze hardening as he looked down at Harry between his thighs. But Harry just grinned and pulled himself up Malfoy’s body to capture the blonde’s lips with his.
“Geronimo won’t hurt her,” Nico said confidently.
A short mirror Malfoy must have conjured or transfigured lay on the ground against the wall. He was taking small steps back and forth in it, practically spinning on his toes when he turned to walk the other way. His focus was entirely on his feet and legs in the mirror, admiring his new shoes.
“I don’t remember inviting him,” Draco said, his frown deepening. It had been a while since he and Theo had even spoken.
possible dads.”
, her friend had somehow been absolutely pants at the subject. Lily had laughed, said she’d been too busy enjoying the last vestiges of her youth to listen to a word on the theory her dad was always spouting off at her. Vic spent the next seven years extensively tutoring Lily so that she could pass her Potions NEWT. Through all their years at Hogwarts, Vic had watched Lily struggle with her ability to focus on subjects she couldn’t get by with just a little hands-on experience. She watched Lily retain information better when she jumped between subjects while studying rather than spending hours on a single topic. She watched as Lily doodled to keep her hands busy so she could process the information the professors were telling them. She listened to every excuse Lily had as to why she couldn’t do that assignment until the night before it was due, lest she squirm and complain until Vic shooed her from the library. As much as Vic would love to find out that Lily was a Weasley, there was only one person Vic knew that learned and processed information in almost exactly the same way. And when her friend turned those trademark, open, green eyes on her, gazing at her curiously above her glass of juice, Vic was absolutely positive she knew who Lily’s other father was.
“No one knows Harry better than you, ‘Mione. Do you really think Lily’s parentage will matter to him?”
“You’re mostly your mother’s,” Charlie teased and Vic scoffed, stealing one of Charlie’s croissants in retaliation. Charlie gasped and pretended to be mock offended. Lily laughed and looked across the table at Harry, who was watching her with a very sad smile. She blushed, but met his gaze head on.
The winter break was almost over and the eighth years had decided to have one last hurrah down at the new pub that had just opened off a side street in Hogsmeade. Malfoy had been getting ready in Parkinson and Hannah’s room, though Harry wasn’t entirely sure why. Malfoy had gotten closer with Hannah over the first term considering his best friend was rooming with her, so Harry supposed it wasn’t the strangest thing he had heard. Still, he found himself on edge as he waited in the common room with Hermione and the other boys for them to come down. Even Parvati and Lisa had beaten the trio downstairs.
Lily pulled back enough to look up at him, opened her mouth to say something, but hands were suddenly grabbing them and pulling them both apart.
“This hasn’t been my secret.” Hard for it to be when it was kept from him too. Charlie took a deep breath.
“What are you doing here, Potter?” Greg’s voice was low, rough. He was speaking straightforward with no room for nonsense. Harry was starting to think he liked this man as an adult. He grinned.
“You as well,” Harry said, releasing her hand so she could shake Charlie’s. She seemed to look at the taller man with a little more awe, before looking back and forth between him and Harry thoughtfully, as though she were suddenly scrutinizing them. “I must admit, I was a little surprised to get an invitation from your father at all, but I’m glad to have the opportunity to be here. Where, uh, where is he?”
“She’s consulting me as a patient.”
“You act as though my name was at risk of being dragged in the first place.”
“I checked that everything from the list was packed three times. I brought extra chargers and I packed your favorite quill.”
made after you. I wanted to be an Auror and now I run the whole bloody federal department! You knew exactly what my dreams were, and you didn’t even consider them.”
of a handful when they unfreeze him though. But he’ll be in good hands.” When Lily flashed a smile to Charlie, he was looking right at her. He seemed to look almost…proud, she thought. She flushed a light shade of pink. Nico cleared his throat and Lily stepped back as he raised his wand.
Maybe he was just projecting.
“Nineteen,” Daphne answered for him. Charlie suddenly frowned.
“What do you mean?”
When Draco was promoted to hotel manager and asked Greg to come run the kitchen, it was the longest Greg had gone without seeing his friend. He remembered that first night in his flat three summers ago when they drank an entire bottle of cheap whiskey and didn’t talk. He remembered last summer when Draco floo’d into his still meager one-bedroom flat with the tiniest bundle in his arms that Greg had ever seen. They drank a single glass each of good whiskey and didn’t talk until little Lily smiled up at him for the first time in her life. With one look at his fridge full of dozens of pictures of her over the last year that he couldn’t be there to see, Greg said yes and moved to Greece.
“So what do you do?” Charlie asked her, pulling her attention away from the scenery outside the window.
“Three!?”
“He’s always been quite stupid when it came to Draco Malfoy,” Hermione scoffed, her emotions finally tumbling out. “I just want him to be happy. He of all people deserves that.” Luna leaned forwards in her chair, bending over the desk, and raised both brows at Hermione again.
“No, he’ll see that I’m happy and be relieved.” Charlie took a deep breath in and thought about it.
“Did you just…”
~ ~ ~
“I think so.” Slowly, ever so slowly, a grin creeped across Lily’s face.
“Oh fuck, Draco,” Harry moaned as Malfoy clenched down around him. And as he wrung the last of Malfoy’s orgasm from the body beneath him, he let his own orgasm take over. He pushed his hips forwards, once, twice, three more times, emptying himself in the man pressed tightly against him.
liked Ron at one point so she wasn’t exactly without taste. Harry had given most of the other Slytherins a second chance; he supposed he should give Gregory Goyle one too.
“Lily, are you ok? What’s going on?” Teddy’s face, back to normal now and yet somehow distorted, swam in front of her. She opened her mouth to reply, but before she could get the words out everything went dark.
~ ~ ~
“Lily’s down by the docks. The boat’s bringing a lot of familiar faces in this afternoon. Perhaps you’ll know some of them…Perhaps Lily could use the company even if you don’t.” And then Greg walked away, Harry gaping at his back until the man disappeared.
found out.
Daphne stepped forward and wrapped an arm around Lily’s shoulder, smiling over her head at Charlie. He smiled back.
“Webpage, not newspaper. And for such a famous place in magical history, it’s amazing how few people actually know you’re here,” Daphne conceded. “I think Lily’s probably right. Once they see what they’re missing, they’ll pay a small fortune to come here. Greece doesn’t have many magical only communities.”
Lily threw her arms around his neck and Charlie hugged her back. He wasn’t sure if he would regret this later, but he didn’t care. He was about to open his mouth and ask her what now, what’s next, when a loud sudden squawk made them jump apart.
“She’s ok. Olek Baros is very good. He’s been Lily’s doctor since she was a baby. As if I’d entrust her care to anyone less capable.” Draco scoffed at the idea. Harry bit back a laugh.
“Good evening, Hermione. You’re early.”
“It’s definitely him.” Lily snorted and rolled her eyes.
The lawyers and the mediator are all speaking at once. But I’ve been drowning since I walked through the doors. They’re speaking from underwater and they’re muffled and all I can make out is you.
“He was.”
, Potter. You haven’t had anything to say in all this time, and now…neither do I.”
all looked up at them in neat, cramped writing. The labels were as faded as the one on the box’s cover.
“I don’t know how long you intend to be here, but my daughter is getting married this Saturday so I would greatly appreciate it if you would kindly
“I’m not,” Harry confessed. Charlie’s brows raised in surprise, before furrowing in a more thoughtful manner. Harry pushed on, “Are you here for Oliver and Marcus, then?”
“So what brings you into my fire, then? Out with it.”
“British Head Auror Potter doesn’t get vacation?” she asked incredulously and Harry had to bite back a laugh. She was her father’s daughter; there was no doubt about it.
“Uncle Theo!”
He scurried away before Harry could protest or speak. The raven-haired man seemed to still be processing the conversation. Harry refocused when Greg cleared his throat again. Harry turned to look at him with a tight smile.
The girl wasn’t an exact replica of Draco but looking at her there was no doubt in Harry’s mind just who she belonged to. Her blonde hair was pulled into a messy bun, errant curls framing her face by accident with the wild directions they faced. Green eyes gazed eagerly back at him, the freckles on the girl’s face even more apparent from time spent in the summer sun. But her features were sharp, her body lean and her movements graceful. Harry suddenly wondered what she looked like when she was a small child, as a baby. She looked far too young to be getting married, Harry thought. Harry began to breathe again when he looked back over at his godson who was waving excitedly at him, hair bright red in greeting. Victoire leaned over to whisper something to Lily and the shorter girl’s face turned thoughtful as she nodded in reply.
Before Malfoy could push him away and angrily demand an explanation, Harry was hooking both of Malfoy’s heeled feet over his shoulders and pushing his own neglected length into Malfoy. Malfoy cried out, reaching up for Harry to pull him back down against him. Malfoy’s legs slipped off of Harry’s shoulders once Harry was fully seated inside him and he wrapped his legs around Harry’s waist instead, pulling him in as deep as he could. Harry’s deep groans were swallowed by Malfoy’s mouth.
“Oof!”
“Not in twenty years.”
“What are you looking for, love?” Ron asked without looking, suppressing a sigh. Hermione smiled.
“I haven’t told him, no,” Lily admitted. Victoire just nodded and leant down, dropping the vials into the box and picking it up before shoving the box back at Teddy to take.
“I have never seen such sorrow,” the bird crooned in reply and Draco pulled his wand out to cast a
I’ve never loved anyone as much as I love you, will never love anyone the way that I love you again. I knew that even when I sat you down and said I had to go. You cried and you screamed and you threw things. Your magic sparked around us, a living angry thing that threatened to consume me. I was ready to let it.
~ ~ ~
He carried his duffel high on his shoulder as he leapt and slid through the crowd. He could see the boat still docked up ahead, but the steam pouring out of it let him know he had to
A high-pitched squeal sounded up from somewhere around Teddy, but Harry wasn’t sure if it was Lily or Victoire.
Draco was sashaying across the stage, singing,
Harry stretched Malfoy open, adding a third finger and curling it upwards to hit that bundle of nerves over and over again, not once pausing his mouth as he did so. Malfoy was a squirming, mewling mess, rocking himself back and forth between Harry’s fingers and Harry’s mouth. He dug his heel into Harry’s back, urging him forward, and Harry moaned around Malfoy’s prick. Just as Malfoy was reaching his peak, Harry released him from his mouth with a pop and pulled his fingers away.
“You’d best be on our side, Aunt Luna,” Victoire’s voice carried through seriously.
–” Harry almost collided with Lavender for the second time that day as the blonde whirled around, the basket sliding down her arm as she put her hands on her hips, but Harry managed to stop just in time. The werewolf stood two steps above him, the furious expression on her face and the fiery glare in her eyes enough to make him put two more steps between them.
“Is that really what you want to do?” Lily began to fidget with her rings, her face turning a light shade of red and a distant expression sliding over her face.
“Harry, long time no see,” Daphne said slowly and Harry smiled sheepishly, running a hand through his hair. When he glanced around the table, it was to find both Lily and Vic watching him intently.
“Draw up the paperwork,” I say. And I stand, ignoring the sputtering of my lawyer, and I leave.
“I was being polite,” Draco grumbled, but he was already wheeling the cart off. Lavender laughed behind him.
Lavender paused at the top of the stairs, looking down at him with a thoughtful expression. When Harry joined her at the entrance to the hotel’s atrium, she still seemed to be looking for something. He didn’t know what.
of surprises for Harry today.
“They are cool!” Vince crowed and Harry laughed.
, do I know.”
“You do. Please, just tell me.”
, he knew it was late without looking. The boys would be back tomorrow in the late afternoon, and he’d been so busy at work all week he still had to get the house ready so really, he should be going to sleep. Instead he filled his glass again and picked up the invitation to look at it even closer, as though he hadn’t memorized the damn thing the moment he opened the thick envelope that afternoon.
“I don’t expect
“Christ, Draco, and you never told them? You never found out?” Pansy pushed for more, simultaneously pushing a fresh glass of margarita towards her friend.
Except Harry still hadn’t had a sip of his new beer, which meant he’d only had two and a half bottles in the four hours they’d been there. The buzz he was feeling was definitely not from his drinks. Malfoy’s hand didn’t move from the top of Harry’s thigh, but his foot – which Harry realized was the one opposite him as Malfoy sat with his legs tightly crossed – continued to slide up his leg. Harry clenched his fists on top of the table and tore his gaze away from Malfoy, only to see Hermione looking right at him with both brows raised. He flushed a deep red and looked down at his drink instead.
almost as much as he had when he returned from Greece. She was just getting out of the hospital. Unlike Harry, however, she was able to keep away from even the photojournalists with absolutely no boundaries and eventually faded away from one news cycle to the next. Harry had heard that she had gone to the continent instead of back to Hogwarts, but despite losing track of her he had still never expected her to pop up
Molly came back with a thick piece of parchment in her hands. Malfoy took it from her outstretched hands, much to Harry's protest.
Malfoy pretended to think about it. "What's the magic word, Potter?"
"Nothing," Harry lied. "She and Ron, uh, argued."
"No, Professor," Draco cut in. "Show us the memories."
"But what if it
The Slytherin screamed as his body ripped to shreds, just like Voldemort's. Harry smiled gleefully at the ash pile and felt a pang in his head as he woke up.
"Hey, Draco," he said into the kisses. He heard a sigh come from somewhere else in the room, but all that mattered at that moment was Draco.
"You're quite the flirt now, aren't you?" he heard Malfoy bellow. Harry sent a scowl down the stairs. He walked down the hallway and entered the first door he reached. It was an empty room, pale with splotches of grime and grease plastering its walls. He closed the door with a grimace before continuing down.
"Don't be. It's not your fault," she said quietly. "I guess this is the end of our friendship."
"How does it feel being the school's favorite fags?" Smith sneered. Harry launched himself at him, but Draco held him back.
”Eight... Nine. Ten.”
The Auror glared at her. "It's not just a new partner, Hermione, it's fucking Draco Malfoy! Why'd me and Ron have to switch anyways? We worked fine together!"
"I guess we'll have to find out."
"That was different. The whole world was at risk!" Harry argued.
"You're so immature!" Parvati said, though she too was holding back a laugh.
"Will everyone stop saying that?" Harry and Ron groaned.
All was well.
"We'll get past this," Harry said soothingly, repeating Draco's previous words. "It's just a silly crush. She'll get over it."
“We’re not,” Harry said, eyes still narrowed. “Not that it’s any of your business.”
The present Harry looked towards the other two to see their eyes widening at the horror they witnessed. Neither of them were paying him any attention. Their eyes were on the pitiful six-year-old that cried out for his mum.
Harry sagged in his arms and whimpered. He turned around in the blond’s arms and looked at him with fearful eyes.
"What about the fact you like in a fucking mud hut?" he exclaimed.
"I'm thirty-seven, a piggy-back ride won't kill me," Harry snorted. Lily took Draco's hand and forced him to crouch down on the ground to look at her.
Harry gave him the finger. "What do you want?"
"Harry, please," the Headmistress sighed. "You aren't crazy. The fact that you've told us about this voice is good because now we can use it to see what might be wrong with you."
"I'm not saying no!" Harry said quickly.
"No! He wanted to wait! We didn't complete the bond!" Draco said, self-loathing seeping into his words.
Molly sighed. "Alright."
Harry swallowed it, his eyes fluttering closed. Madam Pomfrey looked at Draco with eyes filled with wonder.
"She's still alive," he reassured Harry. "I think she drunk herself out." Malfoy gestured to the empty liquor bottles that were scattered around the limp form, liquid oozing out of them.
He had his wand thrust at him, and his tie loosened. Pulling the knife out from inside him, he got up and faced himself.
"Draco... your eyes," Harry breathed. "What's wrong with them?"
"I'm sorry," he said again, willing the blood in his cheeks to go down.
"Because I'm the fucking Boy Who Lived, that's how," Harry growled, crouching down and looking at her with disgust. He punched her, causing her to fall back, blood spurting out of her nose.
”you- have feelings for me?” Harry breathed. His heart was hammering in his chest.
"You better be ready to not walk tomorrow," the Veela teased, his hands already pulling off Harry's shirt.
"Look at what he's done to you, Harry," Sirius said, placing a hand on the boy's shoulder. "He never loved you. No one does this to ones they love."
"You're eyes!" Harry exclaimed. This was unreal. Was Draco pulling a prank on him? The only people who had eyes like that were-
"Potter, don't tell me you've lost the slip of paper!" Malfoy groaned. Harry scowled at him.
But he had to eat something to gain his energy. He felt drained, and he knew he had alarmingly large bags under his eyes.
As he mutilated the worm, Harry's mind wandered to the area he had warned himself to shut off. He didn't listen to his smarter self and proceeded to remember Snape's tears, Dumbledore falling... falling. Everything flashed, and suddenly he was staring down at Dobby's grave.
the potion! But what had gone wrong?
face!"
Malfoy snarled. "Well, Potter, I suggest you suck it up. This is your fault, after all," he said, looking pointedly at the bandages on Harry's hand.
Pansy was roughly grabbed from her bed by her hair and Filch dragged her out of the dungeons and dropped her at Harry's feet.
"I can't believe I thought you felt guilty," he said, chuckling. "If you'd just owned up to your mistake, I would've tried to forgive you. But even after attempting to kill me, you have the audacity to stand there and make excuses? And saying that love made you do it? You fucking bitch!"
"I don't know."
"Weasel, don't be difficult."
And Harry did. He turned his attention to the way Draco's hand had his in a tight grip. He could feel the scars and callouses on his palm and fingertips and the thought of them mapping his skin made them shiver.
Harry felt his stomach tighten when he saw Hermione in the middle of the room, fidgeting slightly.
After Draco left, Harry strode up to Hermione and engulfed her in a hug. She stiffened in his arms.
Harry made to flee the room before remembering Malfoy, who sat on the other bed with an air of annoyance. "Forget about me, Potter?"
Harry watched her leave with resentment. It was easy for her to comfort him! She didn't have to work with bloody Draco Malfoy. He sighed, lifting his head from the desk and taking the case file she had left. A murder in Piton Street of an old Muggle woman and her dog.
McGonagall looked at him pitifully. "Cheer up, Potter. It's not like you to give up hope so easily."
"I'm sorry," Harry said, stopping in his tracks. "If I had known-"
"Ah, Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy." The door opened fully to reveal a woman in her mid-thirties. She had dark brown hair and dull eyes, and a small child tugging at her clothes.
, it hissed.
Harry smiled and leaned back into his husband's embrace. "How'd work go?"
Harry spoke up. "Professor, we understand that the potion definitely had something in it that shouldn't have been there. But what was it?"
Harry groaned, covering his face with his hands. "What if Hermione's right. What if that is what this voice is? The part of Voldemort that never left me?"
Draco's grip on Harry's robe slackened, and Harry shot forward, grabbing Smith by his collar and lifting him a foot up into the ground. Smith gasped for air.
"Jesus!" Harry muttered under his breath.
However, the Ministry had claimed Molly's children, and they had made it clear she was not going to get them back anytime soon.
Harry felt sweat on the back of his neck. He had been avoiding Ginny. Their messy breakup had been the cause of that.
"Let's ask him if anyone ever showed interest," Harry said, whipping out his phone. He dialed Henley's number, and a soothing male voice greeted him on the other end.
"Your mother was, uh, killed in her sleep by the Killing Curse on the fifth of July," Harry recited. "Do you know anyone who would have a motive for doing this?"
"Agh, my head," Harry moaned. His vision came into focus as he sat up slowly, looking around. Draco's head was resting on his lap, his legs dangling off the edge of the bed as he lay horizontally.
He sat up and looked around the Hospital Wing. Draco refused to let him go. Wait...
but he doesn't have time to talk to me? And what about that message: 'does your husband know'?"
The words were like a slap in the face. Draco’s face paled and he reached out to him. “Harry-”
"No, he wasn't involved in my life before, so I see no reason for him to be now."
"The only thing I learned from the War was to never listen to my parents ever again," Malfoy growled. "War changed me, Potter. Maybe even more than it changed you."
Once the lesson ended, Harry, Ron, and Hermione left the lesson together.
They ended up sitting on the floor, with Harry in Draco’s lap and with Draco leaning against the wall. Harry began crying again after a few minutes.
"I loved Lola. It was the child I didn't love. I don't regret leaving her, although I regret not being there for her when she died," Henley said, looking at Harry with ill-concealed shame in his eyes. Harry gave him an encouraging smile.
"But, by God's grace, they were safe. They came out whole and in one piece," she smiled.
Professor Flitwick called over to the two from where he was talking with the Professor Sprout. "Boys! The Headmistress is asking for you!"
"Ron, calm down. What is it?" Harry asked, a little disturbed. Ron shook his head and proceeded to drag Harry to the briefing room. Robards was sat at the head of the long table, looking somber.
Draco felt tears sting his eyes. “I won’t hurt you. It’s me, Draco. I love you, Harry. I will never hurt you. Ever. I promise.”
Draco shook his head at Harry. They got in bed and slept soundly, arms wrapped tightly around the other, a habit that helped the two boys get through nightmares.
Harry held up his hands in defense. "Hey! It was Draco who thought so!"
"And how the fuck could you think otherwise, you blundering idiot?"
"Boys," she said, avoiding their gaze. "Please take a seat."
"It feels wonderful, Smith, truly," Draco answered. "But how does it feel being captain of the worst House team Hogwarts has ever seen? Your seeker lost to a first-year."
"No," he said, his eyes lowering onto the table. "I didn't mean it like that."
"Hermione!" he sobbed. "Please, make it stop!"
"NO! YOU DON'T!" Harry wailed, pressing his head into the mattress. "YOU KNOW NOTHING!"
"Cheer up, Malfoy. It isn't the end," Harry said, although he too sounded dejected. Malfoy thought for a moment.
"But we got through it together, Harry! This is different," Hermione said.
Harry was at a loss for words. "Hermione, he's... he's broken inside."
"How the fuck are we going to live through this, Potter?"
But couldn't a guy hope?
"You're a... special case, Potter," Draco had said. Harry tried to ignore the butterflies fluttering in his stomach at those words.
"It has to be a proper kiss, not just some peck on the cheek." there was a murmur of agreement. "Whoever refuses to kiss the person they got will have to endure a Petrificus Totalus and will have to stay in the corridor until Filch finds them."
A light blush appeared on Draco's cheeks. "I'm a death eater, Harry. I'm not good enough for the Golden Boy."
Hermione flushed angrily. "I'll have you know, Malfoy, I can fire you and make your name so radioactive that not even Borgin and Burkes will offer you a job."
"Tell me," he said simply. Harry cocked his head to the side in confusion.
"It doesn't matter," Harry said, running a hand through his tousled hair, messing it up even more. "Just get what you need."
Pomfrey nodded. "All you have to do is hold his hand while I perform the spell."
It had landed in front of Harry Potter.
Harry woke up on a dark surface. He was all alone. Blood coated his body like a layer of skin, and his body shook in pain.
"Come on! There have to be other people with intentions of hurting Harry!" Ginny said exasperatedly, coming back from where she was pacing in front of the window. She had tear tracks on her cheeks, and she wiped at them, flushing.
Harry and Draco had resigned from their position as Aurors two years ago, after encouraging each other to pursue their true dreams. Harry became a Mind-Healer, and Draco was now a Curse-Breaker.
Draco moved away from his mouth, making Harry whine from the loss, and proceeded to whisper sweet nothings as he moved down the brunet's neck. Harry could only pull him closer as he began to form love bites all over his neck.
Draco grinned as the pair's lips met again, this time with more passion. Harry rolled over so he was beneath Draco, gulping a little from the ravenous gleam in the blond's eyes.
Harry cut him off with a kiss. “Draco, it’s okay. I know you didn’t mean it. I’m sorry, too. I shouldn’t have been so controlling.”
“Harry, come on,” Hermione reasoned, exasperated. “They were children! You shouldn’t hold it against them-“
Harry was surprised at Hermione’s happy expression. If Draco had said that to him he would have been boiling with fury and rage. She went back inside to make another cup for Ron and Harry followed her.
They stood there for a few minutes until Malfoy sighed. "Can't you even remember what the password was about?"
He stood up quickly and tried to run away but his eyes were unfocused and he tripped over his own feet. “Get away from me!”
"One person will drink the potion, and the other will ask them three questions, to which the drinker will have to answer truthfully! Please make a record of the questions asked and the answers given for me to look at later!" Slughorn beamed.
Draco didn’t fall asleep. He stroked Harry’s hair repeatedly and whispered comforting words in his ear, hoping to ward off any bad things trying to enter his dreams.
Harry's back stiffened as he turned around to face a very happy Ginny Weasley.
"You need to give me ten galleons now," Ron said bluntly, holding out a hand.
"They aren't very grand to me!" Henley said, an amused sparkle to his eyes. "I don't want any, kiddo. It's not much to wrap your head around."
"Harry, look," Draco began. "You shouldn't be with someone like me."
”He must have said some things too, if your eyes are so red,” Ron said angrily.
"Bye!" Hermione said to the two boys as they parted ways, her warm smile lingering over Draco for a little longer than he found comfortable.
Malfoy cleared his throat and squinted at the paper before turning his wand on Harry with a maniacal grin.
"It's not just my fault! It's your fault too!" Harry spat. "You got your tears in there!"
"Oh yeah? Who else have you interrogated?" Rob seethed.
”Maybe a little,” he said, rubbing his sore eyes. Hermione’s heart went out to him.
”Fuck them! They’re just sad old people with sad old lives with nothing better to do,” Malfoy said angrily. Harry laughed a little, making Malfoy smile.
"Ron would-" Draco mentally slapped himself when Hermione shut down.
destroyed?" Hermione pressed on.
"In our fifth year," Harry began slowly. "I would dream of the Department of Mysteries. I would try to get through the door that led to the Prophecy. You know, the one that said I was destined to defeat Voldemort and shit."
"I don't think you're crazy," Draco said gently, wrapping an arm around Harry's shoulders amicably.
"I understand, Weasley," Draco said honestly. "I didn't want to accept my love for Harry either. But seeing him kissing you-"
"There were quite a few," Henley mused. "But I turned them all away."
"Smith." the boy looked down at Draco, who sat on the ground with blood-stained clothes and tear-stained cheeks. "Rot in hell."
"Not love, huh?" Ron said knowingly, elbowing Harry in the ribs. Harry smacked him.
Harry gasped as Malfoy edged a bit closer and wrapped a cautious arm around his waist. "Don't you have anything to help you?"
”I can bloody well see that. What was it about now?” the ginger asked, plopping down into the space next to Harry. The brunet shrugged.
"Pack your stuff and go to that office," Harry snarled, turning on his heel and deserting the girl. Pansy dropped to her knees and started to cry. She had lost
"Ah, Draco! What are you doing here?" Harry asked, slightly alarmed.
Harry stiffened at the familiar voice. Ron and Hermione got up and left, obviously wanting to give the two privacy. Draco sat down on the bed next to Harry.
"I told you, I don't know anything!" Rob cried, thumping his fist down on the table violently. Harry glared at the man and pushed the vial of Veritaserum before him.
"What happened?" Harry asked groggily. "How long have I been asleep?"
Smith flushed. "You can't talk, Death Eater scum. Always on the losing side, aren't you, Malfoy?"
"Get back!" Molly screeched. "Back, I say!"
"What are you on about?" Malfoy sneered.
"Ah, sorry, Harry," Draco said, wrapping an arm around his and rubbing his back. "I didn't mean to say his name-"
"I'm sorry, Malfoy," Harry said. Malfoy's eyes squeezed shut with pain and old memories.
"Or just move to a different seat!" Seamus piped in from beside him. Neville swatted his arm.
"Mr. Malfoy, in all my years I have never-"
"Give it up, Potter!" the Slytherin Harry yelled amidst the chaos, his grin widening at the sight of Harry's blood pooling on the dark floor. "You're dying!"
"Boys, please," she said tiredly. They turned to look at her resignedly.
He engulfed the man in the hug, and Sirius returned it eagerly.
It was about time he got some fucking answers.
And they stayed like that until they grew tired, and the sky darkened through the curtains.
"He was just trying to protect me!" Harry said fiercely. "He didn't do anything wrong."
Harry woke to Draco's face nuzzling his neck. His arms were wrapped tightly around him, preventing Harry from leaving the bed. Carefully, Harry tried to unwrap Draco's arms from his waist, but they tightened instinctively and his eyes opened.
"That really isn't helping, Harry!"
"The husband hasn't seen her in thirty-five years. I doubt we'll get anything off him," Harry pointed out. Malfoy frowned.
Harry pouted a little. Draco leaned in to kiss it away but snapped his head back when he heard Slughorn approaching them. The professor had two vials and gave one to Harry and Draco.
"Something wrong?" Harry asked.
"Gryffindor doesn't stand a chance against them," she moaned.
”I’m so sorry you couldn’t work with us, mate,” Ron said sympathetically. “I couldn’t imagine having to work with them two!”
Harry's eyes turned as big as saucers. "So what you're saying is that I could die."
“It’s okay, Ron, I get it.”
It was large, and Harry could tell the inhabitants were well-off. The door creaked open a little, and a pair of teary eyes and a watery smile met them.
"Mmm, I love you." the blond froze. Harry slapped his hand over his mouth and his eyes widened.
Harry smirked and nodded, and the two made their way out of the office and towards the Ministry entrance.
Eventually, Harry stopped crying. He hiccuped and shook slightly before dozing off to sleep.
"Yeah," Harry smiled. "Look, Hermione, I'm sorry but-"
“I suppose it does,” Malfoy said, happily. “Woe to me!”
Harry screamed in pain once again, and his spell started to fade as he ran out of energy.
"One would think, as Minister, you'd have more pressing matters to attend to, Granger," Malfoy said lazily.
"Of course."
"I will kill you!" the other said, although his confidence wavered.
"You mean to say you're making us your lab rats?" Harry growled. Draco put a soothing hand on Harry's back, making the brunet flinch. Draco's hand stiffened, and dropped down into his lap.
"I'll tell you later," Draco waved his hand dismissively. "Harry, I need to know who pushed you off that Tower."
"Hufflepuff will have an easy win," Draco said in Harry's ear as if he didn't know.
"Yup," Harry smirked, propping himself up on one elbow and looking down at his mate.
"What do you mean?" Harry asked although he had a shroud suspicion.
"You know it's going to be hard to get permission for that," Draco pointed out. Harry waved it off.
"That was it?" Harry wondered.
"You'd rather have a month's detention over a little kiss?" Seamus asked. Ron sighed.
"I've never heard of this kind of thing before, Miss. Granger," she said skeptically.
Ron shook his head. "Was she ever going to tell me? What was I, her boy toy? All those months, did they really mean nothing to her?"
"It was insightful," Draco murmured, carefully hovering over Harry.
To the boys’ bathroom.
Harry took out his wand, and Malfoy did the same.
"It said in the book that the imprint may wear off at some point," Draco said.
He heard a high-pitched scream in the depths of his mind and knew it was his mother begging and screaming for him. But there was no one there to save him this time.
”It doesn’t matter. I was being an ass.”
Harry sighed and set her down. Draco wrapped an arm around his waist. "Stop spoiling our daughter, Harry, or she'll start asking you for piggy-back rides!"
"I know," Draco said glumly. "But actually being here is different, you know. It makes things so much more real!"
," she spat out the last word, and Malfoy practically flew up from his seat.
God, how I loved you. How I love you still. I will feel you in every last bit of me until my dying breath. But I had to be strong for both of us. You deserve better than this. So do I.
“Exactly,” Draco said coolly. “It’s been
“I may have already had a bit of whiskey,” he admitted quietly as he brushed the soot out of his hair. With another sigh, he dropped unceremoniously into the chair beside the couch and took the proffered glass of wine with a tight smile. Hermione chose to ignore his statement.
The trio spun together on cue, returning to marching in place as they sang one more time,
“I’d really like to travel. See the world, you know?” She sighed. “But Dad needs me. He can’t run this place alone. I mean, I know he has Auntie Lav and Uncle Greg, but it’s not the same. And don’t tell anyone else this, but I think they’re going to have their hands full with another baby soon.” Harry’s brows rose. Lily looked at him with a grin. “They think nobody else knows yet, and I don’t think Dad does, but I’m smarter than they give me credit for.” Harry laughed.
“So what’s this Lavender was telling me about Lily playing Mamma Mia?” Greg changed the topic instead. Draco groaned and finally turned away from the door.
“Oh how lovely. How is little Vince? Did she say?” Hermione frowned in confusion.
“Alright, so you weren’t ready. So instead, you just abandoned me here and went back to England and had the family you always wanted.”
~ ~ ~
“The longest, but Lily is ok.” He perked up a little at that. He felt his wife’s hand come to cover his, his arm still across her shoulders.
aunt,” Pansy mumbled, cracking an eye open to glare at the awkward, gawking figure of Teddy.  “Yes?”
“Ladon keeps attacking Geronimo,” Charlie explained. Lily’s eyes widened.
“Lily, did you send them all invitations?”
Harry could feel his mouth go dry with every word. He knew this song. Draco had sung it to him once. Their second night in bed together twenty years ago. Draco had sung it to him gently as they snuggled, and had tried so hard to stay on key when Harry began to mouth at his neck. The song had made Harry’s heart soar, but the moans it had devolved into had left him floating. There were times that Harry wished desperately he didn’t remember every moment in such vivid detail, but no matter what else his brain dumped over the years Harry could
“What am I to do with this then? Add it to the slideshow?”
“Don’t worry; we were just as surprised as you.”
“How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they’re leaving!”
“Do you think...do you think Dad has seen him yet?” Lily looked back up at her friend, a sudden look of concern on her face. Vic sighed at the change in topic and then smiled softly.
“And probably ‘Dromeda,” Ron reminded him, pointing a finger in Harry’s direction. “Even if Malfoy does still blame her for Lily being a Hufflepuff.” Ron laughed at his own joke.
Luna had just thrown the door open, returning to her tea break from an emergency that had called her away, when the fireplace flared green and a familiar blonde head of curls sheepishly peered up at her. Luna’s brows rose as she fell into her chair by the fire and looked down in amusement at the young woman’s face peering anxiously up at her.
“Hey, mate!” a distant voice chirped a happy greeting and Harry managed to turn his head in time to see his other best friend stroll through the door with a full bottle of wine. “Is it the invitation then?”
“Wrong! I am.”
you do.”
, he was so screwed.
“Oh goodness, I’m so sorry,” a voice huffed at him, pulling the basket brusquely away. Harry bundled a handful of the flowers in his arm and looked up just as he put them on top of some eucalyptus branches the basket still held.
“Welcome, ladies and friends!” The crowd cheered loudly. “For one night, and one night only, the Malfoy Taverna is proud to present the one, the only, the world’s first Girl Power band–”
Benny Andersson, the island’s only resident African gray, was a sixty-year-old enigma on Kalokairi. No one was quite sure how he got there or who he belonged to, but he was often found quoting Abba songs to the delight of tourists and the annoyance of residents.
The music began to crescendo, the blood pumping through Lily’s veins harder than it ever had. If she had been sober, she would think about how ironic this all was. Here she was, trying to follow her favorite musical and Mamma Mia her way into figuring out who her other father was, and it was all blowing up in her face. In the musical, everything was sorted out. But in real life, Lily was suddenly panicking because she wasn’t sure that it would. She could only imagine what Alex would say when he knew exactly what she had done. She tried very hard not to imagine the rage her dad would be in when
“Fancy Draco with his grown-up daughter!” Lily grinned right back.
“I wish I was here then.” The only response was a rather undignified snort.
“Daph, I’m not a girl,” Draco’s frustrated stage whisper could be heard.
“Why is that bird even allowed in this bloody kitchen!?”
“If you finish stocking the rooms on the east side with towels, I’ll be more than alright,” Lavender said, pushing a cart Draco only just realized she had towards him. He groaned but took it all the same. “Hey! You said not to push myself on your account.”
“Malfoy’s?” Lavender looked at him then and raised both brows at him. Looking back on it, Harry would realize that she wasn’t particularly surprised by his reply. Rather, she seemed almost expectant. At the time, Harry simply continued, “Is that why you’re here then?”
He was already slinging his duffel bag over his shoulder before the girl had finished speaking. He waved a brief thank you without looking back, but then a flash of red hair on the boat’s deck caught his attention. He saw the steam go up and he pushed himself faster.
“And you say it’s definitely Charlie.”
“Oh. Oh no!” Lily tried to plead with him, to make this stop.
“I’m heading there now. Get in,” Charlie said, waving to the gate at the other end of the boat. Harry threw his duffel over the side and then walked down to the gate. He opened it and made the short jump from the dock to the boat, not wanting to delay Charlie by pulling out the ramp. It was a nice boat, Harry thought as he looked around. Small, but well suited to Charlie for however long he was using it for. It was a thirty-one-foot fishing boat, with a small loft over the covered portion of the deck where the steering platform was located. A short stairwell beside the ladder led to a magically enlarged cabin just below where Harry was sure a bed was located.
I wanted to be angry. I really did. But what right did I have when I was the one who left? And before my anger could bubble over and explode, it froze with the rest of me. I remembered how tired I was. Of all of it. I just…deflated.
Daphne’s eyes widened and a brief expression of panic crossed her face before she managed to school it into something calmer. Her responding smile was something Harry only ever saw on Slytherins.
“What invitation?” Hermione asked, her brow furrowing as she looked between her husband and her friend. Her expression told Harry she already knew, but he appreciated her feigned ignorance anyway.
“Right, right. Listen, who’s giving you away?” Lily could feel her face turn red. She gaped for a moment and then shook her head.
He traced the delicate gold lettering with one hand, slowly swirling a glass of whiskey with his other. He leaned back in his home office chair and took a long sip of his drink, his gaze never leaving the smooth cardstock invitation. Tempted though he was to cast a
“Dinner smells good,” she said, following him into the kitchen.
“Lucky thing.” Lily grinned up at him and Charlie couldn’t help the frown tugging at his lips. Her smile just seemed so familiar…Later, he’d blame his outburst on the drink.
Daphne rubbed soothing circles into his back as Draco choked back a sob. It wouldn’t do to weep over a decades old situation that didn’t matter anymore. Draco had made his choice, had lived with it, and now he would have to face the consequences. Or try to keep his head on straight in the hopes that his friends would help him cover it up for the rest of forever, even if Lily did push for answers more and more every year. Logically, he knew it wasn’t fair to her, but he just wasn’t ready yet. Surely Daphne and Pansy would understand that, even if Lily wouldn’t.
Kalokairi, Greece. He dropped his hands to the desk to look at the location on the invitation again. There was more information in the envelope he left to the side, but he didn’t need it. He knew exactly how to find the little magical island off the coast of Naxos in the South Aegean. The memories of the quaint little island alone made it tempting to accept the invite. If he had received it, surely he was welcome? Surely Malfoy wouldn’t chase him right back to the continent? It was a public island. Even without the invitation, he had a right to be there. But was that really how he wanted to see Malfoy after all these years?
~ ~ ~
“Harry, Uncle Charlie, this is my friend Lily,” Teddy announced. “Lily, this is my godfather Harry and my uncle Charlie.” The girl stepped forward, large grin on her face, and held her hand out to Harry.
“I mean, he’s been friends with your dad since they were little, yeah? So why wouldn’t Draco just invite him?” Lily shrugged.
“Vic, let’s talk.” Vic rolled her eyes and tugged her wrist free.
“But you don’t think Lily invited them all because...?”
Harry remembered his brief goodbye with her. He was leaving earlier than she expected, but she hadn’t made him explain a thing. She had just looked at him and had seemed to just
“Be quiet, Benny,” Draco hissed, turning again to glance through the window to see if anyone had heard the obnoxiously loud African gray. Thankfully, the diners seemed to be too enraptured with the breakfast buffet options to care about the noise coming from the kitchen.
“Fuck,” Harry hissed quietly, closing his eyes in an attempt to get his bearings. His mouth was dry and his heart was racing as a pool of warmth began to coil in his abdomen. When he opened his eyes again, Malfoy was looking right at him with a smirk on his face. Harry licked his lips, he couldn’t help it, and when he watched Malfoy’s gaze dip down, he suddenly found himself biting back a groan. Surely his sensitive reaction was just the alcohol buzzing through his veins?
“I didn’t either.” Lily chewed on her bottom lip, and Vic knew that look well. It was the expression Lily always wore as she tossed an idea around in her mind, usually before sharing some harebrained scheme or wild dream. That look Vic knew she got from her dad. But just as Lily opened her mouth to speak, a shadow fell over their table and the girls looked up into the nervous grin of Vic’s vote for Lily’s other father.
“One night. One number!”
“How could I not? You two were dancing queens at my house for New Year’s,” the woman laughed, and suddenly it clicked. Daphne Greengrass. She looked practically the same, just a little aged. How could he forget Draco’s oldest friend?
“Oh no! Percy stopped talking to Oliver when he came out with Marcus.”
According to muggle mythology, the Greek god Dionysus was born and raised on the island of Naxos. However, before the Statue of Secrecy spread across Europe, it was originally said that Dionysus was born on Kalokairi at the end of August. Though celebrations of the god throughout the world vary by location, inhabitants of the magical island still celebrate the month of his birth through to the middle of September. The island itself, almost as though it is celebrating along with its people, is said to be at its most magically fertile during this time. Male pregnancies aren’t unheard of in the magical world, though they are exceedingly rare without the aid of potions and spells. But in Kalokairi, during the Feast Month of Dionysus, they’re almost expected.
“I didn’t know you were friends with Draco,” Harry mused aloud. When he glanced up at his ginger friend, the man was focused entirely on the sea before them, but a wide grin split his face in two.
, we are not
“Mummy!” the little boy cried, just now noticing Lavender, and before Draco could say goodbye the boy was bolting to the woman who hadn’t stopped watching them. Harry cleared his throat, and Draco turned his gaze back to Harry. The two stood, staring the other down, until Harry shifted forwards.
“Yeah, she checked me in,” Harry said easily, but he looked anywhere but at Draco. Draco didn’t think anything of it, just swallowed the lump in his throat and nodded, turning around, and made for the doorway again. “It was really nice seeing you, Draco.”
“Ginny?” Lavender nodded this time, smiling a little at the confusion in his voice. “We’re divorced.”
“Sorry, can you tell me when the next boat to Kalokairi is?” he asked, making sure his voice sounded as gentle and patient as possible. The girl smiled at him.
“I think we’ll leave them on,” Harry said softly and then turned his head slightly to press a kiss to the inside of Malfoy’s ankle just above the strap. The skin was softer than he had imagined it to be. Malfoy’s face flushed pink, his mouth dropping open as he gazed up wantonly at Harry and the dark-haired man just smiled.
“Well, you moved on to some guy who knocked you up and didn’t stick around!” Harry jumped to his feet, glaring down at Draco as though his decisions had personally slighted the younger man.
“Bill and Fleur will be there, on account of Victoire,” Ron said against the lip of his glass. “So you’ll probably know someone.”
Harry kissed back hard, tongues and teeth clashing almost painfully but he didn’t care. He was just trying to consume Draco, to pour twenty years' worth of anguish and loss and resentment into that kiss. And Draco drank all of it. It wasn’t until he felt the tug at his flies that Harry even realized Draco had moved his hands at all. Harry gasped against the thin lips still crushing his, Draco using the opportunity to grasp Harry’s lower lip between his teeth and bite down. Harry moaned, his hips arching into Draco’s touch.
the silent type – which came in handy for situations like this: being able to observe such sweet moments between his two favorite people in the world and just letting his heart swell. Besides, Draco might have sent him for guarding, but Lavender had sent him for observation.
“I didn’t know your dad could laugh like that,” Vic finally said. Lily huffed out a laugh and turned a sad smile at her friend.
“You certainly are.” Harry smiled at her and then leaned over and nudged his shoulder against hers. “I think you should travel, though. While you’re still young and have the energy for it. You deserve to see the world. Draco would understand.” Lily rolled her eyes, her grin growing wider.
“He has, has he?” Charlie chimed in, a frown tugging at his lips even as his eyes sparkled in amusement.
“It’s good to see you, Draco,” Daphne said with a returning smile, but Pansy looked like she was trying not to laugh.
“Hey, Harry!” Charlie called down with a grin. He slid down the ladder to the deck and exited the covered portion, coming to rest his arms on the side. “What are you doing out here?”
~ ~ ~
And yet.
“Ask Greg to do it.” She gave him a very pointed look and he sighed. “Alright, I’ll call them. Does Greg have everything he needs?”
“Little flower,” Nico called, letting go of Daphne and Charlie and carefully stepping through the barrier. Geronimo just huffed, but Lily looked up at him with a smile. “It is time.” Lily frowned.
“Charlie Weasley.”
“Unccy Teo! Unccy Teo!”
“I would have been more believable, you know. Pansy was too doting.”
“Good. I was hoping to steal the bride-to-be away for a little while today! I don’t know nearly enough about this Alexander fellow as I’d like to.”
“I think there’s a part of me that didn’t exist before the boys, but I’m not so sure I ever let go of my life before them. Or parts of it, anyway,” Harry finally admitted.
“I like how tight your arse looks in them,” Harry murmured against Malfoy’s lips. He gave the blonde a squeeze as if to emphasize his point. “I like how bloody beautiful your confidence in them makes you look. They’re bloody gorgeous on you.”
“Fuck you, Pans.”
“I love him,” Harry blurted out. “I love him and I want to spend the rest of my life with him. No jokes. I need to win him back. I need to.”
~ ~ ~
“If I had known wearing my heels in front of you would lead to that, I would have done it years ago,” Malfoy sighed. He seemed to realize what he had said because his body suddenly stiffened and he began to draw back. But Harry just laughed and tightened his grip around Malfoy’s waist, pulling him flush against his body.
“Wasn’t it?”
“Sing a new song, Chiquitita!”
Harry wasn’t exactly sure how he ended up at the taverna bar beside Charlie and Theo. He had gone looking for Draco to talk to him, to apologize for earlier, and had been directed here by Lavender. Perhaps one drink would be a good idea, something to fortify himself with before confronting the love of his life. Because that was Harry’s plan tonight. Draco kept evading him, kept finding ways to get away, but Harry was determined this time.
“Of course not,” she scoffed, and Draco smirked.
“Right, well, Mamma Mia is her favorite. That’s the ABBA one about the girl who invites three men to a wedding because they might all be her dad. And. Well.”
“I’m going to do what I’ve always done – help Dad run the hotel.” Lily shrugged and Harry frowned.
surprised to be playing the role of prevent-Mamma-Mia-babysitter. He was down at the docks early that morning under the premise of accepting and signing for the food order coming in on the first boat, an admittedly true reason. Usually, though, Mikhos was the one who did receiving for the Villa Ariadne kitchen. But Pansy didn’t want to get up this early and Greg was usually up this early anyway, so here Greg was taking the “morning shift” as Draco had called it the night before.
But I saw you when we left. They made us leave at different entrances, but I was rounding the corner to get to the apparition point and there you were. With him. You stood with your hands in your coat pocket and he stood close, gazing up at you, with his hands in your pockets too. You looked so happy. I hadn’t seen a smile that soft, an expression that fond in years.
“Come on. Let’s go see Geronimo.”
“When’s the wedding?” Hermione asked, as though she didn’t already know. Harry knew there was nothing Ron knew that he didn’t tell Hermione. There was no doubt in his mind she didn’t know about the floo call Harry had had with Ron earlier that day when he had first received the invitation.
“Maybe.”
Despite his years on the Gryffindor quidditch team and his use of a broom at work, Charlie learned twenty years ago that he wasn’t fond of flying over an ocean so this time, he had gone out of his way to rent a little boat (dubbed
~ ~ ~
“Wait! Please wait!” he shouted, trying to wave it down with his free hand as he pushed himself to move faster. He cursed this area for being so muggle he couldn’t just Apparate. He also cursed himself for getting so out of shape just because he wasn’t in the field anymore. None of it mattered though. The boat’s ramp had already been pulled back.
“It’s just that he’s talked about you both so much–”
“You don’t have to do that, ‘Moine, but thank you,” Harry said with a tired smile. He set his empty wine glass down and stood, stretching his long limbs. “Alright, that’s that then. I’ll RSVP in the morning. What’s the worst that could happen?” Ron and Hermione shared another look.
, love. But there’s a right way and a wrong way to go about this.”
“And what kind of DNA testing are you interested in learning about? Cancer markers? No? Then perhaps…paternity testing?”
“Oy!” a voice from the doorway interrupted. The pair turned on the spot, their hands coming to their wands instinctively until their minds registered the couple at the door. “So you thought you were too good to come meet us at the docks?”
“Are you doing okay today? Don’t push yourself on my account,” Draco said, frowning at her too-tired appearance. She had been running herself ragged for him and for Lily. Lavender barked out a laugh; Draco reminded himself to treat Lavender and Greg to a long vacation after this.
Harry reached behind him and wrapped his hand around one of Malfoy’s ankles. Malfoy easily bent his knee when Harry brought his heeled foot up and let the dark-haired man lift his leg higher until his foot was even with Harry’s head.
And then Draco’s fingers were wrapped around his cock. Harry could have cried. Might have done. The long, nimble fingers he had spent years staring at and watching, coveting, dreaming about. The pale, slim hands he had missed for far too long were bringing him bliss he hadn’t felt in years. His heart pounded in his chest.
“We all saw those memories last night–” Lily turned bright red and looked away again,“–and Harry is more likely just based on frequency. It’s simple arithmetic, Lily!”
“Why?” she asked softly, following the rest of them out of the Wrangler. She looked up into the large cave they had parked in front of, the entrance to the Skrill enclosure.
“I packed two.”
Harry bit down on the soft flesh of Malfoy’s calf, just above his ankle, and sucked on the skin until a small, dark mark appeared beneath his lips. Malfoy whimpered, but only bit down harder on his lip. Harry licked and kissed along Malfoy’s ankle, loosening the strap only enough to slip his thumb between the shoe and Malfoy’s foot in order to press it into the middle of Malfoy’s arch. Harry firmly stroked his thumb down over Malfoy’s arch without dislodging the shoe, biting again at his calf, and finally Malfoy released a long, soft moan.
Harry Potter,” Lavender hissed, bringing up a hand to point a finger directly in his face. “That is my
He had written them all letters. He had written Harry twenty-two. They all sat in a box in a dusty attic. Looking at how Charlie and Harry treated his daughter, Draco only just now realized how wrong he was. But there was nothing for it now. He could only keep them from finding out about it like they were in some Broadway musical and after the wedding, find a way to tell Lily. Now he wasn’t afraid of someone taking his daughter from him. He was afraid she would leave when she found out. Draco could feel the tears burning at the back of his eyes and sat down.
“I know.”
As soon as the trio were through the door, they were pulling at their bodysuits. Draco flopped down onto the couch after kicking his heeled boots off, feeling all at once tired and too wired to sleep. He managed to move his legs just in time for Pansy to drop down at his feet. He pushed them into her lap and could imagine her rolling her eyes without looking. For a brief moment, he could picture they were still young and back in school again.
“I wish you’d let me invest in this place,” Pansy said, and Draco paused to scowl at her.
“You can floo us day or night,” Hermione reminded him. “We’ll pay the international fees.”
“Used to being the keyword.”
“Why would she do that!?” Teddy exclaimed at the same time as Lily nodded her head yes and said, “Sure did.” Teddy gaped at her again.
“Very much so. Aunt Adrianne would be so proud of what the Villa has become. I guess it made sense that she changed her mind about what to do with it.” Lily’s brows furrowed and her head tilted as though she had just learned a vital piece of information.
“It’s from the spring. We both know that. We don’t know why it’s acting up, so we’re just going to have to call Basia and Sandrin.”
“Please, come in,” Hermione said softly. Luna raised her brows and took a careful step towards her desk.
“Do you feel that way?” Lily asked him and Harry’s brow furrowed.
~ ~ ~
“Oh.” Draco heard Harry sigh, but he couldn’t look at the other man. Not yet. “I came…to make things right, I guess.”
“Draco,” you break through the arguments, through the water, and your voice is soft. Your smile is so sad. I wonder if you can see the heartbreak on my face or if I’ve managed to keep my expression as cool as I used to.
Malfoy wrapped his arms around Harry’s shoulders almost as tightly as he had wrapped his legs around him. When Malfoy pressed his heels against Harry’s lower back, the dark-haired man began to move. He took his time at first, adjusting his hips slightly with each thrust until he found Malfoy’s prostate again. When Malfoy grasped at him with increasing desperation, he knew that he had found it and he began to slam into the blonde with increasing speed, making sure to hit his prostate with every thrust.
“They’re the most stubborn people I’ve ever met. Quite frankly, I’m surprised we’ve gotten them this far,” Narcissa returned. Greg felt like saying that actually, he was pretty sure the most stubborn person was beside him, but they might not realize how endearingly he meant it when he said it. Besides, despite being a Slytherin, plotting was never his strong suit and he knew better than to offer anything less than a good idea. Lavender leaned forward just a bit, as though they might hear her better when she spoke.
“What’s that?” Ron asked, and Harry turned red as he realized he had said the swear aloud. With great difficulty, he tore his gaze away from his roommate and turned to smile at his best friend.
Draco had wanted to be honest and tell him that he didn’t think so, but he really didn’t know. He was just so emotional by then and despite the support around him, he had felt alone. But even with the fire distorting his face, Draco could read the terror plain as day. And Theo couldn’t risk his very precarious reputation by being with Draco, let alone fathering his child. So Draco had forced a smile onto his face and said that no, his daughter most assuredly did not belong to his friend. Theo never asked the question or anything like it again.
“I know what you think, Vic, and you’re not being fair.” Vic scoffed and rolled her eyes.
The man was quiet and reserved in a way that Lily usually wasn’t, but Teddy grew up with Lily even if the first half of their lives was mostly long distance. He had watched her silently fade into the background, studying the people around her before engaging. Watching her interact with different people through the years was like watching a dozen different sides of his cousin. It didn’t seem to matter if the person was a studious introvert who lived in the library or a sports buff who breathed Quidditch – Lily fit herself in one way or another. Lily had laughed when he mentioned it. She’d called it “social flexibility.” It didn’t seem strange to Teddy that she already had a name for it until he overheard Draco teasing Theo for the same thing. Theo had been around a lot when they were young; Teddy had assumed that perhaps Lily had picked it up from him. Now, Teddy knew that Lily had inherited the trait.
“Egor. You know his name.”
Their voices lowered as the music faded out and they gently finished together,
“They thought they were so cool, strutting around the school like they owned it,” Harry confirmed, lowering his voice like he was sharing a secret. Vince bounced excitedly. “They got into all sorts of trouble together.”
Harry brought his hands up to Malfoy’s hips, slowly sliding them across his lower back and then down to squeeze the blonde’s arse. Gripping the perky, tight globes, Harry ground Malfoy’s hips against him. The height difference made it so that they weren’t really near each other, but Harry ground his hardening length against Malfoy’s thigh as he trapped the blonde’s hard prick against his stomach. Malfoy groaned this time.
“I’ve no idea what you’re talking about. Either of you,” Draco sniffed, turning to look out the window again.
So when the lift reaches the bottom and the doors open, we pull away and right ourselves. I spell the tears from our faces and you smile at me. It’s still so sad, but I think my smile is just as sad too.
“I told you I was in love with you. I was mortified. You were Harry bloody Potter. You always fought for what you wanted. When weeks turned into months without hearing from you, you made it clear that there was nothing from me that you wanted. What was the point in writing to you then?”
“Are you ever going to give that up?” he asked, and Lily glared at him.
“I see you’ve broken a feather,” Benny cawed at Draco, fluttering his wings and puffing out his chest.
Besides, she liked boys. That had to count for something... right? But Luna. She was so perfect, just absolutely beautiful. So kind, and understanding. Ginny would live her whole life without kissing another boy if it meant she could spend it with Luna. What do I do?
“Very well.” He stopped the spell but then cast another. “Imperio!” He forced the spider to stand up. He raised his wand and the spider was raised in the air. He made the spider float all the way to the girl and land on her head before crawling onto her face.

“No, no, I’m sorry. I just- I just-”
“It’s when you like two or more genders, often with a preference. For me I like guys and girls with a slight lean towards guys.” He paused. “Have you really never heard the term bisexual before?”
Maybe coming back for eight year was a bad idea.
“Hello Ginny.”
Your sick, Ginny, and you have to be cured. Your sick. Your sick.
Finding Harry after that was easy, he was on the quidditch pitch.
“Today we’ll be ‘learnin ‘bout flobberworms.” Hagrid pulled out a what looked to be a giant worm.
“Yeah.” Ginny agreed awkwardly. The entire conversation was becoming rather awkward and she supposed that agreeing would end it the quickest. Both girls turned their attention back to the Headmaster, who was preparing to announce the next contestant. The fire had already burst out and Professor Dumbledore had the piece of paper in his hand.
Ginny’s summer had been two things: long and boring. She longed to go back to Hogwarts. She missed the long and winding halls, she missed the paintings that always seemed to have something to say. She missed everything about hogwarts! Even the thought of Peeves made her feel warm and comforted! Most of all she missed Quidditch. She hoped to make the team this year. The year before Mum hadn’t allowed her to try out. She had said it was far to dangerous and Ginny had decided to not push her luck. Maybe this year. Nothing to dangerous had happened the year before, hopefully she should try out this year! Ginny was a pretty good Quidditch player. She had been sneaking out to take her brother’s brooms and practice during the night. She may not have had the nicest broom, or the nicest set of Quidditch balls, (or even a complete set of Quidditch balls) but Ginny had perseverance. She had practiced long and hard for years. She was ready. She was going to ask about joining the Quidditch team.
“We don’t need that, I’ve got some really interesting books right here,” Luna interrupted.
“About a year ago I remember seeing a girl wearing a giant paper mache lion’s head at a quidditch match between Slytherin and Gryffindor. Was that you?”
“What if I helped you sell them during the dinner at Hogwarts?” Ginny asked. She didn’t want the girl going around selling them but if she was with her then maybe she could at least stop some of the bullies from teasing her.
“Anyway, do want to order a butterbeer?” Asked Luna.
Oh god what if he’s caught on?
“I believe it’s a puffapod,” the girl said.
“Um, yes, I suppose. All the boys say so at least and you’ve got to agree that she’s at least a little attractive,” said Luna quickly.
“Don’t be silly, I’m not cold anyway. Come on, let’s head back.” They walked back to hogwarts in a peaceful silence. Once they got back, Luna tried to give her the coat back.
Ginny had a feeling that this year was going to be very eventful
Ginny woke up early the next morning- too early. She and the rest of the family met up with the Diggory’s. Mr. Diggory, Mrs. Diggory, and their son Cedric were waiting for them. Mr. Diggory was standing by something, it looked to be a smallish object protruding from the ground. Mr. Diggory kept talking about the Quidditch match that Harry had the lost the year before to Cedric. It was exhausting really, hearing him brag about his son’s Quidditch abilities. When Ginny glanced over at Cedric she saw his face was bright red, probably from embarrassment. She felt bad for him. Ginny listened as her dad explained that the object in the ground was a portkey. When they touched it, it would take them to the Quidditch World Cup. They were warned to not let go and also that the sensation of being transported was far from pleasant. Mum told everyone to form a circle around the portkey.
Harry
“You’re probably right. But the point is you have a very obvious crush. And I have a slightly less obvious crush as well. And I don’t know about you but I’m tired of moping around in your room all day. We need to take action.”
Ginny smiled so wide it felt like her cheeks would be ripped out. She gave her mother a hug.
Ugh. What would my parents say? I can’t be. I just can’t.
“I like to watch. I’m rubbish at quidditch but I like to think I’m good at cheering the teams on.”
Seriously, where could he have gone?
“Here they are.”
Once she was in History, Ginny pulled out her homework and worked on it. By the time class was over she had finished all of her Herbology homework and half of her Charms paper.
After Pansy gave me an interesting attempt at a pep talk, I decided to just get it over with and ask Potter out.
Ginny managed to peel her eyes of Fleur who was looking rather uncomfortable.
“Umm hello? Sorry it took me so long to come. Are you still here?” A voice asked.
“N-nothing,” she stammered, clearly embarrassed. Ginny wondered why.
It all started one morning during breakfast. Soon it’ll be Holiday Break and Harry and I were talking about where we were going to stay. Hermione, who was taking a brief break from snogging Ron, decided to join in the conversation.
“Fine,” she said.
“There are three schools competing. Hogwarts is one of them, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang are competing as well. This year, Hogwarts will be hosting.”
“Uh oh, this is never good.”
This was not at all helpful. Another thing he forgot to mention was that the lasers in laser tag were not real.
Ginny had been working on a few spells. One of them changed a few strands of her hair black and another made it silky and soft. Once her hair was done she changed into her outfit. It was a suit she’d borrowed from Harry. They’d worked together to use spells that tailored it to fit her better. She was ready.
“Wow,” anyway.
Pansy sighed and ruffled Draco’s hair.
“How about we visit the shrieking shack before we leave,” Ginny suggested. Luna agreed, and they set off to the shack.
“I’m kidding.” Harry looked at me. “But seriously, I’m happy for you. Are you going or have you told your family?”
Ginny wasn’t totally sure what she was talking about, or why she wanted to know whether she had used the spell before. It didn't really matter though, so she dropped the matter.
“I saw him at the quidditch game!” Wait. Victor Crum? Victor Crum was a professional quidditch player. He was very good and one of the youngest in the league. She hasn’t realized he was still in school! And at Hogwarts no less!
Harry nods. And kind of blushes.
Also thANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALMOST 70 KUDOS!! Like I never imagined that I would get that many reads so thank you all.
“I think you're the best.”
---------------
Honestly, I don’t mind these letters too much. I would like to know who you are though. I won’t tell anyone who you are once I find out. Meet me at the top of the astronomy tower at 8:00. Don’t be more than fifteen minutes late. I’ll be waiting.
Ginny knew that Levi was half blood. Levi often passed glares and was quick to blame Ginny of any problems. The other girl was friends with Levi. She knew the other was muggleborn and frankly, terrified of Ginny. She had been since the second year, after she had found out about the “incident”. Ginny couldn’t remember her name. Her roommates weren’t mean but they certainly weren’t nice. For the most part, they ignored her. This was good since Ginny often snuck out.
After she ate, Ginny went back to her dorm and worked on homework. She had three essays to finish and also a dream journal to fill out. It took her all of five hours to finish everything except an essay. By that time it was noon. She quickly looked over her essays and then decided to sought out Luna. Ginny first looked in the great hall but could not find Luna. She had no idea where the common room was so she couldn’t search there. She ended up wandering the castle for what seemed like hours.
“Um, guess I’m the Bi Who Lived, now.”
“Oh. Ok,” she said sadly as she started to walk out the room.
So I searched the castle until I found Potter. It took longer than expected as I didn’t actually know where Potter was and I didn’t know where he typically spent his time. (He ended up being by the lake with Weasley and Granger).
Ginny sat down at her desk in Defense Against the Dark Arts. She’d had a few classes the previous week, but even Professor Moody let them slack off during the entree period. This was the first official class. Once everyone was seated, the Professor started the lesson.
“Maybe, that howl was terrifying,” responded Ginny. Truth was, she knew exactly what went on in that shack. She had overheard her brother’s conversation with Harry once and they ended up explaining it to her. She knew all about Professor Lupin’s... condition and how he went to the shack to transform. She didn’t want to explain that to Luna though, since it wasn’t really their business. Luna shivered and Ginny handed Luna her coat.
What will my parents think? She didn’t know. They had never said much on matter, but whether that was a good thing or bad, she didn’t know. She hoped they would be supportive but there was always that chance... ugh she didn’t know. That seemed to be the answer to everything, I don’t know. She curled up and cried softly for awhile as she tried to think through her thoughts.
Suddenly she had an idea. She just needed Harry’s help to pull it off.
So this was a very bad idea. I’m very much regretting making this decision.
“For me?” Ginny asked.
“Good.” She stands up and walks right over to where I’m laying. “I’ve got to get going now but there’s one more thing I must do.”
The two girls talked for the entire train ride. It seemed like the train ride lasted for days, but in a good way. Ginny couldn’t get enough of Luna. She seemed so mysterious and intriguing. Ginny couldn’t help but feel butterflies in her stomach whenever Luna opened her mouth.
“Really?” Ginny couldn’t really believe it for a moment.
“Jeez, Seamus, calm down,” muttered a Gryffindor.
“It’s perfect. I love it, I really do.” Luna suddenly flung her arms across Ginny in a hug.
“And will you wear that giant lion head?” Ginny teased.
“Do you mind if I sit here?” Luna asked.
I’m sorry this was late. I got pretty sick and I’ve been tired all week. Plus, I’ve been having some major writers block. Hopefully I’ll get the next chapter out on Monday.
Draco began opening up his textbook when Harry said,
He’d come back reluctantly. He didn’t want to, but he felt bad for worrying his friends. He’d stayed cooped up in Grimmauld Place all summer, with Kreacher being his only companion. Hermione, Ron, and most of his other friends had tried to go off on their own too. Hermione found her parents, and spent most of her summer trying to jog their memory of her. Ron took care of his family, who were distraught over Fred’s death. He was invited to spend the summer with the Weasley’s but he had politely declined. He could barely see Ron without feeling guilty, let alone Mrs. Weasley, or worse, George. His eighth year days were now spent engulfed in his studies or avoiding his friends which, in turn, made him even more guilty. The only good thing that had come out of his return to school was his new friendship with Draco. Draco was helping him feel better, and Harry found he enjoyed the blond’s company. Maybe more than he should. The fact was, Harry Potter had a hopelessly romantic crush on one Draco Malfoy. He knew the blond didn’t return his feelings but still, it was fun to hope. He planned to ask Draco to the Wizard Prom and if Draco didn’t say yes, he’d simply oblivolate him. It was a foolproof plan, really.
“Hi harry,” she said.
“You mean the creatures that pull the carriages?” Ginny looked at her in confusion. Pulled the carriages?
She just wanted to deny her feelings. Pretend that she felt no different around Luna than she did around others. Pretend that she was normal.
Eventually Harry explained that the lasers were not, in fact, real. This calmed me down a bit.
Where’s a map when you need one?
“Ok,” Ginny agreed.
Ginny wasn’t totally sure what qualified as being stood up. She just hoped that Luna arrived. After about five minutes (but felt like 3 hours) Luna arrived. She was holding a few books. Ginny gestured towards the empty seat next to her.
“Erm, nothing. Nothing at all. Draco- I mean Malfoy was just, um, he was,” Harry stuttered. He fell silent and then sighed. “I guess the cat’s out of the bag now.”
Hermione looked perplexed. “That’s odd… I never told him we had to study. He’s in the library?” Ginny nodded. “Ok. I’ll go look for him there! Thanks Ginny.” It was rather odd… Harry didn’t often lie. Ginny shrugged it off before returning to her dorm.
“Ok.” Ginny started to take out her Care of Magical Creatures book.
“Well, I asked if you’d go to the dance with me and-”
Fight or flight? Well my fight option isn’t working so I bolt.
“I guess you’re right. It’s a date.”
“Hello Ginny.”
“So… you and Malfoy.”
“What’s that?”
Draco was hiding in a girl’s bathroom stall. He too, felt like Hogwarts wasn’t as homey as it normally was. Before, he could come to Hogwarts as a way to escape the manor. He could see his friends, study his classes, and be free of the dark magic surrounding his family. Well, that didn’t really apply to his sixth year, but still. Hogwarts had been more of his home than the manor ever had been. Now, it was different. The manor wasn’t so cold and dark anymore, now that his father was in prison. His mother had finally filed for divorce and started cleaning up the manor. Pictures were hung, dark objects were donated, and the manor felt a little more… happy. Hogwarts on the other hand, felt like a war zone. The prejudice against Slytherin’s was even worse than before and any ex death eater was treated as though they had no rights. This is why Draco was hiding in the girl’s bathroom with Myrtle. A group of self proclaimed heroes from Gryffindor had chased him down a corridor and tried to jinx him multiple times. Draco could easily dodge or fight them, but he was on probation and didn't want to risk appearing in court again. So instead he hid. Yes, it was cowardly but hey, he was a Slytherin, wasn’t he?
“So, um, why are you here?” Ginny asked. Now that the initial embarrassment had worn of she was curious as to what the other girl was doing here.
Ginny meets an unexpected ally on the hogwarts express
Ginny felt mildly uncomfortable with Luna so close but she didn’t want it to stop.
The thestrals looked like Pegasus but bonier and more scary looking. They had almost no fur and grey skin seemed to hang from the bones. It was a great drawing.
P.S I sent you a back to school gift. The owl wasn’t strong enough to carry it so the gift will be coming later!
“Umm... sure. I won’t be able to see them though.”
It was beautiful, and Ginny hoped that it would be a very good day.
He made the spider crawl into the jar of water. The spider was pulled slightly down so it was barely under the water.
The study date at the library had been a success! Luna didn’t seem to hate her and they had plans to got to hogsmead. This brought on another onslaught of worries. Not the fact that Luna didn’t hate her, the trip the hogsmead. Ginny had never been to hogsmead before since she was a third year and this was her first year being allowed to go. She had heard her brother’s talk about it before but... Fred and George had a tendency to stretch the truth a bit and Ginny doubted that half the things they said were true.
Draco was putting a few finishing touches on his outfit. Harry had asked to see him in the room of requirement and Draco was planning on promposing. He’d gotten Harry a little ring in case he said yes. It was milky grey and had an aura about it that just seemed magical.
“Okay… that’s true. What if instead of these huge public ask-outs we just ask the crush out without an audience? That way if said crush rejects you nobody will know. And the only person you will be out to is the crush. Come on, it’s a fool-proof plan!”
“I’m sorry,” Ginny said in what she hoped to be a comforting tone.
“What’re you going to do during your time with your parents? Isn’t there not much to do in the muggle world?” Pansy had asked.
Her mum was being absurd. It was just Quidditch! She watched as her mum breathed out a heavy sigh.
“I mean, if you want to.”
“One, two, THREE!”
She was excited but nervous for the “exclusive party” happening the night after. She hoped that whatever it was, it was good. Ginny knew that probably nothing bad would happen, her main concern was whether or not she’d make a good impression. She was a lot more comfortable around Luna now, and didn’t worry as much about whether or not she was awkward or making a bad impression. But she still worried sometimes and she tended to get really anxious about things. This was one of those things.
“I feel like I’ve seen you before. Your voice seems familiar and I swear I've seen that lion head somewhere.”
“One of the curses is the killing curse. It… kills anybody who you cast the curse on,” she explained. The killing curse was probably the most well known curse of the three.
“Thank you. Here’s what the thestrals look like.” Luna held up a piece of paper she had been drawing on.
“Okay,” came a mix of voices.
Every day
Most of us were staying at Hogwarts for Holiday Break, but apparently Hermione was not. Instead, she was going to stay with her parents and go to laser tag.
Well, you can’t expect a friendship to bloom in a couple minutes. She decided to be friendly towards Harry and hopefully he would return the gesture eventually. Ginny wasn’t sure why becoming friends with Harry was so important to her. It was probably because she had few, well more like no, friends. She had been too caught up in being controlled by the diary in her first year to make friends and in her second year she had been known as “the girl who knew you know who” by almost everyone and known as “muggleborn killer” by a few particularly nasty students. Either way, it made it nearly impossible to make friends. Last year she had thrown herself into her studies, substituting grades and books for friends. She hoped this year could be different, and that maybe her nicknames would be gone- or at least fewer than the year before. She knew it was unlikely but still, she could hope.

Love,
“No, I’m not joking, or lying, or saying anything that’s not true.”
I was about to politely decline, seeing as I a) had no idea what laser tag was, b) did not know what lasers were, and c) had no intention of admitting any of this information. But of course Harry just had to immediately say yes.
But I’m too afraid
They clasped hands and hopped over the line. Nothing happened, it did seem to work! They both dropped their names into the goblet, and that was when the real trouble started. As soon as the slips hit the fire, Fred and George were blasted backwards. The results of their aging potion sped up and the twins now had long, white, beards looking quite a bit like Dumbledore’s. Their slips floated along in the air before landing on top of one of the boy’s head.
Draco
Draco pulled out his textbook and tried to focus on brewing the potion. He was so nervous for the end of class he was shaking a bit. The end of class came far too soon, however, and Draco was shaking so hard that he had a hard time pouring out a vial for the Professor.
“Oh um, what were you saying? I’m sorry I wasn’t paying attention,” Ginny stuttered. Something about this girl made her stomach flutter and her head swim. It made it hard to pay attention. Ginny looked at her face and searched for some sort of emotion. She was expecting hurt or confusion, but instead she saw calm and understanding.
I finally look up to meet his eyes. I see that he’s blushing like crazy, and also smiling.
There was cheering once more but Crum didn’t wave and smile like Fleur, instead he walked up normally and left. If Ginny didn’t know better, she would have guessed that he didn’t want to be a contestant.
“Yes,” Ginny muttered. After seeing the look on Luna's face she quickly continued talking. “I mean no, I mean, I’m not good at this sort of thing.”
“I charmed the bag to hold things,” explained Luna. She held up a honeysickle. “What’s that you said about candy?”
Harry smiled. “Thanks, that means a lot,” he said gratefully.
“Oh, erm... hi Luna.” Ginny’s cheeks flushed and her heart started pounding. She suddenly became very nervous. She was worried Luna would think she was weird, or creepy, or- bloody heck, has this been what my life has come too? Why am I obsessing over what she thinks of me?  As much as she wanted the nervousness to go away she couldn’t. Her stomach was fluttering and her head was spinning. She hoped that she didn’t look as much of a mess on the outside as she was on the inside. Please let me not make a fool of myself.
Due to the fact Harry was a bit hopeless when it came to Potions and Draco had always been pretty great at potions, they’d been matched together.
It was December, and that meant one thing: the Yule Ball. Teachers had announced it and it was the biggest thing happening at Hogwarts. It was right before Holiday Break so a lot of people were staying at Hogwarts for the holidays. Ginny wasn’t sure if she’d be staying or leaving yet but she was thinking about the Yule Ball. She wanted to go with Luna, but she wasn’t sure if Luna wanted to go or if going together was even possible. Would people notice the two of them? Would it out them? She wasn’t sure. Nonetheless Ginny was kind of excited. She’d always wanted to go to a ball.
When Draco was finished with his classes he practically ran to the Slytherin common and told Pansy everything.
“Bloody Potter, seems the rules don’t apply to him anymore, not that they ever did before.”
Maybe coming back for my eighth year was a bad idea.
Except it wasn’t a stranger, it was Fred or possibly George. Even after years of living with the twins, Ginny could hardly tell them apart.
Dear secret admirer,
I probably should’ve said something about how I had no idea what lasers or laser tag was before we arrived at the laser tag building.
Ginny got onto the Hogwarts express and waved goodbye to her mum. It was her third year and yet she still watched a few tears fall from her mum’s face. Every single year she had gone to Hogwarts her mum had cried. Every single year. Last year her mum had almost decided she couldn’t go to Hogwarts. That was fun, she thought bitterly.
“Listen, Gin, I like you. As a sister. Ron’s sister. And I don’t want to hurt your feelings or anything but I don’t want to date you, or be your boyfriend, or have a secret romance, or anything like that. Ok?”
Harry smiled, and laughed a little bit.
“Yeah.” They scurried away. Luna led the way to a painting.
1. I’ll now be posting twice a week! Monday’s and thursdays, unless someone has a suggestion.
“So… you also like me?”
Before they parted ways, Ginny said,
“Ready, Freddie?”
Chapter five
“N-no it’s not you. I’ve g-got to go. I’m sorry, I really am.” Ginny ran out of the owlery, leaving a very confused Luna behind
“Maybe I should. Do you want to go to hogsmead with me sometime?” Luna asked.
Harry didn’t really explain how to play. He just kind of said, “It’s hard to explain, you’ll figure it out once you play.”
“Yep!” Ginny said, as she walked away. She hurried to her dorm and grabbed her permission slip. She also grabbed a brown bag she had gotten for her books and raced down to the great hall. She made it just in time to see Professor McGonagall taking permission slips. She gave hers to the Professor and got to Hogsmead.
“Mamma Mia, does it show again?” the bird asked, and Draco snickered. What an odd choice in song, he thought.
Lavender laughed. Harry followed her through the crowd, unaware they were on their way back to the Villa Ariadne until Harry found himself just a little out of breath on the stairs that led up the mountainside directly to the hotel.
“Must be next door,” Harry said to himself, and Draco could hear him setting down a bag, followed by a zipper. Hiding in that tiny, cramped closet, Draco wished a lot of things. He wished he had never agreed to stock towels. He wished he had never agreed to let Lavender take over booking as part of the wedding. He wished he had brought his wand or even his phone with him. He also wished he had never taken Benny into the closet with him.
He hesitated at the door to his room, hearing the familiar soft music drifting from inside. He didn’t share Care of Magical Creatures with his roommate – the only class they didn’t share, really – but he hadn’t expected him to be in their room just now. The perks of being a returning eighth year, as McGonagall was fond of calling them, meant they got their own spacious dormitory and only had to share a (surprisingly large) sleeping space with one other person. The unfortunate side of being McGonagall’s leading example of house unity meant that his roommate this year was none other than Draco Malfoy.
“Daphne Greengrass,” she introduced herself. “You’re the dragon man, right?” Charlie laughed.
screwed.
“Minor league teams. I don’t contract with the major leagues. You know that.” Draco shrugged at his broom-making friend.
“This is taking longer than I thought,” Andromeda mused out loud. Greg eased himself down onto the couch beside his wife, who took no time at all to snuggle into his side. He draped his arm across her shoulders and pressed a light kiss to the top of her head as he listened to them talk.
~ ~ ~
“Who’s with you then?”
Harry slid into a large, rounded booth tucked away in the corner of the pub, quickly followed by the blonde he couldn’t stop thinking about and could barely stop looking at. He only hoped he wasn’t completely obvious, but the knowing looks Hermione kept shooting his way told him that was probably not the case.
“And that wasn’t the only thing you did, was it?” Lily grinned mischievously at him. Harry narrowed his eyes.
“No, she’ll be staying here,” Nico said.
“No,” Andromeda answered. She studied him a moment longer before her gaze slid consideringly to the woman by his side. When her graze dropped to his wife’s stomach, however brief, he knew she knew. Her gaze met his and she raised a brow. He knew this was her way of asking, but they weren’t telling anyone. Not yet.
“There’s my favorite superstars! Looks like you brought the whole entourage.”
“So!? So if Lily
“Am I really that obvious?” Lily whined and Luna tried very hard to maintain her serious demeanor.
Draco slept on his couch for the rest of the summer. Greg should have known better; he knew when he was eight, he was stuck with the dramatic ponce for the rest of his life.
Other than a few complements from some of the girls, no one said a word to Malfoy about his makeup or his heels. Instead, the group acted as though nothing about this was different than usual and made their way down to Hogsmeade. With the large number of young adults that had started to move into the town after the war, the businesses seemed to be responding. The new pub was light and cozy, the ‘top hits’ music louder than The Three Broomsticks or The Hogs Head, and the clientele were almost all under thirty.
“Yes, but if we freeze him now then we can get him ready and keep him safe from Ladon until then.” Nico stepped forward, placing a gentle hand on Lily’s shoulder and withdrawing his wand with his other.
“Oh.” Lily looked down, crossing her arms and trying to hold back tears. Geronimo had been here almost as long as she had been coming. She couldn’t imagine not being able to see him whenever she wanted to anymore. A warm, calloused hand suddenly rested on her shoulder and she looked up, blinking back the tears threatening to fall.
“How can I resist you?” Benny suddenly crooned from the doorway, pulling both Draco and apparently Harry from their examination of the other. Draco felt a flush creeping up his neck, but he ignored it in favor of clearing his throat and looking at Harry pointedly from where he stood with his arms crossed over his chest.
The music faded behind them as Lily chased Charlie through the courtyard.
“Well, I was talking with Lily about what I can do to get Vic back. She has this idea, and, well…I need you to teach me how to dance.” This time, Pansy’s laugh came naturally. It was long and loud and the redder Teddy turned the harder she continued to laugh. Teddy finally whined, “I’m serious!”
