“Of course,” Narcissa nods. Then, staring at the planchette, she asks, her voice softened. “Who is the person he loves, then?”
“If the Dark Lord knew how soup and a blanket could shock you this easily, you wouldn’t have made it past five years old,” Draco says when Potter jumps at the sight of him.
“Drink, darling.”
He can pinpoint the moment when Potter hears the beeping. He doesn’t turn it off, doesn’t even check it. Just looks at Draco.
“You’re right.”
With a slight bow, Draco goes to focus on his own tables. He’s not called back again, but for the next few months, that table has unofficially become Potter’s domain.
A ringed finger runs down the lists of appetizers and main courses, its owner humming to herself. Leaving her to it, Draco turns to leave.
“Which part? The breaking into a Ministry department to illegally copy confidential files, or working with Skeeter?” Draco drawls. They were already this far in and Draco doubted Sirius would give up any time soon. This could all very well save Potter’s life and that should be enough for Sirius.
“What’s that?” Potter asks when the twins walk away and Draco unfolds the note, curious. He pauses to read over everything, eyes rolling left and right. For the most part it lists off product ideas - some old, some new – and it appears to be asking for Draco’s very Slytherin- and Muggle-influenced thoughts.
“Another stand alone,” Draco sighs. “Stand alone’s,” were events that were entirely unique and didn’t happen to the other. Thus far all of the events had been stand alone’s…
Potter immediately splutters, eyes flicking down to the magazine’s image of a stuck-out tongue with a metal rod sticking out of it, then back up at Draco. He’s wide-eyed and turning pink very quickly.
“How the hell am I supposed to do that when I don’t even know what they’re
The unexpected part of the last week, however, arose in who ended up showing Potter any level of decency. It was no surprise most of his own house was, at least, backing him up. Not all of the lions, but most.
“Nirvana and Green Day,” Draco offers, eyes sparkling, and he ignores Potter’s cackling behind him.
Somewhere in the background Eric’s voice calls, faint but recognizable, “Check your privilege!” followed by Max yelling, “Stop saying that! It’s not gonna catch on!”
Sometimes Max’s family liked to send Draco gifts at random points through the year. There were always big care packages packed with presents from the whole family on Christmas and Draco’s birthday, but sometimes a small present would pop up unannounced, too.
“Sneaking up on people again, I see,” Draco sneers, his terror and shock morphing into anger as he tries to cover up his blunder.
Harry hadn’t bawled again like he had when first sneaking into the hospital wing, but he had some moments where he went still and had to breathe heavy, or when he was alone with Draco letting a few streaks of tears fall. He’d shake all over, like he was cold, but no matter how much Draco held him it only faded with time.
“Oh my god,” Harry whines, slouching forward to hold his face in his hands, but then is springing back up to point accusingly at Draco. “You knew they were there the whole time!”
“Wandless tutoring lessons will be starting up again next year,” she says calmly, “With Umbridge gone, Headmaster Dumbledore has granted me permission to continue them.” Almost immediately, Draco is perking up, his whole body straightening in interest and excitement.
“Well…” Max’s mother sighs, “If there is enough concern, you can always call the police. Do you think they hurt Harry? Get physical? Not that that is the only think one should worry about.”
“I thought you didn’t understand this concept,” Blaise drawls and Eve throws a glare his way.
Draco tries to think of something Max may have mentioned that might peak the other boy’s interest, and ignores the little voice in his head that sounds like Lucius to stop talking to this mudblood.
The DA had slowly been building up their Patronus Charm lessons. Harry had been advising them on what to keep in mind, how to move their wand, how to prepare, and it is on the night they are scheduled to finally

“Ron didn’t need to tell us,” the other says, holding Harry’s shoulder, “But it was a pretty brilliant move. Don’t you think, Fred?”
Potter’s eyes have widened, looking hopeful. “And it told you who put my name in it?”
He tries to focus back on the class, looking back around for more raised hands. The only other seems to be Theodore Nott which, after his initial reaction to the creatures’ appearance, makes plenty of sense to Draco.
“I really am proud of them!” Harry is quick to assure, as if his joy for his friends was ever in doubt, and Draco rolls his eyes in good humor.
“Swamp gas,” Draco explains, shrugging again, but moving towards the bathroom to shed off his robes and outer layers.
Instead Draco sat in silence up in the Astronomy Tower, shaking hands hugging his radio close, and cried.
A hand on his shoulder has Draco looking over at Harry, the boy smiling tightly, “It’s nothing you need to worry about,” he says, and Draco highly doubts that, “There’s nothing wrong with being a parselmouth. It’s just… really, really rare and unexpected.”
Draco doesn’t hesitate, doesn’t allow himself to, as he replies, “Yes.”
“Head in the game, Malfoy!” Flint snaps near his ear, making him jerk in surprise. His captain is glaring at him before he’s flying back into the struggle for the Quaffle.
He thinks – hopes – Fred and George understand because they nod at him, serious, before bolting and Draco turns back towards Umbridge’s office door.
Draco scowls, glancing back at Hagrid’s hut but making no moves to continue on.
Weasley has his face pillowed in his arms, a single Charms textbook beneath him, and his eyes fluttering in an attempt to stay awake but failing miserably. Ginny, beside him, regularly slaps his arm when his eyes stay shut too long.
“I will consider it,” Potter’s voice is firmer this time and Draco drops it.
“I never meant to be…
Edgecombe hadn’t told on them, but Draco had a very, very strong feeling she planned to tonight. She wasn’t a good actor, after all.
Okay, he really did not know how to handle Harry’s parents outside of class…
“At this point, do you really think monitoring is going to be our biggest problem?” Theodore questions when Draco spins to glare at him.
“Tracey. My little octopus,” Mr. Davis says, apparently happy, and Skeeter leans away from the desk, eying the man with a worried expression.
Harry snorts at that. “I’ll consider it,” he says, but Draco doubts he really will, and then they are moving swiftly through the now vacant corridor, heading for the library.
disappointing he’d likely always be in the dark, and it
“I wanted to know how
“And that’s what you’re doing,” Draco whispers in realization. Duke had always been carefully quiet about his opinions on the Minitry’s stance and every file Draco got to look over was of crimes completely unrelated to Voldemort or his followers.
“Did she say yes?” Draco asks a little too quickly, but no one seems to notice.
“It’s a Cerberus,” Draco wheezes. He hated running so much.
“Doing alright there, Draco?” Fred asks and George’s hand lays on his shoulder, holding him steady.
your life to the point beggars will look to you in pity.”
“As for these thoughts that pop up when we face new experiences and very quickly turn them into fears, they’re pretty similar. Accept them for what they are - your instinctive urge to survive getting twisted by an overactive brain - realize these thoughts are only worries and not reality, and then let them pass. Sometimes thinking about overly positive thoughts helps me, even when they’re fantastical. Kind of like a… ‘but what if THIS happens instead?’”
She reminds them Merlin was a Slytherin, making a few of them puff out their chests, and she sasses the other houses for a second in a not-entirely-mean-spirited-but-not-the-sweetest-either kind of way.
“W… Why did you spray canned--?”
Ever since the incident outside of Potions, Theodore and Millicent had only gotten worse. Where they had mostly left them alone before, now they made sure to throw a rude comment at Draco and Harry any time they were near their Gryffindor friends. They would sneer and laugh and in general just be cruel. Sometimes Pansy would join in, like she saw it as all good fun, and many of the other Slytherins made no move to stop them. Sophie and Daphne might stand up for them on occasion, while Tracey and Blaise just stayed out of it altogether. Gemma would occasionally try to lecture them all, but that usually only made things worse and William would step in to pull her away.
“I am good at it.”
It feels surreal. It feels childish and simple, yet somehow profound to just sit with his Gryffindors and munch on Muggle candy like it’s nothing. It makes him want to do other things that feel simple. Take photos, practice violin, read with his book club, anything.
~ ~ ~
The crackle of the radio startles Draco and he looks down at it.
“I am no fool, despite what these
“Conquering your fears will, hopefully, assist in your Patronus lessons,” Draco explains, “And Eric always understood you when you spoke of fears you knew, logically, were unnecessary. I suspect he will be able to shed some light on your predicament.”
“So… you are an Animagus?”
“I’d really appreciate it,” Draco begins to call, voice high, and he curls up again to avoid another strike, “if someone would DO SOMETHING!”
“Yeah, ‘used to!’ Who’s the hypocrite now?”
“I’ll see what I can do,” Draco decides, pulling out a piece of parchment.
Draco has woken up in the hospital wing more times than he’d like, but this time feels different. He has never felt so drained to his very core before. He has never felt so exhausted despite all the medical help. Shouldn’t he feel refreshed by this point?
The Time Chamber, housing the second most mysterious limit of magic; time.
“I think it’s because the rest of his herd isn’t very happy he’s ‘fraternizing’ with us,” Weasley makes air quotes with his fingers, not looking overly concerned. Draco thinks he remembers other centaurs, that night in first year, and he’s… pretty sure they hadn’t been happy with Firenze then, either. Draco suspected this centaur was a rebel of sorts, but not yet fully invested. It would make sense why he kept eying the woods, likely looking out for any of his fellow centaurs.
“’Older men declare war, but it is the youth that must fight and die.’ Herbert Hoover. ‘What a cruel thing war is, to fill our hearts with hatred instead of love for our neighbors.’ Robert E Lee. ‘You cannot simultaneously prevent and prepare for war.’ Albert Einstein. ‘We must concentrate not merely on the negative expulsion of war but the positive affirmation of peace.’ Martin Luther King Jr.”
“Yes, well done,” Ollivander is saying, but he still sounds distant, “This wand was meant for you.” Draco grudgingly sets the wand back in its box and follows the wandmaker to the front desk so he can purchase it. “Curious…”
Draco can offer unique insight into the spells that he has garnered from years of studying it and growing up in a pureblood household.
For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat
“Whoa,” Draco whispers then hears Ron hiss on the far side of Harry.
If only Hermione was there. Their brains combined could have figured this out. Or maybe she had already known with her obsessive studies on the history of Hogwarts and all things wizard-y. But both of them had been so wrapped up in getting ready for their own trips the last few days they’d forgotten that going together was an option.
Draco quickly turns away, wide-eyed and very nauseous, and Harry carefully pats his back as if to help with how green Draco surely looks.
, his feet thrown up to rest on the bench across from him. Eve mirrors him, sitting on the opposite bench, her own feet thrown up beside Draco’s hip, and a book in her hands that doesn’t look to be written in English. It is kanji of some sort, and Draco is just attempting to piece together where it must originate when the door to their compartment opens.
“Anybody want to try a career as an Unspeakable and fill the rest of us in?” Theodore grumbles, jabbing at Longbottom’s elbow to get him to stop messing with his nose. The two, lanky boys have a momentary stare off - the Gryffindor pouting and the Slytherin arching an expectant brow - before Longbottom relents.
All three of them stand frozen in surprise, uncertain where this meeting might be going, but eventually Vivian moves to dig around in her bottomless bag and it urges Draco to pull his backpack off his shoulders and extract his and Harry’s extra Astronomy work. They hand everything in and Sinistra sets the papers to the side without looking at them, her blank gaze still on them.
“I doubt they’d care if they did know,” he admits. Despite not all Slytherins not being dark wizards, there was still the issue that a good number of them were regularly exposed to dark magic or dark bias by family members. Whether they agreed or not, most Slytherins were desensitized to dark magic at least by their second or third years.
Draco opens the compartment door just long enough to yell in, “If you’re going to snog, pull the damn curtains!” Leandra shrieks while Eve leaps to throw hexes at him, but he shuts the door and runs before she gets the chance.
“Is someone awake out there? You should be getting rest!” calls the unmistakable voice of Percy Weasley, the prefect, and Draco is springing off of the couch in a second.
“I get you’re all excited and interested,” Harry snickers, sitting on a couch nearby, “but merpeople are very private and don’t much care for our kind.”
He hardly even looked in Potter’s direction. Draco suspected he had more communication with the Malfoy heir than he did the Boy-Who-Lived.
“We have an essay?” both boys say in unison and Draco blanches. Apparently, a lot less seriously…
He wants to fall apart now. He wants to cry and scream and throw a damn tantrum because he’s earned it.
Draco flinches at the name. Right, McGonagall.
She was a Muggleborn in Slytherin. That couldn’t be safe. As much as Draco would prefer to defend his house, even he knew that. She would be too much of an easy target if she were open about her heritage. She was at risk in her own house, and didn’t that twist his gut this way and that?
“You are allowed to be angry,” Draco assures him, not removing his hands from Harry’s wrist or his cheek. “You are allowed to be furious. Just… don’t obsess over this. Please… You have too much to worry about already.”
“Remember, the memory doesn’t have to be some epic, heroic moment,” Draco calls, after a while, “Sometimes our most powerful moments seem small at first, but mean a lot to us.” There’s a few nods, but no one really responds verbally, just getting back to work.
Sirius looks at his godson, mouth opening and closing a few times, but no answer comes out. Draco has also stopped eating to look at Potter, brows raised in surprise at the suggestion.
“We dropped our Quaffle,” Harry suddenly cuts in, but his voice is remarkably steady. “We, uh… we were practicing and Draco missed a trick throw and it fell. When we went down to get it, though, we thought we heard Mr. Filch and we panicked.”
It left Draco feeling forlorn, in a way, and he didn’t know what to do about it.
It was Sunday, when they weren’t even supposed to get mail, that Mrs Nubble finally had quite enough when the lone envelope appeared at the front door. She snatched it up and began writing a reply letter.
It’s Leandra, surprisingly, who finally convinces Potter.
Next stop: Platform 9 ¾!
and it wouldn’t be acceptable if he didn’t do something…
“Why are you two even out here?” Draco demands, glaring suspiciously at the two girls.
Draco’s supporting arm bends and he topples backwards, but he hardly notices. Instead, his wide eyes are focused on Harry’s determined face, shock coursing through his system.
” Granger says sharply, flicking out her wand, and suddenly Chopin’s Nocturne Op. 9 No. 2 is playing in Draco’s head on loop and he squawks, indignant.
The dragon Militum roars upon forming, wings bursting wide before spiralling downward. It sweeps over the crowd, hurling Death Eaters against the wall before taking back to the air. The rest of the Department of Mysteries had been far too small for Harry’s Militus, but the Death Chamber’s huge ceiling and walls benefitted them just fine.

“I have an idea…”
Vivian waves him off and they begin walking back to the castle. “It’s also a big, Slytherin secret. Only certain Slytherins, Professor Sinistra, and I guess Professor Dumbledore knows about it, so don’t go spillin’,” she jabs a finger in Draco’s face and he scowls at her, smacking it away. “The tower’s charmed, too, that’s a big secret. The top, where classes are held, is charmed with silencing spells since… well, you don’t want a class waking up everyone else that might still be asleep. Stairs up aren’t though.”
at Draco for thirty minutes and then left; and sometimes varying combinations of the Golden Trio will pop up.
” Max says too quickly. Yep. They tripped.
“Thank you,” the elder man nods.
“No… I don’t know,” there’s a pause and Draco can almost feel the atmosphere getting tenser as the seconds tick by. Great. What issue with Draco was Max going to have now? “Waaaaait… Is this you labelling someone for some asinine reasons just so you can feel better about yourself?”
The Slytherin team’s laughter builds up for only two seconds before Potter and Fred are lunging for Montague. There’s a chorus of outcries as each team begins cheering or demanding the other backs off. George hurries to try and pull his brother and Potter back, but to little avail.
The group falls deathly silent, all eyes staring at Draco as the moments tick by, until Eve throws her arms into the air and screams, “FUCKING
“Ron! That’s amazing!” Harry exclaims as soon as Weasley’s eyes are open, the Boy-Who-Lived approaching his best friend to look at the changed eyes.
For two weeks now, whenever Draco and the Golden Trio, or any combination of the four students, went to the Room of Requirement to work on plans and talk, they would set aside some time to practice their Militus Charms. It hadn’t been much time since they’d decided to go through with the spell, but Draco had noticed they’d hardly made any progress with it. At most, Harry had managed a few wisps of shadowy smoke from his wand, but that had been it.
He feels comfortable in the atmosphere of Herbology but can tell he will need to focus on studying all the flora they go over. Charms excites him and he always stays after class to talk to Flitwick, asking questions that wouldn’t have fit into that class’s lesson. Still, he recognizes he will need to practice his spells regularly if he wants to keep up. History of Magic is… frustrating, in that the subject matter intrigues Draco, but Professor Binns, the ghostly teacher, is so monotone and long-winded it leaves Draco nodding off constantly. Defense Against the Dark Arts is also frustrating, but more because Professor Quirrell is just so incompetent, filling the room with garlic and barely managing to teach them straight out of the textbook.
Draco’s breakfast ends shortly after the owl post arrives. Multiple kids get letters from their families, giving well wishes for the coming school year, and Draco gets to finally meet Hedwig, Harry’s beautiful, snowy owl. She carries a letter from Harry’s father, which he quickly stuffs in his robes, a dreadful look in his eyes, and Draco decides he shouldn’t push it.
"Luna was good at what she did, we’ve been onto her but couldn’t obtain the evidence necessary to build a case. When we did, we had to reverse-engineer the spellwork of her entire, er, system to figure out where each victim was and open a two-way portal. It was hell, she wouldn’t say anything and before we decided to, y’know, make her take Veritaserum and get her memories to put in a Pensive, she put herself in a magically-induced coma. Been sleeping for, like, four years now.”
Draco raises a hand from the armrest, calloused and huge. His index finger taps a stubbled cheek. Harry knows that finger, is familiar with its uncanny smoothness. Draco’s told him of the vicious accident that burned off three of his fingerprints during his time as an apprentice, a lesson to learn and a story to recount. Harry’s liked to rub them just because, and Draco’s let him with an indulgent smile.
“Mr, Mr. Potter,” the judge stammers, “you are not Mr. Malfoy’s relative nor loved one.”
Draco sucks in the stale air with a hiss. He’s pulled his date this far into the alley because he didn’t want curious onlookers as they snog. Bad fucking idea that was. Still, the thought of strangers witnessing this horrid moment fills him with dread. They can’t do anything to help anyway, only to humiliate him even more.
His sexuality was leaked to some irrelevant gossip rag, not even making the front page. Nobody noticed, nothing changed, and it hasn’t entered his mind in what feels like forever until Potter reminds him.
Harry repeats the question and the planchette draws a decisive line toward the word ‘Yes.’ Something clinks. The two occupants of the room look in its direction at the same time.
“Get off the ground,” Draco manages.
The pair fall silent and keep walking. For some inane reason, Draco’s chest squeezes all the more with each step. Chewing on his bottom lip, he glances back at Potter once again. The man looks miserable, biting back expletives at every sting the spinaberry leaves slice into his skin, which Draco has anticipated and worn a cape for.
“No, it’s not,” Pansy says. She’s a Healer, so she’s probably right. But Draco prefers to ignore that.
Draco bites the inside of his cheek and looks away. The only consequence from that horrid night was his fucked up heart and nothing else, nothing at all. Whatever Potter is insinuating, he hates it. He hates this. He hates
He points his wand to Potter’s chest and casts
“Now,” Draco’s pulse jackrabbits so quickly he can hear it. A delighted chuckle leaks into the night. “Your answer, please.”
“Shite.”
“Yeah, sure. Please make it quick, though,” he says.
When Potter finally stops trying to stare the soul out of Draco and eats his food, Draco is already halfway done and Little Billy is descending down his arm, sniffing the bowl. The glider’s curiosity soon fades and he climbs up, trying to burrow himself into Draco’s collar.
“No, no, it’s fine,” Potter looks at his soup, then at Draco. “Is that why you’re covering up?”
Draco’s throat hurts, but there is still a great many things he wants to ask. A normal werewolf would be jittery with nerves now, itching to run free and demolish whatever is in its path. Potter never took the seven doses of Wolfsbane the week before he transformed - thus where did that aggression go? If what Draco saw earlier was correct, then how did he brave through a forest meant to confuse everyone and everything with just a torn piece of his cloak? How is Draco not dead yet? How is he sitting here with Potter’s head in his lap, vying for his attention instead of ripping his throat out?
“Yes.”
“Thanks for helping me out that time,” Potter finally says. Draco doesn’t know what he wants him to say. That night was fucking hell on earth, he could barely remember it with how hard he blocks it out of his head. So what if he didn’t turn Potter in? What does it matter?
Letting the finger fall from his mouth, Draco whispers back.
“Darling, hello,” Draco whispers against his forehead, kissing away the crease between thick brows. “I have something for you.”
“And how will you know if what I say is a lie? Will you reject my genuine answer if it’s not what you want to hear?”
Heat rushes through his body. Draco blinks, dizzy with… with
“Welcome, Dr. Malfoy. The SCP Foundation is glad to have you with us.”
Don’t speed up the solution’s cooling process in order to ensure effectiveness. Once it’s room temperature, add a teaspoon of it to the cup of tea. No more, no less.
“I promise. We adapt, we survive, we get our paycheck, and we eat good food. By 6 in the morning, we’ll meet by the front gate.”
Then he shrugs. “But…”
He looks over his shoulder. Lovegood has her hands clasped below her chin, eyes glued to the menu.
Potter might be the only one able to make sense of anything at all.
There is always a ‘but.’
“Hmm,” Harry murmurs into his pillow, “Draco?”
“Isn’t it obvious?” Dr. Stewart asks, lacing her fingers on her lap. “Think. His lifelong exposure with the Dark Arts and artifacts, how volatile and explosive his power is, and most importantly, how dangerous he is even to the brightest magic users. There’s a reason why we don’t meddle with your kind. You already have the means available to contain certain anomalies, but Potter is different, and we have to step in this time.”
High-pitched chirps fill the tiny kitchen, and he doesn’t need eyes to know that at least three more gliders have flown in.
Harry looks up. The way she phrases the question doesn’t make sense; it's like she’s asking someone else. That is, if there’s any other person in the dusty, hazy room except Harry. The planchette quivers then, jackrabbiting across the board.
“Are we not near closing time already?” Lovegood lifts her head. Draco lowers his. “This won’t take up much of your time, I promise.”
“Tch, stupid mutt,” Draco says, but slides the door wider and rubs the wolf’s head as he trots in, his fur warm against Draco’s legs.
“He asks if you know he loves you,” Harry says. His head is bent down and focused, missing the slight twitch in Narcissa’s fingers. “Do you know he loves you?”
come from?—rush to the ladder, hoisting Gabrielle up to the dock then Fleur, both girls being immediately enveloped with fluffy blankets and general fussing French noises. Malfoy climbs up the ladder himself, shivery and slow. He pauses at the top step like he’s two seconds away from taking a seat right there for the rest of the day, but instead takes a deep, heaving breath and marches on.
“Draco, Draco, use your words. What is this thing? Why are you shaking? Draco?”
Its body is so tiny compared to Potter’s hands. Draco is struck with how much space Potter takes up, how much his presence engulfs.
Then, his husband reseats himself, this time with a smell. A mouth-watering, delicious smell, tickling the back of Harry’s nose. He opens his eyes to see Draco lifting off the lid of a ceramic bowl perched on a tray, steam floating out and fogging Harry’s glasses. It’s purple yam soup, topped with chopped up shrimp and ground beef.
Little Billy comes back when Draco’s a few bites in. Letting the earthy, spicy taste of mushroom soup warm up his stomach, he watches Little Billy munch on his own food.
“Jesus-fuck, we’re not having this conversation again,” it’s the fifth time they’re having this conversation again, all initiated by Potter. “Look, you were a spy and what-not before openly defecting. Aren’t you good at, I don’t know, sneaking around? You go through here every other week.”
He hears a sob. One hand on his forearm turns to two, and Harry pulls him close. He rests his head against Draco’s stomach. Usually, Draco would sift his fingers through that unruly mane of his, chiding Harry for buying conditioners unsuitable for his hair type. Now, he has no right to do such a thing. His hands stay by his sides, unworthy.
Viktor and Cedric—now where did
He stays quiet, a brow remained raised.
“You were so far away in Hagrid’s arms, I couldn’t see your face,” the night had been blinding, but his eyes had found Draco’s anyway. “It felt like my heart died with you.”
The man points to a different corner of the room.
Pushing off his hind legs, Potter vaults himself over the table. A weak cry ghosts past Grammedion’s lips, as if he’s tired, so very tired, and he is slammed onto the ground. All Draco can hear as he runs to them is the sound of boots thumping the floor, limbs thrashing and fists punching, screams wrenched from wheezing lungs pulsating in Draco’s ears. Drool drips from a gaping, hungry maw. Razor-sharp teeth sink into leather, into cloth, meeting flesh. Red splatters on the floor, on the black fur, on the table legs, on Draco’s cloak, crimson seeping into wool.
He realizes it now. Ever since the day Edmund’s gaze lingered a second too long, it was over. There is no one left to remember him, and if he ‘makes it easy’ for himself and says no, nothing will change. Sooner or later, he’d die without a purpose, alone.
“Thank you, Tracey,” he eventually says, muffled by the couch, and he feels a small hand pat his palm.
Looking behind him, slowly, Draco finds none other than Mrs. Norris, puffed up and back arched and red eyes hungry for death as she stares Draco down.
“Shut up, Malfoy,” Potter groans, his personality seeming to have clicked back into its rightful place after getting Draco’s agreement to assist him.
“What? Why would they do that?” Potter demands, sitting up straight, but the way he cringes and sinks back down shows he knows precisely why they would be doing something like that.
“We aren’t going to lock them out, Draco,” Hermione says primly, head held high, and Draco turns his glare to her. He didn’t want to start meeting people, yet. He had been hoping just to sit with Hermione and go over spells, but instead she had to go and be…
“Muggleborn, actually,” the redhead - Vivian - says, her grin turning smug and devilish. “I’m one of three muggleborns in the whole of Slytherin, but I’ll kick your ass if you come at me, you hear?”
my history, Draco! Grammy… isn’t. Not because I chose it, but it happened. Sure, I’m sad and a bit disappointed, but my ancestry isn’t my history, and it doesn’t determine how great of a person I can be by my own merit.”
And he never wanted Harry to doubt that. He never wanted Harry to think he was less-than or had to fight for his right at affection. He never wanted Harry to feel second best or not good enough, because that wasn’t it at all! That could never be true.
He never awoke screaming, feeling instead frozen in his bed, breathing heavy and staring up at nothing. Sometimes, back home, Ada would still be awake and would climb into bed with him and just talk to him. Hermione, at one point, researched something called Sleep Paralysis, but Draco hated putting a name on this. It made it feel like he had some
“Serves you right,” Harry hisses, not at all in a good mood, and Draco hurries to relay the new password Theodore had forgotten.
“Would you just…
“Maybe he had things to do?” Draco shrugs, smirking despite himself when Ada chucks the chocolate frog’s box at his head.
“Understatement,” Draco mumbles, trying desperately to dig his mind out of the downward spiral it was quickly taking. His eyes flick to the redhead, who is turning red-faced as Hermione tears him a new one. “He… he sees things in black and white a lot, I reckon?” Mrs. Nubble said, often, that the law may see a lot of things in black and white, but people just weren’t like that in reality. It had always been one of her less liked facts about being a lawyer.
Tracey nods slowly. “That’s okay. You’ll change, and so will I, and so will the world.” She pauses, glancing around at the common room as people attempt to get back to normal conversation. Millicent is gone from her seat by now and Draco doesn’t know where she’s gone.
Logic and reason had always been his allies. Why weren’t they working now?
Ah, well… Distraction or not, the wandless tutoring really had come in handy, hadn’t it?
Now Draco just has to figure out what a Walkman is…
“I’ll go with you,” Eve says, sitting down beside Draco on the couch. She had grown, slowly but surely, a bit more comfortable around her peers within Slytherin. They still threw nasty comments at her every once and a while, but as she had gotten more proficient at hexes, so too did they become less eager to tease her.
“Eh, you love it,” Harry says once they’ve settled, their foreheads pressed together and Draco’s hand finds its way up to cup Harry’s cheek. He runs his fingers over the tan skin, feeling over the smooth jaw and cheekbone. His other arm is trapped beneath the Gryffindor’s body, but right in the curve of his waist so it won’t go numb as quickly.
Slowly, the rest of the Slytherin and Gryffindor first years began to file in. Greg and Vincent took a table together somewhere in the back, but when Hermione looked back at them disapprovingly they moved a few tables up.
“Oh, fuck yeah! You kidding?” Eric’s voice is loud with laughter, shattering the calm atmosphere he’d created. “I had to take a public speaking course last semester, right? I
It was a trick. It was all a trick. It was exactly what Hermione had been worried about.
“I am familiar with the Militus Charm,” Sinistra nods and Draco feels some of his tense nerves wash out of his body in relief. Professor Sinistra, the quiet, withdrawn Astronomy teacher, was full of surprises.
“Sometimes traditions are all some people have left,” he finally offers.
He raises his hand and Professor Sinistra’s head flicks to him, staring, and he flinches at how off-putting it is. “Mr. Malfoy.”
The celebrations last for most of the day for Draco and Harry. It seemed being on friendly terms with so many Gryffindors meant fewer soar losers and more people willing to offer congratulations. Titus Ward, Gryffindor’s last-minute Seeker, even comes over to shake Harry’s hand.
“Good morning,” Draco says lowly, not wanting to upset whatever balance they’ve managed to find last night, but not wanting to run away either. He’d slept in the same bed as Harry Potter after the boy had had a nightmare. As embarrassing as that statement could be, he wasn’t going to back down from it. The last time he’d run away from something… he’d ended up not talking with Potter for weeks.
Snape says nothing for a moment, but he looks stiffer all of a sudden, which is impressive since he always looks as stiff as a board. A very greasy board. “Sometimes…” Snape begins slowly as he flicks his wand and lifts a few pieces of chopped crow’s feet and a bowl of crushed daffodil petals into the air. They go into his cauldron and he stirs the concoction a few times before he continues.
“I mean… I was a baby at the time, so…” Draco continues with his dry, sarcastic tone and expression, not allowing himself to show how flustered he’s slowly getting from the attention.
“Then listen to your brother and get some rest. We can talk tomorrow about making a proper schedule for you and your projects. My tutors taught me some of the best methods.”
Draco Lucius Malfoy is six-years-old when he goes wandering in Muggle London all on his own, in search of something he can find familiar. Certainly, there are landmarks, famous landmarks, that he’s heard of or read about, but they offer little comfort. Most are Muggle, or have been appropriated by the Muggles, his father claims. They are no longer of the Wizarding World.

Theodore shrieks in panic, looking around with wide eyes, and Harry looks frantic as he hisses at Peeves, begging him to stop, but the poltergeist just keeps yelling, attracting someone in authority for sure. Draco, who forces every last bit of his panic deep into the depths of his mind, looks around for a way out. It’s a hallway, right? Maybe they can hide in one of the rooms?
The Slytherin boys mostly leave them be, thankfully, and after the first few weeks, when no one snitches on them, Draco finally begins to relax around them again. Sometimes even some of the Slytherin girls from the DA will pop in to say hello.
Another pause, and then she’s smiling, thin and slimy.
“They’re allies, Harry,” Draco says sharply, once the figures have finished speaking, and Harry looks over at him quickly. Perhaps Draco had underestimated the state Harry was in, but he looked near feral with the perceived threat on their hands. “They lock the doors for us so we’re safe from the Death Eaters. They let us in and just wanted to talk.”
“It’s better than nothing,” Harry sighs and Draco finally slides the bangle onto his broom handle, right above where he puts his hands. “Practice and games shouldn’t be as worrying now.”
“That’s why it can’t pick up when we’re on the Knight Bus? Because it’s always charged with constant, passive magic?” Potter questions.
“Alright, fine, yes I need some help with something.” Draco’s triumphant smirk only manages to make Potter scowl, “To be fair, I bought this before I even knew I needed help…” He then reaches out and taps the figurine’s head, the little abraxan quivering before it begins to trot around atop Draco’s book like a miniature of the actual thing.
Muddy said a monster had been
Potter, at some point in the struggle, had been released and knocked backwards, sitting with wide eyes and a pale face matted with dirt and blood. Draco, once off of fake-Moody, springs to crouch in front of the boy, hackles risen, and massive teeth bared as he growls a warning at the traitor.
The expected jiggle doesn’t come, and instead the handle twists with no issue and Blaise pushes the door open slowly. From their vantage point, the room looks to be a perfect split of pitch black on the left and pure white on the right.
July of 1995 Draco vehemently calls the month from Hell.
“Do I need to say anything?” Weasley questions as he clambers into the fireplace.
“I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. You…” Potter stops, swallows, then says, “Happy Christmas, Draco,” then turns around and flees through the castle as fast as he can.
“I do not doubt you could, but it would be best not to test these things out on a bunch of impressionable children, don’t you think?”
“Yes, your majesty,” Draco bows awkwardly over the table and Hermione groans, but they say nothing more as they continue to research and Hermione doesn’t send anymore dirty looks to the table in the back corner.
He can’t believe how relieved he is to see this boy alive and walking. It almost doesn’t feel real, but here Harry is, and Draco would cry if he were human.
“I do not—” Theodore begins to protest, looking over his shoulder, but then bites his tongue and growls, looking back at Lucky and attempting to beckon the thestral closer.
“I reiterate!” Draco had exclaimed, stomping over to grab his bag and drag it over to his feet where he can defend it properly. Little help that would do now, since the two boys have already gotten what they wanted. “Thieves! I will not associate with thieves!”
The Hufflepuff looks up at Draco, cheeks puffing out as she pouts, expression unhappy. “No, I am not. This is important to me and I will not squander my family name for the sake of curiosity,” she says, huffier than usual. Probably because Granger wouldn’t stop asking to read it and Draco was an asshole who liked to push people’s buttons.
“We all knew he was the farthest thing from a gentleman,” Draco sighs, “I was not expecting such shortcomings to rear their ugly heads in such a manner.”
“Evangeline!” Eve’s mother snaps, before saying in a rush, “Sono kotoba o iwanaide kudasai!”
“What subjects are you looking forward to most?” the boy asks, head tilting, and Draco pauses.
Max snorts, sudden and heartfelt, which has Draco perking up. “Well, that can’t be right. Your dad probably just wants you to be some kinda puppet, I bet. A carbon copy of him!”
“Alright everybody!” Gemma calls, cutting into Draco’s mind. She was taking charge after Dumbledore had told the prefects to bring everyone back to their houses… Like Slytherin’s house in the
The sheer number of books makes it clear that Max’s mother may have gotten a little overexcited. It is still a touching sentiment, however, so Draco is sure to stash each one into his trunk back to Hogwarts. With finals coming up, however, he isn’t sure how many he’ll be able to finish.
“Luckily, I had already made a copy of his files,” Draco slides out a new manila folder, this one dyed red with a pair of W’s written on the tab, and sets it on the desk. “I am aware it was you two who tipped him off. The goblins are professionals, and I trust them much more than you to lay it to me straight - which they did when I gave them their own documents - and you mentioned a displeasure in using actual blackmail in this situation before.”
“I can’t find them anywhere, guys! Papa’s gonna kill me!” Max’d panicked cries come over the radio.
Draco can feel his patience thinning the more they walk. He had been enjoying himself, sitting around and talking, and now he was being dragged around by his best friend because she couldn’t leave well enough alone. Things did get a bit more interesting, however, when a compartment near the back opens up and Draco sees a now familiar mop of black hair.
Draco looks back at McGonagall, eyes big and childlike. “Which do I pick?” he asks. Are certain types better than others? He knew next to nothing about the breeds of owls. Why would he until this point?
So, in response, he left the manor as much as possible. The Ministry was his usual spot, continuing to build up his reputation, but also focusing on Auror work or hiding away in the Records Department.
“Combination of adrenaline crash, pain, and potions,” Draco tries to smirk, but it fades in his exhaustion. He presses his hand more firmly into Harry’s cheek, urging them to make eye contact - grey to green - and he says, honestly, “You have no idea how relieved I am to see you…”
“Why not use veritaserum?” Eve suggests, looking hopefully at Dumbledore, but his smile is sad.
“I understand the intricacies of manipulating every aspect of a potion to produce exactly what I want.”
He nods, turns, and hurries off down the corridor, following after Potter’s trail. Except, clearly, Potter had been moving a lot faster than Draco thought he’d been, and he can’t figure out which way he must have gone.
This was Umbridge trying to squash a perceived threat before it had even started, but had only succeeded in strengthening the resolve of all those involved. Draco could see it in their eyes, could see the anger at so blatantly being denied their rights of self-defense. Even Zacharias Smith had been incensed. The only ones that didn’t seem to share these feelings were Blaise and Edgecombe.
sad, but it wouldn’t change who he, Draco, was as an individual.
him to do something stupid and reckless just because he’s bored.”
First, he heads to the hospital wing, in case Harry actually did end up hurt, but he isn’t there. “Did Potter come by here, Madam Pomfrey?” he asks, when she catches sight of him.
Draco decides to go ahead and recount all that to the Golden Trio, Weasley now laying on his back, crying with laughter, while Harry crouches down and keeps his face buried in his hands. Granger is doing an impressive job keeping her cool.

“What do you propose, then?” Draco demands, bitterness coloring his words, but his expression is far too open to match the tone.
“He was right at the center of the initial explosion when Harry threw the record,” Tracey finally speaks up, standing shoulder to shoulder with Luna, her eyes staring straight at Draco blankly. “He was knocked out from the reaction between the veil and prophecy record, not from the knife. Whatever happened to him because of it has left him comatose.”
Vincent pats the boy’s shoulder consolingly as he tries to remember what he’s forgotten, but Sophie looks up, stares for a moment, then waves her fork at him. “Robes. You forgot your robes,” she says around an entire link of sausage sticking out the corner of her mouth and everyone looks towards Neville. Neville also looks down at himself and, sure enough, he’s only wearing his school uniform without the robes. Realization dawns on his face and the Remembrall suddenly shifts back to white.
He knew exactly what this was about. Despite having joined Sirius and Dumbledore to the hospital wing those few night ago, Draco had hardly had a reason to be there. Sirius and Potter had only been interested in hugging and talking and having
“You could be sorted into it, wear that gaudy yellow and black, and be their queen bee, or something. The dreaded Queen Granger, ruler of the mob.” Oh, now Hermione was holding her face in her hands, groaning at him but still giggling like a loon. Yes, Draco feels like he won this one.
“You are still upset that they will not share all of their information with you,” Draco observes honestly, and Potter heaves a deep sigh.
“It was standing on something. A door, maybe? A trapdoor?” Harry says, “I spotted it when you were waving the shoes at it.”
“Nonverbal?” Hermione asks with a snap of her fingers, like she just remembered the term, and Vincent looks surprised, but happily so. He then smiles at her, a bit brighter, and nods. When Draco looks at her with a confused expression on his face she launches into an explanation. “It means he has the physical capability of speech, but is unable to talk for a multitude of reasons.”
Draco shrugs, as if it is no big deal. “Then this will still be a helpful lesson for your life, I suspect. How do you expect to get better if you don’t push your boundaries a little?”
“Oh, what? Are you saying you don’t want any more snakes in your class?” Draco purrs.
“That must be Harry,” Draco says firmly because, well, who else could it be?
“No sir, I don’t have any photos,” Draco says evenly, keeping his voice as respectful as possible, “You see, sir… My only interest is the
“Oh…” Tracey tilts her head in the other direction. “That makes more sense.”

“You think
“So, what now?” Lee eventually whispers, breaking the silence as delicately as he possibly can, and they all glance around at each other.
Fortunately Malfoy doesn’t seem to hear him. They walk down another flight of stairs.
He finished tying the laces of his skates with angry, jerky movements and stood.
Scorpius is the best thing that happened to Ernestina. Ernestina is very lucky that Mistor Draco keeps her employed.”
then pockets his wand and rests his back against the door.
I do. And that was actually the last question.
“But at the same time, I
“My god, Malfoy…”
“Shut up.”
The thought popped into Draco’s head, unbidden. He fought the instinct to roll his eyes. He wasn’t the condescending person he used to be, was he? It wouldn’t do to give Harry a reason to believe him unprofessional as well as unchanged.
Oooh and okay!! Since we're all here!! I'm thinking of
Malfoy looks up at Harry, follows the movement of his hand when he brings it back to his cup of tea. His grey eyes are still, but there’s no distrust in them.
“I… like you too, Potter.”
Harry was in the kitchen, rinsing his hands under the tap. He had dirt under his fingernails from working in the garden with Longbottom all afternoon. He looked cozy and at home, and Draco’s heart ached at the sight.
on the other hand...”
Harry’s green eyes lift to his. They're so bloody beautiful.
by R.E.M.
“Thanks.” Draco’s throat felt tight. He took a gulp of his tea to give himself something to do.
“Sorry,” Harry muttered, abashed. “Care to turn on the light? It’s darker than Voldemort’s arsehole in here.”
Pansy’s question startled him from his thoughts.
“Tonight it is,” Harry says.
Harry rolled his eyes but dropped his hand. “Merlin, Draco. I thought I asked you to call me Harry.”
“Harry—” Ron starts.
He slides his hand in his pocket, touching the warm, round, metallic shape nestled at the bottom. The golden Snitch is still safely tucked there. Harry’s never told anyone that he carries the Snitch around. He can picture his friends’ faces if they’d ever found out: Ron’s quietly worried frown, Hermione’s intense expression as she’d launch into a lecture about the dangers of clinging to the past. Harry’s old Snitch is inoffensive, anyway. The Stone that had been hidden inside is long gone. The Snitch is an empty shell, nothing but a harmless token from Harry’s teenage years now. But it’s still something that grounds Harry in reality, helps him remember what he’s been through, where he’s come from. And that, in the vapid succession of charity galas and theatre premieres and expensive dinners Harry is constantly invited to, is priceless enough to hold on to.
thoroughly enjoy helping Harry with that bet.
“I can definitely see you writing for a living,” Hermione said, “provided you reassess your journalistic integrity. I hardly think we need another Rita Skeeter.”
Eventually, Harry replies: “Hello, Malfoy.”
It was good.
“If I’m sure?” Malfoy laughs, pushing Harry’s hair out of his face. “Oh, Harry. How I’ve dreamed of it. I’ve dreamed of your long, thick cock in my arse. Bet I can feel that monster all the way to my throat.”
PS: actually writing that you’re ‘breezy’ kind of defeats the purpose, Potter.
“Yeah, you’re right,” Harry laughed, too, and the pain in Draco’s chest started receding. “Keep it to yourself, or she’ll turn us both into toads if she finds out.”
Harry leaves the bathroom door and walks back into the bedroom, towards Malfoy. “I really like it here, you know.”
coming from the corridor, like nails tapping on the marble floor, and a big, shaggy Bernese mountain dog appears. He's got beautiful black and white fur with rust-coloured patches above his eyes. He's missing a front leg, but it doesn't stop him from excitedly limping towards Harry. He looks up at him, tongue lolling, and shakes a friendly tail.
“Oh, you would have declined your dear Minister’s request, then? How noble of you.”
Sure enough, two small curls of smoke were rising from Draco’s green tartan slippers which were sitting by the fire.
is too small a word because Malfoy’s letting Harry have this. He’s giving him this gift, instinctively knowing how much Harry needs it. And he’s so fucking beautiful like this, taut and tight and sprawled for Harry to take, that Harry loses it a bit. His hips snap forward, a brief, graceless stutter that has Malfoy’s breath catch. Then he steadies himself, takes hold of Malfoy’s hips, and picks up the pace. He’s less careful now that he’s seen Malfoy take it.
he’d added in his head.
Harry takes a step towards him. Lays his hand in the small of Draco’s back. The muscles underneath Draco’s shirt shiver at his touch.
“You’re a bloody fool, Harry Potter,” Draco whispers against his lips.
“Not when half of the people I love are gone.”
“Everything,” Harry admits. “I didn’t mean to tell him at first—”
“I couldn’t get a hold of you yesterday,” Draco breathed, not even pretending to pay attention to anything else but Harry.
“Hagrid,’ Harry whispered back and he crouched down next to the small slumbering dragon, the awe he held for this tiny creature written clearly on his face.
“And I just found a new piece of evidence. I want to make sure it confirms my intuitions and what I
“Right on my prostate,” Harry confirmed through gritted teeth, having only avoided an early climax by squeezing the base of his cock almost painfully tight.
Mephistopheles dropped his hand and watched him with bloodshot, annoyed eyes. The white-eyed ravens on his shoulders shook their wings.

Antagonising you is… force of habit. I can work against my inner fifteen-year-old self. Can you?”
It’s not the Harry Potter he’s always pictured in his head.
Hermione sets her cup on the table and holds out her free hand to cover Harry’s on the table.
The newspaper clippings are followed by several bank statements, showing revenue streams from countries around the world.
“—a pleasure,” Potter interrupted, holding out his hand. Draco took it and gave it a wary shake.
Three years after the launch of Nesting, Ernestina was a rich elf… and as the primary investor, I was a rich wizard as well.”
Harry would tell you Malfoy is not a git anymore.
“You know, I debated it, but it

nigh. They were last spotted on Ben Macdui, a mountain which had been known since ancient times as a magical place, and since more recent, Internet forum discussion times, as a rapture-free space.
It’s every fantasy Harry has ever blocked, coming to life with an incandescent lack of warning.
Panting, Draco pulled out. He watched his softening cock as it slid out of Harry.
“Please,” Harry breathes. “I’m not ready to come out. I don’t even know what I’m going to come out as. It doesn’t… it doesn’t mean I don’t want you.” Malfoy swallows, and Harry reaches up, brushing the side of his neck with tender fingers. Malfoy closes his eyes as if he’s in pain. “Please. God, Malfoy. It’s ridiculous, how much I want you. You’ve got to know— this is the beginning for me. Not the end.”
A small part of Harry, the undercover agent part, the part that he’s slowly starting to regret, awards him a gold star for this sudden surge of sincerity that serves to build trust with his main suspect.
Eventually, Draco crosses his arms. Lifts his head, considers Harry for a moment.
“He’s also a war hero, and you’re a Slytherin pariah. You do the maths.”
Harry thought fondly.
You’re not exactly impartial, though.
“I just thought about it when she was talking.

its existence. One thing that trip confirmed, though, was my passion for Magizoology. So when I came back to England after six months studying various Scandinavian creatures in their natural habitats, I applied for a degree at the Newt Scamander School in Cambridge.”
“I want you,” Harry whispered. “I want you now. I want you when we’re done. I want you tomorrow.” He leaned in. “I want
In the streets of Hogsmeade, the cheerful spirit permeated everything, painfully at odds with Draco’s rush of self-loathing. The reparations that had been made were objectively impressive. Draco had not expected Hogsmeade to look so festive, so soon after the war. On the first Hogsmeade trip of the school year, the Wizarding town had looked utterly dismal: many of its buildings had collapsed, half the shops’ windows were shattered and gaping in the cold October air, and its main street had looked ripped open by the Blasting curses of the Battle and the steps of Voldemort’s giants. Now almost all the shops had reopened, the craters in the middle of the main street had been filled out, the streets and shops had been decked with fairy lights and bright ornaments, and Celestina Warbeck’s greatest Christmas hits oozed out of magical speakers all over town.
Harry’s expression softens, and Malfoy’s eyes flash when he mistakes it for something it’s not. Pity. Condescendance. Merlin only knows how people usually react to that sort of news.
Harry's brought back weeks ago when he’d been faced with another one of Draco’s scars, when he had dismissed Draco’s explanation — Draco’s apology — about the Dark Mark with a benevolent wave of his hand… God, he’d really been an arse. Draco deserved better. Draco deserves better. He deserves someone who’ll listen. Who will know when Draco needs to lay out his guilt, when he needs to let himself hurt for it, without being told his guilt and hurt are not important enough to dwell on. And he deserves someone who, in turn, will take Draco’s scars face on, and not run away as if burned… as if Draco was the freak, and not Harry, for putting those scars on Draco’s body in the first place.
“Am I, though?” Malfoy licks his lips and pushes off Harry. He straightens his clothes and winks. “‘Til the next time, Potter.”
But Draco only responds with a minute shake of his head.
“Oh, of course, Narcissa,” Andromeda concurred. Neither she nor his mother were fools. “For young men in the prime of life like these two...
“Be like what?” He gestures at himself, up and down his outfit for the day — a long-sleeved, dark green t-shirt, right sleeve rolled up; dark jeans, ripped at the knees; high-rise combat boots, studded with silver. The rainbow badge, gleaming under the office’s neon lights. “Say it, Potter. Say what it is about me that bothers you so much.”
While it’s absolutely true, Harry bristles at Malfoy’s condescending tone.
I didn’t mean to upset or insult you. It was just. I was just trying to tell you: I know, and I’m all right with that.
“Really?”
-Hermione
Harry feels his stomach drop. The words had sounded like an accusation. Then he remembers: Malfoy doesn’t know about his mission. Of course not. That would be absurd. Who would Harry tell about Scorpius?
“I see. And how convenient that I’ll be in the house to look after it… after
He knew he was falling for Harry. He just hadn’t realised it had already happened. He holds onto the man in his arms, and knows that no matter what, he’s already lost.
He sat between Harry’s legs and let his gaze roam up and down his body, Harry’s hard, aching cock already leaking copiously across his stomach.
Harry
Harry leans slightly to better look at the child. He’s small and skinny, dressed in practical Muggle little-boy clothes. His face has the tell-tale pointy quality that he obviously inherited from his father, but his hair curls more than Malfoy’s, its golden colour a few shades darker than his father’s. His big brown eyes, so unlike Malfoy’s, are fixed on the hem of his father’s trousers. “Hello, Scorpius. I’m going to work here.”
“The company is based abroad,” Hermione'd insisted, “British rules may not apply. That could be a way to win the case.” She’d called a certain Ella DiCara — a Ravenclaw four years above them, now a civil rights solicitor — to confirm her intuitions, but Ella hadn’t had time to get back to her yet. Harry had tried not to worry. He’d tried to trust his instincts, Draco and Hermione’s intelligence, and the fact that what he knew of Kingsley painted him as fundamentally just.
Draco swallowed. “How would you know?”
And ‘blond, pointy, skinny’ are not the only adjectives I could use to describe you. It’s just that
“You mean besides disappointing our Headmistress?”
Draco’s head snapped up.
a secret.” His fingers slowly traced the ridge of his cock through his trousers. “You’re fucking hung,” he added, sounding a bit awed.
“Oooh,” Luna said, bending over and grabbing the Niffler by his armpits. “You are so pretty. What have you got here?” She squinted at the ring from behind her goggles. “Oh, I have seen this before...”
in the next room was as bright as Harry had left it, but it barely reached the showers. Even in the near-darkness, though, Harry could make out the half-smile on Malfoy’s face, so unlike the smirk that had been a staple of Harry’s Hogwarts years.
Harry shrugs one shoulder. “Let’s keep it to ourselves for now.”

“All right, we’re home,” Harry tells Scorpius as he slides the key into the lock and pushes the front door of the townhouse open. The little boy scampers inside behind him. “What are the next steps now?”
“Merlin,” he whispered. “I can’t wait to find out how your lips feel around my prick.”
He wasn't sorry. When he ventured a glance at Harry, he could see Harry looked anything but heartbroken.
himself. Do you have any idea how significant it is for Harry?”
to talk about it while we’re still in this… this fucking situation, Harry—”
“Told you,” Draco smiled back, and then they stood smiling at each other for what felt to Draco like a embarrassingly long time.
And Harry doesn’t know what to make of it.

When he only finds Ron waiting for him, he stops in his tracks.
“A case?” Harry leans forward in his chair, his curiosity piqued. “What’s it about?”
He was awfully glad there wasn’t another demon in the room to witness this very un-demonic moment.
“I don’t need one!” Smith roars, gesturing wildly at the study. For someone who knows the place as well as Harry does, the whole scene is blood-curdling; all its meticulous cosiness in utter disarray.  “Look at how the suspect reacted! Isn’t it enough? Aren’t the spells he fired at us enough not only to bypass a warrant, but to justify an arrest?”
Potter’s eyes brightened. “Well, I’m training the team for the European League, so it’s been an intense couple of months. But the new players are doing great, really blending in with the old ones, it’s going to be a great team. Most wizarding sports commentators are saying England has an actual shot to win the tournament next year.”
Luna took a moment to consider him. “We are the same age, Draco,” she said thoughtfully after a while. “We’re the same generation. We went through the same events, at the same time. It’s funny that they would think that about me, but not about you, don’t you think?”
“Granger, practical as ever.”
“Two weeks ago, maybe?”
Thinks of Harry again, the way he’d looked at Draco from across the room, like his entire world was collapsing.
And being here — being at Malfoy’s house instead — definitely is. Morning sunlight floods the rooms, pouring from large skylights; the light pine hardwood floors are smooth under the soles of Harry’s shoes. The air smells clean, warm, the scent of fresh laundry and dust motes floating in the rays of sun coming from the windows.
“I like it,” Harry told him in the same playful tone. “I hoped to see you, too.” His voice dropped. “I missed you,” he added, cheeks pinking attractively.

“That it’s something only the incurious do?” Parvati asks, all faux-innocence.
Pott—Harry,” Draco said, snatching the books back from Harry's hands.

Harry recognises his ‘CV.’ Every single line of it is fake, at least the ones that come after 1998. Nevertheless, he knows each one of them by heart, with a good story to share about each of them, and he knows he could discuss it with Malfoy without raising the slightest suspicion.
“Never knew it was a fantasy of yours.” Harry placed his hand on Malfoy’s bare chest and pushed, a gesture more gentle than commanding. In the darkness, he saw Malfoy smile and step back until his back hit the wall. He sprawled his hands on the dry, white tiles.
“Yes,” Draco said. At Harry’s doubtful expression, he stepped closer. “And no.” He touched his fingers to Harry’s jaw, gently tilting his chin until their eyes met. “Ideally, I would have picked a more romantic spot for our first time back together again. But really, anywhere would do, if I could have you again.”
He finally reached it. It was a massive oak tree, standing eerily still in the middle of an open clearing. Its trunk and leaves were bright red as if on fire, glowing unnaturally in the darkness surrounding it. Draco had always thought the look of the ancient red oak tree was fitting.
He spotted a wooden stool and pulled it close to Luna’s armchair.
Harry laughed. “Breathe, Draco.”
Harry hadn’t been sure what to make of the Draco Malfoy he’d read about in the DMLE folders, especially as the files also contained more…
“Oh, yeah, definitely prime personality test quality, Draco.” Harry looked at him skeptically. “Remind me again, what are we supposed to be doing? Making an important decision for our futures, or filling out a

Harry laughed. “‘Professional Quidditch player’? Is this
The rooms are sunny and light, like the rest of the house. It’s probably a coincidence that Harry has come here during the only two sunny days of January in London. He takes it as a… sign.
They all file back inside the study, and after shaking Harry’s hand and patting his back and assuring him Draco will get his knickers untwisted eventually, Blaise and Pansy leave through the front door.
It was the third time today.
Draco swallowed audibly. Harry looked up at him, his green eyes gleaming and an impish grin on his lips.
Harry beamed. “Merry Christmas, Draco.”
“Well, maybe the Chosen One can afford to bumble about as though his decisions have no consequences,” Draco commented curtly. “I, on the contrary, am almost all out of options. I am a Marked ex-Death Eater, after all. I don’t expect recruiters to fall over themselves to hire me. When I send my application for a job, there shall be no Harry Potter pleading for me to convince my prospective employers.”
“Hands on the wall, Potter,” he’d growled, draping himself against Harry’s back like an animal in heat, and Harry had done as instructed, thrilling at the sensation of Draco against him. Draco’s fingers had fumbled with his flies before he’d reached round him and brought him off like that, and Harry had come all over the wall with a muffled cry and stars bursting behind his eyelids.
(See the end of the chapter for
Malfoy’s shoulders slump and he dramatically rolls his eyes, exasperated.
I’d offer for you to come to the lab, but Smith’s forehead vein is already bulging from all your memos flying in and out, so maybe stay away for now if we want to avoid a vein-tastrophe?
Harry nods towards the stairs. “You haven’t shown me the ground floor… there’s still hope.”
He looked at Draco.
“I had no idea, Ernestina.”
“Glad to know what turns you on.”
“I'm sorry,” Harry’s voice came from nearer than Draco expected. He had scooted across the sofa, closer to him. “I was just trying to make a joke. It was insensitive of me. I apologise.”
“It’s ridiculous. The Ministry is investigating you. Sooner or later, they’ll find out… and what’s worse, they’ll find out when they’re extra pissed off about having been made to wait.”
“I’m very likable,” Draco said, rather stiffly. He barely dared to breathe. There was a

Until Malfoy dropped his hand to Harry’s arse and touched his finger, warm and wet, to his twitching hole.
Next to him, Harry laughed. His eyes were shiny and wet, and Draco wondered if there would ever be a time where their interactions wouldn’t feel like digging up old pain. He squeezed Draco’s arm again, as if teetering on the brink of a hug.
He'd never had a best friend before, not in any of his many lives. He and Greg and Vince had been companions thrown together by the whim of higher-ranking demons, turned faithful friends by sheer force of habit. Pansy, however, was more of an accident. With her awe-inspiring persistence, her almost-demonic bitchiness and her fierce loyalty, she had wormed her way into Draco’s affection. He wished he could take her with him in his next life, if that would ever happen.
“Hey, I read the memos you send to Kingsley every week," Ron says. "It looks like Malfoy is either clean or much better at hiding criminal activity than anyone has any right to be. You could close the case tomorrow if you wanted.”
“Okay,” Harry conceded. He was surely a bright shade of crimson by now, anyway. “It’s...
Harry looked up at him. “Yeah?”
Harry almost tripped over.
“Of course there’s something wrong,” Malfoy scoffed behind him. “I could cast a stronger
“Fuck,” Harry gasps, thrusting in as carefully as he can, but he’s already panting, fighting to restrain himself, sweat beading on his brow. Malfoy’s so tight, and the moment feels so heavy and huge, not just the excruciating pleasure of Malfoy’s arse around Harry’s cock, but the knowledge of what Harry’s doing, what they’re doing, and the fact that there will be no going back from it. From knowing what fucking a man feels like. From knowing what Malfoy feels like under Harry’s hands. From knowing he loves it as much as Harry does. From knowing Harry likes him, and Malfoy likes him back, and maybe
“Thank you, Harry,” he said. He’d never meant it more.
“Headmistress,” Harry continued, “I... This is a decision that belongs to me. Lately... I realised how little I had decided for myself up until now. I don’t want to rush into things anymore. I want to—to
“Hey,” Harry says, his voice quiet.
“Are you under the impression that I want to talk about any of it?”
Merlin forbid anyone look at us and think ‘I’d like to
“For fuck’s sake, Draco — do you seriously think you’re not a worthy cause?”
I couldn’t have
“Voluntarily?”
“Do you want me to go?”
Turns back to see the hurt and betrayal on Draco’s face, a second before he schools his features into a stone-cold mask Harry barely recognises. Harry raises a hand in a timid goodbye, a gesture meant to be friendly, meant to mean
“Will your Muggle relatives be joining us, then?” Draco turns to Potter, who immediately scowls at the thought. Draco finds this reaction rather curious.
Those cunning folks use any means
Things were going pretty well, Vincent and Greg quiet as they ate, even offering pieces of some of the food Draco and Hermione had not tried, while the latter two continued their talk about what they hoped to accomplish during their school year. The two, large wizards had been an unexpected addition, but all in all Draco felt very content and excited. He didn’t even get agitated when Hermione bullied the three boys into their robes early, wanting them to be ready to arrive no matter how far out they may still be.
Eventually talk of schedules pitters off and Draco and Hermione fall into their own conversation, murmuring about their first night and what they thought of their houses.
Astronomy was held at midnight in the Astronomy Tower every Wednesday and was, to Draco’s knowledge, the only class that taught all four houses at once. It made sense, since all the other days were probably for all the other years, and the tower was large enough, but it still felt like it had to be quite the undertaking for their teacher. Thus far all of Slytherin, Gryffindor, and Ravenclaw were already there and they were just waiting for Hufflepuff and Professor Sinistra.
“Hogwarts, like the disease?” Draco interrupts and immediately feels like he could smack himself. Really? That’s where he went? He couldn’t ask how the woman knew his name? No, he had to ask whether Frederick’s comment was true.
“Draco…” One of Harry’s hands has moved to card through Draco’s hair, pushing it a little out of his face before it flops back down. “I want to be your safe place, too. Please… let me be there for you.” And then he’s pressing his lips to Draco’s.
“In a moment. First I needed to remind your family of a few things,” the woman said. Draco bit his tongue to keep from snapping that they weren’t his family, a bad habit he still hadn’t managed to shake over the years. “Thanks to the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy the Wizarding World has remained a secret for centuries,” she says to Mr. Nubble. Her voice is slightly raised, however, which probably means she knows Ada and Frederick are listening in somewhere. “I must firmly request you not tell anyone about us. It is for everyone’s safety that our secret continues.”
“Well, if you mean fate as in ‘every single piece of our lives was decided by something else before we were even born,’ then no, I don’t think it’s very real…” Longbottom says, eyes tilted up towards the glass roof of the greenhouse. “But maybe substantial parts of our lives? Maybe the paths we take there can differ, but the outcomes will remain the same?”

something. He wasn’t boring, he wasn’t disgusting, and he had a remarkable talent of standing in the perfect lighting.
“Shut up, no you’re not.”
The swamp truly wasn’t going anywhere anytime soon, with students having to be brought across on boats by Filch. Filch, Umbridge, and the bad-Slytherins in the Inquisitorial Squad hated it, while everyone else saw it as a necessary inconvenience. The only person who seemed to like it at all was…
“I’m rather curious of the cinema, if I am to be quite honest,” Draco hums, tapping his chin with his free hand. “Max won’t shut up about me finally seeing a film. Plus, Eve has offered to take us shopping.”
He sighs, but he must enjoy pain because he takes out the CD and puts it into the player then slips the thin headphones onto his ears. Sure enough a very familiar, upbeat drum kicks up, shortly followed by clapping and some kind of fast-paced strings. Draco lowers his face into his palms and groans deeply.
“Oh, stop pouting,” Max snickers and Draco quickly forces his face back to something neutral, refusing to admit he actually had been pouting. “There’s bound to be tons of machines there that’ll cause radio interference. Papa said so. We won’t know for sure until I get there, but...”
It is wide and spacious with bookcases lining the walls, cushions on the floors, and plenty of targets for when they get into more offensive spells. There’s a Muggle first-aid kit hanging on one wall, along with a few healing potions, and Draco can’t help but chuckle.
“Yes,” she says immediately then leans back forward towards her book, “Which is how I know that this simply cannot be supernatural, or magical, in nature.”
“He cheated on me, okay?”
Sirius is told to call on Lupin, that they would be in charge of gathering up some kind of “old crowd,” which Draco can only assume must mean the Order of the Phoenix from the First Wizarding War. Then he talks to Snape in the most cryptic tone, saying, “You know what I must ask of you. If you are ready…” he takes a breath, “If you are prepared…”
~ ~ ~
Despite knowing that his mother knows best, that his mother is the wisest, smartest woman in the world, and he should never question her better judgement… Draco still feels like this sounds a lot like giving up.
At least that is what Draco assumes Dumbledore’s reasoning is. He never gets much more explanation beyond a short message through a glowing, phoenix Patronus.
“What are you doing up here?” the other boy asks. He sounds confused, not confrontational, which at least has Draco’s hackles lowering a tiny bit. Maybe, if he played his cards right, he could just agitate Potter enough to leave.
But Max doesn’t care. They keep being his friend and start speaking low over the radio, about how Draco will be okay, how they would cry if Draco died, and how they will never leave his side no matter what.
“I suspect you are here to observe the final task, Sirius?” Draco questions.
“A dire situation you could say, George,” says Fred. Draco has turned his glare on Harry and Ron by now, who seem to finally have realized what they’ve done, their eyes wide and looking anywhere but at him.
learning, but in your own time. It’s making sure information stays in our heads for later use, rather than in passing.”
“Well, I don’t think she’s unlucky,” Theodore mumbles, cradling the kitten close. He looks at the little cat like she’s one of the most important things he’s ever seen. “She found me, didn’t she, so… Yeah, I’m going to name her Lucky! And I’m going to take care of her!”
“Did you just say… comatose…?”
“Oh, that’ll make things so much easier,” Blaise says with a pleased smile, then begins to explain his plan. “We’re safe so long as we’re here, but we definitely want to get out of here, even with your Order of the Phoenix on its way. Hogwarts was a mess when we left, but it’s safer than here, and we
“They really aren’t that bad, guys,” Harry mumbles, eyes flicking to Draco across the table. “Draco’s been really nice to have around, too.” A whole bunch of eyes suddenly turn to Draco, having only just then realized he had sat down at their table, and the blonde sits up a little straighter.
“Their quidditch team definitely does,” the other twin says with a shrug, seeing this as some normal, if unfortunate, occurrence.
“THEY! Right, it’s their fault, right? For being born? For living? You wanna blame them for something that isn’t even their fault! You can’t blame someone for something they didn’t even decide… But plenty of people can blame you for your crappy attitude! You wanna know why? Because you had to
But did that actually mean they could be trusted?
“The knife is fine…”
“And you are all… okay?” Sinistra questions, head tilted in her mimicry-of-humans kind of way.
“For questioning her?” Draco asks, completely blown away by the incompetence he was hearing.
One of them is shaking, but Draco isn’t sure who, and it feels so foreign and surprising, but so incredibly right and perfect and… it is over far sooner than it should be, with Potter releasing Draco and backing up quickly like he’s been burned.
Pomfrey is momentarily frustrated with him and his noise, but when she sees his frantic expression she sobers and asks what’s wrong. Somehow he manages to communicate the need for her to hurry to Moody’s office, making sure she understands fully that things are about to become very messy, before he’s sprinting back out.
They had stopped and Draco hadn’t even noticed, but he did look forward when he realized McGonagall was talking again, her voice carrying through the room. Now so much closer Draco can see the faculty’s faces properly. There is Hagrid, he’s easiest to spot, and a very small man Draco thinks might be Flitwick based off Hermione’s descriptions. There is a sweet-looking, squat woman in robes that looked like they may have once been green but were so patched up and dirtied by now it was hard to tell.
“Why would I do that if I already have you at my beck and call?” Draco drawls, bored, and crosses his arms. Skeeter seems particularly displeased by the comment and, thankfully, shuts up for the time being. “Find anything out about Crouch?”
He takes a deep breath and reaches up to run his fingers through his hair, catching Potter’s eyes following the motion. “I don’t know if we became friends immediately, but they gave me this radio to stay in contact and… I never stopped.”
“Do you recall the file I showed you on the record? It didn’t have the actual prophecy in it, but it DID state that Professor Trelawney was the one to make it, while Dumbledore was the one to hear and turn it in. We could speak to one of them,” Draco squeezes Harry’s wrist, “Once we get out of here.”
“Ah, actually, no,” Max’s father says, looking to the photo, “That would be very impossible back then.”
Draco finally allows himself to laugh, earning a glare from the girl at his side.
Fuck, that’s Harry’s wand.
“Did you kill all of them?” Draco asks, then cringes when Eric just begins sobbing, no words.
It’s a few moments after Malkin has pulled out a second measuring tape that the other boy seems to finally notice Draco and smiles over at him, a tiny bit more subdued but still more energy than seems necessary. “Hello!” the boy says brightly and Draco blinks.
“Well,” Hermione muses, two of her fingers poking out from the fluffy towel to grip Viktor’s sleeve, who has crouched close to her with rosy ears, “at least neither one is strong enough to throw punches right now. An actual conversation once in a while would be nice.”
In the momentary hush, Potter’s watch lets out a succession of beeps. Both men stare at it.
“Interesting question for a mother,” she says. “‘Do you know he loves you?’”
She’s unrecognizable.
He knows Potter will return, and what the hell, Draco will wait for him.
“That makes no goddamn sense,” he says.
He doesn’t look at anything at all.
“Can I have a, uh,” Potter wipes his hand on a napkin, “another spoon?”
Draco runs up to Potter’s fallen form. He searches every pocket, every hidden compartment in Potter’s clothes, putting everything he could find in his satchel, including Potter’s wand and its back-up in the holster at his chest. He then wrenches the man’s thin jacket from his body, Shrinking it before shoving it into his satchel (thank goodness for the Extension charm). Moving down to Potter’s lower body, he does the same thing to his dirty steel toe boots and, hurriedly, his cargo pants, throwing the sack of rabbit to the side. An offering.
‘Why can’t they bring my best friends.’
The shift is unpleasant, but he likes this form. His power is challenged less often when he is no longer a child.
His Patronus nods, bones rattling, and dissolves.
“See you in a mo’.”
If a typical human can’t walk three steps from the boundary without getting cross-eyed, a creature with limited intelligence and dwindling sense would never even attempt to cross it, let alone get this close to the cabin.
“Am I the one he loves?”
“The first few transformations intensify everything, you see. It takes a while to get used to your emotions getting jumbled up and lit on fire.” Remus has said. “More violence is a common conclusion.” Tapped his bitten-off pinkie finger as proof.
There’s no answer. Draco turns. “Grammedion?”
After a careful
Mix in diced ginger root and a tablespoon of honey for flavor. Make it pleasant for him.
He doesn’t understand why—he’s never understood much, now that he thinks about it—but he’s taken to writing those three words before every message. It feels nice, he supposes, to pretend there’s someone who looks forward to reading his letters, regardless of how boring or awful they are. No matter, a tiny phrase never hurts anyone. He hopes. How many things (small, insignificant things) did he say that—?
Draco closes the window and slides under the cover. Staring up at the swirling darkness of his canopy, he hopes the crane gets to, say, the nearby valley before descending.
Draco chides himself - planning another major attack haunts everyone’s waking moment. And it’s getting painfully close to the truth, too, what with the increased presence of Dementors and other Dark creatures alike. One can never be too careful traversing anywhere with a partner. Which is why, Draco glances over his shoulder, he shouldn’t be annoyed about getting Potter assigned to him.
Listening to Grammedion's raspy voice, Draco remembers a sink oozing with bad decisions. Red weeping from paper-thin skin, Myrtle’s screams and Severus’s salve, not knowing if he would die from blood loss or the water down his throat. Wonder Boy fleeing, leaving him there. And through the suffocation of betrayal, Draco imagines that in another world, he’d make Grammedion a pot of tea and sit by him through the night.
“Oh, Potter, you stupid mutt,” Draco says as if werewolves don’t have skulls of steel and can’t very well survive in those Muggle nuclear wars along with the cockroach. “That door is magically reinforced.”
“That,” he shakes his head, “goodness, that was so long ago. It’s been, what, five years?”
Draco palms the brooch of his cloak. The intricate pattern of a serpent spiraling around a drop of ruby curves up into a glossy orb as he twists it, emitting a ‘click’. Gripping the silver chain connected from the brooch to the other side of the cloak, he loops it tight around his index and middle fingers, sweeping his arm in a downward arc. The chain lengthens from his still-tied cloak, the orb swinging free. Holding his arm straight in front of him, Draco observes its movement. Now the size of a fist, it dangles from the chain to his midthigh, fluttering back and forth.
“Ah-ah-ah,” Malfoy says in a sing-song whisper, laying his index finger on Harry’s lips. The sound of searching footsteps approaches. Any moment now, and Ron will burst in on the most damning scene Harry’s ever been a part of. “Time to be quiet now, Golden Boy. Don’t get caught, remember?”
Do you? I thought you’d read all your note cards.
Harry glanced at him. “Yet here we are.”
“Merlin help us if I ever turn that sweet, Potter.” Harry lifts his brows, and Draco gives him a crooked smile. “I’m weirdly grateful for them, you know?” he confesses.
Harry
The man at the store asked Daddy what kind of ring he wanted, and Daddy asked me again.
Bugger, now the Quill wrote it down. Oh, sweet Salazar. Remind me to edit it out later.
he said.
“Erm,” he said, stepping back. “Thank you.”
Christmas!”
“Oh my god,” Harry mutters. “You bossy dick.” He comes closer, slaps a hand on Draco’s arse cheek, caresses it slowly, close to the crease. Draco whines again, embarrassingly loud, and Harry slips his fingers in the mess there, rubbing come and lube across Draco’s arsehole. Then he pushes two fingers in and Draco cries out against the desk, eyes wide, hand stuttering over his cock.
“Sorry about your elbow,” Harry said as they walked out of Dervish and Banges. “That fall looked painful.”
Something in Harry wanted to cheer.
“Hey! Don’t laugh," Hermione says. "I have a four-year-old girl and a six-month-old baby and my brain has basically turned to mush. Everyone has this pushchair here. It was designed for parents living in big cities, apparently — I can manoeuvre it everywhere in London, no matter how much dog poo or rubbish bags are blocking the pavement.”
“You care too much about what other people think. You’re allowed to change. You’re a good person.”
Breathes a sigh of relief.
“I mean it.”
One of the girls snorts in the background, but Draco’s attention is all on Potter: the pink on his cheekbones, the rise and fall of his chest under his pressed, crimson Auror shirt, the helpless movement of his Adam’s apple in his throat. Merlin, if only the annoying prat wasn’t so bloody gorgeous…
Harry feels his temper rising for the first time in days. “Thanks? For the awkward situation? How was I supposed to know—”
“I will pretend like I know what that last part means and say ‘aye’.”
Draco gnaws his bottom lip and wets the still-throbbing cut on it. Then, he rolls his eyes, sliding them shut. No big deal.
Draco twirls the Indicator and thrusts it forward, catching Potter off-guard. With his other hand, he throws a powerful Stunner at him. Staggering back, Potter tries to retaliate but to no avail; the spell has hit its mark. Draco has about five seconds to prepare.
“There we go,” Dr. Stewart says and flips open a thick, stapled stack of paper. “You are to stay here for the duration of your first assignment. Count yourself lucky, starting work right away.”
his mother has reminded him before her one-way Portkey to the Continents activated,
“Contact us for help, goddamn it, you’re a valuable member of the Order!”
[distant whistling]
Draco lifts his eyes from his mug. Potter isn’t standing in front of him but off to the side, leaning against the door frame with crossed arms. His hair is cropped shorter than Draco’s ever seen it—what’s the term, a burr cut?—making the scar across his forehead and eye more jagged, the edges harsher. His eyes aren’t as harsh, however, their shade of moss-green reminding Draco of the life his garden is regaining. He’s definitely not dressed for the weather, what with that thin jacket and apparently unlined jeans. The hiking boots look alright, though.
Only one foggy, crooked path forward.
Draco’s lips flatten to a thin line.
Harry bats the teacup from Draco’s hand. It flies across the room, shatters, drenching the wallpaper. The broken shards are millimeters away from impaling a framed picture. Their framed picture.
Draco cracks a smile, then pauses. “Oh, that’s not a joke? Huh,” he purses his lips. “I assume people finally caught on.”
This line of thinking is bound to give Draco a big head, he thinks. Potter probably eats at La Villa before, and Draco’s never seen him around since he’s worked in the kitchen until recently. It’s a bit strange, though, how he only gestures for Draco’s help instead of the waiter working at his table.
“Good to know,” Draco grabs a handful of Floo powder. “I’m going to Pansy’s.”
“And after this month, you will be out of Wolfsbane to disperse, correct? Tell me, do you think these contaminated vials merely don’t work?”
“Precisely,” Dr. Stewart says. “So, believe it when I say you’re the exception.”
“Will you listen,” she answers, “to what I have to say?”
