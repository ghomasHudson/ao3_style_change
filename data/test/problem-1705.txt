Malfoy sat beside Harry, his knees neatly together, his legs bent at a perfect right angle. He looked faintly ridiculous, Harry thought, and utterly awkward. The firelight glinted gold on his hair and skin.
The smell of Draco’s cream filled the room as Harry opened the pot, redolent of summer afternoons sitting outside the cottage and laughing in the studio as Henry spun small bowls.
Draco’s smile dropped a little. “Oh. Great. And of course she’s clever; how do you think she got sorted into Ravenclaw?”
"Transparent?" asked Malfoy, turning around. "Not charmed to show the sky outside, like at Hogwarts?"
"I have," said Harry, "but maybe I need to stop running away. Maybe… maybe life is about more than hiding in the woods."
Draco clamped his mouth shut, and glared at Potter once more before walking over to examine the painting. Snape was sitting in a dark corner, his face lit by some unseen lamp or lantern. The painting was heavy with greys and blacks, and Snape had an unhealthy pallor to his skin. “The artist really captured your likeness, sir.”
Ron cocked his head to one side, then nodded slowly, a grin forming. “Did you have to—” He stopped talking when he saw the expression on Harry’s face. “Sorry, mate, but it is a little funny.”
Draco closed his eyes, to better picture the candlestick. “Silver, neoclassical, square-stepped base and fluted column, topped with scroll capitals.” He opened his eyes. “About ten, eleven inches high.”
Harry could hear a defiance in his voice that he recognised from that day, but at the same time it sounded so different to both the arrogant Malfoy of the past, and the more subdued one of the present. He looked at him in surprise.
Harry wasn’t sure that a few candles would do the trick; Hermione was probably trying to spare his feelings. A bud of warmth grew from somewhere deep within Harry regardless at the thought he could offer this, a home for Ron and Hermione.
Harry kissed him, hard and deep, then slid onto the floor. He’d known the Room had put the rug there for a reason.
"I will sort your house for you, Potter," said Malfoy. Harry was about to protest that he really didn't need him to say where he should sleep, when Malfoy shook his head. "I mean that I'm going to work out what this curse is." He put his cup down and rubbed at his forehead with his long fingers for a moment. "Although at the moment, I don't understand why you've had these things falling down." He looked up at Harry, and raised an eyebrow in question. "Unless you've been faking it to get some attention?" he asked. Harry wasn't sure if he was serious or not.
When they got to the edge of the village, they transformed into their Animagus forms. Over snow and moonlight, they ran and flew to the Castle, free in the night.
Grander stone buildings in a range of cool whites stood alongside timber-framed buildings that leant into the road. Muggles wandered around with sun-reddened shoulders and carrying those horrible plastic bags in their sweaty hands. Draco was relieved when Henry pulled them towards an ivy-covered wall and took them through to the wizarding part of town.
As the first few notes filled the room, Draco stopped thinking entirely. He’d only heard Potter play a few times, but he could remember each occasion with total clarity. The first time had been at the old Avery house, where Draco had been sent by his rather ghoulish boss at the time to appraise the furniture for sale. There was something distinctly sour about being in another Death Eater’s former home, knowing that soon a crowd of vultures would descend to stock their own houses and auction sites. And line the Minstry’s coffers, too. Draco knew though, that taking on such a job might help preserve his own home, so he nodded and smiled and worked his way through the house, methodically pricing everything he laid eyes on. When he got to the music room, he nearly let out a rather undignified yelp when he found Potter standing at its centre, a violin in his hands and a faraway look in his eyes.
“And men,” Blaise added from his armchair. Pansy ignored him. Potter shifted uncomfortably beside Draco, who was really tempted to put a hand out and rest it on Potter’s knee.
Draco took a deep breath. “I kept seeing visions of different possible futures involving you. It was… disorienting.”
"Of course," said Harry, and then he paused. "Do you think... could I ask you a question?" He looked over, and didn't continue until Malfoy nodded. "Why do I have to be here? I don't understand. And if it's just to get your coffee, then I don't really think that's a good enough reason for me to be missing work, and I might as well ask Kreacher to come—"
Hermione’s quill resumed its scribbling, and Harry returned to the headache-inspiring topic of wizarding rituals. Headache or no, it seemed a safer topic than warm eyes and nice Malfoys.
“Oh don’t get your knickers in a twist. I didn’t say you were like an elephant, I just said that sometimes I hear you. Because I’m lying awake in bed, stupid. I also hear the cat tearing around.”
A shiver of breeze dislodged a scattering of heavy raindrops from the leaves above. A drop ran down Potter’s cheek like a tear, and Draco moved closer still to wipe it away. He moved his free arm to Potter’s jumper, pulling on a loose piece of yarn with his finger. “You wear the most awful clothes, Potter.”
“Oh, I do a little. But I don’t have a supply of potions for headaches and hangovers, and my wand is crappy anyway.”
“Everyone needs a hobby,” Arthur said, completing the familiar routine. He helped himself to some peas, and smiled to himself.
The chickens pecked around at the end of the yard, and above their heads smoke rose from the chimney. Harry was growing chilled after his walk, but didn’t want to move. Not yet. It was good to be sitting like this, looking out over fields and hills with Draco.
Millicent snapped out of her teasing mode into her professional one, as Draco had hoped she would. She was at his feet, wand in hand, before Greg had poured Draco tea into a hastily-Summoned cup.
," the snake said, sounding a little incredulous. Harry couldn't quite believe that a talking snake woven into a carpet was giving him attitude.
Draco shivered as Harry pulled the covers away, but didn’t complain as Harry climbed down the bed, kissing his way down Draco’s chest until his mouth was just touching the end of Draco’s prick.
Before Harry could decide whether to lean forward himself, Draco turned his body, pulled out his wand, and cast his Patronus.
The four of them sat together - the Room having doubled the number of sofas - and Ron burst out laughing when he saw the cake. Hermione elbowed him and he stopped.
"Ask it if it knows who we are," he said. Harry glanced over at him, but now Malfoy's eyes were fixed on the snake.
With so many trees carpeting the hills beneath him, it was hard for Draco to know where exactly to head. He remembered, then, the first time he had come into these woods, and the way he had sensed their magic. Hovering in midair, Draco closed his eyes and focused, trying to feel the magic that felt like home. Like Harry. Unlike the time before, he was aware of a whirl of trees; he could identify beech and birch, chestnut and oak, all intertwined.
"I still think you're mad," she was saying. He could hear the pout in her voice: Pansy sounded as if she knew he wouldn't listen to her.
As it turned out, there really wasn't much of interest in either Sirius or Regulus's rooms, beyond old school books, a dented old set of gobstones, and a wizarding chess set with a missing knight and a huge crack across the board. Which only left another three floors to explore.
Stiff fingers pull away, as if burnt. Harry turns the book back a few pages, until he finds knotgrass. He taps the page, then lays his hand on Malfoy's arm. Malfoy glances down at the page then looks up at him, and Harry notices the pink indentations where he has been biting his lips. With a curt nod, Malfoy sits, passive and silent, waiting to see what Harry does next. Hoping that he is indeed right, that this is the key to unravelling this essay, Harry unrolls his scroll, and shows Malfoy his notes.
Draco looked at his feet. “I’m a little rusty; to be honest, I don’t think I’d even get an interview.”
“Has he at least called you ‘Harry’ yet?” asked Blaise. Potter shook his head, and Blaise handed over the other Galleon with a sigh. Pansy popped her money back in her purse with a smug smile.
At that very moment the doorknob squeaked and began to turn. Harry could hear Ron berating Ernie: apparently, Ernie had forgotten something in the room.
Pansy sneered as if Draco had said a dirty word. “That doesn’t count.” She had a job, but never spoke about it, probably because it was so boring. Something to do with filing, if Draco remembered correctly. “You know how hard we’ve all found it just to keep going. If you start hiding away, it makes it much harder on the rest of us.”
Draco merely raised his eyebrows. Potter had disappeared overnight, leaving only a misspelled note for his friends. No one, not even Granger or Weasley according to the
Harry and Draco stood side by side in the kitchen, peeling vegetables for a Sunday roast. Draco, not Malfoy; at some point in the week, between the shy glances and electrifying accidental touches, Harry had begun to think of Draco as Draco, and that had been that. Aloud however, had been another matter. A nervous energy that wouldn’t dissipate had Harry on edge; his leg kept jigging and he’d been finding things to do all morning. The build up of tingles, zings and zaps had Harry almost on edge now. He was jumpy, and Draco had begun to notice.
Narcissa’s hand dropped into her own lap. “Oh, Draco. You’ve brought this all on yourself, without any help from me.”
But then he thought again of Malfoy, returning day after day until he repaired an unrepairable Vanishing Cabinet. He could see, in a weird, twisted way, Malfoy’s logic in wanting to fix the room to make up for his earlier actions.
Harry didn’t even consider how to answer Malfoy. Instead, he launched himself at across the space between them, his hand already balling into a fist. Before he could do anything with it though, Malfoy had knocked him to the ground. Grabbing what he could – Malfoy’s robes, an arm, – Harry tried to push Malfoy down, and roll on top. But Malfoy, despite his slight-seeming build, was strong, and had probably spent hours practising every move covered in their Physical Defence classes. It didn’t take long for him to be straddling Harry, his hands pinned down beside him.
“Andromeda,” Malfoy said, holding out his hand. Harry could see the effort it took to do so. Malfoy’s hand, Harry would warrant, would be cold and shivery however mild the day.
He could admit that now, admit that he had thought about Potter over the years. If Potter had stayed, could they have been friends? Based on the past week or so, Draco thought that it could, after all, have been a possibility. But now that he was reminded of the reality of who Potter was – of his friends and the years of silence while he hid here, in the woods – Draco saw that this was a delicate thing, this possible-friendship between the two of them. As it ever had been.
Sometimes Draco liked to imagine that a particularly stubborn baked-on section was someone or something that had pissed him off. To be frank, working in this kitchen it could be anyone, or anything. He scrubbed harder, and was rewarded with a clean and shiny pan. Until he turned it, and saw a corresponding brown patch on the other side.
Draco looked away. That hopeful, bashful smile seemed like a weakness to him. He was used to pushing against his father, pushing against his mother. A happy minstrel seemed far beyond his experience. Instead, he put his things down by the sofa, then sat down at the table. He didn’t wince as much as he’d thought he would as he lowered himself into the chair.
Draco was much more comfortable once he’d stepped back and turned to his wand for the next few tests. Potter was, of course, healthy, hearty, fit and… well,
“I needed to get away from your dreadful clanging and sulking. And I had to rewash some of those dishes; you did a terrible job.”
“You…” Harry took a shuddering breath, then the smile he felt inside burst through. “You kissed me.”
This Draco had heard of, but he would never have imagined… never Potter. Some witches and wizards became almost addicted to powerful magic. Ultimately, it could destroy them as they sought out darker and darker magic.
“Well I’m going to try again,” said Malfoy. “We can’t keep living in this… chaos of stinking socks and Harry Potter slaving away like a house-elf.” Greg looked over at the pile of his clothes in the corner.
Malfoy’s face, already looking sad and young, fell further. “Oh.” He stared down at his hands. "Sirius Black. He was a cousin of mine, of sorts,” he said.
Thrushbeard. The wizard Draco had laughed at, all that time ago? The one who had precipitated the whole married-off-to-a-stranger thing? Anger built as he stared at the beard. His parents had tossed him out, because of
“I'm not sure what to think about all this,” Harry said. “Like I said, I’m not her keeper. Maybe she could like you, maybe not. Maybe she’d rather play Quidditch. Either way… it’s for you to find out, not me.”
When he saw the Pensieve as he was looking for his shoes the next morning – without Draco around to remind him, Harry had forgotten to put them away – Harry paused, toast in mouth, and glared at it. Guilt almost instantly tugged at him, and he swallowed his toast with difficulty. He put the Pensieve up on the side, out of the way. He wasn’t going to watch any more memories. He didn’t have time for Draco’s self-indulgent trip down memory lane.
“Well, I want something different.” Harry looked up. Ginny's eyes were on the far horizon. “I want freedom, and wide new skies. I don't want to be precious and hidden, and I don't want to be tied to anyone. Not even you.” She took a deep breath. “Right now, I just want to fly.”
“No, no. I want to show you my workshop. But not tonight.” A wicked gleam lit Henry’s eyes, and he pulled his hand away to gesture outside. “As my clay offends you so much, I’m going to wash it off!”
Hermione nodded. “And I’ve been using a pseudonym. They didn’t do it because of who I was. I had to tell them, of course, but they’ve agreed to use the pen name when they publish it.”
It was warm by the fire, and the rain seemed far away. Malfoy outlined his plans to familiarise Harry with all the wards, but Harry only half-listened to the words, captivated as he was by the way Malfoy's hands moved through the air, the way he spoke in such concise and elegant language. Malfoy was looking at him as if expecting an answer, and Harry realised that he'd been asked a question. He blinked.
They left the room together, four pairs of eyes following them as they went. Harry cursed himself for his terrible timing.
“Please, call me Blaise. I think I’m in trouble when I hear ‘Zabini’.” Blaise stood in the doorway, looking around. “Of course, sometimes I am in trouble. It’s neater than when Dudley was here.” He sniffed. “Smells better, too.”
Draco closed the Snitch, and it lay, quivering, on his hand. “I don’t know. But if they did it would have taken a lot of work, and left some kind of a magical mark on the Snitch. What I really need is access to the Snitches.”
“Yes.” Narcissa glanced over at her husband who was staring at Draco rather wildly. “Perhaps if you two go now, we can continue this little visit when your father is feeling a little better.”
“I close up soon, do you fancy coming upstairs for a drink? I could fix us up something to eat, too, if you want?”
Malfoy shot a spray of flowers across the room. “I can use my wand again!” Malfoy sang, dancing around and swishing his wand. He added a flock of green parakeets, and Harry set the pans to dancing in their racks to the beat of Malfoy’s feet. Soon the room was filled with petals and feathers, rattles and clangs, as the two of them laughed in childish delight.
"I think," said Harry, as he switched to two fingers, "that at moments like this, I might prefer to call you Draco." He looked down at Draco, skin pinked and lips parted. "I do really like Malfoy, but it's Draco I want to fuck."
Once Harry was at home, even with the room spinning from the hideous combination of Floo travel and drink, he felt a little better.
Draco shuddered at the word ‘suitors’. When he’d been at Hogwarts, with Greg and Vince tripping over their feet to keep up with him and Pansy accidentally letting her hands graze a little too low in their dance classes, he’d never imagined he’d be reduced to the indignity of being paraded around like a prime cut of Malfoy meat.
Harry turned to Andromeda, who lowered her knitting and smiled fondly at her grandson before twinkling her eyes at Harry. “All in height order,” she said. Harry could see how Malfoy would like that, how it would appeal to his need for order.
“Harry, I really don’t know. Probably. I mean, what possible reason could Malfoy have for getting stuck to you?”
Slowly, everyone Apparated away, until only Harry and Malfoy were left, both still sitting on the ground. They stood, brushing off their robes, neither talking. Malfoy’s jaw was set in stiff lines, as if he were biting down hard.
The mirror was back, as was the sofa. This time, he noticed it was sitting on a thick rug. Before he could think why this might be, the door opened and Draco stepped through.
First Malfoy set up a small Shield Charm around the object, which gave everything inside it a slightly eerie silver sheen. He looked up once at Harry, then turned his attention back to the task at hand.
“I—” Harry looked up. Draco was looking at him with warmth in his eyes. “Thank you, that’s actually quite a nice thing to say. If wrapped up in a tiny bit of insult.”
Molly took a bite “Whatever you did, it worked,” Molly said through crumbs. As she chewed and hummed in appreciation, her resemblance to Ron was quite startling.
“Okay.” Harry picked up a bottle and rolled it between his thumb and his fingers. The glass was cool, and felt solid, not fragile at all, beneath his fingertips.
When Henry returned from the market, his nose a little sunburned and fresh food supplies in his bag, Draco had filled the cottage with a steamy cloud.
“He talks to me,” Harry said. He sighed. There was more to tell his friends, and he realised just how much he’d been holding back from them. “You know how I’ve been helping to finish the repairs to the school?”
Draco looked up. He liked sitting by the lake, as the other students usually left him alone. But here was Potter, his cloak wrapped tightly around him against the cold.
A pink wash suffused over Malfoy’s face. It looked incongruous: Harry only really had memories of Malfoy’s face heating in anger. A strange feeling of liberty overcame Harry as he realised that their schoolboy antagonism was a thing of the past. It was gone, and Harry didn’t miss it at all. Being insulted and thinking up insults seemed pointless after everything he’d been through, and it was a relief to find that Malfoy seemed to feel the same way. A little of the tension that Harry had been carrying with him since they had first bonded the day before faded away.
“Before we start the practical aspects needed as the basis of the charm,” McGonagall continued. “What can you all tell me about it?”
in - there had been a bad pixie infestation. Harry tuned out a bit, thinking about how this was the room he’d sat in as a little first year, staring at the Mirror of Erised and his parents. In a way, it made him feel closer to them. It was better, at any rate, than the flashes he’d seen of the night 18 years before.
Harry carried on, cutting a slice for both he and Ron. He wondered about the whole separate-rooms thing, but had no idea how to bring it up.
St Mungo's was busy, as was to be expected on a Friday evening. As he watched people walk in with a range of injuries and ailments, Harry reflected that he really had got off lightly: his fall could have been much worse.
Malfoy stared at him, then stepped back and burst into laughter. Althe— Little lady hooted in surprise and flapped away. Harry’s arm fell to his side; his fingers could still feel Malfoy’s arm, thin and wiry, beneath his robes.
“Yes, but what I want to say is that I’ve changed my mind about him. He’s not as uptight as I thought, and he’s done so much for Hermione’s confidence about cooking. I can’t believe she’s making the Christmas meal this year.”
“You had enough faith in his abilities to risk something new?” Hestia’s voice was almost as sharp as her gaze.
Harry took off his clothes and threw them on the floor. "Ready." He sat on the bed, bouncing slightly, his cock bouncing with him.
As they were leaving the toilets yet again, Harry found himself eye-to-eye with Malfoy, who was walking down the corridor with a mug. After they passed, Harry turned back to see Malfoy staring after him.
When they got back downstairs, there were a few curious looks from Ron and Hermione, but then Greg announced he was going to take up all the floorboards on the stairs to see if he could fix the creaking, and Luna brought out a large bag of Muggle games.
Ron nodded. “Mum said, ‘Harry must be wasting away by now’ so she sent cake.” He opened the tin to reveal a towering carrot cake, the frosting dotted with walnuts.
“It was nice seeing you, too, Draco. You’re looking less pale than the last time I saw you, and your Nargles have disappeared.”
“It doesn’t matter. The point is that there are some places we can’t go, anymore. Have you ever been spat at in the street? Jinxed every time you walk down Diagon Alley? It’s not too bad for me, but for Draco…” He sighed. “I came here to say whatever you think of Draco, he’s… vulnerable. OK? Just be careful. I don’t want him to get hurt.”
Hermione’s reply, when it came, was so neatly written that Harry wondered if she’d had to copy hers out, too. Reading about how her job was going, and her plans for Halloween, along with her gently probing questions about how he was doing, Harry was reminded about just what he liked about her. He smiled as he read her thinly-veiled comments about his obsession with Malfoy. It wasn’t his fault that Malfoy continued to be such a git, was it?
Draco found himself, still hand-in-hand with Harry, in a bright flat filled with paintings of animals. And birds. And sea creatures. Colours clashed, feathers and fronds and hooves all seemed to move in a riot of distraction. Whatever Draco had been about to say or do, he forgot. He let go of Harry’s hand and stared around in horror.
"This won't damage anything, Potter," Malfoy said. "Not," he added, addressing the wall, "that it wouldn't be an improvement."
Whatever Draco thought he knew about the house vanished as soon as they walked through the front door. The place was clean and bright, but rather than being laughter-filled it soon became obvious that it was a small clinic or hospital. A man in pyjamas with his arm in a large bandage was making his way slowly up the stairs, and called out a greeting to Potter.
Malfoy put his folded clothes into his trunk, and took out a book before closing it. “You don’t mind if I read for a while?”
"So you want me to come to try to break a spell?" said Malfoy. "If it is one – or break a curse on a Dark artefact, if one is being used as a focus for all this?"
Harry could imagine little Malfoy, sneering at the Muggles, all arrogance and prejudice. He remembered meeting that Malfoy in Madam Malkins, all those years ago. So much had happened since then - he certainly had changed, himself - but how changed was Malfoy, really? It was confusing seeing this more humble version of Malfoy.
"I’ve got a little cabin here, further into the forest. It’s pretty basic, but it’s closer than the nearest village or road." Potter held his cup tightly in both hands, his fingers – broken dirty nails, calloused, thick fingers – wrapped around it. "You can rest up there, heal a bit more, and sooner or later I’ll get an owl from Hermione and I can let her know to send help or a Portkey for you." Potter spoke so quietly that Draco had lean in towards him to hear what he was saying.
Harry spent a minute thinking about what to ask. "Ok, I've got one," he said. "And now for a snake..." He looked down at the threadbare and stained rug beneath his feet. There was a line of snakes twisting around the edge. Harry concentrated on the most whole one. "
“Um, OK?” Harry knew that some older houses had been built without bathrooms, and then had them tacked on wherever they could be fitted.
Potter shook his head. “Not anymore,” he said, and patted his knee. “It locks up sometimes, and I don’t think it would be safe.”
Second, Malfoy wasn’t eating enough. Harry watched him carefully at meal times. There were no more treat-laden owls from home, but Malfoy was also only managing a bite of his toast in the morning, half a sausage here, one forkful of mash there. His skin was looking paler than ever, and the dark circles under his eyes got darker every day. Every plate he pushed away infuriated Harry; he longed to pick up a fork and get Malfoy to eat more.
Harry ate his pasty as Lavender and Hermione continued their conversation, not really keeping up with the ins and outs of exactly what Lavender was studying: he had a feeling that listening too closely would adversely affect his ability to finish eating. Instead he watched the way she smiled a little as she spoke, and how her hands moved through the air as she became more animated in her descriptions. It had been a while since he’d last seen Lavender, and it was good to see her so much more full of life. Before, she’d looked like life had got the better of her, but now… now she was more like the girl he’d known at school. Except with a serious glint in her eye which he knew went with her scars.
He headed to the door more quickly than he’d meant to, but he needed to get out from under that cold light. When Draco caught up, he looked oddly crestfallen. “I think the bond’s going to end soon,” Draco said. “You moved further away before I
“I did it,” Draco said, his voice full of wonder. Was he referring to the Patronus, or the kiss? Harry wasn’t sure.
“They want more than grades, though. I’ve got to be up-to-date with all the latest research, and I’ve got to show some original ideas of my own.”
“Sorry.” Harry took his hand off the wall. He felt awkward now; Malfoy had been serious and he had been silly. He didn’t want to think about why. “How was your Christmas?”
Lucius stood behind her, his arms folded and a heavy frown on his face. His lip curled upward ever so slightly as he took in Draco’s appearance, and then he turned to Henry.
“You keep taking away my reasons to kill you,” Pansy said, pouting. “But you do know how to keep me happy.” She sighed, and stretched back into the armchair, then flexed her stockinged toes. “I might not have had any war heroes or grande dames to deal with today, but work was still a bore.”
Harry had wondered what he needed to feel at home, but when he had looked over at Draco earlier that evening, at the way his hair glinted in the candlelight, and at the slight twitch of his nose when he thought that Greg was cheating at a game, a warmth had filled him and he knew that he’d found it. Except… well, Draco had said he’d go to the ball with Harry, and even held his hand that morning, but nothing else had happened.
A run of late nights meant that Draco hadn’t seen Henry much, but he’d finally scored a half day, covering for Amy, and he had time to catch up on some his household chores. Better to get them done now, than have to waste his precious day off on them.
Unless she had a Portkey to the south of France, or the Floo co-ordinates of someone in one of the tiny villages tucked among the hills, Draco didn’t see how she could help. Until, that was, she walked back in the room with a broom. It, like her dress, was painted purple, and written on the side were the words ‘Luna’s Ice Creams’ in pink and gold.
“That you’re hung like a—” Malfoy stopped when he saw the look on Harry’s face, and raised a hand in apology. Harry couldn’t quite believe that he’d heard correctly: wasn’t Malfoy the one who always scurried away whenever anyone came to near? “Sorry, I couldn’t resist. You looked so serious. What I meant was, you’ve really been cursed, then? Some kind of a bonding curse?”
They walked through the office, with all the Aurors sat at their desks, busy pretending that they weren’t looking and hadn’t been listening in to everything that Luna had just said.
“Next time I think we should find a way to scrub the room clean,” Harry said. “Get rid of the soot.” He wrinkled his nose. “Maybe make it smell a bit better in here.”
Harry got out of his chair, came around the side of the table. He crouched next to Draco, his head below Draco’s. He took Draco’s hand in his, ignoring the tingle to look straight up into Draco’s eyes.
“By know, I mean…” George paused. “It’s about knowing your body, where the edges of it are, how tall you feel, what the back of your head looks like, things like that. But it’s also about knowing what it feels like to be you. It was one of the trickiest things - after working out what animal came easiest to transform into, and knowing how
Harry shook hands with every Ministry official to come his way. He soon learned that those from Sports and Games did indeed bruise with their hand clasps. Some people, he noticed, pretended Draco didn’t exist at all. Others seemed to note the fact that he and Draco stayed together the whole time, and made a show of greeting Draco, too.
“Are you OK? Draco?” The touch of Sarah’s fingers on his arm broke the stream of images, and Draco was back at the in his consulting room, facing his concerned-looking colleague. “This is beginning to get worrying. Did you hear a word I just said?”
“Cup of tea?” Harry asked. He was careful not to look directly at Malfoy; rather as though he were a wild animal, Harry didn’t want to startle him. Countdown was due to start after the advert break, and Harry had decided that just because Malfoy always watched it didn’t mean that he couldn’t, either.
“Oh, I’m fine with it. Draco wasn’t the one who locked me up in his cellar. Well, not personally. And he used to sneak me apples when he could.”
When he got back from a freezing cold field in the middle of nowhere, it was dark and Draco was asleep. Harry was knackered, but before he went to bed he watched the memory of the breakfast-promise.
“Welcome.” McGonagall fixed them all with her steely gaze, softened slightly by the small smile that quirked her lips. “I would like to remind you that although this is an additional class, once you have committed to being here I expect you all to turn up every week, and to practise between classes. I hope that as well as learning, you will have the chance to think about what using magic in this way will mean to you after you leave Hogwarts. I also hope that you have fun with magic.”
“That would be good,” said George. He seemed to shake himself out of his reverie; he focused back on the three of them, although the sadness in his eyes remained. “Sorry, I invited you all for lunch, not for a pity party.”
"I charmed a section of the roof transparent," Harry explained, as Malfoy stepped into the circle of light on the old floorboards. He left neat, pointed footprints behind him.
"Well..." Harry considered the question. He hadn't really given much thought to how he felt the wards before: he had assumed that most things had been sorted by the Order, and hadn't had any problems. Or none until the accidents.
“I wasn’t in the mood for niceties,” said Henry. “And I didn’t want to shout at you in front of the whole market.”
“It’s fine.” The tightness of Draco’s lips suggested it was anything but fine; Harry didn’t quite know what to say next. He didn’t know how to say
Grand obsidian stairs rose in front of them and curved around to the right. The room where Draco had been tried was out of sight, swallowed into darkness at their top. Draco and Harry stood at the base, side by side. Without a word, Harry reached for Draco’s arm and together they made their way up. About halfway to the top, Harry stumbled and Draco put his arm around him and held onto his hand instead.
“Yes. And… do you want to move a little closer. I bet you’ve been worrying away there and shivering at the same time, haven’t you?”
Luna returned, carrying two steaming cups of coffee. "Sometimes ice cream isn’t always the answer," she said. "I know I shouldn’t say that, but Draco, you really do look terrible." She sat beside him.
“Oh no,” said Draco. Leaning back in his chair and giving Ron a dangerous smile. “He has nothing to be embarrassed about.” He winked at Harry, and Harry saw again the cheeky grin in the mirror as Draco made the insinuation about the size of Harry’s dick. He felt his face heat, and wished that the floor would open and swallow him up. Ron’s eyes widened, then he let out a hearty laugh.
“I was being selfish too,” Harry said. “There might be some good Transfiguration practice in there. I mean, how do you heal a magical castle?”
“Walker is okay, I guess,” said Harry. “But he did let through an awful lot of Quaffles in that match against the Tornadoes.”
Draco jumped into the river. It did him no good to dwell on Henry’s cock while he was naked, not if he didn’t want his own one to betray his interest. Draco’s chest tightened from the coolness of the river, but his head felt wide and wakeful as he ducked under and swam for a few strokes. Water splashed onto his face as Henry jumped in beside him.
Falling back into kissing, their kisses took on a new intensity. Harry wanted to devour Draco. Evidently, Draco felt the same, because before long Draco had flipped them over and was straddling him, and the two were rubbing even more intensely against each other. Harry’s dick was caught almost painfully in his pants, but he didn’t care as he felt the heat and pressure of Draco’s erection against his own.
He came into the living room to see that Malfoy was already in place, a cold glass of water on the coffee table and Felix settled in a puddle on his lap. Malfoy looked up, his eyes travelling over Harry’s sweaty body. Harry wanted to step away, hide from his gaze. Instead of the nose wrinkle he was expecting though, a delicate pink flushed Malfoy’s cheeks.
Harry groaned. “Not you, too. Everyone always needs to piss when they’re stuck to me. It’s like the bloody bond makes their bladders full. Piss, piss, piss.”
At the name Malfoy, the man’s head shot up, but he didn’t say anything. After a beat, he extended his hand. "I am Guillaume."
Potter’s life in the woods was built, it turned out, on a series of routines. He collected water every day, tended a small vegetable garden, touched a series of trees for his own wild-tree-man reasons, read about trees and plants, made the odd potion (including, to Draco’s relief, one that helped with his pain), napped when it was hot, and also bathed to keep cool.
“I know,” said Percy, looking smug. “I was at the Yule Ball the other day, and I saw Harry dancing with a tall blonde.”
“It’s… it’s complicated. I’ve gone from working all the time to… not. I don’t really know what to do with myself.”
Kreacher had bowed near to the floor: far lower than any emancipated house-elf would. “For some reason, I don’t think that
The tall beech tree around which Harry normally slept did not seemed to have missed him. As Draco approached it, he noticed a gleam of silver; a tiny thread of white so white it shone like the moon.
“Harry,” Molly greeted him warmly at the door. She smiled at Draco, too, but it was a little tighter around the mouth. “Draco.”
"No," said Harry. "But it seems that I'm safe as long as Malfoy's there, because his mother's a Black. He thinks it's something to do with the wards, and he's going to see what he can do with them tomorrow. He might fix it then. If it doesn't work out though, he's going to stay and keep on at it. And if he's there it means that I can go home."
wouldn’t last the day at work; clay wouldn’t stand a chance. “I’m not really a ‘hands on’ type of person,” he said after a quick moment of consideration.
Harry nodded, and then Malfoy reached forward and they were kissing. Malfoy’s lips had been softer than Harry had imagined. He could feel it now, watching the memory; the warmth that had spread inside him, the desire to kiss and kiss and never stop.
“He’s never complained before.” Harry didn’t like having attention drawn to him, on the field or in the office. He didn’t like it anywhere, but given that everyone had known who he was before he even did, he didn’t have much choice about it. In the wizarding world, anyway.
In the assembled students, Harry noticed other pairs kissing. Anthony and Lisa were no surprise, but Blaise and Ginny were. Harry smiled at them: Ginny was glowing and Blaise looked very pleased with himself.
He stepped back, and closed his eyes. He could feel the weight of his feet on the ground, feel the way his chest moved with his breathing. He could feel the warmth at the centre of himself, and the tingling energy of his finger tips. Deeper inside he could feel the old sadnesses of his childhoods, and the bright warmth of his friendships at Hogwarts, magic threaded like a line of silver throughout. And there, nestled in all of that, a jewel-bright glow that was how he felt about Draco.
Harry, Ron and Hermione were sitting at their favourite table in the library, trying to research their Charms homework.
The horror Draco felt at the thought of some Ministry Neanderthal attempting to dismantle a Snitch must have showed, because Potter winced. Salazar, he could imagine the mess of cogs and wheels they must have made. And they probably didn’t have any more of a clue about what they were looking at than before they’d opened the Snitch.
Draco nodded, then watched Potter limp off to the end of the street before he turned to walk the rest of the way home himself.
Harry looks up. Malfoy has turned to the next page, as if there has been no breathing in of scents or urges to touch. The words on the page aren't making sense though: they seem to Harry to be a jumble of letters. He blinks, and tries to refocus his eyes, but before he can find any meaning in the words, Malfoy has turned a page again. Malfoy is reading too fast, and the panic about the essay returns. Harry needs this mark; he has to pass Potions.
Granger nodded slowly, her eyes searching his face. “I’m trying– I want to understand your curse. I need to be absolutely clear on this: is there any chance that you and Harry would ever… you know… sleep together?”
Malfoy began to move again, his feet tracing a slow line towards Harry. Hairs rose on the back of Harry's neck at the sight of Malfoy, the predatory smile still on his face.
He wrote a few more sentences on his parchment, barely paying any attention to the words. Ink splattered and the nib of his quill broke, and Harry swore. Stupid Draco. He stared at the mess of his work, and pushed it away, suspecting that any attempt to fix it would only make it worse. Instead, he looked over at the Pensieve.
“Yes. I bumped into Hermione the other day, and she mentioned that she was staying here with Ron. Bet his mother’s scandalized, isn’t she? She’s a bit old fashioned, but then she’s had so many children already you’d think she would be used to it. Wasn’t Ron’s older brother—”
Draco fell back, just in time as Pansy stepped out of the fireplace. She filled the room with a subtle floral scent, an enormous fluffy mint-green dressing gown loosely belted at the waist. Beneath it her pyjamas were covered with hundreds of tiny twinkling stars. When she saw him looking, Pansy pulled the dressing gown tight.
When sun had reached its highest point in the sky and Draco’s collar was damp with sweat, they flew down to a clearing in a forest. Fresh bright leaves adorned the trees, and yellow buttercups dotted the grass beneath their feet. A fallen tree lay on the ground, grass growing from the earth still trapped between its upturned roots.
“You don’t get to ask questions. I ask questions.” Malfoy’s words slowed, spat out deliberately as though Harry were a stupid child. “What are you doing in my living room?
His fingers move slightly, as they remember— Harry almost stops breathing. Not Ginny. They remember Malfoy's hot skin beneath his when they both reached for the book, the hard ridges of fingers. The way his body was firm beneath Harry when they had last fought, in a tumble of limbs and punches between the tables in the Great Hall. In the strangled silence that follows, in the quiet of the library, Harry can hear Malfoy breathing. It sounds measured, as if Malfoy is calm. Or trying to stay calm.
“Millicent had a letter from her mum yesterday,” Hermione said. “I think her mum’s upset with her.” She watched Padma and Millicent, a thoughtful look on her face. “It’s strange,” she said. “I’m friends with Ginny and Luna, but I’ve never been really close to the girls I share with - sorry, Parvati, that sounds terrible.”
. "Or maybe I'm just blindly optimistic," he said, and he stood and took two steps forward before he could change his mind. He reached out, touching Malfoy on the cheek, moving his hand to grasp the edge of his jaw. Malfoy's skin was warm, and Harry could feel the sharp fuzz of the finest layer of stubble beneath his fingertips. Harry moved closer still.
How Draco didn’t come right then, he didn’t know. Instead though, he groaned and pulled Harry, finally, toward the bedroom.
A slight chill cooled the night air. Summer was everywhere, but it was also starting its languid draw to a close, Harry realised; all of a sudden time seemed to lurch. For a while everything had felt the same, and Harry had almost thought that summer would continue indefinitely, sunshine and rainy days intertwined into a single, endless, backdrop for how he’d been feeling.
Draco eyed the bread suspiciously. It hadn’t been wrapped in anything, and he didn’t know what else Henry was carrying in that bag. He hadn’t been given any evidence so far that Henry was capable of doing anything with much success: if he had been able to cope with life, surely he wouldn’t be singing for money and living in rags?
As the sun began to sink towards the horizon, they swept low over a grand house, all pale stone walls and elegant window. The stone glowed golden in the setting sun.
Understanding dawned on Draco. He remembered Henry pointing down to Minplebury Hall, and his own frustration at discovering that it belonged to Thrushbeard. “No. This is all yours, isn’t it?”
"A large part of your kitchen floor falling away was an accident?" she said, fixing him with a sceptical look as she cast a couple of
It only took Harry the space of a breath to make his mind up. “You can stay here,” he said. He thought of the owls currently swooping through the attic rooms. “We’ve run out of bedrooms, though.”
Harry was aware of how intensely Malfoy was looking at him. His heart sped up as he was reminded, all of a sudden, of Malfoy looking at him across the room at the party. Except now they were sitting, cross-legged on the floor and close enough that they could touch. His wand trembled in his hand for a moment as he held it up, ready to cast the first part of the Protean Charm.
“So you’ve been cursed by a witch or wizard with a grudge and some knowledge of the Dark Arts;” Granger said, counting off the first point on her fingers. “The curse cast a blue light and has left you seeing visions of the future – your own and others – that you can’t verify as true, but which so far seem unlikely; you are reluctant to see help through official channels due to the nature of some of your visions. Basically you want to identify the curse and thereby also its counter-curse, correct?”
Draco rolled his eyes. “I went to three places and looked at hundreds of trees. You would have bought the first one you saw.”
Although Draco was used to being watched and measured against a complex list of rules, he didn’t feel like he did when his father regarded him with disapproval in his eyes. Instead he was reminded, somehow, of his Hogwarts days, and the feeling he’d had that although he was alone, someone out there was following his actions. At the time he’d assumed it was Dumbledore or Snape, but now he wasn’t so sure. Maybe it had been the castle itself: watching, quiet and passive as he’d slowly dug himself deeper and deeper into a mire of frustration and failure.
“Your friend?” Malfoy said. “Is that what we’re doing here?” Harry wanted to see him smile. He wanted to see that worried look disappear.
He staggered back, releasing his hand from the contact with the wood. The edges of the world came back into his vision, but the heartache remained. Draco could barely breathe with the pain of it.
When he got back, Malfoy was sitting up in bed, reading. He didn’t look up when Harry came in, and Harry put his clothes down, then slid into bed. Malfoy turned a page, and didn’t look up. Harry lay back and thought again how strange it was that he and Malfoy were in bed together. In all his years at Hogwarts, he’d never imagined this a possibility.
“Whatever these cards say,” Harry said to Felix, “it isn’t a lie, the time I’ve spent with Draco. None of this makes sense, but it will do. I’ll make sure it does.” He rubbed between Felix’s shoulder blades. “I just hope it’s not… I hope it doesn’t change things.” The last words came out tight and pained.
Together they kicked the shorts off and away. Draco was aware of leaves all around them, of a cool dampness that came from the earth itself but that could not quench the heat he felt. And then came the ball-aching relief of cock touching cock, of heat meeting heat. Potter brought his hands to Draco’s, and held him down as he kissed him deeply. A groaning growl came of out Draco, as he rutted up against Potter.
Even though it was a Saturday, two people were at work in the room at the back that housed a mix of Muggle and magical research items, in a clinical version of a potions lab.
“Yes; you’re right. I— When I’m with all those people, I’m always out of step with them. And… I’m tired of feeling that I don’t belong.”
The first thing Draco noticed when he opened his eyes was that he was definitely not in his bed at home. A sky like ink was filled with hundreds of pricks of light; he could see the wash of the Milky Way, and the crescent of the moon hung at the edge of his vision.
"You can drop the shield now," said Malfoy. He looked up at Harry, his grey eyes wide. "Thank you," Malfoy said, his voice quiet. Just for Harry.
Sacrifices? His father was delusional. Draco opened his mouth to speak, but then thought better of it. His father, he had long ago learned, was not a man to reason with.
"More tea?" he said. "Or cake?" he added, gesturing towards the cake stand. Severus scowled, but helped himself to a chocolate brownie, and peace was restored.
“It’s not about the money.” That was only a small lie: Draco did need to get paid, but mainly he always felt… incomplete until his latest order of Snitches was finished. “I’ve got to maintain my professional reputation: I don’t want to be late with this order.”
“I won’t mention it to her. But I mean that… well, you don’t need to ask my permission if you do want to ask her out, or whatever.” Harry paused. “As long as you don’t hurt her of course.”
When their eyes met again, Malfoy’s eyes were wary, although that dangerous gleam was still there. It was as though Malfoy was shouting a challenge at him, but was scared of what Harry might do.
Most people were unaware of the mechanical, almost Muggle nature of a Snitch. Or rather, that although they were charmed, no magic was used in their construction: each was made with love and care, piece by piece, and all by hand. Perhaps this discovery had been the one that had made Draco want to be a Snitch-maker. He was drawn to this world of purring gears and molten metal, of precious gold stretched thin and worked until it could fly, free and high.
Draco resisted the urge to roll his eyes. An unsolicited reassurance – that ‘honestly’ – was never good news. He refocused on the pertinent details. "If he comes to London surely it would be easier to see him here."
Draco grabbed Potter’s arm before he could finish. A smile wasn’t the only thing that Abraxas shared with Lucius.
“That’s right. All we have are the names of the portraits we’d like to talk to: Mildred, Penny and Frank. Um…” he paused, brow furrowed. “Frank likes to play cards.” He turned to Draco. “That’s all we know, right?”
“I wish Charlie could be here,” Molly said. “But they’ve a dragon about to hatch and he can’t get away. And Bill and Fleur are with her parents; I want all my children around me at Christmas. That includes, you, too, Harry.” She added. “You’re family, too.”
Draco returned the Transfigured stones and leaves to their original forms, and bowed low to the tree.
"I don’t care what you say about the trees, your wandless magic is also a bit of a turn on," Draco said. "Do you really use it to…"
There was a reason Harry had Sorted into Gryffindor, all those years back. The thought, as soon as it entered his mind, turned to action, and he brought his hand between them to feel where Draco’s cock was straining beneath him. It felt glorious, to feel Draco’s cock: swollen, hot, and constrained under his trousers.
“You’re not getting any sympathy from me.” Ron leant back in his chair. “Some of us are sensible enough to Floo in, without bothering to walk through thunder and lightning to get here.”
“Yes, I know. Ron reminds me every five minutes. I– I don’t know. He’s not a killer, I know that—“, Harry’s eyes met Hermione’s, pleading with her to understand. It was just all so
"I need more than space," he whispers. His hand finds Draco's and squeezes. Their fingers find a way to link together, and Draco holds on. Suddenly he understands that although the words are still hard to find, perhaps he is not as empty as he thought. He squeezes back.
Harry could almost see Hermione bristling in response to the assumption, but she replied in perfectly cool tones. “Actually, Molly, now I’ve perfected the art, I don’t think I’ll bother again.” Hermione said. “It was the challenge I enjoyed the most; actual cooking bores me.“ Inwardly Harry winced at Hermione’s words, but he knew that cooking had been a bit of a sore point between Hermione and Molly in the past.
Ron smiled. “I don’t think you’ve got the monopoly on being the moody one. And if there’s one reason to like you being with Draco, it’s because I feel like I’ve got my friend back. Plus it’s great to see you finally kicking a bit of arse on training.” Harry smiled back, happy to be feeling at ease with Ron again, and with his training, of course.
"I…" Draco touched the place on his knee where Potter’s hand had been. He could still feel Potter’s touch.
A cold feeling of panic drove Harry’s next question. “Did I sleep with you?” He wasn’t sure whether it was the thought that he might have slept with Draco, or the worry that he could have forgotten such a thing that drove the fluttering, leaping sense of dread. He thought again of skin and parchment, and tapping fingers and knowing grins and a felt a pang of… loss? Regret? He wasn’t sure.
“Come on, you’re the hero of the wizarding world. What’s one measly little bit of Transfiguration to you?”
“What are you two losers talking about then?” Anthony asked. “Only joking!” he said, when he saw the look on Harry’s face, and ruffling Harry’s hair as though to prove it.
Draco didn’t need telling twice. His feet ached after standing for hours, and the insistent heat didn’t help, either. The water was shockingly cool against his skin, and he wiggled his toes in pleasure.
“At the moon? Oh, I say,” Arthur said. He stared at Draco, then at Harry. “And whose idea was that?”
“So why did you do it?” Hestia’s eyes narrowed slightly as she leant forward. They were stood over a smoking crater in the ground, amongst the trees. Harry could see that it didn’t exactly look good that he’d just shot a fireball at the ‘suspect’ he and Draco had been tracking.
They swirled around the ballroom, although Harry was no longer aware of the people around them, and only heard the music as a faint one-two-three that guided their movements. “I—”
By the time Harry had also eaten a chilli hot enough to make his eyes water, a piece of what appeared to be Christmas cake, and a boiled egg which, when he looked at the half remaining, was green inside, he had also found out that Luna didn’t know that much more. She seemed to be focusing on eliminating possibilities, which he knew was good methodology, but was also quite slow. He made a mental note not to eat her culinary efforts again, although he did appreciate her thoughtfulness in bringing him lunch.
“I am running a test, Harry,” Luna said, but her words failed to reassure him. He’d got stuck to a witch called Linda on the way back from lunch with Ron, and Luna and Linda were now deep in conversation about Jobberknolls. Linda, it turned out, was an amateur naturalist, too.
She shook her head again. “In a few weeks you will no longer be my concern.” She paused. “For the rest of term, should the room be judged safe, and you unharmed, then I think you can keep using it. And once you are no longer students here, if you want to visit this space maybe we can arrange something.” She sighed. “Although for Merlin’s sake, no more sneaking around. If you want to return here after you leave Hogwarts, you are to ask my permission, understood?”
His stomach was calmer; instead he was left with a shaky sense of relief and the glimmer of hope that maybe this would be OK, after all.
“I hope you don’t mind me interrupting, I know that you’re busy. But I thought that rather than Flooing I could pop by, fill you in on what happened this morning.”
“I didn’t think I was going to live past my eighteenth birthday,” Harry said. “I didn’t think I’d be able to end up with anyone. I certainly didn’t think I’d be hiding away in the Room of Requirement, making out with you.”
“Ye-es,” Harry said, looking between the two of them. Hermione was picking at a worn patch on the sofa’s arm.
"It has done, but it’s been getting better." It probably didn’t help that Draco had been pushing it with all the fucking he and Harry had been doing, but he wasn’t going to say that to Millicent.
"Let's just leave it," said Harry. "Anyway, I have news: I'm moving back to Grimmauld Place tomorrow."
Potter Firecalled that night. “I’ve arranged to visit the Appleby Arrows and the Montrose Magpies tomorrow. I want to find out if the balls were replaced.”
Draco tried hard not to think about Borgin and Burkes, or how desperately out of place he had been even as he thought he’d known it all. “I don’t have any of those sort of contacts, but I can make a few quiet inquiries in the Muggle world. There are always those happy not to know the exact provenance of the items they’re selling.”
Few a few delicious minutes, he lay in bed savouring the feeling of being in a fresh space. Harry stretched out. The night before he’d left the curtains and window open, wanting to see the sky as he fell asleep. The sounds of the city filled the room: birds chirruping, the drone of a plane, cars swishing by, voices from another open window. Although all the gardens here were small, there were enough trees dotted among them that he saw green leaves when he finally got out of bed to look at the view; this made Harry happy. Grimmauld Place backed onto more sedate gardens, hard spaces for people to ignore or to entertain in. This mess of washing lines, tall thin sheds, rangy trees, walls and fences had more heart, he felt.
Dudley’s room, it turned out, was the small one at the back of the house above the kitchen. A flat roof jutted out under his window, the modern extension that housed the bathroom. According to Dudley it made it possible for Felix to come in and out of the bedroom window, if Harry didn’t mind. He then muttered something about not letting Dick know. Harry was beginning to think that this Dick person sounded like a bit of a… well a dick.
“No.” They walked past the chickens and goats, none of which looked particularly in the mood for petting. “I mainly send the Snitches to Quidditch gaming suppliers. They put together complete kits then sell those on.”
The cabin was exactly as Draco remembered it, but then it had been less than ten days since he’d left. A soft early-morning light now bathed the clearing, and it looked the same yet also unreal, like a dream. It was as though Draco had walked into a memory.
“Sorry,” she said. “I know you don’t like to talk about it. I guess that’s it: old wounds, and the like.”
Was that outcrop there the part of the reclining face that had looked like a nose? Draco wasn’t sure. He tried again, to feel that almost-sense of the trees themselves, but it wasn’t there any more. Why had he thought he’d be able to feel it? The whole point of him being up this tree in the middle of nowhere was that he needed to learn this somehow. Guillaume had been so bloody confident that Draco would be able to find his answers here, but all he had found so far were trees, rocks, and more trees. A slight stinging sensation made Draco grimace: and mosquitoes, apparently. Without thinking, he swatted the side of his neck.
Draco flicked open the catches holding the Snitches in the box, and watched as they sprang to life. Wings unfurled, they darted around the room. Like small golden birds, they filled the air.
“I… I don’t know what I need. I want to be able to relax, but… everywhere I go I see how things were, how things have changed.” He stared into the dying fire. “Who’s not here,” he added quietly.
Harry didn’t know if he agreed with that sentiment. Malfoy always seemed different in bed. More real, somehow, less concerned about what it said in the bloody
“I know.” Draco sighed. Harry wasn’t sure that it was going to work, talking to Draco without the enforced time together.
“Don’t worry, Potty. Hermione’s been telling me about her research, and I’ve been telling her what I know about house-elves.”
Deeply satisfied at the knowledge that Harry was already coming undone, Draco gave him an approving pat on the leg. "You’re almost ready," Draco said.
Malfoy nodded, and then it was his turn to roll his eyes. “Well, go on then, I won’t know unless you actually tell me.”
Hermione picked up the box and read out the instructions. Everyone interrupted at least once to ask a question, and by the time Hermione had finished she looked as though she wouldn’t mind throwing the box across the room.
, of course. But he could see how that confidence could be… attractive. Remembering all of Potter’s conquests put things in perspective. The
Malfoy stayed silent. Harry waited, and reflected on how strange it was that it had it come to this, to him being the one trying to persuade Malfoy to give him a chance. He looked around the room, his eyes settling on the floor under the windows. The lantern-light reflected in patches from the dark, and it took Harry a moment to puzzle out why. There were puddles beneath the window, muddied with ash. No wonder it was so cold: the glass had blown out or melted, rain and the cold night air flowed straight in through twisted metal frames.
“You’ll be washing dishes, Mr Malfoy,” he was informed. “Mr Singer requested that you had a non-public facing job, and this was the only vacancy for someone of your… qualifications.”
“My charms… but… how? I need to…” Draco muttered to himself as he looked at the match photos again. He prided himself on making perfect Snitches, and took it as a personal affront that anyone would, or could, have tampered with them. Finally he looked back up at Potter again. “I need more time, to think about how this might have been done. And besides, I need to keep to my work schedule,” he looked down at the floor, thinking of the workshop below. “Can I owl you when I’ve got more information?”
Draco began to laugh, because of course his leg felt like a tree. Greg and Millicent stared at him, and Draco realised his laughter was perilously close to becoming tears. He put his head in his hands, calming himself without having to see their faces.
Neville puffed his chest out and deepened his voice. “There is dark, there is light. We stand between the two, casting long shadows—”
"Friday. She’s bringing a Portkey, for you. Ron’s coming too." Potter swallowed, and a mix of feelings played out on his face. "They’re bringing the tent."
Harry nodded without looking up. He didn’t know what to say to Draco. The only thing he really knew, was that this was a horrible mess now. He didn’t know how they could go back to how things had been.
Ernie and Anthony batted back and forward about Quidditch for a while, with Harry only having to pipe up occasionally, and Draco not at all. Anthony sitting down had pushed them closer together, and Harry could feel how Draco’s whole body had stiffened up while the others talked. Harry gave what he hoped was a reassuring nudge to Draco’s leg with his own, and saw Draco shoot him a small grateful smile. But he didn’t relax at all.
Harry was about to stick his tongue out at her, when there was a rattle at the window. It wasn’t one of the attic owls, and Harry let it in. His heart sank before he’d even unfolded the parchment it carried; he recognised the Ministry seal. Opening it he saw that Kingsley wanted him to come in for a ‘little chat’.
“Home…?” Draco faltered. The place looked one storm away from being a ruin, with lichen growing on the stones and patch-jobs of different sized and coloured stone visible along its walls. It was also tiny: he could see only two windows and a door. No upstairs.
– naked before him. If there was no history, if they were strangers? Maybe. But then he remembered being humiliated by a Hippogriff, losing countless games of Quidditch, and the sharp pain and spin into unconsciousness in Myrtle’s bathroom. He remembered his father’s decline into madness, and the way Lucius would spit out the name
idiotic boy. And I think Draco is yours. And to be honest, you are being so thick-skulled about this I rather think that you’re matched on the idiotic front, too.”
“It seemed safer, somehow. I’m sure you’re not in the habit of knocking before you enter your own bedroom.”
"Oh," said Harry, somewhat breathlessly. "Well if you feel like that..." He summoned a vial of oil from beside the bed and sat up, before gently pushing Malfoy's legs up so his knees moved towards his chest then out.
“This room is all burned out, but the corridor shows no sign of fire at all. I’ve been outside, looked at the castle walls - I got a broom and flew up one day - and there’s no sign of fire anywhere. I couldn’t even see the windows.”
“Snape’s right, you are a sentimental fool,” Draco said, although there was no denying the warm glow even faint praise brought. Potter merely gave him a serene smile, and settled into the chair by the desk, turning it first to face Snape.
The door to the cupboard under the stairs in this house looked much like the one at Privet Drive. As he left the kitchen, Harry came to a stop and stood before it, his pulse fluttering. He hadn’t seen one like this for years, and it brought the old feelings back more powerfully than he’d thought possible. He felt again, the way the dark, cramped space had been both safety and a source of fear, how all the noises the night could make had kept him awake. He remembered his few hidden treasures, broken toys and a few crayons he’d taken home from school. He remembered slipping them in his pocket, unnoticed as he seemed invisible to most people. His teachers included.
Harry didn’t like the feeling he got when he cooled down in sweaty clothes, and watching TV without being next to Malfoy would be pointless, really. “I’ll be quick,” he said. “Really quick.”
They work through the day, and take on extra tasks when they finish early again. Moving, sweating in the sun, grounds Draco more than anything else could. He feels connected to the earth below his feet, to the air brushing his skin, and the stones they are slowly bringing back together. This place was once home, and it does him good to see it become whole again. He tries not to think of his other home, empty and scarred in its own way.
For all Harry’s talk of tree magic and dildos, Draco suspected that the truth was that it had been a long time since Harry had slept with anyone. Harry had obviously been with men at some point, because he wasn’t totally clueless, but Draco wasn’t sure whether he’d bottomed before. A dildo was one thing, sex with another human could be quite something else.
"Thanks," he whispered. Neither of them moved. He moved his thumb again, a slow and deliberate swipe, and he watched Malfoy's breath catch.
“Harry!” George was with Ginny, and Veronica. He let go of Veronica - causing her little penguin earrings to sway from side to side - and pulled Harry into a quick hug. “I’m so glad you could make it.”
Harry looked up. Greg was standing above him with a tray of drinks. It was beyond Harry to utter much beyond a garbled word that could have been ‘Yes’. Or ‘No’. He stood, pushing the table back as he did so, his butterbeer spilling on the table. “Air… need air,” he managed to say, before staggering towards the nearest door.
Malfoy smiled, his facing warming slightly as he did so. “I enjoy the feeling of… order when making a potion.” He looked around him. “Control.” Bertie mirrored his movements.
“It’s strange being here, but not being at Hogwarts,” George said. “When we were living above the shop it took up so much of our time. We were serious about making it a successful business, but at the same time we had fun. It was all about having fun.” A sad smile didn’t quite meet his eyes. “So now I’m here, where it’s quieter, and finding a new way to be me. A new way to run the business.”
Harry nodded, a low arc of his head, his gaze never leaving Draco. “You were so young. We both were.”
The experience of sitting with Harry and his friends was different to anything Draco had experienced with them before. He felt so crowded by the unfamiliarity of it that after they’d drunk their tea, he told Harry that he’d go and check on the vegetables after all.
She handed over some money to Nicky, and came over to the stall. Draco moved behind the table, and talked her into a blue tablecloth covered in tiny pink flowers. She didn’t buy a basket, but the next person did. Draco flirted, laughed and joked his way into a steady stream of sales. No one seemed to look at the baskets for that long: they seemed more interested in talking to Draco. One person even asked him out for a coffee, but Draco said no.
Draco’s head shot up from where he was organising their small snack selection. Harry kept bringing things up to the room, and Draco would fuss about crumbs but still take the slice of cake or piece of chocolate. As Draco had ventured into Hogsmeade at the weekend, this time he’d also added to their collection with some of his favourites.
When Harry awoke on Saturday morning, he found Draco asleep beside him, his soft and regular breathing filling the room. Draco was warm and Harry felt something loosen deep within, a tension he was never aware of until Draco was home again. Memories and dreams had haunted him gently all night – the brush of fingers over skin, shy smiles; a nameless longing. Harry sat up and watched Draco sleep as he sorted through his sense of then and now. The present felt empty in comparison, but at least Draco was home now, and wasn't on nights again for a while.
“Witt Doddridge at St Mungo’s has good things to say about you,” Odwolfe said. “Your work on magical fields informs one part of our research.”
"Sev– Snape," said Harry. His friends understood why he'd reached out, but didn't really get it, the connection he felt to their former Potions teacher.
me," said Malfoy. His voice sounded... huskier than normal. He turned to stare at Harry "You—" he stopped, and suddenly he
“I didn’t—” Potter stopped and smiled a little sheepishly. “Actually, I was about to. It’s so delicate. Pretty, almost.”
But now he had lived enough of a life since the war that he could also have anxiety dreams about completing reports on time, or getting lost in the archives room. Some dreams made him happy – the one he had woken from had been of the Great Hall at Hogwarts, ready for Christmas. Lights twinkled, mulled wine flowed, and the tables were heaped with mince pies and turkey and shiny red Christmas crackers.
Inspiration hit Harry. “A drink! How about a drink at the Leaky?” Malfoy hesitated, then smiled and nodded. As they turned away from the Floos, heading instead for the exit to the street nearest Diagon Alley, Harry paused. “Didn’t you need to get something?”
“I know,” Harry said, so quietly it was almost a whisper. He’d never thought he was someone who could use his wand with so much hate. Or that he could hurt someone like that, even if he hadn’t known what the spell did. The fact he’d tried it without knowing still filled him with a kind of silent terror; there had been so much blood. “I don’t blame you.”
Potter’s reply came as Draco was sitting on chair balancing on the cobbles outside. The mist had lifted, and this day had dawned bright and clear. The fading days of summer deserved to be enjoyed before the long stretch of autumn and winter began, and Draco enjoyed watching the world go by.
"Not Pansy!" said Malfoy. "I meant—" he stopped as Harry pulled away from him. No matter how good it felt with the arm around his side and Malfoy's firm body pressed close, Harry needed to see his face. As he moved away, Malfoy seemed to understand and he shifted his position too, until they could see each other.
Draco nodded, grateful for a neutral topic of conversation. He could see now that his life was going to be an endless series of conversations about the weather, shared over boring meals that were the same each day. “I’m sure it will be very popular.”
Hermione was easy to spot, as she was practically bouncing with excitement. She cast the Muffliato before Draco had even sat down.
When they made their way back to the fire just as slowly and painfully as before, they both said nothing. Draco wrapped himself in his blanket again, turned his head away from Potter, and closed his eyes. For the second time that day he wished for sleep, but this time it did not come as swiftly. He hoped though, that lying like this would be enough for Potter to leave him alone. For a long time he listened to the fire, the insects of the night, and the occasional rustle of movement from the other side of the fire. He thought of old conversations, long ago, about death and feeling lost. And then he remembered the sting of being forgotten. When he did drop off, it was with tears in his eyes for being trapped in this place with this man, of all men.
Robards had come in to give them a lecture. It was supposed to be a special event, having the Head Auror come in. Something to keep them going, halfway through their first year of training. So far though, it had been long-winded, and more than a little patronising.
"That’s what the part at the beginning was about." Potter paused, and gave Draco a sideways look. "You have to offer them something. Something honest, something true."
The words escaped Draco before he could stop them, but part of him was glad. Some part of him had been waiting years to say them.
“I learned the hard way not to look down on anyone because of the blood running through their veins, or their family or the way they looked.”
“I hope you’ve got some proper security in place on your Floo connection,” the duck-named Auror said, her head floating in the green flames.
Harry leant into Malfoy's shoulder, the bunched up robes between them giving everything a heated, trapped feel. Harry began to move his hand, revelling in the feeling of mutual pleasure as Malfoy matched his actions. He breathed in the faint smell of coffee, as hot, damp skin pressed to his face. They fell into a matching rhythm, and it had been so long since anyone had touched him like this: to be honest, it had never been quite like this. It was hot and urgent, and the room was peppered with the sound of half-swallowed moans and murmurs. Under it all was the knowledge that nothing, nothing at all, could stop them now. Every look and word and touch over the past few weeks had been leading to this moment, and Harry felt it wash over him, the rightness of being tangled together like this.
After making another cup of tea, Harry headed down to the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office. He knocked on the door, and it was answered by a very short witch with wispy black hair. Vague memories of seeing Draco talk to her came to mind, but no name.
“Did Voldemort use the right spoon to eat soup?” Harry couldn’t help but ask. “Because I hardly think that was the most relevant fact about him.”
Draco smoothed his clothes and cape, and checked his hair in the mirror. “I’m not looking forward to this.” He slid his wand into his sleeve. “It has to be done, though.”
Draco tried to move his leg, but a sharp pain added to the pulsating throb and he stopped. With a grunt he lifted his head to look at it, but he let his head drop down immediately as his stomach lurched at the sight of his leg at what was not a normal angle. Fuck. He’d broken his leg in the middle of trees and rocks… his wand. He needed his wand. With another grunt – more moan than grunt – he heaved himself up to find his wand. It wasn’t in his pocket… he saw it to one side. Too far to reach.
He paused, aware of a rattling sound coming from somewhere above him. Carefully Harry lowered the shopping bags, and waited for the plastic to cease rustling so that he could listen properly.
As he tried the thoughts out, nothing awful leapt out at him. His breath sped up a little and his chest grew tighter, but more out of excitement than fear.
“I think that we should start again.” He held out his hand. “I’m Harry, and I’d really like to take you out to dinner some time.”
“You weren’t friendly to him, either. Nor to any of us in Slytherin,” Millicent reminded him gently.
“Yes, it bloody was.” Now it was Harry’s turn to be angry. “I was getting there on my own, I didn’t need your help. Besides, what’s the point? I might have a crush on my housemate, but what use does that do me when it’s not going to go anywhere?
“It connects a group of objects, Charms them to change for a purpose. And it’s the act of making identical objects that means we are learning this part in your class, Professor. Changing the objects after this is more Charms-based.”
“I would…” George sighed. “I’d have to deal with it, wouldn’t I? Because when it comes down to it, what can make me happy now includes my family being happy.” He reached over to tousle Harry’s hair. “All my family.”
There was nothing therapeutic about washing dishes on this scale. The plates were never ending, and great clouds of steam threatened to scald him if he had the job of loading and unloading the industrial dishwasher. The water was always scalding hot. And the pans! Everything was baked on and his arms ached at the end of each day. The skin on his hands was dry and cracking from spending so much time in water. His hand creams helped a little, and he had curried much favour by gifting Amy and Kate with their own jars, but in the face of so much washing up it was essentially a losing battle. If only they had a few house-elves, none of this would be necessary. But no, they didn’t.
“And I know you’re not her keeper. Only… you vaporised the scariest, most murderous wizard of our age. You do understand why I might be… nervous, right?”
"Sometimes," said Millicent, "I want to get up and shake you until you get some perspective." She pushed the glass of wine closer. "It’s never been clear what you think of your apprenticeship. Merlin, Draco, you can be infuriating." He heard the steel in her voice, and had no problem picturing her striding across the room to give him a vigorous shake. Since she’d trained as a Healer she’d lost any last scraps of patience she might have had with what she perceived to be time-wasting or moping. "This isn’t your last chance, whatever you think."
Harry thought about the room they had visited that morning: it was just as run-down as any of the others, with a faded rug on the floor and torn paper on the walls.
you have?” Malfoy’s mouth twisted with curiosity. “The others talk as though there’s half a dozen upstairs!”
It wasn’t too difficult to get his own breakfast, and Harry read his letter while the kettle boiled. He smiled as he read, because it was from Ron, and Ron’s owls were always the same. This one was no exception: short and to the point, but also covered in food and coffee rings. Harry guessed that he and Hermione had eaten marmalade with their toast, judging by the sticky orange smudge smeared down one side of the parchment. The invite for a visit to Diagon was also appreciated, as was the offer to share the bonding between his two friends.
