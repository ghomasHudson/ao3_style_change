He visibly struggled to hold in his rage at this tiny slip of a witch with calculating eyes. The young witch sent by the Minister himself. At last Blakely gave a curt nod and pressed his lips together. Satisfied for the time being, Granger started walking again.
For three seconds, Draco’s throat completely closed up. A prickling cascaded over his cheekbones and he drew in a deep breath to stave off his anxiety while he raced through his options. If Potter knew… Did that mean his paperwork was actually moving through the system? “I see you’ve done your research,” Draco said carefully.
Harry hugged Draco’s waist and he nibbled lightly at the nape of Draco’s neck. “Mm, you still smell sweet and your skin is…” He dragged his lips back and forth against bare skin. “Mm, just so soft.”
Sitting on the bench next to Harry, Draco reached for the teapot to pour them each a cup. “Mm, Bacon and Eggs?”
Seconds later, the crack of Apparition sounded. “Malfoy,” Potter said, his scanning eyes quickly settling on Draco.
Hopefully the suite would be suitable for the family until Leila’s parents felt healed and settled enough to find employment and a place of their own. Pansy had feelers out for potential jobs, depending on their mental health after a year of Azkaban. The dementors had fled but that didn’t mean the prison had improved in any way.
“It was sweet,” Harry agreed, winking at Draco. Draco returned the wink and then went back to his textbooks while Harry finished reading. Of course Annabelle and Charles had a little boy, a tiny mini-duke to continue running the empire. He hoped the other books were better. And sexier.
Over time, Draco urged Harry to move the sofa this way, and add a shelf here. He brought artwork he thought Harry might enjoy, and knick-knacks and photos to remind him of dates they’d shared. Anything he could to make Harry’s flat a real home. Until finally Harry asked him to move in permanently.
Annie leaned back against Draco and the ice cream melting over her hand dripped onto his lap. She nodded, then turned her back on Potter to snuggle in deeper against Draco, smearing his shirt with ice cream.
“Probably half an hour or so. I’ve never taken it, but I’ve heard it makes you a little light-headed so we should definitely be sitting in a comfortable spot.”
Turning, Draco stuck his tongue out at Potter, then joined the others. Annie climbed into his lap with her face alight. “Did you get sprinkles on mine?”
Sorry this posted late - I managed to forget that yesterday was Sunday during a "Community" marathon with my kids. Cool, cool, cool.
Especially since this one square opened his mind to a possibility he hadn’t had time to explore in the months and years before the war. Free of the horcrux and the influence of Voldemort in his soul and mind, Harry’s thoughts coalesced into a new shape. His blood hummed with this change, but he didn’t know where or how to explore it.
Harry set the popcorn bowl on the coffee table and laid them both lengthwise on the sofa. “Well, I either need to run laps around the back garden or ride you like an unbroken abraxan.”
Gretchen and Lizzie eagerly dragged Harry to the newly furnished school rooms. Libby and Chester joined them at a tiny table with tiny chairs, and all four spoke over one another to tell Harry the plans to start school after the weekend.
“Just in case my editor will allow it, I drew you as a dragon as well.” Harry flipped back a few pages. “Look, here he is sneezing.” The round, green dragon with blunted scales down his back had his face scrunched up and tiny tendrils of smoke and fire coming out of his nose.
Before anyone could object, Draco smoothly changed the subject. “I loved that older post with Molly at the beach! The sandcastles and the waves. Her adorable animal friends.” He patted Harry’s thigh from just far enough away that everyone could see where his hand had landed, even though it was below the table. “You’re very talented. I wish I had any kind of drawing skill.”
It ended up taking Hermione thirty minutes because she also picked up some Chinese food for them to share. They were all well versed in hospital-speak where ‘discharged in an hour’ usually meant ‘discharged in three hours.’
As he got the hang of it, Draco’s hands tangled in the sheets to keep himself still against the pleasurable tingling all over his chest. Harry paused above the button of Draco’s trousers. Draco’s cock strained against the fabric and another soft moan fell from his lips.
Dressed and ready, he went to the kitchen to wait for Harry. He fiddled with the cat figurine that would serve as their portkey to London and debated making a cup of tea. But moments later, Harry stood in the doorway, looking every inch the Harry of fifteen years ago.
Draco tapped Potter’s boot with his own. “Are you trying to wrangle a spot on our Board of Directors? Ha! As if we’d ever hire the likes of you!” Draco scoffed and mumbled, “Gryffindors!” under his breath.
“Oh I’m definitely going to suck something,” Harry said with his typical sexy grin. The widened lips, definitely magicked a darker shade than usual, showed off his eye teeth. Draco’s breath caught when he noticed they were a little longer and sharper than usual. His blood began to rush south as Harry stalked closer.
“Oh well… actually, I’ve been thinking ahead.” Harry went to the study and found the notes he’d made for their next ridiculous plan. His hand paused over a brochure he’d also picked up. Before he could second guess himself too much, he folded the brochure and stuck it in his back pocket. He returned to the sitting room and handed the notes to Draco.
“I can’t believe that this is what they would allow for me. To marry this woman, have children and then divorce. How can they say that’s better than living a steady life with you?”
Every piece of Harry screamed at him to stop what was happening, to snatch the bag from Draco’s hand and unpack the full trunk waiting by the floo. But he knew he couldn’t. He couldn’t beg Draco to stay, knowing the internal conflict Draco was already undergoing. Draco didn’t like talking about the tug of war between the teachings of his childhood and his very grown up desires, but he felt it constantly just the same.
It took a little elbowing but finally the witch came forward with a forced smile. Draco tried pulling her aside, out of Potter’s eavesdropping range, but that proved impossible when the spectacled git continued to follow him. Draco was forced to explain his desire to buy sixteen brooms, while at the same time refusing to explain who the brooms were for or why. It was no one’s business who lived at his house.
Draco rolled his eyes at her dramatics. “Jane, my darling, I think we both know that isn’t true. If nothing else, everyone in this house is going to learn to read.” He handed her one of the early reading books from the Manor library. “I began learning from this when I was about Annie’s age.” He handed her a second one of muggle fairy tales. “Once you can read me one of these, we’ll talk.”
Mr Whitehead nodded slowly. He extended a hand to shake. “Very well. I’ll send Ms Coddle my report. And I look forward to meeting the others.”
“Yes, tell me. Say it out loud,” Draco said a little breathlessly. His hand moved faster along his cock, although he still didn’t grip it very tightly. “Tell me what you like about it.”
Draco smiled widely. “Of course I am. Although I’m also wondering how I could fall in love with someone so utterly ridiculous as to have a memorial—”
“You saw me? When? I don’t—” Draco shook his head. “I don’t wear shit like this,” he added, throwing the panties to the floor.
“Where did you get a wand?” Potter asked, eyeing the length of fir in Draco’s hand. “I didn’t know you’d got a new wand.”
Whatever teasing Harry hoped to accomplish got turned back on him when Draco subtly shifted as he talked so that his arse rubbed lightly over Harry’s growing erection.
Harry laughed at that. “It’s only been two weeks!” Usually they waited six to eight weeks between plans. “Are you horny or did your parents offer up another potential bride?”
“Really? You can’t tell by the moaning and writhing that it’s amazing?” Draco didn’t want to drop his hair in, afraid of the colour of the potion. But it turned a shimmery gold much like Harry’s had. Hopefully his exhale didn’t sound like a sigh of relief.
Draco’s mind filled with images of Greyback and Scabior and their disgusting pack of followers. All looking just as ragged and worn, filthy and ravenous as Jane. “We can’t just leave them to fend for themselves.”
“It’s not. The instructors speak to us as though we’ve never fought for our lives and the Aurors act like we’ve never bothered to learn anything. And mixed in with all of that…” Potter sighed at the ceiling. “On top of it all, I’m the ‘Boy Who Lived.’ And I fucking hate it.”
“You look good enough to eat,” Harry said hoarsely. His own cock dribbled pre-come, which the water whisked away.
Draco stuck his tongue out childishly and rubbed his sore side. And admitted to himself that the sting helped him stay awake. He couldn’t wait to greet his bed. To slide between fresh, cool cotton. Rest his head on the plump feather pillow. Melt into a weighted duvet that cuddled him in a cosy cocoon. Bliss.
“They won’t have to do a thing,” Draco went on. “Just lend us their name. I promise we’ll take care of everything.
“Today’s sexy thing is Invisibility Cloaks so I thought I’d surprise you with it and we can do something naughty here in your back room.”
He’d offered a thousand times, each time rebuffed by Draco. But now was Potter’s moment. If he really wanted to help, he’d get one of his band of do-gooders to lend their name to Draco’s foster home. And it would be their name only—Draco didn’t need Gryffindor sentiment mucking up his life.
The droplets that misted Draco’s face and legs had already cooled, so he manhandled Harry until they’d switched positions. “Oh fuck, it’s burning up!” Draco yelped, as he darted away from the spray. He knocked into Harry, who caught him before he fell through the curtain.
“Maybe it’s… maybe it’ll be fine,” Draco said. But Harry could see he had no confidence that anything would be
Draco slammed his teacup to the table and tried not to choke on his tea. He coughed roughly to clear his throat and then said as evenly as possible, “Ah, I see,” as if his world hadn’t just gone topsy-turvy.
“Does it have to be over our bed?” Draco stepped into the shower with a sigh as the warm water hit his skin.
This time Draco grinned and tilted his head enough that their lips could meet. Softly, gently. He nibbled lightly at Harry’s bottom lip until Harry opened up and let Draco’s tongue sweep through. Draco’s hand wrapped around Harry’s waist as the kiss deepened.
“I could knock you to the floor with a jelly-legs jinx and straddle your hips. Then I’d be the higher one.”
Harry wrapped himself tightly around Draco and said, “Let’s just rest here a minute, then we’ll make our way to bed.”
“Beautiful. It’ll be a proper Slytherin House reunion.” He smiled and threw three more apples in his basket. “You know how to floo there, yes?”
“I’d vanish it if I had a wand,” Draco said. “Probably all of this shit is worthless but if my mum comes home and finds I got rid of it all without at least looking, she’d have my head. Let’s make a few piles. Put anything moth-eaten or not protected by magic over here. Anything with benign magic can go there. Anything with dark magic, just leave it and move on.”
“Thanks for letting us crash the party,” Pansy said as she also stood. “We’ll have to do it again sometime.”
Even the thought of watching someone else’s hands sliding down Harry’s chest and into his pants made Draco’s insides twist painfully. And he certainly didn’t crave the touch of anyone else for himself.
“Harry!” Draco yelled, throwing a few kernels of popcorn at him. Both of them started giggling uncontrollably. “You are reckless!”
Draco didn’t have to respond at all. Granger stopped walking and said sternly, “Auror Blakely! We have all logged your discontent. If you can’t keep it to yourself from now on, you will be asked to leave.”
“Theo,” Draco interrupted before he said anything to spook Jane. “Good timing. I need an aguamenti.”
him to drop by. It would be rude to continue on home if Draco had already ordered take-away to share. Assuming Draco had made it home already.
Potter reached through and squeezed Orion’s tiny foot gently. Draco carefully took hold of his hand. “My poor baby. This never should have happened.”
“I bought it for the lie. I gave it to you for coming here today. I know you hate me but it means a lot to Draco to have his family here.”
Pansy’s nose scrunched up. “Harry, she is just the worst. Why were you even trying to reach out to her?”
Harry quickly followed in a shady haze of arousal and the green, murky light of the Slytherin common room. Panting and spent, he slumped against Draco and mumbled into his flushed, sweaty neck, “Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff next?”
Between that and Ginny’s confused stare, Harry had a hard time not laughing out loud. Draco enjoyed crossword puzzles while on break from work but the awful mobile reception prevented him from googling answers. Over the last week that they’d been texting, Harry had looked up several answers for him, including sea ports in Japan.
The older one glared at Draco. “We don’t want to stay here.” A little girl perhaps, judging by the pitch of her voice.
Taking a deep breath, Draco pasted a cautious smile on his face. “Isn’t this a merry gathering. How can I help you?”
“Oh,” Draco said, perking up at this unexpected change. His face lit up at the chubby little deer with rounded, fat antlers. “I’m so adorable! Look at my tiny antlers!”
Draco had ventured out into the muggle world primarily to separate himself from the expectations Lucius set for him. He saw no reason why Harry shouldn’t work on his own separations from Ginny. He made Harry see all the good things he enjoyed about his life and all the ways Ginny really didn’t fit in those places. The daily lunchtime texts from Draco that reminded him to eat on time, also gave Harry confidence to resist Ginny’s advances.
Ron gestured with his beer. “If you want him to take better care of himself, you should have food delivered to his house, like his
Draco cupped Harry’s cheeks in his hands to cut off his worry. “It’s brilliant. Perfect. I love you and our life together.” He kissed Harry lightly, then let him go. “But this month has been… different. Fun and exciting, but also occasionally weird and challenging. This feels familiar.”
“More like what was Hildred Malfoy thinking, as it was my great-grandmother that decorated this room in the first place. My mother was too afraid of offending her mother-in-law to ever change it.”
Draco’s intent to wake early and get to the shops before they filled with judgmental witches and wizards was blown all to hell by the usual array of nightmares. Green light, a landslide of junk and flames, his mother’s pale face streaked with tears and blood. It was almost noon before he finally woke up enough to splash some water on his face and prepare for a trip to the magical world.
how valuable the goblin wine was, but knew that two pureblood boys would recognise it on sight. Neither Blaise nor Neville could hide their surprise at the contraband.
“I think we need more brooms,” Draco said with a sigh as Jemma and Bryce began fighting over whose turn was next. Theo summoned the broom and had them flip a knut to see who went next. As Jemma sailed happily away, Draco arranged for Greg to take his place so he could head to Quality Quidditch Supplies.
,” Draco moaned, coming in white streaks across Harry’s belly. The flush of his skin deepened and spread down his chest and his breath came in short, sharp gasps. For long seconds he stared at the mess he made, then he turned a dazed smile on Harry.
Draco smiled. “How wonderful. I’ll take those.” He reached through the bars for the pile, but Auror Blakely pulled them back.
“I woke up. If they’re going to set standards they know I can’t meet, then I just have to set new ones of my own. And that means marrying you and making our own family when we’re ready.”
It took a while to convince her he hadn’t given her the money in exchange for a baby or two. Or to prevent her marriage to Draco. In fact, there were no strings attached at all.
The warmth of his fingers seeped into the bare skin of Ron’s arm and was he… Fuck, was he… Yes. He was getting hard.
“I like you too, Harry. I like you better when you’re not wearing a married man’s body but… I like you all the same.”
“You’re welcome?” Harry didn’t mean to sound questioning, but he didn’t expect the weird backhanded compliment. “I asked Draco once if I incurred a life debt with you that day.”
They were worn out in time for delivery of the older kids’ equipment. Pansy and Draco took the little ones inside for a snack and a story to let the older kids play without interruption.
Organising a game of quidditch on the Saturday after NEWTs was easy enough. All fourteen of the eighth years went out to the pitch and the ten that wanted to fly were divided into two teams. Draco and Harry played rival seekers, just like old times.
“Dinner, together. A date.” Malfoy shrugged and pursed his lips while Harry waited anxiously. “Fine. I’m in.”
Six months ago Draco thought he’d be dead by now. Instead, he had Harry Potter asking him if he had a pencil sharpener for his coloured pencils. Draco spelled all the pencils sharp and wondered if they should get an actual pencil sharpener the kids could use themselves.
Harry popped off with a slurp. “Malfoy, you prick, you better be returning the favour.” He cupped his cock over his jeans.
“Lock the door,” Harry whispered against the shell of his ear. His tongue darted out to tease Draco’s ear lobe. “We’ll be quick, I swear it.” He squeezed Draco’s arse, pressing their bodies even closer together.
It hovered right on the tip of Harry’s tongue to say something more. But he couldn’t use words like ‘love’ and ‘forever’ now, not with Draco so open and vulnerable. He didn’t want Draco thinking it was only sex that Harry loved. He would save it for later, when a different opportunity arose.
He let one button slip through its hole and then another. Merlin, he could barely breathe and he’d only seen the very top of it.
Draco shook hands with the witch that came forward. “Pansy Parkinson has been tending to our records and she’ll be assisting you.”
They sat in silence for a while until Potter said, “You’re doing a really good thing here, you know?”
From his messenger bag he pulled out the first pair of shrunken trunks. “Alex and David,” he called out, looking at the nervous group. The two boys came forward as Draco enlarged the trunks. “Prepare for everyone to treat you with suspicion and remember it takes a special sort of bravery to stand strong against their hatred. But I swear if that bravery sorts you into Gryffindor, David, I will write a special song to mock you and teach it to all the children to sing in a Howler.” He gave the shaky boy a hug and nodded to Alex. “Stick close to Alex on the train ride. He’ll look out for you.”
Draco turned to them with a completely straight face and said, “On behalf of my goddaughter, who is a very big fan of the adventures of Molly Meow, I messaged Harry expressing our concern over the recent loss of Molly’s goldfish.” He frowned at Harry. “Why does a cat have a pet goldfish? Isn't that odd? When Mr Wiggles died, I honestly worried Molly might eat him instead of bury him.”
Draco rolled his eyes and gave a long-suffering sigh. “I think there’s a pork roast. Chester and Libby will be looking for you. Something about gobstones again.”
Harry grabbed his bowl of folded up parchments and followed Draco to the sofa in the sitting room. Draco measured out half the vial into a shot glass and offered it to Harry. “Bottoms up!” They both drank, and Draco hummed in pleasure at the mildly sweet taste.
Not really wanting to stay up too late, Draco only sipped his mug of shrivelfig tea. But Harry drank his quickly and turned the mug in his hand as though contemplating another serving.
To Ron, in Harry’s body, it just smelled like perfume. It didn’t have the same scent memories Ron’s body had. And he could tell by the look Harry sported that Ron’s body clearly remembered their anniversary weekend in Mallorca last month.
Harry Potter? Either they would be a tremendous help, or they would set the Manor on fire. Granger looked around with a calm facade, hiding whatever memories surfaced.
“And sweets,” Theo added. He had a sweet tooth to rival Draco’s and they never seemed to ration the chocolate frogs well enough.
“Okay clearly I’m missing something,” Draco said, rising from the table. “And I want to hear more about it because it sounds like fun. But another time because we really should be going.” Harry stuck his tongue out at Ron.
Draco moaned as the chocolate dissolved on his tongue, noting the light flush to Harry’s cheeks at the sound. Just to torture him, Draco licked his thumb and forefinger clean of non-existent chocolate.
“Anything and everything for you.” Harry ran his hands over Draco’s thighs, with a delicious grin on his lips.
“Or maybe his girlfriend didn’t know him as well as she thought she did,” Draco said, causing dead silence at their end of the table. He paused with his beer halfway to his mouth. “What? Did I say something wrong?”
Giggling like idiots, they ran to Harry’s room. Although he didn’t expect Ron back any time soon, Harry still warded the door. He pulled Draco to his bed and brushed their lips together.
“How’re you holding up?” Harry asked, resting his arm around Draco’s waist. “You’re looking a little pale.”
He took a little extra care to clean the flat that afternoon, and set the mood with candles and a dozen roses to decorate the dining room table. He picked up a special dinner for the two of them, and baked brownies for dessert.
“Mm,” he moans, shifting one hand to slide between my thighs while the other starts to stroke my cock, “you are so deliciously warm.”
His hands trembled as he opened the box. How ridiculous. Crazy. Absolutely mad. Wasn’t it? Men didn’t go around wearing women’s underwear! Except Malfoy did and Harry needed to figure out why.
“They were my parents’ rings.” At Draco’s surprised yet curious look Harry said, “Just the gold was. I had my mother’s two rings and my dad’s melted together and recast like this for us.” He didn’t mention the diamonds from the engagement ring and the cuff links he turned them into. He was saving those for a wedding day present.
“Feeling you move, Draco… how are you so hot? After all these years, it’s still never enough of you…”
“Some of them,” Draco replied. “Some have been in place for hundreds of years, and are updated periodically. It’s been quite a while since the wards were last seen to. We’re researching some updated options now; removing others that are no longer of use.”
Ron hugged Harry and didn’t know what to think about hugging his own taller frame. “It’ll be all right. She’ll be here in about ten minutes. We’ll talk then so we don’t have to repeat everything for her.”
“No,” Draco said firmly, stepping between their visitors and Jason. “You are not taking anyone with you. He was left, quite clearly, in
And then Potter pulling Draco down next to him so their knees bumped for a game of gobstones with Daria and Libby.
“Like, at all? Even innocent touches? That might be hard to work around.” He would have to look over the contract as soon as possible, and see what loopholes he could find.
When Draco called Jason and Bryce, he heard a whimpering from the Littles. Elyon whispered to Daphne, then ran over to give Bryce one more hug. He didn’t know which brother would take the parting hardest, Bryce or Elyon.
“Oh come on, forty-one isn’t too old! And I think it’ll be fun. Do you want to see the list?” He pulled a folded parchment from his pocket and offered it to Draco.
Draco ran a hand down Harry’s chest and gave him a coy look through his lashes. “Want to pretend it’s my first time on a broom? Maybe ride yours together?”
He let out a sharp bark of laughter when Harry returned and made a dramatic turn, causing his black cloak—Draco’s silk-lined dress cloak for special occasions only—to flair out widely. Under it he had a crisp black shirt and no tie, along with black trousers. He remained barefoot, which should have made the outfit silly, but because it was
Harry shook his head at the daily worry. “You’re worrying over nothing. It’s going to work out.” He smiled at Draco. “I wish I could hold your hand.”
An hour later, his brilliant solicitor earned his high retainer by arranging a meeting of all interested parties. Ms Coddle, Auror Blakely, and Draco met with Brunhilde Stokke from the Wizengamot for arbitration and a final decision on his care home. Despite her playful lavender hair, Mrs Stokke didn’t appear to have a single light-hearted bone in her body. Draco had read enough of Wizengamot politics to know she wasn’t a witch to cross. Auror Blakely certainly seemed glad to see her and that didn’t bode well for Draco.
Jason scoffed, “You think the Ministry is just going to let this merry gathering happen? They’re going to bust in here any day now and ruin everything. We’ll be back on the streets in no time.”
Harry shrugged. “So? Would my mum rather her ring stayed in a box because I wasn’t marrying a witch, or would she rather I got some use out of it? This way they’re still with me but in a way that suits me—us—better. Do you like them?”
“Not as cool as the dragon, but better than the dodo so I’ll take it.” He nudged Harry’s leg. “Get to work so we can get to playing.”
“Relax, I’ve got this.” Harry directed them into a swirling dive that had Draco shrieking like a banshee. Harry’s laugh was caught by the wind. His arm tightened around Draco’s waist. “I’ve got you.”
When I first started writing these six sentence shorts, prompts came from a list of CO inktober prompts from last year. Except I can't draw so I wrote stories instead. These two aren't sexy, but I still liked how they turned out and so I'm including them!
The Elf’s eyes widened almost comically. “Oh no, sir! Pickles can’t be a free Elf! No, no, no!” His eyes darted around the room, and Draco wondered if he might be looking to punish himself.
“Yeah, maybe,” Harry said, glancing at Pansy. She looked cute enough—her pug face had rounded and softened these last few years and he loved her long, shiny hair. The snug v-neck jumper wasn’t bad either. School robes had kept that generous rack hidden too well.
Draco pursed his lips as he stared at the paper. Then he threw it to the coffee table with a defeated sigh. Harry scooted closer, and Draco eyed him a little warily. Friends could share a sofa, but didn’t sit thigh to thigh unless the sofa was full of other people.
“Maybe next time,” Potter shrugged, dropping the ball and kicking it away. He glanced back with a look Draco didn’t understand.
The ups and downs of running the shop always made him happy to return to the peaceful serenity of their cottage and his perfect husband waiting with a smile. And tonight they would stay up entirely too late for a work night, as if they weren’t usually in bed by ten o’clock.
Draco wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and ignored Weasley entirely. “Any ideas? Time is of the essence.”
“If you touch my dick I’m going to hex yours off before I leave this body, Harry!” Ron yelled back. “Remember that Christmas dinner when Aunt Muriel tripped over Crookshanks and we all saw her purple knickers?”
“I love it! I’m going to frame it for my office.” Draco used his own wand to preserve the page against wrinkling before stowing them back in his bag. “Thank you!” He leaned in and batted his eyes playfully. “This might be a good time for a first kiss.”
“As we’ve already established, I don’t need to report my every move to you.” He threw a broom at Potter and mounted the other one. Knowing the nosy git would follow, Draco flew off towards the Manor gates. He landed gracefully with Potter a beat behind. “I can’t close the floo for reasons that are my own. But I swear if you, or any other Ministry officials, come through uninvited again, you
“They didn’t say,” Pansy said, handing each of them a mug. “I suppose it’ll take some time to review the evaluations. Probably another inspection or two… I don’t know what else.”
Draco paced by the fireplace and smiled as Harry entered the room. “What do you want to do first?” He offered his hand, palm up. “Want to hold hands?” As Harry took his hand, he whispered, “We could skip breakfast, and find somewhere more private to… to hang out.” He darted a glance around the common room. Although it was still empty at this hour, others would be waking up soon.
“Wouldn’t you like to know.” Draco rolled his eyes and swung a leg over, determined to ride off without losing his temper.
“I don’t know, all right?” Draco scrubbed his hair in frustration. “Is that what you want to hear? I don’t know what’s going to happen. But we have to go on, day by day, hoping for the best.”
“I know, that just makes it worse. Can’t blame anyone else this time.” Harry also laid down, tucking the pillow firmly under his head. “What other sorts of naughty books do you have?”
“As if anyone believes you ride that bike. Oh!” she snapped her fingers with a triumphant grin. “You contacted him through his Molly Meow blog.”
Harry laughed. “That’s just what Ron said. I think we can survive a few weeks.” Or work around the rules. Harry had plenty of practice with that. They’d be fine.
! Who would ever believe that a few short months ago the echoing shrieks were terror and not laughter? The shrieking got louder as Jemma chased Annie past Draco and Daphne and into the smaller ballroom.
Potter nodded. “Yeah. I think so.” He sipped his hot chocolate and sighed up at the sky. “This is much more peaceful. More my speed these days.”
home, scare everyone half to death, demand answers that are none of your fucking business, and you think I should
It only took Draco a few minutes to see the futility of his plan. Wandering the streets would get him nowhere, and he had no guarantee Potter was even around. He needed direct contact. Someone that could get a hold of him easily.
“I know.” Draco gave him a small smile. “I know and it’s fine. Or it will be one day when I can forget this episode entirely.” He sighed heavily. “I’m sorry but I think I just want to be alone right now.”
Harry pushed Draco back against the door to the loo, but still barely had room to plant his feet firmly enough. That didn’t stop him from stroking Draco faster and harder. At least the train wasn’t moving. They’d broken into Hogsmeade Station at two in the morning just for this. Well Harry had broken in, because that was what Draco wanted.
Mrs Stokke harrumphed and made another note. Auror Blakely glared at Draco and Harry for the point in their favour.
“Thank you, Sherri. I—that means a lot to me. Really.” Draco laughed sadly. “I just hope they feel the same.”
All three books had a plain black cover with small, unembellished white lettering on them. They looked just like any other random old book from the Hogwarts library that had been rebound and lost its original, more interesting cover.
“I can fuss over you if I want. Fuck, I can’t even hug you.” He threw a glare at Theo, then turned worried eyes on Draco. “You’re sure you’re all right?”
That occupied both number five on the ‘pro’ list of attributes, and number two on the ‘con’ list of attributes that Draco had playfully put together about Harry.
“It can’t end like this,” he whispers, kicking the sword aside and pinning me to the wall. His lips graze the wound on my neck with a warm tingle of magic that heals the tiny graze. “Tell me we can be something different.”
Draco stared down at the blue jeans and red t-shirt from the secondhand shop, both altered by Pansy’s wand to be comfortably form-fitting. “Because I can. Now fuck off my property.” He hopped on the broom and flew back to the house before Potter could badger him with more annoying questions.
After lunch, Draco shared his chocolates with the other eighth years in the common room. Harry noticed Draco saved each wrapper, and his heart warmed at the subtle, romantic gesture. He’d have to keep that in mind for future gifts.
But Harry pulled it out of reach. “I have an elf that works wonders. Get Theo to appoint you chaperone,” he said to Blaise, “and then make yourself scarce while he’s at chess club. Then it’s yours.”
As he cast a sticking charm on the paper, Draco wondered what his father would say about the current state of his study. Annie plastered the drawing to the wall, amidst a host of other similar scribbles done by herself and several other children. Crayons, both magical and muggle, littered the floor right over the stain where Chester spilled grape juice on the rug. The House Elves hadn’t got to it in time to truly get the stain out.
Everyone in the yard froze when they saw Trainee Harry Potter standing awkwardly behind Pansy, looking at Draco as though he’d never seen him before. Annie buried her face in Draco’s neck. “Is he gonna take me?”
A prickle of apprehension shot down Draco’s spine as he watched Harry add three drops of Calming Draught to a mug of tea after dinner. What the fuck was on the agenda that Harry needed calming for?
“But it wasn’t enough.” Harry ran a hand down Draco’s cheek and drew him in for a soft kiss. “I started planning a proposal that night.”
“Hey!” Draco yelled at David, Elyon, and Samantha as they came coasting down the hallway. “Roller skates are to be kept on the second floor portrait gallery!”
Draco knocked on the door across the hall. When it opened to a white-haired old woman, he smiled. “Good afternoon. We’re looking for the Wilsons that live across the hall there. Do you know where they might be or when they’ll be back?”
“No I… I wanted… I didn’t want to be another person you had to care for. I want to be the person you come to when
Draco stretched and sighed, then moved gingerly to his bathroom. The lingering soreness indicated too long spent in bed, and he couldn’t regret it. For too long he’d been running on less and less sleep, and the whole night awake with the full moon didn’t do him any favours.
Draco went on to Diagon Alley and did a little shopping for the school room they were setting up at home. Actually, he may have gone overboard on the shopping. ‘My First Potions’ kits brought up fond memories of his childhood, so he snapped up four of them for the older children. And with the summer gardens fading, a flutterby sprouting kit seemed like a fun way to add colour and cheer. The smaller children would enjoy watering and trimming the young plant as it grew.
Draco snorted, “I know fuck-all about babies. I’ll see what they have at the shop and buy a variety of things.”
“So Harry,” Draco said, shifting subtly so their arms brushed, “you never said how you got started with Molly Meow. I want to hear it in person, even if it’s the same as your interviews.”
In a surreal fog of desire and disbelief at his luck, Harry braced his hand on the wall and went up on his tiptoes again. Slowly… so achingly slowly, he eased himself down on the bright blue dildo Draco stuck to the wall of his shower. Dimly he registered Draco’s wand movement that lowered it to a more comfortable angle. Harry hadn’t bottomed in ages and moaned lightly at the tumble of new, and at the same time familiar, sensations.
Niall threw the ruler aside and took Dev’s cock in hand, growling against his lips, “This is a stupid waste of time when I could be wearing a big dumb grin of my own.”
“An extended house party for my birthday. Our post, if you please,” Draco said, holding his hand out for the letters.
A single floo call to the Ministry Department of Transportation was all it took to learn the Hogwarts Express would arrive at the station promptly at ten in the morning.
Draco scoffed. “What on earth do I have to be nervous about? I’ve known you half my life! Do we even have secrets anymore?”
With an eye roll, Draco snatched it away and tossed it onto his trunk next to him. “Thanks,” he said dully.
Utterly spent, Harry sagged against Draco and wished he could live in this suspended moment of warmth, arousal, and the soft press of Draco’s lips against his temple.
“Theo’s spells worked on the windows and we’re confident they can’t be broken. And Harry just took the last box of breakables out,” Andromeda said, tugging the corner of the duvet once more. “I think we’re ready.”
“Kiss me,” Harry whispered after he rinsed his hair a second time. Draco wrapped chilled arms around Harry, making him moan. “You feel so cool after the warm water.”
“Leave the scarf on,” Harry said a little breathlessly as he sank to his knees. He ran a hand down Draco’s bare stomach and pulled his pants down to free his cock.
Instead of actual work, he bustled around the shop cleaning and organising stock in an effort to look busy. Gregory, reading a book between customers, paid him no heed. Draco paused at the sensual delights display, considering the oils and potions for sale. One of those would make a lovely gift to bring home since, as far as Draco could tell, Harry had only stolen the one bottle of massage oil.
“What the fuck, you imbecile!” Draco hissed. He beat on Harry’s shaking shoulders—because of course he found Draco’s fright hilarious—with the parchments in his hands. “I almost hexed you!”
With one delicate finger, Draco pressed aside Harry’s collar, exposing a few black lines. “Did it hurt?”
A new wave of heat curled through Harry, making him groan as his cock gave a half-hearted twitch of support. Harry pushed Draco to the bed and straddled his hips. He ran a hand down Draco’s belly and tugged at his waistband. “Can I? Is it too much?”
“No…” Draco ran his hands down his thighs, smoothing his trousers and picking off imaginary lint. “Thank you. For your help.”
“It’s Pansy’s favourite guilty pleasure. They report on social standings—who is dating who, what marriages are on the rocks, and who gets the galleons in the split. And they don’t care one whit about honesty and accuracy. It’s just the worst. Be glad you haven’t seen it.” He stumbled over nothing and leaned into Potter’s steadying hand. “You’re going to have to Apparate me home.”
"Interesting,” Mrs Stokke said, evenly and without judgement. “Auror Blakely. If you could outline for me the objections the DMLE has concerning the application.”
“Good morning,” Draco said with a smile. “Any other ways I may be of service? Do you have special plans for the day?”
time. And on the spot like this, he couldn’t even remember the name of another plant. He sighed, “Okay yes, it was the orchid.”
“As I said,” Draco said shakily, smoothing his hair once more, “he’s helping me with a project.” Draco turned his back on Weasley, pretending to survey the shop as if he didn’t almost start crying a moment ago.
Another excruciatingly silent half hour passed. About halfway through, Harry very nearly asked Draco if he wanted to play chess but thought that might be laying it on a little thick. Theo looked near enough to snapping and Harry probably didn’t need to poke that nundu much harder.
“Why do you hold onto it? Their rules about courtship and dating. You’ve rejected everything else. Why can’t you just say ‘fuck it’ and date someone you like? Someone you love.”
“Fine. But I need you to talk to Professor Slughorn when you have a free moment today to explain about the life debt.”
He’d forgotten about another present until it arrived unexpectedly in early May. He handed the large, flat envelope to Draco at breakfast. “Sorry about the dragon theme, but I commissioned it before that conversation.”
Astoria took the younger girl’s hand and gently led her forward. “It’s all right,” Astoria said. “Better than last year.” Their textbook lists indicated the second years would be repeating a lot of their coursework from the previous year, and Draco hoped Evelyn managed with her new, borrowed wand. It hadn’t sent up as many sparks as David’s had, but it would serve until they could find something more permanent.
“That’s all right, Harry. Why don’t you two walk to the gates? The Aurors should be here at any moment. I’ll supervise the children in the garden.” Andromeda gave Draco’s arm a squeeze and winked at Harry before continuing down the hall towards the back stairs.
“The inspection? What the fuck does that have to do with anything? Why aren’t you getting in that pretty boy’s pants?”
Disconnected. A good way to describe the apprehensive feeling Draco had about the scenario. Draco kissed the top of Harry’s head and gave his fingers a squeeze. “That’s good, me too. We can just have a quiet evening as usual. Do you want to watch something? Or read something?”
He crept to his mother’s sitting room, listening all the while for Pansy. Carefully, lest it squeak, he lifted the lid of a decorative box carved with dragons. Inside sat several pictures of Narcissa with Draco. Both younger and smiling. Happy and healthy. The sentimentality of it no longer tugged at Draco. Very much, anyway. He lifted the pictures to reveal a small bottle of Calming Draught. Pansy had a general fear of this sitting room and avoided it. It remained the last safe hiding place.
believe this story. Never, ever in a million years. Harry focused hard on the memory to make it vivid enough to pensieve. A snorting laugh turned into wheezing laughter that had him wiping away tears. Narcissa Malfoy said
Draco choked back a sob of relief. It would be all right. Somehow, Harry fucking Potter would fix everything. Little bastard. Draco didn’t know which he hated more in that moment—Harry Potter or the desperation with which he needed his help.
“Yeah, okay.” Harry glanced at Draco, whose eyes glazed over in bewilderment at the contract. Harry lifted a quill from McGonagall’s desk. “I just sign here?”
“I’m going to get more robes,” Draco announced. “A variety of sizes. Something for everyone. Anyone need anything while I’m out?”
Andromeda sighed and picked the baby up, patting him on the back. His hair changed to a soft blue as he cooed.
He didn’t want to think about their friends returning and real life coming between them once again. Instead he cast a breath freshening charm and kissed Draco as though they had an eternity to spend doing just that. He revelled in the feeling of Draco’s cock pressed against his, and lightly teased them both with light caresses until Draco made a whining, desperate sound. Only then did Harry take both their cocks in hand and stroke them firmly and steadily.
“I hope this is fun,” Harry whispered, giving Draco’s hand a squeeze as they approached the welcome counter at the duelling gym.
“Thank you, Madam Stokke.” Matilda Coddle went over Draco’s application and the results of the inspection, finding everything in proper order with no suspicious activity or motives noted. “He genuinely wants the best for these children.”
Draco set the book aside and scooted close enough to take Harry’s hand. “That’s so precious, Harry.”
“No.” Draco kissed Orion’s head and rubbed his back. “Thank you, but no. I’d rather carry him.” After almost losing the baby today, Draco couldn’t bear to be parted, no matter the heavy weight on his tired arms. “Press the button for the lift.”
“Here, you carry this.” Draco shoved the changing bag at Potter. “He weighs a tonne while he’s asleep. I wish Pansy had packed my sling.”
He straightened and used Draco’s wand to clean them up, and then buttoned him back up. “There, good as new. Didn’t even muss your hair.”
“I would,” Harry said, hugging Draco and running a hand through his silky hair. “I would go get one if you wanted me to.”
Harry’s smile fell. He fastened his jeans and said sharply, “I saw you. In hot pink boy shorts. You were changing your robes.”
Pansy declined but Theo and Daphne shared his start-of-the-school-year excitement. They ended up using two rooms for schooling—a large one everyone could gather in for group activities, and a smaller one just for the four older children and their more focused studies.
My garlic bread falls to my plate uneaten as I get to my feet with an eager smile. “Why does this continue to work when you can have me anytime you want me?”
The saleswitch found him a nice mid-range broom for experienced flyers, as well as some training brooms for smaller children. She also helped him size equipment for a variety of ages. As the hour wore on and Draco’s purchases towered higher and higher, her demeanor relaxed considerably. She even threw in a competition grade snitch for free.
Her strict upbringing prevented her from getting close to anyone, and she craved physical intimacy with every fibre of her being. Similar to how Draco had described it, the life debt gave her an excuse to indulge in the passions she’d had to keep hidden. She learned just how to needle Benedict into ‘putting her in her place’ so she could touch him, kiss him, fuck him as she’d always wanted.
“Good idea, Hermione, considering how hot it is in here,” he said, already unbuttoning his own school shirt.
For a long minute, Draco and Potter stared at one another through the gates. Should Draco thank him for helping? Did he want to acknowledge that he owed Potter once again? Why couldn’t the spectacled git leave Draco to muddle through alone?
“Are you feeling all right?” Draco asked as he set his grocery bags on the worktop. “You seemed off at the shops today.” It was rare that Harry didn’t have something to say about the produce Draco picked, even if only in teasing.
But instead…  Damn, was that what his confused face looked like? No wonder Hermione always laughed or rolled her eyes at him.
Potter found them there, all covered in paint. He bundled up his Auror Trainee robe and threw it angrily into a corner. Draco frowned at him, “I thought you were quitting that piece of shit job.”
Harry whipped the shirt off his head and cupped Draco’s jaw to draw him close. He pressed their foreheads together and moaned as Draco’s hands cascaded down his bare back. “Is this too fast?”
Lightly he carded through thick black locks and whispered, “The students return soon and everything will change.”
Potter smiled and bumped their shoulders together. “I’m glad you asked.” After a brief pause, he settled Teddy in the crook of his arm and pulled out his wand. “May I? You look like shit.”
But as they settled into bed, Harry pulled him close with a contented sigh. “This was the best day I’ve ever had.”
“Okay, great. The private rooms are one galleon per person per hour. Will you be renting any equipment or props?” At Draco’s head shake he continued, “All right. There’s a clock on the wall that counts down your hour. If you are more than five minutes over, it’ll automatically charge you for another full hour. And there’s a ten galleon cleaning deposit. It’s returned to you if the room is left as clean as you found it.”
As he gathered his materials back into his battered briefcase, Mr Whitehead casually asked, “What will you do if your application for fostering is rejected, Mr Malfoy?”
Her eyes darted to Potter and she blushed, “It’s our job to help. Have a good day, Mr Malfoy. Mr Potter.” The red of her cheeks deepened as she made brief eye contact with Potter, then she hurried away.
“Then you’ll need to acquire a warrant,” Malfoy said, hiding his joy at the Auror’s discomfort while banishing the folder to his desk drawer once again.
Harry had decided on first names for them, as tentative friendships broke out across House lines among the eighth years. A privilege Draco hadn’t been brave enough to take him up on just yet.
“Me either.” A delightful blush cascaded over Harry’s cheeks. “I posted my Five Year thing and didn’t want anyone making a fuss about it at midnight.”
Draco’s hips rolled and Harry let out a broken moan. “My dearest,” Draco whispered against Harry’s cheek, “my sweet. Mine. Every day.”
Unable to wait any longer for his romantic evening, Draco asked Gregory to close up and left work an hour early. What was the point of owning the shop if he couldn’t come and go at eccentric hours?
Cautiously he approached Malfoy at pub night, settling himself in the vacant chair with a wide smile. “Malfoy,” he said with a nod.
“But Harry, don’t you see? She’s just like me. Trapped by her parents’ whims in order to secure her education and future. The only reason my parents haven’t cracked down harder on me is they know
After whispering about making an early night of it because he had to be in the shop a little early tomorrow, Draco had to laugh. He never could resist passing off mundanities as sexy pillow talk.
“Shh,” Harry said, taking Draco by the hand. He led them through a maze of sleeping bodies, abandoned pillows, streamers and balloons, and a few cups and plates the House Elves had missed until they arrived at his room. He closed the door and pressed Draco against it. “So what now? I really want to kiss you but is that moving too fast?”
“We’re not dating,” Blaise said, with Neville grinning at his side. “We’re just friends who hang out sometimes.”
The challenge was getting everyone back to the castle after the game, except for the vital members of the scheme. Ron, flush with the excitement of his very own bottle of Gornuk’s collection, suggested alcohol. Kreacher pulled through once again and a bottle of firewhisky waited in the common room with fairy cakes and chocolates to toast the end of school.
“I know.” Draco charmed his plate clean and set it in the basket. “I don’t know of anyone else that would put up with twelve weeks of chastity to get me.”
, he’d overslept! Thank Merlin the Cloak kept him hidden. Just in case, he froze in Malfoy's chair while Malfoy bustled in, mumbling under his breath. Harry, on full alert now, waited for his chance to make an escape.
“We’re watching you, Mr Malfoy,” Auror Blakely said ominously before finally passing the letters through the gate. Draco resisted the urge to roll his eyes at the annoying, repeated refrain. The Auror nodded at Potter, then stepped back to Disapparate.
Harry laughed and blinked away the hot burn of joyous tears. “Oh Draco, I want that too. More than anything.” He pulled Draco close and pressed a soft kiss to his beautiful, perfect lips. “Sorry, I—”
At Draco’s nod, Potter widened the chair with a spell, enough so that he could sit next to Draco. He wriggled in close, encouraging Draco to drape an arm around his shoulder.
“Or else what? Surely you don’t want to fuck around here, where someone might find out. Aren’t you worried that they’ll know what you’ve been up to? That wizard at the welcome desk perhaps, with his ten galleon cleaning fee?” Draco glanced at the clock, ticking down their hour. “I’m afraid we don’t have time for it anyway.”
“Whatever, it’s cute.” Theo gathered the brushes in a bucket. “I’ll take these to rinse clean. Why don’t you two store the leftover paint?” He winked at Draco behind Potter’s back, so Draco flipped him two fingers when Potter wasn’t looking.
He scowled when Potter followed right along, as though he were part of the group as well. But what could he say to keep Potter from coming with them? The train station, the city streets, the ice cream shop were all public places he had no business barring Potter from. Why must he be a scourge on Draco’s patience?
“Sorry, shit, I’m so sorry, Draco! Here, let me -” Harry yanked Draco to his feet and turned him towards the water. “It’s all right. Sorry. Just… rinse it off, I’ll be right back.”
Draco breathed a sigh of relief as their portkeys landed them in the back gardens. He whistled at Greg, then grinned as he pulled his wand and began spraying everyone in sight with an Aguamenti. Greg caught on fast and also began spraying the crowd, as Daphne and Pansy pulled their wands to retaliate. The children shrieked and ran wild, jumping and rolling through the grass and dragging the wand-wielders down.
With all the excited chattering in the common room, it took a while for Harry to notice Theo hovering nearby. But he couldn’t ignore it at dinner when Theo sat right between Draco and Harry. At first he thought it might be a kindness, so they didn’t accidentally bump elbows and shock each other. But Theo didn’t have that sort of kindness in him.
“Peel off these outer layers until you get to the dark purple centre. We’ll steep that for four minutes.”
“Hey!” Potter called. Of course Potter had to follow him. “Malfoy, wait!” Huffing slightly, Potter grabbed Draco’s arm to pull him to a halt. “You—you didn’t buy the robe.”
“I’m not becoming an animagus and we’re not getting a pet. You know we’d be shit at training an animal.”
Mrs Stokke’s eyes, a slightly darker purple than her hair, widened in surprise. “Dromeda, I didn’t expect to see you here. I understood you were somewhat estranged from,” she paused briefly, her eyes darting to Draco, “this branch of your family.”
bath products and looked around the chocolate shop, overwhelmed by the possibilities of so many glass cases of chocolate truffles in all shapes and sizes. Another little treat for Draco, to pick out his very own collection of chocolates. And well he deserved it too! His eyelashes fluttered and he couldn’t help but gingerly touch the puffy skin around his eye.
Silver eyes glittered with arousal. “Do I look like I’m joking?” He squeezed his own cock over his pyjamas, and Harry felt himself nodding his compliance and whispering, “Okay. Yeah. Okay.”
Harry’s face reddened and he sighed, “Yes, but I already know we don't want to do anything like that so…”
“Yeah that’s great. Can you just go now?” He refused—flat out refused—to let Harry’s stupid body humiliate him this way. Another deep breath. He could do this because he was entirely too old to be experiencing random erections.
“Draco!” Harry called from the kitchen. “Our portkey is in forty-eight minutes. You need to stop fretting over your suitcase and eat your breakfast!”
“Don’t we still have those roller massage thingies? We could charm the set of them to work over both of us, like a couple’s massage.” Giddy excitement coursed through Draco at this decadent play during a random week night.
Harry went down the hall of Draco’s flat to the small bathroom that could definitely benefit from wizarding space. Chilled and weary, he peeled off his soggy uniform and reached into the right side of the shower to turn the water on.
As soon as Draco left, promising to return momentarily with discharge papers, Ron pulled Harry in for a hug. “I’m so happy for you! I knew he liked you back!”
Theo and Draco kept their room loads neater than Ron and Harry kept theirs. The two of them fought over it constantly though, as both Theo and Draco had definite ideas about the room, but not the
Harry tugged playfully at Draco’s sleeve, then began unbuttoning Draco’s robe. “Why on earth would you be embarrassed if they did? They both know you’ve tested all those products at home. And we’ve been married thirteen years, Draco. I’m sorry to burst your bubble but people know we’re having sex.”
“I don’t know. I can’t think anymore.” He tilted his head back and let Draco continue kissing down to the dip in his collarbone.
Muttering viciously under his breath, Auror Blakely tore his Auror robes off to shove into a pocket. Draco wondered if Granger’s interference was helpful or not. But at least now everyone wore plain, unremarkable clothes, and so he chose to be grateful. Opening the gate wide, he stood back to let them all in.
Harry didn’t kiss him, because friends didn’t celebrate their joys with kisses, but he saw in Draco’s eyes the same yearning and that was good enough for now. Harry offered him the pot of floo powder again.
“Good idea.” And yet, Harry set the bin aside and pulled off his t-shirt with a wicked smile for Draco.
Changing his clothes meant generating laundry and if there was anything Draco learned in the two weeks of living with his friends in Malfoy Manor it was that laundry fucking sucked. More than anything. He had regret for every House Elf he’d ever harangued about laundry because they were all angels sent from heaven for doing that one very important task.
get married?” Even though they were only eighteen—probably nineteen by the time the moment came—it still excited him. Draco could be his forever. “Muggles don’t allow two men to get married.”
“But you—you would if there wasn’t—if you didn’t have so many other things on your plate?” He rubbed Draco’s wrist, then let him go. “Could there be something for us?”
on his sweet, forty-one year old husband, but the fifteen year old inside him that spent every night wanking over the heavily tattooed Greek National Quidditch team desperately desired that very thing.
“I think one of us should stay sober and alert.” He laid a hand on Harry’s arm before he could drink. “I’m not sure I want to have sex while you’re high on some potion.”
to flirt with you.” She elbowed Draco hard in the side, but he just glared at them both. “Wouldn’t you? Oh this is going to be so much fun.”
that felt good. Warmth eased through him, giving him a calm he could no longer call up on his own. It would last a short while—long enough for him to get food and potions.
Draco threw his fork down. “I’m sorry, but I’m too worn out to eat and I still have some Charms work to finish before exams. I’ll see you tomorrow.” With arms wrapped around himself, Draco left the Great Hall.
It didn’t matter because he wasn’t here to ask. Draco had been thrust into the decision-making role, and he had a whole houseful of people depending on him. How did this happen? How were they going to survive this? Everything seemed more dangerous now that Aurors appeared more and more often. How did he manage to escape Azkaban for being a Death Eater, only to be thrown back in for some form of kidnapping? And harbouring two underage werewolves.
“That much is obvious,” Ron answered without elaborating. He kissed Hermione’s cheek. “We’ll see you in the morning.” He slapped Harry on the back and guided him to their room. “Seems Harry needs a lesson in pureblood courting.”
“Trainee Potter,” Blakely said sharply, “what are you doing here? I told you to stay in the bullpen.”
Of course the back garden had to be as messy as everywhere else. Couldn’t anyone have tidied while Draco showed their ‘guests’ around? Quaffles, gloves, and flying goggles littered the grass, next to abandoned trays of bubble wands and soapy water. Croquet mallets were strewn about with (worryingly) not a single ball in sight. Did children ever actually
I almost forgot to post this today because my fic for the HP Rare Pairs 2021 fest posted as well today. Check out Draco and Dean here -
Harry whooped and yanked his t-shirt off, throwing it in the general vicinity of their other dirty clothes on his way to the bathroom. Draco kicked the shirt into the pile and added his own t-shirt and jeans. Ugh, their hike had made him sweaty in the worst sort of way. He peeled off his damp socks with a shudder.
Draco closed his eyes when he saw the familiar label on a familiar bottle of massage oil. “Please, for the love of Merlin, tell me you did
Why? Wasn’t that uncomfortable? Didn’t it pinch up his bits? Where did he even buy them? And pink? Seemed like grey or navy would suit his colouring better.
Draco stopped walking. When Greg paused as well, Draco waved him on with the group. He turned to Potter. “This isn’t about whether muggles are good or bad. Or whether wizards are better or the same. It’s about the Statute of Secrecy keeping us from muggles, and war trauma keeping us from wizards. It’s about belonging nowhere except the place we make for ourselves. Now if you’ll excuse us… I can’t keep you from following us in public, but I can bar you from Malfoy Manor.”
“Your father would be so proud,” Pansy whispered before dissolving into her own giggles. Draco tickled her and gave her cheek a loud, smacking kiss.
Harry dragged them into every single shop on High Street, looking for just the right thing to buy for Draco. When Harry declared that ‘something special’ to be a collection of muggle sweets, he thought Theo might explode right there in Honeydukes.
have an enlightening conversation about your shopping habits.” He tipped his hat with a malicious grin. “Have a nice day, Mr Malfoy. Perhaps we’ll be seeing you later.”
Draco looked between them and said to Ron, “You read fanfiction too? Harry said he would tell me about it but it never came up.”
Draco shrugged one shoulder, embarrassed at the praise. “I know. We’re all exhausted all the time but the kids are happy so it’s worth it. It’s good to see this place put to good use after…” He trailed off, knowing Potter could fill in his own details there. Thoughts of the war had Draco sinking his head into his hands. “They’re just so… innocent. All of them. I don’t think I was ever so innocent.”
“Just children,” Granger responded. Ignoring Blakely entirely, she focused on Draco. “Why were they on the streets? Why weren’t they placed in homes when their parents were arrested?”
“Good. That’s the goal.” Harry gave Draco an appraising look. “You look fantastic. I’m so glad I kept this and that it still fits.”
That didn’t sound like good news to Draco, but he didn’t want Greg to worry. He nodded his understanding and ushered Greg back to the lifts for the trip home.
“Anything your heart requires that the hotel can provide. Which, judging from the brochure, is just about anything. Full service, a modern day Room of Requirement. Except better because there’s food provided.”
Draco used to love inciting Harry’s jealousy back then. The possessive, biting kisses set Draco aflame, driven higher by the deep growls of
“That’s what we’re looking for—Ministry approval,” Draco said. He hoped he appeared calm, knowing that would only make Auror Blakely look more irrational.
She pulled the boy forward, but he stumbled and fell. Draco caught him before he hit the ground and gently laid him on the drive. “What happened to him?”
Draco’s heart stuttered and he dropped the snobby attitude. He glanced out the darkened window and reached for Harry. “At home? In our bed?”
“There are twenty-two children. Plus two that are seventeen, but still attending Hogwarts, and need somewhere to stay—”
But Harry didn’t mind. Especially when a wave of heat cascaded through him, and he came over both their fists. His hand dropped to his hip, while Draco kept stroking at his own cock.
They held the cat figurine together, and Harry managed a sweet kiss before it whisked them away to London.
“Agreed.” Draco shuddered as he quickly shut down any thoughts of Nagini and Voldemort hissing at each other in the Manor’s dining hall. “Just thinking about it makes me… Nope, French is loads more fun.”
“I can come back for it,” Draco said. “We can… we’ll always be friends. And… friends hang out together sometimes.”
“When I can. I always start with pictures online but I like to experience a thing before drawing it. It’s more vivid if I can see it and breathe it in and all.” He pulled a camera from his bag. “I’ll also take my own pictures, to jog my memory later.”
I stalk after Baz out to the middle of fucking nowhere, when he suddenly turns to me expectantly. He
for Draco later. But he’d already had enough of this round of hotel sex. He’d rather re-do the rickety desk chair that fell over yesterday.
“Don’t!” David yelled. “Don’t tell him where we are! If he knows, he has to say. Right now he can still sort of lie about it.”
“They can look after themselves,” Draco said, forcing a patience he did not feel. The sooner they could get off the platform, the happier he would be. He wanted the Littles as far from the wizarding world as he could get them.
“I’d like that.” Harry gave him a hopeful smile as he held the pot of floo powder out. “You’re always welcome here. Always.”
Draco frowned at Harry’s confusion. “The life debt that I owe you. Thirty days of service. I told him I’m only on day thirteen and I can’t spend hours brewing if you ask me to—”
Smashing the button for level two, Draco straightened his tie and his jacket. He ran a hand through his hair, and checked his wand was easily accessible. Fuck only knew what he’d find in the Auror department.
Before it even started downloading, Draco knew which one Harry would choose. They were both laughing, staring off camera at whoever was giving a speech at their reception. The mobile photo remained still, but the real one looped on them looking lovingly at each other and sharing a chaste kiss.
Draco had two or three inches of height on Harry, and all of that must be in his legs because the dildo was stuck to the wall just a little too high to be easy to reach. Harry stood on his tiptoes to line himself up and was just about to lower himself onto it when the door opened.
“I’ll come with you,” Potter said. Draco nearly protested, but given the roiling in his stomach, perhaps supervision for safe travel wouldn’t go amiss.
“Well I did a little research. Wanted to see why you’d do something like that,” Harry laughed nervously. “I ordered a few and liked it. So I bought more.”
Draco’s worn face broke into a wide smile when he opened the door. “Harry! I was wondering if you’d be stopping by.”
Harry wanted to hug him, but didn’t because he knew he could never manage the casual hug friends could share. And then found he didn’t need to because Draco grabbed him for a deep kiss.
impressive to be recognised out of the blue like that. I get a lot of praise at bookshops and libraries and schools. But that was the first time anyone approached me—me and not
Draco’s kisses began softly, lulling Harry into a gentle fog of desire. As the outside world faded away, the kisses turned hotter and more demanding, setting something uncontrollable loose in Harry. He rocked his hips up hard against Draco, wanting more,
The possessive fire shining in Harry’s eyes reassured him he had nothing to worry about on either score.
“Just… brace yourself for disappointment, all right?” He sighed. “And I hope you enjoy celibacy,” he added with an eye roll.
of a questionable nature are occurring in certain areas so that they may be dealt with appropriately.”
“What’re they doing here?” Greg asked. Roger climbed into Greg’s abandoned chair to hide, peeking between Greg and Jason to get a look at the group.
“We could spend the next five days completely naked if we wanted,” Harry said, playfully nipping at Draco’s lips.
“I had no idea I played such an important part in your big gay awakening. Hurts less to admit you were the same.”
And there was Harry, taking his hand and pulling him in for a twirling dance, making the robes flare out to let the silver embroidery catch the light. They shared champagne and laughing kisses. He remembered Harry’s hand around his waist as they talked with friends and shared a plate of hors d'oeuvres.
“Me too,” Draco whispered back. He glanced around, relieved to see no one else nearby. He’d never got in the habit of wearing muggle clothing. And seeing as the joggers and t-shirt he wore doubled as pyjamas sometimes, he felt exposed and ridiculous at the moment.
“Too late for Aurors to capture Death Eaters?” Pansy deadpanned. “Didn’t know we were on the clock. Theo’s right. Potter kept the secret.”
The first batch was an utter failure they didn’t even get to finish. The second batch was much improved, but still not good enough to drink. The third batch turned out perfectly.
“This picture… I can’t stop looking at it.” Harry scrubbed at his hair and rested his head on his hand. A familiar longing curled through him, but he did his best to ignore it as usual. One would think he’d be accustomed to losing the things he loved. “Even though it makes me miss you.”
“I-isn’t that a bit much?” Harry asked. “I mean, this is all rather new…” Not that he hadn’t already imagined Draco in bed. Naked. Too many times to count. But they’d only just started dating and surely they should build to that?
But of course he didn’t. He followed Draco to the school room, riling up all the children and eagerly sitting cross-legged between Lizzie and Libby in the story time circle. Potter sorted chunky wooden shapes by colour with the little children, and then helped Robbie with his first attempts at using a quill and ink. Draco tried to object when Potter pulled a bag of sherbet lemons from his pocket to share after lessons were through.
He squeaked when Harry shoved his wand at Draco’s eye. “Get that the fuck away from me!” Draco yelled. “You can’t just point your
Draco rolled his eyes and yelled over his shoulder, “You can finish Annie’s!” Greg scrunched up his face and Draco sighed. He shook his head at the woman behind the counter. “Better make that twelve or I’ll never hear the end of it.”
“It wasn’t terrible. It was a way of reminding him to take care of himself. To feed himself when he fed the plant.”
Blaise raised one eyebrow at him. “And just what do you think you can do with all those chastity spells in the way? Only Narcissa or Lucius can remove them.”
Who knew it would be Harry spluttering in embarrassment instead? “Shit. Fuck. Draco - I’m - just - shit.” Harry flailed in the shower stall, caught between wanting to cover himself, wanting to run away, and wanting to ease the ache in his still hard cock. He was trapped. With Draco in the doorway, he had nowhere to go, nowhere to hide. He pressed his forehead to the wall, his back to Draco, and sighed, “Merlin, I am so, so sorry.”
“What? We can’t even be alone?” Harry pulled the contract from his pocket and gave it a quick scan, but now wasn’t really the time for a close examination. “Why not, if there are chastity spells in place to prevent any… anything.”
Even if the impervious charm kept off most of the rain, it couldn’t do anything for the mud they walked through, nor the chill in the air. Harry cast a warming charm over Draco and had to let that take the place of physical affection.
“Draco?” he heard Pansy call. She came running around the corner. “Draco! Orion. Oh my sweet baby, are you all right?” She cooed at the baby, taking him from Draco’s arms. “We’ve been so worried!”
“I don’t know. Pansy said Aurors came and had a warrant and Ms Coddle in Charity Commissions says he’s in a safe home. But he isn’t, I
“Draco wait! Please!” Potter called softly. Against his better judgement, Draco halted on the path but didn’t turn around. Silence held between them for long enough that Draco almost started walking again. But then, Potter said, “I’m sorry. For adding another burden on your shoulders. I didn’t mean to and if we could… if we could just be friends. If you could just call me Harry… That would be enough.”
Draco smiled and kissed Harry lightly. “Just so long as you know you don’t need luck to get into my pants.”
I have to pretend, as I settle in for sleep, that I don’t want the cool weight of his body to keep the fire of my nightmares at bay.
When the spells dropped, Draco dressed Orion in a clean pair of pyjamas from his changing bag while the mediwitch filled out the paperwork. His poor baby moaned in his sleep.
Harry squirmed in his seat, “Erm, just two.” He started tearing the label from his beer bottle, wishing he had something more productive to do with his hands. “One meets in person monthly, and one meets weekly online.”
Twelve brightly lit candles sat evenly spaced in a circle around some large cushions in the centre of the lawn. Above them, Draco could see the wavering air of a warming charm fighting off the night-time chill.
“Well, since you went to all this trouble…” Draco said with a smile, banishing his cardigan to a patio chair. He started unbuttoning his robes as well. “This
“Depends on his family, I suppose. Wizarding laws about marriage only care about inheritance. Some families list
And then the fun began. They enjoyed food and dancing in the large ballroom. Everyone laughed at Blaise’s toast, lamenting the end of his favourite soap opera now that Harry and Draco were a boring married couple. In Ron’s toast, he congratulated them for surviving not just one near death experience after another, but the annoying quirks of their personalities as well.
Over the sounds of Potter’s protests, Draco flew back to the house, eager to reassure the children that everything would be all right.
Harry waited a full minute to be sure Malfoy wouldn’t return unexpectedly before he cautiously slipped out of the office and through the Ministry to his own office in the Auror department. He collapsed at his desk, heart racing while he tried to decipher what he’d seen.
There was only one invitation because only one person was invited. But Harry well knew that if he invited Draco, then Theo would have to come along. And that if Blaise wrote out the invitation, his nosy arse would show up as well. And if Blaise came, then Neville would follow. And if Neville came, Ron and Hermione would as well.
scarves? Where did you even find these?” Draco asked, unable to suppress his laughter. “Is sexy, schoolboy role-play on the list?”
“I mean it. Why would I want anyone else after knowing what it’s like to have you in my life? I’ve never loved anyone like I love you. And I know you know it.”
Harry’s eyes flew open. “What does it look like?” A creeping sense of shame turned his cheeks bright red. “Should I stop?”
Draco directed Mr Evergreen and Mr Buckthorn to the side yard where Daphne and Theo waited. The rest of them split up inside the house. Draco sent up one last mental plea to whatever gods were listening and began to walk Ms Coddle through the house once again. Auror Blakely wasn’t the least bit subtle about casting detection spells in every room they passed through. Ms Coddle did her best to ignore him and praised Draco for the welcoming, cheery home he’d created for the children.
“It’s fine,” Draco whispered, brushing a light kiss against Harry’s smiling mouth. “Engaged couples can kiss and hold hands.” He bit his lip. “Everything else… it can wait, can’t it?”
“A new toy?” Draco asked, intrigued already. He untied the bow and tore the paper away to reveal a make your own dildo kit. He snorted loudly at the completely unexpected gift. “Is this real? We’re going to
fooling around. I’d like to say I’d do anything you asked of me, but that would definitely be pushing it. I could never share you with someone else.”
“That’s what Draco said.” Harry crossed to his dresser and pulled out the flat jewellry box. “He said it was more of a ‘thank you for your kindness’ situation.” He held the box out to her. “So I bought this for you. To thank you.”
Harry nodded decisively. “All right. Let’s do this.” He clapped his hands together and stared at the box.
She bounced the baby, smoothing a hand over his fuzzy head. “I don’t know whether to be relieved or offended that we weren’t as well.”
With a flick of his wand, Draco conjured a handkerchief. “I’m sorry too. It must have been bad, to make you wish for foster care.” He smiled sadly as he resumed his seat. “No one wishes for foster care.”
“It’s nothing.” At her stern look, he held up his hands. “Nothing yet, anyway. We’re waiting for the results of the inspection.”
Temper tantrums and fearful crying wouldn’t reflect well on them so they did their best to prepare the children for the arrival of Charity Commissions on Thursday. According to the Commission’s letter, a team of Ministry employees would evaluate the well-being of the children, the paperwork they’d collected thus far, the suitability of the house and surrounding grounds, and the wards they had in place. The part that worried Draco was the Aurors that would be accompanying them.
What should he say to this fucking arse that set Draco free from a potential ten years in that hellhole?
They both laughed, knowing Draco didn’t really have any spirit of adventure. But he would do anything for Harry. “Only for you, my dearest.”
“If you think I’ll believe that a single butterbeer can get a twenty-five year old man drunk, you have another think coming.” Malfoy sidled closer to Harry and traced a finger down the condensation on his bottle and whispered, “On the other hand, if you think you’re sober enough, we can explore this a little more at mine.”
“It’s nothing unusual, of course. Three months of courtship following the traditional rules. In six weeks, I will return and see how you two are getting on.” She stared down her nose at Harry, despite being several inches shorter than him. “If you are deemed worthy of my son, we can begin discussions of a betrothal contract to follow.”
Draco took that as an invitation to bite Harry on the arse. He laughed at Harry’s tiny squeal. “Not likely!”
Pansy, Daphne, and Astoria met them at the door, gasping when they saw Robbie lying limp in Draco’s arms. “Oh Merlin, what happened to him?”
“Harry, my dearest husband.” Draco drew him in for a soft kiss in the elegantly appointed suite. “You’re mine now.”
“Not really.” Harry didn’t elaborate and made to return to his room. He certainly didn't want to have this conversation in front of everyone.
Harry laughed, “Judging by the Ravenclaw changing room, they’re all the same.” He tugged Draco’s hand. “Come on, we can snog later. Let’s get some hot tea and scones to ruin our lunch.”
Harry remembered that signing and the hour they’d spent talking to the little kids waiting for his reading. He’d had fun with colouring pages of his very own characters, and excited children talking about their favourite parts. But Ginny had wandered aimlessly and declared the hour wasted. Although she got along with children well enough, Ginny preferred loud outdoor games to quiet bookshop activities.
“It was ridiculous,” Ginny said with an eye roll. “Like we didn’t have ice cream melting in our trolley.” She elbowed Ron with a little nod, as though he might lend support.
He tried on some of the others, using a few small spells to make adjustments to the fabric so his dick wasn’t so squished. Some fabrics had more give than others. The black pair he’d tried on first remained his favourite of the lot. Boy shorts, just like Malfoy wore.
As he moved through the barrier, Draco cast a Notice-Me-Not charm so no one would notice the string of eleven children passing through. Daphne, wearing Orion in the sling, led them all, with Pansy and Theo walking on either side to help guide them. Greg brought up the rear, trying to keep Annie from getting distracted as she walked.
“Let’s get out of here before they charge us another galleon. We’ll get showered and cleaned up at home. Then I say we go out for dinner tonight with our saved ten galleons and then if we’re not too tired, we can fuck peacefully in our own bed.”
“I bought two pieces of pie but also couldn’t resist a sampling of other treats. Caramel macarons—how could I not, right?—chocolate cream puffs, cherry danishes, and baklava.”
He wrapped a hand around his hard cock, agreeing completely with the sensible reasoning his mind laid out for him. In the tiny, cramped shower, there wasn’t much room to move about. Harry’s elbows kept knocking the walls, and pulling the curtain askew. He had to conjure lube twice before he managed to do so in a way that didn’t immediately get washed away by the water. He hadn’t bottomed in a long time, and found the angles awkward for prepping himself, so he resorted to a spell instead.
“Oh Merlin, I am such an idiot.” Harry covered his face, which did indeed blush as tomato-like as the other Weasleys. Seeing his own face doing it’s regular thing was bizarre, enlightening, and hilarious for Ron.
He didn’t even realise he was crying until Potter drew him into a hug. “It’s going to be all right,” Potter whispered in his ear.
“Harry,” Draco whispered softly, his eyes wide in amazed wonder. He gave up on stroking himself inside his clothes and pushed his pyjamas down his thighs to free his cock entirely. Lightly he ran his fingers up and down his length, almost as if he wanted to display it for Harry.
“You definitely need to make her jealous,” Pansy interrupted. “I immediately volunteered. So we’ll flirt, and laugh, and at the end, I go home to Theo.”
“Maybe they don’t want a betrothal but like the fact that these charms keep you away from me,” Draco said, finally meeting Harry’s eyes. “It just keeps us in line until I’m safely tucked away at the Manor where you can’t get me at all.”
“Are you ever going to post yours?” Hermione asked, coming up beside him. “I had too many ideas, but finally settled on one.” She pointed to her own square —
fantasising about fucking you?” He opened the cupboard under the sink and handed Harry a clean flannel. “Here,” he said briskly, “get yourself cleaned up. I’ll take care of this.” A swish of his wand freed the dildo from the wall. “I’m going to find dry pyjamas. You can put these on.” He indicated the set still sitting on the countertop. “Get dressed. Dinner should be here soon. You’re probably as starved as I am.”
“I did.” Potter blew his nose loudly and vanished the handkerchief. Conjuring a new one of his own, he wiped his eyes clean. “I made up all sorts of stories about my parents coming to find me. That they hadn’t died in the car crash and it was all a misunderstanding.”
“At last, he has risen!” she yelled, making the children around whoop and clap. She checked her watch. “That’s… nineteen hours!”
It was difficult to plan an escape from the party when everyone had rooms right upstairs. But around midnight, no one seemed to expect them to stay any longer. Clinking glasses and cheers chased them from the ballroom so they could make their way to the honeymoon suite together.
that kept drawing us together is over. Fresh eyes on the situation really helped.” As frequently happened in new situations, he thought of Molly. “This would make a good Molly story.”
“When they publish my flavour of the week at Fortescue’s, he sells out and then I can’t get any.” Maybe a missed serving or two of lavender and earl grey ice cream seemed lame, but sometimes Harry needed it at the end of a long day. And he hated the vultures swooping in and stealing it from him.
Harry rolled his eyes. How dare she disparage his work when he’d tried so hard with very little artistic skill to draw from! “We’re eighteen—nearly nineteen—Hermione! It’s two
Draco closed his eyes briefly, trying to calm the sudden racing of his heart and the rage that burned in his lungs. “Yes, for war orphans,” he said flatly. “Excuse me.” He threw the robe over the rack and left the shop.
“Don’t get attached to people’s names. Undoubtedly your wife will have dated a Brad or an Andrew and will despise the name.”
Moments later, Andromeda Tonks came in looking every inch the well-bred, elegant witch in her expensive and flowing robes. She sat on Draco’s other side and rested her hand atop his while greeting Mrs Stokke. “Oh Hilde, it’s been ages, darling. How have you been? How is your Selma? Still causing mischief with her Oxford students, no doubt?”
as exciting as the date’s anticipated end, when he could finally show off his Gryffindor knickers to an eager audience of one.
Harry laughed and pulled his sketchbook from his bag. “I’ll certainly keep you around long enough to get chocolate baklava.” He opened the sketchbook to a blank page as he took in their surroundings. “This looks so much better than what I found online. Everything looked too perfect to be real.”
Draco grinned and gave him another chaste kiss on the lips. “Certainly not a scenario I ever imagined for us.”
“Are you sure you wouldn’t rather be rolling around on the bed?” Draco asked, holding his violin and bow.
thought a plant would teach him good habits.” Ginny crossed her arms and Harry wondered if that was solely to plump her breasts up for Harry to see. It must irk her to know that Pansy had her beat there. As if Harry cared either way.
just a few. Trust me, I could have spent twice that.” He handed her a pile of receipts. “It’s fine. There’s gold to cover it, right?”
“Me too. Angry sex is stupid,” Draco whispered, kissing lightly along Harry’s closed eyes and down to his lips. “I think what we need is comfort sex.” He took Harry’s hand and turned towards the bedroom. “Now.”
“Don’t get us kicked out,” Ron said, laying a hand on her arm. “Kreacher probably packed those little spinach tart things.” She rolled her eyes at him but stayed silent.
Draco smoothed back Harry’s damp hair and kissed along his temple and cheeks. “I love you too, Harry. More than anything. All of you.”
I have to admit that fucking in his Gothic childhood bed has some weird sex appeal, but then the second most precious voice in my life unexpectedly calls out, “Daddies, look what Grandma got me!” and we spring apart as though burned.
Harry took Draco’s hand. Friends could hold hands to offer comfort. “I’ve done my best, Draco, to not push the limit too hard. I don’t want you feeling caught between me and them. But we have to admit we can’t continue on like this indefinitely.”
While Harry tried to organise his thoughts around their whirlwind conversation, Ron came to sit next to him. “Looks like he said yes.”
I wrote the first one long ago because I thought it was sweet, all that nervous first-date bumbling. But now that I'm posting it, I wanted something hotter. So there's a bonus ficlet this week!
Today it felt like a ‘pro’ moment. Arriving at the pub early meant Harry could keep an eye on everyone that came in, and Draco wouldn’t be left awkwardly waiting on him.
When Draco dropped his last card in the centre pile, neither of them hesitated to slap the smaller discard deck. “Fucking hell!” Harry yelled, shaking his hand out as he got shocked yet again. “At least I got the pile this time.” He scooped up the cards and shuffled his set of cards for the next deal.
“I love them.” Draco replaced his ring and drew Harry in for a sweet kiss. “And I love you. And it would make me the happiest man on earth to marry you.”
More food, more food. How much more food? Draco should have asked how many more people there were before Daphne ran off. He grabbed a bag of grapes, a bunch of bananas, and a bag of baby carrots (even if carrots were tastelessly revolting), then searched out sweets.
Draco smiled and kissed his beloved with all the love in his heart. “Do you want to see mine?” he whispered. “How it felt when I knew? Or when you proposed?”
Draco’s breath left in a whoosh. A whole week of Harry with a tattoo across his chest. He’d offered to show Draco the designs he was considering, but Draco preferred to be surprised. And now the moment had come.
She smiled and tapped at her register. Draco paid, then added an extra ten pound note. “For the poor person who has to clean up after us,” he said with a wink. The woman smiled at him gratefully as she took the money.
“You’re here again?” Draco spluttered as Potter rolled through the floo mere seconds after Theo left for his interview with the Charity Commissions. “It’s bright and early on a Monday morning—shouldn’t you be in auror training?”
Draco stole a kiss, then picked up his parchments from the floor. “I don’t know why I let you do these things to me.”
Of course he knew. Harry had proved early on in their relationship that Draco belonged to Harry and no one else.
“Yes. Actually, it’s the thing on the list I’m most looking forward to.” Harry plucked a hair from his head and dropped it in his cup. The smoky liquid shimmered and turned gold.
This is inspired by my husband getting his first tattoo at the age of 41 and me giggling about it like a school girl at recess discussing her crush.
“Yeah, no, of course I don’t want you to lie to her or anything. I already have a ring and everything so I can stage some kind of fun, public thing.”
“Me too,” Harry said softly, also blinking teary eyes. “Draco… that was the moment I knew… I knew I wanted you to be mine forever. We were starting the new year and I thought, ‘I can’t end another year without making him mine.’”
Daphne Greengrass smothered a shriek and turned to Draco with wild eyes. “Draco? Fucking Merlin! You scared the shit out of me.” She huffed a sigh and pressed a hand to her heart. “What a surprise to see you.” Her other hand clenched at her side, trying to hide the bulge of the apple in her pocket.
The next day, Harry invited Draco to lunch at the Hog’s Head. Theo’s face when they walked into the shabby pub would be a treasured memory. For a second, Harry thought he might back out and decide the chastity spells would have to suffice for chaperoning. But Theo steeled his spine and followed them in after all, eyeing the riff-raff at the bar with suspicion. Harry almost laughed at Theo sitting so stiffly in his chair, not touching, eating, or drinking anything at all for fear of food poisoning or worse. He could probably reassure Theo that Aberforth kept things cleaner than they looked, but his skittishness served Harry’s purposes just fine so he let it slide.
“Harry! Fuck! Are you all right?” Draco’s hands clenched in the air above Harry’s shoulders, since he couldn’t actually grab hold of him. “Say something!”
She gave him a cheerful wave as he left, heading to the pharmacy. Although he knew Mr Preston enough to nod a polite hello, they did not make small talk like he did with Sherri. He did get an odd look when he purchased thirteen tubes of toothpaste, thirteen bottles each of shampoo and conditioner, and twenty-six bars of soap. Hmm, perhaps he should have spread these purchases out over the coming weeks, but too late now. On a whim, he added several bottles of nail polish, knowing the girls would miss Pansy’s supply when they left.
“Thank you,” Draco said politely. “Really, thank you. We appreciate all your help. He might have died if the Wilsons had been slower about bringing him.”
Draco’s eyes widened. “Okay that was a lot.” He looked at Ron, then back at Harry. “I’m not sure what to say to you while you look like Ron Weasley.”
He cast a mild Notice-Me-Not Charm as he made his way to the bulletin board. For almost a minute he stood with clammy hands, just staring at the lower right corner. A hand touched his back, curling around his waist as familiar bushy brown hair tickled his cheek. On his other side, stood Ron, hands in his pockets and face excited and expectant.
“Come here,” Harry said softly, as an invitation. Draco set the violin on the bed and climbed up next to Harry. “Are you hard?” he asked uselessly with the answer tenting the front of Draco’s pyjamas.
He got to the infirmary as Draco and Theo were dismissed. “Are you all right?” Harry asked, frantically checking over Draco, even though he knew he must be fine if Madam Pomfrey let them go.
Harry blocked off a section of the shoreline, to prevent any random students from eavesdropping. Most of them would be at lunch in the Great Hall but one could never be too careful. He set out a few picnic blankets and the basket of food, then smoothed out his dress robes and waited for everyone to arrive.
“Lady Malfoy,” Harry said with a welcoming smile, despite his churning stomach. He almost wished he hadn’t eaten that sandwich. “I’m glad you came.”
Only, later never arrived. When the group returned to the common room, Theo prevented Harry from pulling Draco aside (metaphorically, since he couldn’t actually
. “This doesn’t mention pyjama bottoms and all I’m saying is you’d best be wearing pants at the very least, wanker, because I don’t want either of your naked dicks near my pancakes.”
Grumbling under his breath, Draco dumped his suitcase next to Harry’s and joined him in the kitchen. Instead of sitting in his seat at the table, he straddled Harry’s lap and buried his head in Harry’s neck like a small child.
“I think the target audience is thirteen year old girls, so I don’t really want to say yes. It’s a little sappy and I don’t know when Annabelle and Charles managed to fit in the sex they must have had—”
“It’s over,” Harry said. He tugged Draco into a rough hug and laughed loudly. “It’s over and I’m free.” Louder, to the room at large, he yelled, “I’m free! No more training or stupid uniforms!”
One afternoon in mid-July, Theo and Draco supervised a game of tag outside in the garden. Draco pulled out four brooms from a shed, and distributed them to the older children. They had to set a timer on taking turns because everyone wanted a ride.
Draco got to his feet, weaving only slightly. “If the Ministry finds out, they’ll be institutionalised. Or—or put down,” he said, his stomach lurching at the thought. The Ministry didn’t have a good track record with werewolves in general, and even worse for minors. “And right now, they’ve taken the baby left in our custody. I need a name and I need it today so we can get him back.”
So as a bonus for everyone that's already read the full fic, here's a six sentence Dev/Niall follow-up.
His grin makes butterflies flutter in my stomach but it’s the way his fingers rifle through the popcorn that sets my blood running south.
“I’m a singer,” Pansy said, tilting her chin up as though begging someone to doubt her. “Mostly small, local gigs.” Harry noticed Draco’s eyebrow quirking up and the small smile he tried to hide. But he didn’t question Pansy’s line of work and Harry couldn’t be sure if it was a lie or not.
He waved to Seamus’s cousin Fergus, co-owner of Incognito, standing behind the bar, and made his way to the usual spot to wait on the usual group to arrive. The advantage to knowing the owners meant a spot reserved for them every week in a pub less crowded than the Leaky Cauldron. The others trickled in over the next twenty minutes, curious about the two seats Harry was holding for two new friends.
Harry sat in the other chair and nervously smoothed out his trousers. The chair squeaked a little every time he moved and he wondered why no one had bothered to fix it with a spell or two. “You look nice,” Harry said after a long minute of awkward silence.
“It was a good day twelve, wasn’t it?” Draco asked, hovering in Harry’s doorway for a kiss goodnight. They stepped aside to let Ron by.
“You’re a killjoy.” Harry reached for the buttons of Draco’s robe. “But fine. We can have clothes sometimes. For now, though… Let’s get you out of these robes.”
Harry stood to wash out the shampoo, grinning as suds ran down his body. His fingers chased them over his chest. “Mm… sexy suds… Do I look like something out of a magazine?”
Two weeks later, they were a hefty group of twenty-eight children ranging from baby Orion and toddler Annie all the way up to Draco and his friends. They set up a schedule of chores to help Pickles and Dowdy get the Manor cleaned up and catch up on laundry. Several children were eager to learn to cook literally anything other than cold sandwiches and cheese toasties.
Draco giggled and signed his own name below Harry’s. A warm ribbon of magic swirled around them both and disappeared. Tentatively, Draco reached a finger out to caress the back of Harry’s hand.
“Changed into what?” Draco asked as he dug through the basket. Ping pong balls, a bag of marshmallows, plastic cups… This evening was going to be interesting for sure.
The rest of the day passed with Draco watching in bemusement as they did nearly everything exactly as they always did, just ramped up a tiny bit. Breakfast at the café instead of at home. Shopping at the farmer’s market down the road from the café, instead of the shops near home. An outdoor lunch in their back garden instead of their well-lit kitchen.
Draco read his parchment and felt his face heating up. “When was the first time you wanked over me? Ugh… I think I’m going to hate this.”
He almost cried in relief when Harry’s body reacted the same way to Hermione that it had to Ron hugging him. He hugged her a second time, bemused at the strange feel of her in these different arms.
Harry kissed Draco’s fingertips. “So are you.” He hugged Draco closer and adjusted them so he could rest his head on Draco’s shoulder. “Want to nap with me?”
Theo and Hermione groaned loudly, while Neville, Blaise, and Ron began to giggle like small children.
“You bought the orchid?” Draco tilted his head, his brow furrowed. “Wait, haven’t you known Harry for ages? Shouldn’t you know better than to give him a plant he can’t take care of?”
Greg flipped him two fingers and followed the secretary to the conference room. Draco groaned, hoping that Greg had better manners for Mr Whitehead. And that he didn’t do anything stupid to jeopordise their position. He shouldn’t have listed Greg as a board member, but he felt guilty leaving him off for being a little thick. Greg meant well, so long as someone could point him in the right direction.
“Also,” Harry said, “Draco and I will be having our private meetings on Wednesday and Saturday evenings at eight o’clock.”
Slipping on his jeans, that was what. With his regular clothes on, no one would be able to tell at all what he wore underneath. His cock swelled, thinking of his own naughtiness and how no one would even know. Was that what Malfoy liked about it? It certainly gave Harry a rush.
“We’re eighteen years old,” Theo protested, rolling his eyes. “I can assure you they’re looking for reasons to shut us down.”
Harry pursed his lips as he thought that over. “All the same… I thought we were dating. I thought you were my boyfriend.” He hated how petulant he sounded when Draco was the injured party here.
They’d be portkeying to London in the morning and this was their last chance to check off ‘fuck on the Hogwarts Express’ from Draco’s bucket list. Harry was not going to admit how hot this turned out to be, considering how much trouble they’d be in if they got caught.
“Not this time.” Draco kissed Harry quickly and then left for their room, unbuttoning his robes along the way.
ideas. Almost daily, Draco complained about being paired with Theo instead of Blaise. But Blaise found Neville far more easy going than his uptight Slytherin friends and refused to switch with either of them.
“After the Felix Felicis, I feel like I’m already living my best life. Nothing more I could want.” Harry stepped back and slapped Draco’s arse lightly. “Except you cleaned up and relaxed and ready for dinner. Afterwards I’ll rub your feet for you and seduce you in front of a large mirror hanging over our bed.”
Draco smiled and kissed Harry gently. But Harry, caught up in memory, pressed Draco back against the sofa in a much deeper kiss.
“I—I guess my trainee robes got me through the system?” Potter asked, not sounding nearly apologetic enough. “I just wanted to ask you a few questions. Casually. Off the record.”
“Thrilled to be the one to burst your bubble, but it absolutely is. All those kids in there have one story or another about their parents imprisoned or disappearing, and the Ministry casting them out. They’re safe here and the Ministry will have them back over my dead body. Now get the fuck out and don’t come back.”
They spread the sweets and snacks out over two tables and enjoyed a massive picnic on the lawn. In one week, their numbers would be reduced by almost half, and Draco didn’t want to think too hard about that.
Horrified, Harry’s tongue unfroze just enough for him to croak out, “We were—it was—just—how did you even find out?!”
“I like being deviant with you.” He rolled onto his side and rested his hand near Draco’s. “One day we’ll be deviant together again.”
“Ha!” Harry laughed, pulling out some nipple clamps. “I forgot we had these. I don’t remember them being as much fun as we thought.” He squeezed each of the alligator clips, making them look like puppets talking to each other.
He kissed the top of Harry’s head and they whiled the afternoon away in half-sleep and soft caresses.
Neville’s face turned bright red and he stammered, “We’re not… That’s not why he’s here! He just wants to talk to you where Theo can’t hear.”
“I met the witch my parents found. Couldn’t avoid it really since they invited her to dinner without telling me. Her name’s Regina and she’s actually a very nice witch.”
“Go ahead and laugh. But you know it’s a good idea.” Draco bumped their shoulders together. “They’ll let you in the Aurors anytime you want. It doesn’t have to be now.”
“Can I wear your shirt? Because you smell nice and I want to smell nice too. Like coconut or something.”
Draco kissed Harry softly, then trailed his lips along Harry’s jaw to whisper sweet nothings in his ear in a language he couldn’t understand.
“Yes, I’m aware but you know Harry said Winky’s shown interest in leaving Hogwarts and officially joining our ranks. She wants to serve a house and family again. And then we can take in three more.”
Draco covered his mouth in surprise, then tentatively reached a finger out to trace over the rings. “Harry, these are gorgeous! When did you pick them out?”
Draco brought his knee up to cradle Harry between his thighs. “Do you think anyone else could fuck me like you do? You have to know you’ve ruined me for anyone else.”
But he’d already mourned the loss and moved on. And now, he had a new plan in mind for how to get Draco back in his bed.
There wasn’t much time to debate it, and Draco tried to keep in mind his own fun on the horizon. “Fine,” he grumbled.
!” He could hardly draw breath from laughing so hard. “Can you imagine shouting that out into the garden for the neighbours to hear? Beans! Toast! It’s time to come in!”
Draco’s eyes darted to Potter’s. When he nodded in encouragement, Draco said, “Yes, but when I applied, I was told it could be a year or more. That new applications weren’t being considered just yet.”
Draco rolled his eyes and plucked Harry’s hand away, saying, “I bought your drink and I can assure you it’s fine.”
In an embarrassingly short time, Harry came down Draco’s throat with the words, “I think I love you,” echoing through the empty room, straight into Draco’s heart, and sending him over the edge into pure bliss.
“Right now? Harry it’s…” He glanced back but couldn’t see the clock from where he laid on the sofa. “Really late right now.”
Auror Blakely and Harry glared at each other, then Harry set Blakely’s wand in the centre of the table. Blakely snatched it up and holstered it with a huff.
“I wonder what it looks like inside,” Draco said idly. “It’s probably been decorated at least once or twice by now.”
The next morning, he dragged a blanket out to the common room to read the last little bit by the fire. Draco and Theo sat at one of the tables with textbooks open. Ugh, homework on a Sunday was just the worst, Harry thought as he settled in his armchair.
Draco laughed so hard, tears gathered at the corners of his eyes as he yanked it from Harry’s hands and turned it all around. “Bloody fucking hell, where did you even find this? I thought we got rid of this ages ago!”
likely to put out later. Wouldn’t it be sexier if they were sharing a broom instead? He brightened at that thought.
Pansy’s eyes met Draco’s and he nodded. “Many of the parents will be out of Azkaban within five years,” she said shakily. Auror Blakely sneered, but she kept on. “We’ve included estimated expenses if anyone needs to stay here for a time. To get back on their feet.”
Harry’s cock throbbed at the hint of challenge in Draco’s voice. He’d never wanked for someone before, not like this. Which was a ridiculous thought as Harry had never been caught about to fuck himself on someone else’s dildo. But he couldn’t deny that the thought of Draco watching him sent a thrilling wave of desire through him.
“Fuck no! This isn’t a view for anyone else. It’ll have to be just mental pictures.” Harry held his hands up to his face, framing Draco between L-shaped fingers. “Click and click. There, stored away forever. Don’t even need a pensieve.”
make me laugh when I’m furious with you! Did you hear what I said? My mother said ‘lover’s semen’ to me, Harry!”
Draco couldn’t remember the last time he’d felt such a hot spark of anticipation. Each day Harry arrived after Auror training (or earlier, if he randomly decided to cut his training short—why hadn’t they kicked him out? Oh right, he was
Harry nearly crashed them to the ground in his haste to get off the broom. “Yeah, so I changed my mind.”
“Of course. Please, come in.” Ron shot Harry a wide-eyed look, then quietly left the two of them alone.
Through the crush of dancers, I see another couple watching us—watching his hand stroking my cock inside my loose jeans—and all my nerves dissolve. Nothing could make me stop what’s about to happen, especially when he whispers, “You are so hot,” and grinds his hardening cock against my arse.
Pansy and Daphne spelled two of the cellar storage rooms clean, and Draco and Greg furnished them with soft bedding that would likely be shredded by two werewolf pups. But on the off chance the potion worked, he wanted them to have somewhere comfortable to rest through the night.
that Sherri insisted worked just fine. She’d also dug up a bag of animated films from the back of the shop that the children might find of interest.
Draco’s offended face made Harry wish he could take back those words. “No, it’ll be our little secret.” He gave Harry a small smile, “Because I’m good at keeping secrets.” He paused, “Oh. Secrets. Is that what you thought I meant when you first asked me out? I honestly meant my—my office. You can still use it, if you want.”
For the next game, they stacked ten cups into a pyramid for each of them. They had to blow up a balloon and use the balloon’s escaping air to knock over all ten of their own cups. But they couldn’t stop giggling and pointing the balloons at each other, which led to play-fighting and jostling the table enough that the pyramids fell over mostly on their own.
Harry almost laughed at the formal language. Who the fuck said ‘post haste’ anymore? But Draco’s stomping off to his room without a goodnight to anyone didn’t bode well. Neither did Theo grinning with malicious glee.
“Unbelievable! I leave you alone for three minutes and already someone’s moving in. I guess I don’t have to worry about you being lonely after I die.”
Without gloves, they only made it twice around the pitch before Draco said, “My hands are cold. Do you mind?” He lifted the hem of Harry’s t-shirt a little.
“I don’t care. We’re only allowed out of the castle once a week and I’m taking advantage of it. I want to buy a present for Draco. Something special.”
“What?!” Harry said sullenly, dragging his eyes from the tattoo of vines twining up Malfoy’s forearm that he can barely see from across the steamy classroom.
“Good. Just checking. I’ve heard it’s the most common type of fantasy.” Harry dragged his lips along Draco’s neck, sucking a tiny love bite into the sensitive skin. Then he sat up, shaking his head. “But it holds absolutely no appeal to me. This seemed fun though, don’t you think?”
Sitting through Malfoy’s new spell seminar felt like an impossible task after Ron’s impeccable timing with a dick-as-wand joke. Each snobbish “No, no, it’s thrust the wand
As the children ran around the yard in a typical disorganised game of football, Pansy sat with Daria, Annie, and Draco. She helped Daria plait flowers into Annie’s hair. “Do you think he’ll report back to the Aurors?” Pansy whispered.
The door flew open and Harry chased Draco inside the moderately priced (ugh, as if they weren’t both wealthy beyond imagining and could afford better, but alas their impromptu holiday coincided with a conference) hotel room, straight to the bed. Harry’s body covered his and Draco almost gave in to the questing hands and the hard cock pressing into his hip.
“You see?” Potter said quietly. “It’s just a name, Dromeda. I promise. You won’t regret it.” He bit his lip, his eyes dropping to the baby with a sad smile.
“Of course not,” the man said soothingly. “It’s just standard procedure. You’re in room two. Lifts are down the hall to the left or stairs are on the right. There are showers and a sauna on the second floor if you need it. Enjoy! And please let me know if I can be of any help.”
Without waiting for a reply, Draco dragged Harry across the office and enclosed them in a soundproof bubble.
“You don’t have to do this,” Draco said, his voice low enough only Harry could hear. “We could… could…”
“If we act out violently against the Ministry,” Draco insisted, “they’ll just lock us up with our parents, and where would the Littles be then?”
Harry sat back to pull off his t-shirt. “Take your clothes off. I want to see.” He kicked his pyjama bottoms to the floor.
blocking the spray of water. It hit Draco square in the face, making him splutter over the sound of Harry’s laughing. Wretch. Draco shoved his hands into Harry’s hair, tugging aggressively in payback. A worthless effort, since Harry actually liked a little hair pulling. A few strands stuck to his fingers and he wrinkled his nose as he rinsed them away.
“Oh Annabelle,” Draco said, shaking his head as he read the invitation she mooned over for entirely too many pages. “Well, if the perfect Annabelle couldn’t make it to her wedding, I don’t feel so bad about not making it to mine.” He handed the book back. “But it was sweet, wasn’t it?”
“Here let me… Like this.” Draco held the base, keeping himself upright and still. A drop of pre-come pooled at the tip and Harry longed to lick it off.
Maybe it was too soon, but Harry had years of isolation to make up for. It wasn’t his fault he’d been fighting for his life instead of learning the ins and outs of snogging during his teenage years. He had a pretty, willing boy that wanted it more than he did. He could process everything later.
“Just like on our honeymoon, hence…” He spread his hands over the food. “Remember wandering the French countryside and the random picnics we’d share under a brilliant blue sky?”
Draco started unbuttoning his robe. “Excellent. My favourite prize from my favourite person. Let’s get changed.”
“Is it fucking?” Draco asked, rolling his eyes with the certainty that Harry’s perfect day involved no clothes at all.
Draco sighed, and then almost choked on it when Potter pulled him into a hug. He slapped Draco on the back then stepped back, a light flush on his cheeks.
Draco sighed. “The Aurors are circling closer every day. I’d hate to think what’ll happen if they find a spot to land. Which reminds me, I need to send an owl to my solicitor.”
time.” Draco tapped the second book. “The life debt gave me an excuse to take the things I’ve always wanted.”
“I believe the situation is under control. The Aurors insisted on special paperwork being filed—which I’ve already taken care of—and special approval by the Wizengamot. There’s no reason to expect a rejection. It’s just all taking a bit longer than I anticipated.”
His hand whacks the bowl, sending the melted (and thankfully only warm, not scorching) butter soaking into my shirt.
Harry’s imagining of what it must feel like made his own cock throb in his pants. He knew Draco could feel each breathy exhale on his sensitive skin and was probably remembering Harry’s mouth around him as he played his violin that night. They shared so many memories of pleasure, and yet not enough. Cut short by seventeen days.
“Yeah,” Harry said, swaying into Draco. He shook himself. Bed. He was going to bed. They could snog more tomorrow. “Not so early tomorrow, all right?”
Ugh, fine. Draco through his hands up in the air and sighed in frustration. “I’m learning, all right? Just like you.”
“The sorting hat’s about to sing any minute,” Draco said, nibbling Harry’s ear in the empty Entrance Hall, “but I thought we could take advantage of everyone being at the feast and head to the library...”
Harry’s gaze darted to the door as it opened on two people that looked like they’d stepped from an outdoor clothing ad. The woman laughed merrily as she came through the door, tugging on the hem of her bright Fair Isle jumper and tossing a thick braid of shiny, black hair over her shoulder. Behind her came a tall man in an Aran cabled sweater, with medium length blond hair draped across his forehead, cheeks turned rosy from the cold, and a small smile. The man’s eyes immediately sought Harry’s corner.
“There’s a café near my flat that makes a delicious key lime pie, if you’d like to join me sometime?” Draco offered this up hesitantly, watching Ron and Harry for signs that he’d made the right move.
Draco rolled his shoulders. “Mostly. I had to transfigure it a little, but I think it’s all right.” He turned a circle for Harry to see, and barely finished before Harry’s hands made their way inside to tease at Draco’s bare skin. “And you?” Draco slid his hands over Harry’s arse. “Did you work a little magic to get these jeans to fit?”
“Sod off already, I said I’m going!” Harry stuck his tongue out at Ron and hurried across the eighth year common room before he could retaliate.
“Always. Forever.” Harry didn’t know where his jacket ended up and he’d lost the bowtie long ago. He began unbuttoning his shirt. “This feels so new. We’ve never been together like this.”
Draco summoned their newest book of erotic retellings of fairy tales and they settled themselves more comfortably together on the sofa. As he neared the end of the first story, Harry’s hand slipped under the waistband of Draco’s pyjama bottoms. He caressed Draco’s skin almost absently. Rather than arousing, he simply enjoyed testing the different textures Draco’s body offered.
“We can do homework later… If you don’t want pie from the elves, how about we bake some biscuits? That sounds like fun, doesn’t it? Maybe we can ice them too! I never got to do anything like that before.”
“I’m not getting involved with Malfoy and a passel of Death Eater children.” She took the baby to a table in the corner and began changing his nappy. She tsked fondly when the baby tried rolling away from her.
Harry kissed the top of Draco’s head and caressed the bare skin of Draco’s waist. “Ready to head home?”
Draco scrubbed at his face. “I’ll get him back, I promise. All right? I need another Wide-Eye potion.” The ground seemed to pitch under his feet and he latched onto Pansy to keep himself upright.
“I’d like to see their bedrooms now,” Ms Coddle interrupted. She smiled at Annie. “Would you like to show me your room?”
As Harry’s sweaty body collapsed onto Draco, he huffed a tired laugh into Draco’s shoulder. “That was just… so, so good.”
Greg came over and picked Elyon up, then slapped Bryce on the back. “We’ll take good care of him. Don’t you worry.” Elyon buried his face in Greg’s neck as he returned to the group, with Greg whispering words of reassurance in his ear.
“All right, my drunken fool, let’s get you to bed.” Draco cast a featherweight charm on Harry to make him easier to guide through their cottage.
After a few pieces, Draco bowed with a flourish and stowed his violin. “What now?” He sat next to Harry, leaning forward expectantly.
“It was that fucking dragon in fourth year. The way you flew and outsmarted her. You were brilliant and suddenly, all my disinterest in the boys’ talk about the girls in our year made more sense. And I hated you for it.”
“Er, no…” he lied. “It was...” In truth he’d replaced that orchid twice already, but couldn’t be bothered a
“You’re doing the same, trying to hold all this together by yourself. Aren’t you supposed to be leaning on the others more?”
Kneeling side by side in front of the coffee table, they started bouncing their ping pong balls. They went absolutely everywhere, and were tricky to summon back so that they didn’t accidentally summon any from the carton. Harry had an early lead, but clearly grew distracted by Draco’s
Draco shut the shower off and angrily dried his face and body. “You’d better be.” He shouldered past Harry to the bedroom, and dug through his drawer of clothes.
“I always wanted to fuck around on this train.” Draco bit Harry’s lip and gave Harry’s cock a hard squeeze. “And this is my last chance. I’m almost there, love. Go faster… so good…”
That evening at eight o’clock, Harry knocked at Draco and Theo’s door again. Good, Theo still looked disgruntled. He’d had a miserable morning and now he was missing his precious chess club. Hopefully he’d whine to Blaise about it soon.
Draco couldn’t help but laugh at Potter’s teasing. “Maybe we can… Let’s re-evaluate in two weeks, when the results of the inspection come in.”
“I think you’ll find that Draco is entirely above board, and providing a welcoming home for the children at Malfoy Manor.”
He didn’t wait to watch them walk away. Bursting into the shop, he called for Sherri and the box she’d set aside for him. He had to get home quickly, before the Aurors appeared. It broke his heart that Sherri had a hard time meeting his eye as he dumped the pharmacy bag inside and carried it to his bike.
“Am I not allowed in the village for some reason?” Draco forced his limbs to keep still, in the hopes he could avoid questions about the bulging bag in his hand.
“Oh.” Harry crossed his arms over his bare chest, feeling all the more awkward for the nakedness. “So you don’t… that was just a fluke. That I saw you.”
“Only if you want to go on a date.” Harry fiddled with his beer mat, trying to avoid eye contact. “Otherwise it’s just, you know, a meal we share as friends. Because sometimes friends have dinner together.”
“All of them?” Draco asked, quirking his eyebrow just to make Harry grin. “You know I like it a little rougher than you do. Are you ready for that?”
“Hadn’t planned on it,” he murmured, sitting up to let me snuggle in behind him on the sofa, with eyes glued to his phone, “but my favourite author just posted a new thing.”
Although he wasn’t sure why he bothered. The tiny bottle seemed determined to keep hold of whatever conditioner it held. But he managed to squeeze out enough and massaged it gently through Harry’s gorgeous locks. A few days without the products Draco bought for him wouldn’t cause much damage, but Draco missed the citrusy scent of their regular shampoo and conditioner.
