, Draco.” Harry groaned, bucking wildly into Draco’s mouth. Draco let Harry hold his head in place and fuck his mouth, still placing licks and small hums whenever he could.
Distantly, he heard Mrs. Weasley trying to calm them down, but he ignored her.
The happy little smile on its face made Draco’s heart clench.
was the one who kidnapped him? Hades, lord of the dead and ruler of the Underworld?
The man
“You guys shouldn’t worry. Once I do my puppy eyes face, he’ll forget all about it.”
Draco scarfs down his food in record time.
Harry froze in his tracks.
“Harry, you really don’t have to.” Draco blushed.
He silently cursed the witch and himself too. He had been very foolish when he was younger; he couldn’t afford it now.
He crossed his legs and leaned back on his arms, not missing the way Harry’s cock jumped in his joggers. Draco smirked. Harry was probably too proud to admit that he was hard.
The heavenly smell of the ambrosia cakes made Draco’s mouth water, and before he could stop himself he stuffed one into his mouth. He nearly groaned out loud; the sweet taste of ambrosia and the soft bit of nectar were simply
“What do you want Cedric?” He asked, exasperated. Cedric was always running after him and didn’t seem to get the hint that Draco wasn’t interested in him. His ego was probably too big for him to notice.
“Who is this?” Cedric’s knuckles turned white as he gripped the handle of the mirror hard.
“You’re alive.” Lucius smiled widely, tears dripping from his eyes. “You’re alive.”
Kore snarled and moved in front of him again. He looked quite similar to an angel in his rage, with his glowing grey eyes, his long blond hair, his perfectly unblemished skin.
Terry looked at him in disbelief, before suddenly smiling coldly.
“And now he just called me and said that he was sorry and he wants to meet up at eight.”
“My classes are alright.” Ron said, spraying food bits everywhere. Hermione smacked the back of his head.
“Dad-” He started. Before he could finish, Harry’s mother walked up to him and slapped him. Hard. The sound echoed throughout the house.
Most of the comments he was seeing went for the second option.
bragging rights over the other nymphs who annoyed him.
“I would really appreciate if you could get me some healing potions.”
Draco shrugged. It wasn’t any of his business. As long as he got paid, he didn't care. He plopped himself down onto the grass, marveling at the feel. Harry sat next to him.
“I’m busy, love. I’ll be done soon, I promise,” Draco curled his lip and crossed his legs from where he was sitting on the desk, his arse not two feet away from Harry’s face. He was in a snit again, not that Harry could blame him. For the past few days, he had been loaded with paperwork from
"I'm not surprised. You seem like the type who just plays any random episode at any random time."
!” Draco cried out, bucking wildly on the desk. Harry pressed down on it even harder, making Draco instinctively close his legs and clamp down on Harry’s fingers. Harry smacked his arse again and shoved his legs back open.
“I can’t believe it.” Harry gaped at his reflection. His hair looked…
“I knew it! It’s Harry, Draco, I’m telling you!”
If anyone wants to take over, feel free to email me about it.
“And I love you too,” Harry whispered back.
Draco smiled and leaned back into Harry’s embrace as he stirred the simmering pot of soup on the stove. “Coq au vin.”
In the rest of the hour, he dabbed the crushed mulberries onto his lips, lined his eyes with powdered charcoal and soaked his hands, legs and hair in basins of goat milk, rose petals and rosemary. He dried his hair with a warm wind and wore it loose, only tucking a small lotus flower behind his ear. He rubbed his ears and wrists in spring water infused with the fragrance of lilies and jasmines. Then, he rubbed powdered gold onto his cheeks, just to give them an extra shine. Lastly, he slipped on his crown and charmed the cloudberries stems to sprout their sunset red and pumpkin orange berries.
Besides, even if he did it wasn’t like anyone would-
“Here’s some tea! It should help you feel better.” She chirped. Draco’s smile widened, and he gracefully picked up Ginny from the cart. He sat up marginally, enough for him to be able to raise his head well. The beast hissed but didn’t say anything. Draco ignored it.
“Harry,” he pleaded weakly, collapsing onto the chair and onto his come. Harry continued for several seconds, before finally letting up. He hushed Draco’s small moans and dragged him into his lap, rubbing his back as the aftershocks of his orgasm slowly faded away.
” He screamed, trying his best to fight his way out. He
They spent the next hour eating, drinking, laughing and talking happily. It was easily the best date of Draco’s life, even though they were both in sweatpants and old T-shirts.
not because Harry was tired of seeing them pine hopelessly for each other). That was centuries ago! Of course she just
"I said don't laugh!"
Once he had grabbed a decent amount of food and at least three knives, he ran out of the kitchen into the main dining room. There were suits of armor guarding the room, but they were at the walls so he was able to dodge all their attempts to catch him. He pulled the door open and slipped out before they could hold him.
“What? What did I do?”
He’s wearing a thong. A fucking
He sped up all the stairs until he got to his room. He shut the door and sat on his bed, hugging the mirror to his chest. Thankfully Pansy was dozing, so he had the room all to himself.
Once he was done, He propped the camera on the stand on his room and backed up to show the commenters. He posed a bit before grabbing his phone again and reading the comments. They all seemed to like it.
“You have to eat first.” It said firmly.
room, he internally braced himself.
“I enjoyed hanging out with you too.” He smiled at the blond. “I’ll text you once I get home.”
In a split-second, Cedric’s two cronies walked up to Draco and pinned his arms behind his back, ignoring the blond’s cry of outrage and his angry kicks.
Harry started to vibrate his fingers against Draco’s prostate rapidly, stimulating his cock and sending large dribbles of precum onto the carpeted floor. Harry knew from Draco’s ragged breaths that he was close to coming. With that thought in mind, he applied even more pressure.
For the rest of the time, he chatted with his followers as he painted his nails light blue, fluffed his hair, and put on his black eyeliner. He put on a faux nose ring for good measure. Finally, thirty minutes before they were meant to meet up, Draco ended the live stream and got ready to leave. Even though he had a driver’s license, he was too nervous to drive today so he just asked Dobby to take him there.
“I’ll take that as a yes, hm?” Without further ado, the man (Draco… Malgoy? Malfroy? Well, his name certainly didn’t matter anymore, as far as Harry was concerned) shoves a permanent marker into his (quite shaky) hands and
He sat up abruptly, frowning when his head felt strangely light. He reached up and gasped.
Harry feels his heart leap into his chest. He immediately taps on it and opens the message, not even stopping to consider if it’s real or not.
"Yes."
He somehow found himself walking towards the cell, with Granger trailing after him, still spewing occasional warnings that Draco paid no attention to. Draco had only ever seen him on TV or in newspapers, and he would not pass up the chance to look at him in real life because of Granger’s big mouth.
‘Hey. You’re Draco, right?’ He typed. A few seconds later a reply came.
The Malfoys had been very rich, but when Draco was still a toddler, a great wind had destroyed all their ships, leaving them with almost nothing. Now, with the cargo recovered, they could afford a proper doctor for his mother and afford to live a better life.
. Just a normal conversation. No sex.”
Draco wailed and pushed back as much as he could. His bound hands scrabbled uselessly against the wooden desk, leaving scratch marks that Harry would have to vanish later.
Draco was smitten and embarrassed at the same time. He was sure that his entire face was tomato red.
big sweet tooth.
Harry was merely taking a stroll when it happened. It was a pleasantly cool day, and the sun peeked behind the large clouds just enough to cast a warm glow onto the planet below. The tree nymphs danced and swayed to the gentle tunes of the satyrs, the flowers were all in full bloom and even the animals were bathing in the dim sunlight.
Hannah looked at all of them in disbelief.
Harry smiled softly at him. "Don't apologize, love. It's natural to feel insecure sometimes."
When her voice was out of hearing range, Minos asked, “My Lord, I am curious, but did you inflict something upon this woman, because your magic seemed to be ineffective on her?”
, mate! If the villagers are here, then there’s a good chance that Draco’s here too!”
He chewed on it thoughtfully. “Not bad.”
“Because the Earth Roamers do not deserve to live. They have destroyed their planet and are making plans to destroy other planets as well. I’m part of a mission to eliminate the human race and reclaim Earth to nurture it back into health. For a long time, I thought that all humans were worthless.

Side note, that elf you assigned to me - Flossie? Flibby? Dippy? Dibly? Wibbly? Whatever his name is! - he seems to be in a subtle war with Muffy. She's been my elf since I was born and considers me *hers* and yet, I've asked her to see to Viona more often than not. And you. And so, she'll be out of the room when I wake up and need Dopey? to hand me my restoration potion and help me walk to the loo. So *he* does his best to prove he's the best elf who ever lived and worthy of serving me exclusively. But then I call on Muffy automatically because that's my lifelong habit, and the two of them try not to be obvious as they glare daggers at each other.
Secondly, HARRY YOU DEVIOUS BASTARD!!!!
Perhaps we should make this a tradition on our Anniversary EVERY year, haha.
"How... How would you like it if... if we adopted you?"
Thank you for humoring me and standing up so I could see all of you on chat last night. Lily and Caelum have gone through a rather large growth spurt since I've been gone haven't they? You looked so beautiful. I can't wait to kiss every inch of that lovely bump that's holding my children. I hope you're ready to be smothered in my affection. I plan to hover, kiss you constantly, and wait on you hand and foot until you freak out and order me to go away before you murder me.
"I don't know the details, but since you seem so willing to tell me how everything is my fault, go on and tell me how you did it. How did you get close to her while she was being protected by a Senior Auror Partner? Twice."
You read him my email?!? He knows I've been fantasizing about him! I've been using my images of my friend to get my rocks off and ... and ... well, and he seems to like it. I guess it's not so bad. But if he had not taken it well, you would be in some massive trouble Draco Lucius! Well he now knows I fantasize about him, he knows I wouldn't mind seeing the two of you together, he knows I tried getting you to take him out, so basically he now knows I'm an utter slag. Ta ever so for that.
Bill and Fleur Weasley
Will she choose the first attempt, where a giggling River and Siri sat in between Atreyu - next to River - and Eris on the other side of Siri, the four of them right in front? You notice the ARSE immediately because River and Sirius couldn't stop laughing. But the smirking Blaise, Elena, Dominique, Lily, Anastacia, and Molly II was a bit more subtle. Which is why, when Molly first made the arse crew shuffle themselves, she let Bedlam continue on for a few more shots.
Tuesday January 19th
Unfortunately, I think we missed Serenity's first real laugh. I'd be disappointed that we missed it, but knowing that it came right after her Grampy Lulu's speech? Like she thought it was hysterical that she'd made this stoic man lose his mind?
The other thing I think might help is something specifically for smaller children. While I agreed with you a bit that those children should have been removed by their parents, I can also understand that walking around booths nonstop for hours can be a bit much for a child. Perhaps a play area with different playground equipment from parks around the world. Or scheduled performances of dances or fairy tale story telling throughout each day. It could break up the monotony of booth wandering for those little attention spans.
Monday October 2nd
P.P.P.P.S. There is an ENORMOUS species of Fire Ant on this cliff! They're gorgeous, and I'm SUPER glad they're not inclined to go swimming too, yikes!
I chuckled. "That it is." Then we kissed for at least five minutes, before Robards actually popped into the Ministry and passed us on his way to his office.
I looked to you, and you grinned, letting me know that you were paying attention and looking forward to seeing me make her squeal again. So I got to have the special treat of a virgin. I am fairly sure you're the only one I'd ever had before, and so, had no experience with a girl virgin. I was actually a bit nervous, to be honest. I don't have a massive shaft like Blaise, but it could still be big enough to cause more pain than pleasure.
September 10, 1996
I spun so quickly towards him, I am sure my eyes were flashing, and my magic was sparking. "How could you possibly have any idea what I'm going through?"
More silence, broken by Vivi. "You're already married. Dad did you get the amnesia again?"
I guess what I'm trying to say is my thoughts leading up to this wedding and marriage of ours are so much different than they were all those years ago. Because I know now what a marriage entails. I think the best way I can describe this is the difference between anticipating parenthood before your first child and how you feel before your second arriving. You think your life will be powdery fresh baby smells, sweet little gummy smiles, and eternal adoration. It ends up being sleepless nights, disgusting nappies, and eternal worry because a piece of your heart walks around outside of your body. But prior to that first experience, you think you know how wonderful things will be, but when you meet that child for the first time you realize you had no idea how much love your heart could hold.
But you are currently putting Jaz to bed. I, on the other hand, am waiting impatiently in our playroom for you to finish. I have been sitting on my bruised arse, my cock still in its ring, and every time I shift this plug seems to hone in on my prostate. You had better get up here soon!
I snorted in amusement. "Try not to let our divas hear you call it floofy. The fashion this year is sleek and elegant. If they hear you talking about floofy, they may well just decide that barely below the hips is the fashion instead!"
Yes, contact Greg, he'll love every moment of working on this project. Especially once you explain two or three times that it's meant to include children from our side. Eventually, he'll understand. I think. And once he does, he'll take extra pride in his job.
Draco
I looked at Parvati, who grinned at Viona. "Why not? That'll go perfectly with this dance. Get some firesticks and fuel ready while I walk them through the rest of the dance."
I gave no fucks about casting a spell to conjure a cushion to sit on - which I also spelled to repel the muck. Once on the cushion, I cast cleaning spells on her and pulled her onto my lap, stroking her hair even as I crooned soothingly.
Actually, I will not get them back. Revenge is a terrible plan. We should just take actions that may have caused us embarrassment and realize that no matter what we should never ever ever try to take revenge on our loved ones.
My Dragon,
Thursday January 25th
Draco
I'm wondering if later in the evening on the day of the visit would be a good time to take Sirius to the LGBT club. Zaire will be full and exhausted after a Burrow day, so he should pass out hard and we can take off for the evening. We're pregnant so it's not like either of us can get tipsy, and we can put Muffy on alert that if he wakes up to come grab one of us immediately. And probably add Jaz to that warning, not because I think she'd panic if she woke without us, but that we probably don't want a baby apparating in the middle of a club.
Let me back up a bit. So, since I was at home with Sebastian, Della, and Gavin - my parents also just left to go to the Ministry and or the law offices - anyway, I decided to bring the three of them to our suite with me so I could sort of multitask. I set Della down in a pile of Viona's toys, told Sebastian that he was free to talk to his father's portrait as much as he wanted, and then invited Gavin to sit in my lap.
You chuckled. Fuck my life, that chuckle is going to kill me one day! "Such a pretty boy. Is that all for me? It's practically winking at me."
After all of that, I think I might have improved the living conditions for a good half the building!
I personally vote shagging, but I can be flexible.
After our weekend, I'd love nothing more than to stay in bed and eat - mmm, I was craving the best food ever this morning! I had Muffy combine goulash with mashed potatoes and gravy, and then add some mayonnaise. It was *so good!* And now I'm sucking on a big and juicy gherkin. And I could really go for some Chunky Monkey - ooo! Dip my gherkin in it!
I grinned at that. "I understand. His gaze could melt the hardest heart and stop criminals in their tracks. Here, I'll help you pick him up, but then will you carry him to our bed? It's the weekend and we have a birthday party here anyway, so we might as well just stay here."
Well, Beatrix was begging for sanctuary from her abusive ... "father". The quotes are because no father would be able to do what he did to her. I thought my relatives were bad (and don't worry, I know they were) but there were some lines even they wouldn't cross. This "man" shat all over that line. I can't even begin to tell you the amount of rage I feel for this whole situation.
What better than the first song you ever danced to. Where you danced her around and I shot a sonorous at you so everyone could hear the love you had for your daughter.
She doesn't need to see me again for about six to eight weeks unless I have an issue. But she does want to see Jaz soon. I didn't even realize I was doing it until she called me out, but I signed through our entire conversation. She's had Jaz's milestones on an alternate timeline. Often hard of hearing children will be behind in certain areas, just because they are missing the communication component that hearing children are surrounded with from birth. But once she saw I was signing, she asked about how well Jasmine herself has been responding to or using sign, and she wants to assess her to see if she can alter her milestone chart or do away with her altered one altogether.
I saw Molly and Arthur Weasley hug my husband, a Malfoy, and tell him they love him, they're proud of him, and they'll miss him. And they meant every word.
Um, will you kill me if I tell you that you had paint in your hair within the first five minutes of starting the project? You looked adorable with blue hair! You know how much I like to muss you up! You're normally so buttoned up and posh and perfect, which don't get me wrong I love, but it makes it super adorable on those few occasions that you're not completely put together. It's why I love watching you sleep in the mornings, messy hair and flushed cheeks, and an innocence in your face that no one else but us gets to see.
Eeek! We leave in two days! I am so ready! It's been ages and ages and ages since we've been on holiday! Or, it's not even been a full three weeks, but it's been a very long three weeks!
Any guesses on why Draco's craving blood? ^_^
"HOW SO?!?! IT'S NOT LIKE I'M CONSTANTLY DOING DRUGS AND TELLING THEM TO DO IT TOO!!!"
You know, Ron and Blaise have always been as doting as possible when one of their girls has been pregnant; foot rubs, waiting on them hand and foot, putting up with every mood swing - really, they've been great. And when Kisa and Hermione were pregnant with Tristan and Misha at the same time, the boys were run ragged catering to them. But it wasn't until Kisa was pregnant with Tatyana that I realized how in love with Kisa *Hermione* was.
My favorite person in the world to torture; it drives me WILD to think about you plugged and ringed and sore and embarrassed while sitting and having a lovely chat with Hannah. You might recall that once upon a time ago, I used to whisper all the naughtiest details of our sex life to her so that we'd both be exceedingly horny as we made out on a cozy picnic blanket during our pretend dating.
I've hid the less wonderful feelings from him though. I know I will talk to him about it eventually, I don't think hiding my feelings will do anyone any good, but my joy at his happiness has been tempered with a little bitterness.
And now I'm sitting in our room. Full of love. Where we've brought our children. Brightly painted walls full of the memories we made painting it. Our bathroom where River talked my ear off while I tried to do my business. Our closet where you've both hidden in fear and planned out extravagant costumes with our children. Where you laid when you were so sick during your pregnancy. Where you nursed me back to health when I had pneumonia. Where we've held each other and our children through nightmares.
That's not to say we haven't each put up emotional walls. Oliver has spent the last hour since we received your email, the hour before it arrived as well if you want to get technical, sobbing. We're trying to keep our emotions as low as possible, we've cast a silencing bubble around the kids so they can't hear us. But it's really hard.
It wasn't so much the CASE that appealed to me as seeing my own features look so vulnerable and trying to hide it. But as you pointed out, there are other ways than just dropping everything. Thus, compromise.
P.S. Oliver, in case you didn't know it, Veritaserum does have a bit of a... not a high like a drug, but the same sort of after effects of a drug when you're coming off the high, and that's why I'm fuzzy and rambling. That and I'm terrified that you're still convinced that I followed a boy home and shagged him dirty rotten rather than try to convince him to clean up his life.
Fuck Harry!
You have been apparating back to Cape Town not only nightly, but every time you visit the loo to check on your cheetah? Love, I know you're magically strong, but do you really think with how exhausted you've been that that's the best use of your magical energies? If you were feeling just fine I would probably just shake my head and say "Oh, my sweet, silly Draco" but you've been exhausting yourself. I am sure Sembene, who was the one who cared enough to bring the injured animal to you in the first place, is taking just fine care of your kitty.
Why in the ever loving fuck do I have to STILL be suffering from this weak ass namby pamby mental trauma?!?!?! You may THINK that because I was in bed all day yesterday that I slept well - even if at a time that most people are normally awake, but no. I could not sleep because every time I closed my eyes, I'd start reliving what happened to me.
Roxanne Weasley
Everything I do, I do it for you,
There's the door I'm home at last, I'm soaking through and through, and then you handed me a towel, and all I see is you, and even if my house falls down, I wouldn't have a clue, because you're near me,
The rest of the ladies thought it was the cutest thing. YOUR MOTHER even said “Oh, the early relationship, I remember when Lucius couldn’t keep his hands off of me either.” Which was very sweet but also made me very uncomfortable!
"DEAR MR. MALFOY! WE AT THE MINISTRY ARE DELIGHTED TO INVITE YOU BACK TO DISCUSS YOUR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY! PLEASE STOP BY TO MEET WITH US LATER TODAY AT 4PM!"
Since I've been a bit spotty with my posting this week, I decided to post twice in a row today :-)
"FUCK!" Gay blurted out, leaning over a bit to get a better view of my arse.
I also really like the idea of being home for the foreseeable future, we have all those lovely toys we bought and haven't had much chance to use them! My arse has been regular skin-toned for DAYS! I could sit on a regular chair comfortably! I'm glad we at least had Muffy with us for this trip because I could not have gone this long without having you. I have a new kink, Draco the hot dad. Do you have any idea how sexy you are with that carrier? When we get home I am going to worship you, that body of yours that makes my body sing, that carts around our daughter, that is carrying my baby.
Maybe it's not physical. How are you doing with all of the emotional mess we've been dealing with lately? I know you're happy about being pregnant, but it was unexpected. You had to deal with witnessing the death of a young boy in memory form. We've had to watch our son get surgery and heal from it. Did you make your standing appointment with Yesenia this week? You couldn't have, because that's when you were with Hannah. Hold on.
"Aww, Kings did that for us?" You asked with a slightly watery expression.
Hungrily yours,
It was a joy watching our huge circus full of kids run mad. Practically every child we know was here! Alright, so I exaggerate because we happen to know a LOT of children around the world, and this was mostly children related to us in one way or another, and yes, I consider being part of our circle as being related to us.
"Fierston, good evening my lad. Tonight, rather than do anything strenuous for a lesson, I just want to check your progress. But before I get into it, I want to challenge you to a silly, old-fashioned, staring contest."
I do occasionally mention the honoraries when I am messaging the two of you, but that's about it. And even then it bugs me, why am I specifying that they're "honorary"? Because it matters somehow?
Perhaps if he rethinks his behavior and makes it clear that he will no longer physically force you to do his bidding, your parents will set the wards to allow his entry eventually. But for now, if he wants to contact you, he can do so at your office in the ministry, through some form of messaging like owls, floos, or magi-mobile, or he can perhaps send someone in his stead that can grasp the concept that you are not public property.
"Crispin, it's fine. I'm pretty much done anyway," Romeo informed him with a shrug, still wrapped around Jules as much as possible. Jules COULD have been standoffish and trying to play it cool in front of so many strangers, but he was more than content to hold Romeo in return and stroke a hand up and down his back.
“Alright, spray painting the peacocks it is!”
“Yes, I’m sure,” he snapped, cutting her off. The two of them were in one of the break rooms eating their lunches. Granger had only brought in a fast-food sandwich and some chips, while Draco had opted to order from
“If you take me with you and don’t say anything, I’ll give you this.” Draco held out the hairpin. The farmer’s eyes widened, and he snatched the pin from Draco.
However, he started to protest weakly as Harry flipped him over, so he was facing the headboard, and pushed into his sore arse again.
“What brings you here?” Draco smiled.
Or at least as long as Pippa is willing to let you sleep before you take off for today's meetings. You do have more meetings today right? I suppose I could go find Pippa and ask her, but that would require moving out of this cozy chair and out from under my Molly blanket, so I guess I will just have to wait for that information.
But I don't want to think about that anymore at the moment. I want to shift gears to our son. Last night during dinner at Café Exquis, it came as no surprise to anyone that River and Mahafsoun were acting like they had some big secret they just couldn't wait to share. We tried to be patient and let them spill it on their own, but I swear, had they not finally gotten around to it during the second course, I'd have shouted at them to get on with it!
My favorite part is that we have worked with the various caregivers really hard over the years to stress that each culture shall be respected and tolerated. Which means that some of the kids wear fully covering dresses and head coverings while others wear almost nothing but a bit of paint here and there. And while those cultures *might* clash out in the real world, here, they're expected to get along.
He sighed heavily and shrugged. "For the moment. But I'll probably be up all night with anxiety and nightmares."
When Eri and Ori nodded off for a nap, we handed them over to Muffy and Dibly, made sure Viona was busy playing with Della and Eliza - while Gavin and Sebastian sort of sat silently staring at each other and nibbling on biscuits. I think they're learning to communicate via some sort of telepathy.
I looked the boy up and down a moment, and although he was short enough that he LOOKED like a First Year, I realized that he was probably a Fourth Year. "Probably best to actually try to TALK to him first. You're a Hufflepuff, haven't you tried helping him with his homework or something?"
Why Harry? Please, for the love of Merlin and all the Gods, can you PLEASE tell me WHY you are so against me doing things like this? Why can't you trust me to do my job and minimize as many risks as possible before I ever even get close to danger? Why can't you trust that my only goal in life is to do what I feel I must as quickly and efficiently as possible so that I can get back to you and Oliver and all our loved ones?
P.P.S. Zwei called, but I told him that there was a bit of a family crisis going on and that you'd call him back later. You may not be surprised to know that Oliver took the call from me and explained things to him, so, he knows what happened and is worried about you - and Eris, of course.
"DAD!!!" Zaire called out much louder than necessary. "ARE YOU AWAKE YET?! JAZ AND NESSA WANT TO TELL YOU ALL ABOUT MY FOOD TOUR!"
I had such a blast during our circle dinner. As usual my heart and emotions were full seeing all of my favorite people surrounding us. I can't get over the changes, well not so much changes as additions, since we last lived here full time and hosted these dinners regularly. I am so used to the chaos that I didn't really notice how loud it had gotten, but for Kisa who grew up as essentially an only child, I can see how the noise would have been a bit overwhelming. I didn't even mind when she started to try screeching at them to bring the volume down. Although as we veterans know, adding volume to the situation rarely diffuses anything.
Harry, Draco, and their entire brood plus entourage have made it to Hawaii :-)
Draco
Harry and Oliver
In any case, I'm done with my morning routine and am going to head off to the Ministry for a few hours to help with the invitations now that we have a complete list of people and organizations to invite to an international championship. See you when I get home!
So, with my mind a melted puddle of goo and two lovers determined to ensure it stayed that way for good, I had no presence of mind to cast a denial spell on myself. Also, it seems that YOU specifically wanted me to orgasm as many times as possible, and so also did not cast the spell on me. I'm still not certain how many times I climaxed, but I do remember that the first time was when Oliver was inside me and hitting everything just right, and the last time was powerful enough to make me black out completely.
As for Serenity, Nicholas, and all the other kids, Oliver and I have them well in hand. We're doing good, and if you obsessively get up at way too damn early o'clock in the morning and want to make pancakes, well, we look forward to eating them.
It took me a bit of time, but I figured out how to program all the instruments with spells to simulate a teacher. If they want to learn a new song or technique, they can tap a 'button' to put the instrument into teaching mode, and then that instrument will light up in certain places so they can play those notes and learn how to play songs and the like.
Especially since the Avins very quickly decided to pack up for an extended trip with us. They are currently on this beach watching their grandchildren joyously play with the rest of our brood. It's a perfect 25 degrees (77F) out and the ocean is slowly calling my name, beckoning me to finish up this email and go surfing.
Oh my god, you were selling my hands and mouth and arse. This is probably the most humiliating thing we've ever done. When I was done reading the sign I looked at you, and saw that you had been watching my reaction from the moment you unraveled the sign. Asking in your "I love my husband" voice instead of your "Master" voice, "Harry my love, is this too much? You can safeword at any time. Do I put away the menu, or are we doing this? Color please."
I then returned my attention to the dummy. "As I was saying, the kidneys are hard to get to," I paused to demonstrate a nice solid punch to the kidney, making the dummy lift up off the ground an inch or so and then land with a loud clatter. "SO, if you do not have a clear shot, but yet DO have an opening to get in a hit in the general area, an alternative spot is the bladder. It will also hurt - nearly as much as hitting the groin - and may help you win by forcing your opponent to piss himself." I spelled a bladder onto/into the dummy, and then knelt so that I'd have a good angle to punch it with.
But then it was time for my class. I'd had Pippa send them all reminders that I expected them to show up to the Manor an hour earlier than usual. I also made it known that I'd accept no excuses short of death for not making it. Prior to the start of class, I spent a good hour and a half making myself look good. I got dressed up in my favorite of my sparring outfits, and preened for my mirror for at least ten minutes before Apparating to the running track to meet my class.
Before anyone could say anything, Kingsley proved me right by Apparating into the room - probably using you as a focus. Probably a good thing we weren't having a preflight shag. You were a bit torn between being happy to see him and miffed that he apparently didn't mind letting Robards appropriate me as he liked.
Well, after holding her and rubbing her back for at least a good ten minutes, I've discovered that she's deeply conflicted. More than half of her is so damn proud of her daughter and the fact that there are now two tiny precious girls alive because of the love our girls have for each other, but the other half of her is utterly dismayed that she's an actual grandmother now. That from now until the end of time, people will look at her and see a beautiful young woman (because somehow she has aged astonishingly well), and she will have to admit that she's older than she looks and has grandchildren.
I thought about just hiding this all from you for a moment. Just for a moment I promise! I just didn't want to stress you out even more. But then I realized I'm shite at hiding my feelings and you knew they were going to pepper me with more questions. If I had woken up this morning and tried to pretend that everything went completely well last night you'd immediately catch me in a lie. So, bad news in email per usual my love.
I'm in so much shock and awe right now! I...
But I digress. My bitterness and rage is at this moment, this beautiful time in Ollie's life, was kept from him for so long. He deserved to have a dozen newborns if he wanted. He deserved to look into the eyes of a baby that was part him and part someone he loved. He was made for this. He took to pregnancy like a professional, honestly I'm still mad that he didn't have an ounce of morning sickness, no magic drain ... for crying out loud the man went into labor on his bloody due date!
Even if they had gone to sleep at a regular time, the littlest four came in to tell you all about their days since you'd been gone. They wanted to tell you every single thing they saw in the forest and give you an update on every animal in our stables down to the little squirrel they've named Jeffrey. All of that involved Lissa, Seph, and Cael sprawled all over the bed, limbs entwined, feet perched in my lap, with Trey solidly in your lap - his thumb firmly plugged in his mouth. Normally you'd pop his thumb out, telling him a Malfoy does not mumble around his appendages when he has something to say, but it's so cute and you'd missed him so much you seemed pretty inclined to allow him his comfort.
Sigh, I have to work myself into this for a moment...
Suspicions confirmed???
I frowned at that. "Are you saying that you don't care if she takes your child and leaves?"
"Maybe you should go tell her that you're not lying dead in the Forbidden Forest, yeah?" Oliver suggested making Romeo yelp in alarm.
P.P.S. I can't wait for tomorrow's ritual!
"Aren't you trying to take a shower?" I asked him pointedly.
After you got me off and I returned the favor, your drunkenness combined with your tiredness from last night and your orgasm to put you to sleep, so I carried you to bed, wrote my email recap, and am now going to try to sleep. The good news is that I apparently timed it right to feed the babies while I typed (which takes so much longer, but it's not like I type all that fast anyway), and so I should be able to get a few hours of sleep before they need to be fed again, and Muffy assured me that *her* babies are more than capable of helping to feed ours, and so, unless one of us wakes up when they cry, she plans to handle the next feeding.
"Right, break over, let's get back to dancing!" I commanded. "Muffy, play something with a fuckload of drums!"
Before he could even ask what song I was talking about, I burst out with: "At last my love has come along, my lonely days are over and life is like a song -"
Our girl knows us so well!
Draco
Friday December 23rd
No one ate overmuch, I think we were all quite aware that we didn't want very full stomachs during our playtime activities. We made our way to the lounge with a glass of wine a piece, and moved on to negotiations. Like last time, Neville took the lead. I think we're all quite aware that he's the one that has been the most leery of playtime so it's probably best that he set some terms. As with last time, he occasionally nodded at Charlie and I or referred to us, but the majority of the discussions were between the two of you. Fuck I just love that.
I like the idea of a dirty chore wand. Necessities: lube charm, protection spells, contraceptive charm, and a scourgify or a tergeo. Maybe even a low charge … like our violet wands. Ok, I have to get my mind off of this, because now I am already missing our playroom and wanting you to torture my bollocks with that damn violet wand.
Monday at 4:58 PM
Seriously, try your best not to panic. Take calming potions if you must. I'll be fine. You've watched raids before and know that they sound a lot more exciting and dangerous than they really are.
March 8, 1998
So that's that mystery solved. You did get a double dose, one from me and one from Muffy.
"Found you," you murmured as you kissed me.
You often bend me over and give me warm up spankings, and my usual maintenance spankings. And every once in a while when I have been a very good boy, I get to be arse up over your lap, you reddening my arse while I can feel you hardening up against my hip. But you knew this was going to be a nice lengthy session that we'd both need a bit of stamina for. So I was strapped to my very well loved spanking bench. My arse was bright red, and you had gotten to the point where you were fingering me open, with the occasional pinch or bite to my poor abused bum. You were at three fingers, and just starting to add a fourth when I heard an apparition pop and a loudly shouted "Eep!"
Oliver again: I am also quite angry you've had these terrible events happen.
Well I need to run, we've got so much to do before the circle gets here tonight! I know we've all made an effort to stay connected and visit constantly over the years we've been gone. But I'm so excited for our first "traditional" circle dinner, back at the Manor, in our home, surrounded by our loved ones.
You didn’t create the situation Draco! You pointed out a problem, helped make an amazing solution, and made things better. But yes, it was definitely a long week! I’m dreaming about our spa trip tonight. I think we should make sure to have Kisa in a separate room from where I’m being massaged because I’m pretty sure I’ll be making a lot of “newlywed” type sounds in relief from the tension. But NO you can not pay the masseuse to make me make real newlywed sounds! I am feeling so emotional and I’ve not had enough of you this week that my sore muscles are the only thing allowing me to get a massage at all! And maybe you should be in a different room too because I swear to Hades that if I see someone touch you I will rip their arms off and beat them with the severed limbs.
"Yes master," Muffy's voice rang out even though she herself didn't pop into the room.
I got home from movie night a little while ago. It was a fun night as usual, we watched Ernest Goes to Camp. It was hilariously awful. One of those movies where you laugh but then you cringe because it was so terrible you shouldn't have laughed at all. We've been on a summer movie kick, and this one was based around a summer camp so it was quite fitting. Although with next week being their last movie night before school is back in session, we are going to do a school movie, Kindergarten Cop.
Whereas with Zwei, IF he decided to go on tour, it would be ON TOUR, potentially playing 4 nights a week and traveling to new locations between acts. THUS, his education would definitely suffer even more than it already does.
So, I won't bore you with the sentence by sentence narration. Honestly, it was a bit odd. It was more like a university debate than a discussion between an engaged couple and one of their sets of parents. Pearl wasn't wrong in her assumptions; Pansy was pretty supportive but wanted them to at least wait until Pearl officially turned seventeen, if not longer. Ivan, without having any real reasoning or logic to back things up, seemed to say he loves Hazel of course but he's sure Pearl will eventually want to marry a man.
My Snarly B..... eautiful man,
I'm going to go play with the kids at the Park for a little bit and then do my rounds and head home. I'll see you at home tonight unless you come here to have your wicked way with me before I leave!
Thanks for understanding that I wanted breakfast to be just me and my parents. Not that I think having you there would have been bad, just that I wanted to give my father some space and time to accept things before confronting him with you.
Oh Greg! I'm so happy for him. I think he's so in love with Unity House that he's never going to leave it, no matter how much he needs to earn an income after he's officially done with his job there. So, I think I'll do him a big favor - just don't tell him that it's a favor because I'm going to make him believe it's a necessity. I'm going to have him build dollhouses and toys. I'll pay him directly for them, and then I'll eventually open up a shop to sell them in - giving someone who's having a hard time obtaining a job because of poor war choices a chance to manage the shop for me. I anticipate that I'll probably lose more money on paying Greg and the shopkeeper than the shop makes, but it'll be worth it. Plus, I can put a sign in the shop saying that he can make anything a customer wants - such as a play house - and thus give him legitimate jobs to work too that won't take up too much of his time. I'm seriously brilliant, did you know?
Zwei snickered gleefully. "My dad once transfigured a friend into a tree branch and my other dad had to spend HOURS trying to figure out which one it was so he could undo it!"
While you were in the tub I did unfortunately read your email. But don't worry, the visions your email sparked did not keep me from sleeping myself. They were probably less upsetting for me since I didn't actually have to see them in my mind. I climbed into the tub and scrubbed you top to bottom. Then carried you back to bed. I believe you were assuming I was going to shag the worries out of you, much the way I tend to shag the snit right out of your when you're in a mood. You're obviously well aware of this, but I did not.
"I'll certainly try."
"Ah! That reminds me! We should really get her a bouquet too. She *is* half the reason my parents took the kids for the weekend," I said, actually grateful for the reminder. "Oi, Longbottom, add a second bouquet to the order, but this one probably shouldn't be too fabulous. I wouldn't want to upstage anything her son buys her, after all."
All of my love,
In any case, you might be wondering why I'm not trying to adopt her directly, and the answer is the same as it is for Harry's suggestion that he get me up the duff so he can watch us BOTH be pregnant at the same time:
Tuesday January 26, 2010
That said, I know I still have some healing to do because we all know how one of my all time favorite activities is being massaged, and yet today, the massage I received was only an hour long and I feel like I had to grit my teeth and bear it for almost half of it. I know I know! A massage should never be something to endure, but it was and yes, I endured it because I know that non-sexual touch by a therapist is every bit as healing as the random accidental groping you two give me when you're not dwelling on what happened and just acting normal.
But I don't care. I levitated your sleeping body out into the sunshine so that I can have your head in my lap as we eat our midday meal. I'm carding my hand through your hair and quite looking forward to giving you a kiss the moment you wake up. And don't worry, I'm shading you from the sun.
Saturday May 27th
So, about our Shtara. I have concerns, I would need to have some in depth talks with casting or the directors or whoever will mostly be in charge of my girl. But, if I feel my concerns will be addressed and she will be cared for? How could I possibly say no to this amazing opportunity for her?
So, I'm going to attempt a light jog all around the Manor and the grounds until the jarring motion starts my labor. Possibly interspersed with jumping jacks. Don't worry, I'll have Muffy with me at all times in case I pop whilst in the North Fields. Also, I'm not going to do it on purpose, but I do happen to know that tripping can work pretty well. Maybe I'll get lucky and not see a rock that makes me trip and triggers my labor.
Draco
And I did.
With this invitation, it became a free for all of my students trying to attack me and put me through even a tiny bit of what I've put them through. Unfortunately for them, they are still in the stage where they have to think about what they are doing - rather than react instinctively - and so, not quite able to thwart my Legilimency.
"EXACTLY!!!" I cried out excitedly. "Even a master of Transfiguration can have a lot of trouble performing Animagus transformations. A potion could help with that too!"
P.S. I can't wait for my session with Yesenia tomorrow!
Thank MERLIN we had plenty of time to take a nap before the beginning of his birthday party with the ENTIRE circle.
"Yes, master Harry?" Jasmine's elf asked as he popped into the room.
I really hope she gets along well with Amala and the cubs (who aren't so little anymore!). I mean Amala took Wojtek in stride, so I assume she'll be fine with a new dog, but this dog is so delicious looking that Amala might consider her a tasty treat. I suppose that Lumimyrsky could always live at Hogwarts with us. It's NOT like they don't have a billion cats AND Fang the Third.
Draco,
So sexy.
In any case, she had something unique to talk about. An old case. 25 years ago, a little boy named Jacob disappeared and Hannah is hoping I can use my whatever you want to call it to find his body so that his family can get some closure. So that's probably what I'll be doing when you come back.
Oh, running out of time, gotta go!
I have safe playgrounds wherever I can fit them and they don't earn me any money. WHY would I insist that you make money off of helping horses? I actually think it's brilliant, it's sort of the same thing as creating Unity Houses all over creation, but better because these animals will be coming here. The only thing I insist on is that you have Dibly at the very least and possibly Muffy and a couple of the other elves - maybe even hire on a few new ones specifically - help you care for the horses. This will ensure that they are fully trained and able to take care of the horses if you ever can't - such as us going on a last minute vacation to our island for a week.
So much has changed with some of our other children we know and love. I know exactly what you mean about Arietty. It seems I emotionally pick an age that a child will forever be in my head and it never strays. I still can't quite wrap my mind around Teddy being almost twelve, off to Hogwarts already. Teddy is forever the little love that yelled "Uncas Tiss!" at us during our wedding. And you had a hard time reconciling the genderfluid Sammy of now, with the flashy glittery diva she was the last time we got to spend so much time with her.
Mmm... you... ... ... ... Wait, what was I talking about again? There was something about you being naked and in costume... Wait! *Didn't* you promise to let me dress you up as anything and get all the pictures I wanted of it???
I found it a bit high handed of Rowe to try to guilt you into stopping worrying by reminding you that worrying is not good for the baby, but if it works, I'll send her an all expenses paid vacation to Tahiti.
Draco
Giving me a smile of confusion, Fierston shrugged and sat across the desk from me. We did exactly as I said, staring at each other in complete silence. After a few seconds, Fierston slipped into my mind and we were able to have a private conversation in which I took a major risk and trusted him - since I've traipsed all over his mind in the past and am reasonably certain that he doesn't have this sort of devious plotting in him. I explained what was happening and asked him to help out if he could, which he agreed to.
"Even though all of them are Voldemort's and two of them are also Bellatrix'?"
Anyway, I should really start on your nightly molestation now.
As I'm thinking about it now, I remember hearing that orgasms can trigger labor, so I'm hoping that from the time I wake up tomorrow - whenever our babies are napping or in the care of the elves or a family member - you'll accept my challenge to make me orgasm and keep on making me orgasm until my womb takes the hint and starts contracting on its own.
Harry explains why he was so worried and Draco geeks out about a magical toy shop, lol.
Only you (two) are my life among the dead,
Drama drama everywhere.
"My precious granddaughter, the only one so far who has followed tradition, and thereby earned a special place in my heart - not that I'm playing favorites! I just wanted to say that with you resisting the temptation to turn into a slag like the rest of them, I have a deep and unshakable believe that your marriage will last your lifetime. THAT said, perhaps you now feel like you could use a few pointers. Things you may have purposely ignored in the past in order to remain pure. So, aside from the gifts I already gave you, here's perhaps the most important gift you can receive," my mother said as she handed Viona a rather large book. It was a plain book with NOTHING on the outside to hint at its contents, but I just so happened to know what the book is - having found it in our Manor library in the past and read it quite thoroughly.
I don't want to have to wake up in a bed without you in it.
But as I was saying, I had nothing to do, so I decided to bring our three babies in to see Healer Rowe. She finds it a bit amusing that we bring our babies in for more check ups than strictly recommended, but considering their rough time in my womb and whatnot, she completely understands why we might want to occasionally come in and say: Hey, can you take a look at our perfectly healthy babies and just verify that they're still doing just fine.
The Minister needs to be like Kings of old, leave the running of the everyday minutia to your Barons, Dukes, etc. Put the correct people in place to work directly with the people so you can focus on "big picture" items that will benefit the kingdom ... or the Wizarding World in this case ... as a whole.
Sunday May 15th
Draco
So, I'm writing this because I have just spent the last 2 hours in a Magi-Skype session with Yesenia. She has been absolutely patient in reminding me that it's a process. I cannot expect to just be completely better solely because I have decided that I want to be and made peace with what happened.
Except for MY home which has ZERO cons. And I don’t mean England or Wiltshire or even The Manor. I mean the arms of my husbands. Not a single con except for the fact that I’m not there right now.
More magical nostril extraction.
Enjoy the beach! And yes, I'll be sure to tell my father about us so that I can show you the memory. Actually no, I'll wait to tell him so that I can invite you over and snog the hell out of you right in front of him, that way, you can see his reaction in person,
So, with our mid-afternoon adventures yesterday, I would love to say that this vacation has been amazing so far.
When Robards was done questioning me, Kingsley sighed something a cross between relief and continued heaviness. "So, he's still alive and being held captive by a woman. Obviously, she can still intend him harm, but if that was her only intent, she probably would have just done it - or put him somewhere less comfortable. We can only hope the fact that she stashed him in a room with access to food means that she plans to keep him alive and relatively well for some time. THAT gives us a little time to find him."
But anyway, during that break I took, I got a chance to talk to Mrs. Litwin. It seems that when one considers *all* the circumstances behind Mr. Litwin's death, well, his insurance company concluded that his death was 'accidental' and so is covered by his policy. SO, she received the entire quarter million Galleon payout and was able to buy a nice house on the outskirts of Godric's Hallow. This means that Antonio will actually be within walking/biking distance of Unity House and can visit anytime he likes. Especially for his therapy sessions.
"Yeah," River confirmed. "It specializes in Mortgages and business investments. Thus the majority of it can be handled by our five full time employees, which is how we were able to come for a week visit. That said, the people who want business loans that might be considered riskier, our employees know to schedule them with us when we get back."
Not that NO ONE was in danger though. Did you see some of those "potions ingredients" they were selling? Mermaid fins? Adolescent dragon claws? And then there were the potions themselves, I don't need to be an auror to know full-powered amortentia is a no-no.
When River looked like he could use a good nap, and Eris started throwing a fit, I made our excuses. This seemed to be the trigger because everyone else with young children sighed with relief and pointed out that their kids were growing impatient as well. So, we left Mike and Jackie communing with those without kids who wished to stay a bit longer.
But I wasn't ready to dismiss class just yet. "IF you manage to get into his mind and stay there for even just a minute, consider switching to nonverbal spellcasting. The longterm goal - especially for interrogations - is both nonverbal and wandless. You want to be able to slip into a mind without them noticing, and THAT'S why practicing on animals is actually ideal."
Who does that?!?
River seemed really interested in the planning session with Greg and Millie - especially since it involved dinner. Millie has not only drafted initial plans for the deconstruction of the building that WILL be the park or community center, but she has ALSO drafted plans to deconstruct and combine those three lots off Diagon to make room for my future hotel.
I hear you call my name, and it feels like home,
Unless they're empty like most chicken eggs...
My Silly Husband
I’m sorry I didn’t find you on the lawns yesterday in enough time to tell you how to feel about Sammy. By the time I realized you weren’t asleep or locked in the bathroom getting ready, she had gone to drag you in herself. I think you know what I am going to say, at this point I have said this so often I might as well see if Molly will cross-stitch it on a pillow for me. But as my Katja has told me every time I stumble and blame myself for reacting to surprises with thoughts that the Dursley's had drilled into my head; Your first thought doesn't define you; it's what you've been conditioned to think. What you think next defines who you are.
Draco
I will see you, and our other beautiful husband, for dinner tonight! But for now I must get back to playtime!
I feel like I know Grandmama better than you do. You're surprised she thought this was big enough to … punish Gorman for? You KNOW that children are her soft spot. She keeps her mask on. She acts hard. She raised her daughters to be tough as nails. But when it comes to children, she is a squishy marshmallow inside. Well maybe not marshmallow, more like squishy explosive material. Don't mess with her babies or she will annihilate you. I'm really only surprised that she didn't do it ten years ago when Gorman was first incarcerated. I suppose she figured living for ten years in Azkaban with no access to her child was punishment enough.
"You do???" I asked in surprise.
"Certainly," I informed him, pulling it out and handing it over. As I was explaining it to him, kids from a bit farther away could see that I appeared to be giving things out and rushed over to see what was going on.
In the dark we'll feel the light,
Ok so you said Molly is bringing the Weasley Clan, and you have the Blacks and Malfoys covered, and Luna and Greg will be here at Unity House anyway .... did anyone think to invite Neville or Blaise? I wouldn't want them to think we don't care about them! Also, I assume Pansy isn't coming in from Russia just to hear our announcement so will you be insta-owling her later? I just don't want anyone to feel left out. It took me too long to get this crazy family, I am not willing to let any of them go. "Oh, you let yourself get attached to Harry? Good luck getting out of there alive!"
Good Morning our Love,
I held out my hand. "Alright, hand it over. You obviously want me to get a vision off something so you can solve the case."
------------------------------------
Otherwise we WILL have the date without you and NO we will NOT put the memories into the pensieve for you!
Alice Weasley-Longbottom
Damn, we need more women in our lives, we have potential Godfathers coming out our ears, but potential Godmothers are in short supply. I always feel like our lives are full of women, but I think the reality is that we have less women than men but those women pack in so much personality that it feels like there are more of them.
Wed, Day 21, at 10:56 PM,
Wait, I need to process this logically or rationally, or whatever you want to call it. Chronologically?
Your Harry
Draco
You are *hilarious* when you're drunk!
No! Harry focus!
"You see, it's like this, I've had some time to think over your interview with Gretchen Minch, and I've come to the conclusion that you were definitely using talents other than just sympathy, understanding, and charm. You seemed to know things that she didn't actually tell you. I think... I think you were using Legilimency."
But the not knowing very quickly got to ME. So, I offered to hold the boot for a bit and see what happens. We're about to stop at the driver's house and chat with his wife to see if she's on board with this plan, or if she'd rather keep her hope. I'm writing this quickly because I am a little nervous. I haven't had a vision in a while, so what if - like my little problem that we shall NOT talk about - I can't do it.
Although not so much recently. We used to use it so that we couldn't get separated if we were playing on opposite sides of a room, or if one of us wandered off with someone, but since we've grown and evolved in our play style, we haven't really needed it.
Assumed Ron’s biologically
True, the French may have organized this one, but they used magical water creatures from all three countries, and so, there may well be things she is not prepared to encounter. We threw the giant squid in there just for fun!
I love you, you stupid infuriatingly perfect man. Do you know how hard it is to be married to you sometimes? You're fucking perfect. You're beautiful, and brilliant, you are a master with finances, you organize businesses in a way I can't even organize my socks. You have an unending supply of love for our children, you're patient and loving. Every single person who lays eyes on you wants you, and here I am selfishly trying to keep all of that to myself. Do you have any idea how hard it is to be madly in love with someone who you feel inferior to in every way? I couldn't keep a singleton pregnancy long enough to have her full term, but you take care of our entire family while pregnant with twins. I couldn't handle a day of Auror training, and you're singlehandedly solving some of their hardest cases with no training whatsoever. Oh, and that's not enough, you have to solve muggle cases as well.
Mason Goyle
Mind you, they're using this as an excuse to have certain shops implement repairs if necessary to bring them up to the still rather lax magical building codes - on the Malfoy Sickle, naturally.
My Draco,
But then I realized that you felt like you were at fault somehow for being mad at me. Oh, my love, don't go there. It would be one thing if I said something like: "Yeah you have a picture of me that looks like I'm shagging some random person, but please believe me, it wasn't me," And you didn't believe me only to find out that it was someone Polyjuiced into me - then yes, I would be justified being angry that you didn't believe me. BUT THIS isn't that at all. This was me telling you outright that despite not remembering anything clearly, I strongly suspected that I had cheated on and betrayed you. You took me at my word and believed me, and were righteously and justifiably upset. I am not mad in the slightest that you didn't pull on your Gryffindor blinders and insist that I couldn't have done anything wrong when the only evidence I had more or less said that I did.
Fuck, don't ever make me go two days without seeing you!
I had to look away because I was so overcome with emotion that I needed to breathe and get it under control. That's when I noticed a particular door off to the side. A door that sort of shocked me.
Gods, he hated that name.
“Anyway, dear, what should we do with him?” Potter asked, twirling the dark purple gun in his gloved hands. Malfoy pouted and suddenly leaned on Potter, who caught him and rolled his eyes fondly.
of food. There were freshly baked croissants, fruit juice, eggs cooked in a variety of different ways, jams, fresh fruits and cream, cured meats, sliced cheeses, freshly baked wheat bread, porridge, and so much more.
“Nice to meet you too, Harry.” Draco managed to say back without flushing. He took a long sip of his drink.
Harry was sucking on his lower lip and slipping his tongue into Draco’s mouth and cradling his head carefully and
take over our kingdom!” He yelled to the mob. The villagers chorused in agreement.
“Just try it!”
He frantically ripped it out of his head, shoving one of the gold spikes into the lock in the door.
“If you’re horny, we can still have sex. I don’t really care.”
Draco laughed again and leaned back into Harry’s chest, letting the scent of him flood his senses. Harry smelt of apple cider and dark chocolate, and something darker that Draco could never manage to figure out.
“Because I said so,” Pansy said smugly.
Everybody nodded and started to go in different directions. As Cho left the entrance of the ship, she caught something strange that Red whispered to White.
“You can come with me.”
He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He needed to focus well in order to teleport. Usually, he would morph into a dove and fly away, but he had lingered for too long this time. As soon as he concentrated solely on his essence, blinding flash of light appeared, and Draco winked out of existence.
A few minutes later, his coffee was ready. He took the drink and walked over to an empty table. He scrolled through his TikTok for-you-page, not noticing as someone sat down in front of him.
“What exactly did he do to you?” Potter’s voice was much deeper than usual, which Rufus curse silently and subtly attempt to shift away from the two of them, Where the
Before she could reply, he heard a knock on the door.
Draco rolled his eyes, but smiled back at her.
“Where am I?” He wondered groggily before the events of before caught up to him painfully. He sat up abruptly, ignoring the pain in his head. He needed to get out
(XVIII)
Harry smiled and gripped Draco’s hand tightly. “Draco.” He managed. “I love you.”
“Nice house.” Harry said. Draco shrugged.
until Draco had to move out of town because of his father’s business deals. Gone was the scrawny, short little boy and here was a muscly, tattooed Adonis.
He could see the town square clearly from where he was, and all the villagers were gathered there for some reason. On the podium was Cedric himself.
Harry growled and pulled Draco even closer. “You little tease.”
“Who cares?”
“You’re injured.” The beast hissed. It reached out and grasped both of Draco’s hands in one of its own.

Harry smirked and took off his coat to hang it on the stand. It sure looked like
“I was thinking of maybe transitions first, since we’re both good at that.”
“We’ll never let that
“Technically, we were.” Hermione piped in, ignoring Harry as he glared at her.
“This looks nice.” Draco smiled, looking at himself in the standing mirror. The fabric felt wonderful against his skin, for he was used to wearing simple cotton and wool shirts.
“Perfectly, Granger.”
there were any, but he rarely kept up with news from the mortal anymore, aside from the occasional demigod and/or hero that killed hundreds of monsters and saved innocents and automatically had a place saved for them in Elysium. Harry snorted. If Zeus could actually keep it in his pants for once, he would eat his cap of invisibility.
sound sorry about it.
.” He moaned breathlessly. Harry left several more marks behind before he drifted lower. He bit gently at Draco’s collarbone, and Draco whined as he started to twist his nipples with his fingers.
." Draco said, already picking up the jar of Nutella again.
“Mr. Potter, I- “
." He thought to himself with a smirk. He quietly walked over to their bathroom, and quickly changed from his work robes into a pair of low-rise joggers and a tight black tee that he conjured from his wardrobe.
They all paled in comparison to Apollo, however, who had persistently pursued him for longer than he could remember and had offered him a numerous amount of valuable gifts almost every day. He
“Harry I- “
After thirty minutes, Cormac still hadn’t arrived. Draco scowled to himself and jerkily pulled his jacket back on. He was a fool to actually-
He sighed again.
Draco had no hope that he would find love. He didn’t like to dwell on it too much.
“For acting like this assignment doesn’t make up most of our marks, you daft git.”
“Shut up!”
, in particular.
He quickly lifted Draco up and pulled out of him for a moment, before flipping him around and pushing back in. He hungrily took in Draco’s flushed chest, his peaked nipples and his pink, blushing face. He looked beautiful in a way that Harry couldn’t put in words.
“Until I met you. You captured my eye since I first saw you that day. And I truly love you. I could never murder you.”
“I don’t know how to dance,” Draco admitted sheepishly. The beast smiled at that.
Shaking, he pushed his chair back and got up.
a liar!”
“Don’t worry about that now.” Harry said hastily. “Our drinks are here!”
“Do you, King Harry Potter of Gryffindoria, take Draco Malfoy to be your husband and your Consort King?”
“No, no, none of that.” Harry blushed. Draco tilted his head. Perhaps he was kinky but didn’t like to admit it. Oh well. Draco had been with many people like that.
“That’s wonderful, dear.” His father smiled as he stirred the porridge he was simmering on the stove. “Your mother is in the bedroom.”
He groaned and tried to press the wound with his cloak to staunch the bleeding, but all it did was send a spike of pain through his body so sharp, he passed out onto the dirt floor.
“You’re not helping.” He glared.
“What, me being a whore? I am one. No point of denying it.”
Well, he wasn’t exactly a Death Eater. It was revealed during the Battle of Hogwarts that Draco had actually been a spy for the Order since the Triwizard Tournament, something that even Harry himself hadn’t known. Only Dumbledore and the adults of the Order had known, something that annoyed Harry greatly. Draco had been released of all charges and praised as a war hero, and Harry had no choice but to acknowledge the hardships the blond must have gone through to act as a spy.
"Oh. I just went to the flower shop to get some new ones, since the old ones we had are dead."
He looked around the room frantically. There was nothing he could use to try and pick the lock.
. It was the Crown Prince
At least he had the decency to look a bit sheepish. He scratched the back of his neck nervously with his long claws; Draco winced at the dry, scaly sound he heard as Potter scratched his nails across his neck.
Draco shivered involuntarily. “But talking about it will help you overcome it. And accept yourself.”
**Koróido is the closest equivalent for simp I could find (it means sucker lol)
“You’ll see. You’ll all see.”
Harry grabbed Draco’s leg and put it over his shoulder, the new angle making the two of them moan.
"This is amazing!" He marvels. Harry chuckles at him.
Once the episode is over, Draco comes back to his senses and realizes that he's spilled popcorn all over the floor. He flushes.
Then drama happens in the evening ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
He looked oddly familiar for some reason.
“Here you go. That will be seven galleons and five sickles.”
“Please leave me be,” Draco said, squirming out of his grasp. Cedric simply grinned at him.
Draco sneered at her. His kindness didn’t extend much to adults,
The crowd screamed in agreement.
“You can have them anytime you want.”
Draco gasped when Harry’s grip around his waist tightened until his nails were digging into Draco’s sensitive skin.
“Will you come with me?”
Harry grinned. “That can wait. Right now, the only thing I want to do is edge you until can’t even think straight.”
“Thanks.”
“Let me see you. Take off your pants.”
“I would be much better if you released me and surrendered to the city police. You shall not get away with this for any longer!”
. If I’m not mistaken, that is Old French for ‘bad faith,’ is it not?”
Draco hugged himself tightly as he walked away from the Slytherin Lunch Hall. For some reason the temperature had dropped by like fifteen degrees, and he was woefully unprepared for the cold.
“Hi Harry.” Draco smiled. He noticed that Harry looked at Cormac in a strange way.
Why was he here?
.” He pressed his chest into Draco’s back and leaned forward, making Draco inadvertently bend forward as well.
as a waiter. Harry hadn’t been there for over a year (because of his fame and all that bull) so he supposed that the blond had managed to find a job despite him being a Death Eater.
“Harry, where have you been?” Zacharias sneered, raising an eyebrow.
“I don’t want to fucking
“Just chill, Draco.” Cormac slurred.
Harry knows that he's doomed.
Harry quickly placed the orders for everyone on the table.
“Do you want to wear the mask? Although I suppose that’s pointless, since everybody already knows who you are,” Harry murmured, leaning forward to kiss Draco’s chin and neck. Draco groaned softly.
He sighed. This was his last hope. If it didn’t work, he would be stuck as a beast
He vaguely heard the other door opening, but another wave of retching instantly took his mind away from that.
And now, it was giving him a tour of the palace grounds, and it was behaving in a rather amicable manner for a beast.
“You know, you’re really interesting.” It commented offhandedly.
“How’s the mission?” Draco asked. Harry smiled brightly.
Harry sighed as he looked in the mirror. Ever since that blasted witch had cursed him, he had been stuck in this horrible body for Godric knew how long.
Less than two minutes later, Draco’s backside was bared to Harry’s view. He could feel himself blush as he minutely shifted his knees.
Harry hummed back and kissed him.

“Are you alright? Your face was turning red for a moment.”
“Hello, Harry.” She smiled softly. She looked beautiful, even though she was only wearing a modest chiton, a veil on her auburn hair and brown sandals.
“Draco, are you sure you can stay with him? You’ve been acting- “
He thinks for a moment before typing out a reply.
He ignored the screams and shrieks of the townspeople as he sped through the cobbled pavement. They could go die for all he cared. He urged the horse to go faster, and soon arrived at the mouth of the sinister forest,
He heard it stand up, but he didn’t care. It could go and die for all he cared.

“When I was thirteen.” Harry’s grin was smug. Draco scowled.

He's about to switch off his phone when he gets a notification from his message inbox. He scowls. Hasn’t he turned off all his message notifications already?
“Yes, it will, love. We don’t need them.
Harry was fuming.
“Yes.” Said Draco, without even hesitating. His father looked at him, pleadingly.
“Hello?” He asked. It had been three weeks since he had met Cormac, and the prick hadn’t even bothered to call him
“Why in the world are you arguing? Look, I’m free on both days, so the both of you can ask me whatever you wanted to. Before you start acting like
Draco ran up to him and clutched his hands through the holes in the matrix.
Harry quickly smiled at the both of them: perhaps he could get something good out of this visit after all.
“See you later, Draco!”
“Honestly, I don’t know. This might be the only way to break the curse, but why would he even fall in love with
When Draco stepped out of the room (fully dressed and cleaned up, of course) the first thing he noticed was that Granger was standing not five feet away, crossing her arms and leaning against the wall.
some of the types of clothes in here.
Soon, other couples joined them on the dance floor. First, it was Ron and Hermione (who had become inseparable the moment they transformed back), then Molly and Arthur and even Fred and George joined them. After a while, almost everybody was on the dance floor.
that people were taking on walks.
The small pieces sprayed everywhere as they fell to the tile floor, some of the shards drawing blood and forming small cuts on his arm.
After a few minutes of tense deliberation, he decided to wear one of his newer himations. It was the color of a frothy river in the midday sun and had small tufts of fluffy clouds sewn into it. It was also spun with a bit of silver, which would give it an extra gleam when he stood in a light. It wasn’t perfect, but it would have to do.
(See the end of the chapter for
Instead of answering, Harry kissed him. The kiss wasn’t hot and needy; it was soft and tentative and
“I don’t want to hear it.” He shoved past Cormac and stormed out of the shop angrily. How
“Actually, my servants call me ‘Lord Hades’, but that doesn’t matter now, does it?”
Draco made a questioning noise at the back of his throat, and he actually
Hey guys. I'm sorry this took so long to write, but I've just been so busy and stressed this week and I could only write bits and pieces :(
“How-”
you?”
I'll probably get back full time in mid December or so.
He abruptly sat up, making Draco take a small step back. “You know what? I’ve heard a lot about you, Doc.”
“I was meant to kill you too.” Harry murmured. “But I can’t.”
“I...” He trailed off, unable to continue his sentence. Harry cupped his face and kissed him softly on the mouth.
“Nice to meet you! I’m Hermione Granger!” The lady was quite energetic but seemed nice enough, so Draco took her outstretched hand and shook it.
. I love you, but… eventually somebody might find out.”
“So, how was it?” Harry smirked.
So I have absolutely no excuse at this point. I'm sorry for being so unreliable.
“But still!” Draco insisted unhappily, his mouth curving downwards. He had already managed to ruin the developing friendship they had and it hadn’t even been a whole day-
They both watch the episodes in silence.
“What?” Draco squawked. He was pretty sure he was tomato red now. He cursed his pale skin.
“Wanna fuck me and forget about it?” He offered.
(III)
“Don’t touch me.” Draco snarled, trying to pull his hands away. It paid him no mind as it used its other hand to hastily grab two tea cloths and wrap Draco’s hands in them carefully.
“Hello, beautiful.” The man crooned. His voice was deep and sent shivers down Draco’s spine. His teeth were a bright yellow that made him cringe. Somehow, this man’s aura was even more terrifying than that of the beast’s, and that was saying
of footsteps coming up to the counter.
“Draco, I have to warn you that these are hard-core criminals and nothing else. They’d eat you alive if they had the chance. And as a doctor you must…”
“Well, I’ve been coming here for years now, so-“
“I must go and collect it now.” His father said hurriedly, pulling on his cloak and his boots in a rush.
Draco was fucked.

“Hurry up!” Draco whined as Harry slid two lubed fingers inside him.
Harry wanted to take him apart and put him back together, to make him weep and to make him howl with laughter, to be his master and his slave and his
“Did you want something, Potter?”
“Is there anything you want to change about it?”
“Hello. What-”
Harry wrapped an arm around Draco’s waist and sighed into his hair. Draco leaned into the touch.
“Didn’t I tell you to be quiet?” As punishment, Harry reached up and tweaked Draco’s nipples with more force than he usually did, using his nails to dig into the sensitive skin. Draco groaned loudly and arched into the touch. The darkened skin around his nipples turned beautifully red.
“Harry-”
Harry hums quietly to himself as he starts moving his things into his new room. It is a quite pretty room, with a full-body mirror next to a bathroom. The bathroom leads to his roommate’s room on the other side.
you not to come here.” It hissed in its deep voice, walking up to Draco. Draco scrambled backward.
After spending the evening in Harry’s room talking, one thing led to another and they had soon started making out in Harry’s bed.
The fact that Malfoy was also wearing sheer thigh-high stockings and Mary-Janes did
Harry didn’t know whether to be disappointed or relieved.
Harry shifted so that he was on his hands and knees above Draco. He lowered his head and kissed Draco, this time with more passion. Draco gasped as he tickled the roof of his mouth with his tongue.
.” Harry hissed. He got up and stretched his cramped knees quickly, before gripping his stiff, dripping cock and guiding it to Draco’s stretched hole. He pushed in slowly, making both of them moan loudly.
“I’m home.” He announced once he stepped into the house.
(XIV)
For some reason, he didn’t mind this.
very devious. Well, off to do damage control. Bye guys!”
As she scurried off, probably to find Ron, Harry laughed gently. It was good to know that some things wouldn’t change.
to remain in his path as he was passing by.
Draco could also see himself in the mirror. He was smiling happily and laughing. He was holding somebody’s hand, but the other half of the mirror was gone so he couldn’t see who it was.
, for fuck’s sake, sound so sexy.
Potter smiled. “Anyways, I just came to ask if you’re free this Friday.”
They were right. They had always been right.
“Good morning.” It rumbled. Draco noticed that it was over a foot taller than him. Draco was a respectable five foot eleven, but the beast was gigantic.
“Can we take a shower now?”
Harry kissed the bruise he left behind, before muttering, “Love you too, darling.”
"Harry! It's been a while. Who's this?" She turns to look at Draco. Her smile is warm.
Crown Prince Harry Potter of Gryffindoria was a very arrogant man. Ever since King James Potter and Queen Lily Potter had passed away when he was 17, he had forgotten all his morals and become a reckless lad. He collected extravagant taxes, slept around with men and women alike from the brothel every night, and wasted his money holding lavish balls instead of helping his people.
“Today, I thought
These were the only places where he got time to
“No.” It said calmly.
Draco, however, seemed against it. He was struggling against the ropes that bound him to a chair and a crying
He felt another small blush grace his cheeks. Fuck. His first day hadn’t even ended yet, and Harry Potter was already leaving him notes and roses in his office.
“Harry, please, I need to leave.”
Swallowing his fear, Draco walked up to it and slid his arm into the crook of its arm. The arm was solid and muscular, compared to Draco’s slim one.
“Take care Father!” Draco yelled as his father ran outside and mounted his horse and attached a cart to its backside. His father simply waved at him as he galloped away.
He walked back to their bedroom and pressed his ear against the wooden door. He heard another muffled moan. He shook his head and grinned. Draco was really insatiable sometimes.
“Like I give a fuck.” Draco muttered. The beast growled, but it didn’t give any other indication that it had heard him.
His mother would probably just wear the formal, yellow robes she always wore for parties. Draco wished that she would let him style her outfit at least
However, in most of his videos now, people were asking him to duet other TikTokers, especially one in particular.
"I like Nutella." He said defensively. Harry was about to retort, but his eyes strayed away from Draco's face to his very delectable-looking arse.
“Yes.” Draco moaned. Harry started thrusting directly onto his sweet spot, making Draco arch so much Harry’s cock almost slipped out of him.
“I just wanted to thank you for all the potions you’ve given me.”
would be interesting.” Harry smirked, eyeing Draco’s crop top. Draco blushed again.
The ManagerBots stood in the center, looking professional and cold as always.
"Sometimes I prefer being average." Draco shrugs. He wasn't going to talk about his father just yet.
(III)
Wait. He was
“Hurry up,
Honestly, Harry is rather sexy, he wasn’t going to deny it. But the fact that he's sexy is going to make it hard for Draco to live with him.
“That sounds good. Anything else? I was thinking we could try a wardrobe switch.”
, but Malfoy was wearing a... a
“Of course!” Mr. Dumbledore smiled. “Come sit with me.”
"Potter." Harry turns and sees Draco in a fluffy blue bathrobe, his hair wrapped in a towel. The most ridiculous part is the lime green face mask on him. Harry almost snorts.
“I don’t have to kill you.” He said abruptly.
Draco left the basket in the kitchen and made his way to his parents’ small bedroom. Lying on the large bed was his mother, looking particularly frail and ill.
“This is fucking awesome.” He says. Draco laughs.
He frantically reached for the vial of vanilla oil on the bedside table and grabbed it quickly. He dipped his finger inside and massaged Draco’s winking, red hole.
“Math, English, Robotics, et cetera et cetera.”
Harry can barely stop eye-fucking him on the spot. It doesn't help that he's wearing a V-neck, from which his collarbone peeked out teasingly. It also doesn't help that he's wearing tailored trousers (Harry could tell) which accent the slight curve of his hips and his long, nimble legs. The black Cuban heels only make it sexier.
He stood up from his cushioned seat and stretched, wincing slightly as the ichor rushed to all the parts of his body. He summoned his cattle-skin sandals, the ones that had been dyed white and stretched up his calves. They would go well with his outfit.
“Fine.” She grumbled. “But for future references, I told you so.”
“Traveling the world.” Harry’s voice was bitter. Draco patted his shoulder.
Finally, the lock clicked and the door creaked open. He peeked outside and sighed out of relief. The halls were empty, save the groans and the sounds from the other inhabitants of this horrible place.
“Fuck, you’re so tight, love,” Harry grunted, pulling Draco’s hips even closer to his crotch. Draco simply grabbed helplessly onto the sweaty bedsheets, unable to even hold back any sounds at all.
With renewed anger, he slit the throat of one, and dug the sword into the skull of the other, before slumping to the ground. The third one scurried off before he could do anything to it, dragging the corpses of the others with it.
Draco smiled as Harry hugged him from behind, resting his chin on the top of Draco’s head.
“I-um-uh,” Draco spluttered, trying to find something to say. He certainly hadn’t anticipated Harry flirting so openly with him.
Before he could even blink, Potter leaned forward and kissed his cheek softly.
Draco bit his lip. He needed to get out of here.
!” Draco mewled. “
He didn’t want to think of what that meant.

Hello guys! I just wanted to thank you all for the lovely comments (I have the screenshots ;~;)
opportunity to sneak down to his little meadow in the mortal world. Nobody would disturb him, and he could stay for as long as he liked.
"Draco Malfoy." He says.
Draco was in love all over again.
“My Stats class is so wonderful!” Hermione said happily. “The questions are so challenging!”
“I’m adding another finger, love.” When Draco nodded, Harry slipped his middle finger in with the first one. He crooked his fingers, searching for-
Harry sighed and rubbed a large hand across his face. “Go. But you must come back within a week. Or else-”
“They’ve passed on.”
“You too Kouroi!”
“I’m sure Dr. Granger would love to know that you’ve been out of your cell, Mr. Potter.” Well, Draco didn’t have any intention of telling anybody about the incident
Granger immediately stopped walking and grabbed his arm, stopping him as well.
“I think I love you too.” Draco sighed.
“Harry!” The two of them froze as a panting Draco ran into the courtyard.
“Oh. Would you like to talk about that?”
“How dare you? I know fully well that I deserve to be in Elysium, you-“
"No! You need to pick a specific time and location and decide on which season you're going to watch and..." Draco rambles until he realizes that he's come off as the obsessed fangirl type.
Since we miss you so very much, we are going to leave here in just a little bit to come spend the day at Unity. We’ve avoided it up until now simply because of what you said about Vanessa’s distrust of males. But we both figured if we were at Unity, we wouldn’t have to be around you when you were working with Vanessa, but we could be on site simply to give you hugs and kisses in between sparring or therapy or even loo breaks.
Draco Malfoy
Nora made sure to tell me "chut papa, grand-mere dort"
I raised a brow at that.
Until I hear word about any families being found for these kids I have no idea if we are receiving 30 kids, none, or somewhere in between. I put out the call for the all hands on deck situation, and once everyone gets here we are going into prep mode. It should be easier than the last time we had a huge influx because we won't have to build extra beds, and unless we get the full 30, we shouldn't have to hire any new caregivers. But it's still going to be a lot of work, and I have a feeling these kids may need a lot of hands on care and love in the upcoming days.
River deep, mountain high,
I found out something about the Gala that I didn't know and now I am anxiously awaiting tomorrow like a kid on Christmas Eve. They have rented out a huge chunk of King's Cross! According to the Muggles, there will even be a "replica of the actual Hogwarts Express." Which means my agent asked Minnie if we could rent it for the evening and she agreed immediately. The only thing she asked for in return was an invitation.
Oh Harry, our silly elephant started crying and gave me a kiss so tender and full of love that one would think he was still blaming himself for that accident while we were wrestling around. So, I tried to reassure him by making sweet sweet love on a wisely conjured cushion on the floor of the ballroom. It was wonderful and took a lot of time to accomplish ^_^
Somehow you have the complete inability to see the difference between things on the same spectrum. Me saying "Hey, maybe don't put yourself in front of someone hellbent on killing" and you hear "I want to limit and control every single thing you do."
See, Miles and Sammy arrived and I hugged the hell out of Miles while Sammy just sort of watched us warily. At first, I didn't recognize her AT ALL. I sort of did my usual mental explanation of: "Oh! If I see a kid in the Manor I don't recognize, assume it's Teddy," thing. I even almost called her Teddy, until it occurred to me that Teddy wouldn't be arriving with Miles. And then I stuttered out an incredulous: "SAMMY?!?!"
And oh wasn't Eric a ridiculous surprise? By the time you finished your email and then handed me your computer to read it, he was just beginning to stir. The both of us decided - instead of being kind and compassionate - that we should immediately begin interrogating him upon regaining consciousness.
Viona growls in frustration as he steadily approaches another group - this one made up of people arriving for his party - as he is directing them to his yacht.
"Which is why we're having a regular old ordinary circle dinner," you informed him.
My Fiancés!
High on you,
"Right," I stated in understanding, grabbing a couple dozen of my mapping drones and slipping them into my carry all watch. The contacts and earbuds were part of the standard kit, and so, I didn't need to worry about telling everyone to wear them.
"Well, let me just find some clothes to pull on and then..." I trailed off as Muffy popped up with the perfect track suit for my morning activities. "Thank you Muffy, you're the best House Elf ever." I pulled on the black with blue contrast outfit and cast a couple of charms to clean and style my hair.
Roderick Oliver Weasley
Rather than try to reply, she simply stroked Gabriel's head and hummed. Her humming seemed to - well not exactly calm him because he's used to these and doesn't get scared or cry or anything, but erm… soothe him? In any case, after she pet him for a few seconds, he seemed to relax and his seizure tapered off until he was back to normal.
Oh! Sometime tomorrow before the party begins, I invited Julia to come over and take some portraits. Not quite a full session that sometimes takes hours, but there are a few pictures I really want sooner rather than later. I figure we'll do a huge session right about the time the triplets are six months old so they're sitting up, not wobbly, and fully interactive. You know, like a zoo exhibit! But I definitely want an individual portrait of each of our graduates, an updated family portrait that includes all of our newest arrivals, an updated kids portrait that includes all of the aforementioned new arrivals, and when I was talking about this happening Ollie overheard me and asked if he'd be able to get a picture of him with Parker and Cassie and one of Cassie all on her own.
Today was certainly interesting. We facilitated a rather smooth meeting between my parents and your Godfather. I did my best to make sure that my parents would treat him with understanding and compassion - in their own Malfoy way. And you made sure to tell Sirius that my father had changed quite a bit, and that you suspect he was never truly bad at any point, simply good at wearing a mask to make the world think he was.
“I’m sorry, I-”
“Red and gold.”
“Want some more?” Draco nodded desperately and pushed his arse up. He knew better than to speak up now.
, and nothing else. And he knows exactly what to say to people to tip them in his favor.”
Harry snorted and kissed the top of Draco’s head.

He had been hoping to see his new roommate, but he hadn’t come yet. Too bad.

“Draco. You are
Harry held his hands and moved them around, correctly connecting the wires to each other.
Draco shrugs. The Ferrari wasn’t nearly as nice as his Lamborghini, but he wasn’t about to bring his best car just for college.
, Draco scribbled furiously. Harry shrugged.
He walked as briskly as he could until he got back to his office. He locked the door, before sliding down to the floor and holding his head in his hands.
“Right! Draco, the girl in all black is Pansy. Luna’s the one with blond hair and Neville’s the last bloke. Luna, Pansy and Neville, this is Draco. He’s not from around here.”
“I would like to tell you something, Crown Prince.” She said flirtatiously, while they were dancing.
“Excuse me, who are you?”
“Thank you, Harry.” Draco sighed, feeling full and content. He leaned back into Harry’s broad chest and smiled as Harry kissed his temple.
“I... I can take you back to my base station. You’ll be mine, and nobody can do anything about it.”
Draco shook his head in exasperation. Honestly, he would never understand what went through the minds of the people he serviced. Like this one lady who had smelled of spoilt fish and had come to ask him to exorcise her cat.
“No.”
“Are you going?” Harry asked. Draco shrugged. “I said I would.”
Draco froze on the chaise. “What?”
Potter shook his head. “Not really. I just came to greet you.”
But what if it wasn’t enough? The glass was cracking even faster than before, and Harry guessed that he had roughly a month left before the curse became permanent. If he didn't win Draco over soon, there was no hope for him.
“You heard me. You can take him. I’ve given you permission as his father and the head of his family.”
That night, Draco had packed his things while Harry was sleeping and left, most likely to Malfoy Manor to stay with his mother.
At least he had the party to look forward to.
“Hello, Mr. Ollivander.” He smiled back. “I would like three large trouts please.”
“I can put a mixture of red roses and yellow begonias. I could also dip the tips in gold glitter, if you want.”
know that you’re going to see him several times a week, right?” Granger asked, her voice tinged with concern.
He cracked a smile at the thought. Perhaps he would meet his little god there as well.
They walk over to the beanbags and sit down. Draco admits reluctantly that they're comfy.
again.
“Draco? Draco!” Draco snapped out of his thoughts when he realized that Granger was talking to him. She had a concerned expression on her face.
“Hey, Dray. What’s up?”
Harry smiled and pulled Draco closer to his chest. "Well, let's watch it then."
“Ok, so what do you guys want me to do today? Should I diss Father or spray paint the peacocks?”
“It’s ok.” Harry said.
theGoldenSnitch!’
“I started it last year. I preferred it to working in Father’s business.”
Draco found that he couldn’t say no anymore.

“I can teach you if you want.”
“Come on guys, let’s start the mission.” Red said. “We can start checking out the vitals of the ship before assessing how much repairs it needs.”
“There are lots of other foods I can make too. There’s this kind of West African rice dish that’s
“It’s ok. I think I’m ready.” He smiled. Harry smiled back and kissed him softly.
He smiled as he opened the first page. Perhaps things weren’t as bad as he thought they would be.
The noise made Harry suddenly snap out of his trance and stumble backwards. What was

“Any last words, Rufus?”
A fraction of a second later, he re-appeared just on the outside of Mount Olympus, and in front of the Gate of Clouds. As usual, all three
Some few stadia ahead of him, there was a god sitting among some flowers. Surely, it was a god, for no
“We don’t have to do it now, you know. I can wait for whenever you’re ready.”

Draco was impressed, to say the least, but he didn’t let it show on his face. “That is correct, Mr. Potter.”
“So, you called a prostitute.”

Also, the chapter titles tell who's perspective the chapter is from.
In response, Harry leaned forward and bit down hard on the curve of his neck, where it joined with his shoulder. Draco moaned and shivered above him.
An hour later, he was deep in the thick forest that blocked most of the sunlight from kissing the ground. It was also chilly, and there were distant howls of wolves in the distance.
“Because I said so.” Its tone booked no further argument, and Draco wisely kept his mouth shut.
Only Potter and Malfoy were crazy enough to literally have sex with their enemies tied up to a chair in the room next to them. It sent another spike of fear through his heart, because if they were crazy enough to do that, what would that mean for him? The police had already experienced their madness, and it was never a pleasant sight.
He backed up as Harry got up from the chair he was previously occupying.
It was
“I am.” Once he finished, he placed a lingering kiss on his father’s forehead, cradling his face.
“It’s either that or ‘love.’” Apollo smirked. Draco sighed and resisted the urge to rub a hand down his face. It would ruin his look, and he was not re-applying his face cosmetics all over again because of a little flirting.
And now that the election is over, Hazel has been reminding me almost non-stop that Pearl turns 17 in just 5 days, and that per the agreement with her father, they've set their wedding date for 2 weeks after Durmstrang lets out. That's roughly six months from now, and so, the wedding planning needs to get more attention than it has been getting up until this point.
As I explained, I handed the contacts out, and then fell silent for a few minutes as I gave each Auror a pair of Earbuds quickly charmed to look like the earrings they were already wearing - as a replacement. Those who weren't already wearing any got to choose a design and the two that didn't want ANYTHING like that on them, I did as I'd suggested and turned them into flat invisible disks that could be placed on the inside of the outer part of their ears.

My wonderful husband,
I'd better run and make sure my students are all packed up and ready to head back to Hogwarts. Are you coming with or hanging out at the Manor the rest of the weekend? Either way I'm taking the littlest triplets with me, I think they're all going through growth spurts because they're eating as fast as I can make it! So enjoy your calm weekend if you'd like, otherwise I'll see you tonight at dinner!
"I think I might understand the watching my eyes thing now," Harry informed me with a grin. "I tilted Ollie's head back so that I could kiss him, and that gave me a chance to look in his eyes as his orgasm hit - when he wasn't squeezing them shut. It was fascinating actually."
"His Mind Healer," you reminded in case Oliver had forgotten (or didn't know) that tidbit.
When.
You grinned at me. "If most of our kids plan to be watching anime, I say it's the perfect time to leave the littles with their elves and go out dancing ourselves tonight."
My Love,
"I heard that they're going to pick a girl to be May Queen, a boy to be Forest King, and then make them shag in front of *everyone!*"
Don't worry, either of you, I made sure that all the littles were well occupied with their loving grandparents before heading into the Ministry. I decided that I was better off going in just long enough to see if Hermione ACTUALLY needed anything, and then since she's had things well handled all of last week, more than likely come right back home - in PLENTY of time to join any and all of you for dinner.
Side note, I originally didn't plan to even mention it to Pansy, but she's already going to be "in town" that day anyway as she's going to be visiting her family for a bit before Christmas.
I used it to really sort out my thoughts and emotions. I've been trying to stay very loving, calm, zen if you will, for you. For us. I know we're all in full triage mode. We're all traumatized and hurting. So I've been saving my anger and fears for my private sessions with Katja. I'm not trying to keep secrets. I'm not trying to avoid problems. I swear I am dealing with things. I just think right now focusing on being calm and in control can only be helpful when our life is so chaotic. I just wanted to be clear that I am not "pretending" to be fine. I'm just trying to keep my different emotions in their proper time and place.
So... After we'd returned to our hotel room from the Sauna, we'd shagged, snuggled up, and went right to sleep. As I slept, I had a very disturbing dream. It started out well enough. We were in bed caressing each other and kissing in that soft and loving way where we give each other a thousand tiny kisses, and then a thousand more.
The costume I prepared for you is a sort of match to mine in red, although I know that the girls made something for you too, so if you choose their costume over mine, I won't be offended. That said, I made Persephone and Lily's costumes Angels, complete with wings and halos. And Caelum is the most adorable little cherub you've ever seen.
Here's where I think we may still end up fighting. I hope not. But this is where I get emotional and you tend to get emotional in response. You, growing up playing politics and other such word games, tend to use extremes when you speak. I had to learn very young to read into every word so I wouldn't accidentally earn myself a beating or a starving. I know we're arguing semantics at this point, which seems ridiculous, but it is what it is. When you say "she's the most beautiful girl I've ever seen" I take that literally. The words literally mean you find her to be more beautiful than any other girl. That's not my interpretation, it's the actual words. So whether or not you MEANT she was more beautiful than your daughters, you still said it.
I have to say that I'm insanely proud of you for how you were utilizing the crystal room though. Instead of locking yourself in, casting spell after spell to quell the fear and the rage, you'd gone as magic free as possible given the magical nature of the room itself. You were, instead, flinging the crystal every which way using your muscle power instead of spell power.
Birthday January 24, 1999
Actually, you know what? I totally have something to do about it. The kids that stayed home with me are all snoozing away, I'm going to do something about it! Hold on a mo while I set up the dictation.
Love,
Oliver grinned. "You love Harry so much that you couldn't hurt him by saying anything like that."

My beautiful man,
There was just the one last naked song, and so it made sense for it to go next so that the entire rest of the show could be drag. Thus, Parvati and Padma strutted onto stage as we were swaggering off it. And as far as I could see, the collection plates had practically been flying around during the part where YOU were the eye candy we were drooling over. Elena even catcalled us, hahaha.
I know! It's been days! Days and days and days. The last time any sort of message has been sent was two weeks ago while we were still on the island coming home from our Valentine's date. Or any message more than a quick "nope, won't be home in time for dinner tonight either, eat without me" and "spending the night here again, I miss you both, enjoy your cuddles without me."
Not my point! My POINT is that if you feel you need to keep a secret from me, I don't actually mind. That said, I AM worried about you! Are you feeling alright? Do you need headache potions? Are you coming down with a cold? Did all that running in the chill morning give you pneumonia again??? Do you perchance have another personal problem that I should rub healing ointment into - that *would* sort of explain why you've been so willing to top lately.
Viona, Alric, Vinnie
I'm sorry,
I swear she even laughed when I screamed in alarm!
"I hate you too, you bloody arsehole! Why can't YOU act like the girl you're supposed to be?!" Hazel shouted in return.
Zwei smiled wanly at her before turning to look at me. "Actually, I need to ask you... Can I go out for a while today? Izumi asked me to go to an amusement park with her."
Basically, I realized that I wasn't slowly emotionally dying from playing, but from forcing myself to play when I didn't want to. It made everything worse. No one else was forcing me, but I was pushing myself. Looking back from a healthier place, that was probably the worst thing I could have done. It was terrible for my self esteem, which was practically nonexistent at that point. And because my brain was all jumbled up it was leading me to resent you for "making" me do something I didn't like. You've never once forced me into anything I didn't want, but depression is a horrible liar and had me convinced of it.
“Calm down boy.” Draco crooned gently, attempting to calm it down. Soon, it stopped bucking but was still neighing worriedly.
For the first time in
One of his wind servants floated up to him with a silver platter filled with all of his skincare products; fresh honey from the
“Nice name. Latin, right?”
He pushed the door open and ran out of the hallway, stopping only to grab a sword hanging on the wall, and out of the doors to the small stable it had. He grabbed the nearest horse and swung onto it. With a slap to its rump, it was off into the town.
He could see his parents waving at him. He looked behind him, but nobody was there. He turned back to the mirror, trembling. He could still see his parents. They were dressed in fine silks, and Draco’s mother looked as healthy as she did before she was sick.
features that marred his image. The horns, claws, even his height had been affected. When he was human, he was just a little over six feet, not as tall as
“Yes.” The beast said smugly. “I’ve missed having a dance partner, and the suits of armor aren’t exactly good on their feet.”
His perception of Potter. It had been several weeks since he had started working with Potter, and even he had to admit that Potter was…
Harry snorted. Of course, she asked about his advisors before she even thought of wondering how he was. Then again, she was a sucker for a good love story, so he shouldn’t have really surprised. It wasn’t as if he ever asked about her, anyways.
“Dinner, and I’ll tell you the way out.”
“Just set them up on a date.” Draco laughed. The sight of Harry ranting in a bathrobe and a hot pink face mask was quite funny. It didn’t help that his hair was wrapped in a towel, or that he was wearing fluffy bunny slippers.
“I’m fine. How are Ron and Hermione?”
And at that moment, the last piece of glass on the Mirror of Erised fell to the floor and shattered.
He allowed the beast to push him into the cell and lock the door. Then, it walked away, half dragging his father with it. Once they were gone, Draco put his head in his hands and cried.
. Rufus curled his lip in disgust.
Cedric smiled. “Don’t worry, Draco. It’s no problem.”
“You’re doing so well, love.” Harry praised as he thrust his finger inside Draco slowly, being careful not to hurt the blond.
Cedric whistled lowly. “Where’d you get this?”
Harry couldn’t believe it. He looked at his chest and found no stab wound from where the sword had pierced him.
, for God’s sake) Harry parked next to the garden, where several albino peacocks were strutting imperiously.
He looked into the bottom part of the mirror that was still intact. In it, he could see several pairs of feet and what looked like a cat at their feet. Crookshanks probably.
He stood up and ignored the aches in his protesting legs as he walked along the walls of the room, looking curiously at the strange things in it. From the floating lava lamps on the ceiling to the weird human skull on the bedside table that had an unlit, melted candle in it (that Draco suspected was actually a
“Hello friends!” Draco smiled as he waved at his phone camera. He squinted his eyes to read the comments on the live stream which were coming in the thousands.
He remembered how Granger had described Potter as a ‘hardcore criminal who would eat him for breakfast.’ But Potter was nothing like that. Potter was cordial and easygoing and even flirty sometimes. One of their more recent sessions came to mind, making him blush.

"How come you came to Ilvermony?" Harry asks.
“I think I’ll tell the story of the Crown Prince.” Mr. Dumbledore leaned back into his seat.

“Alright, alright. How are your roommates?” They were all sharing rooms with people, although in different places.
“Draco, be nice.” Hermione scolded, although she had a smile on her face.
As he drove home, something told him that even after the collabs, he and Draco would still have something special between them.
hadn’t decided to teach him useless skills throughout the afternoon, he definitely would have had more time to find something better to wear.
“You’re alright, love. Just relax.” Harry soothed, massaging his back steadily. Soon, Draco fell into a peaceful slumber, clutching Harry’s shirt tightly.

Harry couldn’t get the picture of the man out of his head. It had been some days (or weeks; he lost track of time when he wasn’t firmly grounded to reality) and he still couldn’t get think of anything but the beautiful blond.
“Harry.” He smiled, getting up from their bed to hug him.
“Let me

As he looks into the mirror, he inspects himself. His untidy raven hair, his green sparkling eyes, his tanned skin. He sighs, and runs a hand through his messy hair. He hopefully checks the door again.
I just can't really find any inspiration for it anymore. And also, I need to work on my commitment problems (!in writing!)
She reached into her tattered dress and brought out a long baton.
It didn’t take long for Harry to finally push inside of Draco.
Harry was quiet for a moment. “I think you should, just to see if he really means it.” His tone was odd.
Amazing was an understatement.
Harry bit back a tired sigh and set down the daily report that Ron had sent in for him to inspect. Whenever Aphrodite sent him a message, she was either trying to convince him to settle down with a nice minor goddess as his queen or inviting him to a grand celebration on Mount Olympus that he was required to attend, no matter the circumstances. Harry had managed to escape the last few ones she had invited him too, and he knew that she would eventually find a loophole in his plans.
He pushed his finger in further, just up to the first knuckle. Draco’s hole felt wonderful around his finger, and he nearly groaned aloud when he imagined the sensation against his cock.
With suspiciously shiny eyes, Draco smiled back and hugged him tightly.
It wasn’t as if he was entirely unwilling to find a spouse. No, Draco would absolutely
“Hey muffin.” Draco smiled as Harry sat next to him on the couch and pulled Draco onto his lap, nuzzling his nose into Draco’s neck. Harry was very affectionate, just one of the many things Draco loved about him. It didn’t hurt that he called Draco ‘muffin’ either.
Once he had peeled off the mask, he knew that it was worth it. His face had a soft, ethereal glow to it, and his cheeks were tinted golden from the ichor that had rushed into his face. He looked like… like, well, a
"When did you start wearing
later, but for now he could relax.
Before Harry could reply, Draco knelt down in front of him and yanked down his joggers and pants in one go, releasing his cock. Draco gulped. It was bigger than he had anticipated.
“Fine. Whatever. Leave me alone.”
It led Draco away from his room, down three flights of stairs, and into the large dining room Draco had seen when he had first arrived. The table was laden with enough food for a small army. Draco had never seen so much food at one place in his whole life.
Once the audience dies down, Harry adds in, “If I may add, it was quite a lovely behind. Like, I’m flattered that my name is on it, to be honest.”
"I'm not!"
“Where am I?” He wondered for a moment. Then, the events of the previous day came rushing back to him. He jumped out of the bed and scrambled away from it. Who had put him there?
He had arrived in the town a few days ago, shaking and trying to convince the villagers that Draco, the little angel, had been kidnapped by a beast who he claimed was Harry Potter himself. It wasn’t hard to convince the town that he was a senile old coot.
"Um... doesn't everyone do that?"
Harry’s grip on his hip tightened. “Fine. Be like that then.” He started to pull out, but Draco stopped him.
“Yeah. Let’s go on a date. You’re really pretty, you know.” Harry grinned when Draco blushed harder.
‘May I?” It asked, extending its arm out.
“You menace,” he sighed. “Anyway, he was very bipolar, to be honest. He was quite… flirty, as well.”
He watches Draco pull his pants up and secretly mourns the loss of the skimpy thong. However, to his delight, Draco’s trousers are tight enough to make his arse even

did this to me?”
Draco hesitated. “Are you sure?”
“Feel better, mate?” Ron asked, playfully knocking the side of Harry’s temple once with a candlestick. Despite himself, Harry smiled.
“Oh, that was a good one. Well, Harry, let’s look at the next question, shall we?”
Harry laughed at his boyfriend’s excited chatter and kissed his nose affectionately.
. Harry's just in a white T-shirt that stretches across his brand chest and
“I shall be heading to my chambers now. If there’s anything that requires my attention, save it for tomorrow. You are dismissed.”
As his wind servants whooshed into the room to take away his himation and straighten it out, he slipped out of his current robes and sat in front of his charmed water mirror, which never rippled or spilled out of its crystal frame. His pale skin was unblemished and milky; his waist length, golden hair was shiny and silky; his lithe frame was slender and curved at the right places. Draco knew that he was beautiful and a bit exotic.
“Yes. If you wish, you can see-”
Draco froze.
He and all the other workers met in the huge tent. It was made out of hammered electrum and satin. Soft to touch, but sturdy and flexible as well.
It had been three months since Draco had first met Harry, and they had settled into a routine now. Every Friday, Harry booked Draco for the whole weekend. They spent most of the time talking, and when Harry was horny, they fucked. It was oddly relaxing, and Draco now found himself looking forward to the weekends now.
(VIII)
“Love you.” Harry leaned down for a kiss and grinned when Draco gave him a short, chaste peck on the lips before turning back to his vegetables.
“Oh, get your head out of your arse, sister.” Auxo rolled her eyes. Carpo’s scowl only deepened.
“If you wanted to tell them, you would have already. Don’t think you can play games with me, Doctor.”
He eventually settled on the jam. There were several different flavors, all of which looked amazing.
Enjoy!
Harry smiled.
"I'll have my usual." Harry says. He turns to Draco. "What do you want Draco?"
When they finally approached his cell, Harry Potter was leaning against a wall with his hands in his pockets, and it looked like he was whistling. He looked strangely relaxed for someone who was stuck in a mental asylum.
“What’s your excuse this time?” He sneered. Cormac shifted nervously, and tugged at the hair on his neck. Then, Draco got a sneak peek of his neck when his collar shifted. Were those-

“Are you sure?” Draco crooned softly. His hands started to slide lower, but Harry promptly grabbed his hand and put an end his subtle teasing.
“Are you sure? You don’t have to lie about it, I really am sorry, I had absolutely no idea-”
"You're the most interesting roommate I've ever had." Harry smiles at him.
When his cock finally spurted the last of the come, he moaned weakly as Harry kept on stroking him and shoving his tongue into him without letting up.
He picked up his quill and started to write down his notes from his case. Well, he might as well focus on the task on hand while he had the chance.
now, and-
to ask about how their child is
Half an hour later, Draco heard a knock on the door.
“Thank you.” He smiled. Harry smiled back warmly at him.
“Why?”
See ya! :D
Soon, he heard a click and the door creaked open slowly. Draco excitedly thanked whatever gods were out there and slipped through the open door. As he expected, the building was empty, save the noises coming from the other prisoners of this place. He shivered and ran to the exit and peeked outside.
As they continued to bicker, Harry hastily broke them up.
Harry nodded, absently uprooting several strands of grass. “Do you know my last name?”
His attempts were futile, and as the chariot dove into the earth, the large crack above him sealed shut and cut off all the sunlight from reaching him.
“Yes!” Harry runs over to the car and stands by the passenger seat.
Harry laughed. “Yes, I am. Let’s get you ready. The session is almost over.”
Draco sighed. “When is it?”
“I can’t believe I just did this.”

He hissed as he pulled out and looked down at Draco. The blond was an absolute

All he needed to do now was find out what had
“You need to be subtle about it.” Draco said, handing Harry the file to do his own nails. It had taken a little while to teach him, but Harry was now moderately proficient at nail care.
“It’s nobody.”

It wasn’t easy finding one, but after months of surviving by himself, he had found a brothel instead.

Harry was
“Your blind faith will be the end of you.”
“I was wondering if you’d like to go out with me to the cafe nearby. You know, just to get to know you better.” Harry looks rather desperate and fidgety. Normally, Draco would reject it, but something about Harry makes him reconsider.
Zeus’ grin turned dark, and Harry momentarily wondered just what he had done do her.* “Quite a while ago. But that doesn’t matter now, does it?”

costume. It was black and white, and had little black bows all over it. The waist had a white silk ribbon crisscrossing all over it, tied together in a big bow at the middle. The skirt was puffy and flared outwards, and barely skimmed the middle of his thighs.
“I, uh, thank you. Draco,” Harry says hurriedly. He faintly realizes that Draco’s French accent is glaringly obvious, especially when he speaks English. For some reason, it makes him sweat even more.
“Love you too.”
He pointed at the vase on the table in the corner of the room; sure enough, there were several fresh roses in it.
“Nothing.” Draco kept replying. Harry’s eyes narrowed.

He was entranced. What in the world-
Draco was lost for a moment, then it clicked.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “What exactly have you heard, Mr. Potter?”
“Thank you.” The beast said. Draco sighed as he heard the clops of its hooves become fainter and fainter.
Harry merely stepped aside and continued walking as he piped up, “Why not?”
Harry grinned. “Take her to the Fields.” He motioned to his ghoulish guards, who nodded and dragged the woman into the depths of Tartarus, ignoring her threats and screams.
Potter looked thoughtful for a moment. “Two small vials of the potions, and five candles.”
“Stupid ponce,” Draco muttered.
"You mean
“Are you alright, my Lord? You seem quite pre-occupied with something.”
“Potter!” Harry jumped and cursed. He spun around and saw Malfoy standing there. Wearing school robes. Not a maid costume.
“Why you little-“ She lunged for him, but he smirked and teleported away a fraction of a second before she caught him.
his fault. How hard was that for people to understand?
“Didn’t peg you as the reading type.” Draco snarked. It sighed and put the book down.
“Please leave now, Draco! He’ll be back any minute now!”
, yes go harder harder
That evening, during the Prince’s ball, he was approached by a beautiful lady. She was dressed in the finest of silks, had the bluest of eyes and the brightest of hair. Prince Harry was smitten. “Good evening dear Madame.” He greeted courteously. She merely giggled and started to walk to the middle of the ballroom, beckoning the Prince to follow her. The Prince followed her blindly, and they started to dance.
? How did you escape?”
He opened his closet and pulled out a netted softsilver shirt and tight platinum jeans that made his arse look fat. As he pulled them on, he wondered if it was an old patron, or someone new. Hopefully someone new, because they tended to pay him more than he was meant to get, so he kept the spare change.
As far as he could tell, he was in the Children’s section. The bright colors and the cheery pictures on the book covers made him scowl. He was in a mood to sulk and their happy dispositions annoyed him to a great extent.
1 was a soft boy aesthetic, a cropped oversized striped blue and black shirt with a white collar, relaxed jeans and white Vans. 2 was the classic e-boy outfit, with a large white shirt over a black and white striped long sleeve shirt with black ripped jeans and checkered Vans. 3 was a black turtleneck with grey joggers and black and white striped Adidas.
claimed, anyways.
“No!” Draco exclaimed. He ignored Hermione’s sharp gasp as he ran up to Harry and hugged him.
"I won't." Harry promises.
The mirror was surrounded by broken glass, and only half of the glass was left. Draco peered at it curiously, when suddenly a mist gathered in the mirror and started to swirl. He gasped when a picture formed in the mirror.
He quickly pulled one of his older chitons that had faded over the centuries. There was no way in Hades he would ever go frisking about in his new clothes. His mother would kill him if she ever found out.
“Oh my god, I’m so sorry.” he muttered, trying to look as small as possible.
“Harry!” He was knocked out of his train of thought when a small, soft hand tapped his shoulder. He spun around, about to blast the foolish person away, but he froze when he saw that it was just Hestia.
For a moment, he was paralyzed, the image of his mother bleeding to death and the fire raging through the Manor.
“Are you in love with me?”
little hole.
“Yeah, yeah. How about Honeydukes tonight at eight?” Honeydukes was the local candy shop, and Draco had a
He looked at them for a bit longer before he wished the picture and the mist away.
“I want to see my mother.” He whispered. Suddenly, a misty fog started to gather in the mirror and swirl around until it formed an image. He gasped.
Once he was sure that it was gone, Draco walked quietly into the room. He frowned. It was gigantic but empty. The only thing inside was a standing mirror with a strange inscription on its top. It wasn’t in any language Draco recognized, although the words looked oddly familiar.
“Hey. Don’t cry, love.” Harry frowned when he felt tears start to wet his chest. He lifted Draco’s head up by the chin and kissed away the two fat droplets that had gathered in his silver eyes. Draco closed his eyes and took a shuddering breath.
“Who’s there?” He asked warily.
Draco sighed as he peeled off his face mask. Harry was just so handsome! The fact that he could cook made him even sexier.
Cho Chang is on a mission to inspect the vitals on the base station on Planet Polus. She meets two strange people there.
As usual, the square was empty this early in the morning save for some early risers who had started to stock up their stalls with their goods. The warm, sweet scent of ambrosia teased his nose and Draco impulsively decided to stop and get some freshly baked cakes before he headed down to earth.
The International Space Exploration Committee had sent Draco and eleven other astronauts to the Skeld, one of the newer space stations, to perform a routine check up.
“There are some rules you must follow in this castle.” It rumbled, its voice deep.
She rolled her eyes and put down her spoon into her bowl of tomato soup. “Are you ever going to get to the point?”
Draco Malfoy weaved his way through the market stalls with a large basket in his hand. As he passed by, some people stopped to stare and whisper, but he ignored them. He had more important things on his mind.
They linked arms and made their way back up the stairs. Throughout the walk, Draco could feel its eyes on him, which made him want to squirm.
Harry found himself falling even deeper for him.
Really, he didn’t deserve such good friends.
The comments seemed to be screaming in agreement.
Draco nodded frantically. Harry tsked and slammed against his prostate. “Use your words, love.”
Draco was about to retort, but shut his mouth. Besides from the lonely nonsense, Harry actually had some good points.
“Ready?” He asked, leaning down to kiss Draco’s nose. Draco nodded.
“Good. Now, I’ll take a step forward with my left foot and you take a step back with the same.”
