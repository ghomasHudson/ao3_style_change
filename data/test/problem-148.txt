"Masturbate," Harry tells him. "I want you to come again before I come in you."
He crawls back over to the door. He's wet down the inside of one thigh, and there's dried come smeared across his thighs and down over his little, trifling cock. There's mud on his hands, on his knees and his feet, and even on his cheek. Maybe, for once, he's just as dirty on the outside as he is on the inside, and there's a measure of balance that isn't normally there.
Harry comes over and rests his hands on Draco's shoulders. "It's all right," he says. "If you don't want to do this, we don't have to. I know how much it means to you. We can just have a nice weekend instead."
"No," Draco says. It's not like he's not going to need a bit of time to get his head around it. He'd like to know more about it, but it's not like his father's library is going to have a book on it, and he can't just pop into Flourish and Blotts and hope they've got a strange kinks section for the niche witch or wizard. Maybe one of the bookshops in Soho.
Draco is trembling, and he can't even quite put his finger on why.
"Getting the kids into their pyjamas," Ron says. "They've both been monsters today. Hugo's stopped sleeping full stop and the least difficult part of Rose's day was when she got paint on the cat." He doesn't sound particularly unhappy about it, although perhaps tired, and he obediently takes the wine that Draco's holding out for him. He looks bemused as Draco follows it up with the chocolates and then the orchid. "Hermione's had two meetings with the Department of Mysteries today and one with the Minister for Magic, so she says she's prepared for monster wrangling."
Draco goes red.
Her expression softens a little. "We're friends," she says. "I hope we always will be. Has it not been like that for you and your…"
He waits a minute before responding. "You wouldn't mind? If I was-- if I took you up on your offer."
"Because there are Muggles around, and because nobody wants to deal with having to obliviate the neighbours because we've just rocked up on the doorstep out of nowhere."
Harry wants to
Draco nods for a third time. Harry wraps a towel around him, letting Draco wear it like a cape. With the other towel he dries Draco's hair, getting rid of the worst of the water, and drying his face. He's gentle but quick.
"Thanks," Harry says. There's a pause. "Make sure they'll open for both of us."
Draco stumbles up to his knees. His limbs shake. His muscles quiver. He leans in and takes Harry's cock in his mouth, lapping at him. He smells like heat and sweat and come. Draco craves the taste. He licks him, swallowing down whatever remnants of come he can find, licks him until Harry's thighs are trembling beneath him, and Harry's hands are in his hair.
He's Harry's mess, though, and Harry seems to want all of him, all the untidy, messy parts of him that he'd never dreamed for a moment that anyone would ever understand.
Inside, there's one cubicle and two urinals. He puts his coat on the windowsill and assumes Harry doesn't want him in the cubicle. He's humiliated and ashamed but neither of those things make his dick any less hard. He's pulsed pre-come in a damp patch on his underwear. He pushes them out of the way and gets his cock out, hovering near to the urinal in case anyone comes in.
"That's right," Harry says. "And now you should come."
He checks his pocket watch. It's only just past four, so he can't give in and stop work yet. Harry won't be here until seven, and Draco has had enough time off recently that there's a backlog of correspondence.
“Yeah,” Harry says. Then, quieter, “No.”
"I've liked every bit of what we've done. More than liked. Loved."
Harry's mouth trails across Draco's skin, and it feels like all the hairs on his body are standing on end. "You're mine," Harry says, pressing his tongue to Draco's skin. "Property of Harry Potter."
"Yeah," Harry says, and goes back for another forkful. "Just like that."
"Get on with it," Harry says lazily. "You can suck me off for dessert if you get a move on."
"I don’t know. Because no one stays. Not even my mother."
And then they're apparating back to Draco's, and Draco's shrugging off the glamour and his clothes even as Harry's following him home. He's whining, soft noises at the back of his throat, and Harry watches him shrewdly as he strips off the rest of the clothes in his hallway, getting down on his knees so that he's presenting his arse to the mirror in the hallway, holding his cheeks apart for a moment so that he can see his hole.
Harry snorts a laugh. "I'd fucking love to," he says, and he leans right in to press his mouth to Draco's again. "Get that useless little cock out. Let me watch you wank yourself stupid over cake."
"And we can stop whenever I want to?"
"Mine," Harry says.
Draco almost wants to cry. He doesn't. He has been impeccable at keeping his emotions hidden since he was seven years old and he learnt the hard way that boys do not cry. His one failure since then was that time in the toilets when Harry had caught him sobbing, and as a result he'd almost died. "I don't know what this life's supposed to be all about. It's not what my father told me life was about. I don't know if I'll ever know. But you give me things that I need and you keep giving them. It's a kindness. Maybe it's just about that."
It's Draco's first time getting sucked off and Harry doesn't even know.
"You look after me," Harry says, and his fingers are still cupping Draco's little cock. "You treat me like a little boy and I don't have to worry about real life at all. It doesn't even cross my mind. The world goes on without me. It just… keeps on turning. And you provide everything I need. You feed me and you wash me and you get me dressed and you read me stories." There's a pause. He swallows. Draco can feel the tension in his body. "You change my nappies. Every bit of the day is just easy and nice. That's all right, right?"
Harry rolls his eyes at him. "Stop fishing for compliments," he says, but he leans in anyway, and kisses Draco's cheek. "Hello."
He stays, on his hands and knees, in his collar with his
"Good," Draco says. "Go back to sleep."
Draco drops to his knees. He starts to kneel in between Harry's legs, but Harry shakes his head and makes him face the other way, away from him. He makes him lean forward onto his elbows so that Harry's presented with Draco's arse and the curve of his back. His coat's knee length, a beautiful black wool, exquisite.
"Can’t have you not being able to see what you look like," Harry says. "You’ve got my come all over your face and you’re masturbating all over the floor again."
"Piglets eat from a trough," Harry says. "Get on with it."
. Yours, all yours."
"You don’t need to ask for it," Harry says. "I’m offering it to you."
Harry keeps stroking Draco's hair, and after a while, the quivering stops, and Draco stops feeling like he needs to claw his way out of his own skin.
He also wants the end of his breakfast, and more tea, and to watch the weather out of the window. "There are some games, I believe? Maybe cards."
“How can it not be connected? How’s it possible that the absence of something from my childhood isn’t affecting me trying to fill the gap now? Like, the only toys I had growing up were ones that Dudley had thrown away. I had to hide them in case they found them and told me I couldn’t have them. No one ever bought me one of my own. And now I want one.”
The wind’s brisk in off the sea. It’s still bright. “Loving you,” he says finally. “That’s what’s in it for me. Getting to love you.”
At least, not the way he is.
He hurries out of the bedroom and back down the stairs. "Potter," he calls, and Harry emerges from the direction of the kitchens, broom in hand. "Are you ready?"
Draco wanks himself off as Harry feeds him cake, piece by piece. He gets cream on his chin and on his cheek. Harry smears it across his jaw, messing him up. The line of Harry's cock stands pronounced in his jeans.
"Oh, well…" She shifted a bit. "We were just going to watch." She repeated her initial excuse she'd given this morning.

Draco just blinked, not quite sure where that reaction just came from. “Uh… what?”
“An Odd Solution is a muggle-inspired magical solution, but I like the sound of it anyway! Okay, you have a deal!”
After a couple solid seconds of silence, an upper year to his left couldn’t stand it.
“Ah, I think Madam Pomfrey stunned me or something so I don’t break anything else: I can’t move.” He admitted.
Harry took a breath, but he’d come prepared and knew what he wanted to say. It was… just a matter of bucking up and
"How about a trade? I'll tell you about my aunt's rose bushes and you tell me about these manaculas."

stuffing his face of course, but then again Harry doubted much could pull him away from food, not even the guilty conscious he clearly didn’t have.
Still on guard of course, but it felt a bit more comfortable to know this was all according to Draco’s plan and he trusted the Malfoy heir before a lot of people.
a Slytherin from attacking a Gryffindor?
Harry had grown up without James or Lily, and he had no idea who they were or what they were like, so maybe a tiny bit of them was alive inside their son, but most of it just wasn’t theirs. Harry was someone else entirely different from his parents, who for some reason had learned his mother’s kindness and passion, as well as his father’s dedication and sheer pride all on his own. Not because he’d come from loving families like his parents had, but because he’d grown up alone and learned a lot of lessons his parents hadn’t until they were all but graduated Hogwarts.

Daphne perked up, both shocked and annoyed at once.

“Sirius!” She all but snapped at him.
Harry tensed, and the only reason he managed to not snap something automatically was Neville staring at him very blatantly now, as if asking what he was about to do.
“The second reason is a bit weird, but uh…. I was raised by muggles who hated magic and didn’t really know anything about my parents so like… when I got to the magical world for the first time the Potter name didn’t really

They chorused.
Another long silence… before she nodded once, a tiny movement as if afraid someone would see her even agreeing to this in the safety of her own home.
It looked to be two huge trees on either sides, the mantle being branches with a thousand individual carved leaves. Predictably, there were snakes carved through the whole thing, twisting into the branches, down the trunk, and two huge python-looking beasts wrapped around the chaos of roots that spilled out from the wall and onto the floor around the fireplace, forming the basin that caught stray ash and coals from the main pyre. Really impressive stuff, particularly because clearly it was magical: the snakes in the trees were moving as if alive and exploring their stone habitat lazily.
Harry let it go, since he too was here to make friends, and just smiled. What could it hurt?
It was just that her response was

Note their names are actually navy I believe—it’s a traditional color for godparents.”
“Ten points from Gryffindor for talking back, Mr. Weasley.” The potions master hissed calmly, and Ron went five shades redder as he was forced to grab his bag and plop down at Goyle’s table when the large boy made no move to join him and it was clear even to someone obtuse like Ron that Snape would only be overjoyed to take points off of the Gryffindor rather than the Slytherin for not following orders.
“It’ll take two seconds,

And it was really late, but eventually his patience paid off as the door to their dorm quietly opened, and his head snapped to the side at the sudden movement. He watched as Harry snuck in—his hair was much long and much sleeker, but tied back in a loose braid and his extremely colorful muggle clothes looking a bit disheveled, but he was otherwise unharmed.

“First of all, I’m fairly certain this class is not designed for Gryffindors to
Still, he did nothing but glance once for wary awareness at the Gryffindors all eyeing him intently around him, before sliding into a seat next to Harry, but the opposite side from Neville. He wasn’t stupid—there was no way that would go well, as Neville would simply flee and Harry would pout about it for the rest of dinner. Not the best tactic when they’d been reunited less than ten seconds.

Draco was an eleven-year-old, just like him, who put up a mask of being an arrogant, self-centered, know-it-all and could easily come off as an asshole. But with just a little prodding he came unraveled at the seams and a very real, earnest eleven-year-old boy—

“It’s such a shame you weren’t in Slytherin. You might’ve been able to see things our way, or at the very least the snakes would’ve eaten you alive. How entertaining that would’ve been.” He mused, mostly to himself it seemed so Harry kept his mouth shut. He was used to the comments, although from a professor much less an adult who’d previously tried to kill him was a new one. “In any case, you didn’t interfere at all this year, surprisingly. And since you’re being…

“Good luck with that, Potter.” She sneered.

“Uh… hello.” He greeted awkwardly, sinking behind Hagrid slightly and fixing his beanie to make sure even his make-up concealed scar was firmly out of sight. The motion seemed to knock some sense into Tom and he jerked back slightly.
he wasn’t sure what would.
“Wait, let me guess,” Harry put his hands up and glanced at their plates subtlety. He had gotten pretty good at gauging which was which by the way they talked or their attitudes towards certain things, but the sure-fire way to be sure was double-checking what the ate as they definitely had preferences and were probably confidant no one had caught on to it yet, so they didn’t even hide it.

Harry was genuinely touched, his eyes a bit hot.
“What are you after.”
the fact he was the Boy Who Lived.
“Then—” Draco cut himself off and gave another dramatic sigh. “No, it’ll do no good to just keep asking why. Clearly I don’t understand, but you have to promise to tell me if you ever figure it out.” He demanded, almost briskly even. The worry in his eyes seemed to have lessened, and Harry felt better realizing they were… kind of regaining normalcy. That conversation wasn’t…

“No way,” they both crossed their arms in an ‘x’ motion in front of them, heads shaking once in sync.

Harry really couldn’t take that chance though.
He’d asked if it was really fine to bother his sleep like that, but Neville’s simple answer only made him cry harder.
the new rumor of his language abilities would undoubtedly spread like wildfire. The only person he owed a real explanation to, not just having him hear it from a rumor, was Neville. He vowed to wake the boy up early tomorrow morning and clear the air before the rumors got too bad but before Blaise got a some reigns around the rumor mill itself—but tonight he was just too tired to do anything.
“He used that too.” Pomfrey was stern, but her calm was masking a lot more than that. When he nodded she frowned even deeper. “It is one—the imperious curse is able to control someone and force them to do whatever the caster likes. It is difficult to break out of, and once under its control also difficult to notice someone is under it. In the last war there were many who were imperioused and forced to do the dark lord’s will. And of course… some who used it as an excuse to remain out of Azkaban.”
someone to mess with. Or… at the very least simply someone you had to handle with all your wits about you…
“No one’s done great on the DADA OWLs in years,” Blaise dismissed promptly. “Not without a private tutor at least.” And by the smug implication he did have one, Harry made note that maybe he should look into that. He had half a mind to get a muggle math tutor, adding another wouldn’t be

“It has,” the blond agreed, although Harry could tell he was kind of baffled by that seemingly random statement.

His stomach twisted as Draco wrote back something else and he answered dutifully, lacking some of the spark he knew he used to have but just being unable to do anything about it. He didn’t know how to get it back, and he didn’t know how to fake it either. Not with Draco.

he could not stop his internal alarm clock from forcing his eyes open before the sun had even started to lighten the sky outside the gorgeous gothic-style windows framed in rich red fabric. He’d kept the curtains of his own four-poster bed side open because he was far beyond sleeping in small dark places—the one window he got back in the shed had spoiled him and his new roommates didn’t care about which bed they got so he’d jumped at the chance to have the one between two of the largest windows that showed part of the grounds and part of the forest outside their confines.
Something inside of his brain snapped with an audible

kind of house where you sank or swim entirely based on how competent you were as an individual.
“Worried I’d feel guilty for asking you to check on Hermione.” Neville was looking at him now, blue eyes wide but not alarmed. Calm and facing forward… and Harry actually felt a little uncomfortable to be put on the spot like this. That was… new.
“Non-magic folk,” he supplied easily, either not noticing or not caring about the sudden shift in conversation as his black eyes grinned down at him cheerily, and Harry had a feeling it was the former. All that told him though, was that Hagrid was a bit slow on the uptake… and he was genuinely kind, to have said something like that for no other ulterior motive than that he believed it to be true.
"Can you do that?" Seamus scratched his head at that thought.
Blaise just calmly went back to scrawling in his notebook with beautiful penmanship even using a quill and Harry got the feeling he’d be sticking his tongue out if he were the type to do that sort of thing.
“Um… it’s a serpensortia; Mr. Malfoy showed me. Er… another reason not to go back to Gryffindor just yet.”

“We’re making team shirts for the soccer club. We’re big enough that we want to play a few games when the snow melts.” He explained politely. He felt a pair of big blue eyes staring widely at him as if asking what the heck he was doing from somewhere to his left where Neville was hiding from the center of the commotion on one of the Hufflepuff benches.
“…what?"
All in all, it probably sounded a lot worse than it’d been. Especially since Pomfrey said healing a cut, no matter how severe, was the first thing a medic learned so she could fix him up near instantly upon him reaching the hospital wing. He’d lost a lot of blood too, but again she’d had blood replenishing potions fully stocked in case someone needed them and while he’d needed two, that also had been a simple matter. What wasn’t so simple was the bad bruising from being blasted into a wall, but miraculously he hadn’t actually broken anything and that too, despite it’s severity, she’d cleared up in under an hour.

He still didn’t understand it all, and he was sure this would keep him up at night if the nightmares didn’t already, but when backed into a corner his mind only ever got clear enough to fight back. And Theo’s pale expression triggered the same protective rage in his chest he got when he saw Luna without her shoes on, and his flare of a temper only ever made his mind sharp and fanged.
"It seems Salazar Slytherin had three children, of which was always known. It was believed his youngest daughter to be infertile though, as she never bore a child. That is, as of this moment, disproven." Axeclaw observed to no one, probably for Harry’s benefit mostly as it was obvious that was what they’d come to learn. Harry was also kind of annoyed by how unperturbed he was, although in hindsight there was no reason for a goblin to be concerned over the bloodlines of wizards, even if they were related to old famous wizards—humans were humans and goblins didn’t particularly care about humans as a rule.

He chirped conversationally to Draco as he took a bite of his lunch, and blond’s quick eyes taking in the situation and seeming to come to the conclusion it couldn’t hurt to play along for now—Harry had won this battle.

Harry didn’t know what expression he had on, but by the way his heart was beating and his hearing was a little muffled it probably wasn’t good.
Draco finally lost his cool and lashed out, Harry’s heart skipping a beat as a cold hand wrapped around his wrist and yanked it forward with surprising strength. Or, Harry just wasn’t as strong as he remembered being, but Draco was. Either way the blond did not let go even though Harry attempted to pull free, and he would’ve started panicking if Draco’s words didn’t freeze him solid in shock.
“Oh gee, as much as my relatives would
The elf wailed balefully, and Harry was thankful for his muggle repelling stone. “Master Harry Potters is lying sirs!” He accused. “Wizards can’ts lie to house elves!”

It is insanely impressive you’ve done this, but where is the fire?”
Let him loose on the Slytherins, that is.
Bloody hell,” And yes, Blaise looked very pissed about that news, so Harry suspected there’d been many blood tests or goblin rituals Slytherin families took part in that would’ve made curing potions extremely worthwhile. Maybe he should mention to Axeclaw how much some purebloods would be willing to pay for those potions if he could remember to offer them up front.

Tell him you didn’t know what it was before it hatched and made a mistake—maybe they’ll have a chance of going after the guy who gave this to you because really, if he’s got dragon eggs in his pocket who knows what else he’s dealing! If he’s got one, he could have others, and they’re supposed to be a protected species, aren’t they?” He pleaded, Neville nodding along rapidly in agreement.
And the most painful part of this whole situation was that he
The truth of the matter? His apology to Weasley was utter bullsnitch and he honestly had nothing against the likes of Dean or Seamus. Their muggleborn or half-blood status left something to be desired, but these days he was trying not to think of that too much. He couldn’t change on a dime, but he was making the conscious effort.
Not that it really fixed anything as he woke up the next morning still feeling horrible. He felt
Dustier and dirtier.
Why was Hedwig bringing him a letter? Had Harry lent her out to someone?
Wordlessly he pushed up his sleeve and held out his non-dominant hand, plan up.
Wait.

, no great proclamation or dramatic confrontation in front of the whole school that changed things. Harry honestly hadn’t even seen it coming, and even later when he tried to think about it in earnest, he had no idea what triggered the change.
He had a couple calming draughts left anyway, so things were fine, right?
“Well you’re not getting out of this and this way you have a choice. One makes your life easy and the other will make your life a living hell. Deals are all about choices so you don’t

Was that the word? Did he
He might’ve played the part of a innocent, sane prisoner well, but now he truly looked mad… and yet she could tell her words were biting at his psyche. Hopefully they’re take root and twist inside of him until he believed them too.
"I have grown to expect ssuch cheek from you Potter, no matter you will learn from Gringottsss asss I have that the old man isss playing you like a marionette, join me asss an equal and watch him sssuffer assss jussstice isss rowt on the truly wicked, it takesss more to be the evil than I can portray to act as the pinnacle of light but be sso callouss behind closed doorsss, sacrificing pawns needlessly and grooming them asss if it were chess, you will sssee Potter, however I will give you opportunity for revenge if that isss all you actually want once you know I am right, take thisss port key and sssay Coelum Tenebris when you are ready oh and yes that is your creature name, you are a Dark Chimera, a rare sight, by taking the magic of other dark creatures you can steal their inherently powerful gifts and even take their forms as If by having many Animagus forms you are the pinnacle of dark creature if you have access to all the breeds which I can help with, I am a dark lord after all, think on my proposal Potter I want a willing partner in thisss and you may even find your mate in my ranks as I have a suspicion of whom it is before you came to this form, do not disappoint me boy" he said before he disapperated leaving all occupants stunned as the slytherin heir bracelet appeared on my wrist.
"Sapping its gifts just increased my capacity to eat magic and not just Dark Creatures now it seems, that opens out my options, now I am dangerous to all who carry magic, I don't think I can even be classified by the ministries system now, good thing I have morals!" Harry said cheerfully to the now very worried Goblins 'What have we done..' Griphook can only think behind a calm blank mask.
Remus strode up the staircase not minutes after the cast, as he knocked politely and entered the room, he could instantly smell Dumbledore's trepidation at his arrival, immediately putting him on his guard, his golden glare piercing Albus's false calm gaze as the man rose to great him.
Grandfather: Cygnus Black (Deceased, 1950)
"Sirius, why did you take the visitors entrance of all things? and how did someone manage to bind you so thoroughly? Come with me to my cubicle, we need to debrief you immediately, as an attack on an Auror is a capital offense, we will need to issue a warrant towards the assailant and details of your day before this happened" Kingsley spoke softly as he took Sirius by the arm before the man could protest.
"Why a Gryffindor was ever sent to guard this dungeon passage, I will never know, the password is Boundless Courage Is Nothing Without Sharp Reflex", "Quite so my boy!" The portrait said as it swung outward to reveal a crawl space into a second circular room, Severus really hated doing this every time but he had to make sure he wasn't needed unnecessarily, he climbed through the hole and retreated into the room towards the loose bricks at the far end, pulling one out to view the inside of his potions classroom from the discreet opening behind the many vials aligning the left side of the room.
As he thought the Diagon was teeming with wizards and witches of all ages as usual, milling around different shops and having hushed conversations with each other as he passed by, it wasn't until he passed Floren's Ice Cream Parlor that he noticed a certain haughty blond boy with whom he assumed was his mother Narcissa Malfoy, casually gorging himself on a sundae next to Blaise Zambini and Pansy Parkinson.
Harry blushed slightly and coughed "Thank you, we are delighted by the service you have shown us, may your enemies blood run and your gold forever flow" He says in response which stupified the rest of the Goblins momentarily before they all grinned "I am surprised again Lord Potter of your knowledge of our customs, let's head down to the creature holding area then shall we?".
Albus eyes riveted sharply to her own before interrupting "We are leaving for Gringotts in half an hour, gather the Order and meet me in the Leaky then" before she could reply he spelled the ink off his face and poked Fawkes awake, who squawked indignantly in slight outrage before jumping up from his perch on to Dumbledores outstretched arm "Old friend, take us to Gringotts", in a flash of flame he was gone, leaving a stupified Minerva in his office.
Half way through dinner the infant looked at her with a look of constipation as if he was going to cry, 'what's wrong with Harry is he hungry?' She thought as she pulled him to her side of the bed, watching avidly as was James, his eyes suddenly changed to her deep green and his hair and wings to deep luscious red as if to copy his mother who gaped for a minute at her son before James burst out laughing "Told you Lil's this one will give little Tonks a run for her money I swear it!".
The Dark Lord comes knocking..
Harry contemplated for a moment about what he would do but after the agressive snarl that was sent his way he just stepped forward and drained him too until he combusted from the strain leaving a rather messy display of dust in its wake all over Harry royally pissing him off.
While the goblins made their preparations to remove the blocks however, adding large pressure on both Harry's already taxed body and mind, they heard and even larger commotion outside the door.
"Lily RUN IT'S HIM! TAKE HARRY AND GO!" he shouted as the door burst open with a wordless Bombarda Maxima, a high cold chuckle penetrated the gloom of the doorway, "And what will you do little vampire against me?" Voldemort sneered with crimson eyes roaming the seemingly empty hallway "I don't have time for games Potter! Visus Scelerisque! Cor Lignea! Sanguinem Exhaurire!" He shouted after locating James under his cloak, James gasped as he jumped out the way of the blood curse, as spell veered off and blackened the wall next to him, "Aruspices Expulsis" James shouted as his wand trained on Voldemort, who cast a wordless Pertago Maxima, causing the spell to vier left and strike the door frame next to Wormtail who was cowering behind the Dark Lord, "Really thisss has been fun but it is time to end thisss" Voldemort smirked and cast a voiceless Sectumsempra, it hit its mark and cut cleanly across James's torso leaving him to spit blood on to the floor "Oh I forgot that isss a mortal wound you can heal from isssn't it well I will leave you a parting gift then, I am a merciful lord after all Aruspices Bombarda Maxima!" All his internal organs ruptured as the spell hit him and he died in the pool of his own blood falling down the stairs as it hit him, Voldemort stood there admiring his work in mild fascination before moving past him further into the house.
Uncle: Rodolphus Lestrange (Alive, In Hiding)
"POTTER!" 'And there's Vernon to the rescue.. what have I done this time?' Vernon charged into the kitchen almost knocking me over in the process, "Boy what is the meaning of this freakishness!" He shouts purple faced and spitting though his eyes give off an unnaturally predatory gleam as he stares at me for some reason.. which slowly dawn's on me as he approaches 'oh no he likes what he can see! That's both disgusting and a whole other new level of weird! And I can't even use Magic to defend what the fuck!' I think frantically as he draws nearer by the second.
"All I can ask is why Severus? You never liked or trusted the man and he notorious for his hate of children, what tricked you into conceding Harry to them?" Remus asked, "He actually knows what he's doing with James's son, He loved Lily and I heard him vow his oath to protect him and cast vengeance on the culprit, Snape would have been here to get him if I wasn't asked to come here to get you myself to look after Harry whilst we prepare to necessities for their bonding, as you know it will turn that Snarky bastard into a lower born vampire when he does this and he seemed to be willing to do this for the boy despite the social issue's" Sirius then went on to explain the event's he witnessed and the discussion with the headmaster, leaving a stunned silence in his wake before leaving for Gringotts to speak to the goblins and file the necessary change in circumstances and Potter vault privileges and then register the boy's existence as both carrier of dark creature blood and subsequent adoption of him to one Severus Snape later that evening.
Estate Holdings: Mr H. J. Potter
"Severus you have leave to take dear Harry and Sirius to my office immediately, I will be along shortly and I expect answers!" Albus said shortly, as Severus turned to leave however the students started to shout chaotically at the news, leaving the rest of the teachers to try and retain order and silence in the Hall as Sirius, Harry and Severus left to ascend the stairs to Dumbledore's office.
His green/blue eyes sparkled slightly in delight as she tickled him and stroaked his little wings eventually making him drowsy as she hummed to him a wordless lullaby. It was interrupted however by the elf noisily levitating Harry's crib into their room, making Harry wail at being woken just as he was drifting off.
"Peter has always been the weakest of us" he muttered lost in his agonized and protective thoughts only to be brought to the attention of Harry wriggling up his mothers arms, who seemed to strain with fighting back his strength after his birthing weakening her.
Albus smiled "Come now Severus my boy there is no need for this, I have absolute faith in you and I also have faith in Poppy to oversee this strenuous pregnancy regardless of this minor complication", "Minor complication!?" Severus and Poppy shouted at him, who just waved it off as he threw the floo powder into the flames "Godricks Hollow, Potter Estate" Albus stated calmly and stepped into the flames before spinning off, leaving them to stare in disbelief at him before following suit.
He strode idly through the halls as the groggy inhabitants of Hogwarts steadily filled the corridors, heading towards the Great Hall, he occasionally overheard snatches of conversation as he traversed down to the main entrance "Do you remember what we had to do for Flitwick's essay on Cheering Charms?" A third year Hufflepuff girl asked her friend as they walked slowly to the hall, "Oi! Do you think Slytherin will win again? I really hope the Quidditch cup goes to someone else this year, the snakes have been unbeaten for years!" A fifth year gryffindor shouted down to his friends from the fifth floor staircase.

Draco tuned out the ravaging of the unknown beings mind and simply held Harry close, taking in the strange new runes now shining on his lovers skin 'where had they come from?' "Lord, I have never seen these markings, what significance do they have sir?" He asked puzzled, breaking Voldemorts concentration.

The Elf stiffened and glared nastily at Harry "My name is Osiris, the last of my tribe, we were slaughtered under Voldemort's direction, despite our strength we are not his match and now I am the only one left of our particular gifts, I know who and what you are Harry Potter though I detest becoming a puppet I would follow you if you allowed my free will remain in tact despite what the Goblins wish of my fate, I am not evil just desperate" Osiris answered shakily, the armed Goblins sneered disdainfully at the Elf, to them there was no higher offense than stealing from Gringotts.
Obiecto Specium - Anti Apparition Barrier
"Welcome to the ministry of magic visitors entrance, what are your names? And what is the purpose of your visit today?" A mechanical female voice said, "Auror Sirius Black here to escourt Peter Pettigrew for interrogation, I am also here to talk to Familial Affairs Office on behalf of Severus Snape and as the Guardian of one Harold James Potter!" Sirius spoke confidently.
"You will be the first to know his testimony, please go see Harry I don't want him to be so close unsupervised with the headmaster, he is at risk from anyone being a dark creature only a day old, please old friend go to him, protect him whilst I see to this trash and the legal matters for getting his guardianship changed" he gestured to the cage.

Tom the bartender blinked stupidly at Harry, taking in the changes of his appearance, it wasn't until he saw the scar that he sputtered a greeting "Mr Potter you look very different since last year, how is it? Do you need a room? What can I get you? I swear it's illegal for a 15 year old to be using magic outside school.. I hope Aurors won't disrupt business.." he says with a slight smirk.

Sirius walked out of the house with cage in hand, leaving Remus standing there struggling to control his anger and agonising in despair over the loss of one of his oldest friends and the potential of losing another to the Dementors Kiss, 'How could the bastard do that to his friends? What had James done to deserve it? We took the Rat in.. had so many memories together, hell we created the map together.. he was our best friend' "Why arghh!" He screamed as he punched the wall repeatedly in a fit of boiling rage, though he calmed quickly and sunk to the floor in grief, crying softly into the gloom as he reminisced what would forever be lost.

As all floo occupants stumbled into the floo room, cries of Lily's agony could be heard down the hall, they took a brief glimpse of the floo room before a house elf greeted and introduced itself "Misters and Misses I am Paddy! My mistress needs you hurry! Poor master Harry is stuck!" It wailed and squeaked before it took their cloaks and popped away.
As the telephone box approached the Atrium the cool female voice welcomed him to the ministry before the door opened, awaiting his exit, however he was still stuck which caused passers by to raise eyebrows to the man struggling on the floor, one was kind enough to inform the security office stationed by the golden grills at the end of the room of his predicament, thankfully the guard came out of the office and headed his way accompanied by an Auror, but from his vantage point he couldn't see only hear the calls and foot steps approaching him as he lay there humiliated 'For a damn good Auror you had to let your fucking guard down when you had a suspect in your grasp!' Sirius berated himself until he was released from the bind.
~Massster do you believe you will come out unssscaved, that you will not be betrayed by that cowardsss words?~ Nagini wishpered from the corner of the room.
Sirius descended towards the ministry, trying to fight off the strong body bind someone had sent his way. 'Who the fuck was that? A Death Eater trying to cover Wormtails tracks? Who ever it was I will take this to my Supervisor so they sanction a warrant of arrest and assign me to find the bastards, but after I have spoken to Familial Affairs as that now takes precedence, that being said Wormtail knows all the routes unguarded into the castle and his magical signature as an alumni will make him welcome by the wards, this could prove very worrisome, Dumbledore will have to know when I return' Sirius thought in agitation.
Godmother: Remus John Lupin-Black (Alive)
"Why bother doing this at the school if it is a danger to it's occupants, no come along to our realm with those willing to take care of Harry now and we will look over the transition of you all as we have endorsed this so Harry gets all the benefits of his standing within our joint communities" she tapped the wall nearest to the window with her forefinger and muttered "Porta Inferni" creating a infernal doorway to an unknown location in front of them "this doorway spell can be used as a better alternative to apparition as long as you have been there it will send you there though very few beings use the old spell for some reason" Flora stated with a frown "ah yes it would be due to the power needed, it would suck a wizard dry to try this travel route so be careful using the Dark spell not even your Voldemort could do this even if he did know the spell" she added before extending a hand to collect the infant and gesture to the others to walk through "Remus, Sirius your decision before we leave?" The Lich asked facing them for the first time.
What exactly is this, Mr. Potter?”
Snape was indeed waiting on them when they got back to the castle, but spared no words as they immediately fled the Headmaster’s office. Given the risk of it all (

and so he needed to play his cards right and keep on guard no matter how much he was starting to like the guy.
Now though, thanks to both Draco’s work and the surprise ploy Potter himself had done, their positions at Hogwarts were reasonably safe for now. That combined with Severus working to protect him, even if Dumbledore did get wind that they were involved with something working directly against his own plans, Draco would likely still be safe. They were still going to be as subtle about it as possible to minimize the risk, but the risk was inherently lower now compared to a year ago as if they’d been waiting for the right moment to strike and now was the time to do so.

He’d almost forgotten to pay attention on anything that wasn’t the ebb and flow and day and night until he was shocked out of it by a flash going off at breakfast that momentarily blinded him.
He genuinely wanted to know where that came from, but Theo was abruptly silent again as he blue eyes watched Blaise and Draco bicker amongst themselves.
“Well, whatever it is you pursue in the end, I do hope you’ll keep this passion for Transfiguration with you. I’ve never quite had a student as ardent about this as I once was, and it’s quite refreshing.” Harry blinked at her in surprise, forgetting his notes for a moment to sit up at that admission. He felt… odd.
the robes could be looked a little last-century to be honest but hey, Harry was somehow into it.
“Yes, yes,” She dismissed impatiently, forcing him to put the camera down and address the school brooms scattered on the ground around them. Harry hadn’t known the girl much, but she was half-blood from what he could tell and was
"Move, move!" He shouted over the din the best he could, scrambling back as the club wound up again. At his voice she managed to crawl rather quickly towards the door as Harry went the other way, both flinching and ducking the second blow that tore down the rest of the stalls in one foul swoop. “GET OUT OF HERE!” He bellowed at her and she yet again began scrambling at his words.

“What? What’s that for!?”
Twins gave each other a look, and then one of them smiled but with something a bit sad in his face.
They stopped at a couple places along the way, getting parchment, quills, ink, and a new over the shoulder bag as even Hagrid expressed concern about the one he was wearing holding up. It was in that store that sold all sorts of bags and storage devices that he found a small draw-string bag that the saleslady said was charmed to reappear in a location he chose every morning regardless if someone has taken it, as well as that it only have something in it when the person who owned it opened it. Fascinated by the up-close magic he put one sickle in it and tested it out, having Hagrid open it and show him nothing was inside—he immediately added it to his purchases knowing this is exactly what he’d been looking for, for his key.

The two blonds over him, one silver, one gold, paused long enough to straighten up and look at each other in surprise that they’d said the same thing, at the exact same time, before Gryffindor and Slytherin united for once in turning on Harry with annoyance
know what, at least for now. Figuring out what was wrong was going to have to be a problem for another day since neither of his parents seemed confident in his ability to do it and he usually took their opinions seriously—he wasn’t good enough to contradict them or prove them wrong so that would have to be a future-him issue.
It did bring to mind though, the family he

“Yikes.” Harry was liking this guy less and less, but could see where Draco was coming from. “What was that about not being in Slytherin though?”

He was insanely proud of himself and it was hard to keep his face straight at the sour look on Snape’s face.

For once he had Harry’s ear all to himself with Dean and Seamus off doing Lord knows what and spent a solid five minutes on terminology, and one of the examples he’d used was how one plant could have so many names, primarily

Flying didn't truly feel like a sport, since it was all instinct and fine-tuned motions to turn a magical broom this way and that. Yes, it took concentration and strength, but not more than an eleven-year-old could reasonably perform if that said anything about the amount of strength required to make a broom do a 180 mid-air. It was more flipping his whole body weight or keeping his balance in check, which was skill and not power or speed.
Well. Blaise got won over by Harry pretty easily, so what if Draco wasn’t actually the one doing the convincing?
“I had him third block. Bit of a glory hound?”
And worst of all, as that he’d already burst into tears twice today and it wasn’t even noon.
“He’s a werewolf.” She admitted bluntly.
why had no one ever heard of these places? If Daphne didn’t then it really was something arbitrary, or at least hidden, which peeked his interest and made him regret not asking Axeclaw when he was last there.
In any case, Draco was complaining because he was a brat, not really because he was against the plan. He was being well-compensated and it wouldn’t harm his reputation or status in Slytherin at all so long as he didn’t lost them too many points—and given Snape would likely be the one to catch them, chances of that were low. He was probably complaining because Neville had tagged along, and for some reason when he was outnumbered by lions he got more cactus-like than usual.
“Well then what
Completely disregarding the glaring exception the Weasley family was. Which, if what Draco had told him start of last year was because the two clans didn’t exactly see eye to eye.

“Yeah same.” He agreed as casually as he could before going about assembling his plate.
“Harry?”
He shook it off, not really wanting to spoil his mood with yet another problem he had no answer for. Currently the best tactic was to just avoid him if possible, and that should be easy. Why would the headmaster want to corner him for any reason, after all?
who Draco would become or who he would end up supporting and try and make contingency plans accordingly. Draco had already promised to be his friend, so he was just going to have to get over this fretting about a future he couldn’t control and just be friends with the jerk already.
—and you and I can work on Charms together! Or maybe work out a trade with Lu as I’m not exactly the best Charms student admittedly,” He winced, remembering to study harder for his Charms final as the midterm hadn’t been the most fun experience ever. He quickly brushed it off. “I mean if you don’t want to that’s one thing, but if it’s something you can fix that’s stopping you, it just seems a shame. I just thought… it was weird as hell, the whole situation, but we all worked together pretty well with Norbert, don’t you think?”
“That’s not the point,” he huffed, legitimately upset and Harry felt bad he wasn’t taking this more seriously. He made a mental note to catch up with Neville about this later too—because the quiet Gryffindor and Draco had more in common when it came to their friendship with him than either cared to admit, so if Draco was this openly worried then Neville was definitely just as distressed… and would probably just internalize it rather than bring it up.
entertaining to watch Draco struggle, and Harry
“Yeah, first attempt before trying to outrun a troll was to hide but apparently they have a good sense of smell? Which is surprising since they reek.” Harry blinked, recognizing he was kind of rambling but it all just felt so
"Miss Flora what could be worse?" Dedalus asked clearly disturbed at the thought that having a soul extinguished being a light punishment in the eye's of the immortal beings, "Well silly wizard Dementors may take in the soul but they are made through Higher Necromancy, they are Death's personal guards, the souls they feast on do get reincarnated after a time, you wizards believe it is extinguished when they feed but no it is simply brought to Death himself to decide punishment before reincarnation, there's a reason those creatures are allowed to exist they are to keep a twisted balance, you are not taught this because you are still within that cycle, we immortal are exceptions, if we die we do not move on as mortals do, well Lich's may but vampires do not" Flora murmured to him.
To Hate Tom Riddle,
The evaluation of Harry is interrupted by members of the Guardian Council giving rise to an interesting turn of events, Dumbledore is certainly furious.
In a panic Peter transformed into his Animagus form and deftly leapt out of the mans grasp before taking off at a run out of the room only to be stunned by Remus who wore a gobsmacked expression that quickly turned to anger, "Only the guilty run Peter, if you are guilty of such a betrayal, don't worry about Azkaban or the Dementor's Kiss, we will kill you first! We were your friends Peter if you sold James and Lily to Voldemort you are not long for this world that I can assure" he spoke with conviction in a subtle tone as he picked the rat up and conjured a cage to throw him inside.
Walking along the narrow passage way he haulted at the only painting lining the passage ways corridor exit, "Password?" Asked the painting of a rambunctious man clad in frayed brown robes, Severus sneered in disdain.

Narcissa coughed "May I call you Harry? Well Draco has not been taught of your kind as it's quite obscure and has never been seen in adolescence or it's true form, you are a Dark Chimera if I am correct the more you sap magic the more inherent talents of magic as well as forms you possess, am I right in thinking you are here for Gringotts only but revealed yourself because your creature resonated with my Draco?" She asked in a light but stern voice.

"Ah you little bugger, you already want feeding hmm? You can't have mommy, she's off limits because you can't yet control either thirst or your ability to pass on your condition, so come 'ere you!" He laughed and lunged at the wriggling little one tickling and picking him up, to which little Harry just giggled slightly and Lily smiled tiredly before falling back to sleep.
"Head to the store room once you have written down these steps they will be up for the next fifteen minutes and then you have forty five to brew and submit a vial to me for testing" he said as he waved his wand at the board, making the instructions appear, he sat back delighted in the only sound of quills to parchment 'sometimes the rumours that proclaim I am a vampire, are useful it seems and soon it will actually be true, I wonder how that will impact my tolerance to teach the brats' he thought idly as students began moving to gather the correct ingredients.
Inheritance Delay Potion,
There wasn't even any warning as a scream erupted somewhere in the back of the room, namely Harry waking and feeling the discomfort of having said blocks removed, Dumbledore raised his wand briskly and attempted to cast a body severing charm at the goblin in front of him, his calm facade immediately discarded as his power froze most of the occupants in slight terror.
Ragnook,
"Wait I swear there's some kid in Slytherin called Rosier? I guess I have a family and just didn't know it no wonder Tom was smirking so jubilantly, may I know the extent of my Vault holdings Griphook?" Harry asked.
"Are you thirsty for something else, Piglet? My pig. Are you thirsty for cock?"
. Draco's never heard of it. He glances at Harry for approval, which Harry gives him with the smallest of nods. Harry is still holding his dragons, though, which Draco counts as a success overall.
Draco shudders as Harry nips at his nipples with his teeth. "Harry. What did she say?"
Draco flushes. "I was going to say
food bowl -- and on the DIRTY PIGLET lettering in Gryffindor colours.
Draco lets out a breath, and obeys. He likes being obedient so much. It makes his little cock hard. Such a little cock. As he takes his underwear off, it juts out, stiff and tiny. It's a relief that there's nothing in him that's built to dominate; he couldn't ever be the son his father wanted him to be. He's just what he is when he's with Harry: submissive, small, best on his knees. So, so submissive. Everything his father would have hated. He slips under the covers as Harry takes off his clothes and hangs them over the edge of the chest of drawers.
Draco reaches up and smoothes Harry’s wet hair away from his forehead, so that he can see Harry’s scar. "I’m going to look after you," he says finally. "Whatever you need. And I want there to be an
When he comes back, his pyjamas are neatly folded and he's done all the useful things like cleaning his teeth and using the toilet and washing his face. The dog bed is on the floor by Harry's side of the bed, and Harry's taken his pyjama top off, sitting up in bed still holding his cup of tea.
"Because I do," Harry says. "And because she got me off once, talking about you."
Harry takes some time to return, and when he does, he's changed his clothes into loose trousers and a jumper, and is carrying a small bag. The bag's far too small to hold anything useful, so Draco has to assume it's charmed. When Harry reaches into down to the elbow, and comes back out with a pet bed that's a different colour to the one they'd bought together in the Magical Menagerie shop, Draco suddenly understands that Harry's been out shopping for pet accessories for him.
Draco feels a little dazed still, a little removed. He nods, face slack. Harry leans in and presses his mouth to Draco’s. His tongue touches Draco’s. When he sits back there’s icing sugar on his chin.
"That's right, Piglet," Harry tells him. "Don't forget where you are. On your hands and knees in the mud. On a lead. Wearing my collar. A real piglet."
"Why aren't you more freaked out about this?" Harry asks.
"You worried me there for a while," Harry says, after a bit. "Thought I'd messed it up and hurt you. Did I?"
Draco tries to lick the remains of the cake from Harry’s hand, but Harry moves his hand away so that he can rub his hands together, cake smushing between his fingers, and then run his hands down Draco’s chest. He stops to pinch Draco’s nipples, and then down over his belly, only coming to a halt by his little cock.
"I'm sorry," Draco says, stroking his fingers through Harry's hair. "I didn't mean to."
"Apart from when you want to be."
"You should have tried to be my friend that first time you met me. Before you knew who I was."
Then he goes downstairs and knocks on the open sitting room door.
"A silly little cock," Draco echoes. "A silly little thing."
“I’ll tell you the story of Beauty and the Beast sometime,” Harry says.
"You can't fuck me, can you, Draco?" Harry says, breathless above him. "That cock's useless for that. This is the only thing you're good at. Sucking me off."
"There you go," Harry says. "There's my boy."
"And step," Harry says, telling him when to get on. Draco does, and doesn't die, which is nice. Harry keeps his arm around Draco's waist, which is also nice. He strokes his fingers over Draco's hip, and when they get to the top of the escalator he shuffles Draco off and onto solid ground, and towards the ticket barriers. Then he presses a card into Draco's hand, and tells him to tap and walk through the gates.

colors, this was a nice accent as it was a plain-yet-beautiful near-translucent-silver that was not overpowering while having accents of any color to match what outfit he was wearing. It was also less a cloak and more a long overcoat now, sleeves long enough and wide enough at the wrists to flare out some, hanging open to reveal his whole outfit, and dropping low enough to skim the top of the backs of his shoes. So, it gave his muggle outfit a definite wizard-like flair.
“Mr. Potter… the troll did in fact grab you, and apparently it squeezed very hard.” She explained gently, and Harry’s mind went blank.
he flexed his jaw tightly at the dark thoughts.
Harry thought wryly as he sat in yet another one of the Malfoy’s sitting rooms. Really, there had to be a dozen of them around the manor, as with every change of location they came back to yet another fancy sitting room with a different tray of tea following them if they needed it.
It had been a calculated risk. Gryffindor would

And Harry was slightly in despair to realize this talent of their very easily translated down a couple hundred meters into the grass of the quidditch pitch they'd been cleared to use for their football club, as he watched Fred and George kick a ball back and forth to each other with a positively terrifying speed and accuracy. Never done this before
Almost unwillingly he glanced at the figure over his right shoulder now, mind filling in what he was already assuming was happening, and maybe he didn’t recognize the man as he’d never seen him before in any pictures or even in the mirror looking back at him but—
The man looked startled, then grinned. “So the rumors of you growing up in the muggle world are true then? Excellent! Then yes: I took the concept of muggle contacts and spun them to my liking. I can alter them for your vision problems and any extra features you’d like—another bonus traditional optical spells don’t afford you! One pair will last about a year so the inconvenience is that you’ll have to come back every year or so for a new pair.”
“Yeah, couldn’t sleep.” He shrugged, suddenly feeling a little awkward to admit that. “I mean… I knew you’d be here eventually. You okay?”
Aside from her cut-throat business practices though, her main method of income was that she was nearly world-renowned as a Black Widow. Back to the fact she was insanely beautiful, she was also clever like a knife and so fiercely intelligent and devious that most never stood a snowball's chance in hell when she set her eyes on you. She was on husband number eleven, if Draco recalled correctly; his parents had been invited to all her weddings, although they’d forbade him from going. It meant that he had heard
ranks pretty low on stuff I care about right now.” Harry dismissed it entirely, before meeting his grey gaze with a wide green plead of his own. “I need your help.”
"You're not guilty, are you."
Draco paused and thought that over, Severus just letting him work it out and legitimately going back to grading his papers now in the silence.
“I said there was a
It was after dinner and his last minutes chores were done that he got back to his cupboard, the Dursleys watching TV and Dudley undoubtedly breaking another video game upstairs. He found the letter and shuffled up into a sitting position with a sigh to get it over with, his curiosity finally coming back to the surface now that he had an opportunity to quench it. It was a thick piece of paper, a kind he’d never seen before, and sealed with a chunk of melted wax, an “H” stamped into it. Even more curious he opened it and read…
a Dumbledore fan.
“Which team are you picking then, Harry?” Hannah asked curiously.
He turned a page and jotted down his new plans of action in best to worst order.
He had more than enough practice covering his lightning bolt scar with muggle make up, but the process of applying make up to his whole face was another challenge all by itself. Skills at covering one scar did not translate to being able to apply it full-face, nor the challenge covering grey, unhealthy skin with deep circles under his eyes turned out to be. It took him far too long and a lot of wasted makeup, and he was really hoping Pomfrey lived up to her promise of teaching him glamours as soon as possible in the coming school year.
“Now what does
"We should eat something, so we have time to get to our classes." Theodore smoothly changed the subject and started walking away from the conversation without another word or glance to the Gryffindors.
Voldemort sneered back, ire and anger responding in kind to Harry’s sharp tone.

The less he could think about the things he was still taking dreamless potions to escape from, the better. The more he could escape reality by imagining himself amongst his Monroe ancestors, imagining he was actually blood related to them and their odd quirks might somehow be reflected in the mirror when he looked into it, the more he felt
What the actual hell.
“I may be willing to trade,” He grinned and given they were very familiar with his trading habit they just gave him a dual thumbs up.

Axeclaw told him it was very possible. It was also entirely possible that Dumbledore
“Stop! Stop that, what are you doing!?” He balked, dropping his wand to shove the tiny creature away from the wall. “Don’t hit yourself—are you an idiot?” He cried incredulously.
"Still, something bothers me about the whole thing." Harry pouted, finally getting down to his breakfast now that he wasn’t simmering in curiosity.
He was

It wasn’t easy, as he hadn’t had to do math in over a year and getting back into it gave him a headache, but he was determined and it was for a good cause so he persevered and by Saturday night he thought he might just have it.
Maybe it was just because the boy was more unhinged then Harry was mentally prepared to understand just yet, which was a very real possibility that couldn’t be discounted, but in this moment Harry was more willing to think it proved that

"If I knew I'd definitely quit it immediately." He snipped with a grin. “You have good timing, I only just woke up and I’m about to be let go too.”
Unbeknownst to him, a certain potions professor was watching the exchange and having a bout of deja-bu so intense he almost needed to lie down. As it was, he gripped the edge of the high table for dear life, his head spinning in the sheer, painful nostalgia that coursed through him.
“Dean, I had
He’d already read his equipment list back-to-front a dozen times and as they’d walked down the street to the first shops and browsed through the paper shop first, he cataloged which ones would be the most worth his time and decidedly-not-hard-earned-money. Hagrid had said a trunk would be a big purchase, so there was that… and he knew books was going to be another large purchase since aside from his textbooks he needed to know more about the magical world than he currently did. He wasn’t particularly a bookworm but there was six weeks until September 1
Harry flinched at that, but was comforted that not even Draco would be able to have actually done that—he’d have needed his parents help to get his location from the Ministry, and while he didn’t put that past the elder Malfoys he also didn’t think they’d be happy to bend to their son’s will after only a week of being ghosted. That logic wouldn’t hold true forever though if he continued to not answer and the

“I will assemble the proper paperwork required and owl it to you for you to decide what to do with it. It is not actually connected to the Potter account but was in your mother’s name alone, so I was not involved with the details and the previous account manager who was has since died. It has stagnated in the years without someone tending to it but if you would like me to incorporate it into the Potter account responsibilities I would be able to do so.”
'5.. 4... 3.. 2.. WHAT..' "AH!!" I clenched my fists and jaw tightly suddenly, as I started rapidly convulsing, sprawled among my thin bed sheets as blinding waves of intense agony spike throughout my body, as if my blood was turned acidic, liquidating what's left of my innards after my daily dose of Dursley malnutrition.
He stopped just outside the Hogwarts' gates and disapperated to Knockturn Alley, hoping the man was indoors and also that he would catch Wormtail off guard in the process, 'the slippery Rat won't get away from us easily' he thought as he trudged past the dingy dark arts shop Borgin And Burkes, careful not to antagonize any of the witches and wizards purchasing their wares.
Blood Magic (100%)
On closer inspection however the door was blown out with charred wooden cracks along its' frame, after quickly examining it he noted the spell residue that was lingering appeared to be work of the Dark Lord "seems he went for a grand entrance and didn't have the time to spare to eradicate his raids evidence" he muttered to himself in contemplation as he eyed the damage before walking up the path to examine the inside of the bottom floor.
Black Vault: 250,700 Galleons, 70 Sicles and 40 Knuts (Accessible), 20 artifacts and 10 rare tomes remaining.
The others just stood in awe and slack jawed shock at how Harry could take those hits head on and negate them before it destroyed the barrier and them, the Shaytan was also very intrigued 'Must be the power of the three magic sapping entities he destroyed, he wouldn't have such power otherwise this is the moment a god is born within a child, I am glad I was still alive to see this and feel even more confident my powers will only strengthen this boy and bring back the glory our world has been denied for centuries' he thought to himself as he smirked slightly, flashing his fangs in amusement, watching the slow demise of Harry's current victim.
"Nice one Lil's you are teaching him new vulgar words already" James laughed, wagging his finger, "if you are going to teach him colourful words, teach him to say twat so Sirius can get a laugh out of being called it, but hush make sure his first words aren't vulgar ones, as we both know he will learn to speak before he does anything else but crawl and if you feel up to watching him make sure he doesn't climb the walls, despite it being within his ability even at his age of a day old, this will be strenuous to keep an eye on someone like him, especially for you whilst you are bed ridden, shall I ask for Paddy to assist you?" James asked in concern and then smirked "We have a lot more to handle with such a baby, we need to spell things unbreakable to him or he will escape and break everything easily as you have noticed his strength".
This hypothesis was intriguing to Severus and by extension Dumbledore though for different reasons, to Severus it seemed the boy had a type of Hypermagi Sensia, the art allowing someone to sense magic within its' non-corpral form and draw either from its' untapped strength or disperse it before someone performed their spell providing it was a worded incarnation, similar to the dark arts occlumens spell Interceptum that essentially does the same and taps into those abilities however is made available for those who don't truly have the talent or the will power to master such a difficult branch of magic, though they couldn't be sure, it could be it was just him being as babies are, only time will tell, Dumbledore however seemed more convinced it was not unlikely that the child possessed this gift and he was already making plans towards the creatures' untapped potential if it proved to be true later in its' life.
As if by sixth sense far away James got a chill down his spine as if danger was coming despite his happy routine trying to distract Harry with a baby magic rattle "I swear if you keep biting that son it will break, there's already several punctures in the thing! I'm surprised the magic still works after you sapped it you silly bugger!" He laughed.
"I targeted both their memories of the recent day and attempted to both fry the memories of me and their inherent magical gifts, if they could not establish a connection with their gifts, they would lose them, in Ms Tonks case her metamorphamagus ability and Mr Shackelbolt's wandless casting ability making them virtually useless and easy to dispose of if the need arose, neurology is always intriguing when combined with the mind arts despite how muggle the concept is" Dumbledore said with airy tone.
"Poppy start a C section it is the only way to save them both! Albus focus on spelling the blood from expelling, I will keep healing the current uterus damage and making the clean incision until the little fiend is out of her!" Severus shouted, James glared venemously at this but couldn't stop him or they would both die, all three quickly got to work.
Petunia had her back to me as I stood in the doorway, she was hunched over the sink scrubbing away at the tell tail signs of this mornings breakfast 'seems I missed breakfast maybe there is something in the fridge' I thought reaching for the fridge handle to check, when Petunia spun around and screamed at me hysterically.
Borgin stared at him through the open door as he past in apprehension 'why is that Auror here? If he comes to inspect the stores, I will have to move the more dark pieces into the vault before he makes a beeline for me, why is he muttering angrily to a rat of all things? Well as long as he doesn't yet approach me things should be fine once I store my wares more securely' Borgin thought with a intrigued yet sour expression gracing his haggard and sunken appearance.
Harry blinked at the question before indulging in a beautiful smile "Of course mother he will have anything and everything he desires and more if I can provide it, I will say this however I spoke to Tom recently he wished me to join again given my new nature he thought he could help me grow stronger which i agree with but he is still the reason my parents died so joining as anything other than an equal wasn't entertained in the conversation, I will be taking his offer but I will not take part in his war unless I require revenge on certain people, my wrist braclet here is a port key made by him, I may see you all at home quite soon if I decide to take his offer, that may soothe you Draco that I am able to cater for all aspects of your life, what say you all?" He asked.
Draco blinks at him. "Potter," he says carefully. "The things I put up with for you. How have you not pushed Ron off a cliff yet?"
"Can you imagine how dirty you'd get?" Harry continues, like Draco's not falling apart. "How filthy you'd be, what you'd look like? How desperate you'd be to come."
Harry, thankfully, doesn't focus on the fact that Draco has nobody. Or on the fact that his mother was so disappointed by how Draco fared on the marriage mart that she removed to the continent. He dips some of the bread into the little dish of olive oil instead, and takes a bite. "I'm going to tell Hermione we're taking it slowly," he says, before dipping the remainder of the bread into the balsamic vinegar. "That I'm careful about what we are, because it's important to me."
Harry laughs. He drops his knee and wraps his arms around Draco's shoulders. Draco slides his hands into the small of Harry's back. They sway a little, awkward, like they're dancing but with no music.
now. Unless you don't want me in your room, but otherwise I'm staying with you."
"Little one?"
"Next time?"
"Crawl after me," Harry says, already setting off across the hall, and the lead pulls on Draco's collar as he stumbles to follow him. Draco, crawling like an animal, a pet, like he's less than human. He leaves his pile of clothes discarded behind him on the entrance hall floor, alongside a little damp patch where he'd licked the floor clean of his come.
He thumbs out a
from all those years ago. It's certainly not the time to consider that Draco's never kissed anyone. The realisation that he'd liked boys had rather put an end to his early Hogwarts exploration, and then he'd really rather fucked his life up by driving himself to the brink with that stupid fucking vanishing cabinet and everything that had come after it, and after that, he wasn't exactly marketable on the marriage circuit, regardless of how hard his mother had tried.
"I thought we could have breakfast in front of the fire," Draco says, going over to the little pantry-kitchen through the doorway in the corner. It all links through to the kitchen cupboards so they won't ever be short of anything. He lights the fire with a charm, and hopes Harry won't notice how heavily warded the fireplace is; he remains terrified of fire, and even more scared of anyone else finding out. It doesn't do to let people have access to your fears. "Toasted teacakes and tea, I thought? Unless you'd like warm milk?"
"No need to be ashamed," Draco echoes. He presses his mouth to Harry's throat. "That goes for you too."
"This excited just from me buying you a food bowl, like an animal. We were in public, Draco, and you were two seconds from getting your cock out and wanking right there. Weren't you?"
"I want the ones downstairs," Draco says. "I don't want these."
Harry, who settles his hand on Draco's hip and steps a little closer into Draco's space. Draco's first inclination is to bolt, but he resists and instead doesn't react at all, not even to lean back towards Harry.
Draco leans in and presses a kiss to the centre of Harry's forehead, catching the corner of Harry's scar. "We'll have a story after breakfast," he says, remembering the few times his mother read to him when he was small. "But first, tea and toasted teacakes."
"So," Harry says after a minute. "How have you been?"
But Harry sits back on his heels, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand, and wraps his fist around his own cock again.
"Just a chapter," Harry says. "We can come back to it another time."
“One who, perhaps, wasn’t all that invested in house unity.”
He stays.
"Good," Harry says, like their conversation is completely normal and all right and isn't setting Draco's world just off kilter. "I'll get one for you."
"Look how hard you are," Harry says, with a smirk. "Hard because I made you eat from the floor. Do you think I should let you come?"
"The cupboard? Forgotten under one of the staircases downstairs. I've warded that, too. No one will disturb it." He slips his hand into Harry's again. "Come on. Let me show you the way."
"I'm happy," Harry says, and Draco, his heart pounding, tucks his face into the curve of Harry's shoulder, and holds on.
Draco swallows. "All right."
Draco stands up. It feels a bit monumental, even achieving that. His pants feel disgusting. He takes his coat off and he's too out of it to do much more with it than leave it over the arm of the sofa, and then slips off his shoes. Harry's already undoing the laces with his wand.
"Come and lie over my lap," Harry says, and Draco doesn't understand why he'd do that, or why Harry would even ask, but he does it anyway, confused and uncertain.
He stays standing as Harry's on his knees, and then Harry's taking Draco's cock in his hand and leaning in, and Draco's cock is in Harry's mouth and,
Draco doesn't react at all. "Maybe, Sir," he says finally, and with a flick of his wand his measuring tape unfurls and starts to do its work.
"Can we--" he stops, for a second. He closes his eyes. "Leave everything for a while," he says. "Just let me be here, with you. Like this."
Harry shakes his head. "Not today," he says, which is indication if indication were required that Harry is distinctly overwhelmed.
"That's right," Harry agrees. "Roll over."
"No," Harry says. He's standing close enough to Draco that Draco can tell he's washed his face too, his shirt collar unbuttoned. "I didn't really take very much away from the Dursleys, other than a general understanding of how not to bring up children--"
"You're the best thing I've ever seen in my life," Harry goes on, and Draco feels drunk with it, half-awake and drowning in how much he feels. "I know you get off on me telling you how useless your cock is—" to prove his point, Draco's cock jerks a little at the compliment — "but you've got to know, you've got to know, Draco, that it's fucking perfect. You're perfect."
"Yes," Draco says, because it had taken him long enough to ever ask for what he needed, and he'd asked it of strangers in a bar, his glamour spells practiced for years. It had led him right to Harry's feet.
"By the way," Harry says, under cover of darkness. "Hermione asked us both to come to dinner. I said I'd let her know if we were free."
It has been a while, but I never forget about this story and I'm always going to come back to it. Hope you're staying safe in these difficult times xx
"Go to sleep," Harry says, without opening his eyes. He reaches a little blindly for Draco's hand under the covers. "It's all right. You can go to sleep."
"I do," Draco says, before he realises he'd said he deserved something, when he doesn't deserve anything.
He doesn't want to go back through the door and into the cottage. He's dirty. He'll make the floor a mess. Harry has to tug on his lead before he realises what's stopping Draco from coming in.
he murmurs as he hands the bottle to Harry before crouching down to give Rose her cup.
"Most people wouldn't say that what we do is kind."
"Cool," Harry says. "Look, M&S is over there."
"Please," Draco says. "Please do that. Make me be good. Make me be nothing."
"Potter."
"Everyone could see your shame," Harry carries on, breath warm agains Draco's skin. "Would you like that, Piglet? Being put on display like that. Being put on display and then ignored."
Draco nods. The thrill of being owned sings across his skin. All these years, all these endless years of being in charge and being desperate not to be, it had never coalesced into anything before he was with Harry and Harry promised him he wasn't in control anymore. "Property of Harry Potter."
Draco lets out a breath, and tries not to panic.
Draco has never stayed anywhere so small in his life.
"I don't even know if it ever was," Harry says. "I feel like I've just been, like, obsessed with you for the whole time I've known you."
"And then I want to go somewhere I can kiss you."
Draco warms with the praise, with the idea, with the promise. "Please," he says finally. "Please."
"I'm not wearing something that comes out of a carrier bag," Draco says.
"Absolutely not," Harry agrees. He elbows Draco, and it's only semi-awkward. "Anyway, next time you can come and be the person laughing at me as I'm trying on clothes. If you'd like."
"All right," Harry says.
Draco makes a soft sound of approval in the back of his throat.
Ron produces one bottle and one plastic cup with a lid and a drinking spout, magically warmed, judging by the
"We can do magic," Draco says. "That saves on washing up too."
"I know," Harry says. "Dirty little piglet. What are you?"
"To all of us," he says. He metaphorically squares his shoulders. "Was there something in particular you wanted?"
"I mean," Harry says. "I mean I want you to treat me like I’m little. Like, bottles and blankets and whatever else you give babies. I want to know what that feels like, I want to know what that comfort feels like, and I want to not care about anything else in the whole fucking world, and I want to hand that responsibility over to someone else, just for a bit. I want."
"My beautiful, humiliated boy," Harry says, and he reaches up then, reaches up and cups Draco's cheek in his hand. "My beautiful boy, Draco. Mine. So fucking mine, all right?"
A guy comes through and asks Draco if he wants to suck his dick. It's a little casual, a little lazy, and Draco doesn't want that. He only wants people to be casual with
And Draco, his cocklet hanging between his legs, shame burning through his body, follows Harry down the hall on his hands and knees.
"Not today," he says.
Draco had spent his holidays either on the continent or at home, at endless dinners where he had to dress up and remember which fork to use and which grown ups to talk to about what. "I think so," he says. "They'd probably have the time of their lives."
Harry eventually obliges, dropping down onto the blanket next to him.
"He was obsessed," Ron says, warming to his topic. "Hated you, he did. Went on and on, all sixth year--"
"It just--"
Draco aches to say yes, but he stays silent. His mouth hangs open. A dumb animal.
"No," Harry says. "Thought I’d limit my obsessive tendencies to just you. Habit of a lifetime."
"I masturbate a lot," Harry tells him, like that's an okay thing to share.
"Tea is always nice." It's been a long day. Draco's still got a couple of things to do to Ginny Weasley's wards, so he'd spent all yesterday layering some complex charms and it hadn't gone well. He'd had to push back yesterday afternoon's appointment 'til this morning, which meant that he's behind, and he's had to call in the support of his on-call House Elves to finish packing his belongings. They've been instructed to clean his Scottish house from top to bottom too, even though they're on a retainer and come in once a week to look after it.
Draco obediently doesn't touch. He inches forward until he can open his mouth and slide it around Harry's cock. His lips close around his length. Harry's heavy against his tongue and Draco has to fight the urge to suck. Saliva pools in his mouth.
Harry looks at him. "Would you prefer that?"
Draco nods. He can't do anything other. His little cocklet is dying to be touched. Harry's ignoring it.
Draco almost drops his needle.
, he tells himself.
is another way of talking about Harry's post-traumatic stress disorder. Hermione's parents were muggles, they'd call it that too.
"Merlin," Harry says. "All right."
"Thought everyone knew I was a coward," Draco says. "Just a weaselly little coward. That's what they say, isn't it?"
"I would," Draco says, although he’s not entirely certain he’s clear where his own lines are, at least not yet. He doesn’t feel scared of them, though, and he’s been scared of most things his entire adult life.
"Honestly, do you think if we'd had any kind of real teenage years, you would have got better at the kind of innuendo you're quite clearly desperate to slip into every bit of conversation?"
"Don’t feel sorry for me," Harry says. "I’m fine and I’m alive."
Draco, obedient until the end, lets out a breath, and closes his eyes.
"There you go," Harry says. "Cause for celebration."
“So let me read you this story you were talking about. About the Beast in the castle.”
should be doing that, but it just… doesn't feel like the kind of situation where Draco should speak. They haven't talked about that - haven't talked about
"Chicken's in the oven, we'll eat at some point before midnight." Harry and Ron share some kind of commiserating look. Draco doesn't understand why. "Do you want a drink?"
Uncover, and put on display.
Draco's cock drips pre-come onto the tiles. He's making more of a stain already, this dirty part of him that's dirtying his family's flat as well as himself. He rocks his hips down.
He drifts, after a while, the tip of Harry's cock heavy against his tongue. He doesn't hold him deep, and it's easy enough to breathe around him, even if it's not so easy to stop himself from drooling a little, spit running down his chin. Harry ignores him, other than an occasional hand in his hair, reading one of the books from the little shelf under the window. It's a romance novel from the eighties, the front cover showing a librarian witch with a book in one hand and a wand in the other, whilst the hero - a broad shouldered fellow with a tie on show beneath his smart robes - smiles at her seductively. He can't imagine it's the kind of thing that Harry would normally read, but his attention seems more than focused. He doesn't let it turn to Draco at all, but why would it? Draco's nothing more than something to be used, a
"I don't--" Harry loosens his fingers from around Draco's dick. There's a long pause. "When you look after me, you know. Like you're going to. Like you said you would when we go to Scotland. I don't think it's sexual. It might be sometimes. But it's just this weird thing I need, and this is like, the sexual part of it? And that bit's a fantasy. At least for now."
, that's just what you are."
"I am," Draco says. "A full valet service, Sir." His skin's flushed.
"Nothing, huh?" Harry keeps stroking his fingers over Draco's arse, and down to cup his balls again. "What does that mean?"
"I'm late," Harry says from the doorway, amused. He takes off his coat, draping it over his arm before leaning up against the door frame. He doesn't come in. "I was all geared up to apologise."
"I was going to wait until we were back inside," Harry says. "But I think you might be doing your best impression of being hungry for cock."
"Just a warm hole, aren't you?" Harry says. "That's all you're good for."
"Just saying. Could get you over at any time. Any time I didn't want to make a mess of anything valuable."
"Hmm," Harry says. "I think she thinks I want to sleep with you."
"Do you remember how I fucked your thighs as you smeared cake across your face, darling?"
Turning around on his knees, there's a plate on the floor. His cock jerks.
"Draco--"
"This was a business arrangement," Draco says weakly.
He’s never slept with someone at his side and woken up early to plan tiny, careful changes to the nursery upstairs, and what he needs to procure to put his plans in place.
Harry just rolls his eyes at him, but he's grinning. He sits back in the chair, legs going wide. "Have at it, then, Piglet. Make me come."
"As you wish." The cold is starting to settle beneath the warming charm. The clouds keep hiding the moon. "We should go in."
It's still dark when he wakes to find Harry slipping into the bed next to him.
Draco leans over and touches the Gryffindor red. "This would remind Piglet who owns him," Draco says, and there's a possibility he's turning as red as the bowl. This glamour might blush more than he does. Draco's embarrassment tends to sit on the inside, like an ever-burning fire.
"I can do it myself," Harry says, but he doesn't sound particularly fierce about it. His hair's all sticking up on end.
"I don't know," Harry says. "If this is a uniform, it's not very clear at showing who you serve."
"Why don't you come and sit down?" Draco asks, after another minute passes and Harry doesn't move.
"I can imagine," Harry says, and maybe he can, because he's reaching down and cupping Draco's little dick through his trousers. "My lovely round piglet."
"I do," Draco says. "But I didn't even know. How did you know when I didn't?"
"Are you all right?" he asks.
Draco's ordered a new frame, but he hasn't told Harry and he can't imagine a situation where he can give it to him. The order's still been sent, though, and when he stands in the entrance to the room early on Saturday afternoon, shirt sleeves rolled up, the room looks different. It looks cleaner and fresher, empty of all Harry's belongings bar the furniture. He's changed the layout, changed where the bed is and the wardrobes so that the light is better.
Again, Severus had an idea of how to protect Draco regardless of what Quirrell did or did not see
Draco narrowed his grey eyes sharply, not buying it for a second. “
Returning to his bed, as he got deeper into his pile, he was
Legally, the judge could do whatever the hell they thought was best for a ward and there was no repercussions for it. Even the ‘trial’ for it was a farce at best as there didn’t need to be any set court date or anyone but the judge themselves present to make the decree, and no you could not petition to have the judge’s decision appealed or reconsidered.
Roses might work too, but they had thorns and Hogwarts didn’t grow any variety of them for now. They were hard to grow, and took years to do it right.
The dementors behind her fell back and seemed to peak their nightmarish hooded heads into nearby cells as if double checking if they consume or not. She heard soft whimpers and one gargling half-screech so she knew those nearby were more than preoccupied temporarily as she went to the bar of what she assumed was the right cell.

“Well, actually yes those are the bones I was talking about. If Madam Pomfrey healed you after that incident though, there is no reason they shouldn’t have healed entirely the week after it happened, unless something else was going on. I suppose the lack of nutrition in recent months might’ve contributed to them resurfacing if you had a magical core deficiency or something, but other than that it’s a brain-scratcher for one.” She pressed her lips as if trying to figure out a complicated puzzle, tapping her wand distractedly again, but her words send an alarm bell off in his head.
Harry laughed lightly under his breath. “You’re hopeless.”

She was very polite and her tone was either genuinely warm, or a perfect fake of it and the fact Harry legitimately could not tell which one it was kind of terrified him a bit.

“My parents were in Gryffindor, I hear, so maybe there? And I do like making friends so even Hufflepuff wouldn’t be that bad. But then again I’m pretty quick on my feet and I know what I want, so Slytherin wouldn’t be a bad pick either.” He reflected lightly. He raised a brow at the ugly scowl that crossed Ron’s face at that.
Instead of pity she clearly was just thinking it was impressive he was alive, which he kind of liked.

His chest was moving in silent breathes, almost hyperventilating to a point as his anger took hold and probably overwhelmed him with emotion he hadn’t had to deal with in years. He moved, but didn’t seem to know what to do with his own body.

from just walking in then? I thought you said it’s a big secret.”
And Blaise wasn’t stupid, he knew immediately that the slightly louder hissing had been something key, looking abruptly distressed for once.
Everyone was talking too loud, he couldn’t focus for long periods of time on any one conversation, when he withdrew from conversations he felt bad for being antisocial but when he was part of it he felt awkward and annoyed by all the sounds and movement around him, he had a headache that was only getting worse, and his shoulders started to feel sore from the tension that was slowly mounting underneath his facade of calm without him noticing. The dread he felt for the train actually making it home, the desperation to enjoy what little time he had left and therefore ruining it by being too desperate, the slowly mounting irritation at everything around him…
Harry was having a really, really weird morning.

She stared at him, with a better poker face than most but she was not as good as some of her housemates. Conflict, indecision, and even a sliver of fear played out across her face, and he was curious as to what she was thinking but resigned himself to just waiting patiently for her to work it out.
, and that old wish of hoping her bottled emotions would slowly strangle her one day seemed to bubble up tumultuously from the depths of his repressed emotions every time he remember back to that incident.

"Even amongst Slytherins it's… I mean, the last living person who was a parseltongue was the dark lord." Draco seemed to falter as he explained that, and Harry took another too-long minute to absorb that.
She would never tell Severus this, but honestly the mother-hen like traits the young Draco Malfoy was showing every time Harry got into trouble seemed
"Ah! So much red hair!" He blurted out in surprise, and the twins burst out in startled laughter at that.
Harry paid close attention to Draco’s notes on yesterday’s potion though, already having a sinking suspicion that it was going to pop up on an exam or even their final eventually.
He got several compliments on it from several people, mostly Hannah who gushed over it and Blaise had taken much glee from layering on back-handed compliments thick before Draco had resorted to punching his roommates’ side, distracting them both into bickering amongst themselves. Draco had
Way belatedly he realized he had no idea what happened to his own wand… clearly it hadn’t helped him though… and yet…

He patted his friend on the arm tensely. “Draco seriously,
He heard more than saw Quirrell’s wand lash out, the swish of his robe sleeve sharp and without hesitation as he cast a wordless spell.

He was a bit depressed he immediately recognized the thick scent of copper in the air.

Lucius was going to get involved of course, he could even use the favor gifted to the son to cash in something from the father while earning more credibility in Draco’s eyes. A win-win, for all but Lucious which is exactly what the prick deserved in Severus’ opinion.
