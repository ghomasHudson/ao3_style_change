Draco glanced at each of them in turn, mentally cataloguing the various reasons they might have to hate him. He was civil with the youngest two, but surely the one with Greyback's scars wanted to give Draco a matching set for opening Hogwarts to the werewolf in the first place. Draco wondered what he might be able to say to ease the tension when Weasley—shit, that wasn't going to work, was it?—Granger's Weasley broke the silence.
Aamu smiles to herself as the young men approach in step with each other. Mehiläinen is holding a pot of his honey, and Kauko is smiling at her through the window.
When their rhythm settled, Potter stopped speaking and they continued in awkward silence. Draco ignored the hot, firm press of Potter's body against his and the earthy smell that had little to do with the field around them. He didn't notice the way Potter's muscular thighs pulled on the fabric of his trousers as he—
Draco nodded and then realised Potter couldn't see it. Oh well. He pulled his finger out and then shoved it back in again. He repeated it several times, but Potter seemed just as tense and his cock had gone limp.
Harry glared at the fireplace where his friend's face had been. He was teased enough about his friendship with Draco without getting it from Ron, too. What was so odd about being close friends with his flatmate, anyway?
He was grateful that the road was surprisingly free of rocks, because no clothes meant nothing protecting his feet.  It had also meant no obvious place to stow his wand, so he clutched it awkwardly by his side lest someone think he was on the attack.
On weekends, Harry would pester Draco into spending time at his cottage with him.  He was probably just lonely now that his two best friends were married to each other.  And Draco found he didn't mind helping Harry tend his garden or going for long walks through the neighbouring farmland.
One by one the seven Weasleys filed in with snarky comments and playful ribbing. Luckily most of it was aimed at one another, and Draco received nothing but praise for the breakfast he served them. When Draco set out packed lunches for them to take to work, more than one eye looked dangerously moist.
Well, Draco could still be polite. He still had his integrity. “Yes, of course. Thank you for calling. We do understand. What were the dates of your reservation?”
"It’s signed! They signed it! It’s passed!" Draco and Hermione shared a very bouncy hug before they ran over to hug Harry and Oliver.
Draco had suspected it might not be his day when he stubbed his toe on the way from his bed to the toilet. His suspicion was confirmed when Blaise informed him that his uncle—who he'd never even met!—was trying to kill him.
Blaise nodded solemnly. "You tasted that cake, and Ginny is actually a better cook than most of her siblings."
It wasn’t true. Harry didn’t have his own room. He did, however, have a favourite Healer who had him patched up and out the door in less than five minutes.
Potter didn’t smile. He looked rather tense. “Yeah, well we talked a lot about who we don’t like. But um … what about who you do?”
Draco had yet to resist this odd witch who looked enough like him to be family and yet was nothing like him at all. "I promise."
me?”  Harry was pretty sure that should be obvious, but he nodded again.  Draco just blinked a few times before his features morphed into his usual haughty smirk.  “And
Was Harry supposed to strip? Or was he supposed to take off Draco's clothes? He rather liked the idea of Draco fully exposed for him to admire. Even when he'd see Draco half-naked in the mornings, Harry would force his eyes away so he wouldn't be caught staring at the trail of light blond hair that ran down his flat stomach from his navel.
Murmured voices and hazy light filled his consciousness. He groaned and the voices became excited. He blinked and the Weasley kitchen slowly came into focus. He was looking up at the hob. From the floor. Glancing down his body, he saw torn silver silk and everything came back to him.
Draco was still and silent, so Harry pulled back just enough to meet his eyes. His face was completely blank, torturing Harry by telling him nothing.
“Oh look!  He's so very sorry,” she'd mocked.  “Honestly, Draco.  You're looking for a shag not a bridegroom.  Who cares if he runs off to work mid-dinner?  He still paid, right?  So get your shag and get over it.”
In any event, it was Monday morning and Draco had a new boss to earn favour with, so he slipped from bed and headed for the shower.  He certainly needed it.
It was three weeks until the full moon, so they made good use of their beds, sofas, and tables in the meantime.  In the end, Harry found himself shagged senseless in a meadow as his luminous stag bounded protectively around where Draco and he lay among the grass and clover.  He wasn't sure if it warded off any invisible creatures, but the sight of Draco in the moonlight with his hair mussed up and his cheeks still flush from exertion was enough for him to decide Luna had some damn good ideas.
“Yes, yes. Send them in!” Robards gestured for his Aurors to shove down and make room for more. It was a spacious office, but Harry hoped too many people weren’t coming in.
Draco nodded. He was grateful to know Potter didn’t intend to ignore him or forget everything that had happened.
“I said, piss off!”  He was now face to face with the cretin, who was a little shorter than Draco, but broader, and had a nasty grin on his face.
Draco scowled. He did not like the idea of Potter being obsessed with someone. But no. If Potter wanted someone, he'd have the person by now. Potter got everything he wanted, right? "Don't be ridiculous, Pansy. Just get planning. The education phase is almost complete and I don't want to waste any time beginning the infiltration."
Draco pulled Potter into a fierce kiss that would prevent either of them from speaking. He had been struggling to accept that Potter was even open to his advances before Potter threw in the mention of his months-old interest. The idea that Potter found him too distracting to cook around was too much.
He was still tall; even with Harry’s late growth spurts, Malfoy had a few inches on him. He was still slender, although he had filled out across his chest and shoulders so that his torso created an enticing V-shape as it tapered down to his slim hips.  And he was still pale.
Weasley patted the empty stool on his left and Draco turned a panicked look to Potter. Potter just shrugged and took the seat two down from Weasley. Draco stared at the empty seat between the two wizards he had once considered enemies and very nearly bolted.
don’t understand,” Merryn snapped back, abandoning the dishes and drying her hands on her pinny. “I’ve seen people try to drive you away, and you stayed. They tried to ruin everything we are trying to build here. If people knew about me they would know you’re different. It could save the hotel!”
“Aren’t you going to invite me in?” She was twirling a strand of smooth black hair around her finger and looking up at him coyly, but he wasn’t having it.
Bârlog had only one inn to shelter any tourists or researchers visiting the reserve, and it housed the village’s only pub, which was also its only restaurant.
Blaise was physically powerful, but there were plenty of people who were not intimidated by his brawn.  If Draco wanted the groping to end, he would need a better type of power.  Clearwater was out; Draco was nowhere near desperate enough to shag a woman, and she would be leaving soon anyway.  Sothman?  Merlin, no!  No!  It would be better to lose his job.  Besides, he really only had power within the Department of Intoxicating Substances.
Draco wasn't sure what to make of it all, but he was sure it wasn't good. He wished McGonagall and Pomfrey would stop their furtive whispering and tell them what the fuck was going on. They stood on the other side of the Hospital Wing with their heads as close together as their Bubblehead Charms would allow. The fact that they wouldn’t breathe the same air as Draco and his group was further cause for alarm.
The silence returned and hung over him. He was surprised his legs and feet weren't tired from his walking. Could his body tire when he was dead? Surely, this body wasn't real.
However, as he sat on that supple leather and nursed a perfectly made mojito, his mind kept returning to the Lovegood field and the evening at The Witch's Brew. Clearly he needed more exciting friends if they couldn't hold his attention against someone as uninteresting as Potter.
others. Slytherin hadn't been a big place for hugging—Pansy excluded—and Draco's occasional pulls had always skipped those more romantic gestures.
Draco slid down Potter's body until he was facing Potter's cock. He could do this. And if he gagged, so be it. Potter already knew this was Draco's first time. He lapped at the head of Potter's cock and heard an appreciative moan overhead. Well that was a good sign. He opened his mouth and took Potter in. The taste was a bit unusual, but not unpleasant. It really just tasted like skin, except for the bitterness of the moist head.
"I shouldn't have teased you about your—" Apparently Potter had learned to censure himself. "We need to work together, right? Kingsley wants the fair to bring people together and show we can cooperate. It'd look good if you and I could do that."
The Muggle research had led to an interest in football, so Harry had bough him tickets to the European Cup the year before. It had seemed a good idea
Most of the guests were people Harry liked, but there were some exceptions, the most blatant being Parkinson. The dislike was mutual, as she demonstrated by glaring at Harry as she arrived. Luckily she kept her mouth shut, simply snatching a flute of champagne and walking off to join Blaise in the living room.
Stepping into a cosy living room lit only with warm candlelight, Draco decided that perhaps they were fully into Phase Four after all. Potter was at his side in an instant, offering wine and relieving Draco of the chocolates he'd brought with a smile and a hint of a blush.
Harry turned back to the table to see Hermione glaring at him. Neville, Ginny, and Oliver looked as confused as Harry felt, so there was no use asking them for an explanation. But he really didn’t fancy asking the friend whose usually-kind brown eyes were burning into him.
A moment later, another elf arrived for Draco and Potter and squeaked at them to follow it. They were walking down the stairs when it occurred to Draco that the rooms were intended for faculty.
He steadied himself against his dizziness and the shouts of greeting.  Opening his eyes, he saw a blur of ginger hair and smiles.  He smiled back.  A whoosh behind him announced Draco, and Harry could almost have cried when not one of the ginger smiles vanished.
Draco could have pointed out that he had been ignoring Potter as much as Potter had ignored him, but he really just wanted the conversation over with. He directed Potter to the jazz station and then ignored the look Potter gave him that suggested he had more to say.
Harry led the way to the first wind tunnel with only the solid pressure of Draco’s hand on his shoulder to assure him Draco was still with him. At the mouth of the tunnel, Harry stopped and ran his own hand up Draco’s arm to his shoulder. He leaned close to where he hoped his ear would be, sensing his warmth and the smell of summer days despite the chill of night around them. “I’ll stand watch,” he whispered. “You check the plants.”
If not for the charm on Harry’s jeans, his aching cock would have been crushed against the zipper. He dropped one hand to fumble with the opening of his jeans, desperate for pressure to reduce his torture.
Potter appeared at nine with tea for two—in crisp white cups that spoke of a proper tea shop and not the Ministry cafeteria—and a shy smile. They talked about the weather and Quidditch, but Draco found himself smiling by the time Potter left him to his work. He stared at his desk for a long moment before opening a file and pulling out a report on Cursed quills.
It had been hard to watch Kauko try and fail. His heart has grown so big. She sees him trying so hard. He starts to falter. Mehiläinen is there by his side.
"Mind if I use your Floo to get back? I have all of these shrunken robes in my pocket, and I worry what the rain will do to the silk."
Potter rose, stepped forward, and kissed Draco on the mouth. It was tender and full of affection, and it made Draco doubt his belief that this was a simple one-off. Potter pulled away and a goofy grin broke across his face.  He ran his hand down Draco's cheek in a gentle stroke and then kissed the side of his mouth.
Draco waited for the awkwardness to come, but instead there was just the slide of Potter's hand on his back and the rustling of the breeze that carried the smell of sweet flowers and grass to mix with the saltiness of theirs sweat. Well that just showed that they were adults now; they could admit a sexual attraction and satisfy a basic physical need without making it into something complex and emotionally messy.
“You were thinking about me with a dildo up your arse?” Draco clarified, and Harry hated him for it.
Draco's mouth fell open and he released a stuttered breath.  "Fuck, Harry.  You're going to make me come before I get a chance."
, was Flintridge, and Harry tensed at the sight of him. Flintridge took a step forward, which would have brought his chest to Draco's, but Draco side-stepped away from the wall. Harry's breath came out in a choked laugh at the manoeuvre.
Luckily, Harry and Oliver were both popular public figures and could do a lot to help improve the public perception of beasts. Oliver had gotten Puddlemere to have a little girl with Lycanthropy release the Snitch to start the final game of the season. The sweet-faced child who had barely escaped Fenrir with her life melted the hearts of even the gruffest Quidditch fans in the stadium.
Draco was looking at him expectantly, and Harry realised he was daydreaming instead of responding. 'No, I like doing the crossword at home.'
"Welcome back." Harry would have said it to most anyone from their year at Hogwarts, but Malfoy looked so pleased with the simple words. The appreciation encouraged Harry to continue. "What will you do when you return?"
Draco glanced over at him and laughed. “Don’t worry. It’s not as bad as it sounds. He sent me to the kitchens as punishment once. To embarrass me by making me out like a house-elf. Nothing lower than that, right? But it was wonderful. No Dark Lord flicking curses about. No werewolves. No snakes. Not even other Death Eaters trying to look good by taking me down a notch. It was just me and the elves.
He was hungrier than he’d usually be midday, having had only toast for breakfast. He simply couldn't justify making his usual fry-up for one after weeks of cooking for two. He grabbed a roll of bread from the breadbox and took a bite. It was a bit stale—Draco would have thrown it out two days before—but it was sustenance.
“I’m holidaying at the Hotel Kalmynsi, and my stay will overlap with the Angove-Bronstein wedding, which I have kindly been invited to attend while there.”
"Don't mind him," the scarred one assured Draco. "He's a harmless flirt. If you don't have wings and breathe fire, you won't hold his attention more than a minute."
His mother took a long sip of tea that Draco suspected was to hide a smile or drown a comment. He decided he was better off not knowing.
. . . with me?' He struggled to make sense of the sentence. He knew all of the words, and yet couldn't understand that particular arrangement.
He set the parchment in front of Harry and then walked around the desk until his robes were gently brushing against Harry’s arm. “These,” he pointed at the first column, “are unregulated. They are so common that they can be bought at any apothecary or grown in a garden.”
And Malfoy was indeed a mystery, Harry thought as he allowed himself a second flute of champagne. He usually limited himself to one drink before dinner, but tonight's cocktail hour felt endless. It didn't help matters that, for once, Hermione wasn't with him. Oliver had finally convinced her to take a short vacation with him, and they had booked a Portkey as soon as his Quidditch schedule had been announced. Harry had been happy for his friends until he realised what he was left to face alone. If the damn ball weren't for orphans, he would be home drinking beer with his bare feet up on the coffee table.
“Well he obviously didn’t meet the owner!” Kensa hissed. “I can’t believe that filth wasn’t thrown in Azkaban. The Ministry claim they cleaned up the Death Eaters, but at least one of them is still out there ruining your wedding!”
Kauko came from far away, his life saved by his mother and the bee. They are calling him back home. Aamu is sad to see him go, but she knows his legend continues in his own land. He must return to his mother without pride. He must see what life he can build with Mehiläinen.
Draco was cooperative during practice—he still had nightmares of falling on muddy fields in front of a crowd—but he acknowledged Potter only enough to bind their legs and trot awkwardly together. It was difficult to ignore Potter as they wrapped their arms around each other, but Draco spoke not a word and never met Potter's eyes.
“Um . . . well.  We could go into Sibiu.  I mean, they’ve got to have a nice restaurant in the wizarding section somewhere.  I’d be willing to try a Muggle place, but I suspect you’d prefer wizarding.”
The question seemed odd to Harry.  “I could Side-Along us.”  He said it more like a question than the statement it was meant to be.
kind of virgin. He hadn't so much as snogged since Ginny three years ago. He had no idea—other than his fingers in the shower—what he was supposed—
Draco shrugged. “I did in Greece, but I am not sure how many customs are the same.” He smiled with half his mouth. “It felt safer there because when I made mistakes they wrote me off as an odd foreigner. Here, I’m always worried I will break the Statute of Secrecy.”
They'd had to wait for morning to get an incriminating conversation between the assistant and the man who'd been in the house when they arrived, but then an hour of eavesdropping had provided enough information to assure them that they had their criminals and that they would find a brewing lab below the main house.  They had waited for back-up before executing a perfect raid.  Even the unexpected potioneer working in the lab had been Stunned and captured without any harm to the Aurors.
Draco was trying to decide what to feel about Potter's sudden departure.  Embarrassment?  Disappointment?  Anger?  A glance at Rosie showed no surprise.  “Does he do that often?”
Longbottom didn't tell him to fuck off, and he didn't draw his wand. Instead he smiled rather smugly. "Jealous?"
“Oh, get off,” Ron said.  “I can be nice at Christmas like everyone else.  And Easter, if it’ll get you to visit then as well.  You know, if he only sees me at holidays, he’ll think I’m all friendly and changed.”  Ron winked at him and strode back to the cauldron of steaming wine.
He glanced back to Hermione and saw her expectant, and exasperated, stare.  There was something he was supposed to be saying; he just didn’t know what it was.  She huffed and crossed her arms as she turned to her garden.  “The name is apt,” she stated primly with a lift to her nose.
He was right, but what could Draco do? He couldn't report this to the Aurors. Most of them felt Draco should have been sentenced for his part in the war. They'd probably wait around
Ron gave him a grateful smile. “Remember when Hermione and I went to Cornwall? The hotel with the chocolate cake?”
Malfoy turned back to the tree. “With all the damage from the battle, the usual plants aren’t all growing as they should. Everything is disrupted, and Hagrid and the others can’t fix it all at once. This is how I can help.”
Draco couldn’t think of a reply to that. He just sat and started at the large wood desk with the reservation book spread across it.
within him. Or have Malfoy within him. Or anything that joined them together completely. When Malfoy gasped out an invitation to his hotel room, Harry gratefully accepted.
Harry considered denying that, but he knew it was true. “Fine.” He wrapped his heavy cloak around his shoulders. “You can fly with me, but if we find the farm—”
“Yes, still here.”  He smiled with the fondness he felt for his feisty, beautiful bedmate.  And then he began to move.  He started slowly, still too afraid of causing pain, but soon built up speed.  One hand gripped at Draco's thigh whilst his other stroked his cock.  It wasn't easy to keep his hands and hips in time, but the concentration helped Harry delay his own orgasm.  He was determined that it be good for Draco and that he come first.
Draco appeared from thin air as he dropped to his knees beside Harry’s aching chest. Cool hands ran over Harry’s face and arms as if searching for further injury.
'I should get my things together,' Draco said as he stood. 'And have a snack. Padma refused to make it a dinner meeting. She doesn't even have a ring and she's worried about fitting into a dress.'
As soon as Harry was back in his room, he opened his bag and sifted through it. He’d brought a couple of jumpers just for warmth, and the green one was rather smart. He’d also brought some corduroys—again just for the warmth—that would look alright. He supposed he could wear the shoes he’d brought for the wedding. They weren’t called “morning shoes” afterall. They were called...he actually had no idea what they were called. He just knew the shop clerk had said they went with a morning suit, and a morning suit was what to wear to a morning wedding. Harry hadn’t asked further questions.
Draco stared down at him for a moment. 'Harry. She's been dating Laurence Boot for two years. They met through his younger brother, who was in Padma's year in Ravenclaw. Does any of this sound familiar?'
Draco didn’t smile. “If not her, then someone else. There is no shortage of people who feel the way she does.”
Remembering his own breeding, Draco chose a sheet of his finest parchment and wrote a simple but gracious reply.  He decided that he would rather have Potter on his own terms, so he invited Potter to his house that evening.
Harry Apparated them to a restaurant Charlie had recommended.  It was small and cosy, and Charlie swore the food was amazing.  They walked in to find a room with several small tables and a sign on a stand.  “Seat Yourself,” it read.  Harry shrugged and led Draco to the corner table in the window.  There was a sheer drape over the window that let in the moonlight and shadows but hid them from the view of the street.
Draco tried to look bored, but his shining eyes gave him away. “When I was young, I liked the Peruvian Vipertooth. I even tried to get Father to buy me one.” His voice faltered almost imperceptibly on the word ‘Father’, but Harry pretended not to notice. “They are fast and vicious, and as a child, I couldn’t imagine anything could matter more.”
Draco let his head shake in disbelief. Potter couldn’t see him. “Jowan Angove. The groom of the wedding you plan to attend. I will take your reply as evidence that you and he are not close.”
waste your chance?" Her voice was sickeningly sweet. "I'm so glad." She leaned forward to whisper in his ear. "I want all the details." With a flick of her wild hair, she was gone.
'Cold!' Harry protested. Draco huffed, but then there was so much heat around his cock that all thought left Harry's mind. He was in Draco's mouth and Draco's tongue was caressing him as his cheeks sucked and squeezed. Harry balled his hands into fists to resist the urge to grab at Draco's hair. When Draco started bopping his head and running his tight lips up and down his shaft, Harry was grateful he'd kept his hands to himself. The slice of his nails into his palms was well worth letting Draco feel things out on his own.
I didn’t have a mother." Then he leapt forward and swatted Teddy’s arm. "Your it!" He tore off into the mist with Teddy racing behind him. Draco and Harry were left standing in the growing silence.
Harry didn’t even have a chance to reply before Draco had disappeared back inside the Leaky. He considered following and demanding an explanation, but a little voice told him not to complain about getting what he wanted. If he wanted his life to make sense, he shouldn’t be pursuing Draco Malfoy.
They walked into the magically expanded sitting room and found George, Angelina, Ron and Hermione sitting on two facing couches next to a handsome Christmas tree.  It was not a large tree—despite Arthur’s promotions, the elder Weasleys were not extravagant with their gold—but it was a nicely shaped tree, rich green, and decorated with dozens of spinning and singing bulbs.  Red and white candles burned brightly on the branches, helping fill the room with soft, warm light.
Potter choked out a laugh that almost sounded like a sob. Then his face suddenly became very serious as he surged forward and pressed his lips to Draco's. Even with their lips closed, Draco could taste the bitter wine on Potter's breath. His lips weren't soft, but they were warm and insistent in that moment.
'Fuck!' Draco pulled back and Harry saw his own release dribbling down Draco's chin as he coughed and frowned. 'I think I'd hoped it might taste a bit sweeter.'
Weasley's arm brushed Draco's as he shrugged. "School," he said casually. "Buy you a drink, Malfoy?"
Malfoy came to stand beside him and handed him a full glass of red wine.  Harry took it and felt very awkward about holding the glass in one had and his wand in the other.  Suspecting that Malfoy wouldn't be foolish enough to try anything with Luna next door, he set his wand down on the sideboard.  Malfoy noticed and seemed to relax slightly.
The grass was cold and hard. Looking down, he saw that there was something between him and the grass. He was sitting on glass on top of the grass. A glass coffin.
“It's not unusual , Potter.  It's rare, extraordinary, and unique.  And I am not some trinket to be placed in a cupboard.”
Harry was enjoying himself so much that he was almost disappointed when Charlie announced he’d have a week off for his birthday just as Draco had.  Almost.  He did miss Hermione, Ron, and Teddy quite fiercely, even now that he had procured a mobile and found the nearest place to Bârlog with decent reception.
“Nothing important.”  She glanced at her desk with disinterest.  “It'll all get done in the end.  Oh!  I wanted to book my Portkey.”  She stood up and gathered her things.  “You’re welcome to take a look,” she said, gesturing dismissively at her desk.
Draco stepped forward and kissed him so hard that he staggered back into the wall. Held firmly in place by the hands on his hips, Harry relaxed into the slide of Draco's tongue against his own and the playful nips on his lips. Draco's body was warm and protecting against his and Harry felt safe.
Draco returned his smile.  Then he slowly, carefully eased himself from Harry's body.  He offered his hand and helped Harry stand on shaky legs.
“Here we are. No need for locks in these parts, but the dragon might be in so . . .” He banged his fist on the door. “Draco! Your flatmate’s here.”
the game. Draco had raged as Romania had knocked England out of the cup, and Harry had to assure the nearby Muggles that his friend always ranted about dragons when he'd had too much to drink. After that, Harry decided that Draco was better off experiencing Muggle culture from the safety of their own home.
But first Aamu has two visitors. She sees them in the distance, walking from Mielikki and Antero’s house.
Kauko comes that morning like usual, but he has another man with him. Aamu approaches the new man and studies his face. His hair is wild and dark like the boy in her vision, but he looks different with bright green eyes, open but shielded by glasses. She looks into his face and sees the strength and determination burning there. And the healing. In those lips is a gentleness that speaks of helping others.
Draco smirked as he rolled off Potter, stood, and began smoothing his robes. "I think that has something to do with night falling."
“Rough history?  I poisoned their son!  My father gave their only daughter a cursed diary which almost—wait, boyfriend?”
One moment he was listening in rapt attention as some gasbag told a tale. The next, he was flirting with a young woman with buck-teeth and bushy hair who looked like an alternative-universe version of Hermione.  A moment later he was telling a story that had even the grumpiest member of the Wizengamot laughing and wiping his eyes.
Their Ravenclaw—the clever Patil sister—was the one to notice Abbott had turned purple. Not all over, just around her eyes like a purple raccoon. Draco recognised the famous markings of Death’s Mask, but no one had come down with it in Britain for centuries. What primitive nation had Abbott visited with her family that she had contracted an illness from the Mediaeval period?
Harry tried to keep his voice casual as he agreed and gave his Floo address. By the time he offered to make dinner, he accepted that he had completely failed at playing it cool.
"And does alcohol still lead to snogging blokes at parties?" Draco arched a brow but made sure to keep his lips curved in a smile. He hoped he looked playful and relaxed despite his heart pounding in his chest as he waited for Potter's answer.
He could have admitted to his own lack of experience, but he wanted Potter to feel he was in good hands. "Don't worry. I'll take care of you." To prove his claim, he gently removed Potter’s glasses, folded the arms, and set them on the nightstand.
After Draco left, Ron and Harry sat staring between the report and each other for some time.  It was Ron who finally found his voice.
"I want the details. The damage is done, so you might as well fill me in." He knew he'd won the moment she bit her lip. She
Draco bit his lip to stop himself from making more than a hiss and blinked past the wetness that gathered in his eyes. It was a far cry from the Cruciatus Curse, but the Hex still
"I guess we should take it easy tonight," Potter said. "Big day tomorrow and all." He looked regretful until a little smirk pulled on the side of his mouth. "Unless you'd like to come home with me." His mouth was sly, but his eyes looked pleading.
Draco briefly imagined Potter being brought back to McGonagall’s bedroom and grimaced. At least it was more evidence that Rita Skeeter’s bullshit about Potter and Dumbledore having an affair was total rot. Not that Draco had believed it. Potter had all but walked around Hogwarts with a badge on his chest flashing “fumbling virgin.” At least until the Weasley girl took him up. Draco found himself scowling again, and realised Potter was watching him nervously.
It was good to be Harry Potter's lover.  It was surely because of Harry that the Minister had named him Substances Liaison, put him in charge of advising other departments about potions and other regulated substances, and had even given him his own office.  Now when the Aurors needed him, they came straight to his office.  And he found Harry needed him constantly.  Luckily, having his own office allowed them to shut the door and throw up a silencing spell.  His large mahogany desk had proved to be a very practical piece of furniture.
“Auror Potter.  What brings you to Substances?” Sothman asked in the sycophantic tone he saved for those who might prove a powerful ally or threat.
“Bottling is clearly uniform, but the production and distribution may not be. We don’t know whether this is one group from growing the herbs to selling the potions or if many different organizations are involved. As such, I want each of you to take a part of the process but remain in constant communication. It is—”
It didn't help that Pansy and Blaise had finally stopped dancing around each other and were now trying to make up for lost time.  He glared to his side where Pansy was now straddling Blaise in her attempts to suck his soul out through his mouth.
Draco nodded. "I do. And I want you to get her to let me help. I want her to pass her legislation without polarizing politics around blood status. It's in my interest for people to move on."
Draco felt his defenses go up. He hadn’t expected Potter to be so observant, which was a mistake given the man was an Auror. “Oh?”
Draco looked around the village tavern Potter had taken him to.  Yes, village.  Apparently even Muggle London was too risky when one's date bore the scar of the Dark Mark.  Nothing about the décor or location made the place memorable, although the large fireplace in the front room at least provided warmth and light.  A round-faced woman with black hair pulled into a messy ponytail greeted Potter by name and asked about Draco.  It seemed that he brought dates here often, and Draco wasn't sure if that made him feel better or worse.  It would explain why the Daily Prophet hadn't covered any of Potter's relationships since he'd left Auror Training.
Harry ducked branches and jumped roots, impressed at how well Draco stayed with him. Draco’s natural grace was almost a match for Harry’s hard training. Finally they stopped against a tree, and he heard Draco’s panting beside him. He desperately wanted to see him, but he knew the Disillusionment Charm was still important protection.
Draco flopped back in his chair. Why did he bother? "Yes. I have a date." He sat up and raised a hand as if it could protect him. "And no, I don’t want to talk about it."
Dinner was surprisingly normal.  Despite it being their first date, they spoke with the same casual ease they had developed after months as flatmates and friends.  The only difference was that Harry could take and stroke Draco’s hand as he pleased.  And he didn’t have to hide the wonder with which he watched Draco make love to his cheesecake.  The noises alone had Harry hard under the table.
But Draco had handled the public scorn admirably, and admire Harry did. After months of abuse, Draco had given a public statement expressing his remorse for his actions and his understanding that people resented seeing him walk free. He volunteered for a five year exile, one of the punishments the Ministry had handed out to low-level supporters who were not seen as actively dangerous. Some complained that Paris was too cushy for an exile, but others were appeased. Almost everyone seemed to forget Draco existed as soon as he ceased to walk among them. But not Harry, who was still reminded of his classmate by everything from a Snitch to a package of Ice Mice.
“That’s all you’re getting until you buy me dinner.” Draco took a step away and adjusted his cloak. “You only got that because I am counting lunch as a first date.”
When Potter came out of the shower, he would know. Draco had used charms to hide the sound of his coughing all night, but Potter would notice even silent coughing now that he was awake. Draco crawled back into bed and let his aching joints relax against the soft mattress. He wasn’t sure why he was hiding his illness from Potter, but he knew it would be a very long day.
Harry had to smile. “I am abysmal at Potions. In Herbology, I am only mediocre.” He let his smile twist into a smirk. “But if I were brilliant at Herbology, the Aurors wouldn’t need to hire an external expert, now would they?”
Harry fell in step beside Malfoy, ignoring the thumping in his chest as they moved so close together. They walked in silence, but it was easy and light, allowing Harry to hear the occasional chirp and skitter of the more mundane woodland creatures that inhabited the outskirts of the forest.  He did hope that they wouldn’t be going too far in. There were other creatures he hoped never to meet again.
He was very glad for the semblance of protection the additional clothing offered when he recognised Gabby Yarn of the
Malfoy paused for only an instant before he pressed back eagerly. Soon they were grabbing at each other, pulling each other closer and closer as their mouths met again and again. The smell of lilacs was gone, replaced by the overwhelming awareness of Malfoy. Harry could taste Malfoy's breath, the very air within him, and it left him craving more. He wanted to
Dinner with Potter had been astonishingly easy. They'd discussed Ministry politics and Quidditch over dinner and then drinks, and Draco had been surprised to realise the pub was near closing as they'd gathered their cloaks to leave.
Draco took the hint. He all but sprinted from the house and made his way through the crowd in the back garden to the quiet side yard. Crouched beside a tomato plant with a glass of wine held precariously in long fingers was Harry Potter. Alone. His free hand was fondling a tomato with the same care and concentration Draco would expect from Pansy or Longbottom.
to hurt Potter, even if he couldn't deny the thrill his new-found power gave him.  His mother had once said something about knowing which powers to use and which to hold, and he wished he'd paid more attention.
Draco had felt so relaxed and safe and happy as he lay tangled in Potter’s limbs. He may have fallen asleep.
Harry shook his head. The ridiculous ideas Draco got. It was enough to make Harry believe some of Luna's strange theories about flying creatures that messed with people's heads.
“Good,” Harry gave a fierce grin.  “If you have the energy to fuck, you have enough energy to talk.”
He pulled his fingers out of his arse and grabbed the dildo.  He lined it up with his entrance and then roughly shoved it inside.  “Move,” he ordered.  The dildo began to move.  “Deeper.”  He squeezed his eyes shut as he played with his own nipples, pretending it was Draco’s long, strong fingers twisting and squeezing at his sensitive flesh.
“I hope Harry hasn't gone off my pies.”  Rosie was standing by the table with a wry smile.  “Well, if your date's run off on you, why don't you come up and finish your meal at the bar?  It's a slow night and you can provide some company.”  Without waiting for a reply, she picked up his plate and carried it through to the other room.  Draco followed, drink in hand.
The Aurors saw fewer people trying to deal out their own justice after that, and they had even gotten two decent recruits out of the dozens of
“This,” Toby pointed to his own jumper, “is fitted cashmere. And these,” he grabbed the back of his jeans, “make my arse look amazing. You look like a small child wearing his Nan’s Christmas gift and hand-me-down jeans.” He looked Harry over and then raised both eyebrows to assure Harry that his words were established fact not worth debating. Harry kept his mouth shut and Toby went on.
Well, probably Granger and a bunch of Weasleys did. And Longbottom, obviously. But the general public operated under the belief that the Boy Who Could Have Anyone had surely had
Hermione had made her peace with Draco when they'd both returned to Hogwarts after the war, Neville was too forgiving to hold a grudge, and Ron couldn't hate someone who was doing such great things for his career.  In fact, Ron had suggested that Draco be available to the Aurors as a permanent advisor, and Kingsley had gone ahead and made up a new position just for Draco.
Draco Malfoy stepped out into the summer evening light and ran his eyes over every inch of Harry's exposed flesh.  Harry felt indignant.  Luna said that the people she lived with didn't do that!  But this was
Really, when had Potter’s shoulders started looking like that? And Draco would never have known what was hidden under the tents Potter called shirts if not for them being locked up together.
Draco set down his quill at the unexpected comment. He looked up and saw Potter hovering by the door to the division as if unsure of his welcome. When Draco met his eyes, Potter strode forward and lowered his voice as if worried about privacy.
Draco didn't trust himself to speak as his nerves about racing mixed with his anticipation of where things with Potter might lead. He nodded instead, and wrapped his arm around Potter's shoulders.
Now that he was there, with Weasley and Potter looking at him expectantly, it didn't seem so easy.  What did he say?   I came to tell you that you can shag me?  That would work on Blaise, but he sensed it wasn't the right approach for Potter.  Potter needed something more . . . friendly and . . . nice.
"No. I was, but Astoria filed for divorce as soon as Scorpius was born. Making sure that he would be considered a legitimate heir was the only reason we were married in the first place." He didn't like to discuss the contract by which he paid the Greengrass family debts in return for a Malfoy heir. It all sounded so mercenary and didn't reflect the love and respect he and Astoria had for each other and for Scorpius.
article and saw the tone was as savage as Gabby’s from a few years back, but far less likely to create any Malfoy sympathy. This article was written by Rita Skeeter and she was in her element, stretching any little fact to an outrageous conclusion. The mere mention that the hotel grounds homed pigs was followed by a list of Dark rituals requiring pigs' blood. There wasn’t a shred of evidence of any wrongdoing, but every sentence dripped with accusations. He looked up at Ron.
There were so many answers to that question, but Harry decided to start small. "Dinner would be nice. I’m a pretty good cook."
you so pale still? I mean at Hogwarts, yeah, I get it. Scotland and all. But Greece? Working with plants must have gotten you outside.”
Harry forced himself to process Draco’s words instead of fantasising about his footwear. The plant for the Potion. It couldn’t grow near electricity.
For the rest of the evening and the next morning, Draco was never alone. Ron slept in his old bed. Hermione came over first thing in the morning when the others left for work. When she left for a morning meeting, Harry arrived with a stack of parchment that he spread across the kitchen table. Harry stared at his work, and yet Draco could not shake the feeling that Harry was watching him. It was ridiculous, but Draco couldn't deny that he was a little bit touched by everyone's concern. He must bake better than he'd ever realised.
Potter was drunk.  It was obvious in the flush of his cheeks, the glaze of his eyes, and the sway of his posture.  If Draco took a step backwards, Potter would surely slide off his stool to the floor.  While part of Draco told him that a compliant Potter was good for his plan, he couldn't help but feel disappointed.
Harry turned to glare at Flintridge. 'I didn't need one. Their food is well worth the gold I paid.' He looked back at Draco, grateful to find Draco still watching him. He looked deep into Draco's eyes, willing him to understand what Harry had only just realised. 'You are worth it.'
It was the photograph dominating page 15 that made his breath draw short. It was of a group of wizards and witches gathered in a garden bursting with blooms. Front and centre stood Draco with his arm around a pretty, young woman. In the woman’s arms was a small boy with hair as pale as Draco’s. Despite the baby-fat softening the child's features, the resemblance to Draco was striking.
Potter's kisses and rubs slowed along with his breathing until Draco realised he'd fallen asleep.  He carefully extricated himself from the tangle of limbs, removed Potter's shoes, and tucked the man into bed.  Lying fast asleep, Potter looked peaceful and surprisingly sweet.  Draco had never seen him look so young and vulnerable.
“I agree,” said Hermione.  “Not with the ferret part, obviously.” She shot her husband a little frown which he failed to notice as he helped himself to the biscuit plate again. “But his mother and he didn’t lose their assets in the War Trials, so I imagine he’s still quite well-off despite all his father lost.”
Harry laughed. Yesterday his clothing had made him feel ugly and alone, and today these clothes had gotten him much more than Malfoy’s attention. “Yes. Very much. I can’t wait to see what else you have.”
Harry leaned over to whisper in his ear.  “If you win this for us, I’ll give you a blow job in the shower back in our room.”  They were staying at a hotel, rather than crowd into the Burrow or face Malfoy Manor.  The wizarding hotel was lovely and decadent and had an enormous shower in addition to a huge bathtub.  It was amazing that they’d left the room at all.  “But if I get more questions right . . .”
So far, she assigned every case to Caldwell and Brighton—two ancient wizards who knew everything about substance legislation and absolutely nothing about the brewing and distribution of illegal substances.  It was no surprise to Draco that potion-abuse was becoming a serious problem in Britain.
Draco could hear his mother’s voice and smiled at her growing bravery. She still avoided crowds and strangers, but she now frequented much more of the manor in the cooler months when the hotel wasn’t bustling with strangers. On quiet mornings, she would even brave the rose garden or walk up to the sea.
"Well, he was receptive to Macmillan, yes? So that provides some insight into his taste. Macmillan and I are the same sex, age, and blood status, and we both—"
"Shall we practice?" Potter's voice was friendly, a tone Draco had heard often when Potter spoke to others. Draco nodded and stayed very still as Potter bound their legs.
Harry pulled his mind back to the present where he and Malfoy were still walking under a starry sky with the cool air heavy with the smells of the blossoms around them. In fact, there were
With a flick of his wand, Draco sent Potter’s bag up to his room. The sooner Draco was free of Potter, the sooner he could go hide in his kitchen where everything made sense.
Harry’s own concerns centred around how his friends would react to him dating someone who had tormented them so much at school. Ron and Hermione seemed accepting, but Harry still found himself nervous as their anniversary trip to Hotel Kalmynsi approached. He was spending more and more time at the hotel with Draco, sleeping there as often as at home, so Ron and Hermione planned to have him and Draco join them for meals during their holiday.
He crept to the greenhouse, torn between going inside to search for Draco and standing guard at the door. Best to stand in the doorway and let Draco find him than risk fumbling about and missing him. It would take more patience than he usually had, but it was the plan that kept Draco safest.
“What?  You mean since she was held prisoner in my basement?  No.  I’m afraid we don’t exchange Christmas cards.”
“Yeah, well . . . He's not the first and he won't be the last.”  Draco really didn't want to talk about all of the hands that felt entitled to grab at him.
Draco felt his stomach tighten as the middle-aged man with slicked-back hair, a sharp nose, and a paunch that stretched his robes awkwardly stepped up to Clearwater's side.  The man scanned the group with a smug smile that turned lecherous when his eyes settled on Draco.
Draco had decided to finish his usual assignments that afternoon and not start reviewing the Auror case until after hours.  No one else stayed a minute past five in Substances, so he knew he'd have the area to himself.  He didn't want Caldwell or Brighton to discover that he'd stolen their assignment and complain to Clearwater.  While Clearwater would never admit she hadn't made the assignment herself—it might bring to light that she let Draco do her work without so much as a review—she might “change her mind,” and assign one of the old wizards instead.
Harry looked at the two figures reflected in the glass. Malfoy stood with straight shoulders and spine in a jumper that hugged his body despite the collared shirt beneath. His trousers draped neatly down his long legs before creasing once above his shiny leather shoes.
He pulled the Protean-Charmed Galleon out of his pocket and flung it down in front of him on the table.  Hermione had improved the coins since fifth year, and the coins now allowed letters as well as numbers and also allowed communication to go both ways.
'Oh, shit! Sorry. Sorry.' Draco sounded breathless and half-mad, but sincere. 'Just felt so good.' He stumbled to the wall and leant against it. 'Here. You can press my hips back.'
"I’m so sorry, Draco. I should have asked. I should have…" Harry couldn’t find the words to make it right, and Draco just looked sad. He should be furious with Harry, but he looked like he felt he deserved such treatment. "Be angry," Harry pleaded. "I was horrible. I assumed the worst of you. Please, scream or Hex me or something."
Harry suddenly remembered Draco's signs of trouble from earlier in the day. This must be what had Draco going suddenly serious and upset! But how had Harry not noticed Draco's relationship? They lived together. They spend most of their time together.
Potter emerged from his shower and made a lot of noise in the bedroom. Dressing was likely a challenge for him given the awful results he usually displayed. Sure enough, Potter emerged minutes later in clothing intended for someone at least twice Potter's width. Surely shops would provide Potter with a tailored wardrobe for free. Why was he still wearing the same rags he'd always worn?
“Are you asking if I intend to involve myself with other men whilst on holiday?”  Harry nodded, hating how articulate Draco sounded in contrast to his own ramblings.  “No, that is not my intention.  And you?  Will you fill your bed in my absence?”
put her in danger. Claudius was probably trying to get the Malfoy estate, and luckily the Malfoy coffers passed only by blood.
Draco suddenly understood why he'd never met his uncle. "Oh, ew. That's just disgusting. Offing someone for their inheritance is one thing, but carving the corpse for body parts—what's he even going to
A series of pops sounded and then Ron, Fernsworth, and two other Aurors were in front of him. He quickly briefed them and then turned back to the farm. He felt movement beside him and pressed Draco’s invisible body back against the tree. His hand over Draco’s chest, he could feel his heart beating below the lean muscle.
“I spoke to Merryn, and she doesn’t mind that you know,” Draco began. “In fact...she thinks I’m being overprotective.”
Then Potter looked up and those green eyes contrasted sharply with the purple bruise-colored skin around them. He wouldn’t ask for help—Draco could read it in the stubborn lines of his face—but he needed it. Potter’s hand on the book he’d been reading shook. His mouth was gaping as he took in ragged breaths and tried to stand from the sofa. He made it halfway up before his legs gave out and he collapsed back to the sofa. He sat there with his eyes pressed closed and determination cut into his face.
As he ate, Draco wondered if he had to say something. He had brushed off conversation after Potter’s illness, but now Draco was the one in debt. Yes, he had tended to Potter first, but Potter had thanked him. Now Potter probably expected the same.
She brought him a bowl of soup, a couple rolls of bread, and some sausages. “Eat. The mountains are too dangerous to fly when you are like this.” Harry blinked at her and she pushed the tray of food closer. “You are heading to the reserve, yes?” He nodded as he picked up his spoon and tried the soup. It was quite sour, but tasty. “It will take you three hours to reach the village where the zmeiwizards live.”
your type: dark hair, bright eyes, and slender." She dumped a messy file on Draco's desk and gave him a contemptuous look. "You were just assigned a wet dream, but you're going to waste your chance by being a total berk."
Harry placed a comforting hand on Ron's shoulder and gestured with his chin to where Hermione had been drawn into conversation with the newest member of the Wizengamot. "Hermione looks radiant tonight." It was true. Her bronze robes were understated but flattering as they clung to her curves. "People will look at her. They will appreciate her looks and her intellect." As if on cue, the Wizengamot member leant closer and spoke with more passion. Ron tensed, but stayed by Harry's side. "Do you trust her?"
Potter's hands were cupping his face and sliding into his hair.  He was kissing every part of Draco's face, returning again and again to his lips.  The kisses began to move down his jaw and neck as Potter's hands moved from his hair to his waist and then slipped under his jumper.
He wiped his mouth and cheek with the back of his arm and then climbed up Draco's body until their foreheads touched.  “Like this?  Or do you want to ride me?”  Draco looked a bit panicked, so Harry answered his own question.  “Let's do it like this.”  He lifted Draco's hips and slid a thick pillow underneath.  Then he pressed Draco's knees up to his chest.  “Comfortable?”  Draco nodded.
Draco thought the questions was a simple matter of time management, but Potter's face shuttered as his eyes fell to his glass. His shoulders tightened and he swirled his wine almost aggressively. "I suspect I'll have to choose one." He tensed as if anticipating an assault.
Draco didn't care. He wasn't interested in the food other than to know what it said about Potter's interest in him. He had expected something like a simple pasta and was pleased to see Potter had planned such an elaborate meal. "Do you usually make a beef roast on the weekend?"
Harry finally turned around once he had an offering in his hands.  Draco took a large gulp of tea, with no regard for it’s scalding temperature or his own manners.  His eyes fluttered slightly as he drank, similar to the way they did when he climaxed.  Harry blushed at his own thoughts and turned back to the hob full of simmering pans.
“Yes, I’m an idiot. I know.” Potter’s self-deprecation suited him. Much better than his arrogance from school. “I was already planning to check out your hotel—as a guest! Not check out like an Auror. God, I can hear your suspicion from here. I need a holiday, and this was a good excuse, okay? You get good press, and my friends get to stop fussing over me and driving me mad, and this random bride gets to keep the wedding she originally wanted.”
Harry hated seeing Draco look disappointed. He was so enticing when he was smug. “Well, you said it can’t be near magic without destroying it. Since no one has reported charms suddenly failing in certain areas...”
Harry felt his thoughts rushing around. How had he missed all that? Maybe he'd been told but had ignored it on purpose. He didn't want Padma to marry Terry Boot's older brother; she was supposed to marry Draco! Eventually. Then Harry would marry Parvati and they could all live together. It would be perfect.
Draco sighed dramatically. “Do you think they literally sit around and watch the grass grow? It's Friday evening. They are probably at home, sprucing up for a night of shady deals and fumbled sex.”
His eyes immediately landed on Draco, who was laughing with Blaise as they stood against the wall. Draco was facing Blaise and appeared completely engaged in their conversation, but Harry saw the little tug on his sleeve which spoke of nerves or distraction. Was Draco worrying about what Parkinson had said to him about Harry? And how had Harry come to know Draco well enough to read his body language without ever noticing his feelings for Harry?
What should he do? Flee to the bedroom and lock himself in? Surely Potter could take his own potions to clear his sinuses and lungs. And if he couldn’t, Kreacher would help him. He didn’t need Draco, and Draco didn’t need his illness.
The barkeep—Tom, he suddenly remembered—started to pour his Firewhisky and then swore when the bottle ran out.  He muttered something and then disappeared to a back-room.   Of course.  Because even getting a drink in a pub has to be as hard as possible.
“So it is.” Draco wasn’t particularly hungry, but the berries were plump and sweet. He managed to eat a respectable amount.
Harry looked up from the grey shirt and met matching eyes set above an amused and smug grin.  He closed his eyes and rested his face against the soft fabric, barely resisting his body's exhaustion and the desire to fall into a comfortable doze right there.
Harry tried to ignore the warm, fuzzy feeling that came from Draco praising Harry’s idea. “How do we do that when it’s illegal to grow it?”
Neville threw his head back and laughed with full amusement. If Neville hadn’t been wrapped in a travelling cloak, Harry probably would have seen his stomach shaking with the force of it. Instead Harry waited in bemusement as Neville wiped his eyes and slowly composed himself.
Draco, romancing him, through—what? A group date? Looking around at the floating candles, flowers, and garlands, he realised the setting he'd created was more appropriate for a candle-lit dinner for two than a birthday party with work colleagues and school friends.
She shrugged. "Yep. Same as last time. Why cook it from scratch when it's right there on the shelf just waiting to go in the oven?" No matter how many times she tried to explain it to Ron, he still viewed pre-prepared food with the same awe as Harry had for Hogwarts.
But saying he wanted to be Draco’s friend felt disingenuous. Harry wasn’t usually so curious about every element of his friend’s interests and lives. He didn’t stare into their eyes or wonder what their hair felt like. He certainly didn’t blush when he touched their hands. Nope. He had managed to start fancying Draco.
Malfoy moaned and began swearing. He went through the usual curses as Harry bobbed his head on Malfoy’s cock and then moved on to ones that Harry didn’t know. Was ‘son of a cum-sucking hag’ even a real expression? Harry wasn’t in a position to ask.
“Just walking you to your desk.”  Harry was looking further down the hall and there was a determined set to his jaw.  They made a turn and Draco's desk came into view.  Sothman was standing right next to it.  Sothman glanced briefly at Draco before he locked his eyes on Harry as they approached.  Harry stared right back.
He spread the robes on the bed and tapped the iron, which looked like a polished stone triangle, with his wand.  The iron immediately began steaming and radiating heat as it danced around his robes.  Once his robes were perfectly smooth, it sat itself upright like a Crup sitting on its hind legs awaiting a treat.
Ron looked from the pie to his wife and back again. His soppy expression stayed the same. "I don't know how she does it. It's as good as my mum's and she barely spends a moment in the kitchen."
complex and Pansy was far sharper than she let on. Draco was unsure why she was failing to comprehend. "I already told you about Phase Six."
"So what d'ya say, Malfoy? Can we get along long enough not to embarrass ourselves in front of the entire Ministry?"
The woman leans over him and he transforms into a bee. She watches him fly off to the sky carrying the weight of all her hopes. Then she looks down at her son’s body, which is once again before her. Aamu sees the tightness of her shoulders as she waits for the bee. She does not move, trying her best to hide her misery. Then her head jerks up.
A quick glance around showed Ministry officials and members of the Wizengamot drinking ale and chatting with an ease rarely seen inside the Ministry. Perhaps it was time for Draco to form some new alliances.
He did, however, draw the line at Sunday lunch at the Weasley hovel—um, house.  One Weasley might be tolerable over good food and Auror talk.  A dozen Weasleys, including little Weasleys, was too much.  So it was that Draco had created a standing lunch date with Pansy for Sunday lunch.  They would try new restaurants or visit Theo or Greg, and he would remember what it was like to spend time with people not intent on saving the world.  When he would get home on Sunday nights, he would find Harry reading Quidditch magazines on his couch in nothing but a t-shirt and his underwear.
When he opened his eyes, he found Potter's arm still wrapped around his waist and Potter’s leg woven between his own. Potter's breath was deep and even, and a small smile rested on his lips. Draco kissed his cheek, and sleepy green eyes opened to look at him.
Was it curiosity, or something more? Draco knew he should leave his prodding for now, but he couldn’t resist. Not when he had Potter’s full attention like that. “Wouldn’t you say the same?”
Remembering his illness explained the time of day and the feeling of his body, but he was struggling to wrap his mind around the third oddity. Cracking one eye open, he saw Potter stretched out beside him, sound asleep.
to be a champion and I didn't ask to be Head Auror!" He kicked a tuft of grass and sending dry dirt flying. As usual, he was painting himself the victim as if he had no say in his own life.
Arthur walked in and smacked the burly one upside the head with an ease that spoke of years of practice. "Charlie, leave Draco alone. He doesn't need you trying to seduce him when he has a murderous uncle to worry about."
Harry felt ridiculous standing in front of Malfoy in his boxers and socks. It wasn’t that he was usually prudish—if Hogwarts hadn’t acclimated him to dressing in front of others, the Aurors certainly would have—but it was the abrupt and unexpected nature of the situation that had his cheeks heating. That, and his fellow Gryffindors and Aurors didn’t look like Malfoy.
"He's in custody at the Ministry." Harry's glared at a distant hill as he spoke. "His Polyjuice ran out as he was poisoning you, and I came back into the kitchen just as he changed." Draco remembered the image of George with white hair. "The apple alone is enough evidence to send him away for life, and no one has stepped forward in his defence. His trial will be little more than a formality."
'I had help, but the catering and champagne was all me.' Harry wasn't usually one to demand credit, but it suddenly seemed very important for Draco to know how much he had done. He had spent weeks racking his brain over each detail and giving up every lunch break to shop or plan for the party.
tactful. "Yes, yes. I nearly killed his best friend and supported the Dark wizard who killed his parents. I know." He waved his hand impatiently at her as if he could brush the past away. "But that was ages ago." Okay,
The exile had been for five years, but for seven years Draco had not been seen on British soil. Until tonight.
Draco made his way to the bar, dodging a group of drunk and rowdy wizards on his way.  It was busier at the Hufflepuff's end of the bar, so Draco headed to the end tended by the toothless old codger who owned the place.  He asked for water for Potter and then ordered a double Firewhisky for himself.  He suspected he'd need it to babysit the soused Saviour.
Malfoy stood as still as one of his precious squirrels, his eyes darting around Harry’s face as he assessed the possible threat. His breath came out in a puff of steam, but he did not pull away from Harry’s touch. Harry was charmed by the intensity in his eyes, both inviting Harry to continue and threatening the consequences of a wrong move. Did Harry dare take that risk?
Harry’s mind was more than happy to continue the thought. Malfoy used charms on his trousers so his cock could hang free. Or get stiff. And no one would ever know. What was Malfoy’s cock doing at that moment? Hanging free? Filling up? He realised he was still staring at Malfoy’s crotch and pulled his eyes up to find grey ones full of mirth.
"Great! I'll see you both next week. Come by on Monday." She turned to walk back to her house without waiting for their consent.
The evening continued well. Conversation came easily, only interrupted as Draco explained each course and Potter made noises of pleasure that made Draco feel equal parts pleased and awkward. But it was all going smoothly, which is why Draco should have known something was about to go wrong.
’s up and coming reporter, wrote a scathing article about vigilante magic and vilified the attacker for taking justice and public safety into his own hands. Photographs of an injured child were published alongside that of a Ministry employee who had been next to Lucius at the time and only barely kept his arm. The next day Gabby had run an interview with Head Auror Robards in which he said that Lucius had been their key witness in upcoming trials and suspected murderers might now walk free because “some idiot would rather blow up the Ministry than do any actual good.” He’d gone on to say that if any reader wanted to fight crime in a helpful way they should apply to the Aurors and get properly trained.
What caught Harry's attention was that Flintridge was standing too close for a casual business colleague. Far worse: Draco was letting him.
Occasionally Potter shouted out in terror or anger. Other times, he clutched Draco’s leg and sobbed against his thigh. It was very awkward, but Draco took comfort that Potter was simply fevered and unlikely to remember anything. He helped Potter take a Chill Out Potion, but the fever persisted, and Potter burned and sweated through the night.
That’s right. Potter grew up with Muggles. And he grew up surrounded by bright-eyed idealists who saw only how the world could be and not how it actually was. Granger would probably campaign for Squib rights if Potter asked, but Draco knew it would take decades to bring any significant change and he didn’t want Merryn living her life with people making her feel unwelcome in her own world. Because even if Merryn couldn’t cast a single spell, this was still her world. Draco knew how it felt to be a pariah. He’d be damned if Merryn ever found out.
Ron gave a reluctant nod. “It’s true. Now that I need a new partner—” He shot a glare at Harry that lacked any real malice. “I’m not looking for the
But Harry working with Draco would be impossible. He no longer held any animosity toward Draco, but that had created a greater problem. Apparently the animosity was the only thing keeping Harry from noticing just how attractive Draco was. There was just something so compelling about that smug mouth and the way he lifted his eyebrows in silent question. And the less said about those long slender fingers, the better. Thank God he was wearing that figure-hiding robe. Harry wouldn’t function otherwise.
Draco barked out a laugh, his whole face radiant and relaxed before his brows drew close again. “Wait, Weasley called me ‘Draco’?”
to and appear anti-Muggle; his reputation had improved slightly over the past few years, but he was still largely disliked and distrusted. So he had dutifully volunteered, imagining he'd be forced to man a table of whatever smelly and distasteful things Muggles eat when they have these
Harry checked on the kitchen yet again. The caterers were clearing the remains of the buffet before they began to serve dessert, seemingly oblivious to the host and the guest of honour having a life-changing moment. Good. He knew Draco would be pleased with the pastries and cakes he'd chosen, and it seemed more important that ever to have earned brownie points.
Luna smiled serenely. "Such a lovely name." She turned to Draco. "Promise you'll come play it with me?"
From there the night settled into banter and conversation. There was plenty of ribbing and insults, but each was soothed with further drink and smug smiles. By the time Tom called last orders, Draco could admit that he was enjoying himself. His former enemies were surprisingly good company.
A hand ran along Draco's cheek and down his neck. Bright green eyes watched him carefully and Potter kissed him on the lips. "I think you are," he whispered.
Harry hoped Charlie would continue with whatever he’d been saying, but the wizard just picked up his cup, steaming heavily in the cool spring air, and took a long, slow drink. The twitch of a smile on Charlie’s lips told Harry that he was enjoying his captive audience.
So it was that he found himself minutes later strolling through a rose garden as Draco rattled off technical names for the various flowers. Harry wasn’t listening to the Latin words, but rather to the way each sound was formed by Draco’s mouth: clear and crisp as the sea air blowing up and across the hotel’s grounds.
So he did.  He breathed deeply and let every muscle go.  He felt the heat and the pain, but he embraced it.  It made him feel real.  Alive.
Draco wasn’t sure he could call Potter that, but the soggy wizard and his bag were a more pressing matter. “May I?” He held his wand aloft. Whether Potter understood what he was offering, Draco didn’t know or care. Potter nodded and Draco shot off several Drying Charms. Yes, the thousand-year-old Persian rug had protective charms on it, but that was no reason to drip all over it.
“Leah! You have to!” The woman from the West Country, Kensa, sounded afraid. “The hotel is run by a Death Eater! I know you aren’t from here, but surely word of the Death Eaters made it to the States. I can’t believe Jowan hasn’t brought this up himself. I don’t know what my brother thinks of sometimes.”
Malfoy’s voice was soft. “I still don’t go in deep.” He shuddered, and Harry wondered what image had crossed his mind. Voldemort drinking unicorn blood? Maybe the Acromantula that had attacked the castle with the Death Eaters the year before? “But the edges are home to different types of birds and squirrels.”
“So it is.”  Harry looked happier and perhaps a bit smug as he turned to Draco.  “Have lunch with me?”  Draco wasn't sure whether Harry meant an actual meal or Apparating home for a quick shag.  Either sounded good, so he nodded.  “Excellent.  See you then.”  And then he leant forward and kissed Draco square on the lips in the middle of Substances and in front of Draco's boss.  Draco could already hear the murmur of gossip spreading in the distance.
Harry shrugged.  “I’m pretty good at Apparition”  He was pleased to see the impressed glint in Draco’s eye.
“Thuban, this is Potter. Potter, Thuban.” Harry felt like he should laugh at the formal introductions, but he remembered the lesson Draco had apparently learned well in third-year with Buckbeak. Thinking of the hippogriff, Harry bowed deeply to the dragon. The dragon lifted his head from the ground and regarded him with rainbow-coloured eyes that unnerved Harry with their lack of pupil and thus obvious focus. Finally the dragon gave a tiny nod and then ignored Harry to look back at Draco.
Malfoy turned heel and walked out of the room. “We leave for dinner in twenty minutes, Potter,” came drifting down the hall before there was the click of a door closing.
He found the red-draped table he had been assigned and looked for his own name on the ornately inscribed cards set behind each golden plate. He was sat between one of the more tolerable Ministry bureaucrats and a woman who spoke almost exclusively about her cats, but he ignored almost everything either said. He listened just enough to know when to nod or make a sound of disapproval and gave the rest of his mind over to watching Malfoy at the next table.
'Beautiful.' Draco kissed him just above his heart, and the intimacy of the gesture made Harry's cheeks flush. Draco continued kissing a path down his chest, and each soft, wet kiss making his hair stand up on end. Soon Draco was on his knees with his face pressed against Harry's clothed cock. The devilish grin he flashed was enough to ensure Harry was completely hard by the time Draco had his trousers and pants around his ankles.
A dark eyebrow rose. “Are you aware the Hotel Kalmynsi hotel is owned and managed by a Death Eater?”
How was he meant to read this bloody thing? Right. Notes from murder cases. History of the Bloodrot Potion. A mess of information about the various ingredients involved including the Ministry classification. Harry knew it would be important to sort which ingredients were legal and not, but he could barely keep his eyes on the page. He was beginning to feel rather peckish as well, but he didn’t want to be the first to stop working. Finally Draco set his file down and held up a sheet of parchment with a three column grid.
Draco tried not to bristle, but he couldn't help but anticipate some insult to Pansy. He kept his tone neutral as he waited to hear if Potter had a point to make. "Them getting together or the fact that they've stayed together so long?"
"I didn't know you were into Herbology." Draco hadn't meant to speak yet, but he was pleased he had managed a casual conversation starter.
Angelina smiled at them as they sat next to her on a soft couch.  “They’ve been tested, and they all have antidotes.”
Harry bit back a groan. All of those people were downstairs, and surely they had noticed Harry and Draco's absence. Given the public kissing earlier, it wouldn't be hard for them to determine the cause of the absence. His face burned with embarrassment even as he smiled at the thought of Flintridge knowing that Draco was Harry's. 'Yes, let's go back. People are only going to gossip more the longer we're gone.'
Draco's rising panic was interrupted by a tapping at his window. Cursing, Draco threw off his covers and dragged himself from bed. Damn owl better have a good excuse for interrupting a perfectly good morning-after-freak-out.
Draco frowned. "How can we race if our legs are tied. Do we hop?" Embarrassing images filled his mind of falling flat on his face in front of a jeering crowd. He somehow knew he would find the one patch of mud in the whole field, even if there were no rain for the next three weeks.
"Not everyone limits themselves to a bedroom.” Her tone was losing her haughtiness as she gave in to her anger. "If Neville and I want to shag in the kitchen, we're damn well going to. It's
Draco looked gobsmacked for a moment before his face contracted in a familiar scowl. “Bollocks. That throws the field wide open again.” He pulled the parchment back as he got up from the desk and began pacing. “Okay, forget sun. Let’s look at heat.”
Potter kissed him softly on the brow. "Of course. I've fancied you for months. I'm not going to give up just because our first attempt at sex hit a bump."
Draco had left the Leaky Saturday morning before Potter even stirred. It was because he had plans for the day and had nothing to do with hiding his ridiculous bed hair and puffy eyes from Potter. And if Draco spent a few extra minutes on his hair Monday morning, it was only because appearances matter.
messed up everywhere. A mystery for another time. Harry had to get the children out of the bath and into their pyjamas before their guests arrived. They would want to see Hermione and Oliver before they went to bed—mainly so they could convince Oliver to read to them—but it meant Harry had to have them dry before the doorbell rang or face hallways lined with sodden footprints.
Draco sagged. “Well it doesn’t really narrow it down much, anyway.” He glared at the list. “Ben Nevis and Snowdon were unlikely locations to begin with.”
Harry threw his head back against the coach and laughed. It was a deep laugh that ran through his muscles and washed his tension away. 'No. No.' He shook his head and wiped a tear of mirth from his eye. 'Not at all.' His breathing slowed again. 'Not that she isn't a nice girl and all, but we don't have much in common.'
“So what do you think?” Charlie was looking at Harry with intense brown eyes, so much like Ginny’s and Mrs. Weasley’s. “Can you work with Draco?” He cocked his head to the side and narrowed his eyes slightly. “You know, if the two of you put the past aside, you’d probably work pretty well together, what with his understanding of dragons and your—”
'A wedding dress. She thinks Boot will propose soon, so she's already planning everything.' Draco sounded amused as he gathered the papers and adjusted the cushions.
Or maybe the jam was from the Victoria Sponge Cake he saw on the table as he entered the kitchen. At the other end of the kitchen was the friend who had helped him rebuild himself after the war and had given him the best thing in his life: his son. Astoria’s hair was swept up in a messy bun, and there was a bit of flour above her left brow. She looked and smelled like the comforts of home, and he couldn’t wait to hug her.
Draco's mind tried to process that he'd just snogged and frotted with Potter, and now Potter wanted to have dinner. Draco had planned to make a hasty exit so that he'd have time to pack his memories away before the race the next day.  He brushed some blades of grass off his clothing as he stalled for time.
Harry looked up from the latest memorandum on raid procedure and started considering possibilities. In vain. As usual, Ron couldn’t wait long enough for Harry to hazard a guess.
He stepped onto the stoop himself and shut the door firmly behind himself. “I’d rather not have my decor subjected to the same…
Draco dropped to his seat and forced himself to finish his report; it would make things easier for his replacement after Weasley Hexed him into the next millennium. Draco hoped they didn't have three-legged races in the future.
“If the place is that good, people will keep going. You know what these things are like: everyone makes a big fuss and two weeks later they’ve forgotten. Don’t seaside places quiet down for the winter anyway? By the time you go back in May, it will be booked solid again.”
Harry thought again. It all felt so long ago: another lifetime. When he thought of Malfoy sneering at him, he looked so young. Just a child.
That lovely pink returned to Potter's cheeks. "Not usually, no. I help Mrs. Weasley with her Sunday roasts, but this is the first time I've cooked one here."
Harry suddenly realised that this tree was not an isolated occurrence. “So you come out and feed them?”
Draco’s eyes widened, showing more of their shining grey. "Well that explains it. Old man Snipter says that when he tried growing Squib's Friend anywhere near those big poles it wouldn't grow."
“Well it does seem quite fitting,” Hermione said with a little nod as she poured herself more tea.  Harry wondered why it was fitting that Malfoy was good with dragons, and let his confusion show.  He followed Hermione’s eyes to Ron, who looked equally baffled.
At the edge of the village, leaning against the first building in the western row, was a large shed with the words “Rent-A-Broom” printed on the front. The broom lurched towards it like a horse who'd finally seen his stable.  Beside the shed, a figure stood waving.  As he approached, Harry could see a jolly, red-faced wizard who reminded Harry of Father Christmas.
That was unusual. Draco was sure that all of the Weasleys still shopped at Madam Malkins. Perhaps George? He did go in for high-end purchases more often then the rest, but Twilfitt and Tattings did not carry the flamboyant styles he favoured. In his curiosity, Draco made his way to the peep-hole. A portly little wizard stood at the door frowning at his pocket watch and then at the door. "It's eleven o'clock. You called for a fitting."
Potter looked sheepish as he asked the elf to bring his own school supplies. Did Potter think he would be excused from two weeks of work? Draco felt his mood sour. Of course Potter thought that. And he was probably right. Not Draco. Draco would have to have an elf deliver his essays so he wouldn't lose points for tardiness. Plague or not.
As he heard Merryn answer the phone, he looked down at the nearly blank page for April and wondered which of the few remaining reservations would be cancelled next.
“Which is why your lot need to get it off the streets. I have too many enemies.” His smile was a little too tight to pull off the playful tone.
Draco’s hands were smooth but his touch was firm. Harry found himself rocking his hips in time with each stroke, wanting to match Draco’s rhythm and follow his lead. Draco seemed pleased, mumbling fond words and making appreciative sounds.
, you'd stop to ask yourself if you love him, too.' She stepped so close their noses nearly touched. 'And if not, have the decency to let him go, because it will only hurt him more if you wait until you fall for someone else.' With that she pushed by him and returned to the party.
“Try the cake.” It had sounded too much like an order, so Draco softened his voice. “Please. I hope you like it.”
Draco grimaced a bit as he ran his tongue along his chin. He wrinkled his nose and looked thoughtful. 'Not
Draco stood very still staring out Harry’s sole window.  Finally, he looked at Harry.  “I heard my name.”
Potter dropped his gaze to the floor and ran a hand up the back of his neck. “Maybe it should have mattered two days ago,” he murmured.
? There is hope for you, yet.” He gestured for Harry to stand and then began slowly circling him like a wolf choosing the angle of his killing blow. Rather than attacking, he stopped short with a huff. “I can’t even
The magical food festival in Paris had been inspiring and well worth the trip. Draco and Aida had stayed for all four days of cooking demonstrations, lectures, and tastings while they met and caught up with various chefs and food critics.  Aida had even met a promising sous chef she was trying to recruit to the hotel. After the festival ended, Draco and Aida had travelled to the south of France to visit Aida’s family and enjoy the way the local cuisine made use of seafood. Aida would be there for two more weeks seeing loved ones and collecting new recipes and ideas, but Draco was eager to get home.
Harry was rewarded with the sight of Draco Malfoy falling apart in his hand.  He was flushed and gasping beneath him as his cock spurted across his chest.  His legs, still jutting up in the air, were trembling and slick with sweat.  Harry knew he wouldn't last long with that sight burned into his eyes.  He let go of himself and thrust hard and deep as his balls tightened and his whole body tensed into an explosion.
Harry stepped closer and pressed one hand to Malfoy’s cold cheek. His fingertips slid down below his ear where the skin grew warmer before disappearing under the soft green and silver scarf wrapped around Malfoy’s neck.
So Harry watched Draco as he tried to gather his thoughts. He watched as Blaise moved on and Hermione took his place. He watched as Padma joined them with Boot. He watched as Draco spoke and listened, laughed and nodded, but also pulled and twisted the edge of his sleeve. Harry wanted to step forward and embrace him to keep his hands still—Draco always relaxed into his hugs and ceased his fidgeting—but it wasn't fair to hug him if he didn't know what else he could offer.
“You’re blushing.” Draco stepped forward and cupped Harry’s cheek with his hand. “Look how beautiful you are when you blush.”
made sure to mention when Luna had been held captive in Malfoy Manor, once even suggesting that it was having captives which had inspired the idea of opening a hotel. No wonder people like this Kensa were worked up about it and didn’t feel it was a safe location for her brother’s wedding.
Potter laughed. "Not if you like leather beef and charcoal potatoes." He sighed dramatically before moving closer to Draco and nuzzling into his side. "I have some leftover spaghetti sauce I could reheat. I think I can manage to make pasta if you put some clothing on and stay at arm’s length."
And then, without permission or even a word of warning, Malfoy Vanished Harry’s shirt. Harry shouted his protest as he wrapped his arms around his chest. Instead of apologising, Malfoy flicked a couple of spells at the windows and door.
Harry felt as if he had fallen into his own body. All sound was muffled by the rushing of blood and Parkinson appeared far away as if he were watching her from the back of his skull.
“I just . . . there’s one requirement.”  Draco’s face darkened instantly.  “I want to see Teddy.  Neville is going to a conference in Berlin the week after Christmas, so he can bring him to Vienna and then back to England. And Teddy and I can stay in a hotel if there isn’t room or if it’s weird or . . .”  He realised that further words were likely not a good thing at that point.
. It was all his mind could formulate as he ran his free hand into Draco's hair. He wanted to laugh in relief, but there was no way he could take his mouth away from Draco's.
Draco clearly like the latter plan, as he shoved Harry back and pulled off the remains of his clothing as Harry just stared at the appearance of Draco’s hard, pink cock.
"Harry!" She snapped the book shut and stood to embrace him. "Ron says you are working with Draco." She was beaming. "I'm so glad he's back in the country and already consulting for the Ministry."
!" He couldn’t help but glare at her, and the stubborn set of her jaw assured him that she would not see reason any time soon.
Draco resisted sighing and banging his head against the front desk. “It depends. Why are you doing this?”
He wanted to argue. He wanted to make her choose better than he had, but maybe it wasn’t the same. At sixteen, Draco hadn’t really felt like he was choosing; the Dark Lord had given orders and Draco had followed out of fear. Maybe Merryn deserved to make her own mistakes. If she made a horrible mess of her life the way he had, at least it would be her own doing.
Draco felt the bounce of the grass that softened their landing and the twist of their bodies as they rolled down the hill in a tangle of limbs. When they finally stopped, Draco wasn't lying on grass. He felt a solid, chest moving up and down beneath him and hair tickling his face. He pushed up enough to meet Potter's eyes and was frozen by the intensity of his gaze.
Harry let his mind fill with images of Draco dripping wet and clad in nothing but a towel, his slender frame and porcelain build contradicting his broad shoulders and large hands. Harry couldn't help but wonder just how strong the other man was, how well he'd wrestle if Harry tried to pin him to the mattress.
on the lights. Two more days of sleepy smiles, sitting close, and quiet conversation. Worst of all, two more days of Potter stepping out of the bathroom with nothing on but a towel and smiling that little smile of his from underneath damp black hair.
And Harry wasn’t at Luna’s garden party, and he wasn’t at Seamus and Dean’s Football versus Quidditch party. It was as if he had ceased to exist, and Draco was running out of time before Hermione’s return and birthday.
Draco carried the bottle of wine and two glasses back into the sitting room.  “I don't suppose you're expecting me to call you Harry, are you?”
No longer distracted by the press of their arousal, they slowly bathed each other. Harry washed Draco’s hair, wondering at the way his hair felt even softer in the stream of the shower. Draco gave Harry and himself a very thorough cleaning of cock and arse, filling Harry’s mind with numerous possibilities for the rest of the night.
Was Malfoy here to fell a Christmas tree? The Great Hall was already decorated with a dozen large trees, but perhaps Malfoy wanted one for Slytherin or even his own room. Looking at the single tree glistening with tiny flakes of snow, Harry hoped Malfoy wouldn’t chop it down.
They moved between the trees, but not into the denser, darker heart of the forest. Instead, Malfoy led them to a bright clearing with a sole pine tree in the center. It wasn’t a large tree, only a head or two taller than Malfoy, but it was nicely shaped with long bushy branches that held the night’s snow.
Malfoy looked terrified. “And a hundred Weasleys! No, thank you. Although I doubt your are keen to visit mine.” His eyebrows pinched into a little frown. “Perhaps we should start off on neutral ground.”
He hadn’t seen anyone since the girl—Merryn—had shown him his room last night, as he’d been so exhausted he’d gone straight to bed. When he’d awoken, he’d found a full English breakfast laid out under a Statis Charm on a little table by a window. After a few cups of tea and a bigger breakfast than he ever ate away from the Burrow, his body was eager to burn off some energy, but he found himself equally eager to see Draco.
—" Potter shut his mouth and scowled. Draco continued to glare back until Potter's body sagged. "Let's not—Let's just focus on the race, okay? This whole event is about moving on from the past and embracing differences."
It took Draco a moment to decipher Potter’s comment; he had almost forgotten about the man between his thighs.  “Put me down, Blaise,” Draco ordered.  Blaise looked reluctant, but obeyed.  “See, Potter?  No problem.  Run along now.”
'Don't play coy, Parkinson.' He stood up straighter, not that she could see him, and used his most commanding voice. 'Who is Draco seeing?'
He leant forward, delighting in the solid press of Draco's chest against his own, and Draco didn't move away. He should just kiss him, but he needed to know he wouldn't be pushed away. He gathered his breath—and his courage—and whispered in Draco's ear.
Harry did his best not to remember The Orphans’ Ball. He didn’t want to remember Malfoy’s earnest eyes or his warm skin. Malfoy had seemed sincere about helping Hermione, but he had also seemed sincere about Harry. And maybe he had been. Maybe he intended to keep Harry as a bit of fun on the side. Harry pushed aside thoughts of Malfoy naked and smiling down at him through pale strands of messy hair. This was about whether Malfoy wanted to help pass legislation regarding magical beasts. "I guess he does."
“No, hon,” she'd retorted.  “You're pale and slim now.  Then, you looked like you'd recently died of starvation.  And now he sees you again and you're all fit, and he's finally figured out he likes cock . . .”  She'd waggled her eyebrows in an unflattering manner.
have to wait this long to get in the field?” he asked Draco bitterly one night as he slapped his book down on their coffee table. He was lying across the couch in front of the fireplace, whilst Draco was sitting on the second couch with his long legs tucked up. Draco marked his place in his own book before setting it down with a gentleness that scolded Harry for his own book treatment.
Potter strode forward with fierce eyes and squared shoulders. "Maybe I would have been hurt less if your
A knock to his shoulder alerted Harry he was staring. Again. Ron looked from Harry to Draco and back before rolling his eyes. “You set that up nicely,” he teased.
It was fifteen minutes before Hermione and Oliver were due over when Harry went in to wake Draco. He hated to interrupt the needed sleep—and Draco looked so stunning with his pale lashes against his flushed cheeks—but Draco would never forgive Harry if he didn’t have enough time to spell his teeth clean and his hair smooth before their guests arrived.
Determined not to be idle, Harry decided to Apparate to Snipter's Farm, Europe’s biggest supplier of magical plants outside of Italy. If the restricted plants were being bought legally, they were almost certainly being grown at Snipter’s. Rodney Snipter was the curmudgeonly old wizard who had been running the family farm for the past eighty years, but luckily for Harry, his nephew Reggie was far more personable.
bad, though. Don't know what Pansy was bitching about.' He seemed to realise that he was babbling because he suddenly looked up at Harry with pink cheeks.
He wanted Draco. He wanted to kiss him and touch him and see him without clothing in the way or the fear of getting caught. He wanted to run his hands over all that pale skin and lean muscle and—his cock was growing hard with each image and he wondered if Draco was experiencing the same reaction. He longed to push their bodies together to see if a hard length would meet him.
not good at subtlety. "I don't like them at all, Potter." He resisted growling at Potter's confused expression. "I'm gay!"
Potter closed the book on the quill and tossed them aside. “How are you feeling?” He put the back of his hand to Draco’s forehead with an ease that implied he had done it several times before. “Fever’s still gone. Been gone since this morning.”
Draco kissed him lightly on the cheek. 'You are unbelievably thoughtful,' he said with awe in his voice. 'I always hoped that it meant you felt something more than friendship for me, but I could never be sure.'
When the Prophet owl began tapping at the window, Harry still didn’t trust his legs to hold him. He was almost disappointed that Draco was able to stand and let the bird in. Harry would have to shag him harder next time.
something after all Harry went through to clear his name after the war,” Ron said. “If he’d just sat around that creepy manor of his twirling his hair all day, I think I’d have turned him into a ferret again. Permanently.” Ron got that wistful look that he usually reserved for imagining his mother’s pies.
But he had put it off long enough, so when Luna's latest invitation to dinner arrived in the beak of a spunky golden owl, he had found himself unable to do anything but accept.  That led to him standing in his own sitting room—starkers—clutching Floo powder and attempting to find the courage to throw it into the fire.
Her red lips gave a twitch of amusement and she looked pointedly over his ratty T-shirt and track bottoms. When she met his eye again, her expression assured him she had plenty of commentary on his current outfit, but she changed the topic completely. “Is it true you are attending the Angove-Bornstein wedding at Hotel Kalmynsi?” All pretence of coyness gave way to her usual eager demeanor.
The air back in Cornwall was definitely colder, but it felt more welcoming than any Mediterranean breeze. The harsh saltiness of it was familiar and entwined with memory. This was where Draco had found himself, where he had built a future for himself, and this was where Harry had come back into his life. A year later, Draco couldn’t smell sea air without being reminded of the smell of Harry’s skin after he went swimming.
Draco was almost disappointed when Potter pulled away, but he was quickly distracted by Potter's radiant smile. "Come out with us." Draco frowned in confusion. "Ron, Neville, and I are going to the Leaky to celebrate. You should join us."
“Well, we’ll get several weeks off.  Zhi always stays, which means Dave does, the fool. . .”  Draco seemed to realise he was rambling and fell silent.
"Now, now," Malfoy went on, "Don't get all explosive. I want Granger's legislation to pass, no matter how terrible she is with names and acronyms. I just want it to happen without the establishment getting up in arms and starting the usual hoopla about Muggle-borns destroying our ways. That kind of rhetoric didn't work out so well last time." His lips formed a wry smile, but there was a tightness around his eyes that reminded Harry that Malfoy had suffered as much as anyone in the war.
Draco was silent for a moment, looking Harry in the eye as if assessing his motives. Then he gave a nod so small it might not have been intentional before gazing out at the sea beyond them. He led them out of the rose garden and into a grassy field as he spoke. “It was really an excuse to cook. Well, bake really. Rosamund and Aida do most of the cooking.”
Didn’t have a … had she died? The boy didn’t look upset. Had it been some time? Was the newspaper article Harry had seen an obituary? Before he could begin to understand his feelings, Teddy cut in.
He replayed Parkinson's words carefully and realised that everything rested on one issue. 'How does he feel?'
Potter flopped into the matching armchair and ran his hands through his hair. "I can't believe we are stuck here for two weeks. Two weeks!"
Draco's smirk was haughty and smug, and it made Harry want to melt. 'Yes. I think I could be up for that,' he said as casually as one might agree to a cup of tea. He ran a smoothing hand over his shirt and hair and then retrieved his glass from the table beside them. Taking a sip, he winked at Harry before walking over to where Blaise and Parkinson were standing and staring. Harry just grinned at his back.
Zipping and buttoning the front, Harry found it odd that there was no matching pressure against his cock. Shouldn’t he feel the jeans press against him? Especially given how tight they were. He stood staring at his own crotch in confusion.
It was boring and required careful guard of his tongue, but it was far more peaceful than sharing a home with the Dark Lord.
He stood in front of the Floo at five minutes to seven.  He was dressed in a sage cashmere jumper and fitted charcoal trousers which he knew would hug his hips and arse perfectly.  He had been bitter with the realisation that Potter meant to hide him away in Muggle London, but he was determined to make the most of it.  His plan needed Potter to acknowledge him openly, but Draco would not be discouraged.  He was not afraid of a little work to get what he wanted.
remember from school is that you couldn't make it through a year without ending up in the hospital wing. Do try not to get us killed during a simple Muggle game."
Just when it was becoming too much, the heat and the pressure, Draco began shuddering and clenching around Harry’s cock. Free to chase his own orgasm, Harry dug his hands into Draco’s hips and thrust mindlessly until his body filled with a roaring bliss and his muscles all gave out. It was with his last strength that he uncoupled from Draco and aimed his collapse to one side.
With no company—he would not expect any from Potter, even if he hadn’t heard the sound of the shower starting—he settled into one of the twin armchairs by the fire. A little bookshelf beside him held battered copies of novels and books of poetry. He selected a small green book with ‘mystery’ in the title.
“Ron and Hermione said!” He sounded like he was still a school boy trying to offer the right answer to a stern professor. “Also,” his voice dropped to a mumble “I promised a bride I would be there for her wedding.”
"—he gave her a look to convey what could not be said in front of Scorpius—"but come morning…" He felt an echo of the pain in his chest when he had returned to his empty hotel room. No note. No sign that Potter had been there at all. All the hints that maybe Potter had actually cared were clearly either imagined or vanished when Potter woke up to remember who Draco was and what he had done. Seven years, and clearly nothing had really changed.
Harry sat up and clasped Draco's wrist before he could move away. "I didn’t think the worst because of
Killing Lucius had been surprisingly easy after a childhood of failure. It was as if losing the war (again) had broken his spirit. It was actually rather disappointing, but it made it easier to accept that he would never get credit for the deed. The simple act of writing out "Death Eater scum" in Lucius' blood had ensured the Aurors didn't even question that the murderer was retaliation for Lucius' war crimes. Again, it was almost too easy.
That was as difficult to process as the original realisation that Potter was a virgin. Months? That meant Potter’s feelings pre-dated any of Draco’s planning. That was before the drink they had shared at the Leaky.
Potter's surprise gave way to a beautiful smile and blush.  “Well, that's—I mean—I was happy to—I'm glad I—.”  He clamped his mouth shut and blushed deeper.  Potter was pretty adorable when he was flustered.
The bottle of wine Draco held out to him reminded Harry they were not to spend the evening in the doorway. He invited Draco in and led him to the kitchen. Conversation was awkward at first, but once they each had a glass of wine in hand and a safe topic (Quidditch), they fell into an easy exchange of opinion and gentle barbs. Harry was sure Oliver would lead Puddlemere to the cup, but Draco was too loyal a Falcon’s fan to accept that.
“That’s very funny,” Neville said. “Clever, but completely barmy.” He looked at Harry. “Course you would have no idea what he’s up to.” His eyes flicked to the side. “Your date approaches, so I’ll just say that good little pure-blood boys are raised not to have sex before the third date. I think Draco’s a little impatient, but not enough so to break with decorum.” He snorted a last laugh and clapped Harry on the shoulder. “Have fun tonight!”
The dragon took another step forward and sniffed at Draco with its long snout. Harry could see the huge teeth nearly touching Draco, and he felt his heart pounding in his chest and head. And then the dragon dropped his head to the ground at Draco’s feet, flattening its whole body along the earth.
He realised he'd moved his face closer to Draco's when he saw Draco's eyes widened further. It was almost comical, except that Harry could see how wide his pupils were. How dark. A shiver ran down his back.
Draco stared at Weasley blankly.  Was the Weasel actually soliciting his advice?  This was so dangerously close to respect that Draco didn't know what to make of it.  Weasley was looking increasingly impatient.
The thought of that man touching him at all made his skin itch and his stomach lurch.  Another glance back showed the man watching him from the doorway of the meeting room.  Draco bypassed his desk, hurried down the hall, and ducked into the loo.  He turned on the tap and scrubbed his hands in the hot water as if he could wash off Sothman's gaze.  Yes, he loved his job, but not enough to let that man touch him.  Sothman couldn't fire him for not having sex with him, but he could certainly make his life hell, and he—.
Draco was completely shocked.  Harry Potter had basically just confessed to falling in love with him and thinking about spending their future together.
Draco began to relay the history of the estate that had been in his mother's family for over a hundred years before it had been given to her by a distant aunt.  Bragging about family assets was familiar and he felt his body relax.  It was only as they reached his bedroom that he remembered Potter was not there for a tour.
Harry looked up at Malfoy’s scowl. How was he still so handsome when he scowled? Maybe the sharpness of his features allowed him to pull off harsh expressions so well. Malfoy threw his hands up, and Harry tried to keep his mind on charmed jeans.
“Eight Sickles,” she said kindly, making him think that she had once again read his concern. “Wizarding Europe is all on the Galleon,” she explained. He paid her and followed his instructions to the Rent-A-Broom stand down the street.
Ron snorted his agreement before commenting that they had better wrap the case up quickly. It was only a fortnight until Christmas and Molly wouldn’t take any excuse for missing it.
“Piss off,” he replied reflexively without even a glance.  This was a typical part of Draco going out.
Then he had the most daunting task of all: arranging for his mother to watch Scorpius without giving away any details. That didn’t work at all.
Harry nodded, pleased to hear Draco say the word Muggle with no hint of his past disdain. "Power lines. They carry electricity."
“These,” Draco leant slightly closer to reach the middle column. Harry could smell a garden on a summer’s day with the hints of leaves, dirt, and sunshine. Extra impressive for December.
Harry and Ron continued questioning Draco for another twenty minutes and Harry was repeatedly impressed with the knowledge behind each response.  When it neared nine o'clock, Draco handed over a neatly written report and said he'd be available for any follow-up questions they might have.  The whole procedure had been almost clinically professional, and Harry wasn't quite sure what to make of it.
Harry stood naked in the snowy wasteland, shivering as the cold seeped into his bones. There was nothing but white ground and grey sky for as far as he could see, so where was that beeping coming from?
Ron and Harry both knew Hermione had developed a truce with Malfoy when she had returned to Hogwarts. They’d never become friends, she had said, but they’d been been brought together by a mutual desire to do well on their N.E.W.T.s.  With Harry, Ron, and Neville in Auror training, she hadn’t had any friends in her year left to study with, and Malfoy had been completely isolated.  Apparently, the few returning Slytherins from their year showed no interest in socializing with a anyone branded with the Dark Mark, even if he had been cleared on Harry Potter’s testimony.
"Come back to England with me," he pleaded into her hair. "They are so dreadful. Don’t make me go back alone."
Harry would have found the knowing look far more annoying if he hadn’t been thrilled with the message. He was running back to the woods before he was even aware he had made the decision to move, Ron’s echoing “Happy Christmas” coming from behind him.
'Until I snogged you?' Harry gave a cheeky grin and delighted in the way Draco laughed: the skin around his eyes crinkled up and his head tipped back to show off his pale neck.
"You can cook?" It wasn't accusatory or disbelieving; it was hopeful and slightly desperate. He usually ignored Draco on the rare occasions when their paths crossed, but now he was staring right into Draco's eyes.
Draco shook his head and released a small, slightly hysterical, chuckle. "When I think of all the hours of sleep I've lost worrying about his reaction to that conversation..."
Harry could understand why Malfoy had left. The year after the war, people were angry and some were thirsty for blood. Narcissa's hearing had been largely ignored, but there had been an uproar when Lucius received ten years instead of life in Azkaban and Draco walked free. There had been plenty of newspaper articles about the injustice of it all, and Harry had to intervene on Draco’s behalf during a nasty scene in Diagon Alley that he suspected was not an isolated incident.
Draco continued his defence of the size of what they were baking, but he did a poor job hiding he was enjoying the argument. Harry would have been happy to stay there watching the three person scene play out, but he suddenly realised he could be caught eavesdropping. He knocked on the door and pushed it open more. “Hello? Sorry to interrupt.”
Of course, they all knew that whoever solved their own mystery first would make life much easier for the others. Not that Harry was working alone. When he got home, he owled Ron’s findings to Draco.
Harry wondered if he should be offended, as he had been with Toby the night before. But Malfoy insulting his clothing was
At the first bend in the road, he stopped and felt a deep rush of affection for the hedgerows that afforded him a sense of privacy despite standing on a
Clearly he had hit his head in the fall, and he was going to damn well enjoy the wet dream before he woke in St. Mungo's to some wrinkly mediwizard named Bernard dressing him in an over-starched hospital gown.
Finally there was a rumbling from within the cave, and Draco pulled himself up to his full height. Then the dragon emerged. Harry bit back a gasp as the pearl-like scales caught the midday sun and glittered. The dragon was small, obviously young, but no less intimidating than the Horntail Harry had fought so many years ago. It approached Draco and snorted a small red flame, but Draco didn’t flinch; he stood still and tall, staring at the dragon with fierce intensity.
"Fine! Harry Potter is cooking dinner for me at his house. We met up at an event in the spring but he’s an idiot, so he thought I was married until this morning. Happy?"
Malfoy stood a little taller, and turned to Harry with a haughtiness that reminded Harry of the boy from fifth-year. He never thought he would be so pleased to see that arrogance again.
“Come here, Harry. Stand up.” Draco’s words were insistent but so gentle. Once Harry was standing, Draco wrapped him in his arms and pressed kisses into his neck. “That was so good, Harry. So good.” Harry felt his cheeks heat and his chest swell at Draco’s words.
'Yes, that was pretty clear.' Draco pressed forward again so that his hipbone dug into Harry's groin. 'And that brings me back to the thing that's missing.' He stepped back and Harry might have whined at the loss. He felt cold and exposed in his own heated hallway.
Harry shifted under Draco’s condescending gaze. Put that way, the last week seemed far more interesting and important than Harry had realised. Draco stomped on and Harry found the other man’s upset weighing on him.
By Friday afternoon, he was wondering if Potter had changed his mind about dinner and was now avoiding him.  His nerves were increased by Sothman lurking around his desk and making little comments about looking forward to working together closely .  It was his last day before the man became his supervisor, and he wasn't even sure he had a date , let alone a possessive lover.  Not that the date part was strictly necessary, but someone like Potter would feel obliged to buy a man dinner before taking him to bed.  And who was Draco to turn down fine food and a public appearance with the wizarding world's precious Saviour ?
“Fuck!” Weasley yelled, startling Draco into silence.  “Fucking Clearwater.  We're not gonna get someone for days and all the leads will be cold.  Again.”  The man was actually a bit frightening when he was angry.
“And you?” Patil looked at Pomfrey with confusion. She clearly didn’t understand why she was being sent away from the person who usually healed all their ailments.
“Jameson was an idiot for not playing more aggressively,” Draco began again once Rosie was back behind the bar and out of earshot.  “Everyone knows the Spanish Seeker likes it rough.”  Draco purred the last three words in a way that caught the attention of Harry's whole body.  The conversation had turned to the national teams and the English Seeker's performance against Spain.  Harry was so engrossed in their debate over tactics that he had completely forgotten that he was skiving off a stake-out to be out on a date.  So it surprised him when the communication coin in his pocket began to burn.
Draco pulled Harry tight, pressing his lips to Harry’s neck and cheek before kissing him hard on the mouth. "We did it," he gasped against Harry’s lips. "We did it." He grinned almost manically. "Let’s celebrate!"
Jarred from his thoughts, he realised that the voice wasn’t Draco’s. He turned and saw Neville smiling at him. They exchanged pleasantries, and then Neville asked if Harry was waiting for someone. Harry couldn’t fight back his smile, and Neville chuckled.
With the war and the trials over, Draco finally allowed himself to imagine a future again. Unlike before the war, he no longer envisioned the wife his father would choose and the heirs with perfect bloodlines. His name was worth nothing in this new world, so he wouldn’t make himself miserable to preserve it.
Malfoy had slid down the wall and was now sitting with his long legs—still tethered together by his pants and trousers—stretched out in front of him. His limp cock rested on his lap. He looked up at Harry with a lazy grin. “I take it you like the jeans, too?”
"Well, well. This pretty bird has changed his tune." Vane slipped into the empty chair at the desk next to his. Draco was very glad that none of his colleagues were present. He tried ignoring her, but she put her feet up and waited him out.
Of course, Macmillan had been dating Finch-Flectchey by the time eighth-year began, but that didn't stop everyone from assuming he'd shagged Potter at
He struggled to open the vial with one hand, but he was able to coat a finger and set it aside without ruining the pristine bedding.  He ran his palm down Draco's side and arse, keeping his slick fingers away until he reached those perfect, plump cheeks.  He pulled the globes apart and ran a finger down the cleft in between.
Harry was unsure how to start the conversation again.  He was feeling vulnerable after his confession, even though it was hardly a great revelation.  Surely Draco knew he liked him; why else would Harry have asked him on a date in the first place?  But it still felt like a confession, and he was acutely aware of Draco's lack of reply.  But Draco must like him as well, right?  He'd agreed to a date!
Draco met Potter’s eye. Potter was clearly trying to calm him, his hands raised in placation. Draco wondered how much he knew.
Someone grabbed Draco and whirled him around.  Just as he felt his back hit the wall, he saw Blaise Zabini's predatory smile.  Blaise had one of Draco's thighs in each hand, lifting them to hip-height.  Instinctively, Draco wrapped his legs around the other man's waist to keep from falling.
He could arrive any minute.  Any second now .  His mental chant had been the same since five o'clock.  Cursing his nerves, he went into the kitchen to open a bottle of wine.  It was as he was debating taking out a second glass that the Floo roared to life in the other room.
Oh, and the noise Draco was making. The slurping and smacking sounds were indecent. Harry was trying to keep himself from moaning just so he could hear every noise Draco made.
Draco felt a coldness that was unrelated to Potter taking all his cosy heat away. "Weasley and Longbottom? No, I don't think they would want—that's probably not a good idea."
With a hand on the front door knob, Draco turned to look back at Harry. "Do you have a date to Hermione’s party?"
It was amazing. It was the best blow job of Harry's life. Okay, it was the only one, but Harry couldn't imagine that
It was very distracting to fly with Draco. Harry should have been scouring the countryside for greenhouses, wind tunnels, or just lots of plants. Instead, his eyes constantly drifted over to the man beside him.
Harry wanted to argue. It hurt to be told his favourite clothes were man-repellent, but he couldn't ignore the evidence: Toby attracted men and Harry didn’t. Their clothing was one of the few significant differences between them, and it might explain Harry’s lack of luck in the wizarding world, as well. The only witches and wizards who approached Harry these days were the most brazen sort, clearly just interested in his fame.
holiday there? Really? Ohmygod. We’re getting married the third weekend in April. The day before Easter! Oh please tell me you will be there!”
He scanned the area outside, but he could make out little more than the outline of the wind tunnels against the deeper blackness behind them. He needed to get Draco out of there, but the safest—and quietest—way to find him was to silently stand guard and wait for Draco to come to him.
“Really? Who is it?” Gwenna asked. Draco could see the glimmer of hope in her eyes. She didn’t need the hotel to survive. She didn’t need the money, and it meant her family home was constantly full of strangers, but she cared for Draco, Aida, Rosamund and Merryn, and she knew they all desperately wanted the hotel to be a success. Draco suddenly found himself wanting to fight for the hotel, too. He hadn’t realised he had given up until that moment. Until he saw a way to save it. Because if anyone could undo all the bad press Rita Skeeter had foisted on Hotel Kalmynsi, it was Potter. And he’d already volunteered for the job.
'That was incredible,' Harry gasped. He was breathing so hard that he wondered if he'd remembered to breathe at all as Draco had tended to him—no
“Now look what you've done,” Draco said to Blaise.  “You've set off the Saviour's hero complex.”  He leant to the side so he could see his would-be hero.  “I don't need rescuing.”  He threw in a dismissive hand flick for good measure.  “Go find a damsel in distress.”
Draco helped him to his feet. “Come along, you. I’m sure they have a room set aside for you at St Mungo’s.”
He tried to lift the confusing jumper over Potter's head, but it got stuck just below the man's nose.  “Ow!  Wait!  Hold on, there's a zip!”  Draco froze and watched awkwardly as Potter lowered the garment and fiddled with a little piece of metal on the front.  The neck of the thing grew and he easily pulled it off over his head.  “There's one on my jeans, too.  Want me to show you?”  Potter's flirty tone helped Draco get over his embarrassment.  He had done some reading about what to expect that night, but none of the magazines or books had addressed removing his partner's Muggle clothes.
Draco left so quickly he didn't notice Harry rooted to the spot behind the door. Neither did Pansy when Harry heard her heels clop by a moment later.
Harry glanced back at his friends and saw that Ron had joined Hermione with a possessive arm around her shoulder. Hermione was pink-cheeked and smiling, and that was the difference. Draco didn't want to be held back by an arm around his shoulders, and Harry didn't want to impede the way he danced among the wizarding elite.
He was incredibly tight, and Harry felt a jolt of possessive pleasure as he considered that it must have been a while for Draco, too.   Take that Zabini!  Remembering his concern about rough former-lovers, Harry took his time to stretch Draco gently.  When he added a second finger, he began to feel around for that sensitive spot that would add to Draco's pleasure.
Should he say what he really meant, or should he try to tone it down?  “I mean it's not just this Christmas I want to spend with you.  I think about us years from now.  I think about us living together and wonder about us having children.  I know we've only been dating a couple of months, and maybe you think I'm crazy, but I've known you forever and I've liked you for years, and I . . .  I don't know, I just feel like it's always been you .”
And speaking of Hermione. Draco set down the article and leaned forward in his armchair. Yes, there was bushy hair in his fireplace calling for him. He moved to the chair by the fire and saw Hermione’s agitated face in flames. He felt a flash of worry. She had said she was going to the Leaky to see some friends before leaving on her trip to Romania in the morning. Why was she fire-calling him?
