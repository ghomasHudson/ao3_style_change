Draco chuckled against Harry’s mouth, one hand on his shoulder as he shifted on the bed. Harry kept his hands in his lap, unsure of what to do, trying to relax, let it happen. The kiss grew clumsy, too much teeth, too fast too soon. Draco pulled away. Harry’s stomach sank. But the other man’s smile was soft, confused but kind.
About a week after Harry’s article in
Draco had to admit, it was very in character. He stood, shaking his head. “Why?” he demanded. “Why do any of it in the first place?”
“Like I’ve been pummelled by Bludgers,” Draco mumbled. He made his way to his usual chair, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes. Harry made Draco his tea as well as his own, still smiling to himself. Something about seeing sleepy Draco in Harry’s bathrobe made his heart want to burst. He passed Draco his tea in his floral-print cup, which Draco took gratefully. Harry watched as he nursed his tea, holding the cup with both hands and taking tiny sips. Harry set his own cup back in its saucer and leaned back in his chair.
Harry nodded as his eyes widened behind his glasses. “I promise.”
Malfoy laughed softly. “Fair enough,” he said. “Well, as I said before, I just got back from France. Visiting family, all that. They would rather know why I’m not married yet rather than my recent work on cancer treatment potions.”
“So this was just one night, then?” he asked the stone floor.
“Yeah, sure, that makes sense. Scootch.”
The king rolled his eyes. That, more than anything, set Harry off.
Harry went back to his office after breakfast, hoping to get some work done on a new lesson plan for the fifth-year class. He had only just sat down at his desk and opened his notebook when there was a knock on his door.
Draco snorted. “Maybe,” he said, “but I distinctly remember Mr. Weasley getting into a fist fight with my father in Flourish and Blotts when we were twelve.”
Harry shrugged, Draco rising and falling against his chest. “What can you do?” Harry asked in response. “Touching is okay?”
Harry thought. For a moment, he could have sworn he heard Death sigh wearily. Then, she answered.
Distantly from the first-floor toilet, he heard Draco shout back, “No one is on time to a gala, babe, calm down.”
, a voice whispered in his ear,
Ron stared at Draco as he stood, frozen, in the kitchen doorway. Draco looked at him over the rim of his mug, one eyebrow arched as he leaned against the farmhouse-style kitchen sink. Outside, the bleak winter sun shone on the frozen earth around the Burrow, and Draco could just hear Harry laughing at something Molly Weasley said. Ron shook his head slowly and rubbed his eyes.
“What are you so surprised about?” he asked, a cold edge to his voice. “That there’s such a thing as an amicable break up, or that I’m gay?”
“Draco, no, don’t-!”
“Hm?”
The icy touch of Draco’s hand brushing his shoulder made Harry turn. Draco smiled at him, a warm light in his silver eyes. Harry tried to stifle the hopeful leap his heart gave when his eyes met Draco’s, to resist the desperate need for touch.
When Draco stepped out of the fireplace in the Great Hall, which had been temporarily set up to Floo students in and out for the holidays, Harry was there. He grinned as Harry all but jumped into his arms, and even though they got a few odd looks from the other students, Draco found he didn’t care. He buried his face in Harry’s curls and breathed in the smell of him, of cedar and black pepper.
Draco waved him off and busied himself with sautéing the onions. “I’m Pureblood, I’m related to almost every British witch or wizard to some degree. I’m sure we’re related if you go back far enough.”
“Say it with me – you’re not broken.”
“Gods, I don’t know if that was incredibly stupid, or incredibly brave,” Draco said, still trying to get his giggles under control.
The first couple weeks of terms passed in a blur. Harry had half-forgotten what it was like to be in school, to have to study and do homework. But after a few jarring days, he had settled back into his old routines and patterns, with one exception.
“Blood’s supposed to be internal anyway,” Draco mumbled. Harry ignored him and turned to Kellen.
“Do you want to get a drink with me?”
Draco nodded, then realised the priest couldn’t see him. “Yes,” he said. “I think I do.” He hesitated, then asked, “Do you mind if I ask what your family name is?”
“I mean,” Teddy curled in on himself, wrapping his arms tight around his waist as he addressed his knees, “sometimes I feel like I’m a boy, and sometimes I feel like I’m a girl.”
“Oh, I’m already having a laugh,” she pointed out. “Ha ha ha, see? No, this is for science. Or, rather, the bet I’ve had with Blaise for the better part of twelve years. Don’t tell him I told you.”
Harry stiffened. Draco sighed and pushed himself away, out of Harry’s arms, to lean back in his chair with an exhausted sigh. Harry’s hands fell to his sides, his expression unusually stoic.
The nausea passed until it was just an ache in his gut. He pushed his hair off his forehead, passed his wand over himself to wick away the sweat, wiped his clammy hands on his trousers. The kettle whistled. He set about putting the tea things on a tray while the kettle poured the boiling water into a teapot, which in turn floated over to the spot Draco had made for it on the tray. He carried it into the living room, grateful that his hands didn’t shake, not once.
“No, you’re right, I should have asked. It
“It’s accurate,” Draco mumbled, fixing his gaze stubbornly on Harry’s collarbone. Harry rolled his eyes.
“Alright, that’s enough,” said Harry. “Thank you, Kellen. I’ll see you tomorrow in the office, okay?”
Harry looked stunned. “Who told you that?”
“So, when are we meeting him then?” he asked. Harry flushed bright red. Here it was, the moment he had been dreading from the start.
“What did you have in mind?” Hermione asked. Harry turned in his chair, pushing his hair out of his face with a determined set in his jaw.
Pansy, who had become a Healer with Draco but specialised in permanent spell damage, had asked him during one of their first summers in the apprenticeship program why he never wore short sleeved shirts. He hadn’t been able to tell her then. It was not, in fact, until they had been working together for three years that he showed her the Mark and asked if she could remove it. She had grown quiet and sad as she examined his forearm, covered not only in the Mark but thin silvery scars, some long and some small. She never asked about those. He never told her. In the end, she had not been able to remove the Mark. It seemed no one could. The Dark Lord had made sure of that.
“Give me my phone, Malfoy.”
Draco nipped playfully at Harry’s ear, making him yelp. “That settles it,” Draco said, “you’re definitely not going to France.”
“Always so elegant,” he sneered, but there was no malice in his voice. He even let go of Harry’s hand in order to pass him a serviette, muttering, “Honestly, you’d think you were raised by animals.” Harry grinned and shook his head as he took the serviette from Draco. He wiped his mouth, nonetheless.
Hermione pulled him into a one arm hug and rested her head on his shoulder with a sigh. “I know,” she said. “You and Ron wouldn’t last a day without me.” She smiled when Harry laughed. “If they wrote a book about our adventures, it should be titled,
“So, how’d it go?” Ron asked. Harry fell into the chair at the kitchen table across from Ron, still dazed. Ron sipped his tea. He could tell
“Harry.” He grinned broadly, and Draco couldn’t help but grin back. “Nice to meet you.”
Draco huffed. He straightened his hair with a pout, checking his reflection again. “Does this look okay?” he asked the mirror.
“Mmhm?”
Draco always made his bed with hospital corners, the white sheets taut over the thin mattress. His pillow was a deep green silk, a welcome contrast to the white. Harry let his fingers brush over the silk, relishing the soft touch. Draco’s desk, as always, was neat, his pens tidied and his textbooks in alphabetical order. He didn’t have any pictures of his family or his friends – instead, there were pictures of a countryside covered in lavender, of old buildings made of honey limestone, and of rocky beaches and the iron coloured sea beyond. A part of Harry wanted to pull open his drawers, peak inside the clean exterior, but he knew better. He knew better. And yet.
“I will never leave you,” Harry said softly. “Not just because it is apparently physically impossible, but because you are everything to me. I only wish I had figured it out sooner.”
“My apologies – ”
Draco gave his testimony as calmly and in as neutral a voice as he could, just as Harry had told him. “Any emotion they will use against you,” he had warned as he straightened the collar of Draco’s dress shirt and smoothed out the shoulders. “Just give the facts, nothing more.”
“That is very good to hear,” Narcissa was saying. “I told Draco that teaching would be a good change of pace from him, after working with St. Mungo’s all these years. I’m glad to see that you two are getting along as well, after everything.”
“Very nice to meet you, Wilkins,” Harry said. Wilkins positively blushed.
Potter
“Oh yeah. I heard about that. No wonder he’s keeping his head low I guess. Still, wouldn’t be surprised if he follows in Daddy’s footsteps, if you know what I mean.”
Harry swallowed hard past his racing heart, which had become lodged in his throat. Draco must have seen something in his eyes. He sat up, the concerned little crease between his eyebrows forming as he looked down at Harry.
Draco shook his head and looked away, rubbing at his jaw with one hand. “Not really, no,” he said. “I tried, but… no, it was always Harry.”
Draco stared at the wand for a moment, blinking. When he took it, he was surprised his hand didn’t shake. The wand tingled against his skin, electric, but there was something different there too, like an open flame licking up around the core, warm and eager. He frowned.
“Am I bad person for not wanting a big wedding?” Potter asked, his chin digging into his arm as he spoke. Draco resisted the immediate urge to swaddle him in a blanket and hold him close, instead allowing himself to reassure Potter that “of course he wasn’t a bad person, he was Harry bloody Potter, it was physically and patently impossible for him to be a bad person.”
The minute he spoke, the look on Malfoy’s face was gone, replaced with a neutral mask.
He felt himself relax as his magic met Draco’s, almost as familiar as his own. It tasted like petrichor and metal on his tongue, was soft as silk but cold as dragon scales. Draco’s eyes closed. For a moment, it seemed that he let Harry’s magic relearn his, let it linger over where Harry knew the Mark to be, let it travel up his arm and brush the column of his throat. Then his eyes opened. Harry’s magic was slammed back at him in a tidal wave. Harry only had a moment to ground himself before it hit him, pushing his chair back an inch and snatching the air out of his lungs. Draco raised an eyebrow.
As Draco kissed along his navel, sucking love bites into the curve of his hips, Harry had to prop himself up on his elbows to watch and remind himself that this was real. Draco’s mouth ghosted over the tent his erection was making beneath the towel. He looked up at Harry through his lashes, and all Harry could do was nod fervently, having to stem the tide of his rambling by biting his lip to keep himself grounded. Draco grinned before dropping a kiss to Harry’s cock through the fabric. Harry pressed a hand over his mouth to stifle the moan. He swallowed hard as Draco’s nimble fingers pulled away the towel, letting it fall to either side of Harry’s legs.
“Come in,” he called. When he looked up from his notes, there was Malfoy, leaning against the doorframe. Harry was surprised to find that the self-satisfied smirk was gone. He couldn’t quite figure out Malfoy’s expression – if he didn’t know better, he would’ve said it was longing. But no, that couldn’t be it.
Harry, tucked in a corner in the hall by the sitting room door, grinned ear to ear. He loved the man the minute he laid eyes on him. This was a man, after all, who had been his father’s friend, who knew about his past, his future, his destiny, surely. How could he not love him? Especially when, for the first time in Harry’s life, someone saw the bruises fading ugly on his skin and refused to stay silent?
“How long have you known?” Draco asked, pulling off a corner of his bread.
“Yes,” said Malfoy, his smile hopeful and soft. “I’d like that.”
“What?” he asked.
There was another crash. This time, they could hear Lilly’s shrill voice as she shrieked, “I’m telling Daddy!”, followed by Albus trying to shush her. Harry groaned and strode towards the hallway.
!” Malfoy hissed. Then, as if remembering who he was talking to, he seemed to recover some of his aloof composure and added in a hollow monotone, “It’s an honour to serve the Dark Lord.”
“Mr. Harry Potter, sir!” he squeaked. “This is an honour! Wilkins has heard so much about you!”
“Your friends cannot follow us everywhere,” Draco pointed out. “And we have separate classes.”
“So what did you think about just then?” Draco asked, a confused frown etched into the corners of his mouth. Harry didn’t look at him as he put his wand back into the pocket of his pyjama bottoms.
Draco swallowed hard. He had tried to think of what he wanted to say as Pansy pushed him into the Floo, but the minute he had seen Harry… Any words he had cobbled together went out of his mind entirely.
But Draco was shaking his head. “You didn’t deserve everything I did to you. Said about you. To you. I’m sorry. I was a dick. I was a bully. I was cruel and mean and… and you didn’t deserve it.”
“The green one was more festive, dear,” said the mirror wearily. Draco groaned and dug back through the pile of discarded clothes in front of the closet. “Are you sure” he asked, holding up the green jumper against the black one he was wearing. “I feel like it’s too on the nose.”
“They’re just going to have to get used to it,” he murmured, pressing a chaste kiss to the corner of Harry’s grinning mouth. “Because I’m not going to let you go, I promise.”
Harry was quiet for a long time. “I don’t understand,” he finally whispered. Draco groaned.
“Perfectly alright, my boy,” he replied. He turned to Draco. “As far as your tale, Mr. Malfoy – don’t worry, I believe every word, but you have to admit, it is quite a tale. I assure you, I do not blame you for your attempts to kill me. You had much to lose if you didn’t succeed. Now, of course, we must consider what to do in light of all this. Are you willing to hear what I have to say?”
“Why are you up here?” asked Draco, knowing the answer but wanting Potter’s voice to fill the silence. Potter shivered a little as a breeze passed through.
“I know, but still.” Harry buried his face against Draco’s hair and sighed. “Do you want kids one day?” he asked, his voice quiet and soft. Draco shrugged, too tired and tipsy to be embarrassed.
. Tell everyone to calm down, that we’re adults in a consenting relationship and to leave us the hell alone.” Draco pulled a face. Harry shook his head and took off his glasses to rub his eyes. “You got a better idea?” he asked, hooking his glasses back on.
“…We’re literally in bed together right now…”
They stood like that for a minute too long. Then Malfoy stepped away, letting his hand drop, and the moment was gone.
“I know,” Harry said, even as he took off his jacket and hung it up on the coat rack, knelt down to unlace and take off his boots, just like it was just another normal date. His smile was nervous, though, when he turned back to Draco. He took his glasses off to clean them with the hem of his shirt, and that’s when Draco saw the dark, heavy shadows under those summer green eyes. Draco turned away and stalked off to the living room, knowing without looking that Harry would follow.
“It’s like the Yule Ball all over again,” he observed, his voice distant even as his grip on Harry’s arm tightened ever so slightly. Harry looked over at him and smiled.
“Draco?”
“You what?” he spluttered. “You’re dating that ferret?”
“Know what?” Draco demanded of the clouds.
Harry nodded. “He’s in the living room,” he squeaked. Molly took a deep breath, her hands on her hips as the pots began stirring themselves behind her.
Harry smiled at this, but his frown quickly returned. He poked at his shepherd’s pie. What was so urgent that it kept Malfoy away? It was a Friday, so he knew Malfoy didn’t have afternoon classes – not that he had memorized Malfoy’s teaching schedule or anything. Maybe he would swing by after his last class before dinner and check on him. That would count as tonight, right?
Draco swore silently. He sat back down, considering his options as he tried to steady his sprinting pulse. Did he ask for the truth, and risk exposing himself in front of everyone, or go for the dare and pray that Potter had mercy on him? He let out a short huff. Right. Only one thing to do. He raised his chin a little in challenge. “Your choice,
“It’s great to see her doing something she loves, you know? A happy Pansy is a good thing for everyone, let me tell you,” said Draco, taking a bite of his pizza. “She had an existential crisis about a year ago after working I think five graveyard shifts in a row, and I thought I would have to find a new flatmate because she was going to go run off to Iceland and become a sheep herder. Thank gods she didn’t. Could you imagine her as a shepherd? The woman wears heels when she wants to relax.
Draco raised his eyebrows. Harry shrugged.
“I never said – ”
Draco lowered his hand from his mouth, his lip trembling. “I love you, too,” he said, his voice thick with tears and years of longing.
So it was settled. They would spend Christmas morning with Draco’s mother at Malfoy Manor, and Christmas evening with the Weasleys at the Burrow. As a result, they decided to exchange presents on Christmas Eve. That is why the two of them were sat in front of the fire in Harry’s room – or rather, what was becoming
Jenkins shook his head with wide eyes. Harry leaned in, his smile becoming a conspiratorial smirk as he lowered his voice and said, “It was me. Right after he tried to use the
The blood drained from Andromeda’s face. Harry bounced Teddy on his knee and tried to distract the boy from the tension between the other two by stealing his nose.
He bit his lip. When he raised his eyes, Harry gasped.
“It’s beautiful. Thank you,” he murmured. Lucius nodded with a tight smile.
“To be fair, I was spying on you at the time,” Harry pointed out. “And besides, I think I did more damage later that year.” He brushed Draco’s collarbone through his button-down, the scars hidden by ink, fabric and a very ugly pillow. Draco tried to shrug and smile it away, but his lips trembled and he clutched the pillow tighter.
Harry was surprised. It was a simple flat, a one bedroom on the second floor of a converted town house. The living room was immaculately clean and minimalist, all shades of grey and green. There was a kitchenette separated from the living room by a long counter that served as a breakfast bar. Harry guessed he was expecting something much more lavish, but this looked… empty.
Draco looked at him in mock scandalised surprise. “Really?” he said with an exaggerated gasp. “Who would have thought?”
“Then what were you going on about?”
Draco clutched at his cup of tea in his new ‘Property of Draco Malfoy’ mug as he looked into Harry’s sincere green eyes. In those eyes, Draco could see his past, present and future with Harry, clear as the day dawning outside their window. What he saw gave him hope like nothing else could. He leaned forward and gave Harry a lingering kiss. When he pulled away, Harry tried to follow, and he smiled, filled to the brim with happiness and contentment. He set both their cups of tea on the bedside table before straddling Harry’s hips and taking his head in his hands.
Harry rubbed the sleep from his eyes as he propped himself up on one arm. “Nightmare?” he mumbled groggily. “Tell me about it. What happened?”
“Why did you want me to see those?” Harry asked. He crossed his arms across his chest, searching the other man’s face. Draco gave him his one-shoulder shrug.
“Galloping gargoyles, Draco,” Harry muttered. He pulled Draco against him nonetheless and pressed a kiss to the top of his head. “Be glad I like you so much, or I’d hex you.”
“I, uh, might have said I was bringing a friend,” said Draco. Harry pinched the bridge of his nose. Of course.
Draco shrugged. He tapped his fingers against the mug. “Your snoring didn’t help matters,” he retorted, looking up with a half-smile to let him know he was joking. Harry smiled back. Draco’s own smile faltered, and he looked down at his tea. “But yes. Still. Always,” he added, taking a sip. “Nothing ever really helps.”
Harry pulled back to look him in the eye. “Fuck me,” he said.
“You definitely called me baby.”
Draco nodded. “Okay,” he whispered, his breath ghosting across Harry’s lips. “Okay.” He pulled Harry in close to him as they laid back down in the bed, limbs tangled and foreheads pressed together, noses brushing. Harry stroked Draco’s cheekbone with his thumb, and Draco threaded his fingers back into Harry’s hair to hold him there. They fell asleep like that, chests rising and falling together. It was the best night’s sleep either of them had had in years.
“Quite close quarters,” Harry agreed with a serious nod. “In fact, Draco spends most of his free time in my – ”
Draco smothered his giggles as he tried to sober up. Harry grinned and shook his head, taking his seat beside her. “No, we’re not high,” he assured her. “We’re just allergic to judgemental looks, that’s all.”
“Well, he’s delightful,” said Kellen. Her gaze met Harry’s, and they both immediately burst out laughing.
Summer passed into autumn, and autumn into winter. Harry threw himself into his new life, into school and clubbing on the weekends, into football practice and memorising the London Tube. He tried to put all thoughts of the man in the manor out of his mind. When Ron called him on the landline in his dormitory, Harry sounded cheerful, excited by his criminology degree, by everything London had to offer. But when Ron asked if he was coming home for Christmas, Harry grew quiet. Then, he forced out, “Yeah, yeah, they’re kicking us out of the dorms over the winter hols, so yeah, yeah I’ll be back. Yeah, if that’s okay, tell your mum I should be done with classes around the twelfth or so. Yeah. Looking forward to it.”
Another pause. “There’s nothing wrong with me.”
“Thank you,” Harry said, trying to catch Draco’s eye so that he knew he meant it. “The Tennyson belonged to my mother. It’s the only thing of hers that I have.” When Draco’s brow furrowed in confusion, he added, “My parents died in a car crash when I was a baby. That’s why I have a scar.” He pointed at the silver lightning-bolt shaped scar on his forehead.
Draco inched forward, his gaze flickering between Harry’s eyes and his slightly parted lips. Harry wondered distantly if he could feel how sweaty his hands were around Draco’s.
“What about you?” Draco asked. “Do you have any favourite books?”
Maybe it was in those long, uncomfortable months after his trial, when he first came to 12 Grimmauld Place to apologise, for everything. Maybe it was when Potter started inviting him over for potluck dinner with his friends, simply because Draco had said he was a little lonely, stuck in the Manor with only his mother for company. Or maybe it was when he had drunkenly confessed, after sharing a bottle of wine as they celebrated Draco passing his Potions Mastery Exam, that he wanted to work for the Auror department but didn’t want to be an Auror. Potter showed up on his doorstep the next day with an application to be part of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement’s Forensics team.
Draco was twelve when he first heard it. Singing, voices lifted in a hymn, rolling over the Wiltshire fields. He had frowned and followed, ignoring his mother’s advice to stay near the grounds, to never stray too far. Down a narrow towpath, through a baffle gate and a little used dirt road overhung by trees older than memory, he found it. A simple stone building in a clearing with leaded windows and a heavy oak door, propped open to let in the gentle summer breeze. Yarrow and borage grew thick around the edges of the clearing, and the grass had begun to brown in the heat of the day. For a moment, he stood there, transported, listening to the hymn fill the clearing like birdsong. Then, he slipped in.
Potter nodded. He set his cup down. “I can understand that,” he said. He reached out then and took the hand Draco still had in his lap. Draco jumped at the contact, almost spilling tea on himself. Potter’s hand was warm and dry, his palm and fingertips rough and calloused against Draco’s skin. Potter held his hand and gave it a small squeeze. Draco stared at it, disbelieving. He glanced up at Potter, leaning forward in his chair and looking at Draco with his earnest green eyes, and felt like Potter had struck him with lightning. “Try it,” Potter was saying. Draco struggled to listen to him as electricity burned through his veins under the other man’s gaze. “Come back to Hogwarts this next term. If it’s too much, you don’t have to stay. Just… try.”
Draco grinned. “You and Pansy would get on famously, Aunt Andromeda,” he said. Harry, still blushing under Andromeda’s questioning eye, ducked his head and tried to squirm his away from Draco.
Malfoy flashed him a grin. “I’ll take that promise and raise it to a bet. If it does end badly, your coffee’s on me.”
“It’ll be okay,” Harry promised.
Harry snorted. “No,” he said, laughing. “Ginny’s the only ex who’s ever seen the place.”
Parkinson sneered at him, his thin lips curling like a hyena’s. “I bet you’re gay,” he said, his voice low.
Draco blushed. “Er…well, there was one about five years ago, we had been dating a while, and she, er, did technically meet him.”
Someone was standing at the wrought iron fence between numbers eleven and thirteen, staring at the brick fronting as if it had personally offended them. There was a Glamour charm on them so that Harry’s gaze kept wanting to slide off them, like oil on water. When he was a couple feet away, the figure turned, and Harry froze, mouth agape, as the Glamour charm fell away.
Luna greeted him at the door with her trademark dreamy smile. She was wearing blue coveralls and a yellow cardigan, her long hair braided in an intricate plait hanging to her hips. Behind her, the party was in full swing. Ginny’s teammates towered above their old schoolmates and coworkers, making Luna seem even more petite and fragile in comparison. But then he remembered what she had been through. What they had all been through. And he corrected himself – Luna was not fragile, she was stronger than any of them.
“So what? Potter looked at a bloke?”
“She and I broke up,” Potter mumbled. “Earlier this year. And, er, she got signed to play with the Harpies, so she’s not coming.”
The king draped himself over the throne, one leg slung over the arm of the chair as he lounged in midnight black robes, a single silver pin at his throat. His long, white-blond hair was tied in a plait, loose fair strands framing high cheekbones and eyes the colour of a storm-tossed sea. He smiled, pale pink lips twisting into a devilish sneer.
“Maybe I need ink too. See you tomorrow, after breakfast?” When Draco inclined his head, confused and tentative but still technically an affirmation, Harry grinned and rolled back on his heels. “Brill. Looking forward to it!” He strode off, whistling to himself as he went. Draco watched him go with a frown.
, she wrote.
Draco pursed his lips. “Always trying to save the world, aren’t you?” he said, only half-joking. Harry shrugged. Draco shifted onto his side and pulled Harry into his arms without really thinking about it, as if it was natural to hold Harry, as if his arms were made to fit around him like a puzzle piece. “No,” he murmured, “I had to learn the hard way. I’d been coddled all my life. Besides, I certainly didn’t need a bloody Gryffindor swooping in to save the day.” Harry snickered against his neck, his breath tickling Draco’s sensitive skin. “What about you? I’ve gone and poured out my troubles, it’s your turn.”
Harry bit back the words threatening to spill out of his mouth. Draco looked at him. Draco tried to control his emotions, but Harry could see it all, had learned to read him better than anything over the past nine years. In the turn of his eyebrow, the shape of his mouth, the tightness of his jaw, he saw the hope, the fear, the sweet adoration as clear as day, and his heart leapt.
Malfoy burst out laughing.
“Harry.”
“Still doesn’t explain why you’re sitting with me, of all people.”
“Perfect. It’s a date.”
Dawkins shook himself. Suddenly unable to meet Harry’s gaze, he turned and began waving at the officers guarding the prisoner. “Right, right. You lot know the drill, let’s get this man back to the department.”
Draco sighed. He bowed his head to Harry’s chest, his warm breath stirring the hair there. Harry knew he had won when he felt Draco give him a quick little kiss to the dip of his chest before rolling out of Harry’s arms. He sat at the edge of the bed for a moment, collecting himself. The light played on his back, highlighting the sharp angles of his shoulder blades, throwing the curve of his lumbar spine into shadow, his skin like soft marble. Harry’s ribs felt too small for his heart, and he bit his lip, trying to hold it all in. He sat up and shuffled over to Draco, pressing up against his back as he rested his hands on Draco’s narrow shoulders. Draco leaned his had back and Harry bent to kiss him, small and chaste.
“Why are you like this?” he murmured, brushing another snowflake from Harry’s cheek. Harry raised an eyebrow.
Wilkins frowned. “Wilkins couldn’t say sir,” he said. “When he was younger, the young master was more… open with his moods. But since the war…there was nothing out of the ordinary about him, sir,” he assured Harry. “He was just… quiet?”
“You missed matins!” said Father Nicola in way of greeting, striding up the nave to meet them. He cast a curious eye at Harry, who was craning his neck to look at the lofted ceilings, the old oak beams. “What brings you here today?”
“I like you,” was all Teddy said before taking Draco’s hand and all but tug-boating the man out of the living room. Draco let himself be led, turning to stage-whisper dramatically over his shoulder, “He likes me!”
Hermione shook her head. “No, they couldn’t. There’s a spell – ”
“Something must have come up,” he said. There was soil in his hair. When Harry pointed it out, Neville laughed. “Oh yeah,” he said. “The third years learned that some plants do not like getting re-potted. Occupational hazard.”
“I really thought I’d be able to do it.” His voice was quiet, as if speaking only to himself. “I thought the Cabinet would be a last resort, that I wouldn’t need it. Do you know what happens, when you send something through the Vanishing Cabinet when it’s broken? Sometimes it doesn’t come back at all. Other times, it comes back, broken.” He took a deep, shuddering breath. Harry drew closer so that he stood next to Malfoy, looking up at the other boy’s pointed face. Only then did he see the tears slipping down Malfoy’s cheeks. “I’m not a killer, Potter,” he continued, the words choked and ragged. “I’m not. I can’t. I’m going to fail, and he’s going to kill my mother, and then he’s going to kill
“Yes,” Harry said, even as Draco pleaded with his eyes to shut up, “we do make quite a pair, don’t we, Draco?”
Back at Grimmauld Place, Harry laid Draco down on the guest bed – Draco’s bed – and propped him up with all the pillows he could find. He tossed his Auror robes onto his long-abandoned cot bed and rolled up his sleeves. Then he helped Draco out of his robes and his dress shirt so he could assess the damage. He inhaled sharply through his teeth. Black and blue bruises covered Draco’s pale ribcage and bloomed across his waist and stomach. Draco leaned his head back against the pillows with a pained breath.
Draco frowned. “You live with this boy?” he asked. When Harry nodded, he let out a series of incredibly imaginative curses under his breath, most of which Harry didn’t understand because they seemed to be in French. “And your aunt and uncle don’t say or do anything?”
“My godson, Teddy Lupin. Remus Lupin’s son. He’s actually starting his first year at Hogwarts this September. He mainly lives with his grandmother but he stays with me from time to time.”
But Potter was not ready to walk with Death. And maybe that, above all, was what Draco put his faith in – that Potter would fight to the end, would conquer Death if he had to if it meant saving the people he loved. And when, in that final duel, Potter emerged victorious, holding the Elder Wand aloft, Draco fell to his knees and wept. “He’s okay,” he sobbed, unheeded, as the crowd surged to carry their saviour away. “He made it. He’s okay.”
“I hate you, you know that?” Draco called after Harry as he galloped down the stairs.
“Hey,” he murmured.
“Oh gods! Oh my eyes!” he yelled, covering his eyes with his hands. “Merlin’s saggy tits, is there nothing sacred in this world anymore?”
“You really are dating Draco Malfoy, then,” she said at last. Harry sighed.
“I think we should look into that source, sir,” said Harry. A realization had begun to form in the back of his mind, the pieces coming together the longer he looked at Ivanovich’s snarling face. “I think someone was trying to kill two birds with one stone, as it were.” Dawkins’ eyes widened, his ruddy cheeks blanching.
“Having fun?” Draco asked. There was a bitterness to his words that made Harry pull back, confused. The world had begun to tilt to one side again. Harry made his way over to the bed and flopped down onto the slightly mildewy sheets.
“Twenty-one. Or I was, I guess.” He frowned at his shoes. “I don’t know now.”
“Draco, I swear to God…”
“You looked like you were talking to someone you loved,” Luna said, as if that explained everything. “By the way, you didn’t hang up.”
Draco, not quite knowing what to say, stayed quiet. He turned so that he could face Potter, leaning one arm on the railing of the balustrade. He considered the smaller man. Potter was only about a head shorter than Draco, and though his frame was narrow there was muscle there, a solidness and strength. He was only wearing grey joggers and a green jumper that was slightly too big for him. His sneakers were filthy. Draco found himself oddly self-conscious in the face of such blatant comfort. He was still wearing his uniform, not having changed for bed as he had left the common room for his evening walk. He wished he had filled out like Potter had, so easily fitting into adulthood. But when Potter looked at him like that, he felt a little less uncomfortable in his skin, a little more at home.
Harry heard a quiet, disparaging laugh behind him. “Wow, I really can’t catch a break, can I?” Malfoy whispered. Harry shot him a look to tell him to be quiet, but Malfoy only shook his head.
“No, sir,” she said. “You have to stay here, protect the witness. You know that.”
?” – chatting about Pansy’s promotion from orderly to Assistant Medi-Witch.
Harry’s head snapped up. Draco’s jaw dropped.
“It’s a start,” Harry countered. “Hermione has more reason to hate you and she, well, doesn’t.”
Draco folded his hands in his lap. “I’m surprised you didn’t wake the whole castle,” he said, aiming for teasing but coming up short. Harry grimaced and fell back against the pillows, one hand pushing into his curls.
“There is nothing else, Draco. I promise, it’ll be okay. I’ll come with you. I’ll be there the whole time. But we have to tell him.”
But Harry grinned. He picked up his book and came over to the other side of the bed, setting his wand and glasses on the bedside table. Draco watched, wide-eyed, as Harry got under the covers and laid next to Draco, holding the book out to him.
When they finally pulled apart, leaning their foreheads together, not quite wanting it to end, their breath was ragged, their chests rising and falling against each other. Draco searched Harry’s face, one of his hands disentangling from Harry’s hair to ghost his fingertips against cheekbones, the line of his jaw, the curve of his neck. Harry shivered at the touch.
“Why ever not? She’s a good girl, and her family’s one of the sacred 28 – sure, she’s a little sickly, but Draco, what other possible objection could you have to this match?” Something dawned in Lucius’s face and he smiled, spreading his hands as if absolving a sinner. “If this is about finding a love match, I completely understand, but I don’t think you’ll find a better girl than Miss Greengrass. Besides, you can always find a mistress later.”
,” he jerked his head in Malfoy’s direction, “was who I was meeting, I would never have come.”
“And why not use the Killing curse?” Harry added, gesturing at the blood-spattered table with his coffee cup. “Why use that particular curse? This was personal. Vindictive.”
He met someone. A man named Theo in his Forensic Science class. And for a few weeks, it was fun, it was great, he could pretend he was falling for him. Every night, though, he closed his eyes and saw a pale figure in a crisp white button-down and charcoal-coloured trousers, an angular face with soft grey eyes. After two months, Harry stopped returning Theo’s calls. He stopped going to clubs. His roommate, an eager boy named Colin that Harry couldn’t shake the feeling he had met before, only saw him leave their dorm to go to class, the gym, and the café down the road. The few friends he had made chalked it up to first year exam nerves. But when Ron met him at the rail station that summer, he could see the shadows under his friend’s eyes and he knew that something was wrong.
Wilkins shook his head.
“I like him,” Harry announced with a grin. Draco couldn’t help but grin back, but it didn’t last long. His grin shook, slipped into a frown as he stared at their joined hands. Harry shifted so that he could face Draco better, dipped his head to try and get into Draco’s line of sight. “Come on, Draco,” he murmured, “talk to me.”
Malfoy hummed in affirmation, half his face buried in his pillow. “Exhausting, both of them,” he said, his voice muffled against the pillow. He looked at Harry with one eye. “You don’t speak French, do you?” he asked.
“Yes, Teddy?” There was the sound of plates being set on the kitchen table, the scrape of a chair being pulled back.
But he was already dropping down to the garden below. He walked away in the darkness, lit only by the waxing moon, his hands in his jacket pockets as he watched the gravel crunch beneath his shoes. With each step, he felt his chest collapse further in on itself, like paper in his fist. He pushed through, forcing himself to breathe. It was all in his head, he told himself. It wasn’t real.
“Leave him alone,” she wailed at Harry. “He doesn’t want to talk to you.”
It was Sunday. The post office was closed.
“Yeah,” Draco said. He bit his lip as he watched Harry’s dark form weave its way through the people outside until it disappeared around the corner. “I’ve only seen him like that a few times, and every one of those was disastrous. You didn’t hear me say this, but I’m scared shitless. Something really awful must have happened.”
“Oh. Olivander did say something about changing loyalties. But it should still work, yeah?”
“Fuck, anything.”
Malfoy was his number one rival. Since day one, they had been at each other’s throats. It hadn’t exactly been a moment of great significance – Malfoy had offered to show Harry around the school, but he had declined, and apparently that was a great enough offence for Malfoy to target Harry for the next several years. He was eleven, and didn’t know who he had just snubbed, but Malfoy never let him live it down. Of course, Malfoy found other things to bully him about. His glasses, his second-hand clothes, the scar on his forehead from the car crash that had killed his parents…. Harry was just glad Malfoy hadn’t found out his biggest secret. But now, even that was at risk. You couldn’t share a room with someone and not find out they were gay. Or, in Harry’s case, bisexual.
“Ron!”
Harry shrugged. “Your guess is as good as mine,” he said. He ran a hand up and down Draco’s back as they both considered their new predicament. “Oliver never had a boyfriend here… He was smart about that. We have the team….”
Harry looked up, his grin splitting across his face. “Why am
“No,” he said. “No, of course not. Hey.” He pressed a feather-light kiss against the corner of Draco’s mouth, tasting the remains of a salty tear. “This is real,” he whispered, his breath warm against the shell of Draco’s ear. It was Draco’s turn to shiver. He turned his head, chasing Harry’s lips, when there was a knock at the door.
Hermione nodded. Draco could practically see her drawing up a mental note to research Pureblood marriage traditions later, and he had to resist the urge to roll his eyes. Harry frowned.
There was a pause, then –
“Sure you don’t want the day off?” a voice boomed behind them. It was Robards. He clapped a hand on Harry’s shoulder, his dark eyes twinkling. “I think you’ve earned a break. Take the weekend off. We’ll see you back in the office bright and early Monday morning, alright? Take care, Mr. Malfoy,” he added with a nod to Draco. He gave them a convivial wave before disappearing just as quickly as he appeared. Harry let out a breath he didn’t know he’d been holding.
“Don’t you think you do it on purpose?” she asked him. She had dragged him to one of the new wine bars that had started to pop up. This one was owned by a witch that bore a striking resemblance to Professor Trelawney, with her layered beaded necklaces and silver bangles announcing her presence as she moved about her clientele. He and Pansy sat at a high-top table in the corner, sharing a bottle of Zinfandel while Draco bemoaned the fact that he was going to end up a crazy cat lady for the millionth time. “You date men that are a good shag,” she continued, “but that’s it. Why don’t you try to find someone who actually
“I have to admit, I was already a bit nervous, showing up to this sketchy place.” He gestured around him with a roll of his head. Harry, frowning as he listened, slid down the wall to sit on the ground next to Malfoy, never once taking his eyes off of Malfoy’s face, enthralled by the tale he told.
Draco groaned. “I hate you.”
“No, Piers. What is this new gossip?” Malfoy was saying with exaggerated glee.
“I don’t care if it’s a long story, there shouldn’t be a story at all. You’re not here to gossip with your friends, Potter, you’re here to work.”
“You disapprove,” she stated. Harry opened and closed his mouth. Finally, picking his words carefully, he said,
“I didn’t know what to do,” he admitted softly. “But then there was a great crashing sound from the campsite, and they looked up and saw me. For a moment, none of us said anything, just stared at each other. Then there was another crash, and screams, and the sound of people running into the woods, away from whatever was going on at the campsite. I panicked. ‘Run,’ I told them. ‘Go. Before anyone sees.
“Diagonal. Like Diagon Alley!”
“You’re tiny and you know it. That’s what makes you such a good Seeker.”
Harry pressed his cheek to the top of Draco’s head when Draco made no move to pull away. “You good?” he asked, his voice strangely loud in the quiet air. Draco’s shoulders rose and fell in a shrug.
“Well,” Harry said, wrapping his arm around Draco and relaxing against him, “at least it can’t get any worse than that, right?” Draco rolled his eyes and pulled him in closer.
Harry inhaled sharply. “Oh shit. Malfoy – Draco, I’m so sorry.”
“‘Go on,
“Don’t do that,” he said coolly. “It’s not polite.”
No matter how many years he spent on the force or the number of crime scenes he visited, he never got used to the sight. It didn’t help that the scene was splattered in blood, or that Harry knew the victims, but it especially didn’t help that Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy were dead, in their own home.
Harry turned to him. It was like a switch had been flipped. Gone was the anger. His magic settled, his curls flopping down into their mess of wavy ringlets once again. He stuck his wand into his back pocket. His eyes were wide with concern as he made his way to Draco.
“I don’t know why I asked.”
“No,” Hermione said firmly. “No, I don’t think that’s possible. I know you, Harry James Potter, and you love people so fiercely that it puts the rest of us to shame. Do you hear me? Never think for a second that Voldemort took that from you, because it is simply not possible. You hear me?” She waited for him to nod, then sat up. “Now, I love you, dear, but if I’m going to get to the library, you need to go. Maybe get dinner with Ron, because goodness knows I’m not going home until the library kicks me out.”
“What was that for?”
They landed with a pop in Draco’s entryway, Harry swaying up against him, maybe only slightly accidentally. He put a hand on Draco’s chest to steady himself, his other hand still caught in Draco’s. Harry caught his eye and smiled. Draco pulled away.
“One step at a time,” he murmured. “You got this.”
They landed on Draco’s doorstep. Draco steadied Harry, who had landed somewhat evenly, as he opened the door for them. Even before the door closed behind them, Harry was pulling him in for another kiss. A laugh bubbled up out of Draco’s chest. Gods, when was the last time he laughed like that?
Harry pulled away, his brow furrowing. “Since when do you speak French?” he demanded. Draco shrugged.
Harry nodded. He dug a nail under the bottle’s label, succeeded in prying off a corner of it. “Yeah, I made Junior Auror last month,” he said. The smile he forced didn’t last long. Especially not after Malfoy asked him how that was going. “Great,” he mumbled. “Fantastic. Spectacular.” He took another swig and set the beer down on the small table near Malfoy. Passing this close, he could smell Malfoy’s cologne, mint and citrus mixed with vanilla. Harry swallowed hard and leaned away, back to his side of the balcony.
“What do you mean?”
– our main newspaper – that Harry Potter had married Ginny Weasley, the sister of his best friend.” Harry’s jaw dropped. Draco shrugged and continued, “I know, but in my world, they had been dating since before the war began. It was the logical next step, I guess. It’s stupid to think now, but in that moment when I read the announcement in the paper, I truly felt that I had lost… everything.”
Then, he frowned.
Draco stared at the phone in his hand. He swallowed hard. Luna’s distant voice played over and over in his head –
“It’s been tradition to give this watch to every Malfoy heir when he comes of age for generations. It is only right that it be passed to you now.”
, he thought. The image came crystal clear to him – Lucius and Narcissa on metal trays deep below St. Mungo’s in the freezing morgue, unable to be buried until the case was over, and Draco, unable to say goodbye.
Harry straightened up, wiping at his eyes as he muttered, “God damn it, Jamie.” He cleared his throat and said to Teddy, “I’ll be right back, but just know, I love you and support you whatever you decide to do. Let me just….”
“I’m sorry,” Potter whispered again, his voice thick with his tears. Draco shook his head.
“Happy Christmas, Harry.”
“Okay,” he murmured. “Okay. So you want to be together?” Harry nodded.
“‘Aragorn led them to the right arm of the river. Here upon its western side under the shadow of Tol Brandir a green lawn ran down to the water from the feet of Amon Hen….’”
He tapped the nib of the quill against the parchment as he pulled his lower lip against his teeth. Hermione turned the parchment around so he could have more space to write, one eyebrow raised as she studied his face. Harry let out a huff, then wrote,
Harry watched Draco’s expression struggle to remain impassive, his eyebrows contracting as he frowned at his mother’s grip on his sleeve. His grey eyes wavered between desperate hope and hurt. Harry, who had been halfway to the door, walked back over to him and wrapped an arm around Draco’s narrow shoulders. Draco started at the contact, but just as quickly relaxed against Harry’s touch. He sighed.
Draco chuckled. He kissed him on the forehead. “
Malfoy scoffed. “Of course you don’t.” Still, he didn’t look at Harry. Harry let out a huff. When Malfoy didn’t turn back to him, his gaze slipped from studying Malfoy’s profile to where his trouser had ridden up slightly, revealing the white skin of his ankle and the inky design of a serpentine tail. Harry frowned.
“Ron. He once accidentally blew up his aunt. I’m sure if Malfoy did try to hurt him, we’d be the ones helping Harry cleaning up his remains, not the other way round.”
“Oh, and
Harry lowered the phone, shaking his head with a smile. The sun hung low in the sky in the late summer evening as he sat at a circular table in the beer garden of a pub overlooking the Thames. Ron and Hermione had gone to the bar to order the next round of drinks. Neville, who was visiting London before going back up to Hogwarts for the start of term, was deep in conversation with Ginny about her upcoming wedding. She had her arm on the back of her fiancée’s, Luna’s, chair, absent-mindedly playing with her long blonde hair. Luna, meanwhile, looked over at Harry, cocking her head as she considered him.
Draco hesitated. Then, he blurted out, “Why did you break up with Ginny?” Only then, when the words hung in the air, unretractable, did he look up.
“How long has it been?” Harry repeated, voice level. There were spots of colour high on King Draco’s cheeks, and if Harry wasn’t so furious at his ineptitude – or, more likely, his counsellors – he would have found it endearing. King Draco looked down at the map. For a moment, Harry thought he wasn’t going to answer. Then,
“This is different, sir. I know the victims, I went to school with their son,” Harry argued. He didn’t take the file. Robards sighed.
“And what about what I told you last year? About who I am, where I’m from?” Draco demanded, twisting around to face Harry properly. “Last year, you had a bloody panic attack and ran away from me. What the fuck has changed since then?”
“I – The thing is… Do you really think I’m the love of your life?”
“Well excuse me, I do apologise your royal bloody highness, but not all of us were born with one silver spoon in our mouths and one shoved so far up our own arse that it hits the first spoon. Some of us had to put our own survival and well-being ahead of learning how to talk pretty in court, all right? If you can’t handle that, then fine – find another necromancer to clean up your problem.”
“I saw there’s a – er, a fireplace, in the guest room,” Malfoy said finally, not looking up. Harry nodded, confused. “It’s not, er, connected to the Floo network, is it?” He glanced up, his grey eyes betraying a flash of fear.
“Your mother knows?” Harry murmured, breaking the comfortable silence. Draco’s hand paused in his hair.
Draco hiccoughed. He wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist and pulled them both back down to the bed, nestled in each other’s arms. “You cheesy git,” he mumbled into the crook of Harry’s neck. Harry chuckled. He turned his head and kissed Draco’s temple three times in quick succession, before settling himself back onto the pillows.
“Are you saying you’ve missed me, Potter?”
“You have to admit, though, it’s accurate.”
When Harry opened his eyes, his heart was racing against his ribcage and his breath came in short, wheezing gasps. He tumbled forward onto his hands and knees, glasses forgotten on the ground. The pain in his head was gone. Yet still, his mind raced, trying somehow to piece it all together. He gulped in air like he had run a marathon, one hand scrabbling at his chest, as if he could open his ribcage and release his speeding heart.
“Lovely fellow,” she said at last. Harry let out a mirthless laugh, then followed her down the corridor and off the train.
So it was that the day they all returned from the winter holidays, Harry found another origami crane waiting for him on his four-poster bed. He picked it up and shoved it unceremoniously into his pocket before Ron could see. That night, when they were all tucked away in their beds, Harry once again closed the curtains and read the note by the light of his wand.
“Or we could split it so Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws get one room, and the Gryffindors get the other,” Zacharias interjected. He smirked as he glanced over at Malfoy, who had perched on the arm of a sofa and didn’t seem to be paying much attention to the discussion. “Which means you get to keep an eye on the Death Eater.”
“I’ve always been nice,” he said, “just not to you. You should be honoured, this is a privilege reserved for a select few.”
“Come on, Draco! You know his type! They can’t keep their hands to themselves.”
Malfoy let out a startled laugh as his smirk spread into a grin. “Auror Potter,” he drawled, “are you asking me on a date?”
“I’ve heard about him, about his family,
curse. But,” he straightened up, his green eyes sparkling with smug mischief behind his glasses, “I can assure you, I didn’t do this, since I was in the office when it happened. So bang goes that theory as well. Maybe try not jumping to conclusions before you have all the evidence, eh, Jenkins?”
“You don’t have to say anything if you don’t want to,” Harry murmured, his earnest eyes warm like summer. But Draco shook his head and forced a smile.
“Sometimes it’s Ron and Hermione,” he said. “Or Sirius, or Lupin. Sometimes, I think of my parents – I’m not sure if it’s a memory or a dream, but it’s something.”
Draco froze. Harry’s Adam’s apple bobbed as he swallowed, one hand scrubbing through his hair as he reeled backwards from his own declaration. Draco opened his mouth, closed it again.
He turned, pressing his shoulder into the wall as he furrowed his brow at Malfoy. “How did you find Ivanovich, then? Craigslist?”
Draco sighed. “Yes, that’s fine. Anything else?”
, Death murmured, already beginning to fade.
“It’s an explanation,” said Harry. He looked up at Draco through his thick lashes, a ruddy blush spreading across his cheeks, and Draco had to remind himself to breathe. “I owe you an explanation,” Harry continued. “Can I come in? If you still don’t want me after, you can throw me back out. But please, just let me try and explain.”
As he stepped out of his flat and was about to lock the door behind him, he heard a commotion down the hall. He finished locking up and followed the sound of some incredibly colourful cursing that Harry could have sworn was half in French. It appeared that he wasn’t the only one moving in today. Someone had tripped on their way up the stairs while carrying a box, which had split open and spilled what seemed like several hundred books all over the stairwell. Harry immediately began picking them up, stacking them in his arms, already asking if the man was alright, if he had hurt anything.
Every time, Harry would push down the tears, the urge to try and stop the death, to avert her path, to save them. When he saw the young girl from down the road laid out in her casket, her sparkling black eyes closed to the light of day pouring in through the warped glass of the sitting room window, he had wanted to fall to his knees and sob. He had known she would die the week before. She was one of the few children who didn’t fear his cousin enough to play with him, who made him laugh and forget that when he went home, he would have to clean out the chamber pots and wash the bed linens.
“Harry!” Ginny sat up, her cheeks almost as red as her hair. “Where - ?”
“Malfoy,” Ron replied automatically. He looked from Draco, smirking like a cat, to Harry, still blushing and with hickeys blooming on his neck. “Right,” he said, dragging the word out slowly as he backed away. “I will…come back… later.” With that, he turned and left, closing the door behind him with a click.
Instinctively, irrationally, he winced, expecting a blow that didn’t come. Draco moved his hand from the back of the sofa to rest on Harry’s knee, before it slipped down his shin to curl around his ankle, his touch sending an electric current through Harry’s leg. Draco’s thumb brushed back and forth against the jut of his ankle bone. Harry shivered.
Harry frowned as he processed this new information. He’d known Malfoy’s father was a prominent government official, but he never really knew in what capacity. He also knew that the Malfoys were one of the older British families that had still held on to some of their ancestral titles and money, but again, never really grasped the specifics. Now, though, looking at Malfoy’s slumped form across from him, he began to understand.
“Okay,” he said slowly. “I love you, too. Any reason for this little announcement?”
“Yeah,” he said. “I do, actually.”
“But, Malfoy, what
“He would have let his people die.”
“Listen, the last time I tried that, I never got those trousers back. And my wand is in my pocket, I don’t want to risk it. Off.”
Harry scoffed. “Because you’re gorgeous,” he said, like it was obvious. “I think you made a mistake taking the Mark, and you did some horrible things when you were a kid.” Draco knew this was all true but couldn’t see where Harry was going with it. “But like I said, we get to be ourselves now. And I want to get to know you, and I want you to get to know me, and I really, really want to kiss you.”
“Yeah,” he said, his voice gruff. “Yeah, I saw.”
“Kill me softly then,” he murmured against Harry’s temple as he placed another kiss there. Harry shook his head but dropped his hands with a sappy grin spread across his face. He turned as Draco’s arms wrapped around him and whispered against Draco’s lips,
His head snapped up. He’d know that voice anywhere. It cut through the din like a clap of thunder.
?! Cormac’s kid?! Come on, Teddy, you’ve got to have better taste than that!” Harry squawked. Teddy’s hair matched his crimson cheeks as he dug his phone out of his pocket. He pulled up a picture of the boy in question – after mobile phones became popular, Hogwarts had to update their anti-Muggle technology wards so that the phones could work, at least to a limited extent. Teddy shoved his phone over the island to show them. Draco and Harry leaned forward to squint at the small screen. The picture wasn’t great quality, but Draco had to admit, the younger McLaggen had inherited his father’s swagger. Harry frowned.
“Fuck off, Malfoy.”
Harry hummed. “The group from Beauxbatons back in fourth year really did help my bisexual awakening,” he admitted as he stirred the vegetables and prodded at the rice and lentils. “I couldn’t decide who was prettier, the French girls or the French boys.”
“Fine,” he said at last. He set the tray down on the table and sat across from Potter as they waited for the kettle to boil. Potter was watching him, his green eyes owl-like in their unblinking focus. Draco looked out the window, at the daffodils blooming yellow amongst the frozen grass. Potter followed his gaze. Draco took the chance to glance over at him, to see the Boy Who Lived Twice, the Boy Who Saved His and His Mother’s Life.
Ron crossed his arms over his chest as he scowled at Harry. Harry set his jaw and refused to look away. They sat like that in tense silence for a long minute. Then, finally, Ron conceded defeat. His shoulders slumped and his scowl relaxed into a frown.
“I guess I am,” he replied. He cocked his head and looked Harry up and down. Harry couldn’t quite make out his face, but he saw something flash in those storm grey eyes that made his stomach clench. “What’s your name?” the man asked curiously.
“You’ve never brought a lady home since the Weaselette? God, Potter, I pity the state of your love life.”
“Do you want a drink?”
Harry beamed. He grabbed his leather jacket and Auror badge from his robes – “Don’t want to scare them off by wearing my uniform,” he explained when Draco raised an eyebrow – and off they went. A couple hours later, they had gotten an ID off of a merchant smuggling crocodile hearts, along with the last known whereabouts of the manufacturer. They passed on the intel to the Auror officers in charge of arrests and before midnight they had caught the man, a half-goblin named Orkin who was suspected of selling various illegal poisons as well as counterfeit potions. Draco and Potter walked out of the Ministry offices, exhausted but triumphant, close to one in the morning.
“You can’t be serious,” he said with his old drawl. Harry, who was helping the other teachers decorate the Great Hall with tinsel and evergreen branches, frowned at Draco where he sat perched on top of one of the dining tables.
“London’s changed you, mate,” he said. Harry raised his eyebrows at him. “You’re so… I don’t know. Quiet.”
The first week or so passed without incident. Harry was surprised at how civil the other boy was being but refused to let his guard down. He watched Malfoy like a hawk, all while pretending to ignore him, until he had his roommate’s routine memorized. They were both early risers, Harry for football practice and Malfoy for whatever nefarious reason. He would usually be drinking a cup of coffee from the Nespresso machine he had installed on his desk by the time Harry left for practice. As far as Harry could tell, Malfoy’s diet was eighty per cent black coffee and twenty per cent salad. Not that Harry watched what Malfoy ate at the dining hall. Since they were taking different A levels, Harry only shared one class with Malfoy: English. Their teacher, Professor Lupin, was new to the school but had apparently gotten the memo about the two of them. He had pulled the two aside after the first class and asked if their rivalry was going to disrupt the rest of the class. To Harry’s continued surprise, Malfoy had shaken his head.
“It is if I’m living here. And hold up, are you not straight?”
The priest didn’t seem surprised to see Draco when he did, finally, finish and turn around. He only smiled that secret-sharing smile and came over to his pew, his hands in the pockets of his black trousers.
Draco nodded, somewhat stunned. Potter had been listening to him after all.
The figure had turned right at the landing, so Harry did the same. Distantly, he thought he should stop, go and get Ron and Hermione. Something stopped him, though. Almost like… he had been here before.
Malfoy nodded, lips pressed into a thin line, almost a smile. “Water? Or something stronger?” he asked, lifting one eyebrow. Definitely a smile now, small but there. Harry smiled back.
“Hello, Aunt Andromeda,” he said, voice soft. “It’s nice to finally meet you. Mother told me so much about you.”
“Because,” Harry said as slow and clear as possible, “he’s my boyfriend and if I’m going to bring a date to an official event, I’m going to bring him. Also, this is bigger than both of us. People need to see that it’s okay for us to be out in the open, rather than trying to hide who we are.”
Harry shook his head slowly, glancing from Draco to Ginny and back again. “No,” he said. “No, that can’t – how do you even prove any of that? Anyone could just say they were soulmates, it doesn’t mean….”
“Christ on a cracker, Draco!” Harry threw his hands into the air with a harsh laugh. “Just believe me, won’t you? I love you. Not Ginny. I’m bisexual, and I love you. And I’m not just saying that because I’m taking the piss. I.” He came up, one hand running up Draco’s neck. “Love.” He pressed two fingers under Draco’s chin, made him look him in the eye. “You.”
“Yes, sir, I did,” he replied, his tone matching Robards’. Harry was slightly taller than Robards, who was in contrast stout and barrel-chested, a man of war during a time of peace. Robards looked at Harry as if he wasn’t sure whether to be disappointed or impressed.
, a voice whispered in his ear.
McGonagall hummed and set her cup down in its saucer. “But you have no reservations beyond that in regards to his character?” she prompted, studying him over her glasses. Harry rubbed his face, pushing his own glasses up into his curls to scrub at his eyes. He wanted to say yes, that Malfoy was still the arrogant brat he had known during their school years, but… he was almost thirty, and it had been years. He wasn’t completely unaware of what Malfoy had been up to since he had been released from Azkaban – he had been sentenced to a year, but got off after six months for good behaviour, and because Harry had testified on his behalf at both his initial trial and his appeal. He had apparently gotten his NEWTs through a private tutor – it had been too much of a risk for him to come back to Hogwarts – and then on to a certification to be a Potions Master. He collaborated with St. Mungo’s Healers to devise new potions for the medical field, and was known throughout the wizarding community not for his family, but for his accomplishments. Harry couldn’t help but feel a bit proud of the bastard. Not that he would ever tell him that.
Harry shrugged without looking up from his hands. “If it comes up.”
“What, you’re okay with being accused of buying drugs, but not with people thinking you’re straight?” His words were serious, but he couldn’t help the incredulous grin spreading across his face. “Christ, you need to sort your priorities before you take that before a judge.”
Luna answered ‘truth’, which made Padma roll her eyes. Evidently she had been hoping for a ‘dare’, if only to show how the game was played. She asked Luna an easy question – ‘have you ever been caught sleepwalking?’ – to which Luna smiled dreamily and replied, ‘not yet.’ Then it was Luna’s turn, and the game rolled on. Draco didn’t pay much attention. A younger him would have loved to get the dirt on some of his classmates, the perfect material to tease and bully them with. Now, he couldn’t care less. He kept looking over at Potter, who was staring at a fixed spot next to his foot, a shadow haunting his expression. Then, Hannah Abbott called on Potter.
“I see you’re still here,” he sneered at Harry.
Draco looked up with a small frown. Harry’s smile was encouraging, kind even. “Go on, then,” he said, gesturing at Draco. “What happens?”
Then Harry asked, “Did you just call me baby?”
“You’re doing so well, love. Two things you can smell?”
Harry frowned. Had he heard that right? “What was that?”
“Draco. You’re angry. And upset.”
. “It’s just Ron,” he said, not meeting Draco’s eyes.
, a voice in his head whispered.
“How old are you?” Draco asked, shoving his hands into the pockets of his trousers.
He looked down, his hair falling into his face. The ends of his hair curled in a little, just brushing his high cheekbones. Malfoy raised his head and Harry blinked, trying not to think about how Malfoy’s hair looked like ripples of pale gold. “I came here for a reason,” Malfoy said, choosing his words with care. “I came because you were here.”
“Only because the court said he had to be,” Neville reminded him gently. “It was here or Azkaban.”
“What’s the spell?” he asked. Hermione sat up a little straighter and pushed her sleeves up, pulling her wand from her pocket. She told them to hold out their right hands. Ginny blinked, but slowly complied, raising her hand above the table as if she was moving it through treacle. Hermione bit her lip, reviewed the diagrams on the page, then began to mutter a long incantation that rolled off her tongue like a chant.
“Jesus, you could have at least told me you were okay! It’s been ten bloody years, Draco!”
“Literally or metaphorically?”
“That would be great!” Potter said brightly. “Ginny would really like that.”
“Yes,” he managed to choke out. “I would like that.”
Draco gave him a small smile, his thumbs rubbing gentle circles into the V of Harry’s hips. “Agreed,” he murmured. “But if it doesn’t work, we’re off to France. The Malfoys have a nice little villa in the south. There’s an orchard, bee hives, a couple of goats. Just a small village, no one else for miles.”
Malfoy nodded slowly. “I see,” he murmured. He watched Harry turn and brace his arms against the railing, looking back out again at the city as it rumbled in its sleep. He bit his lip as he joined him, their arms only an inch or so apart. His cologne was intoxicating, and Harry closed his eyes as he breathed it in deep. His next exhale was steadier, more even, despite the way his pulse had started to race. You still don’t trust him, he reasoned, that’s why you’re getting all worked up. Calm down.
“And we are so proud of you, dear,” Molly assured him before turning back to Harry. “Is he – Is he here?”
“’S fine. Was three years ago now.”
Malfoy nodded slowly. “Sure,” he said. “You’ve already saved the wizarding world once, we shouldn’t expect you to keep saving it just to pay the bills.”
Harry raised an eyebrow as he took another bite. Draco waved his own sandwich in the air. “You know, that made you want to… you know.”
Blaise shrugged, his eyes on the glowing embers as they burned low in the grate. “Just a thought,” he said. “But maybe, sometimes, we lie to ourselves because it’s easier than the truth. And, maybe, what you call hate is something else entirely.” Blaise stood up and stretched, his back arching like a cat. His usual easy grin spread across his face as he caught Draco’s eye and added, “I might be wrong. But I think you and my cousin are alike, in more ways than one. Good night, Draco.”
Harry swallowed, but refused to look away or back down. He could feel his magic crackling and sparking at his fingertips and balled his hands into fists against his thighs. The king’s eyes narrowed.
“In the end, Dumbledore did die that year, but not by me. The school fell to the Death Eaters. The Dark Lord lived in our manor, when he wasn’t out seeking more powerful weapons. I could never escape the fact that I had chosen the wrong side, and could do nothing but follow along lest I be killed as well, or worse. Then, there was the final battle. Harry died but came back to life – don’t ask, I don’t know myself – and when he did, he finally killed the Dark Lord. He won the war. At seventeen, he was the saviour of the wizarding world.
“Makes sense. Not that I’ve ever travelled for any reason than to try and defeat Voldemort.” Malfoy flinched at the mention of his name. Harry hesitated, then apologised. “I shouldn’t have mentioned it,” he added. “I’m sure… the name must bring up some pretty nasty memories.”
“What would he have done instead?” Harry asked. Narcissa pursed her lips.
Harry rolled his eyes and nudged Draco with his shoulder. “You don’t know that,” he said. “And you have obviously never met Mrs. Weasley. She’ll only be mad that she didn’t have time to knit you a sweater.”
“We buried him in the family plot at Malfoy Manor last night. Just the two of us. Mother had managed to get everything arranged, but in the end, it was just us.” Draco paused to take a deep, shuddering breath. “I didn’t know what to do, Mother was going to France to stay with family and I – all I could think was that I wanted to be with you.” He buried his face in his hands as he stifled a sob. He swore, bitter and distraught, his shoulders shaking beneath the weight of it. “I never got to say goodbye,” he sobbed, his words muffled by his hands. “I haven’t seen him… in ten fucking years… and now he’s gone….”
They drank the rest of their tea without another word about Malfoy, too wrapped up as they were in discussing the Gryffindor team’s line-up for the upcoming year. But Harry kept thinking of a certain grey-eyed man, and the words they’d exchanged all those years ago…
“No, he’s not!” Harry yelled back. “If you spent even five minutes with him you’d know that!”
Malfoy hummed. “All the time,” he said. “I just got back this morning from Stockholm. I managed to finish all my paperwork early so my boss let me have the weekend off before I go to Morocco next week.” Harry let out a low whistle. Malfoy shrugged. “It’s fine. Used to be more fun. Now I’m just… tired. The work is interesting, and I enjoy it, but it would be nice to be able to stay in the same place for more than a week or two.”
Teddy sniffled. He looked up at Harry, his eyes red-rimmed and puffy. “You guys are really cool with this?” he asked thickly. Harry nodded as Draco murmured, “Of course.”
It was everything Harry could have ever dreamed and more. At Hogwarts, he was safe. He was loved by his godfather and Sirius’s partner, Remus, a werewolf with a kind smile and a penchant for sweets. He had friends, a red-headed sixth son of a hedge witch and a half-wood nymph with a mind to rival the well-read sorcerers in their towers. He had a home… for a time.
Only when they needed to breathe did they pull apart, Harry to mouth along the column of Draco’s neck, Draco to lean his head back against the door with a whispered, “Fuck.” Harry sucked a love bite into the skin just above his collar, and Draco hissed and squirmed beneath him, his hips inadvertently rolling up into Harry’s, making them both moan. Then Harry was scrambling to undo the buttons on Draco’s shirt, and Draco tried to pull Harry’s jumper off, their arms getting tangled and giggling at their own eagerness. Harry, jumper gone, held Draco’s head in his hands and pulled him in, smiling against his lips as Draco’s hands explored warm skin, the curve of his ribcage, the sharp wings of his shoulder blades. He pushed Draco’s shirt from his shoulders, tossing it to the side. Draco frowned.
Malfoy shuffled in, still wearing Harry’s pyjamas, his white-blond hair mussed from sleep. He was halfway through the doorway when he noticed Kellen. He immediately straightened up and tried to look dignified, even with the pillow mark on his cheek and the pyjama bottoms that really were much too short for him. Harry’s stomach fluttered, which he decided he was not a fan of. Must have been too much coffee. He busied himself with the French press with a small frown.
“I cast a Warming Charm on it,” he added as Malfoy took the towel from him with a quiet, “thank you.” “Do you want anything to drink? I could make some tea, or would you like something stronger?”
Draco looked up at him as he sat down with his Guinness. Surprise flashed in his steely eyes. Harry tried to ignore the way his chest tightened.
.” His voice broke, and he slumped forward, burying his sobs in his arms as his whole body shook.
Well, damn. He willed himself to stand up straighter, to school his expression into something more neutral than outright fear. He had opened his mouth to sneer something with enough conviction to persuade her that she was the one at fault, not the other way around, when Harry blurted out,
“You are very cruel, Kellen,” Harry said, wiping tears from his eyes as he straightened up. Kellen tried to catch her breath, angling to face Harry.
Draco’s brow furrowed. “But I want this,” he pouted. His fingers plucked at Harry’s shirt under his grip. “Don’t you?”
It was Neville’s bright idea to draw straws. So one by one, they drew a straw from the bundle Neville conjured, and went about finding their pair. Which was how Draco found himself matching up with Harry ‘Let’s Be Friends’ Potter.
Harry got out of the car, swinging his duffel bag over his shoulder as he followed Ron up to the house. “I’ve always been quiet,” he argued, trying to make his tone good-natured and nonchalant. Ron shook his head again – his flame-red hair needed a cut and stuck out at all angles like he’d never met a comb in his life, not unlike Harry’s own mop of wild curls.
Harry rolled his eyes with a sigh before storming off back to the eighth-year common room. Hermione watched him go, shaking her head a little. “God, he’s hopeless,” she muttered under her breath.
Since there had been so few students returning, Headmistress McGonagall in her infinite wisdom had decided to arrange them based on year rather than House, which was how the seventh and eighth years were relocated to Gryffindor Tower. Draco suspected favouritism. They had been left to their own devices as to how to divide the rooms amongst themselves, with Hermione in charge of organising the girls and Neville of the boys. There were seven rooms and eighteen boys – eight seventh years and ten eighth years. Draco couldn’t help but notice that he was the only Slytherin boy – Daphne and Astoria Greengrass had also returned, but they couldn’t help him in this particular situation. The seventh years had agreed to splitting the first two rooms between them, after almost an hour was spent trying to do the maths, something none of them quite understood. That just left the eighth years and five rooms.
Harry let out a huff and sent Ron another message –
He was sixteen – he was starving but couldn’t eat, exhausted but couldn’t sleep, afraid and crying in a girl’s bathroom because he was going to fail. When Potter’s curse hit him, he wondered if he deserved it.
“Right,” said Harry slowly, taking the Cloak from him and folding it over his arm. He hesitated, then added, “Don’t forget what I said, either. About helping.”
“Parkinson here wanted to throw us a little coming out party,” Harry told him. He crossed his arms with a smirk. “Figured I’d invite you all to come and join.”
“I’m his friend,” Draco replied. This, apparently, was not the correct response.
Kellen paled, her eyes widening. “You’re not actually going to kill each other, are you?” she asked timidly.
“So you really aren’t involved with Ivanovich, then?”
“There you are,” he murmured. Draco rolled his eyes but ducked his head to hide the sappy smile spreading across his face. Harry gave him a quick peck on the cheek before leaning his head back against the headboard with a sigh. “It was just a really nasty nightmare,” he said finally. “Voldemort was killing everyone, but I was Petrified and trapped under the floorboards of the Shrieking Shack. I couldn’t move, couldn’t do anything.” Draco flinched at Voldemort’s name. Harry, noticing, gave him an apologetic look. “Then,” he continued in a hushed tone, “I looked up and there was the Dark Mark, hanging over me, and I knew I was next. I think that’s what set me off the second time, seeing your Mark.”
“Really?” Draco sneered, resuming chopping up the carrot on the cutting board. “You really think people will like a former Death Eater and the girl who wanted to turn Potter over to the Dark Lord showing up at their reunion party?”
“Oh.” Malfoy sat down on the bed, staring down at the wand in his hands. “I didn’t know.”
Once Andromeda had gone in a flash of green flames, Harry made his way towards the kitchen. He paused just outside in the hallway when he heard Teddy and Draco’s chattering voices.
“Like what? You go to the same school?”
“I said, he’s gone now. What does it matter if I didn’t identify him? It doesn’t change anything.”
A wave of white-gold hair fell into Malfoy’s surprised face. Absent-mindedly, Harry pushed it off his forehead, tucking it behind his ear. Malfoy’s blush went from peony pink to a deep scarlet. Harry chuckled again, his hand falling to his side. “You didn’t turn me in, you practically gave me the wands… If I didn’t know any better, Malfoy, I would say you switched sides that day in the Manor.”
Silence fell. Even Teddy was still as he leaned his head against his godfather’s shoulder. Then the boy pulled back and asked, “Does that make him Uncle Draco, then?”
Draco’s jaw dropped.
“Anyway, my cousin is a bit older than me, he’s in his last year of school there, but all his life he and this other boy, David, were always at each other’s throats.” Draco loved the way Blaise put the accent on the ‘i’ –
Draco’s arms tightened around Harry’s waist, and he buried his nose in Harry’s curls. “Okay,” came his muffled response. “Okay.”
“Because when you do it, you’re a bloody menace, but when Hermione does it, she’s a professional. There’s a difference,” he replied. Draco glared at him. Harry rolled his eyes and gave him a quick peck on the cheek as an apology. Draco ducked his head against Harry’s shoulder so that Hermione didn’t have to see him blushing. Hermione, meanwhile, watched their little interaction with a sceptical look, her lips pursed.
“Yeah, are you?”
Harry shook his head, frowning at the carrot he was peeling. “No,” he said, his voice low. “Somehow, I don’t think he will.”
Out in the courtyard, Harry sat on one of the cold stone benches, his knee bouncing as he tried to distract himself by watching the other students mingle. They all looked so young, and yet there was a shadow hanging over them, muting their chatter and laughter in the chill November air. A few simply stood in front of the memorial stone set in the middle of the courtyard, reading the names of all that had fallen in the Battle. Harry huddled in his jacket as he tapped his fingers against the edge of the bench. Over a year later, he could still recite every name on that list.
“Potter.” Malfoy licked his lips, suddenly unsure. “I don’t know what to say.”
“We have a gala to go to, remember?” Draco chastised. Harry shrugged.
“Why not?” Harry asked, jaw set but voice soft. “Why can’t you give this – give us, one more try? We can make it work, do long-distance if you want.”
The priest let him compose himself, let him stifle the sobs and tears, let him breathe.
Draco rubbed at his eyes with a small chuckle, trying to stop the tears flooding down his cheeks. “Malfoys don’t apologise,” he mumbled. He lowered his hand. Had Potter been that close before? His breath stuttered in his chest as his shaky smile faltered.
“Hey,” Harry interrupted him, scooting forward so that he sat on the edge of his chair, his knees brushing Draco’s bare ones where the bathrobe had fallen open. “Hey. Don’t be sorry about anything that happened last night. I – I wanted it to happen. Not like that, obviously, not after your father – but I’ve been wanting to kiss you for ages and just never knew until last night that that was what I wanted, does that make sense?”
“I am alright, thank you, Weasley,” Draco said politely. He turned to the other boys behind them with the same stiff, polite smile. “Thank you all, as well.”
“No!” Ron bellowed. “You stay right there where I can see you!”
“Should probably get through this Victoire business first, though,” Draco added, patting Teddy’s knee. “Just like repotting a Mandrake. The sooner you get it over with, the better.”
Draco let out a small breath of a laugh. “Yeah, it is, but it’s fine. Let’s try this again, shall we? What’s your name?”
Always the Gryffindor. Or maybe, Draco wondered as he narrowed his eyes at the other boy, he was hiding a truth. Either way, Hannah didn’t seem to care.
“Did she?” Andromeda asked, hopeful even as her voice broke with the tears she held back. “I’m sorry we have to meet like this, but my sister and I…” She trailed off, her voice choked. Draco nodded, the tightness in his smile softening sadly.
“Focus, Malfoy.” Harry knew he should have smiled and laughed at Malfoy’s obvious attraction – he had a similar reaction, after all, when he first met Humphries, only to find out that Humphries was as straight as they get. Instead, something ugly twisted in his gut, sharp and hot like a burning poker. He stamped it down hard and sat down across from Malfoy. Malfoy, who had still been staring after Humphries, finally tore his gaze away and focused his attention on Harry. A small crease formed between his brows as he registered Harry’s expression.
“Don’t be daft,” said Ron, leaning his chair back on two legs. “I’ve known you and Harry since you were eleven, and we’ve been mates since Harry dragged you to that pub quiz ages ago. He might be oblivious, but that smile right then told me all I need to know.” He took another bite, then said around a mouthful of bread, “You’re smitten.”
“Just go with it, Malfoy,” she told him. “You can’t outrun Harry when he has his mind set.” Draco, who had barely talked to Hermione all term, considered her with narrowed eyes.
“Hey,” he murmured, putting one hand on Teddy’s knee. “You know that we love you no matter what, right? You could kill someone and we would hide the body.”
Harry blushed furiously. “I’m not that small,” he mumbled, taking a long drink of his whiskey to avoid Draco’s gaze.
“As far as you know, had they recently had any other visitors? Any odd messages?” Harry asked. Wilkins cocked his head in thought.
Harry bit his lip to contain his grin, and Draco’s eyes narrowed.
“Malfoy.”
Next week, Harry and Hermione would present their case to the Wizengamot, but tonight was their first battle. Harry was taking Draco to the Ministry’s New Year’s Eve gala, not as a ‘friend’, but as his date. Which was probably why Draco had spent the past few days stressing over his outfit, and two hours getting ready.
Draco sniffed, wiped at the tears pricking at his eyes. “That’s not an option,” he mumbled.
“I know!” Harry called back with glee. Draco threw up his hands, but couldn’t suppress his grin. He’d get him back one day.
Harry let out a scoffing laugh and ducked his head. “You have no idea,” he said with a crooked smile. “I didn’t know there was a word for how I felt, or that it was different from everyone else. I thought….” He swiped at his eyes with his free hand, looked away to hide the tears threatening to slip down his cheeks. He let out a shaking breath. Draco squeezed his hand, waited for Harry to speak. “When I realised,” Harry continued in a broken whisper, “that I – my experience wasn’t normal, I was convinced there must be something wrong, that maybe being a Horcrux for so long had damaged me somehow. But Hermione assures me that it’s perfectly normal.” He frowned at their joined hands, threaded his fingers through Draco’s and held tight.
Father Nicola shrugged one shoulder, his eyes on Harry and the elderly woman as Harry tried, weakly, to explain that he wasn’t her nephew, even as she beat his arm with her purse, demanding to know why he didn’t visit more often. “Many people in our world believe in him, too,” Father Nicola said at last. “It’s easy to worship an idol.”
“Milk and sugar?” Harry asked, setting the teapot down. Malfoy’s shoulders relaxed.
“Night, Scar-head.”
“Er, no, sir,” Harry replied. He felt Draco squeeze his hand behind the door, and he squeezed back reassuringly. “There’s just someone here who needs to talk to you, sir. Right away.”
They grinned at each other, revelling in the ease of their banter. Back in the day, they would have decked each other by now. Harry came over to where Draco stood braced against the counter near the stove and hopped up to perch on the counter beside him. This way, he was at eye level with Draco, even as he kicked his ankles against the cabinet drawers behind him. Draco rolled his eyes and called him a heathen. Harry only smiled.
“Then you won’t have a son.”
“And are you?” Draco asked, glancing at Harry out of the corner of his eye. “Doing well?”
When they reached the stone gargoyle guarding Dumbledore’s office, Draco was surprised how easily Harry gave the password. He raised his eyebrows at the smaller boy, who shrugged.
Draco, intrigued, approached Potter, leaning against the balustrade next to him. Potter looked up and gave him a smile, handing over the parchment.
“Beer, if they have it. Thanks.”
Draco blinked at him for a moment. “Hi?” he echoed in disbelief. “You disappear for a year, and all you’ve got is ‘hi’?” When Harry shrugged, Draco let out a hollow chuckle and leaned his head back against the wall to stare at the peeling ceiling. “How was London?” he asked.
“It’s almost six thirty.”
Harry flicked his wand at the antique dresser below the window and it waddled in front of the grate, obstructing it from view. Then he went about pulling an old cot bed out from under the four poster and setting it up at the end of the bed. “I’m going to go and get a pillow and some sheets and get ready,” he said once the cot had clicked into place. “I’ll set up wards around the room when I’m back – in addition to the ones on the house,” he added when Malfoy looked like he was going to interrupt. “And in the morning, the other Auror working the case will come by to take your statement. We’ll go over your protection plan then. Alright?”
