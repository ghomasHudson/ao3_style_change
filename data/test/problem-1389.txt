Isabelle shook her head. “Jessie must have flipped back. If he didn’t have numbers, he’d never have flaunted it tonight so publically.”
“I doubt he’ll have an opinion either way,” Harry replied, shaking his head as he conjured bunches of ferns in the tank. “There, it’s all done. Are you putting him in?”
The rest of the day was, in the best way Draco could describe it, odd. There were moments of tranquility, where they sat alone and soaked in their first moments of privacy in 39 days. There were also tense, awkward periods, where everyone faced away from each other, entirely lost in their own heads. There were moments of levity, of laughter and relief. Sundown arrived both excruciatingly slowly and in the blink of an eye.
“We’ve had quite a lot of strange things happen over the last few weeks,” Draco added, putting the tank down on Hagrid’s kitchen table. “Things being broken around the house, not to mention being broken in other people’s houses or my office here. Harry ending up in the hospital was the final straw.”
He lifted her, aided by the waist-deep tide, and set her down gently on the nearest shelf of dryland, a rounded boulder around the corner of the peninsula.
I’ll see you tomorrow, and I’m looking forward to it. But please, don’t insinuate again that you have to ply me with sweets. Consolation prizes would only make sense if they were given to me for not spending time with you. Whenever you say such things I get angry with how your aunt and uncle, Dumbledore, and our whole society treated you. They abused you and treated you as a means to an end. You deserve to feel loved, and you deserve to believe that someone cherishes every moment they get to spend with you.
Draco keeps it measured and intense for as long as he can. He can feel every twitch, every pull, every moment of delicious friction and heat and compression. “Beautiful,” he breathes. “Perfect.”
There were only two votes not cast for Jessie: one for Harry and one for Jones. Jessie looked as shocked as everyone else. Clearly CJ had not tipped her off, but she smiled gratefully, nodding when CJ whispered ‘Jones.’
Ed still got voted out seven to two (and Tara and Ed hadn’t even voted for the same person), but the bickering that occurred prior was enough to impress even Jeff. Ed called Ian a ‘nincompoop’ and announced that he was ‘the best prosecutor in the state,’ and he was ‘playing as if the other contestants were defendants.’ Ian called Ed a ‘sad old man who’s convinced himself he’s hot shit because he can’t face that his existence is one long mid-life crisis.’
Harry cast a few light diagnostic spells over the stone. “Yeah, it doesn’t appear to be letting off an aura. Usually, magical objects create static in the air, but this one isn’t. I can feel that it has a magical core, but it feels dormant or disconnected somehow.”
Desdemona likes her charm. She flies in circles around the sunroom to watch it reflect pink and gold against the glass. It is quite amusing. Thank you so much; you have gifted us with a small joy in a very large, empty house.
He shook Harry awake while Claire laid out the food and set the skillet to heat. “Rise and shine, love,” he whispered.
It was decided that Harry would be both the rope thrower and the first out on the obstacles and that Ian would retrieve the deepest rope, but by the time Jeff called them to regroup, Draco hadn’t spoken another word.
When he catches a glimpse of silver-blond on the dance floor, it’s a blessing in disguise. Draco Malfoy, 19 and haunted, is a vision, and Harry shakes his head to clear the mirage. It doesn’t fade. Malfoy’s face just gets clearer as he nears, his mouth pinching into a scowl through the waves of glimmering heat and fog-machine smoke.
“Yeah…” Harry said faintly, turning back to the tank and getting to work on the habitat. “If you say so.”
Tribal was quick, as even Jeff was inclined to put a shaking, hyperventilating Jessie out of her misery.
Yesterday was a disaster. I’m so sorry. I don’t know if I can forgive myself. I didn’t want to hurt you. That house brings out the worst in me. A stronger man would have been able to resist. Clinically, you are probably smart enough to understand.
The tension in the room melted away, and Harry put a hand on Draco’s arm. The only person who hadn’t flipped was Marissa. He supposed they would worry about her later.
By 1999, I had regained strength to the point where, besides chronic night terrors and frequent episodes of anxious triggers and hyperventilation, I felt almost normal.
“Very thoughtful of you,” Draco smiled as he straightened up again. “He’ll fit right in, don’t you worry.”
Draco sent him a confident smirk. “Oh? It’s a turn-off, you say?” he snickered, earning himself a glare.
“What was it like growing up here?” he asked, after they had needed to shift with the sun twice. “The Pureblood English are all propriety and parliament and parties and really, really bad ideology.”
Draco pulled Isabelle aside. Her face was stoic as ever, but he could tell she was upset. Dependability and logic were what she prided herself on, and she felt like an utter fraud. He pulled her in for a hug. The silver lining, he told her, was that everyone knew it had not been her fault. In the end, the emotions she was feeling, while valid, would not be impacting their game; the fact that Doug had made a fool of himself very well could. All they had to do was play it right.
Jessie stepped up, the penultimate to speak, standing in fresh makeup and a sundress with her hands clasped behind her back. “Claire, you decided to vote for Harry last night, despite the fact that you knew Draco was voting for me and it would force a tie. Why did you do this?”
“Oh, you can’t possibly still be upset about this morning,” Potter quipped after a moment of studying Draco’s face.
Harry blinked slowly, squeezing his eyes closed again as they registered the blinding white light that surrounded him.
There would be no more Immunities, no more Idols, no more devil-in-disguise Rewards, no more niceties or passive aggression. This was it; whoever won this challenge would be going to the final.
If you require any more details, please let me know. You already know far more about me than all but my immediate family, and I suppose if I am in for a knut, I need also be in for a galleon.
Neville laughs, hand on his belly as he doubles over. “Trust me,” he says. “You’ve still got plenty to do.” Draco has the niggling sensation that he’s being mocked.
What else could I have done?” A clump of mud fell onto Harry’s shoulder, and his brown skin blended into the grey of the background.
Life, in general, was good. Survivor had been an adventure, an alternate reality where they had been deconstructed to their most base instincts and ideals, but it had also been particularly unsustainable. A game show, a research project, and a marriage were too many plotlines for even Draco’s rather sophisticated mind to keep track off. Fucking and getting fucked was much more fun.
?” Draco whispered, awe and wonderment clear in the wide shape of his eyes and the stiff way in which his posture had shifted.
The boat ride to the beach was lively, everyone pleased with their challenge performance and pushing to get to know each other. Potter was speaking to the surfer-looking fellow (who was indeed born and raised in San Diego) and a hulking bloke that looked to be about 7-feet tall (he vaguely remembered Harry whispering into his ear about him being some sort of sports star).
Harry checks over his shoulder, recognizing the man from earlier. He rolls his eyes. “He’s eying you up.”
“Well, it seems like he had some kind of enchantment over him,” Hagrid replied, shrugging. “Couple of hours after you left, there was a flash and then he was this big. Must have been charmed to come off when he was happy. Turns out he’s some kind of oriental toad. Some Muggles see them and get a bit spooked, but most other Muggles don’t believe them. It’s only magical folk who get to see the real toads. ”
“Jones,” he said, keeping his nose pointed at the ground and avoiding eye-contact-- the man had made it crystal clear he had very little respect for Draco. “You can’t predict what Jessie will do. She’s proven how volatile she can be. But you can trust Harry, Iz, and I. We’ve got no power in the minority. Use us.”
Draco laughed, a goofy, proud grin spreading over his face. “See, there is a little bit of Slytherin left in you.”
Draco’s mouth fell open in awe and he pushed away from Harry to get a better look. “When did you find this!” he exclaimed, and Harry, hands still around Draco’s waist, shrugged, donning that crooked smile that made Draco weak at the knees.
“After our challenge performance today, maybe we ought to start looking for that Idol again,” she said.
“Radical!” Draco purrs. He pulls Harry towards the small booth, whispering something incomprehensible in his ear. Harry makes a choked off noise, nodding vigorously. Fred and Jason look at each other quizzically, shrugging.
Harry skips dinner in the Great Hall. It would have been uncomfortably intimate-- not many people are here. After all, it is only June. For most, it is too soon after the war to be returning to the castle. For others, it is far too late. The few professors and alums who have come to rebuild the rubble are the ones who are stuck in Purgatory.
Motivation released, Draco let his muscles go slack. He fell, body tilting backwards away from the pole and towards the sand. Landing with a cry, he lay face up, eyes opening directly into the harsh rays of the sun. He gasped, wind knocked out of him and limbs entirely numb.
Marissa proved a tough egg to crack. She was bland, but it turned out she wasn’t nearly as aloof as she came across. Draco wished she had shown this kind of attention span when he had been bored to tears from talking to her two weeks prior. Apparently, she just found other human beings unworthy of putting work into.
The rowdy brass of a jazz band dances off the crystals of a chandelier, the beads of condensation on heavy glasses of liquor, the sequins on a flowing curtain. The club is large, but it feels cramped in the red-tinted darkness. Harry sits in the far back on an ostentatious baroque stool, balancing nervously. He takes a hesitant sip of the daiquiri a waiter had urged into his hand-- peach and lime and, honestly, rather horrible. He feels confused, uncomfortable, and impatient all at the same time. On one hand, there are far too many exposed breasts for his liking. On the other, he is starting to have a sneaking suspicion of what Draco had meant when he had asked Harry to attend his ‘recital’.
I need help, badly. I can only assume that my issues stem from deep-set trauma that occurred in the placement, hosting, and removal of Tom Riddle’s Horcrux on my soul, but I am long past the point of believing I could search for answers on my own. I cannot sleep, as I lose total authority over my magical impulses when I do. I cannot eat, because there is a constant buzzing inside of me that would make even the most seasoned of pirates queasy. Even when I do manage to rest or keep down food, magic strips any sliver of vitality I have managed to regain. My mental state and emotional well-being have suffered as well, although I do not know if that is a direct symptom of my magic
I suppose you will likely require further convincing as to why a professional such as yourself should have time or interest to spare on the dissection of a single man, and so I will briefly summarize my afflictions below.
A minty, spicy scented ground cover grows over the sharp gravel pathways, soft enough to walk on without shoes. The paths wind around the central water feature, skirting the back of the courtyard. The townhouse yard is really quite small, but, filled with birdsong and new growth, one gets the sense that they have entered a microcosm of Eden. In Draco and Harry’s garden, everything else fades to the background.
It turns out that gardens require an infuriatingly specific set of parameters, and Draco writes them down until his hand cramps. Special soil, raised beds, charms to manage water flow, angles of sun exposure, walkways-- the list goes on. Sighing, he stretches out his fingers and grabs another scrap of parchment.
She began to climb, pinching the porous bulges in the rock and testing each ledge before she stepped on it. “Are you--” Draco started, but thought better of it. He would probably do the same, if only out of curiosity.
Harry gave them turquoise. It was for the best; there was no point adjusting to a new camp. Isabelle drew turquoise, too, as did Ian. Tara was already yanking an orange bandana over her head, the garish colour clashing horribly with her straw-like hair. Draco breathed a sigh of relief.
He pushes up on his toes easily, pressing his palm into the underside of a broad sloper and matching with his opposite index finger. Grinning smugly, he carefully descends the down-climb jugs, hopping two-footed onto the mats.
Just as soon as it starts, the rain stops, and Draco collapses, magically, physically, and emotionally drained. The charm dissipates with a snap and the final few drops of the storm hit him in the back of the neck.
Draco sets the table long before any guests arrive, just for an excuse to go outside. The garden is ethereal under summer blue skies, wild and ever-changing and teeming with life. It’s a fractal; no matter how close one looks, there is always another layer. More than once, Draco’s thought he’s spotted fairies-- not the ones he knows, but the kind from muggle children’s tales.
Draco is dressed in heeled leather boots, black jeans, and a forest green underbust bustier that manages to appear both dainty and intimidating. The fabric is a silky translucent mesh, adorned with embroidered snakes that twist with the curve of his body. Although only a strip of skin between his solar plexus and the top-most line of his abs is covered, the garment’s clean lines highlight Draco’s trim waist and flexed pecs. The boning and hems are wrapped in satin, and it gleams under the stage lights. The moody burlesque-club atmosphere does wonders for every muscle, every movement. Harry wants to
This something happened upon arrival for the Day 21 morning Reward Challenge. Rather than large constructions of green and orange, eleven neat, multi-coloured structures lined the edge of a clear-cut gap in the jungle. Draco’s nerves bunched; not only was the merge about to happen, but there would be a challenge, and likely a vote, immediately after. First impressions were going to be everything.
The challenge was a classic, and one of Draco’s all-time favorites. The individual structures were similar to marble mazes, with metal tracks that a ball rolled down, twisting and swirling several times. At the center, there was a split, and a simple mechanical switch caused the direction the ball turned to alternate every other run.
Draco kisses the frown from Harry’s face, deep and long. It feels like when his fingers close over the top of the wall, like when his legs swing out in the heart-stopping moment when he’s not sure if he’s going to hold a dyno, like the second before he rolls to his back after falling.
He leapt into Harry’s arms, wrapping his hands around his lower back and dragging them towards the sofa. Spinning them around, he forced Harry down and backwards, straddling his lap and diving to devour his mouth. The towel slipped off in the ferality of his movements.
This is likely a magico-endocrinological and magico-psychological effect of PTSD. Basically, your hormones read every little excitement as a dangerous crisis, and respond with fight or flight. One could say that your magic didn’t get the message that you are safe, and mistakes little everyday excitements for deadly danger. The vertigo and weakness after the War were your magico-physiological response to having been a horcrux and having been freed from the piece of Voldemort’s soul. You have recovered from it, and while your core is scarred, all connections have regrown.
He leans over the railing of the Astronomy Tower, eyes on the fuzzy treetops that distort the horizon. Hogwarts is the only place where dawn and twilight look the same; slate and periwinkle with wisps of mauve and clementine. The open, the close; they taste the same.
Upon return, the tribe had spiraled into pandemonium. The fire burned a little too brightly, and Draco sensed the buzz of Harry’s magic in the flying sparks. He looked ready to explode. Jones and Isabelle were caught in a heated argument, a purple blush rising on her cheeks, and Jones’s brittle retorts were punctuated with an ugly, toothy grin.
Harry looked ready to speak again, but Draco cut him off. “Oh my god is that a starfruit tree?” he said, snapping back to alertness.
I have always been a sentimental person, and this has only been magnified in my adult life. My most effective coping mechanisms to date involve channeling my magic into objects or places of intense emotional significance. For instance, I almost always carry with me a scarf that belonged to my mother. It is essentially a security blanket, but I also circuit magical energy through it as a sort of resistor to slow the speed of the current, and therefore force, that my body creates. This is very inefficient and exhausting, and tends to leave me weak and tired, but it creates a controlled plane that my magical signature can interact with.
The conductor ushers him onto the train, reaching to place his hand on Harry’s back at the top of the stairs as he has done for every student since they were 11. At the last second, he thinks better of it. Harry paces the hallway at an unsteady trot, a manic twitch in his temple exposing itself each time he leans to check the occupancy of the cabins. He trips on a crease in the carpet, catching himself heavily, and a wave of adrenaline rushes through him, hot and twitchy. It sounds like an avalanche in his brain.
To give you an answer to your most burning question, I can’t fix you, but I can and would be glad to help you work on healing your magic, if you trust me to do so. While studying your case may be interesting, I don’t see you as a phenomenon, but as a person. And believe it or not, I want the man who got me out of the burning Room of Hidden Things and then spared me from spending a life in Azkaban to live and thrive.
He lands heavily in the foyer of his London townhouse and suppresses a rolling wave of nausea, tossing his book bag and coat on the couch and striding towards the door. He swings it open with a thought, eyes roving across the porch. “Neville?” he calls.
The screen door is open, and Draco freezes. The yard doesn’t look like much-- just a plat of soil crisscrossed with gravel pathways-- but for not looking like much, it’s
Harry paces through the 7th floor corridor, down and back again, down and back. Malfoy watches. Harry imagines laughing until his stomach cramps and his face turns blue. He imagines his eyes squinty with insistent, jubilant tears, his mind high and floaty and unencumbered. He imagines the black lake at night, and a stag running across it. He imagines a warm body beside him. With a puff of multicolored smoke, a creamsicle-orange door appears in the empty baroque wallpaper, giving the illusion that it was always there, and that Harry had simply chosen not to see it.
Jeff greeted them with a winning cheese, but as he launched into the rules and requirements, Harry leaned to whisper in Draco’s ear.
BONUS QUESTION! Comment your answer below and the first to get it right will receive a drabble of their choice after reveals.
Draco is soaked to the bone, dirt caked to his knees and mud dripping down his temple from where he has pushed his hair out of his eyes with a filthy hand over and over again.
His pail filled slowly, and then a little bit faster as he learned the motions, only to slow again as he grew increasingly winded. It was a strangely anticlimactic challenge for a final.
Harry slid down one peg on the pole, and Draco smiled in triumph. “Flirtation? Never. Just pushing buttons.”
There was a valiant attempt to vote Jones out, but an idol play later Ian was gone and the alliance of everyone-vs-the-devil was short a soldier. Draco sat criss-cross-applesauce in the grass beside Isabelle, the delicate skin of his thighs itching furiously where it pressed into the ground and pollen had prompted hives to form.
Harry cast a strong cleansing charm over both of them, and the unpleasant stickiness of salt and grime disappeared from Draco’s skin. “We’ve got better things to do,” he whispered into Draco’s ear.
The gym is completely empty, and gauzy, smog-shrouded stars filter through the skylight. It’s past 3am on a summer morning, but their membership comes with a 24hr door-code.
The challenge commenced with a shout and a cheer, and Isabelle dove gracefully into the sea, reappearing seconds later with a heavy ball connected to a length of green nylon. A ring with a key on it slid downwards towards where the rope was secured to the dock and Tara scrambled to unclip it with clumsy fingers.
It was not until the following year that my magic began to go into overdrive. It started as a slow progression in my ability to master wandless or wordless incantations but evolved over several months into bouts of accidental magic.
I hope that we can get to know each other-- I cannot let this relationship be built on obligation. You do not owe me anything. Nobody owes me anything. The world doesn’t work like that; we just think it does. If you feel you have a debt to pay, visit the cemetery. I’m done letting gratitude and guilt and idolization and all the rest of the damn roses and thorns by any other name rule my interactions.
The door chimed with a lively melody at half past, and Harry opened it for Parvati, Lavender, and the twins, Rhea and Nikhil, who were best friends with Rose. Lavender’s dress was printed with strawberries and peaches, and her golden hair was piled into a bun atop her head. Parvati’s arms were wrapped around Lavender’s neck as she told Harry they planned to spend an all-day date exploring a farm and nursery that sold rare ingredients to their tea shop.
“He’s just a little toad,” Hagrid said fondly, lifting the lid off and putting a hand into the tank to pick the toad up. “He’ll be fine here.”
You’ve been a reprieve from all that makes me suffer, a lick of hope and normalcy. It is ironic, perhaps, as you are my healer, and you’ve seen so much of how my story began. I now have to reconcile the person I am-- and have been, for years-- alone, and the person I am with you. Maybe it is not a bad thing.
I really appreciate you stating outright that you enjoy my company. I have come to enjoy yours as well. I tend to be a little oblivious and assume the worst-- at least that’s what Hermione told me yesterday, but I can tell that your beliefs have changed fundamentally. It gives me hope. The world is a cruel, cruel place. I had stopped believing that it was possible to learn who we were.
“I don’t even know what to do with you. This is a gym. My friends man the front-desk. I come every day after work.”
A crunch of boots on glass is what gives Malfoy away. He is stooped at the foot of a crumbling arcade, wand in hand, breathing fast and laboured but eerily quiet.
“I don’t know,” Jason says after a moment of deliberation. “I’m pretty sure I made splatter paintings like this as a kid.”
I’ve sat down every Wednesday night since we got a telly to watch this thing. Just because you always fall asleep doesn’t mean it’s not worthwhile. This is my
With a gasp, he burst back into wakefulness. “Harry, it’s exactly the same! If the stones were used to channel the energy of the Ley Lines into magic that could be used, I would have been able to feel those hundreds of years of curses affecting it because the spells would have been interacting with magic from the stone. Instead, it’s the exact same as the other one. These stones aren’t harnessing Ley Lines, they’re way more stable than that. The magic is old and varied, but it isn’t loose. I guess that’s why we haven’t been able to get them to react before. It almost feels like they
“Jeff, darling, I’m good at everything,” he retorted with a saccharin drawl, curling his lips with a self-satisfied sneer.
“I like a hot momma, and it’s not like she has anything to compare him to. I might blow her mind,” she had smirked.
“Er--” Draco pauses to wonder when Harry became so attuned to his life. “There was a mistake with the order. Now there’s a new one.”
Beyond the shore, a sweeping view of the castle looms over them, warm light filtering through windows. In the dusky night, lit by the remnants of a sunset to the west and a rising moon to the East, it is difficult to make out the destruction. The crumbling, unlit wings of the castle fade into the shadows. The ragged wounds in the sides of pews are smoothed over.
Casting a light glamour to hide the still-irritated skin, he helped her to her feet, cringing as the scar sunk beneath the salty, lapping waves. He observed closely as she took a first step and then another, checking her face for pain.
Neville waves away the apology. “No, no, I was just taking a look at your shrubbery. Lovely specimen-- was it here when you bought the place?”
Draco felt like he was losing control. His sense-of-being was centered in his mind; it was the only thing he trusted without a doubt. With no way to measure his sanity, though, he quickly became frustrated and frightened.
Heaping carts of rich, dark dirt and stacks of two-by-fours line the fence, a wheelbarrow filled with ornamental granite stones and gravel next to them. The dying grass has been torn out, the few existing scraggly shrubs and trees uprooted and preserved under stasis in buckets.
All at once, a horde of production assistants leap into action, dragging the host backstage for a quick-change. Draco Malfoy, 4th season returning cast member and first-year head writer, is already in costume. His white-blond hair has been covered by a shoulder-length brown wig, and he wears a pin-stripe button-down untucked and unbuttoned down to his solar plexus. The trousers are patchwork, waist low and crotch lower, loose but cinching just above the lacing of black combat boots. It’s a look.
“They’re very organic, not really curses at all,” Harry said. “It’s almost as if the magic in the atmosphere just created a shell over time all by itself. Clearly there is something in the stone that caused magical potential to shift. This must be why the people left; there was a barrier around the Rai stone, and they couldn’t interact with it without it blasting half the village.”
Sleep came fitfully, as it often did amid change, and so Draco was already half awake when the screaming started. For the gruffness of his speaking voice, Jones screeched like a girl, high pitched and maniacal. He shed his blanket and vaulted to his feet in blind desperation, unfazed when his head clunked against the bamboo scaffolding as he leapt from the cot. He ran until he hit the water, dunking his head beneath the waves and scratching at his scalp with snaggled nails. The rest of the camp watched in horror.
“Okay,” Draco says. “Okay.” The hand leaves Harry’s hair, and he can hear the dull hum of drawer tracks as Draco searches for lube.
And so, when Draco had brought it up the first time, Harry had been glad, albeit surprised (and a little quick to judge). Merlin, though: he had had no idea what he was in for.
Draco swung sedately on the low-hanging linen hammock, one leg slung over the side and head cocooned in the folds. They had cooked the remainder of their rice for an early dinner, and he was savouring his last scrap of peace and quiet for the afternoon. At any moment, his time was to become a very hot commodity.
, Harry. Also, there aren’t any resorts close enough to the stones for apparition. This was the most viable option. You heard Hermione.”
The burns have already healed, and, Harry, our appointment on Tuesday stands (if you feel too out of sorts to come to the office, I can come to you), unless you don't want to see me again after you’ve read the rest of this letter.
Draco smiled as he put his wand down and replaced the lid of the tank. “There. I think he looks happy too. Should we head back to the school then? It’s almost dinner time.”
Draco snickers, and a high, frustrated flush rises on Harry’s chiseled shoulders and structured cheekbones.
Harry began to shake his head before wincing. “No. The last thing I remember was going upstairs with you.”
Draco disappears within the booth, now obscured from the audience. He rustles the curtain for a moment deliberately as he goes. Within, Bill Hader stands against the wall of the set. He hands Draco a mostly empty bottle of KY jelly silently. Draco shakes it close to the mic on his chest, loud enough for the audience to hear, before squeezing some out with a squelch. Bill giggles into his hands.
I have always wanted your attention. At Hogwarts I would pick fights with you because I couldn’t interpret my feelings. You know that I was a prat raised to believe he would get everything on a silver platter just because his name was Malfoy.
Harry’s laughs with his whole body. It feels nice-- so nice, the vibrations soothing and jubilant. Draco feels a wet kiss being pressed to his jaw.
He leads them from landing to landing a step at a time. He doesn’t know where they’re going, but he trusts that it’s right.
I’m sending you a copy of the Prongs’ manuscript and a Muggle book about ADHD. ADHD is not your main problem, but I can see that your aunt and uncle’s way of treating you for it contributed to your trauma.
“Alright, is that big enough, do you think?” Harry asked, stepping back from the table slightly. The tank now occupied a space that was the length of the table and almost as wide. It was three times taller than it had been originally.
“She told us we should gun for you. She thinks you need to go,” Isabelle replied calmly. They and Jessie had simply been doing the dishes.
BONUS QUESTION! The first to get it right will receive a drabble (about anything!) from me post-reveals.
“Oh,” Draco says uncomfortably. “Well, then what am I supposed to do? He goes on and on about how he wished he had a proper yard. This isn’t much of one right now, without any greenery.”
He nodded in agreement, rising to his feet and shifting his things on the drying rack so the other side faced the sun. “To be fair, I don’t think today's challenge was representative of our physical prowess,” he responded.
Harry nodded, giving Draco a sympathetic look. “I think we do, yes. When we go back up to the school tomorrow, I think we should speak to Hagrid about him. He might be able to help.”
“Well, of course I’ll have him here,” Hagrid said, leaning over to peer into the tank. “I’m not sure I’ve got the right set up though.”
Isabelle undid the wrappings, squealing as the heavy pendant landed in her palm. She snatched a parchment from where it had fallen at their feet. “
It took nearly an hour but Harry dismantled the booby-trap curses one by one, first by making them visible with a charm that conjured dust that reacted to magical fields, and then by severing the web of spells patch by patch.
Jeff gestured to the Jury. “Thank you, Draco. Now that the finalists have spoken, I will open the floor to the Jury. Marrisa, would you like to begin?”
Draco woke with a start to the shrill screech of a starling. For a moment, he was singularly aware of an insistent throbbing that radiated through his head and down his body, twinging where the unforgiving stalks of bamboo had bruised his hips and ribs. It was only when he opened his eyes that he realized things were not quite right.
“It’s whatever it wants to be. I think it’s crystal clear already that this night has taken the reins for itself.” In Harry’s head, it sounds terribly poetic, but he’s sure it’s not.
Uncertainty flitted across Harry’s face, turning down his jaw and causing his eye to dance from one side of the room to the other. “I am deeply interested in people. As a police officer, I wanted to meet others from all different walks of life in unfamiliar and uncomfortable situations and interact with them. I feel I went through a lot of emotional growth during this game, and I enjoyed challenging myself physically, emotionally, and socially.”
“Maybe. Limestone isn’t found anywhere else near here. Guam, I think, but I’ve never heard of a Ley Line being there. The limestone could have special properties. Like, the molecular structure could have tiny pockets that are perfectly suited for holding magic. Same theory as Stonehenge or the hole in the stones, but repeated millions of times throughout the rock. And the magical energy wouldn't ever refract out because it’s enclosed on all sides. These caves are close enough to the surface of the Ley Lines that bits of magic bounce off and get stuck in them, and then they just stay there.
To manipulate another person’s dreams and to prey on their fears was cruel, and the Harry Draco knew was never cruel. They were thirty-- five years too old to call that sort of behavior honour. He had seen far too much to excuse suffering. He needed time to think and time to forgive.
“The castle magic. It reacts to whimsy. The way it bent to us— it wouldn’t do that if there wasn’t—you know.”
“When I do share myself though, I am all in. Rather than finding acquaintances in everyone, I naturally look to form close bonds with a few. I am deeply invested in what I care about.
They end up in the kitchens, and Harry kisses Winky on the ear while Draco begs her for pudding. He should have known that pudding would end up smeared across his naked chest in the Slytherin Common Room.
Under normal circumstances, he would have felt confident coming out of a tribe with one extra member, but with Jones more than likely to flip, dodge, and betray, it was pressing for Draco to prove he could be loyal and open-minded. They were reaching the point in the game where a moment of intimidation, standoffish-ness, or apparent secrecy could give him the boot. He would have to further play down his relationship with Iz and Harry, and he needed to keep the Idol absolutely under wraps.
I can see part of your magic’s condition already from the state in which your letter reached me. It gave both the owl and me quite a fright. Your owl hadn’t even reached the perch on my desk when the letter pulled itself from the fastening and sped towards me. I assumed it was cursed and tried to block it, but it dodged my spells and rushed towards my face even faster. When I braced myself and tried to protect my eyes, it flew into my hand, fluttering almost like a Snitch. A powerful tendril of magic, intense enough to be visible without an Energiam Videre charm, came out of it, and I thought it would attack me, but it just touched my cheek, soft as a caress.
If I miss my appointment with you on Tuesday, at least I can say I reached out. If I do come, and you aren’t there, I suppose I can say I tried.
Draco had known the second they had arrived. A Reward Challenge with no challenge in sight could only mean one thing. He nudged Harry. “We need to stay on the same tribe. Can you see what colours they are wandlessly?” Harry nodded.
2) It broke my heart to read you talking about “leeching off” your family. I may not always have thought well of the Weasleys and of Ms. Granger, but I know very well that they take good care of their own and that they love you as if you had been born into their family.
A charged particle enters a magnetic field at a constant rate. There are no forces on it besides that of the magnetic field. What happens to the particle?
They landed with a sicking jolt that had them crashing to the ground. Draco’s vision spun out of focus as he struggled to keep track of his body parts. It felt like stepping off a roller coaster with food poisoning.
“Let’s try not to get too persnickety,” he said. “Just share where we think our strengths are and designate roles before Jeff calls time.”
Harry laughed, throwing his head back cheekily. “Apparition always hurts. What’s another 300 miles?”
Fragrant leaves hung above Draco’s head, lining the walls of the auditorium. A sea of faces stretched from the lip of the stage, anticipation palpable in the air. Behind him, the remainder of the cast sat poised on the edge of their seats. On the left, he held tight to Claire’s hand. On the right, he linked his elbow with Harry’s.
Later that day, after the last class had let out, Harry and Draco left the school and headed to their new home – a small cottage on the outskirts of Hogsmeade. The close proximity to Hogwarts had been part of the appeal, with them both having taken up teaching positions. Harry was the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, and Draco had followed the career path that Harry had always imagined he would and become Potions Master. They’d been teaching at the school for a couple of years before finally getting together, and it had been another year or so more before they’d felt ready to move in with one another.
When he pulled himself back into bed less than 10 minutes later, he didn’t even try to feign nonchalance. His bloodshot eyes refused to still in the pale dawn light, omitting a spastic paranoia that dripped throughout the tribe along with the seawater from his clothes.
Draco appears once again in the view of the camera, fly undone, his eyes on Harry. He brings his nose close to Harry’s ear, mouthing words before running a finger across Harry’s soaked, sticky, and luridly rainbow cheek. Harry is pulled to standing, and he follows Draco back into the booth.
Draco shrugged. “We don’t need to know on the first sweep. We should just look for anything out of the ordinary. If we can connect it to the riddle in any way, we look closer. It’s not efficient to sit here and try to puzzle it out with no context.”
Draco did feel bad about cheating, and Harry knew that full well. They had been talking this trip over for months; in Hermione’s office at the head of the Department of Mysteries, in the Minister’s office when they had first pitched the idea, over countless dinners, and on the pillow when Draco was too excited to sleep. It was decided that using magic was the ‘less risky course of action.’ Draco cared about his work, he really did, but right then, still dazzled by the prospect of being on Survivor, he wished he really could be just a bloke who designed airplanes.
Draco shakes his head, a sinking lurch of shame in the pit of his stomach. “Oh, of course. Harry, I never said you had to get rid of anything…”
. When we were fighting, or in the manor, with him, I never thought that. Of course I was, I suppose, part of history, but I never thought it. And then when my aunt broke the window, I heard her laugh. I think she did it for fun.”
Malfoy is avoiding the question, and he’s not nearly as smooth as he thinks he is. For Harry, though, he’s just smooth enough. “No, hang out with me. Do this whole summer-of-love, befriend the enemy experiment.”
As it turned out, Lonnie really was lovely. Draco had already known he was lovely, but he surpassed even the highest of expectations. He was attentive when Draco spoke, but could light up the sky when he told a story of his own. Draco felt warm and cared for and
Hermione had used a charm to disguise her accent. Pansy just… hadn’t. The audience would think Harry had an eye for the exotic. Or the eccentric. She sprinted into his arms, nearly toppling him over with the force of it. Peppering little kisses all over his face, she squealed and wrapped her legs around his hips. She watched Draco’s face the whole time. “You smell,” she added into his neck, and Harry took the opportunity to push her away. He dusted off his shirt in mild disdain. “She’s not my spouse, she’s my roommate. She thinks she’s very funny,” he reminded Jeff disgruntledly.
Draco followed her to the mouth of the narrow murky creek that skirted the camp. Rolling up the hems of his shorts, he waded in, figuring that it would be easier to go directly than to bushwhack through the thick, prickly weeds along the banks.
“I haven’t felt like myself for a week. And if I haven’t felt like myself now, then I guess before had to be—I don’t know—not that. Maybe this is the human condition; reconciling the horror and the joy and meeting in the middle where there’s a needle in a haystack labelled ‘who we are.’”
When his tribe erupted into cheers as Harry sliced through the final length of twine and the aquamarine flag unfurled with a snap, Draco pasted on a belated smile, but it didn’t reach his eyes. Harry grabbed his arm, pulling him in and lifting him off the ground with a whoop, but Draco backed away stiffly as soon as he was released. He winced from where rough hands had dug into the growing sunburn on his shoulders. Harry earned several slaps on the back and hugs, and Draco couldn’t help the jealous pang of being outshone. He was proud of Harry, sure, but mostly he just felt left behind.
As you inferred, I first noticed this during times of intense emotional engagement, ranging from competitive quidditch matches, exercise, stressful deadlines, sexual intimacy, and, most frequently, during nightmares and anxious episodes.
“Ichabod. That’s what I’ve decided to name him,” Draco replied, smiling down at the toad fondly. “Suits him, don’t you think?”
Harry and Draco left Hagrid and Ichabod and began the short walk home, trying to make sense of the whole situation.
the vibrations around him, each different magical signature dancing through the air on a spectrum from red to violet. It was synesthesia on steroids. He could sense the direction, the distance, and the age of each magical location; they even seemed to have a personality, like the emotion and intent behind the spells cast could be sensed from the way they moved.
The camp was barren when they arrived except for a large white tent on the far end containing camera equipment. Upon landing, the tribe dragged heavy logs into the center of the compact dirt pad, fashioning a set of rustic benches to perch on as they sorted through the winnings from the initial challenge. Draco was pleased to see that they had managed to collect a bar of flint, a bag of rice, and a crab trap in addition to the pots and tarps. Building a shelter was inevitably frustrating, but it turned out that Ian (the surfer from SoCal) worked as a contractor, so, after several hours of fetching, chopping, and lashing, they managed to build a large, lumpy cot with a lean-to roof.
Draco pulls a rickety stool from behind the white curtain that blocks the inside of the booth from the audience. Only the left side of the booth is open, and Harry sits facing it, turning towards the camera to check his cue cards.
Draco was walking along the beach looking for Tara (and wondering if perhaps Lonnie had murdered her and hidden the body) when he stumbled within hearing range of Jones, Tara, and the three original East Tribe members Draco had yet to speak to: the burly man with the pronounced NJ drawl, whose name was Ben, the fit man, CJ, that Draco had learned managed a gym in Miami, and a plump DC house-wife called Claire.
They run, breast to breast, breathless and stifling giggles to save their lungs. Harry’s eyes are locked on the corridor in front of him, and the windmilling of his arms and legs feels wild and out of control, but to the outside observer, it remains precise.
The spell required a complex pattern of neat flicks and swirls, and Draco practiced a few times before motioning for Harry to step back, enunciating the spell in a loud, crisp voice. A deafening buzz surrounded them immediately, layers of melodies reverberating off each other and penetrating Draco’s brain until he could feel them in his pulse.
Like planned, Doug tried to take charge. His idea was to pair the slow diggers with the slow runners. Draco thought this was silly.
Draco comes by to help Harry pack the weekend before move-in. It’s been days since they have been able to spend any real time together, with Harry taking on extra projects so he can take a few days off work to settle in, and Draco has never seen the flat so empty. It is eerily sterile, all white spackled walls and polished corners. “Where are your plants?” Draco blurts.
They lined up on the rug seriously, eying where their prizes lay strewn about the length of the ship’s deck. When Jeff raised his arm and bellowed his signature “Survivors, on your marks, and… go!” the set exploded with a flurry of action. Draco took off, b-lining for a stack of green tarps tied 10 feet up a rope ladder near the central mast. He sprinted for it, dodging a pudgy middle-aged man in a snapback and two women who were already engaged in a shoving match.
“In addition, I was in the minority alliance from the start of the merge all the way until the final five, yet I am still here. This is partly due to my multiple Immunity Challenge wins.
“What the fuck is wrong with you?” Ian yelled. “No one was supposed to take the fishing spears without me.”
“Darling, do you want to talk?” he asked, taking Draco’s hand and running his thumb along his wrist in a soothing semi-circle.
. The moonlight is too bright, the twinkle of the stars too jarring. The horizon is too dark, the muggy atmosphere far, far too still. When he falls back asleep, he dreams of white fog as far as he can see, and he wishes for the cupboard under the stairs, because at least there it is finite and familiar.
Draco stopped in the trail and crossed his arms, making a noise that could only be described as a ‘harumph.’ “It’s not a
Incidentally, it did work, and Tribe West Coast finished the puzzle piece collection portion of the challenge a solid 60 seconds before Tribe East. Where they lost was in the puzzle. Drenched in sweat and dizzy, Draco watched helplessly as Doug and Isabelle absolutely bombed it.
Everybody respects you. You should see how Lindsay looks at you. She’s a superfan, and she thinks you are, like, the ultimate role model. It’s adorable because you’re nothing alike. The challenge yesterday was just a fluke. We won, so it’s all forgiven and forgotten. No one noticed. Look at me; you are incredible, and I love you more every day.”
Harry humphed. He was holding himself up on four toes splayed painfully against the pole. “Usually when people say they stretched with a rod between their legs, they mean something entirely different.”
The clearing that hosted the challenge was colourless except for a green and orange rope marking the perimeter of a muddy flat. Draco assumed that, as of yesterday, it had all been hard-packed dirt. Even Jeff’s moisture-wicking trousers were plastered to his body.
Luna hums as she surveills the garden. “The worms are unhappy that the soil is empty. It’s attracting Wazbries.” Draco decides that just because he’s listening doesn’t mean he has to come up with a reply.
He clutched tight to his husband's waist as they both took one last breath and Disapperated with a deafening snap.
We’ve spent so many months talking about this game. I’m so glad I get to participate. Although, reality TV is so corporate. They’ll edit your whole story around and render you unrecognizable. You better hope they don’t paint you as a nitwit.”
Everyone needs hobbies. Of everyone, Draco especially needs hobbies. Harry misses him on Friday nights, but he is glad his husband had finally decided to do something besides working (or fucking). There is really only so much time one man could spend on level 9 of the Ministry of Magic before it went from unhealthy to very unhealthy. Draco loves being an unspeakable, but none of the offices have any windows, and he’s Vitamin D deficient as-is.
“That’s what we’re here for, Hagrid,” Harry replied, nudging Draco slightly. They stepped into the cottage. “We’ve brought Ichabod with us.”
No-- it’s--” Draco stammers, wincing when a grinding thump sounds from the yard. “Um, no, this is fine.”
“Welcome to the Survivor Auction!” Jeff announced with an excess of gusto impressive for even him. “You guys know the drill. There are wallets on the table with $500 for each of you. You may bid on any item at any time. Some items will be revealed, while some will remain covered. Once you have placed your bids, the deal is final. Are you ready to get started?”
Draco rubs his lubed up hands together vigorously, and a wet thumping fills the studio. Bill suppresses his laughter with breath, beginning to moan and whimper with increasing gusto on Draco’s cue, still entirely hidden from the audience and cameras. Technically, Draco was meant to do this part too, but the sounds he had made during dress had been deemed ‘not lewd enough’, so Bill has been brought on as support.
“Yours,” Harry repeats, but he isn’t talking about Draco. His chest leans in before his feet can keep up, and he nearly slumbles. The firm weight of a soft hand lands on his waist. A heavy breath leaves his lungs.
Harry trails the nail of his thumb along the hem of the corset, tickling the base of Draco’s ribs. He traces the boning up the center of his sternum to his breastbone, follows it in a swoop below his pec. His ring finger flicks Draco’s nipple.
“A witch?” She laughed, cutting him off. “Yeah. I do work for the FBI, but I’m a magical liaison for MACUSA. I was wondering about you. Your hair looked too good.”
This brings me to the topic of emotions. Leaving them out of the equation would jeopardize the whole process, as emotions constantly fuel magic. Like (as Muggle science has found out) a photon is both a wave and a particle, so magic is both acting from emotions and energy. That is also why children often experience accidental magic usage for the first time during a temper tantrum.
Ron and Harry, perhaps because they were of weak constitution when it came to denying their kids, or perhaps because they were secretly pleased, conceded in seconds. After Jake, Ellie and the twins had been picked up, and Hugo had been put to bed, Teddy even roped them into watching every single DVD special feature.
I thought I should warn you about that. I don’t know her well, but I bet she’s scary when she’s stern. Good thing we’re 25 and she can’t actually send you to your room.
Harry turns in his arms, brushing dirt from his cheekbones. “Are you sure, darling? You’re not on anything, are you?”
“The Room of Hidden Things, yeah. The magic, though-- the magic can’t burn. We should go, conjure something new. I bet all this time the castle’s just been holding in the flames. We should make it something happy.”
The dulling of his mind had never been more apparent than it was during the third individual Immunity Challenge.
And so he lay like that, tossing and turning. It wasn’t until the slow break of dawn that he gave up, heaving his aching body from the suffocating mattress and onto the floor. He was so restless. He was so tired. It was only when he went to brush his teeth the following evening that he realized something had been moved; Draco’s cologne, which always sat on a proud little antique vanity in the corner, was missing.
. “Courtesy of my Great Uncle Algie,” he announces. The thing is hideous-- a lumpy, writhing mound of scaly stalks and pointy leaves coated in brown fur.
That evening, after dinner, Harry and Draco made a quick trip back home to collect Ichabod’s terrarium before carrying it carefully down to Hagrid’s hut.
Potter reached for him, murmured something unintelligible, but Draco backed out of the shelter and into the clearing. Face still burning, he went in search of firewood. It was a sloppy attempt to cover his embarrassment, but he figured he would earn points in the tribe by making himself useful. When he returned to camp, arms laden with branches to sort into his neat piles of tinder, kindling, and logs, Isabelle, Harry, and Doug, the massive man that was supposedly a star boxer, were awake and sitting on the sand.
My work with you will focus on the physical and magical level. As I assume you would not want to see me too often,
They don’t leave until closing, the sun low and orange over the sloping grassy hills. “Give me the receipt,” Draco says. “I want to write down the address.
I can’t help but read into your disclosure of your history with depression and self-harm. If you ever want to talk about it, let me know. Everyone’s experience is a little different, but I know what it’s like to feel a prisoner in one’s history, one’s regret, one’s life. Perhaps someday we can compare scars or some shit. I will try not to talk about myself or my own experiences too much. When I’m not being an ego-maniac, I’ve been told I give good consolations-- and good hugs. I will just say this: I have met death, and the two of you would absolutely not get along. You are far too vibrant and witty. He’d fear the fact that you could see right through him.
“Heyoo,” he says. “I hope you guys are enjoying the gallery! I was just about to start a demonstration, if one of you would like to volunteer to join me?”
“No idea. Bought him from a fella down Knockturn Alley a couple of days ago. He only had the one left, and he looked so lonely. I couldn’t leave him, and I thought you two might like him for your new place.”
Malfoy meets him at his room, like he said he would, like Harry asked. Harry knows because he is woken by a hesitant hand on his shoulder, a soft shake. His eyes blink open, and, just for a second, all he sees is a snake with it’s jaws wide open, an old man collapsing to a damp dungeon floor, threads of a house elf’s blood being pulled away with the tide. His hand is on his wand immediately, his wand against the stark tendon of a slender neck nearly as fast.
I hope that my inadequate explanations have been enough to pique your interest, and I beg you to consider my case. I am willing to do nearly anything to find a solution for reigning in my magical core, and I believe that, if your department invests in helping me, you may be able to research previously unexplored specificities of how wizards utilize their magical signatures.
Malfoy’s head snaps up, a deer in the headlights. He opens his mouth, but Harry is too far to hear what he has stammered. Harry clenches and then unclenches his fists, off time with the march of his feet towards Malfoy.
Harry picks him up, both hands under his arse so Draco can wrap his legs around his waist. He feels himself being carried towards the sunroom, and he smiles into Harry’s hair, breathing in the familiar scent of rosemary and cayenne and lemon balm.
“Maybe this was where the homes were? Rai stones were usually only where the chiefs lived,” Draco speculated.
“Not really. Just wanted to let you know that Jibberlies gave the whole department a surprise three day weekend. I thought you could stay over. I think I’m going to the Botanical Gardens tomorrow, and I’ll be seeing Teddy on Sunday. I figured you’d want to come.”
“I am an engineer, a scientist, and, at my core, a listener. I don't often go out of my way to share myself with others, but it is important to me to have a strong connection to the word around me. I know you are from New Jersey. I know you live 45 minutes from New York and take your two sons there every month. I know you hate Atlantic City.
Taking the Floo would have been faster, but Harry opted to Apparate. He found something grounding about the act of exiting and locking his front door and the long stroll through the woodland garden to the edge of his wards. Just being outside made him feel refreshed.
Harry studied the spell and raised his wand arm, but Draco pressed it down. “Let me,” he said, “Your raw power gets in the way of precision.”
“I suppose she wanted to make a move. She’s young and dumb and figured this was the way to make her mark,” Isabelle reasoned from beside him.
She pointed to her leg, where diluted blood ran down over her knee, each drop a tributary of a much larger stream. The wound was wide and shallow, the kind one would get from falling on asphalt; the kind that, unless treated, tended to get very, very infected.
“Yes?” Malfoy replies. His voice is closer than expected-- despite the trick blocks, they are making good time.
“Alright, if you insist. How do you want to do this? We can’t enlarge it with him inside,” Harry replied, still gazing at the toad with mild disgust etched on his face.
“Well, you see, I’ve had to learn a lot of things rather quickly, with my accounts frozen and my wand snapped. But I’ve just been informed I could have paid my dues by simply ordering someone a drink.”
Draco’s steps are quick and precise, just as they always are (and that in itself is enough to make Harry swoon), but they are also flowing and sultry. When he drops to the ground, throws his arms above his head, Harry swallows hard, his body reacting to the display of flexibility. He catches sight of the tattoo on Draco’s ribs-- the one that says
She did so at the very center of camp, right where Draco was busy boiling drinking water. Jabbering constantly, she plopped down between him and the row of canteens he was filling. Sighing, he got up and wordlessly circled the fire to regain access to his task. Tara followed him.
Tribal Council was relatively subdued. Everyone besides Tara was too nervous to say anything even remotely off-colour. It was so quiet, in fact, that Doug seemingly started to realize something was amiss. It became clear as day when, asked if anyone would be surprised tonight, Lindsay stammered and glanced fleetingly towards Doug’s shoe. Draco did his best to stifle all conversation after that, urging Jeff to get to the vote.
Harry thought for a moment. “Do you think that’s what the hole in the Rai stones are for? To hold the magic, like Stonehenge but smaller?”
The camp tour, too, was brief and stilted. Harry and Lonnie trailed behind, deep in conversation. Draco let Ian show off the well and shelter, sitting down beside the fire pit and starting on a neat A-frame.
They hadn’t figured out who Jones, Claire, CJ, and Tara were voting for, but it shouldn’t have mattered much. They should have had the majority regardless.
Harry rolls his eyes, because he can, and, really, he’s having more fun now than he has in a long time. Ron and Hermione are back at Grimmauld, not asleep, certainly, but likely too tired to go looking for him. He wonders what they’d say about the conversation he’s having right now. “What an awfully muggle thing to say,” he tells Malfoy.
“Okay,” Draco said. “Okay. Keep going until you can’t feel anything but the stone. And darling?--” Harry looked up-- “Please be careful.”
Draco rolls his eyes. He steps into the floo, holding his breath as it whisks him to Harry’s flat. A curtain of vines blocks his exit, and he ducks clumsily on instinct, a cloud of soot rising to coat his robes. “Fuck you, Potter,” he huffs. The indulgently familiar scent of pine and humid earth flooding his senses.
The fit man dropped soon after. He had lasted longer than expected-- Draco had assumed he was a meathead-- but, with a body like that, he likely had an image to uphold that kept him going. Or perhaps there was more to him than met the eye. Draco didn’t really care; he just tried his best not to sneak a look at the bloke’s retreating behind as he trudged towards the loser’s table.
“... and Draco, I suppose I haven’t gotten to know him yet. He’s close with Isabelle, and that scares me. They’ve got the look of folks that mean business. Those two are a power couple. Oh, no, not like that, although Draco does have this disgusting sexual tension with Harry. They banter like parrots and then ignore each other for hours at a time, but you can always catch one staring at the other. I don’t think either will break, though. There’s a chemistry, but it’s way too, like, unpredictable. I guess weird people attract. They’ll leave this place sure they’re enemies, but then they can get water and work on the fire for hours and hug after challenges like it’s nothing. I swear, those two are some of the most oblivious nerds I’ve ever met,” Jessie, the girl from Mississippi, was saying.
“Well we can’t keep calling him ‘him’, can we?” Draco asked. “He needed a name. Unless you have something else in mind?”
Harry doesn’t know what time it is, but the sun is down. It might have been on it’s way to rising again; It might have just set. It didn’t matter much; he wouldn’t be sleeping regardless. Instead, he paces-- up one hallway, down another, in uneven meandering circles. A hundred yards past it, he realizes that he had climbed the stairs with the trick step and had avoided it automatically.
“In this game, I was able to embody all three facets of Survivor: Outwit, Outlast, and Outplay, all without losing sight of my core values or hurting those I cared about. I hope you will consider writing my name down, and I want to say it has been a pleasure playing with you all.”
Harry leaned over and kissed Draco’s cheek. “I know you really like him, so hopefully this will be something we can fix easily.”
“Not a clue,” Draco said with a grin. “But that won’t stop me talking to him. Come on. We’ll be late.”
They’d been in their cottage for a week now, and most of their friends had been over to see it. It was too small for a party, something which they were both glad of.
Draco dropped to his knees, heaving, and let Jeff bring the necklace to him at the top of his tall, luridly magenta grand staircase. He was entirely exhausted, but it had been entirely worth it. As the speedboat took them back to the beach, his coiled adrenaline eased into giddy relief
-- and for a moment he thinks he will never be able to look away, but then Draco’s hips swivel, and Harry’s eyes follow on their own accord.
With less than 48 hours left until Harry officially moves in, Draco really cannot keep his mouth shut any longer. He hasn’t allowed Harry to come over to his house in daylight for over a week, and he’s running out of (increasingly outlandish) excuses. He’s pretty sure that Harry has caught on, and, besides, with Harry’s flat half packed-up, it’s been pretty annoying having to stay on a box-spring-less mattress every time he wants to fall asleep after sex.
Kristen sneaks a glance inside the booth, nodding in enthusiasm. “I can’t wait to tell my art theory professor about this!” she says. “Using people as a canvas-- how novel. It really delves deep into our personal connection with our mediums and the humanity within abstractism.”
Harry glares, but only for a moment. “Figure-four, then lay-back. Wanna see you.” He drops to his front, chest pressed to the ground and muscular back arched spectacularly to push his arse in the air. Draco pulls Harry’s shorts over the curves of his body, running his hands back up his thighs when the garment gets stuck at his spread knees.
If it will help you with your preliminary research, I can give some exposition on how the issues surrounding my magic have progressed over the past several years, as well as the strategies I have used to manage it myself.
Draco’s lip turns up-- he is so, so hopelessly gone for this boy, awkwardness and all. “Yeah. Yeah, I guess I am.”
Harry, though, had always been infuriatingly good at memorization. He and Draco were a board game couple, and where Draco could kick anyone’s arse at Othello,Wizard’s Chess, and Scrabble, Harry always, always won the matching ones. Christ, he even always won Trivial Pursuit.
Malfoy spins to face him on his heel, losing his balance and cursing as he catches himself with a hand against sharp scattered stones. With his back to a soaring pane of aquamarine stained glass, his eyes are corn-flower blue.
I sort of fell into working for MACUSA. I had a former FBI agent criminology prof, and he asked me if I would be interested, so I sent in an application. Six months later I was running drills in Quantico. The Magical Defense Bureau got word and pulled me in. If anything teaches you about the human race, magical or otherwise, it’s detective work. I’ve seen more now than my teenage-self ever could have dreamed in their worst nightmares.”
Harry pushes back from the edge abruptly with a wince. He holds out his hand. It has a tremor. He doesn’t remember when it started. “We should start over. Water under the bridge, you know. If we’re gonna be here all Summer, all that baggage will just get in the way. That’d be silly, init?” The words come out brusquer, more flippant than when he had said them in his head. It shouldn’t matter, really; they both know it is a pretty lie. Harry’s by-gones have always haunted him.
It shouldn’t have been a surprise that Draco was in trouble-- after all, the alliances stood at five to three, and Tara barely counted as a number. However, the tribe had only been formed a little over a week ago. So far, things were mostly fun and games. The social ladder was one of convenience rather than loyalty.
He closed his eyes, savouring the way magic fizzed around them, the way it seeped inside of him as he breathed it in. It was a dangerous sort of magic, blooming from within the Earth’s core and carrying with it echoes of every spell ever cast and every wizard ever born-- that would be born. Usually, it was vast and subdued, but when manipulated it became a tempest. In many ways, Ley Lines were like the sea.
Draco leans in to whisper in his ear, the soft curve of his lips and tickle of breath on Harry’s ear. “I like it when you’re flustered.” What he means is
You wrote about your difficulties keeping still and reigning in your thoughts, and that you feel that it might have something to do with the difficulty of controlling your magic. By the way, while your script is messy, as it has been since Hogwarts, don’t feel self-conscious about your writing process.
I was raised middle class in Sacramento. It’s a cess-pool of a city, but there was a small magical school there. My graduating class was 15 kids, but we’d visit the school up north in Okanagen every few weeks to merge lessons. We even had field trips to Ilvermorny. It was isolated, but I’m grateful for it. I left the magical world for a while after graduating. I think after 17 years my universe just felt so small, so I moved to San Diego and studied sociology.
Isabelle’s Quantico experience, Ian’s surfing prowess, and Harry’s excellent throwing quickly pulled team West Coast back into the lead. Still, Draco stayed at the far edge of the docks and crossed each obstacle solidly middle-of-the-pack, trying his best to keep attention away from himself. The only other person that fell off any obstacle was a petite girl from the opposite tribe, and Draco felt horrible.
Draco watched frozen as Isabelle started to fall, springing into action only when the trajectory of her head threatened to intersect with a sharp outcropping.
Draco grinned, slapping a cheeky red handprint into the bare skin of Harry’s back. “Don’t worry, darling. I’ve got plenty for both of us.”
“It’s not going to be that high. Come down!” Draco yelled back, cupping his hands to his face in hopes the wind wouldn’t whisk his voice out of range.
“No, no, we can’t, remember? Jake is scared of the dentist girl. Besides, frankly, the more times I see it, the more messed up it gets. Hugo’s gonna have to wait until he’s 18 to see it-- I want to make sure he can really grasp the hero’s journey themes.”
Harry sprinted forward, and Draco and Jessie trailed at a jog. Claire was last to the top of her staircase.
And then they start dancing, and Harry is utterly enthralled. He cannot think as far as to want anything; he cannot think at all. His collar sticks to the back of his neck and his lips shine from being licked and bitten over and over.
Harry rolled his eyes. “I thought you were a student of the game. Isn’t cheating a little unethical?”
I’m glad you liked the books. I’m sorry your ex stole your copy. That was incredibly rude of them. Someone I dated in uni took my hard-back of Dorain Grey-- said it was ‘infuriating stereotypical’. I wonder if it was the same boy-- did he also cheat on you with a girl named Eliza the day before your birthday?
I’m sorry that I talked so much yesterday. I am embarrassed by my selfish excitement and lack of succinctness. I wish I had let you say more and had not deprived myself of hearing more of your voice.
“Everything is self interest. Your self interest is my self interest, because I care about you.” Merlin, Harry loves it when Malfoy waxes poetic.
Isabelle sat down beside him and he groaned petulantly, loath to be disturbed from such a state of relaxation. If it had been anyone else, besides Harry, he would have snapped to alertness, mind racing through strategy and choosing each word noticeably carefully, but Isabelle was not just anyone.
“Yes. I do,” Harry replied, eyeing the toad in Draco’s arms. “I know you don’t want to believe it, but none of this stuff was happening before he arrived. It’s a bit of a coincidence, don’t you think?”
And the way you said it, in such a normal, domestic situation, just as we got ready to take Teddy to the National Museum of Scotland! You gave me such a tender look. Had it not been for Teddy waiting for us, I would have dragged you upstairs immediately and taken you back to bed.
He gave Harry a healthy serving of eggy fried rice and sausage, hoping to dilute his blood alcohol. It did not work, and, hence, he had to pry Harry off his lap a total of six times (the same amount of times the Steelers had won the Super Bowl, incidentally).
The Room of Requirement is lit with spiraling fireworks. Some are neon, shaped into curly-cues and tornados. Others form the likeness of Dragons, and they swoop and flip through the air. Harry recognizes them as a batch of Fred and George’s Wildfire Whiz-Bangs that were confiscated mid fifth-year.
Draco spends the rest of the afternoon on his hands and knees, double checking the integrity of the groundwater filtering charms along the fence, and of the light, humidity, and nitrogen monitors in the beds. At one, a light rain begins to fall; by two, the skies have parted for a deluge.
A shaggy brown head pops out from behind an azalea bush. “Draco!” Neville jumps to his feet, a shower of mulch falling from his knees. He holds out a thick, calloused hand and slaps Draco on the back when he takes it. “Glad I could make it.”
The third day of summer hols were sunny and bright. Harry woke to late morning bird song and church bells, the sheets cool and soothing beneath him. Draco had long since left for work, but Harry had no such obligation. For three months, there’d be no more asking McGonagall for weekends off, no more begging Draco to spend the night at Hogwarts for more than just two workdays, even though the walk to the Apparition Point in Hogsmeade was more than a mile. No more stacks of grading or cranky first years or leaving Molly’s Sunday supper early; school was out. Harry rolled and stretched with a contented sigh, nearly crushing their sleeping cat. He gave her a conciliatory scratch, earning himself a soft purr; even she was in a good mood.
He blinked in alarmed discombobulation, kicking away the covers with frantic lack of finesse and flipping over. Draco beside him was still and peaceful. Harry summoned his wand from the bedside table. A
“Malfoy,” he says to the voice in the shadows. Harry can see him now, if he squints. A touch of white blond against the velvet drapings, a sharp cheekbone against the curve of the plush bench-seat. He may have used a Notice-Me-Not, or it may be that Harry is so hyper-aware he has lost the breadth of his perception.
Plus, that way I’ll be all alone with Granger in a resort-hotel,” Pansy had begged. They had decided not to invite both Ron and Hermione, figuring someone needed to stay home with the kids. Harry had not been in favour of Pansy’s suggestions, but Draco needed Hermione to be his guest so they could speak about the project, so Harry had gotten vetoed.
There was a chorus of “Yeah!” as the contestants grabbed their wallets one by one and fanned along the bleacher benches. Draco sat, as usual, between Isabelle and Harry. The three of them were creatures of habit.
He bowed. “For you, my love,” he announced, eyes only on Draco as he presented a bouquet of brilliant pink and yellow flowers. Draco giggled. It was moments like this that made him fall in love all over again.
Merlin help me, Harry, but I have to be bold. Bolder than I have ever been in my life. I don’t know if you feel the same, but I believe the house attacked me because I’m yours in a way that Hermione and Ron aren’t.
“Oh, thank Merlin. Harry, you’re in the hospital,” Draco said, his voice full of relief. “The Healers will be pleased you’ve woken up.”
Only the space in front of them is bright enough to see, and the corners of the room are fuzzy, as if they could go on forever. A rickety two-railed track stretches from one side to the other, and at the center, directly in front of Harry and Malfoy, a gold and purple carriage-car idles with a quiet purr, awaiting further instruction.
“Dude, take a chill pill,” Ian, the surfer from San Diego, cut in, and Draco stalled, stunned. He had an obsessive personality, but he really had thought he was keeping it in check. After a youth in the shadows, he had banked on remembering how to not overshare.
Unbeknownst to all but a few amused colleagues, a pale, pointy brit watches on, eyes glued to the host and boasting a blush of his own.
“A bit warmer than we would have for native toads, maybe?” Harry suggested. “I’m not convinced he’s a native species. He doesn’t look anything like the toad that Neville had.”
Draco grins. He is head-over-heels stupid in love. He has never been more in love, and it’s silly and sappy and filthy, but it’s them.
Draco was the first one to finish his gear configuration. Racing down the stairs three at a time, arms braced on the railing, he landed feet-first at the base of his platform. The water in his well had been dyed a chalky purple, and he dunked his bucket to fill it. Eying his target, he aimed and thrust the bucket of water forward with a short jerk, watching as the water sailed left of the elevator pail and splashed against the muddy ground. He sighed. This was going to take some practice.
. He pours all of himself into everything he does, striving for the sort of confidence that can only come with competence. Draco does not do anything for the sake of doing it; there is always intention. He
Harry had dropped them in the middle of the woods. The day prior, he had Apparated to a well trafficked Apparition site in Koror, having done a specified tracking spell so he knew where to go. From there, he had used a spell similar to the one he and Draco had used at the start of their trip to find the most concentrated, most powerful magical signature in 50 miles. That place, apparently, was here.
Hagrid opened the door a few seconds later and gazed at them for a moment. “Ah. I don’t think I’m going to need that now.”
Hermione was meant to be portraying his half-sister. He had been at the interview where she had meticulously explained how his mom and her dad had met at an elementary school fundraiser before falling in love and joining their broken families. They hadn’t planned this story; Hermione had been making it up as she went, and Draco had been seriously impressed.
Today, they are hosting a summer barbeque, and it will be the first time all of their friends have been at their shared home at the same time. Luna shows up unfashionably-early, as usual, carrying a suspicious bundle of home-grown carrots and tomatoes. Draco thinks they may be writhing.
Evidently, it was not fine. Tribal Council was long and grueling as CJ gave Jeff an extended breakdown of their very long, not-so-good day. When it came time to read votes, one curly-cue script with the word ‘Marissa’ scrawled within a cloud of hearts caught Draco’s eye.
Draco was awful at accepting compliments, so he grabbed her hand instead, pulling her in for a long hug.
“Draco!” Harry greets with a radiant smile and Draco can’t help a rush of warmth from flooding his chest. “No, no, stay! It’s just Ron.”
Draco grins. “That sounds perfect.” He punctuates it with a kiss. “I have some things to take care of today and tomorrow morning, but if you can bear with me getting out of bed early, I can be back by midafternoon. Merlin, it feels like I haven’t seen Ted in ages.”
“I want to check right over there,” she said, pointing towards a ledge that jutted out beside her head. She took one step up and felt around with a hand. Frustrated, she raised to her tippy-toes, smearing her other foot on a pointy jib for leverage. Pulling quickly with her other arm, she managed a desperate sweep of the back of the hollow. As she did so, the rubber sole of her shoe slipped, and she let out a short, high yelp. Her hand, the final remaining point of contact, held on for a heart-stopping second, but the abrasive edges of the rock cut into her palm, and she let go instinctually.
Harry dropped next. He was incomparably sharp and quick, and performed brilliantly under pressure, but he lacked the organization and foresight to excel in this sort of mental challenge. Draco’s pet name for him was ‘tornado.’
“I make lists for plants. I’m gonna take another day off and go to that nursery by Southampton on Tuesday. Can you come? I need to take a closer look at the light exposure and charms, but I think I’ve got some ideas.”
“Wait, like, move in here?” Harry asks, jabbing Draco in the ribs as he squirms to reach the remote. He pauses
If you get this, I’m sorry you had to wake up alone. I couldn’t sleep and went out for some air. I’ll make sure to grab us egg-on-bagels from this place I know out in Cardiff.
You write about running through mountain trails and sleeping under the stars. I guess I’m not as  powerful as you are - I’ve never dared to Apparate that far - but I have spent a few nights under the stars in the Scottish Highlands with a warming charm after a long walk to clear my head. I’ve always dreamed of sharing the view with someone. The alps are probably even more splendid…
When it was Lonnie’s turn, he met each contestant with gentle eye contact before settling on Harry. “Harry, in the past 39 days I have come to know you very, very well. What I cannot understand is why you applied to play Survivor. Can you explain to me what you hoped to get out of this experience.”
Unfortunately, a disunified tribe does not make a particularly well-oiled challenge machine. The third Immunity Challenge of the game took place on the lush white sand of a long beach. It was pillowy and warm beneath their feet, but while it may have been well suited for tanning, it was abysmal for running. The challenge required each team to split into four pairs. In three of those pairs, one member would be digging for pieces of a puzzle while the other transported the pieces one at a time to a central location on the beach. The other two members would be assembling the puzzle once the pieces were collected.
Draco didn’t have to worry in the end-- Claire did make her own decision, choosing to cast her final parchment for Harry, and the Tribal went to the obligatory firemaking competition. Draco spent more time watching the faces of the Jury than the contestants. Iz gave him a thumbs up, pointing to her neck to acknowledge his challenge win and tapping her feet excitedly. CJ studied Harry and Jessie’s A-frames, eyes darting back and forth astutely. Tara, as usual, was staring off in the distance. To the untrained eye, it might have looked like patient civility, but Draco knew better. Lonnie urged Harry on with a smile on his face. Jones just glowered.
Draco stumbled to his feet, an undignified yelp escaping his clenched teeth as he attempted to take a step. Iz came up beside him, offering her arm, and he slumped against her with a moan.
“Falling in love is easy. No, Snape is a hero because he was brave. He put himself in constant danger, under constant responsibility for nearly half his life. He meant something. Even before I knew he was a spy, I always admired that he had intention.”
see him as an outsider. I know the guy; he’s smart and tough as nails, but when he gets upset, he gets controlling.” The longer Harry spoke, the faster and louder his voice got.
“Mmm,” Harry responds. It hasn’t occurred to him to begin finding his feet. He hardly knows where they are. “Didn’t notice.”
Harry’s expression morphes from confused to amused to disgruntled. He throws his hands up. “They’ve got security cameras!”
Draco made omelettes as Harry moved on to a story about Ron and Ginny having a bitter argument over who would be Bill’s second child’s godparent. Draco knew this story well; once they had started transfiguring the kitchenware into baptism gowns, he had needed to step in to remind them it wasn’t even their decision at all.
The song ends, and the noise of the club comes crashing back all at once. A woman whoops from the front row, and the dancers disappear into the wings. Harry is flushed, head to toe, and desperately, desperately hard.
“Okay,” he agreed. ‘We try to win Marissa with strategy and Tara with, I don’t know, fucking hugs and cookies. I’ll talk to Harry about it and we’ll make a plan. Jessie and Lonnie can go after Tara. They’re cool. If we can convince them to be nice to her, she’ll feel good about herself.”
Draco,” Potter cut in. “Bloody hell, why did I agree to come on this damn trip. Any other Auror could have come, but somehow I’m stuck here for a month babysitting.”
Both Rai stones were still and dense to the touch. Either they had lost all magic whatsoever, or they had morphed to reflect Draco’s mood.
You were the first to make me question my beliefs. When I saw you so open with your friends, it changed my perspective on relationships and humanity. I couldn’t talk openly about anything, not even with Pansy, even though she had been my closest friend since early childhood. Each of your friends belonged to a group of people I had been told not to associate with, Muggleborns, people my father called blood traitors, people who use a Remembrall, not heteronormative people like Finnegan and Thomas (joke’s on my father: I turned out to be gay myself), slightly eccentric people like Lovegood, werewolves like Professor Lupin (who wasn’t dangerous at all; unlike the werewolf my father did associate with because his master forced him to)… And they were all better people than those I was told were 'the right sort of wizard.
“To care about what? Healing? Remorse? Malfoy, there’s no coming back from this. There’s no healing. Why do you think I’m here?”
Harry stares, not moving closer, not backing away. The music presses in around them. He reaches out a tentative hand, but pulls it back to his side; his fingers twitch, still reaching. “God. Fuck. Can I touch you?” His voice shakes.
; we will only meet up when it’s strictly necessary. Otherwise, I will send you tests which you do on your own and can send me probes of your magical energy to analyze.
“Maybe she should have thought about making a mark before becoming a pageant princess or whatever,” he hissed.
“I believe our rational ideas and our raw instincts often come from the same place, and therefore honoring them can result in very similar outcomes. Both are social strategies that require a significant amount of risk taking, initiative, and relationship building. In order to use either successfully, you need to be brave enough to begin, persistent enough to get it done, and tactful enough to convince others to follow you.
“Win, obviously,” Draco drawled with a wicked smirk, his proper British pronunciations polishing his words.
Each player had to place their balls into the chute at the top of their metal contraption and catch them when they spit out one of the two exit holes. At the start, the players needed only to have one ball going at once. Then, in 5-minute increments, the number of balls increased up to six. It required complete mental concentration. If time was taken to yearn for the feast or listen to Jeff’s commentary, a ball would  more than likely drop.
It was the day of a Reward Challenge, but Draco could already tell little else was going to get done. Strategizing was hard to do when no one ever left the shelter. The tribe had divided into two rough alliances, Doug, Harry, and Ian leading the first and the lawyer, Ed, who had gotten into multiple clashes with Ian already, staking a claim on the other. Draco and Isabelle, who had already established the foundations of a genuine friendship, formed a satellite group of the lawyer’s alliance. Without having been to a Tribal, it was still to be seen how the team would fare in the face of adversity.
Draco nodded again. “I don’t think he’s going to be eating the plants anyway. If we stick to ferns, it should be alright.”
There, in the middle of the narrow glade, sat atop gnarled roots and dropped needles, sits Malfoy. He is motionless, attention glued to his palm. The other hand is held out and aloft, clinging to nothing. Suddenly, it all clicks in Harry’s brain.
“When I was a child,” Draco says, “and I visited the Leaky Cauldron, I looked out the window and saw muggle construction cranes, and I thought they were the masts of giant ships.”
It is, decidedly, not fun. The stained bench seat doesn’t even have safety belts, and Harry stalls the truck at each of the first four stop lights. Draco’s knuckles are white and sore from gripping the ‘oh shit’ handle without rest. When Harry merges onto the highway exiting London, Draco closes his eyes, and, for the first time since he was a child, prays.
A flash of colour caught his eye, and he paused to look, moving behind her and running his hand along the rock with his finger. There, shoulder height and wedged in with a loose stone, was a neatly wrapped package.
Celebrating, apparently, involved talking with Lonnie on the beach. “Go join him! He’s such a joy,” Harry said. “He’ll calm you right down. He’s the wizened mentor that neither of us ever got to have. Well, got to have outside of war zones.”
However dazed Harry felt before, however out-of-his-body and latent, what he is now is untethered. He doesn’t much like it. He decides to pretend the world is black and white, just so it will hurt less to look at. The next morning he wakes up and can’t see color at all. A
“Right. Well, we’d better get going,” Harry said, stepping backwards again. “We’ll bring the terrarium over after work, if that’s alright, Hagrid?”
Hagrid sets him up with a growler of something purple and steaming and a comically-sized wooden kitchen chair.
Currently, they were researching Rai stones, large, donut-shaped limestone sculptures that were mined, carved, and treasured by the native inhabitants of the Yap Islands. Since they had been made on the islands for hundreds of years, Draco was curious to study what magical influences they had. Mostly, though, Draco was curious to see if he could find an excuse to be on Survivor, and still call it work.
I’m not going to lie; visiting the house is going to be rough. Do you mind if I ask Hermione to tag along? I will try not to embarrass myself with too many shakes, tears, or explosions. I’d ask you to wear a bomb-squad suit, but that sort of outfit is far too modest for your (my) taste.
A whistle in the distance, muted by a hundred feet of cement on all sides, drifts in through Harry’s ears-- in one, out the other. It carries with it a stale breeze, heavy with the dust of the Underground but tinged with a promise of something that was once familiar. He catches a flash of gilded smokestack as the Hogwarts Express leaps towards the landing, screeching in protest against its brakes. It seems as reluctant to stop as Harry is to get on. There is nothing musical about the sound of a locomotive drawing to a halt-- the 1-2-3-1-2-3-1-2 tap loses it’s rhythm, the twirl of the wheels stutters and blurs.
When Draco wakes up, the room is pitch black save for a golden orb of light above the opposite side of the bed. He wriggles towards it and sighs when his hands find Harry’s ribcage.
Desire flooded his body. Maybe it was the stress and starvation, his biological clock having been convinced that death was imminent and procreation therefore necessary. Or maybe Harry really was just that pretty. Draco pounced.
The speedboat picked them up in the early afternoon, dropping the tribe on a gloomy, inconspicuous beach on the north-facing side of a small island. On the trek inland, the rough trail disintegrated under their feet as rain carved a path through the center, the ground entirely saturated.
and mashed his face into the pillow. The buzzing in his brain was abundantly clear; there was no way in Merlin’s Green Earth he was falling back asleep.
When Harry breaks the silence, it is just as fitting, just as seamless. “It lost something, too. Just like us. I think it’s grieving.”
When the spells were finally gone, Draco began his inspection. He sat in the grass, eyes closed and legs crossed. It was a process not unlike meditation. Then, with a complex wave of his wand, he visualized the magical field of the stone, felt it’s presence, and ventured inside so that it’s signature surrounded him.
A single thread of magic, soft, slender, and periwinkle, traced Draco’s feet, and he bent to study it. He ran his hand through the ethereal mist and closed his eyes, letting the gentle scent of mangoes and shade wash over him. He pulled Harry down with him, gesturing, and Harry nodded.
Please forgive me, I feel so ashamed of myself. I should have taken this aggravating factor of your condition into consideration.
They waited patiently for the rest of the contestants to gather, and Draco scowled when Harry Potter joined him on the mat, partially blocking Draco’s view. At any minute, Jeff Probst would be right in front of them, and Draco was absolutely not going to miss it.
Draco fucks him through it with increasingly incoherent praise. He isn’t particularly rough, but the strings of expletives that fall from his mouth and the stuttering of his hips in response to Harry’s blissed-out moans convey a different, rarer sort of urgency.
“Here!” she exclaimed, uncharacteristic confidence evident in her smile. Isabelle was a stoic woman, but, as Draco had discovered, the more one got to know her, the more she opened up. She was sharp and steady and logical, but there was a youthful whimsy to the analytical way she studied the world. It was like she was a student of life. Draco envied it.
Malfoy extracts himself from Harry’s arms, inspecting the floor behind him with a knit in his brow before his face explodes into riotous laughter.
Draco cleared his throat, trying to break the uncomfortable silence. “Shall we split the vote?” he inquired, voice quiet in his best impersonation of ‘meek.’ Jones snarled and turned away.
Draco turned, eager for the game to officially commence. A shrewd-looking woman of around 30 stepped forward, assessing all eight other players with a sharp up-down glance before speaking.
Jeff squinted. “That was quick. Draco, please come forward. Would you like to share why you chose him?”
However, when it came time to make a fire for dinner, Draco’s day began to angle downhill. Firstly, it was bloody hot outside. The air was thick and cloying with the promise of tropical rain and Draco’s whole body felt sticky and tight. Making things inconceivably worse was that Potter insisted upon walking around shirtless, which did nothing to cool Draco down. His tawny skin quite literally glistened. It was disgustingly obscene.
BONUS QUESTION! Drop your answers bellow, and the first to get it right will receive a drabble from yours truly.
The firemaking challenge ended rather abruptly, as they always tended to do, with Harry’s flame growing steadily and Jessie scraping dust off her flint with increasing desperation. Draco supposed Harry would tell him, after this was all over, whether he had used magic or not. Knowing his husband, or, rather, knowing Hermione’s influence on his husband, Draco figured he probably hadn’t.
His feet carry him from groves of ash and birch to thick bracken and finally to pine. The clearing opens up in front of him before he can know to stop it.
“Potter, your obnoxious, possessive antics are going to get us voted out. How people haven’t gotten sick of us dancing around each other, I do not know,” Draco said.
“Iz, oh my god, oh my god, are you okay?” he asked hysterically, shaking her. Her eyes were open, but very wide and very still.
Jessie did end up getting her treat with an elaborately shrouded tray Jeff held up reverently with both hands. When it turned out to be white rice and cow tongue, a wave of second hand anguish wracked Draco (he was back on speaking terms with Jessie; at the prior night’s tribal, she had flipped
“I don’t. We got in five good weeks of playacting. Now it has to go back to the way it was and—” his voice cracks—“It was fucking miserable, okay! I shouldn‘t have trusted you. It seemed so novel—befriend the enemy. What a way to say fuck it to reality. What a way to stop being me.”
Draco struggled to remain inattentive; it was easy to zone out Tara’s words because they were utter gibberish anyway, but her voice was so bloody
Three hours past sunrise, a speedboat arrived at their beach, and all nine of them clambered in. It took nearly half an hour to arrive at the site of the challenge, but when they finally reached it, it took Draco’s breath away. Dozens of colorful docks dotted the shallows of a broad cerulean bay. They were dropped off on the largest of the platforms, joined soon after by the East Coast tribe. A camera and production crew, complete with divers and boom mics, crowded on a near-bye raft, bustling about with so much fervor that Draco thought the whole thing was going to tip.
Harry senses Malfoy coming before he sees him, even through the whip of the wind and the syrupy, indistinct aura of dusk. He doesn’t bother to turn around.
P.P.S George brought me some non-explosive candy this weekend, and I wondered if you would like any. I hope I haven’t been monopolizing your leisure time, but if so, perhaps a few small luxuries can act as a consolation prize.
When you wrote to me about the reactions to the potions Okafor gave you, I knew that there was something I didn’t know about. Those reactions didn’t make any sense with the information I had. But I guess I was too self-absorbed to think that it might be a terrible idea to let you go into Grimmauld Place. I should have known better. Bellatrix learned her atrocities from Great-aunt Walburga.
He had likely been wandering in circles, like Winnie the Pooh in the Hundred Acre Woods, for half an hour when he almost tripped over a protrusion on the ground. At first, he thought it was a root, but upon closer inspection, yellowy lichen and dappled limestone peeked out from beneath decades of woven vines.
He looked at Harry, entirely overwhelmed. Harry’s pupils blew wide and his shoulders rode up with tension. They stood in shock, facing the ocean, for what felt like an eternity before Harry blinked and shivered, as if physically fighting off a stupor. He closed his eyes and waved his wand high, and the world exploded with colour.
“You’ve got to be right about the donut hole in the stones,” Draco muttered, lost in his own head. “It felt like Stonehenge in there, like the cave was holding the magic in and concentrating it. But it didn’t need any spells to draw up the magic, and the Rai stones don’t have charms either. It must be something in the rock itself that stores the magic and pulls it to the surface.”
Draco slunk back to camp. Apparently, the Orange Tribe was already prepared to kamikaze their own before even the first vote, and Tara’s interest showed she probably wasn’t interested in flipping.
He laughed, short and loud. “I mean, I’m sleep deprived, I’m starving, and my grip on reality is rapidly slipping away, but I’ve got my work and my husband. This game is so bloody cool. It’s, like, once in a lifetime.”
“Maybe the house got rid of it. We don’t know the habits of the magic yet – maybe it vanishes anything it deems dangerous.” Harry had never heard anything of the sort. He crossed his arms.
He pulls a schematic from his pocket that he has designed with Neville (Neville’s had been hand drawn, but Draco has gone over it with spells to mark angles and dimensions) and pushes it into the woman’s hand. “I really need someone knowledgeable to go in with the right soil and charmwork, and I think all of the dirt will need to be replaced. I get city run-off, so I’m sure a protective shield will need to be placed, too. I really haven’t done much with the place in the past, and honestly I feel a touch overwhelmed, but--”
! Ron, how did that end up in the kids box! We might as well show ‘em a war documentary and follow it up with kinky erotica! Great movie, though.”
There is the gratitude you have for a hero and the gratitude you have for friends, family members (as long as they are not people like my father) and partners. The latter one is the category of gratitude that I feel for you. If my feelings about you are a big bouquet, gratitude is but one blossom, and there are so many more.
He settled somewhere in the middle, putting the lowest-toothed gear directly against the handle. On the same hex-shaped axle, he placed a medium-sized gear. Next to it, he slid on a spacer and fit a small gear against the medium gear. Lastly, he placed a large gear on the same axle as the small one and connected it to a final small gear that ran the pulley, so that one rotation of the handle would result in the pulley moving the bucket ten or so circumference-lengths of the starting gear.
“Who made you king. I’m sick of your little posse acting like it owns this place!” Ed retorted, his voice bitter and patronizing.
Malfoy’s forehead is furrowed so tight that the rain has begun to gather between the knits. In his palm, slick and shiny and freckled with mud, is a garnet stone. The dam in Harry crumbles.
His arms land on either side of Harry’s face. His lips are red and swollen from being kissed and bitten and the sharp tendons of his neck are stark and strained. His head is thrown back in ecstasy, but his emerald eyes are wide open. Draco takes a moment to just stare-- even if he could look away, he wouldn't.
My magic, however, is out of control. It is as if it is restless, foreign, constantly leaping from the tips of my limbs and creating an aura around me that refuses to still. I can perform all kinds of wandless and wordless spells, shape the world as I go with an almost innate kinship to the electricity that brushes my skin. I am, in lack of a more suitable adjective, conductive.
Malfoy’s laugh is the kind of laugh that floats, bubbly and delighted. He gestures for Harry to go first in a bow of playful chivalry. Harry hops the rail, sliding onto a velvet cushion. It is only when Malfoy joins him that he realizes it slants towards the middle.
“Beyond some kind of toad? No,” Draco replied, shaking his head. “But look at him, Harry. He’s quite sweet really.”
Because there was an odd and constant glimmer over the lid of Ichabod’s tank, almost imperceptible, but Harry knew a powerful glamour when he saw one.
“How do you do that?” is all he can think to ask. “When you Apparate, it feels like a plane taking off. ‘Mione says I’m like a helicopter in a hurricane.”
Oblivious to Ron’s tomfoolery, Harry grins. “I thought you were savouring your last week with a bachelor pad?”
Walburga and Orion Black didn’t care about harming people-- even people who were Blacks by blood. I have good evidence, from both my own research of family curses and through discussions with my mother, that a curse was placed on the house by Walburga and Orion with the sole purpose of emotionally stressing those they thought enemies.
My Floo address is 687 Evans Ln, Devon, England. If you have any tests for me, you may bring them by hand at any time. I would prefer if you came alone and did not share this address with anyone else. Although it may be an inconvenience to you, please do not send anything heavier than parchment with Desdemona; her leg is still healing.
“I will, then.” Malfoy’s grip on his arm is punishing, and it shouldn’t feel nearly as good as it does. A rush goes through his head when they emerge from the back door of the club and into the quiet. Even with the blaring cab horns and lights of the city, Harry’s ears ring and his skin prickles. Without flashing lights and moving bodies to surround them, Malfoy’s presence is stronger by a hundredfold.
at her feet. She beams up at him from beneath the rim of a floppy teal sunhat, radish earrings poking out the bottom along with a messy plait blond hair. She has woven daisies into her braid, and the faces of the flowers follow Draco as he moves. Magical plants have always struck him as creepy, but on Luna they’re rather whimsical. He wonders if this is how Harry sees them-- if this innocent, bubbly joy is why he loves gardening so much.
He, Hermione, and Harry (who was involved in the project much more than was probably legal) had decided to test if certain artifacts (Stonehenge, Easter Island, etc.) might have been built along these magical currents, or Ley Lines, and if they were used by ancient societies to harness magic, similar to the way that modern wizards used wands. They thought that if they could better understand how different cultures had controlled magic, they could reverse engineer the core components  of magic.
The production crew rolled out a set of wooden ladders, allowing each contestant to climb up and settle atop their poles. Draco had drawn green. Directly adjacent to him, Harry was on red. He wrapped his legs firmly around the structure, slotting his thighs and arms along the sharp divots in the beam. Locking his ankles together and his hands over his elbows, he tucked his head and braced himself for the long-haul.
“I spent eight years in Hawaii spearfishing! I don’t know why you think you’re so superior that you can waste everyone else's time and energy. You haven’t done jack but lounge and argue since we got to this god-forsaken rock, and now you decide to go fishing and
The spells dissipated abruptly, and it took several moments before the ringing in Draco’s ears and flashing in his retinas faded. He wrapped an arm around Harry’s waist and squeezed the polished Hawthorne of his wand in his fist. Taking a deep breath, he recalled the sensation of touching the periwinkle mist and apparated them away.
Draco whooped aloud. “You were right all along! Look at that.” He untied the twine with shaky fingers, letting it unravel. When the velvety white petal of a magnolia flower landed atop his head, he laughed, leaving it there out of sheer, playful joy.
CJ’s handsome face was frozen in a stunned stare. He appeared to be buffering. For all Draco knew, he might have been; he sure
He shrugged. “I haven’t-- I mean. It worries me, you losing weight. I don’t want it to take you back to anywhere bad.”
They lost the round regardless. When they lost the next one, too, Draco was relieved. He just wanted it to be over. Jeff dismissed them with a solemn nod and a “got nothing for you,” and, for once, it struck Draco as more smarmy than charming.
Tara was out seconds into the second phase of the challenge, which tracked, given how scatterbrained she was. Meanwhile,  Draco, lost in his own world, felt the bare bones of resentment in the back of his mind. Later he decided it was because he hadn’t wanted her to be the first to touch the food.
Jeff’s eyebrows raised comically into his hairline. So did Claire’s. It was either a very good sign or a very bad sign. His muscles bunched beneath his clothes and his skin suddenly felt far too tight.
The tugging comes every night for a week. Harry struggles to sleep; struggles to eat; struggles to escape his mind. In surrender-- or, if he has energy left to lie to himself, rebellion-- he stops trying.
Halfway into the 4th round, three players dropped. A burly man from the opposite tribe, Jessie, and Lonnie all nearly missed a catch, fumbling to place the ball on top and failing to notice when a ball landed in the sand beside each of them with a flat ‘plop.’
Harry laughs. “I’ve been pawning them off to friends and neighbors. But I’ve been meaning to ask-- is there any way I can have space on your porch for the flower bed? Shit, and I really can’t part with my Madagascar Palm. Or the violets, or my peperomia, or the Saguaro I grew from seed. And my pitcher plant-- I promise it won't try to bite Pansy’s crup again. Fuck, I hate to ask this of you, Draco, but it would mean a lot to me.”
“You don’t have to vote for her,” Harry said, kneeling down to comfort him. “They’ll likely want to go for you at four, and they won’t have numbers if I flip.”
Draco has two weeks before Harry moves in; two weeks to transform his 20’ by 20’ terrace of brittle grass into a proper gardener’s haven. “Sure thing,” Neville says.
She stared at the ground, fiddling with the end of her blond ponytail, coarse and ashy from salt and sand. “Okay.”
“Second vote: Isabelle. Will not count.” Draco could tell this one was Jones’s from the soot stains. He let some of the tension ease from his shoulders. Harry grasped his clammy palm tightly.
“Marissa is too wily for her own good. That girl is ice cold,” Ben said, and Draco found his connotation a little demeaning. Gender equality, evidently, was not America’s forte.
He shakes his head. “I’d rather be shocked than sent back to old wounds. Other people’s old wounds, especially. Even if it’s horrible, I’d rather hear about something I’ve never heard before. All the other types of suffering and whatever-- remembering they exist helps. Not much feels new these days. Which is funny, I guess, because I’ve hardly experienced anything at all.”
“Doug especially seems to be the odd one out. He seems to have staunch ideas about how he wants things done and he expects us to follow. I understand why he seemed reasonable at first, but I don’t think it’s in your interest to continue playing with him. He doesn't do well in challenges, and, after the merge, things won't get better. No matter what, the attention will always be on him, if only for his size, and that’s enough to make him a winner contender. He’ll always be right at the forefront of the game if we don’t do anything about it. Also, just think. He doesn’t need the money; the guy made weekly showings on ESPN for 20 years. He’s got cash and then some.”
Ian dove for the next rope, needing two breaths to get it untied, and Draco looked across the water to check the other team’s progress. His heart sank; they were already throwing for the upcoming platform.
Harry sniffed, and Draco softened, pulling him close. “Oh, baby, he’ll still be there when we get home.”
“Look, Draco. I don’t know whether Jones is right or wrong, but I’m here if you need to talk to someone, whatever it may be. He’s a bigot, plain and simple, and it’s people like him that made it so I felt like I couldn’t come out until I was 46. We’ve been trying to get him out for weeks now back in the other camp, but the bastard won't budge, so if anything happens, you make sure to come to me.”
Of course I’m up for going to Grimmauld Place with you. Despite it being my great-aunt’s place, and her being alive when I was little, I’ve never visited. She wasn’t someone whose company anyone enjoyed, and Mother would always arrange meetings with her in a way that a house elf could take me to my rooms or Florean Fortescue’s after the obligatory ten minutes on her doorsteps.
He stumbled slightly as he dashed past Potter, dropping the tarps on the green rug before circling back behind where the East Coast tribe was guarding their spoils. He ducked behind a crate, studying what they had collected before settling on a small set of iron pots. As soon as a smart-looking woman in a navy blazer and a very large, athletic man in his early forties turned their backs, Draco took his shot, racing in from the side and snatching the pans before twisting out of reach and closing the distance back to his tribe. He flung himself over the woven rug just as the whistle blew.
“Shhh,” Harry says, “I’ll be right there. Just need to water the sweet peas before the sun goes down.”
By the time Draco drags himself out of Harry’s arms and his promises of blueberry pancakes, it’s past ten in the morning. Neville has probably been at his house for an hour.
Draco bit his lip. “Thank you. And I will. He’s right, I mean. I am, and I’m out, and this isn’t my first rodeo.”
“I’m doing it now,” Draco replied, pulling out his own wand. He pointed it at the tank and performed the spells he knew would create a constant damp atmosphere within the walls. “I wonder what temperature we should go for…”
Harry whimpered helplessly, lips rising to meet Draco’s and tongue licking into his mouth. The production staff looked at each other, setting their cameras with red lights blinking and making themselves scarce. With a snap of Draco's fingers, two of the cameras turned off, the others turning slightly so they only captured the back of the wicker settee.
The lack of melodrama made Draco nervous. A comfortable game did not make for good TV, and something was bound to give.
Draco forced a smirk to his face, the strain of it on the sunburnt skin around his mouth causing a thousand tiny needles to poke his cheeks. “Like I said, Jeff, just stretching.” He yawned exaggeratedly to prove his point.
“Ron,” Harry cut him off. “The kids are 5. Or 9. Or 2. They don’t care. They just like watching Ms. Trunchbull get socked with tomatoes and chalkboard erasers.”
The holly wand is pushed back into his palm, but Harry doesn’t break the Incarcerous binding their wrists. “Christ,” Draco says. “Where’s that blunt?” He yanks Harry to his feet by the arm fast enough to hurt.
I rarely leave my home, mostly out of the risk of losing control and either becoming stranded somewhere entirely incapacitated or creating a public spectacle. Because of this, I am often restless, and struggle with some serious attachment issues..
They waded along the seam where the ocean met stone, soggy shoes weighing them down but protecting their toes from razor-blade volcanic pumice. Isabelle stopped at a narrow out-jet of the island. A massive tulip tree learned over the edge, dropping petals that frosted the slightly-slabbed cliff face.
“The rock. It has to be the rock. Like how fat cells in the body store energy. It’s one massive fat cell storing magic.”
Harry swallows and sighs. “Trust me, I know.” He places his wand in Draco’s open hand, looping his fingers tight around Draco’s wrist and securing them together with a spell.
This chapter contains some darker themes. Content warning for brief homophobia, nightmares, and mention of past trauma and mental/physical/magical health issues.
“What--” Harry hesitated-- “What if there just isn’t a Ley Line here. You should have found it by now.”
Draco brought his fist down against his thigh in a desperate explosion of frustration. “No! I felt Ley Line magic in the stones. It has to have come from somewhere. Maybe they can harness power from further than we thought.”
Malfoy laughs bitterly. “Yes, I can’t think of any better way to repent. A fucking drink, really? Do you also want me to pick up garbage on the highway? That’ll really turn me around.”
“I don’t get it!’ he exclaimed. “I can feel a magical presence on the stone, but it doesn’t react to the external energy field at all. If it harnessed power from Ley Lines or currents in the Earth, we should be able to feel it connecting to spell magic, but it just isn't! I’ve tried weather charms, banishments, acceleration charms, anything I can think of that transforms the magical atmosphere and
Draco nearly gouged his eyes out. “Tara, I need to go get more water. Why don’t you stay here and discuss it with Ed, okay?” he said with strained cheer. Tara could probably tell he wasn’t sincere, but he figured she didn’t have the tact to do anything about it.
Draco was chosen to run. He might have liked to do the puzzle, but Isabelle had offered, and he wasn’t inclined to draw attention to himself. It was just as well anyway; he was quite good at running. He clocked about 30 miles a week back home.
“You didn’t hear that Harry spent a night in hospital, then?” Draco asked, giving Harry a sideways glance. “Or that we’ve been bringing chaos wherever we go?”
P.s. I think Desdemona likes you. She seems particularly eager to leave today. Let me know what kind of owl treats you stock; I just might have to buy some myself.
From there the strange happenings only got worse. On Sunday, Harry returned from the gym to a cloud of green floo powder, the entire pot having been tipped at the foot of the mantle. On Tuesday, the mail arrived shredded. On Wednesday, they received a Howler from the post office stating that no abuse of Ministry owls was to be tolerated and that they would be receiving a hefty bill to cover the vet bills and feather-regrowth potion. Harry was horrified, but when he ran to make a care package for the injured owl, he found his owl-treat stash overturned down the toilet.
anything until you manipulate it and it induces a force. So what can store a magnetic force just inside itself? It can’t just be that the donut-hole in the Rai stones creates a polar equilibrium, it has to be inside the rock.”
You shagged me until I felt absolutely boneless, but now, just an hour later, I still feel too happy to sleep. But, as I see you now, sleeping in my bed with a smile on your face in the dawn-light, and healthier-looking than I have ever seen you, I just want to capture this moment forever. If you wake up now, and I’m not here, I’m just in my study to get my sketch block and oil pastels. I’ll be back in a moment, love.
In fact, I’m sure I’m on my way home now. At any moment I’ll appear, naked and bearing food and really, really needing to touch you.
The entire way home, he and Draco pre-occupied themselves by silently glaring into each other’s frowns. If conversations were occurring around them, neither noticed. It was quite pathetic, and exactly why Draco had fallen in love in the first place.
Four high platforms stood at the center of the beach, held up by three posts and a narrow spiral staircase. At the top, a stack of wooden gears were stacked neatly and a bucket was suspended from a beam and a rope. At the base, outside of a circular fence enclosing the suspended bucket, sat a large jug and a second small bucket.
Rocks, it turned out, was sort of a broad search area. “Landmarks,” he muttered. “We should look for landmarks.” Iz bounced on her heels excitedly, and Draco smirked, rolling his eyes. “Play it up a little more for the cameras, why don’t you,” he teased.
“I wish more people would come,” Harry says. “The emptiness at meals reminds me of everyone who’s missing.”
Draco looked down at the toad in his arms and smiled to himself. It was a turn up for the books, really, he thought. He wouldn’t have dreamed of handling a toad when he was a student at the school, but there was something about this particular toad that had captured his attention. It was almost calming to see him just sitting placidly in his tank, and Draco thought he could watch him all day, if given the chance.
Immediately after the War, I fell into a depression that sapped me to my core. I was unable to perform even the simplest of spells, and developed such vertigo when walking or running that I was unable to stand most days without blacking out.
Harry Potter is there too, his unruly curls flattened down with a net, a cropped brown wig on top. His costume consists of black jeans and a denim jacket. Green eyes meet grey as the curtains open. Blinding lights and 300 cheers spur the actors on..
As you and I have a fraught past with each other, I would like to bring in the help of my psychology mentor, Dr. Cordelia Bulstrode, Millicent’s aunt. She is a Squib, so she studied psychology at a Muggle institute, but she still knows about the War and is part of the wizarding community. I already spoke with her, and she would gladly make an appointment with you if you choose to do so. She would give me a generalized emotion profile (only things you consent to let me know) and do ordinary trauma therapy with you, which I think could help you learn to manage and de-escalate when your magic goes hay-wire.
“Draco,” Harry started tentatively. They sat on the beach, mild disillusionment charm over them to ward off the film crew. “Claire wants to vote out Isabelle.”
Then was CJ. “Claire,” he began, “You were part of the alliance with Jones, but you never made an attempt to play a move against him, even when it became clear he was a threat. Did you consider trying to orchestrate something on your own, or were you committed to stay loyal to him until he inevitably turned on you?”
He shook his head. “No, no. I’m sorry. You hit a sensitive subject. I should probably get up anyway. Let’s go for a walk?”
classic? Shouldn’t it be in the adult section? It’s wasted on those kids. Seriously, it’s a profound masterpiece of child psychology and trauma exploration. Have you heard the theory of Matilda’s powers being an allegory for-- nevermind. You of all people should get it, really--”
“I would be remiss if I did not mention Isabelle. I maintained multiple positive social relationships throughout the game, from my strategic alliance with Lindsay and Marissa in the early days of Tribe West, making the move to vote out Doug, to the post-merge, with my friendship to Lonnie and Harry. Beyond these superficial alliances, though, my relationship with Isabelle proves that I am capable of true teamwork.
Draco peers down from above through his legs, perched in a precarious half-split between two volumes. “I’m a fast learner, Potter,” he drawls. “Grab a quill and take notes.”
Draco was unaware she had even made a mistake, he was so wrapped up in keeping his game alive. He thought fleetingly that life would be much simpler if all he had to worry about was running from one side of a maze to another.
“I hope you are prepared because your first Challenge will begin right now--” there was a collective gasp-- “before either tribe has had the opportunity to introduce themselves. Stashed around this schooner are items you will need at your camps. Working as a team, you will race to collect as many items as possible and place them on your tribe mat. Tribes may steal from each other, so you will need to designate guards to protect what you have collected. The challenge will run for 2 minutes, after which you may bring whatever is on your mat back to camp with you. Take a moment to talk strategy, and then we will begin.”
Harry rubbed at the raw skin absently, with a half annoyed, half fond expression on his lips. “So what do I do?”
Jeff eyed them with perplexed enjoyment, his forehead knit in befuddlement. “Draco showing his first sign of discomfort, sparking a bit of a catfight.”
Behind the sheet, Bill picks up a modified squirt gun, counting down from three on his fingers. The cameras once again zero in on Harry..
He feels more than sees the flash of movement from the direction of the trail. Malfoy approaches cautiously, stiffly. He sits neatly, cross-legged.
“Where I feel the strategies differ is in execution. When one operates on instinct, they lose the ability to plan ahead and, therefore, to understand which ideas fit with their overall gameplay. This can hurt socially, strategically, and emotionally. Because I maintained a logical awareness of myself and others, I was able to better grasp the consequences of my actions.”
Jeff Probst greeted them with a winning smile, his khaki button-down and undeniable charm colouring the atmosphere even more thrilling.
“If you say so,” Draco said. “Alright, what kind of enrichment should we give him? Do you think he’d like a cave?”
On the upside, I have seen it myself now and, if you give me permission, I can send a house-elf that comes from an elf family bonded to the House of Black to retrieve the artifact, so I can destroy it.
Jones, however, was not content with these odds. He pulled Draco and Isabelle aside. “Jessie was talking to you,” he ground out, his deep-set eyes surrounded by racoon bruises and creased into a permanent frown.
He had woken up that night with a sore throat and dry tongue and, wandering towards the well, had found Harry leaned against a tree. Tears stained his face and one contact was stuck in the far corner of his eye.
If you agree to give my secretary your Floo address, I will have her send you several testing items with instructions. They are a bit heavier than what your owl ought to carry. The tests are simple charms and transfigurations you have to cast on the items and then send them back through the Floo.
Draco looked around. Time was running short, and the others were catching on, beginning to listen in. “Plan,” he said.
I didn’t know if you would ever say it back. I would forever have accepted giving my love and getting your time and your trust in return, but your love is a dream come true.
Draco frowns, confused. Every meeting with Neville he has had over the past week has left him more baffled than the last. Men and their hobbies… “Yes. I have no idea what would grow-- I suppose I could look at the bed on Harry’s balcony, but what if--”
Harry is frozen, mouth slack and breathing fast. He makes a fuss about adjusting his pants. The audience has exploded into hysteria.
Draco sighs, but sets the plant by the fountain. Harry thinks Neville’s gifts are odd in an endearing way. Draco thinks they are just odd-- and no amount of doe-eyed-ness is going to make him change his mind about that.
I cannot thank you enough for agreeing to work with me. We have a contentious past, and I am grateful that you seem willing to put it behind us. I appreciate your concern for my well-being, as well as for the compliments and understanding. If you insist upon, as you put it, treating me as a human being, I beg you to forgo any special treatment or pity. I do not want to be patronized or idolized.
Draco. Awake Draco would say you liked my muscles or something. Awake Draco wouldn’t call me pretty.”
Mr. Potter, if anyone deserves happiness and good magical health, it is you. You gave your everything for a society that used you as a means to an end. I will do all I can to help you, and I wish I could do more than just this.
Draco cast his Patronus into the warm night air, sending his heron soaring above the trees. A moment later, Harry stepped out from around a bush, a grin on his face and hand hidden behind his back. He must have Apparated several meters away so he could make a grand entrance.
“Here,” he said, pointing. “This spell causes areas with strong magical residue in the atmosphere to emit a vibration. It essentially works like sonar. The historical presence of magic needs to be very strong for it to work, as it reacts with the by-product of spell energy, but if we do it right, it should lead us to where ancient inhabitants of the island lived. Magic goes through a sort of radioactive decay, so it should pick up magic from even thousands of years ago, but the older the residue, the lower the frequency of the response. We’re trying to look for something that is within the past few hundred years, but not too concentrated.”
There is a tugging in his chest, a black molasses ache seeping up from his mattress and into his bones. Harry sits up in bed, drawing his knees to his face. His eyes are stuck shut. When he shifts, every muscle in his chest feels sore. He has never considered himself particularly sentimental, but tonight everything is
It’s not Malfoy’s words, but the way he says them-- posh accent, mannerisms dripping with sarcasm, wicked wit-- that makes Harry laugh out loud. “Christ, I should have offered dinner and a movie.”
The limestone walls were high and mossy, slick with trailing vines and a seasonal stream that dribbled a rhythmic ‘tap tap tap’ against the rocky soil at the base of the walls.
Harry unlocks his feet, whining and bucking up for leverage. Draco catches each leg, massaging and kissing the muscles before swinging them over his shoulder. Harry shudders, his heels digging into Draco’s back as he uses the new position to thrust up unevenly.
Harry catches him as he goes limp. “I changed my mind,” he mumbles. “I like dance classes. Dance classes are good.”
Malfoy laughs, low and loud. “How was I meant to say no? Besides, I was curious. I’ve been trying to get your attention for years.”
Harry gave him an incredulous look. “Don’t use words like persnickety. It’ll turn people off of you,” he muttered.
In order to uphold the Statute of Secrecy in the presence of muggles at both my job and university, I began to rely on potions to mask my magical activity so that it was more difficult for others to detect. When my control over my magical impulses began to rapidly decline, I regularly abused the potion, intentionally overdosing so that I myself could no longer connect to my magic either. This was a short-term solution to keep up with my heavy workload but ultimately resulted in me being forced by my friends, family, and professors to take an indefinite leave of absence.
“Always so sentimental. One would think you had a childhood trauma,” Draco teased, petting his husband’s jaw once more before retreating.
tell me about how happy she is (but you might know about the other side of that love story already).
There is a drawn out silence. Harry has spent the last month wishing Hogwarts wasn’t so quiet, but, in this moment, it feels fitting. He supposes Malfoy is thinking. Harry, though, is just staring in awe.
He is still so very tired, and so very in love, and for a few fleeting moments, he wonders if he’s going to fall asleep while inside, if they ever get there. But then Harry’s hot, insistent lips meet his, and his hand trails to cup an arse cheek on its own accord, and it’s fucking bliss.
He sprints into the house, skidding to a stop in the living room just as the image of Harry’s head solidifies in the fire. Harry raises his eyebrows at Draco’s flustered arrival and the streak of mud on his cheek.
“Model,” Iz corrected. “And she only does that part time to pay for her english BA. Did you ever even talk to her?”
Draco clasped their hands together, spinning Harry slowly to imaginary music. They waltzed to the melody of waking birds, and when Harry set his chin on his shoulder, Draco whisked them away and back to camp.
“You can hold him and I’ll enlarge the tank,” Draco said, a smirk tugging at the corner of his mouth as he turned to Harry once more.
“Next?” Harry says. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry.” The chair screeches on the stone as it’s pushed back. Harry takes a last frantic look behind him and swings open the heavy door. The panic doesn’t retreat from his joints until he has collapsed in the clearing—his clearing, and Malfoy’s clearing. He’s slumped against a tree, fighting to draw air into his lungs. His foot skids through a patch of loose upturned dirt.
You deserve all the love and caring, never forget that. My intention with this is to remind you that they don’t patronize you or idolize you, but that they took you into their family. You deserve a family who takes care of you when you need it.
He shoves through the crowd, colliding head-long with a dancer at the base of the stairs, and he man lets out a surprised grunt as his arms are forced around Harry’s shoulders. Draco appears from behind the curtain, cup of water in one hand and still slightly out of breath. His laughter is bright and exhilarated between pants. “Unhand my husband, Jordan,” he snickers.
Harry snorts. “Oh, and be careful of the mantle when you come through. I have a bunch of philodendrons propagating in vases. Don’t knock them over.”
“You reach your magic that far into the ground, it might never come back. You're exhausted. Back off. Please, Darling.”
“Draco, I don’t even know what this thing is!” Harry exclaimed, holding the tank up to eye level and peering in again. “Do you?”
Malfoy, the truth is that I am desperate. I am desperate, and you are brilliant. I do not assume that you could fix me, nor that you would want to, but I do believe there is possibility for a symbiotic relationship. I can finally begin to move forward, to make an attempt at clawing myself out from this hole I have dug, and you can study the shell casing of what once was the greatest feat in magical dark-arts history.
Draco rolled his eyes as the bell rang. “Right, I’ll see you at the end of the day. I’ve got some first years to scare now.”
“Figure-four or Lay-back?” Draco asks. His hair flops over his face, mussed by calloused fingers and exposing a violently purple mark already blooming beneath his ear. His words tickle the rough skin of Harry’s jaw, left hand exploring the expanse of golden chest but right still cupping his cheek.
Harry bores everyone but Neville with an in depth explanation of the garden layout. Which is ironic, considering Draco’s favourite part of the garden is that it barely has a layout at all-- everything is wild and organic and beautiful.
“I love Survivor. I am a student of the game, and my greatest inspirations are those who were able to seamlessly play to their personal strengths and maintain control over their own destiny until the very end. I played smart, consistently, and efficiently from the beginning, and, although I never lead a majority alliance, I never once let my actions, relationships, or performance be manipulated or become irrational.
He frowned. “That’s… oddly flattering that they think I’m that good. And I’m better at puzzles than Iz. It’s not my fault that beating people up is part of her job description.”
“It’s fine, we can just enlarge this one,” Draco said, glancing at Harry over his shoulder. “That way it stays familiar to him, just bigger.”
By noon, everyone was fed and watered, and the dishes were cleaned and put away (by a tired Ron, happy to have a second to himself while Harry and Luna entertained the kids). By two, mud tracks trailed up and down the hardwood floors of the cottage and a foot-deep hole had been dug with sand-box shovels in the garden by Jake, Ellie, and Teddy as they hunted for worms. By four, Hugo had fallen asleep on Luna’s lap and Harry was sweaty from participating in more rounds of freeze tag than he could count. Even Rhea, Nikhil, and Rose’s boundless energy was beginning to fade. Harry decided it was high-time for a movie.
“Okay,” Draco said. “I still wouldn’t touch it.” He approached the stone cautiously, casting his diagnostic spells from a sizable distance.
I don’t know if I love you, because I don’t know what love is. There are days when I need to be reminded that I am made of flesh and blood at all.
“Of course, of course,” Hagrid replied. “Meanwhile, I’m sure he’ll be fine hopping around the house.”
When it was Draco’s turn, he pulled Hermione in for a long hug. “I’m finding what I came here for, but I don’t quite feel fulfilled yet,” he said, hoping she would catch his drift.
When he saw it, he knew. The ghostly white trunk of a broken tree ducked headfirst into the surface of the creek, dozens of shelf fungi and vines circling its girth. At the base, a beautiful, broad mango tree rose above the canopy, wide green leaves glossy under the sun. The tree appeared to have once been a single specimen, with two sister trunks growing from a striking Y, but one had succumbed to the pull of gravity and fallen, while the other still stood proud.
Dear Harry, however you reply to my letter, you can rely on my dedication to helping you get well. I long for your love, hope for your friendship, but if you want to limit our interactions to the professional, I will resign myself to accepting that.
Malfoy shrugs. “Weather magic runs in the family. I don’t need spells for intuition. Anyway--” He holds out his hand in expectation. “Wand? Let’s go.”
Their heads careen towards the deck of a balcony, and Malfoy grips his hand. In the second before impact, they flip upside down, twirling away, and Harry whoops. They were never in any danger at all. And if they were-- well, there’s a freedom in that, too.
“I’m sure,” Jones said. I can read those fuckers like a book. They snuck off with her and came back looking mighty pleased with themselves. God I wish I could slap that stupid smirk off the cop girl.”
She studied his face, wincing slightly as her skin knit back together, leaving a fresh, pink, texturized layer in its wake that stood out starkly against her dark complexion. “That’s impressive. Wandlessly, too. I can’t thank you enough.”
Draco shakes his head languidly, Harry’s chest so broad and warm, his touch so gentle. He is so tired, his magic so sapped. “Garden,” he murmurs, eyes falling shut. “Look at the garden.”
Harry sat down beside him. He was slumped against the Rai stone, eyes clamped tightly shut and mouth dry from minutes of heavy panting.
house now, Harry. I love you-- and that means I love that you love your hobbies. There’s room for both of us. I wish you’d just talked to me.”
His wand was clamped between his teeth, but he slid it out with his left hand. “Where does it hurt? Tell me where it hurts!”
Harry pushed in beside him. “Hi. I’m Harry,” he beamed. Lonnie’s eyes lit up, and they launched into easy conversation about law enforcement training and youth and chess.
While I was able to wean myself off of the potions over several grueling months, my magic only worsened. This is when my magical core truly took on a mind of its own, much like an Obscurus, and was the start of my difficulties with eating and my violent magical outbreaks while sleeping.
Ball five was where things got even trickier. It was almost impossible to space the balls out, and what had once been a steady, melodic, catch-drop-turn-catch-drop was now a frenzy. Draco no longer had time to keep pace with his tapping fingers. Instead, he honed his attention on each ball as it dropped down the chute, the click of the junction alerting him to how long he had until another began to fall. It was an exercise in muscle memory, but Draco’s muscles had always been fast learners.
“Really?” Draco snapped. “That’s stupid. Lonnie is likable, and everyone on this jury is too much of an arse to vote for likable.”
Another question: are you the type of person who can sit calmly and watch an ant crawl across the meadow, or do you need to be in motion to wind down? I need to determine what kind of calming exercises are more likely to help you.
“I know, I know. But he did. I don’t know how he did it, but he was in the bedroom,” Draco said, reaching over to hand Harry his glasses. “You… tried to make a grab for him – leaving me thoroughly unsatisfied, by the way – but everything happened so quickly and all of a sudden you were unconscious on the floor.”
Luna arrived last, a wicker basket of storybooks in hand. She didn’t have children, and didn’t plan to, but she enjoyed giving Harry and Ron a hand-- especially on the first play-date of the season. Often, it was just Harry, Ron, Teddy, and Rose (and, recently, Hugo), but on lucky, wild, stressful days, they got the whole crew.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Yes, don’t worry. Here we go, Ichabod. Welcome to your new home,” he said, reaching into the tank once more and depositing the toad in front of the cave.
Potter gave him a disparaging look. “We’ve got three priorities; we need to be able to get away long enough every day to do our research on Rai stones, we need to stay in the game, and we need to pretend we don’t know each other. How do you suggest we go about that?”
Harry comes first, his knees falling to the side and quivering, tense shoulders smoothing from where they had bunched high and taut against his neck. He pants, whining with each exhale and eyes squeezed tight.
“I don’t know,” Malfoy says, “that sounds like a date. And dates always lead to sex when the bloke looks like me.”
sharp, but no matter how much he had himself fooled, a corner was always fuzzy, blindspots filled-in by his overactive anxiety.
“A camera,” she called, “It must mean we’re close.” She ducked her head to look at him, a grin splitting her face.
The advantage was a slim scroll tied plainly with taupe yarn. Himself, Isabelle, and Jones all put $500 up for it. Draco had zero grasp on the conversion of USD to Pounds, but he knew that, today at least, half a grand might as well have been the Gates fund.
Harry took the rope from a panting Isabelle, moving the ball from hand to hand to gauge its weight. Eying the target on the raft floating 15 feet ahead, he squinted through his contacts (Draco much preferred the glasses) and made an underhand toss, narrowly missing with a heavy clunk of metal on wood.
Draco thought about pulling his hand away and giving Harry the silent treatment on the implication that he should
“What happened to me-- what I did-- do you think it was tragic or beautiful? I’ve never thought of my life like that, never thought about if it means anything. Maybe I should.”
be,” Draco muttered, looking down at the toad too before sighing. “But you’re right. I suppose we do have to consider it, don’t we?”
The spires of the castle are a forest around them, each gargoyle and painted window shuttering and charmed gutter as intricate as the next, suspended in time as they rush and weave above the hidden hallways of Hogwarts.
Pansy had booked them a month-long stay in Fiji. According to the brochures in the lobby, it was a beautiful country, but Harry and Draco had spent very little time away from the bed, jacuzzi, spa, or restaurant. Draco had even convinced Harry to get a massage with him, but the fool had gone straight to the gym afterwards, and Draco had needed to give him another, more personal back rub when he wrenched his shoulder. “Well, I thought it was pretty self explanatory that you can’t exercise after having every muscle in your body pulverized!” he had scolded, and then proceeded to fuck the git into the matress.
“Iz, I got it. Fuck, we fucking got it,” he shouted, and she screamed in delight, urging him to come down and show her. He slid from the tree, landing heavily in a large leafy bush. Dignity be damned, he pushed carelessly through to the creek, letting twigs snag in his hair and mud dot his knees. He leaped down the embankment, stumbling when the stones he landed on shifted beneath his feet. Hand still clutching the Idol, he fell, barely saving his head from going under. Iz splashed him, and he laughed in delight, losing his footing twice more as he scrambled to right himself. They scurried back towards the beach, settling atop a slim fallen log in the middle of the island they had discovered on their way there.
“For the entirety of the game, I made an effort to get to know and understand everyone I met, while, at the same time, maintaining a constant core alliance. I feel I was the unifying force between the people I worked with, and I grew to care for all of them deeply.
therapists in business. Every time they would coax a spark to catch, Tara found a way to blow it out. In 20 minutes, they had burned through more kindling than Draco used in a month back home.
“What do you mean? Has something happened to Ichabod?” Draco exclaimed, voice full of worry as he took a step forward.
You told me that you use your mother’s scarf to calm yourself and that you anchored your magic in the woods. These are two good intuitive responses. One way I suggest we work on this would be to develop strategies to help your body learn that you are no longer at war. For this, I suggest we focus on watching your stress levels and finding ways to regulate them.
“I bet there’s an Immunity Idol near that weird tree,” Draco commented, but he trudged after his irksome husband, laden with empty buckets and a belly full of sizzling excitement.
Draco clears his throat. “I’m hoping to have my garden redone. It’s small, and I have plans drawn up here.”
Last but not least, does Desdemona like the protective ring? And do you like it? The rose quartz in it absorbs the surplus magic from your correspondences and gives it off gradually as a soft ray of light.
Draco’s lips on his skin are intoxicating, his nails combing over Harry’s scalp not nearly enough. “Please. Please. I don’t wanna wait, can’t wait.”
Incidentally, the most appealing activities after spending 40 days and nights in the boonies all involved beds: sleeping in beds, eating in beds, lounging in beds, reading in beds, and, yes, partaking in some very well earned, very satisfying shagging with one's extremely gorgeous, extremely lucky husband (in a bed).
“Do you see any,” Harry said. “If this was a town, shouldn’t the Rai stones be the center of the magical signature?”
Draco pushes in with a swift, smooth thrust. The friction is delicious, the slight burn a white-hot flash. Harry comes almost immediately.
“Oh. Sorry, sorry!” Draco apologized, vehemently begging forgiveness. “You looked okay, and I’m just so focussed. Merlin, are you--”
It shouldn’t have been possible to cast transparency charms with such ease, but Harry had always been the exception. Something about a childhood spent fighting off chunks of other wizard’s souls had made his magical core rather robust, albeit erratic. Harry was a beautiful, broken, wild force of nature. If he set his mind to it, he could bend mountains to his whim.
When Iz dropped, he and Marissa were left alone on their side of the clearing. Harry and Iz cheered him on from across the grass, but everyone else was so absorbed in their food they had all but forgotten that the first Individual Immunity was yet to be clinched.
a Hidden Immunity Idol. All votes cast for Isabelle will not count,” Jeff confirmed. His gaze followed Draco all the way back to his seat.
“Technically,” Draco said, “We only need to flip one person to force a tie, and at this point, it can barely be considered flipping. You will be our biggest asset, because, although
“Should we even try to keep the six together? Or is Jones too much of a wild card to bet on?” Draco whispered to Iz on the boat ride back to their old camp. They were being given 30 minutes to pack all personal items and supplies before waving their goodbyes and joining the rest of the contestants at the original East Coast beach.
Draco sighed, knowing a losing battle when he saw one. Harry would be asleep in moments, and he could go back to his anxious musing. He would need the practice time. Harry, on the other hand, was always better on the fly. Despite his insecurities, Draco had all confidence he could roll off the cot bedraggled and hungover and still blow the Jury to Mars.
“We’ve woven such a web of lies I’m starting to believe them myself,” Draco replied with a drily satisfied chuckle.
Harry’s shirt is rucked up his torso, stubbornly refusing to come off-- Draco has convinced him to always size a tad tight (
“Mmm. How did you find it?” Harry asks, gesturing to the upset earth with his heel. He’s in the mood for non-sequiturs.
We have no idea who Prongs was, but it’s most likely that they were a transfigurations student between 1963 and 1967, when, due to a book restoration project at the Merlin College’s library, many university students used the Hogwarts library. However, it could have been a young professor of another subject or (though admittedly unlikely) a Hogwarts student with a solid family background in Transfiguration and Potions.
Potter. Remember, we get voted out, we have to leave, and it’s going to be me saving your arse then. Your job is to help me work; my job is to keep us here. We make a good team.”
Secondly, Draco was delegated to build the fire. More specifically, he was delegated to build the fire with Tara. Tara was a scrawny, mousey-looking woman in the awkward stages of early middle age, and Draco found her intolerable. She was a physical therapist from Flagstaff, but Draco thought she was probably only still employed because she kept all the
Draco closed his eyes to think. The challenge would require a balance of three skills: gear efficiency, throwing accuracy, and climbing endurance. He would need to get the puzzle done quickly and then pace himself for the rest.
to look sexy, to feel sexy, and to do it right, and he had intended so for nine bloody months. Harry thinks a lot of things look good on Draco, but empowerment is one of his favourites.
He rubbed his temples, uncapping the comically large and cumbersome pen and inking a neat ‘J’ onto the parchment. He folded it carefully into thirds and placed it at the bottom of the intricately engraved jar.
In a shocking feat of athleticism, Jessie won the Immunity Challenge. The game involved stacking one inch by one inch blocks on an unstable table. The blocks were stored at the far end of a balance beam, which the contestants would have to cross between each block placement while using a rope to level the table. The first to build a tower a foot and a half high without stepping off the beam won. It was beyond frustrating, and took nearly an hour as each contestant toppled their progress over and over again. At one point, Draco thought he was about to win, but a miniscule wobble had him starting from scratch.
They had found another Rai stone a score of miles from their first, and they were meant to be comparing and contrasting the two. Instead, Draco brought them to the mouth of a cool, earthy, stream-eroded cave. He rounded on Harry with a violent sneer.
“Love you,” Draco breathed. “So bloody hot. So beautiful. Watching you win those challenges, god. Your fucking body. How have I gone without?”
Harry caught the next ring in 4 tries. This obstacle was a rope climb up to a slide, and Draco had been looking forward to it, thinking it suited his light frame and aerial arts experience (When Harry had joined a climbing gym, Draco had tagged along. He didn’t much like the bouldering part, but the gym had a room for silks, lyra, and trapeze, and Draco had gotten invested, taking multiple lessons a week) but when he finally began to pull himself up, he took no joy in it. He was frustrated with himself nearly to tears.
Harry scratched his neck. “What if we track magical signatures. If we look for traces on the island, we can probably find where there used to be towns or main traveling arteries. That should lead us to where stones were likely kept.”
Draco sighs, jaw set. He is going to have to switch tactics. “Fine,” he says. “I’m willing to pay whatever.”
Draco frowned. “Should we try to collect larger items like wood and fishing traps from the deck since they will be more difficult to steal? And then if they go for flint we can try to steal it?”
“Fine. Little Mermaid-- Chitty Chitty Bang Bang-- god, I forget every time how fucking weird that one is-- The Fox and the Hound--
He approached the ladder with confidence, but as soon as he stepped on, it swung under his weight, forcing him to clumsily scramble the rest of the way. Draco didn’t have time to be embarrassed for long. He lunged for the twine securing the tarps, working at a series of square-knots with his left hand and his teeth. He had almost every knot undone when the sturdy man with the Boston accent barged past him, shoving Draco’s arms away and tearing at the rope. Draco waited until the tarps came free and then snatched them back, dropping off the side of the ladder and hitting the ground at a sprint.
When anyone else does this sort of problem, Draco thinks they look a bit like a juvenile orangutan, but Harry-- half naked, back taut and rippling as his limbs bunch and unfurl-- is the sexiest thing he’s seen all month.
The end was anticlimactic. It took Draco several moments to realize he had won. Chest heaving, he let his balls drop one by one, the knock of wood hitting wood echoing briefly around him. He stared at them, shaking off the shock of returning to reality.
You mentioned your reactions to Okafor’s potions. It should not feel like that. I think we should talk about it more in person, and make an appointment with Okafor. Meanwhile it’s safer if you don’t take the potions.
Draco followed, still grinning to himself. He glanced at Ichabod over his shoulder, just catching a glimpse of him still sitting still inside his leafy new home before the door closed behind him.
Harry hugged Draco closer. “I’ve tried to think of everything to save him, but it seems like a lost cause. I don’t like endings. Or losing.”
The pitter-patter of rain against the window draws him out from the silence of Gryffindor Tower. The high Scottish air is thicker than usual with heavy drops and ambient mist, and Harry chases the smell of moss and life to the edge of the forest. He has left his cloak behind, and droplets tease the hairs on his arms and shiver after shiver runs down his spine. He has not felt so alive since he learned how it felt to die. He is too tired to think and too tired to try-- or even to not try. He is not himself, but he is alive.
I want to help you. I would want to help you if you were anybody, but even ten times more than that, I want to help you. It’s painful how harshly you speak about yourself, and how you suggest that you should be “dissected”. I can imagine with all the trauma you went through that you may feel separated from yourself, but no matter how broken you may feel, you deserve the best treatment and help available.I promise you I will do all I can, and I believe it will not need to feel like a dissection or an invasion of your magic or mind. Such a proceeding would do more harm than good. The treatment will look more like a gradual entanglement of the strands of magic in your core in order to find the best way to handle the unstableness.
Draco's heart pounded in his ears. Energetically, he turned to his tribe. “Okay. We should have two divers that trade off, but only one rope thrower because it will have a learning curve. Also, the strongest players should enter the obstacles first to demonstrate and work out the difficult portions. I think Iz should definitely dive, and Ian too--”
“Always,” Draco babbled. “Everything is spiked. Everything makes me love you.” He gripped Harry’s hips with bruising force, biting along his neck.
Draco froze. He didn’t know how he had missed it, but the light bulb had finally clicked above his head; the epiphany was triggered. He reigned back the probing exploratory tendrils of his magical awareness. “You gorgeous, gorgeous,
Harry was well-liked by everyone, whereas Draco’s more cerebral and assertive personality left him on the outs of the social scene. The only person who seemed to genuinely enjoy talking to him was Isabelle, and they spent long hours on the beach discussing strategy, university, and boyfriends.
And then I ruined my chances of a friendship with you by insulting people who were your friends. I ruined my chance to be your friend back then, but I could get your attention by being your "nemesis". What a prat I was!
“No, no, no,” Draco slurs. He leans heavily against Harry’s back, covering bespeckled eyes with mud-smeared palms. “Come with me. I have a surprise.”
A blustery wind blew through the camp on the 4th day of Survivor: Battle of the Coasts, and the balmy air smelled of rain and trouble. The dark skies matched Draco’s mood as he knelt in the abrasive sand from dawn to noon tending the fire. No matter where he moved, smoke followed him, making his eyes weep and his sinuses itch. He was sneezing constantly by the time Harry pulled him aside, the allergic reaction causing him to feel like ants had crawled into his ears and nose.
. I—what happened to summer of love? I thought we were leaving this all behind? Why did you have to dredge it up? We had a good thing going. Why did you have to make it real?”
He grimaced. “Yep,” he mumbled, turning his back to his husband and swimming for the dock he started on. Pulling himself up and onto his side, he staggered to his feet as both Isabelle and Ian made it safely across. Hell, even Tara succeeded first try. Drenched and dejected with the sour weight of humiliation in the pit of his stomach, Draco did his best to dry his shoes and wound himself up to go again. Harry held out his hand, and, letting go of the rope that kept the rafts connected, he stepped onto the obstacle for the second time. Using quick, light steps, he dashed from one side to the other, breathing a sigh of relief when his feet hit the softly bobbing planks of the other side. Harry gave him a reassuring smile, but Draco just shook his head; the obstacle wasn’t difficult; he had just psyched himself out and cost his tribe precious seconds. It was only the first challenge, and he felt he had already painted a massive, garish target on his back.
Also, I’m very glad to hear that you did not in fact date Jonas. He was a real prick, and deserving of almost no one. We only went on, like, 3 dates, and none of them were nice. Honestly, the sex wasn’t great either. Marginally better, maybe. You’d think the (ahem) experience would have given him an edge, but apparently not. I don’t know, though-- maybe I was the one who was bad. That whole situation was a cluster, but it was sort of nice to have regular-people problems for once.
Draco rolled his eyes. “We need to try something else. I don’t think the reaction was within the Rai stone-- the residue in the air is too strong. None of the Rai stone magic we’ve seen has left a trace. I think something has been placed to corrupt it. Can you break through curse walls?”
Isabelle grinned as she arrived in front of Draco, flowy jumpsuit and fresh cornrows giving her a happy glow. “Draco,” she said, “you know you have my vote. Instead, I would like to take this time to aid in your case. Jury, the most deserving here, undoubtedly, is Draco. I was with him through thick and thin, and he never lost his edge, his control, his wit, his attitude. This man embodies what it means to be a master of Survivor. He is a pioneer. Draco, I am so lucky to have met you.”
“Harry, if we're going to do this, you have to mean it. It can’t be a game, a rebellious bend to the dark side to spite whatever bullshit expected of you. You have to promise. You have to promise you’re serious,” Draco tells him at dawn.
His team cheered, and Draco couldn’t help a genuine grin from spreading across his face. He didn’t even care when Potter offered to help him up, just took the man’s hand in his own and stood to face the tribe. He had always been a little bit too competitive.
It was a memory game, and a hard one at that. A ring with a 50 foot radius was enclosed by a narrow-panelled fence. On the end closest to where Jeff stood, nine cubicles lined the outer rim. Ten other cubicles were spaced throughout the loop, five on the inside fence and five on the outside. Each was unpainted except for a stripe along the top. Within them there was a puzzle, ranging from simple mental math to counting the number of fish in a tank. The contestants were required to, for all ten stations, record the colour stripe at the top of the booth and the numerical answer to the puzzle inside of it. Once all 20 factors were correctly entered in clockwise order into a very long, very ornate combination lock, a bar would release, which the contestants could use to smash their tile, winning them Immunity.
I’ve got the lab analysis of your magic. The good news is that the basic physiological factors of your magic are all as they should be. The bad news is that there are significant problems with the emotional and hormonal factors.
I think that is perhaps why it is so exhausting to try to reign in my magic; limiting the reach of my thoughts is not suited to my brain. There’s a lot of things going on up there. Very little of it is of any substance, but it is there just the same. Movement is the only way I am able to quiet my mind or ensure that a lesson or memory sticks. Exercise helps me to focus--  there is something about the single-mindedness of physical excretion that soothes and grounds me. When I am able, I love to run the country roads or bush-whack through the woods near my house. I have even considered hand-building a labyrinth in my garden.
Harry groaned, closing his eyes and letting his head fall back against the pillow again. “Great. So what now? How long do I have to stay here for?”
During the years my magic began to act up, I was attending the University of Cambridge and working towards a dual diploma in the Magical Department of Education. I had hoped to become a certified teaching staff member at Hogwarts as a DADA professor. I also worked part-time in a local muggle cafe as a server, in the hopes of reconnecting with my muggle roots.
The winnings were a private brunch overlooking the ocean. Draco scarfed down pancakes and mimosas until Hermione cut him off. “You’ll make yourself sick,” she said. “You haven’t been eating enough.” She pulled a pastry from his grasp and assessed his body with a concerned frown. He gave a pained groan.
It had a sort of mandala etched into its mahogany surface, and Draco traced it with his thumb. “Dream come fucking true,” he murmured. He had the urge to look straight into the sun, pump his fists, and scream.
“So did lots of people. They thought it meant power, but it doesn’t. It just makes you feel like a stranger.”
He lies, bare back pressed to pock-marked, calloused stone, his chin to the clouds. The sun is clear with the cold whitish-tinge that, anywhere besides Scotland, would christen February. Harry’s eyes are closed, but pale blue horizon bleeds through his lids.
The moment his magic left his wand, a shattering crack reverberated around the clearing. Draco was thrown backwards into Harry’s chest as they both tumbled to the ground. Blinding white filled his vision and he blinked frantically, urging it away. He thought he heard Harry say something behind him, but the ringing in his ears made it impossible to be sure.
Please use this owl for all further communication with me. She will roost in the ministry owlery until Sunday, the 18th of this month. My home address will not be disclosed until after we have discussed my treatment. There is a reason I have maintained very little contact with the public in the six years since the War, and I would prefer to keep it that way.
Camp devolved into an absolute cluster. Jones paced back and forth, pulling one person aside at a time and cutting them off mid-conversation. Claire, Jessie, and CJ, Immunity Necklace still lying across his chest, sat in a scattered semi-circle by the fire, looking lost and alarmed as their leader spiralled and frayed.
Harry cheeks burn with a magenta flush. “Yeah, but you don’t just show up to a bloke’s house with a forest and a moving van. And you’ve never really seemed to like them, anyway.”
“I didn’t mean to hurt him,” Harry whispered, voice bitter. “It was an accident. I don’t know what happened. I was so mad. I dreamed about ants in the sand, but I didn’t feel them; he did. It’s because I love you.”
They round a corner, and Malfoy careens towards him, Harry’s arms held out to catch him before his brain can catch up. Malfoy lands heavy across his shoulder, and they tumble to the ground, Harry breaking the fall as they roll over and over. Gasps of “sorry” and “are you okay” are lost to the feeling of skin against skin against marble.
Draco waits a moment to follow, enjoying the mischievous satisfaction of playing hard to get. By the time he steps into the shadow of the overhung section, Harry has already pulled on.
