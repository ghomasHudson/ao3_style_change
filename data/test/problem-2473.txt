was headed, either. He hoped – well, he hoped. So doing anything without proper consideration would be the height of foolishness. And yet…
“Oh, uhm… Mr. Malfoy, what say we take this conversation over there,” he gestured to a nearby alcove, then turned back to the girl. “Trish, I need those things done. Today would be good.”
“But who else…?” His eyes searched Harry’s face desperately.
“It was a joke!”
Harry ran his thumb over the strip of skin between Draco's hand and his cuff.  “If we're going to do this,” he said softly, “I don't intend to hide.”
“That’s because his magic is stronger than most wizards,” Malfoy replied softly, laying Harry’s arm back on the bed.
“And seventeen-year-olds are so good at listening to their parents.”
Ron grimaced. “Oh, you’re right. Damn, poor kid.”
Hermione snorted. “Don’t let Molly hear you say that.
For just a moment, Draco thought that they might be able to pass with relatively little fuss. The explosion of sound that grew when the press realized that Potter was there put the lie to that theory quickly enough. Flash bulbs began to go off in blinding succession, and the noise level grew to a cacophony of sound. The people who had been the source of the presses interest before Potter had appeared were abruptly abandoned, including the Minister for Magic, as the group pressed against the ropes, camera's pointed, quills at the ready. Three burly Aurors, distinctive in the red robes, manned the ropes, and it was all they could do to keep the surging throng under control.
"I can manage a decent bolognaise, you know," he complained, but he couldn't really disagree. And who knew? Maybe there'd be trifle for dessert. After a Hogwarts dinner, his request that Al join him on a walk around the lake wouldn't even seem weird. "But I see your point. So – thank you for the invitation."
“How about this one?”
“But they took everything that wasn’t nailed down,” Draco turned to him. “I saw them do it.”
The elf disappeared with a pop.
“Do you want to have breakfast here, or down in the Great Hall?”
It was a little white cake, and on the top was written ‘Merry Christmas’. There were two small presents next to the red lettering, festive holly and ivy painted on the fondant, and a length of tartan plaid ribbon around the outside. Draco smiled, the plaid reminding him of McGonagall.
They embraced enthusiastically, patting each other on the back and laughing, then Bill held him back at arms length and studied him.
But after about four hours, he had to take a break; he wasn’t used to the level of noise a Weasley family gathering generated any longer. He’d lived where silence was so complete you could hear the cry of a lone coyote five miles away. He withstood it until his head was pounding, but then he’d surrepticiously grabbed a cup of cocoa and now sat, staring up at the stars. The constellations looked different here than in Montana, but they were no less vivid. What was very different was the sound of the garden gnomes bickering nearby in their incomprehensible language, and he grinned.
In addition to seeing the villagers for their pets, he had an equal number of large animal patients at the nearby farms and helped oversee the animals at Hogwarts. The baby Thestral who’d been so sickly was now a strong mare with foals of her own, the unicorns had moved far back into the Forest, and the Centaurs appeared occasionally, usually when Firenze had some completely incomprehensible prediction to depart.
Once they were outside, and walking along Diagon Alley in the cold night air, Draco began to regret his impulsiveness. What if he’d been too rash, what if he’d somehow embarrassed Potter? Damning his jealousy and impulsive outburst, he crammed his hands in the pockets of his coat and desperately missed the heat of Potter’s hand around his elbow.
Teddy had come to him and was tugging on the hem of his jumper, his brown eyes wide.
He hadn’t meant to say it, but it was out now, and had been on his mind for days. He leaned back in his chair, meeting Scorpius’s wide eyes.
“Oh, thank you so much,” Harry laughed. “I can dress without your assistance.”
“You’re tired,” Draco murmured. Something in his chest ached for a little Potter who had cried that hard, and he shook himself. “Listen, Potter, why don’t you try handing her to me while she’s still asleep, and then go and get some rest yourself.”
“Which is perfect for you. I’d like to see those.”
Alarm entered Amelia’s eyes before she ever touched Olivia’s face. When she did, she gasped.
He started to thank her when another voice interrupted.
"Slight of hand," Anya said wryly. "And Dragon treats. We need to name him, you know."
The one on the top was of Draco himself, wearing a voluminous pale green robe, his hands cupping his distended belly. It was the one and only photograph in existence that proved he'd carried Scorpius, taken two weeks before his son was delivered. His face was thin and haggard and he had dark circles beneath his eyes. He'd been so miserable. He'd had a very difficult time carrying the baby, but somehow he'd managed a smile for his mother. There had been so many times he'd thought to throw it onto the flames, but once again he just shifted it to the bottom of the small stack.
“You know I love you, but I don’t think you’re being very fair.”
All four walls were hung with clothes, clearly of a very nice quality, colour co-ordinated, shoes on racks along the floorboards. On the far wall, under a spotlight, hung Oliver's World Cup jersey, framed under glass.
"I agree. Now, the rest of you," he glared around the room. "Go back to sleep and, how do you put it now? Butt -- Out?"
Harry gestured behind him. “Hermione finally found a spell that would work for both of us about a decade ago.”
“He’s still here,” Harry said faint smile. “I thought he might have gone… somewhere else.”
~***~
She looked much as she had when Harry and Ron irritated her back at Hogwarts. “What I’d like to do is force her into her Animagus form, and then squish her.”
She shrugged one shoulder, her pink cable knit jumper a lovely shade against her tawny skin. Ron was away in France at a symposium, so Hermione was visiting Rose and Hugo for the weekend. Officially, just to prevent anyone from gossiping about her and the Headmaster, she was staying in guest quarters on the fourth floor but was with Harry if she wasn’t with her children. She crossed her legs on the seat cushion of her transfigured chair and gave him a patient, but expectant look.
“That's my sis, all right.”
“Absolutely not,” he answered firmly.  “She’ll recognize that it’s a platinum band, and you’ll be a hero.”
that made him cautious bordering on paranoid. Ron complained regularly about being unable to access his office. As his Deputy Head he had reason to complain, Harry supposed. He still wouldn't reset his wards.
It wasn’t that he was looking for some sort of lifetime commitment… but for some reason, even as the thought formed in his mind, a vision of Potter drifted through on its heels. Potter, who was his age, with children the age of his son, who had a shared common history (with a few minor differences, he thought wryly), and who was rather strikingly fit. His hair was still thick and black but for a few strands of silver, and his eyes… Draco sighed wistfully. Potter’s eyes; still green as leeks and thickly lashed in black, they could look right through him. Preoccupied, Draco was walking through the door to the bakery before he was even aware of it, startled out of his reverie by the tinkling of the bell overhead and the mouth watering scent of something baking. Something with cinnamon. His stomach growled, and he remembered he’d skipped lunch. He paused just inside the door, letting the fragrant warmth wash over him, admiring the tall Christmas tree in the corner hung with lavishly decorated gingerbread men. A smile tugged at his lips; there was one riding a broomstick, reaching for a fluttering frosting Snitch.
"I believe she's trying to save you from sticking your other foot in your mouth," Harry said bitterly. "It's not like wizarding England doesn't know I spend time on my knees, too."
"Fine. You know I don't care what you do, but there are other people who do."
Draco laughed, and curled his arm around her shoulders. “I do love you, you know,” he said, pressing a kiss to her forehead.
could possibly have to say,” he snarled. Hermione stood behind her desk.
For a moment it looked as if he might’ve actually hurt Malfoy’s feelings, but the thought was there are gone with the changing expressions on Malfoy’s handsome features.
Harry nodded and dropped into the chair on the other side of Ron’s desk. “If you’re offering.”
“Look at this,” Draco snarled, leaning over Harry’s shoulder and jamming his finger into the page. “Look at this!”
Draco bit back another comment as they each pulled out a chair. Scorpius winked at the waitress who was clearing their table, and Draco rolled his eyes when she blushed and walked away.
Draco’s breath caught in his chest. “Thank you, Mr Frombley. You’ve no idea what that means.”
Harry slept what felt like a very long time. Teddy reluctantly left when Draco gently told him Harry needed to rest, and he hadn’t even walked to the bed; merely scooted up on the chaise, put a small, soft pillow beneath his head and passed out.
Harry blinked. Had Malfoy just asked him a polite question? Out of habit, Harry stiffened slightly. He’d caught glimpses of Malfoy around, and they hadn’t had anything like a conversation in years, but old habits died hard.
“Oh, for fuck’s – “ Harry gave himself another moment for his hard-on to soften enough that he could adjust it in his pants, then strode briskly to the door, flinging it open.
“Off, how? Is it still burned out, or…?”
“It isn’t over,” he asked, lower lip thrust out.
Harry laughed at his petulant sound. “Believe me, so do I. But I can wait until you aren’t too tired to enjoy it.”
“There you are.”
Harry knew that his eyes had given him away when Leah's smirk faded and her mouth dropped open slightly. She reached behind herself and softly closed the door.  “Really?” She asked once there was no chance of them being over-heard.
"Oh, spare me. Poor Potter, stuck in a loveless marriage but still managed to fuck the ball and chain often enough to get another little Potter on her. You had the wife and family and the picket fence, and I had…" Draco bit his lower lip hard enough he drew blood. A spot of brilliant red welled beneath one of his bright white canines.
“I haven’t either,” Harry murmured, relieved to hear Draco say the same.
Harry eyed him, obviously mystified. “Where is this coming from?”
They turned at the interruption and found an older man standing behind them.
"We need a chair and a dinner set up added to the front table," Harry answered. "And Hermione needs to be brought up to speed."
!” She looked so excited but everyone, including the Malfoys, returned her look blankly.
“Yeah, I remember.”
“Nah, it’ll be fine.”
clung to the highest peak of Ginger Island. Simple stuccoed houses painted in bright pastel colors dotted the hillsides in clusters, and a few jagged little streets, veering this way and that, made up a wizarding neighborhood not unlike Hogsmeade. Of course, there was no snow on the roofs, but there was a Weasley Wizarding Wheezes right in the middle next to a Zonko's and across the street from Quality Quidditch. Sometimes it was a weird juxtaposition; days in the summer when the heat shimmered off the cobblestones. Even in December the sun shone and the beaches gleamed, and as Harry walked, the sleeves of his simple island button down fluttering in the breeze, his flip flops dangling from one hand.
“’You just’ what?”
Harry gave him an outraged look, then had to pick up his pace when Ron started walking again.
“I am.” Harry gestured toward one of the six high stools that ringed his centre island. “Have a seat.”
Relief made his knees weak, and he sat down hard on the sofa. “No, of course not.” He ran one hand through his hair, then looked up at his friends again. “So, if not the kids, then… what?”
“And this must be Mr. Lupin. Young man, it’s a pleasure.” She held out her hand, and Teddy looked at it, unsure.
Prompt used for this part:
Hermione was slightly entertained to see a pink stain spread up Malfoy’s neck.  “I know,” he said, clearing his throat. “But tonight I’ve nothing else going, and isn’t it your son’s birthday?”
“Oh yes, that’s all it takes. Outer wear for your sons.”
The sun was barely up, and the sky was a crisp, clear blue. It was cold, and as they left the manor the snow glistened pale, frosty blue and soft orange. The drive into town, particularly at the early hour, took about ninety minutes. When the chauffeur pulled into the passenger set down area of King’s Cross Station, Potter gave him a quick, disconcerted look.
“Do you want me to take care of that or not?” Malfoy asked wryly.
The white animal gave him a foxy grin, then turned and dashed across the wide lawn.
Teddy’s bouncing accelerated and he gripped their hands hard. “Look, Harry, look! It’s a train. A real train!”
During that year of sabbatical, while he had time to himself and while he went through the comforting motions of getting a cake in the oven or letting bread rise on the counter, Harry came to several decisions about his life. He’d thought to return to the Ministry when Lily went off to Hogwarts, but he no longer wanted to. He liked his privacy, he enjoyed the quiet, and not finding his face in the newspaper twice a week was a relief beyond description. Oh, his name still turned up in the
you I love you, and I’ve got your daughter in double potions after lunch. Somehow the brat always knows when… well, she knows, and she delights in smirking at me for two hours. So, later.”
Draco removed his glasses pointedly. “Who are you calling ‘Pops’? That’s disgusting. Were you raised in a barn?”
Frombley shrugged awkwardly. “I’ve no idea. We assumed he was lost at the Battle of Hogwarts, because we never heard from him again after that. I hope, in the end, he made the right decision about which side to fight on.”
Hermione and Ron were at the head of the line, smiling and shaking hands; it was a very big deal, after all, for a woman to become Executive Assistant to the Minister for Magic, especially one who had just turned thirty. She was second only to Kingsley, now, in Ministry hierarchy. He stood to next her, resplendent in his purple Wizengamot robes, his bald head gleaming under the lights from hundreds of floating candles. Ron was wearing actual formal robes, in a flattering navy blue, and stood on the other side of his wife. Hermione looked lovely in a bronze silk gown with gold stitching and rhinestones around pointed sleeves and scattered along the décolletage and the hem. Her hair was up in a sleek French twist, and Harry didn’t think he’d ever seen her look so lovely. He greeted Kingsley, then turned to embrace his friend.
“The vertebrae in question involve the root of two of the sciatic nerves. The L4 and L5 nerves control much of the feeling in the legs. With the current condition, he is experiencing a loss of feeling with sporadic pain from his lower back to his toes as the swelling lumbar disc pinches off the nerves. We’re doing everything we can to keep him comfortable, I promise you.”
“Dear God,” Draco muttered, his smile not reaching his eyes as he paused for the photographers. The flash bulbs were blinding, and Harry knew he was going to be seeing the bloody dots for the next hour. “There’s a color that doesn’t occur in nature.”
“Thank Christ,” he whispered back, and Harry could feel his hand was slightly damp, but it wasn’t the right time to tease him.
“Okay,” Harry said, noticing that Denny’s eyes were already taking on a visible yellowish glow, a side effect of the potion. They were also going slightly unfocused, and Harry hoped he could use that to his advantage. He pantomimed taking another drink while Dennis watched him with bald longing. “So, what’s this all about, Denny?” he asked, trying to sound friendly, holding the glass in his hand.
“Draco.” Potter’s other hand lifted and he cupped Draco’s face between his palms. He stared unblinking into Draco’s eyes. “My name is Harry.”
Harry opened the door with a flick of his wand, and they entered through the back doors of the Ministry main building in tandem. He squeezed on Malfoy’s wrist to stop him, and they paused long enough for Harry to flick his wand and lock the doors.
Potter had pushed up his sleeves, and his bare forearm brushed against Draco’s hand as the warm little body was exchanged between them. And just like the day in the courtroom at the Ministry, when their skin touched, Draco felt an undeniable jolt of – something. A tingling awareness that made the hair on his arms lift and the skin at his nape twitch.
It took him a couple of minutes, but he finally settled on “I need to see what I’m missing”. He knew it was lame, and that if the room ignored him, it was his own fault. It had always been the sticking point with the Room of Requirement; how to word what you needed. But he’d already thought it; if he passed the space three times and the door didn’t appear, he’d know the castle thought he’d lost the plot.
“Good morning,” Draco said. “Are you ready?”
“Of course he was keen to do it, Kingsley,” Harry growled. “He wants to restore the Malfoy name to something resembling respectability. Scorpius saw what having a grandfather in Azkaban did to his grandmother, he saw how hard Draco had to work just to function in the wizarding world. And not a bit of it was fair. Narcissa Malfoy saved my life and made defeating the psychopathic asshole possible; if Draco had revealed who I was at the Manor, the war would have been over then. If keeping me alive couldn’t restore their name, I imagine he was eager to do about anything
“Oh, my,” he heard Hermione breathe, but he didn’t glance her way. He was staring at Draco, trying to recall when he’d ever seen anything to compare to him in his life. He couldn’t think of a single thing.
Nearly as tall as he was and perfect in every detail was a gingerbread replica of his house, complete with chimneys and porch and gables. The windows glowed a warm gold, and as he watched tiny enchanted snowflakes began to drift onto the roof and a slender curl of smoke lifted from the marzipan chimney. He stepped closer and saw that the snowman was there under the arbor and the sled was leaning against the hedge, and in the front window of the living room, the lights on the miniature tree began to shine. It was his house, down to the wreath on the front door and the snow on the roof, and he could only stare in wonder.
The old master suite and his childhood bedroom were in that part of the house, along with one of two grand ballrooms, a large dining room and several sitting rooms. The moment he took possession of the house he took great pleasure in demolishing the staircases that led up to the suites and down to the dungeons. After that it had been a simple matter to erect walls to hide the damage. Only an architect, looking at the outside of the house, would know that an entire wing had somehow mysteriously become inaccessible. When Teddy was of age he’d tell him what he’d done and allow him to make the decision about the changes and whether they should remain in place or not. He’d decided if there was going to be an innocent child living in the house, one who had lost his parents to the war, no sign of it would touch him, not while he was in his home.
Adrian looked down at Harry’s feet as if noticing they were bare for the first time. “You’s hair on you’s toes.”
“No shit,” Draco muttered, and Harry laughed harder. “Oh, will you stop, you lunatic?”
“So, are you going to take the job at Hogwarts?”
“No sir, I did not,” Harry responded with an arch of his brow.  “I kissed you, I touched you,” his voice dropped into a sexy register, and he reached up and ran the back of his hand along Draco’s sharp cheekbone.  “I made love to you,” Draco turned his face and pressed a kiss to the back of Harry’s hand.  “But,” Harry went on, “I did not hex you.  Did you hex me?”
“So, you’re a man of hidden talents, are you?”
"These kids do know your last name, don't they?" Harry asked as one tiny girl in Ravenclaw robes stared at him in open mouthed awe.
"Yeah, but their regular Keeper is out." Harry's reply was soft.
She lifted one arched brow, and Draco rolled his eyes.
“Where do you have Sunday dinners?” Bernard asked, his head cocked to one side like an inquisitive squirrel.
“I didn’t say that.”
“Afraid so. A pretty fierce griffin, from his wrist to his elbow.”
“Harry,” he gasped, grabbing his wrist. Harry looked up at him.
Prompt for this chapter:
Harry heard Hermione’s voice, then her face was there at Rosie’s side. She looked tired, but she smiled at him.
She came to him, holding out the drawing, pointing to something in the middle of the fat ball of pink fur. He dipped his chin and stared at it, pushing his glasses up on his nose, trying to decipher what appeared to be scribbling that was all but lost in the garish pink color. He finally managed to read it, his mouth dropping open, his eyes lifting slowly to Pansy’s.
“Oh, I don’t think it’s so very different,” she said lightly. “You certainly weren’t going to snog him in sixth year. Although…” She pretended to think about it, and he rolled his eyes. “Think of the scandal
Mollified by the mention of her favorite French restaurant, Pansy settled back into the chair with a wide smile. Draco crossed to the sofa and settled amidst the cushions. He looked around the room.
Draco had to swallow again. “She was. The bravest of all of us.” His mother had died of a wasting disease that the Healers at St. Mungo’s had been able to trace to a curse that had hit her during the final battle. Apparently, before her own death, Bellatrix Lestrange made certain that her sister would pay for the betrayal of ‘her lord’. She’d not felt the spell that had hit her at the time, but her death had been assured from that moment. Lucius Malfoy had followed her just three months later, a broken man. Draco had not mourned his father; there was too much bad blood by then for that. But he still grieved for his mother every day.
In spite of himself, Harry felt his lips twitch in an involuntary smile. “That might be the reason.”
Draco felt as if Potter had slapped him.  “Wait, what?”
"Granger brought me over to the Apparition point from the Ministry. Your Floo is locked." Draco took in the polished, light wood panelling and gleaming floors, an immaculate side table with its matching oriental vases and old-fashioned silver receiving tray, and the staircase that climbed three floors around an open, brass chandelier lit entrance hall. "I can't believe this is Aunt Walburga's house," he said, clearly awed.
“To see Hagrid.”
“Shh,” Hermione said.
“Not at all,” Harry said, thinking the living room still felt stuffy and hot from his sojourn to England. He went to the kitchen for two beers straight from the frig, uncapping them on the counter and returning to find his living room much cooler, and Draco perched on the edge of the sofa like he might take flight in fear at any moment. He handed Draco the bottle, on which condensation was already forming, and sat across from him in his one armchair.
“It would probably appear as the flu,” Hermione said thoughtfully. “We can ask Padma to check her records.”
had done its usual hysterical flailing. The front page screamed 'did killing the Dark Lord turn our Harry Gay' for weeks, even attempted to pass off nonsense as 'research' stating that fighting the war had turned a large percentage of the population under thirty queer. The opposition party tried to use it against him when he ran for Minister. What they found out, to their breast clutching horror, was that most people simply didn't care. It hadn't stopped them tossing the story up every so often just to see if anyone suddenly cared, but so far having a queer Minister hadn't bothered anyone other than the oldest of the old guard. There were people who felt 'the right woman would cure him', (that one pissed Ginny right off, to his amusement) or that he should 'settle down with a nice man', and 'have a real family life', but so far their voices were not loud enough for him to feel like he needed to pay much attention. Other than Molly Weasley, of course. But that was another story, and he knew Molly's motivation. She was his Mum, and simply wanted him to be happy. He knew Rita Skeeter didn't care if he was happy; she just wanted her name on a sensational by-line.
Draco’s heart slammed hard into his breast bone, and he licked his lips and looked down at the bulge just to one side of Harry’s zip. He reached out with tentative fingers, stroking once over the distended heat, and Harry gasped, his head dropping back, his hands curling into fists. Encouraged, Draco covered him with his palm and pressed, feeling the hard length throb against his palm.
"Ronald," Hermione scolded. He turned to her.
“The Healer is still doing tests, sweetheart. But as soon as I know anything, I’ll tell you.”
And now there was a letter from Hogwarts attached to a snowy white owl. The only time he’d ever seen one more beautiful was the bird Potter had during their school years. He’d read about her death in Granger’s book about the war, and he’d die before he’d admit it made him cry. Hedwig was such a fixture at Hogwarts, more Potter’s friend than mail delivery. Draco felt real grief for the petite, regal creature and, he was loathe to admit, for the boy who’d been her wizard. They’d seemed so attached to one another at Hogwarts, much more friends that Draco and his mother’s bird, Aries. It had just been another thing he’d been envious of; Gods, he’d been an obnoxious little bitch.
“Yeah, I’m sure they do.” Ron studied him. “So what’re you doing here?”
“Completely disregarding the whole ‘he killed the lunatic that my father worshipped’ aspect of the thing.” His tone was wry. He’d had an entire afternoon to mull his current course; just because he wanted a thing, didn’t mean he could have it. He knew that only too well.
“Be nice,” he whispered. He offered his hand, which Olivia took after a moments hesitation. “Hi, Olivia. I’m Harry. Nice to meet you.”
“Well, to be honest,” Harry hesitated, “I’ve had accidental bursts of magic when I’ve been angry since I was twelve years old.”
“Oh, don’t be an idiot,” Malfoy snarled back.
?” Harry said, in disbelief. “Mitchell is still two and a half? I haven’t missed his attempt to enter Uni?”
“I got hooked on it by my mother.” Draco walked to the island and sank wearily onto one of the stools. “Father thought it was vile, but mother started drinking it at Hogwarts.”
Pansy leaned against the wall, crossing her arms. "Do go on, this has to be infinitely more interesting than this evening's scheduled program."
“Remember, careful,” Draco said softly. Teddy nodded before stepping close and wrapping his arms gently around Harry, his face pressed to Harry’s chest.
“Especially when someone else is paying for it,” Draco muttered. Pansy laughed.
"I thought your bloody Floo was locked," Draco said, scowling.
"If you can't take her, we need to step up that workout routine of yours."
"No. And if you think about it, that's very smart. Everyone knows you're married, Ronald."
“Tiens, mademoiselle.” Draco smiled down at her. They looked enough alike that she could be his child, with her white blonde hair and pale skin. Bill appeared behind her and put his hands on her shoulders.
“Welcome back, Master Malfoy.”
"Did you sleep in your clothes? You did, didn't you? Honest to Merlin, Potter." He lifted the trunk onto his shoulder and pushed past Harry into the large, long entryway of the house. Harry looked behind him, out to the mostly deserted street.
“Go put the ‘stinker’ away,” Draco said, petting the little cat’s head one last time. “And maybe watch the telly for a bit. I’ll let you know when it’s time to change into your dress robes.”
"Watch what? It's the same as the rest."
“Merlin, I think even I could get a stiffy for that.”
“Molly,” Hermione said casually, “don’t you think we need to let everyone else know Harry is home?”
“That’s not fair, Rose,” Hermione said. “You know Uncle Harry has to go home. He has patients, and a practice, and a house.”
“Okay,” he said, his voice shaky, “So it wasn’t just bravado.”
“Harry!”
Teddy, his hair now a plain brown that looked odd on him, shook his head slowly. “’Mione told you to wait here,” he said stubbornly, his lower lip wobbling. “She said she’d bring Harry back, but you have to stay here. Don’t go, Draco,” he begged, his fingers digging into Draco’s thighs. “Don’t leave again. Please.”
He gave a deep bow. "You is being most welcome, Harry Potter, sir." He disappeared and was back quickly with Harry's water, then was gone again.
"We've got these bracelets that change colour every time you're spotted in public." A tall, fit Auror named Cornish Matthias answered him with a wry smile. "Ms Granger-Weasley gave them to us months ago. She knew you'd never call for a detail, given the choice."
"Just the lab tech, but I can fill you in." She walked down the row of files, touching them lightly. "And finally, Miss Amala. If we don't remove that cast, she's going to chew it off."
. My plan was to get enough information about where he was going and when he’d be gone over hols to try to escape with my mother. Unfortunately,” he sighed and shook his head, “she wouldn’t leave Father. And Father always believed he was just one brilliant plan from finding himself back in favour. It never happened, of course.”
“But… why?” The boy whined when Draco told him he couldn’t have the broom.
Malfoy grimaced, pushing to his feet slowly. Harry kept his expression calm and relaxed, but it wasn’t easy. “I do,” he said. “He and my son Albus are good friends.”
“Flossy?” Draco didn’t even raise his voice, and yet the elf popped into place beside his elbow.
Harry shrugged as he speared some of his salad.  “Oh, it’s something I’ve been considering for a while, actually.  I’d like to have a place of my own; you know, stop leasing.”
Harry was about half-way through his breakfast when a knock sounded on the door of Ron and Hermione’s quarters. Hermione went to answer as Ron and Harry made inroads in their breakfasts.
They would; the kids would love it. And the boys would scarcely notice the difference if she were home for the Christmas hols. Lily would be the one most impacted; sunny, funny little Lily.
Malfoy nodded, then shoved his hands into his jacket pockets, answering the question about an awkward attempt by Harry to shake his hand. Harry nodded, feeling like a giant prat. “All right, then. I’m sure I’ll be seeing you soon. Malfoy.”
Harry placed the cookie back on his plate with an irritated sigh. “Yes, I know. You all went to work like responsible adults and I ran around a foreign country jumping over things on a motorcycle. A decision that clearly,” he gestured toward his legs, “got me precisely what I deserved. Did I leave anything out?”
“Mr. Potter,” Narcissa Malfoy called, and Harry turned. She was coming to him down a set of white marble steps, fully decorated Christmas trees on either side, blooming plants bordering them, evergreen swags around two of the four marble pillars that stood at the bottom of twin staircases and arching in graceful swags to the large light fixture above. The decorations were all green and white, accenting the elegance of the homes stately architecture, and behind her Harry could see the shining tree in the sitting room where they’d just.been. He’d noticed the decorations absently before, but now all of the lights seemed brighter and he found himself grateful that Narcissa Malfoy didn’t know how to do anything half way, including parent.
“Good Morning, Draco,” the old man said cheerfully. His reading glasses had slid down his long nose, and his thin grey hair stood up, fly away, around his round face.
Hagrid looked guilty, and Harry felt sick.
“Hey, Hermione.”
“Oh, aye,” Eddy said, nodding quickly. “Should I get ‘im?”
She looked away from his watchful gaze, straightening a pile of what looked like essays. "I didn't say anything about a secret."
“Megan, darling, Draco and I have business to discuss. Please, go decorate something.”
“No,” Harry said, his eyes stinging. “No, it was – pretty wonderful, actually.”
“Daddy, Draco’s here!”
“Well, of course I’ve seen one. I just never really watched what happened to one – after, before.”
Harry wasn’t sure he deserved the easy absolution, but he took it. “Speaking of Ron and Hermione, I don’t want a lot of other people to know I’m back until I’ve seen them, Bill,” he said earnestly. “I don’t want someone else telling them they’ve seen me. I feel like I owe them that, at least.”
“Okay,” he began tentatively, “I would appreciate it if you’d just listen before making a judgement call about what I’m going to say.”
“And Apparate onto the grounds, yes.”
“Remind me again why you didn’t just hire a caterer for this?” He set his glass aside and went to move the appetizers from a baking sheet to the serving dish. Pansy pursed her lips.
"You're sensitive," he observed when Harry shuddered as he stroked the spongy gland again. He exhaled, clearly trying not to make noise. Every time Draco pressed into him, a long clear strand of precome dripped onto his stomach. He was glorious, lying there, his head back and his throat moving when he swallowed, Draco's love bite darkening by his Adam's apple. Golden and muscular, he had scars of his own. One in the middle of his chest was the size of a galleon, and it was whitened, devoid of hair. "What happened here?" he stroked his thumb over the pale flesh, leaving a thin coating of lube behind.
“Hold me,” Draco said against Harry’s ear when their lips parted. “Hold me, please.”
Draco hid his concern behind bustling Harry into the shower, washing him with gentle hands, then drying him off with a thick, soft white towel. It wasn’t until he had Harry tucked into bed, his back to Draco’s front, that he spoke again.
"No." Draco's knee connected perilously close to Harry's kidneys, and he pressed his thumb hard into the soft place on Draco's wrist, just below his palm. Draco cried out.
Harry forced away the dark memories as Lily appeared behind her cousin, her darker, sleeker auburn hair pulled up in a high ponytail that bounced adorably as she ran and reminded him forcefully of her mum.
Harry squeezed his waist. “Soon.”
Harry nodded, startled when she stepped to one side of him and Malfoy stepped to the other. They each curled a hand around one of his elbows and caught his hands with the other, and Harry was almost painfully aware of the touch of Malfoy’s skin on his.
He stopped and turned back, back stiff and brows high. Harry hoped at some point while he was staying with him those square, boney shoulders would come down from around his ears.
Hermione’s cheeks turned pink. She’d risen through the ranks at the prosecutor’s office of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement with impressive speed, and was currently working directly with the Head Auror and the Minister on re-writing part of the criminal codes.
“Draco,” he whispered. Draco’s eyes shot open and he looked up at him. “There you are,” Harry said with a smile. “Stay with me love, all right?”
“Yes,” Draco gasped, his arms tightening around him. “Only harder, Harry. Don’t hold back. Harder and faster.”
“Sorry,” Harry said, closing the bottle and tossing it aside. “I’ll warm it up for you, I promise.” He reached down and began to spread the lube, pushing his now slippery fingers back inside and Draco sighed, his eyes drifting closed and his breathing going shallow. Harry withdrew his fingers and slicked them over his cock, then lined himself up, and paused.
“So why is she crying if she’s happy?” Rose persisted. “That doesn’t make any sense at all.”
They’d spoken for a few more minutes, Malfoy explaining the surgical process in far more depth than she or Ron would probably ever truly understand. But animated and discussing something he excelled in, with his gray eyes shining almost silver, Hermione didn’t think she’d ever seen a man as beautiful. Except maybe Harry. Gods, she must be really tired, she thought, forcing herself to listen. He gestured a great deal as he spoke and the light caught on the Malfoy signet ring on his right hand, and the polished silver serpents on each side glowed. She recalled seeing it on his hand for the first time during that awful sixth year, after his father had gone to Azakaban. Gods, they had so much history between them. The idea that he was actually going to do something for Harry rather than to him was almost inconceivable. She reassured herself with the thought that he’d worked too hard to risk his reputation and relatively new clinic by intentionally injuring Harry Potter.
Draco shrugged. "Really Potter, you are impossibly lacking in the finer charms of clothing care." He gestured toward the door. "Now, after you."
“Scared,” the boy repeated. “I was scared.”
“Is he all right?” Hermione asked in a hushed tone, approaching Malfoy but holding back a bit.
She smacked him smartly on the arm, then slipped her hand through the bend of his elbow. “You either apologize to me for that staggeringly enormous lie, for I believe I shall have a bruise on my ribs, or I’ll be taking back that beautiful pudding I left for you at the clinic.”
Malfoy sighed, then gave Harry a once over. “If this afternoon is all about appearances, why are you wearing trainers?”
Hermione swatted his shoulder.
“Okay, troops,” he called out. “The carousel is this way!”
Trying to remember each detail, Harry related what Draco had told him the night before. As he spoke, he could see Hermione’s quick mind absorbing all of it. Ron stopped him a few times to ask questions, questions Harry had asked himself, and for which he had no answers.
Draco rolled his head and gave Harry a slow smile that filled his eyes with light. “Oh, I was quite sufficiently distracted, Dr Potter.” He pushed at his damp fringe and a single bead of sweat slid down the side of his face. “In case no one has ever told you before, you are quite a brilliant fuck.”
“So, what are you going to do next?” Hermione snatched another cookie out of Ron’s hand with a quelling look.
“It’s all right, baby girl,” he murmured, not sure it actually was. He stood, caressing her bony head in passing as he went back to Hagrid and Malfoy, still standing pressed against the trees.
Harry pretended to frown thoughtfully. “She’s my favorite girl who bakes biscuits,” he said. “
“Harry.” The name bounced off of the walls, yelled in growing volume. “Over here. Over here, Harry.”
Draco was saved from responding to that distasteful idea when Flossy returned, pushing a tea cart complete with steaming porcelain pot and a platter of elegant little tea cakes.
"Careful, wise arse."
The moment the words were out of his mouth, Harry regretted saying them. He could only chalk it up to his fatigue. But Molly merely smiled.
Harry blew out an exasperated breath. “I don’t know what the fuck you want me say.”
“Not as glad as I am.” He pulled back and smiled down at her.
At least this time, Harry didn’t expect to be thanked for his trouble.
Malfoy stared at him, then turned and went into the bathroom. Harry could hear him speaking to Adrian, his refined, smooth voice echoing against the tiles.
Hagrid made a teasing pass at Harry’s man-bun with his beefy hand. “And what’s this, then?”
Putting a quart of milk, a dozen eggs and a pound of gouda in the refrigerator, Draco grabbed an apple from the bag and walked over to the couch, picking up the post then flopping inelegantly across the cracked but buttery soft leather. It was a horrible sort of dark olive green, but he’d never reclined on another piece of furniture that felt quite as much as if it were designed to give in all of the right places. He tossed an
“You mean they found one?” Draco pretended surprised. “Who knew?”
She giggled, and there was a moment’s awkward silence following.
Draco waved his concern away. “Just a day of lifting well fed children.” He leaned into Harry for just a moment, speaking next to his ear. “And if I ever see that picture of me wearing this atrocity you call a shirt, you will never get laid again in your life.”
"I'll tell you why," Draco went on, "but if you can't agree to that, I'll be heading back to Scotland now."
He took a shaky breath, as deep as he could, as the current bird floated down to settle next to him on the floor. “You’re quite lovely, aren’t you?” he said to her, his voice trembling. She pecked him on the hand impatiently, as if to say ‘I have things to do, slacker.’ “Well, that’s wasn’t very nice.” The look she gave him said more clearly than words that she didn’t care what he thought. Draco forced another deep breath, then lifted hands that were shaking so hard it took him two tries to take the envelope from her leg. Once he had, and she’d left in a huff because Draco had no owl treats to offer, he could only stare at the sharp, crisply written lines of a decidedly masculine hand on the front. ‘Draco Malfoy’ was all it said. No address, just his name.
He looked up as he hung his heavy outer robes on a coat rack to see Molly Weasley bustling toward him down the long narrow hallway. She looked careworn and frazzled, and he frowned.
He nodded, standing slowly as well. Harry did the same, grimacing a bit when his knees complained.
“We’ll grant you the ‘we are ignorant arses who owe you everything’ argument if you’ll just tell us what it is you’ve found,” he said pointedly, and she exhaled through her mouth, but sat back on her heels.
“Oh, you’re bloody hilarious, you are,” Potter said darkly, dropping the light blue box on top of a nearby stack.
She opened another set of double doors and they exited onto a quiet, mostly deserted platform. On the tracks sat a sleek, modern engine in black and gun metal gray, attached to a passenger car. Draco noticed for the first time that the private train matched the Rolls, and he thought how very predictable his father had been. He wondered what the train would look like painted fire engine red.
“It’s all right,” he murmured. Harry swallowed, looking back to Bernard. His fingers tightened almost painfully around Draco’s hand.
“What is it?”
"I've a black leather jacket with a light spot I only managed to cover with a Muggle marker."
"What is it?" she asked warily.
Hermione smiled at him. “It’s just tea, Harry.”
Mollified, Harry felt the sudden stiffness in his shoulders ease. He looked pointedly at Draco's pants and trousers bunched around his shoes on the floor. "It did, I promise you. But your slacks are going to look like they've been tied in a knot if you leave them like that."
“I’ll do it,” Pansy said archly. “But
“You do not make me nervous,” he protested. There was enough light that Harry could see his cheeks turn pink across his high cheekbones, in spite of his insistence. And Harry found himself utterly charmed by that blush.
“He’s… better than nothing.” Harry slid down onto the couch, letting his head fall against the back. “But he’ll never get the seventh years through their NEWT’s, and the kids hate him.” Harry stacked his hands behind his head. “I don’t much like him, either. He’s a prissy little toad, and almost as arrogant as Gilderoy Lockhart.”
“Uncle Harry!” he cried joyously, wrapping his arms around Harry’s body and squeezing; hard. Harry gasped, patting Ted on the back and hoping for air.
Draco followed Harry and Ron through the garden, staying to a path that had been shovelled from the back door to the garage. He’d heard Harry say something to Ronald about ‘the bike’ and a sobering potion, but he just followed along, blissfully enjoying the cold evening air on his over-heated cheeks. Ron opened a sliding garage door and the lights inside of the small building flicked on.
“We certainly can’t. The natives are restless enough as it is.” He rolled his eyes. “They were so desperate for caffeine that Pansy even tried to make coffee; something she should never, ever do. It’s so vile it has a personality.” Harry laughed again, and Malfoy smiled at him. “It was good to see you, Potter.”
Draco looked down at him, and he didn't even look angry. The absolute ice in his eyes chilled Harry. And he wondered if there wasn't something terribly wrong with him, because chills raced down his spine and his prick throbbed.
Harry had shifted in his seat. “I think I did what was expected of me,” he answered. “Everyone figured I’d become an Auror; I just went along with it.” He frowned. “I think I did a good bit of that, actually. My sole purpose for so long had been to just…” He’d paused, uncomfortable.
“Open it.”  Harry lifted his arm along the back of the sofa, and waited.
He had changed into black jeans and the black hoodie in the men’s at the airport, hoping the dark color would help him to pass through the dimly lit pub unnoticed. He’d left his dad’s invisibility cloak in his school trunk at Grimmauld when he’d taken off; the only magical thing he’d kept with him was his wand and it had been so long since he’d used it he wasn’t sure he could even manage a basic glamour. Pulling up the hood and yanking it forward to hide as much of his face as possible, he could only hope the bar was busy enough he could slip through undetected. Taking a deep breath, he opened the door.
"Preparing to do something filthy with my mouth."
“Good night, Rosie.”
Their smiles met in a kiss.
By the time a knock sounded on the conference room door, Harry was a nervous wreck. He jumped out of his seat and was standing, rubbing his palms on the black trousers he wore beneath his business robes, when the door opened and Marta appeared.
Hermione pushed back her chair and came to him, slipping onto his lap and wrapping her arms around his neck. She pressed her face against his throat, and when he felt her shoulders begin to shudder and her tears touch his skin, he encircled her with his arms and held her tight.
“Clara, this is Thomas Culpepper.” They’d decided to use the name of one of Draco’s long-lost uncles on his mother’s side back at least two generations. Harry was surprised that Walburga Black’s relatives were anything as mundane as a Culpepper, and he told Draco he didn’t remember seeing any Culpepper’s on the tapestry of the Black family tree.
Potter's body stilled, absently lifted hand hovering by his face for a moment before dropping back to his side. "What?"
“I’m sure it would be. So swear you will behave yourself.”
“No.”
The corner of Potter’s lips quirked. “Stick with what you’re good at, that’s what I – always say.”
“Papa?”
He had no intention, ever, of telling anyone how completely unprepared he was for helping to ‘entertain’ sixteen children between the ages of six months and eleven years. The older boys looked at him with suspicion, and the older girls looked at him and sighed, something he found uniquely disconcerting. But then he’d found it disconcerting when he’d been an eleven year old boy and girls had mooned over him. The reasons for that reaction hadn’t become clear to him until much later.
“Well, thanks for the offer. You are looking rather fit, and the tan is quite attractive. But I’m happily married.”
“Draco kindly consented to help me with my shopping, Ron,” Harry said, his tone firm, his grip even more so.  His eyes never left Draco’s face even as he talked to his friend.  “Then, if he’ll agree, I’m going to buy him dinner.”
Draco sniffed, but he didn’t push Harry’s hand away when he squeezed his thigh under the table.
Neville shook his head, a smile hinted at in the corners of his mouth. “Not a thing.”
“See how he talks now, Ted? Rattlin’ off ‘physiology’ like it’s nuthin.” His booming laugh carried over the snow. “Our Harry, a Doctor.” Hagrid beamed down at him with pride.
Molly gave him a stern look. “Don’t say it like that, Harry. There’s nothing wrong with good, honest work, no matter how humble.”
“A snowman. What, you’ve become such an old duffer you’ve forgot what they are?”
Pansy sailed into the room looking stunning, her dark hair pulled back into a French twist, diamonds sparkling in her ears. She was also wearing white iridescent robes, and Draco rolled his eyes. She went to him and rose up onto her toes, kissing his cheek.
Just as he’d about got hold of himself, Weasley returned with a dark blue jumper and a short Sherpa lined denim jacket. It was all too large on his slender frame, but Draco assumed he’d be warm. It felt weird to hand his robes off to Ronald, and he turned back to the bike to find Harry holding out a black helmet, an expectant look on his face. Draco was certain his hair would be a disaster on the other end but decided better safe than sorry. It was heavier than his bike helmet but could probably stand up to a good deal more abuse, if necessary.
“That’ll carry some weight with Charlie.” Ron grinned. “And really piss Angelo off.”
“I wish you would.”
"Oh, lovely."
Harry heard voices approaching and glanced towards the large sitting room. He nearly spilled beans down his jumper when he saw who was with Hermione; Malfoy walked easily at Hermione’s side, wearing dark gray robes much like the ones he’d worn the day before. The biggest difference between this Draco and the one Harry had gone to school with, was his hair; there wasn’t a bit of gel on it, and it was feathered softly around his face. Harry liked it, a lot more than he was prepared to admit.
“Strong enough to walk on, I’d wager,” Harry quipped, and his heart lifted when the corner of Malfoy’s lips curled up.
“What the fuck, Reg?” ‘Jimmy’ said. His friend turned back, pointing a trembling finger at Potter.
“What?”
Scorpius’s chin lifted obstinately. “You know, you can’t avoid this forever.”
“Don’t you be an idiot,” Potter countered. “Not to put too fine a point on it, but he can hex a pimple off your arse at a hundred yards.”
He looked utterly stunned, shell-shocked. He rubbed his jaw, and ran his fingers up into his hair, then dropped his hand down to his side.
’. “Ladies and gentlemen,” she then went on, her voice amplified but only slightly, “if you would gather, please.” She waited while they did, confused murmurs and speculation stirring through their ranks. She waited until silence had been restored before turning back to Harry and Draco. “Dearly beloved…”
“What a singular woman,” Narcissa said as she watched her walk away.
It had been nearly twenty years since Draco had been to anything like a holiday party. Admittedly, the get together at the Weasley’s was more about their victory before the Wizengamot than about the holiday, but the tree in the corner and the candles tucked in amongst the greens along the mantle-piece added all the festivity any Yule party might need. They all drank enough wine that food became a necessity, and even though he wasn’t a fan he ate two pieces of the pepperoni pizza the teens insisted on when it was ordered. It was greasy, and hot, and perfect.
“Open the card first,” she instructed him with a smirk, and he sent her a look as he slipped his fingers under the flap.
Draco unbuckled his seatbelt. “We are, indeed, going on a train.”
Her returned look could only be described as scathing. "At least I haven't had a jones for him for twenty years," she sniffed.
“I’m ready to come just from what you’re doing; there’s no way I’d last long enough for you to get inside me.”
She laughed, but it faded when he didn’t join her. “Darling, what is it?” she asked, stepping closer, her fingers tightening on his shoulder again. “You’re so tense…”
Malfoy studied him for a long moment. “I thought you were a large animal specialist.”
“Family traditions are important,” it said finally. “Your presence for young Lupin’s investiture is approved. But understand this, Malfoy; you’re being watched. If you forget yourself for even a moment, the agreement is nullified, and you know what will happen then.”
Prompt used in the Epilogue (later in this part)
“You know what the sight of you in those clothes and boots does to me,” he whispered. Harry smiled into his hair.
“Are you leaving?” Harry asked as Draco as he lined up several potions on a nearby dresser, then closed a dark bag, shrank it, and dropped it into the pocket of his Healer’s robes.
Harry felt a surge of heat rush over his chest as he recalled what they’d been doing when Narcissa Malfoy had made her presence known. Well, truth be told, what he’d been doing. “Perhaps it’s a good thing she didn’t,” he typed, mouth tipped up wryly. “It might have been a whole lot more embarrassing than it was.”
“I… like you,” Potter said, searching his eyes. “Rather a lot, I think. But…” He paused, dampening his lips with his tongue.
Harry felt himself color. “Just thought I should quit imposing on his hospitality.”
“Hey, there’s a Mrs Claus,” Harry said in faux outrage.
A little bubble formed in front of her pink, bow shaped lips, and Harry watched the expressions that played over her face with fond fascination.
Draco returned the small, sardonic smile. "Not even you."
He pulled away and turned, and Harry stared at the dejected slope of his shoulders.
Ron scowled at her even as Harry laughed.  “You’re not funny,” Ron huffed.  “And what subject was Harry trying to change?”
Harry could remember it vividly. In fact, almost every single memory of Hogwarts Harry had, Malfoy was hovering around the edges. Insults tossed across the great hall, hexes thrown during Snape’s dueling club. He’d been everywhere, always. It wasn’t until sixth year, when he’d been wan and lost and nearly fading away before their eyes that Harry knew he cared about him. Then he nearly killed him in a loo, and – he forced that memory away. “I mean, it’s not like I can help being Harry Potter any more than you can help being Draco Malfoy. Right?”
“With just me for company.” His voice sounded flat. “I get it.”
"Fuck," he cried out, his hips jumping. "Fucking hell. I can't… I won't last long."
Ron laughed. “I reckon there ain’t a whole lot that can make me forget the Contraceptive charm like a good argument.” He straightened away from the shop window. “You think we should head back now, or are you okay to go on?”
Harry’s rolled his head to squint up at Draco. “Your mother?”
“Clever, Hermione.” He couldn’t keep the admiration from his tone.
Draco leaned forward, crossing his long legs. He was wearing loose black lounging trousers and a white jumper, and his hair touched the high collar and fanned across his forehead. The fit of the knitted top accentuated how angular his frame was at the moment, but his color was good and his eyes were bright.
He turned back to find Potter pulling the long, heavy black robes off over his head, then shrinking them and shoving them into a black leather saddle bag strapped to the frame of the bike. He unbuttoned the fitted tunic, taking it off to reveal a white t-shirt. Shrinking the tunic as well, he exchanged one small set of clothing for another. Resizing a black jumper, he pulled it on over his head, then down over his waist.
"Yes. She's always been a horror with her nose in everyone else's business. She sent Blaise's mother a letter, and she contacted him. Our mothers were great friends at school, and she knew he and I had maintained our friendship. He was here earlier to inform me about the gossip."
hpdmhpdmhpdm
“Call me,” she ordered after the tone.  “Immediately.   Trust me, you’re going to want to hear what I’ve got to tell you.” She paused, a saucy smile crossing her face.  “Let me just say this; it involves a certain dark-haired, green-eyed Gryffindork, and a question he just asked me.  A
Hannah and Justin scrambled to do his bidding, papers slip sliding on the tabletop and Hermione staring at him as if he had suddenly sprouted a second head. Hannah and Justin basically chased one another out the conference room door.
oooOOOooo
“Hey,” he protested, but she was already reading it.
She picked up a stack of memos from the corner of her desk, holding them out to him. "The only one that might be pressing is on the top. Your ex-wife seems quite anxious to get in touch with you, although she refused to tell me why." She sniffed, and Harry fought a grin. Augie, and he would
‘It wasn’t Potter’, was all he could think. The little girl wasn’t Potter’s. He couldn’t explain the rush of relief mingled with disappointment he felt, because it made no sense. Why it should matter to him, he couldn’t explain. But it did, it mattered very much. Draco pressed his hand to a stomach that had been tied in knots since he’d seen the little girls green eyes, and waved his wand, dissipating the names. Absently, he ran the tests for infection and Dragon Pox, and waited for the results to appear, his eyes fixed unseeing across the office.
“Would you like to eat, or get cleaned up first?”
He looked between the two men and seemed to sag a bit.  “Godric’s balls,” he muttered.  “Hermione is going to have a coronary.”  He then seemed to remember something far more pressing than who his friend was or was not dating, and his hands went to his head.  “Hermione!  Harry, please, please.  You have to help me make this right…”
“Winner Solice,” he chirped. Draco’s smiled widened.
She’d been sitting on the sofa, her hands linked around her knees, her fingers white-knuckled, they were clenched together so tightly. Her face looked pale and drawn, and she was staring into the flames. She didn’t even turn her head when he walked up to her. Alarmed, Harry knelt near her feet.
Draco’s chest flushed pink, and Harry smiled. “I asked it… what I’d been missing.”
Clearly, he just needed to get out of here and go home. Then this weird, off putting craving for someone long, lean and blond would go away. Well -- long, lean, blond and named Malfoy, anyway.
“No, this is fine.” Malfoy paused before speaking again. “Thank you.”
Harry sat in a wooden rocking chair, rocking slowly, Olivia sprawled, sound asleep, across his lap. She was still warm, but not as warm as she had been, and as she’d gone to bed Sheila had tucked a thick baby quilt over her and around her shoulders. It was like holding a tiny furnace, and Harry was a bit uncomfortable but it had taken so long for her to fall asleep he couldn’t bear to move her.
“See?” Draco said triumphantly, completely unaware of the mess he’d nearly made. “They’re
“You don't want... what?”
“Still think it’s in his head, Hermione?” he asked softly. She shook her head slowly.
“Aunt Pansy,” Scorpius answered. “How else?”
Harry felt just like he had that first Christmas at Hogwarts, when he’d realized that some of the presents under the tree in the Gryffindor common room were for him.  He’d spent the formative years of his life learning the hard way that gifts weren’t for him, that he was too odd and too strange to be included in the Christmas festivities.  Then, in one morning, all of that had changed, and there were presents under the tree with his name on them, and he’d understood the meaning of wonder.  Now he stood in Parkinson’s sitting room, waiting for her to bring him the keys to his house, and that sense of wonder was back.  He owned a house.  He owned the perfect house, and that excited eleven-year-old was alive in him and his wonder was very real.
"What?" Hannah Abbott-Longbottom said incredulously. "Justin, we've spent hours and hours going over this crap. It's not confrontational; it's direct. And I'm so bloody tired of soft pedalling so that we might get old people to vote for something that won't impact their lives because, pardon my honesty, they'll be dead."
Her blue eyes widened. “You know my Grammie Molly?”
“I have no idea.”
Progressive spells had been the bane of a Healer’s existence during the war. A complicated combination of spells, just as Healers would get a bead on what they were dealing with another wholly different spell would hit. Hermione had seen more than one person die in the final battle because of progressive spells.
“Being tired of the hospital.”
“I… uhm… okay,” Draco stammered, caught off guard. “I, uh, I’m going now.”
“I was teasing, Potter,” Malfoy said quietly. “You perhaps didn’t recognise it because I was such an obnoxious snot in my youth?”
“Oh, Uncle Harry,” Rose cried. “I just love those. They’re so cute! I wish they’d fit me.”
“He’s a mean one, Mr. Grinch,” Draco sang in a deep voice, bending to tickle the little boy. He collapsed in a paroxysm of giggles, and Harry found himself laughing with him.
Draco nodded and pulled his wand from the holster under the sleeve of his sweater. “If I may?”
“It’s one of his Christmas presents, actually.”  Draco dropped his free hand into his pocket. “I’d like to keep it a surprise, if I could.”
“Hello, my love,” she smiled, leaning back. “Allow me to return the compliment. You look very handsome.”
“I know I’m not.” He released her hand and pushed to his feet. “Right now, I’m just too tired to care.” He bent and kissed her cheek. “I’m going to go and sleep for a while.”
Cautiously slipping his wand into the black leather holster strapped to his forearm, Draco turned, swallowing when he saw Potter standing inside of the shop door. The white chef’s jacket was gone, and in its place was a hunter green jumper topped by a bulky sheepskin coat. There was a black knitted cap pulled low on his head; it flattened his fringe and made his wild hair brush the frames of his glasses and curl behind his ears.
“I did. But I is
“There’s been a recent acceleration,” Hermione said softly. “It’s actually quite alarming.”
“Oh ho,” she laughed. “Told you that, did he?” Draco felt his cheeks flush, and she grinned cheekily. “All I wanted to say was,” she paused, crossing her arms over her chest, and Draco braced himself for the assault. “Whatever it is that you're doing, I hope you'll keep doing it.” Draco stared at her, stunned. “He's happier than he's been in a really long time. And if you can do that for him, then so be it.” She smiled at his shocked expression, and turned to her date. “Come on, Corner,” she announced, grabbing his arm. “Let's get pissed.” She shot them another grin and walked away.
you.”
She looked up at him from beneath her eyelashes.
The Floo sounded in the outer office but Harry didn’t turn in his seat. He figured it was Clara turning up for work and he took a sip of his coffee, knowing she’d check in with him shortly. He was startled when a bright voice sounded through the office.
“You might be surprised,” she said. “Minerva’s made some changes.”
“…to Derbyshire.”
It had taken a while for Draco to calm down, which Harry had felt was completely understandable given the circumstances. He’d felt decidedly shaky for a while himself. Hermione had quickly cured the cuts on Draco’s face and hands, but the tremors had lingered for several hours. He’d dozed off sometime near dawn, his head on Harry’s chest, but had been awake again by seven. Harry felt certain that when they were able to deal with whatever this was, Draco would sleep for a week. So would he, Harry reflected, his jaw hardening; he was tired, but he wasn’t resting until he’d found out who’d done this, and made them pay.
“Pushy,” Harry said wryly, but he shifted so that he was straddling Draco’s hips, then lowered his body down slowly.
"No, not that you… stubborn, impossible – " When Draco would have walked away, Harry backed him into the mantle, bracing his arms on either side of his upper arms. Draco's poisonous scowl might've worked on someone else. It might've worked on Harry an hour before, but not now. "Don't turn on me and close me out again. Don't start calling me
“Ah, but then you could heal me. One stop shopping, as it were.”
“I like the black.” She cupped his cheek with her chubby hand, staring at him for a long minute. “You’re pretty,” she said finally, and Arthur let out a snort of laughter.
“Rose. Fork, please!” Hermione scolded.
He pulled the door open with less force than before, glancing around the ante room before walking quietly toward the room of stalls and urinals beyond. He studied the line of open doors before turning to watch Potter, who apparently hadn't seen him, leaning over one of the sinks. He had his hands braced on the porcelain, leaning heavily forward, water dripping from his fringe and his chin. Clearly he'd splashed his face without bothering to clean himself up after. Draco sighed softly and moved into the line of sight of Potter's mirror.
Draco studied him, then a grin pulled at his lips. Slowly, he shook his head.
“Find someone,” he parroted. Her eyes lifted back to his.
Hermione nodded, tears shining along her lower eyelids. “Even though he knows I love him, and that the Weasley’s all love him, he doesn’t
He covered himself liberally, had laid the tube aside and was stroking the lube, which had turned clear, into his skin when Draco saw him abruptly stiffen, his green eyes going very wide.  “Oh, my God,” Potter gasped, his fingers tightening around his hardness.  “Oh, my God...”
It didn't, actually, but Harry wasn't going to back down. "I beg to differ."
Harry stopped, turning.
“Pansy,” he answered earnestly.  “Maybe that’s because he was never a possibility before.”
The white jacket Draco was wearing became his jumper and leather jacket, and his black trousers became the tweed he'd been wearing earlier. He laid his wand on the linen draped cart, lifted the lid off one of the plates and plucked a purple grape from a bunch, tossing it into his mouth.
“Nice,” Potter said softly, pumping his hand up and down, letting his other drift back to cup Draco’s balls. “Very nice.” He nuzzled Draco’s cock and Draco sighed, spreading his legs a bit to allow greater access. Potter’s fingers skimmed back even further, seeking out the crease in his arse, and Draco closed his eyes on a sigh. They shot open again immediately when Potter took him in his mouth.
Draco shrugged, but Harry thought it was likely.
“The women, on the other hand,” Leah went on, smirking, “mostly opt for true love.”
“Malfoy,” she said, worried by his appearance. She wasn’t reassured when he spoke.
"I'm not," Ron argued. "I'm simply reminding his illustriousness, here, that I've been against him and Malfoy from the beginning but I've bit my tongue because you're my friend, Harry, and I do believe you're entitled to fuck who you want. But the name Malfoy still gets a rise out of people, and those pictures being splashed across the front of the
“Yes, yes!!!” He jumped up and down, and Thomas grinned.
“That was a pretty snazzy private hospital, Harry.”
“Kiss me,” Harry murmured, slipping his hand around his nape beneath the pale hair.
Draco closed his eyes, sighing. “He is. He’s worth everything.”
Harry stuck out his leg and hiked up his pant leg, showing Ron the black cowboy boots he wore. They’d set him back two hundred dollars, but he’d thought they were worth it.
This time, he accepted, hoping it would help to thaw some of the chill that had taken up residence around his heart.
“Where…?”
“Ah, here he is!”
“Well, it looked like you two were having a very deep conversation. Personally, I’ve found that deep truths with a teenage offspring go down better with a ginger biscuit.” She winked at him. “But if there are any left when you’re done, I’ll let you buy them.”
oooOOOooo
Harry nearly laughed at his startled expression.
“He’s a perfectly lovely child,” Draco said generously. “And of course you love him; he’s your intellectual equal.”
“Why didn’t you wake me?”
Harry smiled slightly, and Draco’s heart turned over—hard. “Yes, Buddy. I promised. Sunday.”
by Mark Sullivan. It was not light reading, but it was riveting: the story of a young Italian man who, through a twist of fates, becomes the driver for Hitler’s head of commander in Italy during WWII.
“Stop.” Malfoy shook his head. “If you’ll recall, I was trying to kill you.”
For the purposes of this story, I’m borrowing the Pagan celebration of the Winter Solstice and adding in a dash of HP canon, and my own take on a wizarding celebration. No insult is intended by doing this; I have enormous respect for the pagan traditions, and find myself learning more every time I read about them. In fact, as a Christian, I’m amazed by how much we ‘borrowed’ from people here long, long before we were.
“No,” Denny said abruptly, and Harry stilled, his arm outstretched. “You need to drink more.”
Harry gaped at him, a chill racing down his arms.
Her mouth dropped open in outrage. “Oh, you horrible arse! How do you know that? I was assured no one knew!”
The Healer hesitated.
"That's fine. I'll—" Harry could hear the confusion in his voice, but he managed not to question. Harry had never been so grateful. "I'll be there as soon as I can."
He sighed and ran his very cold fingers through his hair. He’d been home for nearly two decades. He knew Scorpius Malfoy, well. He was one of his middle child’s best friends. How had he managed to go all of this time and not know the outcome of their trials? How had it just escaped his interest that Draco and his Mum had been stripped of almost all of their assets and nearly all of their magic? They weren’t allowed to live or work in the wizarding world. They’d been able to keep their wands, but they were monitored twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. If a single spell deemed ‘unnecessary’ was performed, they were forced to appear at the Ministry to explain themselves. Narcissa had been gone for years, but perhaps cruellest of all to Draco was that he wasn’t allowed to step foot on Hogwarts grounds. Which meant that as a parent, he couldn’t even come to Quidditch matches, or visit on parents day to see his son. Harry found the whole thing both cruel and infuriating.
“I’m fine, Hagrid. Honestly. So, how are the Abraxans and the unicorns doing?”
“It’s not funny, Ron,” she said sternly. “They could get up to…things they aren’t ready for.”
oooOOOooo
Harry shook his head, unable to stop the softening of his expression. And he knew Draco saw it when he stiffened, his eyes going wide. "No, you don't." He tossed the photo onto the duvet, and he saw the moment Draco recognized it. He looked so horrified Harry nearly laughed.
“So, do you plan to introduce us?” Anya teased. “I gather he’s a friend of yours?”
Draco went through ledger after ledger, the ones for tuition, and food supplies, payroll and teaching materials. Harry knew they were a mess; he’d never been much good with the maths, but he didn’t think they were that bad, either. He knew Draco was trying to deal with the silence from the Ministry. Harry’s effort to ignore him was the best he could do to keep from snapping back every time Draco drawled one of his snotty comments. He both hated and looked forward to eleven a.m. every day, when Draco left to go to the house to drop his glamour and change his clothes before Adrian came through the door just after noon with Harry.
that."
Draco waited a moment, then poked Harry in the ribs with one of his bony fingers.
“No?” Olivia turned to look at Harry, who had picked up a cloth and was cleaning a squirmy Benji’s face.
“Really,” Draco finally managed, taking a sip of his coffee as soon as he could swallow. “Lovely.”
Malfoy smirked at him. “Research? Granger will turn somersaults from pure joy.”
“They say it’s haunted by Voldemort.”
Harry had been warmed by the acknowledgment.
“Bribery,” Draco quipped. “I’m impressed, Potter. How very Slytherin of you.” He waved his wand and watched as a series of numbers appeared over Olivia’s head. He seemed satisfied with what he saw and banished the numbers with another negligent flick of his wand. He sent Harry an ironic smile. “But was it entirely necessary for this to be -- quite so Gryffindor a bear?”
Sheila gave him a weary smile. “Mr. Potter, if you don’t mind watching her, there are other things I’m sure I can be helping with.”
Draco was hovering, unmoving, above him. “Then what is it?”
Draco rolled his eyes. “He’s a fierce hunter.”
Bernard smiled gently. “I understand how you feel. It would probably be good for me to be off my feed for a bit, but I wouldn’t like it.” He laced his fingers over the slight pudge straining the buttons of his button down, as if illustrating his point. “Now, do you remember what we discussed in the beginning? How this process works?” Harry nodded, his anxiety visibly increasing. Bernard waited at least a minute, his demeanor and expression kind, almost fatherly. Draco found himself wondering if he had different faces, different attitudes for different patients. It made sense, he supposed.
Potter looked up at him, then back down at the sleeping child. “What if she wakes up while I’m gone?”
Draco grinned, and Harry wrapped him in his arms, kissing him deeply.
“Troughs,” Harry said, picking up on Draco’s idea. “We can use Aguementi to fill them, right by the food. We can add trees – “
“That was mostly due to stress and exhaustion.” Ron held tight to Bludger’s leash when he saw a squirrel, and Rosie laughed when the little rodent shot effortlessly up the trunk of one of the trees that lined the street, its tail twitching. “She was trying to run the nursery at the orphanage by herself, and cook all the meals. They’ve got help in since.”
“Well, well, what have we here?”
He dropped the book on a pained sound, looking down at a row of angry looking puncture wounds on the top and palm of hand.
“What’s happened? Is it one of the kids?”
“I am the East,” Draco said, “the place of dawn, ruled by the element of Air. I am the breath of Life, of speech and song. I watch over all the winged ones. I am the season of Spring, the season of birth and new creation surging forth.” He smiled at Harry, and Harry grinned back.
She was quiet for a long time. "So, it's like that."
“Bitch, bitch, bitch,” Draco muttered. And when exactly, had he become ‘Draco’? The thought was there and gone as Draco crossed to his mother and kissed her on the cheek. “Stop terrorizing the poor man. I’ve just barely got him in the door.”
Instantly, and with impressive coordination, the Auror's spread out in a circle on the lightly travelled walkway and turned their backs. Ron cast the charm that would mute their conversation and turned to Harry.
Harry looked startled. “I – no one did, did they?” Delight began to shine in his green eyes.
Draco never went over to the small, attractive shop himself, at least not during business hours He could see the crowds of people who milled about inside and didn’t want to be seen. But he had wandered over a couple of times after Potter had gone for the day, peering through the windows. The displays were artfully done, the color scheme of pale and mid to dark tones of blue surprising. Frankly, Draco was surprised that the place wasn’t painted scarlet and Gryffindor gold. It was as far from that as possible. There were dainty tables with Wedgewood blue clothes that hung straight to the black and white tiled floor, their surfaces stacked with small white boxes tied with dark blue ribbon, filled with every sort of baked confection. The walls were striped with alternating, complimentary blues, and the sign on the wall behind the counter, listing items and prices, was in elegant script. Long glass cases held cakes and pies and scones and assorted biscuits, and even through the window, just the sight of them made Draco salivate. The shop looked immaculately clean and was homey without being crafty, and Draco couldn’t help but admire the skill with which it had been put together. On the whole, Potter had made a creditable job of it, and as he’d crossed the street to his own business, as different from Potter’s as the sun is to the moon, he felt a grudging admiration for the man.
Draco stood up and crossed the room, pacing restlessly until the flames flared and she came through, her hair secured at the nape of her neck, wearing jeans and a dark blue jumper.
Shrugging, he removed it, fed the animal a treat and sent it on its way.
“Healer Malfoy?”
Hermione’s voice cut through the clamour and he turned. She approached on quick feet, her robes creased and tightly curling tendrils of hair escaping from the chignon at the base of her neck. She looked so tired, he thought, then supposed he probably didn’t look much better.
Draco pulled at his hands, and Harry reluctantly let them slide from his grip, his heart beginning to pound. But Draco didn’t withdraw from him completely; he reached into the high collar of his beige jumper, his hand going to the back of his neck and grasping something. When he pulled, a silver chain began to emerge from the confines of the jumper, something heavy weighing down the center. Something he’d clearly been wearing inside of his clothes, against his skin. When he pulled the chain off over his head and held it out, Harry saw that swinging from the shining slender necklace was a platinum ring, several diamonds dotting its circumference. It swung gently, the weak sun coming through the windows catching in the stone’s facets and making them sparkle like the frost on the window behind them.
Draco glared at him. “Talk? What,  Like I’m a Labrador?”
Draco stared down at the man at his feet. He thought that for as long as he lived, this would be the penultimate moment of his existence; the night Harry Potter knelt at his feet, his pink lips spread around the girth of Draco’s cock.
She read the coordinates from the parchment in her hand in a firm voice, and waited as the flames grew, images swirling through them in a dizzying rush. Finally they settled, and Hermione could see a handsomely decorated office on the other end. After a moment a woman appeared, a redhead wearing dark blue robes and a pinched expression.
"Having dinner with your Aunt Hermione and Uncle Ron."
“Sprouts.”
“Harry.” She pressed her face into his chest, but not before he saw tears in her eyes. “Oh, Harry. You’re home.”
“Yeah, would someone care to tell me why that was, exactly?” Harry looked between them. “I already know it has something to do with Scorpius. And psychopaths.”
“And you’re lovely,” he countered. “And there must be something more interesting to talk about than how we look.”
Prompt used for this chapter:
“Padma doesn’t agree, Harry. She knows she hasn’t the equipment to pin point and repair that kind of nerve damage, and she wants you to not have a permanent limp, which is possible. Why are you being so unreasonable about this?”
His smile widened. “Trewitt’s Bakery, you know it?”
He went on, but Harry didn't pay much attention. He'd read the language a thousand time; he could recite it by rote. Instead, he studied the faces of the members of the Wizengamot, tried to read their expressions. Hermione told him they had the votes; it was a good thing she knew. He couldn't tell a bloody thing by looking at them. It reminded him of the day they'd voted whether or not to censure him for Apparating within the Ministry. He felt the same nausea slip into his stomach now that had then. He hadn't thought the job of Minister mattered to him until it seemed possible he might lose it. He hoped the outcome was the same. He hadn't been censured; he'd been warned, but nothing official. He had Hermione's powers of persuasion to thank for that. If the Divorce Bill passed, her influence would be the same.
But in regards to Potter, with the amount of invasive metal Hermione was describing…
Draco laughed. "Oh, she is." He rubbed the slightly crooked bridge of his once perfect nose. "I had the sinus problems for years to remind me of that. Pansy, on the other hand, was raised a Slytherin and is therefore naturally vicious."
“I can’t stay much longer,” he said regretfully. “I have a preliminary work up for a patient who’s having surgery in a few days. And I’ll need some sleep before that.”
Draco sighed as he made his way down the stairs. He’d been in the nursery at Freddie’s House for just under twelve hours, and St. Mungo’s had just paged him on the communication bracelet he wore at all times. He’d admitted Helena the night before; her fever wasn’t as high as Monty’s, but there had been fluid building in her lungs. Apparently the nurse’s shift had just changed, and they had questions about some of the notations in the baby’s chart. But then, he told himself firmly, he was going home. He had to sleep, or he would be no good for anyone.
Potter was being very mysterious.
She leaned closer in the flames. “Harry, I feel so badly for Draco. He’s sitting there in front of the Floo, waiting for news of his son, and I haven’t been able to give him anything.”
It was jarring, how surprised he was to hear Draco call him by his surname. He shouldn’t be; he’d never called him anything else. It was just – he no longer thought of him as Malfoy. Which was clearly going to be weird.
“So he is.” Malfoy dropped his hands defensively into his pockets. “I imagine the Potter sprogs are all very cute as well, freckles and ginger hair notwithstanding.”
Hermione gave him an exaggerated, sad smile. She placed her finger in front of her lips. “Discretion, Gerry. Discretion.”
“What can I get you, Head Master?” The young man behind the bar scrubbed the top to a velvet sheen as Harry stepped up between two stools.
Potter’s eyes came back, startled. “Malfoy…”
Draco coughed, sputtering slightly.  “She... what?”
Harry felt his face heat. "Are they?"
"Do you want me to suck you off?" Harry offered in a soft, rasping voice. He cupped Draco's prick boldly, searching out his shape through his robes.
“I’ll pass. I’m on security and supervision tonight, and I’d prefer to keep a clear head.”
Flooded with relief, Harry ran up the stairs, down a short stretch of hall, skidding to a stop in the open doorway to his bedroom. Draco was still there, throwing things into his trunk, cursing vociferously. His hair had come down and hung loose around his face, brushing his shoulders. As Harry watched, he grabbed up a handful of hair in his fist and looked frantically around the room.
In his peripheral vision he saw Potter’s hand rise, and he had a flickering moment of alarm, wondering if he might be going to hit him, or push him away. Instead, his hand curled around Draco’s nape, his pinky finger teasing the shell of Draco’s ear.
“Oh, for fuck’s sake,” Draco finally said in exasperation.  “Just pick out another ring!”
Blaise nodded. "Yes. Just remember the old saying about not killing the messenger."
She was on break from Uni for her Spring Hols, and he’d thought she planned to sleep the two weeks away. Her pre-healer studies were rigorous, and from what he’d heard from Ginny she was exhausted. Leaning back to look into her eyes, he thought she didn’t look tired at all.
Draco did as she asked and greeted Pansy’s guests, offering drinks, pouring wine. He looked up at the door each time it opened, but for the first quarter of an hour it was neither of the people he most wanted to see. Finally, just as he was delivering a white wine spritzer to Pansy’s mother, he heard the smooth, sophisticated sound of his own mother’s voice. She was resplendent in ice blue robes, her hair in an artful crown of braids, and she smiled at him in delight as he came to her.
“And, these are for you, as well.”  Harry held out the roses, and was delighted by the blush that lightly stained Draco's cheeks.
“He sleeping, too.”
It had been the morning after Draco had left, he’d been frantic, and the note he’d left behind had been little better than nothing. He’d torn apart their bedroom, opened every drawer, every closet, looking for something, anything that might tell him where Draco had gone. When he’d finally gone in to the Ministry, he’d thrown his robes on over his street clothes and Floo’d from their living room. Shacklebolt had fought him on the idea of listing Draco as a missing person; he’d left a note, the man argued. He clearly wasn’t in any danger, he’d just left. Harry had been livid. He’d gone back to the trainee’s locker room, and rammed his fist into his locker so hard that he’d broken two bones in his right hand. That was where Hermione had come looking for him, and Harry had jammed the injured hand into his pocket to hide the evidence of his stupidity from her. Instantly, he’d felt something cold and cylindrical under his fingers. When he’d pulled his hand from his pocket, he’d been holding Draco’s ring.
“I doubt very many people would notice, actually,” he said softly. “Again, I’m sorry I bumped into you.” He started to step around the other man when a hand fell on his arm, stopping him. A hand with a curling tattoo across the back. He looked at it, then back up into Malfoy’s face. His expression was earnest.
Harry lifted his hand and cradled Draco’s jaw in his palm. “Yes, I thought you’d left me,” he said softly, his thumb touching Draco’s lower lip. “But I also never stopped hoping that you would come back. I didn’t want anyone else, Draco—” his voice dropped to a whisper, “—I’ll never want anyone else.”
The bell above the door rang as Harry pushed into Frombley’s. The door handle caught for a moment on the heavy rucksack he wore, and Harry paused just long enough to free it before walking up the aisle toward the back of the store. It seemed to him there were more garlands and glittery decorations up than there’d been just two days before, and he grimaced. Thank God the elves restrained some of their more exuberant impulses; his quarters were more festive than he might wish, but they had never looked like every decoration in London had exploded in the rooms.
“Draco,” Pansy said sharply. “What the bloody hell was that?”
The part of Harry that hated special treatment wanted to protest people having to stay late just to take care of him, but immediately on the heels of that was the knowledge that he couldn't. Not if he wanted to get laid.
Ron nodded, but his expression was not encouraging. "First thing, Mate. Whoever did this is scary smart. The reverse quit right at the mail room door."
“Thanks, Rosie,” Harry said, digging the correct number of galleons out of a deep robe pocket.
Malfoy straightened, looking down his pointed nose at Harry, even though they were nearly the same height. “Thank you.”
, not ‘shag against the wall’, or ‘blowjob on the sofa’, but relationship. He wondered that he could want a thing so desperately when he’d not known he wanted it at all, and yet, he did.
“Was it good?” he murmured. Draco chuckled weakly.
oooOOOooo
“Dinner?” Draco heard himself saying faintly.
“Mummy’s right,” Harry said. “That’s what I do.”
Scorpius held up his hands, palm out, his cheeks turning pink. “Sorry, sorry. You’re right. I should always speak to you respectfully.”
Harry didn’t enjoy clearing the carriages.  Causing the kids embarrassment had never been high on his list of things he liked to do. Particularly that last carriage; he knew some of the prof’s loved the idea of catching students with their ‘pants down’, as it were. Not Harry. Reducing a sixth year girl to tears because her gown was still in a pile in the corner didn’t make Harry’s night. At that point all he could really do was hope they’d used protection and send them on their way.
Draco looked up at Pansy over the rim of his wine glass. He’d been standing in the corner of her kitchen, sipping a very fine Shiraz, his mind occupied with the visit a certain very pretty ginger-haired girl had paid to his shop that afternoon.
Malfoy gave Harry an ironic look. “What, no food in Harry Potter’s heavily warded house?”
Malfoy snorted. “I think I’m insulted.”
“It’s yours.”
“Thank you.” Draco gave her an abbreviated bow. “I have my mobile – “ he dropped the silliness, “—should Mr Brennan turn south.” Mr Brennan had surgery that morning, and there had been complications that nearly made Draco cancel their evening. Harry didn’t wish the man ill, but still…
Neville laughed. “I’ve always wanted to be part of organized crime.”
“Potter,” he breathed. Harry felt the soft rush of air on his lips.
“Gods, I missed your mouth,” he said, his fingers once again in Harry’s hair. Harry hummed around him, relaxing his throat and taking Draco as deeply as he could, and Draco gasped, his hips lifting. Harry pressed him down and held him still, and began to move slowly up and down his length, his hand stroking in concert with his mouth. Draco’s fingers tightened around strands of Harry’s hair as his body began to shift restlessly. When Harry tasted the first traces of pre-come on his tongue, he pulled back, one final lick to the tip of Draco’s cock, then grabbed his hips and flipped him onto his stomach.
“Harry,” Draco said finally.
Today, Malfoy was wearing pale grey wool slacks and a darker grey fitted cashmere jumper over a silky white button-down and tastefully striped tie.  His hair was sleek, not so severe as it had been in school, slightly loose over his forehead and brushing his pale brows.  And the way he moved, Harry thought, swallowing deeply; hips canted slightly forward, long legs languid, narrow boot clad feet nearly silent on the hardwood floor.  Harry didn’t think he’d ever seen someone move like that… well, no one other than Malfoy.
Harry narrowed his eyes. “Oh, you’re hilarious,” Harry said, a clear warning in his tone. Malfoy held back just a touch as they headed for the door.
“Repeating information about a patient is unethical, Pansy, and Ronan knows it.”
He dropped the pretentious voice. "Even though the bastard doesn't have the decency to go to fat, eating in places like the cauldron. He probably still runs every day." He snapped the paper closed and dropped it onto the flames in the hearth. "Merlin, I wish he'd die." But that was a lie.
“Of course he is,” Draco muttered, making a valiant effort not to sound bitter. “His father was a war hero.”
“The house. The grounds. The other Malfoy properties.”
"Beats hell out of spending the night sitting on a freezing moor on a stakeout, which we've done, your Lordship," Ron said, and the young men exchanged grins.
“So, lubrication spells don’t work for you?” Draco asked breathlessly.
There was a press area set up to the right of the main doors; he'd managed to avoid it by arriving via a V.I.P. Floo; he hated the very idea of the thing but hated the press more. But now flashes from the cameras and shouts from the reporters over-rode the soft sound of background music and hushed conversation. When Harry saw the handsome couple posing for photos, their arms about one another's waists and their fashionable robes on display, his heart sank through his body to somewhere beneath the raised platform they sat on.
"We come early so we can spend enough time at the bar that the rest of the evening is palatable. Here, give me your cloak and I'll check it for you, while you go cast your spell on that infant behind the bar."
“Daddy!” Olivia cried, reaching out with her arms, leaning forward at a dangerous angle. Harry crossed to her quickly, placing one hand on her little belly to hold her in place.
~***~
"Arsehole. Yes, damn you, I'm close. Just -- don't stop!"
"Why?" Harry demanded. "Tell me why you hate me so much, other than sheer principal. Because I know you didn't hate me seventeen years ago. We had a mutually satisfying two weeks and parted. So what?"
“And it’s not all Gryffindors out there.” Pansy finished plating a tray of tiny quiches. “There’s at least one Ravenclaw. And he looks very dashing in his new robes, by the way.”
“She knows where all of the bodies are buried, Denny. And isn’t above using the information to get what she wants.” Harry shot the smaller man a wry look. “Fortunately, that will only get her so far. Under secretary to the under secretary in charge of Maintaining the Civil Rights of Magical Creatures is as far as she’ll ever get,” his smile ripened, “and that, my friend, is funnier than you’ll ever know.”
The high pitched voice sounded indignant and disbelieving, and Harry slowed as he neared the opening that led into the kitchen.
Harry felt color slipping up his neck even as she laughed lightly, and he followed her up the nearby staircase with one thought in his mind.
“This is great, Ron,” Harry said, smiling as he followed him up the walkway.
“She will.”
“Because you are.” Draco stalked closer to him.
“Oh,” he gestured awkwardly. “Christmas shoppers.”
“If we can’t all act like adults and be on a first name basis after this, then I despair of it ever happening. And you might take a lesson, you know. With Adrian there, can you really be calling him
"Well, yeah Dad," Al answered ironically. "But it's one thing to know something, and quite another to have Harry Potter walk in on your dinner." He didn't sound at all disgruntled, but Harry couldn't help but wonder.
"Trust me; if I were an Earl, I wouldn't be."
“He was thinking that he was worried about the two most important people in his life.”
Potter shook his head. “Just some unresolved things from when I was a kid.” He wiped his mouth with a napkin. “As a matter of fact, I thought I might make a short trip today.”
“Hey,” he protested, faintly wounded. “It’s not that bad.”
”? Draco said.
He shook his head. “I think I’m burned out on professions that might get me killed.”
“Uh huh.”
“In this file I have test results that prove, rather conclusively, that someone fairly high up in the Ministry tampered with my mind shortly after the war. I’m reasonably certain it was right after I got back from Australia, and before the trials were over.”
“And yours is shorter,” he teased. “I like it.” She smiled faintly.
“Oh.” Harry blinked. “Wait. Alice. As in…?”
Draco searched Potter's face.  “I hope so,” he murmured, turning the wine glass between his palms.  “Because today, I'm happier than I've felt in longer than I can remember.”
“Don’t say it,” Harry cut in quickly, unable to bear hearing it. “What do we have to do for it not to – be very bad?”
With a slight smile, Draco stood and left the sitting room. The fragrance lingered behind him, then slowly faded away.
He didn’t want to be here, and his mother knew it. If there was a single way that he would have been able to refuse… But even as he thought it, he was crossing to his bed and sitting on the edge heavily, reaching for one of the few things he’d brought back with him. His hand gentled unconsciously as he picked up the small framed photograph from the bedside table.
“Let me tell Hagrid we’re going, if… that’s the plan?”
“It was the closest I could get to actually having a pet. Other than the spiders.” Potter rubbed a hand over his face. “Jesus, let’s go. I don’t know what I thought I’d find here.”
“To a single gay man, or a married straight man, or a green man with purple stripes. As for the house, well, that can be fixed can’t it? And your percentage of the profits from Weasley’s Wizards Wheezes would more than cover the financial qualifications. Frankly, as long as the man in questions loves the child, I don’t much care about the rest. I was raised by parents who didn’t have much money.”
Harry shrugged. “I guess I hoped your curiosity might be stronger than your aversion to the room.”
“Then,” he said softly, running his palm up Potter’s chest and squeezing his shoulder, “we’ll… take some time.”
“Very nice,” she said with a slight smile. “I do wonder about the boots, though. Planning on riding later, are we?” Her eyes sparkled wickedly, and he smirked.
“I don’t suppose you have any fire whiskey?” he managed, his voice tight.
“I told Draco I think I look like Father Christmas,” he said a bit wryly.
“I don’t care about that,” Draco said, looking as excited as a little kid. “Where is it?”
Professor Bassett, the American DADA professor, was originally from Surrey. He was also the most patient man Harry had ever met, including Dumbledore, and a good deal of that patience was with Harry. He didn’t lose control of his magic anymore, but he did lose control of his temper, which was almost worse. But Bass, as he insisted Harry call him, never scolded him or recriminated him, just spoke to him calmly and kindly. The students were a bit in awe of him, which was annoying, but the scenery on the tallest peak of Mount Greylock in Massachusetts fed his soul. He heard from Ron and Hermione often; he knew when they found her parents and the effort she had to put in to helping restore their memories. He knew when Ginny was drafted by the Harpies and what the rest of their circle of friends was up to, but for some reason the fact Draco and Narcissa Malfoy had not gone to prison but had basically been banned from the wizarding world just never came up. As if it wasn’t important enough to mention. More likely someone thought it better if he didn’t know anything about the Malfoy’s at all.
“Part of me, the vengeful Malfoy part, wants him to never be reinstated.” He sighed. “The part of me that’s come to love Molly and Arthur wants to just let it go. I mean, it’s not Penelope and little Astrid’s fault their husband and father is a giant wanker. What do you think?”
“Malfoy,” he said with genuine pleasure. “Good to see you.” He turned to look down at Teddy. “And this must be Mister Lupin.”
“All right. The fact of the matter is – I find this uniform extremely sexy. Every time you wear it, I spend the entire evening standing behind things to hide my erection.”
“Teddy.” Draco’s voice was firm, stopping the boy before he could reach Harry. He skidded to a halt and turned, his little body stiff. “What did I tell you about how you need to approach Harry?”
They’d all taken the bet, and he’d won ten galleons off of each of them. What his friends hadn’t known, and frankly Harry hadn’t either, was if you took the cleaning and painting and patching his Aunt had forced him to do, then added magic, he was remarkably proficient at remodelling. He spent the entire summer working on the house, known locally as Mary’s Cottage after the old lady who’d spent the majority of her life there. Ron thought it was hilarious that his bi-sexual friend lived in a place called ‘Mary’s’; Harry told him he was a bloody arsehole and to shut it.
“Don’t feel like you have to go slow on my account,” Harry said. “Just – “
He narrowed his eyes. “Oh, har har. You’re hilarious.”
Draco was still angry about the years he felt Percy had stolen from them. He reasoned if Harry had stayed in the UK and testified for him, Draco never would have been sent to the Muggle world to fend for himself. Harry couldn’t disagree. He always wondered how much more of a relationship they might’ve had if he hadn’t gone off to America twenty years before. He also couldn’t help but think of Molly and Arthur, and how much Percy’s actions had hurt the family.
Harry felt his cheeks heat.
"Slut," Draco said lightly, and Harry snorted. Draco examined the front of his tan leather jacket, giving a nearly imperceptible sigh of relief that there were no spots on it before slipping it off and hanging it over the back of the chair.
The man’s hands curled into fists, but one of his companions had apparently finally been able to see through the haze of alcohol hanging around them, and he caught the big mouth’s elbow.
“Molly sees it. I know. Can we maybe get out of the middle of the floor?”
“I am,” Harry said easily. “But I’m also a Vet. I should have a passing knowledge, at least, of all animals. Besides,” Harry smiled as the cardinal flew away and he watched the splash of red that soared through the bright blue morning sky, “I love cardinals. Even tropical birds aren’t brighter. The males, anyway.”
He found her sitting on the bed folding laundry; she’d told him that was how she planned to spend her day. Arthur, bless him, had the children with him at Auntie Muriel’s; she hollered every question, and the kids thought she was hysterically funny. It was extremely entertaining for Arthur, Molly got freedom to bake without him hanging over her shoulder, and Hermione got to do laundry without any little hands wanting to ‘help’. Ron was on a training assignment with the new recruits, but Kingsley had personally promised he’d be home the morning of the twenty-third. If he wasn’t, Hermione had said, she planned to make the minister very, very sorry.
As Draco collected his two fabric bags from the pimply young man bagging his groceries and stepped out of the line, the man approached him.
“Let’s not get them too riled up before bed, please,” Draco said. “He didn’t nap and he’s over tired as it is.”
“Thank you, Kyle.”
Draco exhaled. “It’s not my place to mind.”
"Thanks so much." Harry didn't laugh hysterically, but it was a near thing.
He felt her eyes all the way down the hall.
Harry snorted. “I’m sure we can come up with an equitable solution that will work for both of us.”
Draco turned to look at him, about to remind him about little ears, but the laughter dancing in Potter’s eyes undid him, and they began to laugh together. It was the first time, to his recollection, that had ever happened. They rested their foreheads together as the laughter ran its course, and Draco caught Harry’s hand, squeezing it.
Harry groaned. “Come on, Ron. You know both of us. Will you tell me what the hell is going on here? Because I’m at a loss.”
Harry studied his face for long seconds. “Don’t you think having a relationship with his Mum would be good for him?”
Harry exhaled slowly, loosening his fingers. "I did, yeah. And you know I'm not fond of these bloody things."
He slipped the mobile back into his pocket and crossed his arms, waiting for Weasley and Parkinson to arrive.
“You don’t feel that way, do you?” Hermione caught his hand and squeezed it. “Because you aren’t you know. Not at all.”
“I know that.” She frowned, flustered. “But he is a man who jumps motorcycles for a living, Draco.”
Draco was waiting, and Harry blinked, trying to regain his train of thought. “Oh, uhm…” He gestured his head toward the little boy on the floor and Draco glanced at Teddy, nodding.
She gave him a slight smile. “Well, that’s going to depend entirely on how willing you are to share.”
Draco spread his legs, sighing in contentment when the bulge in Harry’s boxers lined up seamlessly with the burgeoning one in his own. Harry brought his mouth down to his, kissing him with first soft, teasing touches, then opening his lips and deepening the connection, his tongue sweeping past Draco’s teeth to caress the inside of his mouth. Draco sighed into it, his hand lifting to slide through Harry’s hair as the spot very near his groin rubbed against the corresponding spot near Harry’s, and he felt a wonderful, warm surge of magic. The sound Harry made, almost a contented growl, told Draco that he’d felt it, too.
She looked straight ahead determinedly. “The Room of Requirement.”
“What’re you doing?” Harry asked, coming into the room. Draco gave him an incredulous look.
“Then you need peppermint butterscotch ice cream,” she said with an air of authority. “When I feel icky Daddy brings me some, and then I’m all better.”
As the vote for the bill was called, Harry felt a distinct touch between his shoulder blades. He turned to look at the doorway to the chamber, which was packed with people watching the vote. Aides, assistants, the press and hangers on. Even with the crowd of people Harry immediately spotted the tall, slender man in smart slacks, high-necked blue jumper and Harry's black leather jacket. His grey eyes were firmly fixed on Harry's face, and when he saw Harry looking, he smiled. Harry had recognized the spell as Draco's when it touched him, and he nodded, delight filling his chest. He had so wanted Draco to be here for this.
Harry found his feet unsteadily, trying to find purchase on the ground with his cane.  When he finally straightened, he realized he was inches from Draco’s face, so close he could see the flecks of darker gray in his quicksilver eyes. He could also see that Malfoy’s lashes were pale, and thick, and his skin was perfect, smooth without a freckle or blemish. His bone structure had matured, the faintly pointed chin and nose still in evidence but now his cheekbones were high and strong and his lips were full. Harry found his eyes dropping to them, studying them, wondering what they would taste like…
“That was convincing,” he teased. He looked at his watch. “I need to head down to the Great Hall. I promised Ted I’d have dinner with him.”
“Tell me it’s over,” Draco whispered against his ear. “Please. Just tell me it’s all over.”
“Now this,” Harry bent until his mouth was level with the tip of the gracefully arched prick, taking it in his hand, “this is beautiful.” He flicked his tongue out and collected some of the slickness from the head of Draco’s hardness, curling his tongue under the collar of his foreskin and swirling it around the tip. Draco’s fingers sank into Harry’s hair and he arched up, long body stretching on the bed. Harry ran one hand up over Draco’s stomach then to a sharp hipbone, holding him pressed to the bed when Draco would have thrust into his mouth. The hand around the elegant prick moved up and down, pulling his foreskin back and pressing his tongue into the dripping slit.
Potter glanced back at him and his eyes were so stark Draco felt like he’d actually struck him.
“They’re in the kitchen,” she answered, retrieving her crayola. “Talking about you.”
“You complaining?”
Malfoy grimaced. “I’m sorry. I didn’t think – “
He pressed in and Harry came awake with an agonized cry. Lurching over, he grabbed Malfoy’s wand in his hand and curled his fingers into the collar of the white coat. He yanked Malfoy in and jabbed the wandtip just under Malfoy’s chin, pressing hard, before Hermione or Ron could so much as move. They stared at each other, and Hermione saw Malfoy’s long throat move as he swallowed.
“Oh, bollocks,” she responded with more bite to her voice than Harry thought he’d ever heard. She knelt on the hearth, heavy purple robes bunching beneath her knees. Her hair was pulled back to the nape of her neck, small tendrils curling around her face and down against her throat. She was lovely; he’d always thought so. But today she looked tired, too. “You do remember Old Alamander Phipps, Representative from Dorset?”
Harry’s throat was tight with disappointment, and he felt as if was being dismissed.  It wasn’t a rational response, but then he’d never been particularly rational where Draco was concerned.  “Yeah, I can do that.”
Frombley pooh-poohed. “Son, remember; I’ve seen your scores at UNI. I’d wager you could sit it today without an issue.”
He spent the next five minutes tapping his bottom lip with the gray feather. Hermione had gone to the more efficient fountain pen, but Harry liked trimming the nib, dipping it into the ink. He used a green so dark in was nearly black, and his penmanship had improved a lot since his school days. Some of that had to do with a Uni prof who wrote on one of his essays that writing unintelligibly was not the answer to producing a decent paper, nor acquiring a decent grade. Hermione being reduced to hysterics when he told her convinced him that practicing his penmanship was probably a necessity. The problem now wasn’t how the words looked, it was what he wanted them to say.
Every time he saw Harry in his teacher’s robes, Draco was convinced he’d never seen anyone more handsome in the whole of his life. Even with the disreputable hair, there was something about Harry dressed in a shirt, waistcoat and tie with his dark slacks under the black and red robes. Every day, Draco saw his partner in his usual uniform, and his heart would lift. Seeing him now, Draco could only stare.
He followed Teddy into the sleigh, still with no idea where they were going. The woods were thick around them, the heady scent of pine in the air, and Draco tucked a fur blanket over their laps as the driver climbed up onto his seat and flicked the reigns. The horses pulled, and the sleigh jerked into motion. Harry put his arm around Teddy to hold him in place, because he was literally bouncing in excitement, and Draco caught his other hand beneath the blanket, linking their fingers. Harry sent him a slight smile, leaning back to enjoy the ride, where ever it might be taking them.
Draco had never heard anyone who sounded less sorry for anything.
Draco huffed out a laugh. “I imagine it does. At any rate, the location is convenient but the place is so hideous that I allow no one to see it. Ever.”
"I know that. You deviant." Harry sucked on his skin again, more enthusiastically. Draco pressed his prick against Harry's hipbone.
They walked several blocks, Malfoy apparently perfectly happy to maintain his silence and Harry unable to think of a single thing to say that wouldn’t sound stupid. Hermione’s comment that he was obsessed, more like. Particularly sixth year… seemed to hang between them. He wasn’t sure what to say after that; it had revealed far too much for his peace of mind, and he really just hoped Malfoy would completely forget about it. He was staring down at the asphalt, now glimmering with dampness from the fog, when brilliant lights reflected in the water caused him to look up. He stopped, staring up at what appeared to be an enormous angel made entirely of Christmas lights.
Granger snorted softly, then covered a smile with her hand.
“Padma,” Harry said, looking at her over the back of the sofa. “I’m serious about the papers. Please.”
“You,” she said archly, “are a wicked, wicked man who is no doubt going straight to hell.”
“Tell him to start pulling water from the castle. We know the Thestrals aren’t eating the underbrush, and the centaurs aren’t, but the unicorns are. Maybe he can move the herd?”
"Yeah," Harry said curtly. "Maybe." He'd never seen a mind healer after the war was over, despite being told he probably should. He'd reasoned, why should he when he had Hermione around. "She might be right; I dunno."
“I’ll tell you as soon as we’re on the ground.”
There was a commotion, and a flurry of muttered conversations just behind them, and Harry turned his head, watching.
Harry turned, the photo still in his hands, as Pansy sailed into the room.  She was wearing a bright red dress and towering heels, and her hair swung easily against her shoulders.  She saw the photo in his hands, and cocked her head to one side inquisitively.
“There’s something I need from my office.”
Touching the face of the dark-haired man in the photo with a tender brush of his thumb, Draco sighed. Irritated at his sentimentality, he dropped the pictures back into the drawer and pushed it closed. He was startled moments later when Knobly popped into the space just in front of him. Draco's heart slammed into his ribs.
She stopped abruptly, staring at Harry, her eyes and mouth wide.
“And you,” he said to Harry, not releasing his hand when Harry went to stand, “come back here and kiss me, and make it good. I may have to wait
“Very much so,” Draco said emphatically.
Draco still couldn’t respond, but his eyes dropped again to Potter’s lips.
"Harry." She sighed. "I know you, remember? Are you trying to tell me that you'd honestly rather… sleep around than have a real relationship?"
“Five minutes, Draco,” she said sternly. “I’ll go down to the cafeteria and get a coffee.”
"Don't worry about it, Justin. Truly, they don't care as long as there's food." Harry watched his guys smiling and nodding as Ron passed along the news.
For as long as Draco could remember, visiting Pennymustard’s had been one of his favorite holiday traditions.  He’d begun accompanying his mother when he was very small, standing next to her at the counter as she’d painstakingly picked out the prizes for the crackers that would grace their plates for Christmas dinner.  No paper hats or balloons for Malfoy’s; the crackers had held everything from small brooms that flew to jewelry for the adults, to live fairies that sang as they hovered above the plates.  Narcissa Malfoy’s Christmas dinners had been legend, and the crackers had enhanced that image.  Since the war, the parties had become more modest, but the crackers were still very much a part of the celebration.
Harry nodded wearily.
They were inside of Babbity Rabbity for perhaps ninety seconds, just long enough to ask ‘Miss Penny’ to walk Adrian to the house at the end of his class, then Harry wrapped his arm around Draco’s waist and pulled him close, Apparating to St. Mungo’s in three quick jumps. They arrived in the vast, marble floored lobby, and Draco pulled away, pushing through the large, milling crowd while Harry was still getting his breath back and settling his stomach. He didn’t know why, but Apparating with a side-along always accentuated the effects. When he arrived behind Draco at the reception desk, he found him already in the middle of a spirited argument.
“Get him to a specialist tonight rather than wait eleven days? Yes.” Ginny’s tone was emphatic. “Absolutely.”
hpdmhpdmhpdmhpdm
“Okay,” Teddy said. “Can I sit by the window?”
Quick footsteps sounded from down the hall and Hermione turned to see a tall, lean man with short blond hair, wearing a long exam coat, dark trousers and dark tortoise shell glasses. It took her a moment to realize she was watching Draco Malfoy as he came toward them. She hoped she didn’t look as surprised as she felt, but he looked…different. Not physically so much, but it was his attitude. The cringing snark was gone and in its place was a silent confidence and command. It was very attractive.
Draco sputtered, then stopped, his whole demeanour very still.
Draco gave him a steady glare. “For suggesting a Hogwarts Professor might be dating an underage student? Care to make a wager?”
Harry stared at her, impressed. “George said that about Malfoy?”
“I hope it won’t embarrass you gentlemen if I tell you what a pleasure it is to meet you.”
“Hello, Harry Potter,” she said brightly.
“No need to apologize, Clara,” Harry said gently. He glanced behind him at the missive on his desk. “I do plan to have a discussion with the Minister about that bird.”
Harry huffed. “I hate to disappoint, but I’m not a yeti. And you are a freak.”
hpdmhpdmhpdm
Malfoy smiled, but there was more than a hint of melancholy in it. “My uncle Marsdon is a vintner. He owns a winery in the south of France, and their champagne has won awards internationally.” He sighed softly, picking up his glass. “He fell out with my father during the first war, when he refused to support Voldemort financially. But the family wine is still excellent.” He saluted them with the glass, and Harry picked up the bottle and studied the label. It read, ‘
Jory’s lips pursed, and he pulled Hermione’s note from the envelope.
Harry recognized the voice as the one who’d answered the intercom from the gate.
Apparently everyone was watching Draco. He lifted his head to find all of the eyes around the table on him. And once again, McGonagall lifted her drink, this time in a coffee cup, to salute him.
Harry had been horrified at first. He didn’t do ‘blokes’, he’d stammered. The boy had merely smiled at him, and slipped to his knees at Harry’s feet. What he’d done with his mouth had been a miracle, and after that, Harry had been more than amenable to fucking him. Twice. Well, two and half times, if you counted the inexperienced blow job Harry had been convinced to try somewhere in the darkest hours of the night. He’d come four times that night, harder than he ever had in his life.
Harry exchanged greetings with a couple of fourth year Gryffindors and the Slytherin prefect; it always amazed him how much friendlier the Slyherins were to him now that he was engaged to their head of house. (Draco said ‘now that he was fucking their head of house’, but Harry couldn’t even think that without turning bright red; that he still blushed entertained Draco utterly).The kids were heading to fifth hour, and he knew Draco didn’t have a class so he was going down to see if he could catch him in their quarters. He’d had an owl from Kingsley that morning, and he wanted to discuss the contents with Draco before he sent a response.  Harry arrived at their door and put his palm in the middle of it; moments later, he heard it unlock and opened it.
Harry paused and looked back, his hand on the doorknob.
"Yeah, I do. Relax, Harry. I spoke to the company who provide the free cruising lifts. There will be no abrupt moves. You go to mid pitch for the coin toss, then hover at about eighty feet for the match. There's a barrier spell on all the perimeters, and levelling charms built in. You're as safe here as you would be in your living room."
They stared at each other, and her eyes narrowed and hardened. Harry was abruptly glad she wasn’t his wife. “Oh, really. Then it would appear my husband has some explaining to do.”
"I have to take that one," she said. "You can give him this one. They're virtually the same, but for the signature." She lowered her voice. "You can sign that one, if you want."
“There could be… people who wish Adrian and myself harm.” Their eyes swivelled back to Malfoy, and the one in the blue t-shirt narrowed his eyes.
"I said, I love you, too." Harry let go of the post and slowly took the few steps separating them. When he was close enough to touch, he held out Draco's wand. "Please don't Apparate."
“I understand,” he murmured. “And I’ll do whatever you think is necessary for Teddy’s education.”
Neither noticed that the ribbon tying the messages they carried was not the colour they’d begun with. But then, it had long been rumoured that owls were colour blind.
“I’ve come with a message,” Malfoy said, linking his hands at his lower back and standing stiffly. He stood like he was at parade rest, and Harry realized he’d always stood like he was in the military. “Hagrid asked me to tell you that it’s too cold for you to come down tonight. He’s concerned that after spending so much time in the Caribbean, you might – catch something.” His lip curled but he didn’t make a sarcastic comment. “He’s secured the ill creatures in the paddock, and he’ll see you in the morning.”
Draco could scarcely breathe. The air felt trapped in his chest, and Potter’s eyes were so green, so close. His hand had dropped away, which made Draco’s stomach drop, but he was still so close Draco could taste Potter’s breath on his lips. It was sweet and sharp with mint and something else that reminded him of sugar cookies. His heart was pounding in his throat so hard he was amazed the other man couldn’t hear it.
She gave him a weak smile. “Not clever enough, apparently.”
He stopped, his hands dropped to his hips and his head falling forward.
Draco blinked. He’d been caught out simply staring, and he felt his face grow warm as he settled himself into the wooden chair opposite with as much dignity as he could manage. Harry turned his head to look down at Olivia as he placed the nipple of the bottle against her lips, and she latched on, her chubby hand coming up to lay against the back of Harry’s as he held the bottle. It looked so small and pale against his tawny skin and Draco stared, wishing he had a camera so that he could capture the image.
Ron studied Harry's face. "Ballenger," Ron said crisply. His second in command turned to him.
“It was good,” Draco answered, surprised to find that he actually was so cold that his jaw felt tight.  “Mother was there, of course.  Pansy and Ryan.  And my aunt and my cousin.”
Hermione spoke softly, and Harry was certain only he was aware of the way Draco stiffened at the use of his surname.
Hermione made a choked sound and began to giggle, and Harry had to bite his lip. He opened his eyes and looked at Ron, only to find him red-faced and floundering, and took pity on him.
Draco’s eyes narrowed, but his pulse rate suddenly picked up.  “What exactly are we talking about here?
"Why would we?"
The Healer drew himself up to his full height, his chest puffing out. “I will not take responsibility if this foolishness sets back his recovery.”
Several minutes later, when he’d changed out of his scrubs and was making himself a pot of tea, he slipped it under a magnet a previous tenant had left behind, affixing it to the refrigerator door.
Pansy looked at him over the top of her desk, a slight smile pulling at the corner of her lips.
"Did anyone on your team know you planned to see Harry Friday night?"
“I still think it would be better coming from us,” Hermione was saying.
“That means the Hogwarts children can come home as well, doesn’t it?”
Draco smacked Harry’s chest. “Stow it, or great Chief Auror.” He ran his hands through his hair and Harry admired the way the muscles worked in his chest. “We’ve both got demanding jobs.”
“We’re trying.”
“Whatever are you looking for?” Hermione asked in a sharp tone as he went through the stack of letters again, carefully one at a time. He looked up at her.
again. Dammit, Draco, we admitted not an hour ago that we love one another. I'm sorry I left that morning; sorrier than you'll ever know, but I won't tell you I'm sorry Lils was born! Are you sorry Scorpius was?"
Hertfordshire was always several degrees colder than London, and now had six inches of snow where London’s streets were bare. They crunched through the thin layer of ice on the snow, not speaking, perfectly comfortable to merely be  in one another’s company. When they arrived at the alley holding the Apparition point, there was no line; Hertfordshire wasn’t exactly a hot bed of people who worked at the Ministry. Harry walked into the alley, pulling Draco after him, and stood on the gold Ministry symbol inlaid in the cobbles. He slipped his arm around Draco’s waist, pulled him in snug against his chest, and Draco gave him a slow, sultry smile. Harry’s lips twitched, and they disappeared with a soft ‘pop’.
Malfoy sneered. “How lovely it must be to be you. People just believe what you say, no matter what tripe you’re selling.”
“He’s down near the end,” Draco answered.  “Just past Gringotts.  And his work really is rather remarkable.”  Draco had found himself standing near the open fronted shop earlier, admiring the intricately woven baskets.  A selection for wine bottles, with cooling charms woven into the design, had caught his eye and he’d considered buying one for his mother.
His brother.
Ron slid into the chair Hermione had vacated, taking Harry’s hand. “Harry, if I thought I could get away with standing over him during surgery with my wand pointed at his head, I would. And if anything happens, we’ll sic Rosie on him.”
. What’s that all about?”
“Merlin’s pants, Potter,” he said, sounding irritated but only until Harry lowered his weight down onto his prone body. “Oh, gods,” he moaned, spreading his long, slender thighs, pushing up with his feet flat on the sofa cushions. Harry reached between them, finding Draco’s hardness with the palm of his hand and stroking him firmly.
Harry felt his face heat. Rosmerta was one of only a very few people still alive who knew he’d nearly killed Malfoy during their sixth year. It had taken her a year after he returned as the DADA professor to even speak to him.
“Thank you, Ms Grain…er…” He looked up at Draco, panic clear.
“I’ll take a hot cider, Sammy.” He turned and casually surveyed the room, checking for students while trying to appear not to. There was a table of fourth years in the far corner who’d noticed him with alarm and seemed to be trying to hide their mugs nonchalantly while looking anything but.
His best friend owed him an explanation.
oooOOOooo
Harry nodded weakly, but Draco was reassured when his breathing settled into a slow, steady rhythm as he fell asleep.
Harry had received the owl that morning, early, well before the sun had risen. So early that he was still in bed, unconscious thanks in no small part to the four beers he’d had with Ginny. And the sleepless hours after that he’d sat in the dark in his sitting room, staring into nothing, reliving that last week, over and over again.
He heard her sniff, and felt worse.
she’d written,
Kingsley Shakelbolt
“But I’m an arse you want, Potter.” He leaned closer still, until their lips were only millimetres apart. “You,” he licked Harry’s upper lip, “are hard, too.”
It truly hadn’t been a midlife crisis when Harry and Ginny ended their marriage, and least he hadn’t thought so at the time. He hadn’t cheated, which was what the
“I happened to see him… following the call of nature once.” He shuddered. “It was terrifying. I nearly swore off of men forever.”
He looked up into Harry’s eyes and felt himself color. He hated it when he blushed. But Harry was eyeing him, green eyes heated, and he was grateful for the darkness. Suddenly Harry stood and took a deep breath, running his hand through his hair which didn’t help the way it looked but didn’t particularly hurt it, either. He turned away, and Draco could tell by his movements that he was adjusting himself in his jeans. He hoped he was hard, too. Harry took a few steps
Aaron glared at him, then grabbed his heavy jacket from a peg on the wall and stalked to the door. He paused with his hand on the knob.
Pansy's brow creased. "So just like that my being Draco's
Harry hesitated. “Not so much, no.”
"Street cred?" Ron snorted.
“Cider for the grown-ups,” she gave Draco a pointed look, “and Master Teddy, it’s being time for your lunch.”
The tub wasn't huge, but it was certainly big enough for the two of them. Potter handed Draco a glass, and took the other one for himself.
His mother had been holding his hand under the thick lap robe of dark fur, and she leaned close.
She frowned, but stopped.
“You okay for this?” Harry asked.
“Don’t sell yourself short, lad. Hermione’n I had our heads together for weeks and didn’t come up with it. You’ve a wonderful way with the creatures, and that matters.”
The littlest ones, however, seemed to be fascinated by him. For some reason, the little buggers liked him, and it wasn’t because of the fact he was ‘Harry Potter’. They couldn’t know that. They just knew he was new, and he was interesting, and before he knew it he had three toddlers, all about two years old, vying for his attention.
"How dare he," he thought, the bloody berk. This was some sort of stunt, it had to be. The idea that Potter might request a favour from him was ludicrous. Draco stalked to the main bathroom door, unable to think of one single swear word strong enough for the occasion, and yanked the door to the hall open, nearly dislocating his shoulder in the process.
