With an arched eyebrow, he looked at me. I would like to say, Harry, that I thought him a bit ignorant, but he probably just doesn't know about the meaning of the occasion other than what they teach in Astronomy. "Sinistra has been going on about that all March. How is the cycle of the earth related to me talking to Seamus?"
,” I whispered, feeling the tingle and coil of intense magic between us. I closed my eyes, lovely, feeling the two of us fuse together, two souls merging and then… Draco you know what I saw then.
It didn’t escape me, the way your eyes darted over to me, checking whether I was quipping or not, precious, thoughtful darling that you are. But just in that moment – in anticipation of music and champagne, still feeling the relief rushing through my system that I wasn’t in Azkaban or cast out on the street but sitting in our drawing room with you who I love more than words can say and kisses can show – in that moment, Robards was nothing but a ludicrous caricature of an imperial, righteous Head Auror to me. I felt good yesterday evening, ecstatic even. And so well-treated and loved by you.
Hogsmeade village was great fun too, and I thoroughly enjoyed walking down the High Street holding your hand. The whole world could see we were a couple. True, we might have got a few double-takes from the village residents, and a few stares, but overall people were kind, weren’t they? I thought the wizard behind the till in Dervish and Bangs was agreeable when we took my telescope to be fixed. What was it that he said? “Good for you, lads. Follow your hearts and your happiness. Ain’t nobody able to live your lives ‘cept yourselves.”
You know, I think you’re absolutely correct about the pair of them. Yes, the two of them did sleep in each other’s bed occasionally, but they’ve been doing that for years, and I – being the oblivious git that I am – thought it must be a comfort thing. You know: close friends, finding a bit of consolation when the going got tough or the homework piled high, and I never thought too much about it.
Harry, my love. After my ramblings on cravings for candied fruits, finding recognition, and autonomy, I need to tell you something important. Very important, so read this thoroughly.
I have a vision, my love, and please don’t think that it is too gauche. I want our home to feel bright and homely, with art canvases on the walls and big comfortable settees. I don’t want anything austere, or cold. Grimmauld needs to be a sanctuary, and for you, a working environment too.
Fuck, but the day that you were brought in by Snatchers, Greyback amongst them – do you realise that it’ll be one year since? You told me how you were on the run right before you were brought to the Manor, camping in dense forest, without food, perhaps losing track of time. But it’ll be one year on the day tomorrow.
Truthfully, I think the four of them want the inside scoop on our romance; ever since our article came out, we’re been quite the school celebrities. For the first time in my life, I’m relishing being gossiped about. You do know, don’t you, that I understand you’re more than the charming, misunderstood wizard who has stolen my heart? You’re my other half, my fiancé – basically, my everything – but if it helps the rest of the world to believe that narrative, I’m not going to argue with them. I love you, Draco Malfoy, and find that the more I learn about you and the more I get to know you, the more my ardour grows. Tomorrow, I’ll love you more, and that’s exactly how it’ll be for the rest of our lives.
One day we’ll go back to Whitby, and then we’ll take that walk along the beach, holding hands and luxuriating in the simple pleasure of each other’s company. Bizarrely enough, the pair of us aren’t a million miles from each other even now. Two hours on a broom at the very most.
While I might have been one of those students to brag about my supposed experiences, I’ll simply tell you the truth. I have experienced exactly one ridiculously callow kiss (seriously, I thought I’d die of nervousness) which was followed by a very drunken blowjob two days later which was followed by me getting dumped the morning after. Happened at the start of sixth year. That sums up the entirety of my experience.
Was it chosen for you as a goal to live up to, Draco? To be feared and dreaded like the dragons of Muggle legend? Hoarders of great piles of gold and power? Perhaps that was the intent, but that isn’t everything that dragons are, is it? I've seen dragons. Fought them. Felt their scaly flesh beneath my fingers.
You said that you fear you might have provided evidence against Mother and I. I can assure you that this will hardly be the case. If you asked me, I should be rotting away in Azkaban. I haven’t only been sentenced because someone in my family was involved in Death Eater activity. I was sentenced for my very own crimes. I told you that I tried not to do anything at all as soon as everything went to the dogs – and Merlin knows I did try – but it wasn’t entirely possible.
Draco grabbed some cleaning supplies and made his way out to the main lobby. He smiled to himself. It wasn’t that he didn’t mind playing rock every night, but he just didn’t understand the game. It was Sally who taught it to him (his excuse for not knowing was that he had went to French boarding schools his entire life where the game simply didn’t exist), and it was also Sally who swore that it was a logic game. “Something has to beat something else and in turn be beaten by something else,” She would claim. Yet, that didn’t make sense to him because there is no way that paper could annihilate rock. It just wasn’t possible! He continued to think about the game and Sally while he wiped down tables and swept for the next hour and a half.
“You look nice tonight.” Harry mentally reprimanded himself for such a shitty icebreaker. He wasn’t trying to flirt with Draco—he was trying to talk to him.
“No, I picked her up from the pound. She was already named. Besides, I wouldn’t name a cat ‘Halloween’ either,” Draco replied, pointing to the brown and orange cat.
They continued talking for the better part of an hour. Until, finally, at 10:15, Harry had to go. Ron and Hermione decided to stick around in order to play with Teddy.
"You do? That's fantastic! Where at?" she leaned towards him. Harry knew that she was very particular about her body language. Sometimes he wondered if her personality around him was simply a façade she put up for patients.
Andromeda smiled in response. She pulled the rest of the food out and put their milkshakes in their magicked freezer. When Harry moved in, it seemed that they had silently agreed to have a mixture of muggle appliances and wizard technology. Andromeda shook her head when she pulled out the third burger.
Hermione and Ron left an hour later and Harry was pretty relieved. He had needed a cigarette very badly. When he stepped out onto the back porch, he yet again found himself smoking with Draco Malfoy.
As Harry wandered onto the uni’s campus, he observed his surroundings and thought back on his life. Was this really where he wanted to end up: not as an auror or Quidditch star, but rather a muggle student? Yes, he decided.
Both men had awaited this day with anticipation, yet for different reasons. Harry was worried that this one date could make or break their relationship—a gross oversimplification. Draco was worried that Harry would finally learn just how evil he really was—some unfair self-deprecation.
Mostly everyone had left by midnight. Harry walked around snacking on the leftover candy with Fleur and Bill. Eventually, he excused himself for a cigarette and they joined Narcissa and Andromeda in the living room.
"Why do you think that it was so easy to have one teacher for each subject? Hogwarts has grown more than I, Dumbledore, or any of the Founders could have predicted."
“Yup, yup. Uncle Harry is awake,” Harry groggily said. He rubbed his head and put his glasses on. “C’mon, little man.
At that time, Harry decided to raid Ted’s old library for some books to read. He chose to settle on Fahrenheit 451. He stopped reading about an hour later and sat outside to smoke and watch the sunrise.
.          “That’s fantastic!” Andromeda exclaimed. She grinned widely. “Are you busy? Harry was just showing me the school. You might like to join us.”
“She has helped me a lot, and, recently, she’s been asking me to reflect on my life and myself and my...er...relationships.”
.          “Wow! Twenty. I, um, you…you’re some of the last family I have. My daughter Nymphadora died. Sirius died. Regulus died. You’re, you’re my nephew! I’d like to…you’re one of the last of the Blacks. I’d like to contact you from time to time. Make sure you’re eating and all that.” She was playing with her hands and twiddling her thumbs while she spoke. It was the same thing that she did when she spoke at some of the funerals after the war. It was a nervous habit.
.          “He likes hair a lot,” Potter stated. He stood hunched over a bit, but Draco could see that the man had gotten much taller in the past year or two. They were now close to the same height, probably. Once upon a time, Potter had stood nearly half a foot shorter than Draco, abnormally short compared to Draco’s 5’8. He had also gotten much more fit since the war.
Several hours passed before Draco finally calmed down. He flushed all of his drugs and poured his liquors down the sink. He was going to get better. He had to get better. He was finally not feeling high, so he was pretty confident about his meeting. He’d rarely ever been “manic” before, and he wasn’t completely familiar with not feeling like shit. He took a long, lukewarm shower.
.          It was Harry’s turn to nod. He took his fork out of his lap and laid it on his plate. “Just…” he replied, “Don’t expect a reply from him. He can be very mean and cruel. Even if he’s not…
. He’d swept, vacuumed, dusted, and washed the dishes from time to time, executive dysfunction be damned; the only problem was the messiness and clutter. Harry picked up all of his dirty clothes and shoved them into the closet in the lounge. He cleared some things off the sofa and pushed everything out of the way of the fireplace. Grabbing some of the floo powder from the pot on top of the mantle, Harry prepped for his small journey.
Draco sighed and kept crawling. He stood up once he got to the kitchen and paced towards the employee bathroom.
Draco scooped both of them up in his arms and carried them to another room. He came back and said, “Hope you’re not allergic to cats.”
At 5AM, Draco, Sally, and Fab were extremely tired and more than ready to leave. Draco had had another shot to steady himself out around 4:30—one of the only benefits of this job was the (limited) free drinks. He and the girls walked home. He could see Sally watching him out of the corner of her eye; she was concerned and watching for signs of inebriety. He had previously tried to inform her that he rarely felt alcohol until he’d had at least 5 shots and a few other drinks. That only seemed to worry her more, so he dropped it.
Teddy reached out for Harry. Harry positioned his godson on his shoulders and walked them through his house. They’d visited before, but Harry had since then added some more furniture and décor, including a huge bookcase that took up an entire wall of his den. After they checked out the house, Harry took them on a tour of the immediate Manchester area. They visited some of his favorite shops and a nearby park.
Harry sat down in his favorite seat in Dr. Shelly's office. He'd always picked the one closest to the door, in case he needed to escape or…something. He didn't know why he did it. It just felt weird to switch things up. Maybe this was a "symptom." Sometimes he felt like everything was a "symptom."
Harry sat Teddy in his playpen and proceeded to make French toast and sausage. At 8:30, when there was nothing else to do, he sat down to work on his Earth Science essay.
Draco sighed deeply, frustrated with his mother’s impatience and stubbornness. She had been sending him at least two letters a week since Christmas. He had cut off contact with her after they visited his father in Azkaban. Azkaban wasn’t the same as the last time he saw it—back when the war was still going on. There were hardly any dementors left, but the prisoners were still kept in nearly solitary cells. The only time they saw people that weren’t in the cell directly across from theirs was during cell checks, meal times, and visiting.
” Harry exclaimed in disbelief. He checked the clock in the kitchen. “How? I know I didn’t sleep for 14 hours!”
“Yes! I wanted to hide from you. Merlin, it seems silly now. Oh, and I remember that you thought your father was going to buy you a gift.”
Draco fixated his eyes on the officer’s mole. It was located just above his right eyebrow and was by far Draco’s favorite place to stare while spacing out. He’d tried the floor, but Dousselsnorf always called him out. He’d tried the pictures on Dousselsnorf’s desk, but he was unusually secretive about his private life. He’d tried the clock, but that didn’t work because the second hand always got stuck right around the ten, so then he’d be thinking about how much time Dousselsnorf was losing and how that had to affect his productivity and—
“No, no, no. It’s not possible,” Harry silently pleaded, “The same uni is enough, but the same class? Bloody hell. Shit. Fu-“
"That sounds good. Are you experiencing any other bad side effects?" She took out her clipboard and pen.
They shook hands, and the man showed Harry the schedule for the sixth year students. He would be assisting Ms. Claire’s reading and math classes, as well as overseeing recess. Then he would leave during lunch.
“I just can’t wait for this year to be over with so we can finally learn something relatively interesting. I mean, I guess our “practical” lessons are fun, but I want something with more action.”
drifted off to sleep, but this was progress. Harry was slowly getting ready for his 11AM therapy appointment. He got up from the loveseat on the porch, put his cigarette out, and went back inside. Andromeda was bathing Teddy, so Harry decided that he would make them all breakfast. He made a few crumpets, cooked scrambled eggs, and cut up some fruit for Teddy.
When Harry walked through the kitchen on his way to the bathroom, he saw a grin play on Andromeda's face.
What about hobbies? The last Harry could truly remember having free time was third year, and that was six years ago.
“Aw, well, I’m sorry. Maybe you should ask Kinglsey for a new one. Someone like…” Harry paused to look around the room. He grinned as he found someone. “Aronowitz. I bet he’d be a perfect partner for you.”
. She told him that they would wait a little longer to formally diagnose him with PTSD because wizard psychiatrists typically did not like to diagnose children—“Young adults,” Dr. Shelly would correct him—with mental disorders.
happened to the heater. Sometimes this meant that there wouldn’t be hot water for a few days if too many people had used hot water at one time. Draco didn’t think he’d ever be able to understand muggles. Sally told him that people had individual hot water heaters most of the time; she said she wasn’t sure why this building had all of them connected. She didn’t ask him why he didn’t know what a hot water heater was. She never asked him about his life before Moss Side; he never asked her about hers.
Harry had written Draco every day for nearly a month. They were definitely together, and Andromeda was definitely happy about it. She constantly asked about Draco and about their dates.
He watched as the children worked. Ms. Claire walked beside him and whispered, “I think they like you.”
“Okay. Yeah. That’s fine. G’night, Andy,” he responded. He hugged her and sat back down to eat his spaghetti.
thought, so when Bella said something…intense…I didn’t know how to disagree. When we were all at Hogwarts, we were all in Slytherin, and thus it was easier for us to fall into the myth of blood purity. I believed it for a long time, but then I met Ted. Ted was also a Slytherin and he was marvelous. He refused to put up with any crap. I had begun to question my family’s values before I met him, but he really changed everything.”
April 6th came, and Harry had yet again spent the night before stressing in his bed about Teddy and his future. Insomnia was no stranger to Harry, but he hated when it happened before an important event. At 5AM, Harry dragged himself out of bed and onto the porch for a cigarette. He smoked it quickly, still not used to the low temperature and gentle rainfall of early April. He didn’t mind the cold, but he hated smoking in the rain. He went back in for a warm shower and then dressed himself in his auror trainee uniform, basic wizarding attire topped with a trench coat and pure black robes.
"Yeah…but it doesn't matter." Upon viewing the two blondes' confused faces, Harry added, "I think that I want to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts…at Hogwarts."
“Well, what’s the big deal, anyway? Why don’t you want her to know how you are? Why won’t you talk to her?”
The rush was just dying down when Draco noticed a large group of people entering. He didn’t think anything of the group until he noticed Neville Longbottom heading towards the bar. Draco began to panic. He checked out the rest of the group and saw Potter, Granger, a few Weasleys, and Luna Lovegood. Draco crouched down behind the bar. He crawled out the door, earning a nervous and confused look from Xavier. Draco didn’t care. He couldn’t let them see him.
At 11 PM, Harry decided that he needed to sleep. He took 30mg of melatonin and lied down. As he drifted to sleep thirty minutes later, he could not believe how tired he was.
Harry and Ron finished their lunches just in time for their next lesson. Once everyone arrived in the classroom, Professor Thompson wrote their subject on the board in utter silence. All the trainees groaned loudly once they saw “Advanced Charm Theory” written in thick, white chalk.
He pondered the event for nearly half an hour before he joined Andromeda and Teddy in the living room.
of that—he sprinted to his apartment. He ran up the stairs so quickly that his footsteps made loud bangs. Gonzalo was out by his front door when Draco got to their floor. His disapproving scowl let Draco know that he was about to be yelled out.
Harry glanced around awkwardly and then finally said, “Er— well, I’m sorry. I’m sure that your parents weren’t deliberately trying to hurt you. I know they’re probably not the most...er...open-minded people, and they just...didn’t know how to react.”
.          The air immediately gave off a sharp, putrid smell. Malfoy and his clothes emitted a mixture of cheap vodka, beer, and cigarettes. He stumbled a bit as he walked to his seat.
He was cut off by a short Indian girl with half-shaved dark brown hair, skinny jeans, a blue hoodie, and purple socks, “¡Ay! Gonzalo, cállese. Nadie quiere escucharle. ¡Déjelo ahora, por favor!” The man, Gonzalo, groaned and threw up his arms before moving back inside the apartment next to Draco’s.
"I-I mean that you have staked your claim on me - you have claimed me. Just... just as you said you wanted to the other night- OH!" Draco chuckled in the crease of the Gryffindor's neck as Harry's voice broke off and his hips bucked up to Draco's and his answering hardness.
About an hour later, the adults come in and see them cuddling and Narcissa just can’t help herself – she takes a photo making Harry blush hard and Draco shout at her to get out. The men just chuckle and hold her to keep her back from the domestic scene. She thinks they’re adorable and says so. Draco just growls and pulls Harry beneath him, protecting him from his crazy mother. Harry giggles again making Draco melt again.
Clopsy popped back in to the living room and passed out the drinks. "Clopsy, could you please go and fetch Harry and Draco?" "Of course Mistress-"
Severus spoke up, "I can't wait to see their faces when we tell them." Tom smirked, "I have a feeling it will be a pensieve moment." The adults snickered before grabbing their own desserts and following the boys into the sitting room. They were blessed by the sight of Draco feeding Harry a forkful of treacle tart, blushing furiously and swaddled in blankets, cocooned together on the love seat by the fire.  Tom snorted quietly, and lowered his voice so the teens couldn't hear. "I bet this is why Draco asked to sit in here with dessert..." he trailed off looking very smug when Draco kissed the top of Harry's head affectionately, not even realising he did it. Harry blushed more. Draco had pulled Harry so Harry was snuggled in between Draco's legs, his back to Draco's chest, their plates lay forgotten on the coffee table next to them as they curled into each other, practically glowing with happiness and content.
"Draco. You are not a Death Eater. Not any more. People recognise that! When was the last time you were shunned or hexed in public? When was the last time you were spat on just for existing? And just now doesnt count." Harry reminded.
Harry goes to pour them orange juice but when he walked round to Vernon, Dudley, stuck his leg out causing Harry to trip and spill the orange juice all over his Uncle. Vernon is furious. He tells his wife and son to leave, ‘Go take him to get new clothes dear, treat him for being such a good son.’ Once they left, Vernon removes his belt. ‘Lie down, on the floor freak.’ Harry lies in the spilt orange juice and removes his shirt. This has happened enough times that he knows what to do. Suddenly, a slash of the belt hits him on his back making him jerk. Another happens just on his spine causing him to cry out. ‘Like that Freak? You deserve this. If I had just left you in an orphanage this would have never happened.’ Slashes of the belt caused Harry to cry out this time. ‘Shut up Boy, or this will get worse.’ Vernon growls. But Harry can’t help it, the next hit makes Harry scream and Vernon decides to punish the boy more. Fetching a knife from the counter, he starts slicing all over Harry’s body, marking it, scarring it. He laughs manically, enjoying watching his nephew squirm and writhe under him. He holds Harry still, and starts to carve words into Harry’s skin. FREAK, MURDERER and WORTHLESS are the words that Harry will now carry around him forever. The obese Whale relish’s the small boys screams. Vernon starts on another word, WHORE, but he doesn’t get to finish it as Harry has had enough. With some accidental magic, he blasts Vernon backwards before chanting, ‘Take me where I will be safe’. The last thing he sees is Vernon fuming, red as blood and spitting obscenities when it all goes black.
"Har! Get your lazy arse out of bed!" Hermiones voice sliced through my lovely dream about blonde hair and mercury coloured eyes. "Ugh, mione!" I whined. "I was in a nice dream as well." Hermione smirked at me. "Who about? Draco?" She asked with a raised eyebrow, a teasing tone to her words. I blushed furiously. "No!" She giggled, "Sure Har, sure."
The Hall is unnaturally quiet but I pay no notice to it as I stare at my soup morosely. I just want my lover.
Harry shuffled into Draco's side more, wiggling to get comfortable. "From 3 I was doing chores. I was always fed the scraps. I didnt have a decent meal unless they were forced to take me out with them into public. It would look suspicious if I didnt I anything to eat whilst they did. Hogwarts saved me from almost dying of starvation, however, I never managed to get seconds or anything particularly filling. It was Dumbledores way of controlling me. By controlling what I ate, he controlled my body and so my mind. I have always been aware of my weight. I hated it. I always felt like I was too fat, that would be the Dursley's speaking."
He acknowledges us with a tilt of his head and the Malfoy smirk on his lips. “Hello Potter. Weaselette.”
"Well! Let's go save the Saviour of the Wizarding World!!" Narcissa yelled before apparating to Little Whinging. The others followed with Draco side apparating with his father. Four sharp cracks could be heard in the quiet hamlet.
"Not my son you son of a bitch" Narcissa growled and sent a Crucio his way. Vernon fell to the ground writhing in pain as Lucius started sending Stinging Hex after Stinging Hex at him. Whilst his parents were destroying Vernon, Draco tried to stop the bleeding coming from his nose. He tried to make his way to Harry but his broken nose was painful and he feeling very lightheaded.
My cousin Dudley, is an obese kid who likes to use me as a punching bag. He gets fatter everyday so he has lots of clothes left lying around because his parents buy him new ones. I get the hand me downs. Most of the time, they are too large and fall and sometimes they have stains on – what they are I do not know and do not ever wish to find out. For the first 10 years of my life, I didn't have a bedroom. I lived in the cupboard under the stairs – I kid you not. It was always dark and cold. There were spiders and the occasional cockroach. Being a lonely young boy, naturally I made friends with them. I haven't ever had friends when I was younger, so when I came to Hogwarts and Draco insulted Weasley I decided I didn't want to get to know him. I regret that now but I do not know how to bring it up with him. Do you have any suggestions? I just wish to mend bridges I should've crossed years ago.
It was beautiful. There were separate strands of lights in the ball, which were green and grey. At the centre, you could see Draco and Harry but they weren't alone. There was an angry sphere of red too and it was pulsing. It was coming from Harry but the light was attacking it. Small bits of red came from Draco too but not much. The green and grey strands from the circle started to wrap around the red ball of light, making a shell. They then started to squeeze causing the boys to gasp in pain but the red ball was disintegrating. This went on for about 2 minutes before Harry screamed in pure pain and the ball exploded outwards.
I swallow loudly. My gulp sounded loud in the pupil filled yet silent corridor as he nuzzled his nose under my ear. I am sure my whole body is boiling hot, bright red and my heart is running laps around the Quidditch pitch. "What do you say? You wanna make bracelets? Something more than just-friendship bracelets?" DAMN HE KEEPS WHISPERING! I'M HAVING A MENTAL BREAKDOWN.
Harry and Draco stepped inside the room giggling. They were holding hands and as there were no more empty seats, they sat on the floor by the roaring fire, cuddling as a sign of affection. "This fire is a bit hot Har," Draco said to Harry. Harry snorted and moved his body so he shielded his boyfriend from most of the heat. Draco practically melted and Severus cooed in delight. A sudden flash made everyone blink in astonishment and the small house elf squeaked in mortification. "Clopsy forgot to turn the flash off... Clopsy is very sorry... It won't happen again! But everyone was just so happy and-and I couldn't help myself because everyone was so cute and-and I-I am sorry but I wanted the gift to be-be a surprise but it won't be any-"
Tuesdays. Not so bad as mondays but still bad. At least I didn't fall out of bed this morning again. That's always a bonus.
Draco growled and pulled Harry closer to himself. The older man smiled fakely at him before running his eyes down Harry appreciatively once more.
To say the least Draco was confused about the last part. Who had captured Harry's attention? Or was he just saying it for effect? When he brought it up with Harry all he got was a blinding grin before he chugged the last of his cold coffee and left the cafe to go home. This did nothing to calm Draco's panicking brain.
Harry nodded and strode off towards him before stopping and grabbing a dozen flowers of 2 different plants. "Do you want them to live a little longer? Look fresher for longer too?" Harry asked conversationally as Draco dried himself off with a charm. "Yes to both please." Draco replied, looking drier than he came in but more fuzzled than usual.
Everyone then left her alone. She looked quite shocked really. I winked at her before I left making her blush deliciously. I cant wait till the weekend.
"Right, I pulled out a black skirt, black tights, your favourite DM's - the rose ones and your favourite tshirt and jumper which are both covered on roses. What is it with you and roses? Especially red ones?" She asked.
Draco tilted his head to the side to deepen the kiss and relished the moan that escaped Harry's lips when he plunged his tongue inside the Gryffindors mouth. He was so focused on mapping Harry's mouth with his tongue and getting more noises like that from Harry he didn't notice when he had started to grind against the raven haired boy. When Harry tore his mouth from Draco's, panting and looking thoroughly debauched, Draco finally realised where they were and what they were doing.
Draco put Harry back down onto the floor carefully and looked him in the eye. When he spoke his voice was much lower than before making Harry shiver.
I scrambled to get dressed in a cute outfit. I emptied my wardrobe and stood at the end of my bed in despair. What am I going to wear?
As this was outside the Great Hall, a crowd had started to gather, students joining one by one. They were all holding their breaths, wondering what was about to happen next. What did happen next surprised them immensely.
Neville bared his teeth at Draco. “He isn’t yours Malfoy. He is mine. I saw him first! So I own him!” Draco growled loudly, “no he isn’t longbottom. For two reasons: 1, he has chosen me as you can tell by the fact that he hasn’t moved and he specifically told me not to let go. And 2, you’re scaring him which suggests you’re a poor match for him anyway.”
I took in the black, polished pointy shoes, the smart, pristine trousers and the required school shirt. I admired the way the trousers wrapped themselves around the males (for it must be a male by the way they dress) muscular legs and then I took in the school robe. Slytherin. Well, that explains the growls. I tilted my head up further to meet his eyes. Stormy grey, like a swirling pool of silver. My breath caught. Oh my. He was gorgeous and I must have made a noise because his eyes glittered slightly with amusement.
Harry frowned. "But how does kissing me deal with him?" Remus sighed and rolled his eyes. "Well cub, Draco was staking his claim on you so the owner would know your off limits. It was quite a smart idea to be honest." Draco beamed at the compliment from his old Professor.
"Hmm... I suppose I have, haven't I? I have claimed your lips-" A chaste kiss was placed on Harry's lips. "I have claimed your throat-" A small nip on the largest bruise blooming on Harry's neck. "And..." Draco whispered. "And I want to claim the rest of you too."
He walked up to his dorm, dropped his back and books but pulled out a book to read. Draco plopped onto his bed, and read a chapter. It had been 15 minutes so he decided to go downstairs and go for his daily walk. He donned his coat, hat, scarf and gloves as it was cold and briskly walked down to the War memorial. There it was. The dog. Lying down, head on its front paws. It cracked an eye open and took in Draco's amused smile.
Ten minutes later, both boys were dressed in simple but beautiful robes that oozed authority and money. Harry's were slightly too big as they were Draco's but he didn't mind. Draco thought it was adorable and sexy as fuck that his soulmate is borrowing his clothes.
Harry sighed. "I don't actually know- hang on I have an idea...." he said grinning madly. Malfoy, who couldn't see his grin, was still running with his prize over his shoulder, and did not expect what came next.
Harry lifted his head up and looks the enraged red head straight in the eyes. “Well, yes. That was exactly what I was doing.” He said with a sneer gracing his heart shaped face.
Harry whimpered. "Will you let me? Let me claim you all?" "YES PLEASE DRACO CLAIM ME!" "Pretty boy begging aren't you. And you're so polite. Alright then." And with that Draco threw a locking charm at the door, raised a muffliato and got to work.
woozy. Maybe I'm hallucinating? That explains why Harry is shouting Potter at Malfoy and Malfoy shouting his own surname at Harry. Weirdos.
I managed to buy all the present I wanted to buy for Harry. There are seven presents. One for each day starting from Monday and two to give to her when I ask her out. Hopefully she says yes.
After stuffing themselves full of waffles, everyone thanked the house elves before rushing to the floo. They each called out 'Diagon Alley', threw a pinch of floo powder and disappeared through the green flames, reappearing out the other side in the Leaky Cauldron.
"Enough bitch." Draco interrupted, furious with the girls audacity to actually apologise. "You broke his heart, and left someone to pick up the pieces. He was lucky I was around otherwise I suspect someone else may have done the same as you: fix him partially and then shatter him further. I am fixing Harry's heart, and I wont leave, even when it has finished healing. I will be there forever. I swear." Draco hissed the last words at the ginger haired girl.
Harry nodded. "Yes, we are clothes shopping for me. We were about to walk in but Draco kissed me and... then..." The raven haired blushed furiously as he remembered exactly what just happened. Sirius snorted and Draco just smirked. "The owner of this shop is a flirtatious prat who takes a shot at anything that moves. I swear I saw him flirting with an owl once. That was amusing."
The blond had been back at Hogwarts for 2 months before someone saw his room. Usually he would defend it like a dragon with a lair, but this time he was asleep and didn't notice someone entering his room. Now, you would think, was he stupid enough to forget charms to keep away attackers? The thing is, he didn't. Minerva had convinced him, reassured him that no one with ill intent could enter his room as she had placed wards on his room herself. And those words held firm until this night. But who were they, and why did they wait 2 months until they could get Draco?
A beautiful hair accessory sat inside, glinting in the morning sunlight. "Oh Harry." Hermione breathed. "Its beautiful." I nodded mutely. I couldn't say anything I was too shocked.
"Sirius! Remus! I missed you so much!" Draco watched as Harry untangled himself from him and flung himself at the two men with a flame of jealousy flickering inside his tummy. Sirius laughed heartily at his godson and beamed brightly.
"Oh shut up Draco."  Harry laughed as Draco started walking away from their friends with his treasure hanging from his shoulder.
"10 points to Matter! No, Palfoy! No no no that's not it. DRARRY! 10 POINTS TO THE MALFOY POTTER COUPLE!!" Yeah, Snape was definitely wasted.
Draco and Harry bloody Potter were in a compromising position against the wall of the broom closet. Severus smiled, Draco was so top in their relationship. If you couldn't tell, he was inside Potter so it was kinda obvious.
“HARRY! Where were you last night? You did not come back to the dorm; I stayed up all night and you did not fucking come back! What the hell mate?” Ron was furious.
Lucius left the room giggling whilst the two boys tackled each other and started tickling the other. He loitered around for a bit, enjoying the sound of happiness but left pretty quickly when he heard moans. Lucius loves his son and future son in law (?) but he does not want to hear that.
Draco giggled slightly with a wide smile on his face. "You can pick the name today." he said, sobering up pretty quickly.
“Yes you do. Here let me tell you what to do correctly. There are 4 steps, okay?” she nods her head, intrigued. “First, you offer friendship, nicely. Once that step is complete, you make sure he has your attention on him at all times. Pester him till you do – you’re doing that step already but you are doing it incorrectly. It needs to be subtle – NO TOUCHING.” He smirks at me before looking back towards Ginny.
I choked on, but I choked on something. Once I had stopped dying in the middle of a Hogwarts hallway, surrounded by unhelpful students, I looked at my best friend with betrayal all over my face. "You- you
I will fall asleep in a second in the middle of the corridor. He had removed his hand from my neck at one point and was rubbing the small of my back comfortingly. I relaxed into him gradually and his arms shuffled me around so he was comfortably holding me.
the attention seeker. She also wore a tight fitting grey t-shirt that showed off her curves. I was not interested in those. They are too...
"SILENCE!" Harry roared. They quietened down almost immediately. He fixed them with a cold glare before speaking in an equally cold voice. "It is none of your business what is going on. You just carry on insulting the Slytherins like normal and you won't have to deal with the change. Merlin knows you Gryffindors are too incompetent to understand simple things so all I am going to say is leave me the fuck alone and we will not have any problems. Do not bother me, do not question me and no one will be hurt. Is that clear?"
"Mine says Draco Malfoy - Gay as fuck – Anti Social as fuck." Harry chuckled deep in his chest; the rumbles moving to Draco's chest filled him with a warmth he had not felt since the end of 5th year. "Cute." Was all Harry said before turning around in Draco's arms. Their faces were right up close and they could feel the others breath ghosting over their lips. Harry unconsciously licked his lips, Draco's eyes tracking the movement as the pink muscle disappeared back into Harry's mouth.
I smiled at her before holding out the boxes. I have no words. I can't speak. I am shocked. She did like me!
"Okay, Tom. Please. He helped me. Please don't punish him or anything. He was doing what any decent person would do!" Tom didn't say anything, acting as if he hadn't heard Harry. Fenrir swallowed in fear, back stiff with anticipation.
Hermione gushed over it for six minutes straight before putting it in my hair. She agreed with my courtier, it suits my hair very well.
“Ah-hah yes I do.” I rub hand on back of head nervously. “Have since I first saw you in Madame Malkins.”
"He reminded me of you and your husband. Broken, helpless and in need of hope. He has been through a similar past to you two, and if the need would arise, I would have left you to follow him." Fenrir flinched at the fire in Tom's and Severus' eyes at the mention if their past. Severus' eyes softened.
Fenrir smiled at Harry before looking back towards his Lord. He set Harry down who scampered back to his soulmate and let Draco use him as a pillow. The werewolf smiled at the sight, happy to see Harry finally happy, content and safe. Turning back to face Tom, he was most with a steely glare making him flinch. Harry saw this and cut in fearing for his friends life.
He was under the tree for hours before a wet nose prodded his face, breaking him out of his trance. He turned to the dog and gave it a small smile before turning back to the lake. He had only just realised he was shaking, freezing cold when a warm body engulfed his. It was like a furnace and obviously human.
She skipped over happily but she looked really nervous. When she saw me her face lit up. Pansy and Blaise must have been right. She does like me?
Severus sighed dreamily, imagining Minerva's face as she handed the money over. He slammed the door shut with a "Have fun boys!" as he pranced off, giggling as he went to tell Lucius.
Soon enough, Harry and the ferret were whispering, louder and louder their voices came. Soon it became unbearable.
This rejection led to harry being hated by someone he loved for 7 years. The taunts, the pain, hexes and curses. He never forgave himself for almost killing him in that bathroom the day Katie was cursed. He knew Draco was forced into all of this, so was he! He understood how Draco felt but all Harry did was push people away.
Draco winced remembering his time he spent under Hermione's fist in 3rd year. "Yeah, weasley, be glad she doesn't punch you. She knows how to punch for sure." He said looking at Hermione with respect. Beside him, Harry snorted in memory.

"Yes, he is. But I suspect it was a survival instinct." Draco said sadly. The adults immediately sobered up before listening to Tom finishing the letter.
Suddenly, Hermione pointed at me and then looked to Harry who gasped and giggled. She was smiling at me! Harry was looking at me! But, why was she giggling?
"And that is?" Draco's voice came from the closed door, confirming Harry's thoughts of it being a bathroom.
They were partners for this potion they were making, draught of dying pigs? Living pigs? Who knows, I dont care.
It was dinnertime in the Great Hall, my 5th year and I was sitting at Gryffindor table with Hermione, Ron, Neville and Ginny. I had literally just came into my “second puberty” – where I find out my other “gender”. There are three types – Alpha, Beta and Omega. Most people are Betas but there are quite a few Alphas too. No one, absolutely no one, becomes an Omega. They are extinct. Also, very, very, very powerful. You can get some very powerful Alphas, but they cannot match an Omega’s power. These types of Alpha are incredibly rare and it is thought that they were meant to be potential mates to the now non – existent Omegas.
Draco had Harry pinned to the sofa and relished in the moans he tore from the boy as he assaulted his ravens neck. Biting, sucking and kissing resulted in leaving enormous hickeys adorning Draco's soulmates throat as staked his claim.
Harry pouted, "I was!!! I got up to find the bathroom, couldn't find a light, remembered I had a wand and then cast lumos to see where I was going and you were all THERE!!! I literally was almost pissing myself!!!" Draco laughed harder if that was even possible. Even Lucius and Severus had to clamp their mouths shut to stop their chuckles escaping. Narcissa didn't bother, she was grinning widely at Harry's discomfort and her son's giggle fit. Tom just sat there, looking slightly amused by it all.
‘Harry! Harry, love wake up! Please wake up!’ Draco shakes him awake. Harry wakes with a scream, eyes wild, breathing erratic hair messed into strange angles. He sobs, his tiny, scrawny body shakes with how big they are.
Unknown_Persons ~ thanks for the request! I hope you like it. :) - THIS WAS A REQUEST ON WATTPAD. You can request if you wish, just find me on wattpad? *shrugs*
A/N... um... so... it may get a bit hot where you are... PLEASE DON'T JUDGE ME. FIRST TIME WRITING SMUTTY TYPE SHIT.
Smiling once more, Narcissa reminded the boys to get dressed as soon as possible and come down for some waffles.
"Yes, I know love. But what if I stub my toe or I get a paper cut?" Harry interrupted Draco's rant about how and why Harry will never get hurt again. Draco shrugged his shoulders, jolting Harry from where he was settled. Severus chuckled lightly, "If you ever get hurt again, it can only healed by your soulmates touch or a direct relatives touch. For example, if Draco is unavailable for any reason, Lucius or Narcissa could heal Harry in his place. But Draco, can unfortunately only be healed by Harry and Harry only as we killed his last relatives yesterday."
Narcissa cooed whilst looking at them all sappy-like, basically melting at the cute moment. "They are so head over heels for each other and they don't even realise it. I bet when we tell them they will be even closer and even cuter. I don't think I could stand it!" She squealed the last bit quite loudly gaining the teens attentions. Harry's blush which had started to fade came back full force and started to fidget but Draco pulled him close and kissed him on the head again making Harry blush even darker and Draco finally realised what he did. He made a sort of strangled noise and flushed even darker than Harry, making the adults laugh at him.
“Now love,” my heart swelled at the endearment. “You need to get your magic under control. As much as I love holding you and I’m glad you’re here, we must talk to adults about this.” “But won’t someone try taking advantage of me?” I asked timidly. Draco huffed a laugh.
"W-would they symbolise something? Represent ah- a um r-relationship?" I asked timidly. Merlin I can
It was November when someone else joined him on his walk. It was a black dog, one that resembled Sirius Black. He didn't know who it was, it was obviously an animagus though.
"Well, we could play games? Or tag? Or play a one on one seeker match? Or..." He leaned towards my ear and as his breath fanned across my cheek, I froze. Suddenly, I'm no longer tired. It's like a switch flicked inside me although I am pretty sure my cheeks are flaming red. This was new territory! I don't know how to act! His lips are so gorgeous and they're right by my ear and I don't know what to think!
To say the least  Draco was surprised. "Sure." He replied. "But only if I get to do one thing." He said warningly. Harry nodded enthusiastically.
"I honestly do not know Draco. Can you bring me the letter? Thank you." He said, as the letter was passed to him. "I know this is a weird observation to make, but his handwriting is so much neater than normal. I wonder why." He mused the last bit to himself.
When Severus finally stopped twirling around madly, he grinned at the blushing boys making Draco hold Harry possessively close to him, as if to protect him from their mad teacher. Severus giggled.
." He winked cheekily at the two teenagers. Draco chuckled before replying. "Not yet dear cousin, but I hope soon." Harry looked up face flaming at his mate and opened his mouth to speak when Remus interrupted. "You two have the same scent. What is going on?"
I laughed. "Mione, the floor was covered in rose petals! I literally just finished clearing them up. I hope you don't mind, I borrowed one of your spare bags." Her eyes lit up. "Oh no, Har that's okay!"
Thank you, for taking the time to read this letter. Like I said at the beginning, you don't have to reply or fulfil my wishes.
At the end of sixth year, they proposed. I said yes and we were married before the end of the summer holidays by their mother, before I had to leave my Everything to destroy the Horcruxes.
We grabbed our bags and our money from the dorms and headed outside to go wait for the teacher to take us down to Hogsmeade. I saw Harry, Hermione and Ron in the corner of the courtyard whispering and giggling to each other as flakes of snow decorated their hair and hats. Hands covered their mouths as they leant towards another's ear and spoke words I was unable to hear from here.
When the heat of the charm settled on me I saw a person in the distance walking my way. It was Harry!
I nod and burrow my face into his neck. He laughs and my cheeks heat slightly as I feel the vibrations of his chuckle emanate from his chest.
Draco Malfoy, Slytherin Prince was holding Harry Potter, the Golden Boy over his shoulder as he ran past the Great Hall with Harry complaining.
"I offered to stay with Harry while he discovered the truths about this world and he accepted. Turns out, I was needed. I had to explain many things that the goblins had because Harry was confused by their wording." Fenrir looked back towards his Lord. "I'm sorry my Lord, for disobeying your order, but I had to help him. No child, magical or muggle should have to go through what he has been through. I hope you understand. If you dont, I will leave if you so wish..." Fenrir trailed off sadly, head hung down in shame. Harry looked on in surprise and glanced at Tom, pleading with his eyes to let him be.
I groan, she is so clingy!! I look around to see if I can find someone to get me away from the ginger whore. Something bright and shiny caught my eye. Fuck! Malfoy is coming over!
." Draco huffed a laugh, "I think it worked love." He said, carding his fingers through Harry's hair. Harry hummed, content with his life now. He could vaguely hear sniffles from the adults but a sharp voice cut through them.
The goblin took his time fetching the required paperwork and by the time he came back to the redheads, Molly was shaking with rage. Her face was turning a colour just as red as her hair. When the Goblin asked for identification, she almost lost it,
"Dunno. Haven't opened it yet." I shrugged and then grabbed my school uniform to get changed. When I got back from the bathroom, he6rmione was already changed and poking and prodding the box with her wand. "Anything gonna attack me mione?"
I gaped at him. Harry. James. Potter. Saviour of the Wizarding world. Saint Potter. The Chosen One. Boy Who Lived (to be a pain in my ass).
Narcissa snickered, "Yeah Dragon, eat up!" "Mum!" Draco whined, lifting his head up off the table to scowl at her. She just grinned; smug bitch, he thought.
The bed he slept in was situated underneath the window, meaning he could have a lovely breeze wash over him as he slept. His bedding was a plain white linen but it had dragon outlines that trailed across the cloth. They moved and breathed fire and the flames they produced acted as heating charms for when he got too cold. Draco often found himself talking to them about his day and a voice in the back of his head would always tell him 'Malfoy's don't talk to their bedding' but he didn't give two flying fucks. He wasn't a Malfoy for all he cared.
Harry laughs making Draco grin at him before cuddling him even closer (if that was even possible). Their faces were really close, noses brushing and both had smiles on their faces. They were just happy with to be in each other’s arms surrounded by love, calm and peace. Harry closes his eyes and burrows his face into Draco’s neck making Draco squirm as his neck was really sensitive. He kisses the top of Harry’s hair and they slowly falls asleep content.
The bell on the door tinkled as a customer stepped through. It was Draco's mother. The boys groaned and slumped onto the table and slowly sat up to compose themselves. Narcissa had a smirk on her face as she saw the swollen mouths and fast rising chests and rounded onto the shop owner. "Does that suggest neither boy are interested into you?" The man nodded, ashamed. "My son and his boyfriend are
"Can we go to the sitting room to eat and chat there? Please?" Draco asked politely, begging his parents. He just wanted to have an excuse to cuddle Harry and where would be a better place than the love seat next to the fire? Narcissa sighed and nodded. "Of course, just don't spill anything okay?" she asked sternly. The teens grinned at her before running off with their sugary treats to claim their seats.
Harry was having a bad morning. It all started when he had to get out of his lovers embrace to go to school. It got worse from then on. When he went to the owlery to send a letter off to Padfoot and Moony, the owl he tried to use bit him and another used him as a toilet. With Ron being an arse, he wasn’t going to deal with his shit. “I didn’t ask you to wait up for me, did I?” Harry responds sassily.
Harry turned around and looked at me. Malfoy looked scared. Strange. "Oh we are just arguing about who gets who's surname when we get married." Harry said and turned back towards Malfoy. "Anyways, we keep
Once harry saw him standing there with about 2 metres of space around him, singling him out, he burst into tears at seeing the broken boy. He lunged forward and wrapped him up in a hug, ignoring the flinch from the older boy. He sobbed into his hair pressing him close to his body whilst Draco snuggled into his neck and wrapped his arms around his chest. Draco sighed into Harry's collarbone and let a few of his own tears go.
He got up and walked to the door, face burning as people mocked his shriek. He grit his teeth and ignored them best as he could. He had completed all his work for the day so he decided to go sit down under a tree by the lake. It was cold without his cloak so he cast some warming charms.
“Oh harry darling, I doubt they even could if they tried. You’re so powerful baby.” He whispered the last bit in my ear with a smirk covering his beautiful face.
The two boys stood there, sweating and panting, faces flushed red as they watched their normally stoic and serious potions professor jump around squealing like a schoolgirl who was just asked out by her crush.
"I'll get it Sev," Draco said, already up and walking to the window. When he got to the window, he gasped. "Hey, Sev?" Severus hummed in response. Draco hesitated, looking back with confusion all over his face. "Why is Potter writing to you?"
"Mipsy!" Severus called. A small pop sounded and a house elf appeared at his side to serve. "Master Severus? What would you like?" she asked in her high-pitched squeaky voice. "Can you bring us some scotch and glasses please Mipsy?" Severus replied smiling faintly at the elf. Mipsy nodded, her ears bobbing up and down as she did so. "Of course Master Severus! Anything for Master Severus!" She popped away instantly and a few moments later returned with the alcohol and glasses. "Can I do anything else for Masters?" she asked. "No Mipsy, that's all thank you." Tom replied.
"Now," Narcissa smiled sickly sweet at Me Coalfield. "I want a whole wardrobe in Harry's size. Draco here, will help Harry with colours, sizes and designs. You, Mr Coalfield, will run around like the chubby hamster you are and follow
.          “Sounds good,” she replied. She looked genuinely happy. “If I were to see Draco over dinner or something, would you like to be there?” She looked at Harry expectantly.
As he walked past a small picnic area, he noticed a blond head of hair in a gazebo. He got closer and heard what he thought to be hyperventilation. Harry briefly argued with himself. Should he comfort Malfoy, or just walk on? It took roughly five seconds for Harry to decide.
He sent Xavier home so that he and Fab could clean the fryer. It was a more dangerous and complicated job, and Draco wasn’t about to confuse the bloke. Besides, he’d already made him clean up Potter’s puke. He drained the fryer in silence, waiting for Fab to put on her heat-protectant gloves. She came back to where he was sitting and kneeled down next to him.
They stopped at the holiday-special section and went over to the bracelets and rings. Draco’s eyes automatically fell on the sterling silver and emerald wristwatches.
“Well, I couldn’t help myself. Narcissa’s always loved owls, Drakypoo is a history buff, Arthur is interested in muggle communication, Molly likes puns, Hermione likes science, Fleur is getting her doctorate in economics, Bill likes-”
Harry sat and said, “You have to answer mine first.” He paused when Malfoy rolled his eyes, then he repeated, “You have to ans-”
“Bloody hell!” Ron yelled loudly. He had been scrubbing at his face for over thirty minutes, and he still could not take off the greenish-brown paint from his face. Their activity for the day was Concealment and Disguise. While many others decided to make themselves invisible through charms or potions, Harry and Ron stuck to a more natural approach.
“Yeah,” Malfoy said, suddenly very interested in his menu. He soon cleared his throat and asked, “Do you know what you’re going to order yet?”
He began to hyperventilate. “I’m going to die here I’m going to die here I’m going to die here I’m going to—”
Her grabbed her face, forced eye contact between them, and said, “I did not date him. I never dated him. He was never my boyfriend.
Malfoy sighed again and sat on the ground. After what seemed like forever, he finally spoke, “Potter, why do you care?”
Draco tidied up his room, placing the newly washed duvet on his mattress. He folded his blankets and placed them on top of the bed. He was quite proud of himself: after trying to get clean, he finally calculated all the money that he had spent towards drugs and booze. He wasn’t happy that he was spending over 80% of his paycheck on it, but he was happy that this now meant that he could actually furnish his apartment. The bed platform that he bought was simple, and it came from ASDA, but it still made a huge difference between “cocaine addict’s bedroom” and “finally getting shit together through décor.” He bought himself some new clothes, and he got his cats some toys and expensive food, too. Life seemed different. It almost seemed peaceful.
…” he said the name with contempt and wrinkled up his nose. “They frightened me, but in different ways. My father was a proud man and Azkaban broke him. He wanted power and he got Hell. Bellatrix reminded me of Lilith from old religious stories. She faithfully and chaotically followed the Devil and
.          He hadn't thought of Malfoy at all since the incident at the university. No, he hadn't thought of Malfoy one bit. He certainly hadn't thought of Malfoy's surprisingly tight pants: muggle skinny jeans that Harry did not think would suit the man. He hadn't thought of his black band t-shirt either, showing off an apparent liking for Green Day. He hadn't thought of his swollen chipmunk-like cheeks or his calloused knuckles or bloodshot eyes. He hadn't thought of the strands of hair falling out when Teddy finally let go.
This child was a werewolf, and even if he wasn’t, he was a half-blood. Draco felt offensive. After a damned war about blood politics, did he really just insult this child’s language ability in relation to his blood status? Draco felt so stupid. He attempted to clarify but only found himself stuttering, “I didn’t think that he…I mean, he’s not a…he’s not actually…” He bit down on his tongue, tasting blood. His mental gaze went to his wrist. His teeth let go of his tongue.
“Stop fucking throwing the rock, and you won’t have to do this every night.” She smiled and punched his arm in a playful way.
Harry held his breath. He hoped that Draco had somehow overlooked the front page this morning. H replied, “Professor, I mean Headmistress, McGonagall has got a new rule passed that says that sorting will take place on the first day for second years. Something about house unity…”
.          When class was dismissed, Malfoy got up as quickly as he usually did; however, this time he lost his balance and nearly fell over. Out of instinct, Harry extended his arms out. Malfoy swatted them away and glared at Harry. Harry rolled his eyes again and strode to his flat so that he could take the floo to Andromeda’s. He didn't watch as Malfoy left.
“Oh, I can’t. I’ve been a month sober.” Malfoy pulled an AA chip out of his wallet briefly, and then put it back.
Ginny slapped him playfully on the arm and said, “I got the acceptance letter two days ago. I legit cried—I couldn’t believe it!”
"I'm doing great, too, mate. Thanks for asking. Right now I'm working for the local owl post, but I've talked to George about helping out with the shop," Seamus added.
Harry smiled. However, he noticed that things were much more calm and less colorful than normal. He asked, “Where’s Teddy?”
makes me paranoid. Damn it!” he screamed. He grabbed his wallet and walked out the door. He didn’t even lock it when he left; he didn’t have any valuable shit, anyways. Draco groaned. He was going to get a hamburger and fries because the fat in them would kill the tweak. He thought through his process,
How could he let them down? How could he just let them die? Fred and Colin and Tonks and Remus and Moody and—
“Hmm,” she made a noise as if she didn’t believe him. “Okay. We have been working together for over a year. I believe that it is time for us to discuss you.”
He spent the next three hours showering and drinking coffee and smoking and cleaning his room and doing his Algebra and French homework. Around seven, he decided to sit outside and watch the sun rise. He loved the peaceful environment of dawn, especially after an all-nighter.
Out of shame, he resolved to keep his eyes on the professor and his syllabus. Anything but Potter. He thought about his back pocket and how, yet again, he’d failed to bring any of his apologetic letters with him. He’d have to remember those from now on.
?” Her smile grew into a grin. Sally and Fab were always trying to get Draco’s “secret dating life” out of him. They never believed that he hadn’t even kissed anyone.
Draco sighed. He had a meeting with his probation officer today at 1PM. He groaned as he poured himself a cup of coffee: he hated those meetings. He didn’t need to meet with someone twice a month just to talk about all the dumb mistakes he’d made in his life. He could easily remember those each time he looked at his left arm.
Once the shock wore off, Harry laughed. “Mate, it’s fine. You’ve gotta admit: it’s a pretty brilliant headline.”
Draco and Harry moved back inside a few minutes later. They sat in the living room and conversed with Andromeda and Narcissa for an hour before Draco excused himself for another smoke. Harry decided that it would be the perfect chance to corner him.
The kids were instructed to read silently, but were allowed to ask questions about word meanings or pronunciations. Harry soon discovered that the children didn’t raise their hands for him to help them, but rather for him to give them attention.
Draco laughed a little. He continued, “My father’s going to Azkaban and Voldemort moving Death Eaters into our home really changed everything. I grew depressed and terrified, but Mother always assured me that everything would benefit me. That all
On September 1st, Professor McGonagall announced that Hogwarts would be remodeled in the following year, but (unfortunately) the next year would hold 3 different sets of 1st years (those from last year, those currently, and those for next year). Thus, Harry was required to design speeches, partake in interviews, stage fancy dinners, and pose for photo-ops.
He pulled the sleeves of his hoodie down to wipe the remaining tears of his eyes. He cast a quick spell to take away the redness left from the panic attack. He got up quickly—maybe a bit too quickly, as he grew nauseous as soon as he stood—and opened the door. Halloween and Cauliflower ran to him. They had been waiting by the door, and now they stood by his feet—their eyes looking up at his expectantly. The cats wanted cuddles. How could a being possibly love Draco this much? After all he’d done, couldn’t they sense an evil in people?
“Just, please, tell me why,” Harry said. He took Draco’s hands to plead, but then dropped them as soon as he realized what he was doing.
“Hi, Draco. It’s nice to meet you,” Xavier said, extending his arm for a handshake. Draco blinked in surprise. He shook Xavier’s hand.
He nodded, and Fab went back into the kitchen. Draco spent the next few hours explaining the register, rush times, and basic bartender duties to Xavier.
[Hello. How is it going?]” Draco asked. Harry loved when Draco spoke in French because it was obviously his most natural language.
.          Maybe he'd thought of Malfoy a bit, but it was only because Andromeda brought it up at dinner.
Harry stood watch by the swings, ensuring that no kid swung too high. He was about five minutes into the lookout when Davie walked towards him. The young boy was frowning and was clearly in distress.
"I don't understand. Everybody wants me to be a good person and forgive them!" Harry's voice rose. He was angry, and he knew his face was turning red, but he was
have a bit of a problem with would be Constructing Archaic Greek History, but even that shouldn’t affect his GPA since he expected to be the top of his general SALC course—Standing on the Shoulders of Giants. It was just an introduction to philosophy, art, language, and history. He smirked to himself. Maybe he’d be good at something again.
What took Harry by surprise first was the size of the apartment. Unlike the vast area of the Malfoy Manor, this home was tiny. It could not have had more than three rooms: a living room/kitchen, a bedroom, and a bathroom/water closet. Next, Harry looked down to see two cats sniffing at his feet. They looked like opposites: one had thick, white fur and was missing an eye; the other had short, brown and orange fur, amber eyes, and only half a tail.
“Yeah, but she wants to stay in her residence or whatever. She says she wants the ‘university experience’ and that using magic to go back to the wizarding world when she should be at a Muggle uni isn’t very ‘uni-like.’”
“Yeah,” Harry replied. He faked a huge grin just for Charlie’s sake. “I’m doing great! And yourself?” He hated himself for lying to everyone all the time.
Class droned on and on as Professor Wilkins lectured on the newfound responsibility of adulthood and university-life, and how his class on contemporary British literature may as well be the most important course of English at all of the University of Manchester, or even the most important course of all time.
Nevertheless, that’s where he was now: at ASDA, purchasing Cadbury’s, Maltesers, and Kinder Eggs. It was there that he thought the same thing that he so often thought, “It’s easier to be in the muggle world.” He sighed because he knew that Dumbledore would not be very proud of him. Right now, he was thinking like a coward— not a Gryffindor. He sighed again because he wasn’t sure if it mattered anymore.
.          “Oh, well, yeah. He does. He’s very smart. Can you count to ten for Draco, Teddy?” Andromeda bounced Teddy in her arms. He shook his head and pouted. “Ugh,
In Psychology, he had a fifteen page research paper and thirty slide presentation on one metal illness. In English, he had a twenty page paper comparing and contrasting two works of British contemporary literature from the syllabus. In Criminal Justice, he had to design his own two-hundred question practice exam complete with three (answered) essay questions. In Algebra, he had to list every formula used in the classroom, as well as the meanings of the variables. In Earth Science, he had a ten page (fifteen source minimum) research paper. In World History, he had to write three five-page essays from a given list of options. And in French, he had to research current French culture and present in French. All were due the second week of December and Harry had not even started them.
“Forget it!” he screamed. “I wish Hermione were at least here to help. She wouldn’t be laughing at me.”
Dousselsnorf sighed and stood up from his chair. He grabbed the family portrait off of his book shelf. His entire family, including himself, was smiling and waving towards the camera. He set the picture down on his desk and faked a small smile.
.          “I have to go,” he claimed. “It’s was nice, um….it was nice. Have a nice trip.” He turned to Harry and nodded curtly. “Nice day, Potter.” He turned and walked away from them.
"Oh, yeah. I'm doing much better. The Ambien is really helping. I got eight hours of sleep last night!"
If for nothing else at the moment, I’m thankful for the ring, that is, if it really helps with your magic. The band certainly looks very handsome on your hand. If it was some atrocious, giant jewel, I cannot in good conscience promise that I would have kept you, darling. Tacky gemstones are quite the turn-off for me.
Well, the rest of the evening was easy as a charm, love. Wine, hors d’oeuvres, inconsequential small talk – I felt like being at one of the galas my parents used to host. I know that you were feeling impatient once we left the dinner table, but you were right about what you mused in your letter: staying for a polite period of time is proper etiquette. And not even you will make me break my beloved etiquette rules, Potter. I hope the time went by for you just as pleasantly and quickly as it did for me.
I meant what I said: I do love you – love every part of you – and when we bond our magic will be entwined too. The two of us shall never be parted, for a world without you is no world at all.
Theo huffed out a sigh when we sat down on his bed. And don’t you worry, my darling, this one is straight as a wand. “I wish I could go there,” he said, his brows furrowing. “I can hardly abide the idea that she’s not living her best life. Do you think she misses me?”
If you were to become an Auror, I’m not sure whether Dark wizards would confess their crimes to you, but they would certainly spill all their secret crushes and desires upon hearing your romantic cogitations.
Ron snorted. “You’ve got yourself an hour, Harry, and while you’re at it? Cast yourself a bloody Silencing Charm.”
You asked me if it scares me, and it does a bit, love. The last thing in the world I want is to hurt anyone by accident. It frightens me less now that I’ve learnt a couple of centring techniques that help me to be calm. I think about the things that I’m grateful for, and you are chief on the list. I think of your words, telling me that I’m enough, that I have a good heart. I think of you, telling me that I’m beautiful.
You’re utterly unbelievable, though. Talking about one’s financial doom and an extra Kit-Kat in one breath. I had one of those once. Sickeningly sweet. So, you definitely wouldn’t have to share with me.
Circe, I was in such high spirits earlier and now I’m completely useless and miserable. I hope I’m not ruining your day.
The Aurors in that tiny filthy interview room couldn’t understand my answers, Draco. They kept pressuring me, asking me to repeat myself, telling me to clarify what I meant.
Let me first rant about your thoughts on Harry Potter. I still have to make my point there, love, I’m sorry.
“You’re not going anywhere,” I repeated, holding the glass of water up to your lips and helping you to take a sip.
Even if we’re stuck together in the UK for the foreseeable future – and no, I won’t be travelling anywhere without you beside me. I love you! – we’re still going to have wonderful fun.
My thoughts always come back to the fact that she told you about her initial plans to retrieve the ring and offer it in exchange for you to break up with me. There was no need to tell you and she bloody well knew how you would take such information. After everything she’s said before – either Mother wants your trust, or she mentally just accepted you as family. I have no bloody clue, Harry.
Oh darling, you gave me the darkest of looks. “You don’t know Pansy, like I do,” you answered as we bustled out of the Hall.
Then your movements slowed, darling. They became more exploratory, and you snaked your wet hands over the curves of my bum. You were gentle, but I could feel the lust you felt in your grip. Then, you took me by the hip, and pressed your body against me firmly.
We shall see each other once more, but this time, and for the first time, we will see each other for who we are. You read me so well, my darling. I read your words and I find not only you, but parts of myself in them. Isn’t it curious?
Speaking of struggle. I think I went deaf and blind from all the cretinism I’m witnessing. Actually, I wish I had gone deaf and blind. Most of our beloved, fellow schoolmates are already dressing up. One of my fellow Housemates is in tears about an Hair Curling Charm gone wrong. Two blokes by the entrance are trying to score a last-minute-date, slowly but surely losing even the last droplet of their dignity. And earlier in the corridors, I saw a ridiculously large flock of tittering girls following Potter’s every step (I positively had to stifle a laughter when I saw his glare).
Have you seen the notice pinned to the board near the Great Hall? There’ll be a party for the combined eighth- and seventh-years. I watched a minute as Flitwick tried to unstick the addition – the part about a supply of potent Firewhisky and Love-Potion-infused Prosecco.
I’m sorry, darling, I’ve been talking so much about myself and hardly asked you anything. Please tell me about your day. Tell me something that made you smile. Tell me something outside of our diary that made you think of me.
So, the thing is – I’m not keen on this either, but I kind of see the point. Theoretically speaking. Shortcomings in implementation excluded.
Let me put it in a different way: ‘Mione is as likely to ask Ron or I about homework as she is to ask to fly in a rocket to the Moon. I have to confess, I have the tiniest bit of envy, Draco. If you’re receiving Hermione’s patented glare, it means that you’re doing something she disapproves of – and remember, most actions come under her umbrella - so, ergo: she likes you. Or tolerates you, at least. It adds up to rather the same thing.
He mumbled something again, so I raised my voice to reprimand him, good and proper. But Circe, Harry – you should have seen his face. His expression changed from sheer shock to disbelief to an exuberant beam. Kreacher bowed several times then, thanking me and telling me that, “Master Harry has forbidden Kreacher to punish himself. But Kreacher would! If Master Draco-“
Harry, we both know that I’ll start to lose hope somewhere along the wait for Mulvaney’s notice on further proceedings. I’ll say that it’s a waste of time and money to go through my probation again, and possibly I’ll even say that I don’t deserve anything better than I got for a sentence.
It has been many months since I was last described as a fainant, and the rude dragon that deigned it was a good idea to say it felt the sting of my wand. If such a creature might be in your company right now, then tell him that he is every bit as rude as he ever was.
My final idea – and I KNOW this isn’t what you've got in mind – was Hagrid’s shed, you know the one where he keeps the cut logs for the common room fireplaces. Bloody hell, but I wouldn’t take my prick out of my trousers in that dark, creepy place. There are spiders in there as big as dinner plates. Ugh. Just the thought of them, and their Acromantula cousins have me shivering.
Ron also said – though the git was laughing when he said it – that you have to be ritualistically bathed beforehand so that you’re symbolically clean to join with your betrothed’s family? And that you have to have flowers and feathers pinned on your clothes? Is that really true?
As for me, my darling, a few tendrils of ideas are starting to spread out within my mind too, and you’ll never guess where I got them from. Yes, of course: from reading our diary back to myself. You suggested the idea of Mind Healer, Draco and you know what? I think the idea might have legs. Think about it, love. Mind Healing has changed my life entirely this year, and if I could pay that back, help others… Well, that sounds like a decent use of the rest of my days. Perhaps McGonagall might let me volunteer with some of the students here at Hogwarts in the future? It’s definitely a possibility, isn’t it?
Twenty minutes. We’ve set ourselves a Tempus alarm. Twenty minutes and then we’re going to take up exactly where we left off.
But Salazar, I was so nervous. You can’t imagine how much pressure it is when all of your family has been Sorted in the same house ever since seventeen-hundred-something. As a young lad, I pictured the Prophet headlines about the first Malfoy who’s Sorted a Hufflepuff. Scandalous!
Oh love, I think my mind went a little hazy at that point, for all I remember are images and sensations. The taste and scent of your skin. The cautious pressure of your inspecting fingertips as they explored. The heat of your wandering lips and the heft of your prick as you frotted it with mine, soapy slick and bubbly. It was the stuff of sexy love charms, and Porno Pensieves, and, if I was quiet, it was only because I was trying so hard not to blow my load prematurely. Merlin, I do so love you. I’m impatient, randy and hard for you, all the time, and I adore every second of our sticky, sexy voyage of discovery.
A couple of letters ago we were chatting about Zacharias Smith, weren’t we, and you said that I’m not too keen on gossip? Well, usually I’m not, but just this once I’m going to partake.
Thank you, Harry. Thank you for all your reassuring words and for being awake with me. I love you so much.
I don’t know how many minutes I sat looking at your mother, because she coughed discreetly, and looked at me with her keen, direct gaze.
You asked about the customs in my family. Well, there usually used to be a little age gap between wizards and witches as far as I know. While wizards dwelled in their ‘study trips’ which I mentioned before, they came back to England, at the latest a year or so after their betrothed witch graduated from Hogwarts or Beauxbatons. While it was an open secret for wizards to, let’s say ‘experiment’ while on their travels, the witch was usually meant to wait for her beloved to return. It’s shocking just how acceptable these sexist traditions were not so long ago.
You took my hand, probably sensing that I was on the verge of very ridiculous tears. But I couldn’t quite forgive her, not yet, for the ghastly thoughts that had spooked around my head during the few days before and after Mother’s return.
I had a shrunken telescope in my satchel, but just looking upward with the bare eye was perfectly fine, love.
journos and all the supposed great and good of the wizarding world. Let me tell you, oh-so-lovely boyfriend of mine, your amused tone asking ‘whatever had I expected?’ didn’t help matters either, and neither did Hermione gesticulating at my uselessness or Ron guffawing at my predicament.
“No,” you answered. “Never. Not once. My probation… The rules of it. They forbade me from making contact… But I wouldn’t have anyway, I swear to Merlin.”
Just like I’ve repeated before, people will get used to the idea of Harry Malfoy-Potter (or Potter-Malfoy, or whatever we decide) because we aren’t going anywhere, are we? Yes, I know we were covering the front of the
There were watercolours that Ted had painted before he died, and flowers in vases. I felt every little bit of anxiety vanish from me, just like I always do in Andi’s home, and so I turned to you and took your hands in mine. “See,” I smiled. “Andi likes you. Now just compliment her ginger biscuits and you’ll be set.”
It seems that our two best-friends, Luna and Nev, think that this last week has been quite a trial. It really hasn’t, in all honesty, but if they’re willing to stump up for a plate of fish and chips and a couple of Butterbeers then darling, I’m not about to stop them.
Your lips were wet and warm as they met my own, and our tongues met in a gorgeous tussle. I’d wanted to kiss you the whole of the day, Draco love, and it felt as necessary as breathing. Our bodies slotted into each other, familiar and easy, and I knew I was home.
I’m trying to imagine how you are moving your hand right now, and maybe you move your hips as well. I’d want you to. Merlin, I’d love to see that. Don’t be shy about it. Fuck into your hand.
It’s good that it won’t be long until we have our house-elf-waited dinner. Don’t be late, Potter. The ten minutes you’re in the habit of being late to class – I won’t tolerate them.
I can’t wait for the day we meet. Let’s find a quiet booth at the Three Broomsticks, please. We have something entirely else compared to your usual Madam Puddifoot's clientele. Besides, the decoration is dreadful. Completely hideous.
First of all: a bonding ceremony with tea, cake, and public sex on the day of the Autumn Equinox is perfect.
There’s one more couple that we sometimes saw, who I forgot to tell you about this afternoon. Jack and Catherine Martin. They don’t live in Lyon, but in Southern France, originally from Britain. They made their money by inventing some sort of cosmetic product that smoothes wrinkles – so practically, they were selling potions to Muggles, injecting the stuff into their skin. It was charmed to wear off after a while so that the treatment had to be repeated. Father used to say that people like them are the reason why nobody can take these new money buffoons seriously and why we would under no circumstances ever get an estate at the Cap d’Antibes (that’s like a whole peninsula for Billionaires only. I have no idea whether those ridiculous show-offs or a lack of Galleons was the real reason we didn’t have property there). I remember that Jack hit on Mother after having a few glasses too many once or twice.
calls me Harry. When my godson starts to talk, he’ll call me Harry and even the Professors usually call me by my given name. Seeing it written, in those twisty letters that you write makes my heart hurt.
Circe, but I miss our big bed at Grimmauld, and those long lazy mornings where there wasn’t anywhere to go, and all that mattered were our limbs, entwined under the quilt, and the press of body upon body.
Also, I just reread parts of your letter today. And I do think that your letter to Andromeda sounds a bit like me. Not exactly like me, but your phrasing and choice of words certainly has that certain je ne sais quoi, don’t you think? I’m looking forward to the day that Weasley picks up some of Hermione’s vocabulary. Oh, or imagine Hermione ranting on Quidditch moves!
When you began to repeat my name, over and over like a mantra I knew you were close, and then you unravelled, spilling into my mouth. Fuck, but your face when you cum is like the most wonderous art, and the best part is it is mine alone to see. We have a secret knowledge about each other, Draco Malfoy.
And it’s been only me and my stubborn pride that have been in my way, Harry. In clear moments, like this one, I know that. But when my mind shifts to dreadful memories of the past and an anticipation of the worst ahead, I forget about all the well-thought-out resolutions I have made. I seriously have no idea how you put up with my moods. I’m sure that I must be very confusing at times. I show everything but the consistency that I value so much in you, Harry.
. The things that I want to share with ou I wouldn’t dare say aloud. Not without causing a good few blushes and poor old Flitwick’s head to likely explode. I wouldn’t want that! Hogwarts wouldn’t be Hogwarts without his diminutive, agreeable presence.
I suppose what I’m trying to say – in a very awkward, roundabout way – is that I do find you, the real Draco Malfoy, tremendously attractive. Remember the pair of us talking about poetry months ago? I reread that Richard Barnfield poem, just now, and I was surprised exactly how much the subject of the poem resembled you. Red lips against pale, flawless skin. That was such a stark, erotic image, wasn’t it, Draco? Even back then I had a type, and I didn’t even know it.
“You know exactly what I mean.” He couldn’t help but smile. Of course, he never hung out with them again. It was just too hard to hide his wizarding history from them, especially since Felicia was a self-proclaimed pagan witch. He’d watch as she pretended to brew potions and study astrology until it was too much, and he’d leave the room guffawing. Fab would always grow angry and call him mean and a “bully.” He already knew that.
“Cool,” Draco replied. He furrowed his eyebrows, opened his mouth, shook his head, and closed his mouth.
“For me, it’s the cloaks. They strangely resemble dementors a bit with those.” Malfoy didn’t reply, so Harry continued, “Try inhaling through your nose, counting to four, and exhaling through your mouth.”
He did know that he hated his parents. His mother had stopped sending him so many letters, and he hadn’t checked to see if she sent him anything for his birthday. She almost always got him some chocolate, a new broom, and a surprise gift. Now he doubted that she would even be able to afford the chocolate. Aren’t you supposed to love your parents? Family above all else, right? Maybe he shouldn’t hate his parents…?
The rest of the night flew by as Harry and his friends hopped from bar to bar. They had helped him move into his new apartment in Manchester a few days beforehand; nevertheless, they’d spent the week before university went in session assisting Harry in getting used to the new city.
.          They rushed out the door, eager to see most of the campus before the sun went down. Harry showed them the buildings nearest to his apartment first before making his way to the buildings with his classes in them. They were walking towards Samuel Alexander when Harry’s eyes found Malfoy heading out of the building. He glanced at Harry and seemed content on ignoring the man. He moved his eyes from Harry towards Andromeda and Teddy. He stopped dead in his tracks.
He was sat beside Neville, Seamus, and Dean, contemplating the afterlife. Suddenly, all of Professor Wilkins's lessons about "existential angst" made sense. He wondered if anyone would ever write a book about his own angst. If his life at Hogwarts would entertain some… Harry decided that he didn't care.
The night continued and Harry was more than glad to leave himself out of the conversation. Instead, he played with Teddy and eventually excused himself to put the infant to sleep and to do homework.
Harry spent the rest of the day switching among spending time with Teddy and Andromeda, doing homework, reading, and sleeping. He was almost anticipating the day’s end because he had developed a strong nervous energy.
Harry pushed himself on top of the blond and started tickling him. Five minutes later, the tears ran down both of the men’s faces from laughing so hard.
When she was close enough to the counter, she took a quick look back at her friend group, and then she leaned in towards Draco.
While they ate, Andromeda explained that she had written to her sister and was awaiting a reply. However, she was not expecting one: she and Narcissa had not spoken for nearly two decades.
Unfortunately, sleep was never a good friend to Harry. When he’d managed to achieve unconsciousness, nightmares darted his way. But instead of being crisp and clear Voldemort-related terrors, these were much worse. Harry’s world was muted and riddled by fog. He was back at the Dursleys, where he’d grown up, and they were trying to shove him into his cupboard—only he was too tall now and wouldn’t fit. And someone was screaming about how he smelled like cigarette smoke and how he burned lunch and then he was being smacked over the head with a wooden spoon and it was almost exactly like being a little kid again. Except it didn’t make any sense. Wait, oh God, unless he was back at the Dursleys, but that didn’t make any sense either beca-
Andromeda interrupted, “Mon amour, Harry a l'école maintenant. Il va à l’université pour apprendre. [My love, Harry has school now. He goes to the university in order to learn.]”
Harry gently sieved the flour into the large mixing bowl, combining it with the sugar, eggs, and butter. Teddy’s party was tomorrow, and Harry was put in charge of the food and dining. This was going to be a celebration for Teddy’s 2nd birthday. Andromeda and Harry threw a small party for his 1st, but feelings of grief and guilt had overshadowed the fun. Thus, Harry had promised himself that this birthday would be unforgettable—or at least as unforgettable for a two-year-old as possible; he had to make cakes and cookies and juice and two different dinners: some Kid Cuisine Twist and Twirl Spaghetti for Teddy (the only thing he would eat at this point) and some muggle sushi rolls for the adults.
The days passed and New Year’s Eve was upon them before they could comprehend it. It was 5 PM and Harry was awaiting Draco’s 6 PM arrival. He almost wished that the hour could be longer. He was in one of his best dress suits and had checked his appearance in the mirror over a hundred times in the past ten minutes. All the while, Andromeda grinned at him. He didn’t know if she knew or not, but at the moment, he was too worried with impressing Draco to care.
.          “A bad word that we do not use, Teddy,” Andromeda replied. She groaned at his hair. “Harry,” she addressed him, “What do you mean? Why would you say that?”
“Um,” Harry said. “I still have Andromeda and Ron and Hermione and everyone else…Do you want to do wizarding shopping or muggle shopping first?”
It was fifteen ‘til nine when Harry arrived at the Ministry. He sulked around the front entrance of the Auror Training Area for a few more minutes. He could not stress how much he hated Mondays. It was always class for three hours, lunch, class, a small break, and some sort of “practical” activity or exercise. The class line-up was almost always the same: ninety minutes of Dark Charm and Spell Disarmament and another ninety minutes of Stealth and Tracking. They would have lunch, and at 12:45, they would have forty-five minutes of an intense theory class. Usually it was Poison and Potions, but sometimes it was something more boring like Ancient Runes and Other Old Wizard Languages or Anti-Deadly Disease Wards. Harry disliked theory, but he considered it to be worth the end-of-day activity. He absolutely hated sitting still at a desk learning about the differences between the Polio Hex and the Spattergroit Spell. He needed to experience what he was learning to retain any information.
"Yeah…" Harry glanced up at the headmistress. She was smiling nervously. "What? Oh! Yeah. Yes. I accept." Harry smiled back.
Narcissa smiled, and Harry found himself to be surprised that he could refer to the Weasleys as “Ron’s family” and Narcissa Malfoy would still understand.
After they extracted their Galleons, Harry and Draco stopped by Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes. Harry briefly wondered what Fred would think of him hanging oiut with Draco Malfoy and if he’d be proud of Harry’s forgiveness. He put the thought aside.
A few days had passed, and it was now Monday, April 10th. Harry had woken up at 5:30AM to go to the gym at 6 like he did every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. The auror trainees usually spent Mondays doing written work and having class time. The lack of movement bored Harry, so he decided that he’d needed a regular gym routine. Coffee in hand, Harry strolled to the gym. He ran and lifted weights until it was time to shower and go to work.
When he finally got there, he felt overwhelmed. It was obvious this was a class that most of the first-years in the College of Arts, Languages, and Cultures took as a default. Despite there being nearly two hundred seats, almost all of them were full. Harry chose a seat closest to the door. When he sat down, oblivious to his immediate surroundings, Harry heard someone clear their throat. He looked to his left and found himself sitting next to Malfoy.
“Yes, of course,” Andromeda answered. She put Teddy’s second shoe on him and picked him up. “Shall we?”
“Longer than it’ll take me to eat it,” Ron replied. Harry rolled his eyes and scooted the bowl over to Ron. He watched as Ron took his first bite. He smirked as Ron immediately spat the bite out. “What the—? Spinach, mate? Who the bloody hell makes something with spinach and broccoli in it? Isn’t that, like, breaking thirty cooking rules?”
They spent two hours in the joke shop and then three more hours in Diagon Alley. It was about 9 PM when they departed for dinner.
After the first few months of interviews and speeches and photo-ops, Harry kept his head down low. He took care of Teddy, cooked, and learned some basic French from Andromeda. It wasn’t much, but it kept him sane until training began.
, [I don’t know,]” He cleared his throat and switched to English. “On one hand, I’ve spent my entire life studying the wizarding world and our related history, but on the other hand, I feel like muggle history just
Dousselsnorf continued, “Eventually, the Death Eaters must have discovered. One day we went to our respective homes only to find everyone dead inside. Since then, I moved to the Probational Office. Escobar decided to partake in auror training, and he was soon moved to the head position. It was at my request that his office be on this floor.” Dousselsnorf made eye contact with Draco. Draco didn’t break it.
Harry stopped fooling with his appearance and went out to the small foyer to greet Andromeda and Teddy.
After walking less than one kilometer, Draco found a place. He bought two six-packs of beer and a 1.75-liter bottle of Smirnoff. The cashier didn’t even ask him how his day was going; in fact, the man didn’t say anything except Draco’s total for the transaction. Draco found it glorious.
Harry’s first couple class sessions went rather well: he had read every assignment and written every essay required of him. It was now Monday, the 25
“Aww,” Harry faked a pout and began to rock his godson back and forth in his arms. This kid had to have a better life than Harry. He refused to let the same mistakes happen—neither domestic nor political.
“Oh, Harry, you shouldn’t have!” Andromeda exclaimed happily. She looked at the pink bag and said, “Really? I know that you didn’t go all the way to Manchester for Archie’s Burgers again!”
As they walked to the local café, Harry couldn’t help but wonder what his younger self would say if he told him that he’d had a lunch date, or rather an appointment, with Malfoy. Before they walked in the front door of the restaurant, Malfoy said, “Oh, shit.”
Sally and Fab sat beside Draco on the park bench. They tossed out bird seed to the pigeons and watched as the birds flocked towards the food. The three of them only started hanging out once Draco found out Sally and Fab were a couple. He understood why they’d been so secretive about it. It hurt him slightly that they didn’t consider him a “safe” person, but it also filled him with a sense of sick joy. He could still appear straight to other people. After all, everyone he’d told so far had been utterly shocked.
“That’s what you do when you ‘square’ a number. You multiply it by itself. What’s your name, sweetie?”
“What the fuck is a twink?” Draco asked. Sally and Fab burst out in laughter. “No, seriously,” he continued, “Is this some kind of gay culture thing I never know about?” The girls kept laughing, and Draco could see a few tears form in Fab’s eyes. He scowled.
was brought up, Harry noticed that Andromeda stuffed her mouth with food, Narcissa blushed profoundly, and Draco winced. It was 6:30 PM when Harry finally excused himself for a cigarette. He grabbed a cup of coffee and relocated to the back porch. He was halfway finished with his cigarette when the door opened again. Draco stepped out.
“Mr. Malfoy,” Dousselsnorf interrupted, “Do you even care what I say to you at this point? I’ve been talking about chess for the past ten minutes. Really, I don’t mind if you don’t care or pay attention. I get paid whether or not you land back in prison.”
Harry knew that Draco was still slightly frightened by cars, so he was pretty surprised when Draco agreed to let Harry drive.
Draco knew that he shouldn’t have done it. He really knew that. But how could he not? After all he’d been through that day, why shouldn’t he write his own mother back?
Andromeda came back to the table after her smoke break. It was her turn to watch Teddy and Harry and Draco’s turn to smoke. The two men walked outdoors and stood by the wall on the side of the building. It was pretty late, so they were the only ones out there.
"Um…" Harry twiddled his thumbs. "I don't know. I have a slight headache… Oh! And I am so bloody thirsty. I'm just so insanely thirsty." Harry shook his head. It'd been a week since he started taking the medicine, and his dry mouth was still horrid.
It was now the twelfth of October and they had arranged weekly dinners. Harry was surprised because Draco and his mother had restored their relationship to such a point as to where he had allocated some time in order to pay Narcissa a visit at her home in France.
He was currently at the Hogwarts Memorial Graveyard, along with almost every other person that had survived the war. Draco claimed that he had to work, but Harry knew that he was really just scared of seeing ghosts. And he was okay with that: one didn't need to be brave all the time.
Andromeda maintained her frown. She looked like she didn’t believe Harry at all, and that was fair. Harry was a shite liar when it came to her. Nevertheless, she replied, “All right. Well, don’t overwork yourself. You can only do so many all-nighters before your work suffers. I have you some food prepared in the fridge.”
Breakfast went by quickly. Andromeda tried to sound excited about Harry's plans for that day, but she really just sounded a bit confused. After his therapy appointment, Harry was going to go to another university tour. The month of July had been filled with tours, and he had already visited the University of London, the University of Westminster, Middlesex University, and the University of Manchester. Today, at two, Harry was going to visit the University of Manchester again.
They burned through the menus and the appetizers pretty quickly, and were left with time to talk before the entrées arrived.
Five minutes later, Narcissa arrived. She was dressed in an elegant, green silk dress and was immediately welcomed in by her sister. At 4:15, Harry was starting to doubt that Draco would show up. Andromeda saw the concern on his face and offered him a reassuring smile.
.          Harry waited until Malfoy had made himself completely comfortable in his respective seat before he leaned in, his hair nearly touching Malfoy’s pointy face.
He smiled at her like nothing had happened. God, he was tired of pretending like nothing had happened. Why couldn't—
Harry’s week just before classes began was dedicated to familiarizing himself with his apartment, Manchester, and the university. Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Luna, Dean, Seamus, and Neville helped Harry move some of his belongings to his newly remodeled flat, a modest one-bedroom near Victoria Park. They’d spent a few days doing some light partying, strangely joined by Hermione, and visiting some tourist attractions.
Harry got an excellent night’s sleep: a total of six and a half hours. It was 9 AM, and he and Andromeda were tidying the house. For the most part, the house was not ransacked, so all they needed to do was clean up the stray wrapping paper and wash the dishes.
“How am I supposed to know? Religion is different in the wizarding world. ‘Sides, you’re not even Muslim. Your family was just Muslim.”
His insomnia and nightmares had lessened since he started going to the PTSD meetings, but they still sprung up every now and then. He got out of bed. It was 9:34 AM. Harry had gotten almost six hours of sleep; he was up all night completing a sociology project, so he decided to skip Econ that morning.
“Yes, I know. I just wanted to hear you say, ‘Busty Boo,’” the officer admitted with a smirk playing at his mouth. He cleared his throat and continued.
“Um, no,” Draco answered. “But, where’s Darren? Isn’t he supposed to be working the bar with me this evening?”
“It’s okay! You can tell me.” She was laughing now. Draco hated it when people laughed at him. “Aw, look at you. You’re blushing!” She grabbed Draco’s cheek with her thumb and index finger. He swatted her hand away, careful not to hurt her.
Harry thought about his homework: a book to read for English, a paper for World History, a test to study for in Algebra, and several worksheets for therapy. All were due next week.
Draco made kissy noises at them and walked out the front door. He shut it quickly, assuring that they wouldn’t attempt to follow him out. In shame, Draco walked to the nearest store that would sell him two liters of Smirnoff with minimal questions asked.
"Our seventh year has 52 students. Sixth year—61. Fifth—85. Fourth—92. Third—105. Second—95. The first year has about 156 combined. There are so many more muggleborn students."
She whispered, “What happened to you?” There was no malice in her voice. There was no anger or bitterness. There was only concern and curiosity. Draco didn’t know what to do. He forgot the bloody notes. He had no clue what to do.
Draco smelled something that resembled sweat and garbage. He wrinkled up his nose and glanced over at Potter, who was spaced out. Draco decided not to say anything. He didn’t want to embarrass him after all the bloke’s mistakes already that day. Draco went back to reading the syllabus and wondered when, exactly, he’d changed so much. He wondered when he stopped caring so much about not embarrassing his peers. Was it after the war, or was it much sooner? When did he let his façade fall?
Draco stopped writing for a moment. He wondered if he had written the letter with enough irony and dark humor. After all, his mother had known about his habits for a few years.  He continued,
.          "I do hope he's doing okay," she said somberly. Harry could see her adding to the frown lines that were already etched into her face. "I hope he's eating enough. Does he seem okay when you see him on campus?"
.          He fell to his knees and choked out a few tearless sobs. Halloween, his black cat that was missing one eye, walked over to him carefully and slowly. He sniffed his owner and attempted to curl up in his lap. Draco nudged him away and crawled to his room. He picked Cauliflower up and put him out into the living room. He closed the door.
She playfully nudged his arm. A smile played at her lips. “The short black guy! The one that said, ‘watch this’ and then fucking vomited everywhere?”
Harry nodded. He cleared his throat. This damned dry mouth was going to be the death of him. "I have another campus tour today," he stated.
He wondered why he wanted to touch Draco's face so badly. Then, he realized. Draco's presence was always comforting and Harry could easily tell him anything. He paid special attention to Draco's hair and eyes and lips and clothes. Harry took a deep breath. He had a crush on Draco.
“Harry,” she said, handing him four sheets of paper, “I want you to work on these. The first one has two columns; I want you to write down whatever activities you do throughout the day and how those make you feel. The second is just a goal determiner, and the third one is a make-your-own-pie-graph for priorities. What’s most important right now? School, relationships, religion, exercise? The fourth one is called the Gingerbread Man. It shows gender and sexuality as a spectrum. Think you can handle your homework?”
Harry shook his stupor away. “Oh, those. Yeah, um, they’re true. I just figured that I should do something a little more…lowkey, y’know?” Harry swallowed. He noticed that he was rubbing his chin. “Well, uh…I’d better be off. Y’know, big speech to do.” He faked a smile. “Nice seeing all of you again!”
When class had finally ended, Harry was anticipating the next semester. Malfoy had looked at him a total of two times in the entire ninety minutes. Which, of course, Harry wasn’t particularly wanting Malfoy to look at him, but how could he just ignore Harry’s existence?
First Potter was attending his university and now his bar? Did Draco not have one sacred place left? He stopped when he got past the back corner of the bar. He listened closely but could only hear Xavier’s words.
Andromeda responded, “Very confusing to say the least. There’s something very…appealing…about being told you’re better than others. And scary—because obviously not everyone believes it. When I was a kid, it was easy. Bella was the eldest and she undoubtedly held up whatever Mum and Father said. I wanted to follow her footsteps so badly. Cissy is the youngest and perhaps the most introverted. I never knew what
.          “No!” Malfoy responded quickly. “I mean, um, yes. I’m busy. Sorry. I apologize for that. I can’t join you. Have a nice tour.” His face reddened a bit. Harry suddenly became very conscious of Teddy playing with his hair.
"I thought that, um," Draco mumbled to Harry. "It resembles both Gryffindor red and your eye color's green. I thought that it would—"
“Dark tan carpet with some stains. It feels itchy, but it’s okay. The walls are a pale tan. No, wait, they’re white. The…the walls…” He started shaking his head again. These dumb exercises would never work! Draco finally decided to just let go. He would let himself have this stupid meltdown, and then he’d calm down and go to the meeting, and everything would be fine. He started to sob harder.
Harry shook his stupor and said, “Ron, I fought Voldemort, and remember the Triwizard Tournament? I think I’ll be okay.”
Harry worked on his homework until 8 AM when he heard a tap on the window. A large, light brown owl held a letter and a copy of the
The rest of Harry’s day seemed to fly by.While his algebra course worried him, he found that he could breeze through Earth Science and still receive high marks. As for World History, how difficult could muggle history be?
Harry admitted, “Well...he doesn’t look too healthy.” He stopped short of confiding that he had comforted Malfoy out of a panic attack.
He started to laugh awkwardly. “Oh,” he said, “Oh, yeah. I’m a French noble, don’t you know?” Fab and Sally started snorting with laughter. Others in the park just stared at them even harder.
They sat down and Ginny immediately leaned forward and asked, “So, what do you think about Hermione and Ron?”
“Ron. Shut. The. Hic. Up. You can’t boss me around. We’re not kids anymore. So, whoever is going to order drinks for us, I will have a martini,” Ginny barked. Her hiccups continued. She wasn’t even slurring her words, but the blush that crept up on her face and neck was enough to convince everyone of her inebriation.
Harry waited by the owl window for what seemed like hours. He felt silly. He felt likesome teenage girl waiting for her crush to text her back. He let out another exasperated sigh and moved to get some leftovers out of the fridge.
She replied, “No problem. He doesn’t mean harm; he’s just grumpy and hates it when things are out of order. He and his wife moved here from the Dominican Republic in the ‘70s. She died a few years ago, so he’s, y’know, been alone…”
Ginny gasps and her eyes lit up. “Ohhhh thanks Malfoy!” She leaps at him and squeals loudly in his ear making him wince. I snigger and he shoots a glare at me.
“Oh yh, sorry, I’ll go start now.” She coughs nervously and holds out her hand. In a really high-pitched voice, very fake, and as she flutters her eyelashes she says, “Hi! My name is Ginevra Weasely but most people call me Ginny.”
The plan was mapped out over tea and coffee at about 9:30 on a Thursday night. It was decided that Harry would send an owl saying they were breaking up and that he never wanted to see her again.
They come back in later bringing in breakfast and see Draco making Harry as comfortable as possible, making a nest around harry with the bed sheets. Harry pouts when he realises Draco is outside the nest and wants Draco inside. Draco sees and starts to panic because Harry is looking sad and he does not know what he did wrong. Harry shyly asks Draco if he can come in and join him and Draco gives a sigh of relief when he realised that was why Harry was pouting. He sits next to Harry and pulls him onto his lap stroking his hair and Harry just gives him a cute, adorable smile that makes Draco realise that he would do anything, anything, for this boy. Just to see him smiling that smile (preferably at him) again, just to hear him giggle, just to see him blush and get all shy and flustered.
Malfoy tapped Harry on the shoulder and pointed to me, stopping Harry from rambling as to why Harry... keeps his surname - What???
Ron stepped back from the two boys and watched as Draco gently picked Harry up bridal style. “Or maybe, it is personal?” he smirks before continuing. “Do you want his body then? A little fuck toy perhaps? But then why would you care about him? Aren’t Slytherins not supposed to show weakness?”
He falls asleep but has a horrible nightmare. He screams and thrashes around in his sleep kicking Draco and crying out.
Being stuck in his cupboard with nothing to do makes one think. And thinking is a dangerous thing. Harry, is thinking about his sexuality. Dangerous to think about. Better stop before he starts picturing himself with Crabbe or Goyle. I mean he sees himself with Draco Malfoy anyway but that doesn't matter – nobody needs to know that, especially Draco. Not like Draco would ever love him back... right?
He stopped. Draco smiled encouragingly. “At the start when you said it was none of those things, I was heartbroken.” Draco flinched. Harry put a hand on Draco’s cheek and he was sounding slightly breathless. “Then you kept on talking and… I think I just fell in love with you even more.” He blushed a colour so red it rivalled the Weasley hair and he smiled shyly, burying his face in the crook of Draco’s neck. A chorus of ‘awwws’ surrounded the couple and Draco glared at them.
"Mother, if we are not going to get clothes for my beautiful soulmate, I am not leaving this bed until tomorrow." Draco grumbled sleepily at his mother and she looked on in amusement as Harry, still sleepy, flushed from his words.
Tom sprung up immediately and banished the papers into a neat pile on the desk before turning to Mrs Weasley and pointing his wand at her. Gringotts was silent. Everyone had turned to face the scene and many were not breathing.
The adults frowned slightly at Harry's reaction before finally taking a seat opposite the boys. "What's wrong child?" Lucius asked hesitantly. Harry released a choked sob, looking down into his hands. Alarm flooded across everyone's faces, looking at each other in bewilderment and nervousness. "Child, we can't help if you don't tell us what's wrong." Narcissa said softly, kneeling next to the crying teen. "Me!!! I'm what's wrong! I-I'm a freak, I sh-shouldn't want what Draco said but I did and it's wrong-I'm wrong." He sobbed harder as Narcissa pulled him into her lap.
"Harry! What's wrong?" My gorgeous Angel looked up at me with tears streaming down her face. "I- It's so beautiful Draco. How- how did you pay for all this? It must have been expensive!" She was whispering but she looked so happy!
Harry excitedly took it out of the tissue paper and slipped it on. As she admired her bracelet, I took the empty box from her hand and replaced it with the other gift.
Hermione's flag was a deep maroon with the words Hermione Granger – Walking dictionary – Awesome Girlfriend to Ronald in a gold thread. Her boyfriends was a bright orange to show his love for the Chudley Cannons and had his words in a black thread. Ron(ald) Weasley – Weasley is Our King – Awesome Boyfriend to Food (oh and the Bookworm). Lets just say... Hermione didn't approve of his flag. Neville's flag had the words Neville Longbottom – Snake Exterminator – Secretly a Hufflepuff in black on a bright blue background.
You cursed, darling, and for a second there, I was scared that something hurt. But good Circe, it cost my utmost self-control not to move just then. Everything in me screamed to get more of that feeling, the heat around my prick, the slippery friction… Fuck, I had that hint of what was to come, but I didn’t have it just yet.
You’ll be happy to know that the quantity of letters that I’ve been receiving has rather gone up since the two of us went public, and that many wizards and witches out there think we are quite the romance novel. If only they knew what we get up to in the RofR my lovely; then they’d know for sure.
We watched the grey shadows move across the ceiling, day turning into night, and I felt, rather than heard, the rumble of breath from your chest. You smelt so fucking fantastic too, like warm skin, bedsheets and clean sweat and so entirely Draco and then I just knew. It was like a spell had been cast, or an enchantment revealed, and I knew. I wanted you to make love to me. The same thought must have occurred to you too, for I felt your hands begin to move across my naked form, all across my hollows and curves.
You have no idea how wonderful you are, Harry. You are so full of love. Impulsive, thoughtful, determined, shy – I love you in all your shades.
Teddy got interested in the greenery of the neighbour’s back garden we sat in, and somehow it ended up being my task to release him from his pushchair and watch him. I don’t know why exactly, but it was the most fascinating thing to me to watch him touch the damp grass, the leafy bushes and, well, he also picked a narcissus from the flowerbed. Totally not my fault.
“If you insist,” I complained, nuzzling your hair, and just enjoying having you in my arms, flirting, and feeling loved. “Time for the eggs, I reckon,” I told you then. “You know how to break an egg?”
Draco, your joy was intoxicating. You bounded through long corridors, and through your eyes I saw your home.
I’ve said it a million times – and I’ll say it a million more – but the war happened. It happened, darling, and it is a part of who we both are. Greyback, and Voldemort, and the Battle of Hogwarts happened, and we can’t vanish all that with a wave of our wand. If you felt like you couldn’t talk to me about those things, I know that I would worry.
Long story short: The dragon demands his mate. Get your arse down here, Potter. And bring your books or your homework. Today I might have some charms up my sleeve which might prove to be even more enticing than kisses to your beautiful face.
You must know that I’ve never felt like that myself. I’ve never been transported out of my body by any kiss in my life. It sounds like the two of you had been dancing around each other for weeks, waiting for the right moment.
Not the sexy stuff – not that it wasn’t perfect – but just being with you. Cooking for you. I’d like to do that. I’d learn all the fancy dishes that you enjoyed, and I’d make them. Not for any reason. I’d do it just because I loved you. I’d rub your feet and your calves after you’d been on them all day. At night, I’d bury my head in the crook of your shoulder. The smell of your soap clean skin would fill my nostrils and then I’d go to sleep knowing I was luckier than any person had the right to be.
Does that make me peculiar; watching my fiancé sleeping? Don’t worry too much about the Dreamless Sleep either. It was prescribed for a reason, and as long as you’re mindful of how much you’re imbibing, I’m not too worried. When we live at Grimmauld Place, we’ll work on weaning you off it together; I don’t mind staying up to whatever-hours to keep you company.
And I’m sorry that you felt forced to sit there, all mute and stiff. Had I been beside you I would very much like to have held your hand, almost like it was a date. We could have shared my sweets and you might even have rested your head on my shoulder.
Okay. Time to get settled in this very solitary, very uncomfortable bed. Why is it I wasn’t conscious of how cold and lumpy it was before? I’m going to close my eyes, and in my mind’s eye, play out every moment of last night. The small noises of pleasure you made when our naked bodies came together, and the slick slide of your lubed-up prick between my arse cheeks and the way it nudged my balls so delightfully.
I have polished my shoes as well, packed the heirloom watch that Arthur was wonderful enough to give me, and I’ve even packed an extra-large tub of Sleekeazys for the occasion – even though its success on my hair is partial, at best – because I want to make a good impression.
I’m sorry I was late to our meeting, and that I arrived tousled and red in the face. I had to run all the way from the Quidditch pitch. The Gryffindor Reserves had been very excitable for the whole practice, wanting to talk of nothing else but the OM ceremony and the kiss I’d shared with you. The younger ones are staunchly in love with the idea of us, Draco, and it heartened me to hear them tell me that they won’t hear any slurs on our characters.
There’s nobody else for me, Draco. Fuck, even when we hated each other I was captivated by you. My eyes would burn into you, and I’d want to crawl inside your skin, tear you to pieces and see what made you tick. You were a problem, a knotty mystery that I wanted to unravel.
“I always thought that I’m the perfect loner,” Theo went on. “But this year is so tough. There’s just no one I can talk to. Hardly anyone came back.”
Cissa?! Holy Mother of Merlin, better not try calling her that in person. No nicknames. Completely indecorous.
Mother is in Lyon, by the way. I think I never told you. We own an apartment in an urban villa there. The rooms are furnished with antiques in rather regal colours. It’s as ostentatious as it sounds, darling. My bedchamber there had a rather testy Enchanted Looking Glass hanging above the commode. It sometimes called me names in French, that pompous git.
Mm. As I’m writing I can still taste your cum on my tongue, and I can still smell you, warm from the sheets and layered with an odour of sex.
“Mind Healing,” I said, admittedly feeling a little deflated, “It’s really changed my life this year,” I clarified, “but I think that I’d have to take a full Healing degree and I’m not sure that I’m that good. My Potions marks have gotten better this year, but I’ve never been all that outstanding.” I showed her the details of the degree. “It says here that I’d need an Outstanding, and I’m not sure that’s a possibility.”
And all I did, Draco, was answer them as best I could. That was all I could do. They even wanted to place truth charms on me so my evidence couldn't be questioned.
I shall devour your every word once you start writing with this quill, love. You’re not exaggerating when you say that you’re a poet. You write the most beautiful things.
But if there’s one thing, I need to prove to myself, it’s that I’m capable of becoming my own man. Merlin knows how much I’ve always relied on my heritage, influential relations, and even on you. That doesn’t mean that I wouldn’t accept your help, or even Mother’s. And it’s your idea, after all, that sparked the desire in me to brew potions for a living and to deliver them by owl.
“Draco,” I said, taking your mug from your trembling hand, and placing it carefully on the table. I took your hand in mine. “Talk to me love, please. Tell me if there’s anything I can do.”
You murmured your consent, and I felt you spread your legs wider, welcoming me, exposing your sweet, beautiful pucker that I adore so very much, and I felt the last of my worries leave me.
One thing is for sure: Pansy is every bit as infatuated as poor Theo. They are in love, exactly as I am with you. xx
Hogwarts brought me some more freedom then. It would be wrong to say that I didn’t like going back to the… Going back home. But it did feel a bit like a prison sometimes. I’m an only child and I remember very lonesome and boring times at my family home. When I was younger, long before Hogwarts even, I always thought that I’d have a lot of children so they wouldn’t have to be as lonely. I don’t really know why I’m telling you this, but well. Here you go.
You’re right about Hermione. She really is something, isn’t she? Intelligent, fierce and so strong. There’s nobody better to have in your corner than her and I’ve never met a person with a bigger heart. I know that the two of you have a problematic history, but if she’s deemed you worthy of discussing Arithmancy with you then you’re good as accepted in her spell-book.
Then, like we planned, I’ll meet you in the Great Hall before we make our way to Hogsmeade together with the rest of the year group. From there we’ll Floo across to the Ministry building in Caerleon, south Wales – where the real Merlin once received an audience! – and then, according to the instructions I received yesterday, we’ll be given some sandwiches, given a tour of the sites associated with England’s chief wizard and afterwards get shown to our seats. You’re my plus-one, so there won’t be a moment when we’ll have to be apart.
I’m really sorry for what you must’ve been through in your childhood. Sounds like adults planting a good and proper portion of self-loathing inside our blank-slate minds is a huge thing for the both of us. Tabula rasa – that’s what you’re talking about. The concept of being born without innate ideas, but rather learning everything through perception and deduction. It goes back to Aristotle, perhaps you know all about that. Anyway. I’ve learnt about this such a long time ago, but it’s always been naught but an abstract concept to me. Never have I tried to see it as something that might well be applied to real life experiences.
Don’t worry – I know that’s a bit closer to curfew than I expect you’d planned, but if we don’t draw attention to ourselves then I promise no one will question our leaving. We’ll take the utilities door, the one that’s down near the Elves’ sleeping quarters? Don’t worry if you don’t know it, I’ll show you where it's located. Trust me, love! I’ve been sneaking out of that entrance to visit Hagrid for years.
We were at the breakfast table when Hermione came flouncing in. “Harry James Potter,” she said in her McGonagall voice, but she couldn’t really hide her grin. She dropped a copy of the Quibbler on the table. “You can’t be serious. I even got you the Mufflemumps tincture from the hospital wing on the night of the Ball last year – only to read now that you’ve been feigning it? You told me that you were writing with your diary friend, but this…” She shook her head then and sat down. “But this is a very cute first date,” she ended her sentence.
I took you in my mouth then, licking you around the head until your thighs were quivering, and only then did I dare to go deeper. I swallowed as much of you as I could manage, and darling, you seemed to like it. Your fingers threaded lightly though my hair, and if I could have smiled, Draco I would have. You whispered my name, whispered ‘Harry,’ like it was an incantation, and then you came for me, a whole-body shudder marking the moment you ejaculated. Circe, but you were so bloody hot. So sexy, the way you came for me. You’re the fulfilment of my every dirty fantasy.
We ate dinner together only this evening, and held hands throughout, and we revised afterwards in the Gryffindor common room. I got the impression that I rather impressed you with my detailed knowledge of Leonardo da Vinci’s work on the alignment of the planets. Okay, I admit, I had only revised that particular page of my textbook this afternoon, but it was worth it to see the beautiful smile that curved across your face.
What do you think, love? Do you think that Dean and he had something in the past that came to end? Surely neither of them broke it off? I can’t remember any occasion that the two of them have slept in the same bed this eighth year but then my mind has been focused on other matters! Merlin, but Seamus looked so unhappy, and I can hardly bear it.
Right now, you’re sitting across the bedroom from me, sipping from a mug of tea and pulling apart a sandwich that you’re eating in tiny bites. I wish I could show you how you look through my eyes.
Well, despite my little rant above, I feel like our roles are reversed. I have been telling you about my life up to fifth or sixth year sometime, when I proved to be quite good at saying acerbic, untrue things to those in close proximity. And my angst was either non-existent or perfectly bottled away somewhere, I have no idea. Now though? Merlin, I panic about the weirdest things. I try to keep my head down, but I swear I have a kick drum for a heart.
I’m glad that writing to me has eased your mind after visiting St Mungo’s. It is indeed a dreadful place. The smell, the noise, the dull walls, … Hate it even though I’ve been there only very few times. But for every visit to the hospital that either of us will have, we will hold each other’s hands. And if that shouldn’t be possible, it will be like today: we will be with each other in our hearts and minds. I love you.
Love, I felt the anger and even all the excitement from the duel vanish at once. You looked so thoughtful – I even felt bad for writing anything but nice things about Ron and Hermione in our diary earlier. I scooted closer to you and put my arm around you. We rested our temples against each other, and I tried to be the solid comfort you needed in that moment.
So, yeah. Only blokes for me so far, I suppose. Did you ever have a boyfriend? I don’t know anyone at Hogwarts who’s out. Or maybe I’m just not up to date when it comes to the lovey-dovey affairs of our dear schoolmates.
Merlin, all these words… It’s my travelogues, I swear! Concerning your question: there are some places with somewhat loose regulations on the Statute of Secrecy. Especially if those places make a lot of money from dumb-struck Muggle tourists. No matter how obvious it gets, they don’t see that there’s magic involved. Not the way we do anyway. Britain is dreadfully strict on it though, you’re right on the wand there.
As I suspect Draco Malfoy would have been as well. I’ve heard rumours about the conditions he was forced to endure during the war. The way that his father sold his family down the river for power and put the Malfoy name above everything he should have held close to his heart. Someone close to me once said that it was our choices that show what we truly are, and Draco, well he-
But Merlin, you were right about Valentine’s Day. Just as per usual, the school turned into a bunch of cuddly Hufflepuffs. Barely anyone was concentrated on our classes – not even the teachers! Well, except for McGonagall who wore a rather exasperated expression at all the lovey-dovey students.
Mm. Just reading back and it seems that I’m laying here, telling you secrets meant for your ears only. I like it. I like you.
“I was terrified that as soon as my boyfriend realised, I was Harry Potter, he’d not want me,” Harry disclosed. “My heroic image felt like a stone around my neck.”
I saw your eyes widen, ever so slightly, when I said that I regretted not seizing the initiative last night, and that I was very sure that the right time for our planned collaboration wouldn’t be too far in the future.
I’m so moved by your thoughtfulness. I can’t say with words how much your suggestion that I could stay with you after Hogwarts means to me. And that you want to be there for me, come what may. I swear to Hecate that I’ll never admit that to anyone but you. I bloody cried when I read that. I couldn’t help myself when I thought about it, given that I didn’t ask you for any help and that you offer this all on your own accord. This is seriously one of the nicest things anyone has ever done for me.
Last excurse for today: Travel. A top three is a very demanding demand. But you’re in luck. Instead of reading up for my homework, I made up my mind about places I’ve visited. (Don’t feel guilty, you sap, it was a welcome distraction.) But you’ll have to be patient. I don’t want to overwhelm you. So, I proudly present
Not all of them, unfortunately! I’ve eaten a (fair) few of the Bertie Botts and one of the Cauldron Cakes. I haven’t actually had too big an appetite this afternoon. There’s been a few too many Wrackspurts rolling about in my belly. It’s funny really; we’ve talked about all sorts of private, intimate subjects but they felt like letters.
Once the dust of the war had settled, both Harry and Draco returned to school to complete their eighth year, a daunting undertaking for two men that had served on opposite sides of the war. Part of this difficult adjustment was to be matched with a fellow student, and to share a long-term diary with them.  Harry was keen to talk about the process.
You tidied a few things and then – I suppose because you didn’t want to distract me too much – you wandered off. And as it has always been with us, your disappearing sparked my interest to the point that I couldn’t sit still, but rather wanted to see what you were up to.
All kidding aside. How does the ring feel so far, love? Have you cast something with it yet? But tell me all about it. Is it soothing? Does it feel like it would restrict your magic? Don’t listen to Mother about you being ignorant. She has no idea how very un-magical your upbringing really was, Harry.
So, yes. Back to our non-Ball. I can’t stop thinking about it. It’s on my mind every moment. It was just…well, it was everything.
I want to talk about you. I was thinking: perhaps you could pursue potions as a career? Your probation sounds awfully restrictive, and I imagine that might make working in a traditional nine-five job a little challenging.
I apologised for my mindlessness with a squeeze of your hand and asked if you would be willing to Side-Along us. “St John’s Wood – ever been there?” You shook your head. “Doesn’t matter. You Apparate us a bit further northwest from here. Just let me take over while we’re Apparating, and I’ll lead the way. Think we can do that without Splinching?”
“I can work,” you said, “and I’m going to. My plan is to be self-sufficient, and to brew potions from Grimmauld Place. I’ll brew them on site and send them out by owl delivery. There’s a niche market,” you continued, your voice gaining confidence with every syllable, “brewing smaller volumes, quantities that it’d cost the big Apothecaries too much to prepare.” Your eyes flicked across to me.
You slid your hand into mine and led me to the settee in the middle of the room, all business like and efficient and I followed. Can I admit something? I was a little bit fearful in that moment. Snape’s fingers, carding through my memories, dismissing them, ridiculing them, hurting me physically with his derision, was such a painful practice for me, and the last thing I wanted was to wound you the same way.
Let me assure you, Harry, that everything pales at the prospect of being Pottered. Despite the possible synonyms that might occur to you, being Pottered with a capital P means to have someone you can trust entirely to jump to your aid, no matter what. To rely on the knowledge that someone will accept you without being resentful. It means to have a supportive friend who’s willing to do anything for you.
“Don’t be daft,” I said. “Of course, she’s speaking about you. She even used the words I quoted back to her – that ‘step up your game’ part? She does like you.”
You took me by the hand then and led me to the shabby room at the back where the telescopes were stored. Circe, darling, but you weren’t fibbing when you said that all I needed to bring tonight was myself. You’d transformed the space entirely, transfiguring a couple of the desks into a mattress and stringing two lengths of magic fairy lights across the walls and ceiling.
I couldn’t help but interrupt. “Draco was my partner for that event,” I said, incredulous at the ridiculousness of his line of questioning, “and as such he needed clothes that befitted the occasion. If you don’t allow him access to his home or to his belongings, then I fail to see what else we could have done! The watch is a courting gift, a wizarding tradition. Had Draco been a witch then I really don’t believe that you’d even have begun this line of questioning.” I shook my head, sceptical. “I said before that we’re in love and that Draco is going to live here, with his husband. We’ll comply with every regulation that you deem necessary, but these questions are farcical at best! If these silly observations are the only evidence you’ve got, then I suggest you let me finally sign the residency form and be done with it.”
A series of memories of you and I without our clothes on? I rather think it would work brilliantly, Draco, and you know what the best part is? If, for some reason it didn’t work – and it will, I can be a fantastic teacher when I put my mind to it – then we will have to work hard at making a few more memories to add to your collection. I reckon that can easily be arranged.
Of ALL the identities that I’ve ever had to carry in my short years on the earth, being your boyfriend was the one that I wanted, needed – craved – most of all. I never lied. I never exaggerated how I felt. When I said that I loved you it wasn’t some invention made to pass the time of day or said for my own amusement.
You asked how fit I am. Well, there are two answers to that question, aren’t there? I’m going to start with the more likely one. I’m pretty active, as wizards go. I’ve even taken up jogging a little bit over the last few weeks which isn’t the most pleasant of experiences during a grey drizzly morning, but I do feel like it’s been worth it once I’m back in the Great Hall and enjoying my breakfast. It does get the endorphins moving and certainly leaves me more cheerful. My friends all say they appreciate the difference at the very least! I’m sharpish on my broom too. I won’t be trying out for any Quidditch teams though. The life of a professional sportsperson fills me with abject horror. I’d have to give up my sweets and chocolate addiction, which isn’t happening in this life or the next!
Darling, I’m not sure what’s going on there. I smell some sort of odd mother-girlfriend-competition here, which I don’t wish to be involved in any deeper. But Circe, the next thing that happened between our friends was a fervent kiss. They are still holding hands now, Hermione’s thumb caressing the back of Ron’s hand very idly, very tenderly. Luna is smiling down at her Divination textbook, and I’m sitting here, thinking of you.
I told you I wouldn’t be able to keep up. And you have much more stamina and velocity than one might expect, Potter. You can’t really blame me for cutting part of the track you were running so I could catch up with you. But Salazar, you should have seen the indignation on your face, picking up some pace even though you’d been running for so long, shouting “That’s cheating, Malfoy!”
With a sigh, Ron did seem to calm down a bit. “Look, I didn’t mean…” What he didn’t mean, I didn’t learn, but he went on at last. “What’s annoying me is that Hermione won’t be around. In my head, we were going to get married in some months’ time or so. I…” His eyes flickered over my face as though he wasn’t sure if he could confide in me. He blushed when he said, “I dreamt of a bonding ceremony in summer. Maybe some time around the Solstice.”
My belief, from meeting with Narcissa yesterday, is that all the witch is doing is following the only pattern of conduct that she has ever known in her life. If you think about it, my love, it all makes sense. She is simply seeking to put you – her beloved family – first. Everything makes sense.
Let me get back to Mother quickly – I think I might have scared you a bit. As I said, she won’t hug you and call you her son the day I introduce you two. Actually, she might just be like you described your mates: wary. I’m so thankful to your friends that you had each other’s backs. It really does sound like they are your family, especially now that I start comparing them to Mother. This might sound a little off to you, but that’s just what came to my mind.
“At first,” I answered, “my anonymous diary-mate was just a really good friend, somebody that I felt that I could be open with when everybody else in my life seemed to need me to be heroic or brave. When I came back to school, I felt anything but courageous.” I squeezed your waist and leant over to brush a kiss across your shoulder. “But writing to my shrewd, well-travelled, funny new friend soon became the brightest highlight of my days. Before I knew it, I was rushing back to the dorm each night to write to him.”
“Part of the reason that I’m writing is to ask permission to bring Draco alongside me when I visit over Easter. I know that we’ve had a lot of media attention during the last few months, some of it good, other parts negative, but those articles aren’t anything close to the truth.
In the little booklet is also a list of potions, ingredients, and properties I'm allowed to brew for commercial purposes. There are different levels for what is allowed and when, and the notes about ingredients and properties are for invented potions. I will have to study all of it intensely to find out the differences and see what I’m allowed to brew as a Potions N.E.W.T. graduate.
Thanks for this wonderful Valentine’s Day, Harry. It’s been a perfect night and I’ve written you so ridiculously many words now because I didn’t want to let the night slip away just yet. Whenever I’m with you, I feel so loved. I can only hope that I make you feel this way as well. Words can’t say how much I adore you. Have the sweetest dreams, Harry darling.
