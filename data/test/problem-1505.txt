Harry’s caught off guard when Draco pushes him down on the bed and rolls them over so that Harry is looking up at Draco, the sunlight making his hair shine gold.
Harry smiles ruefully. “Yes, it was supposed to be a surprise. I’ve told you how every year Molly Weasley knits her family jumpers for Christmas?”
“He lives with you and I know that you wouldn’t agree to go out with someone unless you knew them really well and trusted them. Draco is the only person I know who fits that criteria.”
Draco falls back into his seat. “I doubt it. I don’t think they follow the same etiquette rules that we were forced to learn.”
“Hey, don’t be nervous,” Harry says, setting down a cup of tea and a large plate with several pieces of dessert on the table. “It’s only George and Ron and they like you.”
Harry clears his throat and hopes his voice doesn’t tremble when he finally says, “He’s very fit and not hard on the eyes, but there’s nothing official yet. I haven’t even asked him out on a date.”
Harry sits down on the bed and begins sorting the clothes. “So you have lice. It’s not the end of the world.”
Draco frowns. “Why do I need this?”
Hermione rubbed soothing circles onto his back. “Harry, you need to think about this rationally. You told me that Draco has changed. Do your really think that he cares about your appearance?”
In front of the small group, Luna’s rainbow wedding dress shimmers every time she moves. She has sunflowers braided into her hair and a glimmering tiara made of silver unicorn horns sits on her head. In her hands she holds a white dove with a bouquet of sunflowers in its beak.
“You’re
Draco feels his cheeks warm at the sincerity of the words. By now he’s used to Harry speaking his mind, although Draco sometimes still struggles with saying what he means. “It happens,” Draco says at last, shrugging. “It could have been worse. Luckily, it wasn’t a Weasley jumper with the wrong letter.”
Pansy nods. “I would never wear one in its original state, but there’s nothing a good charm can’t fix. However, I don’t understand, why would you dress your child as an animal?”
“And now? Do you still want to leave?” Harry asked. Again, he grabbed Draco’s arm as if he was afraid that Draco would Apparate away.
“Pansy, I can’t shop there,” Draco says.
Draco remembers George and Ron sharing a few laughs with Harry at the Burrow, but he had been too busy helping Mrs Weasley with the food.
On the night in question, Draco had been out celebrating a colleague's birthday. One drink had turned into many and he had only seen that the man in front of him had messy black hair and hazel eyes, close enough to green in the dim light.
“Harry, I know you. You sacrificed yourself to help defeat Voldemort. You want to help people any way you can. And I don’t fault you for that; it’s in your nature. But I do want you to understand that you deserve an apology at the very least. You may want to help your niece, but don’t forget how you were treated by his family.”
“Like that’s such a hardship. You’re a fashion editor, always on the lookout for the latest designs. Admit it, you’ll enjoy this. Now, are you ready to go?”
Ron Weasley, who did have his red uniform on that was covered in tears and dark stains that looked like blood, stood up and offered Harry a hand.
“No! Nothing like that! I didn’t bring home a literal man,” Harry hastily explains, turning around to see that Draco’s lips are pressed in a thin line. “I brought you back a statue.”
Harry scratches behind her ears, stopping when he spots the blue yarn twisted around her body. His eyes grow wide before he gently pulls the blue jumper away from Holly's body.
Luna grasps both of his hands and guides them away from the crowd and into her home. They head towards the kitchen where Luna helps him sit in a chair and hands him a glass of water before locking the door.
That got Harry’s attention and he glanced at Draco, confusion written all over his face. “You’re leaving?”
“I’m so glad you enjoy my misery,” Draco deadpans. He holds up his hand and shows it to her. “Believe it or not, I had a scratch here. It’s like they went mad when they saw the jumper and anytime I tried to take it away, they would hiss and claw my hand. Harry didn’t tell me until later it’s because he spilled some catnip onto the jumper.”
“Your
“No, he didn’t kill Mr Hoppy!” Teddy says. All three turn to look at the corner of Draco’s office that houses the first patient that Draco had ever treated. Mr Hoppy, a black rabbit with a pink nose, named because he had broken his leg hopping down from a tree after a bout of Teddy’s underage magic, is Teddy’s pet. Draco breathes a sigh of relief when he realises that Mr Hoppy is also very much alive, even if he’s sleeping peacefully at the moment.
“Of course. If he’ll have me.”
“A little trouble out on a raid, but everything’s fine now,” Ron answered and he bent down to help Harry stand up. “What are you doing here? Weren’t you in Montreal?”
“I have no doubt about that,” Harry says, smiling just before Draco begins kissing him.
Not for the first time, Harry questions the brilliance of living in a fifth floor Muggle flat with a broken lift.
Not even ten seconds pass before Draco asks, “Is it chocolate?”
Harry’s puzzled look soon changed into surprise when he opened it and saw what was inside. Draco had found the journal hidden in the floorboards of Sirius Black’s room. Inside, the pages were filled with drawings and scribbles that Sirius had probably written in order to keep him entertained during his lessons. “It was Sirius Black’s journal. Your father wrote in it frequently. So did Professor Lupin.”
“Uncle Harry!” Teddy exclaims, pointing a finger in Harry’s face, “you said a very bad word.” Teddy is sitting in Harry’s lap, munching on an apple as he watches the telly.
! Draco thinks. He training to be a veterinarian; he should be used to all kinds of creatures, especially if he hopes to pass his exams tomorrow.
They walk slowly to Teddy’s side, trying not to startle the young boy.
this surprise.”
ing and traveling of the Floo Network, or the uncertainty of what awaits them in Pansy’s flat. He just hopes that nothing terrible has happened.
the group of carolers sing as Draco steps out of Tesco.
Dudley slowly nods. “Okay.”
“Yes, it’s a recent development,” Harry says in a neutral tone as if he were just discussing the weather. Maybe if Harry keeps his voice low and bored, Ron will lose interest and talk about something more exciting, like Quidditch. It doesn’t seem likely, however, because the breakup is the biggest thing to happen to Harry all year.
Before Draco can answer, a shop assistant named Amy comes up and asks, “How may I help you?” She looks old enough to be his mother, but has lines around her eyes and mouth that Narcissa would never allow. She beams at the outfit he holds in his hand. “Wonderful choice! My cat Cleo loves her reindeer outfit.”
“No, everyone would have just ignored it. I had a shipment of plants arrive today and I had to make sure the mandrakes were put away properly before they petrify someone. I had forgotten you were coming,” Neville says, smiling apologetically. “Your note was vague. Hopefully you’re not in trouble?”
Draco nods. He remembers seeing the Weasley children return from Christmas break wearing different coloured jumpers, sometimes with their initials, every single year.
“I know everything,” Draco murmurs against Harry’s neck. He doesn’t offer any explanation, instead choosing to massage Harry’s neck and shoulders. Harry groans as Draco’s long fingers dig deep into his skin, working out the stress that has accumulated this past week.
Hermione shook her head. “I don’t think it’s good for my parents to leave. They might not remember me, but this is the only home my parents know. Perhaps in the future, but not right now.”
“You can even take the peacock out so it can strut on the ground,” Harry says.
“It looks like we need somewhere more private. So don’t go into the garden for the next half hour,” Draco says, winking.
“I felt like it, so I went to St Mungo’s yesterday. They did a lot of tests and it turns out that in a couple of months, you’ll be a big brother.”
Draco smirks. “Well, you can try, but no one will believe you. Besides, where did you think I learned that spell? It’s untraceable; one of the perks of the job.”
Without meaning to, Harry’s eyes find Malfoy’s in the crowd. Malfoy’s grey eyes widen for just a second before he turns around and walks away, ignoring the cheers that have started chanting Harry’s name. It seems that no one has noticed whom Harry had been staring at.
“Are you actually talking to me now?” Draco said as he made himself another cup of tea. “Or are we going to pretend that nothing happened?”
Harry frowned, opening and closing his mouth as if he thought better of it. Instead, he reached across the table and took Draco’s hand in his. His fingers were callused and tanned, very different from Draco’s own, but they still sent a spark of warmth through Draco’s body.
“Well, he reminded me of you. His name is David.”
Harry clenches his hands into fists to keep his magic from accidentally unleashing. “That’s what everyone thought. But we grew apart, just like Ginny and I did. Our relationship is not like yours and Hermione’s; I can see you two dying of old age together, but to be honest, I realised Charlie and I weren’t meant to last forever. I don’t know if I will ever find that.”
“Nothing. It’s something I thought would cheer you up.”
pale and death-like. Long, skeletal fingers that are probably cold to the touch, and paper-thin skin that looks like it would fade into nothingness. Not to mention the fact that he seems able to read minds.
George sighs, wiping his mouth with a napkin. “Well, I thought that I would be able to put this off a little bit longer, but let’s get down to it. We have a business proposal for you. Show him, Ron.”
“It’s so silly, you know, to still call Draco by his last name, don’t you think?” Her grey eyes peer down at him and Harry can’t reply with anything but the truth.
“Are you sure?” Pansy and the driver ask at the same time. They both have sceptical looks on their faces, but when Draco nods and says, “absolutely,” the driver pulls over to the kerb.
As he walks to the coffee shop, he hardly sees anyone in the streets this early. Soon, however, the shops will open and Draco can buy his jumper as well as something to give the hosts tonight. Perhaps he will buy some wine to go along with Harry’s dish.
The Great Hall, once silent, now breaks out into loud chatter and there’s even a camera flash coming from the direction of the Ravenclaw table. Draco hears Weasley call out “Harry!”, but nothing can distract him from the fact that they have revealed their relationship to everyone at Hogwarts. There’s no doubt now that news of them dating will make the front page of the
So Harry had taken a chance and kissed him. What he got in return was a night so emotionally charged that a single Patronus produced from that memory would be able to fend off all the dementors in Azkaban.
, the light from the spell blinding them momentarily.
Too late, Harry tries to defend Malfoy to his friends, but they aren’t paying him any attention as Hermione begins to scold Ron. As Harry gets up to join the crowd of single guests, he hears Ron tell Hermione, “He’s lying, Hermione. He’s just as single as Harry is now. Or else he would have brought a date to the wedding just to show off.”
Ron looks in disbelief at Harry, his cheeks turning as red as his hair. “You can’t be serious.”
“No cheating,” Harry says.
Teddy’s red-rimmed eyes turn to look up at Draco. “Do you promise?”
lets Draco know that he has spent the last three hours revising for his exams.
“It’s perfect,” Draco says. He opens the clasp and holds it closer to inspect it properly. Up close, Draco can see the tiny paint strokes of the dashes of colour in the gold tree. The peacock preens and spreads its tail under Draco’s attention. The green plumage reminds Draco of Harry’s eyes and he looks up to thank Harry.
“Harry, is this my Weasley jumper?” Draco asks, looking down at the blue jumper, tracing a finger over the white
“Wrong person,” she says.
in the centre. Attached to it is a ball of yarn and knitting needles, and Draco realises that it looks like a Weasley jumper.
, something that Harry had insisted on when Draco had come to stay. Draco decided that he would get another book from his bag.
Teddy peeks from behind the door. “You have to close your eyes.”
“I’m sure it’s not that bad,” Amy says as Pansy quietly snorts, “What happened?”
This is a surprise to Harry, who looks over at Draco with a raised eyebrow. Draco has never mentioned seeing Dudley before, not even when he wanted to get revenge on Harry’s behalf.
Harry bursts out laughing. “You’re right,” Harry says. “She is finally retiring and she gave it to me last time I visited Hogwarts. Even though her classes were awful, she did predict some real prophecies, so I thought it would be useful to have.”
“What happened?” Harry asks, tracing the scratch with the tip of his wand.
“Thank you.”
“Oh, ha! It’s edible gold with chocolate. Only the best for you, chosen one.” He continues laughing as he leans his head against Harry’s shoulder.
Harry nods. “Yes. I told you I was planning on asking you to join me at the Burrow tomorrow. I didn’t want you to feel left out at the dinner, so I was trying to knit you one. I was so happy when I received one my first Christmas at Hogwarts, so I wanted to include you in the family tradition because you mean so much to me.” Harry’s cheeks turn red, but he never breaks eye contact as he says those words. “But since I was away for most of December, I couldn’t finish it.”
Harry comes around the sofa and sinks into it, his side pressed against Draco as he wraps his arms around Draco’s waist. He murmurs against Draco’s ear, “Is it true? You’re pregnant?”
Immediately, Draco’s eyes grow cold. He’s heard all about Harry’s Muggle family and every time Harry has nightmares about the cupboard under the stairs, Draco has to be reminded that Harry doesn’t need to get revenge.
She looks at him in confusion. “Why not? I’m sure you’ll find something there, even if it’s not as soft as unicorn hair.”
Pansy flings the door open so hard that it hits the wall and starts to shut again. Harry barely manages to leave the door open a crack, hoping that the shadows prevent Draco from seeing him.
“Will you stay for dinner? It’s nothing fancy; I’m just ordering pizza.”
“No, I’m not judging you,” Harry quickly says. “I just want to make sure you’re okay. You were so excited the last few weeks about the potion you were brewing, and then this week you barely mentioned anything at all, even though you have a deadline today. And then I come home to find that you’ve sat on the couch all day, alone in the dark…” Harry trails off as Draco frowns and presses his lips into a thin line.
Neville’s eyes are wide by the time Harry has finished talking. “You sound like you’re pretty serious about him, Harry.”
“Why the fuck do I want a statue?”
Draco sighed. He had spent three weeks abroad and had forgotten about the time difference between Montreal and London. It was three in the morning and no sane person would be awake right now. Perhaps Harry was out on the field and hadn’t had time to leave a note.
“I’ll tell him. He will understand. And I promise you that we will visit you soon.” She Transfigured a postcard from a napkin and handed it to him. “Write to him. Tell him that you are going back home.”
“Now, Harry, I wouldn’t be that dramatic,” Andromeda says, while trying not to smile. “My nephew knows that these things happen. It’s one of the joys of raising children.”
of his hair is green. I bet Hermione is so pleased,” Draco says, shuddering.
“He’s not coming back?” Teddy interrupts, his voice breaking.
Harry gaped at her. He knew that she was the brightest witch he had ever met, but to guess correctly after only a small amount of clues?
There was no reason not to accept the request. Except that Harry had regretted it as soon as he entered his home at 12 Grimmauld Place. Draco Malfoy had been cooking dinner and had turned when he heard Harry spill out of the fireplace.
Still, Teddy had recently contacted lice from the Muggle primary school he attended and there was a large possibility that he had passed it on to both Draco and Harry.
Hermione had told Draco that Harry, if left to his own devices, would start to decorate the minute Halloween was over. It wouldn’t be too much at first, a sprig of holly here and there, maybe a porcelain figurine on the kitchen table. However, it wouldn’t take long until Harry would drag a tree inside the house and insist on Draco helping him decorate.
“Harry,” Draco whispers.
Draco opened his eyes and immediately closed them again. His room was too bright and as he fumbled around searching for his wand, his teeth chattered because it was far colder than usual. He cast a warming spell and opened his eyes once more.
. Until recently, Harry’s clock hand had been at
was still asleep.” Pansy yawns. “Can this wait until later?”
“I don’t think he likes me,” Teddy whispers.
Draco dropped his messenger bag on the sofa and made his way upstairs. He stood in front of Harry’s door and knocked, but did not receive a response. He knocked harder and even pressed his ear against the door, but was greeted with silence. He had the feeling that Harry wouldn’t ask for any help tonight.
Harry kept in mind that Malfoy hadn’t said he wouldn’t date Harry, only that he doesn’t ‘date taken men.’ That had been one of the motivations for Harry to break up with Charlie, who, after this morning, is now avoiding him and is standing as far away as possible for the bouquet toss.
“Oh, that’s my dad. I’m not supposed to talk to strangers so please don’t tell him,” Daisy pleads.
Harry smiles at such a harmless piece of magic. It’s something he imagines Hermione would have done as a child.
Draco nods, even though he doesn’t know how to use it. He picks up the calculator and feels a surge of energy, like he’s being shocked. He quickly drops the calculator and steps back.
“What do you want, Malfoy?” Ron, ever the loyal friend, asks with a scowl on his face.
“Shut up. You know I had the
Before he can change his mind, Draco loops the tie around his neck, knotting it in place, and tucks the end in his vest. He’s seen couples wear each other’s clothing all the time, so why can’t he? Besides, Pansy is sure to notice and that’s all that matters.
Draco still looks unconvinced.
“What does it look like, Potter? Lice! I have
He couldn’t understand Harry’s decision. “Why would you do that?”
Hopefully, Harry’s present brings Draco some cheer. “Well, if you peek your head out, I have a surprise for you.”
, he thinks, as he carefully opens the envelope and unfolds the paper.
Draco sits stiffly at the dining room table trying to read a Potions article about the discovery of the thirteenth use of dragon’s blood. The article holds no interest for him; he’s too busy staring at the teenage girl in front of him.
“Ah,” Harry says, winking at Draco. “I’m afraid I can’t. I love him too much and he has shown me the error of my ways. Pineapple is an essential topping,” Harry says, kissing him again. This time Draco happily returns the kiss, making sure to run his fingers through Harry’s hair.
“Now that’s hardly fair,” Harry protested, putting on his glasses. “I do know you, Draco, a lot better than I did at Hogwarts. For starters, you selected a job that wasn’t connected to anything you could do to improve your reputation. You didn’t wait for your parents to sort your life out even though they were the cause of most of your problems. You found something that you were passionate about and that’s really admirable. I’ve heard good things about you from Professor McGonagall and you know she doesn’t mince words.”
Draco rubs soothing circles against Teddy’s back. “I know, Teddy. It’s not your fault at all. We’ll have a proper burial for him, okay?”
“Yes. Are you going to use magic to cook?”
Harry turns to look at her with his mouth open in shock. If Harry had to guess who the first person to figure out that he had a bit of a crush on Malfoy would be, he would have chosen Hermione.
“Yeah, but he feels guilty.”
“Cut it out with the ‘Potter’ thing. My name is Harry.”
“No,” Dudley says, “he’s my cousin.”
“Shit,” Harry says, not quite believing what Andromeda is saying to him.
It’s eleven in the morning, so Harry’s not surprised that Draco is not at home. In fact, he had counted on that fact so that he could surprise Draco, to make up for the time he could not Floo call him. As Harry adds more shampoo to his hair, he thinks about what he would do after he wakes up from a much-needed nap. He would cook dinner, open a ridiculously vintage wine that Draco swore only to use on special occasions, and, if Harry’s lucky, then he might be able to tempt Draco in staying in bed all night.
Whenever Harry had first started talking to him as they were finishing their cases, Draco had been surprised. Yes, they worked well together, but that didn’t mean they had to be social.
Malfoy rolls his eyes. “Oh, don’t flatter yourself, Potter, even though you
Pansy shakes her head. “I arrived yesterday from Paris, but I haven’t seen Draco since our brunch last Wednesday.”
That explained why Harry wasn’t home when Draco arrived a few hours earlier. Harry was injured on the job and it was serious enough to warrant him admittance to St Mungo’s. “Is there anything I can do? If you’re hungry, Harry, I can make you sandwich. I’m afraid there’s not much else.”
Harry shakes his head. “He’s never mentioned it. I don’t even know if Howlers can travel long distances without losing their magic. Can they, Hermione?” Harry asks her as she joins their table.
Draco holds up the white rabbit’s foot. “Care to explain?”
Harry shrugs his shoulders. “Mostly curiosity. I mean, he doesn’t know where I live, but the letter somehow made its way to our doorstep and it’s not cursed in any way.”
Draco had expected to find Grimmauld Place bursting with light, the delicious aroma of sugar biscuits wafting from the kitchen, and at the very least, Celestina Warbeck playing on the Wireless. It was the first of December, the very earliest that Draco would let Harry decorate for Christmas, and Harry had insisted he would take the day off to take full advantage of it.
“Oh, thank fuck,” Harry says. “I was worried all this time about asking you if you wanted to go public with our relationship. I figured I would start out small and invite you to dinner at the Burrow.”
Harry thanks her and closes the door behind them, levitating the box into the kitchen. Now faced with an empty flat, all Harry can think about are Teddy’s words and how he could bring this up to Draco without it becoming an argument.
After starting a fire in the fireplace, Harry sat across from Draco. He grinned and said, “Where do you want to start?”
“Please let me finish. I didn’t realise how important you had become to me until you left for Montreal and I was stuck at Grimmauld Place by myself. I missed your company more than I ever thought possible. When I saw the newspaper yesterday morning and how it affected me more than I thought it would. It’s the reason I wound up in St Mungo’s after all.”
“Yes I am. I promised, remember?” Harry replies.
“Liar,” Harry immediately replies. “Have they finally warmed up to you?”
. I’ve never heard you speak like that about someone.”
Draco pushes past his nerves, clearing his throat as he manages to say, “I did, yes, but I’ve changed my mind.”
Harry stood, but then bent down to hug her tightly. “Thank you for understanding.”
, ever since Hogwarts. Pansy, what is this all about?”
It doesn’t take long to realise that Harry is laughing. “Oh, Draco,” Harry says, trying to breathe. “You scared me. I thought something serious had happened and the Ministry was in our living room ready to Obliviate Daisy.”
“I’m glad that you do because I know it shows that you care,” Draco says, lifting Harry’s chin up. Harry’s green eyes stare at him with love that he’d never thought he’d find. While Harry may have been denied love while he was a child, Draco intends to make sure that Harry never forgets how many people love him now.
“No, he’s in heaven now. He’s with your parents. They’ll take care of him for you.”
“You were pardoned. Besides, you’re a Healer now. You’re a hero to all of your patients.”
Draco doesn’t say anything.
“Please,” Pansy says. “Remember, Draco, you are still trying to look your best even whilst wearing this.”
them to get rid of the lice.”
Draco’s removes his hands and Harry groans at the loss of pleasure. “Excuse me? Do you care to repeat that?” Draco says, his voice dangerously low. “You better not be asking for an open relationship.”
“I promised to do that when I married you,” Draco says, grasping Harry’s hand. “I haven’t regretted it yet.”
you?” His laughter quickly died when Harry didn’t join in.
“What is this shit?” He glances at the byline and lets out a groan of frustration. “I knew only Rita Skeeter would sink so low as to write this! Her words are worthless.”
Draco
Luckily, he doesn’t encounter any distractions or troublesome students on his way to the Great Hall. It’s more than half-full, with students catching up with friends back from Christmas hols.
“He was consulting on a case on Valentine’s Day and I was helping to finish a report. Someone had sent him roses and he Vanished them and then asked me to help sterilise his lab.” Harry smiles. “I think that was the first time I realised I had a bit of a crush.”
Falling in love with Harry had come as a surprise. No one had trusted him despite Dumbledore’s assurances and therefore did not talk to him unless absolutely necessary. Draco had spent his days at Grimmauld Place brewing potions and talking to the old house-elf Kreacher, who always cooked Draco’s favourite meals.
Realistically, Harry knew that the answer was no. But there was always a tiny sliver of doubt. All he could do was shrug his shoulders.
Fifteen minutes later, Draco steps out of the shower feeling refreshed and uses his wand to dry off before stepping into Harry’s walk-in closet with his towel wrapped securely around his waist.
“Honestly, Harry. You still can’t exit a Floo gracefully? We practised and you’re making me look bad.”
Sleep does not come easy for Harry that night, but by sunrise the next morning, he has made a decision.
There’s a sigh and then a jingling of the keys as Draco pulls them out and inserts them in the door knob. He pushes the door open and waves Harry through.
the Niffler and it falls to the ground with a thud.
“Merlin, no! Why would you think that? Are you exhausted? Has all the revising done things to your mind? Should you be admitted to the Janus Thickey ward?” Harry manages to say. “The item you’re holding should help you on your exam tomorrow.”
Draco dealt in books because that was his refuge during the war. After the Dark Lord had given him that impossible task of murdering Albus Dumbledore, Draco had searched for any scrap of information in books that could help him, both legal and illegal. When the Dark Lord had resided at the Manor, Draco would take as many books from the library to hide in his bedroom under the cover of revising for exams.
This interview is not going the way Draco had planned. To be honest, he didn’t know what to expect from them and that’s why he had prepared several speeches depending on what mood they arrived with. He sits down while the Weasleys prepare tea. Harry reaches underneath the table and squeezes Draco’s hand.
Harry stares at Neville in shock. “What?”
A wave of sadness that Draco doesn’t feel comfortable at the moment is overtaken by the anger that Harry feels. As soon as Harry sees for himself that Draco is safely back home, he’s going to make sure that Rita Skeeter never picks up another quill again
“Why?”
“Why not?”
“Hurry up, Harry! Open the door!” Draco says from behind him. “These bags are heavy.” He drops one grocery bag on the ground to make a point.
. Well at least there were no reporters this time to write a scandalous story for the
A few flicks of Harry’s wand had both the lights and fire extinguished. At first nothing happened, but then the fairy lights slowly twinkled and the ornaments sparkled, and then a light dusting of snow began to fall down onto the branches. Draco was even tempted to snatch a Snitch that was buzzing right in front of him. They stood there for several minutes admiring the tree.
Draco’s fingers accidentally press a button as he’s browsing and he lifts up a yellow jumper with angels on the front that sing. To his surprise, Pansy decides to buy it because, as she put it, “wouldn’t it be wonderful if I could change it to play Celestina Warbeck greatest hits?” He doesn’t have the heart to tell her no, that hearing her songs on repeat would become tiresome very soon.
“You can continue screaming, if you like, but it won’t to you any good. I’ve put up several spells so that no one can disturb us.”
“You do it so well and she has no complaints. I bet you’ll be the best big brother anyone could ever hope for.”
“About time you arrived, Vernon,” a voice greets him.
In the end, he chooses comfort over style, picking up a pair of Harry’s joggers. He browses through all the shirts Harry has hanging, hoping to find the Slytherin t-shirt he had given Harry for his birthday.
“There’s someone waiting for you back home, isn’t there?” Although it was asked as a question, Hermione didn’t have to wait for a response to know that it was true.
“No,” Harry replies, looking down at Teddy’s worried face. He hair has turned brown and he has his hands deep in his pockets. “I’m not angry. How can I be angry at something that is not your fault?”
“Julia insisted we take her to her paediatrician to have a physical because she wanted to make sure that Daisy had a clean bill of health. The doctor told us that her results were all normal and that nothing was wrong with Daisy. Julia convinced me to write you a letter and then to wait and see what you recommend.”
Draco scoffs. “How dare you!” Okay, he might be a little tipsy from the wine. “I would never give you a faulty present. Just take a bite, you’ll see.”
Draco had jolted back in shock. He had felt panic build in his chest as he watched Harry Potter dying right before his eyes. Without thinking, Draco had grabbed his wand from its holster, but Granger interrupted him.
“What is it?” Draco asks, tapping on the glass.
“Barely. They tolerate me because their mother threatened to have their bollocks if they weren’t nice to
“So you haven’t seen the paper?”
There’s only a few families that statement would apply to and as far as Neville knows, Harry is not friends with anyone whose family is part of the Sacred Twenty-Eight. Instead of a barrage of questions that Harry expects from all of his other friends, Neville just snorts. “Never figured you’d date a posh person, but good for you, Harry.”
“Better?” Draco asks.
“I’m still waiting for that dance you promised me.”
Draco opened his mouth to protest that he was simply curious about the films, but Harry cut him off.
Draco pushed the box of snow aside and opened another. Inside he found a Santa Claus figurine, a plastic snowman with a carrot nose, and stockings that were made of thick wool and had a letter stitched on.
After the war, he continued to hide behind books. Harry had managed to spare him from Azkaban, but he still had to figure out what he was going to do for the rest of his life. Draco was fortunate that the Manor remained and that he still had a small fortune to live comfortably. His parents were alive, but had decided to take a permanent holiday in Italy rather than stay in England. Nothing was gone, really, except for his reputation. So he had to work, or he would go mad.
The blond man slowly turns around and he's nothing like Vernon has ever seen before. Vernon understands why the barista was flirting with this man, someone who is handsome enough to charm all the people around him. The blond man’s pale eyebrow is arched into a precise point judging him, his pale pink lips are smirking at him, and his grey eyes are wide in amusement. His dark blue suit screams money, and power, and high society. Vernon won’t admit it, but he feels inadequate standing next to this man.
“Why?” Draco asks. “I wouldn’t have said no, Harry, even though I might regret it later. I know how important family is to you.”
“I already opened my birthday gifts, Harry,” Draco says, his grey eyes confused. “You got me tickets for a trip to Santorini.”
“No. Let me ask you several questions that might be on the exam tomorrow. If you get them right, then I’ll choose what you do for the rest of the evening.”
Daisy gives him a strange look. “Do you mean to tell me that you haven’t heard of calculus?”
As much had he had enjoyed it in the moment, he had regretted it ever since. It made him sick and uneasy that he could twist’s Harry’s friendship for his own personal use. His disgust only grew when he read the
Harry’s so lost in his thoughts that he doesn’t notice Hermione asking him a question until she taps him on the shoulder. Harry looks up, hoping that he doesn’t look as confused as he feels. “I’m sorry, what?”
“I’m happy for you, Harry,” Neville says, clapping him on the shoulders. “How did you find out he’s allergic to roses?”
Harry changed into white shirt and layered it with Sirius’ leather jacket. The shirt was tight against his chest, but he ignored it in favour of trying to tame his messy hair. Checking his reflection in the mirror, Harry smiled at himself before sitting down at the desk in his room.
There is no use in denying it, not when he knows that this will make Harry very happy. When he nods, Harry kisses Draco, leaving him breathless.
Harry’s shoulders sag and he lets out a breath he hadn’t realised he had been holding in. “No one, Ginny,” he says at last and tries to give her the bouquet, but Ginny refuses.
“Believe me, I was surprised, too,” Harry replies, glad that it’s a hot day and the heat in his cheeks can easily be explained away.
Harry can’t listen to this anymore. He barges into the room and immediately Draco stands up with his wand drawn, a reaction ingrained in him from the war. He’s standing with his back ramrod straight, but his wand shakes ever so slightly. His eyes go wide as he looks at Harry and he retreats until he hits the wall. Harry can see that he’s thinking about Disapparating, so he rushes forward with a “Draco, no!”
His hands shake as he tugs off his glove and presses the answer button, eager to talk to Harry. “Hello?” Draco says, ducking under the shop’s awning to get out of the rain. “Harry?”
“I do,” Draco says simply.
“Neville, I’m not sure that’s the right plant,” Harry says delicately. He’s relieved when Neville bursts out laughing.
Daisy stares at him in horror. “You’re mad.”
“I’m surprised you didn’t hang any mistletoe,” Draco said, arranging the poinsettias. The plants were unlike anything Draco had ever seen in Herbology, but Harry had assured him that all they did was wave and dance if someone sang to them. He hadn’t demonstrated, citing his less-than-stellar singing, but his cheeks had turned slightly pink.
Daisy, however, is busy petting Sunny, giggling when he licks her hand.
’s headline:
“What is it?” Harry says, shaking the box.
Draco smirks. “As if I could forget.” He flicks his finger against Harry’s scar. “Does it work? Are you able to predict my future?”
Harry shrugs. “I may not know the answers, but you do.” He stands up and waves his wand to stack the parchment and journals neatly on the desk, before extinguishing the candles. At the door, he turns around and says, “You’re smart and you have your lucky rabbit’s foot. I think what you need is a delicious dinner, a relaxing bath, and a massage to relieve your stress. Do you agree?”
“Yes. Maybe? I don’t know.” Harry stared at her helplessly. Sometimes it was all he could think about at night. Once Harry returned, could they start out with a true relationship, with dates and introducing themselves as a couple to friends and family? Harry would like to think so, but he wasn’t so sure. He was always tempted to ask about it in the postcards he sent to Draco. At last count, it had been forty-six postcards sent in three months. But Harry cherished each and every one of them and kept them locked up to read and reflect on whenever he felt lonely.
“That sounds about right,” Harry agrees, laughing softly in his ear. “However, as much as I usually look forward to your cooking, let’s order Italian from that place around the corner.”
“Well, for the way he treated us at Hogwarts. I know Ron still has a lot of objections about us living together. I couldn’t imagine how he would react with finding out that we are…together.” Harry began to feel his stomach twist and turn as he thought of what Ron would say.
“Let me ask you a question,” Harry says. “Do you promise to tell the truth?”
His latest mission involving a group of Aurors searching through Albania for rogue neo-Death Eaters had been one of the toughest cases yet. Whenever Harry had to cast a Patronus, he had thought of the last time he had seen Draco. Draco had pushed him against their home’s front door, alternating between kissing him and casting all the protective spells he knew to keep Harry safe and return him home.
“Besides, it’s not like you haven’t seen them shag before. You were the first one to walk in on them when they were keeping their relationship a secret,” Pansy adds.
“To be honest,” Ron says, “I’m surprised Mum hasn’t come over here to start questioning you. The last thing she knew, you and Charlie were in relationship bliss!”
“What’s this?” Ron asks, gesturing at the books. He grabs one and opens it and Draco barely refrains from wincing, hoping that there are no stains on the pages. Those are his person journals and books that contains plans, if he’s successful, of earning a good honest living and not relying on the Malfoy family fortune.
He’s speechless and in that time, Draco hears the front doorbell ring. When he opens the door, Harry is standing outside. His Auror coat is thrown over his shoulder and his clothes underneath are wrinkled as if he’s been chasing after someone all day. There are no words to describe his hair, but that doesn’t matter, because Draco’s heart is still beating fast at the sight of him.
He sleep was interrupted by bits of tossing and turning and waking up because he thought he heard Harry calling out to him. The first time he had stumbled out of bed and checked, he found that Harry had locked the door with spells that a simple
“They’ve been perfect angels,” Draco says.
“You’re really coming home?” Draco asks, trying to not let hope show in his voice.
“Yuck, no! Wait, don’t open your eyes yet!” Teddy exclaims. “I bet it’s something you’ve never seen before.”
“You’re going to do great tomorrow, Draco. Stop stressing.”
With a flick of his wand, Draco sets the photo frame on Vernon’s desk on fire and disappears.
Draco hurried down the stairs. Why was it that Harry never followed any rules, even when it involved his own health?
Draco sits down at the desk, ready to pick up his quill and book and resume revising. He flips through the pages, all the while feeling Harry’s eyes on him.
“Even though it’s absolutely freezing, it’s so gorgeous out there. Have you made any breakfast?” Harry asked, pushing his way into the kitchen. Draco’s breakfast was still on his table and Harry did not ask as he began to eat. Draco let him, as Harry had probably not eaten a proper meal in over a day.
“Yes,” Harry said quietly. When Draco turned to ask him another question, he found that Harry was looking not at the Christmas tree, but at him.
Ginny laughs and laughs until there are tears streaming down her face. “Merlin, Harry, you have the strangest luck. Only you would go from breaking up with your boyfriend in the morning to being practically engaged by the end of the night. Who’s the lucky person?”
?” she shrieks as loud as a Howler. The effect is immediate and everyone in the Great Hall stops their chatter and looks over at them.
While Pansy’s lips are pressed thin at the mention of Lucius, Harry is quietly seething at the thought that Draco’s father is still trying to control his life. He doesn’t care about Lucius’ opinion of him, but as Draco’s only surviving family member, he can understand why Draco would be devastated at his own family rejecting him.
Harry feels his heart beat faster now that Malfoy is actually responding to his words instead of telling him to leave. “Yes. I regret the way I broke up with him, but not the reason why I did it.”
“Wait, why are you offering me a job?”
Draco looks over to where Harry sits nibbling on a chocolate chip biscuit. “It wasn’t so bad,” Harry says, “I just left him with a dicta-quill after I requested it.”
Draco’s cheeks heat, but he’s spared from answering when a child runs by wearing a Santa hat. He looks over the customer’s head to find the Christmas section located in the back of the shop. He walks towards it, with Pansy following him.
“I’m fine,” Harry had told her and it holds true now. Taking a deep breath, Harry pushes the white gate door open and walks through to the front door. The garden is lovely; it’s filled with roses, sunflowers, poppies, and lilies and holds a bird bath at the center. It’s much nicer than his Aunt Petunia’s. When Harry presses the doorbell, a dog begins to bark.
The door to Teddy’s room is open and a cursory glance confirms that he’s not there. Draco casts a quick
Harry shook his head. “You don’t have to do that.”
He already has Harry’s friendship, and, if he’s telling the truth, his affection. Hopefully the other two meanings will come true with time.
“I love you, Harry,” Draco says, kissing him deeply. They only pull away when the smell of burnt spices sets off an alarm.
“Who are you?” the girl asks.
“We should find one for you, Pansy.” Draco reaches for a black jumper, Pansy’s preferred colour for clothes because it coordinates with everything. On the front is a fluffy, white sheep with fairy lights wrapped around the body. The phrase
Draco had placed a Stasis charm on the food and had come over to Harry. He helped him up and then used his wand to spell away the Floo powder, smoothing down the lines of his robes when he was done. Harry had stood extremely still, not breathing as he realised how close they were.
There were times Draco wished he could cast
For the past five minutes, Draco has felt Harry’s magical signature just outside his front door. When he peeks through the window, he sees Harry talking to himself, holding both of his hands behind his back.
“Draco?” Harry says from behind them, his voice coming out shaky.
If possible, Vernon’s face turns even whiter. “He’s alive?”
Harry cautiously takes a small bite, his eyes widening when part of the Snitch melts in his mouth.
to the front with a tailoring charm. It’s probably quicker to use one of his own jumpers, but he’s not willing to part with his cashmere ones.
“Come on, Pansy, it doesn’t hurt to look,” he says, walking over to the front door and pulling it open. “Perhaps there are better ones available.”
Another dolphin Patronus darts into the room, interrupting Draco’s thoughts, but he Silences it before it can speak. He doesn’t want to leave the warm bed, but Pansy can be a right terror if she thinks Draco is ignoring her. And although he wants nothing more than to share his secret, he misses her, too. So he settles for kissing Harry one last time before slipping out of bed and casting an
He looks up from the letter to find all three of them looking at him expectantly.
“Do you like it?” Draco asks. When Harry nods, he continues, “I saw them in Paris last month when I visited Pansy. I thought it would be perfect for you.”
“And where do you think they would go? Straight towards the person casting the spell.”
“Get away from the rattlesnake and cover the wound with a clean bandage. Call the local emergency number and get an antivenin shot as soon as possible. If you’re a wizard, just take a potion that will remove all traces of the venom. I believe that Professor Snape would have had a better chance of survival if he had had the potion on hand when he was attacked by Nagini.”
Harry shrugs. “Perhaps. Now show me how to fix a bird’s broken wing.” Harry conjures a stuffed bird to which Draco folds the broken wing against the bird’s body and wraps vet tape around the wing making sure it’s secure.
’d a book from his messenger bag and handed it to Harry, his fingers trembling a little as he waited for Harry’s reaction.
“Don’t be an idiot. We are no longer students at Hogwarts,” Draco said. “Look, I know that I don’t have any right to be, but I was worried when I arrived from Montreal and you were nowhere to be found. At least I tell you when I’ll be gone.”
“I don’t think that Ron and I, well, we talked about it and I don’t think we are going back anytime soon,” Hermione said, interrupting him from his thoughts.
As soon as Draco regained his balance after arriving by Portkey, he frowned. He turned around to see if the Portkey had accidentally deposited him in a different location, but no, there were framed photographs of Harry and his friends on the fireplace mantle.
“He’s still in the house, Harry,” Draco says, placing a hand on Harry’s shoulders. If Teddy is in trouble, he’ll need to be able to think clearly. “He probably just woke up and is hungry. If anything, he might have hurt himself in the kitchen trying to get breakfast.”
“Draco,
Harry nods. “My friends and family couldn’t understand how I could ever become friends with Draco, much less date him. To be honest, sometimes I think that they think that Draco is just a placeholder until I find someone else.” Harry runs a hand through his hair and sighs. When his eyes meet Pansy, he surprises her with the intensity of his gaze. “It’s never going to happen. The truth is, he’s very different from the spoilt boy at Hogwarts, more honest and vulnerable and I’m so honoured that he feels comfortable to show me that side of him. I learn something new about him every day and hope to continue for the rest of our lives.”
“What--Harry?” Draco asks, dropping his wand when he realises what it is.
Harry scoffs. “No, he’s the one who helped me. I was a mess after the war, directionless and ready to leave my friends and family behind. I had even gone to Andromeda to apologise for not being a good godfather. My initial anger when first seeing Draco with Teddy faded when I saw how good he was to him. If someone who had seen the worst of the war could be that gentle and caring with a child, then there was hope for me yet.”
“Please don’t leave me again,” Draco says, struggling to sit up.
“Where did you find this?” Draco asks.
Draco has just walked into the kitchen with a peculiar look on his face. “I found this outside on the doormat. It’s for you.” He holds out an envelope and Harry takes it.
to refill his glass. He offers to do the same for Charlie, but the other man declines. Harry and Charlie stare at each other and Harry spots minor differences since the last time they saw each other. His hair is longer, there’s a new tattoo on his wrist, and there are more scars on his face. Most of the scars are faint, but there is a fresh one underneath his left earlobe.
“Why is Draco wearing Weasley’s tie? Is this a joke?” Pansy demands, waving the Gryffindor tie in Harry’s face. Draco would have been amused by the look on her face if it weren’t for the fact that she’s pulling it a bit too hard and he struggles to breathe.
“Why not ask Granger and Weasley?”
,” Draco interrupts, taking a sip of tea. If his hands shake a bit, no one dares to mention it.
He quickly tells her what happened, and by the time he has finished, she can’t stop laughing. “If I didn’t know any better, I’d think those cats had planned it all along. They really do hate you.”
’d. There was none. A little bit of panic began to set in. Draco had half a mind to Firecall Ron no matter that it was still early and he was probably still asleep.
“Harry, I’m sorry about the newspaper.”
“What’s wrong with him?” Draco asked before he could stop himself.
“Why do you think Daisy is a witch?”
“Draco,” Harry says, “sorry I’m a bit early, but I couldn’t wait. Can I come in?”
He made it all the way to the living room before there was loud banging on the front door. He slowly approached the door, wand out in his hand, and peered through the eye hole. All he could see was green, but he did recognise the voice that said, “Open up, Draco!”
“Potter,” Draco warns. Draco only says the surname when he’s annoyed. “Did you bring me a dead animal? Not even I can bring back the dead. That’s more of your specialty, remember?” Draco has only said the most outrageous thing to cross his mind, but judging from the silence, Draco thinks he’s close to the truth.
Charlies finally turns away from the window to look at Harry. There’s no judgment in his expression, but it still causes Harry to have difficulty swallowing water past the lump that has formed in his throat.
“Sorry about the tie. Mrs Weasley was kind enough to darn our clothing over the hols, but it must have gotten mixed up when we were packing,” he quietly says to Draco. “Otherwise, I don’t care that you want to wear my clothing. What’s mine is yours, truly.”
The peacock and egg lay on the ground, forgotten, as the two men continue to kiss for a very long time.
To Draco’s knowledge, he hasn’t seen anyone in the wizarding world wear anything similar to these. Judging by Pansy’s incredulous expression, she hasn’t either.
Draco watches as Harry covers the hole in the balloon with his mouth and inhales deeply. His cheeks are puffed out, making him look like a chipmunk, and that finally startles Draco into laughter.
Draco closes his eyes and bites the inside of his cheeks to keep from pushing Harry against a door and snogging him senseless. Sometimes Harry did innocent things without realizing how it affected Draco and now is not a good time to start dwelling on taking Harry to bed.
Harry finds Draco in their bedroom, sitting on the edge of the bed. He has a silk bed sheet wrapped around his body, with only his head peeking out. Even though Harry is nude, Draco seems the most vulnerable at the moment. Harry watches him, trying to choose the words that will cause no more miscommunication.
“How so?” Draco grudgingly asks.
If Harry heard Draco speak at all, he didn’t acknowledge it.
“So, you can’t help me?” Daisy asks, her eyes wide.
Harry took a sip of his cold tea and sighed. “Nothing. Everyone thinks that I’m heartbroken. I’m really not. Nick is nice. Boring, but nice and predictable. After the life I’ve had, maybe that should be enough. But it’s not.”
Harry laughed, but it was a strangled noise.
“So you actually were knitting this for me, right? For a Christmas present?” Draco asks. The jumper is so soft, made of thick wool that’s perfect for a cold winter’s day. Or at least it would have been if it hadn’t been dragged around Harry’s flat.
His old self-preservation instinct kicked back in and he tugged his hand away from Harry’s grip and stood up. “It would have never worked, Harry. Your friends don’t even like me and you value their opinion,” Draco said. “We’re too different.”
and sees that what broke off is a single gold band.
“No, let me finish. You have been nothing but civil since I came here. Then last night, when you wouldn’t even look at me, it had me thinking what I could have done to warrant such a reaction. Then I saw the
Draco didn’t answer Ron’s questions as he was too focused on Harry who was still on the ground and was clutching at the sling. “That does not look fine,” Draco said, “what happened, Harry?”
She nods eagerly. “Go ahead!”
Pansy fiercely hugs Draco and whispers, “Darling, you have me and Blaise and Greg, but most of all you have Harry. You’ll never be truly alone.”
“Draco, you must know that all of this are lies. Your trial is public record and anyone can view your testimony to know how you didn’t have a choice in your role during the war,” Pansy says, rubbing circles on Draco’s back.
“Okay, I believe you. And I do want to help,” Harry says. “Most magic is harmless, especially if coming from a child. Draco and I can come over and help her, if you’d like. Or I have a friend, Hermione, who’s brilliant and knows practically everything. If anyone can help you, it’s her.”
Unbidden, Ron’s words the day he had told Harry he was retiring from the Auror force come to mind. “I don’t know, Harry,” he had said, rubbing the back of his neck, “there are always going to be criminals in the world, there’s no denying that. But do I really want to keep doing this for the rest of my life, when I’ve already spent so much of it fighting? I have Hermione and my children, the people whom I love most in the world and bring me peace, waiting for me at home. I’d be a fool to give that up.”
Draco’s grey eyes flash in anger. “He is not a
“Of course they can. The Howlers are attached to owls which are known to deliver the post internationally. Although they do need a few days to recover after each visit.” Hermione sits down in her chair and Ron gently takes Rose and cradles her in his arms, making sure to support her head. Hermione murmurs ‘thanks’ before she casts a Cooling Charm over their group.
“Harry, did you forget who you are talking to? I will always be introduced as former Death Eater Draco Malfoy. If anything, you should be worried about being seen with me.”
“Harry,” a voice calls out in front of him. For a second he thinks it’s Malfoy because of the blond hair, but then he smells the perfume that Luna favours and he relaxes a bit.
“The Christmas dinner is casual. You’ve seen the Weasleys. Aside from that one son who works at the Ministry, who else wears fancy clothes? If I show up in something ridiculously overpriced, they’ll get the wrong idea that I’m still that snooty pure-blood from Hogwarts.”
to protect himself as he’s amongst Muggles. All he can do is hold his grocery bags closer to his body and walk faster to Harry’s flat in Muggle London
“No, it wasn’t that,” Harry interrupts. “Besides, anytime you were here, we seemed to get along just fine with no problems at all.”
Harry shook his head. “I was distracted because of this.” Harry reached into his pocket and handed him a slip of parchment. Draco only had to see that it was from the
“Draco, what the fuck!” Pansy’s head appears in the green flames and she scowls when she sees him. “This better be important.”
“What just happened?” Daisy cries out and she grabs Draco’s hand to take a look, turning it over to see if he’s hurt.
“Has her magic ever caused any problems?” Harry asks.
“But you’re a wizard! Harry says you’re so smart and got high marks at school. I thought you knew everything.”
In the end, Harry decides that Dudley is telling the truth.
“Ginny!” Harry exclaims, and he turns around once he feels the wand leave his back. “I’m sure that by now, just about everyone has heard about it and has wondered what’s wrong with me for always breaking up with the people I date.”
“I’m still in Madrid, waiting for my Portkey, but I wanted to talk to you as soon as I could. Sorry the mission took almost a month, but it’s finally over.”
Vernon walks a little faster, bearing in mind that his doctor told him on his last visit that it’s not good for his heart to be so stressed. As soon as he sees the entrance to Grunnings, a sense of calm washes over him. He’s almost safe in his office. If Draco decides to follow him in, security can detain Draco at the door and, if Vernon’s lucky, arrest him.
“Family means everything to Harry and since you’re the only ones he has left, I thought it would be proper to ask you for his hand in marriage.”
, it’s fine. You love your job. Just come home each time… I will deal with it.”
Agreeing with Ron was something that Draco never thought he would do, but there was always a first time for everything. “I second that. Harry, as a Gryffindor, you wear your emotions on your sleeve. It’s an unfortunate trait, but in the months that I have been saying here, you haven’t said a word. You’ve been in a relationship with another person for longer than that. Whatever you feel for me is simply not real.”
Harry shakes his head. “Of course not. I’m too fond of it.” He is. Draco’s hair is smooth and silky, and sometimes Draco lets it grow out long enough that Harry can wrap it around his hands and pull on it during sex. It would be a tragedy for the two of them if they had to cut it off.
“If you remember how terrible I was in potions, then you’ll know that I’m not that familiar with potions herbs and plants,” Harry says, laughing softly. “However, Neville recommended some useful ones and even left the roots attached so that you could grow your own at home, if you choose to. I know you recognise aconite, sage, yarrow, mint, thyme, feverfew, and well, dittany,” Harry says, pointing to each one as he names them.
The door burst open and Harry barged past him, struggling to drag in a tree. It must have been about seven feet tall and the scent was overbearing. Pine needles scattered all over the floor and bits of snow came into the house.
“Do you want to be next, Potter?” Malfoy says, pointing his wand at him.
“It’s not broken,” Harry says. “It’s something I made for you. It’s a combination of a portable Pensieve and a Remembrall. You store your memories here and whenever you want to see them, just cast a spell and they will show up in this crystal ball.”
Draco is at a loss for words. Meeting the Weasleys is daunting by itself, but that Harry wants him to feel comfortable in a room full of people who by all rights might hate him is incredibly touching.
“The usual,” he barks, as if they don’t already know his order, “And make it quick! Some of us have to return to our
Pansy scoffs. “No they won’t, Draco. In fact, I don’t think they’ll even look at what you’re wearing. They’ll be too polite to say anything.”
“For what?” Draco says, frowning. Harry hands him the letter and watches as Draco quickly reads it.
“Cousin?” Daisy says, frowning. “But I’ve never met him before.”
Draco immediately settles down at Harry’s side, placing his head directly over Harry’s heart. “Promise me you’re not a dream and you’ll still be here in the morning.” His words come out low and unsure, yet seem loud in the silent room.
He smirks at her. “I thought it would be nice to wear something that belongs to my boyfriend.”
“You know, a simple
“Please answer the question.”
Draco spends the rest of the walk to Harry’s thinking about their conversation. On one hand, he’s ecstatic that Harry wants to introduce him to his family. As far as Draco knows, Harry’s never introduced any of his former partners. On the other hand, he’s a Malfoy, whose family has been feuding with the Weasleys for a long time.
So for the past hour, he has been silently sitting at the table, watching Daisy scribble on several pages as he thinks of something to say. Harry is not due home anytime soon and Draco is tempted to Floo call Hermione to come for a visit if things don’t change.
Harry winces at the suggestion. He knows she’s correct, but he’s not looking forward to it.
“You should have seen his face when he was trying to hide his disappointment. I feel like I should make it up to him. You know, the reason he was knitting that jumper is because he wants to introduce me to the Weasleys.”
Draco is sitting behind his desk, holding a framed photo. He puts it down and raises an eyebrow. “Normally, I’d be polite and say you have a lovely family, but that would be a lie.”
“Good morning, Draco,” Harry says, tucking stray strands of hair behind Draco’s ear before kissing him. Draco forgets about everyone in the Great Hall, too lost in the gentle pressure of Harry’s lips against his. When he pulls away, Harry nods to Pansy before grabbing a plate and serving himself breakfast.
“I agree! These are very delicious,” Harry says, biting into a chocolate éclair. He moans and begins to lick the excess cream off of his fingers.
Draco looks over his shoulder to see if there’s a caroler following him to ask for donations. He does not have any more Muggle money and even Muggles would notice if he drops large gold Galleons into their bucket.
? I don’t understand why--”
Immediately, he freezes. Vernon swears that in that moment, those grey eyes are seeing right through him, reading his mind and looking at all the thoughts he’s ever had.
Harry says it so nonchalantly, but talking to Professor Snape’s portrait is always hard on both of them. There are so many memories, both good and bad, from the war that come up whenever they visit Hogwarts and speak to the portraits. For Harry to have done that for him is an act of kindness that Draco doesn’t even know how to begin to repay.
As Vernon walks the last two flights of stairs, he thinks angrily about whom he will call and yell at to fix the bloody lift.
“Uncle Harry says you might have the flu.”
“You know, for what it’s worth, Teddy says he’s sorry about giving you lice.”
“I don’t think I’ve seen such a lovely sight in quite a while, have you?” Draco asked.
“Well, how else would you explain this?” Pansy asks.
Harry mouths back and turns to find Dudley staring at him. “Sorry, he still isn’t used to being around Muggles.”
Harry’s heart beats wildly and guilt spreads throughout his body. Draco has never mentioned this out loud, but perhaps the wine has loosened his tongue tonight, almost as if he has swallowed Veritaserum.
Being without magic has never been a problem for Harry since he grew up in the Muggle world. For Draco, it’s a bit harder. He’s not worried about breaking the Statute of Secrecy because the Dursleys know he’s a wizard. He’s more concerned about trying to find common interests with a teenager. After all, at her age, he was trying to survive a megalomaniac whilst plotting to kill his headmaster.
“Draco, you’re home! Ron said you were on assignment and I didn’t expect you to be home this early.”
Dudley Dursley is nothing like Harry remembers. For one thing, he’s wearing glasses and has turned the excess weight into muscle. For another, he’s keeping quiet, watching Harry almost as if he’s afraid of him.
They go sit down in front of the fireplace and Harry sets his bags down on the table before using his wand to add more wood to the fire.
Harry sighs. “My Aunt Petunia would never admit to anyone that her precious Ickle Dudleykins had lice. In fact, the one time my cousin had lice, she took him to the doctor’s to get a professional treatment and then threatened to sue if the neighbours ever found out. As for me, Aunt Petunia would just cut off all of my hair. It was the simplest solution, plus it had the added benefit of making my head look ridiculous.”
The first box he opened was filled with what was supposed to be fake snow, but was rather yellow and full of moth holes where the preservation spells had not held. He snorted. Why would anyone use fake snow when there was a perfectly good charm instead? Where was this supposed to go? On the carpet?
would not fix. Fine, Draco thought. He hoped Harry had a restless night as well.
Harry slowly lets out a huge breath. “Well, yeah. I want to. She’s just a child, only seven, and if she’s a witch, it’s still a long time until she gets her Hogwarts letter. Hermione says that Professor McGonagall personally delivered her letter and answered any questions her parents had. I don’t want Daisy to wait that long or cause her to be afraid of her magic because she doesn’t know what is happening.”
Harry lets out a huge breath of air. Draco loves to dance and he’s always trying to coax Harry into joining him for one dance. Which he usually doesn’t mind, but one dance leads to three, which leads to dancing the night away if Draco has his way. “Ah, I’m not sure it’s going to happen tonight. But I can make it up to you if you like?”
“I love you, Draco Malfoy,” Harry says. The words come out squeaky and high-pitched and almost sound nonsensical as Harry repeats the phrase over and over again. But as the balloon deflates, a smile spreads across Draco’s face, especially when Harry runs out of helium and speaks in his normal voice.
In the week since that kiss, Malfoy had been cordial, as if Harry’s lapse of judgement had never happened. Harry, however, had not forgotten.
Draco’s breath hitches and Harry tilts his chin up so that he can look into Draco’s eyes when he says the next words. “I want to show the world that I am still yours and you are mine. Or this time we could do a proper bonding ceremony. I was going to wait to ask until we were fifty, but then I thought, why wait?”
Harry’s cheeks turn red. “Oh, I didn’t realise we were that obvious.”
Before he can say anything else, there’s two cracks of Apparition and both George and Ron land in front of them with a briefcase in hand.
On the front page is an old photograph of Draco, taken just after the verdict from the Wizengamot that proclaimed him a free man. It’s always the same one the
Harry opens his mouth to respond, but then immediately closes it. He can’t think of anything to say that won’t make him seem heartless, and besides, all Ron did is state the truth.
“That’s one person,” Draco argued, but Harry continued as if he hadn’t interrupted.
Draco laughs. “My father, at best, will behave, and at worst, will ignore you. That shouldn’t be too much trouble.”
“Neville, are you here? I need your help,” Harry says as he enters Greenhouse Three on the Hogwarts grounds. Immediately, he is pushed back outside, falling onto the grass as the glass door slams shut. Harry looks up at the bright blue sky in shock, wincing as he feels a sharp pain in his left ankle.
“No ‘Hello, Harry. So glad you’re still alive. How are you doing?’” Harry says as he tries to normalise his breathing.
Harry looks at Malfoy, wondering what would happen next. In the past, Malfoy would have hexed all three of them without hesitation. Now, his cheeks have turned pink, but he still holds his head up high when he says, “Not that it’s any of your business, Weasley, but you’d be surprised at the offers.”
“It’s okay, Sunny!” A girl’s voice calls out. “You’re okay!” The door opens and a black Labrador jumps on Draco, trying to lick him all over his face. Right behind the dog is a brown haired girl with blue eyes exactly like Dudley’s.
At those words, a lump forms in Draco’s throat. “Thank you, Teddy,” Draco says, giving him another hug.
“What?” Draco exclaims hoarsely, clearing his throat. “You know I don’t hate Teddy. I just feel so out of my comfort zone with him and sometimes I feel like I don’t know what I’m doing. I don’t want to fuck this up because he means the world to you.”
“Still, I sent off the letter, hoping that even if Daisy wasn’t a witch, then at least I could try to mend things between us. I understand if it’s not possible.”
Harry smiles. “So I’ve been told. I have my ways.”
No. Harry had to stop those thoughts before they got out of control. Yes, they had shared one night together and what a wonderful night it had been, but there had been no promises made. In fact, Harry could arrive home and find out that Draco had found someone. It would hurt, but there was nothing he could do about it. They were not promised to each other.
The wind picks up, stinging Draco’s face and tousling up his hair. He scowls, looking around to find an empty alley to Disapparate. Before he does, he hears the faint words of the Muggle Christmas song and his heart begins to beat faster.
“Well, we did sleep together already,” he said, blushing, and he couldn’t quite look at his best friend in the eyes.
“It’s not my phone; it’s my graphing calculator. Do you want to try it?” Daisy asks.
They walk to the kitchen and through the window, Harry can see Draco and Dudley’s wife and daughter in the center of the yard. Daisy is speaking to Draco, who is kneeling down on the grass and is paying strict attention to Daisy, despite Sunny trying to lick his face again. In his hands he holds a plastic bottle filled with a clear liquid. If Harry remembers correctly, the liquid is vinegar and when mixed with bicarbonate of soda, will cause the rocket to launch into the air.
“Draco what are you doing?” Pansy says, crossing her arms and beginning to shiver. Their Heating Charms faded in the cab and they couldn’t renew them in front of the Muggles.
Draco raises an eyebrow. “How?”
“How long have you been together?” Dudley asks, breaking Harry away from his thoughts.
“Like the constellation?” she asks excitedly. “Mum is teaching me to find them, but they all look the same to me.”
Draco is shocked; he never expected an outright offer.
“What for?” Harry asks.
Draco raises an eyebrow.
Pansy follows him, examining the first table they come across with a raised eyebrow. It’s filled with tourist trinkets: shot glasses, small stuffed bears, postcards with the Muggle queen, t-shirts, ceramic plates, photo frames and, surprisingly, socks.
“Shut up,” Harry says, trying not to laugh. “Go on, then, crack it open.”
“Thank you, Pansy,” Draco says, his voice suddenly hoarse. “I’ll meet you at the coffee shop near Harry’s flat in thirty minutes.”
“No, Pansy,” Draco says. He avoids meeting her eyes when he says, “I fucked up.”
“I would like for you to spend Christmas with me at the Weasleys. I want to introduce you as my boyfriend.”
Harry doesn’t fall to his knees; instead he hugs Draco around the waist and says, “As happy as you are right now, that’s how I want to make you feel for the rest of our lives. I love you, Draco Malfoy. Marry me?”
“Would you like some dinner?” Draco asks.
“Is this Arithmancy?” he asks, “Or perhaps a riddle?”
Imperio
Draco thinks about it, but he can’t always remember all of Blaise’s mother’s husbands, especially when they die so suddenly. “It could be,” he concedes, as Mrs Zabini does enjoy the finer things in life. Everything at Harrods is obscenely overpriced. Even a simple cotton shirt from there could cost a small fortune, which makes it the worst place to find a simple jumper, Draco realises.
Relief washes over Harry as he closes the distance between them and kisses him, kisses away the tears that finally spill. The box falls to the floor, ignored for the moment as they both become lost in their own world. To Harry, nothing says home more than being in the arms of someone he loves and he will stop at nothing to make sure Draco feels the same.
“Thank you,” Harry says. “It got a bit overwhelming.” He tries to give the sunflower bouquet to her. “Here. I think the dove was a little misguided and made a mistake,” he begins but Luna shakes her head.
“What? That was three weeks ago.” Harry was single. This was something that Draco had never dared to hope happen. “Impossible. What did he do?”
“Nice to meet you, Harry,” Julia says as she shakes his hand. “I’m sure you have a lot of catching up to do with your cousin. Draco, if you don’t mind, let’s go outside. I think Daisy wants to show us her science experiment.”
The next morning, Draco wakes up curled up against Harry’s side. He slowly untangles their arms and legs, careful not to wake him up. Dark, unruly hair peeks out from under the thick quilt that Molly had given to him as a housewarming gift. Other than Harry’s soft snores, the room is quiet. Draco smoothes Harry’s hair back, kissing him on the cheek, and slips out of bed.
When Draco opens his eyes, he sees Harry at the hob stirring spices into the pot. The new Weird Sisters song is playing on the Wireless and Harry sways his hips and sings along, slightly off-key. Here is proof that there is no way in hell Harry can be related to a family such as the Dursleys.
“You’re just like Harry, drinking pure sugar and calling it coffee,” Draco says, amused. He takes a sip of his black coffee and sighs, feeling the drink warm his body.
Dudley turns pale. “I’m sorry.”
Draco should have been embarrassed that Harry had taken notice of what he had thought had been discrete outings, but he was distracted by the hurtful reaction he felt hearing Harry say those words.
Draco couldn’t resist rolling his eyes.
Harry scans the crowd inside the restaurant, searching for his boyfriend’s blond head. Like the three previous times that Harry has checked, Draco is nowhere to be seen. With a sigh, Harry takes a sip of his drink and glances at his wristwatch. Draco is officially an hour late.
“Afraid? Why would she be afraid?” Draco asks, confused.
“It’s true,” Harry exclaims. When Malfoy doesn’t respond, Harry continues speaking in hopes of changing his mind. “We get along better now. He’s smart, charming, and would do anything for his friends, including bringing some murderous albino peacocks to a wedding.”
Teddy nods and hugs him. “I hope Cousin Draco gets better.”
“I was wondering how you would feel about spending Christmas at the Burrow this year?” Harry asks
A soft cough shakes him out of his thoughts. And even though there are people walking all around him, Vernon knows it’s the bloke from the coffee shop.
Daisy nods, sighing deeply. “I’m having a little bit of trouble with my homework. We had a supply teacher today, which was no help at all since he didn’t know anything about teaching calculus. He just let us watch a film and sent us home with this worksheet.”
“I don’t know. It’s been almost ten years since the war ended, but I wouldn’t be surprised if people believed you did it under Voldemort’s orders.” Harry was breathing hard and he tugged down at the sleeves of the ghastly Weasley jumper he wore. “They’ve believed worse and there was nothing I could do or say to convince them otherwise. If you haven’t noticed, I can’t exactly go around and
Draco, however, doesn’t feel cold. Excitement builds up in his chest as he points to the window shop. “Look at this, Pansy, and tell me what you think. Look at what they’re wearing.”
Pansy frowns, as she doesn’t enjoy travelling by car. “Let me take you to Paris, Draco. You can’t go wrong with the fashion in Paris,” Pansy says excitedly.
He was a book restorer of sorts, nothing as glamourous or heroic as Harry, who had not bothered to return to Hogwarts. Instead, he and Ron Weasley had gone straight into Auror training where they had quickly risen in the ranks. In the early days, the
“Because Muggles have been dealing with it since the beginning of time. It’s practically a rite of passage. Didn’t the healers at St Mungo’s treat you? I’m sure their treatment is much more effective than the Muggle way.”
“You were injured because of me?” Draco asked unable to stop the question from slipping out of his mouth.
doesn’t make sense to him, but that only motivates him to look for something better. He doesn’t want to risk wearing it and then find out that electricity and the magic at the Burrow are an unstable combination and end up at St Mungo’s as a patient.
No sooner had the question been asked when they hear a man call out, “Daisy, where are you?”
Teddy is standing on a footstool in front of their aquarium. A jar of fish food has spilled on the floor and Teddy is standing there with tears running down his face, gasping for breath, hands pressed against the glass.
One mannequin wears a pale blue jumper with a white silhouetted reindeer that has
By the time Draco arrives at Harry’s flat, he is completely soaked. Harry’s front door is painted bright red with a huge, handmade wreath with a lion’s head hanging on it. It’s a housewarming gift from Luna. The first time Draco had seen it, he had rolled his eyes. It was worse when Harry had tapped the lion’s nose with his wand and an instrumental version of “Weasley is Our King” had played along with synchronised flashing fairy lights. He has gotten used to the garish sight, but now wonders if he can add a snake to the wreath.
“I know, Pansy. I don’t know how they will react to finding out I’m dating their adoptive son. The feud between our families is deep, even if you don’t include being on the wrong side of the war. That’s why I need everything to be perfect, even if it’s as simple as finding a jumper to wear to their Christmas dinner. So will you help me?”
Draco won’t admit it, but he’s nervous. He brushes imaginary lint off of his new robes, smoothing down an already crisp white shirt. For good measure, he uses his wand to polish his dragon hide boots. He’s even slicked his hair back with too much gel and hair potions. He needs this interview to go well.
“That better not be a joke, Potter. I am literal perfection. No artist could ever come close to capturing what I look like,” Draco says, crossing his arms against his chest.
“The thing is, everyone is curious to know why, but they won’t outright ask you because we’re at Luna’s wedding and they don’t want to be rude. However, I figured since I’m your best friend, you could tell me anything,” Ron says, grabbing a floating plate containing a slice of wedding cake. He doesn’t wait for Harry to answer as he digs into the slice, spearing the fruit onto his fork. It really is a masterpiece, fruits and nuts cut up in the shape of magical creatures and judging from the groans and soft sighs coming from Ron, it tastes just as delicious as it looks.
. After that, Draco had not dared to try touching the presents for fear of risking an unexpected hair colour change.
“Well, I don’t think that Draco will see it that way.”
“Well, yes,” Harry said, “I think Australia is wonderful, but just for a visit.”
“How did you manage that?”
“Why do you need a present? If I remember correctly, you got everything you asked for on your birthday a month ago.” Harry smiles at the memory, one he still uses to conjure a Patronus. Harry had asked Draco to move in with him because he wanted to wake up and not worry that Draco wouldn’t be there in the morning. Draco had smiled and said, “Took you long enough, Harry,” before giving him the best blow jobs of his life.
Draco was shit at cooking, no matter how hard he tried to think otherwise. When Draco had first admitted that he didn’t know how to cook, Harry didn’t ridicule him, but rather showed him how to make simple meals. Harry was the cook in this household; Draco was mostly there to supervise and sample because he had a refined palate.
Harry spins around and gives him the biggest smile anyone has ever directed at Draco since the war’s end. Draco’s breath catches and he can only stare at Harry as he heart beats rapidly, almost trying to escape his chest. He licks his dry lips and feels Harry’s gaze following the movement.
Vernon can’t look away; deep down he knows that something terrible will happen if he breaks eye contact. However, instead of seeing Draco’s grey eyes, images flash in Vernon’s head, but nothing he can actually focus on. His heart beats faster, and little beads of sweat begin to dot his forehead, which Vernon wipes away with a shaky hand. A full minute into the staring contest and he’s gasping, taking huge gulps of breath, but it doesn’t seem to be working because he can’t breathe, and the oxygen can’t get to his brain, and black dots are appearing in his vision…
Harry takes a hard look at Dudley, who’s never been that good of an actor. His eyes are wide and his hands are clenched in fists that show off his white knuckles. His cheeks are red and he’s breathing heavily, opening and closing his mouth several times as if he’s figuring out what to say.
“Welcome to the best job you’ll ever have in your life, ferret!” Ron says, laughing.
“Who brings a Niffler to a wedding?” Harry says, continuing to stare at the baby Niffler until it leaps from the suitcase. It lands on Harry’s jacket, tugging on the gold dusted sunflower in his front pocket. Both the flower and Niffler fall to the ground and it only takes a second before the Niffler is on its tiny feet running out the door.
“I realised that I couldn’t imagine a long-term relationship with Nick and it wasn’t fair to either one of us to stay.” Harry rubbed at his eyes. “The biggest reason we split is because there was someone on my mind whom I thought I could work up the courage to ask out, but I always thought that he couldn’t feel the same way.”
“I thought you would have returned to your job as soon as possible,” Draco said, sitting down and unpacking the box of decorations. He watched Harry struggle with the tree, trying to drag it next to the window, the branches seeming to smack Harry the entire time he moved. Draco finally gave in and levitated the tree to the correct spot.
s it. “I love you. And nothing in the
“Where’s Draco?” she asks, kissing him on both cheeks. Harry tries not to choke on the cigarette smoke, but fails as Pansy rolls her eyes and flicks her wand to clear the air.
Several times, Harry reaches out to knock, only to drop his hand at the last second.
Draco reaches up and touches his hair, swatting Harry’s hands away. “Don’t you dare, Potter.”
“It could be, if you let it, Harry. You’re more alike than you realise. You’re both stubborn, refuse to back down from what you believe in, and are both loyal to friends and family. You are suited for each other and I would say he thinks the same about you.” Luna goes around to Harry’s side and kisses him on the cheek. “Thank you again, Harry.”
Teddy knocks on the door. “Draco, are you in there? I have a surprise for you.”
Ron whispered something to Harry, who nodded, and then they their way slowly out of the room. When they passed the table where all the ornaments were laid out, Harry faltered in his steps and Ron had to reach out to steady him. Draco held his breath wondering what Harry would say to that, but Harry only schooled his features into a blank stare.
“I could never forget one of the happiest days of my life,” Harry says. At those words, Draco’s expression softens. “However, I didn’t get you a ring.” Harry opens the black box to reveal a clear marble ball, which he then Transfigures back to full-size.
Ignoring Draco’s outstretched hand, George grabs a brownie and bites into it with a groan. “I’m starving! Sit down, Malfoy, we don’t have to go straight to business.”
, Draco thinks. He quickly dresses into the shirt and joggers before chasing Holly.
Harry strokes Draco’s hair as he thinks about why Draco is more vulnerable than usual. Perhaps it’s because it’s so close to the war’s anniversary that Draco feels this way, but Harry thinks that something needs to change if this is the way his husband reacts to his prolonged absence.
“Draco?” Harry’s voice comes from behind him and Draco quickly stands, trying to look as if everything is all right. “Did you know your hair is red-and-white striped?”
“Leaving already?” Pansy asks.
“Yes, I’m a Hit-Wizard. My specialty is bringing in Dark wizards, especially the Death Eaters still on the loose. Do you remember Voldemort?”
“You think I’ll join my father in
Harry pinches the bridge of his nose and sighs. “Let me ask you a question.”
“Then wear mine,” Harry says, undoing his Gryffindor tie and holding it out for Draco. “It’s mine, I checked. Put it on, please. I like seeing you in my clothes.”
“That hardly seems fair.”
“I take it that you agree?” Harry asks,
“That’s not true. Hermione loves the idea that you’re restoring books and preserving history. She has a few suggestions if you are interested. Ron might not like you as much, but he doesn’t hate you so that has to count for something. He wouldn’t have left you with me if he didn’t trust you.” Harry stood up and walked over until he was standing in front of Draco. “Even if they did say something, it shouldn’t matter because this relationship is just between us. I think we’d could prove them wrong if you only gave us a chance.”
“Where are we starting?”
Ron snorts. “Mate, you broke up with him this morning.”
Draco closes his eyes when he hears the question. He can’t bear to look at Harry because then he would immediately blurt out that yes, he feels the same, has done for years. Draco can’t admit to Harry that he can’t quite believe that they have become friends, even if they haven’t told anyone yet. Being friends has to be enough; Draco can’t hope for the impossible because the rejection would hurt far more than the pain of being branded with the Dark Mark.
“Okay,” Draco agrees. He really can’t resist showing off what he’s learned.
However, he has promised Harry he’d try to make Daisy feel welcomed and he is determined not to break that promise.
He sits up in bed, looking over to Harry who might be in the midst of nightmares, but Harry’s as wide awake as he is, blinking owlishly.
“Ron says you broke up with Charlie,” Hermione says. “I just wanted to know if everything turned out well.”
. He slams his office door shut after instructing his secretary not to disturb him for the rest of the day.
“Absolutely barking,” she replies, laughing softly. “But I can see why Harry loves you. You make life very interesting and I bet there’s never a dull moment,” Daisy says as she picks up her phone and dials a number.
“About four years, but I’ve known him since Hogwarts.”
. He’s one of the most powerful wizards in our world.”
The brightness of the room was a result of snow falling outside. Draco stood and walked over to the window and pressed his hands against the glass. It was beautiful outside; the world was blanketed in a winter wonderland. Draco felt a twist of excitement through his stomach. He couldn’t wait to go downstairs to tell Harry that it was finally time to start decorating for Christmas.
Perhaps it was time to leave. Draco had already finished restoring and cataloging all of the books in the library. He had a list of books that Harry could donate if he wished to do so, and the few books that he could not salvage would be sent to the Ministry for further inspection.
Harry frowns when he hears his last name. “Sure it does. Since I helped Fred and George with the startup money they made me a silent partner and that means I help with the hiring process. You really only have to win over one person since we vote on whom we hire.”
and have been co-workers with Rita Skeeter. Rolf didn’t invite any of his co-workers to the wedding and I heard she almost threw a fit. She would probably have an aneurysm if she saw Luna’s wedding dress.”
Gryffindor tie,” Draco says, and the scarlet and gold tie flies into his hands.
The cold water feels heavenly and Harry focuses on Luna’s dress as he tries to collect his thoughts. “Luna, I’m sorry,” Harry says as soon as his heart rate slows down. “You should be outside enjoying your special day, not stuck inside here with me.”
“How did you know?” he asked, breaking apart a biscuit and stuffing it into his mouth.
“It is,” Harry says. “For a minute there, I thought you wanted me to eat gold.”
After what seems like an eternity, Malfoy nods.
“Wait!” Draco exclaims. “Are you not going to ask me any questions?”
“Oh, I completely agree,” Pansy says, her eyes hard, “but what would be the point of publishing an article about Draco?”
“Harry broke his arm because he wasn’t paying attention on a raid and had to have his arm mended. He has some potions to take if any pain persists,” Ron said.
Harry’s face heats up as he avoids Neville’s gaze and rubs the back of his neck. “Well, tonight I have a date with someone whose family probably invented it and I want to impress them with a bouquet.”
Harry doesn’t know what to think. He never thought he would see the day that Dudley Dursley would ask for forgiveness. Harry only remembers the spoiled bully that thought the world belonged to him, but the letter shows that Dudley has grown up and now has a family of his own. He has a daughter who might possibly be a witch and rather than shun her, like Uncle Vernon did with Harry, Dudley wants to help her.
Harry’s cheeks turned red, but his voice was steady when he replied. “Just a broken arm, but it’s hardly the worst injury I’ve ever had. The Healers at St Mungo’s wanted to keep me overnight for observation.”
The dining room and kitchen were also empty and Draco used his wand to see if there was any note that could be
“We’ll be right with you in a moment!” A weary voice calls out from behind the counter. Draco doubts it, and decides to browse around the shop for a bit before asking for help.
“Maybe in the future, but we’re okay as it is now.”
Harry shoves his hands in his pocket to reach for the fake Galleon that connects to an identical one Draco carries with him. To his relief, the coin is not burning as it would have if Draco is in danger. He opens his mouth to tell Pansy that, but she grabs his arm and pulls him into an empty powder room.
“Then a few weeks ago, you started writing to me again. You and Malfoy were helping Luna plan her wedding.” Charlie turns away from Harry to look out the window and his voice gets quieter as he continues talking. “You know, Ron used to tease you about talking so much about Malfoy at Hogwarts. I never realised how true that was until I saw it with my own eyes. You broke up with me because of Malfoy, right?”
Draco pulls out the unravelled blue jumper from his pocket and shows it to her. “My boyfriend tried to knit me a jumper, for a tradition his family has at Christmas. However, his cats tore it apart before he could finish. So I’m here hoping to find a replacement.”
Amy brushes her hand against the fabric, frowning as a piece of yarn falls out. “What a shame for that to have happened to a thoughtful gift. Is there anything similar you have found?”
Ron shook his head. “We already got the potions at St Mungo’s. I’m just putting him to bed. He didn’t want to stay at St Mungo’s.”
“Harry, Draco, meet my wife, Julia. She’s the one who convinced me to send you a letter after I told her about first signs of, well, you know,” Dudley says, trailing off to a whisper, looking to see if Daisy has heard.
“If you like it so much, Potter, then why don’t you kiss
“I’m going to need it to keep my energy up to help you shop,” Pansy says, taking a bite of the scone.
She looks at him expectantly. “Can we order pizza?”
“I thought it was you,” Draco replies, reaching for his wand on the nightstand. A second scream rips through the silent house.
Pansy just reaches down and holds Draco’s trembling hands in hers as he continues. “Darling, that was very brave of you to stand up to your father.”
“It’s a surprise,” Harry says, standing up and offering his hand to Draco. “Do you trust me?”
Draco sighs, like it’s such a hardship for him not to be able to cook, but secretly he’s thrilled. “Fine, but only because I don’t want to spend the limited amount of time I have with you arguing.”
jabbed against the many jowls of Vernon’s chin.
“Well, a dove is just a white pigeon and we all know you are terrified of them. At least that’s what Rita Skeeter’s trusted sources are saying.”
“So there’s no tempting you to stay?”
Draco nods, stepping aside, not trusting his voice to remain steady if he were to talk. As Harry brushes past him into the living room, Draco smells the faint woodsy cologne that makes him weak in the knees. He’s pretty sure that if he were to brew Amortentia, Harry’s cologne would be one of the scents that would rise from the potion.
Draco rolls his eyes. “It’s amazing the Muggles haven’t killed each other already. How can they stand the itching? I had to have a numbing charm placed on my head just to keep myself from going insane.”
“Hello!” she says with a wide smile, trying to pull the dog back by the collar. “Sunny’s a good boy, good dog! He doesn’t bite!”
Draco holds the bird in the palm of his hand for Harry to inspect. “After this, just observe the bird for a few days until fully healed. And the last question, Potter?”
Something that Draco is currently lacking.
“Draco, you’re hurt,” Harry says, raising Draco’s hand for a closer look. The scratch across his knuckles is not deep or long, but judging by the look on Harry’s face, it might as well have been as serious as his Sectumsempra scar.
Harry smiled. “Of course. Family is important to me and I wouldn’t have offered if I didn’t agree. Now, are you ready to light the tree?”
Draco glances up at the fish tank and realises that their pet betta fish is not swimming. Mr Finny is turned sideways and floating in the water. As he bumps along the glass tank, his purple fin moves listlessly.
Harry finally glances at Neville and sees that he’s genuinely interested in what Harry has to say and does not care that he has revealed that he’s going on a date with a man.
Harry knows he can be oblivious at times, but it’s still a shock to find out how Draco has been treated by the family Harry adores. Even more distressing is the fact that Draco has not once said anything against the Weasleys for fear of possibly losing Harry.
Draco manages to say “I love you, too” before his body relaxes and he falls back to sleep.
“Teddy, tell me what’s wrong,” Harry says, embracing Teddy and gently wiping the tears away with his shirt.
“Do you think Daisy’s a freak?”
Harry cleared his throat. “I said that we broke up the day after you left for Montreal.”
“No, I didn’t say that!” Draco says quickly.
Harry doesn’t realise he has closed his eyes until he hears Draco’s voice repeating his name and  rubbing soothing circles down his back.
had written countless articles about them, until Harry had threatened to sue them for endangering the Aurors.
Cameras are flashing all over and for a minute Harry stands there, stunned. He hears a few guests whisper about him, wondering whom he’s dating. A small streak of panic starts to form in Harry’s chest and he feels as if the crowd is inching closer and closer. Even though he is with friends, Harry doesn’t want to be the center of attention and wishes he had his Invisibility Cloak with him.
“How did you get rid of them?” Draco asks, crossing his arms against his chest. “Surely you’ve had them once or twice when you were a child?”
“So that’s not the problem. Is it Nick? Do you want me to talk to him? I’ll tell him that it wasn’t you in the photograph.”
Fuck. The news was supposed to be a secret, until he could figure out a way to tell Harry that wouldn’t scare him. They had never really talked about having children, but seeing Harry with Teddy never made Draco doubt that he would be an amazing father.
“During brunch last Sunday.”
“Harry, we don’t even own any cats.”
“You won’t get away with this!”
Draco stood still. He had half a mind to just ignore Ron, but he was curious to see what really happened to Harry. “What?”
Draco was surprised when he had received a letter from Harry Potter, on the advice of Professor McGonagall, asking him to sort out Severus Snape’s library. He was going to say yes no matter what. After all, who wouldn’t want a chance to look through his former professor’s belongings, especially when he had found out it contained private journals.
“Harry?” She repeats.
Draco stares at the balloon for so long that Harry feels the need to fill the silence with anything.
“Because I hope I look at Julia the way you’re looking at him right now.”
“I can try,” Draco says at last, even though a slight bubble of panic ignites in his stomach.
“Well, now that I’m single, do you want to give us a try and go out with a date with me?”
“You did not!” Draco says, his eyes wide.
“How was I supposed to know that Muggles like to dress up their pets? The only person I know who might do that is Hagrid,” Draco says.
“Draco?” Harry asks and after a few curse words are said, Draco steps out of the closet. He addresses the house elf first, not bothering to look in Harry’s direction.
Each morning, his first cup is taken whilst reading the newspaper and frowning at any article that seems out of the ordinary. His wife, Petunia, knows not to ask what’s wrong if he rips the newspaper in frustration, eyes twitching at the utter nonsense he has just read.
Ron laughs. “I would put this above the time you and Cho kissed, which made her cry.”
Harry clears his throat, inhaling deeply to steady his nerves. “Well, here’s the thing, Neville. He’s allergic to roses.”
“You said you want to impress them, Harry?” Neville asks as they walk to Greenhouse Seven. “What do you want the roses to say?”
The pile of gifts under the tree is stacked high as Harry seems to have bought out the entire shop for his friends and family. They are wrapped in shiny, bright paper that tempts Draco into shaking the packages. The first time Harry had caught him, he had returned the gift and had cast a
charm.
I brought you a gift.”
“Muggles?” Dudley asks.
“I deserve a present because I endured seven days without knowing if you were still alive. I missed you.” Draco’s voice is quiet, but it still manages to fill Harry’s body with warmth that comes every time that Draco admits his feelings out loud. It was so different in the beginning of the relationship, when Draco would stay quiet and reserve whenever Harry would say that he loved him. However, over time, Harry had come to treasure Draco’s quiet admissions.
Pansy turns the jumper over so that Draco can read the words
“Of course you did,” Draco says quietly. Harry tries to turn around so that they can see each other properly, but Draco wraps his arms around Harry’s body, preventing him from moving.
Harry has requested that they not use magic around Daisy to make her feel more comfortable. That means Draco has to stow his wand away as he gets home from work and pretend that his fingers don’t itch to reach for his wand whenever he doesn’t know what to do.
“I don’t know. This was on my desk when I arrived at work yesterday. Robards demanded that someone examine me just to make sure that I didn’t have any dark spells placed on me.”
“And you don’t need to,” Draco says. He tries to Summon the letter, flicking his wand with such force that Harry tears the letter trying to resist the spell.
“Oh,” Harry says, scooting back on the bed until he’s against the headboard and motions for Draco to join him. Draco settles down with his head in Harry’s lap and closes his eyes.
Hermione didn’t say anything and they both looked out the window at Ron playing with Lucky. Like Harry, Ron had a deep tan and he looked relaxed in his cargo shorts and white t-shirt. He was barefoot and when he laughed, it came deep down from his belly. The haunted looked from the war had disappeared from his eyes and all that was left was a carefree expression. Harry wondered if he would ever look like that.
“Don’t worry about it, Harry. Just learn from your mistakes,” Charlie says, using his wand to cancel all the spells he cast before leaving.
As Harry had healed, he sought Draco’s company, first to thank him for saving him that night, and then just to talk. They had kept to safe topics such as their hopes and dreams for the future and not the war they were currently fighting. Draco had felt his childhood crush on Harry resurface the more they talked, until one day, shortly after Christmas, Draco had summoned the courage to kiss him.
“Yes, I broke up with him right after breakfast this morning just as he arrived via Portkey. I feel like shit about it because he had just finished kissing me and the first words out of my mouth were ‘we should break up.’” Just saying the words brings a heat of embarrassment to Harry’s cheeks, which is precisely why he didn’t want to talk about it in the first place.
Draco doesn’t speak for a very long time and Harry’s already thinking of what words to help him understand why he’s agreeing. Suddenly, Draco takes both of Harry’s hands in his and squeezes them. “I hope that when you call your cousin, you wait for an apology.”
“Well, you’re the best potions master I know and when I heard that they were looking for one, I recommended you.”
“Oh, but it’s broken. I didn’t see anything,” Draco says.
“No! We have to wait for Professor Snape!” Granger had screamed, snatching Draco’s wand away. “Ron, Floo call him at Hogwarts!”
“I know it isn’t true!” Harry interrupted, taking off his glasses to clean them. “Don’t you think that I know that you are not capable of doing that, not anymore.” Without his glasses he looked vulnerable and Draco had to squash down the urge to place a hand on his shoulder to comfort him.
“Ever plan to marry him?”
“Then what are we waiting for?” Harry asks when Pansy holds onto his arm and prevents him from moving.
“What am I to do with this?”
Harry raises his eyebrows. “Oh, so you don’t want another gift?”
“I’m glad you think this is funny, Potter, but I’ll have you know that I can’t take this potion.”
Ron walked over to the fireplace and grabbed a pinch of Floo powder. “Harry’s already agreed to it.”
Harry knew he had a crush on Draco Malfoy. They might have been polite and awkward housemates when Draco had first moved in, but Harry had felt their friendship develop as time passed by.
Harry turns to look at Dudley. “Why?”
“I'm telling you the truth. I know we got married at nineteen, when everyone told us we were too young, but we proved them wrong. I love you now just as much as I did then, Draco, and I think it’s time we renew our vows.”
“Don’t say anything at all and help me decorate the tree,” Harry said simply. He flicked his wand and sent their dishes over to the sink.
“What do you mean?”
Amy looks at the two like they have lost their minds. “Goodness no! It’s too small. It wouldn’t even fit a newborn. Are you looking for baby outfits?”
Hermione gives Ron a dirty look. “She was grieving, Ron. You can’t fault her for that. However, I do agree that perhaps you should have been a little more tactful, Harry. Have you apologised to Charlie?”
Draco peers down at the page. “It’s right here,” he says, absentmindedly using a spare quill from his pocket to circle the letter in question. “Is this supposed to be hard?”
“I’ve changed my mind about the coffee. Instead, I’ll have a cup of Darjeeling, please. Add an éclair as well,” the man says. The barista rings up his order and asks for a name.
Chuckling at Draco’s enthusiasm, Harry reaches inside his jeans back pocket and pulls out a small black box.
of them to get the job.” A sip of tea doesn’t help with the sinking feeling in Draco’s stomach. He’ll have to rethink the speech he has planned.
“Don’t be scared, Harry,” Ginny says.
Draco, despite Ron taking his time with his fumbling words and hesitation, already knew what he was going to ask. He wanted to be childish and say no, especially since the cold expression that Harry had given him earlier was fresh on his mind. “You saw what Harry was like just now. I don’t think that’s a good idea.”
“I’m sure you have to know it would be stupid to ignore her recommendation,” Ron says. “So here’s your contract.” He pushes the briefcase forward and Draco opens the latch, raising the lid. How many documents are inside if the Weasleys had to use an entire briefcase?
“I doubt it. I’ve had a shit day and all I want is some peace and quiet. And to be left alone.”
“Why not? It’s your home—“
“Tell that to the general public. I had to go to Paris to finish my education and now I can’t get a job anywhere I’ve applied. I’m surprised that I even got an interview to work at the Weasley’s joke shop.” Draco picks up a blueberry muffin and begins to pick it apart.
“How--” Draco begins, taking a deep breath to gather his thoughts, “how do you go from hating me at Hogwarts, as you rightfully should, to inviting me to spend time with your family, to repeatedly asking me on a date? And then when I finally say yes, you show up with something so thoughtful and
Harry starts humming a tune, and it takes almost a full minute for Draco to realise what song it is. “You see someone getting married? Is it Teddy?”
Before Harry can respond, Teddy tugs on Draco’s shirt and Draco looks down even though he can’t see his cousin. “It’s not really dead, Draco,” Teddy says in a soft voice, “Do you need help guessing what it is?”
However, there’s no one behind him and the song stops after one last shrill
“If by working together, he means that he would argue why things had to be done his way, then yes, ‘we worked well together,’” Harry interrupts. “But even when we would argue, he said that helping you with the wedding was the least he could do after all he put you through during the war. He especially wanted your wedding dress to be perfect.”
Harry gazes deeply into the smoky depths. “Interesting,” Harry says at last. “Have you experienced morning sickness or weird food cravings?”
Draco had thought Harry asking him out on a date was a joke. When it happened six more times, he had only said yes to fulfill that silly teenage fantasy he had at Hogwarts of going on a date with Harry Potter, even though in the back of his mind he truly believed that Harry wouldn’t show up.
“But I can’t let him do that. Why burden him with me if my past is going to shadow us forever? I’d rather break up with him now before I ruin his life ever further. It’s never going to be an easy life if he stays with me.”
“Finally,” Harry had whispered, before kissing him again. They kept their relationship a secret so it wouldn’t be used against Harry whilst they were still fighting a war. Not even Granger knew, which was a miracle considering how many times they had almost been caught shagging.
Harry raises an eyebrow. “What do you call this, then?” Harry asks, waving a hand around the room. “You’ve spent that last few weeks in this office and you haven’t been taking care of yourself properly.”
As Harry approaches the table where Draco is sitting with Ron, Ginny, and Pansy, he hears Ron talking about how the Cannons are on a three-game winning streak.
Harry holds up his hands. “Fine, if you don’t want the statue, then I’m going to put it in my office.” He steps closer to Draco, brushing his hair out of the face. He’s finally able to see Draco clearly for the first time. “Don’t tell me you’re jealous of a statue.”
Ron shudders. “Merlin, no! You can’t go shag. There are children present.”
“They are super easy to take care of, practically self-sufficient, and in a pinch you can eat them if you get hungry.”
“Hey, no!” Draco shouts, reaching over to pick her up, but she quickly leaps away, running out with the jumper in her mouth.
They finish their scones before leaving the shop. The streets are slowly filling up as Draco hails a taxi, grateful for the mandatory Muggle Studies class everyone was required to take during their eighth year. He gives the driver the name of the only clothes shop that Harry has ever taken him to, once before.
and peer into Harry’s mind. But he couldn’t, wouldn’t do that to anyone. Especially after having the Dark Lord enter his own mind and seeing everything he wanted to keep hidden.
“Why were you holding the family clock?” Harry asks.
Ron nods. “I haven’t forgotten. I still remember Mum composing the Howler when she found out he was staying in Romania. ‘Charlie, what do you mean you can’t come home for Christmas? If the thought of not seeing your mum this Christmas can’t bring you home, then what about poor Harry? He’s missed you so much!’”
, Draco thinks and is immensely glad that Teddy is always well-behaved when he visits him.
It didn’t take long for Draco to figure out that Harry was lonely now that his friends were married and starting families of their own. One Saturday morning, Harry had turned up outside his flat with Teddy to explore Muggle London, something that Harry had never done as a child. Draco had enjoyed the museums and was surprised at how much fun the football match was even with Teddy screaming in his ear. They had continued exploring London every Saturday and sometimes his Aunt Andromeda would join them, which reminded Draco that perhaps Harry only saw them as friends, or wanted Teddy to grow up with his family.
To Draco’s surprise and shock, six white ferrets jump out of the briefcase and run around the table. Their tails are brushed out, beady red eyes looking at everything of interest, whiskers twitching before they attack. They jump and scatter about, splashing tea and knocking things over as everyone stares at them. In an instant, all the desserts are quickly smashed into crumbs.
Harry nods and they run down the stairs to the kitchen, pausing at the threshold to catch their breaths.
However, Draco shouldn’t have worried about Harry’s reaction. When he finally gathers the courage to look up, Harry wears his heart on his sleeve. There’s an abundance of emotions flitting across his face as he makes his way to the sofa. Draco’s heart quickens when he realises the most prominent one is hope.
Hermione had a knowing smile on her face when Harry finished speaking. “Harry, you don’t need to worry about anything. It seems like he’s smitten with you.”
“I’m an Auror, Neville. You know I can’t avoid trouble,” Harry says, grinning. “It’s just that you’re the only herbologist I know and I figured you’d know the language of flowers?”
Harry pulls the bouquet out of Draco’s hand and replaces it with his own, squeezing gently. Harry’s hands are warm, sun kissed and calloused, while Draco’s fingers are pale, bony and cold to the touch.
“I know that. You know very well that I’m willing to forgive someone as long as I’ve seen they have changed.”
“Harry, you have to promise me that I talk to him first. I don’t want him to be overwhelmed when you barge in with your Gryffindor foolishness that only causes him to say or do something he regrets.”
Draco nods along like he can understand what she is explaining. “How do you know your answer is wrong?”
Daisy beams at him. “Brilliant!” Daisy says, and she doesn’t hesitate to slam her book shut and throw her items in her backpack. “You’re so lucky to be able to do magic! Sometimes I wish I was a witch,” she says wistfully. Draco tries to find the right words to comfort her when suddenly Daisy’s stomach growls and she begins to blush.
Harry laughed. “Luna says that it’s full of Nargles so I never put any up.”
Ginny whoops in delight. “Damn right!”
“What do you do if a rattlesnake bites a Muggle?”
Harry chuckles and opens the box to find that nestled in red tissue paper is a gold Snitch.
, or even my friends and family can change that. I’m sorry for how they’ve treated you, but if they ask me to choose,” Harry says, reaching into his pocket to pull out the ring box. He keeps the lid closed as he continues, “I wouldn’t hesitate in my answer. Yes, there may be times when life is difficult, but I’m willing to be by your side because you’re worth it. I love you. Please tell me that you feel the same?”
“Well, I sort of ruined Harry’s surprise Christmas gift for me.”
Draco is sitting on the bed, but his face is tear-stained and very red from the fact that he has been crying. He’s wrapped in one of Harry’s hoodies, his hair loose and all over his face as if he’s trying to hide from the world. Even his voice is low and raspy and Harry discretely casts a charm that lets him hear what Draco is saying to Pansy.
“Draco, are you home?” Harry asks as he Apparates in the kitchen and tries not to lose his balance. He quickly checks to see if the smiley face balloon he has bought as a surprise present for Draco has survived the journey. The balloon is an impulse buy from a Muggle shop, something Harry thinks Draco will enjoy as he currently has a fascination with all things Muggle.
“I don’t know what to say, Harry.” Here were the words that Draco had longed to hear, going farther back than just these past few months. He had wanted to slot himself in Harry’s life since they were eleven years old. Of course, being his enemy wasn't the best way to go about it, but he was an idiot as a child. Now that he was an adult, and had learned from his mistakes, perhaps it was time to let himself accept Harry’s request.
“If you wait for Snape to come, Potter will be dead within minutes,” Draco had replied. “I can help him. I have the scars to prove it.”
The long slashes on Harry’s chest were the worst Draco had ever seen. Draco had taken the wand with trembling fingers and had spoken the words Snape had used to save Draco’s life months before. When Draco had been sure that the wounds had stopped bleeding, he had Summoned a vial of Dittany and thrust it at Granger. He had left the room just as Snape had burst through the fireplace.
Harry shakes his head. “Sorry, you know I’m a Harpies fan,” he says. “They’ve never broken my heart with a losing season.”
, Harry thinks. He had forgotten to cast a
“You can’t use magic!” Vernon says, remembering a hazy conversation he had with his nephew years ago. “You’ll get a letter from your Ministry. You’ll get arrested and go to Azakabam.”
and it’s my
“What’s this?”
Harry’s cheeks are red, but he manages to keep his voice steady when he answers, “Anytime, Draco.”
Ron sits back in his seat, looking disgruntled. “Traitors. All of you.”
“Give that back, Potter!”
“Look, Pansy, they even have jumpers for babies,” Draco says. “These jumpers really don’t flatter anyone, do they?”
Draco had his wand out and had the name of a spell on the tip of his tongue when he recognised Harry’s voice. He was spread out on his back, his arm in a sling, and he was not wearing his Auror uniform. Harry grimaced, but didn’t say anything or move even after Draco called out his name.
Finally, finally Draco’s hands are on Harry’s cock and it’s so much better than his own hand.
Pansy snorts. “So? You’ve done that before and you’re still alive.”
uses when they write about Draco. He looks haggard with dark shadows under his eyes, sunken bones, and long hair that he hadn’t had a chance to cut, as well as the Dark Mark on full display. He looks exhausted and so very young, very different from the man Harry has loved for almost five years.
Harry nods, at that point agreeing to anything as long as it lets him know that Draco is okay. Pansy scribbles a note to Blaise that they are going to pick up Draco. They watch it fold itself into an aeroplane and fly out the room.
Draco smirks. “Jealous, Weasley?”
Ron groans. “I had almost managed to forget that memory.”
Instead, the house is silent and as Harry walks to the living room, he notices that there are no lights or warmth throughout the entire place. Something is definitely wrong.
“You already did,” Draco replies, going back to reading his notes.
“You did? You know I would never leave you, right? You have ruined me for anyone else, Draco.”
Draco sees a couple walk by, kissing and holding hands and his heart clenches at the sight. All the while Harry’s been in Madrid, Draco has been thinking about asking Harry to finally reveal their relationship to their families. They haven’t exactly been hiding it, as their closest friends know they are dating, but they still only have dates in Muggle London.
“Being in love looks good on you, Harry. If you ever have kids, he’d make a great father,” Dudley says, pointing at where Draco is carrying Daisy as she shakes the plastic bottle and lets it go. The mixture bubbles in the plastic bottle before it flies high above their heads and Draco falls back onto the grass in shock.
His suspicions are confirmed when Harry finds Draco on the couch buried underneath several duvets. He lets go of the balloon in favor of using his wand to light a fire in the fireplace, as well as casting several warming charms.
One thing he knows for certain: he loves Draco more than anything else in the word. To give up something for him would not be such a hardship, not if it brought them peace of mind and happiness.
Draco laughs. “That’s not true. You do not know how very wrong that is. I bet even Harry wouldn’t know how to solve any of this.”
“Help me? How will this, whatever it is, help me? It doesn’t feel like Felix Felicis, which I might add, is illegal for me to use,” Draco says.
The headline turns Harry’s blood to ice.
“Who gave you this?” Draco said at last. He crumbled up the newspaper, trying to control the adrenaline and anger coursing through his body as he struggled to think. He looked up to see Harry standing there with his arms crossed against his chest, glancing outside the kitchen window.
