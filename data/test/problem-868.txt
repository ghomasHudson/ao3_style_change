Draco had gotten the letter the day before. Originally, he hadn't any idea why Potter would consider writing something so mundane. It had been very odd, unexpected and mysterious, all of which merely increased his curiosity.
Upon slamming the door and casting every locking and privacy spell he could, he finally let himself collapse into an armchair with a held back sob.
"Long story short, my friend had to invoke an old pureblood tradition of naming parents as first of kin despite the existence of a spouse.  So it wasn't much work to get Narcissa Black's magical signature and permission..."
Despite the threat hovering just beyond the horizon, Draco had to admit that Harry's suggestion for him to continue with his daily routine made the next few weeks much more bearable. Not only could he fluidly move as he had from habit, (still having to travel around and meet with associates concerning his various business dealings) but he also constantly felt the tug of the
"I don't have time for your petty games, or your rather unhealthy fascination with me or my family," Draco spat out. "I've better things to do than waste my time on you,
Harry thought back to the past year of spending time with Draco, of sharing silent jokes and meaningful glances, of exchanging secrets and staying over at each other's places. The blonde's unerring understanding of what Harry thought and felt, and the closeness and comfort he can so easily provide without trying too hard. The fleeting looks and the sense of longing for Draco's presence…
just take it for what it is. I care about you and want to help you. It's not because of some stupid concept of debt or anything. I just… want to protect you."
Malfoy rubbed frustratingly at his eyes, which signaled to Harry just how bothered he was. "No, I haven't had any real enemies in the last few years, let alone anyone who would have the bollocks to threaten me directly."
"Reading time now?" Harry asked with a smile. The boy in front of him, now pretty much recovered from their tickle war, nodded eagerly.
"You'll have bad days, too," Potter's voice suddenly called his attention. "When they just won't shut up and you'll probably slip the occasional swearword in between while you contemplate why you had ever decided that you wanted kids. Then you realize that it's all worth it anyway."
Harry nodded in agreement. "I dunno, I reckon I realized just how much closer we've gotten, and I doubt the others are really aware, you know?"
Harry turned towards Ernie Macmillan, who had been called last minute from his home to complete the elite MMI force. The Auror looked back at him. "About ten minutes, give or take," he replied curtly, indicating the blank piece of parchment in his hand. "The Unspeakables are just fine-tuning the magical signals they developed for the search. The exact coordinates should appear on this immediately."
The air hung heavily when Harry absorbed Draco's calm words. "What?!" he blurted out. "But - but I'd have known when - if he…"
Ginny chewed on her lower lip, which Harry knew meant that she was trying to find the best words to soften the heavy blow that she was about to give. "Erm… I was actually thinking of… well, I'm not exactly the best parent, but shuffling the kids between us every other week just isn't working. In fact, I think it makes Jamie have more tantrums."
"I swear to Merlin, you will regret even coming into my life and ruining it. I don't care if what you say is true, if Astoria was behind this then you will both suffer!
It was true. Until now, no one was really aware of how close Harry and Draco had actually become. In the few short years since they had reconciled, not even Ron nor Hermione understood the extent of their interaction apart from the occasional call or pub crawl. In light of Draco's recent security measures, everyone expected them to stay more in touch via Floo, but it was still somewhat of a secret that they tended to cross over into each other's sitting rooms at odd hours, just to talk.
Harry went through his schedule mentally, a bit excited when he realized that he had some time off that very week. Perfect for some bonding time with his godson. "I can do it," he said enthusiastically. "I've got some time this week, I'm sure you and Arthur need to take more care of Hugo at the moment..." he trailed off, his worry for Hermione coming back.
Malfoy looked him in the eye, holding his gaze while he appeared to be thinking of his answer. "Yes," he finally responded. "It goes against the Malfoy family tradition, but I would love to have a large family. Though not as expansively as the Weasleys, of course," he added with a friendly smirk. "The contract between myself and my wife include children, but the decision also rests largely on Astoria. Most Purebood families have only one, sometimes two heirs at the most, but..." he trailed off, a darker expression seemed to flicker onto his face, but the shadow disappeared at once. "...Having Vince and Greg with me at Hogwarts really made me wish I'd had siblings."
"I apologize," Malfoy countered immediately, cheeks slightly pink. "To be honest, your appearance was not at all expected, and this led to quite a shock."
Hearing this from his mother was too much. He was taken back to the times when his mother would utter the exact same words right after Draco had shared some sort of dilemma or made a rash decision. It was her tone that did it. The one that told him she was sure that he was wrong.
Hermione stared at the wall behind Draco. "Ron and I found out about Hugo. It wasn't really an accident, but it wasn't like we were trying, either. It just happened. Ron, of course, was over the moon. I was...in shock for a while. But I got over it quickly."
Malfoy - no, Draco - couldn't stop himself from snorting in laughter. "It's going to be so weird thinking of you as just Harry when all my life it's been Perfect Potter, the Golden Boy."
Potter nodded, still speaking in his History of Magic voice. "It was effective. It was activated independently right after we had caught him. At first we didn't think it would help him, because usually the Obliviators can unblock even a complex Memory Charm. In this case, however, the actual memories were gone, with no chances of being recovered so far. It's worse than the one Lockhart got, because at least he had residual traces of his past, and the ghosts of old habits are still present in him even now. In Pince's case though, it was almost surgical, really precise. The only memory we managed to retrieve was this, we think it's a list of ingredients." He handed Draco a copy. "The Obliviators believe that this wasn't erased because it held no personally incriminating significance to Pince."
"No," Draco said, shaking his head. "I always called Potter an idiot, but we're talking about Auror Potter here. He's not about to randomly owl a man he'd met for drinks one time, a year ago, and write him a letter that makes absolutely no logical sense. He's not that stupid. That's got to be it. They need my help and can't ask properly without being suspicious."
He couldn't seem to decide on his words, but he could tell that Ginny was trying to defuse his nerves by smiling encouragingly at him and gently taking his hand in hers.
Malfoy looked at him as well, which made Harry slightly uncomfortable with all the attention. "Er, what else is there to understand about a marriage contract?" the brunet asked.
"If you've not noticed," Harry said, "I've moved my entire fucking job here just to be with James. We've both made sacrifices for this, Ginny, but are you sure you're choosing the right ones to give up?!" He paused, then added in a lower voice, "Do I even mean anything to you anymore? Because in the last year, we've barely had the time to be with each other except to put the other to bed, or maybe get in a good fuck while we can. We're not even married and we've already got so many fucking issues to deal with, but you're never here long enough to work them out with me!"
Harry noted the mingling of a serious tone under a joking one. "Yeah, well, all three of us are already bona fide parents," he told Malfoy, shrugging. "It's like a huge part of our instinct is to smother new parents and welcome them into the fold as embarrassingly as possible."
Ron's eyes widened at the joke, then smiled. "Yeah, I s'pose," he agreed, knowing what Harry meant about putting all their hopes on their ex-nemesis. "If he's really the best, and he can't do shite, then we're all screwed."
"So..." Ron cocked his head, deep in thought. "You guys are going through the same motions for this pregnancy? I mean, her going to training during the day and coming back here?"
, Draco reminded himself) chose that moment to walk into the room with a flustered blush. She shuffled a wad of parchment towards Weasley, who was sitting at the head of the conference table putting together what the rest of the team had assembled that week.
"Oh, you'd be surprised," Potter said. "The Ministry underestimated Pettigrew," he said. "Even I made the mistake of letting him go once, and we all know how that got out of hand." He looked Draco in the eye, and held his gaze. "I won't make the same mistake. I'm sure that Pince holds the key to unravelling this series of murders. "And right now, as much as I'd hate to admit it, you're the key to our investigation."
"I think... I think I was afraid to marry you," Ginny suddenly said softly, as if afraid to voice it out. "It's only recently that I've realized, I don't really like being tied down, to one person, or one place, or... I don't know. I feel... grounded. I didn't realize that until two days ago, when I found out..."
"If that idiot of a Mediwizard would tell me, I'd know by now," Draco spat venomously, glaring at the man who had nervously jogged away from them.
Which of course, he knew wasn't exactly the truth, but if he were honest with himself, he could even admit that he had rather enjoyed the last hour being Potter's emotional crutch.
, it being an old and ancient invocation and thus rooted in traditional magical bindings. Surely, no one here is in denial of the fact that his very involvement was the key to defeating Voldemort." Many representatives nodded in assent, just to show the Minister that they agreed. That was always important, naturally.
"Okay, okay..." Harry took a deep breath. "I'll get together a team, and we can address your problem as soon as you get back in. I'll be working from home and not on the field, but Ron is fully capable of leading the investigation from the Ministry."
For a while, it seemed that his wife had no words. Being Astoria, it was a bit odd that she had nothing to say for a change, and that worried Draco.
"Let's not forget the other angles here," Ron said in a placating tone that helped little to assuage Harry's darkening mood. "Could be that someone wanted Draco for themselves, which would mean Astoria was the victim-to-get-rid-of and must have been dosed as well. Or it's also possible that someone wanted
Draco could do nothing but stare at the serious brunet in front of him. "For what?" he asked confusedly.
"You still retained your career, though, right?" He wasn't exactly up to date with the Trio gossip these past few years, and only remembered snippets from conversations with Potter and Weasley.
Once his best friend had gone, Harry dropped his head into his hands. So many things were happening now, but all he could think of was how Draco looked, half-asleep on his couch in the middle of
Potter nodded. For a while they stood there, staring at each other. For some reason, it didn't seem awkward at all. Until Ginevra walked into the room and stared at him.
Harry thought about it. "Well I think he was able to grasp that Ron and I want to keep it on the down low about both the case and his secret connection to the Ministry. Viridian was the last place the three of us had a drink, so it would make sense that we would meet up there again for casual friendly banter. He's also got a good reason to be there without suspicion, and so do Ron and I."
She swatted him on the forearm. "You could have gone pro, too, you idiot. Youngest Seeker in a century and all."
"Oh." It was then that Draco remembered another chunk of their surreal conversation last night. "Right."
Harry thought that over in his head and smirked. The first thing that came to mind was Malfoy, who, to Harry at least, was the mental epitome of 'Pureblood'. No doubt he was already flaunting his 'assets' and shopping for a wife like Ginny had said. "I'm lucky then," he mused, "it's good that your folks aren't actually considering my assets as a requirement for my courtship."
Ginny hugged him. "Okay, I guess your suggestion of having our own floors to ourselves is a good one for now. And yeah, it might not be in a while but…" She whispered conspiratorially in his ear, "When you
Ron read his mind. "Mate, those are the mind maps. The entire intellectual framework of the Auror Corps in that single box."
"More importantly," said Potter, "do you actually think following this angle will add to the investigation?"
"Astoria herself has no problems with the old ways of child rearing," he remarked thoughtfully. "And I used to agree with her. After all, it is the status quo, and nothing much has changed in the system for the last few decades. Wizards and witches of pureblood status are raised to understand familial duties and obligations, but not familial relationships. And look at me now, I can't possibly imagine leaving Scorpius in the company of nurse elves during his infancy even though I was brought up to expect such a practice."
"Well, you should," Harry said, silently agreeing with Molly for once. "I mean, it's a pretty hazardous job you've got, and they won't let you fly anyway after next month." Their Healer (under the strictest limitations of the Solum Sanctuarii, of course) had told them that the rest of the pregnancy after the first trimester called for less physically demanding activities, and there went Quidditch, out the window.
It had been the Weasel's idea to go someplace else, and neither Draco nor Potter had any objection, given their current state. In no time at all, they had all Floo'd to Number Twelve Grimmauld Place, which was supposedly Potter's home (they admitted that Apparating in their mental state would have been disastrous and irresponsible).
"At the Burrow this weekend. Ron and I had to go to that overseas trip, so we had them settled for the rest of the week with their grandparents. Anyway, I can be there in a couple of hours, if that's okay."
There was silence for a while, during which they both paid a lot of attention to their mugs. It seemed to both that they had exhausted their capacity to express their emotions. Harry threw around his thoughts then, wondering if this was all just a part of life. It seemed too much that he and Ron were basically in the same boat. On the other hand, it relieved him a bit since he knew deep down that they would probably get over this pathetic period in their lives, maybe even laugh about it. That didn't mean he couldn't hate it while it lasted.
"It'll be quick," Potter reassured, though with a frown. "It won't be my full process, so it'll just be a light incantation and then a record of your simplified mind map will be kept in the secure archives."
bindings. He knew it had been devised millennia ago by the precedents of the Wizengamot, as a way to protect certain individuals with stations so high that their celebrity constantly put them in danger. He knew enough about magical theory to understand that the invocation was a combination of warding and good old magical law. The magical bindings on Harry would act as personal wards, shielding Harry himself from the outside world. People who wanted to share personal information about him, without his express permission, found that they couldn't. If he so wished, he could go around warding himself so that people wouldn't notice or recognize him unless he wished it. He could even push the bindings outwards to shield other people to an extent. In effect, it was as if Potter was wrapped with a Fidelius Charm around the clock.
"The last favor my mother and I ever did for my father was to ensure that his death would at least pass by in quiet honor, not in scandal."
: Most of them have the same question. (laughs) How have you kept your head being the only female in your group?
She turned back to face him, eyes streaming with tears. "I know you were having a perfect morning, alright? It just hurt to see that I wasn't part of it. Like I didn't even have to be here for all of you to just have this amazing picture of a happy family of something. Just... it hurt, alright?"
So far, Harry's predictable lack of luck was on a roll. Unfortunately. At this point, he knew to expect the worst of anything with a sort of sad resignation.
The man Transfigured a chair and sat just beyond Draco's reach. Which probably wasn't necessary, the blond thought, because he was still held painfully on his knees and hands on the dirty floor. Whatever this cavernous space was, it was not comfortable.
He went through the piles of parchment littering one corner of his desk, in a weak attempt at putting his things in order. Draco's reply was still sitting on top of one pile, and Harry perused it once more before dropping it and heaving a sigh.
"You know," he heard himself say out of nowhere, "Kreacher keeps burning his beans, so I have to stock my kitchen with the canned sort. This is really good."
Harry was instantly wary. He automatically steeled himself, his stomach stuck in a flurry of emotions that cycled between relief, apprehension, excitement, anger, longing and nervousness. Apart from Ron, Hermione, Arthur, Molly and Andromeda., there was only one other person keyed directly into the wards of Grimmauld Place that they could Floo in and out with ease.
Harry let out a nervous breath. "And Draco?" he asked worriedly. "I've got this weird feeling in my gut. Can't explain, but it just feels like something's terribly wrong."
"Nothing is wrong with that, my dragon," Narcissa whispered. "I do not take sides in this, for I am still the descendant of an old and powerful family. I was raised with the same expectations, but I admittedly had my own... misgivings about some of them. I understand Astoria's frustrations - you two have entered a magically binding contract, and must therefore forge into the future with these mutual goals in mind. Both of your ambitions depend heavily on your public persona, and it would do you well to remember that.
Deep in his gut, Harry felt the stirrings that told him that this was another chance for them, another start, another beginning. And that was exactly what they needed.
"If you could name your son, then," Potter suddenly had a serious look in his eyes. "If you could get rid of those old traditions, what would you name your son?"
Knowing that Teddy would always move faster when in high spirits, Harry felt no shame in knowing that he could relax this time and not have to fight his godson into his clothes.
"They're fine," Draco replied. "The Fidelius makes it a bit difficult for Astoria to conduct her social life as normally as mine, but she's making do. Being threatened can do that to you."
Harry realized that the blonde was alone, and was standing awkwardly before their booth. With slight reluctance, he said, "Er, would you, er, care to join us?"
"My son!" Draco could feel a heavy knot forming in his throat, threatening to break his voice. His mind filled with thoughts of his precious… his beautiful… "Don't you DARE even -"
Now it was Malfoy's turn to laugh. "Seeking comfort from a sworn enemy," he pointed out. "Tsk tsk, you know it's basic personal security," he teased, a grin on his face.
PS: For all of you who commented that the previous chapters were all perfect and fluffy, you should have known better what that might have meant for future chapters hahaha. :) Enjoy! ~Idishi
"Yes, I thought some time alone with her might give you the same burning joy. But when you came back, you seemed to have dimmed further."
"I wonder why he wants to meet up there again," Hermione said contemplatively. "Nothing wrong with it, just, of all the other possible places…"
When Potter began testifying for Draco, that was when his brain almost imploded. Here was his greatest enemy, in the perfect position to ensure Draco's downfall, and of course he had to act the bloody Savior! They never once made eye contact, nor did Potter even acknowledge that he was there in the same room. But the words he said with so much conviction... about how he knew Draco so intimately from their schoolyard spats, how he had seen through his taunts and eventually realized the danger he was in when Voldemort had returned... and how Potter had been in the Astronomy Tower with Dumbledore.
There you have it, folks. Our three young heroes, still on their way to changing the world, albeit in different ways. My hour at the Burrow was a pleasant opportunity, and more than enough for me to gain a new and deeper understanding of the Trio. It seems obvious that Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger will soon become the model of a perfectly new breed of family, with the healthy and playful relationship dynamic that they clearly have. And it warms my heart to learn of Harry Potter's continuous crusade against the Dark, showing us that he really is a true Savior at heart. behind his wall of privacy. Perhaps they will grant us another peek into their private lives, but that might be a while. It did, of course, take almost four years to be granted this highly personal interview. But until then, we may honor our own heroes by wishing them well on their way towards the bright futures ahead of them.
Draco heard a wail coming from behind Pansy.. "Must you go so soon?" he pouted at her jokingly. She returned his look with a grin.
"We know it was successfully invoked by Dumbledore for Harry when he was brought to his Muggle family, but anything more than that is hearsay," he explained as calmly as he could. "The Black ward that Mother found is very similar in nature, calling for a blood kin's sacrifice -"
Astoria shook her head. "I know nothing, darling. Any enemies I might have gained would have ended only in petty quarrels of little intellect. No one I know would have reason to resort to such an open threat..." Her usually sunny complexion had turned pale as milk upon hearing about the mysterious letter, and she had been quiet for most of the time since Draco had called the family to meet. There was still a hint of a tremor in her delicate fingers, as if they were no longer under her control.
"I'll handle this quickly, Scorp," he said to his son, (ignoring the inner voice that was reminding him how much Potter would make fun of him if he found out). He shifted the child to his other hip in case he might become uncomfortable after being held in one position for so long. "Then we can go back to looking at all the lovely birds like we planned, alright?"
Despite Sirius' endless complaints about the house, Harry felt quite at home within its walls. It had, after all, been the first 'real' home he had that was his own, and despite the ghosts of the war and the darker memories of the Order of the Phoenix, he found that he preferred to link it instead to his godfather, and the fond memories he had of their short but significant time together. It made him feel like her were truly coming home to someone, just being here. Having James with him this time filled him with an odd mixture of joy and sadness, unable to help but imagine that it would be like this if he and Sirius had had a normal life together in this very house.
"Ah." The man leisurely got up to his feet and bent down to look at Draco eye to eye. "You'd be meaning
At the far end of the corridor, he saw the elder Weasley throw him a thankful look, and Draco nodded before turning back and heading to the nearest cafe, a confused-looking Potter in tow.
"Seriously?" Harry suddenly said, surprise evident on his face. "You guys aren't... angry or mad or something at me?"
I know that the waiting game for a WIP is difficult, but I promise you that I will not let you down! It's just taking much longer to find time to consistently write.
Despite the obvious tear tracks on his face and the likelihood of a splotchy complexion from his bout of sobbing into his hands, Harry felt the corners of his lips turn slightly upwards. Hermione was right, Malfoy's presence was a pretty big distraction, and it was a welcome bit of amusement in the midst of a potential medical crisis.
"-if that's what you think about our friendship, then fuck if I've been fooling myself by believing we had something, and I really thought we did and it just fucking annoys the hell out of me how you just can't comprehend that I value whatever the hell we've got going on and it seems like you don't see it the same way-"
"You forget I almost offed you single handedly in that bathroom," Harry said sharply, in an effort to bring Draco away from his maudlin thoughts. "I'm not a saint, you know. Yes, I care when people get hurt, but this is just really personal for me and I don't care who saves who. You've saved me, too, at the Manor. I'll never forget that."
"It's not like anyone rally talks about it, though," Harry pointed out, "I mean, Peterson and Roche are technically Pureblood aren’t they? But when they got married, none of this business deal stuff went down."
At that moment, Weasley chose to emit a particularly loud snort, which seemed to bring back Draco's perspective despite the echoes of the hangover. His thoughts lingered on Pott - Harr -
Narcissa glared at him. "I am not being irrational. I only mean you well, Draco. There have been so many opportunities for me to play you like the obedient heir that you might have been groomed to be, had the second war not happened as it did. But I have always been against all of that, and everything I have done since having you has been to ensure that you are able to grow into yourself and make your own decisions. I admit my mistake now because I assumed that you were neglecting your marriage. But now it appears to me that you cannot be completely happy just acting the part of husband to your wife."
"Nothing," she shrugged. "I was just thinking about how great it is that you're finally able to do what you want, when you want to and how you want to. It's so refreshing to see you sure about what you're doing."
"At least you have one to practice with," Harry joked. "I've already got two, and twice the pressure to be the perfect dad. Which I highly doubt, to be honest. Not for lack of trying, though."
Astoria laughed. "No, silly, you've already gone and done it," she said with an uncharacteristic giggle as if she had a private joke that Draco didn't understand. It unnerved him a bit, if he were being honest.
"What, Ginny? What?" Harry demanded. "I don't know about you, but I didn't envision my future to include two children who barely see their mum because she's off representing the country. Oh, I'm sure they'll be proud of you," he added when her expression turned hard, "but honestly, is that the future you saw for yourself? To have kids and be away from them most of the time?"
"Well.…we fight. We make up. We compromise a lot. We're not exactly going by the book, so we're kind of… making it up as we go along."
) on his lap. The moment Healer Rosewood appeared to pull him away, Harry shot up and followed her, still holding his son and feeling both ecstatic and worried. Helen herself was a bit short of breath and looking paler.
Ginny laughed. "I know you do, but at this point, it's a bit unnecessary seeing you have a house elf you don't use, and limitless places to go for food."
Throughout the process, Draco still couldn't wrap his head around what was actually happening. Especially when he knew that some parts of the chant included very heavily laden connotations, roughly translated to terms such as 'dear', 'beloved' and 'heart of hearts'. The irony of it all did not escape him.
He took a deep breath. "...if you would allow me a chance to at least suggest a possible name... for my son."
That was it. He wanted structure in his life, because he hadn't had a drop of it in his entire existence. He didn't think his stay at the Dursley's was bad enough, because he had a daily routine and he stuck to it. He liked his job because it gave him a list of things to do, and at the end of the day he got to cross all of it out and go to bed and start again in the morning. Perhaps the Auror career was a bit more exhausting, but for now it had served its purposes. Going on a consultancy felt like being lazy to him. It was giving up responsibility, it was going back to being lost and pretty much useless.
He found his wife in their private sitting room, laid out delicately on one of the lounges, her hair draped over the edge and brushing the carpet.
He decided to take a break and went to the corner of his study, where James was playing quite happily with blocks in his play pen. Harry took his son in his arms and playfully bounced him up and down, sometimes throwing him up in the air and catching him again. The baby was ecstatic, and Harry had the feeling they would have another Quidditch player in the family, it was practically inevitable.
"It's a pretty desperate move," Hermione said. "And I believe Kingsley was telling us the truth. We know how he works, this can't have come from just him. It had to have been proposed for approval and it was probably treated as one of the many memos that goes through his desk each day. And I'm willing to bet that it was worded so it wouldn't attract unwanted attention until it was approved."
Draco had allowed several weeks to pass after he had had that reminiscent sit-down with his mother. Narcissa had gladly recounted all the little milestones that he had made as a toddler, but throughout her tale, he couldn't help but notice the fleeting sparks of sadness that curtained her expression whenever she spoke of the strict Malfoy upbringing that Lucius had so insisted. The Black family had always leaned towards Pureblood ideals, but Narcissa admitted to having been part of the generation that had been exposed to more liberal ideals. Her sister Andromeda, had welcomed her estrangement and lived out her life in relative happiness away from the strict upbringing, while her cousin, Sirius, had gone completely against the grain and done everything within his ability to upset his elders, choosing Gryffindor as the greatest insult to his own family. Narcissa, however, had married into the proud Malfoy family, which was perhaps as traditional and old-blood as Pureblood could ever get. She knew what to expect from such an arrangement, and while she and Lucius had had a strong alliance and a rather warm closeness, she did not always agree with the strict and sometimes painful treatment of children in the Malfoy line.
"I've waited so long for this," the man muttered audibly to himself, "and you haven't even figured anything out. What a pity. What a
And what a night it was. Draco sighed heavily as he attempted to reorganize his new facts about the Chosen One.
Ginny's soft lips brushed the top of his head, and he closed his eyes contentedly. They hadn't had a lot of time together this last month, since she was out most of the day and only stayed over to sleep, leaving before anyone woke. Harry had no idea how she was doing it, but it pleased him to see her so happy and dedicated to her sport. He used his hold on her hands to maneuver her to settle on his lap.
Harry was immediately concerned, if he were to judge by the vacant stare and the restlessness of her hands.
Ron took down Harry's orders, shaking his head. "Seriously, Harry," he said, shaking his head, "I can't wait to get these stupid arseholes. Especially since they sound all self-righteous and spoiled." Harry silently agreed. Too many innocents were already murdered, though thankfully the masterminds had not caused any disturbance in the last month.
"So Scorpius was an accident, was he?" Draco could no longer control the rage building up inside him upon overhearing these two people talk about his son that way. Because Scorpius
"You don't have to tell me if you really wish not to," Malfoy said suddenly, his voice slightly laced with ice. "But I hope you don't take me for someone stupidly thick."
"Well, that's all I've found for now, so don't get your hopes up too much," Draco drawled, but clearly pleased at the sincere praise in Potter's voice.
"She's aspired to be Chaser for the national team," Ron said. "But she's got to realize that those kinds of dreams have to take a bit of a backseat. She's got a kid, for Merlin's sake."
Once again, he was waiting in his study for Malfoy's owl. The blond was always out and about, away from any Floo. They had therefore been exhausting their owls with the frequent exchange of letters over the last few weeks, but Harry liked to think that he and Malfoy had the same work ethic. Despite not having any personal links to the case, Malfoy had been nothing but hardworking, and the other Aurors (and even Ron) had begun to admire his determination. Even the resident potioneers had taken to asking him about his experiences in Europe, or his take on several new theories on the Wolfsbane Potion. He had earned the respect of every individual in the Auror Corps, and Harry felt a bit proud of the blond git, though he kept it to himself. He had always scoffed at Malfoy's overzealous vanity, which was usually mentioned at least once a week on the Prophet, but he felt relieved to know that the accomplishments in Potions Mastery were for real, and he, Harry, would be hard pressed to find anyone as good at it than Malfoy. Now he definitely understood why the Department of Mysteries were 'extra protective of their secret consultant - he was worth the trouble.
"Why did you mention your nightmares?" Potter suddenly asked, his voice laced with worry. "You keep going around the question. Why did you need to see me?"
If there was anything Draco despised most, it was being mocked for his lack of intelligence when he had worked so hard for years to prove that he
If possible, the mediwitch looked even twitchier as she tried to meet the blonde's eyes. She mumbled a reply, but it was so indiscernible that Draco rolled his eyes and kept his verbal insults to himself, to his wife's amusement.
Ron shrugged. "My sister only just sent us an owl yesterday and told us she's been away for a week already. We figured it had something to do with that..."
"I should probably go back down then and save her," he said, heaving a sigh before turning back to walk towards Ron.
Harry narrowed his eyes, determined to really look at the blond seated across the other end of his couch. He was unusually pale, unkempt and slouched into the cushions. It was so unlike Draco, and yet still so very Draco, that Harry couldn't help but lift a corner of his mouth into a secret half smile for himself.
. We’ve got other things to deal with immediately, anyway. And to answer your question, I think this house is big enough for the both of us, and then some."
"Yes, to parade him as the youngest Malfoy brat," Gerard interjected smugly. "And I never had to worry about raising the brat meself. Our plan still followed through! Happy accident, indeed!"
"We all went out last night, and he and Ron stayed over. Malfoy's been working with us on the case, if you recall what I've told you over the Floo." He didn't know why he was suddenly defensive of the blonde, but he knew that his fiancée wasn't exactly a fan of his former adversary. "And since your brother was as functional as a flobberworm, he's been kind enough to help out with Teddy and James this morning, actually."
"I'm guessing you haven't seen the paper, then?" Hermione said, looking slightly nervous. "Do you have the Prophet with you?'
As Malfoy prepared to leave, he gave the two Aurors a friendly smirk. "Thank you for having me over, last night and this morning," he said. He gave a meaningful glance towards Harry, and the latter knew that he was also silently thanking him for everything else they couldn't mention in front of Ron. "James is a wonderful child, and so is Teddy. I'm looking forward to seeing them again, if you don't mind."
Draco and Narcissa looked surprised. It looked like everyone else was too, as they all thought the last witness (biased, of course) had already been cross examined. Then the biggest shock of his life hit him like a well-aimed Confundus.
Luckily, Teddy was staying for several days this time, so Harry was sure to have his hands full of his godson's shenanigans. Merlin knew he needed the distraction after the long, boring days he'd been having, working on his latest case/curse. Sitting in front of the fire, he couldn't contain his excitement on seeing his godson again. There could never be a dull moment with that crazy ball of energy.
Ginny nodded, using her hand to wipe at her face, but Harry steadied her with his arms so she had to look in his eyes.
Harry gasped and squirmed. Harry was then full, so agonizingly, wonderfully full, something Harry had never felt before—then Harry came first and Malfoy next.
Harry could not imagine, he thought as he tilted his head up, how ridiculous he must look with Malfoy kissing at his neck. He closed his eyes, chest heaving still.
Malfoy, the typically dominant, controlling, and confident Slytherin, was crying and whimpering like a small puppy. He kept begging, absolutely pleading for more.
Malfoy went white. “Potter,” he said stiffly. “We don’t have tutoring tonight, in case your tiny brain has neglected to remember.”
At the mention of his name, Harry’s jaw tightened but he didn’t look up from his own book. “Actually,” he interjected. “I’m not tutoring him anymore.”
Hermione took a sip of her tea. "You know, he has been acting quite strange today," She said, looking at each other then. "Earlier, he didn't say a single word during breakfast."
“Okay,” Malfoy said harshly, angry and flustered again. He fell back away from Harry, breathing harshly with his white hair in front of his eyes. “Yeah.”
But alas, he was stuck thinking about the agonizingly irritating blonde for all hours of the day—especially when they had classes together—especially, he thought with a blush, late at night in his dormitory.
Harry wanted him from those words alone and, resisting the urge to slide into his lap, focused on flipping through the pages.
Harry felt uncomfortable from the eyes that were on him. He could not bring himself to believe that this was the same person that had kissed again yesterday. He almost felt like he dreamt it, and for a fleeting moment, wondered stupidly if he did. However, he remembered the journey back to the Gryffindor common room with a chest tight with anxiety.
Harry was relieved that Snape had not noticed this or he would have taken points from Gryffindor as well. Hermione was taking notes profusely and Ron would jot something down lazily every once in a while.
Snape just had a dark expression on his face, looking furiously at Harry as the scuffle was entirely his fault—which, Harry thought, meeting his professor’s eyes, it was not.
They stared at each other for a moment. A heavy silence had filled the room besides Malfoy’s rough breathing.
Harry weakly attempted to say his name in something that sounded professor-like, but Malfoy just grinned and continued to change the color of the juice. He looked proud and held it up to look at it more closely. He seemed to be intent on focusing on anything other than Harry and the homework in front of them.
Harry suddenly felt very anxious. He looked over, double-checking to make sure that Pansy was indeed out of the room. “You have to be more careful. We have to keep this a secret,” Harry said, hearing the worry in his own voice. “This can’t get out.”
And, with that, he began to write again. Now, however, he worked more stiffly and silently. When he was done, he did not so much as touch Harry before he left.
Malfoy stammered for a bit, hands turning into fists. He looked like he was going to snap. But instead, all he managed was, "Are we meeting tonight? For—tutoring?”
Harry’s mind was foggy. He swallowed thickly and exhaled. “Well,” he said. “Now that you’ve had your fun, finish your paper.”
Ron raised a brow. "Well, for starters he didn't even complain that he had to be your partner during Potions. And then that episode!" He added, as if remembering. "What was that about!”
“Potter, I told Malfoy to reach out to you for help in the Defense Against the Dark Arts. I instruct you to take him under your wing and instead, you found it appropriate to absolutely swing on one another in the middle of the common room,” Snape drawled.
He realized that, with Snape forcing him to tutor Malfoy, he would not be able to wriggle out of this situation. And neither could Malfoy.
“Look, mate, it’s weird. But it’s just classwork. If anything, Malfoy will just be his usually ass self,” Ron supported, propping himself up on his arms. “If you need me, though, I’m here.”
“After all, my grades are at least passing now,” Malfoy shifted his robes to hide his, um, excitement. His face was pink. “Which is all I need.”
“You’re a slut, Draco Malfoy,” Harry whispered, and with that, Malfoy came with a high-pitched moan around Harry’s fingers. Come coated Harry’s hand as Malfoy shuddered through his orgasm.
“I didn’t like it,” Malfoy retorted, and even Harry noticed how lame the response was. “After everything that happened, I’m just uncomfortable.”
“Thank you, Ron,” Harry said and strode out, not turning to look at Malfoy until they were halfway down the hallway. His head and heart were pounding and he was aware of Malfoy’s heavy breathing at his side.
“Surely, you wouldn’t want to discuss this right here and now… unless?” Harry ventured more boldly now.
Malfoy pushed himself so he was sitting in front of Harry. “So you don’t like her then?” He challenged, finally looking Harry in the eye. Malfoy looked different; normally he was so guarded. Right now, he appeared to be open, unmasked, and uncomfortably knowing. “You lied, then. You lied to me, Potter?”
The topic of Malfoy came up the next day during lunch as well. Hermione brought it up first, which surprised Harry. He would have thought Ron would have after their bickering last night.
Instead, he looked rather abashed and began to eat hastily. Harry turned back to his food as well, not realising that Hermione and Ron had picked up on what happened.
They made their way to Professor Snape's room after lunch. When the bell rang, Malfoy still wasn't in his seat. It wasn't maybe a minute or two later that he burst through the doors, aghast, and fumbled to his seat.
Malfoy let out a noise that sounded like a cross between another sob and a moan. “Oh, my— Merlin, just fuck me— keep going,” he babbled.
In fact, a half hour later, when he was mounting his broomstick, he could have sworn he saw a white-blonde blur watching him from inside the castle.
Harry ignored this comment, throwing the textbook open on the table. He began to flip through his notebook in search of the most recent chapter of study. “Don’t waste my time, Malfoy,” he snapped.
Malfoy sneered, delivering a withering look at Harry. “You don’t tell me what to do, Potter,” he said. “I’m afraid that’s not in the cards right now.”
“Yes,” Harry whispered. His voice came out muffled from the hand over his mouth. His eyes nearly rolled back when Malfoy gave another forceful thrust. “I want it all the time. I keep thinking about you fucking me and I can’t stop.”
There was a few seconds of tension before he lowered his wand a mere fraction. Malfoy followed, also dropping his wand until they both slipped them back in their pockets.
Malfoy said, his voice low and strangely hoarse, sounding as though he were being strangled by some invisible force, “Shut up.”
Malfoy just smirked. “Well, I don’t like it.And I changed my mind,” he added. “I realized that I won’t benefit from having you as a tutor.”
Harry laid on his back in the bed that night. He stared at the ceiling. Ron was talking in the bed over from him, but Harry was only absentmindedly listening and nodding every once in a while.
It wasn't much at first, but then Malfoy was definitely acting rather strange. Really, really strange. He was behaving in a rather loopy manner. His features softened and he looked rather content. He hummed amicably, seeming almost unaware that he was still in a classroom.
“Well, I have a lot to talk about. Or... share with others,” Harry said knowingly as he raised his voice, feeling only slightly guilty about the very blatant blackmail but people were staring,
“Yes, sir,” Harry said, and decidedly zoned out. He was relieved that all of the attention had been moved off of him.
“So what will you be doing?” Ron asked. He was looking at Harry raptly, as though hanging on his every word of the story.
Harry tried to pry his hand away, but suddenly found it very difficult. His mind was foggy and befuddled.
Harry nodded. Only then did he realize just how ridiculous he sounded. He rubbed at the back of his neck uncomfortably.
Harry groaned. He lowered his head so close to his lunch that he nearly had his chin in his mashed potatoes. "Just give it a rest. We just do not get along, nothing new. Nothing else," He said, taking an angry bite of his pot pie. "Can you just let it alone? Please?"
Harry only then realized that his hands were shaking. He could barely feel as though he could get a breath in but at the same time, he was becoming very aware of his breath coming in quick pants.
“She likes you, you think you like her, you’ve kissed, but you don’t want to get together, but there is chemistry, and you’re curious about what could come of it?” Ron echoed after Harry recited the story to him, Hermione still looking at them wide-eyed.
Ron laughed. "Wait until I tell Hermione! Of all people, Draco Malfoy, tried to snog you," He said, laughing so hard that he leaned over the chair. He pounded his fist on the table. "Who heard of a thing?"
Harry was dumbfounded, absolutely embarrassed and finding his hands shaky. He tried to busy himself by re-reading over the potion instructions—even though they were already done. “Stop that.”
“Of course, I have to do all the work,” Malfoy continued. “He’s too busy daydreaming about the Weasley girl to even try to focus.”
“Very attentive of you, Potter, but thankfully I do have my father as a part of the ministry,” Malfoy shrugged. He took a step closer, to where Harry could feel his breath on his lips, but he did not move in to kiss him. “But if you don’t want to tutor me anymore… that’s fine.”
Crabbe and Goyle had paired. It left him alone with Malfoy. Not that, at this point, he minded but it would be weird for all others if they saw the two acting kind to one another.
Hermione and Ron had both voiced their concern for Harry and Malfoy’s latest conflict, as Harry had expected.
“Okay, I’m sorry,” Harry said, in a rush. “I’m sorry about what I said about Pansy and you. I wasn’t trying to insinuate anything at all, and I know it’s your business.”
Malfoy was quiet for a long time. He seemed to be thinking, considering, running over thoughts in his mind. He was quiet for so long, in fact, Harry wanted to march over there and shake him irritably.
Harry eyed him once more, noting that the Slytherin had pointedly put his wand away as if to signal that he was not going to do anything. “I suppose that works.”
Harry dropped down in the chair, pulled his wand out of his robe and went on to take the textbook. “Alright, let’s begin…”
Ron blinked with interest. “Oh?” he asked, straightening up with sudden curiosity. “Who is it? Where did you meet? Do I know her? Is she fit? I bet—“
Ron crawled from his chair into bed. He stretched in his too-small pajamas and leaned back. "Nah, I'm good. Thanks, mate."
They broke away for breath, but Malfoy didn't seem satisfied. He moved his head down and started kissing along his neck. Harry felt him begin to suck, bite, and lick. That caused a burn in his stomach. It was then that Harry tilted his head back and moaned.
Much as the thought pained him, Harry came to the realization that night that he would have to apologize—he winced—to Malfoy. He had been avoiding him all week, more than usual, and had even neglected to show up to their tutoring session.
“I’m not doing as bad in that class as you think, Potter,” Malfoy said. “Don’t get high and mighty on me.”
“Kind of?” he asked, raising his eyebrows as he opened the book and flipped to the proper page. He pondered this, then shrugged, “Couldn’t tell you.”
Harry looked at him crossly. “Finish my own homework tonight,” he said. “I’m trying to figure out how I’m supposed to finish my own homework tonight if I have this tutoring session.”
Malfoy exhaled shakily. Then, in a soft voice, as his hand trailed to the top of Harry’s pants, he said, “As if.”
Harry closed his eyes, realizing just how absurd he sounded at that moment. He was stuttering and repeating half of his sentences to Malfoy, who was furrowing his eyebrows in confusion.
Malfoy’s own breathing had picked up by then but he just smirked. “I could tell by the way you look at me.”
“Well, it appears Malfoy has other ideas,” Harry said. He felt bad lying to his friends, but at the same time it was not totally incorrect. Except, it felt more like a weird enemies-with-benefits but also some unadmitted feelings break-up.
On top of that, the Room of Requirement fell through. Apparently, the room did not find shagging a proper reason to be allowed in, much to Harry’s let-down.
Hermione was also sitting on the couch, book in hand, as she swung her legs. “Oh, right. Isn’t that at 6?” she asked.
Harry then tried to ignore suspicious eyes on him as he entered the Slytherin common room. It felt that all eyes were on him, which he should be used to, but also his robes felt overwhelmingly red in a mass of the dark green.
“Well. Wish me luck,” Harry said. He tucked his material under his arms. “If I don’t come back, I was killed by a pack of overly-confident Slytherins.”
“Well,” Hermione said pointedly. “Unless you’d like to fail Snape’s class, I suggest you just go along with it. Whether or not Malfoy actually wants to take you seriously should not matter.”
Their hands touched once, briefly, when flipping through their textbook and they practically leapt away from one another. Harry looked at him angrily and slipped both of his hands into his pockets.
Zabini budged back into the way. “Problem, Malfoy? I knew he was up to no good. I just knew it,” he said excitedly, as if hoping to have to back-up a fight.
“Yeah,” Ron added hurriedly. “At least you get the money from it. And, hopefully, stay well above failing in Potions.”
Harry was having a hard time focusing— yes, trolls are in fact— yes, unicorns are best known for— no, werewolves do not—they do not—and then Harry looked over.
Harry was lying on the floor with Malfoy awkwardly on top of him. Draco was staring wide-eyed. The fall seemed to snap him back to reality, causing him to appear highly horrified.
Harry barely touched his food after his kind began to turn over a number of scenarios. He instead poked at it as he tried unsuccessfully to swallow back some of the anxiety and stress he was now feeling. In that moment, he hated Snape more than usual.
Harry just finished washing up and was beginning to get ready to sit on his bed, when he heard a noise. He heard yelling between Ron and a familiar voice that made him feel cold.
Harry hardly needed to be asked twice. He edged forward and wrapped his arms around Malfoy. He breathed in his sharp scent, watching the way his mouth curved up in a knowing smirk and pulled him in.
“You don’t, do you?” Malfoy pressed against Harry’s entrance, which had been worked open skillfully.  “You don’t want all Hogwarts to know you’re a whore, right?”
They thought for what felt like a while. He thought over all the places on the Marauder's Map—and then finally, a place not on a map.
“Mr. Draco Malfoy, I believe we ought to speak after class,” said a professor with particularly long, oily dark hair; the blonde, in turn, did not take very long to cast his typical ill-tempered look at the remark. “But rest of you may go.”
His words drove Harry insane. He felt like his skin was itching and burning and his trousers suddenly felt annoyingly tight. “Fine,” he said. “Then, you have to admit something too.”
Malfoy turned on his heel and suddenly Harry realized how short he was by comparison to the other. That or the intimidating presence of Malfoy made him feel smaller than normal.
Harry watched as Draco dropped his head onto the desk and gave a short, bizzare laugh. "Hey, Potter," He tried to speak but only got out another short laugh. "You have such pretty eyes. Green."
The two got in a few good punches. Malfoy’s fist connected with Harry’s eye enough to leave a print where his glasses were. Harry’s glasses slipped off, undoubtedly damaged in some way. Harry hit Malfoy enough to leave a couple of well-placed bruises on the side of his face.
But, he couldn’t bring himself to care because Malfoy was holding onto him and he could feel his hands trailing around him lazily.
He could not stop reciting in his mind what Hermione had said to him about Malfoy—or, who she thought was a girl he fancied from a class.
Harry looked at Malfoy as though he had grown a second head. He felt like his thoughts could not catch up with what was happening in the moment.
He laughed, standing up. "Potter has green eyes!" he shouted, until Harry pulled him back forcibly down into his seat. “Did everyone know he has green eyes? Show of hands?”
It got deafeningly quiet in the room. Malfoy took two steps toward him and, for a moment, Harry feared that he would lunge at him again. He could still feel the fading bruise beneath his left eye.
When they pulled away, Harry just stood there with his arms awkwardly out where they had been on Malfoy’s hips. He felt angry, not with Malfoy, but with himself to allow him to go along with Malfoy’s antics. It wasn’t like he liked it.
With that, Harry gathered his materials in his arms and walked off. He clutched his books in his arms and stalked out of the Slytherin common room, ignoring the disdainful looks he received.
Harry just stared at him, giving him as little of a reaction as possible. “We know that’s not true,” he said. “What do you want?”
It was not an argument or a fight. Malfoy was just trying to get a reaction out of him, Harry tried desperately to remind himself. He would come around in a day or so to write it off as a joke, surely. Or maybe it wasn’t and Harry had rid of him for good.
And, he was right. Malfoy liked that quite a bit. He let out another approving sound before he continued to move his head agonizingly slowly.
For a minute, they were back to the uncomfortable silence and suddenly Harry wished he had left during the first long pause.
as to bring your ass back here so we can talk seriously?" Harry hissed, taking on him, knowing that if he insulted him, Malfoy wouldn’t move.
Harry squinted his eyes in front of the slight arrogant smile he displayed, fully aware that Malfoy was trying to calm the heavy atmosphere between them.
Shaking his head to cast off his inappropriate emotions, he turned his eyes to the potion that Pomfrey had left him the night before and held out his arm to grab it.
And it was fucking Malfoy! No way, that an asshole like that would take such a disturbing place in his life!
One of the portraits on the wall had just knocked over a mug that had now broken on the floor of its decoration and he was struggling to pick up the pieces with his hand.
He really had to get over his fucking emotions. He had been dangerous earlier and reacted like a moron when Ron explained to him why he hit him.
He observed the place where Malfoy was staying and was surprised to find that he was particularly sober.
Harry felt himself blush at the hint that Malfoy had confessed to his past self. The slow beats of his heart redoubled in intensity as he remembered these few words spoken.
Harry recognized the Janus Thickey Ward where many witches had been suffering from incurable spells for several years.
Knowing the maniac, he was convinced that Potter was going to try to escape. When Harry had an idea in his head, there was nothing to dislodge it, nothing to reason with. He was anyway, the least reasonable person Draco ever knew in his life.
A bitter little laugh escaped from his throat, in a sound strangled by the tears it contained as much as it could.
Harry laughed before he could help himself and held his arms to his ribs as he collapsed on his chair.
“I know that all too well, but I’ve changed now and I’d like to leave behind the bastard I may have been to the benefit of the person I have become today, if you don’t mind” he winced, rubbing the edge of his nose.
Draco jumped at the movement now, almost appearing nervous—even though they had already done a number of despicable things to one another. "This is stupid," He said harshly, not looking at Harry. "I should just go."
Harry, however, felt that he wanted to approach him. He was still feeling angry about how Snape had berated him regarding tutoring Malfoy.
Harry tried to reason himself back to being a tutor, a task that proved difficult. He knew that practicing with mirrors would them would allow Malfoy to become more easily disoriented, something he needed to know how to combat when studying defensive tactics.
“Yeah, right. Talk,” Ron scoffed disbelievingly. “Jinx half the Gryffindor Quidditch team, more like. I don’t buy that for a second, Harry! Do you?”
So, back to the Slytherin common room he went. Harry received several cold stares upon his entry and found Malfoy talking easily with Pansy Parkinson. She was staring at him with a dreamy, far-off look in her eyes that made Harry feel a small twinge of irritation.
Hermione pursed her lips and shook her head disapprovingly while Ron called Malfoy a few callous names.
Malfoy cast Harry a confident look. He looked far too pleased with himself and Harry was half-tempted to try to break out of McGonagall’s surprisingly firm grip.
Harry gave a long exhale. He fiddled with his wand nervously, wondering if he would be using it tonight against Malfoy—you never know with him. “I just think it’s strange. I’m good at Defense, but everyone knows Hermione is top of our class regardless.”
“How the hell are you supposed to do what?” Malfoy asked again. “I don’t feel like we are making a lot of progress on a proper conversation right now.”
“Don’t,” Harry said, and was aware of how in-pain he sounded. “Here is not the place for this sort of conversation.”
Harry, suddenly feeling brave, leaned down against Malfoy’s ear. “I want you to watch yourself get fucked, do you understand?” Harry continued, taunting him. “Imagine if your father could see you now, begging for Harry Potter’s cock.”
“Well, I hardly think you were possessed by another being,” Harry said coolly. “Use that brain now, no matter how difficult that is for you.”
Hermione pursed her lips, staring at him quizzically, so Harry hurried to make a couple of rude comments about Malfoy, and her curious look deflated slightly.
Harry turned him around hastily and yanked his pants down. He felt for his hole and, in a matter of minutes, worked him open as Malfoy groaned.
For some reason, he wasn't surprised to find Malfoy sitting near the same spot as the night before. He was slouched in an armchair outside of the Slytherin common room.
“And anyone would be able to see you behaving like a slut for me, don’t you see?” Malfoy soothed him, running a finger over his cheekbones as he continued to press against Harry. Harry could feel his pants growing tight.
“Do not patronize me, Potter,” Malfoy growled. “I’m just telling you as it is. And, I ask you not to involve yourself with my fellow Slytherins. What’s my business is just that—mine.”
Harry was now sure he was red. He began to stutter from the heat of Draco's hand just next to his thigh. "Malfoy, stop. You're going to regret doing this.”
Malfoy tilted his head to look at him quizzically and, in that process, a piece of his hair that remained ungelled fell forward. “What’s the problem, professor?”
He wasn’t sure if he liked Malfoy truthfully. He thought that he just liked… the feeling, the idea, the rush of the secrecy. But he would be willing to find out if it were more than just that. There were times, after all, when Malfoy showed his vulnerable side and it made Harry feel rather warm inside. This, of course, was something he was not eager to admit.
Ron gave Harry a triumphant look as he strode over toward him. He nodded toward the Slytherin, who was now deep in discussion with Professor Snape. “Appears as though Malfoy’s tomfoolery is finally catching up to him, you think?”
“How the hell are you supposed to do what, Potter?” Malfoy drawled, and Harry jumped. He had not heard him enter.
“Sorry,” Harry mumbled after a moment, and stepped away. “Looks good—you— your work. It looks good and correct.”
They picked up the ingredients and opened the textbook. They began to follow the instructions, carefully placing the items into the vial. After a while, a few puffs of pink rose from the containers periodically.
At first, he didn’t say anything, but watched Harry throw his books on the floor, his quills, his parchment, before falling back on his bed. He tore his hand through his hair.
"You really seemed like you didn't want to talk to me today in class," Harry replied, then added. "And you looked a little unnerved during lunch."
“You’re too cocky. Someone needs to take you down a notch,” he snarked. “I can easily learn to hate you again, believe you me.”
With that, he lifted Harry’s legs and laid him back against the desk, which was still littered with their books and parchment and ink.
“Nothing—nothing clever, which is also pretty typical,” Malfoy remarked defensively, but Harry did not miss his slight stutter. “Potter
"All proud of yourself," Malfoy went on bitterly. "All proud because you got me to actually somewhat like you. Happy now?"
Harry looked to Ron, who was staring in bewilderment. Hermione also had stopped eating and held her fork inches from her lips, mouth agape.
Harry could feel Malfoy unmoving against him. For a second, Harry thought himself absolutely idiotic for thinking this was the only way to handle the problem.
He looked at him for just a moment and knew, Merlin, he could not make a move on him. Even just saying it to himself felt awkward and unnatural. But, he did sort of want to, especially before their tutoring sessions when it was just unpacking and quiet tension of who would speak first.
That wiped the smirk off Malfoy’s face and replaced it with a look of sheer embarrassment. Harry had never seen it on his face and, for all the problems he had given Harry and his friends throughout the years, chose to relish it.
Harry pulled his robe away. “And I said it’s nothing,” he said, more firmly this time. He was surprised by how stern he had sounded and could chalk that up to the sudden panic he was feeling. “Don’t worry about it.”
The thought made him feel squirmy inside, not a bad squirmy, but a nervous squirmy. A sensation he had not felt prior to this.
Harry’s lips were burning. His skin seemed to be on fire and he couldn't really process that Malfoy, Draco Malfoy, had kissed him. For Merlin’s sake, the same Malfoy that had called him names countless times and found humor in the death of his parents had just kissed him against the wall.
Harry was shaking with anger. The week’s pent-up anger toward Snape and stupid Malfoy, who he just could not seem to get away from, was taking over and he wanted nothing more to deck him. One good solid punch ought to do the trick—
Snape continued his lesson and even when class was about to end, still no snide remark from Draco Malfoy. It was a little unnerving, honestly, seeing him so quiet and contained, but he still appeared disgusted.
“Let me get you ready,” Malfoy mumbled and, for the first time since they had begun, they made eye contact and it felt raw. It was the most gentle Malfoy had sounded yet. “If that’s okay?”
At those words, Harry felt eyes on him and noticed Draco staring at him. The blonde shook himself a bit and muttered a quiet, “Show-off.”
Before long, Harry had a fistful of blonde hair and was rutting into him roughly against the floor. An image of them caught Harry’s eye in the mirror. He could see Malfoy, with his mouth open and his eyes half-lidded as Harry penetrated him.
He was sneering and talking poorly of Ron so often that Harry would have to redirect his focus back to his wand work and incantations. This task alone was not easy because Malfoy was resolute in his negative mood.
“I…” Harry said, and closed his mouth. This was his chance to be rid of Malfoy, to put a stop to all the madness, to let this weirdness end.
“We’re going to start with a basic charm,” Harry said. “The Imperturbable Charm was a charm that created an invisible magical barrier around an object, such as a door.  Objects would bounce off of the barrier, and it also muffled sounds. The incantation is obice circa.”
Harry nodded absently and, when Malfoy didn’t walk away, only then did he realize that the other was waiting on a final kiss goodbye.
Hermione eyed him wearily. “Okay,” she said grudgingly. “If you say so. But just come get us if you need us! We won’t be far, I think we should be able to hurry back. And--”
Harry was sitting there with his head on his closed fist, unable to not smirk over at Malfoy. It was his turn to be coy. “What, you didn’t appreciate that?”
“Fuck you!” Malfoy muttered, “You absolute fucker, I hate you and your hands and your cock and your stupid personality and your—oh, yes!”
Malfoy eyed him, his arms folded again in apprehension. He stayed quiet for a moment, his mouth remaining in a tight line.
Harry found himself, regretfully, in the Slytherin common room again. This time, he didn’t feel nervous; this time, he felt annoyed and was not intending on masking it as he approached Malfoy who was sitting in the same spot as last time.
“As much as I appreciate that, I think it would be best if we stayed out of each other’s personal lives and just focus on what we are here for,” Malfoy said, giving him a scathing look.
“I have been informed that you are not terrible at Defense Against the Dark Arts,” he went on, looking at his hand as though it were particularly interesting.
Malfoy suddenly had his hand on his belt buckle, undoing it swiftly while holding eye contact with Harry. Harry, who at first stood there stiffly with his mouth parted, could only begin to help him get the rest of his trousers off.
Harry flipped to the next page. “Like I was saying, there are no cures for a werewolf bite. Not yet, anyway, I understand they’re still doing a lot of research for… Malfoy?”
"Y'know," Malfoy commented, leaning forward to inhale, "this stuff smells funny. I wonder what it tastes like."
Harry found himself irritated by this behavior. Especially when they both knew Malfoy was the one who had left his saliva and teeth marks all down the side of his throat.
Harry gasped into his mouth, not expecting this at all. And Malfoy took the opportunity to slide his tongue into his mouth. The warm sensation was new and different, and Malfoy continued to pull on his hair with one hand and stroke the
Harry stared back, eyes still wide as saucers. Their faces were only inches apart still and Draco was still partially holding him to the wall, his fingers digging into Harry’s arms through the robe.
Harry cursed himself. He should have known better to try to be nice to someone like Malfoy. He would never change and it was about time that he accepted that.
“I’d better get to bed,” Malfoy exhaled at last, his hair an utter wreck. All of the gel was gone from it. “I have quite the headache from studying.”
“Why do you like her so much? Even you could probably do better than her,” Draco argued, still not giving up. “Maybe a nice house-elf,” he mused.
“Are you kidding?” Harry asked defensively, his voice suddenly raising a few octaves. “I couldn’t be more happy to be rid of that spoiled aristocratic git.”
After a while of sitting in silence, Harry grew fed up. “Fine, I’ll just leave,” he said. He threw his arms up in exasperation.
“You coming?” Ron tapped Harry’s arm abruptly. “I was gonna meet with Hermione for lunch. They’re serving meat pie today.”
He had meandered back to the Gryffindor common room, and then into his room, where he found Ron lying back on the bed, snacking per usual. He greeted Harry brightly but seemed to notice immediately that Harry was in a foul mood.
Malfoy agreed surprisingly easily, but less than 30 minutes later, it was obvious that he was not planning on paying attention. He had his head on the desk and was pointing his wand at a glass to turn orange juice a deep blue, and then back to orange.
Malfoy exited thirty minutes prior to their first class. His hair was less gelled than usual, his eyes bright and cunning per usual, and his textbooks held to his chest.
Ron nodded slowly, clutching his hand around his wand until his knuckles went white. “I’m here if you need me, mate. Just call and I’ll be there to hex his—“
Harry noticed, which brought great heat to his face, Malfoy adjusted the front of his robes. He tried to pay no attention to that but continued to redden at the thought.
His thoughts were buzzing as Malfoy began to nibble at his neck, occasionally lapping at the soft skin with this tongue.
? Honestly, Potter, I’m not planning to ambush you. Not before I get your help, anyway,” he sneered, looking less annoyed now and more cocky—as if he enjoyed having Harry so on-edge. “I would like my money’s worth, ya’know.”
“As if you’ve never said anything bad about my mum, I think calling yours a cow is pretty tame from all the things you’ve said about mine,” Ron threw back.
Harry defensively put his arms up, hands against Malfoy’s shoulders and his eyes squeezed tightly to brace himself.
“I’m going to confront him again,” Harry said determinedly. He ignored Hermione’s pleads to just let it go. Ron even offered to take him on in a match for Quidditch but for some reason, he could not bring himself to drop it.
