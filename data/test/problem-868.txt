“No, of course not,” Harry said immediately, thinking of flight and music and curses – and the power of a mother’s love. Harry clenched a fist against his sternum, trying to pull his tangled mess of instinct and emotion out into the air, trying to weave it all into words. “I just meant – that it feels right. Magic lives inside us. I’d like to know what it looks like.”
“And?” Maeve prodded, hands still outstretched with the present balanced on top.
Draco gasped and rolled onto his back, shifting away from Harry. He rested his book on his stomach and struggled to catch his breath.
Malfoy held the flower out to Harry in careful, trembling hands. He was still clearly terrified, the hollows of his face catching the shadows and giving him a grim, haunted look. But even still, Malfoy’s entire body was alive with curiosity and wonder.
“Never for an entire duel,” Lavender said. “But yes, he uses wandless spells whenever he wants to catch me off guard.”
“Fine,” Harry said, holding his hands up in surrender. “I’ve never really liked that tea. That’s why it was all the way in the back of the cabinet.
“I’m sorry, I –” Draco reached out, but hesitated before touching Potter. He let his hand fall awkwardly to the bed between them.
To make matters worse, Malfoy and Neville had somehow partnered up.
“No, it is,” Harry admitted. He pulled off his glasses and tossed them onto the table, massaging the bridge of his nose. “I know that. And you have every right to be mad.” Harry paused, letting his hand drop into his lap. “But I couldn’t stop thinking about your Potions formulas.”
With a sigh, Draco tapped a finger against the bottle he was holding and set it down outside the tub. “I thought this would be enough to distract me,” he said. “I wanted to give you some space, since you were at the shop all morning.”
“Er –” Harry scuffed his foot against the floor and nearly dropped the pestle he was drying.
“Harry,” Draco whispered, hiding his face against Harry’s neck.
“Shouldn’t you save this gift for then?”
Turning his attention back to Harry, Draco slipped his fingers into those messy black locks, disturbingly unbothered by all the sweat.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. “And?”
“No,” Draco blurted, too forceful. He glanced nervously around the small square they stood in, but the surrounding streets were empty, the man who attacked him long gone. With a sigh of relief, Draco said, more calmly this time, “No, thank you. It’s fine.”
Eyes glinting wickedly, she reached out and plucked the lilac light as if it were a harp string.
Draco cocked his head inquisitively.
Malfoy was staring at him, eyes wide with wonder. “Potter,” he demanded, “how in Salazar’s name did you –” Malfoy trailed off with something that was almost a laugh, and shook his head.
She stood abruptly and muttered, “No, of course you didn’t.”
Harry leaned back against the wall, reminding himself that the fight was won, though the thought didn’t entirely soothe the ache.
It had taken him some time to remember the charms and Transfiguration spells they had learned all those weeks ago, but after a bit of trial and error he’d gotten the hang of it again. It was a physical kind of magic, which Harry always excelled at, and the professor had allowed them to learn by doing, so he had retained quite a bit.
Harry’s breath caught. He wondered if anyone had ever given Draco Malfoy flowers.
Draco swept his hands up Harry’s chest to cup his face, then kissed him greedily, one foot rubbing sweetly along Harry’s calf. Harry gasped, wrapping his arms around Draco to pull him on top. Their chests were pressed together, sending a shock wave straight to Harry’s heart.
Draco pushed himself against the back of the sofa, his body wanting to flee, his mind not understanding how.
apparate.”
“I didn’t know you were so confident in your bedroom skills, Draco,” Blaise said, mouth a lascivious slant.
Harry hugged him even tighter and leaned down to whisper earnestly in his ear. “And I do trust you. So much. I trust you with everything.”
not Harry Potter.”
Propped on his elbows, Harry kissed Draco tenderly, sliding his slicked cock between Draco’s arsecheeks. Draco hid his face in his elbow and let out a long, desperate moan. A pink flush had spread prettily across his cheekbones and down to his chest. He looked disheveled and sweaty and thoroughly debauched. Harry kissed along his jawline as he pressed the tip of his cock to Draco’s hole.
“Well, it’s how
“Were these always here?” Harry wondered aloud.
“That wasn’t the plan,” Ginny said breezily. “He seemed like a good choice for a fling. Something exciting to play with between matches. You know how
He swerved when another apple flew past, narrowly missing his head.
She rubbed his back, muttering soothing words until his tears ran out. He took a few gasping breaths, then straightened.
he spluttered between coughs.
“Why can’t you just tell me?” Harry asked, voice breaking.
“Don’t worry about it,” Hermione said, waving off the objection with a sunny smile. “I’m happy to help.”
“Mr. Potter!” McGonagall gasped.
“Yes, it was,” Draco insisted. “Because if I hadn’t been cruel to you, you wouldn’t have been cruel to me. You might even have been kind.” His mouth tightened. “But I still would have wanted to hurt you.”
Taken aback, he replied without thinking. “I was working through various formulas to determine the effect anti-inflammatory ingredients would have on the brewing of Deflating Draughts.”
“Right, hang on,” he said, before ambling from the room.
and he had to bite back a startled exclamation. Suddenly uncomfortable, he looked away from Draco. The air seemed to buzz as Draco hesitated, but then he stood and slowly approached the shelf.
“Ok.”
Draco gaped at Maeve, stunned.
Harry tipped his head back, gazed at the rustling branches above his head, and let himself get lost in everything that was Draco.
It was his fastest time yet.
“Where have you been wandering off to all week?” Draco asked, passing Harry a tiny cauldron. He smiled ruefully. “I know I’ve been busy, but I didn’t mean to ignore you. Have you been testing your Sentiomancy in other parts of the castle?”
Draco’s eyes flashed, and his gaze trailed after Harry’s hand. He blushed faintly and looked away. “I said, are you alright?”
He rolled over to face Draco.
Harry cried.
Harry shivered as a gust of wind whipped by, snaking beneath his collar like the unwelcome clasp of cold, skeletal fingers. He pulled his scarf more tightly around him. Ron tugged up the hood of his cloak and dug a pair of gloves out of his pocket.
“Right,” Harry said, teeth chattering. “Good.”
Ron blinked, suddenly looking uncomfortable. “S’alright.”
“Potter –” Draco started.
,” he finished, slightly emphasizing the word brew. He glanced at his cauldrons, then gave Harry a smug, sideways look.
“Of course it is,” Harry said. He scooted closer until he was hovering over Draco. He hesitated, but then trailed his fingers along Draco’s cheek. “You’re still a wizard, Draco.”
“I did it for me,” he said, meeting Draco’s eyes. “I promise, I chose for me. It’s what I want. But I knew, that wherever you went, I would still want this too.” He gestured between them, then clasped Draco’s hand. “I knew I would still want
“There’s tea in your hair,” Harry observed.
“I do,” Draco was quick to say. “But Harry, we don’t have to – that’s not why I – this potion, I mean – I didn’t mean to pressure you. I don’t have to top, ever, not if you don’t want me like that.”
Harry chuckled, feeling rather bolstered by the gesture. “Thank you, Luna. Will you tell me about the Luminosities?”
In the classroom or on the grounds with Malfoy, it was all a game – so far removed from reality that Harry couldn’t fear it. When he thought about it in the context of real life though – as a career, or in response to a new darkness that he did not yet understand – all he could remember was the relief of dying, and the burden it had been to realize he’d come back.
Things progressed rapidly after that, pieces darting around the board, striking and falling in patterns too complex for Harry to parse. Eventually, he stopped trying to follow the game and just watched Draco.
Harry shook his head. “No, not the way you mean.” He ate a few more chips, thoughtful. “I’m lonely sometimes,” he admitted, “but not for her. If that makes sense.”
Ginny leaned into him for a moment, then shifted to rest her back against the wall.
“How do you know?” Harry demanded.
Harry felt sluggish, as if he had to drag his mind tediously behind him, hoping it would eventually catch up. He would have preferred to complete this little mission last night when they’d first thought of it. The courtyard would have been deserted, after all, and Harry had been all for rushing into action, drunk on the chill night air and the gleam of Draco’s skin in the starlight. But the Slytherin had refused, claiming that it was
Harry shucked off his t-shirt, then reached out to slide Draco’s shirt off his shoulders.
Hermione leaned toward Harry, bracing her elbows on the table. “What do you miss about her?”
“Yeah?”
Harry’s eyes flared wide. “Is it bad?”
“I plan to cycle through the five wands, casting several different Dark Magic spells with each. Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy, please remain in these exact positions until I tell you I am finished. If either of you need me to stop for any reason, simply say the word and I will do so immediately. Am I understood?”
She interrupted him with a shrug. “Humor me.”
A frigid wind gusted through Draco’s window, jolting him out of the memory. He shivered and wrapped himself more tightly in the blanket draped over his lap. Enjoyable as it was to cuddle into the cushions and think of Harry, Draco was definitely beginning to regret not following Harry home.
The plants swayed in a sudden gust of wind and Harry quickened his pace. He’d taken a long run this morning, and though the rhythm of it had felt good, his chest ached from the frigid air. He was looking forward to a hot meal and a good soak in the bath.
“Cake?” Blaise, Hermione, and Ginny all yelled at once.
And Harry lost it, every last tenuous inch of control. He’d been on edge since they started, and he’d kept such a tight grip on himself that he’d trapped his magic just as surely as he had his balls.
Draco cocked his head, mouth curving into the beginnings of a frown. “No,” he said, sounding vaguely confused. “What you said was perfect. I – I just –” He trailed his hands absently over Harry’s shoulders. A moment later, his expression cleared. “Will you keep saying it? Not – not right now, I mean. Just – tell me again, sometime?”
“Yes, well –” Draco crossed his arms haughtily, trying to hide how flustered he was. “He is rather handsome.”
Draco blinked rapidly and straightened his tie. “No, I –” he started, voice embarrassingly faint. He trained his eyes on the ground and tried again. “No, thank you. That – that is very kind, but I – well –” Draco’s fingers twitched, aching for the comfort of his wand. He hid his hands in the folds of his robe and balled them into fists. “I should be getting back to work.”
“Ah, yes,” she finally said, nodding smartly to herself. “Simple enough, then.”
returned to him against all odds, beyond his every hope.
Ron shrugged. “Mate, if you want to take the ferret on walks around the lake, that’s your business. Besides, he and Hermione practically have their own little book club. He seems alright.” Ron blanched slightly. “Don’t tell him I said that,” he ordered.
A scream of agony pierced the air, cut off by the horribly familiar thump of a body hitting the ground.
the debacle with Potter, he’d disappointed Maeve, and she’d go hungry in payment for his arrogance.
The room lit up around them as Maeve waved her wand, and Draco’s breath caught.
“Fits,” Ginny finished for him.
Bewildered, Harry stared down at his plate. He was sure there was some article somewhere, if not more than one, that detailed the food preferences of “the chosen one,” but Maeve hadn’t seemed the type to go in for all that Harry Potter savior nonsense. He had liked that about her, and the idea of her reading up on him after their last meeting didn’t sit well with him.
Distracted by the muscles rippling beneath Will’s burnished bronze skin, Harry had to shake himself out of a daze. He huffed out a laugh, surprised at himself. He must be feeling jealous of Will’s indefatigable energy, which was rather silly. Putting it out of mind, Harry snatched his water bottle from the ground and chugged the remnants as he headed to the locker room.
“Yeah,” Harry agreed, a puzzled crease between his brows. “She’s hiding something. Why would she be hiding something?”
There was a pause.
Harry felt a rush of tenderness toward him. It wasn’t as if they hadn’t lain beside each other before – they had, the first night Malfoy had followed Harry to the lake – but there had still always been something stiff and guarded about Malfoy.
“Potter?” he said.
Harry moaned, his grip tightening on Draco’s shoulder. But then he pulled back, covering Draco’s hand with his own and moving it back up toward his heart.
Harry absorbed that. “So you think it’s connected? Wait, is that why you think Hogwarts is trying to tell us something? Was the Manor trying to tell you something, with the flowers?”
Maeve smiled smugly. “I know.”
Ron hummed to himself while poking around in the cupboards, finally emerging with a box of chocolate covered biscuits and a triumphant grin. When Ron plopped down on the chair beside him, Harry ignored the proffered box and pretended to be absorbed in stretching his calves.
Neither of them said anything for a time, reverting back to their normal hesitance. Malfoy seemed to be quietly seething, perhaps working himself up to another outburst. Harry amused himself watching the stormy expressions flit across Malfoy’s face. The silence was obviously driving the other man mad. Malfoy bit his lip and Harry had to stifle a chuckle.
Hermione tried to take his hand. “Harry, we’re just worried that you –”
“Yeah, you tried to tell me that when you left. I didn’t understand then, but I get it now.” Harry scrubbed a hand through his hair, resisting the urge to apologize again. “And Blaise?” he asked instead. “Is he, er – what you were looking for?”
That was Draco’s decision, and Draco’s alone.
Draco sighed again. “Fine,” he said, dropping back into his chair. “Blending Muggle nutritional science with Potions techniques is not a real academic discipline. I maintain my belief, however, that the theory is sound.”
Watching Draco work was a particular weakness of Harry’s. There was something about his quiet absorption that stirred Harry’s blood. It was almost as if Harry could see Draco’s potential writhing beneath his skin, as everything he was – and everything he could be – trembled on the verge of discovery. His manic thirst for knowledge distilled into a single, crystal-sharp point. A stillness that was as charged as any motion. To Harry, it felt like watching miracles unfold.
Hermione gave him a pitying look, but her face smoothed over quickly enough that Harry wasn’t sure he hadn’t imagined it.
A slow smile unfurled across Harry’s face, warmth pooling like caramel in his gut. The hooks bit and snapped at him, but Harry hardly noticed. Because beneath the icy chill, there was something else, and it twinkled all across the Pitch.
Malfoy propped an elbow on his knee and rested his chin in his hand, his face taking on a grave look. Harry hummed noncommittedly and leaned back against the wall of the castle. He turned his face to try and catch the warmth of the rising sun.
Reaching behind him, he pulled a sheaf of parchment out of the desk drawer and handed it to Draco.
Draco groaned and stole another filthy kiss before undoing Harry’s belt and slipping his hand inside his trousers.
Laughing, Draco shook his head. “And I bet she offered you free tea not thirty seconds later.”
“Potter?” Malfoy whispered. His eyes were pools of molten silver as he stared at Harry.
Still, even sexually frustrated, waking up next to Draco Malfoy was a wondrous thing.
Draco’s eyes flicked back to the book and Harry grinned wickedly. That was all he needed to hear.
Draco was gazing at the board in the exact way he had looked at the flower and the golden dust on the night of the Reclamation Ball. The night Harry had truly seen Draco Malfoy for the first time. The night Harry had started to fall for him.
Draco nodded slowly, and finally took a bite of potato. His eyes were still worried.
Harry briefly wondered why Declan was not at Hogwarts, but had decided not to ask. There was something subtly
Draco shook his head, nudging Harry with his knee. “You’ve been a good friend to me, Harry. I believe some honesty is the least of what I owe you.”
Draco hummed non-committedly. “Perhaps not.”
Harry groaned vehemently.
“No, of course not,” Harry said. “She’s singing along to the radio and baking croissants.”
Harry twisted out of Ron’s grip, hiding his face as he sniffled.
Determined to keep his promise to teach Draco, Harry had been testing out the different techniques he had brainstormed for working with students. He found ways to verbalize the abstract process, giving Draco an outline to follow, and even managed to use his own Sentiomancy to push against Draco’s magic and give him something specific to look for. It had been a slow process, but Draco was beginning to recognize patterns in magical residue and develop his own sense of what different spells felt like, and Harry had been able to add pages of new ideas to his Hogwarts application.
Face expressionless, Draco moved his hands to his collar and popped it open. He worked his way down the front of his shirt, unbuttoning it with brisk, efficient motions. Harry bit back a gasp when Draco let it slip off his shoulders. He pulled the shirt off and dropped it to the floor.
“I love it,” Harry said. He stroked Draco’s cheek with his fingers. “I love you.”
Draco leaned into Harry and rested his head against his shoulder. Harry shifted closer and wrapped an arm around him.
“Or you would have,” Malfoy pointed out.
She demonstrated with her finger, showing them the proper motion. “Got it?”
Draco snatched his pitiful little cup of coffee off the table and emptied it in one furious gulp. Slamming it back down, Draco rose to his feet and stormed out into the damp.
“No.” Draco shifted subtly on the sofa, angling his body away from Harry.
In the year he had worked for her, Maeve had made no secret of her disdain for the Ministry’s treatment of Draco, and she took every opportunity to assure him it was wrong. Draco did not know what she was trying to accomplish with the pointed remarks and tiny temptations. She certainly did not want him in trouble with the Aurors, and Draco was sure she would have stopped him, had he ever picked up a wand.
He could feel the ghost of Malfoy’s breath on his skin and his blood thrummed with the thrill of it. Fighting Malfoy, being bested by him, submitting to him, even – it had been like a delicious kind of foreplay. Lying in Malfoy’s bed now, knowing that Malfoy didn’t feel the same, was the worst kind of torment.
“How is your Harry?” she asked, eyes twinkling with amusement.
Something had seemed to shift between them yesterday, as they shared breakfast in Draco’s flat. There had been a warmth in Potter’s eyes that Draco had never seen before, a glimmer that went beyond the cautious hope Potter exhibited after the first apparition incident, when he’d said
“But, I –” A sharp pain flashed across Draco’s palms as he clenched his hands on the metal edge of the bench. “I mean, is that – alright, with you?”
Draco froze, a look of embarrassment crossing his face. He wiped his palms against his trousers and stepped determinedly, if stiffly, away from the wall.
Draco,” Harry exclaimed, cutting into Draco’s brooding. “This looks amazing.”
“Yeah.” Potter huffed out a breath that was almost a laugh, then shook his head. “Er – rough day.” He met Draco’s eyes and offered him a wan smile. “I’ll – I’ll do that.”
“Are you ok?” he cried, spinning Draco around and looking him over with anxious eyes. His breath came in short, panicky bursts.
He approached cautiously, not wanting to startle her. Her posture was very straight, her focus ironclad as her eyes darted across the page. Only when Harry’s shadow fell over the book did she look up, fingers tightening on its edges as if she could not bear to be pulled from the story.
“Alright, boys – up you get,” Maeve ordered. “Back to those chairs, please. I haven’t quite finished with you.”
“Merlin, fuck,
“Use your head, Potter,” Draco groaned. “I’ll admit that the Hogwarts flowers could fit this description. We found the glass flower in the Room of Requirement, where you risked your life, but that certainly wasn’t the greatest act of sacrifice that happened here.” He flinched at that callous assessment and gave Harry a sheepish look. Harry just nodded and waited for him to continue.
“Draco, I don’t want to lie to you either,” Harry said. “I wasn’t sure if I should say anything, but McGonagall told me some of this when we went to see the Room of Requirement. She told me about your donation to Hogwarts, and about you creating the war orphan organization.”
“I meant it’s not going to change this,” Harry said. “Us. How we feel.”
“Er – yeah.” Harry rubbed the back of his neck.
“It’s like a reminder,” Potter explained quietly, “that my days are mine. I get to choose what each day looks like. I get to decide. I never had that – before.”
“What,
Harry squeezed Draco’s hips. “I love you,” he told him, feeling his eyes grow wet with emotion. His fingers trailed over Draco’s belt. “Is this ok?” he asked again.
Harry felt sick to his stomach. “What?” he cried. “For how long?”
Harry bit back a gasp, realizing that Draco was not really talking about gardens.
True, a few heads had turned when they’d reached the main stretch of Diagon, but Harry had distracted Draco with questions about winter teas, and no one had actually bothered them. Draco spoke liltingly of mint and cinnamon, and he had relaxed a bit more with every step.
Harry had argued fiercely, completely unaware that Draco Malfoy was waiting in the wings, about to show Harry just how wrong he was.
“I suppose he told you, then?” Draco asked, refusing to meet Harry’s gaze. “All of it?”
came over to
The mention of Death Eaters sent a shock wave of images through Harry’s mind.
Harry untangled himself from Draco and led him to the center of the small stone labyrinth that meandered its way over the ground. When Harry pointed to the words engraved there, Draco knelt to read them.
Draco nodded minutely toward the beams of light. “It’s about honesty, then. Things we’ve shared with each other.”
and then, Harry was holding it –
Ron flipped the wrapper, to where a block of text now waited.
“‘Course,” Weasley said.
And when Harry described how he first did it – how he had felt the magic move beneath his skin – Malfoy traced a finger along the path Harry described, from his heart up across his chest and down his arm, leaving goosebumps in its wake.
Draco reached up, grazing a hand over Harry’s temple, his fingers finding their way to Harry’s scar. He traced the jagged skin lightly, and Harry closed his eyes with a small moan.
“A safe space that goes with a fitting binder and their first pair of heels or lipstick or that one book they’ve wanted since forever.” Draco stepped away from Astoria and glared at her. “I’m not cutting on the Christmas present. I’ll sell a family heirloom if I have to but this is the one Malfoy Family tradition I’m going to keep.”
“It's because of the Ministry, if you must know. Which, of course, you must—Merlin forgive the almighty Harry Potter be deprived of something he wants.” He closed his eyes, sighed, and opened them again. “I'm—sorry. I'm not—this is not who I am. I decided not to be cruel a long time ago. It's just a sensitive topic.”
“Potter, is this even your blood?” Draco hated how his voice shook for a moment.
Before your detour
“Take this to the corner of Knockturn Alley. It’s for Draco Malfoy,” Harry explained, holding the envelope out to be taken. Kreacher grumbled something about owl’s work as he hobbled over to snatch the note-come-letter out of Harry’s hand.
“I—I really wish I didn't have to say this, but—” he stuttered. “Pansy… she kind of made me promise I wouldn't tell you anything. Crap. I shouldn't have—sorry. I feel awful now.”
Hurt and bitter
The more he told himself to leave it be, hidden away under his mattress, the more he wanted to flick back through it. Well, the more his cock wanted to, in any case. But he wouldn’t. No, he was better than that, and he didn’t need to fuck his hand just because Malfoy, of all people, could pull off lingerie.
Harry laughed at that. “Count snowflakes? What on earth? You’re crazy, Malfoy. I’m glad I distracted you.”
“Er—that’s muggle music, isn’t it?”
He could move again.
Draco locked eyes with Pansy, defiant. He hadn’t thought about that, but he wasn’t about to admit it out loud. “We’ll figure that out in due time, I’m sure. Right now, all that matters is that those kids don’t spend their holidays in an environment that makes them wish they weren’t alive.”
“Well good morning my dear female presenting nipple friend.” Astoria wandered into the kitchen and pulled him into a hug. She beamed at him despite how shit their current situation was. “Did you sleep well?”
“You not being violent? I distinctly remember you punching me in fifth year, and you stomped on my face at the start of sixth year…” Harry mused, enjoying the way he could feel the two of them fall back into banter. It almost felt like they were back at Hogwarts again. “You’re not known to be a nice person, Draco.”
At this, Malfoy pushed him the two steps towards the door and out on to the step. Harry turned to protest and the door slammed shut in his face. He distinctly heard the sound of the lock slam home.
Harry was frying steak on low heat when the doorbell went. He hoped Dean wasn’t early as Hermione and Ron had yet to arrive, and he was in the middle of making dinner for one. He transferred the pan to an unlit hob and headed down the narrow corridor to the front door. When he opened it, his eyes first went to Ron, who looked noticeably uncomfortable. His first thought was that he and Hermione were having a spat, but she wasn’t present. Instead, Astoria Greengrass was standing beside him with a stoic gaze.
“I don’t—”
Harry turned off the oven and plated two of the cinnamon swirls along with two cups of tea on the table. He scowled when he realised he'd overcooked the damn things, too distracted running to the front door to turn off the oven. Trying not to think about that, about how much a part of him had wished it was Malfoy at the other side, he ran his hands over the cards on the table.
“No, I’m not.” Pansy stood before him, hands on her hips. “Even if you didn’t want to marry, which I know you do; even then, this would be a stupid idea. You will only get so much money for your ring, and once you’ve spent it, what happens next? You sell your house? Your body? Your bloody wand?”
This chapter was written by Jeldenil and Smitten! Happy New Year :)
“That- That’s neither here nor there, Potter.”
When he heard the doorbell ring, Harry immediately
“I made sure we’ll survive through the winter. And I had to spend time with Potter and Weasley.”
Christmas had always been the worst time of year at Privet Drive. Harry was bombarded with chores to make sure the Dursleys had a perfect day; serving food he wasn’t allowed to eat; wrapping presents for everybody else; hanging stockings on the fireplace, one for everyone but him. The desire to fade away still haunted him through the holidays.
“But you just said he’d changed his mind,” Harry said.
Draco squinted at her. She was acting suspiciously weird. When she just raised an eyebrow, Draco glanced at Astoria. The look on her face was… off. “What's up with you?” He asked her. “You're never this quiet unless something's terribly wrong.”
“Please Ron, do explain. It’s not like you two have been constantly bugging me to make a decision. I did. And now you’re telling me I can’t?”
, I’m well aware that fairytale endings don’t fucking exist.”
The silence that followed felt deafening and heavy.
She watched Potter’s eyes widen and could see his throat working as he attempted to suppress a cough, or a protest—really, he wasn’t being subtle. But to his credit, he only nodded while Weasley got red and spluttered audibly.
”Tell your House Elf to wake you up every two hours. You should be fine in the morning.”
Draco was not going to force her to speak despite the action plans in place. Pansy preferred to engage through doing, making whimsical crafts or cooking until bonds formed, and Draco had always envied the effortless way Astoria seemed to warm newcomers into conversation. But that wasn’t him. He preferred to offer space, time and no expectations. Not everybody that came to the house was looking for a shoulder to cry on, some just needed somewhere warm and dry to heal.
“Er, thank you,” Draco said through the lump on his throat. What had he ever done to deserve this woman's friendship?
Harry hesitated for a moment, then knocked. A worn-looking Slytherin girl he vaguely recognised as related to Daphne Greengrass answered the door.
“Sorry I’m late—something happened along the way and I couldn't make it. I'll order some chocolate, and—”
Harry smirked. “Oh, I know I do. I know what his favourite café is, and at what times he likes to go. I’ll make him an offer he can’t decline.”
They were not.
He stood with his back resting against the door, his hand gripping the ring box in his pocket. A pang of sadness shuddered through him, raising bile at the back of his throat. There was no time for regret. Potter, for whatever ludicrous reason, wanted to buy his ring—probably just to fuck with him—so Draco would have to set the proper affairs in order. His jaw was clenched so hard that the aching spurred him into proper action, heading through to the kitchen in hopes of finding Astoria.
“Please, Madam Malkin, I don't want to abuse—”
“Okay.” Harry’s mind was still very much processing everything he’d just heard, but his instincts to do good were excellent. “Okay I’ll buy your ring. Name your price and I can have the money transferred before tomorrow.”
“Can I, err, come in?”
“You’re doing Malfoy?” Harry spluttered at her deadpan question, his skin reddening as he practically choked on her words. “Relax, Potter.” How anybody thought this man desirable confounded her, no wonder Draco would rather hex someone’s bollocks off than admit his fancy; she probably would too.
“Thank you.”
“But it is my dying wish!” Draco’s heart stopped. Potter was, by all means, looking like he could give up the ghost any second. Pale, covered in blood, barely able to hold his head up long enough to look Draco in the eyes. He looked, all in all, like he was on Death’s doorstep.
“I only bought twenty, but I figured if we needed more, well… we could use magic,” she grinned, then pulled a pen out of her bag.
“Like what you see?”
A rare, primitive need took Harry by surprise. Malfoy looked absolutely edible, what with his indignant expression, his hands tugged deep into the pockets of his ineffective coat, and his nose and cheeks bright pink.
He expected Draco to falter at that, thrown off by his probably quite unpredictable response, but nothing of the sort happened. Instead Draco drew his lips into a thin line, before answering in an almost detached voice, “I’ll have Astoria send you the bank paperwork and the price and sale details. Sign the check and the ring is yours.”
Ron looked over, “He what—he can't be. Those things are like ... sacred. No pureblood would sell their ring. Especially not a Malfoy.”
Christmas giving tree.
What purpose to cling to
to see our latest invention, it’s very up-to-date!”  Fred chimed in, dragging them to the small, cramped office in the back where the twins tested their new inventions. Harry wanted to protest that he was on his way elsewhere, that he had something important to investigate, but he suddenly found himself unable to speak, his mouth magically transforming.
“Draco be realistic, please.” Astoria snapped, glaring right back. “The only sellable family heirloom that you still have is your bloody engagement ring, and if you sell that then you’ll forever give up on your ability to marry. We both know how that family magic works.”
“Talk to me.” Pansy was there, kneeling in front of her and taking her hand.
“Behold—the nipple-toe!” Fred grinned, pointing upwards to indicate a green-and-pink decoration that probably once looked like a leaf and berry. It now looked like a stabby green tit, there was no other way to describe it. Harry made a muffled sound and touched his face, feeling what much resembled a nipple where his mouth once was.
“Astonishing though it may sound, Potter… I trust you.”
' Harry snorted and skimmed through it, his disbelief growing as he read. He waved at Ron and Hermione to get their attention.
“Well I don’t see how that’s a problem.” He stuck his chin up in order to hide how much that idea hurt. He’d be giving up on his lifelong dream of a fairytale ending. But if there was one thing the war had taught him, then it was that always choosing yourself first only got you misery and pain. “There’s no one out there who wants to marry me anyway. And even if there was, Christmas is more important to me.”
The one in your mouth too quick for the one in your chest
He’d go back to the safe house.
“That seems to be the plan.”
“Auror Potter is in. He requests your assistance again, Healer Malfoy.” The nurse on desk duty gave him a conspiratory look. Draco groaned. Yesterday, Potter had come in with a sprained wrist and a list of Christmas foods. The day before that, he’d shown up with a bloody nose and a Muggle DVD about some grouchy green monster who hated Christmas ‘because it reminds me of you’. Haha. Very funny. Draco had hoped that was it. But of course, Potter came in again today. And met absolute zero resistance from the other staff in the hospital. He was Harry bloody Potter.
“I—yes, yeah.” He stepped in, shaking his coat off. “What are you—er, I wasn’t expecting to see you here,” he quickly rephrased his words. “How are you?” He tried and failed not to sound like his heart had skipped a beat. For a moment there, he’d thought Malfoy was going to be at the other side of the door.
So, there was that. He’d gotten that out of the way. Now he would never have to think about Malfoy ag—
Astoria had half a mind to leave on principle, but that wouldn’t fix
“Why would Malfoy need to sell his ring if he had this lying around?” Ron asked, clearly distrusting the motives behind Astoria’s presence. “And why not bring it himself?”
“That’s bollocks. You’re shitting me.”
Years turned into decades
When his gaze met Harry's, he was surprised to find a spark of hurt on Malfoy's eyes. Shite. He regretted asking.
“Answers, Potter. I came here for answers, not to have some friendly chit chat with you. I do have more important things to do with my time, you know?”
“Wait. You can’t walk out the examination room like that. Come with me and we’ll get you cleaned up and dressed.”
Harry's eyes flicked from Pansy to Malfoy, who was making a frantic shushing gesture at her, a look of fury on his face.
“You’re crass, Potter.”
“Well… Do I have to?” Ron’s face looked slightly purple with something resembling constipation.
“What can I do—”
“As much as I agree with your argument, Draco, I don’t agree with your conclusion.” Astoria interrupted before Pansy could reply. It was probably a good thing because Pansy did look like she could use a moment to breathe. “However much you might like or dislike him, Potter still has money and a hero complex. He could offer us a good price for your engagement ring knowing all this. And with this censorship ban in place, we at least know he can’t accidentally let something slip about this to the press and blow everything up.”
miserable?” He mumbled.
“I think these will be enough,” he said. “To be honest, I'm not sure I know twenty people who are worth writing to.”
He chose some card with a snowman on it and set to writing to the first person on the list—Molly, of course. He took his time writing to every single Weasley, then Luna, Neville, Dean and Seamus and the rest of their Hogwarts classmates—Even Parvati, though they had barely talked that year—trying not to think about what the hell he’d write on Malfoy’s card.
“Wait,” came a voice from behind him and Harry turned to see Pansy Parkinson step forward. He realised she'd been standing in the doorway watching them and he flushed slightly as he realised how ridiculous he must seem.
“This is for you to deal with now,” he simply replied. “I’m going for a bath. If you see Pansy, send her up in an hour or so.”
“Draco has reconsidered selling you his family ring,” Astoria said, interrupting. She placed her slender fingers around the mug, enjoying the heat. “I’m here to make you a different offer.” Harry’s brows conjoined in his confusion. “It’s no secret that we need money to support our friends this Christmas, and if you were anybody else we would have no doubt appealed to you for a donation. As it is, Draco would sooner—well, sell his only chance to marry—before asking for your help.”
“—find you and—” Draco spluttered. “W-what?”
Harry picked up the paper. “I wonder what he's up to,” he muttered, his full focus turning to the image in front of him.
Astoria openly glared.
Draco stepped back, glaring at the man.
“For fuck’s sake, Potter. I’d let you take your hurt head home and deal with it as a punishment, but I’m a professional. The same can hardly be said of you,” Draco said as he took his wand out of his sleeve where he’d tucked it after diffindo’ing Potter’s bloodied robes. He ran the standard diagnostic spells, finding out that Potter had a minor concussion. He handed him a potion for the pain and to speed up the healing process.
“—just messing with you, Draco—”
would be a real crime.
You didn't even know your own feet
Astoria was singing when he entered, and he could tell instantly that whatever had been plaguing her mood was now resolved, and given Pansy’s secrecy—well, he could put two and two together. Joan was at the table, decorating variously shaped dough with sugar decorations. He decided to join her, and spare himself another dressing down from Pansy that he knew he couldn’t brush off again.
“S'okay,” Harry murmured. “I understand.”
it would be a Slytherin at the doorstep. Perhaps Zabini, earrings in hand and a story about his unrequited love for Pansy at the ready. He snorted at the thought as he strode toward the door. At least this time he wasn't in his pyjamas.
happening to him.
“Um, do I?” He tried to sound casual as he ushered her inside. “Must be the heat from the oven. I’m baking cinnamon swirls.” Hermione gave him a you-only-cook-when-you’re-upset look, and before she could make any more comments, Harry asked, “Where’s Ron?” The more the merrier, after all—the more, the less able he would be to zone out and think of—
Malfoy left a trail of snow as he stormed into the living, and Harry followed him, amused. Perhaps he should've felt annoyed, or mad, or hell,
“I told you to stop talking bollocks,” Pansy said sternly, moving so she sat on the sofa and lifting Astoria’s head in her lap.
He fumbled in his pocket, thankful for the interruption. “Hello?”
Between the growing branches of our lives
Right. Harry stood outside the Slytherin safehouse, or what he’d always presumed to be some kind of sleazy hang-out for his snakey schoolmates. It wasn’t. Apparently. But what was it then? He looked at it, confused. It looked really unassuming, grey and narrow and outwardly reminding him a bit of Grimmauld Place, but more modern. Inside it had seemed warmer, busy and bright with more people living there than he’d have thought likely. But… poor. It was well-kept, but he’d seen the way the walls had needed paint, the rugs were worn beyond what magic could fix, and the inhabitants all looked tired and in need of a good meal or two.
Harry rolled his eyes but stepped to the side nonetheless. “Of course. Come in.” In a lower voice, he added, “Prat.”
He couldn’t remember the first time it happened. He’d been too young. Later, his Mother told him he’d woken her up with his cries.
is a female presenting nipple?”
“I’m alright, mate,” Ron said, heading towards the kitchen. Astoria followed, leaving Harry to enter the kitchen last. “Steak. Nice.”
Hi! Marina here! These three parts were written by Jeldenil, Quicksilvermaid and me (not necessarily in that order!) Can you guess who wrote which part? ;)
“They’ve taken Dean! Dean’s been arrested!”
Seeing Malfoy from a distance was somehow not the same as being in close proximity to himself.
It must have been hard to find your way without a compass
Harry boggled at Ron.
Tiresias looked at him expectantly, and Harry desperately tried to remember the names she’d said so he could just pick one and be over with it. “Er…”
Friends. He really had said that word out loud, hadn't he? Well, he didn't regret it. Ever since he'd realised he didn't know Malfoy anymore, he'd been feeling… off-balance.
“He has,” she lied. “I’m not here on his behalf any longer now that his ring is no longer available. Instead, I came to ask if you would buy something else.”
Once he was positive his arm wasn’t going to give him more trouble, he left for Diagon Alley. He spent the day buying Christmas presents for the few people for whom he didn’t have anything yet—Percy, Fleur, Hugo, Victoire. There was a strange kind of magic to shopping by himself in winter, and he arrived home that night feeling warm inside despite the weather. Fulfilled. Happy.
“I’d like a cup of tea,” Astoria told him, heading towards the table. She perched on a chair and crossed her knees, her hands resting atop her bag which lay on the table in front of her. Harry spun around, momentarily forgetting where his kettle was. Before he knew about Malfoy and his safe house, he would have been too self-conscious about the standard of tea he had, but given the entire situation, he doubted Astoria was about to complain. He made her a cup of tea in silence, turned off the stove, and put some biscuits on a plate before he sat down at the table opposite Astoria. Ron sat beside him, automatically reaching for the biscuits.
“I am. And my head really does hurt.”
“Draco Malfoy, you know you don’t have to ask. What colour?”
“He’s tired, Pans,” Astoria said sadly, “you know he feels responsible for every person who walks through these doors.” Pansy sighed loudly and scratched her cheek, her eyes hardening as she got caught up in her thoughts. “I have to go, Potter is waiting for me,” she lied.
But what really hit him with the force of an avalanche was the sudden knowledge, inexplicable, that Potter was gone.
“Yeah it is.” Harry had to use all his strength to stop his voice from shaking. Wording what happened in his past like that was never easy, no matter how much time had passed. “That’s not what I came to talk about here though. I mean, it’s one of the reasons why I’m interested in what you’re doing, but this meeting isn’t about me, or you actually. It’s about money and homeless people as far as I understand.”
“What is going on here, love?”
Draco sat at the edge of the cushion, a pinched expression between his perfectly shaped eyebrows. Pansy’s words were still rampaging through his mind and his anger only magnified the injustice.
“Give me a day,” Astoria pleaded. “If by this time tomorrow I still haven’t managed to find another way, I’ll write to Potter.” Draco’s eyes hardened at hearing Potter’s name. He was going to argue against Astoria’s request but then he was forced to hide a yawn behind his hand. He was exhausted.
And now he couldn’t even fucking advertise for that because of the ministry and their damned
Potter was his soulmate.
“So, he’s going to sell his engagement ring. To buy some gifts and food.”
“Terrific! We’ve been baking all morning, me and Theo and Joan, and ohmygosh, you won’t believe the amount of amazing music they keep in this house! Anyway, how’s Teddy? You’re going to see him today at the Weasley’s, right? Tell him he needs to reply to my owl, I know he’s being a lazy twat about it!”
At Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes at least business seemed to be booming as usual. The red-headed twins were zooming around in their shop, appraising their Christmas Classics, like the brawling balls—red and green baubles that shouted creative (but still ‘family friendly’) insults from the Christmas tree, singing string lights, and indoor snowballs. Another classic and usually a big hit. The naughty nativity—which displayed Mary, Joseph and the tree Muggle kings in rather… compromising positions, was now nowhere to be seen.
"So..." He started.
Pansy shrugged. “Not more than seeing Astoria suffer like this. She hasn’t been close to her family since we married, but she still has a family, after all—one she’d rather not lose for good. My parents, on the other hand, fucked off to America as soon as they were released from Azkaban. I’m sure their family heirloom is the last thing on their mind.”
It really was a shame they couldn’t run the in-depth research she’d done on mermen’s reproductive rituals, as it featured several explicit, but absolutely necessary illustrations. But she was most regretful about having to scrap the monthly advice column with Draco’s thoughts on readers’ questions about gender and sexuality. With a sigh, Luna pushed away from the desk and looked out of her window. If she wasn’t mistaken, Seamus was approaching her home—and he was alone. How odd.
But it wasn’t snowing, and anyone who walked out of the house would see his footsteps imprinted on the settled snow.
Since what should have been
“To speak with Potter about some jewellery,” she replied. “Draco’s upstairs, he wants to see you.”
“Luna…” Seamus’ lip trembled slightly and she immediately wrapped her arms around him. “What can we do?!”
Potter for growing up to be fit, even if he still was a stumbling idiot. “Not unless he has more money than I know about. This ring has been in my family for over a millennium. Word will be out soon enough, and we’ll get a much higher price. This kind of magic doesn’t come on the market all the often.”
“Well, that doesn’t make much sense, now does it?” She said rationally, handing him her stress-relief squishy nargle plushie. Seamus’ face became a little less red as he took it, practically squeezing it entirely flat at once. “He’s an artist, not a vandal.”
Harry squinted, suspicious. “If you want to sell me another heirloom, I’ll have you know the
Draco arrived back at his house in a deflated mood, thoroughly exhausted. How could Potter still take everything out of him?
Harry wracked his brain for some reason that didn't make him sound half-mad. He had just realised he'd come to Malfoy's house to—
The idiot had been staring at him. It had irked Draco to no end, and he was fairly sure he had sneered into his coffee once or twice as he fantasized about approaching Potter to taunt him, just like in old times.
Honestly, if he didn’t react so erruptively then Pansy would have nought to tease him with. Opening the door, Astoria pulled her shawl tighter together; the nipping breeze and Potter greeting her.
“See, why Astoria decided to sell you her own heirloom instead of Draco’s is beyond me.” Parkinson deposited the bracelet on the table, then looked him in the eye. “But it’s making her miserable, and I don’t want that for my wife. So I’m selling you mine.”
“—maybe if you stopped yelling over me for five seconds—”
Harry woke in a light sweat, his left arm outstretched and shaking. It had been nearly three weeks since the last episode, and he’d foolishly began to hope they’d disappeared for good.
“Okay, kiddo. I trust you.”
safe space, Pansy. We tell people who need it and Potter
It hurt that time, and Draco had cringed in agony on the stands, knowing something must have gone very, very wrong but unable to raise the alarm without risking his secret getting exposed.
“Harry, are you okay? I’m not blind, you know. I know there’s something bothering you.”
“Kreacher is not bringing this letter to Knockturn Alley.”
Foundation could help, and then… what? Offer to buy the ring? That doesn’t solve the magical contract problem.”
Harry set about serving her while she spread out the cards on the table.
The attic was her sanctuary. The horizontal slats of the roof were decorated with various bits of coloured tinsel, and the grey leather sofa housed a knitted blanket and two decor pillows she had made herself. Behind said sofa, there was a desk. In the cupboards, she would find receipts, expense and budgeting forms, and a square box that was practically flat.
“Har fucking har,” Draco shouted, throwing his hands up in the air with as much dramatic flair as an actor as he stalked away from Pansy. “You’re both just so bloody hilarious today,” he sneered. “Meanwhile, I and countless others are worrying about more important matters.”
“I can't be sure,” Draco said, and now he knew with definite certainty that Potter was cold, too.
“Yeah, it’s a giant mess, isn’t it? Blaise is still sorting out the details but as far as I can see anyone who hands out our information leaflets after the seventeenth will get fined at best and might even face jail time. And we’re already low on funds as it is.”
The world open at last
“Watch where you’re going with that - gross! Look at my trousers! They’re ruined! You uncivilised, irresponsible tool!”
Pansy snickered, but her hand twitched around Astoria's—a gesture Draco recognised as one of encouragement.
“You don’t? That was me complaining just now, Potter.”
didn’t sound like enough,
Potter turned around, the largest shit-eating grin on his face.
Malfoy's scowl deepened as he raised his chin at Harry, arms crossed over his chest.
“You… you have snow in your hair,” Malfoy stammered, making Harry blink.
“We don’t have time, we’ve exhausted all of our options.” He pulled away, his gaze torn. “I need you to deal with this.” Astoria frowned and was about to try dissuading him again. “We don’t have time,” Draco repeated, his tone sharp. “The first of our guests will be arriving in a few days. We need the money.”
need to be the one deciding where I spend the money on. For once in my life, I know what I’m doing and the last thing I need is for you to swoop in, trying to be the saviour with your money and boy hero status and muck everything all up. So stop fucking assuming anything about anything because you don’t understand it now and you probably never will. Stop inviting me to coffee places expecting a cosy chat after coming in half an hour late. It’s not what I’m here for. Either buy that stupid ring or don’t, but keep your nose out of my business.”
He forced himself to breathe deeply into his belly. He wasn't having an anxiety attack. Not in front of Malfoy.
“Yeah…” Harry muttered. He wished he could feel mature, but all he could think about was what Hermione’s face would look like if he told her he’d wanked to some bloody pictures of his
When she didn’t say anything, but rather inspected Teddy’s old drawings on the walls, Harry felt the need to break the silence. “Do you want a brownie?”
“Thank you,” Luna replied absent-mindedly, pouring herself some tea as she worked on a detailed sketch of erumpent anatomy. Her desk was covered in papers—she really wasn’t the best with organising, but she knew where everything was, and that’s what mattered. She would meet with Dean later so he could help her edit—it  truly was quite wonderful to have friends.
Draco swiftly turned to his friend. “Were you? What on Earth for?” She’d better not been trying to get his ring back, or he’d swear—
My username (OTPshipper98) appears as a chapter co-creator because I'm the one posting the chapter, but I didn't write any of these parts.
“Pans… don’t. Please. I got the money and I saved Draco’s ring. But I swear—he can’t know, okay?”
“That's what I would have thought up until a few hours ago, too,” said Harry. “But… he is selling his wedding ring to help other people, after all.”
Harry took a moment to digest what he'd just heard.
“Will do.” She’d led him into the living as she talked, and when Harry didn’t add anything further, she made a little excited jump and went for a pile of LPs stacked under the stairs.
“I changed because I fucking lived on the muggle streets searching for food in a trash can. And it fucking sucks that you’ve been abused and I hate the fact that that happened to you but that gives you no right to come into my home with an attitude like this. Like you know me well enough to assume anything about what I’m doing. I put that fucking add out because I wanted money for something I won’t even explain to you because you clearly already made up your mind about everything. I put it out because
“18th-century heirloom. It’s in peak condition and has been passed down through generations,” she told him, leaving out the fact that it was her family heirloom.
Harry sipped his tea. “Like take care of strays, yeah, I know. I’m just trying to—”
He straightened his clothes and brushed his hair with his fingers, practically running towards the door. He pulled it open with a nervous smile, and—
If he had Seamus for company, people might stop bothering him all the time.
“Don't call them that,” Malfoy cut in. “They're not ‘strays’. They're
Three hours and several heavy shopping bags later, he returned home. Getting the items he wanted to gift to his friends had cheered him up significantly, and he’d all but forgotten about Astoria’s quiet mood from earlier. Getting home to a dark and seemingly deserted house reminded him, however, and he quickly put his purchases away before checking all the rooms and calling out to his friends. At last, in the kitchen, he found Theo, so absorbed in his cooking that he hadn’t heard Draco return home.
“You were inconsolable. It was only the next day that we found out the Dark Lord had been vanquished, and we forgot about your mysterious woes. It didn’t happen again.”
“Which is?” Harry asked.
“Potter?” It was Zabini behind him, sporting light blue robes and fake reindeer antlers. “Theo, you owe me two Galleons!” He shouted over his shoulder, then grinned at Harry. “He bet I’d be the last Slytherin in this house to see you around. Loser.”
“I am,” he admitted. At the look of chastising on her face, he added, “Sorry for not coming earlier. We've had a bit of a financial problem this year, and—”
“I need to put the papers somewhere safe,” she managed, and then slammed the attic door shut behind her. Downstairs, she could hear Draco stomp to his own room, leaving Pansy to wonder who to tend to first, most likely.
It kept happening during most of his school career - seemingly random bouts of sudden cold, and it took him two more years to figure out that whenever it happened, it had something to do with Potter having been in danger of some kind. In the library, he found what it meant somewhere in an ancient tome nobody had touched in many years, judging by its layer of dust.
Ignoring the pain that soared through his chest, Draco left for Diagon Alley first thing in the morning. It was Friday, and the kids would return from Hogwarts on Saturday, which meant they had one day to buy enough food, presents and logs of wood to keep everyone fed, happy and warm through the entirety of the holidays.
Harry let the motorbike slip and turned, putting a foot down on the street for balance. He was grateful for his sturdy boots, because the street was slippery and treacherous. There, on the sidewalk and slightly spattered with greyish slurry, stood nobody other than Draco sodding Malfoy.
It was three days before Christmas day when Draco received a letter from Gringotts. The remainder of Potter’s money had been transferred to his vault.
could be worse than marrying Malfoy,” Ron muttered. “Imagine that. He's probably the kind of guy who sleeps with cucumbers on his eyes and orders you to make him breakfast while he kills kittens as his morning workout routine.”
Harry and Hermione shared a look.
“You wish,” Harry muttered to himself. After a second, he made up his mind. “Okay, this is what we’re going to do. You're going to take off your coat and have a seat. I’ll make us some tea, and we can have a friendly conversation and behave like the grown-ups we are.”
“Maybe you could… no, wait, nevermind. That's a bad idea.”
“Okay, don’t worry, you don’t have to go. We can take care of it.” Hermione looked up at Harry, her eyes big with concern. “Well, actually… can you take care of it, Harry?”
He had not expected to blurt that out, at all. And by the looks of it Draco hadn’t either. He just sat there, eyes wide, mouth hanging open just a crack, looking utterly shocked. To his credit though, the man only needed five seconds to pull himself together and mould his expression back into something Harry could only call professional. It gave him a slight therapist-y vibe and he didn’t like that one bit. Though given the fact that Draco ran a safe house it made some sort of sense.
Harry had never been allowed to listen to music at the Dursleys’. He hadn’t been interested in it during his Hogwarts years, either, or the ones he’d spent as an Auror. But ever since his accident, he’d taken to listening to wizarding music on the wireless from time to time.
Excited, he pushed his way back home, eager to tell Ron and Hermione what he’d found out. They’d be happy, right?
Harry scanned it quickly. It was the usual request he got at this time of year—money to save the blast-ended skrewt or to buy new instruments for the Hogwarts toad choir or to advance the political campaign of some Minister or other.
Silence stretched on for a few seconds as they both waited for the other to speak, and then Draco sighed to himself, feeling the tiredness seeping through his earlier motivations. Potter would have to wait. “Come and sit down, I’ll get us some tea,” he said, moving back over to the couch.
Could it really be a safehouse? And if so, for whom? Besides Malfoy, nobody he recognised had been an actual Death Eater. Not even Parkinson. She’d said it was for people who got ‘cast out for who they were’, whatever that meant. Was it only for Slytherins, or could other shunned people find refuge there too? Did it matter?
Potter raised his eyebrows simultaneously as his gaze returned to Astoria.
“Of course, dear.” Madam Malkin strode towards the little door behind the counter and held it open for him. He sat down as she cast a
Just that moment, his phone started ringing.
Pansy wasn’t dense, she could tell something was up—something Astoria didn’t want to tell her. Usually, she would demand to know what was going on, but then Astoria didn’t often keep secrets—there must be a reason.
Harry was momentarily distracted by the thought of Snape teaching first years how to stare through people.
, and he’s drooling all over himself like a school kid.”
And suddenly, Potter was there, in the castle. Draco lost sight of him soon after Severus fled, but he only had to follow the cold to find him back, in the room of Hidden Things.
Free to go
How many lives had been lost
Potter sighed at him.
He’d started it a little over five years ago after seeing the stupidly cheesy yet inspiring quote,
Knowing he needed to eat, Harry hung his jacket up in the hall on route to the kitchen, only stopping to take the letter from Seamus out of his pocket. Dean had managed to get some commissions from Fred and George, so he would stop by Grimmauld tomorrow evening instead which boded well for Harry as the only thing he could think about was Malfoy and whatever he was up to.
“Okay…” Harry processed her words. “Okay, yeah, fine—I’ll buy your heirloom.” At the look of relief on her face, his determination grew stronger. He had one more question, though. “May I ask why you’re telling me all this?”
The box was what she retrieved, and though her heart yearned to take the contents out, she couldn’t bear the thought of refreshing her memory before she sold it. Maybe she could buy it back from Potter one day, something Draco would never do.
Harry was already on his feet.
He laughed out loud. “Have you ever read a bigger load of shit in your life?”  He kept reading down it, “What is this? It's talking about restricting free speech ... art ... female presenting nipples? What
“Ugh! Wait! Fine! I’ll come with you. But only if it’s a proper date.” Draco hardly believed his own nerve.
“Why?” he asked.
“And then Mrs Smith said I looked
“He’ll be by in an hour,” Hermione said as she hung her coat up. “I brought some Christmas Cards for you to write in, I know what you’re like.”
As predicted, she was sitting in the corner by the window; her knees tucked up underneath her as she nursed a cup of tea in one hand and a novel in the other.
“I’m… sorry?”
She chucked the paper back on the desk and it fell open. “It's ridiculous and totally over the top. They're trying to address a very niche issue and instead of using a scalpel it's like they've taken the entire media system and just decided to light it on fire. They're going to be stopping people from handing out pamphlets on the street—”
Astoria huffed, her expression dark. “The only thing that's terribly wrong here is your makeup, dear.”
The first thing Draco saw when he headed outside his bedroom the next morning was a piece of parchment on the floor. Someone must have slipped it under the door during the night. He cast a few spells on it from a distance—one could never trust anything that came from Knockturn Alley—then picked it up and sat on the sofa.
Knockturn Alley was the same as every other day of the year, except for the fact that the smell of dampness and piss blended with that of smoke from the chimneys of the buildings. Harry idly wondered what they were all cooking as he approached the Slytherin safehouse—perhaps a twisted, poisonous version of gingerbread men?
Within minutes, he had regrown the fire and was pouring mugs of steaming liquid; Joan sitting mutely at his side with wandering eyes. She looked to take in everything in sight, her bottom lip caught between her teeth as whatever thoughts plagued her awake at such an hour.
"I wasn't going to—"
). But he wasn't going to listen to him.
Astoria eyed him with skepticism. “Fine then. If that’s the truth, then sell the ring. But I don’t support this idea.”
“I—I did not know that.” Draco visibly swallowed, and it was only then that Harry realised something. Malfoy was wearing lipstick. And quite daring, red lipstick at that. He was so distracted by it that it took another customer brushing past him before he realised he had yet to sit down. “That’s quite awful.”
Our muscles didn't remember
A wartime strategy
“Oh fuck off Pansy,” Draco spat as he pushed past her a little too harshly. “I do
Merlin, the blonde prat got under his skin.
It’d been a long time since he’d felt in control of anything, and he’d craved it. The motor provided just that; full control, with the aid of a little magic. It listened to his slightest motion, his softest whisper, like his Firebolt used to do during a Quidditch game.
“Is there a way out of it?”
“It’s my money to decide about. Do you have the paperwork?”
Your jaded muscle memory
No. That was not the reason he should stay and face Draco Malfoy. He wasn’t a bloody coward. He was Harry Potter. He’d killed a Basilisk. He’d defeated Voldemort. And most importantly, he held the record for the most liquorice wands swallowed in under five minutes in the Weasley family. He could do this. He could do
“It can't possibly be worse than marrying Malfoy.”
In that moment, Harry regretted freeing Kreacher more than he'd ever regretted anything in his life.
Hello there, Jeldenil here. This chapter was written by Marina (OTPshipper98)  and me.  Enjoy!
The ambience of Madame Malkin's always brought Draco childhood memories, even though he was still a regular customer. It was warm, organised, smart—just like Madam Malkin herself.
“It is. I just...I went out to count them. The snowflakes. I-  You made me lose count.”
And the selfish part was rapidly turning out to be not true at all.
When a bunch of Gryffindors showed up in the Main Hall by the end of the day, the feeling had passed and he got distracted by hating Potter for stealing his House’s rightful glory.
“Okay.” Draco nodded. It was about time the kids started to show up. It had taken longer than usual. He blamed the restrictions on advertising. But it was good to know some of them could still find their way. He’d have to find out more about this new girl soon, if only to buy her a present. He went about checking the other things. The girls had picked up enough wood to keep the fireplace going for a week. Blaise had almost finished doing the beds—and apparently ran out of acceptable linens.
As per usual, his first batch of brownie mix ended up on the floor—but the second one made it to the oven. The rhythm of cleaning up as he baked set his mind right and, as he exercised his left arm with mediocre tasks, the shakes slowly let up. That, along with the delicious smell that filled the kitchen, allowed him to relax, and he tried to remember what it was that he’d been dreaming about. The only two things that came to mind were a looming feeling of anxiety and... and Malfoy. The prat had probably been attacking him with a curse if his usual nightmares were anything to go by.
Astoria moved out of the way as Draco came at her, his intention to leave the room was clear. Well, if he didn’t believe her before; he was sure about to lose his voice. The kitchen door thumped as it was thrown open and Draco stormed out, muttering irritably to himself like a bloody lunatic. Pansy folded her arms in a sultry fashion as if she had known all along who would win this battle.
“Er, good evening,” he said, ignoring the feeling. “What brings you—”
Complete silence overwhelmed him. The world around him had frozen. He could feel, but not hear, the erratic rhythm of his heart. It was pure panic.
The hours passed slowly until 4 pm. Draco didn't tell anyone about his dat—meeting, about his meeting with Potter. He merely told them he had to see someone, then excused himself with enough time to change into decent clothes before leaving. He wanted to feel confident, and brave, and so he put on his favourite pair of boots and his warm, fluffy hat that made his haircut look nice. He looked in the mirror and smiled to himself—but he couldn't ignore the little voice inside his head telling him something was missing. In an impulse, he grabbed the lipstick bar from his bedside table and expertly applied it before leaving the house.
The man was shivering in a too-thin navy coat, presumably picked for style, and his whiteblond hair was mostly hidden under a large woolen hat. His grey eyes pierced Harry’s in a defiant challenge.
know Draco Malfoy. Which was a terrifying thought. Harry only had a few constants in his life. Namely, Ron was his best friend, Hermione knew everything, Mrs Weasley was trying to give him diabetes and Draco Malfoy was a selfish git.
Harry had bid Ron and Hermione goodbye that night with clear intentions, although his friends still weren’t quite so confident in his charismatic abilities—especially when it came to likes of Draco Malfoy. Nevertheless, Harry went straight to his living room coffee table and scribbled out a letter in grey ink that gave the impression of a led pencil.
“Sounds like fun,” he said. He wasn’t sure if it did or if he were humouring her, and he was far too tired to decipher his intent with Pansy still shooting cool daggers at him. “I need to get changed, I’ll be through shortly.” This was enough for Joan, who left them, heading back down the hallway to the kitchen.
“Right,” Pansy muttered. “I’ll see you later then.”
, he panicked.
“Seamus, give him a kiss—so his nipple can tell us whether it’s male or female presenting,” George instructed, pushing a red-faced, madly giggling Seamus towards Harry. Harry rolled his eyes—it was all he could do—and endured a quick peck from his friend.
Foundation. For the first time in a very long time, Harry had felt like he was in control over his life.
“Please, Pans, I’m just tired.”
doesn’t need a fucking safe space. A mental hospital maybe, but not this.”
“Oh, but I think it is.”
. Well, he was being that person now, out and proud with his female presenting nipples and shocking content. But if the ministry continued to make rules like this there would be no one around to witness it.
Or fleeing far from it
Diagon Alley was filled with Christmas lights and decorations of all sizes and colours. The cheerful voices of excited children were accompanied by a choir of old people who always spent the morning of Christmas day singing carols under the awning of Flourish and Blotts, and the music, as well as the scent of recently baked gingerbread, followed him as he walked down the street.
He gripped the cushion on either side of his legs and glared into the simmering glow of the fireplace. It was late, very late, so late, in fact, that you could call it early. He wasn’t able to sleep though, not with his home becoming an imbroglio of ‘don’t ask’ and silent conversations. All thanks to Potter. The impertinent fool just had to stick his saviour complex into everyone else's business, didn’t he? Mindless twit.
She hurried to the door, sensing something was off, and when she saw Seamus’ face, she knew she’d been right.
“Unexpected, yes I know. For the Draco that you know it definitely is, but I am hardly the same person as I used to be at Hogwarts. You wouldn’t be able to name a single fact about me even if I put a gun to your head.” Draco suddenly got quite red when he said that, making his cheeks match his lipstick. “Not that I would ever be violent, it’s just a saying.”
“Potter is going to buy my ring,” he announced, taking it from his pocket and slamming it down on the countertop. “I need you to contact him with payment details.” Astoria rose, closing her book, and made her way over to Draco with a concerned gaze.
Pansy’s words from the previous day inevitably flooded back into his mind.
Sound returned to him, in a jumbled, overpowering whoosh.
“A chest binder,” Draco said simply. “I know they’ve wanted to have one for a while now, and I’m worried they might start looking for homemade binding methods that could be bad for their health, so I need something that—”
He didn't hear the twin sighs Ron and Hermione gave at his words.
“What about the girls?”
Comments are very much appreciated <3
and flicked through it idly, hoping something would jump out at him for the
“Oh, you call that soiling?”
“You leave me no choice, Draco,” he said and made to walk to the door in his underwear and covered in blood.
It wasn’t even 8 pm yet, and Harry had washed the kitchen countertops down, done three loads of washing, ironed the living room curtains, and baked some cinnamon swirls with orange zest toppings. He felt taxed, given he hadn’t stopped for a single beat until the cinnamon swirls were in the oven—and then he’d had to pace all the while because the dishes had been done and put away, the radiators had been bled, and there wasn’t a spot of dust anywhere for him to clean.
“Yes, Harry, it’s stupid, we know.”
This chapter was written by Jeldenil and Smittenwithdaydreams :3
“No.” Draco’s reply was sharp and allowed no counter argument. “Our busiest time is Christmas because a lot of people come here to celebrate the holidays when they have nowhere else to go. We can’t skim on the one moment of the year when our guests can be themselves.”
Not that he’d expected much of anything at the time. His life had been so… empty, back then. Dating Ginny, joining the Aurors—it had all felt like too much, too fast.
“Hmmm.” Draco shook his head in confusion. Astoria going to see Daphne was suspicious. The two of them hardly spoke nowadays. Daphne got herself a nice conventional marriage to a dull Danish Pureblood named Jon Jensen—and although they hadn’t had a fall-out or anything like it, their lives were just too different. Something must be very important for her to go for a visit. He’d have to ask her about it once she got home.
Harry grinned.
Not Harry. He was enjoying an, admittedly risky, ride on Sirius’ motorbike, slipping and sliding dangerously through the sludgy streets. Where he went, people were staring and muttering their disgust with such a reckless youth. Someone shouted “Oy, got a death wish?” but Harry just laughed at them. Nah, he was past that kind of thing. Couldn’t he just enjoy the thrill of the ride, the roar of the engine between his thighs, the powerful feeling it gave him?
“This won’t cost you any extra money,” she cut him. “I’m here to buy Astoria’s heirloom.
“I’m afraid it’s not, Harry, it’s a Pureblood thing. Magical contract. You know magical contracts.” Hermione tried to sound patient, he could tell.
Harry halted, frowning. He hadn’t really thought of that yet. Dean was making a living with his art, and most of it wasn’t exactly family friendly. In fact, the majority of his customers wanted nude and explicit artworks for their private chambers. It was his speciality.
Hermione frowned at the carpet, still deep in thought. “Forget about it. I'll come up with something else.”
But he couldn’t lie to Hermione. She’d find out sooner or later. And… and whether he liked it or not, the idea of not seeing Malfoy again felt alarmingly wrong.
Preventing imagined damage by means of self-inflicted wounds
Harry opened his mouth and then closed it after a moment.
Diagon Alley was flooded with the usual pre-Christmas shoppers, and everywhere around him Harry could hear people discuss the latest Ministry decree like it was hot gossip. In fact, he couldn’t recall the public being this interested in policies since the war. It was a bit disturbing, really. He pushed his way through the masses with some difficulty, trying to ignore the continuous pleas for their Saviour to
Malfoy glared at him. “Aren't I supposed to be the Slytherin here? And what makes you think you have any right to get to know me?”
“You’re good at this,” Draco told Joan who shot him a curious look when he chose a candy cane shape to decorate. They sat in silence, Joan occasionally watching what he did and pointing to different decorations to use when he hesitated. Draco figured she would have told him everything he was doing wrong if she vocalised her conversation, but her reticent continued unspoken of.
“Are you sure Luna’s ok?” Harry asked, nudging Malfoy’s shoulder to get his attention.
“What about the tea shop?” Harry asked, suddenly queasy at the thought of Draco losing the little workshop that seemed so much a part of him.
at ease with Draco despite the vulnerability he had shown in the night. It was – baffling. Unsettling. Terrifying. And also,
Harry slipped a hand into Draco’s hair. “I wish I had known.”
“Thank you?”
“That’s not what I asked,” Malfoy replied, quieter still. “Do you
Flames rose in Draco’s chest.
“Potter?” Draco hovered over him, an adorable waver to his voice.
The sink overflowed, spilling water onto the floor, but neither of them moved to shut the tap.
“Wednesday, then.”
Draco smiled into his cup and did not pull his foot away.
Harry rested his forehead against Draco’s, smoothing his thumbs over Draco’s cheeks. And then, without any warning, he swept an arm behind Draco’s knees and scooped him up in his arms. Draco gave a strangled yelp of shock and delight, before protesting loudly (and insincerely) as a beaming Harry carried him up to bed.
“Are you still interested in becoming an Auror?” Draco asked. “Is that why you’re training with Lavender?”
He sounded so wistful, so suffused with longing, that Harry was taken aback. “Right
Harry immediately stilled, but he was confused by Draco’s hesitance.
“The door appeared,” Draco repeated. “When?”
“We’re not,” Draco said, rubbing his cheek against Harry’s. “We’re talking about potions.”
He went obediently, though he did wonder why Maeve hadn’t sent this new applicant back to the workshop, as she had with all the others.
Over tea and biscuits, Harry filled McGonagall in on everything that had happened, including how the Room of Requirement had so cleverly illustrated all the ties between him and Draco. Obviously intrigued, McGonagall had asked shrewd questions about the magic George and Maeve had used, and Harry got the impression that she would be open to new ideas if Maeve ever made good on her threat to speak to her about the Hogwarts curriculum.
really good at Defense.”
Draco rolled his eyes, but he was still smiling. “Nonsense, Potter. It was hardly a scratch. The tea is more important.”
The numbness that had descended, flooding his veins like a tributary of the miserable river he was still staring at, retreated now, fleeing the renewed rage that burned ever outward from Draco’s wronged and withered heart.
“No, Maeve,” he said decisively. “Thank you, but I’m fine.”
“Draco,” Harry said, “I don’t know what this means, but the hooks – I think you’re immune to them.”
“So every time I get another letter like that,” he went on, “I just shove it in a box. Anyway, like I said, I’ve been thinking about what I should do. And I thought if I went through the letters, maybe I’d find something. Something good. They can’t all be horrible, right?”
. Something that smelled of a forest in the springtime, fresh and green, clean as rain. Harry breathed deep, relaxing as that horrible, hollow feeling seemed to bleed out of him.
“No,” Harry said emphatically. “Never. I have no idea where that came from.”
Draco frowned and shook his head. “No. We’re doing this now,” he said adamantly, leaving no room for argument.
Harry was frowning slightly at Hermione and he began to fidget in his chair. Draco hurriedly let go of Harry’s knee and leaned toward Hermione.
“Nothing irreversible,” she replied jauntily. “Now hush.”
Harry understood that, and though Draco had not said anything, Harry understood his reluctance to leave his flat. In a way, those tiny, run-down rooms above the curry shop were the thing that was most Draco’s – the physical symbol of turning his back on the Malfoy name and building a life for himself.
“So where’s Ginny?” Ron said abruptly. “She doesn’t usually have practice on Saturdays.”
“Sorry,” Ginny gasped, wiping tears from her eyes. “Couldn’t resist.”
Trying to fix this didn’t mean he had to chase that future.
“I’ll win next time,” Harry said, but Malfoy didn’t scowl the way he had expected.
“Andie.”
Draco stood and threw his robe over his shoulders, before reconsidering and allowing it to drop to the floor in a final moment of pique.
Draco nodded, shivering a little as Harry skimmed a thumb lightly across his palm.
It had been a little awkward, trying to get to know these strangers while demonstrating various tea blends, but Draco found himself glad that Maeve was being so thorough. They couldn’t let just
Harry’s second to last thought before sleep reclaimed him was that he
He had thought yesterday at the Weasleys had gone rather well, for both himself and for Blaise. Mr. Weasley’s energy was a tad alarming, of course, and there had been that odd argument between Ginny and George… but everyone had been far kinder than Draco had expected. Blaise had gotten on well with everyone too, joking around with Weasley
Maeve gave Draco a little push, then trailed after him down the hallway. With one last suspicious look at her, he unlocked the door, slipped the key into his pocket, and made his way across the threshold.
“What?” Draco started slightly, then refocused on Harry. “No – sorry, I didn’t mean to ramble on like that.” He tucked a few stray locks of hair behind his ear. “Why did you call?”
While he could have done without the week they spent on magical politics and international relations (the curriculum had felt irritatingly pure-blood, what with all the foreign etiquette they had to learn), last week’s unit on healing and basic magical remedies would certainly have eased some of the strain back when they were struggling through the woods.
“Draco!” Maeve yelled, snapping Draco out of his chocolate-tinged daydream. “There’s a young man here to see you!”
“Where do you – I mean, do you want me to – bring you something?” Potter asked, light suddenly dancing in his eyes. “Tea? Or – or a healing potion?”
the late-summer weather was far too hot)
before I could get away!” Malfoy paused to glare at Harry, as if the fifteen minutes between knowing where Harry was and being free to find him had been a burden too heavy to bear.
Draco laughed helplessly. He flushed and nodded, then hid his face against Harry’s neck.
“Oh.” Harry was a little surprised, but it wasn’t like that was something to be embarrassed about. Plenty of wizards didn’t apparate. “Well, you’re not missing much,” he confided, “even if you never want to learn after all this. I kind of hate it.”
“Wait, so they
Harry let her get on with it and finished his lunch. He wiped his hands on a napkin and stood.
Potter kicked aimlessly at the debris by the edge of the road. “Alright. Er –”
and are only now coming to my office?” she demanded. “Only after one of your classmates nearly
Ginny groaned, but it sounded more fond than exasperated. “He’s designing a magical scavenger hunt. Don’t ask,” she ordered, pointing a finger at Harry. “Not unless you want to hear a thirty minute monologue about the ‘shocking underground nepotism’ of wizarding antique shops.”
When Draco swiped a hand through his disheveled, sweaty hair, biting his lip and frowning in concentration, Harry nearly groaned aloud. The git had no right to make potions research look so unbearably sexy – even if he
Before Harry could fall too far into his reverie, Draco twisted in his arms and rubbed their noses together. It tickled, and Harry squirmed slightly, starting to laugh when Draco wouldn’t let him pull away.
Hermione had been indignant and likely would have made a scene, but Ron understood Harry’s quick kick to his shin and whispered to his girlfriend to stand down.
“Weasley, you
“Honestly, Potter,” Draco scoffed. “Isn’t it obvious? Me wanting a post-run Harry when you were
into the sanctity of Novelle’s.
Draco ignored the look, but he traced a fingertip along the petals of the flower with a tiny smile.
“You’re wonderful,” Harry breathed. “I love you.”
If even Maeve couldn’t make Draco see how much he had changed, then who could?
“Of course,” he replied without turning, not wanting Maeve to see his clenched jaw. “Just a moment.”
, Potter.”
Draco was just beginning to muse aloud about connecting the colors to various spells when he noticed that Harry had gone silent. They had finished eating, and Harry had been clearing the plates. He was leaning against the sink now, eyes seeming to look through Draco rather than at him. The overhead lights cast a warm glow on Harry’s face, emphasizing the tension there. The unease that had prickled at the back of Draco’s mind all through dinner reasserted itself.
“Harry,” Draco breathed.
Draco nodded and waited for Harry to continue.
Harry hissed in a breath and snatched his hand away from Draco. There was a loud crash, and Draco’s eyes flew open to find Harry towering over him, the chair he’d been sitting in knocked to the floor.
Draco’s nose wrinkled. “But we never finished the bathroom.”
belong here, as if he would always be welcome. As if Harry wanted Draco there any time he chose to come.
“Come on, Potter,” Draco growled, unceremoniously dragging Harry deeper into the strange house. “We’re getting the fuck out of this nightmare.”
“You said the Death Eaters might have done something to change the residue somehow –” Harry said, Draco nodding along - “but what if they did something to their wands?”
“That’s it. That’s literally how we did it. I waved my wand around until Hermione told me the answer.” Harry’s tone was light, but Draco must have heard the thread of self-doubt beneath, because he dropped the sponge he was holding and came back to the table.
When Draco released him, Harry lowered himself onto the bed. He draped himself artfully across the pillows, stretching until he felt his t-shirt ride up. He heard Draco’s sharp inhalation and smirked up at him, watching Draco’s eyes darken as they caught on the bared skin. Harry felt the gaze as if it were Draco’s hand caressing the trail of hair that led down to Harry’s cock.
Draco got up to fetch two glasses of water. When he returned to the table, Harry gulped the drink down gratefully and finally looked up from his food.
“Wrap it all around the spell, shield it like –”
The air rushed past Harry, thickening further until it seemed to be squeezing him flat.
The kissed stuttered as they both shuddered and groaned. Harry pushed himself halfway up and stared down at their cocks. It was the most arousing thing he had ever seen.
Draco grumbled unconvincingly and brought his lips to Harry’s, slotting their tongues together.
Harry did not hesitate to obey. He slammed it behind him and practically leapt onto the bed, narrowly avoiding tripping over the school bag Draco had discarded in the middle of the floor.
And neither of them had
Harry had waved goodnight to Ron and Hermione, who were sitting by the fire, then trailed after Malfoy, eyes lingering on the tight fit of his trousers.
Harry flipped through the pages as Draco cut thick slices of meatloaf and scooped out two helpings of crispy potatoes and sprouts.
“I’m aware, Mr. Potter,” McGonagall cut in wearily. “We’re doing everything we can.”
But thinking about it made him feel strange – blurred at the edges almost, like he was stretching and dissolving at the same time.
“Why not?”
“No, Harry,” Draco said firmly. “It wouldn’t have been right. I told her everything that day, more than I had ever spoken about before, even when giving my testimony to the Wizengamot. Maeve listened, let me tell the whole sordid thing. When I finished, I told her I would understand if she did not want a person like me working for her, and that if she preferred, I would not visit the shop again.”
“No, I know,” Draco said, feeling his cheeks heat. “That’s not what I – I mean, well, it’s just that – I like cooking.” He squared his shoulders and added, “Your mother must be quite knowledgeable.”
“I didn’t give you what you needed. I didn’t love you the way you deserve to be loved.”
Draco fetched two mugs from a cabinet, pouring half the hot chocolate into each. He offered one to Harry before squishing himself into the opposite corner of the sofa.
“What?” Draco asked, as startled by the compliment as the question. “No, I – no.”
Harry laughed, and a tentative smile welled up from Draco’s heart.
“Look, mate, we don’t have to talk about it,” Ron said. He knocked his shoulder against Harry’s. “I’m just here to keep you company.”
“Not using it would be a
Harry didn’t know if Malfoy was responsible or if the eighth year dormitory magic was intuitive as well as benevolent, but he didn’t suppose it mattered much either way. Malfoy had made no objection to the changes (despite the fact that the Gryffindor blanket looked shockingly out of place against the pale blue bed spread), and Harry just about swooned every time he glimpsed these physical reminders of their friendship, evidence of two lives slowly melding together.
It was around the time when the walls began to flash with the outlines of trees from the Forbidden Forest that Harry began to suspect what was going on, but he didn’t say anything until they were forced to walk through a Hogwarts bathroom, blood pooling on the floor tiles and a flickering, tattered black veil suspended above.
Draco delivered the tea quickly, sparing one winning smile for their customer when she thanked him, then darted back through the storage room to take refuge in his tiny workshop. He collapsed against the wall, but did not succumb to the urge to sink to the floor.
Malfoy circled Harry, slowing just enough to waggle his eyebrows before dropping below him and zooming away.
Draco gave a curt nod.
Harry reached out to him, but dropped his hand quickly when Draco stepped back. Harry could feel the blood pounding in his temples, a steady drumbeat of shame.
“I’m sorry,” Potter repeated, shoving his hands into the pockets of his jeans. Despite looking thoroughly abashed, he stepped closer to Draco. “I didn’t think I hit your face, but I guess I must have knocked you with my forehead or something. It looks pretty bad. Do you want me to –” he bit his lip, but then jutted his chin forward stubbornly and continued – “do you want me to heal it?”
Luna stared after them, trembling. Malfoy strode over and put an arm around her, speaking softly into her ear. Harry couldn’t hear what he was saying, but Luna shook her head and collapsed against Malfoy’s chest. He held onto her as she cried, rubbing her back soothingly.
“Alright, then,” Potter said agreeably, effecting an exaggerated shrug. “Cheers!” He seized a biscuit and held it out to Draco with a meaningful look.
Ginny had gone, and there was no one inside his homey little cottage to share the meal.
“Tell you what?” Harry asked.
And now, all but collapsed on the bench and pain still echoing through his body, he was more than grateful to bask in the familiar comfort of Malfoy.
without all that hate we always tried to throw at each other. And I just – wanted to see more.”
Finally, Draco’s cock sprang free, narrower than Harry’s, but long and hard and perfect. Draco sat up to pull the sweatpants off his feet. He lifted the garment teasingly, hooked around a single finger, and then dropped it to the floor. Leaning back on his hands, he spread his thighs just enough to give Harry a tantalizing glimpse of his arse.
Harry gasped and staggered backward, clutching at his temples.
“The Ministry will handle the discovery and dispersal of the residue at all other sites, though as there was not a deluge of accidents and injuries over the summer, I imagine Hogwarts will prove to be the worst site of contamination. I am confident that Ms. Jaffey and Mr. Dahnroe can handle the rest. You and Mr. Potter will return to your studies.”
Draco let his head fall to the desk with a groan. He’d already met with five people today, two more than had been on Maeve’s original list. Would it never end?
He looked up at Harry then, and Harry had the fleeting thought that he had never seen Malfoy so disheveled. His hair was escaping his bun and strands of it clung to the sweat at his temples. There was already a smudge of ash above his brow, and his undoubtedly expensive trousers were probably being ruined by the soot he had thrown himself into.
Tonight though, it grated on him. Tonight, something was off.
It wasn’t their last night. Harry knew that down to his bones. But he held Draco anyway, and he didn’t let him go.
on yourself.”
“But I haven’t even done anything!” Harry cried. His skin prickled with shame at his own ineptitude.
“I did not barge in,” Harry argued, and he could almost hear Draco’s smirk. “And you weren’t in the middle of – I mean, I was –
“I collected the testimonials for you,” he said, gesturing to the paperwork in his hands. “In case you decide to apply.”
He sat cross-legged, chin resting glumly in his palm. “We should have known.”
“Harry,” Draco murmured again, “oh Harry,
“No,” Harry said, then frowned as he noticed a long, thin cylinder on the coffee table. “What’s that?”
“Sentiomancy?” Harry repeated.
A loud pop came from the fire as the sole remaining log succumbed to the flames. It had burned almost down to its embers, softening the vibrant colors of the shop with its dim, cozy light. Maeve’s eyes drifted shut, hands folded over her stomach as she leaned against the counter and hummed contentedly. The floating lanterns flickered softly, as if they were dancing along with Maeve’s little melody. It was moments like this when Draco felt he saw her most clearly, a woman who had brought life to this place by giving it her soul.
There was a long pause, long enough that Draco considered getting up and walking away. But there were still parts of this that he didn’t understand, and though he couldn’t quite bring himself to ask any more questions, he was unwilling to abandon the answers Blaise might eventually offer on his own.
“I see you now,” Harry echoed, making the words a promise.
Without thinking about it, Harry leapt up from the bench and caught Malfoy by the wrist.
Ron raised his eyebrows. “Mate, do you even
Harry stood and wandered across the room. He was a bit unsteady, but it felt good to stretch his legs. “Just give me a minute,” Harry said over his shoulder, making his way to the kitchen.
“This one,” Draco said, letting it dangle from his fingertips as he smoldered down at Harry.
Harry couldn’t move. The grey of Malfoy’s eyes seemed to swallow him, lapping gently like the waters of the lake shore while somehow also crashing down in a wave over his head.
“Yes.” He huffed out a breath and swiped the hair away from his eyes.
Draco whined and mumbled, and hearing the posh git come so completely undone pushed Harry right over the edge. He came hard, and was on his knees in an instant, swallowing Draco down.
Harry seized his wrist before he could get far. “Ok, ok,” he gasped, fighting against his laughter. “You win!” Harry allowed himself one more deep chuckle, then pushed upright. He crossed his legs and sat attentively in front of Draco. “I’m listening. Residual Dark Magic. Go.”
“Potter!” said the voice, breath warm against his face. His eyes fluttered open.
“Not just school, Harry,” Ginny said. “You talked about him when we were living in the cottage.”
Draco sighed into Harry’s silence, his breath fluttering the locks of hair that spilled over Harry’s forehead. Harry looked up at Draco, wanting to tell him that he loved him for him, not because of the actions he’d undertaken to purge his father’s sins from the world.
. Even as the taunt left his mouth, part of Harry regretted it, a tiny tendril of shame coiled in his gut.
“But,” Harry said, scrunching up his face wryly, “McGonagall knows enough about my past, er – actions, that I understand why she was worried about that.”
“N-no,” Draco panted. “Not with another person. Only my – my fingers or – or sometimes a toy.”
“You never deserved it,” Harry told him. “I would have fought for you.”
Hermione didn’t ask, so Harry didn’t try to explain.
The words seemed to echo between them, ricocheting off the impenetrable shell of Draco’s self-recrimination, bouncing straight back, unheeded, to Harry.
Harry held the matches up where Draco could see them. “I’ll take care of the fire. You should change out of these clothes.”
“I guess I’ve just been thinking about some of the stuff you’ve said.” Harry started slowly, still adjusting to the idea that it was ok to share this part of him. “About the emptiness in my dreams, and not having anything to do with myself, and – and the guilt we talked about. I’ve been getting those letters since the end of the war, and I never really read them all that closely. The Auror department writes at least twice a month, but there’s other things too. The Unspeakables wanting to study me and newspapers begging for an interview and all these people wanting to use my name for profit.”
The anger left Draco as quickly as it had come. He seemed to deflate, curling into himself until his chin rested against his knees. “I can’t do magic, Potter. I’m not allowed.”
Maeve positioned herself where everyone could see her, behind the mess of lights and centered between Harry and Draco. She looked very much like a professor about to address her class. Draco noticed that Hermione sat up a little straighter, as if she wanted to take notes.
Harry exhaled slowly and rubbed a hand across his face. He looked up at Draco with a grim smile.
Taking his seat, Draco looked up at Harry with a dazzling smile.
“Did you come for an apology, Potter?” she asked, not deigning to look at him.
Draco hmphed at him. “A little help here, Potter?” he said, holding out the mugs of tea.
“A distraction, hmm?” Draco asked, sidling closer to Harry.
McGonagall did not answer, just stared at the parchment in stunned shock.
As he stepped out from the shadow of the shelf, Harry’s trainers scraped against the rough concrete of the floor. Draco startled at the sound, then frowned down at where his pen had torn the page before his eyes found Harry.
“Wh-what?” Draco’s eyes flared, his pupils blown wide.
, and for now, that was what mattered. He was tired of the past. He’d had enough of regrets and darkness.
It was a different kind of enough, than the one Harry tried and failed to find with dueling. But it was just as important.
“No,” Draco said. “In this scenario, Maeve would hire a private detective to find me. And you would play the grieving boy–” he cut off abruptly, two spots of color flaring high on his cheeks.
After, they had lain in the grass, holding hands as the sun warmed their wind-whipped skin. Draco had told Harry about Hermione’s visit to Novelle’s the day before, about how much he liked her, about odd life-debt statistics and three new blends of tea. He spoke about how he wasn’t as afraid anymore, of Maeve leaving, even though he knew how much he would miss her. Harry had kissed Draco’s cheek, then talked to him about kickboxing, about the defensive spells he was finding ways to make stronger, and about how he had spent the morning doing nothing, relaxing into the empty hours with no hint of panic, something he had not been able to do since the war.
“Done!” he cried, sounding as delighted as if he’d just captured a particularly elusive snitch.
Wait…
“Draco?”
There had to be something he had missed, something that would explain why Draco’s potions weren’t doing what he wanted them to. Harry didn’t understand all of it, but he knew that Draco was attempting to use the protective essence of the flowers to create a potion that would shield witches and wizards from the twisting influence of the hooks.
Draco let out a shaky sob before partially collapsing. He bent over himself, burying his head in his hands, elbows braced on his knees.
) was Harry’s. Draco Malfoy was obviously up to something.
Harry let out a sound that was embarrassingly close to a whimper, feeling oddly bereft at the loss of physical contact. He leaned deliberately back on his hands, forcing himself not to move in toward Malfoy.
“Hush.”
Harry jolted upright with the memory, eyes snapping open. If the flowers were
Harry moved his hands to Draco’s hips, tightening his grip until Draco’s thrusts stilled. Draco dropped his head to Harry’s shoulder, breath hot against Harry’s neck.
“Was there ever a time when you wanted the Dark Mark?”

“Well, this place is a bit distracting,” Harry said, futilely trying to bat away a misty cloud of the pale blue light. “But we can’t just keep following these lights. We’ll never get out.”
But Harry remembered the Forbidden Forest and what Draco had done for him there, remembered how Draco had
“Draco?” Harry whispered, propping himself up on an elbow.
Out of the corner of his eye, Draco caught Lavender looking at them askance, but then her mouth quirked into a smile. She shook her head with a muffled laugh and wandered to the opposite side of the clearing, where she took a few swallows from a water bottle before moving into a series of stretches.
Perpendicular to the desk sat two long work tables with enough space to have at least ten cauldrons boiling at once. Beside them was a massive cupboard with its doors thrown open to reveal row upon row of Potions equipment, some of which Draco had never even seen in person before, let alone dreamed of owning. There were also shelves full of baskets and glass jars containing every conceivable ingredient, as well as enough empty space to fill with other supplies.
“Yeah, the lightning one!” Harry exclaimed. A memory struck him then – Draco squirming in his chair at Novelle’s when Harry had asked about the name. Maeve’s wicked grin and teasing comments when Draco had tried to wave off the questions. A sudden suspicion began to dawn in Harry’s mind, heating his blood with its implications. “Wait – what’s the full name of it again?”
“What, scared of a little bludger action, Potter?” Malfoy taunted. He pulled a round object from his pocket and took a huge bite.
Trying not to panic, Draco pushed Potter off him and rose to his feet.
It was as if Harry’s blush flew through the air to infect Draco. Suddenly a splotchy scarlet color, he mumbled, “yes, of course,” and busied himself with making tea.
“But I’m
“Different spells have different wand motions because magic needs to be channeled in different ways,” Draco explained. He sounded like a Professor, and Harry found it disturbingly sexy. He struggled to refocus as Draco continued. “The wand motion creates the proper pathway for us to control and direct each spell.” Draco trailed a hand across his sternum and down his wand arm, pivoting his arm at the elbow as if demonstrating various pathways.
Harry’s stomach growled as he entered the Great Hall, quite late for lunch.
“Maeve, I can’t –” He twisted his head away. “You said you wouldn’t do this anymore. You
“They’re your family too, Harry,” Ginny said gently. Then her mouth tightened. “But it wasn’t you. I had a bunch of travel lined up for Harpies training, and then it was just easier to stay away for a bit. I was sorting through some things of my own.”
Draco wiped his fingers on his napkin and looked up at Harry with a sad smile. “Do you miss her?”
Harry didn’t expect strangers to understand, and he didn’t expect Malfoy to either, but even his closest friends seemed to believe that his actions during the war were beyond reproach – any mistakes washed away by the victory against Voldemort. But that didn’t sit right with Harry. It never had.
To make matters worse, Harry had few distractions of his own. For his project, he had set out to master low-level Aperiomancy, having finally accepted that he couldn’t rely on Sentiomancy if he was truly to develop a student-friendly Aperiomancy curriculum.
“Oh alright,” Ron muttered. “‘Course she told me, you wanker!” He smacked Harry on the shoulder. “But I would’ve liked to hear it from you!”
The sound of Harry’s chair hitting the floor again was shockingly loud in the sudden silence. Draco flinched, and slowly pushed his own chair back, away from Harry.
Draco had helped these people. Some more than others, certainly, but he had done at least one small act of good for each of them, even if it was only to brew them the right cup of tea on a difficult day. It wasn’t enough, of course – nothing would ever balance out the Darkness Draco had served – but it also wasn’t worthless. And maybe, given enough time, Draco could build on it, make his amends bit by bit, working to put some Light back into the world.
“I did something that might make you angry,” Harry said.
It wasn’t easy.
“He saved me, you know,” Draco said, like he was telling Harry a secret. “During those long weeks leading up to my trial. It was alright while I was still at Hogwarts. Working on the grounds was peaceful, and I was able to lose myself in it. But I was done there by the beginning of July, and I had nowhere to go. The Ministry would have allowed me to stay at the Manor, but I –” Draco shuddered – “I couldn’t. Blaise took me in, let me stay at his place in London. He was working long hours, so I wandered the city during the day, and he kept me from panicking at night.”
Harry moved his own hand to the seam of his trousers and trailed a fingertip over the buckle of his belt. “Draco,” he breathed seductively.
Harry froze, and Draco whined, clenching around Harry’s fingers.
to clean up Dark Magic residue.”
“It seems to me that you should just – let it happen.” Maeve waved a hand in the air lackadaisically, then stood and began to move Draco’s other doughs into the fridge. “It might very well be a sign from the universe, and when the universe is giving you signs, you should listen.”
“Nice to meet you, Andie.” She didn’t respond, and Harry added, “Aren’t you cold out here?” The wind was mild today, but it was almost December, and the air held a frigid chill.
“I’m sorry, Harry,” Draco murmured, head bowed over the table.
And then, between one blink and the next, there appeared a door.
“Wait.” Draco’s eyes flashed. “You asked me if casting was enough to create residue.” The bowl he had been holding clattered into the sink, and he braced his hands against the edge of the table. “Potter, please tell me you have not been casting Dark Magic spells.”
There was an awkward silence, and Harry could sense the divide between them widening once more. They’d been building bridges these last few weeks, but their past had dug that chasm deep, and some days Harry wasn’t sure they could make it across without falling. There was unfinished business between them, and so many things left unsaid.
“Just now,” said Draco. “We came as soon as it cooled. All it needs is a drop of their blood.”
There’s no telling what we’d be able to do with that!”
The room suddenly felt very cold.
he had ever spoken with the intent to wound.
The beginnings of rage bubbled in Harry’s guts, though he wasn’t sure whether to direct it at the Ministry or himself. He’d spoken on Draco’s behalf at the trials, made sure he wouldn’t end up in Azkaban in punishment for being traumatized and manipulated into his childhood mistakes. Harry knew that Draco had done wrong, but he had seen enough during the war to know that the children of Death Eaters had had no good choices.
Slowly, he became aware of a voice, soothing and repetitive.
McGonagall’s voice caught, and she paused to collect herself. And that’s precisely when Draco Malfoy slipped in through the side door.
“She was stuck on the residual Dark Magic idea for a while, as I had been. But then she said something that got me thinking.” Draco trailed off, staring at the glass flower again.
“It’s the Manor,” he said again. “But also not.”
“Something that was always there in the background,” Harry said. “And you don’t think it’s important, but then something shifts, and it’s the key to everything.”
“No,” Draco said, shaking his head before pulling a thick grey jumper over his button down shirt. “That excuse doesn’t work on her.”
“I do know you,” Draco said fiercely, letting his head fall against Harry’s. “I’m so sorry, Harry. I never should have said that to you.”
“Professor, I don’t –” Harry trailed off, not sure how to tactfully bring up his absolute distrust of the Ministry.
He ducked his head, but glanced up at Harry, as if trying to gauge his reaction.
“I don’t know, Hermione,” Draco said carefully. “That doesn’t quite add up.”
No, a flesh and blood Draco Malfoy would have been another problem entirely. Would, in fact, hardly have been a problem at all. He would never be her first pick (or second, or third, etc. etc.) for a shag (or conversation, or drinks at the pub, etc. etc.), but he certainly was fit. White gold hair falling naturally into his eyes, body all graceful angles and subtle muscle - so different from the severe lines of his youth. Nothing wrong with a little bit of eye candy. And then a simple hex, or even a swift kick to the head, would resolve the matter once and for all.
“In the dungeons at Malfoy Manor.”
Harry caught his hand and kissed his palm. Draco whimpered, eyes still wide with shock. But then something in him shifted. His expression hardened into fierceness, the lines of his forehead almost angry.
fucking
remind him of Harry Potter.
Harry Potter had blundered his way into the teashop, and Draco had remembered what it meant to dream.
spot.
“Did you see that?” Ginny whisper-yelled at Harry. “She’s showing him the secret gravy spells!”
“You were right, you in that garden, most beautiful –
Harry sighed as Draco turned another bloody page.
That had gone far, far better than he thought it would.
He covered the two miles in a little over twelve minutes.
“Yes, really,” Draco huffed. “It’s not some tea conspiracy, Potter. We have one called ‘Wool Hat in the Rain.’ Maeve thinks it’s whimsical.”
“Is that all?” Blaise went on. “No beautiful damsel on your arm, pestering you to make an honest man out of him?”
anything.
“Now this,” Maeve continued with a sly smile, wiggling her fingers toward the lilac light, “has been around much, much longer. Since you were about twelve, I’d say.”
Harry grinned. Birdsong and the smell of lilacs warmed Draco’s back, creeping in through the open door.
“Yes. Ok.” Draco smiled at him. “Lie back.”
It was just so bloody
Draco jumped at the contact, but his voice remained steady. “Yes?”
Harry
It took Harry less than a minute to confirm what he suspected, and he quickly retracted his magic. Opening his eyes again, he grinned and leaned eagerly toward Draco.
His eyes widened slightly, and he shot a nervous glance over his shoulder at Ron.
“I suppose that would explain the barriers, in a way,” Draco mused, after taking a steadying breath. “We can’t leave each other until the requirement is met, almost as if we’re trapped in the Room.”
“Lavender,” he cried, “are you ok? I’m so sorry, I am so so sorry.”
beginning to ache dreadfully.
“Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow,” Draco mumbled, voice slurred with sleep.
“I am happy,” Harry whispered, clenching a fist to his chest and squeezing his eyes shut. The worry was back, like a persistent dog biting at his ankles.
McGonagall was in the corner, engaged in an animated dialogue with Tahlyn. The Healer looked exhausted. Her normally rich brown skin was dull and lifeless, and the circles beneath her eyes stood out like bruises. Clutching the wrist of her wand-arm, she seemed to be keeping pace with McGonagall’s rapid-fire queries, but she winced with every slight movement she attempted.
Harry slid his hand up Draco’s chest to his shoulder. Bringing his other hand to Draco’s back, Harry gently laid him down against the pillows.
The silence quickly grew awkward between them, and Draco hoped the exhibition matches would soon start. Harry had mentioned that Weasley would most likely also be attending this event, and while that did not bother Draco, he certainly had not expected Weasley to sit with him. He did not imagine Weasley would want to. Pity it was a weekday, or Hermione might be here too.
Malfoy chuckled dryly and dragged himself off the bed. He crossed the room and ducked behind his wardrobe. A minute later he emerged, wearing a loose long sleeve shirt.
Harry obliged with a swish of his wand, charming the cups to float in the air beside him. Draco eyed the hammock doubtfully, certain it would flip the moment he attempted to sit down. But Harry held it steady, and soon enough, Draco was in his arms, back resting against Harry’s chest. Harry conjured a pillow, then rattled off a few spells Draco didn’t catch, manipulating the ropes so they could both sit up comfortably. Draco reclaimed the mugs and handed one to Harry before relaxing into him.
I get when I’m all hyped up on victory and broom polish.”
“Try to make a door again?” Harry suggested.
“Draco?”
At a few points, Declan had looked on the verge of joining in, his gaze wandering between the kids and the equipment shed. He never actually did, but by the end of the hour lesson, he was clapping and cheering each time someone caught the ball.
“It’s midmorning,” Draco argued, even as a yawn broke up the words.
Harry had long ago come to terms with the fact that he wanted to understand Malfoy; he was still struggling with the idea that he might want something more than that from this strange, new Malfoy.
“Harry,” Draco said. His voice was tinged with wonder, bathing Harry in a golden light. “Will you teach me Sentiomancy?”
didn’t earn it,” Harry argued. “And you wouldn’t be exploiting them. Not intentionally.”
After casting a strong warming charm around them, Harry lay down beside Draco and took his hand. They were silent for a time, Harry waiting for the moment when Draco would be ready to talk through his theories.
“Where did you come from, anyway?” he asked quickly, hoping to stave off any further concern from Potter.
He gasped in a breath, the air harsh against his raw throat. He still couldn’t see and the tightness against his legs was unbearable. He tore at it, ripping it away from him before realizing it was only his sheets. He cringed away from the touch of the bedclothes, pulling his knees to his chest and sobbing into his hands.
Harry followed as Draco took a seat at one of the stools by the counter. He wasn’t sure if he’d be welcome to join Draco, so he settled for hovering over his shoulder.
Harry gasped softly and bit his lip, stomach roiling unpleasantly, even though he knew Malfoy was joking.
Malfoy stepped closer to Harry, eyes narrowing as he scrutinized him for a moment. His expression softened.
Harry circled his other strands around the vines –
“I’m serious,” Harry insisted. “I know he and Ginny fucked up. But he’s your best friend, and you need him.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Inside, Draco dug the tea tin from his trousers and put the kettle on. There was a chicken and ham pie resting on the stove, its crust gleaming golden in the low light of the kitchen. Draco’s heart fluttered.
A breeze blew in through the open windows, and the billowing curtains snapped unheeded at the very edge of Harry’s focus. His world had narrowed to encompass only Draco. He was as unaware of Hermione’s presence as if she were no longer in the room.
Harry reeled backward, choking on a pained noise as he darted an anxious look at Draco. Draco’s face was stricken, crumpled in grief, and Harry didn’t want to worry him further by panicking.
Draco’s breath hitched. He marveled at the ease with which Harry could say these things, at the power of his unfettered honesty. Draco ached with it, the promise of Harry’s words thrumming in his blood.
Draco glanced up into the swaying tree branches. He took a deep breath before looking straight at Harry. “I apologize for my behavior earlier,” he said. He had gone stiff again, like when Hermione had first arrived, but the words were earnest. He blanched, then continued forlornly. “Granger must have been mortified.”
“How difficult is the process, Mr. Malfoy?” McGonagall asked. “Would it be within the capabilities of our NEWT level Potions students?”
had thrust it into
“He was probably the closest thing I ever had to a father. But he died. Fifth year.”
“Why not?” Hermione asked, clearly exasperated.
“No, wait,” Harry interrupted. “Draco, don’t. Please. Just let me – I need to –” Harry made a lost, desperate sort of gesture. Hot chocolate sloshed over the edge of his mug, spilling onto his jumper.
Draco’s eyes narrowed suspiciously. “What’s so funny, Potter?”
Before he could grow too melancholy though, Maeve presented him with a small square package, wrapped in shiny sky-blue paper and a silver bow.
been here all week. They probably did some tests and things we don’t know about.”
“Would you mind lending me those books you mentioned?” he asked politely. “I’d like to read them if you’re finished.”
“Is this ok?” Harry whispered. His breath tickled Draco’s ear.
“Yeah,” Harry sighed. “It’s not a bad feeling, exactly. I think I just got overwhelmed.”
“Oh.” Malfoy’s voice sounded strained. His fingers twitched as he gazed almost longingly at the buds above their heads. He cleared his throat and answered. “An advanced Potions spell. It draws the essence out of a plant.”
Harry seemed to get the message or he reached the end of his patience as well. He pushed a second finger next his first, moved them in the most delicious torture before a third joined. At this point Draco didn't care at all anymore what kind of sounds left his lips or if they actually didn’t like each other. The only thing that mattered was chasing that thrilling feeling as if it was the snitch and this was the most important match of the school year.
And it was one step too far. Harry snapped. In one swift movement he grabbed Draco's wrists, turned them around and slammed Draco's body hard against the locker, pinning him down with his own body. Draco felt as if his heart was beating in his throat and as if his skin was on fire. His attention was solely focused on Potter's grip around his wrist.
He let his own hands travel over every inch of Harry's exposed skin as if he was in a fever dream. Hastily, without precision. Their tongues tangled in an unrelenting fight and not even a piece of paper would have fitted between their bodies.
The feeling was everything and not enough at once. He pressed back against Harry's hard cock, his body acting on its own accord. Wanted to feel more, wanted to feel everything. Right in this moment there wasn't anything more important than to finally feel all of Potter, in him.
“Then what are we doing here, Malfoy?“Potter demanded, stressing his words by shoving Draco into the wall, his breathing ragged, chest heaving and still clearly aroused.
Draco squeezed his hand harder, furry raging through his mind. Potter's almost painful groan shot through his whole body in sweet satisfaction. It wasn't fair that Potter evoked such reactions in him but then he was tired to fight it to be honest. It was too late to walk out with his pride intact anyway, wasn't it? Draco didn't plan with Harry though. As if Potter was fighting the same battle with himself coming to a different conclusion, he grabbed both of Draco's wrists again, slamming him back against the wall
Draco felt how Harry's magic washed over him, wandless, powerful. Before he could let that sink in or even envy Potter for that level of skill one of Potter's fingers entered his body and any and all thoughts Draco might have had were lost.
A smirk pulled at Draco's lips and he kissed his way to the corner of Harry's mouth
"Never heard of towels, Potter? You must saunter around here exposing everybody to your nudity, mustn't you?" snarled Draco. Ignoring how his pulse thrummed through his veins and his skin suddenly felt flushed, despite the crippling cold outside, because good looks aside this was still bloody Potter.
Draco took yet again another step closer, clearly entering Harry's space.
Their expression was almost feral. Draco dared to say they projected some kind of hunger, the hand still holding his chin squeezed harder. It wasn't a conscious decision. It was more of an inevitability as Draco's lips crashed onto Harry's.
It didn't last long though and time slammed back down to it's normal speed, igniting the angry flame again. A deep groan left Draco's lips as Potter pushed Draco's pants down without preamble and in the same second let go of the towel slung around his hips. The feeling of hot skin on skin threatened to burn Draco from the insight out. His head felt dizzy and a consuming vibration traveled through his whole body. He couldn't remember when the last time had been that he'd been that aroused.
Their kiss was as heated as their argument. Not gentle at all. Rough like a fight for dominance, neither of them willing to loose any ground. There were more teeth than tongue and the way Potter bit down on Draco's lip was probably too hard but he didn't care. Nothing beyond chasing that feeling right in this second seemed important.
