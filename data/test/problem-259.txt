Malfoy scowls. “Yes, I’ll confess that I’ll appreciate it if you wouldn’t distract my staff, Potter. They have a job that I’m paying them good money to do, and that doesn’t involve gossiping about my trade secrets with you. Now, if you don’t mind!”
Malfoy looks stunned. It takes him a moment to find the words, and he takes to clearing his throat several times before saying finally, “Yes, quite. Well done, Potter. Excellent description. But what I meant was, how do you feel?”
“Getting a bit obsessed there, aren’t you mate?” Ron had said when Harry had stormed back to his cubicle in the Auror bullpen after another unsuccessful attempt to convince Robards to
“What’s your poison?” Malfoy says, nodding to the trolley of drinks that rolls up silently between their chairs.
“Fine,” Harry says, “then I’m sure you wouldn’t mind if I bottle some of your sample fusion brews and bring them back to the Ministry for a review.”
There’s a strange flapping sound that interrupts the moment, and they spring apart guiltily as they glance down the corridor. Technically, they’re still on the clock, with another hour to go—but what comes down their way is a red Howler, already steaming at the edges.
“Of course you weren’t. Because you know that Amortentia is unstable and doesn’t react well with other spells or potions,” Malfoy says, smirking because he knows Harry well enough by now, and Harry has to bite back a sigh of despair.
"Well done, ten points to Gryffindor," Draco says dryly over his shoulder, not bothering to turn around. Harry laughs, a soft, pleased sound that sends a warm, prickly feeling rippling through Draco. He ignores it, and keeps his focus on scanning their surroundings.
Malfoy looks astonished. “Potter, there’s a sign on the door. It’s written all over our menus. It’s even printed on your receipt.” A beat. Then, “Aren’t you an Auror? Isn’t it your job to, oh, I don’t know,
terrible," and Draco nods back and says, cautiously, "See you around." He’s pleasantly surprised to discover that he does actually mean it.
Once he’s done fiddling around with his concoctions, Malfoy stands and begins to pull up the hem of his shirt, clearly intending to strip.
"Come on, Potter," Draco says, his voice coming out broken, his hands drifting down until they’re nestled in Potter’s messy hair, "get my cock wet with that pretty mouth of yours. You like this, don’t you? Getting down on your knees to suck me off."
Anyone else would have been shouted out of the room for milking the situation, but Cheng Wu is truly the press’ new Golden Boy
"So, what department are you in? What have you been working on?" Cheng Wu asks, and Potter glances at Draco, something unreadable in his expression.
"Be careful," Draco murmurs, as Potter slips inside cautiously, wand out. Draco remains outside, keeping guard until he hears Potter’s whispered "all clear" float out from the door. He takes one last look around the dark, deserted alley before slipping in, pulling the door firmly shut behind him.
Potter’s already rising from the bench, and reaches out a hand to the dragon. It eyes them both balefully for a long second and doesn’t move from where it’s sprawled out across the table. Potter starts making a clicking noise with his tongue in an attempt to coax it over, which it promptly ignores.
“Why, yes,” Susan says, blinking at him in surprise. “He’s been working on it for the last few weeks. Although I think he’s a bit stuck on the name, he’s been tossing around a few variations for days now and they all sound terrible. But shh, mum’s the word.”
The Trafficking of Magical Creatures Division is horribly underfunded and understaffed: they’re a tiny Division, but even with their limited numbers they barely fit in the space provided. There are six cubicles crammed into the small space, and every single desk is overflowing with stacks upon stacks of files. Still, despite the mess and the close quarters, it’s cheery enough: Latika had put up some tinsel formed into the shape of a Christmas tree on the spare wall for last year’s Christmas do, and none of them had bothered to take it down again. For New Year’s, David had enchanted it to change colours ever so subtly, and they liked having it slowly rotate through all the colours of the rainbow.
the exact secrets of my formulas. Would you like a live demonstration as well? Perhaps I can direct you to a Floo later, so you can run straight to my competitors and tell them all you know!”
“No, it’s going to be the collar for you,” Potter says sternly, and the dragon lets out a tiny roar of disagreement. It storms around in a tight circle on Potter’s palm, its spiked tail waving around agitatedly, blowing miniature fire out of its snout every few seconds at Potter. Potter shakes his head at it, but he looks amused.
Malfoy picks up his eclair with his bare hands and bites into it. He hums happily as he closes his eyes in contentment, and Harry has to look away. He doesn’t know how he makes it through Malfoy eating an entire eclair with such obvious enjoyment and his chest on display through his translucent shirt, but somehow, he does.
And then Draco’s suddenly angry. Potter’s been yanking him around, giving him warm smiles and drinking his coffee and holding him like he never wanted to let go and he
“A while, I think,” Harry says miserably. “I just never realised until the Amortentia. I was smelling you everywhere for days after that.”
Malfoy’s laughing a little too gleefully, a strangely familiar sound. What isn’t familiar is the way his eyes crinkle at the corner as he laughs, the way his face looks pleasant and amused instead of sharply mocking.
Potter sighs at that, running a frustrated hand through his messy hair. He knows as well as Draco does how the Ministry works. All the Departments that produce flashy press and political goodwill get almost unlimited funding, while the smaller divisions that deal with issues that the majority of the general public aren’t bothered with tend to get overlooked and ignored.
“Ugh, fine,” Draco says, crossing his arms and sulking, and obstinately refuses to help any further.
Cheng Wu, in the meantime, is a nice distraction. He’s quick on the uptake, and after Draco gives him a tour of their evidence storeroom, he suggests that they place tracking and tracing spells on the dragon exhibits and the wards. He shows Draco how they do it in Hong Kong, how they hide the spells within the wards; disguise it so it blends in seamlessly within the golden, shimmering net that goes up over the evidence stores, and Draco can't decide whether he likes Cheng Wu’s dazzling spellwork or his enchanting good looks more.
After a few days, Potter casually asks Draco to join him for lunch with Weasley. Draco looks at him, raising one eyebrow incredulously, and Potter just looks back at him steadily.
As Malfoy chatters on, they follow the trail of lights down the corridor, which ends in two lit wall sconces set on either side of a door that swings open as they approach. The lights in the bedroom flick on by themselves, and Malfoy crosses the threshold and immediately sneezes. The guest bedroom has clearly been unused for quite some time, and while it’s not covered in a layer of dust, it isn’t exactly up to Malfoy’s proclaimed standards of cleanliness either.
Draco doesn’t say anything. After a moment, he slips his hands out from underneath Potter’s jumper and takes Potter’s hands in his, guides them underneath the layers of his own clothes, to where Potter gratefully presses his palms against Draco’s skin, shapes it against the curve of Draco’s hip, his fingers tapping out an irregular beat against Draco’s hip bones.
Harry considers, looking around the lab. “Every time I look at something, it feels like there’s a spotlight on it. Like I’m zooming in on that object and that object only, and all my senses are focused solely on it. Is that supposed to happen?”
"Oh. Thank you." Draco blinks uncertainly across the table at him, and mentally reflects on how strange his life has become lately. In the last twenty-four hours alone, he’s hidden in a cupboard, survived an attack on his own office, and now he’s having breakfast and a civil conversation with Potter, and actually enjoying it. They talk a little more about the case, and Potter fiddles with his empty paper cup, eyeing Draco’s untouched drink until Draco finally offers to buy him another coffee.
“You little terror,” Draco says to it affectionately as he brings it back to his plate. The Horntail steps off his fingers and back onto porcelain, waving its spiked tail around grumpily, and goes back to attacking its cube of steak.
Then, whatever it is abruptly burns itself out and the smoke dissipates. The whole thing is over in less than five seconds, leaving the warehouse as clear as it was when they had first came in. Draco mutters a quick counterspell and breaks Potter’s shield charm, still thinking odd thoughts about Potter’s body, and all the things that he wants to do to Potter after pushing him up against a wall.
“It’s fine,” Malfoy says, but his face has gone white again. “I’m fine. Just a bit… sore. Listen, I’m sorry about earlier. That was unfair of me.”
Remus doesn’t say anything, just gestures to the bed and crosses his arms, tapping his foot in irritation against the worn carpet.
It doesn’t bother Harry, who spent eleven years waking up to a torrent of criticism and abuse from his relatives every day. Oddly enough, that makes the Portraits warm up to him, once they realise that he’s impervious to their taunts. The good thing about becoming sort-of friends with the Portraits is that they’ll shout verbal abuse at anyone who tries to sit at Harry’s table or approaches about getting an autograph when he’s just trying to spy on Malfoy in peace. The bad thing about being sort-of friends with a bunch of snooty Portraits is that they don’t spare Harry from their cascade of insults, although they’re far more tempered with him.
Harry doesn’t know what expression crosses his face at that, but he’s pretty sure it’s a look of blatant disbelief, because it elicits a scowl from Malfoy, who says, “Oh, what? Just because I’m a former Death Eater, I can’t open up a quaint, hipster coffee joint?”
“What do you mean?” Harry says, surprised. It had never occurred to him to ask where Malfoy had picked up all the different Portraits, although he had wondered at the seemingly mishmash of the different time periods and styles of painting.
“Mr. Malfoy’s arresting grey eyes are wide with disbelief. ‘I always knew Harry harboured strong feelings for me,’’’ Draco says in a falsetto, holding one hand to his chest and completely ignoring Harry. “‘I just never knew that the intensity of his feelings was actually…
“Start scooping some of this out into those beakers over there. We’ve got to start testing how long the effects of an infusion lasts. We’ll try for an hour, and work it out from there.” Malfoy points out the equipment standing in a row at the end of the table, and Harry gets to work.
It’s when Cheng Wu and Draco are in the midst of arguing over when to use ‘whom’ versus ‘who’ that Draco looks up and realises that Fossey and Potter have slipped out of the room. He can hear low voices in Shacklebolt’s office, but doesn't give it any more thought when Hannah tells Cheng Wu dreamily, "You’re absolutely right. Wow, did anyone ever tell you that you’re really smart?"
"Oh Potter," Draco breathes, "oh, you should see yourself. Do you like this? Being on your knees, moaning like a slut? You’re just begging for it."
“Fuck,” Harry says, panic growing in the pit of his stomach. Draco’s face is pale, and his skin is cold and clammy. The poison’s working too fast, and there’s still an assassin in the crowd.
Most of the fusions work well, except for one Saturday about a month and a half into their informal taste-testing sessions. That morning, Harry comes in to find Malfoy leaning over Cauldron Two, frowning slightly as he peers at the potion within.
Fossey believes him. Contrary to what everyone expected, she doesn’t fire Potter on the spot for shouting at the boss and actually cools down once he snaps. Their voices go low and conspiratorial, and then abruptly silent when Fossey casts a Silencing charm.
"The rarest thing we’ve got are the dragon parts," Draco says, and elaborates further at Potter’s raised eyebrow. "International smuggling gang. They deal in illegal dragon scales, fangs, claws, you name it. We’ve got a meeting-"
"Because I was trying not to take advantage of you! I wasn’t sure if you wanted it, and I wouldn’t just—I wouldn’t—"
Malfoy doesn’t answer for a moment. “No one,” he says evasively. “I did it to myself.” At Harry’s incredulous look, Malfoy sighs and elaborates: “Every time we spar and I hit the wall, or land on the mats.”
“Well, if you’re done trying to pass beyond the Veil, shall we head back to the laboratory then?” Malfoy stands and stretches, lifting his arms overhead. The sunlight behind Malfoy has turned his entire shirt transparent, and Harry tries not to let on that he’s very obviously staring at the long lines of Malfoy’s body.
future drink of choice before every job interview or major presentation. It’s taken me ages to get the Ministry to grant us a license to brew a Restricted Potion like this; I only got the final approval yesterday. It’s one of the more dangerous potions, this one, because the base of the potion is so volatile.”
“Yes?” Malfoy says, setting down the plate and sliding into the chair, and Harry stares at him. Malfoy’s hair is washed in gold by the late morning sun that slants through the windows of the shop, and he smells exactly like everything Harry has ever wanted.
Over by the counter, Susan’s watching them instead of working, her chin propped up on the base of her palm.
“But where’s the fun in that? ‘Break the Oath and lose your life’ is all fine and dandy for some people, but me? I personally like to ensure that the traitor’s around so that I can watch them suffer. And what better way than to push them into bankruptcy, ensure that they remain physically hideous several days a month for the rest of their lives, and guarantee that their future child will hate them?” There’s a twinkle in Malfoy’s eye, and he looks positively gleeful as he says it.
"There’s broken glass over here," a voice calls out, and then the sound of more footsteps as more people walk over. More shuffling, more whispers. Potter’s gone quiet, his body one long line of tension next to Draco.
He goes in to work the next day still in a pensive mood, and steps through the door to find a smiling Potter waiting for him at his desk as if the last few weeks never happened. His breath catches in his chest for a moment, but he doesn’t falter as he walks over.
Draco steps forward cautiously and examines the wards carefully. He traces the webbing, trying to untangle the intricacy of the spell. It’s unusual, and far more elaborate than anything he’s ever seen before. “I think there’s a curse attached to it that triggers if we try to take the wards down. I don’t think we should attempt it.”
Malfoy’s face had turned white when he finally picked himself up, but he had refused all of Harry’s attempts to heal him. “I’m fine. I’m perfectly capable of healing myself, Potter,” Malfoy had snapped, his face pinched and strained, and Harry had stepped back.
Potter nods to the warehouse directly in front of them. "The exhibits are in there. They must have dumped them and left."
“Obviously something went really wrong there. I think it’s best I shelf that one for the future.” Malfoy won’t look at him, but he won’t let Harry apologise either.
He whirls around and heads for the elusive door that leads to the back room, and Harry sees his chance. He follows hot on Malfoy’s heels, and shoves his foot into the gap as Malfoy’s about to close the door.
The rest of the morning stretches on, indeterminately long. It feels like an eternity before Malfoy finally suggests that they call it a morning. Harry’s more than happy to escape the confines of the lab and the way his stomach flips every time Malfoy so much as stands close to him, and leaves the back room without hesitation.
"Ah, Harry, how have you been?" Shacklebolt asks with genuine pleasure, then his face wrinkles again into a frown. "Hang on, weren’t you with the Aurors?"
“Perish the thought. This is for Pansy,” Malfoy says absently, running his finger down a page in his notebook. Harry carefully navigates his way around the maze of flowers until he’s standing next to Malfoy.
"Won’t say no to that," Potter says, his face brightening. Draco gets Potter another cup to go, and make their slow way back to the Ministry, still talking shop.
Malfoy’s obvious reluctance makes Harry curious about exactly what Malfoy’s got hiding behind those closed doors. His interest only peaks when Malfoy stops before a closed door that doesn’t automatically swing open like the others. Malfoy draws a quick sigil in the air with a finger, and the tell-tale shimmer of a ward goes down. Finally, the door swings open to reveal the universe.
“You really need to get a collar on that thing,” Draco says, although he likes the way it’s so obviously giving Potter the lip in dragon-speak. A dragon after his own heart, it is, and he can’t help giving it a fond look, which it returns sulkily, its eyes narrowed.
Then Potter comes to a halt in front of a blank wall, and he looks up to realise that Potter’s walked him all the way down to the dungeons. Belatedly, Draco realises that he’s cold, and that he’s been cold for a while now, and that they’re also right in front of the Slytherin rooms.
“Oh.” Harry shrugs uncomfortably at Malfoy’s back. “I mean, they all wear shirts with their sleeves down and cuffed. I figured that these were the Slytherins that had taken the Mark. Which, I realise now, is incredibly presumptuous of me, but, er. Yeah.”
"That would be the latter, actually," Potter says, grimacing, but doesn’t bother to elaborate further. He changes the subject then, asks them about the dragon smuggling case, and nods thoughtfully as Draco gives him a quick rundown on it. "So what happens once the tracing spell’s triggered?"
"Mad tyrant," Potter says cheerfully. Draco doesn’t see what’s so funny about coffee hoarding, and is considering how he can make Potter see just how seriously he takes his coffee, when Potter gets up and, true to his word, gets Draco another cup.
Now that he’s gotten one foot in the door, Harry takes the time to have a careful look around. The elusive back room appears to consist of two rooms: a larger one that they’re standing in, which is filled with crates upon crates of coffee beans apparently sent in from all over the world, and an unmarked door at the side. Harry easily picks out the tell-tale golden shimmer of a ward over the door, and he knows instinctively that whatever Malfoy’s
Potter’s hands settle on Draco’s shoulders, and then he’s pressing closer, pushing Draco up against the side of the cupboard—and Draco’s absolutely sure of it, Potter has a thing for pinning. Potter’s lips are hot on Draco’s neck, and he licks a long, slow stretch up Draco’s neck. He follows that up with a bite, sharp enough that it makes Draco jump, but not sharp enough to break skin. Potter closes his mouth around the wound and sucks, hard enough to leave a bruise, and Draco has to bite back the moan that crawls up his throat and fills his mouth.
Potter does an awkward shuffle on the spot, shifting his weight from one leg to the other before he finally says, “Fancy going down to Hogsmead with me tomorrow to pick one out?”
Draco shrugs, sipping at his drink. “One never knows with that man. If he had a sense of humour, he was perfectly deadpan about it.”
"Draco, you can’t go after them alone," Cheng Wu says, and there’s a note of genuine alarm in his voice and apprehension written all over his face. "You don’t know what these triads are like. They practically run the Hong Kong underworld, and you don’t get that to have that kind of power without spilling a lot of blood. We’ve been dealing with them for decades, and during that time their territory has only gotten bigger. Look, I’ll get the ping as well, so just wait for me to Port over with backup before you make a move."
“Up to evil-doing. This early in the morning?” They both look over to the Slytherin table where Draco’s grumpily pouring himself a cup of coffee, scowling down at some first-years laughing at the end of the table. They stop immediately, cowering under the force of his glare.
"Nice to know your manners haven’t improved the slightest, Malfoy," she shoots back, just as Potter slips back into the room, looking both pleased and nervous. He stops when he sees Draco and Hannah glaring at each other, and Cheng Wu coughing and laughing at the same time.
Malfoy acts perfectly natural when Harry knocks tentatively on the door the next day. He ushers Harry in as if nothing had happened, and chats breezily about what the Portraits have been up to over the last week, but goes still when Harry asks about the brews.
"Potter," Draco moans, right into Potter’s mouth, and belatedly, he realises that he’s hard too, his cock straining against the confines of his trousers. Potter must feel it, because he pulls back for just the barest of a fraction to flash a ghost of a smile; too many teeth and a promise of something dark, and then he goes right back to nipping at Draco’s lips. Potter mouths his way down Draco’s jawline, tracing the frantic, beating pulse under Draco’s skin until he reaches Draco’s neck. Draco can’t help the moan that escapes him as Potter bites down, worrying the flesh, before soothing it with a kiss. He does it again and again until Draco’s a shuddering and moaning mess, pinned tight to the cabinets, and then he drags his mouth up to capture Draco’s lips again in another bruising kiss.
Draco puts the apple down on the table, right next to Harry’s hand, and turns to walk away. Except that Harry says, “wait, you
Potter this morning, eyes downcast and face shuttered closed, unwilling or unable to even look at him.
“Hello to you too, Potter,” Draco says coolly. “Did you pay for this, or did you count on your fame to get away with free stuff again?”
Except that Harry sees this as his opportunity to finally get some proper investigative work done, and prove once and for all that Malfoy is
It’s a beautiful day today, with the sun warm on their faces and a gentle breeze blowing, so they order their usual fish and chips and head outside to the garden. The Muggles walk right on by, their eyes sliding away from the enchanted pub as if they can’t see it. Their table sits under the shade of a large tree, and every so often a stray leaf detaches itself and floats slowly down to the ground.
“What exactly are you teaching these kids?” Harry had said, simultaneously appalled and impressed. Every one of Malfoy’s techniques was similar to what they had taught in Auror training.
A tendril of suspicion begins to uncurl itself, though muted under the general mood of cheeriness that descends upon him like a fog. He’s lucid enough to cast a quick counter-spell on himself, just in case someone Cursed him, but that doesn’t do anything. It has to be the coffee. Testing his theory, Harry pulls out the obituaries and finds himself giggling uncontrollably over the death of poor old Mr Lester Fisherman, who found his way back to the Veil whilst engaging in his favourite pastime of de-Gnoming his rose garden.
That’s when the sharp, bright green of the Killing Curse flies over their heads, striking the wall next to the door.
“Oh for—” Malfoy snaps, visibly frustrated. He glares upwards at the ceiling, but the Manor does not respond.
“Oh yes,” Harry says immediately, “yes, please. I mean, that is, if you have the time.” He grins at Malfoy, inordinately relieved for reasons that he can’t explain.
“You’re brewing Amortentia?” Now it makes sense: why Malfoy’s in an unusually serious mood for Saturday, and why he’s got double the number of wards up. And really, Harry should have identified it straight off from the potion’s distinctive sheen, but he was distracted by Malfoy and his damn fingers.
been poisoned when his heart begins to pound and his breath quickens. Abruptly, he’s all too aware of Harry’s large, strong hand around his waist and pulling him close, and how warm Harry feels, pressed up against him.
Harry gapes as he follows Malfoy in, staring. A constellation of stars are scattered across the walls and ceiling of the room, so numerous that the room is lit with an almost unearthly glow from their twinkling. A luminous orb hangs motionless in the middle of the room, filling the room with a soft golden glow.
“Figures,” Draco says, looking fondly down at the dragon, who is tossing its head in a manner that is very obviously designed to draw attention to the golden collar shining around its neck. A dragon after his own heart,
—" Draco stops himself when he realises that he’s yelling, and glances back down the corridors. Still deserted, although oddly enough, he thinks he can hear the faint sound of wings flapping. He forces himself to take a step back, and continues in a much more calm, albeit bitter tone, "You just said you never wanted to—with me."
“A cow’s diarrhea would have tasted better than that swill you just fed me,” Harry says meanly. “And if I had wanted to have cow shit, I would have gone to Molly’s.”
By the end of a week, he quickly settles into a routine. He pops in after lunch, does a quick scan of the place to check for Malfoy, and if it’s not too busy, he takes a table next to the wall of whispering Portraits. No one likes sitting there because the Portraits have no qualms about passing cutting remarks about something as simple as the colour of your jumper until you either cried or left.
They open the door to the back garden to find it blanketed in white. It’s snowing again. Their shoes crunch on the frozen grass and fresh snow, chilled hands wrapped around their mugs of steaming hot chocolate. A flurry of snowflakes drift down to land in Draco’s hair, melting against his flushed cheeks. He sips at his hot chocolate as Potter fumbles with the bolt on the shed one-handed.
. Potter’s lips on his, easy and sweet like a cool summer’s day. Potter in those last few moments in the cupboard, begging him to be careful, an edge of desperation in his voice,
“What have you purchased there today?” One of the Portraits coos when Harry settles back into his table. It’s his least favourite Portrait, one of an elderly lady with a ridiculously huge ruffle fastened around her neck and her hands folded primly in front of her. The brass plate on the bottom of her frame says, very aptly, ‘Portrait of an Old Lady With Folded Hands’. Privately, Harry’s taken to calling her the Queen Elizabeth. She’s the one that all the other Portraits listen to, the one who launches the harshest insults and makes the most customers cry when they have the temerity (or stupidity) to sit beneath her frame.
“Of course,” Harry says at once, even as his heart does a strange little flutter against his ribs. “Of course we are. Friends.”
“Will you come with me to the broom shed? There’s something I want to show you.” Potter’s eyes are gleaming, and he looks excited.
Draco says, eyes narrowed dangerously, “what were the names of your relatives again? I promise it’s not because I intend to hunt them down and turn them into little cockroaches and stomp on them.”
Harry starts, and jerks upright. “Malfoy,” he says wonderingly, just as Malfoy walks over with a plate of eclairs.
"Minister, sir," Hannah says. She’s blushing all the way to the tip of her ears and darts a nervous glance at Cheng Wu. Cheng Wu gives her a smile that makes her fumble and drop her papers and clipboard. Draco catches Fossey’s eye, and the both of them roll their eyes simultaneously.
A month ago, everything had been fine, and he had actually allowed himself to entertain the possibility that he had friends. Friends who seemed to genuinely enjoy his company, who seemed to want to be around him because of who he
“Bruised Alihotsy leaves. And a lower flame when bringing the potion to a boil,” Malfoy says slowly.
He comes in the next day expecting Potter to be there, but there’s no one waiting for him. Draco’s surprised to find that he’s a little disappointed, but he doesn’t take it to heart. The meeting is today, and he buries himself in re-reading over the information on the Sun Yee On, a Hong Kong triad with ties that stretch over almost every single continent. They’ve been in operation for over a century, and they’re well-organised, powerful, and ruthless.
"Me?" Potter says, fury rising in his voice as he takes another step forward, and right into Draco’s personal space, until they’re practically nose to nose. "
"He’s with me," Potter says quickly, and their wands go down. He picks his way over an ocean of files strewn all over the floor to Draco, and steers Draco away to a corner.
“Next?” Draco says, slightly surprised. He hadn’t thought of anything beyond completing their errand, and now that that’s settled, he realises that they don’t have a reason to hang around each other anymore, but Harry’s face is bright and open and the dragon’s nuzzling Draco’s cheek, and Draco can feel himself being pulled into their orbit.
“Yes. Not to drink, mind you,” Malfoy adds. “This is Pansy’s great idea for her wedding. She wants me to soak the flowers and the petals in Amortentia so that the guests will smell all the things that they like during the ceremony. ‘Should make for interesting drama’, is what she said, but who is the one that has to pull this all together? That’s right,
“Did you see what those petty charlatans at the Tattler did,” is what Malfoy says indignantly when Harry comes in on Saturday, a spare copy of the magazine tucked under one arm.
“I was going to offer to use a towel, you prat.” Harry grabs the damp towel that Malfoy’s thrown onto the rack, and shakes it in Malfoy’s direction as proof.
“Malfoy,” Harry calls out as he turns the corner. He stops short at the sight of Malfoy, with his shirt rucked up halfway, trying to pull one arm through the sleeve of his shirt. Harry sucks a quick breath in through his teeth, and Malfoy twists around awkwardly at the sound.
Cheng Wu laughs too, dimpling handsomely as he rakes a hand through his black hair and winks. The journalists all collectively let out a faint sigh of appreciation, and Draco and Potter are forgotten in the next instant, which is exactly how Draco likes it.
Cheng Wu looks between the two of them, an amused expression on his face as he informs Potter helpfully, "Draco’s single. Very single. No boyfriend in sight, pity that. And this is my last day in London actually, I’m Porting back to Hong Kong tonight."
Smoke immediately begins to billow out from the broken pieces on the floor. Alarmed, Draco backs away, just as Potter throws a frantic
,” Harry breathes, and can’t stop staring at Malfoy. He feels unexpectedly defenseless, sitting here in Malfoy’s coffee shop decorated in Slytherin colours and crowded with Slytherin baristas and Portraits on the wall, and
a wanker.” Harry says, but there’s no heat behind his words. He smiles at Malfoy without meaning to, then stops when he catches himself at it, then finds himself smiling again in wonder as Malfoy lifts a lazy hand and fashions a quill out of thin air. It’s a fancy bit of magic, and Malfoy pulls it off effortlessly, his long fingers shaping itself around the quill until it solidifies in his hand.
The room clears faster than they thought would be possible once the conference ends, and Fossey is jubilant at having one of their cases in the limelight for once. "Well done, team," she keeps repeating, and happily thumps them all on the back as they walk back down to the office.
“It’s perfectly adequate,” Malfoy insists, although Harry doesn’t miss the way Malfoy furtively murmurs a quick cleaning spell under his breath. That done, Malfoy turns the tap—or tries to. It doesn’t move. He frowns, then tries turning it the other way around. “Huh.”
Draco goes into work the next day to find that Robards has, as usual, tried to portray it as an Auror win. Fossey’s raging in her office as she yells down the phone that this is
Potter’s still standing in the same spot as if he were rooted to it, his head bowed oddly, his wand hand lax at his side.
This song is amazing, and this was such a good prompt! I had to cut this short because it’s meant to be a mini-fic, but I already know I’m going back to flesh it out more. Enjoy some angst on me.
“You don’t even know what I was going to ask,” Potter objects, but he’s grinning, and continues, “I was going to say, do you think you’d like to have dinner with me on Friday?”
Harry watches as he writes something down in his notebook, worrying at his lower lip the entire time. There’s a particular lock of fair hair that falls forward to hang over his eyes, no matter how many times he pushes it back. Harry watches Malfoy shove at it impatiently, the cheekbones of his face lit up by the pale shine of the potion.
Harry’s nursing a cut on the fleshy part of his palm where the dragon’s sharp teeth have sliced through skin. Draco rolls his eyes, slipping his wand out of his robes as he reaches over to take Harry’s hand and casts a basic healing spell. The bleeding stops immediately, the edges of the wound knitting together, Harry’s skin painted a soft golden under the glow of the spell. Harry’s hand is warm in his, and he can feel Harry’s pulse rabbiting under where his thumb rests gently on Harry's wrist.
“It’s so flavourful,” Harry says, sipping at it again. The coffee feels like liquid satisfaction sliding down his gut, and he closes his eyes for a second to concentrate on the flavour. “There’s a lovely crisp, rich flavour, with a hint of cherries, I think? It tastes a bit fruity. Maybe a bit of grapefruit in there? And something floral that I can’t pinpoint.”
Draco takes a deep breath. Steels himself. Then slowly, carefully, he slides one shaking hand from Potter’s hip down to the waistband of Potter’s jeans, deliberately slides two fingers underneath the band. Potter sucks in a shocked, noisy breath, and goes still. Draco waits for a moment, for Potter to push him away in disgust, and when Potter doesn’t do anything of the sort, he forges ahead, mirrors Potter and says, "May I?"
“What happened here?” Harry says finally, once he’s managed to find his voice. “Have you finally decided to give up on the coffee business?”
Harry doesn’t say anything though, just kneads his fingers down Malfoy’s scalp, circling his fingertips against where he thinks the pressure points are on the nape of Malfoy’s neck. Malfoy’s skin is warm, and he doesn’t want to stop touching Malfoy. Malfoy doesn’t seem to mind. He tilts his head slightly to the left, giving Harry better access, and Harry keeps at it until the shampoo suds in Malfoy’s hair begins to dissipate.
“Good night Draco,” Harry says quietly, taking a step closer to Draco and looking up at him through dark lashes, the light casting shadows against his face. “And Merry Christmas.”
"I’ve got one in mind." Potter grabs his hand and pulls him down the next corridor, then up a flight of stairs, and halfway down another corridor. He stops in front of a non-descript door built into the wall, and opens it up to another cupboard.
"Look Potter, it’s fine." Draco interrupts, and the sick feeling settles back in the pit of his stomach as if it had never left. "You didn’t want to, and you wouldn’t have done it if not for the potion. That’s fine. Me too," he lies, and Potter looks suddenly upset.
Harry carefully averts his eyes, even though Malfoy’s right, it’s nothing he hasn’t seen before in the Auror locker rooms. But it’s somehow different, here in Malfoy’s large bathroom where painted dragonflies flit across the walls as steam begins to rise up from the tub.
“Pat it dry, don’t rub it. That causes breakage,” Malfoy says, sniffing, and Harry rolls his eyes but does as Malfoy says and carefully pats his hair with the towel until it isn’t dripping anymore. Being so close to Malfoy when he’s fresh out of the bath is intoxicating, and because Harry’s lost his mind completely, he continues patting Malfoy’s hair until Malfoy says, “Thanks Potter, I think that’s as dry as it’ll get.”
“Malfoy,” he says, when he finally feels like himself again, but Malfoy cuts him off before he has the chance to apologise.
"I’m fine," he says to Potter, and then looks past Potter’s shoulder to Cheng Wu, "They’ve got wards here to keep us in; be careful of the door."
Draco lets loose a stream of creative swear words at the spot where Cheng Wu stood, but it’s said with a lot of affection and fondness. He turns around, still thinking—and meets Potter’s gaze where Potter’s standing by the door, hands awkwardly stuffed in his pockets.
It’s Malfoy who breaks the kiss first, Malfoy who pulls away. “Potter,” he whispers, eyes huge and startled.
"Our wands," Potter says suddenly, his voice hoarse, and tugs Draco over to where their wands lie discarded and forgotten on the cold concrete floor. He swallows, and Draco watches his throat working as he forces out a confession: "I can’t fight in this state. Not when I… I know I’m going to be constantly trying to feel you up. We’d better hide in the cupboard and see if we can at least try to get the element of surprise on them when they arrive."
He sends it off before he realises that he’s committed himself to going back. Well, he thinks, at least he’s got a whole week to think up another excuse to avoid Malfoy.
Suspicions confirmed, Harry makes his way back to the counter, trying to hold back laughter. Predictably, Grim Graham doesn’t bother to look up at his approach.
Now that Harry’s gotten a good look at the back room, his interest in Malfoy has skyrocketed. He can’t fathom what Malfoy’s up to: illegal coffee smuggling? Money-laundering in coffee beans? Is that even a thing? None of that makes sense. Annoyingly, the popularity of Malfoy’s shop continues to grow, which suggests that for all intents and purposes, he’s running a perfectly legit operation. And yet, Harry can’t shake the suspicion curling in his gut that Malfoy’s
“It goes on like that for a while. I used to spend ages trying to touch every one and memorize as much information as I could. It’s how I got top marks for Astronomy, you know. Well, that, and also because I am a natural genius.”
It’s actually pretty genius, although Harry’s not about to say that. What he does say instead is, “Malfoy, you’re absolutely bonkers,” and then as an aside, muttered under his breath, “I call her the Queen Liz.”
At his yell, the Aurors have started to spring into action, their wands out and working their way through the crowd towards Harry and Draco, trying to form a defensive perimeter. Distantly, Harry wishes Ron and Hermione were here to back him up, but Hermione’s in her third trimester and Ron’s with her at home, doting on her every need.
Behind him, Fossey is saying, "—just five minutes, really, we won’t take up too much of his time," and the secretary is caving, rolling her eyes as she picks up the phone. A short conversation later and she waves them in through the large double doors opposite her desk.
“You’re welcome. And Harry, that package you were waiting for is in the broom shed. Now shoo! Leave me in peace to get dinner ready.”
There’s another uproar at that, and almost every journalist springs to their feet, all of them shouting out questions at once. Draco turns to stare at Potter, amazement plainly written all over his face, and Potter just looks back at him steadily, giving nothing away. Draco has difficulty swallowing around the sudden lump in his throat. His mind is racing with a million questions.
Time ticks by, and then Cheng Wu’s month-long attachment is up. Draco takes him out for lunch on the last day, down to a pub that he’s come to love while he’s been staying in London. The curious thing about the pub is that it’s magical, but it’s located right on the boundary of Muggle London. The owners have threaded that thin line by glamouring the outside so that it looks like a derelict and rundown building to the Muggles, and have heaped a bunch of Notice-me-nots and Remember-me-nots on top of it. Cheng Wu likes it for the spellwork, for the centuries of old magic layered on top of each other, and sighs over the intricacy of it every time they come, running an admiring hand over the stone walls as the spells glimmer and snake under his hand.
“Everyone’s overly concerned about safety nowadays,” Blaise scoffs. “You’ve got to let a child break a couple of bones. That’s what childhood is for.”
Harry yelps and drops the Tattler as it bursts spectacularly into the flame, soft ash raining down onto the pristine floor of the laboratory.
, but he’s sure that Malfoy’s trained the Slytherins well enough that they know how to keep up a cover.
, that’s the turning point right there. Draco blinks in surprise at having Weasley on his side for once, and then almost instantly, they both turn on Potter.
Cheng Wu’s practically bouncing with excitement as they walk to the Port points, enthusiastically telling Draco that this is going to put both their divisions on the map. Draco doesn’t pay him the least bit of attention. He’s too busy processing what just happened–Potter’s transferring, no, Potter has
“Version Nine, actually.” Malfoy shrugs when Harry gives him an exasperated look. “I wasn’t going to risk trying it out on anyone else until I knew I had the mix stabilized. And you know you would have done the same, so I don’t want to hear anything about it, Potter,” he adds, and Harry closes his mouth with a snap. He mines zipping up his lips, which elicits a small sigh from Malfoy, though he finally sets about putting together Version Nine.
. They must have triggered after a certain time once something crosses over the threshold. I’m pretty sure there must be an in-built alarm that sends off an alert once the wards are triggered."
Malfoy stays silent, and just as Harry’s wondering what to do next, Malfoy finally says, “What do you mean, ‘giving the Slytherins a second chance’?”
"I was, sir. Got transferred over." Harry doesn’t elaborate any further then necessary, and Shacklebolt’s puzzled frown only deepens.
Minister Shacklebolt looks harried, as they troop into his office—more plush carpeting, coupled with gilded gold furnishings on the furniture—and gets up to shake Fossey’s hand as she strides forward confidently.
"To a division under the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures," Shacklebolt says doubtfully. "Right. I see." It’s quite clear that he doesn’t.
Draco shrugs helplessly. "You’ve seen our offices," he reminds Potter. "You know how many people we have."
Draco’s laughing so hard he’s wheezing, and they have to stop so that he can get his breath back, and so that Harry can slowly untangle the dragon. Draco’s absolutely no help at all in that regard; he just leans against a tree and snickers every time Harry accidentally pulls on his own hair. At the end of it, Harry’s hands are all scratched up, and his eyes are watering from the pain of the dragon’s sharp teeth. He thrusts the dragon in Draco’s direction with an unceremonious, “here,
Draco expects it to be hot and wet and messy like before, but this kiss is different. It’s slow and sweet. Potter kisses him easily, like he’s been doing it all his life, slides his tongue into Draco’s mouth, and pulls back to laugh softly when Draco moans. Potter brushes Draco’s bottom lip with the pad of his thumb, his palm cupping Draco’s cheek tenderly, and Draco turns his face to nuzzle Potter’s hand.
The rest of the Portraits have all edged away, because Queen Liz tends to carry on once she gets into one of her moods. Harry nods and tunes her out as she carries on monologuing. He’s flipping through the morning newspaper and not paying much attention, so it comes as a surprise when he takes another sip of coffee and finds himself inadvertently smiling down at an article depicting the gruesome details of the latest victim of the Loch Ness up in Scotland.
? You’re the one who just said you wouldn’t—with me. You said that it was all the potion, and I don’t understand what you want!"
“Oh is it your first time,” Draco says blandly, “whoops, did we forget to send the Gryffindors the invites?”
A month ago had been their last good day. And now everything’s shot and gone to hell, and he doesn’t even know what happened, and he’s alone again. Draco breathes out slowly and closes his eyes, cataloguing thoughts and moments: Potter’s hands on him, warm, and steady, and sure. Potter’s voice in his ear, ragged and rough as he asks quietly,
"Sure," Draco says, and refuses to allow himself to wonder why Potter didn’t just send over a message instead.
“Dinner was fine,” Draco says, swinging one leg over the bench. “What was not was your dragon being an absolute terror. Honestly Potter, it’s got no manners whatsoever! I think it nearly took Nott’s finger off at one point.”
Harry’s at a loss of what to do, and stands there looking hopelessly at Malfoy’s hunched back, at the tight line of tension between his shoulders. Then he realises Malfoy's shuddering. He reaches out and places a tentative hand on Malfoy’s back, fully expecting Malfoy to shrug him off. Malfoy doesn’t, so he rubs slow, comforting circles on Malfoy’s back, feeling Malfoy’s sharp shoulder blades tremble under his palm. He doesn’t say anything, and Malfoy doesn’t move, and they stay like that until Malfoy stops shaking.
It’s only when Potter begins to swell with indignation, two flushed spots of colour beginning to appear on his cheeks, that Draco realises that Potter thinks Draco’s insulting him. They haven’t spoken since Potter testified on his behalf at his trial, glaring out at the Wizengamot as he told them how Draco and Narcissa had both saved his life, twice. It hadn’t impressed the judges.
“Would I risk being quartered and hung from the rafters for forgetting?” Potter says, and holds up a Saintsbury plastic bag. “Of course I did.”
And now there’s a steady stream of people coming in, and the Portraits’ murmuring grows louder until it becomes a steady buzz of disapproval, so that’s his peaceful morning cuppa gone.
“Mother and I used to have a little side, bet on how long Narcissa could tolerate it before she would jump in and change the subject,” Blaise says, smiling mistily into the distance. “I had plenty of pocket money that year, thanks to you.”
He’s still in Potter’s arms. Potter’s hands haven’t shifted from where they’re placed on his hips, holding him in place, and now Potter pulls him forward, shifts one hand to fit an arm around Draco’s back. Potter doesn’t say a word, but his fingers are gentle on Draco’s jaw as he tilts Draco’s face just a fraction. And then Potter’s mouth finds Draco’s in the darkness, their lips pressing against each other, and Potter opens Draco’s mouth up with his tongue.
"Nope, just Harry," Potter says cheekily, and Draco huffs out a laugh. He tucks his cock in and tugs up his trousers, then reaches out a hand and pulls Potter up.
Potter laughs, but grabs two mugs of steaming hot chocolate off the table and hands one to Draco, who reaches past him to grab a handful of marshmallows piled up on a plate. Harry watches and copies him, and they grin at each other as they leave the kitchen. Draco takes a large sip of his hot chocolate, and is delighted to find it thick and frothy, just the way he likes it.
“Oh for Merlin’s sake,” Malfoy says, and goes over to a cupboard at the far end of the room that Harry hadn’t noticed. He comes back with an unlabelled flask that he shoves at Harry and a piece of paper that he places on the table. “Drink this.”
He watches as Potter’s face lights up, how his whole being radiates joy. Potter reaches out a hand and tugs Draco to him, and Draco goes willingly, disbelieving to Potter’s side.
“Er, it’s reddish,” Harry says doubtfully. Malfoy snorts, and nudges him out of the way to scowl down at the potion.
"Sorry," Potter whispers, and there’s something frayed and desperate in the way he says it, in the way he tugs Draco closer, his hands skittish on Draco’s hips. Draco can feel it, the potion working underneath their skins, hot and itchy and demanding more.
He puts Harry through a series of field tests, which ends, much to both their surprise, with Harry actually striking up a proper conversation with Graham the Grim for once. Graham eyes Harry suspiciously the entire time, but at least he’s answering with more than two words during the five minutes that Harry manages to keep the conversation going before the effects finally wear off.
“Well, can’t you call him?” Harry darts a quick, desperate look around the shop, to the dozen shocked faces staring at him, to where the Portraits are quietly tittering away.
“Right. Okay.” There isn’t anything left to say, so Harry just gets his things. “I really am sorry,” he says softly as he stands at the threshold, and then he lets the door swing shut behind him.
“You traitor,” Malfoy hisses, and Harry raises an eyebrow before he realises that Malfoy’s talking to the Manor. “Fine! The Blue Room then!”
Shacklebolt sends them all off into a side room with Hannah, who sets about crafting a speech from scratch. They work through lunch and Fossey keeps an anxious eye on the clock as time ticks by: an hour, then two. Hannah hammers out a rough draft that Shacklebolt runs a practised eye over and quickly approves, which they then work on refining.
Time passes by in a whirlwind of events after that: a mad rush as they get ready, Hannah briefing them on what to say and what not to say. Two o’clock rolls around, and they hold the press conference in the usual press room in the Ministry, Fossey standing up on stage next to Shacklebolt as he details the setting up of a successful joint task force with Hong Kong. The next part is unexpected–Shacklebolt pauses, looking around at the throng of eager journalists and the cameras flashing, and turns to Fossey and says, "I’ll let Director Diana Fossey tell you the details of the operation."
“Keep your chin up, boy, it can’t be all that bad. Why, you’ve never known the agony of being rescued from a charity shop. A charity shop! Can you imagine? A painting of my pedigree, and not even afforded the dignity of an open auction!” The Admiral says comfortingly from the frame next to Queen V’s.
Silence stretches before them like an ocean as Malfoy looks at him, his face suddenly unreadable and expressionless. Finally, he says, very quietly, “Because it’s not a big deal, Potter. It’s nothing life-threatening, and I’m completely fine, as you can see—”
He doesn’t expect to get a reply, and is startled when the owl comes back a short while later, tapping impatiently at his window. There’s a note wrapped around a vial. It’s a decaf shot for general fevers, aches, and sores, the note informs, and goes on to advise rest and plenty of water. Harry guiltily writes out a short note of thanks, and promises to pop by the following Saturday.
Potter just rolls his eyes at that and doesn’t bother replying, though there’s the hint of a blush on his cheeks. They have just enough time to grab their breakfast to go, and Draco gives in to the inevitable and orders himself two cups of coffee. He hands Potter the second cup while they’re in the lifts back in the Ministry, "so you don’t go around acting as if you’re deprived," and Potter gives him a smile that lights up his entire face. It sends something stirring in the pit of Draco’s stomach.
“For me?” Draco says. He sets the mugs down on a nearby shelf and steps forward, running his hands over the top of the box. It’s oak, and it smells like vanilla as his fingers trace the wood grain.
Neville and Luna appear in an instant, and Luna just takes one look before she shakes her head. “He needs St. Mungo’s,” she says, digging into her robes and passing Harry a small vial of something viscous and blue. “Two drops into his mouth.”
Malfoy looks slightly taken aback at how fast Harry assents. He slants a quick glance at Harry, his eyes sliding down Harry’s body, which reminds Harry that he’s still shirtless and clad in only a towel. He’s suddenly unsure of what to do with his arms, and crosses them defensively over his bare chest as Malfoy’s lips quirk up.
! Luna goes to Draco’s other side, slings Draco’s arm over her shoulder, and together, she and Harry make for the door, Draco’s limp body dangling in between them.
“Mr. Malfoy’s arresting grey eyes are wide with disbelief. ‘I always knew Harry harboured strong feelings for me,’’’ Malfoy says in a falsetto, holding one hand to his chest as he completely ignores Harry. “‘I never knew that the intensity of his feelings was actually…
There are singed marks on the walls, piles of files knocked haphazardly onto the floor, loose sheets of paper floating in the air, and a large patch of scorched carpet right by his desk. Draco takes in a deep breath as he glances around the office, taking in the damage, and says very calmly, "Well, I suppose it could be worse."
He hands his mug of hot chocolate to Draco, and strides forward to drag out a large wooden box set against the wall.
There’s a lot of work to be done and Harry throws himself into it. It’s menial, repetitive labour, and just the thing to take his mind off the way Malfoy touches his arm when he squeezes past Harry, or the way Malfoy’s arse looks in his jeans when he bends over to grab a handful of petals from the overflowing sacks on the floor.
"No, I was trying to apologise for last night, you git!" Potter has no such qualms about keeping his voice down, and his face is red with emotion. "That wasn’t how I wanted the first time I kissed you to turn out, and I was afraid that you thought that I only did it because of the potion!"
“Very undignified of you,” Malfoy informs lightly. There’s a smirk on his face, though, and maybe it’s that familiar twist of Malfoy’s lips, hovering on the thin edge of a sneer, that makes Harry pick up his apple and bite into it somewhat rebelliously. He holds Malfoy’s gaze the entire time, but Malfoy barely reacts. He looks bored, and waits until Harry has a mouthful of apple before he tosses out a casual, “Well, be seeing you, Potter,” and walks away.
“Cheers, Malfoy, carry on please,” Harry says. Days of sitting by the Portraits, learning to tune them out as they slagged him off has made him fairly immune to sarcasm. Malfoy glares at him, and he looks so reminiscent of a confused, rumpled owl that Harry has to bite back a laugh. Years of experience as an Auror has taught him that laughing at a suspect is not conducive to getting them to share their darkest secrets.
Potter’s looking between them, bemused. “I think a broom would be a great idea. But maybe not a racing one, Andromeda might not be that thrilled if Teddy gets another fast toy.”
"If they try to raid the office again, we should let them succeed," Cheng Wu says. It’s a daring suggestion that Fossey doesn’t like.
They go down to the living room, the lights flickering on and lighting a path before them as they move from room to room. The fireplace obligingly roars to life as Malfoy collapses into an armchair, and Harry takes a chair opposite him.
. Draco’s starting to wonder if this might be a thing with Potter—not that he’s complaining, in fact he kind of likes this, likes Potter holding him down—and then stops thinking as Potters cups Draco’s jaw and kisses him, open-mouthed and wet and messy.
Potter hesitates. “Erm, no,” he says at last. “No name ever felt right, and then after a while, everyone in the dorms got used to calling it ‘dragon’ and the name stuck.”
And that’s not really the point, but Draco shrugs, says, “On the whole? Probably. There’s just something unlikable about his face.”
“The shampoo’s over there. Mind the mascot, he’s a saucy one,” he says, lifting one soapy arm to point, and Harry retrieves the bottle. It’s a French brand, and the mascot on the front—a shirtless man who keeps running his hands through his long, flowing black hair—gives Harry a little wink and a cheery wave. Harry settles himself on the top step, and sits at the edge of the tub. There’s a pitcher of water at the side, and Harry’s surprised to find a slight tremble in his hands when he picks it up.
“Oh, of course you have,“ Malfoy’s saying, waving his hands around, and Harry’s heart stops beating for a second before Malfoy continues, “in hindsight it’s obvious, isn’t it? You copied my every move, right down to having two minions at your beck and call. Ooh, this is one for the papers, this is. I can see the headlines already, Boy-Who-Lived Confesses to Stalking Former Schoolmate. Exclusive interview with the harassed victim on page 2.”
He tenses as footsteps approach the cupboard, and prepares himself for the possibility of death. He’s had a good run, these last couple of years, and a crazy moment with Potter in a cupboard. He has no regrets. It’s a good way to go. Absently though, he wishes he had more time.
Of course Harry would deny it, no one wants to admit that they have unusual sexual kinks when the entire Wizarding World has an idealised version of who they should be. They stroll into Hogsmeade, still arguing over whether Harry enjoys pain, sexually or not.
“It tastes funny,” Harry insists, giggling madly at his own joke. He wipes tears of laughter out of his eyes. “Grimster, I would like you to ring for the manager, please. Especially if that manager is Malfoy.”
Potter pulls off just long enough to say, "Keep talking dirty, Draco, please," and then goes back to sucking. He looks up from under a layer of hair that falls into his eyes, his lips wet and tight around Draco’s cock, and Draco abruptly blows out his breath in a noisy moan at the sight.
Malfoy blows out a breath. “I might need some help taking a shower,” Malfoy admits, sounding grumpy. “I need to wash my hair, and I can’t quite lift my arm above my shoulder.”
Potter takes over then. "I’ve contacted Lee Jordan, and he’s got everything set for two o’clock. The press knows there’s going to be a big announcement, just not what it is."
He doesn’t know how he makes it through the next hour with Malfoy bustling around the laboratory, reaching up for things and bending over, while constantly smelling a reminder of Malfoy, but somehow he does. And then they’re done for the day, and Harry quickly makes his excuses and hurries out of the shop and away from everything connected to Malfoy.
The corridors on the walk back to the dungeons is blessedly empty and quiet for once, except for the occasional creak of metal as the suits of armour shift around. Draco tells Harry how the Slytherins found Peeves trying to possess one once, and how strange it looked, with Peeves trying to make the suit dance and the suit jerkily counteracting all of Peeve’s movements and complaining all the while in its metallic, creaking voice. Harry laughs at the story, and then laughs again when Draco tries to imitate the suit dancing, all the way until they reach the dungeons.
“It strains our diplomatic ties with our allies!” Harry had said heatedly, but strength of conviction alone that Malfoy was
"Do you understand English," Potter wheezes, choking out each word, and Draco laughs right along with him. It feels good, it feels like it clears the air between them. Relief floods through him, that they’re both alive, that they’re not alone in this, that they’re okay.
, please, yes," Potter breathes, and Draco shakily undos Potter’s jeans in the dark, feeling for the button, and then the fly. The sound of the zipper sliding down is startlingly loud in the enclosed space, and Draco hesitates once Potter’s jeans are open. Potter stays completely still, and it’s that little gesture, of trying to give Draco the space to make a decision, that makes Draco brave.
Potter’s wand is dimly lit. It casts a small pool of light around them that cuts through the darkness, and in its faint illumination Draco makes out a large work table and a row of cupboards and cabinets at the far end, as well as something glittery that lines a wall on one side of the warehouse. Another faint shiver of unease runs down Draco’s spine as he moves towards the wall, drawn in inexorably like a fish on a line.
“How did you guess?” Potter says, leaning against a counter and smiling down at the back of Ginny’s head.
“Thanks,” Malfoy says distractedly, and reaches out to absently pat Harry on his arm. Harry bites back a sigh.
But this thing—where he avoided Harry, and didn't allow Harry to heal his injuries—this was new, and Harry didn't know what to make of it. This was at odds with the Malfoy he knew, the Malfoy who had always played up his many little injuries, who had cheerfully complained as he made a giant production of his bruises and cuts, and who made Harry buy him a round at the pub in compensation. And here they were now, with Malfoy insisting that he was fine, except that he clearly was not.
Malfoy nods. “My mother’s perfume, coffee, and the smell of your jumper.” He hesitates for a moment. “You smell like lavender fabric softener. I knew it was you the moment I smelled it.”
, just goes through the motions dutifully each day, and waits patiently for the next turn in his life. It’s not a good feeling, and for a long moment he thinks of writing to his mother, tucked away in their French villa where she can pretend that the last decade never happened. Instinctively, he knows that while Narcissa loves him, however, she has never understood him. The vastly different choices that they each made after the trials proved it. And so here is he, staring into the gathering darkness of Malfoy Manor, wondering how his life turned out this way.
They meet in a tangle of frantic hands and eager mouths, and Potter’s got Draco pushed up against the wall,
Just talking about it brings the memories back. Those were some of the best days of Draco’s life, the sweet summer wind in his face and the feel of the broomstick beneath his hands. How he could fly for hours, the sun warming his skin, and how he would land in the woods for a short rest whenever he got tired. Eating a late lunch of ham sandwiches under a shady tree, listening to the birdsong while he watched the sunlight dapple through the trees, turning everything soft and golden.
Malfoy gives up on pulling on the door and opts instead for smiling at Harry in a manner that unnerves him. “Why, of course, Potter, do come in so that I can list in
“Dis-gus-ting,” Malfoy says, pronouncing each syllable with careful exaggeration. “Potter, I said I wanted to
Malfoy’s darting around the room as he speaks, picking up vials and filling them and pulling out half-filled glass flasks from a small fridge standing next to the cupboard. He’s a blur of activity as he mixes and pours, and finally he presents Harry with five glass flasks, each one neatly labelled from one to five. Unsurprisingly, the liquid in every one of them is a dark coffee-brown.
“Yes, yes,” Sirius says comfortingly, “I’ll let you.” He waves his wand and turns off the lights, and is asleep within minutes.
It turns out that Malfoy is still some ways from a best-seller. The first two versions make Harry’s eyes water as steam shoots out comically from his ears. It also makes his hair stand up from the top of his head, which sends Malfoy into hysterics.
Malfoy gives Harry a confused look. “I gave you a mis-brewed fusion coffee, and then acted improperly when you had no choice but to ride out the effects of something that I inflicted on you. Why wouldn’t I be apologising?”
"Oh for Pete’s sake," he says in exasperation, after Draco makes another veiled insult about Weasley’s family and certain similarities to rabbits, and Draco scowls and demands, "Well what did you expect? What great plan did you have in mind, other than, ‘oh, let’s put them together and force them to get along?’"
“Hello!” Potter calls out cheerfully, once he’s finally free of the scarf, and gets back a chorus of, “Hullo Harry!” from the group scattered around the living room.
"So that’s why they left the exhibits unguarded," Potter says. He’s already on the move, already prowling the length of the warehouse, searching for a way out. There’s a row of cabinets in the back that he goes through, opening each one methodically.
After a while, Draco comes to the slow, dawning realisation that he'll have to quit. He can’t sit there, day after day, across the table from Potter and not think about how safe he felt in Potter’s arms, while Potter looks away and flinches everytime they accidentally touch each other. As much as he wants to, Draco can’t chalk up that moment in the cupboard to the sheer insanity of the lust potion. That moment has left him too flayed open to be able to lie to himself about it.
Draco smiles. “I’m only joking Potter, lead the way.” A thrill runs through him again as Potter grins back.
“Do me a favour? Try not to let a French pastry kill you off in my shop. It’s bad for business,” Malfoy says. There’s a half-smile on his face as he says it, the right side of his mouth curling up into an amused look that Harry must have seen a thousand times. Harry’s certain that it’s never made his heart beat this rapidly until now.
Malfoy’s mouth works furiously, but no sound comes out. Harry giggles. Finally, Malfoy says, very flatly to Grimster, “We’ll discuss this later,” and to Harry, “You! Come with me.”
They Apparate into the middle of a street flanked by a long row of warehouses that sit silent and dark on each side like squat little toads. Potter hurries them into the shadows, and Draco immediately sends out Scrying spells. Little red tendrils tentatively sprout from the end of his wand before cutting off and disappearing into the shadows like smoke, drifting and twisting as they slide in under shuttered doors and through the cracks in the windows. They wait until each tendril comes sliding back, all of them white as they wind themselves back against Draco’s wand and slowly sink back into the wood.
When he finally steps out, a blast of hot steam curling outwards from the open door and a towel wrapped around his waist, it’s to the quiet dripping of the taps and a deserted locker room. He takes a quick glance down the row, but the doors to each shower stall are open, and there’s no sight of Malfoy.
“Erm, I’ll just let you get cleaned then,” Harry says awkwardly. He doesn’t know where to look when Malfoy’s naked and wet and smiling like that, and pushes himself to his feet.
He blows his breath out in a sigh–and directly onto Potter’s face. "Oops, sorry, sorry," Draco whispers, as he tries to move away so he isn’t breathing onto Potter anymore. Except there isn’t anywhere for him to move to, with the sides of the cupboard pressing in on either side of them, and all he ends up doing is rubbing himself against Potter’s chest. One of his legs has somehow gotten entwined in between Potter’s, and Draco twists like a salmon in a net as he tries to carefully extricate himself.
There’s silence after that, a silence that stretches uncomfortably long until Cheng Wu abruptly changes the topic, and talks about the latest potion enhancing scandal in the Asian Quidditch League. Potter stays unhappily quiet, but Draco grateful takes up the mantle, talking cheerily as they eat their food. By the time they all finish their meals, Potter’s sufficiently recovered enough to join back in on the conversation, and they walk back to the Ministry together, chatting companionably away. Potter bids the both of them farewell by the lifts, a strange light in his eye, and Draco’s relieved that they part on relatively good terms.
When Malfoy looks up again some minutes later, there’s a large streak of ink across his right cheekbone. “Okay, I think I have it,” he announces.
“No, I’ll pass on that drying charm that you’re clearly thinking of, Potter. Have you learnt nothing? Charms like that are far too crude and interfere with my shampoo, and then where would I be? Back to having dry straw for hair, and maybe some people would be fine with that, but I hope you have come to realisation that I am
, and all they want is the details of where the Hong Kong press conference is going to be held before they rush away to organise Portkeys over.
Malfoy shakes his head. “No, no, no, Victoria was the prudish one, not Liz. You need to get your queens straight. She’s definitely a Vicky.”
Draco goes for lunch alone. He heads to Cheng Wu’s favourite pub, where he orders his usual and takes the table under the tree. It’s an overcast day, and there’s no one outside in the garden, which suits his mood just fine. He finishes his lunch and stretches out like a cat, head tilted over the back of his chair until he’s staring up at the branches of the tree, watching the weak sunlight filter through the shifting leaves.
Draco snatches it out of his hand immediately with a sneer and a, “absolutely not, that’s far too bright and it hurts my eyes. Do you
There’s a table tucked away in the corner of the Hufflepuff common room where they’ve stashed the alcohol, and Draco comforts himself from the horror of the Gryffindors invading the Christmas party by musing over the selection. For all their faults, at least the Hufflepuffs aren’t stingy, and there’s a nice variety of alcohol lined up in colourful glass bottles.
, thanks for offering Potter! I’ve been having such a hard time finding taste testers! None of the Slytherins want to do it anymore, and I’ve had to resort to trying them out on myself like a common lab rat.”
Across the rows of lockers that stand between them, Malfoy sighs, a soft sound that stretches out into a muffled groan. Harry can hear the edge of pain that laces through it. Malfoy had taken a particularly brutal throw during the last round of their sparring. He had twisted in the air in an attempt to land on his feet, but had badly misjudged the angle and had ended up landing on the floor instead of the mat. There had been an audible crunch where Malfoy had slammed shoulder-first against the hard floor.
“Malfoy, you massive nerd,” Harry says, laughing, and Malfoy flushes scarlet. “No, I didn’t mean it in a bad way. This room is amazing, and I’m not making fun of that. I’m making fun of you actually being, well, smart. Although that’s kind of impressive? I, mean, er—” Harry flounders and stops, trying to put his jumbled thoughts in order.
He makes no move to walk away though, and Cheng Wu obligingly shifts his chair over, saying, "No, please, you’d be doing me a favour. You’re famous in Hong Kong, and you won’t believe how popular I’ll be once my colleagues find out I had lunch with Harry Potter."
“Right. Whose Vicky?” Harry asks. The stool is far more comfortable then it looks, and a cushion obligingly pops out of nowhere as he takes a seat.
They sip their drinks in contemplative silence, until the ball of ice melts and Malfoy finally says, “Potter, I don’t mean to pry, and you’re more than welcome to tell me to fuck off, but do you… do you need any help with Grimmauld Place?” Malfoy sounds tentative, and Harry catches Malfoy sneaking a glance at him over the rim of his glass.
“Yes, alright, Potter, you can stop trying to explain. I get what you’re trying to say, although your communication skills really leave much to be desired. It’s fine, I’ve uncovered your dark secret: you’re hopeless. And you’ve uncovered my dark secret: I am extremely uncool, and if you tell anyone about this, I will murder you in your sleep and frame Ron Weasley, so!”
It had taken another day of Potter testifying, and half a day of closing arguments and deliberations, but in the end, Potter’s dogged insistence won out. The political outcry at their acquittal was far more muted than Draco thought it would be, but everything was still too new, the political landscape too fragile for anyone to make any big moves against the Boy Who Won the Entire Fucking War On His Own Back, and they knew it.
Potter laughs. “Vomit is Teddy’s love language,” he says. “He’s remarkably consistent about it too, he always seems to be able to spit up just when you think you’re clear.”
"That would take too much time," Draco says, very reasonably. He knows what he’s getting himself into; Cheng Wu’s shown him some of the old news clippings on the Sun Yee On, and they weren’t pretty, but he isn’t afraid. He’s seen Voldemort’s inhuman face up close and in person, and once spent an entire summer living in terror while Manor was overrun with Deatheaters and werewolves. Very little scares him now.
A distant part of his mind wonders how Potter’s faring. Potter, with that beautiful tanned skin and lean muscled body of his, hadn’t had the time to shield himself. The smoke that enveloped the spot where Potter stood is tinged with hints of red; bright streaks of red flashing in and out as the smoke pushes up against the shield. Which is exactly what Draco wants to do to Potter right now—push him up against something solid, and firm, and then… and then...
“Not if I see you first!” Is what Harry wants to reply, but he can’t quite get the words out around his mouthful of apple. He chews frantically, but of course Malfoy’s vanished by the time he’s finally ready to retort.
“Oh my god, Malfoy, are you brewing drugs?” Is the first thing that slips out of his mouth, unbidden, and Harry claps a hand over his mouth even as he cackles away. It’s a disturbing sound that he didn’t realise that he could make.
Draco spends all of dinner admiring the dragon as it paces up and down the dining table and accepting the envious compliments that come his way when the other Slytherins find out that the dragon only responds to him.
“Yes and no. It’s not supposed to be this intense.” Malfoy clicks his tongue against his teeth as he scribbles something. “This is Version Six, and the potion’s effects are still too strong. I’ve got to figure out the right balance with the Shrivelfig, it’s throwing something off in the mix. Well, since you’ve already been dosed, want to do something naughty?”
had a Ministry inspection last week, which, I’ll have you know, we passed with flying colours despite Rogers’ solid attempts to find a way to fail us.”
Malfoy’s thrown off for a second, his face blank with surprise. But he recovers swiftly enough, and winks easily back at Harry as he says, “Absolutely. Did you notice you’re sitting up a lot taller? And your shoulders are thrown back instead of hunched over. How does it taste?”
“It’s the damn peppermint. It’s throwing everything off,” Malfoy moans in despair. Harry swallows and shifts in his seat at the sound. Heedless of the ink on his hands, Malfoy scrubs a hand furiously through his hair as he pores over his notes, while Harry takes a healthy gulp of the potion cleanser.
Morning comes too soon, and he wakes up slowly, consciousness coming to him in increments until he’s finally blinking sleep out of his eyes. Sunlight streams in through the window, and he holds up a hand against the warm square of sunshine that hits his face. The events of last night feel unreal in the morning, just a figment of his delirium, so he’s surprised when he gets in to work early and finds Potter drinking a cup of coffee at his desk and sitting in his chair, still in the same clothes as last night and looking worn. Potter’s got dark circles under his eyes, and his clothing is rumpled; his hair even messier than it usually is.
"Fossey, sir. Diana Fossey, Director of the Trafficking of Magical Creatures Division. We’re a small division under the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. And these are my colleagues." She introduces them one by one, and the faintly puzzled look leaves Shacklebolt’s face when they get to Potter.
Draco ignores Potter as best as he can, pushes away the feel of Potter’s hand on him, Potter’s grip gone tight. Draco’s own grip on his wand is sweaty, and his pulse is rabbiting under his breastbone. There’s the sound of shuffling outside, muffled whispers, and then a distinct set of footsteps breaks away and grows louder as it approaches their location.
“Right,” Harry says, a bit uselessly. Disappointment rises in him now that he’s done what Malfoy’s asked him to and he no longer has a reason to be here. He puts the towel back on the rack as Malfoy stands, running a hand through his hair, and fully expects to be dismissed.
The multitude of Syltherin faces looking at Draco and his dragon suddenly turn suspicious, and then as one, the Slytherins turn to look over at the Gryffindor table.
Once he’s clear of the Ministry wards, Draco Apparates home, and almost immediately crashes into bed and into sleep. He sleeps for ten hours straight, the deep, dreamless sleep of the exhausted and overworked.
. No one expects anything to get past Ministry security, not with the Aurors there, but it happens anyway. And at the worst possible moment too: they’re in the middle of yet another fight about whether Draco should continue being an Auror, and they’re unhappy and aren’t speaking to each other, and this is obviously the
Draco hurries outside to where Potter’s already waiting with the coordinates, his Auror bag slung casually over one shoulder.
“Oh I see.” Pansy shudders, her mouth twisting into a grimace. “In love with a Gryffindor. What a disgrace.”
“And what exactly does come to mind?” Draco demands, then stops, a sly grin winding its way across his face. “Hang on, Potter, is this a confession? Have you been thinking about me? Wondering what I’ve been up to in my spare time?”
"These dragon parts are worth millions; we can’t just let them walk out with it. What if the Sun Yee On spot the spells and dismantle them? It’s too risky," she says, shaking her head when they come to her with their idea. But they have no other leads, and when weeks go by with no progress, she grudgingly gives in. Draco doesn’t tell her that they implemented Cheng Wu’s plan the day she turned them away–now that they have official approval, there’s no need to ruffle her feathers unnecessarily.
It doesn’t matter; Harry’s read and re-read the article so many times that he can quote it back almost verbatim. He grins at Malfoy, who narrows his eyes at him.
He pauses before taking the first sip, looks Malfoy dead in the eye and says very seriously, “Just remember, if I die, there are people who love me who know where I am and who will stop at nothing to hunt you down.”
In the end, guilt and a lack of imagination sees him turn up at the shop the next Saturday. He gloomily prepares himself for another tortuous morning, and opens the door to the smell of Christmas morning, six test beakers already waiting for him on the desk, and Malfoy beaming madly as he looks up from his notebook. There are dark circles under his eyes and ink all over both hands, but he’s practically radiating with excitement.
needs some coffee if he’s going to power through the rest of the files Fossey left for him on his table.
Malfoy snorts again. He’s a warm presence by Harry’s side, and he’s standing a little too close as he dips a ladle in the cauldron, but Harry doesn’t move away.
"Can we talk?" Potter says, flicking an uncomfortable glance at the officials manning the Port points, who are staring hard at some papers on their desks and who are very obviously trying to pretend that they’re not eavesdropping. The officials look around with expressions of innocence that clearly fools no one, and Draco nods.
“Not to be accused of being a prude, but unless you intend on scandalising half the Ministry, you might want to get changed first,” Malfoy says, mirth in his voice as he gets up and turns away. “I’ll give you some space so I don’t impinge on your virtue, shall I?”
Remus tosses and turns for a while, trying to find a comfortable position. The mattress is old and creaky, and the springs squeak every time he turns. After a few minutes of this, Sirius sleepily throws an arm around him, anchoring Remus to him, and mumbles, “go to sleep, Moony.”
Potter chuckles and opens his hand, lets the Horntail saunter onto his palm, and holds it up so he can glare at it. “You’ve been a very bad dragon. This is the third time you’ve made me hunt all over the castle for you. What if Mrs. Norris had found you first? I know you’ve got teeth and wings, but Mrs. Norris’s fast, and she would have made a meal out of you.”
Malfoy enters the bath with a splash. After he’s sure that Malfoy’s fully submerged, Harry allows himself to glance over. Malfoy’s body where he leans against the side of the tub is covered by a thick layer of foam and bubbles.
“I’ve got to go,” he says, more to himself than to the Portraits. They’re all too busy yelling at each other to pay any attention as he leaves.
Harry’s face scrunches into a frown. “From last week? Who almost cursed our noses off when we tried to confiscate that cursed jewelry box in his attic? Of course I do, it took ages for us to talk him down. Why?”
“Let me see,” Harry says, stepping forward. He pulls his wand out of his wand holster, and a quick spell slices through the shoulder of the shirt. Malfoy pulls it off, crumples it into a ball and tosses it to the side, then finishes stripping down.
He puts the apple down on the table, right next to Harry’s hand, and turns to walk away. Except that Harry says, “Wait, you work here?”
Draco gets the ping in the middle of the night. A faint, insistent buzz permeates his dreams, and when he finally opens his eyes, his room is filled with a soft, golden light, and his wand is vibrating. Instantly, he knows that the wards have been breached and the exhibits are gone.
"I’m with the Aurors. I… was actually sent undercover for the last three weeks–it was a very last-minute assignment, so that’s why you haven’t seen me around." Potter rubs the back of his neck, as if trying to work out a knot, and although he’s replying to Cheng Wu’s question, his entire body is turned to face Draco, an earnest expression on his face. "I’ve only just got back really, and I was walking by when I saw you two."
“Fuck!” Harry yells again, and Neville hurries over to them, his eyes darting all over the room. He takes over from Harry, and Harry guards their back as they make for the door again. The crowd surges all around them, a rolling wave of people and panic and pressure, and Harry has to shove away more than one terrified person who tries to clutch at him.
Their wands clatter to the floor as their bodies come together in a rush of limbs. Hands tangle their way into hair, and then Potter twists them around, and shoves Draco right up against the row of cabinets with a dull clang that echoes throughout the warehouse. Potter’s got Draco’s wrists in a vice grip and pressed up against the cool metal of the cabinets as he leans in, his breath hot against Draco’s cheek. A thread of anticipation begins to thrum under Draco’s skin, intense and uncontrollable, like wildfire, like a collapsing star.
“Of course,” Draco says, kissing his cheek. “Give me the first clue. And I’m sorry,” he adds a moment later, “I didn’t think when I said-”
“Yes, you should have,” Draco tells Potter reprovingly, but he’s watching the Horntail flap its wings and lift off from his hand. The dragon makes a quick infinity loop around their heads, soaring on its powerful, tiny wings, and then lands on Draco’s right shoulder, its little claws digging into the fabric of his robes for purchase.
“Oh,” Harry says, letting his head fall back against the wall with a thump, and doesn’t know why that fact makes him even more miserable than he already feels.
“Hmm, intriguing,” Malfoy says, and his long fingers reach out to gracefully pluck a quill out from thin air.
Harry has a good snort at the title, and then another snort at the photo that they’ve picked of Malfoy. Malfoy had firmly refused to be interviewed for the Tattler, which had put them out of sorts, so the photo that they’ve chosen for the article is an old one. A really,
late,” he sniffs, eyeing Harry’s outfit as they set off, before muttering, “not that you’d know anything about it.”
“Look, Potter, I think it’s best we call it a day. I know, I know—” he raises a hand to stop Harry before Harry can interrupt, “you’re sorry, and it’s not your fault that that happened, but I really need to be alone right now.” A flick of his wrist, and the wards dissolve in a golden shimmer of light.
Draco went, and had, within the first five minutes, tripped over one of Teddy’s toys and broken it. Teddy had screamed and cried and thrown up on him in retaliation, and he had left feeling absolutely sure that he wouldn’t be invited again, except that Aunt Andromeda wrote asking if he would like to have tea the next week at the same time, and had added in a postscript that Narcissa was invited too, if she would like to visit. It had taken Draco a week’s worth of persuasion, but Mother somehow found the time in her alarmingly empty social calendar to attend. Mother was icily formal and stiff during the entire visit, until Teddy sat quietly in her lap and looked up at her with those big eyes of his, his hair flicking through colours as she gently stroked his head. She had thawed rapidly after that, and Draco had left feeling lighter and happier than he had in years.
the place.” At Harry’s astonished look, Draco scowls and says, “oh, what? Just cause I’m a former Deatheater, I can’t open up quaint, hipster coffee joints?”
Potter sniggers. A retort is right on the tip of Draco’s tongue, but the absurdity of the situation and one look at Potter laughing away makes Draco break into helpless giggles too, holding onto Potter’s arm as the both of them look at each other and laugh even harder.
"Oh Merlin," Potter says, and a wave of nausea rolls over Draco at Potter’s tone. At the dismay lying underneath the words, like a landmine, at what they’ve
So Harry enjoys Malfoy on Saturdays. Malfoy on Saturdays is relaxed and happy, usually dressed in a simple cotton shirt and loose pants, and often has the Wireless on while he works. Malfoy on Saturdays sometimes hums under his breath while he mixes and measures. Malfoy on Saturdays is funny and chatty, who feeds Harry with all the new blends that he’s been experimenting with over the week and laughs at all the different versions of Harry that the concoctions bring out in him.
There’s another pause, and Potter hovers there by their table uncertainly until Cheng Wu finally says, politely, "Would you like to join us? We’re just talking about the case, but that can wait until later."
“I remember!” Blaise says. “Didn’t Lucius used to call you a little terror? Every time I came over for dinner that summer he was always complaining about you flying up to the edge of the boundaries, and going on about the risks of exposing yourself to the Muggles.”
That triggers a memory of something Malfoy said, and Harry asks curiously, “What did you mean when you called the Manor a traitor earlier?”
Not that he hasn’t checked, mind you. Over the years, rumours had abounded of Malfoy swanning about in Monaco and spending vast amounts of the family fortune in one of the many casinos that had sprung up over the last decade like weeds. The casino had a vague connection to the family, or so went the rumour, and there were dark whispers of money-laundering. It was persistent enough that Harry had taken a proper look at it on his own time, and found nothing despite two months of quiet investigation and research. The rumours had died a natural death, and then rose up again several months later. This time, that Malfoy was in Asia, meddling in politics and signing deals with the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka. It had even made it to the front page of the gossip rags, but Head Auor Robards wasn’t interested enough to even bother entertaining the possibility.
Draco chases him all the way down the corridor and right into the Port rooms, yelling, "You insufferable git, stop right there! Cheng Wu! Get
"Oh, we’ve already disabled those," Cheng Wu says easily. At Draco’s surprised look, Cheng Wu adds, "We brought along a specialised cursebreaker. I told you, this isn’t our first time dealing with the triads. That’s why there’s
“It’s nice. It’s got a complex, rich tone. It tastes… lush, which is not a word I thought I would ever be using, but it does. There’s a smoky, chocolate aftertaste. A bit ashy. I think I taste a hint of berries.” Harry surprises even himself, but he tastes each and every component of the coffee as he says it.
your dragon to be mistaken for one of the Weasley’s?” He scans the rows of collars, and points out one in gold just for the sheer irony.
"Robards said no," Potter says by way of a greeting when he spots Draco coming in through the doors. "He said, and I quote, ‘that we’ve got enough of our own problems to worry about, they should just be grateful we stepped in last night.’"
Malfoy turns back, one eyebrow raised in indignation. Now that Harry’s had the chance to look at Malfoy properly, he realises that Malfoy’s dressed in a plain white button down, the sleeves rolled up to his elbows, and a light grey pair of slacks. It’s a simple, practical outfit, and annoyingly, Malfoy wears it well. He looks fresh and bright despite the early hour, his fair hair looking artfully tousled instead of disheveled. And of course, Malfoy being Malfoy, the top two buttons on his shirt are undone.
Remus just sighs again, eyeing the bed. It’s past midnight, they’ve been travelling for over six hours, and he’s too exhausted to argue the point. At least the bed is a double, so they’ll just about fit.
“Stay back,” Harry says, loud and commanding, and concentrates on St. Mungo’s. There’s the sharp crack as he tries to apparate with Draco, and they flicker out before reforming again.
Malfoy finishes writing and looks up. “Well?” A smile. Not quite warm, but friendly enough, and one that Harry never would have thought would be directed at him.
So it’s completely unexpected when Harry finds himself catching the crook of Draco’s elbow and pulling him to a stop.
Harry growls, but a little part of him is pleased that he’s the cause of Malfoy’s mirth. The third one goes down better, but still makes his hair stand up on end. The fourth and fifth versions eliminate the hair-raising and the steam, but turn Harry’s face an incredible shade of red. The sixth one sends Harry choking and grabbing desperately at the glass of water that Malfoy always has on standby.
Draco watches him go, but doesn’t follow him. He just sits at his desk and flips through a file without really seeing anything, trying to think through the events of the past month. Trying to figure out how they went from barely speaking to him giving Potter a handjob in a cupboard within a month, and then back again to barely speaking.
“Because it wanted me to see…” Harry frowns. Malfoy remains silent. Then it clicks. “It wanted me to see you?” Malfoy resolutely does not look at him, which is how Harry knows he’s hit the nail on the head. “It wanted me to see you. All of you. The
“I really am sorry,” Harry says in a low voice to Malfoy’s back. “None of those nasty things I said to you are true.”
"Cutting it a bit close, aren’t we, Malfoy?" Potter says, getting up immediately. "Come on, we’ll just have enough time to grab a quickie."
“Luna,” Harry yells, completely throwing Draco’s desire for discretion to the wind. There’s no point in being discreet if Draco’s going to be dead. “Neville! Get over here!” He presses two fingers to Draco’s neck, checks for a pulse. It’s there. It’s weak, but it’s there. Harry let out a breath that he didn’t know he had been holding in.
“Graham,” he says, and is promptly horrified when he finds himself continuing on and laughing, “...Grimmy. Grimster. I think there’s something wrong with my coffee.”
“It depends on what day of the week it is,” Malfoy says, once they’re back in the lab. “On Mondays they fight over prime wall space. On Tuesdays, it’s about whose painter was the best. On Wednesdays, they argue over who can make the most customers cry. Sometimes they call a truce on Thursdays and Fridays because they’re having too much fun taunting the customers.”
Malfoy gives him a small smile of relief. “Good, because I’m just about to ask you for a favour. I was wondering if I could depend on you for some assistance. It turns out that I’m—ah, having quite a bit of difficulty moving my left arm.”
“No, I’ll try a Laughing Latte this time,” Harry says. His conversation with Susan is still at the back of his mind, and he’s oddly conscious of the wall of Portraits watching (and judging) him.
And Harry’s sure that he wasn’t, not really, but now that Malfoy’s said it…. “Come here and let me dry your hair,” Harry says, laughing as Malfoy backs away, eyes wide.
It makes one large circle around Draco’s palm, sniffing suspiciously at Draco’s fingers as they curl protectively over the dragon. The Horntail doesn’t like that, and demonstrates its displeasure by suddenly darting forward and taking a chunk out of Draco’s little finger.
“You think you have a bathtub in one of the bathrooms,” Malfoy repeats, deadpan. “Potter. That’s… there’s so much to unpack right there. First of all, haven’t you been living there for, oh, I don’t know, the last three years? Why haven’t you gotten the house on your side yet? Secondly, yes, there is a bathtub in one of the bathrooms. In two, actually, if I remember correctly. But now I’m wondering what the house has been offering you if you’re not even sure. Third, I seriously doubt the cleanliness of your bathroom if you aren’t even sure of what’s actually
“What a coincidence, so was I,” Potter says, grinning, and Draco can’t help smiling back. As one, they move towards the kitchen, and enter it to find Ginny and Pansy busy putting the last touch of dinner together.
That’s how Potter stumbles over him an hour later: sprawled face down on the staircase, his head turned sideways and resting on the step next to the dragon, watching it sleep. Draco has timed his breathing to sync with the dragon’s, and a hot mist fills the air every time they exhale in tandem.
“Where is it,” Draco says, tapping his foot against the floor. His arms are crossed, and his mouth is twisted into a small frown - not exactly the very picture of excitement that Harry had hoped for when he told Draco that his present was hidden somewhere around the flat.
“Hush, Admiral!” Queen V scolds, while the other Portraits burst into a sudden cacophony of noise. Harry looks around to see if anyone overheard, but Malfoy’s nowhere in sight. It’s Aiden behind the counter today, but he had cringed away as soon as he saw Harry, and Harry’s pretty sure that he hadn’t heard. The smokey smell of coffee roasting is overwhelming out here in the front of the shop, and Harry shudders.
, even though the words are right there on the tip of his tongue, and he doesn’t ask where the hell Potter’s been the last couple of weeks and what gives Potter the right to look at him like that, because
It doesn’t take long for them to settle into a routine. Harry pops everyday in for his morning coffee, but that’s more out of habit than because he suspects Malfoy is
“Here?” Harry says once more, looking doubtfully around the empty locker room again. At any moment, anyone could walk in and see Malfoy in all of his naked glory, and Harry could not conceive of any universe in which this was an acceptable proposal in any way, shape, or form.
He’s going to have to fight, Draco thinks, because Potter’s going to be useless; Potter’s not in the right frame of mind to think about his own safety. A distant part of Draco’s mind is already formulating plans, reminding himself to tuck and roll out of the way before casting, and running through the long list of defensive and offensive spells that he knows.
“Something you want to confess to, Malfoy?” Harry says lightly. Malfoy’s dressed in a green jumper that brings out his eyes, a shade of grey so striking that Harry can’t quite look away once he’s caught Malfoy’s gaze. Something about the sight of him makes Harry’s heart pound that little bit faster.
"You might want to head on home," Potter says, glancing over his shoulder at the rest of the team, who have begun to levitate the frozen human statues towards the door. "It’s going to take us a while to sort through the place before we can let you back into the office. Magical traces, you know. It’s a pain sorting everything out." He sounds a little apologetic, and Draco scrubs a weary hand through his hair.
Harry blinks, and realises that all of his senses have been heightened. He looks at Malfoy scribbling away in a notebook with that ridiculous peacock quill of his—really looks at him for the first time in years. The harsh overhead light in the windowless room should have washed anyone with Malfoy’s complexion out, but Malfoy looks annoyingly normal, albeit slightly pale. Time has softened those features that Harry would have once called pointy, and now that Malfoy’s distracted, his mouth is one soft, generous curve. Harry finds himself watching that mouth, waiting to see if it would curl up into a sneer or a smile.
Malfoy’s mouth twists in a grimace, but he doesn’t answer, and he doesn’t look at Harry. He stares intently at the floor like it holds the secret to the universe. Hurt, Harry turns around and stalks back to his locker. He shucks the rest of his clothes in record time, grabs his towel and heads straight for the shower, never once glancing over at Malfoy.
“Malfoy, I really don’t care about the state of your room,” Harry interrupts, holding up a hand before Malfoy can embark on another one of his tangents. “I just care about whether there’s a working bathtub in your bathroom.”
“Stop playing with it,” Remus says. He strides over and swings the door open and says sternly to the Luggage, “get in here.” There’s a growl in his voice, and the Luggage picks itself up and meekly trots in and settles itself into a corner.
They hadn’t shaken hands. Potter had looked at him then, really looked at him, Potter’s green eyes bright behind those gold wire-rimmed glasses that he still wore, and had simply nodded instead, wearing an expression on his face that Draco couldn’t interpret. They didn’t speak any further, and then the Malfoys’ team of barristers had swooped in and whisked him and his mother away.
was the one who asked Robards for extra manpower for this Division, and he sent me on a last minute mission just to get rid of me. When I asked him a second time, he put me on probation,
. (Evil deeds, no doubt.) And he had found nothing, and life had continued on, and Malfoy had remained a whispered legend on the gossip pages.
They make for the door as one, but Draco sees it just before they get there, and grabs Potter’s arm just in time to stop him. He yanks Potter back with enough force that Potter turns and stumbles right into him. Draco automatically catches Potter, his free hand gripping Potter’s shoulder and holding him steady.
Harry laughs, and pulls Draco in. “Don’t,” he says, rubbing Draco’s back comfortingly. “It doesn’t matter anymore. Just, indulge me, okay?”
After a moment, the door swings open, and they hurry inside as Potter reaches for the light switch. The shed has an Extension Charm on it, and there are rows and rows of shelves packed with such an array of miscellaneous items that Draco has no idea which package Ginny’s referring to. Evidently, Potter does, because he immediately goes “Aha!”
"With your Hong Kong counterparts in three days, yes I know," Potter says, taking a sip of his coffee. The coffee is good, rich and strong, and Potter drains his alarmingly quickly.
Grimster finally puts his book away as he says, “Potter said your coffee tasted funny. Said it tasted
And maybe it’s because he’s grateful for the way Potter skips over that mistake instead of harping on it, or maybe it’s because of the way Potter’s grinning at him, but the words “Night, Harry,” roll off Draco’s tongue as easily as if they’ve been on a first name basis all these years.
Adding fuel to his mistrust is that the shop mostly seems to be run by a bunch of younger Slytherins that were below his year in Hogwarts and whom he doesn’t recognise, although they all certainly know who he is. Logically, he knows that not all Slytherins are
“Hot chocolate’s on the side table,” Ginny says without looking up as she pulls open the oven. Pansy doesn’t even bother to greet them as she flits around the kitchen, twirling her wand. An army of plates and cutlery fly out of various drawers and float behind her in a neat line as she heads out to the dining room.
Harry snorts, draining his cup. “Apparently so. Every year, for the last several years.” He eyes Draco balefully for a moment, then reaches for the Firewhisky again and adds, “and I’m pretty sure I know who the culprit is.”
That stops Draco right in his tracks. “You what,” he says slowly. There’s no way he could have heard Harry right.
They head down the street to Draco’s favourite bakery. It’s a tiny place: the main shop is crammed with rows of baked goods on display, and a small dining room is tucked away in a corner that has enough seating for five. Potter shoots Draco a look that Draco pretends not to see when the owner greets him warmly by name.
Malfoy waves his hand dismissively. “I’m done being a little drama queen. Which I’m sorry you had to go through, by the way. I can promise you that that won’t happen again.”
“I’ll have whatever you’re having,” Harry says, and Malfoy fixes them three fingers of Breakfast Firewhisky on the rocks. Harry doesn’t actually like Firewhisky, but he accepts the glass all the same. The ball of ice tinkles against the side of his glass as he swirls it, watching a tiny whirlpool form in the amber liquid.
“And what exactly does come to mind when you think of me?” Malfoy demands, then stops, a sly grin winding its way across his face. “Hang on, Potter, is this a confession? Have you been thinking about me? Wondering what I’ve been up to in my spare time?”
After that, Harry makes it a point to stop by Espresso Patronum every day. At first it’s to keep tabs on Malfoy, but it seems like Malfoy’s hardly ever there. The few times that he does see Malfoy is when Malfoy either goes in or comes out of a mysterious door leading to the back room of the shop, looking frenzied and clutching a notebook in one hand as he mutters to himself and scribbles notes. No one else seems to find that odd, which raises Harry’s suspicions.
Harry glances into the cup, then looks up at Draco, his mouth twisted into a small smile. “Are you asking me to trust the word of a Slytherin?” He takes a swig nonetheless, deliberately holding Draco’s gaze over the rim of the cup the whole time, and suddenly the room feels hot and crowded.
It’s a pleasant morning, so they take their freshly baked croissants and steaming cups of coffee outdoors, to where the bakery has a single table and pair of chairs set up on the pavement. The buns are soft, warm and honey-sweet, and out of the corner of his eye, Draco watches Potter’s face morph into one of pure bliss after he takes his first bite. As he eats, Potter gives Draco a quick update: they suspect that the gang that infiltrated the Ministry had inside help, and they were definitely after some rare exhibits that the Division had in their evidence room.
The idea of the tiny dragon getting chopped up into parts horrifies Draco, and he inadvertently locks eyes with Potter as they exchange a grimace, the both of them pulling a face. There’s a moment of stillness while they both process the fact that they just had an unexpected moment of camaraderie. Then Draco makes another face, sticking out his tongue at the same time that Potter does, and they lock eyes again.
. And then you turned down my offer of friendship, so naturally I had to declare you my lifelong nemesis. Although, look at how well that worked out.”
“Not at all! Potter, what do you take me for?” Malfoy presses a hand to his chest in a display of shock that somehow Harry doesn’t buy. Malfoy continues, lifting a finger every time he makes a point. “One, we have a valid license. Two, we’re in solid compliance with every single Ministry regulation to date. Our books are audited every quarter by an independent third party appointed by the Ministry. And three, we
They’re both silent for a long moment, then Potter says, voice low, "Well, looks like you were right. It is a trap."
The coffee, when Harry takes a cautious first sip, is delicious. The potion’s effects are subtle, so subtle that he doesn’t realise that it’s worked on him until he catches Malfoy watching him, a pleased smile on his face.
. He glares back equally fiercely, trying to cover his disappointment with anger. “You’re mental! Why does it always have to be so
Fossey takes over then, explaining what they’ve been up to this last month: the joint task force they’ve set up with Hong Kong; the triads; the raid of the warehouse. Finally, Fossey gets to the heart of the issue: a press conference at two o’ clock this afternoon, to announce the success of the international task force.
Except that he comes in the next morning, and Potter’s there, yet again, spinning around in Draco’s swivel chair as Draco comes through the door.
“For fuck’s sake, Potter. It’s a general antidote for expired potions. Look, I’ll go first, you paranoid freak.” Malfoy takes a large swig of the flask, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand once he’s done, and shoves the flask at Harry once again.
“It’s fine if you do, Harry,” Draco says reassuringly, “plenty of people do. Just remember to use a safe word. Something you won’t actually blurt out during sex, you know? Like ‘caramelised onions’! That sort of thing.”
He tries to put his thoughts into coherent words that actually make sense. “Why don’t we go back to Grimmauld Place? I think I have a bathtub in one of the bathrooms.”
Draco gives him a stern look. “Well, then you’re a very irresponsible pet owner. What are you doing, letting it roam all around the castle like that? What if someone else had found it, and decided to keep it? Or even worse, decided to turn it into a potion ingredient?”
Draco ends up getting a faceful of carpet, and only realises the toll that the last few sleepless nights have taken on him when he reaches for his wand, fumbling between his robes, and it feels like he’s moving underwater, every movement slow and sticky. The air is filled with the sharp smell of seared lighting and singed ozone as spells fly overhead, hot and intense. By the time he gets his wand out and gets warily to his knees, it’s all over. Potter and a team of other Aurors are standing in a rough circle around three masked figures, who are frozen–literally–into various fighting positions, and the entire office is trashed.
Harry takes it and takes an unwillingly sip. It clears his mind instantly, the overly cheery mood that had loosened his inhibitions vanishing as if it was never there. He drinks until he’s sure he’s back to himself. “Malfoy, what the hell was that?”
Draco drinks his Firewhiskey until he’s sure his face is flushed from the alcohol (and not embarrassment), while Blaise sips his drink and watches, amused.
"I don’t think he actually thought that I would take him up on it," Potter says cheerfully, shrugging on his cloak and ushering Draco out the door. "Pretty sure he thought he was calling my bluff, and that I would fold. Oh well. Anyway, breakfast is on you this time, since you’re going to be getting extra manpower."
Still, he can’t help but laugh at the look on Malfoy’s face. Malfoy stares at him some more, his lips twitching. It’s strange to see Malfoy very obviously trying to bite back a smile, and Harry laughs again, because Malfoy looks incredibly pained as he does so.
"Heavens, yes," Potter says as he grabs the cloak slung casually over the back of Draco’s chair. "I’m starving, and I haven’t eaten in twelve hours."
Harry gently sets Draco on the floor, head tilted back, and gives him two drops as directed. It doesn’t seem to make a visible difference, but Draco begins breathing easier, and something tight begins to loosen in Harry’s chest.
“Noted for future reference, thanks.” Harry rolls his eyes, but he’s also trying hard not to smile, because how he had never realised how absolutely ridiculous Malfoy was? “Next question: what is this lab for? What are you making?”
old one. Somehow, they managed to uncover a photograph taken of Malfoy at an old Ministry function. The Malfoy in the photograph can’t be more than fourteen, with his hair slicked back and his cheeks still rosy and plump with baby fat. He’s still growing into himself, and there’s a large pimple on the end of his pointy little nose which he’s clearly conscious about, since he keeps holding one hand up to shield his face as he ducks away to hide in the frame.
: they’ve been in the cupboard for only fifteen minutes, although it feels like it’s been hours. Draco’s still embarrassingly hard, but Potter doesn’t comment on it, nor does he offer to help. He just slips an arm casually back around Draco’s waist, and Draco doesn’t know what to make of
“Well if it’s legal, then you won’t mind if I bottle every single one of the potions you’re brewing. Just to check, you understand,” Harry says, and reaches into his back pocket to pull out his wallet. He flashes his Auror badge at Malfoy, whose smile doesn’t falter one bit.
to get away with free stuff again?” There’s a heavy emphasis on the word ‘fame’, his mouth curling in a familiar gesture as he eyes Harry disdainfully.
"Or it could be a trap," Draco counters, looking uneasily up and down the empty street. It’s too easy. It shouldn’t be this easy.
"Come on," Cheng Wu says, nodding towards Fossey’s closed door. The rest of the office stares at them curiously as Potter knocks on Fossey’s door, Fossey’s disembodied voice tells them to come in.
Cheng Wu’s team are clearly used to working together, and they separate into pairs and set about tackling different parts of the warehouse. Once they’re sufficiently recovered from their adrenaline-fueled laughing fit, Draco works together with Potter on the half-done potions that litter the table.
And Draco is tempted to pretend that he doesn’t understand what Potter’s trying to say without actually saying anything, tempted to make Potter spell it out, except that he remembers that Potter was the one who shielded him from it, that Potter had sacrificed himself and took the brunt of it. So he just silently presses up against Potter, buries his face against Potter’s chest, works his hands under Potter’s jumper and fits them around Potter’s waist. Now he’s the one anchoring Potter in place, holding him as he fights to hold himself still.
Then Fossey specifically mentions Cheng Wu by name and impatiently waves him to come on stage when he hesitates. The journalists all give a murmur of appreciation when he finally does appear, and another hundred flashes go off, the soft
It’s a large, airy store, and the tinkle of the bell when they push open the door is completely drowned by a wave of screeching, yeowling, and hooting. A harassed looking clerk comes up to them, wearing oven mitts and clutching a large, struggling cat who clearly does not want to be held. He directs them down an aisle when Harry explains about the collar, the dragon standing regally on Draco’s shoulder the whole time. Its wings are extended to the fullest as it eyes the rest of the animals in the store disdainfully, turning its head to glare as they go past, but none of the animals take any notice of it.
“That’s not surprising. Dragons have their own names, you know. You’ll know what to call it when it tells you,” Draco says. They both look at the little dragon, who chooses that moment to wake up.
Aiden had been sure that Harry was trying to steal something from the back room, and Harry had utterly failed to convince him otherwise with his argument of, “But what do you even have for me to steal? Mouldy coffee beans?” Which wasn’t very fair, because, as Malfoy had told him crossly when he came out to break up the fight, there were Statis charms layered over all the coffee beans to stop them going bad, and further, some of the beans were rather exotic and quite expensive.
“Work here? Potter, I own the place.” Malfoy says it airily, like owning the second most popular coffee joint in London is something that everyone does.
“Hey,” Harry says, turning around in irritation, and stops short when he sees Draco smirking back at him, tossing the apple into the air in one hand. “Malfoy-?” He glances around the coffee shop, as if checking to confirm his surroundings, then looks back at Draco again, surprise clearly written all over his face.
He stands there for a few seconds, staring blankly, wondering where the pantry had disappeared to, and could it please come back because his night is only getting started, and he
At that thought, Draco snaps back to reality and flings open the cupboard door again and stares at Potter, still struggling to comprehend the sight in front of him. "No, hang on," he says, "why are you standing in a cupboard? Have you decided to move in and make this your home?"
“Oh for—” Harry scowls at Malfoy, who laughs. He contemplates going off to come back with a ‘relevant form’ (if there even is one), but that would give Malfoy ample time to clear any evidence of illegal potion making away. He needs to get his hands on one of those sample brews
“You’re plastered,” Harry repeats, except that he doesn’t sound quite so sure of himself as he wraps an arm around Draco’s waist to steady him and peers into Draco’s face. Their faces are so close that Draco can smell Harry’s alcohol-tinged breath on his cheek as Harry stares into his eyes and tries to decide whether he’s dying or just being dramatic.
“Right,” Potter says, wiping his hands in a somewhat nervous fashion against his trousers. “This is, erm. For you. And Teddy. And me, in a way. Er. Merry Christmas, Draco.”
Sighing, Harry picks up his coffee—the entire reason he came in the first place—and eyes it ruefully. Everyone says that Espresso Patronum’s coffee is magical, and it’s only now, on his third visit that Harry finally gets it. Susan had taken one look at the dark bags under his eyes and had recommended that Harry try the house speciality, an Espresso Patronum, and now Harry’s glad that he took up her recommendation.
Then Malfoy had told Aiden off for trying to start a fight with a trained Auror, and had ended his lecture with a practical demonstration on how to gain the upper hand over a more powerful opponent.
"I got the alert too, you idiot," Cheng Wu says, releasing him with a shake. "I told you to wait for me, but no, you’ve got to go off and be an absolute idiot, didn’t you?! We could have killed you!"
"No one has stolen coffee from me before and lived to tell the tale, Potter. You’re lucky you’re still breathing. I’ll have you know that in sixth year, I had Blaise locked out of the boys’ rooms once as a punishment when he tried to hide the coffee pot from me," he says sternly, which Potter just laughs at.
“It’s yours?” Draco says, and a flash of jealousy passes swiftly over his face. He turns from Potter to glance back at the dragon, small and beautiful and curled into itself against the cold stone. “Are you sure? I mean, it might not even be yours, this one might have wandered in from the Forest; have you examined the markings carefully? Look, it doesn’t even have a collar!”
"They had the courage," Potter had said loudly, his voice carrying across the room and silencing the audience, "to conceal the truth from the Dark Lord, and that turned the tide of war in our favour. We won based on those lies. And now you want to crucify them for it."
“Oh, you would,” Malfoy insists dreamily, sinking a little deeper into the water. He sounds slightly drunk as he continues, “Robards came to me once, you know. Said that as I was your partner, could I please talk some sense into you, because getting hurt was practically a job requirement, and he couldn’t have you flying off the handle every time I got so much as a scratch.”
. Mercifully, the cupboard this time round is slightly larger so they actually fit in relatively comfortably, although Draco still ends up pressed up against Potter, because the lust potion is starting to take hold again. It unfurls like a flower, heat spreading throughout his body, and he shudders with need, his body almost shaking with it.
to grab one of the beakers lying in front of Cauldron Three. The entire front of Malfoy’s shirt is soaked, and the thin cotton material has gone translucent. The rest of the Amortentia runs down the glass, and Harry, still startled by his thoughts, and now distracted by the outline of Malfoy’s chest through his shirt, fumbles with the suddenly slippery glass.
“Like what you see?” Harry says, and is surprised when his voice comes out a little deeper, a little more husky. He’s equally stunned as Malfoy is when he follows that up by giving Malfoy a wink.
Cheng Wu leaves early to Port back, and Draco finishes the work day feeling strangely lost. He goes home to a large, quiet house and eats a lonely dinner in a huge dining room meant for a family, and, not for the first time, wonders how he has managed to wander down this path where he’s not unhappy, but not quite happy either. He’s in a strange state where he just
Potter hesitates for the briefest moment, his lips inches from Draco’s mouth, his face hooded in shadow from the wandlight backlit against the floor, and then he leans in, closing the gap, his hands tightening almost painfully around Draco’s wrists. Draco feels the burning under his skin quiet down as soon as Potter touches him, as soon as Potter’s lips brushes his. Potter catches Draco’s bottom lip, sucking and mouthing it until Draco’s breathless, and then he licks his way into Draco’s hot, open mouth. Potter slides his tongue against Draco’s, and then licks up, over and over until Draco’s left shuddering up against the cabinet, mouth swollen and wet.
Potter comes in at about ten in a whirlwind of excitement and energy. Someone claps him on the shoulder, and Draco looks up into Cheng Wu’s grinning face and a "missed me?"
It happens at the Ministry party. On hindsight, they shouldn’t have let their guard down, but it was a
“How dare you, I’m brilliant,” Draco says automatically. Then he remembers who he’s talking to, and says, carefully, “well, you’re not too shabby yourself, Potter. Although I think you need to work on your compliments. You’re not very good at giving them. Although I do think I am very good at receiving them.”
“It smells so familiar. Like broomstick polish...and treacle tart,” Harry says thoughtfully. “And something smokey. It’s probably one of those trial coffees that I’ve tasted or smelled before, I just can’t quite put my finger on which one.”
“I’m going to get another drink,” Blaise announces to the general vicinity, rolling his eyes. Neither of them pay any attention to him as he flounces off with a huff.
“Well, getting a shower sometime today would be good, yes,” Malfoy drawls, and it’s not fair that he looks vaguely amused while Harry’s suddenly flustered at the idea of Malfoy and too much skin. “And here is fine. It’s as empty as it’ll ever be.”
“Oh Merlin, who let the Gryffindors in,” Draco says, appalled, when he catches sight of a familiar mop of black hair. Harry turns around just in time to meet Draco’s glare, a cup of Butterbeer in his hand, and gives Draco a fearsome scowl in return. “Sound the alarm, man the doors, we have intruders!”
Draco thinks, and then abruptly drops that thought like a hot potato before it develops any further. He hasn’t seen Potter since the day he gave Potter a coffee in the lifts, and firmly refuses to wonder where Potter has disappeared to.
Draco has to reach for Potter, feel for him in the darkness, and Potter reaches back for him. Potter pulls him in by his hips, his hands immediately going for Draco’s fly and says, "Draco, can I?" His voice sounds like whisky and sex, and something warm and liquid slides down Draco’s spine.
"I’m on probation for yelling at Robards. Apparently, he wasn’t too keen about me going on at him about sharing resources. He said that since I kept banging on about how we’re ‘one Ministry, one team’, he was going to let me have a chance to put my money where my mouth was. I said fine, so he’s put me on probation and transferred me over on a temporary loan for a month, or, as he said, ‘until I worked this out of my system’."
Malfoy plucks the quill neatly out of his hand and signs as well. As soon as he lifts the quill from the paper, their twin signatures shine golden for a brief moment, so bright that Harry has to squint against the glow. He looks at Malfoy expectantly once it fades away.
"I’m not trying to be nasty," he tells Potter quickly. He’s still confused, still holding his empty mug. "I only meant that you can’t move in here: I need my pot of coffee. You need to change this cupboard back to the pantry. Please," he adds politely as an afterthought, because Potter is looking at him like he's deranged, and he doesn't want the first time that they speak to each other after five years to end in a fight. Not now, not like this, over a cupboard of all things, when Draco just wants his coffee and maybe a good night's sleep, and to not feel like he’s delirious.
“Tell me about it,” Draco says, thinking about the last pair of leather shoes he wore to Aunt Andromeda’s. They had never recovered from Teddy’s artful regurgitation of his Shepherd’s pie.
Potter swallows down as much as Draco’s come as he can, but a little bit spills over and runs down his chin. Draco moans again as his over-sensitive cock slips out of Potter’s mouth, and he opens eyes that he didn’t realise were closed to watch as Potter wipes his chin with a finger. Potter holds Draco’s gaze as he slowly brings his finger to his mouth and sucks it down to the last knuckle.
“Potter!” Malfoy says warningly, but he’s laughing too. He allows himself to be cornered and dragged to sit on the edge of the tub, then proceeds to loftily issue instructions on how exactly Harry should go about drying his hair.
“I— But—” Harry stares at Malfoy helplessly. This is wrong. Harry’s the one who should be apologising to Malfoy, not the other way around, but he doesn’t know what to say that would change the set expression on Malfoy’s face.
a cupboard. The pantry's over there." He indicates with a jerk of his head to a door across the room, and belatedly, Draco realises that Potter’s right, and that he's even more sleep deprived than he thought if he got the office layout completely mixed up.
"Hang on, I’ve got to–" Potter says, and then he’s fumbling for his wand, tucked away in his back pocket. And then the moment’s broken and gone as Potter casts a wordless
, which the Malfoys seem to have a particular talent for. Is it really fair to reward them for a skill that comes so naturally to them?" one of the judges had said, very dryly, and the audience in the gallery had broken out into quiet murmurs of assent, their faces indistinguishable in the gloom.
