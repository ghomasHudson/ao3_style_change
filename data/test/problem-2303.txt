Though there was no real threat made, Lucius had no doubt that he would not make it back to prison should he fail at his task. He hesitantly wrapped his arm around Hermione and pulled her uncomfortably close as they prepared to apparate.
“I don’t want to hurt him,” Harry said.  “And that’s why I can’t be your friend.  Not unless you give up on the idea of you and me.”
“We can go right from here,” Harry suggested. Truthfully, Harry wanted to go straight to Draco’s flat. Wand shopping was the last thing on his mind. But Draco was right, he needed his own chosen wand.
“That was bloody brilliant,” he panted.  Lifting his head to look at her, he smiled.  “All of it.  Are you all right?”
“Exhausted, but good. I’ll let you know when you can come back to the room,” Ron said, then disappeared behind the doors again.
“Nonsense,” her voice broke.  “The past is past.  I’m honored.”  A tear or two silently escaped as she thought of her sister, Bellatrix.  Not as most people remembered her, but as she was when they were children.  When Bellatrix began calling her Cissy, they were young and life was simple, and it reminded Narcissa of better times.
“That’s Potter-Malfoy,” Harry repeated impatiently.  He was tired of people refusing to use their hyphenated names.
Malfoy looked different from the last time he had seen him.  His platinum hair was longer, just past his shoulders and tied loosely into a ponytail.  A few stray tendrils blew about in the gentle breeze.  He appeared to be a little taller than Harry.  But from the distance he wasn’t certain.  The man still sported dark and highly fashionable clothing, and he held himself in a manner becoming a wealthy pureblood.
The liquor was warm going down his throat.  It felt good and he drank nearly a quarter of the bottle before he stopped.  He fell onto the sofa, resting his head back.  His intention was to get drunk enough not to care that Harry was probably taking that twat Knox back to his room and let him fuck him.
“Blimey, Harry.  You could have warned me.” Ron shut his eyes and stood helplessly holding the tray, not knowing if he should put the tray down or run out of the room with it.
Ron held his hands up.  “I know, mate.  You were going for the Death Eater.   But if I hadn’t ducked . . . good thing you told me about that, Harry.”
“Do you really think you can keep dating Draco a secret?  People still follow what both of you do.  He’s a Death Eater. I’m sure the Ministry is keeping an eye on him.”
Hermione reached out a hand across the table.  “You may want to leave your scarf on.  Or I could cast another charm.”
Lucius raised both of his hands, Hermione’s wand in one, and closed his eyes.  He felt the power surrounding the Manor with his own.
He ventured into the library to pull books, mainly from the Herbology section.  He glanced back at the librarian.  She looked much the same as she did when he was a student.  However, she was much more agreeable.  Perhaps she always was, and it was he who had changed, he thought.  He shrugged and went about his business.
Harry tugged furiously at his cock while Draco pounded him.  In an embarrassingly speedy manner, both men came, and collapsed in a sweaty heap.
Unfortunately, Knox took all the information Harry shared as a sign that things were strained between the pair.  Harry was merely venting a little since he didn’t want to further burden Draco with his feelings about Lucius.  He figured Draco didn’t talk about his father for a reason.
“You keep telling yourself that, Harry,” Knox mumbled to himself.  He smiled as he watched the Gryffindor Head stroll away.
“Thank you.  That was more effective than a cold shower,” Draco said.  “And you did earlier, by the way.”
“Yes.  That’s right.”  She touched her index finger to her chin.  “Hmmm.  I wonder now if there was something brewing between the two of you back then.”
“Well, let’s see if we can put your friend’s mind at ease.”  	The Healer pulled out his wand and cast a few charms on Harry.  Frowning, he concentrated his wand on Harry’s head.  The he followed the outline of Harry’s body.
Harry wondered if Trelawny misspoke or if she meant to use the word wizard rather than witch.  She often said things that, to Harry, were odd. Before he gave it a second thought, the dishes and food began to disappear, indicating the end of supper.
It amused Harry that Draco didn’t know what cooties were. He chuckled at the sheltered life of a pure blood wizard. “No. Nevermind.”
“Oh, I’m so relieved,” Draco said sarcastically.  “You don’t know how happy that makes me to know that the man living next door to you still wants to fuck your brains out.  And you’re practically bending over for him.”
Ron turned to face him.  “Sorry, no.  You can see him just after.  But the inquiry is a closed session.  We don’t want anything to influence him one way or another.”
“Blaise told me once that he thought we hadn’t really changed our ways.  He said we’d fall back to our old Slytherin habits. I know he said it out of anger, but I still couldn’t help wonder if he was right.”  Draco turned around and caught Harry’s eye at the Gryffindor table.  Harry gave a small wave and a smile.
“Now, she came all this way to see you,” the guard said patronizingly. “And we went to all the trouble of getting you from your cell.  So, you are going to listen to her.”
Harry looked around the pub.  Some of the same wizards were there that had been in the pub when Harry and Draco had supper after the Quidditch match.  “I had no problem coming here with you before.  I don’t know why it’s different.”
Harry laughed.  “I’m getting to it.”  He took his thumb and forefinger, and gently squeezed the head of Draco’s cock.
“I understand, headmistress. But there are other reasons . . .” Knox glanced at Harry. “I’ve begun applying to other schools. I was planning to pen you a letter this week.”
“The future is what we should concentrate on. And I’ve been thinking about this summer, and where I’d like to travel.”
“Oh,”  Harry didn’t know how to respond.  He’d just been asked to accompany Draco for an outing.  He wasn’t expecting to be turned down.
“Thanks a lot, you wanker.” Draco swatted Harry’s shoulder in jest.  “Go on, I’ll catch up in a second.”
Draco removed two small, long stemmed glasses and unstoppered the bottle. He gave it a sniff before pouring.
Nodding emphatically, Harry answered, “Yes.  Of course. Draco, I want to hear about everything, always.  Especially when it’s something good.
“Then why are we here in a section of the library no one goes?  Hiding out.  Why not tell him I still needed help with this project?”
“Yes, I know I said that.  And Ron was willing to wait all the way until then.  But once Molly and I started to plan . . . well, we just got so excited about the whole thing, we decided to push it up.”
Draco visibly tensed.  He looked at Harry, who met his gaze, and gave a one word answer, “Terrified.”
Daphne snickered, glancing behind him to see what he was holding.  He held it further behind his back.
“Harry, I listened to you tell the Weasleys about our trip to Italy.  I went with you, and I was still entertained by the way you told it.  So was everyone else.  You have a way with words, especially when you’re not thinking about it.  And no one can tell your story better than you.”
Harry nodded.  “Yeah, you’re right.  But I want to see what happens tonight first.  This could be one big joke on me, for all I know.”  He sighed.  “That would be awful.”
“You haven’t mentioned Blaise or Pansy in a while.  Weren’t you going to invite them here so I could get to know them?”
Draco’s eyes sprung open and he watched as Harry touched the icy appendages to his warm full lips. Harry’s hot breath not only warmed up his hands, but the sensual manner in which he did it caused Draco’s heart rate to speed up a bit. Unfortunately, that wasn’t helping the situation. He closed his eyes again. He was so tired.
Pansy remained seated on Draco’s bed.  He was annoyed that she wouldn’t leave and tried to ignore her.  He was about to go take a shower when he noticed her shoulders shaking, just slightly.
Harry nodded.  “Perhaps your mother would be more accepting.  What if we went to visit her this weekend instead of getting together with Ron and Hermione?”
Harry couldn’t help join in.  “But really, Ron.  I’d like it if you tried to call him Draco.  And not the way we used to say it,” Harry said, smirking.
Madam Pince opened the book carefully, a hint of a smile on her face as she gently leafed through it.  She closed it again and held it out to him.
“The private bath is through that door,” Harry pointed. “This is the sitting room, obviously.  And that door leads to the bedroom.  He kept a private ingredients cabinet that I believe is still in there.”  He gestured to a door on the other side of the space.
Harry couldn’t disagree. “I hadn’t thought of that.  I was only thinking about people.  The Ministry would be very interested in saving dark objects.  Draco’s father had some things in his possession that were very dangerous.”  Harry noticed Ron gritting his teeth.  “What?”
“It appears so.  I hear Hermione somewhere shouting your name.  I know what it sounds like, but I can’t believe that he would do that to anyone, including you.  He couldn’t kill Dumbledore knowing that his own life was on the line.  There has to be another explanation.”
“And you told me to stay out of it.” Hermione rolled her eyes. She shook her head. “We’d better get back to the Ministry. Come on Ron. You coming Harry?”
“I’ll find Harry and tell him straightaway.  We’ll meet you at St. Mungo’s.  I’m sure someone will cover his duty.”
Stretching and yawning, Harry reached his arm across the bed to find it empty.  He sat up and looked around his room.  Draco wasn’t there.  He picked up his new pocket watch from his night table and opened it.  Ten thirty-seven.  Damn, he missed breakfast.
After crying for an undetermined amount of time, Draco lifted his head and wiped his eyes.  He spotted the binding containing Harry’s stories, grabbed it and tossed it across the room.  Parchment flew about in all directions.  He got out of bed, kicking a few papers out of his way.
“Are you sure you’re ready for this?” Harry asked.  “You don’t want to take some time to sort out your feelings first?”
Draco obeyed gladly.  They lurched and reeled together, picking up speed until Harry let loose.  Pearly white cum pooled on the couch in front of him while he whimpered.
Harry laughed, “Yes, but I meant that I’m out.  Officially, now that Ron and Hermione know.  It doesn’t matter to me who else knows.”
“All right. Thanks for bringing me lunch and getting me caught up.” He started to get off the couch.
Padma linked her arm through her sister’s and the pair walked to the Great Hall to join their classmates for the first meal of the day. They parted ways and headed to their houses, where Parvati was showered with compliments and a much needed ego boost.
Letting his arm fall to his side, Draco let out a heavy breath and shook his head.  Once again, he fell for Knox’s goading.
Harry decided he needed to tell him about the dreams.  Either Draco would be upset and try to convince Harry that the dreams don’t mean anything, or Harry would see deceit in his eyes.  He’d be looking for both. And hoping for the best.
“Well, um, I thought because we were getting so, um, friendly that you would be the best person to ask.”
“Oh,” Dean relaxed.  “Yeah, unless you’ve got some nappy headed relatives hiding in your family tree.”
Tracey lay moaning contentedly with a small smile on her lips.  When she opened her eyes, she saw Anthony leaning back on the bed wanking away.  She sat up, frowning.
“On the contrary, you look smashing.  I never cared much for kilts before.  But it’s starting to grow on me.”  He paused.  “Well, something is.  I’m glad I’m wearing these robes.”
Malfoy followed, and seeing that Harry was indeed correct about the room, set about rearranging things as he pleased.  Harry stood awkwardly for a few moments before offering his help.  Malfoy told him that he preferred to do it himself.
.”  Harry tried to reach behind Draco, whose arms were a tad longer, preventing Harry from reaching his target.  Resorting to cheap tactics, Harry tickled Draco’s ribs, sending the Slytherin writhing in a giggling fit.  Harry took the opportunity to snatch the box and move quickly move away.  He began to tear at the wrappings.
“Draco, I do not wish the boy ill, but neither do I believe he the best match for you.  Surely you can see that.”
“No, I’m not.  You don’t know my father.”  Draco tried to calm down.  “But, perhaps you’re right.  Father wouldn’t take a note from students too seriously. At least he doesn’t know Harry’s off Hogwarts grounds today.”
“What an arse.  Fucking Seamus,” Ron shook his head.  “As if.  Even if you were bent . . . Malfoy?  Ew.”  A shiver went through Ron, which he exaggerated.
“I’m almost packed,” Harry said excitedly.  “This is going to be even better than our honeymoon.  Did you confirm our reservations?”
After Harry left, Narcissa chastised her husband. “You should be nicer to him.  He’s your son-in-law now.”
“I couldn’t remember how much hellabore I put in.  I lost track because I was in a hurry.  I finished the potion and brought it back to my room.  I wasn’t feeling well and decided to take a nap.  When Pansy came to check on me, I felt too dizzy to get up and asked Pans to send a message.  Didn’t you get it?”
Trying to disregard his heightened awareness of Harry, he smiled at Sibyll.  “Yes, I was one of your students.  In Harry’s year.”  He glanced Harry’s way, but the brunette was busy pushing food around his plate.
“My, this is becoming quite the exclusive,” Glenda grinned, pleased at the turn of events.  “Will you tell us who the object of your affection is?”
“I’m friendly with a lot of people I wasn’t friendly with before the war,” Harry answered.  His tone was even, but he couldn’t help the blush that crossed his cheeks.
“Thanks,” Draco muttered sarcastically and turned his back to Blaise in order to change his shirt.  He removed his dress trousers and pants, exposing his bum to Blaise.
She led them through the Manor, past the dining room that once hosted dinners and meetings for Voldemort. The furniture had all been replaced and the room painted a soft yellow color.  A vase of colorful flowers was placed in the middle of the table.
The pair checked in with the Welcome Witch, then sat in chairs to wait for a Healer to see Harry.  Hermione took a moment to send an owl to Ron explaining that she’d taken Harry directly to St. Mungo’s.
Blaise let go and stepped back.  He pulled on his gloves in a huff.  Getting on his Nimbus 2001, Blaise pushed off and flew away from Draco.  The blond jumped onto his much newer Firebolt and gave chase.  The pair took turns pursuing one another, weaving through the towers around the pitch.  Occasionally, they would find themselves over the lake or among the turrets of the castle.
“And none was given.  No one was more qualified when the board approved your hiring.  Mr. Malfoy took it upon himself to take extra measures to insure that he would be taken seriously.”
“One of the stipulations of his release last year was a hearing to review his case.  A sort of parole hearing, if you will.  It should be just a formality as my father has adhered to all of the conditions placed on him.  But, the date they’ve chosen is February fourteenth.”
He fell asleep with visions of emerald eyes in his head.  And he didn’t even care that he was once again relegated to the uncomfortable sofa.
“Huh?”  Harry spun around and stared blankly, desperate to come up with any answer but the truth.  “Oh, I was wondering if you would mind helping me with . . . my DADA class,” he lied.  It even sounded insincere to himself. Then a brilliant idea came to him.  “I thought you could come and talk to the students about your experiences with the Dark Arts.  If it wouldn’t be too disturbing for you.”
Ron led Knox away, leaving Harry to wonder what the man had done, or knew about. With no other recourse, he went down the staircase and proceeded to the Great Hall for lunch once more.
Harry leaned up against the wall.  He slid down and sat abruptly on his bum.  Beginning to feel a bit lightheaded, he crawled to the loo and locked the door behind him.  He took a moment to gather himself together before standing and using the toilet.  As he washed his hands he looked at his reflection. Describing himself as pale would have been a vast understatement.  Splashing cold water on his face, Harry steeled himself to face everyone without letting on about Ginny and Dean’s conversation.
“No, Ron.  Do you have any idea how humiliating it is to be turned down by your boyfriend?  On Valentine’s Day, no less.  I’m even wearing fancy knickers.  Not that you’re going to see them any time soon.”
“Professor Malfoy,” he corrected himself.  But the other man still didn’t turn around.  He tried again, without success to get Draco’s attention.
Pulling his jersey over his head, Draco smoothed out his wet hair.  “What things?  What do you mean?”
“It is our wedding weekend,” Harry pointed out.  “By my count, we’ve only done it five times.  That’s not even our shag record for a regular weekend.”
“Don’t be.  It was rather sexy.  And then I was pretty sure you leaned toward boys, at least me.  I’ve just been biding my time, waiting for you to come around.”
“He was a competent student I suppose,” Draco offered.  “However, he cheated when he could have earned good grades.  I would say more out of laziness than lack of intelligence. I had heard that he was studying law. He’s got as good a chance as any to keep your parents out of prison.” Draco threw him a bone.
Draco leaned over, next to Harry. “Well, none of these are particularly speedy.  Even if there are babies waiting to be adopted from this agency, there seems to be quite a lot of paperwork involved, and waiting time.  Finding a surrogate will likely take even longer.  Then, of course, we’ll have to wait the nine months.”
As a child, Draco overheard Knox’s great grandmother talking about how the two of them could pass for brothers.  She had gone so far as referring to Draco as the evil twin.  He knew it was what they all thought of him on that side of the family.  The fact that Lucius had been a suspected Death Eater only fueled the rivalry.
Harry’s thoughts went to his journal.  He would be happy to report that his last entry was unfounded after all.
“I know, Narcissa.  I know him very well.  If you’re doubting my commitment, I can assure you that I am devoting one hundred percent to this relationship.”
“All right.  But you know, you might not want to stay here.  Someone may need the room.”  She winked.
When Draco raised an eyebrow in question, Harry offered an explanation.  “A spell to get myself ready.  Saves time.  And you’re not getting out of it this time.”  He pulled the drawer to his side table and groped for his bottle of lube.
For what seemed like an eternity, The four of them stared at one another and said nothing.  Ron was the first to finally speak.
Snapping out of his shock, Draco looked down at the messy head of hair resting on him and chuckled softly.
“I swear, I won’t tell anybody.  Else. You can even charm me to keep quiet about it.  I just want to know who it is,” Ron made another appeal.
“Well, no.  But he’ll do it for his best friend’s boyfriend,” Harry grinned.  “Please.  It’s worth a look.  If it wasn’t an accident . . .”
The day before Christmas.  Surprisingly enough, when Draco wasn’t around to distract him, Harry had been able to get all of his schoolwork caught up.  He was looking forward to going to see Ron and Hermione the next day.  Along with the rest of the Weasley clan of course.
“An hour is just plain late, not fashionable.  More likely, he’s not going to show up.  I’m gonna go.”
The Professor Bissette and Madame Pomfrey wished them a wonderful holiday, and Harry and Draco left to finish preparing for the trip.
Snickering, Draco said, “Well that’s what you get for falling for another man.  Think of it this way though, all those times our friends don’t want to have a baby, they have to use some sort of birth control.  We can shag anytime we want without worrying.”
Harry winced at Ron’s mention of the dream in which Draco curses Ron.  He never did tell his lover about it.
“Nothing much,” Harry replied. “It’s just a snippet really.  Although, in the last one, they seemed to be in a zoo or something.  I caught a glimpse of a white animal and some sort of flowering shrubbery.”
Laughing uncomfortably, Professor Slughorn joked, “Well, it seems Mr. Malfoy was just a bit overexcited about his win.  Hurry now, if you haven’t finished yet,” he told the rest of the class.
Draco rolled his eyes and reluctantly opened his mouth.  The noodle was just out of reach, and he had to use his tongue to catch it.  He watched Harry as he did.  He noticed that Harry’s mouth was slightly mimicking his own.  Playing it up, Draco attempted to wrap the noodle around his tongue, then sucked it between his lips with a loud slurp.  When the end of the noodle finally whipped around, splashing a bit of sauce on Draco’s face, Harry was staring at him as though he were the meal.
The room was light enough for him to see the clock. It read one-eighteen. He’d been asleep for almost six hours. He felt as though he could sleep another six. He laid his head back down and closed his eyes. The image of Draco closing his eyes and, what Harry thought was dying, played over in his head. It was still heart wrenching, even though Harry knew Draco was alive and, for the most part, well.
Biting his lip, the blond blinked at Harry’s question.  Why would he put Draco on the spot like that?  How was he supposed to answer?  If he said yes, would he scare Harry off?  He wasn’t certain he was ready for that particular confession.
“I understand,” Harry said.  “I sometimes find it amusing when wizards are confused by muggle devices.”
Harry frowned.  “That isn’t how you worded that question on my list.”  He saw Bert slump in his chair and sigh heavily, probably out of frustration.  If the two of them nitpicked every detail, the interview was going to take hours.  Harry decided as long as he was able to explain himself fully, it didn’t matter how she worded the questions.
“Unfortunately not.  But it’s all right.  Most everyone was supportive.  I think a few others came out as well.”
“I’m sorry. I think I dozed off for a moment there,” Draco said, embarrassed by his lack of etiquette.
Hermione glanced around the Hall, noticing that it was more sparsely populated than usual that morning.
“What’s your problem?” Ron wasn’t easily intimidated these days.  Going through the war had matured Ron and gave him confidence he’d never had before.
“Ron, you’re in charge.  You need to be out here in case something goes wrong.  You’ll need to make the call to use brute force to get into the Manor.”  Hermione looked him in the eye.  “I understand the risks.  But I don’t want anyone else making that call for me.”
Hermione stood before the boys, opened her mouth to speak, but didn’t.  She exhaled sharply, then announced that she was going down to breakfast, turned on her heel and left.
“But Harry, the lab is going to think it’s your sample.  What if there’s something wrong with mine?”
They made plans to gather together at the Weasley’s for Christmas, as Harry usually did. The entire clan would be there. Harry was looking forward to seeing Percy’s new daughter, Molly. And he was secretly hoping Dominique would once again affix herself to Draco’s side, and perhaps weaken his resolve.
“I see,” McGonagall said.  She looked back and forth between them.  The expression on her face was largely unreadable to Harry.
“Madam Pince, please accept my apologies,” Draco lowered his head.  “When I dashed out of here on Friday night, I was distraught.  I didn’t mean to . . . I can’t tell you how sorry I am that I took it out on you.”
Narcissa put her hand up.  “I know. But as long as your father believes it is, you’ll be free of his wrath.”
Draco pulled Harry’s chin gently, forcing him to look into Draco’s eyes.  “Well, I haven’t noticed.  I’m too busy looking at you.” He kissed Harry and snuggled closer, nudging his way under Harry’s arm.
“How can you love me? I don’t even like myself,” Draco stood and walked to the window, looking out at the gray day. Harry remained at the edge of the sofa.  “The things I did,” he said softly.
“That’s my girl,” Draco smiled.  Then his smile faded. “Did you tell anyone else about this?  Blaise?”
“That’s hardly fair, Harry,” Draco smirked.  “It took me a while to be sure.  And I spent a lot of time watching you.”  He glanced at Harry’s friends.  “That made me sound like a bit of a stalker, didn’t it?”
“I admit that I considered it.” Draco closed his eyes.  He wasn’t able to look Harry in the eye.  “But Pansy, Blaise and I removed the charms from the cauldrons last week.  I realized that I couldn’t keep you if you didn’t truly love me and decided to dismantle the game.”
Draco certainly didn’t make it easy on him.  The man oozed sex appeal and never discouraged Harry’s attention.  At times, he even sought Harry out--to get in some flying practice or a game of chess.
“I enjoy your company too, Harry,” Knox said.  “More than anyone’s.”  Encouraged, he took a step toward Harry.
Casper nodded and sighed.  “All right professor.  I’ll try not to be so distracted from now on.  I don’t want you to get into trouble because of me.”
The man leaned forward as if to drive his point further.  “Mr. Malfoy, it is imperative that you answer these questions with one hundred percent honesty.”
“At least that’s done,” Ron said.  “And Mum will never have to know that there was any question about that baby’s father.”
“Sorry. Habit,” Harry apologized. “But can I get a look at your side. Just to see if there’s a wound I need to cover.”
“I mean, you’ve probably always had propensity for, um, homosexuality. Maybe your uncle noticed. It could be that his derogatory comments have made you repress your true feelings.  Now that you’re free of him completely, they’re resurfacing.”
“Yes,” Harry whispered.  But desire gave into fear as Draco began to close the distance between their mouths and Harry took a half step back.  “Wait.”
Still gaping, Draco turned and quickly placed the usual charms on the room.  He stood only for a moment before striding over to Harry’s side. His eyes swept over the scene before him.
“Well then, it looks as though we’re both getting what we’ve always wanted,” Ron smiled.  He turned to Hermione.  “And we get to keep what we already had.”
“Please, Harry, we’ve been colleagues for two years now.  Call me Minerva.”  She motioned for him to have a seat.  “I would like to speak to you about the new Potions professor.”
Harry laughed.  That was not a question he expected.  “Yes, it’s true.  Once I discovered I was a wizard they started letting me live in the spare bedroom.”
“Um, actually, I was planning to . . .” Harry sighed. “Fuck it, sounds like you two already suspect anyway. I’m going to Draco’s place, to bring him lunch and make sure he’s keeping up with his potions.” He held up a previously confiscated wand in his hand. “And he’s been home without a wand the past few days.”
“Of course, Susan. You were there.  You saw that I got paired with her.  Did you know she’s actually a lesbian?”
Harry laughed.  “It is a big place.” He turned to Draco.  “I’d show him, but I still don’t have the layout down myself.”
“Shit,” Draco cursed under his breath.  “Are you okay?”  It was then he noticed the long-stemmed blue rose clutched in the western bandit’s hand.  Draco held out his hand to help Harry up.
Hermione giggled at seeing Harry so openly affectionate.  He’d always been so reserved about his feelings in matters of love.  Even with Ginny.
“That’s one of the few female nudes.  It’s a print by a muggle called Klimt,” Draco told him.  “I’m sure you must have seen his most famous work, The Kiss.”
Harry stood silent, deciding whether or not to tell her, even though he knew she’d figured it out already.
Taking his time, Harry found a gentle rhythm, rocking the pair together.  Draco’s hand took hold of his own bollocks and squeezed.  He was becoming aroused again as Harry licked and sucked at his skin.  His other hand softly ran up and down Harry’s back in time with their rocking motion.  Draco pulled on his now fully erect penis adding to all the other sensory pleasures of the moment.  When Harry leaned down for better leverage, the Slytherin’s mouth found his neck and suckled.
“Bollocks.  I don’t know much about binding, but I know that you can’t do it by accident.”  Ron crossed his arms over his chest, thinking Harry was lying to him.
He stretched and rolled his shoulders to release the tension from hunching over the desk.  His stomach rumbled lightly and he wondered if he had been working so late that he missed supper.  Pulling out his gold watch, he saw that the staff supper had begun twenty minutes prior.  He hurried to the Great Hall hoping he could still get a bite to eat.
“The boots,” Draco motioned to them.  “As convenient as it may be for you to be taller, I enjoy looming over you.”
“Harry,” Draco smiled, trying to ease the crease that formed between Harry’s brow. “We’re young. Too young to think about children, in my opinion. Or to be tied down to a business.  Let’s enjoy our lives.  Who knows how we’ll feel in five years? We can’t worry about that now.  We’ve only been married for two months.”
Sensing that Harry was about invite the other man to their private party, Ron interrupted.  “We’d better get that wine before Mione and Draco wonder where we are.”  He deliberately made sure to use his former enemy’s first name.
“It has come to my attention that you snuck out of school on Saturday last against my specific instructions, Mr. Malfoy,” Professor McGonagall tapped her foot under her desk as Draco stood in front of her.  He refused to cower, feeling quite justified in his actions.  “What am I to do with you?” she asked rhetorically.
Standing there awkwardly, Harry couldn’t stop his eyes from wandering over the former Slytherin’s body. Even with the leftover bruising, it was practically perfect.
“It’s been too long, mate,” Ron said.  “Don’t get me wrong, I love my family.  But I need to get away once in a while.” He nudged Harry with his elbow. “Let’s sneak off to the Leaky.”
He tried to suppress a smile.  “Do you think we could start over?  Pretend the wand parties never happened?”
Harry could hardly contain himself.  He and Draco looked over the flat above the apothecary and he found it to be even better than he remembered.  He walked to the window and gazed out over the alley.  It was relatively early so it wasn’t as bustling as would be later in the day.  Harry couldn’t wait to wake up there every morning next to Draco.
“Who’s complaining?  I came when you did.”  Draco kissed him, his heart rate finally slowing down.  “It’ll last longer next time ‘round,” he grinned.
“Too busy for love?  Harry, you’ll never find a nice girl and have a family if you don’t put yourself out there.  Don’t you want a family?”
“There was talk of you taking off to go to counseling. I didn’t want everyone to think you’d gone off the deep end.”
“We won’t be needing a nanny,” Draco told her. “I’ve decided to continue my leave from Hogwarts to care for the twins myself.”
“Don’t misunderstand. I feel sorry for him, but not enough to forget our entire past. I think he’ll be fine.  A fresh start is what he needs.  It worked out pretty well for me,” Draco smirked.
As if it were a race, and perhaps it was, Harry followed suit.  The pair watched one another as they stripped.
Hermione was the first to the potions cupboard to retrieve ingredients.  After her, there was a bottleneck of students clamoring to get the best specimens.  When she returned to her seat, she noticed that Harry hadn’t even gotten up yet.
“Knox, it’s best to cooperate,” Harry said gently.  He knew Ron would not be there on a whim.  Official Ministry business was something to be taken seriously.
“I do love you, Pans.  As my friend. And that’s no small thing.”  He put his arm around her.  Since saying those words to Harry, he felt more comfortable expressing his feelings for Pansy.  “I shouldn’t ever have taken advantage of you.  I didn’t realize how it would make you feel about yourself.”
Harry laughed, then realized he and Draco had just taken a big step in their relationship. Bigger than either of them had ever taken. His stomach fluttered.  He wondered, if he was this nervous about a few personal items, how Ron must have felt proposing marriage to Hermione.
Both Ron and Hermione stopped where they were and regarded one another.  She knew by the guilty look on his face that Lavender took full advantage of her rights according to the game.  Lavender smirked at Hermione and squeezed Ron’s hand more tightly.
“All right, all right.  Everyone take a seat please.” Slughorn got the students’ attention. “Time to announce the big project,” he beamed.
“Oi, what’s going on in here?” Ron asked as he and Harry stepped through the back door into the kitchen.  Molly, Ginny, Hermione and Fleur were all standing in the archway between the kitchen and the sitting room.  “Spying on someone, are we?”
“If Mother hasn’t planned it out already.”  From his vantage point, Draco noticed his ungainly student, Casper, get up from his seat and slowly walk to the Ravenclaw table.
“I have a solution that may satisfy everyone involved,” Harry continued.  “You publicly support Draco’s relationship with me, and I’ll publicly support your release and,” he coughed, “your rehabilitation.”
“Harry, we have a long time to get to know all the little things about each other.  You don’t need to know it all instantly,” Draco said, resting his head on Harry’s shoulder as they lay in bed. “That’s half the fun, isn’t it?  Discovering things bit by bit.  Besides, I’d rather take you to the places I enjoy than tell you about them.  I want to know all about you too.  But, for now, I’m tired.”  He yawned.
Pulling Harry close, Draco said softly, “Once you get under someone’s skin, you’re pretty hard to shake loose. Believe me, I know.  I spent years thinking you hated me, and it didn’t lessen my feelings for you.”
Ron rolled his eyes.  “Mione, it’s not like you didn’t know this was coming.  Aren’t you excited to get on with our lives?”
“Boys!” Slughorn shouted. “Mr. Malfoy, put away your wand immediately!”  The professor put his hands on his hips.  “This is no way to behave in my class.  Ten points from each of you.  Now sit down so we may begin our lesson.”
Snickering, Harry said, “So, it wasn’t just me? I half expected her to start talking about some invisible creatures living in the Black Forrest. I won’t even bother bringing up that first witch.”
“Merlin, I want you so badly,” Harry breathed. He had to remind himself to go slowly. As quickly as their first encounter passed, he wanted this to last as long as possible.
“Well, evidently, she didn’t believe you.  She wanted to see all of his scores and my reports on the tutoring sessions.  It took bloody forever.  And now you’ve gone and practiced with him.”
“At first, I thought they were Ron and Hermione as children.  But then I thought maybe they were Ron and Hermione’s future children.  That’s who they are, right?”
Harry couldn’t help giggling himself.  “I was in the middle of trying to talk to Cho.  Do you remember her?  She was a year ahead of us.  Anyway, I was asking her to go on a date with me when the book in my bag farted.”
Both men groaned with pleasure, the noises echoing loudly throughout the room. Draco was certain if his neighbors were home, that they would have heard.
Harry walked into his room and glanced around.  Though it was mid-week, he was hoping to find Draco there.  He was finding it more and more lonesome during the week when his lover wasn’t with him.  The pair had even taken to staying in one another’s quarter on weekends they had duty.  Not that Harry had been trying to actively go against McGonagall’s rules.  He simply found that he was much less distracted with Draco by his side than he was thinking about the man when he wasn’t.
Obliging, the brunet gripped the back of his own legs and held them open.  He couldn’t help the sound that escaped his lips as he felt something wet and firm, yet not stiff, poking at his entrance. When Draco wiggled his tongue, Harry gasped.
“You too, Harry. We should get together sometime. Good to meet you, uh, I didn’t catch your name.” He held out his hand.
The way Hermione said his name, not with its former spite or animosity, softened Draco’s demeanor.  For a moment, he thought perhaps he could be part of their group, an accepted member.  By Hermione and Harry, anyway.
“Hmmm,” Harry hummed against Draco’s throat.  “I can make that dream come true.  No pun intended.”  He ground his hips, and hard bulge, into Draco’s groin.
“Yes, disgusting.  That’s a sight I hope never to witness again.  Anyway, that’s why we were so out of breath,” Draco said.  “We had to run up to get her then ran here to tell you.”
When he got down to the Great Hall, most of the other staff were already there, and the food had appeared only moments earlier.
Avoiding Draco’s eyes, Harry nodded.  “Morning,” he mumbled and sat down.  Of McGonagall, he asked, “Where is everyone?”
With the evening cut short, Ron had nothing to do but clean up and return to Gryffindor.  He vanished all evidence of their romantic date, save for the single plate of remaining cake.
Hermione’s demeanor softened.  “Yes. I’m very proud of you.  Of course, the one time you concentrate on class work, is the one time I wish you had been observing Harry’s odd behavior.  I think it has something to do with Draco.”
“Of course.  It’s a modified Evanesco.  You don’t think I would let someone with a blade near my knob, do you?”
“I still say you make a fair nurse maid. But that’s not what I want from you. When are we going to stop dancing around the subject of you and me?”
“She’s a young Auror.  Nice girl, but I never thought anything of her.  She flirted a bit,” Ron shrugged.  “I don’t even notice anymore.  It’s funny, back in school I couldn’t get any girl to look at me, ‘cept Lav.  And Hermione.  Not that I knew at the time--”
“You know, I feel like I still owe you for our trip to the Leaky Cauldron.  And now you’ve invited me to Quidditch.  Let me make it up to you Saturday night.  I promise I won’t get so buggered that you have to apparate me back again.”  Harry hoped his invitation sounded casual and unrehearsed, despite that fact that he’d been trying to find a way to get another night out with Draco.
“I’m sorry,” Draco said when they pulled apart.  “I’m just trying to be completely open and honest with you.  You deserve that.”
“It’s all right, Harry,” Draco put a hand on Harry’s.  “Maybe it will make them feel better to know that this isn’t just a passing fancy for me.”  He looked at Hermione.  “I don’t exactly when I began to see Harry differently.  Probably during Sixth year, when I learned first-hand what it meant to be forced to play a role on a war I didn’t start.”
Draco opened up his door and glanced around to see if anyone was in the hallway.  It was late enough that all the students should have been in their dormitories.  But they both knew all too well that students were often where they weren’t supposed to be.
“Your parents were already a couple before they started the game.  And my parent weren’t actually paired up during the game.  They dated after that. No wonder they had a rough marriage,” she chuckled.
“No, they’re all in order. Don’t feel badly about that.  I didn’t blame you one bit for being angry with me.  I’m lucky you didn’t burn them. Anyway, that’s all behind us.”
Harry and Draco walked past him and continued on their way.  Had either one of them turned around, they would have seen Knox watching them go, and the scowl on his face as Harry reclaimed Draco’s hand.
“I knew it.  I just knew it,” she said.  “You have no idea how difficult it’s been to see the two of you seeming to want children, but holding my tongue.”
“No, of course not. That’s not what I’m saying.” Harry stepped forward and took Draco’s hand. “I’m only realizing that there may be more changes than we anticipated. I assumed we would be living here for many years. Possibly our entire lives.”
“Sure,” Harry smiled.  “You’re a great wizard.  As much as I was loathe to admit it, I always knew that.  I think you could do whatever you want.”  He was feeling warm and relaxed, but only slightly buzzed.
“You’re right.  Harry does deserve some fun.  I really shouldn’t be upset.  I agreed to break up.  And, well, Dean and I have sort of been seeing each other again since that last wand party.”
“We’ve talked, a lot.  About a lot of things.  I think we’re pretty much past all that. Did I tell you that even Pansy apologized for trying to hand me over to Voldemort?”
“But I don’t want people to try and guess who it is.”  Draco lowered his voice.  “Or worse, suspect that it’s Harry, now that we’re working together.”
“Yeah, that.” Ron pointed at Draco.  “A dummy might mess that up. But they’re dentists for Christ’s sake. They should be able to fix that sort of thing, right?”
“So, you’re saying . . . that when the game is over, none of us will stay as couples?” Draco was trying to make sure he understood what Pansy was implying.  “But isn’t the game pretty much over already?  There hasn’t been a party in over a month.”
Friday night at half-nine, a parade of Gryffindors went through the common room past Harry, reading at a desk.  He glanced up.
“I didn’t have much of a choice after that other article,” he said.  “I only wanted people to know the truth.  Hopefully, I’ve not done more damage.”
“Oh, Tracey,” he groaned.  “You feel so fucking good.  I promise to make you feel good too.” One more slow movement and he hit home. “God, you’re tight.”
“The baby isn’t due for almost two weeks.  You didn’t need to drop everything to come back.”  He smiled softly.  “So, how was your trip, anyway?”
Harper sat up and faced Draco, wiping his eyes.  “B said that we’d be going in different directions after leaving here, and there was no point trying to carry on.”
“You’re spectacular,” Harry remarked as he eyed Draco up and down.  “I don’t think I’ve ever wanted someone so much in my life.”  He caressed the side of Draco’s face with the back of his hand.
“Fine.  Just get on with it.”  Tracey lay back down on her bed.  She had drawn her curtains and placed a silencing charm around them as Daphne had done.
“Yes, a gift.  From Harry.  I’m sure the Ministry is ready to tell you to go to Hell.  But Harry is stepping up.”  Draco turned to look at Harry.  “That’s how much he cares for me.  He’s willing to help you to keep my mother safe.  I think he cares more about Mother’s safety than you.”
“Darling.” She kissed his cheek and squeezed his hands when he approached, then turned to Harry. “I wasn’t sure if the two of you could tear yourselves away from each other long enough to come here.”
When pudding appeared on the large buffet tables, the Slytherin students abandoned the game, and Draco with it.  He sauntered over to Harry with a lightness in his step Harry had noticed ever since his heart to heart with Lucius.
“We’d just like a little something to eat, Minke.  We missed supper.  Is there anything left over?” Harry asked.
He held out a small bouquet of simple flowers for her, which she accepted. “I’m sorry for my behavior at the wand party.  That first one.  And the second one as well, I guess.  I should have just cleaned your room for you.  It was the least I could have done.”
Hermione and Ron turned in their chairs as Harry and Draco gaped at the woman weaving her way through the tavern toward them.  On her head, she wore a hat the size of a bird cage.  At second look, one could see that it actually was a bird cage.  She was followed by a man carrying a camera.
“I suppose there’s no getting around it.  I’m ready.”  Draco slipped his fringe behind his ears.  “Let’s go.”
Stepping out from behind Harry, Draco cast a Jelly Legs Jinx at Stephen.  The Ravenclaw fell to the floor, dropping his wand.
“What are you waiting for?” she asked.  “Where’s your Gryffindor spirit?  You’re wasting your time with me when you could be with one who truly makes you happy.”
“I know.”  Harry lowered his gaze.  “But it was nice to go through his things with D-Malfoy.  He respected the man, and Snape’s possessions meant something to him.  It also showed me another side to Draco.”  Harry forgot to refer to his formal rival the way they usually did, by his surname.
“Oh, sorry.  I didn’t realize I was blocking the way.”  The girl smiled.  She wore an odd sort of mask that showed her mouth but came down on the sides and covered her cheeks.
“Harry, it’s not even seven in the morning.  We can’t call this early.  Let’s do it before supper tonight.”
By the time they were halfway through their fish dishes, Harry felt as though he knew everything there was to know about  Miss Althea Bridgewater.
“On . . . um, Valentine’s Day.”  Harry bit his lip.  “I know.  It’s our first one since we got married.  But it’s Ron and Hermione’s too.  And they don’t get to go out the way we can.  And nobody else offered . . .”
Draco hadn’t realized how tightly he had been gripping his lover until then.  He immediately released him.
Silently, Draco turned on the water and pulled off his last remaining piece of clothing. Without the pants to reign him in, his erection stood embarrassingly straight out in front of him.
Nervously, Harry stirred his tea, waiting for it to cool enough to sip.  He was anxious for someone to start a conversation, and feared the longer they sat in silence, the more awkward the meeting would go.
Draco nodded. “Blaise always did have a nose for wine.  We would sneak down to our wine cellar and he managed to pick out the best wines for us to get pissed.   Wait, your father offered him a job at the vineyard?”
“Yeah, I guess it’s coming a little sooner than I thought.  But Hermione and I have been together for six years.  We’re ready.”
Though she didn’t say anything, Hermione appeared less than pleased with the entire exchange with the house elf. She let it go, not wanting to spoil the mood.
Harry walked to the wall hanging and gave it a hard tug. It didn’t budge. Pulling with all his might, Harry tried again. The tapestry stuck tight.
“I wanted to.  Really. I was afraid to talk to you all week though, because of my punishment from the game,” he explained.  “It was rather embarrassing,” Michael blushed.  “You have
He’d been too overwhelmed to speak when the mediwitch placed the baby in his arms.  All he could do was stare. He knew Harry was standing nearby, equally anxious, but he couldn’t take his eyes off his precious newborn daughter.
The boys looked at each other.  They looked back at Romilda and nodded eagerly.  She recognized one of them as Jack Sloper, who was in her year.  She decided not to tell Padma that both boys were more than likely two years younger than her.
He decided instead, to go back to his own chambers.  He had to pull himself together.  Clearly, he couldn’t spend all of his free time pining after Draco, who obviously had his own schedule to keep.
“Selfless?  No, selfless would have been finding a way to get into the Manor by myself.  Killing Greyback by myself.  Or getting only myself killed in the process. No, Mione, I took the coward’s way out.  I couldn’t look him in the eye and face that he was losing the battle to stay alive.  I lied to Draco to make myself feel better.”
Harry however, leaned forward and licked the sauce off Draco’s lips, nearly knocking him off balance.  The Potions professor gently pushed him back.
Harry’s eyes scanned the room, not spotting them right away.  “Oh, I thought you said she was way out of league.”
Draco felt a sense of nostalgia as he pushed open the overly large doors and stepped inside.  The walk to the head table at the end seemed insufferably long.  He could feel many pairs of eyes upon him but noticed that Harry was one of the few who didn’t watch him.
She crossed her arms over her chest.  The thought had occurred to her.  If Draco and Harry broke up, she may have a chance with him.  A very small one, but more than she had now.
“Well, one I’ve had a couple of times involved children that looked a lot like you and Ron.  I’m not certain if it’s supposed to be your children or younger versions of the two of you.”
Pansy held their attention as she explained the rules of the party game, after they all swore an oath to keep it secret from the professors and younger students.
Glancing at Harry, Knox answered.  “I’m definitely available.  I would love to stay on until Professor Malfoy returns.”
Once they reached the tallest tower in Hogwarts, Draco insisted they return to their usual appearances.
Ron looked at the hand stretched out in front of him.  The others had all begun walking out, leaving him and Draco alone.  “Uh, yeah, sure.”  He shook Draco’s hand.  “Are you always so formal?” he laughed.  “I mean, Harry and I argue about stuff all the time.  I guess we just assume that when we’re finished, we go back to being friends.”
Reaching under his bed, Harry took out the journal and quill.  Draco had gone with Blaise to get some Quidditch practice in, leaving Harry with some time to himself.  He smiled to himself as he read the one and only entry.  Then added the second.
Harry was on his way to the Great Hall that evening when he saw Draco standing in the Entrance Hall, by the staircase with a small trunk in one hand and a paper in the other.
Trying his best to be nice to the difficult Slytherin girl, Anthony softened his approach.  He did not want to be on the receiving end of one of the punishments if he couldn’t hold up his end of the bargain.
The chair was empty now, but he could remember when it was occupied by Draco.  Harry couldn’t even begin to guess how many times over the past three years Draco had been called to his office.  Particularly recently.  The Aurors were always looking for information on Death Eaters and other criminals, or looking to confirm information they’d already gotten.  Harry was thorough in his job and relied heavily on informants.  But none so much as Draco.  A strange sort of trust had grown between them.
“It’s really not a big deal,” Draco began.  “My mother mainly wanted me home to tell me that the Manor is mine.”
The corner of Harry’s mouth curled up at the private reference.  He had no idea what Draco was going to say.  But somehow, he summed up what Harry thought as well.  He leaned forward and gave Draco a tender kiss, which, of course, Draco reciprocated.
Harry pushed Draco back onto the sofa, kissing him feverishly.  While they snogged, Draco let his hands wander down to Harry’s arse and pulled him flush against himself. They groaned as their cloth covered erections rubbed together.
“Malfoy has a visitor.”  The guard looked Hermione up and down.  “Some young thing says she’s got some personal business with him.”
“Harry, none of us knew. Only Dumbledore did.  There was no way we could have known what he sacrificed or how brave he really was,” Hermione pointed out.
“May I use your floo?  I’ll contact Professor McGonagall and let her know we’re coming back tonight,” Draco informed Arthur.
“I’ve seen this before, in other Aurors.  Losing a colleague or someone in their charge often leads to depression.”
“That’s different.  I agree we should make an effort with Draco.” Hermione sipped her pumpkin juice before continuing.  “After all, he’s not so bad.  He did ask me to be his writing partner,” she smirked.  “But the others . . .”
He got up and sashayed to the bed, purposely swaying his hips to entice Draco to follow.  It wasn’t necessary.  Draco would follow Harry to the ends of the Earth.
Moving his hands down Draco’s body to the front of his trousers, Harry massaged until he felt Draco rise to the occasion.
When they stepped over the threshold and into the unnecessarily large foyer, Harry’s eyes widened.  The Manor did indeed look quite different.  He dropped his suitcases and gaped at the warm and inviting coffee tones of the walls and sparse furnishings. A quick click, click, click on the ceramic tile flooring told him Narcissa was on her way.
Inwardly, Harry was gratified to hear that.  He felt guilty for being happy that Draco’s date had been a bust.
“It’s on the floor above,” Harry answered, but quickly added.  “I really think you’ll be more comfortable in here.”
“Draco, darling,” she smiled as she came into view.  She quickened her pace and reached out for a hug.
“It’s funny,” Harry said.  “There was a time when I couldn’t go out in public without someone accosting me--thanking me or telling me about their lost loved ones.  A few people asked me to bless them.”  He laughed out loud.
She knew what he meant.  “Fine.  Really.  I was feeling perfectly fine a couple of days after.” She looked away shyly.
“Remember when we were at the Leaky Cauldron?  And I asked him what he would do if you broke up with him.  I have to admit, what he said made me realize that I would be lost without Mione.  But I was making her wait for me and it wasn’t fair.  I needed to ask her to marry me before she realizes she could do a hell of a lot better than me.”
“Why do you have to choose?  Let’s do it everywhere,” Harry said. “But first I want to give you a present.”
The closer the time drew to ten o’clock, the more anxious Harry became.  He had asked the house elves earlier in the week if they would put together a small picnic snack for him and Draco for their ‘date’.  Harry still wasn’t sure if Draco meant that literally, but he didn’t want to show up empty handed.  At half-nine, Harry was about to go down to the kitchens to retrieve the food and ask if strawberries could be added last minute.
“You never even tried. I was five or six when I used to come in here, simply to be around Mother.  Surely, a six-year-old would understand something of what happened.”
The pair walked around the drawing room picking up clean nappies, dirty nappies, clean clothes, dirty clothes and just about every toy from Rose’s nursery.  While Harry took the empty bottles into the kitchen, Draco quietly crept into the nursery to put the toys away, and to check on Rose.
“It’s so short,” Padma complained.  “But I love it.”  She pulled her sister’s face close and examined it.  “Did you do your eyebrows too?”
McGonagall nodded.  “That was an excellent idea.  I had a feeling the two of you would be able to put aside your differences.  Dare I say, you seem to have become friends?”
Slamming his hips into Harry’s arse repeatedly, Draco panted and groaned. As he leaned farther against Harry, he pinned him to the arm rest.  The more Draco rocked them, the more friction Harry felt on his cock.
Not wanting to eavesdrop on the pair, Hermione turned her attention to Ron.  He more than happily accepted it.
“I know just the person.  Nobody is better at research than Hermione.”  Harry got up and walked to the fireplace.
“Pain?” the Healer looked through the notes again, then looked at Draco. “Yes, you said you felt terrible pain, then later realized the Mark was gone.”
“I knew. He came to my office. To thank me,” Harry told them. He sat in the overstuffed armchair that he had come to think of as his chair.
“Really, there isn’t any more to tell,” Harry insisted.  “I’ve just been trying to get through the school year and into the Auror program.  Very boring, actually.”  He put a rather large bite of potato in his mouth hoping she’d get the hint that he didn’t want to talk about it anymore.
Hermione went on.  “And seeing as you’ve taken that big step, have you allowed yourself to do that?  Have you fallen in love with him?”
“Like it or not, you’ve got a great name.  It’s simple and easy to remember. It’s likable. And if it helps to sell your book, why not use it?”
He figured maybe enough time had passed that she wasn’t as angry anymore.  Heaving in a large breath, he banged on the wall next to a tapestry.
“Harry,” Draco whispered.  In one fluid movement, he leaned back and pulled Harry up onto his lap without losing their connection.  With his hands on Harry’s hips, he guided his lover up and down his length.  “You feel incredible.”  He moved his hand to the neglected cock between them.  Harry’s subsequent moans urged his hand to stroke faster.  Again, Draco felt Harry’s hands in his hair.  The Gryffindor couldn’t seem to keep his fingers out of the white-blond tresses.  While Harry raised and lowered himself, Draco’s other hand caressed his chest.  Impulsively, Draco licked at the nipple bouncing up and down in front of him.  Harry let out a mewl, which encouraged the blond to suck.  He flicked it with his tongue several times, reveling in the sounds Harry made.
The corner of Harry’s mouth rose.  How many men had released themselves into Harry’s arse, he couldn’t count.  Not one had ever asked permission.  Though to be fair, most had worn condoms for that purpose.  But none of those who hadn’t, had considered Harry’s sensibilities the way Draco had.
“I want to get to know your friends, the way you’ve gotten to know Ron and Hermione. I want you to be part of your life, not take it over.”
In the meantime, George and Charlie were having a lively debate about Quidditch.  George was a Puddlemere United fan, like Harry, while Charlie rooted for the Chudley Cannons. Harry mentioned that he and Draco had seen Ginny play the Ballycastle Bats in autumn-- the game in which she had been injured slightly. It started a lively debate as to whether Finbar Quigley was one of the best Beaters ever to play the game. Harry enthusiastically agreed that he was.
“And miss out on the nude beaches?” Draco smirked.  “Besides, if all goes well, this will be our last holiday alone for a while.”
“Harry, how did you know I wanted these?” Draco immediately took them out of the box and tried them on.  They fit perfectly.
As Blaise was about to put a forkful of pork chop into his mouth, he said, “No.  Does it look like I’m finished?”
Ollivander shrugged. “I hear a lot of gossip here in the Alley.” He laughed. “But don’t worry, I don’t spread any of it myself. Besides, the two of you are rather obvious. What with standing so close and the longing gazes. I think there’s a certain balance to it though.”
Harry was referring to Draco’s very public coming out at the hands of a scorned lover.  Skeeter splashed the story on the front page of the newspaper for weeks.  Past lovers, and some simply looking for fame, came out of the woodwork to dish about Draco’s sex habits and strange fetishes.  Most were fabricated but it didn’t matter.  The wizarding world lapped it up and Draco had been humiliated.
Once inside the Leaky Cauldron, neither of them cared how they were dressed. The place was dark and filled with people that paid them no mind.  They had to wait several minutes for a table and each had a butter beer while they waited.
“He said he’s never wanted them.  And I have to agree,” Harry added quickly, not meaning to blame Draco for the disappointed look on Narcissa’s face. “We’re happy with our life the way it is.  We have plans and aspirations.  Children would complicate things.”
“And a source of painful memories for all of us.” Draco took a sip of his lemonade. “Why do you think I moved out in the first place? I haven’t decided what I’m going to do with it. I’ll think about it later.”
Deep down, Harry knew he was probably right.  His relationship with Draco could be used against him, if it came down to a fight.  Harry hoped it wouldn’t come down to that.
“One week,” Pansy answered.  “And you may possibly lose the right to attend future wand parties.  Any more questions?”
Hermione cleared her throat.  “Every moment you waste thinking it over could mean peril for Draco.”  She deliberately used his son’s first name to help persuade him. “I have special permission to escort you to the Manor.  In return for helping to rescue Auror Potter, your sentence will be reduced.”
“His arrogance is unwarranted. He’s just a Beater. But you have every right to be conceited.” He whispered, “You’re practically perfect.”
“Meaning, we should live our lives the way we want and be happy.  We shouldn’t hide.  We shouldn’t have to.” Draco grinned, “I’m happy and I plan on living my life out loud.”
“But that’s not what you want to hear,” Harry said, understanding.  “You want to know that I love you enough to risk hurting your feelings, or getting mine hurt, in order to keep our marriage strong.”
Gradually, the moans and groans became louder, and Harry recognized the voice as Luna’s.  Neither he, nor Draco intended to eavesdrop, but curiosity and a bit of voyeurism kept them there, standing in the corridor listening.
No one else was in a mood to eat, as they were anxious to see that Arthur was all right for themselves.  Hermione and Harry took the lift down to the cafeteria by themselves.
Slipping out the door, Harry quickly and quietly as possible bounded down the stairs toward his own quarters.  He strolled on lost in thoughts of the evening.  He couldn’t wait to tell---
“Draco, haven’t I proven that I want you?  Even if Knox does have a little crush on me, it doesn’t matter.  It’s you I want to be with.”
“I’m getting some lube,” Draco whispered behind him.  He tugged at Harry with renewed fervor.  With all the attention Harry had gotten to arouse him, it didn’t take long for him to spill out onto the bed and Draco’s hand.  Draco scooped up as much of the jit as he could and rubbed it on his erection.
“I suppose we’ve studied enough for now.” She carefully closed her book, keeping her place with a parchment scribbled with notes.  Hermione glanced at Harry and Draco, and smiled.  Seeing them as they were at that moment, made her almost forget that their previous rivalry had ever existed. She watched as Harry gazed up at his lover, who was mesmerized by the flickering fire.
Without pulling up his trousers, Draco lay down next to Harry on the soft pad and rested his head on Harry’s shoulder.
“Really?” Draco queried. “I had no idea books were so lucrative. You’d think the owner of Obscurus Books would dress a little better.”
“Harry, this is a huge assignment.  I had no idea it was so important when you told me about it.  And you’ve stuck Ginny with Zabini,” she admonished.
“I am not,” was all Draco could come up with.  And he wasn’t.  Not precisely afraid, but intimidated.  “At least my father cared enough about me not to leave me in America all alone.”
The door suddenly opened and Harry found himself face to face with the object of his affections, dripping wet with a towel wrapped around his waist and another being rubbed on his head.
Out of the corner of his eye, Harry saw someone stand up. It was a Ravenclaw boy named Stewart, a few years behind Harry.
Draco scanned the trio apprehensively. “Well, I don’t have a partner yet and I thought perhaps those two paired up,” he gestured to Harry and Ron.  “And you would be in need of one. I’d do my fair share.”
“They needed a bit of time on their own.  They were talking potions, and I think they were planning to brew something.  Not my forte,” Harry laughed.
“They certainly sounded like Weasleys to me,” Draco commented, not happy at all with Harry’s reading.
“Be safe.”  He kissed her gently before hardening his gaze on Malfoy.  “If you don’t come out with Harry and Hermione, don’t bother coming out at all.”
Knox nodded. “My parents’ trial begins in two weeks. I’m not certain what the delay was, but they’ve been in prison all this time.”
The next several days had Draco on edge.  His father still hadn’t been brought into the Ministry to give his testimony. And it would take some time while they debated the validity of his information once he did.  He didn’t know how his father would react if the Minister decided not to honor the deal after all.
It wasn’t the candy Hermione was jealous of.  Hermione had set a goal for herself to win the most challenges in Potions this year.  And she was not off to the start she had hoped for.
“Well, what do you think, Ron?  Are you going to buy that for Mione?” Harry gestured to the bracelet in Ron’s hand.
“No.  I mean, yes.  I love it.  It’s just that . . . you’ve done so much for me and, well, I feel like I’ve barely done anything.”
A soft knock came at his door.  Harry opened his eyes, seeing nothing but the darkness of his desk. Whoever it was would surely go away if Harry didn’t respond.  He closed his eyes again.
“Hi Hermione.”  Harry sat up and spoke into the flames.  “You caught me napping,”  he chuckled with embarrassment.
“That’s smart,” Hermione said.  “Unfortunately, Ron and I may have to do the same.  But not until we’re married.  Although, Ron has been accepted into the Auror training program,” she beamed.
Returning to the classroom, he picked up spare books and shelved them, replaced quills and filled the ink pots and vanished any ingredients that had been left out.
Draco groaned. He wanted to please Harry. However, the thought of going to a crowded, garish amusement park full of loud, obnoxious muggles was none too appealing. He just knew Harry would love the places he wanted to take him.
“Potter,” Draco sighed. “I’m broken, in several places. None of which are going to improve on their own. You can stop with the constant assessing. I know it’s part of your training, but can we just assume nothing will change in the near future?”
Ron opened the door to his dormitory and placed his small trunk at the foot of his bed.  When he turned around, he was greeted by the sight of Harry in bed sleeping, one arm propped up under his head.  The other was resting on a sleeping blond wrapped around him.
“No.  But I do keep having some dreams over again.” Something occurred to Harry, and he abruptly changed the subject.  “What do you mean, you’re never going to fall in love?”
It all flew out the window the moment Draco walked in the door.  Harry felt a flutter in his belly.  A small one, but it was present nonetheless.  He dismissed it as being nervous about his little personal experiment.  Before Draco sat in his chair, his eyes briefly flashed to Harry.  It felt like an electrical impulse went through Harry and his heart began to beat a bit faster.  Gone almost as quickly as it came, the feeling left little doubt in Harry’s mind that his reaction to Draco was unlike the others.
Joining in on the discussion, Harry volunteered.  “I wouldn’t mind at all staying here to supervise.  I don’t have family to visit, as most of you do.  I’m sure Professor Malfoy wouldn’t mind either.”
Without thinking, as usual, Ron spoke out of turn.  “Oi, Malfoy.  Do you know what’s wrong with Harry?”
“The new bloke is sort of ‘on call’.  After I thought about it a while, it made sense that maybe the professors should take turns being on duty for the weekends.”
“This is becoming a habit,” Draco smirked as he walked into his dormitory to find Pansy siting on his bed.
“James!  You heard your father.  Get over here now.”  Harry seemed to appear out of nowhere, holding a bunch of cut flowers.  “Narcissa, when did you get back?”  He kissed her cheek and handed her the flowers.  “I was going to put these in your room.”
Eventually, Draco himself grinned.  “Father nearly had a heart attack when I picked those colors.”  He looked to Harry.  “I think that was how I came out him.”
Pansy shrugged.  “I guess that’s the fun of it.  Besides, you don’t have to have sex with the other person, just spend the night.”
“No, no.  Worse.  I keep having a dream where Draco is talking to Blaise about me.  He tells him he’s trying to get me to fall in love with him so he can humiliate me.  So he can get me back for all the things I’ve done to him over the years.”
“What are you talking about?  She used to put spells on the books to make sure we brought them back on time.”
Draco glanced about the room. “In light of some of the discoveries about to be made inside the Manor, he went into hiding with my mother.  Unfortunately, the reduced sentence he received for helping rescue you and me doesn’t apply to any new charges that may be filed.”
“Well, then, that’s means she’s free. Maybe she’d like to come with me.”  Harry leaned in.  “You could have a bit of a break.  Maybe go flying,” Harry smiled.
“Yes, there!”  Harry exclaimed when Draco pulled Harry to a more upright position.  He stroked himself in time with their rhythm.
Smiling, Virgil explained.  “A lot of people who visit don’t like to be reminded that their loved ones are criminals in prison.”
“Yeah.” Harry blushed.  “I was having dreams about being in your bed long before school even started this Fall.”
“Maybe not now, but I always thought someday I’d like to have children.  I’ve enjoyed the time I’ve spent with Teddy over the years.”
Pansy continued. “The Chooser cannot force the Chosen to have intercourse.  I’m sure there are more than a few virgins here in Gryffindor.” she sniggered.  “If both parties consent, then by all means, have at it.  But all other sexual favors are obligatory.  The Chooser cannot force the Chosen to perform illegal acts.  Immoral, yes, but not illegal.”
“Are you sure you don’t want to come back into the Auror program, Harry?” Kingsley Shacklebolt asked.  “You could rejoin as an interrogator.  You did a great job on the Malfoy case.”
After decimating the Chinese food, Ron, Hermione, Harry and Draco lounged with full bellies.  Ron lay down on the settee while Hermione sat on the floor in front of him, leaning her head against his leg.  Harry had pulled a few pillows from Draco’s bed and the two of them were lying side by side on the floor facing the other two.
Draco bolted up.  “Way past curfew.”  He pulled his wand from the side pocket on his jeans and performed a Scourgify on both of them, then proceeded to pull up his trousers.  Harry stole a glance at Draco’s package as it disappeared behind the denim. He dressed, then Vanished the pillows and pad, while Draco removed the silencing and locking charms.  The pair gathered their belongings and peered into the corridor.  Finding it empty, they stepped out of the Potions classroom.
Before Harry could reply, students began noisily filing in.  Draco got up and went to his usual seat.
Breaking away from Draco, Harry turned to Ron.  “I don’t expect you to.  I am hoping you’ll accept it though.  And maybe, eventually, you’ll be happy for us.”
Draco nodded.  “Yes, that’s what the Healer called it.  He said he’d never seen a case himself.  But he had heard of it happening.”
“Let’s go Slytherins,” Draco called to his group.  He turned to Harry with a wavering expression.  “Should we . . . leave separately or something?”
“Draco spent the weekend here with me.  I know you’ve seen the interview in the Daily Prophet, so you know the nature of our relationship.  Is this going to be a problem?”
The four of them, and the puppy, went into the house.  Draco’s parents were sitting on the sofa listening to Arthur tell them about a muggle device he’d come across recently.
Honestly, he didn’t. He’d been too busy noticing other things. Harry told him what Ron said about the mansion and the artifacts found. They set up a time for Harry to pick Draco up and take him to St. Mungo’s, though Draco insisted he didn’t really need an escort. The beauty of being an Auror was the flexibility. Harry was happy to be able to come and go occasionally for personal errands.
“Oh.  How is it different from any other journal?” Harry wondered why anyone would not write the truth down in their own diary.  Weren’t all diaries essentially the truth?  Or the writer’s version of it.
“I’d like that,” Harry replied. “I was there a couple of times, but on official Auror business, not on holiday.  Actually, I’ve been a lot of places on business that I’d like to see for leisure.”
Feeling somewhat better, Draco was finally able to look Harry in the eye.  Harry gave him a gentle kiss.
“You and Dean.  Are you certain?” Harry asked, not quite tipping his hand.  He was hoping for Ginny to come clean about the situation before he called her on it.
“All right, Mother.  Tell me what’s going on.”  Draco sipped his tea.  “Why would Father simply hand over the Manor to me?”
Just then, Michael walked into the common room after having spent the night with Pansy.  His mouth gaped and his eyes widened at the sight of Parvati.
They both downed their drinks.  Draco made his opening move and waited for Harry to either move a piece or answer his question.
He pushed forward a few more times, then stilled as he groaned loudly. Harry let out a heavy sigh and kissed Draco’s shoulder. Draco pulled Harry’s face toward him and pressed their mouths together. Coming back from his post orgasmic languor, Harry resumed stroking Draco’s cock as they snogged passionately.
“I’m so sorry,” Harry pulled Draco close.  “This is all my fault.  I had to go and out myself in the Leaky Cauldron of all places.”
“Well, I was really hoping I could get in to see Draco. You see, we had a harrowing time of it. Very dangerous mission. He very nearly died. I saved his life, so I wanted to check on him.” He leaned forward a bit more. The witch did the same. “I feel somewhat responsible for him, you know?” he said in a low voice, as if to share a confidence.
Minerva leaned a little closer and lowered her voice.  “He stays in Hagrid’s hut most of the time.  Not very social.”
Harry shrugged.  “I don’t know what we’re doing.  We didn’t make plans.  But I don’t want him to go shopping with me. I need to shop
“As exemplary as you have conducted yourself this evening, it was difficult for me not to observe the way your attention has been split.”
Harry nodded.  “As I’ll ever be.  Are you certain you can get me through the wards?” 	“Let’s find out,” Draco smiled.
“I’m not worried, exactly.  But, don’t you think it’s odd, that she wants to see you out of the blue?”
Lily looked up with questioning emerald eyes.  “What do we call her?”  It was a question on everyone’s mind.
Hovering over Harry, Draco peppered him with kisses, making sure to get the small oval scar, down his body until he reached Harry’s cock.  He kissed it gently and took it in his hand.  It didn’t take long for Draco to coax it to its full potential.
“No danger there,” Draco breathed.  His body tensed and he clutched at Harry’s hips, pulling him down hard. “Oh fuck, Harry.”
“Ah, yes, the core of this one is unusual. Peacock feather. I’ve only used peacock a handful of times. It takes a special sort to master the wand of peacock core. And you, Mr. Malfoy, are a special sort.”
The music switched back to the Weird Sister’s usual loud, raucous dance beat, sending students back to the dance floor.  Harry and Draco didn’t seem to notice and continued to snog.  They vacillated between dancing and snogging for the remainder of the night.  Harry noted that the girl with the cleavage never came back.
“Ron, he needs one,” Hermione told him.  She turned to the senior Malfoy.  “You can use mine.” Reluctantly, she held out her wand to him.
“I did,” the blond confessed.  “For a little while.  But I drove you to it.  And what I hated was what Vol-- you-know-who, was making me do.  I hated myself more than you.”
“She does like to be rocked rather forcefully,” Hermione laughed.  “Did she drink her bottle all right?”
The conversation was all about the upcoming Quidditch match between Slytherin and Gryffindor at the lunch table.  Though their Houses were rivals, Harry and Draco were trying not to be overly heated in their debate over which team would win.  Knox, not being head of a particular House, pretended to remain neutral.
Sitting up straighter, Harry answered, “Yes, of course.  It’s not a matter of being good enough, anyway.”
“To you, anyway,” Ron chuckled.  “She’s been talking my ear off about how you two would make such good parents.  Congratulations.  At least I think so.  You’re in for a lot of sleepless nights.”
“Then take me, please,” Draco begged.  He pulled Harry toward the bed.  They toppled over in a tangle of limbs, kissing.
Harry’s body jerked and spewed out onto the shower wall.  Draco hadn’t stopped driving into him and was close to climaxing.  If he didn’t pass out first.
“And, if it means anything at all,” Draco addressed her.  “I truly am sorry for the way I treated you. The way I treated all of you.”
“I don’t know why or what the circumstances are, but I see Draco pointing his wand at you . . . and then casting the killing curse.”
Harry climbed up and lay next to Draco on the silky sheets.  He wrapped his arms around him and tenderly kissed the back of his neck.
“Thanks,” Draco said uncomfortably.  “Listen, don’t say anything to Pansy.  The last thing I need is for her to tease me about–”
Harry liked this game.  It kept the conversation moving and no subject seemed to be taboo.  He relaxed a bit at Draco’s suggestion, and nodded his approval.
Harry and Ron laughed out loud at the expression on Skeeter’s face, while Hermione sat pleased by the pub owner’s support of Harry.
“Best wishes, Hermione,” Draco said easily enough.  He found it a smoother transition from Granger to Hermione than Weasley to Ron.  “You’ll make a lovely bride.”
“Look, we’re already moving up,” Harry said optimistically. “That sign up ahead says the wait is thirty minutes.”
The blond leaned forward and kissed Harry’s neck, then his collar bones. He worked his way down Harry’s chest, pausing on each nipple. The brunet’s back arched involuntarily with every flick of Draco’s tongue. When the blond scraped his teeth against one of them, Harry gently pulled Draco’s head up.
Draco frowned. “It’s just something I thought wasn’t in the cards for me.  Unless someone has invented a pregnancy spell for wizards,” he said.  He paused and glanced over at Ron and Hermione.  “I’m realizing that there is much more we don’t know about each other, than we do.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Fine,” he said, feeling more than a little foolish for his semi-monologue earlier. Harry went back into the kitchen to get the potion Draco was supposed to take. When he handed it to Draco, he had his own monologue to recite.
He shrugged.  “There are lots of suspects out there.  And probably even more that we don’t know about.”
With a flourish of her wand, Harry’s secret was once again hidden.   The server came by and they ordered soup and crackers, with butter beer on the side.
“But these are happy tears,” Draco protested.  He leaned forward and kissed Harry. “I’ve never been happier.”
Harry used his toes to anchor himself and began to thrust harder and more deeply into his lover’s arse.
Frowning, Harry had to agree. “True.  But Flitwick’s quarters are very nice.  Actually, I always thought it was ironic that the smallest professor had one of the biggest suites.  You might want to reconsider.”
“The things you do for me are intangible, valuable beyond measure.  I am happy.  And that is no small thing to me.”
“Fuckin’ hell, don’t do that again,” Anthony scolded.  “Let’s go to the kitchens and see if we can get something to eat.  We got nothin’ better to do.”
Harry took Draco by the shoulders.  “No, you didn’t drive me to do anything.  I didn’t want Knox to kiss me.  I was never interested in him that way.  I only wanted friendship from him.  I was being a tease. Not consciously, but still . . .”  He averted his eyes and stepped back, not being able to take the scrutiny of Draco’s stare.
Reluctantly, Draco agreed as there was no way he could get the classroom and Snape’s quarters in order before the students arrived.  He would have to settle for the sixth floor for the time being.
“I heard you,” Harry admitted finally.  “At your parents’ house on Christmas.  I heard the two of you talking about it.  You’re not sure whose baby that is.” He pointed at her still flat belly.
“But you must use that quill,” Draco warned him.  “It’s the combination that does the trick.  It’s simply a journal with a regular quill.”
“She really seems to respond to your voice,” Harry said.  “You sound different when you talk to her.” He took a moment to admire the two of them.
“Oh, what are you complaining about?  You got wanked by the most popular girl at Hogwarts.  And I get to say I wanked Harry Potter.”
“He was nice enough I guess,” the blond shrugged.  “There was no chemistry. No . . . passion.  We could barely carry on a conversation.”
The girl then beamed at Harry and slapped his bum before turning to dance with the nearest masculine appearing party goer.  Still holding Harry’s right hand, Draco began to bounce up and down along with the rest of the horde.
“She actually went out with me.  The date was just as awkward, though.  I was always so awkward with the girls.”
“I was just wondering, do you think I’ll be able to keep the quarters I have now rather than moving up to Flitwick’s?  I mean, it doesn’t seem to make sense that the Charms class room is on the second floor, but the office is on the seventh.”
Blaise closed his eyes and cradled his head in his hands. “I don’t know what I want.  Mum has found a bride for me already.  She’s actually quite nice, as far as girls go.  And filthy rich.  We could have our own vineyard, if we want.  I could have an easy life.”
“I don’t know if I’d go that far.  It’s a good thing I didn’t eat before we got on,” Draco said. “But it was sort of like flying for a bit.”
“You actually want me to go with you?”  Harry asked.  “I thought you were being polite.  Wouldn’t you rather take Blaise?”
Draco returned to a silent kitchen and knew someone had been talking about him.  He handed the bottle of wine to Arthur.
“Oh, thank you.  I’ll only be a moment,” Hermione said gratefully.  She lay Rose in Draco’s arms carefully so as not to wake her.
friend.”  She sighed.  “Did you know at the last wand party, Theo and I were the only ones to show?”
“Hi.  We need to talk.”  No point beating around the bush. He began to walk toward his dormitory without waiting to see if she’d follow.  He knew she would.
“I wanted to know where you get your, um,” Draco rolled his eyes.  This may be more humiliation than he could handle. “Your, uh . . . lube,” he said quickly.  “Do you conjure it or buy it?”
Tracey Davis and Anthony Goldstein had already broken up.  Millicent Bulstrode and Justin Finch-Fletchley had been moving at such a slow pace, they could hardly be called a couple.  Oddly enough, they still had plans for Valentine’s Day evening.  Draco surmised that it was more out of desperation that they were still giving it a go.  Michael Corner and Parvati Patil were seen less and less together.  Draco saw it as a sign that they were brought together only by the game. Seamus and Astoria, and Ernie and Daphne hadn’t gotten off to much of a start as couples having been paired late in the game.  But both pairs immediately fell out of favor with one another when the game was ended.
Thick, opaque, streams shot from Draco, leaving streaks of jizz along the length of his torso and pooling a bit in the hollow of his neck.
“Yeah, I know.  That’s why I asked him,” Harry laughed.  “He probably forgot I’m not an Auror anymore.  It’s true then?  Lucius is going to give up some more Death Eaters?  After all this time, do you really think he has relevant information?”
They got into the shower, facing each other.  Reaching around Harry, Draco took a flannel and poured some liquid soap on it.  Harry tilted his head back as Draco rubbed the flannel over his chest.  Draco’s hand moved up and down slowly, wiping sweat and grime away and leaving fresh, clean skin behind.
Since many of the Seventh and Eighth Years had already been in Slytherin for the wand parties, those wishing to celebrate the New Year together gathered there.  Pansy graciously allowed Harry to invite the three underclass Gryffindors, who mainly stood wide-eyed in the corner.
“She’s already two and a half months along.  She doesn’t want to be showing in her dress.  Even though everyone will be able to do the math once the brat is born.”
Ron pursed his lips.  It wasn’t as if he and Hermione hadn’t enough attention in the past several months.  But it would have been nice if Percy had waited a little bit, at least.
“I’ll wear a ponytail next time,” she whispered.  Her attempt to comb through his hair wasn’t any more successful.  She knocked his glasses off one ear, almost poking him in the eye.
He looked over the hall as students began to look back up at him.  “You want to know so badly?  Fine.  I’m bent, a pouf, gay, homosexual, a bender, a fairy or whatever you like to call it.  And I’m not ashamed.  I don’t care what anyone else thinks. Is everybody satisfied?”  He held up his arms to emphasize his point.  Without waiting for a response to his rhetorical question, Harry made his way to the entrance of the Great Hall, which remained in silent shock.  The only other movement came from Pansy, who intercepted him before he could escape.
Their breathing gradually returned to normal from the fevered panting it had been. Draco’s eyes remained closed while Harry stared at the ceiling. This was the part he was most anxious about. So many times before, there had been little to say between him and his lovers after sex. It had become his habit to leave shortly after and sleep alone. On the odd occasion that he invited a lover to his flat, he neglected to extend the invitation to sleep over.
Harry laughed harder. “No.  I believe you’re quite serious.  I’ll stop asking you about yours, then.  You’re right, what matters is that we’re together now.”
“Now it’s time for that shower,” Harry said with a yawn.  “I’m so glad you don’t have to go back to your room to do that.”
After pulling up his fresh pants and black jeans that Blaise had chosen, Draco sat nervously on his bed.
Alastair, the student next to Casper, nudged him when Draco walked away.  “Oi, when did you suddenly become a swot?”
“Draco,” he said as he opened the door.  “What are you doing here?  I thought you had lesson plans to write.”
“I sort of made an announcement at supper,” Harry admitted sheepishly as he recalled Draco’s imitation.  “Although, I didn’t quite do it the way you would have me do it.”
Harry stretched and yawned after a peaceful night’s sleep.  Draco was still dozing next to him, so he carefully got out of bed and pulled on a pair of pajama bottoms and t-shirt.  Stealthily making his way out of the room, Harry stepped into the hallway and realized that he really didn’t know his way around the Manor.
Harry glanced at the clock on the mantle. “Shit. Is that the correct time? I should go. I have some paperwork to do.”
Harry smiled.  “Not everyone takes seven years to fall in love.  And I can’t explain it.  Maybe Draco and I were destined to be together.  We just went about it the wrong way at first.”
Ron leaned close.  “It’s one of the reasons we moved up the wedding.  She’s two months up the duff.  Of course, we didn’t tell Mum that.”
Ron shrugged.  “Maybe he had somewhere else to go.  I wasn’t really paying much attention.” He stood tall.  “I came in third.  Did you see?”
Harry made his way back toward his chambers afterward.  He had planned a floo call with Ron and Hermione that night, but other than that, he had no real plans for the weekend.  He wished he had suggested that he and Draco go out that night, since it was Friday.  If he suggested it now, he would appear too eager.
“Oh, come on, I’m only taking the piss. Besides, it’s not like everyone doesn’t know why Harry always took Malfoy out. You pointed it out to me yourself. And look, it’s all worked out for the best.”
“It’s not an autobiography,” Draco interjected. “He’s going to write it as a fiction novel.  For muggles.”
“The chaperones would spell the wands with a minor repelling charm.  When placed between a couple dancing, it would automatically push them the requisite six inches apart,” she told him.  “And students would never have been allowed to kiss on the dance floor.”
Draco opened his mouth to turn down the offer, but realized that it would take a lot longer to get things in order on his own.
Continuing his self-imposed research project at supper, Harry was quietly observing all of the other students, including his closest mates.  There was a time when he would look at Ginny and get a feeling of butterflies, but it was gone now.  And when he gazed over at Pansy, he had to admit to experiencing a warm sensation in his nether regions.  But that was only a physical reaction to his memory of a couple of nights ago.
“I’d say you’ll have a window of August twenty-eighth to September fourth. Be prepared to come in on short notice.”
“Now, the person you are partnered with today is the person you will remain with throughout the project, so I hope you all are comfortable with the person sitting next to you.”
Harry stood, “Listen, do you mind if I beg off tonight? I’m exhausted. I didn’t sleep last night, and I meant to take a nap but, then Dra– Malfoy came to my office. I just want to sleep. You understand, don’t you?”
“Draco, you should speak to your father about this.  I think there are many things you have to say to one another.”
Finally comprehending what it was she was seeing, or more precisely, not seeing, Narcissa cried out.
“Is it about the trip?” Harry asked.  “Because, we don’t have to go.  We can pick someplace different-”
The sweet shop was crowded, and Harry split off from Hermione to get some Liquorice Wands.  He knew Draco liked them very much.  So did Harry.  As he perused the shop, he also picked up a few Cauldron Cakes.  The Sugared Butterfly Wings caught Harry’s eye as he queued to pay for his items.  He remembered Draco mentioning them during one of their conversations.  He picked up a tin and added them to his order.  He would save the Butterfly Wings for a Christmas gift.  The other sweets he would share with Draco right away.
Narcissa smiled sweetly at her boy, then hugged him lightly.  “I don’t want you to ever have to worry about that again.  This will always be your home.  I’ve made certain of that.”
Reluctantly, Blaise followed.  He was loath to continue their conversation, but he was getting tired. In silence they landed and dismounted.  Draco began to remove his equipment, but Blaise just stood, appearing to be deep in thought.
The Sisters slowed down the music and the dance floor cleared by more than half.  Harry and Draco found themselves feeling much more exposed than before without so many others to hide amongst.  Both Harry and Draco tried to wrap their arms around the other’s waist.
“I plan on going back to Diagon Alley to get one of my own, but, for now, do you suppose I could use one of the ones you have?”
“What unscrupulous officiant would bind two young boys? You tell me who it was.” Narcissa was furious.  Not only had he gone and done something permanently stupid, he’d done it with his former archenemy.  She was going to have the head of the unethical, immoral and disreputable officiant who performed the ceremony. And if it happened to be a man, she’d have his bollocks as well.
As casually as he could, Harry walked to Draco’s table, which was one row in front and to the right of Hermione and Ron’s table.
Draco laughed. It was probably the first time Harry heard him laugh without it being at Harry’s expense.  “Yes.  She’s plenty safe.  You know the homosexuals Pansy was talking about?  He’s one of them.”
Harry complied and continued to pump.  He rose to his knees for better leverage, holding Draco’s legs in place.
With a look that could pin Harry in place, Draco addressed the subject Harry hoped would never come up.
“I tidied up a bit in the Potions room,” Draco said. “But I plan on doing some experimenting, so I don’t want to put everything away.”
“Oi, I’m right here,” Ron complained. He got up and tried to join another conversation. He glanced at Pansy and Seamus.  No way was he cutting in there.  Whatever Harper was saying to Harry and Hermione, he was using huge hand gestures.  His friends were laughing, but the faces Harper was making were enough to give Ron pause.  He almost didn’t see Dean sitting in the corner by himself.  Ron wandered over.
As Harry and Hermione found their way back to the Leaky Cauldron to use the floo, Harry was thinking about the dreams he described to Hermione.
Mel pursed her lips.  “I don’t like wearing glamours.”  She shrugged, “But I enjoy being a girl.”  She retied her scarf.
Draco glanced at Harry.  They’d had a discussion earlier that morning about proper attire.  Harry had assured him that the Weasleys were casual, down to earth sorts, and that Draco’s jumper was proper attire. Most of the Weasleys themselves were dressed similarly.
“The first time I met him.  I could see he was trouble a mile away.”  Ron snorted. “Well, we’ll have the last laugh.”
Briefly, when Harry thought about the time spent with Draco, his walls came down.  “No.  It feels . . . right.  Natural.  Good.”  In an instant, his defenses were back up.  “I don’t know. It’s a lot to get used to.  It’s so strange and new. I mean, I grew up hearing about how disgusting the poofters were.”
“It strengthens both witch and wizard.  Sort of like filling in the weaknesses.  You don’t exactly acquire each other’s skills, but rather, have the ability to borrow strength.”
Harry chuckled.  “It was a bit strange though, don’t you think?  I sort of felt like I was sucking myself off.”
Getting caught up in the moment, she answered, “I want you to make love to me.  Make me cum.  Make me feel special.”
“His name will be on the forms, the same as yours,” Ms. Singleton told Harry. “But, of course, yours will be the selling point.”
“He’s not your replacement.  He’s a temporary substitute.  But he’s okay I guess. The students haven’t complained.”
Harry turned to him. “You were here, Ron.  You know as much as we do.”  He’d brought Ron for moral support but was now regretting it. Ron seemed more nervous than he felt.
The Healer smiled.  “Enjoy it.  There’s nothing to be done. It’s permanent.”  He looked back and forth between the boys.  “In my forty-six years as a healer, I’ve never come across a case of spontaneous binding.  Heard of one or two from the past.”
Ron and Hermione laughed as Harry recounted the story Draco and his mother told about Draco’s coming out to his father.
There were a few snickers around the room.  Seamus spoke up. “Well, maybe we didn’t know at the time, but looking back, there were signs.”
“Mr. Potter, you defeated the most powerful dark wizard of all.  Do you doubt that you have the ability to vanquish the small amount of dark magic held in Mr. Malfoy’s Dark Mark?”
Ron’s eyes grew big and he got flushed.  He didn’t expect Draco to come out and say they were shagging.  It was definitely one of those things you pretended not to know about your friends.
Most of the day had been spent dividing Snape’s belongings and rearranging the things Draco decided to keep.  He offered Harry a few trinkets as keepsakes and put the rest in a small box for McGonagall to donate. Before too long, most of the office had been restored to functional, if not comfortable.
“I have to tell my parents soon.  She said she saw a headline about us.  I’m assuming the Prophet.  I don’t want my parents reading about it in the papers.”
Draco grinned.  “You really don’t remember?”  Harry shook his head.  “You, um, got me in a bit of a state, and then passed out on me.  You left me more than just a bit frustrated,” Draco snickered.
“You’re still going to Hogsmeade tomorrow, right?  Better get to sleep.” Harry called as he seemed to glide toward his dormitory.
“No, I mean . . . personal cleansing,” Draco didn’t blush often, but he could feel his ears getting warm and he knew they must be bright pink.
“Besides,” Draco smiled.  “It’s like we’re married already.  I don’t need a silly ceremony for that.”
After supper that evening, Pansy and Blaise snuck up to Gryffindor tower.  Seventh and Eighth Year students gathered in the dormitory that Harry shared with the other eighth year boys.
“I’m not breaking up with you.  And you’re not leaving Hogwarts,” Harry said.  “And I am going to fix this.”
“You are for me.  Look, I don’t know what the issue is between you two.  But whatever it is, it doesn’t have anything to do with us.  You can’t let it come between you and me.”
“I’m very sorry about the state of your home,” Hermione offered. “It will take some time to get it back to its former glory.”
Stepping out onto the paved patio, Harry could see why Draco didn’t bother conjuring flowers.  Surrounding the terrace were rose bushes of every color imaginable, delphiniums and petunias and lavender orchids.  He gazed around in awe.
When it was over, Harry leaned back on his heels.  He watched as Draco’s breathing evened out, then grabbed his wand from his discarded trousers to perform a cleansing spell on them.
While spooning the yogurt into his mouth, Harry opened a bag of pretzels and began dipping them in the peanut butter. Even Hermione wouldn’t be able to criticize his snack choice.
“I’m too tired to eat. I promise I’ll have a huge breakfast,” he said when he saw the motherly glint in her eye.
“It’s a bit soon to be making those sorts of plans between you.  You’ve only been together a short while.  Perhaps his lust for you is waning.”
Draco shook his head, then decided to be truthful.  “Well, maybe just a tiny bit.  That thing’s bigger than it looks.”  He glanced down between them.  “It
“They’re not so bad,” Harry laughed. “I haven’t gotten to know them nearly as well as Draco has gotten to know you and Hermione. But they’ve been good friends to him.  Even through all the changes he’s gone through.”
“I didn’t want to feed your ego too much,” Draco teased.  “But it was actually by far the best.” He stood and kissed Harry.  “I’m sorry.”
By the time Draco reached the Potions room, he was ten minutes late.  His conversation with Blaise had taken more time than he planned.  And gave him much more to think about than he expected.  As a consequence, Draco was frowning slightly when he walked into the room.  On top of Blaise’s words weighing on his mind, he couldn’t get through the locking charm right away.
“Get away with what?  He didn’t really get anything out of it.  Except maybe working me up into needing a good, long, hot shower.”  Harry said each word slowly for emphasis.
Knees buckling, Harry shuddered and cried out.  He grabbed tightly onto the other man’s shoulder to steady himself as he came all over Draco’s hand, his own clothes and a bit on the floor.  His head fell back in white hot pleasure.
“Still, a student who requires private tutoring should have been brought to my attention,” the Headmistress said.
I can’t believe I’m going to die by a fucking trip jinx, Draco thought bitterly.  After everything I’ve been through.  It’s hardly fitting.
Draco sighed as he sat at his desk, grading papers after supper that night. Harry came up behind him to rub his shoulders.
“Relax, Draco. No one has any idea,” Harry said as if reading his mind.  “Now hold still a moment.  I’m going to remove the glamour.  It feels a little weird as the magic conforms to your shape before dissolving.”
Ginny scowled.  Even though Hermione had been talking about it all week, Ginny didn’t believe anything would come of it.  She and Hermione had been a great pair.
“So, you’re all right with this?” Harry asked timidly. Even being a twenty-four year old independent man, he still sought the approval of his friends.
Harry glanced up at Ron.  “Yeah.  It’s my own fault.”  He shook his head.  “Such reckless behavior.  Then I didn’t even have the good sense to keep my mouth shut about it.”
Harry reddened slightly.  “Oh, uh, yeah.  But what I meant was, um, passion about life.  You know, something that keeps you excited, energized.”
The other two men glared at each other a moment.  Feeling the need to gain the upper hand, Draco moved closer to Harry and picked at his hair.
“No.  Molly won’t let anyone share rooms.  The girls are with girls and boys with– but you and I wouldn’t be allowed to stay together.”
“Sorry.  Weasley tradition.  You’re one of us now, and you have to celebrate your birthday with the family,” Harry told him.  “Besides, Molly was horrified that she missed it last year and she wants to make up for it.”
“Whatever you want.”  Harry wouldn’t admit that he was a little disappointed.  After all, he felt that he and Narcissa had come to an understanding of sorts.  A truce even.
“Professor?” McGonagall questioned.  “Your family’s activities during the war don’t reflect badly on you. There’s no need to leave.”
“I’ve been half hard ever since we sat down at Three Broomsticks,” Harry mumbled into the blond’s mouth.  “I want you to fuck me.”
Harry sighed.  “Draco, I don’t have the energy for this right now.  We’ll talk on Friday in the Potions room.” He turned and kept walking to his dormitory without looking back.  All Harry could think about was sleep.
Ginny turned around and smiled sadly at Harry.  “We shouldn’t be spying,” she said softly to the rest of the women.
“I don’t think so. But I can’t help wondering.”  Harry rubbed his eyes under his glasses.  “Ever since Draco told me about the spells, I’ve been going over the timing of everything in my head. I broke up with Ginny before the game.  But I didn’t become aware of my, um, orientation until after the game started.  Could a spell have done that?  Could it truly make me feel the same as real love?”
“We will if we want to,” Harry told him.  “I wish I’d never had that reading.  Prophecy is never exactly what it seems.  None of my dreams turned out just the way I saw them.”
“Well, if it is, it works.  Good thing I’m out of here tomorrow,” Ginny said, laughing.  “They just want to make sure Leo’s in the clear before releasing us.”
“I don’t think it’s bravery so much as stupidity,” Harry chuckled.  “Come on.  I see Jenkins on the grounds.  He must be the Auror on duty.”
For a moment, Harry just gazed at Draco.  His platinum hair was splayed out around his head and his rose bud lips were closed.  He had certainly grown into a handsome man--manly, with a hint of feminine features, such as his fine cheek bones and slender neck.  Draco’s Adam’s apple was prominently displayed, so Harry decided he would start there.
Whistling a happy tune, with a goofy look on his face, Harry strolled into the Gryffindor common room.  A few students sniggered, but he paid them no mind.  Nothing was going to bring him down.  Not this day.
“Can I help you?”  An assistant healer approached the pair.  “Oh, Healer Potter.  What are you doing on this side of the hospital?”
“We won’t.  But Audrey’s healer recommended she not apparate while pregnant. So we use muggle transport nowadays.  It takes so much longer.”
Wiping his eyes, he gathered the book, a photograph, and a flowering plant Harry had given him.  He couldn’t bear to look at the thing and decided to return it.  He slowly made his way down to Harry’s room.  Surely, Harry would have returned to Hogwarts by nine o’clock on a Sunday evening.
“No,” Draco protested.  “I mean, I was upset. I probably had it coming though.  Especially considering what I was planning to do.”
Harry gave a quick nod and walked out of the holding room.  The worried look on Draco’s face prompted a hug.
Cyril, the burly man, gestured for them to follow.  The three of them walked down the dull hallway, heels clicking at various paces.  At one point, all three walked in time with one another, but only briefly.  Draco wondered why he found that so amusing.  It was merely something to distract him from his first meeting with his father since he began dating Harry.  He’d never been supportive of Draco dating men in general.  But he did seem to tolerate it, in order to maintain a relationship with him.
Ron hesitated to speak his mind.  “It’s stupid.” Harry said nothing, waiting.  “I’ve been in love with Hermione forever.  And I know we’ve only been officially together for the past six months.  But every time I turn around, there’s somebody else hooking up.  Ginny’s having some sort of shot gun wedding and apparently even you and Malfoy are all but married.”
Draco brushed past him as he walked in.  “Then this is going to be one quick reunion,” he joked.  “I haven’t wanked in two.”
“What?  Why would you think that?”  Harry was always shocked at Hermione’s insight.  He shouldn’t be after all this time, but he still was.
Trying his hardest not to laugh at Harry’s naïveté, Draco smiled.  “The term is bottom.  And I would
“I don’t know,” Harry shrugged.  “Probably.  I talked to Dudley a couple of years ago and told him.  Once he moved out of his parents’ home, he changed a little.  He is my cousin, after all, so I’ve made attempts to stay in touch with him over the years.”
Poppy the House Elf appeared before Harry and Draco, bowing slightly.  “Masters, the Welcome Witch at the hospital called.”
Blaise lifted his head, his brow deeply furrowed.  “You think I haven’t thought of that?”  He laughed mirthlessly.  “I’ve considered asking her for an arrangement, an open marriage.  She could have any bloke she wants, and I could have . . . but it wouldn’t be fair to, uh, our outside partners, I suppose.”
Stealthily moving into the room, Harry walked around the bed to the right side. He watched Draco for a moment, then, feeling a bit like a stalker, decided it would be better to wait until morning to talk to him.
Draco quirked an eyebrow. “In a hurry to get somewhere?” As if he didn’t know. Finally getting Harry into his bedroom had been on his mind since the moment the Healer declared him fit. “So am I.”
“I told you, he’s harmless.  And we have to work together.” 	“Yeah, that’s what I thought about Dorian Brewster,” Ron coughed.  “You know her?”
Pouting, Draco relented. “Oh, all right.  I’ll go.  But only if they all know I’m coming.  The last thing I need is one of them to hex me to Hell because they don’t know I’m with you.”
“I can’t miss the wedding.  It’ll only be another couple hours,” Harry pleaded.  “Stay with me.  You’ll be in trouble anyway if McGonagall catches you.  You may as well stay.” Harry looked at him over the rim of his glasses.  “Please?”
He found Pansy sitting in the common room studying.  Draco did a double take, then took a moment to observe her.  He had never seen such a studious expression on her face.  Perhaps she was taking his previous advice to heart.  He approached Pansy carefully so as not to startle her.
“I don’t know, Malfoy, the Gryffindor Seeker is pretty quick.  I saw her practicing the other day.  My money-- er, if I was to bet, which I never would, is on Gryffindor.”
“Are you . . . are you going to let me touch you?” Draco breathed shakily.  The anticipation was tightening his belly and he was becoming aroused just thinking about doing wicked things to Harry.
As he looked down, he noticed a small amount of diluted blood and swallowed hard.  “Tracey?  Just because you’ve popped, doesn’t mean we have to do this.”
“I mean, mine alone,” Draco explained.  “My parents signed it over to me.  My mother, willingly.  My father was coerced, by my mother.”  The corner of his mouth rose at the thought of his mother getting the best of Lucius.
Draco closed his eyes and willed himself to relax.  Although he wanted this, it had been quite a while since he’d bottomed and he was anxious.  He groaned as the head of Harry’s cock slipped past his opening.
“Blush and mauve,” Draco smirked.  “Come on,” he said as he finished stripping.  “I think you’ll like the bathroom better.”
“And you’re already picking a fight,” Draco sighed heavily.  “Forget I said that.  I just don’t want to fight with anyone anymore.”  He glanced at the clock on the mantle.  “It’s late.  I’m tired and I’m going to sleep.”
Harry glanced at the chess set on a small table in the corner.  “Do you play?”  Draco nodded.  “Why don’t we play a game to pass the time, and I’ll answer your question,” Harry suggested.
Draco snorted.  At first, he stood his ground, scowling at Knox.  But a nudge from Harry attracted his attention.
“Man?  Only my long time regulars know, er, knew.  I suppose a lot of them know now,” Mel laughed and looked around.  “People see what they want to see.  Or rather, they don’t see what they don’t want to see.”
When he looked up to recite his own vows, Draco’s bottom lip was quivering, and tears were streaming down his face.  He reached out and wiped away what he could, cupping Draco’s cheek afterward.
“Pathetic isn’t the word I would use.  Perhaps, frustrating.  But Harry, there are no babies within kilometers of Hogwarts.”
“Not more important.  More needy.  He worried about you.  But the house elves were there to take care of your needs and he thought you would be fine.”
Neville paled a bit when Pansy chose his wand.  And Ginny looked disappointed to be paired with Blaise, especially because he was the Chooser.  She had a feeling she would be suffering the consequences for the following week.
“I don’t know Draco’s mother well, but I’ve watched her enough to know she’s a woman of purpose.  She’s always carried herself just so.  Even through the trials.  She certainly never struck me as clumsy.”
Pansy sat down on the sofa on the other side of Draco from Harry. “We were planning to have a small Slytherin get together tonight.  But we can make it a coming out party instead,” she bounced.
“You’re not going to leave me alone until I write it, are you?” he spoke to the journal.  He briefly wondered if it was a sign of madness to talk to inanimate objects.
Wyndam returned with parchment and quill in hand. He sat down with Harry going over details of their arrangement, while Rita began a list of questions to ask Harry.
A mediwitch brought a portable cot and placed the babies side by side to wheel them into the nursery to stay with the other babies born recently.
Professor McGonagall had assured each and every parent that the school had been repaired and restored to its former glory-save for the Room of Requirement.  The remaining Death Eaters, who had not perished or been sent to Azkaban, were in the process of being hunted down by the Aurors.  Their children were safe.  Yet, even the students could see the anxiety in their parents’ faces.  They would not be relieved until they received word of their children’s safe arrival.
Harry chuckled.  “Yeah, I was an outlaw.  I wanted to have my whole face covered and that was the only thing I could think of.  So, you knew it was Draco with the blue hair?”
Harry wrapped his hand around the back of Draco’s head and pulled him forward, crushing his lips just a bit too hard.  They snogged feverishly, then slowed to a more leisurely pace, sucking and licking at one another’s mouths.  The whole while, Harry was still in disbelief that his fantasy had come to fruition.
“Potter, will you please stop doting on me?” Draco said the words but, secretly, he was enjoying the attention.
“Yeah, fuck you too,” Draco said as he walked out of the dormitory and made his way to the Potions classroom.
“What are friends for?” Blaise grinned.  He enjoyed seeing Draco squirm.  It didn’t happen very often.  “Shoot.”
“What if it doesn’t sound safe to me.  Do I get a say, or are you two just going to go ahead without me?”
Pansy looked around to see if anyone else was coming.  It was two minutes before ten. She decided no one else was going to show up and started to walk inside.
“I’m sure the house elves would happy to serve you,” Minerva said.  Harry got the impression that the Headmistress was displeased.
As luck would have it, Draco was standing right next to the refreshments.  His eyes scanned Harry up and down.
A Healer’s assistant walked Harry back to a private room and instructed him to remove his shirt, trousers and shoes.
Draco went back to his quarters, disappointed that Harry wouldn’t be there.  But he and his friends would be arriving later with food.  When Draco got back, he picked up a green apple from his fruit bowl to tide him over until supper.  It was then that he noticed the book of parchment on the side table next to the novel Harry brought.
“All right,” Draco relented.   He acted as though he was doing Harry a favor, but truthfully, he was glad.  His mother had made light of the situation, however, in the back of Draco’s mind, he had doubts.
Having wasted the previous day moping around, Harry woke up Friday morning feeling a bit more optimistic.  He had a plan to figure things out logically.
Seeing the expression on Harry’s face, Draco joined the discussion.  “Yes, I was telling her about how you invited me to speak to your DADA classes.”
“Oh, yes,” she replied.  “But there are so many other things I could be doing.  I was trying to remember if I watered my plants this morning.”
“I don’t know.  You looked unsure for a moment.”  Harry bit his lip.  “I was only kidding about the nude beach.  Sort of.  I mean, I’d definitely go to one.  But if you’re uncomfortable . . .”
Draco sighed heavily as he lay with Harry, spent, sweaty and covered in cum and lube. He had woken up early and decided to take advantage of his morning wood.  Harry didn’t seem to mind in the least.
“I’m not sure if it’s appropriate,” Draco glanced at his father, who nodded.  “I was thinking that it might be . . . cathartic, for all of us, if we publicly acknowledged . . . my sister.”
“Don’t blame him, son.  You two must have had a very strong connection to begin with.  Your magic responded and completed the bond.  I think the pain was only the resistance of the residual dark magic.  It’s not his fault.”
“It sounds like a lovely trip,” Minerva said.  “Travel safely. I must get a little more work done tonight before I begin my relaxing weekend.  If you’ll excuse me.”  She stood and bowed her head slightly before leaving the Great Hall.
“I don’t want you to really tell me!” Hermione yelled at him.  She got up and left, having eaten only half her breakfast.
“Pansy learned more about it over Christmas break.  It seems that the magic controlled more than just the hours of the party.”
“Nothing I suppose.  But is that what you want?  Or is it what you think people expect of you?” Draco swallowed more firewhiskey.
to tell you,” Harry said ominously.  He ran a hand through his hair and rubbed his eyes under his glasses. “I knew about Ginny before you told me.  I overheard her and Dean talking on Christmas.”  He looked Ron in the eye.  “It could be mine.”
He glanced at the door just down the hall several times.  He couldn’t bear the thought that perhaps Harry had gone to Knox’s room after leaving him the night before.  Draco was thankful that the prat didn’t come out of his room to boast. Then he remembered that Knox had detention duty that weekend and was probably somewhere in the castle making students do some mundane chore or another.
“It’s not,” Ginny said.  “Ours was so quick, we didn’t get to have all the lovely extras.  And it was so small.  Take the time to plan it right.  It should be the happiest day of your lives.”
“You’re not unkempt.  You’re . . . carefree.” Draco bit his lip. “I like that about you.  Most people consider me too fussy.”
Rummaging through Harper’s things, Blaise missed the look Draco gave him and ignored his comment. “Here, put this on, Harry.”
Malfoy slowly turned back and began walking in the direction of the car he was sharing with Pansy and Blaise.  Harry was left pondering his answer.  Perhaps Malfoy meant what he said.  His heart had never truly been in the Dark Arts.  Perhaps he had followed in his Snape’s footsteps rather than his own father’s.  Harry waved off the questions the others had about his conversation with Draco.  For some reason, we wanted to keep his exchange with Draco to himself.
“You’d better get yourself to Ollivander’s straightaway then,” Hermione suggested. “I heard he’s retiring very soon and passing the business along to his apprentice.”
She was right, statistically speaking.  Harry hadn’t thought of that.  He wondered if it wasn’t the game after all.  Perhaps Pansy had been wrong about that.
Ginny shook her head and laughed. “Come on.  If this is a no snogging zone, we need to get the hell out.”  She pulled Dean by his tie into her bedroom.
Nearly pushing Harry off and on to the floor, Draco sat up.  “I’m glad my insecurities amuse you,” he pouted.
Draco pouted.  “I was hoping we could stay in all day and maybe get some supper from the house elves.”
Slowly, chatter began to fill the pub again.  The foursome didn’t have to guess what the topic of most conversations would be.
He continued to clean Harry, opting to use his fingers rather than the flannel for his hair.  He leaned forward and around Harry again for the soap, this time making sure there was full body contact.
Draco leaned down, close to Harry’s ear.  “Maybe you ought to give it to them. The one about Liam and Drake has plenty of action.”
“You’ve been taking a bit of time off, Harry. You know how rumors start,” Ron said. “I had to set the record straight.”
“Does that mean the first person you were in love with, or the first person to fall in love with you?” Ron questioned.  “You gonna eat that?”  He indicated the cookie.
She left him standing in the corridor, alone and in the dark.  Deep down, he knew she was right.  Malfoy was under his skin.  He just didn’t understand in what capacity.  Was it the reason he and Cho didn’t work out, the reason he and Ginny didn’t work out?  The reason that, despite girls clamoring for his attention, he always found himself watching Draco?  Of course, it was always under the guise of keeping an eye on him, to keep him from wrong doings.
Blaise grinned widely.  “Oh, personal cleansing.  Yeah, I’ve got one or two good ones.  Really thorough, if you know what I mean.  Harry Potter’s arse will be fresh as a daisy, and taste like sweet cream,” he sniggered.
Hermione giggled while Ron’s eyes grew big.  He was still not completely comfortable with Harry and Draco’s innuendo and displays of affection.
For a brief moment, Harry imagined this same scenario, but with their own child. His heart suddenly ached for something he was never sure he wanted in the first place. The moment was ruined when Victoire ran into the room screaming about wanting more cream on her pie. Fleur followed closely behind, scolding her.
With a confidence rarely displayed, Ron replied, “Your answer is yes.”  He finished slipping the ring on and stood back up.  “I love you.”
“Your father and I did plan to have more children.  In fact, you were about to become an older brother when I fell ill.”  She reached out her hand to him.  “I’ll tell you the whole story.”
So certain that this was the right thing to do before, Harry now stood with a stack of folded shirts in his hand, feeling a bit like an outsider.
Chuckling between grunts and thrusts, Draco replied, “Considering that we fucked every few hours that weekend before I left, it has been ages.”
Waving a dismissive hand, Rita turned her attention to the former Chosen One.  “I only want the truth.”
“Of course I didn’t know it was you,” he said.  “After what you made me do at the party, I wouldn’t have gone anywhere near you.”
Harry was on his sofa with someone else.  And they were snogging heavily.  Harry’s body was obscuring their vision of the other person as he was in a superior position.
“Oh, Harry, I’m so glad you came.  It’s been so long since you’ve come to a family meal.” She hugged him tightly.
“Just see the Welcome Witch about a schedule.  She’d be happy to help you,” Cummins said, pleased at the thought that Harry Potter may one day join his staff.
The former Death Eater shook his head.  “Just that he’s near.”  He looked up the staircase.  “We may as well go up and look.”
They made small talk, very small talk, for a couple of minutes.  But Harry gathered up the nerve to address with Tracey the only thing he really had on his mind.
This time Harry leaned up to meet Draco’s lips and they shared their first kiss after both declaring their love.
“I don’t care.”  Taking a step forward, Harry didn’t let Draco get away the second time.  His hands held Draco’s head in place while he gently kissed lips parted in surprise.  When Harry pulled back, he grinned.  “I’m out.”
“I know.  I wasn’t expecting it to happen so soon.”  Harry stood and pointed at the bottom of the parchment. “And look, they want to make it a series.”
Harry chuckled. “No.  I genuinely do.  I know I agreed to doing it, because, well, one of us had to give in.  Then I had this daft idea.”
“It’s done.  I’m over it,” Draco told him.  “I didn’t want you thinking that I really was plotting revenge.  Especially after you told me about those dreams.  Have you had any more?”
“No, it’s not your fault,” Draco sighed.  “If I had protested more about those articles Skeeter wrote years ago about me, this wouldn’t have been such a big deal now.  At the time, I figured it would all blow over and be forgotten.  And, you know, too much denial only makes a person look more guilty.”
.”  Harry felt his answer was honest, but he also felt compelled to elaborate further. “And, I want to experience other relationships, with other sorts of people.”  It seemed a struggle for Harry to put it into words that were honest, yet somewhat general.
“Oh, you haven’t ruined anything.  The evening is not over, as far as I’m concerned,” Draco grinned.
“I should think that, if anything, you would have clung tighter to what you had left,” Draco said. “But you left the house elves to deal with me.  And I never even understood why.”
Jenkins saw him and hesitated.  “Well, I suppose you have a right to know.  Malfoy finally signed the deal.  He’s going to spill the beans tomorrow morning at half-nine.”
“But I’m the one who’s not teaching right now.  McGonagall gave me leave so I could take care of the babies.”
Laughing, Harry tried to calm the redhead down.  “Ron, wait.  Draco isn’t doing anything but playing a prank on you.”
He leaned back against the window frame and fully unzipped his trousers.  Taking his hardened cock all the way out, he groaned loudly, now that he didn’t care.  He swiftly massaged himself, closing his eyes and panting in short breaths.
“I am being civil,” Harry told her.  “Believe me, that answer is toned down.” He addressed Duchess.  “Write it down.”
Like before, Draco kept the buss sweet and gentle.  But he chanced a small sweep of his tongue along Harry’s bottom lip. He sensed Harry’s uncertainty and didn’t want to scare him off. Draco was relieved when the Gryffindor’s own tongue reciprocated lightly.  The pair relaxed into the kiss for a few moments, then parted.
“I suppose you’re right.  There’s no point getting worked up about it now.  We’ve got careers to worry about first.”  Draco leaned up and kissed Harry.  “I’m sorry for getting upset about something you haven’t even done yet,” he chuckled.
“Maybe for a little while,” the Gryffindor sheepishly answered.  “Until I get a bit more comfortable.  I mean, I’m still sort of awkward about all of this with Hermione and Ron.  You understand, don’t you?”
Harry gave him a wink as the ride began to lurch forward in jerky movements. “How many times do I have to correct you?  It’s Potter-Malfoy.  And after this, you can have anything you want.”
Hermione wandered into the common room to find Harry fast asleep on the couch.  Though students were milling about, he didn’t stir until she gently tapped him on the shoulder.  He groaned and rolled away from her.
Pissed off more at himself than either of the men next door, he wanked himself into a frenzy, cumming nearly at the same time as Draco.
Suddenly, the crowd invaded Draco’s ears.  He hadn’t realized that they were muffled while the glamour was in effect.  He glanced around at the people nearby. None were giving him or Harry suspicious looks, and he finally began to relax.
Draco noticed what Harry had done and casually dropped his hand to his lap, then slid it off and onto the bench next to Harry’s.  Harry responded by inching his hand over until it was touching Draco’s.  He felt the warmth in his chest, wishing the pair of them were alone.  Draco then boldly moved his hand over top of the other.  Hearts pounding on the inside, neither looked at the other, and from the view above the table, no one would have known they were interacting at all.  To the casual observer, they were simply a couple of coworkers sitting next to one another, having a quick drink and watching over their students.
Swiftly entering the house, the Slytherin tiptoed toward the kitchen.  Ron was standing in front of the sink with his back to Draco.  Hermione was speaking somewhere out of Draco’s sight.
“It wasn’t hers to tell,” Harry interrupted.  “It’s my fault.  And you’re right, Ron.  I shouldn’t keep things from you, ever.  Are we okay?”
Arriving on time at the Prophet offices, Harry came prepared with answers to Rita Skeeter’s questions.  She would be allowed to ask a query, then one follow up after Harry had answered.  Though the original questions were written down, the follow-ups couldn’t be anticipated because they depended on the answers Harry gave.  He’d had the foresight to reserve the right to not answer those questions.
“I love you too.”  The words that were once foreign and unsettling to him were now liberating.  Thanks to Harry, he was no longer afraid to show his vulnerability.
Hermione asked one of the third years to go to the kitchens to get ice for Harry, while Draco and Ron helped him up the stairs to his room.  Ron looked away and shifted uncomfortably on his feet as Draco began to unbutton Harry’s jeans.
“What do you want me to say, Harry?  Do you want me to try and talk you out of it?  You want me to yell at you?  Or tell you I’m shocked and disgusted?  Or maybe you were thinking I was just going to walk away and not talk to you at all.”
“And what better way to make sure Severus’ name goes down in history than to have his brilliance in print for all to read?”
Draco continued to loop the tie through itself.  “No.  You were right to do that.  Otherwise the whole evening would be all about us.  This way, it’ll only be all about
Good, he thought to himself.  I hope whoever it is figures out what’s in Harry’s hair and realizes they’re interrupting two weeks worth of shagging in two days.
“The Aurors often trade for information.  Sometimes, it’s the only way to get the information we need.  Or rather, they need,” Harry said, correcting himself.  Sometimes he still got caught up in Auror business.  “If it gets more Death Eaters into Azkaban, then I’m all for it.”
“Don’t speak. You can tell me later, when you’ve recovered.” Harry wasn’t about to let him say his goodbyes. That was as good as giving up. He wasn’t going to give up and he wasn’t going to allow Draco to either. He continued to breathe on Draco’s hands, satisfied that he had gotten his way.
“I don’t think so,” Harry answered.  He rolled his neck from side to side, hunched his shoulders and straightened and bent his legs.  It was actually the first he took the time to check himself.  “No.”
Harry chuckled, “Well, you know, I don’t like to take advantage of my fame. It was your team’s moment. I saw the article in the Prophet. Wicked photo of your hit.”
They wasted no time trying to rid one another of clothing.  Halfway through disrobing, they fell back into snogging and groping. Draco’s hand snaked its way into Harry’s unzipped jeans to find a cock of granite.
“I still like you too.”  Ginny wrapped her arms around Dean’s neck and pulled him closer.  They kissed and slowly sank down onto the bed until they were lying down, legs entangled, bodies pressed closely together.
“I should at least brush my teeth,” the Slytherin made a face.  “They’re fuzzy, and I have sausage breath.”
With brows furrowed, Draco nodded.  “Of course.  But . . .”  He had the feeling that wasn’t the true reason for Harry’s visit. He let it go nonetheless.
“Us as well,” Harry said.  “Perhaps this would be a good opportunity for the Houses to mingle,” he suggested.
“Knew,” Draco said.  “He’s my father’s second cousin or something like that.  Or is it third cousin?”
Draco looked up at Harry, who maintained the illusion of copying his work.  Deciding it was nothing, Draco set back to his task.  He wanted to finish their essay that night, so they could begin making their potion on Tuesday.
When the door opened, Draco stood, looking somewhat surprised, with his shirt completely unbuttoned and feet bare.
“Never again,” Harry replied.  Draco settled down on top of Harry and rested his chin on Harry’s chest.  Harry wrapped his arms around his lover and clasped his hands, keeping him in place.
They were dancing, more or less ball room style, but quickly, to keep up with the beat of the music.  Parvati was spun and twirled and dipped.  Her partner seemed to be making it all up on the spot.  And perhaps he wasn’t the finest dancer, but she was having fun.  Padma and Romilda watched the pair as they drank pumpkin punch.
Harry clutched onto Draco’s hand as they walked the hall toward Gryffindor.  He couldn’t imagine things going more perfectly than they were.
“A word that sets you off.  And you won’t know what the word is until it happens. It would be something like wand, potion or spell, for example,” Pansy grinned.  “I came up with that one.”
They sat in silence. Draco knew he was being unreasonable, asking Harry to stay away from Knox completely.
“Too bad heterosexuals don’t have to come out and announce that they’d like to have sex with the opposite gender,” Draco commented.
“Thought you wanted everyone to know who I belong to.” Draco lifted a finger to Harry’s lips and gently stroked them, licking his own as he did.
.  That never happens.” Ron smiled.  “You almost gave it away yesterday morning.  I just about had you with that minger comment.”
Draco walked into the quarters he shared with Harry, loosening his tie and plopping himself down on the sofa.
In the new position, Draco’s cock sat deeper into Harry and the Gryffindor enjoyed having more control.  He leaned back a bit.  Partly to see more of Draco, partly to get Draco’s cock to rub against his insides just the way he liked.  In time, Harry would teach Draco precisely what would bring him the most pleasure.  But for their first time together, Harry took it upon himself to hit that sweet spot.
He told her the story-- of Greyback’s attack, how they lost their wands, searching the kitchen for anything that might help.  Reluctantly, Harry explained the state of Draco’s dress when she and Lucius found them.
Food arrived at the table and the conversation slowed while the four companions ate. Ron, who finished eating first, restarted the conversation.
“I’m not.  I’m sorry, but they’re hardly noticeable.  I would have missed this one completely, except I felt it when I put my hand in your shirt that first night we kissed.”
“That’s an understatement,” Draco snickered.  “Two years ago Pansy was still setting me up with pretty boys and you weren’t even out yet. And now look at us, about to be parents.”
But if it had been, the part where he got to kiss his date was getting close.  The butterflies were churning as he walked up the staircase next to Draco.  Harry’s quarters were coming up first and he was trying to think of an excuse to invite him inside.
Without looking in her direction, Harry addressed her. “Why don’t you just come out and ask me what you want to know.”
Ron scowled.  “Yeah, once she knew who I was.  Before that, she barely glanced my way while she was talking about this bracelet.”
“That’s not what Dean meant,” she said using the most gentle tone she could, she tried to explain.  “It’s just that, you’ve gone through a lot of changes recently.  You really need time to get to know yourself better before you take on the task of raising another person.  It’s not because you’re gay.  Harry, I would never keep you away, if this is your baby.”
“Shut it Blaise,” Draco called into the room.  “What did you come to tell me?” he asked Harry gently.
“Fuck, that was amazing,” He declared, panting.  Harry lifted his head to find Draco with his head lolled to the side, groaning.
“Good.” Draco smiled as well.  “If you could do this in class, we wouldn’t have to keep coming to the lab after hours.  This is my time too, you know.”
Like deer in headlights, neither Parvati nor Michael made a move to leave, though neither really wanted to be where they were.  The thumping of the headboard sped up.
“Harry, are you all right?” Hermione asked in a hushed voice.  “You’re all flushed,” she chuckled softly.
After hugging together while they caught their breath, the newlyweds lay in post orgasmic bliss. Harry untied the ropes, freeing Draco’s hands. Once flaccid, Draco easily slipped off the ring and handed it to Harry.
Unable to help himself, Draco pumped away, pounding into Harry with each thrust.  He wanted to cum quickly.  He needed to cum quickly, he’d been so thoroughly turned on by Harry’s acquiescence.  Rita Skeeter may have made up those tales of his sexual escapades.  But damn, if she wasn’t onto something.
Harry smiled to himself as he noticed Professor Trelawney bobbing up and down slightly to the beat of the music at the other end of the table.  He picked up a cup of punch and brought it to her.
“Great, maybe I can play with you sometime,” Draco grinned.  “I mean, chess.  I don’t really want to play with
Harry laughed at Draco’s directness.  He liked it.  “I’d have to say that depends on how the date went.”
“Back when I thought my life was going to be that of an ordinary pureblood, and I would be doing all the things that were expected of me,” he replied.  “I thought I would marry a wealthy pureblood girl, have a few children.  Perhaps get a job in the Ministry.  Those were the things I thought I would be doing, when I was too young to recognize the true nature of my life.”
“He keeps telling me that needs to pass or his father will punish him.  He’s been begging for help.”
Draco frowned.  “Oh.  I suppose Blaise and I do the same.”  He glanced around the emptying Hall.  “To tell you the truth, I don’t always know where I stand with you.”
“Don’t worry, Harry.  He’ll be fine.  Madame Pomfrey is taking good care of him.  He was down here yesterday afternoon getting in a little extra practice.  Put a bit too much pulverized hellabore into his potion.  I’m afraid when he stirred it, he breathed in the puff of vapor.”
Harry cried out loudly, gripping the headboard.  He leaned his head back into Draco.  “Merlin, that was . . .  I can’t think of a good word.”
“Night,” she replied.  She closed her eyes.  She fit so well in his arms, she thought maybe this time they could make it work.
“Tell me about it,” Harry agreed.  “I didn’t enjoy them all that much when I was a student.  What about you, Sibyll?”
Harry sighed heavily and flopped back on his bed after replying that he would meet the girl.  He didn’t want to lead the poor girl on, but Hermione left him little choice.
“Thanks Jenkins,” Harry smiled and waved, then continued to walk hand in hand with Draco to the front door of the Manor.
“I thought perhaps you’d like to put your bags in your quarters before going down to see the Potions room.”
“I don’t know,” Draco answered honestly.  “I’m confused about a lot of things right now.  And I’m not sure how to feel about any of them.”  He gave a sad smile.  “Except you. I need you more than ever.”
“Nothing.  You took that very well.  There was a time when you would have had an all out hissy fit over someone making fun of you.”
“I’m curious what sorts of characteristics the Chosen One would require in a partner,” Draco smirked.
Draco pinched at Harry’s nipple as he pounded into him from behind, over and over so hard that Harry almost lost his balance.  His other hand tugged roughly at Harry’s cock.  A sticky layer of sweat covered both their bodies, adding to the smell of sex filling the room.  They’d been at it for what seemed like days.
The headboard banged against the wall, keeping time with Harry’s thrusts. Each one ending in a pointed grunt.  Draco, still not quite used to being bottom, whimpered and moaned as Harry raked his prostate. His hands were bound with a soft velveteen rope he’d transfigured from the ones Harry produced from his wand, while his ankles rested on Harry’s shoulders.  Normally, Harry enjoyed submitting. But when Draco offered to change positions, Harry carefully tied his hands above his head.
Just before he reached the entrance, Madam Pince called out.  “Professor Malfoy, next time, speak to me in my left ear.  Unless, of course, you wish to say something truly vulgar.  Then make sure it’s the other one.  Otherwise, I may own your entire personal library.”
Harry looked down at the binding. Skinny strips of parchment were sticking out on all sides from the many pages inside.
Almost as if taken by surprise, Draco gasped loudly when he came.  He continued to pump into Harry through load after load, until he was completely spent.
After that, he was much more selective in the company he kept, so he understood Harry’s preference for muggle men.   He wasn’t worried about Harry, however.  He had much more to lose than Draco if their relationship made the front page.
“Harry, they’ll find a way to get around a contract.  They’ve done it before.  To my mother.  Please, just let it go.”
“I told you, I’m taking a witness into custody.  A witness I hope that, for your sake, doesn’t turn into a suspect.”
Since Harry was already seated next to Draco, he thought it would be odd if he moved to his usual place.  The other professors took the two seats to Harry’s right without interrupting their conversation.
Ignoring Draco’s innuendo, but smiling, Harry said, “The caretakers mentioned something about a city with a casino not too far.”
Draco snorted. “If she admitted to lying about those couple of things, she’s probably lied about more.  For all we know, she could be a serial killer.”
Nodding and smiling, Harry answered, “Yes.  I’m sure. I’ll owl Hermione and tell her they’ll have to take a raincheck.”
Looking at Harry while answering her, Draco said, “I think we’ll have a more private celebration if you don’t mind.”  He balled up the napkin with the remaining food and grabbed Harry’s hand.  Dragging Harry with him as he threw the napkin in the trash, Draco made a point to walk past Blaise.
“Everyone else has to look at your eyes through those.  I’m the only one who gets to really see them as they are now,” Draco explained. “I think you’re very handsome.” Draco whispered and leaned down to kiss Harry, “Beautiful, even. Believe that.”
“He said that to you?”  Harry’s mouth was drawn tight. He stood and walked to the door. “He’s wrong.”
“You can best help him by not getting involved at all,” Draco said. “Clearly, he’s trying to get over you by leaving.  Let him leave.”
He leaned over and nibbled at her breast, flicking his tongue over her nipple.  It sent her straight over the edge.
Harry shrugged. “I told him what I thought he wanted to hear.  And I suppose I have to live with my decision.  Maybe we’ll get a puppy,” he laughed.
“Sit down,” she instructed him.  “You haven’t even had a biscuit.  And I had Clara make your favorites.”
“You seem to have become friendly with Professor Malfoy, Harry.  Do you find him mysterious?” asked Trelawney.
Draco sent his own searing glare.  “My mother has come ‘round.  And I don’t care what my father thinks.”
“No, she went back on her word.  We woke up shortly before eight o’clock.” Romilda crossed her arms over her chest roughly.  “She wanted me to kiss her.  I only had a minute or two to decide.  I couldn’t do it. And then the spell ended.  By the time I got back to Gryffindor, this happened.”  She lifted her hair out of the way so they could get a good look at the word ‘loser’.
“Oh, that’s right,” Hermione said excitedly.  “I almost forgot about the masquerade party.  It’s Saturday night.”
“Ginny, please,” Dean smiled gently.  “I’m sorry we argued earlier.  I was being stupid.  But spending Christmas apart wasn’t the answer.  We shouldn’t spend any more time apart.  I love you.”  He opened the box, revealing a gold ring with three small diamonds. “Will you marry me?”
“Because I tried it, and it hasn’t panned out,” Harry explained. “I don’t want to advertise that I’m a failure.”
“Come on Harry.  I know you’ve always tried to downplay it to spare my feelings, but James and Lily are yours. They’re the children in your dreams.”
“No, our friend Hermione is here as well.”  Harry chuckled.  “I mean fiancée.  Ron and Hermione got engaged last weekend and we’re celebrating with some wine and Chinese take away.”
“Not here.  Are you finished eating now?” Draco impatiently asked.  “Pansy, keep Harper occupied for a bit, will you?  Maybe he can give you tips on how to put on eyeliner,” he chuckled.
“Yeah,” Knox went on.  “I don’t know if it’s going to work out.  He’s sort of clingy.  He always wants me to reassure him that I’m having a good time with him.”
“As much as I’d like to take credit, I don’t think it’s me.” Harry caught Draco just as he began to pass out. He scooped him up and carried the ailing man back to the sofa, gently placing him down.
Her expression softened slightly.  “I’m not one to believe everything Rita Skeeter prints, but I can’t control other’s reactions.”
Draco leaned back far enough to look Harry in the eye, his own eyes filled with lust---and something more. He nuzzled Harry’s neck, then nibbled at his ear.
Neville tried to suppress his smile.  “Everything, mate.  I did things I’d never done before.  Not that that’s really saying much.”
“Aurors don’t like to advertise all of the training they go through.  That glamour is especially useful during stakeouts.”
“Oh, Pansy knows.  She just doesn’t know specifically about tonight.  I’m fairly certain she told Blaise.  But he hasn’t brought it up.”
“Yes, it is,” Ginny smirked.  “And we’re going to kick your arse Friday on the potion contest.  You should have stuck with Blaise.  Harry’s not very good at potions.”
Up to that point, they could pretend it was all rather innocent.  Even the kisses.  They could be considered experimental.  A curiosity.
“Quidditch, for one.  And I’ve taken to writing.”  Harry laughed.  “It’s kind of funny.  When I was a student, I hated writing essays.  Hermione would always be on my case to get them done.  Now that I have the time, I’ve discovered that I enjoy writing.”
Jerking a thumb in Knox’s direction, Ron said, “Don’t give this one a second thought.  He’s not worth the aggravation.”
“He lied to me about something.  I suppose it was more like omitting the truth.  But he confessed.”  Harry frowned.  “I wasn’t very understanding at first.”
Ron scanned the classroom as they cleaned up.  “Is there someone in here you like?  You used to do the same thing with Cho.”
“I don’t remember saying those particular words.  But I also don’t deny saying them.  It is the sort of thing I would have said shortly after the war.  I was only nineteen when I gave the last interview.  I was a bitter and tired young man.  Though, I felt ancient.  Being an Auror seemed my only option at the time, and I embraced it fully.  I thought redemption was beyond the Death Eaters despite evidence to the contrary.  I think deep down, I wanted to punish anyone who didn’t stand up to Voldemort.  No matter which side they were on.”
Every so often, Harry would say he understood Knox’s situation.  He cited Draco’s lack of self-assurance in certain areas. He told Knox about the difficulties with Draco’s father.  Even after Harry prostrated himself before the man, he still hadn’t lived up to his end of the bargain.  Lucius hadn’t publicly acknowledged his son’s relationship with Harry or reached out to him.
The rest of the greetings were mainly hugs for Harry and nods for Draco, but it was more than he’d even hoped for.  Before supper, the family gathered in various rooms of the home catching up on news and gossip.  Harry and Draco were the subject of much of it.  Harry noticed a conspicuous lack of conversation whenever he and Draco entered a new room.
Draco laughed. “Collecting nude art was somewhat of a hobby in my post- Hogwarts years, before I became serious about a career and moved out.”
Harry stood and began to redress himself.  Feeling extremely self-conscious, Draco put on his trousers as well.
Harry shook his head.  “Eventually?  After I’d missed all the important stuff?  I understand what you’re thinking.  I understand that you even think you were doing the right thing for me.  But it isn’t.  I was raised by people other than my parents.  I’m not about to let my own children go through that.  It’s not a reflection on you, but I can’t do it.”
“It is.  She’s just being dramatic.  But the date is set in stone. April tenth.”  He stared at Harry uneasily.
“Because . . . it’s full of muggles with children. And we are not children anymore. I want to take you to see museums and operas. Places with beautiful landscapes. I know a lodge in the Alps that has a hot tub overlooking a snowy mountain. I’ve thought of making love to you there since our first kiss.”
“Twenty-five Galleons for a used bracelet?” Ron questioned.  It was a lot of money to spend on one gift. Even if it was for his girl.  He turned to Harry.  “Do you think Hermione will
“What!  You fucking what?  You and Malfoy.  You’re like fucking married or something?  Harry, you can’t undo that.  What the fuck were you thinking?”
Ron gave a sideways glance to Hermione.  “I suppose that’s one of the perks of being with a bloke, eh.”
“Upon his birth.  It was held in trust until his eighteenth birthday, when he gained sole control over it.”
“We both do,” Harry said. He leaned forward and kissed Draco, quickly building to a fevered pace. “So, about those ropes . . .”
Harry made his way to Draco and gently took the quill out of his hand.  He shook his head.  “This isn’t right.  Not for
Hermione smiled as well.  “That dream doesn’t sound so bad.  What are the children doing in the dream?”
For weeks now, Harry had been having dreams in which Draco told Blaise he was setting Harry up for a fall.  Harry hadn’t said anything to anyone, especially not Draco.  He couldn’t help wonder if the dreams were a reflection on himself or his secret suitor.
“I didn’t mean to worry you.  It’s probably nothing.”  He paused.  “Let me talk to Ron, just in case.”
In all, nine students stood amongst their classmates.  Some, well known for their sexual orientation, some acknowledging for the first time publicly.
They arrived within the grand hall of Malfoy Manor, looking much the same as it did when the Dark Lord had taken it over.  It was dank and gloomy, and eerily silent.  Harry removed the cloak, folded it and placed it on a chair by the staircase.  He wanted to put it somewhere he’d be able to find it when they completed their mission.  Well, his mission.  Draco was there, primarily to redeem himself and to earn a position in the Ministry.
“I see nothing to prove your claim Mr. Malfoy,” the Wizengamot member said. “Do you have anything to add?”
“It’ll be nice when we can finally just spend the night together like Blaise and Harper,” Draco commented.  “Not that I’m trying to pressure you.  But have you given any more thought as to how you’re going to come out?  Or when?”
“Time for you to head back to Slytherin.”  Draco smiled.  “But it was awfully Gryffindor of you to gather the nerve to ask her out.”
“We had a late lunch.  How can you be hungry?” Harry asked in disbelief.  “You’re always hungry.  Why are you always hungry?”
Taking her attention from Ron, the girl reached in and pulled out a small pin.  It was Celtic love knot in gold and silver colors.  The intricate pattern was unlike Harry had ever seen.  It was masculine and delicate at the same time.  Not unlike Draco.
“Ah, I’m gonna cum even with this thing on,” Draco hissed.  He bit down on Harry’s shoulder as he came, as intensely as he ever had, continuing to thrust inside Harry’s arse.  When Draco was finally spent, he lay on top of Harry.  Harry’s knees gave out and the pair of them collapsed onto the satin covered bed.
