He would of felt a tad smug at doing that to the Dark Lords corpse but only if he was alive to feel that wound, he walked towards the bed to pick up Harry but Snape stood in his way.
Sorry for the short chapter but how do you guy's feel it is progressing?
"Yes Mrs Malfoy, you are quite correct though I wanted him to stew and figure me out himself, do you mind if I court your son? My instincts demand it of me but I am still somewhat human in mind too" Harry asks in response, eyes never wavering as the dawning realization hits Draco like a ton of bricks making him shake slightly in open wonderment.
"A recent homeowner present beside the famous Harry Potter's muggle residence, namely Squib Ms Arabella Figg (41), alerted the Auror's of a disturbance within the neighbourhood of Little Whinging, Surrey at the early hours of 9am this morning."
Fawkes nipped his fingers affectionately before withdrawing to carry out his masters orders, he disappeared in a flash of flame to find wherever his masters quarry lay hiding.
Spells to note:
Albus conceded a nod at the observation "This is true my boy however is Remus available? I do not mind keeping the boy company until Sirius can contact and being Remus to the castle, then I am afraid I will do as you suggest as I have been wilfully negligent of letters the board of governors have been hounding me with, until then give me Harry and Severus you can go back to your potions lessons, as I understand it you had your N.E.W.T students this morning, I am sorry for keeping you so long".
~A goodd pointss my sssweet I believe he isss telling what he knowss to be true, however he doesss not posssesss the sskillss or magical sstrength to casst the charm, I will need to be careful on thiss excursion dessspite it being certain victory the old fool will not bessst me~ Voldemort replied thoughtfully.
It didn't take long before a bright flash of green flame enveloped the tense atmosphere between Remus and Albus, drawing their calculative gazes towards the new occupants now appearing in the headmasters study.
It forced Voldemort to throw up a simple shield spell to dodge his welcoming parties attack, his cruel laughter could be heard over the static charge quite clearly "Thisss isss preciousss a mere houssee elf challengesss I to a duel? You have made your grave little elf Avada Kedavra!" Green light broke through his shield and hit the elf in the face as it toppled to the floor in a blank lifeless stare in front of a sobbing parent and child.
He hoped his love was just asleep having cried herself into a coma rather than heartbreaking alternative, he couldn't rely on his Dark Lords mercy for mudbloods however so with mounting dread, he began climbing the creaking stairs towards the second floor with his wand aloft ready to fight if need be, he made sure he at least carried all the healing potions as usual so if she just lay sleeping or slightly wounded be could save her 'If the brat lives I hope he bit her if her condition is worse than I fear it is so I will have enough time to fix the damage' he thought desperately as he neared the room at the end of the upstairs hall that lay open with a foul smell wafting over him from inside.
Vita Sanguinem Praesidium - Life Essence Protection
"If it isn't Mrs Kettleburn of Familial Affairs, what brings you to me? Is there a creature child missing or orphaned that you need my specialist opinion on? or is it some dangerous house hold pet that someone is attempting to claim as a familiar?" He enquired softly to her, Sonia blinked rapidly in slight astonishment at his kind tone before replying "Mr Diggle you are correct I am here to ask you to accompany me to my office over a matter of a dark creature child who's current guardian is wishing to change Sire's".
Confirma Sanguinem - Blood Strengthen
To Hate Severus Snape,
"Thank you and Good Day, remember to submit your wands for inspection at the Security Desk at the end of the Atrium" the voice stated as their appropriate badges dispensed through the change dispenser, his reading 'Sirius Black, Ministry Interrogation Liason and Familial Affairs Consultation', Pettigrew's 'Attending Interrogation' however just then, before the booth could rumble and descend into the bowls of the earth towards the ministry of magic, a hand shot through the paneless windows and grabbed the cage pulling it out of Sirius's grasp to land loudly with a thud on the floor, Sirius attempted to spin around to fire a spell at the attacker but was too late, he landed on his front under a full body bind, the assailant picked up the cage that had fallen and before he could fight the body bind off or the entrance could prevent its' descent, the person disapperated with crack leaving a very angry Sirius lying there in wake of the assault.
Albus Dumbledore eagerly retreated back to his study after his brief farewell to Madam Pomfrey and Severus in the hospital wing.
~~Draco Pov, Floren Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlor, Diagon Alley~~
A short note appeared this time:
The others watched closely in trepidation especially Osiris who's freedom hinged on Harry completing his task, the fight was actually only arduous due to the lingering danger of the venom and the Hydra's triple elemental breath though, the Dragon didn't manage to put up much of a fight before being absorbed, The Hydra restored its strength at and even pace with being sapped so it ended up more a battle of wills wheras the Basillisk was only a threat until it lost its stamina.
"Well Harry I believe I should formally welcome you into the family despite what Lucius may say about it, I will not deny my son the chance of happiness, will you guarantee all his needs are met son?"
The unlikely trio arrive at Hogwarts, it's time for some answers!
"Harry is in danger Remi if not by Albus then maybe Voldemort, I fear he might have came into his inheritance and it might end up a shock for us rather than how it ended up for James and Lily, you remember how powerful they ended up being instead of the small power boost a wizard normally earns, maybe their mix unlocked his creature blood line, only a pure blood would have those dormant Gene's maybe Lily mixing was enough to activate it?" Sirius added with a touch of fear in his voice.
The Order learns of the Headmasters evil plans for Harry, Snape is sent to try and bring Harry back to the light side, Harry accepts some new found sexual comfort in the form of Blaise and his new mate Draco.
He spelled the memo to fly out of the room before standing up and gesturing Sonia to the door, his lax expression was putting her on edge 'it really shouldn't of been that easy' she thought, determined not to show her unease however, she quickly walked out of the room with him towards the end of the corridor in order to get back up to her level, hoping the sign of apparent good luck was not a figment of her imagination.
The last thing he saw before he collapsed was Osiris running up to him in agitation...
Cousin: Dudley Dursley (Alive)
During the commotion downstairs Lily crawled off the bed crying as she did so with her Harry, she managed to cast but one spell before the the silencing wards dropped "Vita Sanguinem Praesidium!" She choked pointing her wand at her baby boy who glowed ethereally under the spell for a minute before the door burst open.
"I would rather how talented son be studious and embrace and hone his abilities than be as dangerous as Sirius can be or learn to prank others so carelessly, if they could balance themselves I wouldn't have a problem with them but I fear 'Dog-father' will go the mutts head, we will have to talk with them soon if they want an active role in the child's development, that being said if anyone is up to the task its them" she murmured as she stroaked Harry's red mop of hair lightly as he lay in her arms watching her sleepily.
Ministry Rating: Dark Creature XXXXXX Highly Dangerous
Kingsley laughed and shook his head "Dumbledore is wise, having that department under his thumb is imperative if you want them to let this go through, as you know it will do if you do not let you anger at bureaucratic paper shuffling get the best of you" he said and patted him gently on the shoulder, "we will need to continue your recount after this meeting is over, before I let you leave to attend your godson, warrants will be needed I just hope your's won't be, for strangling Diggle in a minute." He smiled but his eyes remained deadly serious, letting Sirius know he would not walk away if he didn't hold back his temper.
The snake now awake and attempting to struggle and bite him with deadly Basillisk venom, which would actually kill his cells if it landed despite his resilience, poison of that calibre was only negated by beings like Hedwig and Fawkes who weren't presently here.
Kingsley wiped his forehead "Luckily her being there was enough to tip us off as well as her body language and her sugary lies, if we weren't there to prevent it I'm afraid for the children given the list is mostly of partial creatures and she has a vendetta against them" Sonia sighed in relief "Thank you Auror Shacklebolt, I will be in my office if you need to further investigate with Mr Diggle and Auror Black, though I suspect both will be leaving soon to speak with Dumbledore, good day to you!" She smiles, Kingsley just nods and walks away.
As I walk down the stairs I hear the usually background noise of the TV 'Vernon must be watching the news whilst Petunia is in the kitchen' figuring that out I walk to the kitchen intent on getting some breakfast at least before I leave for Gringotts.
"Time to test everyone useless vials bring them up here and pack away your utensils and ingredients back into the store room, know this anyone attempting to steal my ingredients will get more than a detention I assure you!" He barked as he collected their named vials and proceeded to eye them each critically, "It would seem we need some homework assigned to drill the correct brewing methods into your brain, homework will be twelve inches of parchment explaining the functions of each ingredient added to the potion, the correct brewing method and what could be added to strengthen or enhance the potions effects, due in next wednesday, class dismissed!" He said as the bell chimed signalling the end of the lesson.
The Elf sneered but nodded in understanding before grabbing hold of Harry and disappearing the next minute to appear with a crash along the border of Malfoy Manners wards, it seemed the crash had set off some kind of defence mechanism of one of the creatures Harry absorbed because it caused a monstrous power wave to shoot out of his skin, attacking the wards and even travelling far enough to damage the exterior windows of the Manor looming over them from a short distance away, the door almost blew off its hinges as well so Osiris managed to confirm at least two wizards collapsed on the stairs in the interior.
Birth Date: July 31st 1980
"Not to worry headmaster, they at least do not require my close observation at all hours of the day, however I will take my leave as there is much to prepare, hand over the boy to the headmaster Black and we will begin our tasks, be sure to inform Lupin of the situation when you see him and bring him back with you" Severus said, Albus moved aside his papers and withdrew the correct forms signalling Sirius to take them "You will need to take these both to Familial Affairs and Gringotts respectfully, please bring back the Vault Key they present you with and the approval letters upon your return, we will be waiting" he smiled as Sirius handed over the boy how promptly woke up and started crying as Albus took him "Oh dear you are a lively one aren't you Harry? Let me see if I don't have some spare dragons' blood for you to sip" he said as he rummaged through his draws to withdraw a small crimson vial, he pulled the stopper off and gently fed the contents to the child "here you go son, that's nice isn't it!" The others left his office in hurry once content he was in good hands.
She reached his desk and swiftly slammed a copy of the Daily Profit under his widening and calculating gaze and glared at him approvingly, the image showing number four Privet Drive burnt to the ground with a hanging Dark Mark present above the building, coiling slowly in the sky.
Specie Sanguinis - Blood Glamour, this is blood magic disguised as a glamour, used to create a puppet of the victim who's appearance is doused in its affects, it is tricky to overcome on ones own and is even tricker to notice as it seems like a normal glamour.
He strode purposely through the door, tightening his occlumens shields as he did so, he immediately noticed the Dark Lords body first crumpled in a heap of his own blood, the stains of orificial leakage apparent on his lifeless crimson eyes, ears and hands, 'my lord is gone, it seemed he died of an organ rupture curse.. how?' He was rendered dumbfounded at the sight for minutes then as if shaking himself he eyed the rest of the rooms destruction.
Harry noted the reported written by Skeeter, before walking through to the stone courtyard towards the entrance into Diagon Alley, he pulled out his cloak and tied it to his floating trunk, making sure it vanished from view in case others saw as he walked to the bank, before casting a strong disillusionment charm on himself and tapping the bricks in sequence to reveal the arch way.
Gryffindor
Harry glanced fearfully around the room as his appearance reverted to his true form of jet black hair, blue, green and crimson eyes and small black wings, he could do nothing except wriggle and cry out helplessly, he tried to use his magic inherently to stop whatever had hold of him, the air around him glowed a piercing orange before the silver melted off them after a minute to reside in a puddle on the floor.

"In any case I want him to take out that Soul Reaper in the bank to give him more than the ability to steal magic but to use Soul Magic at a higher level than us beings can, I will train him including his Necromancy until his next year starts at Hogwarts and I will introduce him to three members of the junior night court that is sometimes held at my residences, they are of the Vampire, Drow and Lamia races so I have no doubt they will be useful if they are adolescents that can be glamoured to attend with him, good day gentleman and remember to inform me when he wakes" he swiftly left the room leaving Osiris, Lucius, Draco and Blaise to stare awkwardly at the door he departed from.
As Harry repeatedly wailed with a blood stained forehead held in a lifeless embrace, Wormtail fled the scene realising he sent his master to his downfall.
It only took a few minutes to find the correct one, number 21 stood at the far end of the alley and was easily the one most unkempt and in need of repair, it was clear how the two could afford it, it was incredibly cheap because it was so close to falling apart in it's degree of disrepair, as the ministry took it upon themselves to add the bylaw restrictions on lycanthropes working in normal society, Moony suffered with the depravity of his situation as if it was as normal as breathing, having very little of his own despite being qualified as a master of Defense, 'it is outrageous but not much could be done to fight that ridiculous law', he thought, though Sirius saw it for what it was, a direct attack on those with creature blood, 'heading the charges was the ministry hag Delores Umbridge!' He hoped she would croak sooner or later she seemed to a vendetta against werewolves.

'Creature? I'm not human anymore? Well that explains the golden irises I guess though it will be interesting to see why I crave touching magic, I don't feel much different and my features are still humanoid at least I won't stand out besides the aura I exude seems to be quite dense' "If the Dursley's got a full view of my inheritance and are afraid or drawn to me why did they leave my door open?" I wonder.
Lily snarled "Just great he leaves me with our hungry son and activates the silencing ward on his study door so I can't get to the bastard! Paddy spell his crib impenetrable and put Harry in please? I need you also to interrupt James as I can't move to give him a beating myself!" Paddy nodded and levitated the agitated infant into his crib and popped into James' study.
Animagus Ability (100%)
Meanwhile Albus Dumbledore was sat at his desk ideally examining notes in his itinerary for the day ahead, he had hoped Pettigrew would of sent word of his little excursion however he had to concede 'if I was a filthy Death Eater that just potentionally brought his master to his death, he would lie low as well, I wouldn't be surprised if Sirius Black and Remus, once they heard of their friends betrayal would go on the hunt for the Rat, we will see what happens later in regards to the boy' he thought, his mind whirling with schemes depending on the outcome of the days events.
"I will inform her as soon as the floo is shut and I will also take the liberty of informing Severus, that we are in need of some blood replenishment potions, this is grave news if he has contracted the conditions, however I am confident Lily and her son will both live, we will be coming through the floo from the hospital wing shortly, please allow admittance your end and we will meet you in your bedroom within the next half hour, don't worry James the contractions will last a while yet just make sure she is rested and give her some blood replenishment potion before we arrive if you have it on hand, do not give her numbing agents that will effect the pregnancy!".
Everyone shivered at this with open disgust on their faces, Remus snarled with his eyes glowing gold despite being in his human form "You dare do this to my cub! Mark my words Albus you have lost allies this day!" Both Remus and Sirius shouted, when Sirius managed to calm down slightly he asked "What are your goals towards my godson now he is perceived as a threat to all of the ministry?" Onyx eyes glaring hard at Albus with repressed fury and his occlumency shields tightly bound.
They nodded in silence as they strode up to the boarded up door to cast a brief Alohomora in order to gain entrance, carrying the whimpering child into the darkness of its' depths and towards the school to meet its' headmaster.
They ran into the master bedroom, Lily was deathly pale despite her tan laying on the bed, writhing and shivering in a pool of her own blood, if it wasn't for James and the blood replenishment, she would be dead already, Poppy surveyed the scene clinically.
Mother: Lily J. Evans-Potter (Deceased, 1980)
Dedalus and Sirius stood over the baby curled in a foetal position in the cot. "Let's start with brain development" Dedalus mumble a spell as he waved his wand in a sensory motion along the boys face.
"Sire you say? I can think of only one child at present that would be a dark creature and would need a change of legal guardian, let me guess the person you have down there is Sirius Black asking for a change of ward for the Potter boy?" He said with a slight smile, 'this was not how this was meant to go, what is with his nice reaction? Isn't he meant to be wanting to find out where the child is to slay it?' She thought aghast.
Grand Mother: Euphemia Alstroemeria Black-Potter neè Malfoy (Alive, In hiding)
~ 31st July 1995, 11am, Hogwarts Headmasters Office ~
She cast a quick "muffiato" and strong impenetrable charms on the door behind her as it shut, before rounding on a clueless Albus still sporting purple ink spots in his grey beard, at any other time she would of been heavily amused at his ruffled form, except for the grave circumstances that came in the mornings Owl post.
"We will stand with him though being away from this world for too long is upsetting for us as we do have obligations here, Severus as Potions teacher and me as an Auror, we will be missed and probably fired if we do not return daily after a short leave to transition" Sirius stated, "You make a good point human, we will make sure the ministry will give you the needed time off for adjustment but you will return unless they will not allow more creatures among their law enforcement" his soul fires burned furiously at Dedalus who was scared shitless meekly nodding to show it wouldn't be an issue to which Sirius just smirked and nodded before they both walked through and left Dedalus and Dumbledore to rise to a now empty room.
"Alright let's finish our meal then and I will feed him before he sleeps and I go to the study to finish what I should have this morning, you might want to get some more rest too you look considerably tired Lil's" she was about to nod when she felt a faint tremor in the wards as if someone had just been admitted, her gaze snapped to James when they heard a knock on the door downstairs.
Meanwhile Sirius stroad towards the Hogwarts' apparition boundary with the folder he was handed to deliver on his way to the ministry. "I might as well find Moony first to explain the situation as this could take up some time and though I respect the man's judgement, I do not trust Dumbledore alone with Harry, I can trust Moony as he was one of us marauders, how to break the news without him flipping however is another matter entirely!" He muttered as he neared the boundary.
'I hope Peter is innocent of this however, despite what my gut tells me is the truth and the lies he told before he tried to run, I can't lose anyone else' he thought miserably as he trudged past Honeydukes, Madam Rosmerta eyed him warily as she stood outside it, taking her patrons orders.
As Dumbledore stood chuckling too himself quietly, he glanced at the portraits behind him, softly snoozing in their frames, he was vaguely grateful to the previous headmasters and mistresses, though they are failing at pretending to sleep in his presence, they are still duty bound to his will, unless he is ousted from his position, sighing softly he moved to his bed chambers wondering if Peter is with Remus and if so will he succeed in laying blame solely on the rat for their betrayal.
He didn't manage to get any of his files sorted in his office as Paddy proved incapable of distracting Harry long enough, every item he spelled resistant, the child forced to break by will alone with a soft giggle, if it wasn't a source of extraordinary magic in itself he would of been very angry at the constant need to fix whatever his son got his hands on in his childish curiosity, it also seemed he broke every small ward he came across having bumped into the safety barriers Paddy erected over the stairs, floo, locked doors and furniture corners, this proved very irritating to James as his silencing wards kept falling especially when he was having private conversations with Lily about his worries about what Dumbledore's shifty behaviour could mean.
Heir to:
Severus strode quickly through the gloom of the Shrieking Shack towards the tunnel passage, casting a subtle Lumos as his unlikely companion trudged behind him, occasionally muttering in agitated whispers "Why must we take him to Dumbledore? As far as I am concerned I am the boys legal guardian, what's it to you Snivulus if I am to take up my duty prematurely?" Sirius complained "Because you incompetent mutt, you are unfit for the role as you are and I don't wish Lily's blood to die out due to your foolish attempts at fatherhood! At least we will have an answer to our issue by the chief warlock of the Wizengamot, do you think Fudge would take kindly to a dark creature that was orphaned at birth? Mind your tongue before I curse it off, this for the boys continued existence not your misguided beliefs of duty when you are clearly incapable to fulfill what has been handed to you!" Severus snarled in contempt as he stepped into the undergrowth, in truth he was agitated about this too he knew Dumbledore was a master manipulator when he saw value in someone, he silently hoped the old fool would provide a good alternative solution rather than attempt to ensnare the boy.
"Mutt take a look at that bastards spawn before you step too close to him, you will be surprised, I suggest you walk away and go find Pettigrew if you want your revenge before I find the bastard that sold this location to the Dark Lord" Snape sneered condescendingly at him with his wand still trained on him.
The next chapter will reveal their first times and it will also show how the ministry reacted to Dumbledore's rash actions!
In the end he gathered himself and took one last look around the room at all the rest of the beings in captivity settling his attention on another four individuals behind another barrier on the far right wall opposite the sea enclosure.
It was quite shocking to him but his duty to his new lord was what was now breaking through his private thoughts 'Damn those Goblin bastards' he thought briefly as he carried Harry over the threshold just as the Dark Lord himself came down the stairs.. 'This won't end well' he thought fearfully suddenly at wand point.
"You make a good point I apologise for swearing but seriously James you will end up my potions ingredients if you put that cloak over him this is your only warning, lock it in your study today, Paddy will be needed to keep an eye on him if you stick him in his crib, but it isn't advisable that a house elf be left to tend a baby Dhampire, he will get infected easily and I don't much want an undead house elf, their elf council will take drastic actions if we allow Harry to bite him and as he is not a full wizard but of mixed creature blood, they can and will hunt him if it happens, I will not have a family member turned or hunted!" Lily shouted crossing her arms.
Griphook led Harry silently through the golden double doors beside his office with a troop of a dozen armed goblins, intent on descending into the bowls of Gringotts, as they jumped into cart as if they were heading to a vault he turned to Harry and said "We are first heading to the feeding room for you to select some creatures before we take your blocks off, you will need your strength before you go through that ritual Lord Potter afterwards if you wish we can also unlock the Peverell vault where a number of Dark Magic and Necromancy tomes are held for you, it is imperative at least with the gift of being a Necromancer, you collect your personal book from the collection to aid you in using the ability properly, some may call you a Death Master as that is another term related to your art, only Death's chosen children may learn the language and the art, you are one such destined for it, we know nothing more of it ourselves however it is a long lost skill of very few".
After what was only a few minutes she stood facing the entryway to Familial Affairs, her expression, one of hunger as she pulled the door handle and poked her head in the office. "Ah Aurors Black and Shackelbolt? I was not aware some one would be here apart from Mrs Kettleburn, did I just miss her?" She sighed in a girlish manner making the occupants' hairs stand on end, "What the fuck are you doing here Umbridge!" Sirius growled darkly, his eyes flashing dangerously.
"Your sticks can't harm immortals such as this Lich regardless of your proficiency and me? Well I have my ways, hey little Harry! Aren't you the cutest little devil, mummy Flora wants to give you a cuddle and something to eat as you are looking peaky!" Flora grabbed Harry into her arms and offered her slit wrist for the infant, who gladly chomped down on it "You see mortals, he is destined to be above you, his skill will be a danger as you know and have been arguing over, if not properly cultivated, however we do not wish him to grow into a snob either hence we are giving him a chance in the Wizarding world when he comes back for school, it is to temper him for his betterment and the betterment of all magical kind, he is the bridge to bring all the communities together despite hostilities and we have high hope's in his ability to do that under your and our guidance, what do you say mortals?" Flora drawled as she cuddled the baby to her chest.
"You insolent welp! If it wasn't for your saint Potter's poor taste in guardianship, I would gladly give you the boy however you are unfit to raise this child, you are but a man child yourself! Don't speak of responsibility or duties you have no clue about carrying out! I am taking him where he can be cared for as that is my duty as a civil servant teacher! When a child is in need despite what blood he may possess I am capable of deducing the correct procedure to handle them, I am not asking to be its' legal guardian you mongrel, we are needing a source to plan a way for this child to live you ungrateful swine!" Severus shouted as pushed past Sirius with the wailing, wriggling baby in his arms, towards the Great Halls large oak doors.
"No fucking wonder!, could you please also remove these once we are done with this meeting and go downstairs Griphook?" Harry says through gritted teeth, Griphook shakes his head in disbelief before nodding in answer.
To his jubilation, the Profit had reported the Death Eater attack on his home in Little Whinging, seems his ruse was successful though now if Albus noticed he was still around and not a corpse it would bring aspersions to why so he needs to hide.
Cor Lignea - Wooden Heart
As they floated Harry through the open door and into the large room with a raised platform, resembling an ornate sacrificial alter, carved out of solid gold and etched in obscure Elven runes and precious gems that even had Osiris perplexed, they placed him in the centre of it and conjured straps to hold him in place in case of body spasms.
Severus looked contemplative "I will meet with Tom and try and find Harry if it is possible to bring him back over, I realise his worth and his relationship to you Black and you Lupin but your galivanting will attract the wrong attentions and may even put both of you in prison or in Lupins case to death for aiding a known criminal, stay here and I will report when i have found something, Lupin may be of use but you Black are not for this level of work if you are already wanted by normal people" he bowed his head slightly to the others and walked out the room with a sadistic smirk on his face as he realised he wouldn't give Albus his antidote before leaving so he was stuck under its effects until he returned.
The child wails and turns to the only living being in the room and eyed it with a venomous glare which was intriguing for a baby to make that face, it snarled animalistically with its eyes glowing a cross between Avada green and deep crimson red at the Lord who falled his family, Voldemort felt vaguely intrigued by the specimen before him however he did come here to end this supposed thorn in his reign "It was a pity, Severusss wanted her as a play thing but no matter though" he mused as he trained his wand on the enraged infant which looked pretty amusing to the Lord before him, like an angry kitten almost unable to do anything except snarl and bare it's small fangs.
"Mr Cauldwell how dare you make such a racket at this time in the morning!, 10 points from Gryffindor for your undignified shrieking!" Minerva McGonagle stood directly behind the boy, glaring over her glasses as she towered over him with a stern expression, "If you do that again you will receive detention, now away with you, breakfast will be on shortly" she continued down the stairs without a backwards glance at the cowed child, noticing Albus lurking in the entry way she made a beeline for him.
Sirius thought for a moment before nodding "What's been asked?", Molly answered "He cursed Tonks and Kingsley so he could get away from the Auror's, he was going back to Hogwarts, apparently he made a fail safe vial of Harry's blood to anchor and locate him, he ran for him this morning because he knows the boy has turned into a dark creature, apparently his inheritance was starved off intentionally".
Peverell
Legilimency (100%)
"I accept you Po-Harry however you are right I am dating Blaise and this could present a problem given certain aspects of my life" he whispers in response despite the muffling charm, Blaise butted in "If you wish me to jump back into a platonic relationship I am perfectly fine with that and it would not affect our friendship Draco, I am very happy for you and did you see Pansy's face oh Salazar it was priceless as the port key hit her!" He laughs again which caused both Draco and Narcissa to smirk slightly.
Griphook actually smirked at the squawk of dismay Osiris let out at being bound and held at wand point, "Think you are leaving before Lord Potter has finished his ritual? Think again, we will also make you bound to him via contract and telepathic bond, we do not take cheap words as assurance unlike this Lord, you will be bound, forced into an Unbreakable Vow to ensure allegiance and suffer to telepathic bond, he will know your secrets as we do, you will not betray his kindness, as we wish for amicable ties with him that is the only reason we are allowing you freedom but it will still come at a steep price thief!" He spat as he climbed out of the cart with the other goblin guards.
He trudged along the stone path quickly, passing rows of small cottages and the small cemetery stationed on his left side, as he edged north towards the wrought black iron gate emblazoned with the Potter crest, at the far right end of the town, from a distance he could see it slightly ajar, tell tail signs that worm Wormtail and his master were here previously 'I have to hurry' he thought to himself as he neared his destination.
Kingsley muttered "Sirius she is going to the Regulation department I am sure as I would under official capacity, what you are asking is permission to endanger many if not yourself and others, Severus to be turned and possibly attack others regardless of who is present at the event! They will see it as a matter of security risk to the next generation and put the boy to death if he is captured and now they know where he is!" Sirius growled at the thought "I was asked to do this I will protect my godson even if I am to go Azkaban for blowing up that hag and the Diggle when he eventually turns up the nasty bastard, I don't even know why Dumbledore tolerates the man at the Order!" He whispered angrily, knowing any louder and the surveillance wards will record the conversation.
'Seems we finally arrived' Harry thought idely, as he and the other goblins disembarked on to the sleak stone walkway facing the door in question.
As Harry approached the Goblin guards stationed at the entrance, they looked in his direction with narrowed eyes as if they could actually sense him 'figures they can sense me under a disillusionment charm, isn't exactly full proof, I'll have to find a creature that would change that' he thinks idely as the guards approach him "Mr Potter I assume please banish the charm before you enter, I Ironfang will escourt you straight to your account manager, we understand the danger you are now in and look after our own creatures given we are openly despised by most wizards and we remember the kindness shown among them in rare cases" he grinned toothily as he fingered the curve of his short axe.
How will Albus and others handle their now over powered Golden Boy? Will Draco accept the vast changes? Will Osiris prove useful in the days to come? How will Harry's friends or Voldemort take his sudden uprising? We will see..
"Serverus, did you bring the restorative potions? We have to go there now or she and that baby won't make it, if it is as we have been led to believe and is inhuman, regardless of his mothers genealogy also having dormant creature blood, she is still too human to give birth to something with vampirism, Albus tells me James has opened the floo connection to my grate so we must be swift" Poppy spoke in clinical irritation, Snape just sneered at her "Do you think me incompetent woman? Yes I brought it all as requested, she is dear to me".
New spells to note:
An short interim chapter in the views of Draco and Albus as Harry enters the bank.
Dumbledore stood up and conjured a cot for the boy and promptly set him inside satisfied that the spell he had cast was successful before sitting back down and focusing on his piles of work with a smirk.
"I guess that is more than we can hope for in this climate and given the kid is a Dhampir, alright Dedalus I will take you to Albus to see Harry though be aware I have Remus guarding the boy and he is bound to be pissed" Sirius sighs as he stands up and claps a hand over Dedalus.
Griphook met him half way "Mr Potter do you have your key for verification? Before we adjourn to my office?" He grinned at Harry slightly as the key was tossed into his small palm "Very good, that will be all Ironfang, come Mr Potter we have documents to sign and much to discuss!".
They moved as one to drag Harry out of the chamber still teaming with vicious entities, thankfully that last attack made by the Hydra didn't destroy the barriers, keeping them safe from the many captives, if even one of the closed off habitats of the larger creatures was disturbed, allowing things like the sinister looking Messorem hiding in the depths of the Dementor enclosure out, the entire bank wouldn't be enough to kill it.
Voldemorts' crimson gaze fell on the retreating wizard, contemplating on his servants motives before disregarding it for another time. "Wormtail you best not fail me if you want to be rewarded for this, you will have all you desire if by tonight I am the only one alive in that house, now be gone and collect any materials you think will be needed!".
Harry meets an unlucky Dark Elf and saps some very strong beasts before coming before a Shaytan of all beings..
Albus Dumbledore steeped his fingers as he cast a subtle hungry gaze at the boy who had fallen asleep in his godfathers lap somewhere within the meeting and was currently drawling on the mans leg as he slept. 'The dangers of proposing this here are relatively still large, especially in the school term, however with the proper staff present, we could handle one lower new born vampire easily..' "you may start Severus, however know this if we fail to successfully restrain you and you escape, you will be executed, I do not want to do this but as Headmaster I can not afford to carelessly endanger student lives to vampires, you will be stronger than even your sire at full strength before your first feed as you know, I recommend Filius join us and Minerva to ensure all precautions are met, I suggest we carry out the cleansing on the seventh floor after dinner, it gives me time to inform the school of precautionary measures, that being said Hagrid might be able to assist as well he would be a match for your possible strength so I will call on him too, we will do this at midnight in the Room Of Requirement, all students should be protect and in bed by that time should we fail to restrain you, Sirius you should deliver these adoption papers to the ministry and file your report of the incident, I have kept you gentleman long enough, you may leave Harry with me whilst you prepare for the ceremony and it's legal ramifications" he smiled at the two as he gestured towards the sleeping infant, Severus eyes narrowed in dark suspicion but relented as he had no power yet to object, Sirius however scowled "Why are you so intent on taking the boy Dumbledore?", "I was merely taking the burden off your shoulders whilst you prepare for a very sudden ritual, you can't do both whilst caring for the boy, surely you realise the department of the regulation for dangerous creatures would lock this child up as soon as it set foot in the ministry? Without a sire for the newborn he represents a highly dangerous threat to society even at this age especially with his evident magical strength and natural abilities?" Albus said lightly yet condescendingly, reprimanding the man and reaffirming the foolish dangers of having outsiders attempt to take the boy elsewhere.
"You would be correct it is a telepathic loyalty bond, they wouldn't let me out without some kind of chains to prevent hindering Harry only strengthening him".
'She seems to think I'm a monster, well we can't deny I must make the sound, hard choices against such predators regardless of their age, though James was always an outstanding Auror as was his wife, so I can't allow the pure blood line to perish so easily without first observing young Mr Potter especially if backed by Albus, he may be as strong as his parents if he is indeed such a rare creature, I would prefer to protect it depending on the outcome, despite the ministry's actual stance on creature blood, if they allowed James to be among their elite ranks, I'm hoping they will take leniency on my judgement' Dedalus thought as he stepped in with her and the golden grills shut behind them, heading to the next floor up.
"Now see here! I have every right to protect this ministry from threats! That thing must be found and exterminated before it can be used to revolt against society!" She shrilly stated, her eyes flashing around her trying to find a way out of the situation.
Ragnok walked round to him and gestured Sirius to follow him through up to the adjacent door to his left, into his office.
He said, Kingsley looked at him sharply during the explanation of Harry and his condition as it was not written in his report though he conceded for good reason, it presented very dangerous problems he thought so turned to eye Sonia for her response.
~31st July 1995~
Minerva put her hand to her mouth and gasped at seeing the agitated baby clawing at Severus's cloak, it appeared to be a red haired vampire child! 'Why the hell has Severus got a child in his hands and by extension a dark creature!? Why is he bringing it here? Did I hear correctly is Sirius Black the guardian of this child? That couldn't possibly mean..' "NO! Dear god please tell us it's not true!" Minerva wailed catching on, "Is this child Harry Potter!?" She pointed shakily at the wriggling bundle in his arms.
It took some time before another lift resurfaced on their level, her fidgeting the entire time made him smirk playfully as he watched her inner turmoil ripen.
"It seems you will have your life cut out for you after all if you are following in my foot steps son but be aware you will one day have to fight for your privileges of simplicity".
Aunt: Bellatrix Black-Lestrange (Alive, Hiding)
"Temper, temper Auror Black" she tsked at him, "I am here for information on Harry Potter of course, it was rumoured he was born prior and may have survived this tragic encounter" she said lightly, though her eyes gave away the hunger and disdain she felt of Harry Potter, Sirius shook in barely suppressed rage "What? This is not your concern or your department now, you have no right or jurisdiction to go through that book! We could have your ousted for breaking protocol and even imprisoned for the major data protection leak, we have practically caught you red handed! Undersecretary or not I'm sure Fudge won't turn a blind eye to this despite your excuses!" Sirius snarled as he stood up and raised his wand at her face.
"You are disssmisssed, Wormtail face me, I wish to know everything.. Legelimens! I see Godrick's Hollow has been placed under a fidelius charm by the old fool and you were named secret keeper" he smirked "We will leave tonight to avoid issues, Ssseverus? Did you wish to ask ssomething?" He met the beadle black stare of the other dark figure looming over Wormtail with a questioning gaze.
"I need to visit Familial Affairs to change the guardianship of Harry, my godson, though I can't give you an official reason why Kingsley, it will have to be when Dumbledore calls a meeting on what to do about the Death Eaters now their master has been slain, I wouldnt be surprised if we see many a cock and bull story as they try to merge back into society, would you take that bet? 20 Galleons says we will see at least Lucius Malfoy pull it off!" He smirked slightly despite how disgusted the idea made him feel at the thought of any of them getting off scot free.
"A Messorem? I am surprised they managed to even capture one of those things, they are more volatile than even my Dementors, will the boy even be able to get close enough to it without dying? He would need very special powers and guidance to approach one and live, trapped or not it is one of those beings that lives up to the legends carved by Death himself as for the abilities I am intrigued in the list you offer it would be of use so I can gauge his usefulness as my ally or my enemy depending on his answer when he wakes" Voldemort muttered quietly.
"They wished for amicable relations, said he would be asleep for three days to give him time to adjust to the many creatures he has absorbed and they also wish him to take care of a rogue Messorem in their creature prison, where he found me, do you wish me to tell you the creatures that will manifest in him in one way or by Animagus form?" Osiris bit out through gritted teeth much to Voldemort's amusement.
Aruspices Expulsis - Individual Organ Rupture
He encountered both a strange black sludge that tried to pull him through the floor before being sapped and a boggart on his way around the room, much to the amusement of all his companions before stopping at another chained prison with deep red eyes attempting to struggle from its bindings in a flurry of shifting darkness, a vampire was clearly giving it all he had in the face of Harry's gaze to break free and run.
Dolores gathered herself before the Aurors came looking and simply strolled confidently towards Sonia's office, intent on finding out the information herself, smirking slightly as she neared the end of the corridor.
I will be posting weekly updates from now on, I have a lot of interesting things for later chapters though Harry may turn pretty OP with his abilities especially under Snapes watch, his Animagus will be immense too #spoilers
'So that's her game? Hasn't she done enough damage to the Werewolves recently making them unemployable? Is she starting on all she deems half breeds?' Sonia thought troubled at the timing. "I'm sorry Madam Umbridge, I will have to investigate further into the matter to find out I was on the way up to the forth floor to speak with Dedalus Diggle anyway isn't he whom you should speak with? Despite you position it is not your judgement call to make against any kind of child it is the Regulation Departments madam" she said narrowing her eyes at the woman.
"Well in answer no we will never be married, this old man doesn't swing that way and I'm sure my old wolf would eat him for touching me" Sirius said with an amused smirk before adding "However what people are not aware of is Harry is alive and well and as his guardian I have come to make arrangements to better his life, Mr Severus Tobias Snape has requested custody and blood Adoption of the boy and I have sequested with the stipulation that he is also placed as ward of the school indefinitely as I am unable to care for the boy myself, I'm sure you remember James and his vampiric nature, he has past this to his son who was born an extraordinarily powerful Dhampire, this is more than even I can handle we have decided a blood Adoption be done tonight, giving young Harry Potter a sire to answer to eliminating possible dangers and allowing the boy to flourish under the proper guidance."
In no time at all he was face to face with his assigned case manager Bogrod, who stood eyeing him impatiently, "Sirius Arctureous Black, godfather of one Harold James Potter, I have come to change his legal Guardianship and His vault access to a Mr Severus Snape and Hogwarts School Of Witchcraft And Wizardry, effective immediately" Sirius stated evenly.
As he handed the cage to a grateful Sirius, Remus mumbled "We can't have you running from this therefore Obiecto Speciem! Obice Transfiguro!" Warding the cage against Peter's Animagus transformation and Apparition, effectively trapping the stunned creature in place, "Sirius, let me know what happens with the investigation?" He said with a lump in his throat as he punched the nearest wall allowing it to crumble in the wake of his strength.
As the day war on in the Potter household, it is safe to say James was near exhausted, Harry proved to be more of a handful than even he previously predicted.
"Mrs Kettleburn is it? I would like to know if James Potter ever had the child he was expecting, can you find records of this? It is imperative I remove the threat it could place on the ministry!" Dolores stated trying to intimidate Sonia into giving the information.
"You invited war with a magical race that controls the financial security for Wizarding Britain just because you wanted to get to my godson Albus? You best have a damn good reason however guys I believe this discussion needs to be held in my home before some Aurors track him and by extension me, it would not do well for Tonks and Kingsleys careers to be seen here with both of us, at least you can explain away not knowing is plans against Gringotts and fleeing when finding out, I suggest going to file the report at the ministry" Sirius added angrily, his wand trained on the headmaster, who tensed at the idea of Kingsley and Tonks leaving.
"Specie Alis! Specie Sanguinis! Magicae Obstructionum! You would be too powerful without the proper precautions" he murmured as Harry's form became Human in appearance, both his true appearance and his wings glamoured and anchored via blood magic to prevent him from being retrieved by one of his kind so easily and his magical ability restricted with a block on his inherent abilities, due to the previous metamorph into his mothers appearance, he was now stuck looking like a human young child with bright green eyes and dark red hair, making him every inch the appearance of his mother, until the block was removed, this would be the only appearance he will ever know or others.
As the sun split the horizon an audible thump split the calm silence, within the centre of town and as if out of thin air a hook nosed man appeared at the noises source, clad in greasy black silk robes, clashing equally with his stained black hair, carrying a wand outstretched in his right hand.
Albus' face grew darker with each line he read of the short article "Harry is missing, contact Remus and the others, gather Moody, we need to find him if Tom hasn't or the ministry!" He shouted as he rose from his chair, utterly furious, Minerva's lips were curved into a thin line as she answered crisply "the search has already commenced despite what the article suggests, it appears Mr Potter boarded the Knight Bus towards Diagon Alley at around 9:15am, the boy is safe I would of thought he went to Gringotts after fending off his attacker" she said.
Meanwhile Remus lay admist his pack mates in the forest of Dean with Peter no where in sight so when a flash of fire appears out of thin air in their dingy little safe house in Knockturn Alley, it found it's intended recipient without any issues.
Severus after completing his Hogwarts rounds felt his Dark Mark actually fading to a charcoal grey instead of a burning black, it could only mean one thing.. "The Dark Lord was defeated? Wait I can think of their address.. the Fidelius is broken! I need to get to Lily!" He shouted at himself in a panic, he realised he must do this cautiously however so no one suspected him there 'it wouldn't do if Black caught him at the scene or the crime or others as I rush there if the scene is as I fear' getting an edge of deceptive calm into his mind, he focused his wand on his prince family ring and whispered "Portus" it glowed dimly blue as the spell sunk in before the tell tail invisible hook on the back of his neck jerked him away to his destination in Godricks Hollow...
Uncle: Lucius Abraxas Malfoy (Alive)
Osiris crumpled to the floor before rising slowly his magic working again to close and seal his bodily injuries, before he could take a step however Harry grabbed his arm roughly, his golden eyes bore into Osiris's violet ones "If you betray me you will end up my meal like the others, I may sympathise with you due to similarly being victims of Voldemort but I will not tolerate lies or betrayal, I will stand by you as long as you do the same, nice to meet you Osiris I am Harry Potter" he withdrew and shook the man's hand before walking further away to search for more creatures to sap.
"Dumbledore should have protected you all!" He spat venomously "How did that traitor Pettigrew conceive the nerve to even oust the Potters location? How did he even know it! I was not aware of the change, I thought that little bastard Black would be his ideal candidate for the task, not the Rat! I will find out what he knows when I find him I vow it!" He shouted angrily.
"Is merely a common thief actually if we bind its will to you we will consider the debt paid in full Lord Potter" Griphook grinned nastily to which Harry nodded is ascent "I will take it after my meal and we can do the binding after my magical blocks are removed" Harry said and then walked up to the creature who shivered involuntarily under his gaze.
It took everything Harry had to quell the sudden impulses of his new nature, to not sap the gifts within the feast before him, 'they do not deserve to die after all' he thought to himself, even as the malnutrition pain settled deep into his bones as if it was his new and only food source and was being denied.
"Come in!" He called slightly apprehensively, 'nothing good would come from such an aggressive knock' he thought privately as the door opened. "Ah Minerva, to what do I owe the pleas.." before he could even finish his sentenced her rumpled and seemingly pale appearance stormed over to him in a flurry of deep green tartan robes, waving her wand viciously as she went.
He put down his list, stretched and stood up "Breakfast will be shortly it seems, I hope the Elves have made a nice selection of spread today" he mumbled as he proceeded to walk out the his office and towards the whinding staircase.
They strolled into Griphook's office quickly, Griphook went to stand behind his desk as he gestured to the empty seat opposite him for Harry to take, which Harry actually declines by instinct, this made the goblin laugh "I see Mr Potter you are not a fool to our customs when dealing with business transactions, this is surprising but very welcome, I am sure you wish to know the extent of the matters in which we summoned you?" He searched for some documents and placed a parchment in front of Harry and hands him a small rubied ceremonial dagger with etched runes carved along the handle before saying "Please place three drops of blood on this parchment, it will reveal your inheritance and birth certificate, the next one I will give you is your rites to succession among the heir and lord Rings and properties, we will then discuss your individual vault holdings as well as discrepancies that seems to have appeared once doing a full account audit" he grins nastily when he says that.
What do you think will happen when Diggle and Sirius return to see Harry? Or the consequences of the Adoption ritual? Will the vampire court find them?
'This is not going to be good, after the Dark Lord sent me to teach brats it has been one thing after another with this old goat, however he has protected Lily while the Dark Lord hunts her so I have to see this through' he thought dispassionately "What is it Fawkes?, I am busy if it is not urgent tell Albus I will answer him tomorrow" he sneered as the note dropped on to his desk.
Hearing this Harry banished the charm and nodded to Ironfang as he entered and was escourt down the marble hall, attempting to ignore the subtle interest shown by all the Goblins present working their way through the days clientele.
He stood up quickly and dusted off his cloak before turning to greet his rescuers, only to find Kingsley Shacklebolt standing beside him, looking both vaguely amused but also tense about the explanation be knew was coming.
Harry could barely contain his premature predatory bloodlust as they vigilantly stepped inside the dark passage devoid of any light, he knew however it wouldn't be wise to cast a lighting charm or at least a common one as most dark creatures' bane is natural or unnatural light or at least the rare and powerful ones tend to be sensitive to it, only with his current abilities could he take the gift and nullify that particular weakness, his only worry was when sapping the creatures was 'Would I also gain their base instincts that could possibly overwhelm my own' that was the real danger of such dangerous ability, was his psyche prepared for something else to invade in order to pass on the gifts each had and would it become harder the more he consumed? Given it was a base instinct to sap all dark magic he came across, would it affect his usually strong mind in his new form? "Guess I will have to find out the hard way now" Harry muttered into the gloom as they approached and inner chamber.
Harry had to make a double take seeing this as his insides were screaming something new as he took in the glorious sight of Draco Malfoy, somewhere deep in his mind growled 'Mate!' He briefly wondered if that was the creature in him recognising it's chosen..
From what he could see the goblins had gathered:
'I truly hope that woman keeps her grubby hands out of this situation, if I am to get this done smoothly under the radar for Lord Black, I am doubtful this Mr Snape has the skill despite his ex Death Eater status, it takes more to house a child with such afflictions' she thought as she found her way to his office door.
The occupants nodded slowly in a daze almost except Albus who frowned and then held his wand in a threatening stance "I will not be bullied or manhandled, this child is not your property he is the saviour of our world and a member of Wizarding society his current guardian being a wizard not a member of the council of dark magical beings, who are you to lay claim to him and think you can get away with assaulting me!".
(See the end of the chapter for
He floated over to Harry and then actually went through him and disappeared completely, fusing with Harry's already astonishing growth, Harry collapsed and passed out as pain ripped through him, after digesting too many close to immortal lives, he actually gained immortality and that was a very agonising shock to his previously mortal system making him slip into a coma whilst his gifts settle.
A Messorem is the product of a hybrid birth between a Dementor and an Elder Lich or Higher Necromantic Ritual, it is a variation of the legendary Soul Reaper that Death himself is meant to be, it's bloodlust is unrivalled as well as it's instinct to behead, some say these rare beings are the reason for the fabled Headless Horseman to exist as even in undeath, the victim of a Messorem will still be struck from its shoulders.
"The only surviving members of the residence of number four Privet Drive could be seen running down the street before abruptly stopping seemingly caught by the assailants strong Memory Charms before leaving the Dark Mark and disappearing before the Auror's could capture the culprit."
Harry does so before walking briskly out the office with him, heading into the depths of the bank, thinking over how to best get revenge over his precious headmaster and old friends.
Osiris nodded knowing denying the knowledge would lead to his death and as the last of his particular clan he truly did not want to end his bloodline despite the pain it will cause him through his bond now residing with Harry.
'Ha take that useless Weasel's! He's finally mine!' He thought gleefully hoping it didn't show on his face in public, though from the looks Blaise and his mother gave him he could tell he failed to at least hide it from them, it was truly hard to keep the smile threatening to erupt on his face at bay and display the indifferent Malfoy mask he had to uphold but he managed nonetheless to at least appear calm despite feeling particularly giddy.
"Once again mutt you have put your keen and penetrating mind to the task of justice and as usual come to wrong conclusion, I knew as I think of Lily often as you gathered being there long enough to see my breakdown, I knew the wards at dropped the moment I could name their residence last night, I slipped out via portkey to conduct my own investigation and make sure the Potter's were safe, I found them hear as they are, I rushed up here to try and save her, only their son survived, how I wonder he accomplished a shield against the organ rupture curse and rebounded it is anyone's guess" he said snidely but with a lilt of awe in his final words, watching the baby fidget in his robe "the boy was cold and crying so I offered him my cape just now to keep him warm, he had been in her cold embrace all night it seemed and sustained a scar to the head I believe when the curse hit, what are your intentions with the boy? He is safe with me if you wish to find Pettigrew yourself first so we can interrogate the welp?" He asked in frustration.
As the pain hit it's crescendo, I blacked out, the last thing I hear is a crash from down the hall, it seems I woke them up after all..
He walked briskly towards the residential district of the alley, watching for signs of any potential Death Eaters attempting to attack the milling occupants out of the corner of his eye as he scanned the door numbers he past in search for his friends domicile.
To like Rubeus Hagrid,
All was eerily silent along the narrow whinding street of Godrick's Hollow except for the occasion rustle of leaves blowing in the chilled late autumn air, dawn was vastly approaching upon its' gently sleeping occupants, unaware of the tragedy it would wake up to.
Severus stumbled to his feet, clutching his head for a minute as did the others before pointing his wand at the child and whispering a light cleaning spell to wash the blood off the still screaming infant, on closer inspection they could make out Harry had small protruding black wings and a deathly pale complexion, confirming his vampiric inheritance however his small ears seem to carry and elven trait to them rather than pure vampire, Severus berated himself he should have known this boy would inherit both dominant genes of the two.. he was a Dhampire which although is miraculous and rare in magical breeding due to the Fae and Vampire covens not getting along, it will spark controversy regardless of his social standing, 'this will be bad' he thought.
James looked down at him and as their eyes meet, he could of sworn they repeatedly changed colours 'is my kid a metermorphamagus at well? Damn Tonks will have a run for her money if that is the case, what doesn't my boy have skill in? It already seems endless potential' he mused as he gently laid back down with them both under the covers and listen to both of them sleep with his little Harry in his arms.
He noted the house elf 'Didn't Lily say it was called Paddy or something?' He wondered as he looked into the blank eyes staring at him in the doorway, eyeing it with indifference and then finally turned to the bed where he found Lily laying with her head against the underside of the bed mattress, in a lifeless embrace with her child.
I do realise it's only August 31st in the timeline not Halloween when Voldemort found them in the film, however I really wish to set the scene for some true angsty hardships for baby Harry, I took inspiration for doing this via the manga Death Mage Who Doesn't Want A Forth Time, this really sets the scene for unthinkable trials ahead and I wished to have Harry be dealt such a blow for later scenes and mindset, what do you think of dark Dumbledore and his easy manipulation in selling out the Potters to vindicate his sense of justice? Let me know! I also apologise for short chapters but they won't all be.
Sonia sighs as she is left alone to manage her growing stack of paperwork though she has a ghost of a smile on her face 'I hope Harry gets it, if any child deserves love it is him and our thanks for ridding us of the You Know Who' she thinks to herself.
After a while of stopping and starting Stan starts observing me more closely in my bed "Say Nev or shoulda say Harry? What's up with ya eyes? Weren't they green last time?" He asks inquisitively, I just shrug and say I'm wearing new contacts "It's a cool muggle item Stan, changes your eye colour to whatever you want for a select amount of time!" I smile abit to make it believed, "Heh, that a thing? Well I mus' say it's very allurin' might have to try some meself!" He laughs, "I recommend going to alternative fashion and trinket shops in London maybe like Camden Town to get those Stan" I reply with a slight smirk, He just nods in acceptance and the ride resumes its silence despite the crashing sounds as the bus tears through random roads as it passes along well until its next stop when someone heavily cloaked got on and sat with their hood up right beside him on the opposite bed "Didn't think you would be so bold to get on here Tom" I sneer at the figure who let out a dark chuckle and lifted his head to meet my eyes, "looksss like your inheritance has given you more gall Harry, I am not here to kill you for once providing you don't try my patience asss we both know I have very little, I found an unscheduled raid on your previous premisessss and was intrigued that you even knew my little calling card ssspell, I alssso happen to know what you are, are you intrigued to know?" He asks coldly, "now you mention it Tom I was just going to Gringotts but if you can save me the trouble with minimal risk sure, what's the catch? Want my fealty? Well I won't give it you murdered my only family after all and unless something drastically changes I will never".
"Mr Dumbledore, I am sure you are aware as Chief Mugwamp, this is not the way to behave on any Gringotts premises, do you wish to be escorted out and have yourself and your compatriots arrested for disturbing the peace?" He spoke quietly, "What is the nature of your enquiry and your rude entrance?" He asked gazing speculatively at the old man before him.
"Remus my boy, Sirius informed me of your arrival though I confess that was quick, Harry is sleeping right now in the cot over there" he pointed at the cot he had moved into a corner of the room beside the book cases, Remus peered at the boy softly snuggled up there for a moment before his eyes narrowed and he shouted "What have you done Albus I can detect your signature all over him and it seems he is under a fucking glamour, what is the meaning of this? You know a glamour will drop after an adoption ritual it changes the genetic make up! So why go through the trouble!?" Deep anger evident in his voice at the audacity.
"Yes parties, you see he has been giving generous donations to the Order of his as well as the Weasleys since your parents passing, I will also have to check you for Compulsions and ability blocks to see how deep he has interfered for legal purposes and presenting a case against him with your consent, as well as retrieve what was stolen, do I have permission Mr Potter?" Griphook asks as he leans over with a seperate blank parchment.
Occlumency (100%)
'Crush the diced scarab with a firm press of the knife's blunt side, add to simmer and stir counter clockwise 3 times until the potion turns from transparent to turquoise, add the Flubberworm Pus after 3 minutes and stir once clockwise until the Turquoise turns Dark Green, before adding the Asphodel and turning 5 clockwise and then 3 times anti clockwise until the mixture turns Charcoal Grey, Leave to simmer a further 20 minutes before adding Moonshine and Diced Gurdyroot, making sure to stir counter clockwise before the last ingredient of Dragon Heart String is added, if the steps are adhered to the Charcoal Grey will turn a bubbling Pink ready for the drops of blood from both participants to be added when taken, allow to simmer on a low burn until ready to be consumed'.
"You could of been my apprentice if this prophecy did not exist I believe it will be a loss but it is a sacrifice I must take and as you are a dark creature I think it fitting you experience the organ rupture curse I used to end your father.. Aruspices Bombarda Maxima!" The yellow light soared towards its defenceless target however it simply bounced off the infants forehead and rebounded back at the caster, ripping Voldemort of his mortal coil into wrathe form and sending his body slamming into the back wall.
"Who the hell is knocking at this time of night it can't be Remus, He's with the werewolves as far as I know and if it were Sirius we would of heard the motorcycle by now, bloody monstrosity it is!" Lily whispered to him worridly clutching her son tightly, who began to cry slightly at the rough handling, "I'm sorry baby, mommy didn't mean to crush you, I'm just scared, James check who's there I will lock this door in case with the strongest thing I can think of, hurry!" James nodded and stood up to open their door as quietly as he could.
If he was being honest with himself, he could feel the power swim and hum pleasantly as well as seductively as it poured out of the runes and gently caressed his newly heightened senses, the moment he caught sight of it, it was more tempting to drain the 'Pansy Parkinson' or at least he thought as he attempted to reach for the door, only to be stopped by his many escorts.
Remus wasn't buying it "What about the clear issue with his magical core? It seems corrupted?" Accusation clear in his stare, "Ah that my boy is the results of his battle with the Dark Lord Voldemort, it's hard to say how to remove it without damaging the boy however I am researching this issue, we can't very well have our ward defenceless or unable to practice magic with stable proficiency when his lessons start, now can we?".
"Yyess master" Peter bowed jerkily and vacated the room, leaving the Dark Lord to wait patiently for his plan to come to fruition.
It was around dinner time when they decided to get into bed and be served in their quarters, Lily was still quite sore so had stayed there all day and just added to her cramps it seemed though thoroughly enjoyed James's antics with Harry, almost pulling his hair out having to do everything for a change.
"Mr Potter I believe I am next to add my gifts to you, I die willingly for this though I must get you to swear on your magic to rid the world of both Albus Dumbledore and Tom Riddle as well as the creature king Nylar Septimus and lead us all into a better Wizarding and Magic era, it is in line with your overall goals and is broad enough that any good continuous change will suffice, that is my price for my life and my extraordinary gifts to you, what say you?" The Shaytan rasped looking directly at Harry with a smirk.
"I do not doubt you have a lot you could give him at your disposal Sirius, however only another vampire could sire this child, unless you wish to perform the rites of blood adoption, infecting yourself with the curse to raise him as a Potter-Black heir and having your Auror license revoked due to contamination, you are unfit to be his guardian, if he was human the circumstances would be entirely different and he would also have relatives to choose from if it were the case as well but it sadly isn't so.." Albus parted the mans leg as he stood up in sympathy, who incidentally looked pained at having the concede that point, he would be throwing his only means of supporting Harry into ruin if he took up the mantel James had past to him, he despaired in silence realising it was another of his failure's.
"My lord, could you spare Lily Potter your wrath if you only need the boy?" Severus pleaded, Voldemort laughed coldly "ahh Sseverus you surprise me with your rather bold request, I will spare the mudblood if she yields, if she fights I have no patience and will kill them all, this isss a promise Severus" "Thank you for indulging my impertinence my Lord" Snape bowed and left the audience chamber in a hurry.
Potions Administered by Albus Dumbledore and Poppy Pomfrey:
"You've knackered her out you know?" He sighed and bopped Harry on the nose with his finger gently for it, eliciting another soft giggle before taking his nail to his upper chest, making him bleed gently for Harry to latch on and have his first feed contently.
"Oh yes how was your tumble earlier with your little rat friend?" Flora grinned at the outrage slowly dawning on his face, "if I were you I would check with the Fae about harming you and preventing so called justice" she smiled and put Harry back in the cot.
"Paddy!" Lily shouted, "Yes mistress?" He answered with a soft pop of apparition, "help me seal the door when James moves outside but do not put a silencing wards up just in case it is a false alarm" Lily said as the pulled out her wand from the draw, "Praemoenio!" "Salvia Hexia!" "Repelo Mugglesum!" "Fiantodori!" "Confirma Sanguinem!"

Albus nodded and stowed his wand away content with his spell work and sat down in his chair once again to appear busy until the wolf barged into his office.
