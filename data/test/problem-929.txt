But Oliver is now dying in St Mungo. Or his body his dying, they are not sure where Oliver Wood is. Hermione’s current hypothesis is that he is inside the curse, or what remains of it floating over the Quidditch stadium. If they remove the curse they will lose Oliver’s soul forever. Not that they can get Oliver’s soul out of the curse.
“And…?”  Harry wavered searching for the next word. For the last nine years he had been trying to get Kreacher to drop the “master” and call him Harry or HarryPotter or “sir” as a compromise. Kreacher refused and Harry was hesitant to press the point because it was so rare for a house elf to have a preference and stick to it.
Harry kneeled by the bare patch and put his hand over it, hovering. Perhaps he saw it or perhaps he imagined it, something unclenching from that place in his forehead behind the scar, something small and forgotten travelling down his throat as he swallowed. Something dark, an echo of something bigger that once lived by his heart. Something that eeled down his arm and to his hand.
Not even the muggle daughter in law could be properly harassed. Although Molly found that she didn’t mind it much. Ron seemed very happy with her, very calm, and Molly had spent a year worrying about him and what killing Voldemort might mean for her youngest boy. She was afraid he might go funny in the head. Olivia was good for him so she got a pass.
Harry didn’t talk much to the neighbours upstairs. He wasn’t a morning person but nevertheless Harry was familiar with the hours before eleven in the morning. He didn’t think anyone in that flat woke before two. So their schedules didn’t collide much, is what he meant. But eventually, they had met, and hiding behind a corner would just make him more suspicious so he talked to them. The typical British Exchange of Good Wishes he had learned in Privet Drive.
“See? That’s all well now.” Luna smiles like the sunrise, soft and subtle and pink. “Oh, hello Harry!”
Dessert was served. It was cake made with fruits that shouldn’t be called a fruit cake. It was something more, something better. It was moist and sweet and with just the right touch of tartness. A wonderful mixture of sweet strawberries, a hint of cherry and a citric shadow.
“Step back and show me your hands,” he ordered again and almost immediately casted the same spell, not waiting to see if she would comply. This was the best course of action in a polyjuice case. The situation was too stressful to make a decision so it should be postponed until both subjects had been isolated and apprehended. One could think better once the threat had been contained so that’s what Harry was doing, knocking both of them down.
Harry was so suddenly and violently overcome by emotion that he just had to grab his face with both hands and kiss him.
He is not a seer, but one day over breakfast Draco looks up and says “It won’t work. Whatever you are plotting, it won’t work. I can’t recall a single plan of yours that worked longer than a month. Kicking Dumbledore from Hogwarts, bribing the Ministry, bringing back the Dark Lord. It never works.”
It was understandable. They were going through a very unique and frightening experience together. Even though Harry had been with them from the beginning, and even though he wasn’t a stranger to death either, he wasn’t sharing this with them.
The wizards seemed to accept the name as properly magical, and if the situation weren’t so dire, Harry would laugh at Draco’s expression. Heck, he would laugh at his own cheek, too.
“Six inches, golden oak. Mmh, very unusual choice.”
Harry swallowed and nodded. “Yes.” He smiled, because the mere mention of Draco brought a smile to his face. “Luna suggested him. I needed someone really intelligent to help me with research. He figured out there was something off about Quinn.”
The rest stood there, gaping stupidly and looking at their own wounds.
The calm of the yard. The calm that says: I won’t be hurt today.
He is an idiot.
Six months after the end of the war Draco receives a note from Percy saying that the tea and coffee are horrible in the States but he is staying there anyway. Draco arrives to the States a year after Percy, officially so they can complain about the tea together. They don’t bother pretending that this will be a short visit, though. Draco has nowhere to go and nowhere to be, he may as well be around the only other person who knows what Draco went through.
She had, because she had woken up early, but she wouldn’t be opposed to having a second cup of tea with the others. So Harry went to prepare breakfast and took the laundry basket with him to get all the towels and handkerchiefs cleaned.
Monday is Percy contacting the goblin London clan and saving them from being rounded up and killed.
“Scarlet is going to marry Frank Kennedy!”
gets himself a new friend other than Draco. No. And if someone is going to profit from his newfound happiness, then that should be his family and no one else.
Honestly, that sounded a lot like Lily Evans. Sure, Harry hadn’t met her, and all he had heard about her was how beautiful and talented and kind she was. But she had also been aggressively lower class, aggressively defensive of what she was, and that was good.
Luna arrived at dinner time. She had more spicy bread (Harry had tried a tiny piece, it was horrible), flower water (whatever that was) and the thought that honey might help. She would see if she could get her hands on a particularly good jar.
” Draco explained that night, as they were preparing for bed.
“Luna, I don’t…” Harry began to say. It wasn’t exactly late. Harry didn’t mind answering calls before midnight. But it was late.
“Oh my god. I did, didn’t I?”
Draco gasped and rubbed against Harry’s thigh. His mouth still had that sharp quality to it, that smartness at the corners. His eyes were half-lidded and languid and Harry had never seen them like this, so tranquil.
Someone watched as Harry and Draco exited the house. Someone had stayed there since the previous night. Someone had to come to a quick decision: following them or turning to the house. The house had a big prize inside, but capturing and killing Harry would also be a delicious prize. The young man was bound to have a particular taste, something sparky and powerful.
It wasn’t Malfoy at the door. Of course it wasn’t Malfoy. Malfoy had made it very clear that he had no intention of getting involved in the matter and it was absurd to expect him to change his mind so quickly and radically. Harry hadn’t expected it and he wasn’t disappointed. He had had no expectations whatsoever when he opened the door.
He got the right arm first.
You search. You look for seventh sons and daughters and even for the seventh son of a seventh son. You look for, and find, and devour, a werewolf heart and it puts muscle around your bones. You slain a giant and bath in his blood and your body becomes warmer. You make a mermaid giver her soul in a scream. You almost (almost!) catch a phoenix. You drink a potion made out of the eyes of a vampire and the regret of a mother.
At this point, David Wadia had no idea of what the topic even was and Tonks was humming “God Rest Ye Merry Hippogriffs.” He looked down at his notes.
Ollivander’s shop burns. It takes four days to extinguish the fire, fed by all the wand materials in the shop.
“A place under many charms,” said Draco. He was clutching the napkin very hard. “Somewhere that magic can’t reach.”
“Godric!” hissed Helga Hufflepuff. Well, the statue of Helga Hufflepuff. It was unclear whether or not they were one and the same. The statue of Rowena Ravenclaw was sure that her flesh counterpart had been taller.
She was bad, but she might not have been. She might have been a crazy old woman living by herself in the mountains. It seemed to Harry that not going to Hogwarts and not owning a comb had been enough to have her searched.
“I dreamed that he found out and sent all his Death Eaters after me.” Regulus said very softly and Harry felt his heart squeeze. There was no question about who he was. They didn’t need any more details, really.
Fenton came running to greet Harry and then he left just as fast to oversee the tea-making process in the kitchen.
Harry was accused of being extremely stern and rigorous. No one had ever been this inflexible. Not even Moody. Not even Sisyphus Gale who was the duelling instructor of the good families and later of the Death Eaters. The man who had taken the raw rock that was Bellatrix Lestrange and cut her and beat her until she became a diamond. The man who had made Severus Snape a slippery bastard impossible to pin down with a spell. The man who had made Travers and Yaxley wizards to be feared and dreaded, unstoppable and devastating.
“It’s my inner slytherin” he said anyway, because it was still cold, outside and inside the flat. “How was it that you said? Cunning and, um, ambition! For the very best things”.
ooOoo
Harry showed it to him.
Besides, it wasn’t like Draco had all the answers. He couldn’t tell him why Voldemort would want a one year old dead. (
They went back to the car.
“Hey, Harry! Good to see you! It has been too long. Ron is in the back, near the singing hats.”
, the press and the public in general went even more rabid. You would think that with so many shocking stories the scandals would dull each other. But, far from that, the public is on fire,
Damian disappeared and Luna waited, lying on her stomach and knocking her feet together. A few minutes later a woman’s head appeared in the fireplace.
Oh, I don’t know. Perhaps the fact that Lorelei Kyteler developed sudden cramps in her arm and legs that left her incapacitated to apparate or floo to the Ministry the day we were voting the werewolf proposal.
death. Anything to stop the pain.
telling them about Crabbe’s multiple failings during the years.
Alice Longbottom did like the roses, but the one who really enjoyed the garden was Frank. While in St. Mungo he had been the most quiet of the two of them, but in here he seemed to come awake. He liked working in the garden and there is always a lot to do in one. From picking the chestnuts to pulling bad weeds to fighting back the mint taking over the other herbs. His cheeks became rosy and his eyes acquired a shine they hadn’t had in years.
“I was checking on them, as you asked me to,” Draco answered coolly. He was smiling, though. One of those beautiful smiles he so seldom let them see.
You are powerful, but you are not strong.
In the corridor outside they could hear better. There was a voice yelling over the screams. It said things like who did she think she was, and that someone was just a stupid daft cow, and lessons would be taught, particularly to stupid daft cows who bragged about their miserable success when their only talent was to shake their fat asses on screen.
. Sure, he was playing saviour, offering Draco his help, but he had also retreated, he had looked at Draco with different eyes.
and it looked at all of it attentively.
“Ingredients. Do you need any ingredients, Malfoy?”
Yes. I even got letters and testimonies from Hogwarts professors and students saying how great Lupin was. Kingsley gave him a posthumous Order of Merlin, first class.
Twas the night before Christmas and all was quiet in the Granger’s house. Not the house they had sold so they could move to Australia, that one had increased in value and they couldn’t buy it back. This was a new one, smaller and in a different city, north of London.
“Three hours ago,” Regulus admitted. He had either spent the night at Luna’s cottage or with Fred and George. “Did you know? I had a nightmare with a giant lobster.”
Look, reverting to the yard years also meant suspecting everything. When had they ever been wrong doing that?
“Are they?”
for other workers. It upset them.
he wanted to look, but he didn’t know if he should or if he should at least attempt to be less obvious. Malfoy stopped for a second after he got the sweater over his head and looked at him with brows raised.
) the books she currently had in her backpack.
Not a bad thing. Not something wicked. No, no.
Harry smiled with relief. “Please, come on in. It has been so weird.”
The return to Malfoy Manor was a bit cold. Father was not impressed with him because he was number two in his year, behind a muggle born no less.
One had died in darkness, in the water.
“Is that why you aren’t with the girl anymore?” purred Regulus.
Snape disagreed. He hadn’t had much opportunity to speak with other death eaters, and Voldemort certainly didn’t encourage them revealing their identities to each other, but he was still on good standing and other than the plan to take over the Department of Mysteries first and the Ministry as a whole on second place, he didn’t know of anything else.
Which was an extremely odd praise but also not far from the truth. Harry did have a calming effect.
But Harry wasn’t all right. Harry was hungry and tired and had a black eye from his last encounter with Dudley’s gang. He knew it wasn’t that bad, but somehow it had become too much.  Lately they were making some noise about Aunt Marge coming, and Harry remembered how during her last visit one of her bulldogs chased Harry into a tree and she had refused to call him off until past midnight.  Despite being late June it had not been a warm night and Harry spent all summer coughing.
as well as special issues 17, 21, 22 and 25. Draco Malfoy earned 1.5 million galleons with issue 33, setting a record for most successful print in wizarding history. Then he obliterated that record with a single stolen picture of Percy and Oliver’s wedding. He committed around a dozen crimes to get that picture, got drunk on champagne and victory and asked Harry Potter to marry him.
“WHAT?”
In the end, the Harpies got the snitch but the Puddlemere won and Ron went to visit Harry to get out of the way.
Draco was learning something too.
“Stay back. We don’t know that she is the real Luna.”
He thanked them, scratched his forehead, and rose to leave. As an afterthought he asked if Pit had any distinctive marks.
So Neville had said yes.
. And who suggested we may not want to talk to the rest?”
He opened his eyes to the corridor of the house, a huge silver deer standing by his side. A glance over his shoulder showed him the rugged stone of the cell behind him, the blood stains on the floor, but before him was the real thing.
“Respectful”. He repeated dutifully in the same tone in which he would recite the four rules of transfiguration to McGonagall.
If Harry had grabbed his hand, would he have stayed? Could Harry have stopped him?
Mort passed him his hoody so he could hide his hair, and they ran to The Tube, number one protection from all things magical. Mostly because wizards have a very hard time understanding the ticket machine and the turnstile.
As Ginny had said, smiling over a pint, her tongue darting to lick the foam on her lips, her family had taken their break-up far worse than either of them. Actually, Ginny and Harry had been relieved. It wasn’t working out and it wasn’t anyone’s fault. They simply didn’t click that way and it was good that they realised it before they accidentally hurt each other.
You saved my life and I couldn’t even thank you.-
To be fair, all three times I was paired with the same person, so we could call it just one extended failure. And he happens to be my life-long nemesis. That’s asking a lot, don’t you think? It’s one thing to get to know and maybe even befriend the person who wanted you and your kind dead, it’s another thing to befriend the guy who broke your nose and left you petrified on the Hogwarts Express.
Draco and Ronald Wesley,
His friends were gone. The adults (he was an adult now, even if he still was surprised that he could dispose of his own money and order a pint at the bar) never cared or understood.
Remus looked at the thermos, but the grinning pumpkins had no help to offer.
Right at Harry’s feet was a bent and twisted fire poker. There was also blood, a mixture of drops and a dragging pattern going from the middle of the living room to the foyer where it made a big puddle. Then a trail of blood went towards the back of the house, to the stairs and the door to the library.
“Something is wrong,” Draco said at last. His voice was different, more open and relaxed even when his face was tense and he too had taken his hand to his wand. “I don’t know what it is. Have you been
to busineeeess! To DEFEAT! The HUNS!”
“I am extremely upset about everything today, starting with Patricia last night.” Said Harry. The apple pie was gone but he wanted to wait a little before going for the cookie.
He still thought about how Draco was paying for his groceries, about how cheap his house looked, about his clothes. If Harry could be certain that Draco would take it, rather than bashing Harry’s face with it, he would give him ten thousand galleons and live with his wrath. Harry could take Draco’s hate and anger if it meant that Draco would have the means to support himself and wouldn’t have to resort to selling himself.
was too riled up to go to sleep yet.
Harry said, “Yes,” and then, “no,” because he knew that Draco needed money but Draco had refused it. It had been curiosity more than anything that brought him back. Curiosity and kindness towards the others. From what Draco said, and given that at first he only came a couple of hours each day, he had kept working at his mysterious odd-hours job.
“What in Merlin’s name did we just watch?”
But, the thing was, as absurd and illogical as they were, many of them seemed to work. Harry’s, not Mrs Tarry’s.
Harry had gotten used to questioning people’s motives for some reason. Probably all the deception.
“Oh, can I?” Regulus asked, considerably merry given the implication there. He had no magic anymore, he wasn’t a wizard. The Knight Bus was for wizards.
Harry asked about it innocently and kindly, wanting to help if he could. He asked because he liked both of them and also because he liked Dean a bit more. Dean had always supported him while Seamus did not during the Umbridge year (not that Harry held a grudge, but, well, it didn’t exactly help his trust issues). Dean had also offered to fake Vernon’s signature, which was awfully nice, and they had come across each other during the war, they had shared experiences then.

revenue is deposited directly. It takes a while for
he had to worry about creating a code so he would know that it was really her and Draco coming back.
He was…
For comparison: McGonagall could spot a daydreaming student on the back on the room with her back turned.
They walked back to King’s Cross and to the tube station there. Mort explained how to get his very own single ride ticket for the yellow line.
He had to look away, to the tall shelves full of books that he found so reassuring. Malfoy was blessedly quiet.
Sirius stared at the clear spot in the wall where the portrait of his mother used to be. The same enchanted portrait that no matter what they did no one managed to remove. That one.
The pigmy rabbit might be Draco’s fault. After Roderick’s fiasco, Draco decided to acquire a properly fluffy and cute pet for Teddy. But apparently pygmy bunnies have enough rodent-like qualities to scare Teddy, so Draco has Ferdinand’s wardenship until such a time when Teddy is grown past his silly rodent aversion and realizes how cute Ferdinand is.
A raspy voice and guitar chords came from the radio telling about a woman who had
What.
Oh, clever, clever woman. Forget about a first kiss, Harry was going to kiss her right now, because she had asked if Harry had won but she had been knocked out for it so she was checking! She was checking that Harry was really who he said he was and she had gotten up and was searching with her eyes for Regulus and Fred.
las night and there was much to discuss. (Draco thought Hamlet’s problem wasn’t his father’s murder but that his mum was having sex with someone else; Harry just wished there was more about Fortinbras). Neville had discovered that
An old woman who had also been at the cinema, noisily eating and apple, interrupted then.
It didn’t matter that it was all a lie. What mattered was that Harry believed it. What mattered was that Harry hadn’t known that lie when Draco first kissed him, and once he had heard, he had stepped back.
“What about the money?”
“Cedric? An animagus?”
There was something about Regulus, though, something about the way he spoke and moved and looked at the world that was much more than Sirius. Much more
All this took just one second. Harry told them to move away from the door, turned around and aimed his wand at the hole in the wall. Flames erupted from his wand. Not like the cute little spell Harry had taught them, that was just a flame, singular. These were flames, plural, flames like an arson, flames like a picture of a dragon in a medieval book, big and orange and curly, reaching like tendrils or tongues.
“Yes? …yes! Asked her out at fourteen. Wouldn’t even look at me. She pushed me in to a puddle”
“What is it? Harry! Harry! What?”
Harry thought that he had never seen Malfoy with such a pure expression on his face. He had seen him mad, scared, amused, he had seen him bored in class and joking with his friends. But there had always been something guarded and deliberate about him, as if he were wearing a mask. Even that night in the tower with Dumbledore and Snape, even then Malfoy had tried to control his expression.
and the headlines were the only reason he got the paper.
The glasses were excellent. Harry couldn’t believe he had been out of focus for so long. Now everything took on a sharp quality, no softness to blur the ugly details. It felt hard and so, so, right.
“Thank you,” said Harry. “That was very illustrative.”
George, like the rest of the world, had been sure that she and Ron would get together and had resigned himself to a life of secret agony. But now, after seeing that Hermione was actually good friends with Ron’s girlfriend, he began to think he might have a chance after all.
Snape pushed his sleeve up and laid his arm flat on the table. The dark mark was starkly visible, dark pink over his white skin.
So he had given Draco his wand back and Draco had said his thanks and they had parted ways. That must have been… seven or eight years ago. Harry thought they must have crossed paths in between, exchanged a few polite nods in the distance, but he certainly hadn’t been tracking the trajectory of one Draco Malfoy. Not when he had been going through the Auror Academy and then through his first cases as an Auror with the added weight of being Harry Potter The Boy Who Slayed You Know Who. His mistakes weighed twice as much as those of any other novice.
Remus and Severus were sitting in their living room where a Christmas tree stood defying all norms of physics since there was no possible place where the tree could stand and yet there it was. They were now attempting to bend those norms further by putting wrapped gifts underneath.
ooOoo
Percy was better help. Percy, who for the first time in years came to the family meal on Sundays. The first meal in a very long time in which everybody in the family was there, since Charlie had come unexpectedly to the country. They didn’t have their house anymore but the Order safe-house where their parents had been staying worked well enough. They didn’t fit in the small living room and the table extended into the corridor and the kitchen which made it all the more familiar, that feeling of being crumpled.
“You are a weirdo”

uses. LIGHT AN DARK. HERO POTTER SUCCUMBS TO DARK HERO MALFOY. And look, if the whole country is going to believe Harry has fallen to Draco’s wiles, if people are going to snicker about it, the least Harry deserves is to get some. So he immediately apparates to Draco’s office and demands to be kissed which Draco is happy to do.
wasn’t there so the interested party stepped closer, got right by the window, pressed a face (it had a face!) against the brick wall. Took a deep breath.
Regulus had been so incensed when the crossword was done and it became evident that the answer was “oni” and nothing else, that Harry had taken him and Fred upstairs without argument and drawn them a bath. He was regretting not having gotten a wider variety of soaps. Something with an extravagant name and a tangerine trace. Instead all he had was the lavender soap and the citrus shampoo.
Only wizards think in wizard terms.
tries to take itself seriously, their reputation is too damaged.
He goes to Romania every summer to visit Charlie. The girls love it there and it was always easy to talk to Charlie. Charlie who had such a promising career in Quidditch and rejected the fame and fortune for a thankless career working with dragons. Not even training dragons for bank security, which is a cool and profitable career, but fighting that very same use.
“I know how to clean this,” Fred said. For the first time he actually sounded like himself, like he was before his death and the war. He sounded like the happy kid who gave Harry a map and his freedom, the kid who swore they would repay Harry his generosity when he gave them the money to start their joke shop. The kid who made fun of Harry being the Heir of Slytherin.
And the cinema, for god’s sake! How was that culture living without movies? No wonder they turned to civil war and really unfortunate robes and masks. They were like passionate Star Wars fans, but with no movies to keep them entertained.
“I am looking for someone specifically,” Harry reminded them once more while Malcolm snapped picture after picture. “So if you could keep their faces mostly intact… He is about my height, black hair, don’t know if he will still have hair, lean frame.”

“So Luna said that of course you were impossible and hadn’t Draco seen your scar? You were killed twice. And Draco said he didn’t mean that. I didn’t get the rest because the water was boiling and Luna asked me to get some leaves of deadnettle and when I returned they were arguing about strawberries.”
“The key is the ceiling rebound,” Regulus said and at Harry’s befuddled expression he clarified. “When you want to throw something in class and avoid detention. You throw it at the ceiling at an angle. It will fall on that person but it won’t be obvious that it was you.”
The book was upside down. He noticed Malfoy noticing it and fighting a smile. He wondered if Malfoy knew that he had done it on purpose, grabbing the book wrong just because it would be funnier.
The mare stomped her front legs, hard, deliberately, ears back and tail swishing. She grunted. It was like the sound of an axe dragged over a rock. There was a little bit of white around the midnight eyes.
He had also gotten a small golden frame for the
Someone snapped a picture of Oliver and Percy sitting very close together in a park, with twin stupid loving smiles. It was all perfectly innocent. Molly was doing something cute out of frame and they never kept any physical distance between themselves, not even in Hogwarts. But it doesn’t matter. The picture is sold as proof of the mysterious war hero and the dashing sport star carrying a secret love affair. It’s a beautiful story, powerful. Percy is the tragic handsome hero and Oliver the right person to bring love back into his life after years nursing the wounds of war. Or perhaps Oliver is the sweet and honest good boy, the boyfriend every mother wants for her daughter, seduced by the man living a life of exotic and daring adventures.
They arrived home, Remus, Severus, Sirius, Harry and Draco, thirsty and hot, with sweat on their necks and running down their backs which is the worst kind of sweat. They all had an itchy feeling that made them want to crawl out of their skins.
“Harry…”
He had kept saving, though. He still couldn’t afford wolfsbane by himself but he could do some repairs to his cottage and transform there. And now he could fund his little side project.
Harry frowned at Regulus and specially Fred, who was the one that had called for Luna’s attention. Everyone had to wait a long time because first they had to get upright, and grab their wands, and sit together and then decide that they would rather stand up only Regulus found that difficult so he had to rest against something.
The trick was that Sirius, who liked leather jackets and motorbikes and muggle music, didn’t pretend that the wizarding world was better. He didn’t expect her to fall in love with it and instead was happy to go to each and every one of her games. He cheered without being an embarrassment and when other parents shouted a bit too much, or when a middle-age man came to stare at their shorts-clad legs (he was always middle-aged and a bit balding, no matter the city. Usually different men but there were a couple of them who followed their tour and made the coach frown terribly), in those cases Sirius stood very close to them grinning The Black Grin and the parents stopped being a bloody nightmare and the creepy men went away and never returned.
If both Remus and Harry wanted to do something then it was done. Sirius dropped an arm over both of his favourite Slytherins and ignored their protests while he levitated a camera so he could take a picture of the three of them in matching red and gold clothes.
’s crosswords from the last three years. Regulus had looked ridiculously happy when Harry handed it to him although the happiness was short-lived because the book got its pages wet and creased inside the hour and had blood stains on the cover. Luna said that it shouldn’t matter, that the book wasn’t going to keep its pristine state for long anyway. Then she sat on the floor, by Regulus’ sofa, and began to fill in a crossword with him. It was almost cosy, a rainy Saturday night at home filling a crossword with friends some of which had been dead a week ago.
“Twelve muggles, thank you Fred. Did Lupin say at any point that the mass murderer that was purportedly coming after you was an animagus?”
“Absolutely not”
“Neville wasn’t your first kiss,” Harry said. He still wasn’t sure
Draco doesn’t particularly care. He is rich enough that he doesn’t need to work and, in any case, once they finally start proper investigations and find Dumbledore’s trove of notes and testimonies in his sealed will, Draco will be exonerated and recognised as the hero he is. This insult or punishment, whatever you call the Tribunal’s unfair treatment of him, doesn’t hurt. Draco is immune to their attacks.
There was, but it entailed listening to a twenty-minute dissertation on wand evolution first, followed by fifteen minutes of the wandmaking tradition of the Ollivander family and yet another twenty minutes on the petty fights and arguments and grudges of the family. Harry’s feet were tired.

ooOoo
They learned that under certain circumstances Draco could levitate small objects. It was probably Draco, because Mort had been busy giving him a blowjob at the time, and he couldn’t multitask that well. Plus, Draco had wanted to get his sketchbook, to capture Mort’s image on paper. He didn’t get to do that, of course, because Mort did something with his tongue right
with the grease on that first frying pan. But after a lot of scrubbing Harry had left it cleaner than anyone had ever seen it in years and so he had secured two dinners a week for the price of a clean kitchen and bathroom.
“It is just
A silver rabbit hopped out of the forest. Wait, no; it was very big for a rabbit and its ears were too long. A hare, then, followed closely by a very big silver cat that seemed to have paws two sizes too big. Harry wasn’t sure but he thought that its ears ended in tuffs, like a lynx, but this really wasn’t the time to identify animals with precision. The hare hopped around in a big circle, jumping at the birds that immediately began to fly higher.
She saw Harry look at her and she seized the opportunity, asking if perhaps there was something he wanted to share. She didn’t get much further because the others asked, requested and demanded that he give satisfactory and comprehensive explanations to their questions.
Except with the Dursleys.
There was a point. What was the point? Oh, right. Look it there, Malfoy
Harry would faint already. He wished he didn’t have to feel the cold wind and the jostles of the broom as he veered to avoid their pursuers.
“How are you?” asked Draco softly as he came inside. His eyes were very soft which wasn’t something one associated with grey eyes like his. Grey eyes were steel and iron and unyielding, grey eyes had a storm in them that forewarned of terrible things to come.
“Yes?” Harry said simply to the gold-blue-red (and one green spot) mass.
And then, there is Percy Weasley. Neither Snape nor Draco are supposed to know about him, but they both know and it is unclear how. Probably Percy himself let them know (no, he didn’t). He would do something like that (no, he wouldn’t). Percy is a horrid nightmare (he… he may be). Dumbledore despises him (and how!). Snape will talk about Dumbledore not doing the greater sacrifice but Dumbledore honestly can’t think of anything worse than working with Percival Weasley.
Then he went to wash the breakfast dishes.
“I am sure that if you think about it, Padfoot, you will recall I was right there by your side the whole time”.
were happy. Harry laughed and let his broom sway free so he could fly making an eight pattern around the dragon formation. There was an exhilarating feeling going around and Harry could hear some
“Okay. Let’s do something about it. It’s at a wedding, right?”
“Okay, stop now” said Draco when they got to the end of the street. He put down the big Waterstones bag he was carrying and turned toward him, taking his hand.
There was the small household maintenance he did for the old folks in Cricklewood. He only had to go twice a week to take the garbage, trim the hedges and bring some of the heavier groceries. It wasn’t that different from all the household chores he had had to do at the Dursleys and although they didn’t pay much Harry like the air of normalcy. If you spent too much time in the yard, you forgot how the proper world spoke and thought.
“Harry Potter” Voldemort breathed the words letting them roll out of his mouth like smoke.

body, the one you had before, it’s weak and thin and almost bursting at the seams from the raw magic it contains. But you never cared much about physical aspects. Bodies are just a vessel to contain you conscience and your magic.
There really wasn’t much to say. They had tried, it didn’t work. It was everyone else who had a problem and kept looking for a reason.
He goes to East Asia because Percy is vaguely aware that a single white man in need of enlightenment and self-discovery should go climb a mountain on Asia. Percy doesn’t climb any mountains, though, because he can never do things as he is supposed to. There must always be a twist. In this case, he gets food poisoning twice and spends over a month trying to learn how to play a plucked string instrument. He is harassed by a flock of geese and meets a talking dragon. He fails to realise that there are no accounts of talking dragons in history (at least the history badly learned and repeated in wizarding Britain). Dragons do not talk nor do they speak. Your brother works in a freaking dragon reserve, for Merlin’s sake, Percy. You should know this.
“Are you saying something, Snivelus?”
“What are we talking about?” asked Fred. The left side of his mouth was hanging a bit low.
Harry rubbed a hand against his tired face. “This isn’t working,” he said in a low tone. “I don’t— ”
He had assumed that Harry knew, of course, because it seemed to be in every wizard’s mouth. He didn’t know what to think when Saint Potter of all people snatched him from the street, but he still thought Harry knew. Then Draco had wondered if perhaps Harry didn’t know after all, the way he acted. Later he had decided that Harry knew and didn’t care.
Fred was happy enough because the soap created a nice lather. He was back at building himself a beard and, for some reason, nipple warmers.
“Cedric is also animagus” announced Krum like a big old mountain that could suddenly speak.
“Hehehe,” Fred laughed with a deep and masculine tone but the same ring of a child that had just discovered fart jokes. Today’s cartoon strip was good. All Harry could see, upside down, was the dog and his wizard talking to a witch with a big hat.
“Scoot!” Harry said, accompanied by a gesture of his head. He turned around, looking back at the hole in the wall. He could still see part of the forest even as the walls of the living room seemed to be growing back. He didn’t know if what he was seeing was real, if they had been there, or if it was all an illusion, or if it was a real illusion like Dumbledore would say. The
“I will”
Look at Voldemort.
“My birthday is this weekend.” Said Draco out of nowhere. The thought had just come to his mind. “Wizards come of age at seventeen. So I will be able to practice magic without setting up any alarms. And as long as we are in a wizarding building, we can do magic safely”.
Her words became much clearer then, when, after Sirius walked her back to her house, she invited him in, took him to the bedroom, pushed him flat on his back and proceed to demonstrate the kind of rides she preferred.
There are rules governing the universe but often times those rules are so absurd and convoluted that saying “because” is easier than following the obscure logic that explains how they work. Besides, it is an ever-changing logic so what works one minute won’t the next.
Luna not to send her) with a note from George Weasley telling him to disregard everything and demand that Harry give him a fruit basket and his very own orchestra.
(Fred started a campaign to convince Angelina Johnson to take the name Fffrrdrrfdd upon their marriage).
“You have to service them right here in an alley” Venus explained.
Unlike with Aeneas, there was proof that Kreacher had gotten a hold of bloody Malfoy and that not opening Harry’s very carefully written letter was deliberate. Harry had requested an answer and he had gotten one, written in pencil on the back of the envelope.
A blue diamond shaped curse came spiralling through the flames and almost sliced Harry in half. The curse reached the mantelpiece and slashed through it, breaking the marble and whatever decorations had been in there. The room was starting to fill with smoke.
“Uh, Mister Potter, sir,” said the man, taking a small step back. The chilly winter wind reminded Harry that he was only wearing pyjamas. He thought it might be the pair with fat orange dragons Ron had given him as a joke. He wasn’t looking down at himself to check.
Harry was doing well, though. He had taken Hermione’s decision as an inspiration to get his life sorted. Ron had taken it worse. Even if they had already broken up when Victor came around with his offer, to Ron it still felt like a betrayal and like abandonment. It had also brought back some of his ugly feelings from Harry’s and Ginny’s earlier break-up.
, wouldn’t let himself be beaten bloody.
They had to accept they had lost him and move on, as difficult as that was. Remus insisted on sending Arthur back to work, because the man certainly couldn’t afford getting on his supervisor bad side. Remus would call for Dumbledore.
” Harry read. “
“Magenta,” Harry answered quickly, because he was sure for once. He was
Remus had not been in the first emergency meeting after Harry’s disappearance. But he had asked about it during the later years as they reported their findings. He had made a mental list.
“They like you,” Luna informed him.
On day nineteen, they kiss. Someone gets a picture of it, but, in his excitement, the photographer wanders into a nest of young dragon carps. He is recued three hours later sans pants or shoes. The photo of their first kiss is lost.
Well, Dumbledore had left Grindelwald live, and Harry had pardoned quite a few lives, allowed a couple of suspects to escape… He had helped Draco, although by the time he got him out of the burning room Draco had already shown some good qualities so he hardly counted as an enemy. Not like that wild mountain witch who had stabbed Harry twice, and he still let her go.
here at the WWN” said the voice of the host, carefully modulated to sound nice while being completely absent of significant emotions. “I am David Wadia, and we are having a special program to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts.”
Regulus had turned to look at Harry, waiting for confirmation. He had known Sisyphus Gale well. Had been his student.
Malfoy petted Aeneas on the head, one careful and long stroke of his hand. Then the owl hopped on his right arm and stayed there looking happy while Malfoy opened the window and told him where to go.
Draco’s second year at Hogwarts saw a small improvement and then descended quickly in to Not Good territory when he was almost killed by a monster unleashed at the school by his father’s meddling. He was saved by that dirty Granger whom Draco had been following to see what exactly did she do to get such good grades. Whatever she did, it left her spare time to figure out the nature of Slytherin’s monster and warn Draco just as they left the library and turned the corner.
The two hours had almost passed, but there was still enough time for two bodies to meet and nuzzle and sigh and move together, right there over the dusty carpet. There was enough time to be slow at it, to kiss and kiss and caress every red mark, every bruise.
They agreed it was better if Harry just left and they avoided any future confrontation. His voluntary leave made them almost allies when his remaining would make them enemies. It was good, this parting on good terms. A rare thing.
Harry begins to believe the unbelievable. Draco admits that Goyle has no virtues, but Draco is still relentless in his search and insists that, in a way, Goyle is his responsibility. There is affection there, and tenderness, even when Draco says that Goyle is ambitious and stupid and that is a deadly combination. Draco says he owes it to Goyle, because poor stupid Goyle would have done the same for him.
He went to bring the painting back from its safe storage in the kitchen. After a moment of thought he took it to the library rather than the living room. That room was too bare now and Harry thought that he would be spending more time in the library.
“See. You don’t want to give your real name, that’s good. But you need to give one. Think of something similar to your own name, so you will always remember to answer” the boy explained patiently. Draco’s attention was divided between his hair and his eyes. Was there any green in the hair too? He could only see the pink and blue and yellow. “Understood?”
were gone already.
and take a painful, painful breath that felt as if their lungs were full of needles and sand.
Most of the things they needed could be acquired in charity shops or transformed from other things and even if right now they were a bit clunky, Harry was sure they would become better. There was a bathroom in each floor. He liked the stairs (they could hang pictures in the wall there). The kitchen had a big counter. And there was a living room with floorboards instead of the usual ugly carpets, wide and airy and full of light. And when Harry smiled at the windows they turned out to have long white lace curtains that perhaps weren’t there a second ago.
(Ron said he mimicked Harry and didn’t say anything other than Percy had to come with him, but apparently that was enough for Percy to worry.)
There are certain actions, small and habitual, that are very satisfying. Putting a hot pan in cold water. Stepping on ice. Crunching leaves! In this case, Harry liked the mute hard sound of the teacup as he put it in the wooden side table.
“Well” he tried to turn towards the voice and gave up soon. He could barely stand as it was. One big fellow with very unfortunate skin had been tasked with holding him upright. Most likely because he hadn’t said anything during the brief power fight. “No. I do not attend that school. I never said I was British”.
Draco and Fred scoffed. Regulus grabbed his left arm with his right to put his left hand over his forehead with difficulty. “
and would always, invariably, correct you if you mixed roman and greek mythological names. So
”) vetoed three different locals that not-Marco pointed at random, until he agreed to go to a pub which had an acceptable background noise and a table with a good view of the door.
Did she imagine the tiny pause Hermione made?
Harry could not name another Head of the Department of Mysteries.
“I love you. Don’t go.”
They go to Hogwarts. You would think that in this timeline Harry would be the most belligerent/hostile of them, but it is actually Hermione. Hermione is a nightmare student. She has a list of one hundred and fifty names and she is going to save all of them (except maybe Dumbledore and Snape). She has no time nor attention to waste in silly classes telling her what she already knows. She only comes to class sporadically, aces all her tests and hands out beautiful neat homework that barely took ten minutes out of her day to complete. Teachers hate her (or heavily dislike her), but they can’t expel her. It’s beautiful. The twins develop a crush on her.
Not a place to live, exactly, as it was an open space between two abandoned buildings and little in the way of walls and roof. But a place to stay.
Draco tilted his head. “Perhaps. But it would have to be from his mother’s side.”
Fred was trying to build himself a lather beard while listening to Harry intently.
Harry had spent his third year at Hogwarts obsessing over that voice. Craving to hear it even though it was painful, like a burn, like a cut. He had learned to cast a
“It didn’t do anything for Voldemort, did it?”
“Oy! Oy Lupine man” said a high pitched voice. Remus had to squint and still barely recognized the owner as Samantha Fick.
“Ron, she was your sister first” said Olivia. “You cheer for her.”
“Ambition, I believe, was the key trait in this sorting” answered Snape who, in an uncharacteristic chatty mood, was
Considering it was only his second day on the case Harry had already learned a lot, but it still felt like too little. He had a name and some dates on a tapestry when he needed the story of a life.
“I thought Bill?” Harry’s knees were starting to protest so he sat on the floor, his side against the bathtub and a hand daintily touching the warm water. “He has long hair and an earring.”
“What!” exclaimed Harry, the moment he apparated in the little street of Haverhill, all senses of alarm rising.
“What?”
They didn’t ride on top of the dragons, although they would have allowed it. However, they were half-blind and scared from anything resembling fire so they couldn’t see where to go nor did they want to follow any magic lights marking the way. Instead, Harry and Draco flew next to them in their brooms, guiding and herding them through the dense grey of the English night. Harry was Harry so they were happy to follow him, and Draco had hair that seemed made of silver thread and gold accents so they were all quite happy to go with him too no questions asked.
No, that was wrong.
He was still the man who made a fortune with kid’s sweat and women’s tears and white powder and blood. Nice is not good.
“It was lonely at times, but that is not necessarily bad. I can tell you, the times I wished I had met my parents and could talk to them weren’t the times I was sad”.

“No drummers, Harry.”
Harry didn’t hold any high hopes. Most of them were going to eat them right away. But some would store it safely, for the bad days, and perhaps no one would ever be as desperate as Ratty had been.
“She was unbelievably rude,” he said, firm and strong. The only strong thing about the frail young man. “I didn’t know her much, mind you. She was in another year.”
Harry told him about Charlie. That he was still in Romania. That someone in the family had started a rumour that he had a tattoo. That he was still single.
By now the arching phase had passed. Because Harry could now distinguish the phases, oh yes. After stiffening his whole body and almost levitating right out of where he was lying, Fred started to shake and jerk as if he had been hit with a hex. He had foam forming on his mouth.
When she was behind locked doors and a layer of spells for secrecy, she went to her bed and did something… bad.
Imagine, if you will.
Uh. What a funny image. Harry didn’t know where that came from.
“She said I looked completely hapless,” Harry said with difficulty, his chest still moving with laughter. “And as soon as she saw Hermione she said she had skinny ankles and bad posture.”
The brew had to rest for a while. In the meantime Harry fixed a sandwich for himself, got
Somewhere in the streets nearby there was an old clock tower giving the hour with soft chimes. It was the usual time for Luna to arrive. If she hadn’t received Harry’s note, if Aeneas hadn’t made it in time, she would have come around now. The other Luna, the Luna in the dining room with grey tights and a pink dress and her hair in a messy braid, that Luna had come with a bag of food from Tonino’s thirty minutes ago. Too fast for Aeneas, now that Harry thought about it, unless the owl had been intercepted.
A pain more intense than anything you have ever felt. A pain stronger than death. Imagine a
Harry stared, confused, and darted a look to Regulus and Fred in case they knew what was going on. Fred didn’t. Regulus looked intrigued but like he might know something.
Then, on August 20th, (Bertha will remember the date for the rest of her life), Potter comes with Granger bringing a clay pot full of silver mist. Dumbledore’s memories, he says. If Malfoy can help them find the guilty, Dumbledore will help them find the innocent.
Luna left soon after that. She had already taken a bottle of gin yesterday and she didn’t want anymore. Harry had the sensation that she took all the noise with her when she left. The house was perfectly silent. Regulus and Fred’s breath barely made any noise, soft and quiet like a newborn’s. Kreacher had been sent to bed as soon as he served them dinner (Harry could take care of the dishes) and he didn’t make any sound at all. Curled under the sofa that had become Regulus’, eyes tightly closed, he looked like a wooden figure. His skin had turned ashen in the last few years and he had many wrinkles. At least he accepted the fabrics Harry gave him so he was dressed in wool and cotton for the winter.
Fenton followed him to supervise the tea preparations and got a biscuit out of it. Harry wasn’t sure if he had provoked it in a way, if maybe he had walked slower at the landing, but Fenton had stopped there and sniffed it for a long time. Every corner of the landing step, the door and its jambs, the place where Kreacher had laid, all of it.
Harry wishes Ron and Hermione were here. Draco makes a wonderful Gilderoy.
“What, all of them?”
Draco looked very grateful when Harry came back with the tea. Regulus was singing Harry’s virtues on one side, apparently very impressed with the way he had fought the, um, not-Luna, while Fred informed him that he had his vision back but for a few hours he had had powers and could tell the doppelgängers apart.
Draco left. Harry went to write a note to Luna to tell her about the detour to Diagon Alley. It was a bit late to send Aeneas; Harry hoped that the owl would get there before she left.
Greyback couldn’t say if the Dark Lord was pleased or not from his tone. His voice was like the susurrus of the wind rustling old leaves.
It was a lot to take in, but there was more. The hiding, the Fidelius charm, the switch nobody knew about and the betrayal… If only Sirius hadn’t changed things, if they had gone along with Dumbledore’s plan…
“I—I didn’t know you were an artist,” Harry admitted, his head hitting the bed. It was so fucking obvious now. Draco had drawings on his skin and paint on his face and a special way of looking at the world. “But I guess it suits you.”
The four statues examined the umbrella closely. They oohed and aaahed and Ravenclaw asked whether he noticed any changes in how it worked and Godric asked if anyone had ever noticed that it was a wand and also if he could bring one of the firebirds closer, he really wanted to pet one.
“I could give them one?” Harry suggested. “That woman, Marlowe, she was knocking at the door for over an hour. I could tell them I will talk to them if they leave you alone. If that’s something that you want.”
“Probably goblin-related,” Draco said, taking a step back and dropping his arms. “But that’s what they always say when something iffy happens, that it was the goblins. If they were pressed for money, then it might be.”
Harry didn’t give her any respite.
Quinn screamed like iron does before turning to steel, he screamed as if the sound itself, the mere fact that he was screaming were damaging to him. He turned and bent over himself because, no matter his ability to heal all wounds and damage, he had felt it. He was in pain. Draco was on the floor, gasping, and looking immensely relieved and scared. There was an open cut high on Draco’s chest because the curse was a bit loose on who exactly the target was. Draco’s right hand was searching for his wand even while he was still trying to figure out what had happened and why was he in pain. Harry could kiss him just for that, for immediately reaching for his wand.
” Draco swallowed. “They are obviously not muggles”.
Draco looked amused and very pretty. He had such a pretty face. His eyes had all the best of winter in them.
“They could argue that you are denying them adequate treatment,” Malfoy said. He was sitting in one of the armchairs, looking down at Regulus and Fred. He had accepted a cup of tea which Harry considered a success. “But then they would have to take them to St Mungo’s.”
Oh, if Sirius were a bit younger and unspoiled by Azkaban… And if only she were ten years older or so… What a woman she was going to be! Alas…
The wand was where she had dropped it by the doormat. Harry had never seen anyone apparate or disapparate without a wand, although it was said that Grindelwald had been able to do it.
(And if he was going to have them, could he be allowed to
Ron pushed away from the wall, full of energy, and went and took Percy by the arm, shook Regulus’ hand, and steered everybody outside.
“There is no point,” he said, sounding unfairly calm and blasé.
Harry saw a couple of dog toys in the grass outside. There was also a broomstick near the door, so they talked about that, about broomsticks and flying and Quidditch. Harry liked the Chudley Cannons because they were Ron’s team and he was a loyal friend, the Holyhead Harpies because Ginny played there, and now also the Puddlemere United because of Oliver Wood.
“And then he crossed his arms and said that you are impossible.”
Sirius lifted his glass, drank it, and sat down, ending the speech. He thought he had made his point very clear.
But if he pointed it to a keyhole and focused, it would unlock. Like magic.
It’s not the kind of story I write, though. But since you dropped the materials here, I can share how I would assemble it.

happened before, on the day of the battle of Hogwarts, or maybe the day after when they were all walking around dazedly and trying to start the clean-up.
“I like that McGonagall girl” said Helga at last. There were some murmurs of agreement. Yes. Occasionally, the McGonagall girl exhibited some sense.
“I really don’t think he will talk to the Ministry,” added Luna, like one might say that the tomatoes wouldn’t ripen until next week. “The Malfoys never liked the Ministry much, you know. Used it, yes, but not liked it, and after the expropriation…” She shook her head. Even if it benefited Malfoy he wouldn’t do anything that helped the Ministry. “He might try some blackmail, I don’t know. He acts very different when there aren’t people around, don’t you think?”
“It’s not like he would stop looking for us after killing you,” Regulus said with a shrug. Harry wondered if he had always spoken so bluntly or if he had picked it up from Fred.
Harry was familiar with the sentiment that goblins were behind many disappearances. However, he had been involved in over a hundred Auror cases, he didn’t know the exact number but over a hundred. He had only seen actual guilty goblins a total of three (3) occasions. Relatives wanting to accelerate an inheritance or dealing with a grudge were far more common. That, and people wanting to get rich quick and doing something very stupid even when it didn’t involve murder in the family.
“Everything all right?”
The ballroom floorboards were polished and smooth, the walls and ceiling unblemished. The only marks were the scratch of boots and the cracks from the impact of curses.
Remus was… actually Harry couldn’t remember. Gone to their old home, he believed, to see if there was anything worth salvaging and then he would go to Hogwarts. Sirius and Draco were in London. Harry had accompanied them to the funeral home but now they had to go see a lawyer and Harry had been excused from that visit. He would grow bored and restless in under a minute.
That was the right thing to say, because Draco looked so, so, grateful for the opportunity to go and do something. And Harry needed the time alone to let himself be scared and cry, breath hitched and tears in the corners of his eyes. There hadn’t been much time to be scared then, to acknowledge what was happening. He had focused on getting out, on getting Draco and running, and he had pushed to the back of his mind the lingering pain, the fear that they would do something to Draco, the terror invited by the mad smile of the witch with the knife and the hair… He had consciously rejected to think about that face, the grotesque face with red eyes; the hands like spiders coming to his face…
“Request an answer, will you?”
Malfoy (Draco) hadn’t paid her much attention. He had brought her a few books from time to time, but one day he made her hand them all back and he didn’t give her any more. Narcissa had given her a change of clothes and then forgotten about her.
Ok, so Draco would not say deliriously happy, but pretty close.
Percy sighed. He had had a wonderful day. That moment when Cedric and Krum danced on top of a table had been great. But there was still that feeling of missing something, small but very bothersome.
Luna nodded in understanding. She said that the Ministry could consider it theft of their property and she wasn’t accusing, merely pointing out the fact that Harry might have stolen something belonging to the Ministry of Magic. Well, not stolen, unlawfully appropriated. Purloined, even.
from Hogwarts and he had A Grandmother who would most likely murder him, especially if he didn’t drop her at least one letter.
He and Malfoy had retired there because—after informing them that there was a stain in the ceiling that looked like a rhinoceros fighting an octopus—Fred had slowly fallen asleep. Just like with a newborn, Harry was not disturbing what little sleep his guests got.
“You sure? Oh, thank you, Liv, you are
Malfoy asked to see the list and he stood there, very close to Harry, looking intently at the abused paper. His ponytail was over his shoulder, shining against the black wool of the sweater like a

They were coming through. In just a few seconds they would be able to see them well enough to aim…
“I… perhaps I should have,” Harry admitted, which Ron didn’t expect because he was pretty sure that it was
However, the conversation soon shifted to the fact that not-Marco, (currently looking for a cooler name), was out of school and the crazy things going down there. (Or up, Harry gathered Hog-warts was somewhere up north).
Eventually Fred stopped shaking. He huffed for breath two times before weakly grabbing the side of the sofa and awkwardly attempting to lift his head. He vomited on the floor rather than on himself which was a success. Since Malfoy was still by his head, he was the one pushing his hair back, one long narrow hand on Fred’s forehead.
“This is the letter I gave you,” Harry explained patiently. “Did you not find the address?”
“Please. We are people of class, here.”

was at Hogwarts, he always looked out for others! I am sure Sirius and Remus will love to tell you more. They were his friends at school, and he looked after them too”.
“For Merlin’s s— ” But Regulus had smiled and that was the point. Harry wasn’t letting anyone feel bad about their scars.
“Yes,” Harry said quickly. Draco looked like he had completely forgotten about the fight, the fear, the terrible blow that losing their magic ought to be, and was about to start a tirade about how Arthur Weasley must have come across a muggle using a broomstick at some point in his dull career and Fred really ought to know this. “Yes, you can fly as much as you want.”
They came close to the river, narrow, green, smelly. Not too deep, though. Deep enough that a small child could learn to swim there, if his parents didn’t mind him catching dysentery, but hardly more than waist-deep for an adult. Sirius stopped and took on the view. Then he grabbed Harry by the armpits (so small!) and tossed him down into the water while Draco watched and did
, having gotten used to it in the DA.
There, he just looked like an eager young lad doing right by his mum. Everywhere else, he gave an air of permanent calmness that often was confused with cockiness and arrogance. Not like he was judging you but as if he had already judged and wasn’t very impressed with the result.
There was someone in the garden when she came back.
(… That someone could feel something as similar as what Harry had been feeling for the last ten years! That someone could share that yearning!)
In 1784 the British government passed a law to levy taxes on men’s hats. Seeing as at the time this was a required accessory for everyone and that rich people had multiple models, they reasoned that the wealthy would pay more and it would all be very clever and fair. Not being fond of paying taxes, both manufacturers and clients stopped using hats and instead began selling and buying headgear, accessories for the head, fashion statements worn on top of one self, and any other creative name for what was still a hat. By 1811 the tax had been repealed.
, freaking Fred Weasley
non-verbally and even non-consciously because he had merely wished for light without thinking of anything else. His left hand was touching the little body, the dry and wrinkled skin.
He could have asked, “Why are you so obsessed with this when it is the least important and revealing thing about me? Why are you not asking about my schedule, my work, my reluctance to stay beyond a certain hour, my accepting food but not clothes, my daily going through a meadow and getting grass stains on my shoes? Why? Why the tattoo and not the clothes that cover it? Clothes that are worn and plain and almost muggle.”
Draco sputtered indignantly and denied any sort of admiration towards the girl whatsoever.
They did the crossword. It took them fifteen minutes to find out that a bird of the dessert was a cinnamologus and ten more to realise that Luna had known the answer the whole time and had said nothing because she was
And he spent the night very warm indeed.
Eventually, Irene Necker who, legend says, fought a Death Eater with a stapler, snarls at Potter that Sirius Black is dead but the people in her considerable pile of files are not so she will bloody see to them first and isn’t that what Potter wants? To ensure that every file is reviewed, every person given a chance to talk?
– something illegal.
“Roses, you say? I have roses!” Draco had exclaimed excitedly and sounding a bit mad, just like Sirius. “Spring and summer roses but also winter roses, very rare. Roses all year long. Forget about the house if you don’t want it, but take the terrain. It’s beautiful. My mother—” he had stopped suddenly, swallowing with difficulty. His eyes were shining. “She took very good care of the garden.”
“No.”

The point, in any case, was to make the other person pause for a second and worry about what that meant because it wasn’t a well-known spell. Whoever it was with Luna’s face looked at Harry bemusedly. She might know that the spell was innocuous, but she was confused nevertheless.
“They were saying something about my Mum,” Luna explained. “That she was dead and— I don’t know. Silly things.”
Interesting.
“I don’t hate you.” Malfoy was stupidly calm. How could he speak so calmly? So devoid of emotion, that stonehearted bastard. He was a fucking block of ice. “I just can’t help you. Potter, have you stopped to think for a second that I might have other things to do? Matters to attend to?”
“yes.”
room. With a nice dresser that he had always wanted to have and a rug by the bed so their feet would always be warm when they got up. More importantly, they painted it. (They painted the whole house, there was now paint available in so many colours!). It was pink, which was not a colour anyone would associate with either Severus or Remus, but it was just the right shade of pink to bring light to the room without making it feel cold. It was the colour of a morning in May and they both loved waking up in that room, in their bed, in each other’s arms.
This time Harry jumped in front of him and even planted a hand on Malfoy’s chest for emphasis. Malfoy gave a step back quickly, almost as if Harry’s hand had burned him. He frowned spectacularly and for the first time he looked at Harry’s face with an expression of dread and disgust. Harry didn’t know what he had been expecting but it wasn’t this, this loathing that seemed just as intense as when they were children.
Or Welsh.
Fenton climbed the rest of the stairs, apparently bored with the two men standing in silence. Harry could hear his happy quick steps on the wood floors, tracing the dog’s path to Draco’s bedroom.
and kept
But this, the Luna telling Harry that it was okay, this was a grown woman. The fact that she wasn’t wearing an ill-fitting skirt accentuated that. She wasn’t a young girl but an adult witch.
Relief, perhaps, that someone saw him as something other than James Potter’s son. James the second. James returned to pick up where he left before he died. He was Harry, not James.
There were other questions to discuss. Even if they casted the same spell under the same conditions, the wand they used would affect the results. Harry was already thinking of letting them borrow his wand so it would be the same material lent under similar conditions. Who knew the origin and allegiance of the wands in the vase?
It is a testament to how tired Bertha is that she doesn’t register that she is in a locker room with four handsome,
And Draco had fallen. It seemed that Harry was the only person who bothered to look at Draco for himself, who liked him, sins and all, and Draco had fallen fast and hard.
Fred could not hear them but he wasn’t scared. Truth was that he was too tired to be scared. He could feel Fenton’s soft head under his hand, begging for a caress, and he could see Regulus in front of him and it was enough. He asked about Regulus with a clumsy tongue that had trouble making the words and he smiled sadly when he couldn’t hear the answer. Harry mimed that Regulus was asleep and calm and Fred nodded, satisfied.
“Probably the chocolate one. But I am very fond of the buttermilk lemon and strawberry cheesecake. The pistachio one is very difficult to find.”
“Just do as you were. And let me know if there are any changes.” He had his coat on and his hand on the doorknob. His gloves were in the coat’s pockets because as much as Harry would like to enjoy his fortune,
Maybe it was because Draco still had creases of his pillow imprinted on his skin, his hair was messy and he had put his t-shirt on inside out. The Draco in Harry’s dreams never did that. This Draco was real and close and warm. The look he was giving Harry, though, that was a look from a dream.
This of course didn’t stop Harry from screaming into a pillow and repeatedly hitting himself on the head with
and a lack of morals. Percy and Oliver spend the rest of the month in the reserve, not daring to go out. Twenty-two days in each other’s company, hiking in the mountains and playing with the girls. Molly and Lucy have decided that Oliver is similar to Charlie in all the right ways, so they like him.
Surely that wasn’t true. Malfoy had been a cruel selfish bastard while Harry just wanted to get help for the two non-dead guys camping in his living room and he was willing to pay for the inconvenience of helping him.
“They don’t taste the same” Harry had said, and he was right. They didn’t. These were the ones given to him as a Christmas present and they were special. Just as this Christmas was special.
“The board house in Notting Hill still doesn’t have a computer. You can stay there for the night and they won’t enter you name until Thursday. If perchance you are in need of a place to sleep without giving your name”.
out of five judges voted to let them go free. Three would have been strange, but possible; but four is just too much,” Ron explained. “They bought the votes. Malfoy bought the votes.”
He blamed it on the stress of the last few days, the fact that he was barely seeing anyone else and the strong awareness that he should not think at all about Draco in this way so his brain was probably trying to be helpful and thinking about kissing rather than more, er, advanced things. At the very least it should save him some embarrassment later.
and see what the steam of the teapot turned into. No, he went on as always: brought a small potion for the fever that didn’t do much in lowering their temperature but helped with the associated headache and the inability to concentrate. Backed Harry when he said that it probably wasn’t a good idea for Regulus and Fred to attempt to do magic, at least not without practicing with a twig first to make sure they wouldn’t botch the spell and blow up the whole house. Made fun of every single aspect of Harry’s life and looked reluctantly amused when Harry sassed back.
“People who might want to know the secret of Death,” he finished. “But people refusing to submit to the power of an Auror is your thing.”
“What’s that?” asked Draco, pointing delicately at the big bag and the package peeking out of it.
“Draco, I am not sure this is gonna work”.
“I knew I hadn’t dreamed it,” Harry said, smiling. He was tired, but a good kind of tired, with plenty of unused energy and excitement. Tired but full of energy because that unbearable weight had been lifted. “That window appeared overnight!”
Early after the foundation of the house that would become Malfoy Manor, someone had made it so that the fire would never hurt a Malfoy or those they chose to protect. Just your basic protection against pushy visitors and relatives and scorned suitors who would see your fiancé burn.  Then, at some point at the beginning of the 17
Harry smiled because he couldn’t help smiling, he had lost all control of his face. He turned to look at the tea, that was indeed going to get too bitter, and wondered if this meant that Draco was going to kiss him some more in the future or if this was a one-time thing, if he had just given it to Harry to shut him up and get him to focus, if it didn’t mean that much to Draco.
. He had to check that nothing else was going on.
“But he is dead.”
was involved. He had known that Ron was having a bad time after his definite breakup with Hermione, for instance, but it took him by surprise when Ron turned against him after his breakup with Ginny. Harry forgot to account for himself when looking at others.
Slytherins should never be caught cursing anyone.
“He is quite strange, isn’t he?” said Luna after Harry finished telling her everything about Malfoy’s reluctant help. It was… well, it was pretty rich coming from her. Make no mistake, Harry loved Luna and thought she was fantastic, but she was one odd gal and to hear her say that someone was strange… Wow.
It is very obviously revenge for taking Percy’s story from them.
It was that refusal that cemented Harry’s decision to leave.
The illusion lasted only until he got his brains back, which was much, much, later that day after they had gone out to get the evening discounted food from the supermarket. Draco stared at a tourist sign advertising tickets to watch the crowns jewels at the London Tower and seemed to recall how Harry, in a previously unknown lyrical mood, had waxed over his beautiful silver hair and the light in his eyes that shone like diamonds. Which was all terribly sappy and embarrassingly sugary, but Harry had been getting spectacularly shagged at the time, so he thought he could be excused if he got a bit carried away both with his magic and his metaphors.
ooOoo
“I asked Fred to write his name here, so I could see it, with his handwriting, any time.” He moved his hand so Harry could see. “He drew a firecracker.”
the distrustful young boy from last night. The boy from last night had iron in him.
Internally, she thinks “that bastard”. Dumbledore, of course. It is well known that Dumbledore wants Voldemort’s destruction at whatever cost.
“Sure.” Harry went back to his position, hands clasped.
They forgot about Malfoy’s homework after this. The list of symptoms was practically complete in any case. So Harry spent the rest of the evening trying to read three books in half the usual time. There were many mentions of reverse action curses although they tended to be the same examples again and again. The door to that burial chamber in Egypt that could only be opened if one entered backwards. Seven times it had been mentioned and they had only used the same spelling of the name twice. There was a footnote about Devil’s Snare and how the harder you fought it the harder it grabbed you, but it wasn’t really a reverse action case because if you stayed limp it still got a hold of you, just with less strength.
“Information about the previous Head of the Department of Mysteries?” she said. She had only been half-listening. “I can ask
“No, I don’t think so,” said Luna that night, to general surprise. Luna was so agreeable! It was easy to think she would be amenable to anything.
The week in Hogwarts had its benefits since, ironically, the crowded castle provided them with more privacy. They were making good use of this by having quite a lot of worry-free sex.
He allowed himself one little detour, something that was for the others as much as it was for himself. Harry entered Exquisite & Decadent and dropped a whole galleon on bath supplies of all colours and smells. He thought that Fred might particularly enjoy the one called Luscious Strawberry.
Draco didn’t move. His left arm was resting against the frame of the door. The head of the snake was looking at Harry.
Harry: Holy Marmalade, yes! Yes, please! Come on. Yes! I want to have ice-cream for dinner every day. Do we have swimsuits? Never mind, I am already transfiguring one, look, it has blue stripes.
Draco got his wand out and Harry put his hand over his, fingers intertwined. Together, they pointed at the sky. There was a stream of golden and white light, three small fireworks, a dozen butterflies that quickly scattered and seven purple balloons. The balloons sung humorous and dirty limericks as they spread above the square.
“Well, all investigations follow their, er, course” said Madeline. “Today, I am here to talk to you about the recent events at the King Cross station when”
“For Merl—” Suruchi Sudabar started to say, but it wasn’t enough. She finished the curse exclaiming “iiiiiyaaaaarg.”
“You are asking me? I don’t know, Draco.”
“He was your teacher, you said.” The three of them nodded. “When was this? The year of the tournament?”
ooOoo
“Almost. That is Bill, the eldest. Ron is the youngest, barring Ginny. He is good at charms and recovering from hexes as if they were nothing.”
And while your conscience remains there, still smarting from Dumbledore’s shock, something else, a little part of you that had remained dormant, awakes.
The other half of the time he thought about doing more than that.
by one of them.
Draco didn’t answer immediately, weighing his next words. “I think I have just what we need to spot polyjuice use. I will go with Luna, see that her place is all right and then we will go to mine so I can grab some things.”
area of expertise. Sure, he knew
Fred looked at him. His eyes were blue, just blue. No sky or sea or limpid pond or bright jewel. If anything about Fred’s face was remarkable, it was the extremely friendly expression. He might be a prankster and a teacher’s nightmare, but Fred (and George) had the face of someone you could count on.
in his kitchen to eat. Harry felt that losing Kreacher should be more important and he should have struggled more, failed more at cooking and keeping the house clean.
“Well, I do. Have things to do.”
Harry hadn’t followed much of the rest of the case. He knew there had been a second investigation, one that didn’t come from the Aurors, about possible hidden assets that had gone undeclared. There was probably some truth to that because right after the investigation began Lucius and Narcissa had packed up their things and left to go live somewhere on the Continent. Harry supposed that Malfoy would have to hold some kind of job, if only for appearance’s sake.
“You have reason to be” Remus smiled, He was honestly glad for her. “Say, how do you know the date so well?”
Draco shuddered. “I really don’t like that ring”
There were many things that the person, if they could be called a person, looking for Regulus and Fred didn’t know.
Quinn was an elegant and old-fashioned duellist. He was effective and had stripped his style of any useless flourish. He moved his wand with precise, sharp movements while keeping excellent posture. Really commendable. It was like something out of a textbook.
“It is not
It took both Severus and Percy almost three months to realize that when Kingsley Shacklebolt said any of that he was doing it on purpose to annoy them. The man was under a lot of stress and he found his entertainment where he could. Plus they had both been quite uncooperative so Kingsley thought they deserved all the “I never had any doubts about you” he could throw at them.
Combat-wise it wasn’t the most useful spell. Harry would feel better if he could get them to cast
He sits the exams and aces them. They are particularly hard in the last one, the astronomy test. McGonagall coughs three times, rolls her eyes and finally says “bloody enough, don’t you think? He has shown he knows the material.” He sends her a handwritten thank-you letter just to be annoying.
They were all very interesting and intriguing traits, but right now Harry only cared about the teapot that graced Malfoy’s wrist.
While Harry spoke, Regulus practiced with one of the wands (the reddish one, whichever that was), casting small lights and trying to get them to change colours. He had success eight out of ten times. Other times his hand shook, or he coughed, or he was just plain tired and lost his focus, and the charm didn’t work. Harry explained, in the barest tone, about life at the Dursleys and learning he was a wizard while Regulus made some white and yellow lights that fluttered around the room like butterflies. They seemed to amuse Fred to no end.
grateful for that. He was back to wondering Vodemort’s motivation, but he was fine with that. So fine!
Harry held Fred gently (had to be gently or he would get bruises), hands on his torso and Harry’s right thigh making a barrier for Fred’s thrashing legs. It was around then that Harry was hit with the acrid smell of urine. He was used to that, too. The most intense seizures meant that your body let go completely.
“Fenton, leave the invalid alone,” called Draco, followed by a pat to his own thigh. The dog, Fenton, looked at him with a happy expression and came quickly to Draco, tail wagging madly. He made a small stop by Regulus, to see if anything interesting happened. Regulus petted him on the flank with an expression that was both joyful and pained.
Malfoy let a short laugh even as he rolled his eyes. He gave two quick steps back and disapparated right away, right on the border between steps and street.
Malfoy didn’t care at all about Fred’s nightwear preferences. He was looking at Harry in confusion, silently demanding an explanation for the admittedly concerning amount of bottles sitting by the door. Harry thought that he might win Malfoy’s unconditional help after all, with an astute combination of confusion, outrage and curiosity.
Malfoy had reached the corridor and stood there, between the darkness of the foyer and the warm yellow light of the library. “No, I did not think about that.”
has given so much, sacrificed so much, suffered so much as him.
“I have been looking for any precedents,” Harry said and then flinched. Maybe Regulus was right and he had been cursed to speak too much. “And also any treatments, things to help with the symptoms, legal standing of resurrected people…”
and from all the people hating on
Now he was perfectly open in his surprise, unmasked and naked, too stunned to think of showing any other expression. Harry could
He could get used to the crab Rangoon.
I am sure they could use those resources better.
“The Beatles” he answered, and then. “Although I think this is just McCartney singing.”
Draco does not have a squirrel. Renata belongs to herself. She just likes to sit with Draco when he is reading in the manor’s garden. Sometimes, if she has something to tell him, she climbs to his window and knocks. No, there is not a parseltongue for squirrels, that’s stupid, and Draco is not a squirrel-tongue, he just understands her very well. He also suspects that Hermione’s
Draco’s eyes bulged out and Harry wanted to punch himself. Obviously the wrong thing to say.
The other end of the chain was fastened to a big iron ring attached to a spike buried on the floor. It was obviously well protected with many reinforcing charms and spells, yet Harry had little trouble pulling the ring and the spike out. They were heavy and he grunted with effort, but it shouldn’t had been that easy.
Draco followed him docilely because as long as he was near Harry and his music and his love then he wouldn’t have to think about his new orphaned status. Were you even an orphan if you were already of age?
Harry felt that breakfast had been a small reprieve, like ceasefire. As soon as he pushed his plate away Regulus announced that he wanted to take a bath and that life wasn’t worth living at all if he didn’t get his wish immediately and he might as well die that very instant. Harry said that people whose right side of their body was still mildly paralysed couldn’t be beggars, which didn’t make much sense but he was having a difficult morning.
and treat him badly, so be it. It doesn’t change the fcat that he and Snape and Percy Weasley are the heroes of the war.
That evening Harry went to Luna’s place. He had to leave the house through the bathroom window because the backdoor was still stuck, as it had always been, and the journalist lady from the
That was all he had managed to write down, but he had more, he relayed it to Harry in a panting breath, as if afraid that it would escape him again. Rebecca was a young widow. Rebecca’s first husband had passed away suddenly and unexpectedly. Draco didn’t know what it was but there had been something about that death, he remembered now, a passing comment when talking about something else, maybe after Cousin Pandora’s death. Something about her widowhood, about how her husband had died. Not so gruesome, perhaps, as unexpected. Enough that although Rebecca had remarried pretty soon, she had never stopped thinking about it.
An awkward silence fell between them. It seemed that Draco wasn’t sure what to say. He was looking at his glass of water sadly.
He arrived home two and half hours later, after a boring circuit to make sure he wasn’t followed. He filled a pot with water and looked at it until it boiled and then went through every window and mirror in the house, misting them with the water steam and drawing a careful circle with his left hand.
He opened it once again half an hour later. They were milling around the street but they hurried to the door the moment they heard it open. One of the Unspeakables had a bloody lip and the man in green had his sleeve torn.
The wall was hot to the touch when Harry leaned against it. He was sweating and he was beginning to feel cold. He put a hand on Draco’s arm, searching his eyes, almost as clear and light as the lynx’s. “You all right?” he said, barely huffing for breath. He always had good control of his respiration. “Take a step back, come on. Behind me. To the library. Luna, you too. Well done with the patronuses.”
was more like it, until Harry checked on the wards again and added an iron bar to the door. Even so they were still on edge except for Harry who was… happy wasn’t the word either.
“Bella,” Regulus and Draco answered in unison. They were sitting next to each other and Draco had his sleeve rolled up, as if he had been showing Regulus what was left of Voldemort’s mark. Regulus, too, had his sleeve rolled up, but it was slowly coming down. There was a fresh teapot on the table, but Harry didn’t want any more tea for a while.
Hagrid looked at McGonagall with red rimmed eyes open wide. Under his beard he was ashen and pale.
Suruchi had made something funny to the word “friend”, emphasising the “r” and the “n” so that it almost sounded as if she was saying “rascal” and “fiend” at the same time. To her grace, Granger didn’t even ask who this “friend” of hers was.
Meanwhille.
“I can take you to see some of them. The biggest sanctuary is in Romania and if you fall in love with them and want to stay, I am dragging you back all the same. I don’t want to get in trouble with Teresa.”
“oh”, she repeats.
“It was… apparent.” Harry came back to his place by the door after hanging his coat.  He couldn’t explain it better because it was true, he had barely met her, thank Merlin. But it was also quite obvious, yes. Harry hadn’t known much about sex and attraction and erotic matters back then and he still had noticed what was going on. He waved his hand trying to convey the point.
Malfoy
There was no heating.
Harry didn’t know what Quinn wanted with Regulus and Fred but he knew it was something to do with their return to life. This was a man who had already found something, a man who was more than a body, a man who had conquered Death.
The birds were flying faster past Harry, narrowing the circle. He was beginning to feel the flap of their wings against his cheeks and their screams drowned out everything else. Flaps of wings, bodies cutting the air and shrieks that spoke of a violent death. The birds might not be real. Harry thought they weren’t real or Quinn would have had them take his eyes out already. But they were still a hindrance, Harry couldn’t see or hear. He ducked and stopped the next curse simply because he guessed where Quinn was out of instinct. He did the same with the next one, although it was much closer and he almost lost his balance. He didn’t know if he would be able to pull it off a third time, casting and moving deaf and blind simply because his instinct told him to.
Malfoy was looking at Regulus with odd concentration, as if he were learning him. The light of the corridor was too poor to even guess what kind of expression might be on his face.
strange and that meant something more, something all-encompassing and overpowering. Regulus was strange in a truthful way.
Those two. It was better when Slytherin’s shenanigans involved Gryffindor. There was more noise and usually fire but somehow it was better.
So, as you can see, Draco doesn’t have any pets. He has a ferret, but that’s a lie.
Regulus was a horrible person. Regulus said, “Kreacher, Kreacher, help me climb upstairs,” holding Harry’s gaze while he said so and knowing perfectly well that the poor old house elf wasn’t strong enough to help anyone climb anything, even if said anyone was short and skinny and made of attitude and black hair.
He knocked. Draco took twenty seconds to open it. He had the black sweater on, probably due to the cold day, and he looked like a dragon’s treasure. He was so beautiful.
“Hey Draco”
ooOoo
“Is there any way to know the owner’s identity…?” he said at last.
But that was done and in the past and if Harry had learned anything from all those books about trauma, besides the fact that one should ask for help, was that one had to accept and acknowledge the past and focus on the future. Harry wanted a future in which no one touched Draco unless Draco wanted it. Ideally, a future in which Harry got to touch Draco but he would settle with no one buying him.
“Ah, Greyback. You have tracked the lost son for us”.
They got married without fuss, which was exactly what Severus wanted. Having gotten his way with this he had generously agreed to whatever else Remus desired. Remus liked people and if he wanted to have a meeting with his friends, Severus could give him that, now that the social imbalance wouldn’t be so glaringly obvious.
Because she was blonde and female, Gilderoy Lockhart took to standing next to Elisia and chattering non-stop about all of his achievements. You could usually tell the hour from where did you hear Gilderoy talk, since Elisia followed the sun like a sun dial. After ten months of enduring his company Elisia finally lifted a hand, extender her index finger, and zapped him. He wasn’t hurt too much since she didn’t have a wand.
“No.”
ooOoo
Harry had expected her to be dead, but not so soon, not when Grindelwald was barely beginning to stir up trouble. Dead, but not without a child to inherit her wand and use it or at least grow addicted to pixie dust and sell it for ten knuts and let the wand enter the black market.
Really interesting.
But then.
Sirius was confused.
He smiled and blinked slowly at Quinn, like cats do when they want to show they are not afraid of you. “He passed recently,” he said, perfectly calm, and internally swore that just for that Quinn was going to burn.
(This is something that football teams around Europe do. Go somewhere outside the country to train for a month or two in different conditions. The Manchester United often goes to Malaga, in Spain, for a warm-weather training. I don’t even like football, I don’t know why I know this.)
Harry was more tired than yesterday and yesterday he had fought and defeated a murderous master illusionist. Today he had royally screwed up, he had hurt Draco, and then he had been dragged to the Burrow for a very emotional and draining reunion. At Fred’s insistence they had decided to take the news to the family slowly and in stages. Fred had been overwhelmed by their reaction, particularly Percy’s, and he wanted to be practical about it, no more than two people fainting at once.
Harry’s first years of his new life had been a turmoil. Now, almost two years after what happened to Ratty, he saw that they were a mixture of fear and freedom and pain. He had been dirty and tired and hungry, and still it was better than the memories of Privet Drive.
Draco nodded and looked reassuringly calm. Regulus and Fred grinned at him, clutching the old wands that had become theirs. “I’ll take the snake with me,” Regulus said, his voice like a long drawn out note on a viola. Fred informed Harry that he would take Aeneas, so Harry shouldn’t worry.
It was Remus who said the magic words because Remus just knew how to make people feel better. The words were:
“Can I see your tattoo?” he blurted, as Malfoy stood up from Regulus’ sofa with a basin of now tepid water in his hands.
It was when dessert was halfway done that Luna Lovegood also got up from her seat.
ooOoo
Oh, Harry was feeling so vindicated. So someone else agreed that the classes had been insufficient. If he wasn’t so upset about Lupin he would be really enjoying the moment.
There was long pause in which Harry took a very deep breath before finally lifting his eyes, those striking green eyes so full and intense, and looked at Dumbledore.
She had Dumbledore’s books on her backpack. She had restricted books on forbidden magic in a schoolbag.
The number of visions decreased. Percy still got ten times more visions than the average seer, but it was something manageable. He hoped that they would stop altogether as he grew older, because it would still be terrible to foresee the deaths of all those people he had worked so hard to save even if it happened when they were all past one hundred years of age. At least the visions he was getting nowadays were more fun. No death and hardly any physical damage.
charm used to be.
Oh god, he hated it. He hated it and he was thinking about what to say not to hurt Harry’s feeling and he was probably composing his face so he wouldn’t see his dislike.
Draco was wearing a light green sweater. It had two loose stitches on the elbow but otherwise seemed fine. A bit bland, perhaps. His hair didn’t stand out like when he wore black or blue.
“… as was Miss Tonks” David said a bit annoyed already.
Number 12 of Grimmauld Place had three floors with four windows on each looking out at the street. The ground floor only had three, though. Two big and wide for the dining room and one for the living room. Life in the living room should be carried out in a twilight state, with just one window facing the street and a second one that looked at the next house (number 13) so the inhabitants of the house could judge their neighbours from the relative comfort of their easy chairs.
Harry tried to remember if the fake Luna had used her right or left arm when she gave him an electric shock. It might be a preference and it might be that the wandless magic only came with the left hand.
saw it too, and apparently he was not alarmed.
“I will pay
, sitting in the floor, half dressed and with his hair in a state, telling Draco about all he had learned from Kreacher, delightful fellow, not completely here you know, but with very interesting things to say.
One moment Harry was half listening to Draco’s usual vehement tirades and the next he had turned deaf and was struck by… by the
“Yeah, well…”
Draco made more tea, this time stirring the sugar by force of rage alone.
It sounded so small. Just bad wizards chasing him, like they had chased Harry, like they had done with many others. It sounded small but Harry understood the terror that lay there. The dread that at the turn of the next corner there will be a wall, that there will be someone waiting there, that you will find yourself with no exit, no place to run and no room to fight.
“What the actual… heck, Draco”.
“Today is my first day, I think,” he said. Harry understood what he meant. Not the first day back alive but the first day back to life. A day with no sickness and no fear and no anxious waiting.
On it.
Fifteen years later the name Regulus would become fashionable and many children, Slytherin or not, would have that name. Sirius said that his brother would had been mortified because he was always shy and quiet. Everybody agreed that he would had been happy to see that a great majority of his namesakes became Ravenclaws.
He got a muggle girlfriend, Laura, who was nice and completely uninterested in magic. They went out for a year and then they broke up when she moved to the States to pursue a PhD in linguistics. He was sorry, but not too much, so Neville judged it all for the best.
But the Demon hadn’t returned and when Someone had gone to the house to check they had found that the door had been replaced and the Smell of Death had a different aroma. They had called the Demon, they had pronounced the secret and cursèd name they had given it. Nothing.
The scream they could all have expected. The fact that Voldemort’s face turned black and cracked, like a log on fire, they did not. Harry either didn’t notice or didn’t care, as he landed two more punches before his knees buckled and he fell down.
By the time they were back down and Regulus smelled of sweet peas and his hair had violet, blackberry and wild orchid in it, he was speaking more, although slowly. He could move both his left arm and leg, but the leg didn’t support his weight and he could only lift his arm with difficulty. He was more animated though and looked quite pleased with his hair.
When Draco started this career, he understood the notion of the press as the fourth power in an abstract way. People can be manipulated with stories and there is power in that. Now he realises that power is very concrete and that many important powerful people will be happy to do him a favour or two just because Draco owns the three most influential media outlets of the East coast.
“Fred killed a Demon,” Harry said. Ron was also coming into the room, probably for similar reasons. “Once-in-a-century event, and it is not even in the top ten most important things that have happened.”
“Look, we are coming” said Neville, as if he were explaining an indubitable fact of life. “Exams start next week and Hermione is here. So either this won’t take up much time or it is really important.”
PART THREE
He got a letter back the next day saying that they could always blow up the top of the cliff to get some light on the cave. Just under these lines, in Dean’s handwriting, there was a paragraph saying that it was a terrible idea and not to do that. Seamus concluded that drying the lake would help and, in that case, Vincent Crabbe was their best bet. Apparently Crabbe had helped with the recent flooding of Hogwarts’ lower levels and before that he had made it his life mission to stop the creeping humidity of Slytherins’ common room, so he knew about fighting water.
Draco didn’t speak. Harry wasn’t sure if the topic had made him uncomfortable or if he had thought of something. He looked down at their hands, resting on the sand and almost touching. Draco was digging his fingers into the sand.
“It was Ron’s idea.”
and now she is the first Latina member of MACUSA.
“Yes.”
So neither Fred nor Regulus had managed to eat much of anything, other than some spicy bread. They had vomited a lot, began to sweat and gotten a fever. He and Luna kept trying to give them water but even that was hard to manage. They had eventually fallen into a restless sleep that was interrupted when Regulus got one of the headaches that were like a
The guinea pig belongs to Teddy. Only Teddy, odd child that he is, is terrified of rodents. Draco doesn’t know why he is the one stuck with Roderick when Teddy has a perfectly nice godfather right there who should take his responsibilities more seriously. It’s preposterous.
The problem, as Dean had put it, was that Seamus was a dense brick with his head shoved deep inside his ass.
“No. You said it was a mess and a tripping risk and nothing else.”
Fred blinked a couple of times and lay his head back, still clutching Harry’s hand for comfort but less anxious. “You are very tired,” Harry said, with just a little thread of a voice because anything stronger would break and come out choked.
Harry’s very first thought was “shit”, followed by “thank Merlin this is my last day”. He was halfway down the stairs already before the thought of Sirius crossed his mind because Harry was the kind of stupid person who jumped to action with little thought or care. There was people down there that needed help.
“What was that word on the crossword the other day?” he asked. “The one you couldn’t get.”
“No, no… That’s all right. If there is a way to defeat…
and no, they were not the same, Harry was sure he could cope.
“I’m worried,” Harry confessed, sitting down in front of Draco, who had Luna and Regulus on either side of him. Cousins all of them, Harry guessed.
And Dean was running out of patience.
“But, do you know how to swim?” Harry asked, because he still had a thought and it was taking shape. He thought… He knew that Ginny didn’t know how to swim but Ron knew enough not to immediately sink down. There wasn’t a body of water around the Burrow where they could have learned easily, so it wasn’t impossible that Fred hadn’t learned.
ooOoo
Harry was curious, of course, but he didn’t mind because he was there and it was glorious. There were more than two dozen pictures which shouldn’t surprise him because it was obvious that Draco was very visual. Each one told him a bit more about Draco. There was a moving photo of Draco and the rest of the Slytherin Quidditch team, at least one picture of Fenton on each of the walls, a watercolour of a picturesque village near the sea.
His eyes met Sirius’. He was still very handsome, despite Azkaban, and in the last few months he had gotten better. He shaved regularly, his long hair had gotten back its shine, and he had lost a bit of the gauntness. He had also recovered the charming smile and the cocky posture that the years of imprisonment and rancour had covered with a layer of anger and madness and hurt. Tonight, however, Sirius looked like someone Remus barely remembered ever seeing. Young and vulnerable and childlike. It was… it was the
Oh, yes, Harry had spent
“I think I saw her push her hair away earlier,” said Regulus. He was still speaking softly but there was nothing of the aching desolation from when he mentioned his dream. He spoke softly like one did when seeing a woodland creature.
, quick and effective negotiation over what they were doing and who was going on top and all that. Meaning that Harry began to ask while Draco got some lube from the bedside drawer and then pushed Harry down and climbed on top of him and said, “if you even think of making a joke about Gryffindor’s sword, I will throw you out the window.”
Draco started by complimenting the view and the well preserved state of ther rivers and castles which made everyone straighten with national pride. He quickly added that the state of the roads left a lot to be desired, and some of the roundabouts were unnecessary placed, and everybody forgot any questions they had about dragons to take turns over who was to blame and apologize profusely to the beautiful fae prince they had before them.
he had the money too!
He gets better, Draco does, with time. He has less episodes and he copes much better with threats (real and perceived) and he regains more and more memories and this is why, two years in the relationship and planning to move together,
And soft.
Oliver had 1) the best pair of thighs in the world, seriously. All that broom flying really developed the legs. 2) an excellent smell. Excellent. Soothing and rich, and Percy thought he might had dreamed with it.
It wouldn’t be easy, though, they knew as much. And they couldn’t forget that Potter was the reward, not the objective. The real prize was the monsters hiding inside the house. The living dead. The dead alive. The young men locked on a threshold, not living and not dying. Aberrations, aberrations! Death wanted them back. Death had a claim on them. They would make a more than suitable sacrifice. They belonged to someone who wasn’t standing there, staring at the house. There was no one there.
would hold. Without a clear target it might vanish soon but maybe not. Harry thought that the magical community didn’t know as much about patronuses as they thought. Just five minutes ago Harry had discovered a fun and interesting application that he was implementing right away because Harry was a quick study.
3.- He doesn’t like Dumbledore. Regardless of his relationship with his father and Voldemort, he just doesn’t like Dumbledore as a person. It has nothing to do with how Dumbledore treats people (although that certainly doesn’t help) it’s more visceral. Just like some people will look at an actor or celebrity and go “no, I do not find Jimmy Fallon funny and can’t tell you why”. This is the same.
“It hurts so much,” said the other man. Boy. Person. The other one, lying on the floor and pressing his left temple against the rough stone. He had avoided Fred’s vomit by pure luck. “I can’t breathe, it is too dark.”
Hagrid had tragically missed lots of years of education and he spent most of his time on the grounds rather than inside the castle, so he really couldn’t say whether this was out of the ordinary or not. In any case he was more concerned with making the birds comfortable, the poor dears. Chained and forced to travel and then thrown into English weather, no wonder they had been so aggressive. They were really gentle. Half the time now they didn’t mean to set him on fire.
“Can I help?” Harry pointed at the bags as he stepped aside, leaving the way to the door clear.
“Pit, look-”
They had breakfast in the living room because that was what they were used to doing, but the room was in shambles. Harry thought briefly that he was glad that Kreacher was dead. Well, not that he was dead, but that he wasn’t seeing this. The crystal vase that had been in the family for generations had broken down into so many pieces that it was impossible to repair it. The chiffonier that someone had brought from India, made with scented woods, was stained with alcohol and flour and had many small holes and dents from the explosion.
Ron had been remarkably discreet, but Harry knew that he had been checking on Percy after the war. He knew it through Ginny though, who bristled at the idea of a well-liked brother like Ron having dinner with the one she disliked the most. Ginny had needed years to forgive Percy and even now their relationship wasn’t the best.
“Is, um, is everything all right, sir? You have… blood.”
“He wasn’t much of a teacher, was he?” Draco shrugged. “He knew a lot about potions, I will give you that. The sixth and seventh years said that a class with him guaranteed Exceeds Expectations at the NEWTs. But in the lower levels he just put instructions on the blackboard and had us follow them with no further explanation.”
He understood this. He was a very reasonable and practical man. Still, that very first Monday after they had gotten the kids in new clothes (Sirius burned the old ones) they went to get some paint and other things to make the house look better. They may have gone a bit crazy with it because Severus had decent savings, Sirius had a small fortune and Harry had a very healthy fortune.
“Well, he broke my nose the day I met him! And I still befriended him”
“Tell Fred we close it in three,” said Harry. He heard Draco repeat the order to Luna. He counted to five, to give them time to reach Regulus and Fred and then raised his voice. “One! Two! THREE!”
“Head of a department,” Harry repeated. That made sense. You would be king of your own little kingdom and certain departments had a lot of power and influence. “Treasury?”
Although, no else had. No one. The only thing they knew for certain was that Voldemort wasn’t behind Harry’s disappearance because at the time he had been busy occupying Quirrell’s nape.
“Mister Potter, my name is Caec— ”
He took the tube back to the city. Then a bus to the suburbs in the north. Then a ninety minute walk clutching the flowers he had picked in one of the stations. The road was mostly deserted, with a few lonely cottages in between. Harry greeted every person he passed. People are always put at easy when you wish them a good morning.
So, basically, the day Hagrid took him shopping on Diagon Alley. That had been good. Everything else was a disaster. It just took him longer to realise it because he had had friends, decent food, and a change of pattern in how he was hurt.
Dean and Seamus were best friends much like Harry and Ron were, which meant they loved each other but they also got on each other nerves and went through difficult times. This was one of those times for Dean and Seamus.
“The hole in the wall, too,” Fred said, swallowing a biscuit and pointing. “Both of them. I can even make them look aged like before. George and I, well, had a few accidents at home and learned to cover the evidence so Mum and Percy would never find about it.”
He was close to Regulus, too. Too close, perhaps. Regulus was a Death Eater like him, had a brand on his arm like him, and Harry was falling over to save his life.
Warning for bad boyfriends and abusive relationships (not very explicit). Not Harry or Draco, they are good boys.
“Do what, exactly?” he asked like an accusation.
“Oh, shut up!” cried Draco. “You walked into the forest TO DIE. You will listen to this.”
There was no ceiling, either. Looking up Harry could see one of the bedrooms on the first floor. Both the doors to the dining and living rooms were missing. There was a chunk of wall missing from the corridor and the damage extended further inside the house and in the stairs. There was something on the stairs.
The difficulty was evident because if dementors were good at one thing and one thing only, it was locating souls. It was an instinct, something that worked mechanically and without thought. But dementors had an intellect of sorts. Enough that they could understand a language and follow orders and decide that Lord Voldemort was offering them a sweeter deal than anything the Ministry could propose. It was through this, Harry theorized, that the Demon could be formed. A mind could be tricked and mistaken. Someone powerful and well-versed in casting illusions and mirages could deceive a dementor long enough to get them to suck a soul that wasn’t there.
But Harry thought about it nevertheless. About the state of that door from the outside and the fact that Kreacher had died next to it and Harry had woken in the middle of the night.
offices since summer and he has hired two squibs as demented as him who see nothing wrong in hitting people with a broom. No one gets to his office if Celia and Anna don't approve.
The sense of danger came pretty early, despite their tiredness and their slow reflexes and the fact that they hadn’t had breakfast yet. It was simply a mild sense of alarm at first, something that made Harry insist on leaving their luggage in the first place they found (a hotel, as it turned out, saying they had already checked out and they would pick it up later because they had a night flight). They went on with just the essentials: awl, wand, pocket money, Draco’s bottle of water.
He had been right. And Kaleem, he had been right too. Things are just better when you have just finished a big order of fries.
“Anyway, you know I’m right or you wouldn’t be here” Mort yelled.
“I am sure you have many questions, Harry” said Dumbledore. He had gold half moon glasses and his eyes twinkled. They were light blue. Friendly.
ooOoo
“Don’t mention it,” warned Harry, curt and firm so she would understand that it wasn’t about politeness it was about the nausea that hit them whenever offal or meat or anything like that was mentioned. They had had to sit on the other end of the table because the mere vision of their dinner (nondescript meat, carrots and potatoes) had made Regulus turn green.
“I am beat,” Regulus went on. “And sore. And smelly. And I really liked it, Harry. I like being outside. I like it even when it’s cold and raining. I just need a wool scarf and socks.”
There had been an extremely tiring and emotionally draining conversation on Friday when Harry brought them home and attempted to fill them in on the last nine and twenty-six years. Fred had wanted to know about his family, of course, and Harry told him everything he could while also trying to tell him as diplomatically as possible that it might be a bad idea to contact them right away. The conversation had been interrupted twice, once by Regulus and one of his headaches and the other by Fred himself with his first seizure. He had seen Harry’s point better then.
“I am going to say this again,” Harry said to the room, “I would rather have you somewhere else. Take Aeneas, too.”
Also, bloody Harry Potter, hero extraordinaire, comes every single day to the Wizengamot, every day, even on weekends, to tell them about Sirius Black. (They are not supposed to work on weekends but they are all coming anyway because the work is immense and it keeps growing, lines and lines of names and heinous acts, people disappeared and murdered and people who did the disappearing and the murdering and it is on them to tell who is who).
Greyback had been strong, and strength means charisma. With him dead, however, most of his followers found themselves wondering about the Dark Lord.
Well, at least he can be sure that Voldemort means it when he cast the killing curse.
Draco had a gleam in his eyes and a dorky smile.
“I have a

not everyone deserved the honour of performing the most delicate missions. They had ended up all rushing in to the big hall, like children running to father, to ask of Voldemort the privilege of killing Dumbledore. And because they were dark wizards, they had done so while throwing curses at each other.
Bill was the curse-breaker of the family, but at Gringotts he mostly works ensuring that curses stay put and improve security. It is Percy who works breaking and removing curses. He has a touch unlike any other curse-breaker. He is neat and clean and delicate and no one has figured out that he is using his own desolation and the Hanahaki to get the best results. When other curse-breakers leave smoke and ash behind them, Percy is like the sun and the wind and the rain and everything that makes a flower bloom. He not only removes, he heals.
Draco gives seven promotions, sets his desk on fire, downs a tall glass of coffee, prepares everything so the American businesses can run by themselves (hence the promotions) and portkeys to England with murder in his eyes.
Harry prodded and the girl spoke. It wasn’t a concern of hers… She played a different sector, lots of middle age men with low level business jobs in the city, so she didn’t have all the deets. What Harry ought to do was speak with someone thin and young like that Rat friend of his. Try Venus or Aidan.
go for another round after all, and they didn’t speak another word about that.
Since he had to go back to the kitchen, it reminded him: groceries. There was a standing order for groceries that were delivered to the house, just like the paper that arrived in his mailbox every morning. They could even bring you muggle stuff, for a small extra cost.
Harry had practiced a lot to make his performance short and attractive. He still didn’t know why he could only do the apple trick as long as there was an audience. But he got to eat the apple later, and they were usually good.
The lower corner of the frame had cracked in the fall. Sirius picked it up and put it face down in a chest.
“Come on, Malfoy.” Harry had to do an awkward half-run after him which did not look elegant at all.
“I realise how flimsy all this sounds,” Draco looked sick under the faint green light.
“It really is not a problem, Dudley” said Harry.
Magic Law on the States is a bit… over the place. It would be extremely simple to put a curse or a hex on that man. If Percy was clever about it, it wouldn’t be too illegal. But he doesn’t. Percy realises it wouldn’t make him feel better.
