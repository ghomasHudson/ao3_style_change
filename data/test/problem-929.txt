as a waiter. Harry hadn’t been there for over a year (because of his fame and all that bull) so he supposed that the blond had managed to find a job despite him being a Death Eater.
skull), nothing in this room whatsoever reminded him of Olympus, and especially not his mother’s palace.
Harry’s mother burst into tears, but Harry barely spared her a glance. Instead, he picked up Draco and took them both upstairs, ignoring his stricken parents behind him.
“Not now, love. I’ll be done soon, I promise,” Harry said, although his voice was a bit pained. Merlin, he was ready to fuck Draco into tomorrow, but if he didn’t do his paperwork now then he would never finish it.
For some reason, this didn’t terrify Draco nearly as much as it should have. He didn’t care much for extinction now; he had the brothel to focus on.
Harry turned around and vanished into thin air. The only thing he left behind was the strong stench of magma and the crumpled petals of a blood-red rose.
Harry sat across from him, a warm smile on his face. He was holding an iced caramel macchiato in one hand and a strawberry scone in the other.
“It will leave the recipient in endless, unbearable pain until the curse is released by the caster. Which I have no intention of doing, King Aeacus. Not for a long, long time.”
“Anyways, let’s get you dressed up!” Pansy squealed. Before he could react, she shuffled towards him and threw all the dresser doors open.
“Alright then, I guess you have to leave. Although it’s nice that there’s someone that I can actually relate to here.”
“Hey Draco?” Draco looks up from the bed. Harry is standing at the doorway of his room, the one that leads to the hallway.
Draco steeled his face into a neutral expression. He didn’t like to think that he had too much in common with a murderer. “Good night, Mr. Potter.”
“Contrary to popular belief, no. I do everything willingly. There’s the occasional rough person, but most days I enjoy what I do, even if it doesn’t pay much. I certainly could have been worse off.”
“Shut up. At least my mother isn’t the village harlot.” He ground out and sped away, not listening to their cries of outrage.
look nice. He was wearing a short yellow-orange chiton that glowed softly, which made Draco guess that it was sewn from sunrise beams. His brown leather sandals ran up to his knees, and there was a bit of yellow glitter on his face. It was a simple outfit, but a very good looking one. Not that Draco would ever admit that, Apollo’s ego was already big enough, as it was.
“Fine then! You won't get any food until you come down!” It bellowed. Draco heard it stomp off angrily.
“I was just testing out some new flowers I created, mum. I think that I may have found a way to create grains just from their blossoms!” He said excitedly, hoping she would buy into it.
He groaned in frustration and pushed them all aside. He barely had an hour left and he was no closer to finding an outfit than he was thirty minutes ago. If his meddling
I put some asterisks next to some parts that may seem confusing. The explanations are in the notes at the end of this chapter. Also, Kouroi is the male version of Kore, which is Persephone's original name.
. And Phillina had even put some warm honey in the centers that oozed out slowly and made his mouth a sweet, sticky mess.
He mostly kept to the shadows whenever he could, slipping in between buildings and walking against the stone and marble walls. He had done this many times, and he already knew the route by heart. Two lefts, a right turn, a forward on the marble crossroads and going through the tall grass field all the way to his home. The palace he and his mother shared. It was located in the nook of one of the northern ridges, not too far from the Pantheon.
The next morning was devastating. Zacharias had been strangled to death, and the words ‘snitches get stitches’ was carved into his arm.
Around him, what was remaining of Malfoy Manor lit up the night sky with a show of impressive flames, no doubt terrifying the neighbors. It was only a matter of time before the Aurors arrived, but Harry already had what he needed.
He stared in shock for a moment before springing up. He ran out of his room, and practically took the stairs
At least he had the decency to look a bit sheepish. He scratched the back of his neck nervously with his long claws; Draco winced at the dry, scaly sound he heard as Potter scratched his nails across his neck.
Appalled, Harry looked at her, “Is that what Draco thinks? That I gave him menial tasks out of spite?”
"But we're so close!" The wizard promised. "We just need a few more weeks to stabilise the formula. I know we're on the right track with these new runes. We just need to tweak the potion a little."
"I have no need to cheat, never had. Either I succeed on my own devices, or I fail." Looking the other man in the eye, Neville stated coldly, "You of all people should know that. You have set me up for failure long before any war was even on the horizon."
The young witch offered a hint of a smile before shaking her head. "Don't take this the wrong way, Mr Malfoy, but no, definitely not."
Despite all the evidence, Lucius shook his head. "But it's a children's story. You can't expect me to believe that Harry … my liege, possesses all Deathly Hallows, making him the Master of Death."
Thomas Manson, an elderly wizard from Manchester, who wore a green jumper with elbow-patches - quite the professor type - handed over a steaming cup of tea before suggesting, "Maybe introductions are in order?"
When they gathered in the living−room around six the next evening, Luna shared contently, "The Gargoyles will take much better care from now on. And I have convinced the gnomes in the garden to leave the vegetable and herbal patches alone."
"Silencio!" Looking at the gathering, Neville stated calmly, "Alright. Every witch or wizard who wants to chuck around like a headless chicken, feel free to do so,
Pansy laughed and threw the pillow back, "I'm kidding, it's about time you meet her. I'll introduce her to you on Monday, after school." Draco groans.
Oh. Harry knew what this was about. Draco and Harry aren't friends, even if Harry really wanted them to be more than that.
He wakes up to Draco carrying him inside of their loft. He smiles to himself, falling in love with him all over again, then falls asleep knowing he is in loving arms.
"We don't have time, we need to get down to breakfast, hurry up, we don't have long before classes start."
"OW, STOP REMUS,HE'S FINE! STOP HURTING ME!" Sirius yells trying to block his husband from hitting his head and to keep from dropping the still silently screaming baby.
"What do you want, Potter?" Malfoy asked but it came out quieter then wanted and with no malice whatsoever.
"Rita Skeeter, she used to write for "Private Eye," the magazine, but was fired when they found out she was giving false information," Hermione explained.
"Draco, I really need to tell you something now," I say wanting to stay on task, I can't push this away anymore, it's beginning to eat me up inside. "Actually come to think of it, I do too," he said, making me raise an eyebrow at him. "Oh, then you can go first," I say wanting to stall a little longer. "No, no, it's fine, you can go first," he started to seem really timid which isn't like him. "Are you sure?" I ask. "Yeah, it's fine," Draco replied with a slight smile.
So he decided he would just make sure everything was ok even if it was weird that he didn't even know who lived up there. He left his apartment and took the elevator to the second floor.
It was a small little park in the front but as they walked down the trail behind the playground there was a huge flower patch.
It was always obvious that I was just faking my pride, with that dumbass smirk I always had on. I had to pretend that all those children of powerful people were my friends. Still, even suffering with the wrong people never made father happy.
They walk along a little pathway through the flowers until they find a patch of dirt big enough for their picnic. It was around 12:30pm once they made it. Harry sets the basket down and gets out the blanket.
"They say I've lost my mind, they say I'll never find it, I think they're kinda right, in fact I kinda like it, they say I've lost my mind, they say I'll never find it, I think they kinda right."
Once they got to the school they all went their separate ways. Hermione met up with Pansy and they went to class. Same with Ron and Theo. Which left Harry to walk to class by himself.
Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. "You know what, just forget it." But as he was turning around, a gentle hand grabs his wrist. "I'd love to!" He was turning back around-
The map appeared and he made sure no one was in his way. No one was, the only one that was moving was Filch, who was down by the Great Hall.
"Only because he was mean first!" Harry exclaimed, not wanting Neville to give him another talking to. Blaise's smirk quickly faded.
Harry was asleep when he heard something shatter on the wall in the apartment above his. He thought it must have been a dream.
What he saw made his blood boil. Theodore Nott, trying to kiss a obviously very uncomfortable Draco Malfoy.
All I could hear was the thumping of my heart in my ears. I was so nervous. I'm going to ask him out today.
He casts a wordless lubricant spell on his finger and walks over to the other male. He immediately shoves two of his fingers harshly into the boy's hole.
"Only because you asked so nicely," Harry smiled and pulled Draco in for a kiss which he returned. The kiss was slow and sweet, but it was also short, much to Harry's dismay. He groans which causes Draco to laugh.
Hermione changed the subject, "I'm going over to Pansy's after school." Harry laughed, "you gave in, huh?" She just pouted and crossed her arms, "you knew I would." But she got over it quickly and they both started laughing.
"I might just take you up on that," I try to say nonchalantly but I think my smile gave my excitement away.
Harry hits his chest hard but not hard enough to actually hurt him as his tears start to fall. "That's not funny, ferret."
"NO, I DO, I JUST-" but Blaise didn't know what to say. But, Neville calmed him down. "Stop, Blaise, just smile and wave." Blaise did so while Neville dragged him away to wherever. Ron, Harry, Draco, Pansy, and Ginny all yell "WHIPPED," at the same time.
"I am completely in love with him but you don't need to know tha- oh shit I said that out loud, didn't I?" Hermione just started laughing at me.
When he heard the words he had a faint smile, he just knew he'd be ok. Harry knew from there what exactly he wanted to say.
"What's this store right here?" Draco asks, looking at what appears to be a brand new, recently opened antique jewelry store.
"I've fallen in love with you, and before you yell or hit me, I know. I know we both agreed to this. I know you specifically told me not to. I know you will never love, or even like me back. Trust me, I know," at this point Harry is breaking down, sobbing, and trying to look anywhere that isn't at Draco. "I know this is my fault and that you'll probably never talk to me again, not that you do anyways but-" Harry was cut off by rough lips against his.
"Hey, honey bun," Ginny said, looking at Harry with heart eyes. "Hey, baby," Harry said while gazing into her eyes. They just stayed like that for a second, looking deeply into the others eyes.
This part really pissed me off, of course, as soon as they heard that I was marrying Harry Potter, the richest man in the wizarding world, that's when they wanted to "get in touch". They were completely against it at first but now that they had the smallest chance of getting his wealth.
invested in Potter. Now he found himself thinking about Potter’s personality, his cheeky grins, the secret stares he would give Draco when he thought he wasn’t looking. Draco didn’t know what to think anymore. He even caught himself thinking of how Potter was actually quite handsome: his strong jawline, his tanned skin, his lean stomach, his
Harry sniffed and silently let the tears come out until he was finished. He raised up his head, wincing at the sudden dizziness. His eyes were rimmed red, and there were droplets of water on the day-old stubble on his chin.
Draco flashes Harry a smug grin, and Harry feels his face heat up. Even with his tan skin, he knows it will probably show up on his face. Fuck.
Draco was very, very worried. It had been two days since his father had gone, and he still wasn’t back.
“I shall be heading to my chambers now. If there’s anything that requires my attention, save it for tomorrow. You are dismissed.”
Draco blushed harder and nodded. As he turned around to walk inside the house, Harry took a moment to properly ogle his arse before he walked back to his car.
“Harry!” He gasped, bucking upwards wildly as Harry sucked on his cock. The hand on his arse soon turned to a finger massaging his perineum, occasionally moving lower and rubbing the top of his hole.
?” Draco shivered; his mother’s voice was eerily quiet. She had dark red hair put into a painful looking bun on the top of her head and was in a clean cut iridium dress that stopped at her knees.
She sighed in exasperation but reduced her pace. Draco could see their house in the distance, standing majestically in the midnight blue sky. The lights were on, which meant that the servants were probably cleaning up the house and preparing it for their arrival. The party had lasted for several days, after all.
Draco hugged himself tightly as he walked away from the Slytherin Lunch Hall. For some reason the temperature had dropped by like fifteen degrees, and he was woefully unprepared for the cold.
“I-I-” Draco stammered, backing away from the mirror hastily. The beast snarled, its irises fading from emerald green to blood red. It bared its teeth menacingly.
“Nice to meet you too, Harry.” Draco managed to say back without flushing. He took a long sip of his drink.
“Harry, you aren’t in the right state of mind to enter a relationship now. The Horcrux obviously has had some effects from long-term exposure.” Hermione tried to reason with him. Harry had ignored her as usual, instead fantasizing of Draco in several different… situations, to say the least.
“Fuck.” Draco murmured. He ran to the window and looked down. It was too high up to try to climb down.
“Don’t yell in my shop! Can’t you see that there’s another customer?” Draco hissed, coming out of the storage room. Potter grinned at him with that infuriatingly crooked smile.
Rufus gulped as Potter reached into his pocket and pulled out a pistol from his trouser pocket. He did nothing with it, but the threat was more than clear.
In response, Harry leaned forward and bit down hard on the curve of his neck, where it joined with his shoulder. Draco moaned and shivered above him.
The stars looked especially beautiful tonight. Draco whispered it into the cool air, and he swore that they gleamed a bit brighter at him.
Suddenly, the butterfly started to fly and flapped away from his finger. He watched it idly and trailed its path until he realized where it was going. There was an enormous patch of narcissus flowers, which made him gasp. They were extremely rare, and his mother would
Draco looked down at the money register, suddenly very interested in the painted designs on it. “Alright. I’ll see you then.”
He found himself in the green fields a few minutes later, the tall grass reaching up and tickling his knees gently. In the distance, he could see his mother’s palace standing tall and proud, the early morning sunlight reflecting off of the golden rooftops. On its sides, it was surrounded by flowers of every kind, ranging from aquamarine roses to orange sunflowers. That was mostly his own doing.
of options to choose from. There were great billowing cloaks, shirts made of the finest fabrics, trousers that were as soft as rabbit down, regal suits, and were made of the most expensive fabrics. Draco had never even
“No, I don’t think I will. I love the pink and blue dye you put on the ends. And besides, you like seeing my hair in pigtails, don’t you?”
With renewed anger, he slit the throat of one, and dug the sword into the skull of the other, before slumping to the ground. The third one scurried off before he could do anything to it, dragging the corpses of the others with it.
He sighed and shrugged off his lab coat, straightening out the creases in it before he hung it on the rack. The lights were off, and the only thing that illuminated the room was the streetlight by the corner of the building, filling his office with an eerie orange glow.
Harry smiles at his adorable boyfriend, admiring how he looks in his outfit. Draco is wearing a pastel pink cropped sweater, high waisted, white jean shorts with pastel pink fishnets underneath, his pastel pink converse, and to top it all off, a pastel yellow, pink, and purple flower crown sitting on his head.
Harry immediately lifts his arms up, wrapping them around Draco's waist and pulling him down. The position making it impossible for Draco to move but giving Harry the perfect angle to eat him out.
"Weird, wait-," Harry says, suspiciously while him and Ron make eye contact. "Did he just...apologize?" They ask each other at the same time. They just smiled at each other and continued to compare their schedules as they walked to their classes.
"Harry James Potter, will you be my boyfriend?" I can't believe this is my life! "Yes, I'd really like that. And we're still going on that date."
"Sorry, I didn't mean to say that out loud, I meant it but didn't mean to tell you to your face. Also, I'm not going to classes to day, I don't feel like it. I was going to lie and say I was sick but for some reason, that's not what's happening," I smack my hand back over my mouth.
Harry woke up to Dobby licking his face. "UGh, Dobby, down boy," Harry commanded, Dobby didn't listen. Harry sighed and laughed. He just sat up and started petting him.
Harry tried so hard to keep any sobs from escaping his mouth. He couldn't let Draco hear him. Harry starts trying to make his face look like he wasn't just crying when he hears a knock.
Harry watches his boyfriend as he drives home. He looks out of the window to see ripples in the puddles to show that it's still raining but not as much as before. He continues to watch Draco until he ends up falling asleep.
"What was a dirty trick?" Came a voice right behind Blaise. It was Neville, he came up behind him and hugged him around his waist. "Potter was being mean," Blaise smirked in victory,  something Neville couldn't see.
"I just got my schedule fixed and I have newspaper," she groans. Both Ron and Harry looked confused, Harry speaks up.
"Wha-, oh, no, sorry," he whispered so quietly that Harry barely heard him. Draco pushed his glasses back up on his nose and scurried to his first class.
"Blaise-" the name made him growl. "And I are going to Hogsmeade, his and Nevilles' 2 year anniversary is coming up and he wants me to help him find something special for him. And stop growling at every males name that comes out of my mouth."
Harry rolled his eyes but got up nonetheless. He headed to his closet to put on that outfit. The eighth years have dorms that they share with a roommate but Dean was spending the night with Seamus.
Harry, still holding Draco's hand jumps in another puddle. Draco let's go of his hand and grabs his face, pulling him in for a passionate kiss, which Harry melts into almost immediately as soon as he gets over his shock.
Sirius had awoken to Harry crying in his nursery and his husband, Remus, still fast asleep next to him, a half eaten chocolate bar beside his head.
"Yes, yes, I know Draco, you've only said that about a thousand times before. Honestly, what's the rush?" Pansy questions, sitting on the floor in front of the blonde.
I looked towards my parents, my father clearly pissed off, wanting to leave but mom was crying, holding him back.
They walk along a little pathway through the flowers until they find a patch of dirt big enough for their picnic. It was around 12:30pm once they made it. Harry sets the basket down and gets out the blanket.
The blond smirks, "oh, so I need to start moaning out your name hm? Like, Harry~" he moans out into Harry's ear, earning a growl.
"What's wrong with you?" Harry doesn't answer, he just looks around the room, noticing another door which he assumes is a bathroom. Draco gently grabs Harry's face, turning his head to look at him.
"Which I'm glad for, I would never what so much pressure on you," right after Draco says this he presses his lips to Harry's in a soft quick kiss.
We were walking into the classroom, Hermione in front of me when I was yanked into the hallway. I didn't know what was happening until I was pulled into an abandoned classroom and pushed up against the wall.
"Siriusly (sorry, I had to) did you really think I would have wanted PURPLE curtains in our bedroom? It's like you don't even know me at all!" He says looking hurt.
Harry was sitting up, looking down at Draco who was laying down with his head in Harrys lap. They were just talking about random little things, learning some little stories they didn't know about each other, which isn't much considering that they've been together for six years.
"He's probably swallowing Theo's tongue," Hermione answered as they made their way to their second period.
"HARRY JAMES POTTER, I KNOW YOU DID NOT SWEAR IN THIS HOUSEHOLD, FOR FUCKS SAKE, WE ARE INNOCENT CHILDREN OF GOD. PRAY RIGHT NOW, YOUNG MAN." He hears his dad burst out, laughing so hard he starts wheezing. "OH, SO YOU THINK IT'S FUNNY, DO YOU?"
I assumed I was correct when he put his hands under my arse to hold me up. He licked my bottom lip, asking for entrance, but I decided to decline, wanting to know what he'd do.
I sat down on the stool, noticing that my parents were sitting in the back. Just seeing them makes me want to cry or scream.
Once they arrive at their destination they get out. Draco waits as Harry gets the Basket out of the back and locks the car once all the doors are shut.
Harry takes Draco's hand and drags him to his bed. He pushes Malfoy on said bed and climbs in next to him. He wraps his arms around his waist as Draco puts his head in the crook of his neck.
Draco stayed behind while the others walked ahead. As Harry was walking past him he lightly elbowed him, "The name's Harry."
I walk over to him with my hands behind my back so he can't see the gift I bought him. He looks up and quickly puts his hands behind his back and I could have sworn I saw a slight blush appear on his face, that's weird but it's whatever.
"Not yet." He gets up from the bed and pulls out a 7in vibrator, it being 2 inches smaller than himself. He can't have Draco finding a toy that can do his job, can he?
"Yes, Scarface, I'll be fine," I smiled, poking him in the side. He laughed while pushing my hand away. He looks at me with a sad smile.
Harry pulls out of the driveway and they head off. Draco turns on the radio, not too loud but just loud enough for some background music. Harry puts his hand on Draco's thigh which makes him beam with delight. He has told Harry how much he adores the little touches here and there.
It's another five minutes before she points to a car pulling in while saying, "that's her, come on." She takes draco by the wrist and drags him to the car.
Harry puts the basket in the trunk as Draco gets in the passenger seat of their car. Once Harry closes the trunk he gets into the car and starts it up.
"Harry, hurry up!" Draco yells to his boyfriend, becoming impatient. He's been standing by the door, waiting with the weaved basket, for almost 10 minutes.
I do love my mom but she's still part of the problem, I hope she doesn't hate me after this. I honestly don't give a shit about what my father thinks, though.
"That's easy for you to say, you've already found your soulmate. Speaking of which, when do I get to meet her?"
Lily and James had left their best friends to babysit their 7 month old baby, Harry, so they could have a weekend to themselves.
He never would just go up to someone with green eyes and touch them, no, he's way too awkward for that. He tries to get at least a glimpse of their nails to see if they could possibly be the one. But they never are.
I take a deep breath as I grab my guitar and slowly start to walk out onto the small stage of the night cafe.
"Harry, I'm fine, you didn't need to tackle the bitch," Draco laughed slightly. Harry, seeing Draco laugh, started to smile at him, pulling him into another hug.
"I guess I'm always gonna be the bad child, I guess I'm always gonna be the mad child, cause you will never understand my weird mind, my weird mind."
Harry arrived at the dungeon just 5 minutes later and walks in after saying the password that Draco had told him.
"Oh, seriously Ronald, he isn't Satan, you need to get over your grudge against him, what is it he even did?" Hermione had a point, he always hated him without explaining why, he just told Harry he hated him one day and he just went along with it, no questions asked.
Harry realizes that he really does only have about five minutes to get ready now. "Fuck," he whispers, knowing if it was any louder his mom would hear. That woman's hearing was scary sometimes. He then hears it, his worst nightmare.
To his surprise Draco Malfoy had opened the door. He had bags under his eyes and he had tears drying on his cheeks. His eyes looked blood shot. He had a jacket on that was zipped up to his chin.
"Of course you will, you're my ride home, duh," I looked at him sarcastically as he rolled his eyes.
Harry grabbed his invisibility cloak, the Marauder's map, and his phone, then he was off to the ROR. Harry put the cloak on and opened the map, "I solemnly swear that I am up to no good."
Harry laughed while shaking his head, knowing that George was driving so they probably won't be there for another 15 minutes.
"First off, when did you begin to tell ME what to do, it's the other way around. And second, I don't want us to do anything until you tell me what's upsetting you, I don't care if it doesn't matter, tell me." Harry was surprised, the blonde is acting like he cares.
"Harry, I'm sorry bud but could you like shut up, please and thank you?" He says making Harry cry harder. "No? Ok then." He wasn't really awake enough to try and get the baby back to sleep so what should he do?
"Can you guys just leave, please, it's way too early for this shit." Hermione elbows Harry in the ribs, chastising him for his vulgar language.
Harry was about to get down and start helping when Draco stopped him, flustered. "It's fine, just go to class," that's when he got everything situated and left.
I heard Hermione and Ron quickly running after me. They didn't say anything but I knew they were both eye balling me and each other.
Around a month ago Harry had realized that he had come to like, maybe even love, Draco. He knew the feelings would never be returned but he sucked it up, at least he has this with him.
"You're going to get pneumonia, you know." He shouts as Harry had just jumped from one puddle to another. "No I won't, and even if I do you'll take care of me no matter how much you say you won't!" Draco just shakes his head while laughing, knowing very well that he's right. Harry knew it too.
Harry smiles at his adorable boyfriend, admiring how he looks in his outfit. Draco is wearing a pastel pink cropped sweater, high waisted, white jean shorts with pastel pink fishnets underneath, his pastel pink converse, and to top it all off, a pastel yellow, pink, and purple flower crown sitting on his head.
"Yes, love, of course," Harry says as he gives Draco a peck on the cheek, taking the basket from him, and opening the door for him. Draco happily skips out of the house.
The bell rang and they waved, going to separate classes. Ron hugged Theo goodbye and started following Harry into the classroom.
"You're actually going to work with him? I'd thought you'd just have Malfoy do all the work." Hermione elbowed him.
He put me down and said "meet me by the Slytherin dorms tonight at midnight, don't be late or you will have consequences."
"That actually sounds really good, I'd like that." Harry nods, takes his boyfriend by the hand and leads them to his dorm to take a nap.
Harry just had a sad smile and asked him if he was ok because he heard what sounded like glass shattering.
Harry looks over at Draco who is, quite literally, bouncing in excitement. "Babe, you need to calm down," Harry chuckles in admiration for his boy.
Once they had eaten, Harry tried to feed a strawberry to Draco but he was turned away so when he turned back around he got it smooched on his face. They both just laughed and Draco grabbed a napkin from the basket to wipe off the chocolate.
"Wanted to taste," Harry replied like it was normal. Draco just scoffed but let it go. They ate the remaining strawberries while just admiring the scenery.
"You got a little," Harry said while pointing to his chin, trying to tell Draco there was some remaining chocolate. Draco just rolled his eyes.
After Draco got all the pictures he wanted, which was three 10 packs of film, much to Harry's displeasure, Harry found it adorable but wouldn't admit it, they sat back down on the blanket and just talked.
He gathered himself together before opening his door to find...nothing. Harry wasn't in there, he whines and pouts.
Once they arrive at their destination they get out. Draco waits as Harry gets the Basket out of the back and locks the car once all the doors are shut.
“Draco. We need to leave now,” Harry cut in, looking at Hermione sobbing on the floor with no emotion. It made Draco shiver.
Harry is immediately blown away by his new roommate. He has the palest skin, with hair like polished marble. It is in a neat bun on the nape of his neck. He isn't handsome, or even attractive. He is beautiful; he is elegant; he is all sharp angles and smooth skin. Harry blushes thinking about it.
“No, I’ll go. I’d like to get to know you, too.” Draco says firmly. Harry looks surprised for a moment, then smiles.
Without warning, he flipped Draco around and pushed his chest onto the table. He positioned him just so that Draco’s cock hung off the edge of the table. Harry still cast a cushioning charm on the edge of the table, just to make Draco more comfortable. In response, Draco sighed and settled down into the desk.
“I’m sorry, y’know.” Draco stopped sipping his tea and turned to face the beast. Its face was sheepish, and a bit regretful.
“I strongly advice that you cease this behavior, Draco. Your little escapades will not go unnoticed for long.”
“Don’t think that I didn’t see you and Apollo, Kouroi,” she said, her voice low and threatening. “He was all over you and you didn’t even try to push him off!”
He cautiously made his way to the gigantic front doors of the palace. He left his horse in the stable and walked up to the palace doors, pushing them open. Rusty creaks filled the air. Inside the palace was very beautiful in a rustic sort of way. Gigantic crystal chandeliers hung from the domed ceiling, shining a light on the large dining table that was surely the length of his own humble abode, if not twice that. For some strange reason, on the dining table, there were plates of food and several bowls of soup.
“Draco!” Draco smiled softly as the old man, Mr. Dumbledore, hobbled over to him. He was quite old but extremely wise.
He sighs as he mindlessly scrolls through his Instagram feed. It’s getting a bit tiring, honestly, and he’s considering asking everybody to stop because his phone is starting to glitch from the massive influx of booty pictures.
Unfortunately, Draco couldn’t just summon the potion because it was in the back room. If he even tried to magick something out of there, it would probably crash into other things and he would end up with all of his extra potions on the floor.
As Scrimgeour’s blood (and some of his brains) splattered against the chair, Draco looked back up at Harry.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Don’t be so crass, Harry. And just be patient, you’ll see soon.” He picked up the remote from the counter and switched on the kitchen TV that Harry had installed just for him.
He noticed a piece of paper tucked underneath it. With no small amount of trepidation, he took it, careful not to tip the flowers out of the vase and unfolded it.
When he finally got Harry to his bed, he had smiled softly when he noticed a small teddy bear on his bed.
With a clap of his hands, some instruments at the back of the room floated upwards and started playing themselves. The song was slow and soft, the perfect kind of tune for a slow dance.
Harry takes a deep breath, grips Draco’s arse (tighter than he should, if he’s being honest) and starts to write on it. His hands shake ever so slightly, and he curses quietly as he dots his ‘t’ instead of crossing it.
It took several months of pleading and begging (and making several large, suggestive donations to the asylum) before the admin
Draco was willing to do everything it took to survive, even if it meant sacrificing the whole human race.
Once the audience dies down, Harry adds in, “If I may add, it was quite a lovely behind. Like, I’m flattered that my name is on it, to be honest.”
As he walked away from Potter’s cell, Potter said something that made him inadvertently freeze in his tracks.
They spent the next hour eating, drinking, laughing and talking happily. It was easily the best date of Draco’s life, even though they were both in sweatpants and old T-shirts.
“Leave him alone.” He had demanded, to their astonishment. The man looked shocked at first, then sneered.
“But-but-” Harry silenced him with a soft kiss. “Please don’t cry, love. Everything will be alright.”
“Want some more?” Draco nodded desperately and pushed his arse up. He knew better than to speak up now.
“Fuck, Harry.” He groaned. He reached down to stroke his cock and mewled when Harry slapped his hand away.
Without further ado, he cast a wandless lube charm on his fingers and rubbed them together to warm it up a bit. Then, he rubbed his middle finger against Draco’s pink hole, making it look shiny and absolutely edible. Draco gasped and bucked his hips. Harry gave it another small lick, before pushing in the tip of his middle finger, just enough to stretch Draco’s hole by the smallest amount.
“You’re doing so well, love.” Harry praised as he thrust his finger inside Draco slowly, being careful not to hurt the blond.
“Thank you, I guess.” Draco rose an eyebrow at the gift. As far as mirrors went, it was very beautiful -the gold border of it was encrusted with sparkling diamonds and glittering emeralds- but it was just… a
The small pieces sprayed everywhere as they fell to the tile floor, some of the shards drawing blood and forming small cuts on his arm.
Draco heard some muffled voices on the other side of the door. Perhaps they were just some more household objects. Perhaps he was just running mad. Who knew?
“Like I give a fuck.” Draco muttered. The beast growled, but it didn’t give any other indication that it had heard him.
“Same as every day. Quite mundane, honestly. And also, Cedric is still trying to court me.” Draco grimaced.
Draco should have expected it to happen sooner or later, but it was still a surprise when the entire building was put into lockdown because Harry Potter had escaped from his cell.
Despite himself, Draco flushed softly. “I know, mother. It’s just… you tend to overdo it sometimes.”
His mother was sitting on the bed, looking a bit healthier than she did when Draco had left her. Mr. Dumbledore was sitting next to her on a chair, talking to her, and feeding her spoonfuls of soup. He could see their lips move, but he could hear no sound.
He quickly finished it off and looked around to make sure that nobody had seen him. Thankfully, nobody was watching him, and he used the opportunity to swipe and lick away the rest of the honey that had seeped onto his mouth and chin.
“Draco was interested in Harry from the first day, but he didn’t really start acting weird until he became Harry Potter’s psychiatrist. His
Draco smirked and walked up to Harry, making the skirt hike up even more, although a bulge was already forming in the middle.
Harry doesn't know what Hogwarts is like yet, but from the website he had already started taking a liking to it. It had homey feel to it. Plus, his parents had gone here.
"Your feet." Harry looks at him pointedly. Draco sniffs. He usually doesn't have to share the couch with anyone at home, so he just has to compromise.
“I want to see my mother.” He whispered. Suddenly, a misty fog started to gather in the mirror and swirl around until it formed an image. He gasped.
“Fuck, I’m coming!” He cried. Harry pressed against his prostate insistently, and Draco was screaming his release. He gasped and clutched the bedsheets tightly as he came, moaning incomprehensible words and babbling helplessly. He vaguely felt Harry climax into him as well, and as he calmed down, he felt Harry’s come drip out of his hole slowly.
As he made his way through the long, bare streets, he let his mind drift to other events. Like Aphrodite’s party. He honestly couldn’t even remember why she was hosting it in the first place, but Aphrodite seized any chance she got to hold parties, so he wasn’t surprised. As usual, all of the gods on Olympus were invited, as well as several nymphs and elemental spirits. Her parties were always the most lavish out of all the Olympians’, and Draco was expecting at least a thousand people to attend.
He could see the town square clearly from where he was, and all the villagers were gathered there for some reason. On the podium was Cedric himself.
How was it his fault that people wanted to take Draco away from him? Harry knew better. He knew just how much everybody despised their relationship and hid it under barely-polished veneers of politeness.
Nothing had worked. He had bought Draco gifts, pampered him, and everything else he could think of. This was the only thing left he hadn’t tried.
Potter walked up to his counter with a sullen look on his face, although as he approached the main counter (and the abundance of lavender candles) he slowly started to relax.
Before he can speak up again, the audience of the show in the large auditorium cheer loudly, making both men laugh.
“Fuck, Draco!” Harry hissed as the blond tightened around his cock, sending waves of pleasure through him.
Draco smiled and rolled his eyes at the three of them. “I promise I will. I’ll see you three later!”
Draco tried to concentrate on it, but the pain from his stomach and ankle and his head were making his mind foggy.
“Hello, Chief. How are you faring?” Malfoy grinned widely and leaned against the unpainted concrete walls, not more than six feet away from Rufus. He gulped, and suddenly the room felt smaller than it already was.
The only reason he was even outside at all was because Hermione had forced him to go get some ‘fresh air’ as if he needed it. He snorted. He was a
As it was, now Harry had to listen to her rant and nag and lecture him about lagging behind on his godly duties. Surely, the world could survive on its own for just
Potter scowled. “Shut it, Malfoy. Anyways, I came for a Calming Draught. And some of those lavender candles you’ve got.”
Draco covered his mouth, sliding to the tile floor and muffling the sobs that came out of his mouth with his hand.
However, I've taken my time to like plan the book out and add more tags to it. I don't know if I'll write smut just yet.
“Nice car.” He said in awe. Even though he had a Porsche (his father had refrained from buying him a Lamborghini) it wasn’t nearly as nice as Harry’s car.
Over the years, humans had become smarter and colder. Most people lived alone, save the lucky few who managed to find love in a cold world like this.
“I thought I got rid of you, Greyback.” It growled, towering over Greyback. It bashed Greyback’s head against the tree again for good measure. Draco could hazily see the bloodstains it left behind.
Harry and Draco sat in the back silently of the room as their crew members argued and shouted and screamed at each other.
His attempts were futile, and as the chariot dove into the earth, the large crack above him sealed shut and cut off all the sunlight from reaching him.
The mirror was surrounded by broken glass, and only half of the glass was left. Draco peered at it curiously, when suddenly a mist gathered in the mirror and started to swirl. He gasped when a picture formed in the mirror.
It had been over a month since the forest incident, and they had fallen into a comfortable sort of banter between themselves. Draco didn’t know what to make of it.
Harry staggered, clutching at the hilt of the sword disbelievingly. With a final burst of anger, he drew back his fist and punched Cedric as hard as he could. He heard his skull crack, but he was too distracted to think about that.
“What do you think?” He asked the small, unassuming butterfly. Its antennae twitched and bobbed happily, totally unaware of the mini crisis Draco was going through.
Harry snorted. The one time Hermione had convinced him to go into the upper world, he had managed to fall head over heels for somebody he had never even met before.
After a minute, he kept on walking quickly, trying to look for familiar surroundings. Soon, he found what looked to be the kitchens. There were many animated objects at work, but Draco pushed his way past all of them. He grabbed a satchel from the wall and started stuffing it with anything he could get his hands on; apples, small loaves of bread, jams, knives. If he was leaving, he might as well be prepared.
“Yes, Granger, I understand how dangerous he is,” Draco said, waving off her concerns. He was much too excited to finally have a session with Potter, and he was already determined not to fall into his trap.
“Why should I?” Draco asked, raising an eyebrow. None of the astronauts on the Skeld were friends (well, none that he knew of anyways), and Draco didn’t plan on becoming close to any of them.
“Draco Malfoy.” He replies. He holds out his hand. Harry stares at it for a moment, then quickly shakes it. Harry’s hands are calloused and strangely warm, as if there’s a flame inside his hands.
As he smoothed his hair over, he heard a knock on the door. As it opened, he steeled himself and stood up to face the beast.
“Good luck. He’s already started to gather some drunk satyrs. He’s probably going to hold another keg stand contest.”
In a split-second, Cedric’s two cronies walked up to Draco and pinned his arms behind his back, ignoring the blond’s cry of outrage and his angry kicks.
“Yes?” Draco asked. For some odd reason, he thought he heard a growl come from where Harry was standing.
For the last three days, they've been going regularly and watching the sunset from the bug window. And each time, Harry spends at least half of his time admiring Draco's smooth pale skin, his sharp jawline, his slightly pouty lips.
“Harry!” He was knocked out of his train of thought when a small, soft hand tapped his shoulder. He spun around, about to blast the foolish person away, but he froze when he saw that it was just Hestia.
“Thanks.” Draco flushed, wearing it. It smelled of pumpkin spice and an earthier, richer scent. It was too big on him, the sleeves dwarfing his arms and the hem of it reaching his mid thighs.
“A wardrobe, obviously. But if you’re asking for my name, it’s Pansy.” The wardrobe replied disdainfully. Draco wondered how a
And with those words, King Harry Potter and Consort King Draco Potter-Malfoy fell into a peaceful slumber.
The International Space Exploration Committee had sent Draco and eleven other astronauts to the Skeld, one of the newer space stations, to perform a routine check up.
Harry’s demeanor instantly turned much brighter, and Draco gasped as Harry’s gloved fingers dug even further into his hips. “Oh, dear, I’ll make sure you’ll remember this for a
“You know, my uncle used to beat me up a lot,” Potter cut in, as nonchalantly as if he was talking about the weather. Draco felt his eyes widen. What?
“Shut up!” The last thing Draco saw was the swinging of a large fist towards his temple before everything went black.
Harry ignored the pleas of Ron and Hermione as they tried to convince him to get away from the mirror.
Harry can barely stop eye-fucking him on the spot. It doesn't help that he's wearing a V-neck, from which his collarbone peeked out teasingly. It also doesn't help that he's wearing tailored trousers (Harry could tell) which accent the slight curve of his hips and his long, nimble legs. The black Cuban heels only make it sexier.
Draco smiled to himself as he stroked the wings of a butterfly that had landed on his hair. Its wings were black and red, and they looked magnificent. Its antennae bobbed happily as he rubbed its head affectionately. It was very warm, for some reason, but he didn’t mind.
Draco was smitten and embarrassed at the same time. He was sure that his entire face was tomato red.
“Not again.” Thallo sighed, pinching the bridge of her freckled nose. “Good morning Draco. Do come inside already, although Carpo is right. You do need to be more careful.” With a wave of her hand, the gates opened, revealing the beauty and glory of Mount Olympus.
“Fuck, you look so pretty here, Dray.” And Harry was licking there again, but this time he didn’t stop, and Draco could only moan and gasp as Harry continued to eat him out. Harry threw all caution to the wind, simply laving his tongue over his hole and sucking hard and flicking the tip of his tongue and scraping his teeth against it and burrowing in it and anything and
Xenon was the name of the planet that Harry was from, although he usually shortened it to X for some weird reason.
Before he could sit down to eat, he felt a warm breath on his neck. Trembling, he turned around slowly and came face to face with a monstrous creature.
Harry couldn’t believe it. He looked at his chest and found no stab wound from where the sword had pierced him.
Harry had stared at him for one moment before hastily making his way over to him, knocking over the camera stand as he ran.
Draco, however, seemed against it. He was struggling against the ropes that bound him to a chair and a crying
As he stormed away in the cold, a large hand on his shoulder pulled him back. He winced as Cormac shoved him into the brick wall of the shop.
Surprisingly, it had cleaned up well. Its horns and calves were gleaming, and its claws were trimmed to a much shorter length than they were before. It was wearing a midnight blue cloak over a white shirt- which was partially unbuttoned, showing Draco its hairy, human chest- and matching blue trousers.
“Draco? Are you listening?” Draco snapped out of his thoughts as he remembered that Granger had asked him a question before. Right.
Draco stared in shock. First of all, how was Potter out of his restraints? And secondly, why did Potter call him by his first name? For some reason, the second problem was bothering him much more than the first one.
“Where am I?” He wondered groggily before the events of before caught up to him painfully. He sat up abruptly, ignoring the pain in his head. He needed to get out
“Uh, no, but I can ask my dad!” She piped up, cheerfully. She opened her mouth to talk again, but she was interrupted by a much older voice.
The waitress handed them their drinks and left. Draco eyed the open bottle warily. It looked… alright.
It wasn’t easy finding one, but after months of surviving by himself, he had found a brothel instead.
Draco got up, dusting off his alloyed jeans as he walked back to his hover-house. He usually attracted people because of his exotic looks. There weren’t many natural blonds anymore; being a platinum blond was even rarer.
He stabbed and hacked and swung ferociously, but they still managed to bite his side, making him scream in agony.
messy, but artfully messy. He gets up and walks with Harry into the hallway, the living room and to the front door. He grabs his black overcoat from the rack; it is a rather chilly September for some reason. Plus, it looks extremely sexy on him.
All it took was a few drops of a Calming Drought and a Confusing Concoction in Draco’s water, and he was as good as immobile.
like the attention sometimes, but it was quickly starting to become overbearing. Besides, the only reason they wanted him was because of his beauty. If they had actually bothered to speak to him and get to know bit, he could have possibly considered them, but they only lusted after his looks.
Draco smiled softly to himself as he inhaled the fragrant scent of the scarlet red rose he had just plucked from his meadow. Its petals were still as soft as rabbit down, and the small drops of morning dew reflected the bright moonlight in broken beams. Its thorns were still sharp and curved, but Draco knew how to hold rose stems properly. He was the god of springtime, after all. If he didn’t know how to hold them properly, then who would, really?
Draco typed them into his boots and grabbed his bubble helmet as he walked out of the house. He slipped the helmet over his head as his boots flew him away.
At that moment, with the beast laughing softly at him and everybody watching on happily, he felt… content.
“Do you like it?” Draco asked smugly, as if he already knew that he had succeeded on whatever he was trying to accomplish. Well, he certainly did.
“You’re lucky I like the tough ones, blondie.” Right as he was about to lunge at Draco, something pushed the man out of the way, sending him into a tree. Draco’s heart dropped when he realized it was the beast. And he looked
It turned to Draco, its features looking worriedly. As it lifted Draco up from the ground, Draco passed out.
He lit his cigar by lowering it to a glowing piece of magma next to his arm. It caught quickly and lit on fire, igniting a small flame that warmed his cold fingers. He took a deep inhale of it and savored the fumes in his lungs, before breathing out the fragrant smoke. Unlike the mortals, he could do this for as long as he wanted without suffering any after effects, unlike the way their throats became torn or the way their lungs shriveled up like a wilting seedling. He snorted.
devastatingly handsome, but he’s probably not even gay. Not to talk of crushing on the biggest twink in the entire
“Honestly, I don’t know. This might be the only way to break the curse, but why would he even fall in love with
“You menace,” he sighed. “Anyway, he was very bipolar, to be honest. He was quite… flirty, as well.”
He stepped in slowly, the familiar bell on the door ringing to let the librarian know that he was inside.
He got up, groaning as he stretched. He started making his way to the other side of the palace. The west wing.
“I shall have you soon, my dear. It is only a matter of time.” He said proudly. Before Draco could respond, Cedric kissed his forehead and strutted away, obviously satisfied with himself.
Draco whimpered again, but it was cut short into a breathless moan as Harry spread his arse cheeks and licked his hole.
For a moment, he was paralyzed, the image of his mother bleeding to death and the fire raging through the Manor.
.” He moaned breathlessly. Harry left several more marks behind before he drifted lower. He bit gently at Draco’s collarbone, and Draco whined as he started to twist his nipples with his fingers.
He only watched intently as Apollo dragged his darling out of the corner they were in, and out of the palace entirely. He caught a glimpse of his darling’s exasperated, silver eyes as they momentarily flashed towards him. Harry froze. The moment their gaze met, he was sure that-
He picked up his quill and started to write down his notes from his case. Well, he might as well focus on the task on hand while he had the chance.
A loud sigh cut through Malfoy’s rant, which made Malfoy instantly perk up, but Rufus immediately braced himself for the worst.
“That would be six drachmas,” she said absently, moving to the back of the stand to bring out more cakes.
He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He needed to focus well in order to teleport. Usually, he would morph into a dove and fly away, but he had lingered for too long this time. As soon as he concentrated solely on his essence, blinding flash of light appeared, and Draco winked out of existence.
Draco laughed into his chest. He allowed Harry to whisk him away from the ballroom. On the way, he caught his parents’ eyes. Narcissa winked at them. With the palace physicians back, Harry had arranged for her to receive the best medicines in the kingdom. She had recovered very quickly, to Draco’s delight. Lucius raised his glass to Draco, winking. He scowled at Harry, however, who simply responded by making a face. His father was still wary of Harry, but Draco knew that he would come around soon enough.
Draco sighed in relief. He stood up properly and turned to face Hermione, who was staring at him in shock and…
constellation twinkled brightly in the sky, and Draco mentally traced out the shape. Of course, it looked nothing like a woman, but that was what the imagination was for, anyways.
“Draco.” Even half-dead, his father’s voice was still joyful. Draco propped him up against a tree and began rinsing the wounds on his leg and stomach. His father winced but didn’t complain once.
Draco demolished at least six slices of toast before calming down. He ignored the curious stares of the beast from across the table. This was some of the best food he had ever tasted, and damn him if he wasn’t going to enjoy it.
Draco shrugged. It wasn’t any of his business. As long as he got paid, he didn't care. He plopped himself down onto the grass, marveling at the feel. Harry sat next to him.
hadn’t decided to teach him useless skills throughout the afternoon, he definitely would have had more time to find something better to wear.
Harry got a small ball from his pocket and threw it onto the ground, where it let up several large bursts of purple smoke. Draco heard Hermione’s coughs and screams, but all he could focus on was Harry grabbing his waist and pulling him away. Away from the life he had created for himself.
Enraged, Draco grabbed a plate from the table and slammed it onto the beast’s chest. It didn’t flinch, nor did its skin tear. Draco’s did, however, when the ceramic shards slashed into his palm, drawing streams of blood to the surface.
In the rest of the hour, he dabbed the crushed mulberries onto his lips, lined his eyes with powdered charcoal and soaked his hands, legs and hair in basins of goat milk, rose petals and rosemary. He dried his hair with a warm wind and wore it loose, only tucking a small lotus flower behind his ear. He rubbed his ears and wrists in spring water infused with the fragrance of lilies and jasmines. Then, he rubbed powdered gold onto his cheeks, just to give them an extra shine. Lastly, he slipped on his crown and charmed the cloudberries stems to sprout their sunset red and pumpkin orange berries.
“Eh. It’s not really a big deal anymore.” He brought the cup to his lips and took a small sip. It was hot and tasted like chamomile. It was just what he needed.
, for God’s sake) Harry parked next to the garden, where several albino peacocks were strutting imperiously.
Each table in the back was big enough to fit about eight people, compared to the smaller four seaters around the front. There were also booths aligning the wall.
He brushed off his lab coat and walked out of the room in a fake rage, making sure to slam the door behind him.
Draco made his way, speechless, over to the closest row. He plucked a tome off of the first shelf and looked at the title.
did not want to do this, but there was no way he was going to turn down such an amazing opportunity.
They all paled in comparison to Apollo, however, who had persistently pursued him for longer than he could remember and had offered him a numerous amount of valuable gifts almost every day. He
“Lord Hades?” Harry snapped out of his thought to see King Aeacus staring at him, with slight concern in his eyes.
!” Draco cried out, bucking wildly on the desk. Harry pressed down on it even harder, making Draco instinctively close his legs and clamp down on Harry’s fingers. Harry smacked his arse again and shoved his legs back open.
the God of the dead and the Ruler of the Underworld. In all his several millennia, Harry had never seen any creature as arrogant as she.
They both got down and walked up to the door. Once Draco had scanned his thumb into the fingerpad, the doors opened, revealing a very large living room. Draco turned around to look at Harry.
After Harry had cleared the table (Draco had offered to help but Harry shooed him away) they both lounged on the couch to watch a movie.
Draco rolled his eyes. “I would be much happier if they avoided me, thank you very much. I don’t know how or why you still tolerate me.”
Harry snorted. “You should be telling that to Dionysus, not me.” He looked pointedly at Dionysus, who was holding at least six glasses of wine in his hands. He already looked drunk, even though it hadn’t even been up to three hours since the party had started.
“And then Potter broke out of his cell one day, and we were all put into lockdown. I was in a room with Draco, and I don’t know how, but
Harry grinned at him widely. “You’ll love it. Come on, we’re nearly there.” Their flat was a few minutes away from Hogsmeade, which Draco now knew was like a miniature town on its own. It consisted of shopping centers, restaurants, pubs, coffee shops and many other small businesses.
During dinner, the beast had requested that he change into formal clothes for some strange reason. He had raised an eyebrow but didn’t comment. Pansy had chosen out a long black jacket for him over a fitted white shirt and cream trousers. She had forced him to wear a corset under the shirt, the bitch. His waist was uncomfortable, but he supposed that it looked fashionable or whatever.
"You could have expressed your animosity in thousands of ways, but going after someone who is under my protection, endangering a case I am building against people who injured my best friend … big mistake and I will make sure that you will have a long, long time to regret it!"
In the past, the Potion Master might have been concerned about Harry Potter when it came to Draco's schemes. The animosity between them had been too well known at Hogwarts. But these last few weeks, he had watched the pair and their every-day interactions. He was sure that Draco would never harm the boy, as certainly as Severus himself would have never considered laying a finger on Lily. No, from all the bad things that could happen to his godson, he was sure that Draco would rather drink the poison than let Harry take it.
Reluctantly, the witch studied the pair before turning around, wrapping her arm around a smaller figure, who had stayed hidden in the shadows until now. She seemed fragile, insubstantial even, despite the hood of her cloak hiding her face. Her slim body was trembling ever so slightly. Drawing the right conclusions, Draco indicated a bow and inquired, "Astoria, what can we do …" Then the girl lowered her hood.
"Lady Rosier," Neville bowed, "we are sorry for your loss and apologise for the intrusion, but we have a few questions."
Stepping closer, Harry studied the other wizard. Both knew how incredibly lenient he was with his vassal. Still, the question remained, "Then why don't you?"
Slowly drifting into sleep, Severus wondered why the gesture had felt so right and so wrong at the same time.
"Three!" She finished, in time with their heartbeats, all aiming at the empty space where Sirius name ought to be. In one voice they chanted.
Smiling at the goblin's snapped question, apparently, he did not like the concept of anything being considered more valuable than gold, Ron just met Harry's eyes, knowing that his best friend already understood, but replying nonetheless, "That I was envied by every last pureblood in the castle, and especially Harry, because I was richer than the lot of them."
Snape! Harry was still too out of it to do anything but obey, when his professor used that tone. "Sir," he acknowledged his professor, watching him leave the field to get his two best friends. He downed the steaming potion Hermione pushed into his stiff fingers, as soon as he had landed; gratefully trading his broom for the warmed blanket Ron wrapped around his shoulders.
With a quiet curse, Draco dashed towards the nearest exit to save their gardens. Offering the milk, Harry suggested to Narcissa, "Maybe you could join Neville for a little planning session. He doesn't know what you want to put in your vegetable garden after all." With a grateful smile, the Lady Malfoy took the canister and left for the kitchen.
Taking a deep breath, Ron cut off his brother's rambling in a hoarse voice, "It's alright, Bill, thanks."
Draco had heard of these strange, muggle inventions but, much like anything else muggle, the need for it eluded him. The weak light, however, seemed to fascinate his companions, for their eyes seemed drawn to it. So, he simply crawled into bed, when Harry opened his arms for him and was asleep almost instantly.
"And that you shared her warmth since you were a hair's width away from hypothermic shock," Narcissa added, running a wand over his slightly trembling form. The moment the parchment from the diagnostic spell detached from its tip, she handed the wand back to Ron.
Once back at Grimmauld Place, they all but fell into their separate showers, scrubbing away the grime that had gathered in every nook and cranny before taking a late supper. Bidding his guests good−night an hour later, Harry went upstairs to go through the evening routine. Only when he slipped onto the window−sill did he allow himself to shiver and let all the memories and emotions, he had suppressed today, wash over him.
"Well, he is the last remaining heir of the Black family and therefore the head of my house, since Lucius has entered the Rite of Compulsory Surrender with him."
The blond would have been surprised by the tender tone, so unusual for the battle-hardened Auror, had he not heard it countless times these last few weeks whenever Harry was talking to Emerald. Since the raven-haired seemed determined to put on a show, he lowered his eyes and whispered softly, "Yes, my Lord." He could not help but feel comforted by the small kiss the raven-haired pressed on his forehead, before turning towards the former Death Eater with a predatory smile. "In fact, it was Draco who offered. And while we were not exactly friends at school, he has yet to disappoint me. I would even go so far and say that he has risen to any challenge I have presented him with." Scrutinizing the two wizards before him, the 'saviour' casually pointed his wand at his vassal, noting how Dolohov instantly reached for his sleeve. "Lucius has not made me regret my leniency either. He has certainly put his skills to good use, and I must admit that both he and Narcissa satisfy. Not that I expected anything less of pure-bloods of their upbringing, and with their … talents."
Perplexed, Lucius clarified, "A Weasley, … an ordinary wizard getting paid by goblins … for curse−breaking?"
"No, please, no more …" pureblood pleaded deliriously. "I don't know of any … any cells of the Children of Hecate. Please, … have mercy."
'No,' Severus imagined. In young Harry Potter's mind, being able to do something, being able to protect someone, was a sufficient reason to do it. How willing fully blind had he been to see even the tiniest resemblance to James Potter in that boy? Harry deserved so much better, he was ashamed to admit to himself.
Since spying had been second nature to him for the majority of his adult life, Severus Snape barely needed a conscious thought to determine if the house was empty. Therefore, when he felt a little peckish one afternoon, he decided that a trip to the kitchen was in order. He could have called upon the elves, but he had been self-sufficient his entire life and did not plan on giving that up now. Well, at least not in the afternoon. After all, Draco was the only one around and after spending the morning theorising over the librarian's research, the boy … young man had bowed off after their shared lunch. Most likely to return to his sacred lab. An impulse Severus could entirely understand, and he had to suppress his envy that his godson had that chance.
Behind them, the Lady Malfoy was not as easily convinced to take something that was not hers. "Blood will work, Harry. You don't have to …"
"I hate this," Draco breathed to wetly. "I hate that this bitch or the Dark … for Tom to have so much power over me still. It's over! Why can't I let it go?"
At Draco's incredulous look, Ron emphasised. "Look, I don't … you were a bastard, back at school; an arrogant, little snit that got away with far too much. But in the end, the three of us gave as good as we got and all the bad things you tried to do … everything you did, happened under pressure. That was not a Horcrux tainting your soul. You were an asshole, and you were scared, but you were never evil."
But he could. Harry could sense the miniscule tensing of Draco's posture after that revelation. The blond had warned him of the dangers he could unleash if Harry gave him unrestricted access to his library. But the young Auror had not cared. True, at that time, they had discussed potions texts, with no laboratory or wand in sight. But even as his 'servant's' liberties had increased, Draco had never given Harry cause for concern. Trusting his former rival had not been a conscious decision on his part. It had just been a natural progression from the moment the blond had appeared on his doorstep.
"Not really, it's just …" Harry trailed his finger through his hair. "Some things have a way of leaving a mark on your soul. Until now, Draco was …," he sighed. "I just wish it didn't have to be him. But I must admit that I am glad that he found the courage. It was the right thing to do."
Of course everything I did was the bad thing, to my father, that is. Although, he never told others, too ashamed that his son was never going to live up to the Malfoy name.
As Draco was dragging him to a couch that was in the room he started becoming upset. He started thinking about how this was what all of their interactions will be like. He started getting a bit angry but tried to not let it show.
Once he was dressed, he grabbed his bag and phone, and ran downstairs to eat some breakfast. "Wow, you're up early," his mom commented. Harry just shrugged.
Harry and Draco also had a different agreement. Well that was until Harry started catching feelings for the blonde. Their agreement was, what some would say, "fuck buddies".
He did love the color but had grown to resent it. He hated the amount of people that have green eyes, no matter how many people he sees with green eyes, they're not his soulmate.
Pansy just acted like she didn't hear him, "so, Blasil, you do know you really are whipped for him though, right?"
Draco sighs and looks down, ashamed, "That's because I didn't know how you'd take it. I thought, well, basically everything that you thought."
Once they got out of the car, Ron was complaining about a headache, which everyone else ignored. Once they got into the school Ginny came running up to them and began to hang on Harry's arm.
"YOU DIDN'T! " Remus shouts while attacking Sirius by kicking his legs and smacking the back of his head repeatedly.
He couldn't, this was his fault, for agreeing to this. Draco sat on the couch as Harry kneeled down in front of him. Harry reached out to unzip Draco's trousers but Draco stopped him, apparently seeing the boy's emotions clear on his face.
"I've missed you, baby," Harry says, putting their foreheads together. "I hate having to hide our relationship." Draco sighs.
Once they got to lunch they just got their food and sat at a random table. Harry looked around, hoping to spot the blonde, when he did he noticed that he was sitting alone, reading a book, not eating.
He just would ask Malfoy. He looked to see if he was still there, he was. Harry walks over to him, "so, when and where should we do this project?" Malfoy just shrugged and pushed his glasses further up his nose.
The bell rang, shit, he didn't hear a word about what the project was about, he was too busy staring at Malfoy. He was turning around to ask Ron, "hey did you hear what the project was abo-," but he was already out the door. To go see Theo no doubt. Whatever.
"Harry, hurry up!" Draco yells to his boyfriend, becoming impatient. He's been standing by the door, waiting with the weaved basket, for almost 10 minutes.
He was his partner. He knew he should be excited but he was, honestly, he was ecstatic, he never get to just be around him. Ron and his fucking hatred for one another, it's fucking stupid.
Once you are born your nails are painted the color of your soulmates eyes. Once the two soulmates touch their nails turn clear. If a soulmate had died the one still alive's nails turn black with a white X printed on the nails of their thumbs.
He gasps as his door swings open and he's thrown on the bed. He's quickly turned over, ass in the air.
Once Harry walks in, he notices that the teacher isn't there yet and that Hermione is in a seat in the front row. "Hey, Mione, why're you here? This is PREcalc."
When they walked in they saw that Snape was already there and so was Malfoy. Ron just groans at the sight of Malfoy and Hermione elbows him in the ribs, tired of his unnecessary freud between them.
When they were getting ready to leave, it was around 2:00pm. They packed up all of their belongings and started heading back to the car. On the way back they were just holding hands while laughing, stealing little kisses here and there.
"Are you sure about this?" Harry asked me, holding my face with one hand while his forehead was against mine.
They've never understood "why" I was gay, why I love who I love, it was a weird concept to them. Never wanting to even try to understand, just keeping their opinions without real reasons behind it.
"Ready to go?" Blaise asked as he came towards him, not looking up from what he was holding, a look of fondness clear on his face.
"And to every single person here that doubts me, telling me that they could live without me, cause they will never understand my weird mind, my weird mind."
I was frozen for a second before I realized what was happening and started to kiss back. He tapped my thigh, so I jumped up, guessing he wanted my legs around his waist.
"And you took a part of me, left me with the memories oh, we were never a family, now you're standing in front of my door, like none of this happened at all."
"I know, love but you need to bring it down a notch, at least until we get there." Draco just nods and sits still.
Sirius silently tip-toed into the nursery cautious of waking Remus. He walks over to the baby's bed and pick him up.
Why? Why does he suddenly want to meet now? He knows what he wants but he thought that, by now, he would have found someone else.
"I don't even know, but she's really annoying and nosy." They just nodded and left it at that. After lunch they headed back to chemistry to finish the syllabus.
Draco yelps from the sudden pleasure and slight pain. His moans only escalated from there, getting louder as Harry fastened his pace.
"Just trying to see what you see in him, and I do admit, he's got a rather fine arse," he punctuated the sentence by grabbing the blondes ass, in turn said blonde yelped and tried to push Nott's hand away.
That class was also just introductions and going over the syllabus. After class they both started heading out when Harry wasn't looking where he was going because he was walking backwards, talking to Ron, and running into someone.
"Wanted to taste," Harry replied like it was normal. Draco just scoffed but let it go. They ate the remaining strawberries while just admiring the scenery.
"Harry, I've liked you since first year, I'd love to go out with you. Hell, I'd even just be your boyfriend right now, Merlin knows we've known each other long enough, " Draco smiled even bigger making me grin back, his words finally hit me and they make me beam with joy.
Harry hurriedly gets into the bathroom, shuts and locks the door. Once he's in the building up tears start to fall rapidly.
Harry laughs at him but only out of pure adoration for the man. Draco pushes Harry out of the house door after he grabbed the keys and they left so they could get the new curtains because purple just wasn't for him
"No, something about being jinxed blah blah blah, now back to Malfoy," he stared at Harry, waiting for an explanation.
"Yes he can, because I will. Hey, baby," Blaise said, coming out of nowhere and kissing Ron's temple. Ron smirked.
"H-hey, Mal- Draco," I still haven't gotten over the fact that we're friends now so I mix up his name a lot. "Oh hi, Harry, are you feeling ok? You look really pale and flushed." Draco says, putting his hand up to my forehead which only makes me blush harder.
"UGHHH," came a sudden noise. Harry turns around to watch as a distressed Ron flops backwards onto the arm of the couch.
"I'm sorry, I was inconsiderate of your opinion. If you want we can go back to the store and exchange it. What color did you want, babe?" He ask calmly, trying to please his love.
Once I was dressed, we were on our way to breakfast. We turned the corner and bumped into Malfoy and his friends, Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini.
Once they were in they noticed Draco sitting in the back, head down, basically invisible. Harry and Ron sat in the back as well but a few seats away.
Harry was sitting up, looking down at Draco who was laying down with his head in Harrys lap. They were just talking about random little things, learning some little stories they didn't know about each other, which isn't much considering that they've been together for six years.
The bell rang, signaling the end of the day. Harry met up with Ron and Hermione. "Do you guys wanna come over and just hang out today?" Hermione shook her head.
"Probably this weekend, when you both don't have school." Harry nods, taking his plate out of the microwave. Lily walks out the door, Harry hears the car start, then drive away.
He got out of the elevator and walked down the hallway until he found the right door. He nervously knocked on it.
Harry laughs softly, "Honestly it's been 3 years since Hogwarts and you're still very much obsessed with your house colors." Draco punches his arm, but not enough to hurt him.
"I was hungry 'Mione, I hadn't eaten since lunch," said a tall,  freckled face, ginger, getting out of the back seat.
"I know, love but you need to bring it down a notch, at least until we get there." Draco just nods and sits still.
"Damn, ok, see you second hour." Ron gives him a sideways smile and head in the opposite direction. The bell rang and Harry saw Ron freeze then start sprinting down the hall. Harry chuckles to himself and walks into his class.
He knew he shouldn't have said that but it was too late and he honestly didn't care, he just wanted some dick.
Once they were on their way back home, they were just listening to music and enjoying the others company. Draco soon fell asleep, tired out from all his excitement.
It was a small little park in the front but as they walked down the trail behind the playground there was a huge flower patch.
Harry yawned, tired because he only got a couple of hours of sleep the night before. There wasn't any specific reason why, just that he couldn't sleep.
Once they had eaten, Harry tried to feed a strawberry to Draco but he was turned away so when he turned back around he got it smooched on his face. They both just laughed and Draco grabbed a napkin from the basket to wipe off the chocolate.
"Really? Let me see!" Draco goes over to where Blaise was standing, wanting to see what he was holding, only for him to turn away.
"It's not faaaiirrr, Pansy. My soulmate has gray nails, I've never seen anyone else with gray eyes. So they could just see my eyes and know, I have to stealthily sneak a glance at peoples nails," Draco groans as he flops down on his bed.
"We just watched a movie marathon in her room, her parents are gone on a business trip this week. We just cuddled and fell asleep." No one made a comment and just nodded.
Malfoy just looked into his eyes and told him that nothing shattered and that maybe he had imagined it. He quietly thanked him for caring enough to "take time out of saving the world and go to a stranger and make sure they were ok"
When I turn around I just stood there shocked. I can feel that my eyes are glossy from the tears that were about to spill out. A box of chocolates are right in front of my face, and not the ones I bought him. They had MY name on them.
"You can be really fucking annoying sometimes, you know that, right?" My eyes widen and I smack my hand over my mouth.
She quickly hugs him, "I missed you so much, Haz." He just laughs and looks at her like she's crazy. "What do you mean, I saw you guys on Friday, it's only been two days." Hermione scoffs and rolls her eyes at him.
The door flew open as Ron walked through, "Why're you guys taking so looooonnngg, I'm hungry," he whined. Hermione rolled her eyes.
He grabs the handcuffs that were located in Draco's bottom draw in his bedside table. He takes Draco's wrist and puts one handcuff on his left hand, slips the other handcuff around one of the bed frames' bars and then puts his right wrist in the handcuff. He's facing away from Harry and towards the bed frame.
"Fucking finally!" I realize Pansy had yelled, laughing so loud everyone in the great hall heads turn. "Right! We've been waiting for this for years," Blaise had said, sounding really annoyed. "I get it ok! Just shut up for a second!" Draco says, seeming embarrassed.
"Sit," Harry commanded. Draco followed the simple order, sitting with his hole right above his dom's mouth.
The interior design of the place was beautiful. Everything in the store was beautiful. There were great crystal chandeliers hanging on the high raised ceiling. There were shelves upon shelves of old rustic looking necklaces, bracelets, rings and earrings. Everything was just so beautiful.
Draco gives him a confused look, "what rock?" He asks, looking down to see if he was standing on a rock or something.
"Why are you not in your robes, Harry? You're going to be late to breakfast. Ron is already dressed and in the common room." Hermione immediately started lecturing me.
"Almost, I need to pay and then I want to get him some candy from honeydukes and maybe some stuff from Weasley' Wizard Wheezes." Draco holds back a groan, wanting to hurry back to his da- Harry, hurry back to Harry, and nods.
That's when I realized I had said that out loud, I started panicking and trying to make it seem like I said something else, but of course, it didn't work.
"Babe-" he was interrupted by yet another kiss as he's trying to get off the couch. "I need to," and another, "go."
Harry smiled down at him, rolling his eyes because he's gonna have to wake him up in 10 minutes to get him out of the car, but Harry just let him be.
"Ah~ Harry~" Draco accidentally moans out, getting too into the tongue that was currently going in and out of him rapidly. The name earning a harsh bite to his left arse cheek, that will definitely be leaving a mark.
Draco let's out a small smile and wrapped his arms around Harry's neck saying, "thank you, and I was thinking more of an emerald green color?" He says more like a question because he IS considerate of Harry's opinions. Well the ones that matter anyway.
Monday came around and Draco was getting really impatient. "She's five minutes late, is she even gonna show?"
Harry pinches the bridge of his nose, closes his eyes, and takes a deep breath, trying to figure out what he did to deserve this amount of his boyfriend's fury.
After about 5 minutes of kissing, they pull away and just stare deeply into each others eyes. "I love you" Harry mouths, not wanting to break the silence.
"I said that even when you're  being an arse you're pretty. I didn't mean to say it out loud of course, obviously, why would I have wanted you to know that I'm in love with y-" but I quickly put my hand over my mouth and ran towards the great hall.
"they're actually really cute together," Hermione said while smiling. Harry sighed and whispered a quiet, "yeah." Hermione looked at him questioningly but decided to push it aside, knowing the cause.
After class, which was just them going over introductions and the syllabus, Harry packed up his stuff and waited for Hermione at the door. "Weird, I'd think Ron would meet us at the door," Harry said, confused.
Harry snapped out of it and hugged the blonde, pulling back only far enough to hold Draco's face in his head, checking for injuries.
Harry made a disgusted face, "didn't need that image, Hermione." Hermione just shrugged her shoulder, not caring.
Hermione scoffed and glared at me, "well, I'm sorry that I just want to be able to get to your classes on time, excuse me for caring."
Of course Sirius and Remus had said yes immediately. Wanting to let them have time together without any interruptions and they just wanted to spend time with Harry.
Draco grumbled saying something about catching a cold but stands up nonetheless. "Fine but only for 5 minutes, then we're going home." Harry smiles widely and shouts "deal!" Draco grins at his child-like personality.
"HARRY, HONEY, YOU'RE GOING TO BE LATE FOR SCHOOL!"'FUCK, why does my mom wake me up at the good part?' He asked himself, groaning. He hears a soft knock on his door. "Hey pup, you feeling ok?"
Ron disecretly taps Harry on the shoulder to make him look at him from behind Hermione's head. He raises his eyebrow at Ron. "Period," Ron mouths to which Harry just raised his eyebrows in realization and nods his head in understanding.
"I know we don't talk, like ever, but I wanted to see.. if maybe.. you'd wanna.... go out.. with me?" He was sweating nervously, maybe he should turn around.
After he showered and got dressed he went to see if Dra-Malfoy was still there. He wasn't, Harry sighed and waited for his mom to come pick him up.
Harry had tackled Nott to the ground and just kept swinging, landing at least 5 solid punches before someone pulled him off.
"I don't know, I've never seen it before, I'll check some things out here." Draco nods and they walk into the store.
I was really wanting to never see my parents, well my father really, ever again, I never wanted to talk to him. I was completely fine with pretending like they didn't exist, they were gone, and I was ok with that.
I look at his face and he has the biggest smile that I think he's trying to make into a smirk but failing miserably. I look at his friend's faces to see if I could find any form of a lie or joke. I found nothing but pure excitement.
"Blaise, you need to calm down, this boy is so in love with you, you could get him a dirty sock and he'd think it was the best gift he's ever gotten. You know this."
"So, now that I know how you feel. Harry?" Harry had an idea about what he was going to ask, and he was about to explode in happiness but he had to wait.
"And why do you need to?" Harry asked, putting more emphasis on the word, 'need,' pulling him into another kiss.
Draco just scoffed and turned to walk out of the bedroom and into the kitchen, pulling out some Firewhiskey. Harry had followed him into their kitchen to continue questioning what he had done wrong.
Ron was just confused, as always, but brushed it off. "Whatever, let's just go." Harry just shrugged and nodded.
"After school, I guess, and would your house work?" Malfoy asked quietly, quickly packing up his things.
Draco hummed nonchalantly as he summoned the potions and candles from the shelf right behind him. “You’re lucky you came now. I’m almost out of Calming Draughts.”
He eventually settled on the jam. There were several different flavors, all of which looked amazing.
Before Draco could react, Harry had flipped him over and positioned him so that his arse was in the air.
"No! You need to pick a specific time and location and decide on which season you're going to watch and..." Draco rambles until he realizes that he's come off as the obsessed fangirl type.
When his cock finally spurted the last of the come, he moaned weakly as Harry kept on stroking him and shoving his tongue into him without letting up.
The orchestra started to play a slow tune. Draco laughed as he realized that it was the song he and Harry had first danced to with each other, long ago.
“It’s alright, really. And you can call me Harry. Draco, right?” Draco looked up at Harry, who was smiling softly at him.
Draco spun around and almost fainted. There was a terrifying creature behind him. It was unnaturally tall, and it had claws and horns on its head and cow hooves. The worst part was that it still looked human, albeit in a demonic way.
“Dr. Granger, you used to work with Draco Malfoy, before he disappeared with Harry Potter. Did you notice any strange behaviors from him?”
“Father!” He yelled, running out the front door. To his dismay, he only saw the family horse, Aries, bucking wildly.
Harry sighed as he looked in the mirror. Ever since that blasted witch had cursed him, he had been stuck in this horrible body for Godric knew how long.
Draco gulped and dug the heels of his palms into his eyes until bright bursts of psychedelic, dizzying colors filled his vision. He needed to calm down. Calm.
Draco tuned her out as she continued to lecture him, instead looking around at all the people staring at the two of them. They ignored him and the Granger lady, which made him wonder if-
After a few minutes of tense deliberation, he decided to wear one of his newer himations. It was the color of a frothy river in the midday sun and had small tufts of fluffy clouds sewn into it. It was also spun with a bit of silver, which would give it an extra gleam when he stood in a light. It wasn’t perfect, but it would have to do.
The next day, Kreacher served a muscle relaxant with breakfast. Harry and Draco downed it instantly, sighing when their strained limbs started to relax. Since it was the third Sunday of the month, Harry put Teddy into another bath and then prepared him for lunch with the family. As always, the boy was excited to meet the Weasleys and especially Victoire, Bill and Fleur's daughter. The girl was a mirror image of her mother, with her hair being the only exception. No matter the light, it always looked like the red rays of a dying sun on a summer's day, vibrant and with a life of its own. Teddy had fallen for her the moment they had met, and it was agreed upon that they would marry when they were grown up; at least between the kids. As always, the boy had brought a gift for Victoire as well. The clear crystal looked incredibly delicate on its silver chain, and Teddy twisted it between his fingers anxiously, since, "Are you sure she will like it? What if she doesn't like the colour? What if she thinks it's too small. What if …?"
Looking at the tall redhead, who clutched her so tightly, it had to be painful, Draco concluded, "Only destroying it, made you understand what Hermione and Harry truly are to each other."
Pulling the attire back in place, after Harry had waved his wand over it, the blond studied their reflections for a moment. Then he opened the first two buttons of his robe and the first one of the dress-shirt underneath.
"Yea," the young wizard had confirmed conversationally. "In the old days, being a parselmouth was considered a gift. Mostly because parselmagic is exceptionally good with healing- and warding-spells. But as far as I understand, it was kept a secret by the Black Family so they could keep an advantage over other families who had no according abilities."
Sitting down beside his friend and partner, the other Auror knew better than to suggest for them to hand over the case. This had long since become far too personal to not see it though. "What about we crack this case, throw some wizard into a deep, dark cell where the sun never shines, and then you apologise to your pet potioneer?"
"Fine," he gave in, "Today, just before seven, Draco came to my door, requesting my help because he had learned that his father was about to be sentenced to the Dementor's Kiss."
"Being up and about is actually good for him," he heard the witch's voice from the side and one of his desk-chairs sliding over the terrace. "As is the fresh air." Emilia entered his line of sight, gazing down. "From what I remember, Fridays spent with your friends, usually last longer than five p.m. And you have never brought a guest before." With a sigh, she waved her wand over his body. "From everything I have heard, I would consider Mr Longbottom trustworthy. If Mr Snape disagrees, he would have done something about it already. However, since they are staring at each other over tea and biscuits, I will take my leave now. " Putting away her wand, she added, almost as an afterthought, "I would free you, but I guess that would cut your partner's punishment short, and I don't want to interfere. Have a good weekend, Harry."
Looking after his two best friends, the redhead nodded, "I'll see that we have him back here before that. But we might need a sobriety potion."
"Mr Potter," Snape snarled from the kitchen before he had the chance to take in the scene. Approaching them, he hesitated.
"We were never malicious," his father protested weakly, having gotten very pale during his son's tale.
The next morning, the Daily Prophet headlined: >Slytherin House: We Protect Our Own< with the subtitle, >Hogwarts, United We Stand<. There was a lot of pathos and praising, big elaborate words that boiled down to the Ministry's Auror Department having been severely outnumbered, so those who had fought in the last war had rallied once again, to eliminate the Children of Hecate and their muggle-sacrificing ways. All in all quite glorious and unexpectedly positive, so the Minister gave his entire Auror Department a bonus and commendations for those witches and wizards who had joined unexpectedly.
"I see you chose to come yourself. Eager to help us along?" The raven-haired inquired with a raised eyebrow.
Andromeda seemed to fight with herself before suggesting, "Have you thought about helping Cissy? I know it's not something you would choose for yourself. Her chances of success are rather low. But helping squibs is a good cause and indeed a challenge."
With a sigh, Narcissa prompted her son. “Be a dear and fetch him, Draco, so we can start breakfast.”
He could not see it. At night, his sleep was disturbed by nightmares. Of Voldemort killing him. Him seeing Death Eaters torturing innocent muggleborns. Being forced to watch Charity Burbage being murdered before his very eyes. But those were not even the most agonising memories that plagued him.
"I said 'No', Mother. Look, I love you, and I would do anything for you. But that was not my decision to make. It was Harry's. And in hindsight, it was a smart one. So, if you can't just be happy to have Severus back, take it up with your husband's liege."
"Of course, she does. Don't let her demeanour fool you, Harry. All purebloods cherish children above all else. Even if they rarely act like it in public. No matter the circumstances of Draco and Astoria's children's conception, they will be loved. Never doubt that."
At Harry's confirming nod, Griphook opened the last Potter vault. "I'll be upstairs. Trigger the wards when you're ready."
Scrutinising her former friend, Daphne folded her arms. "You have become very loyal, very fast, Draco. Have you already joined the 'Chosen one's' fan club?"
Four, nearly five weeks had gone by since the ritual. Weeks, where Harry and Draco had made every effort of not talking about what had happened. Weeks, where the boys had finally given in, accepting that there would be no recuperating rest for either of them, as long as they slept in different rooms. Weeks where they worked at the Ministry or on a potion, followed by nights where they inevitably ended up wrapped around each other come morning. Weeks, where nothing had been discussed as not to endanger the status quo where Harry and Draco slowly, finally started to feel happy. Harry felt like the worst bastard, not only wanting, but actually taking what was not his.
"An O in Defence against the Dark Arts and Transfiguration. An E in Herbology and Charms, but only because Neville and Hermione tutored me."
Bill took great care with uncovering Harry's torso, since every brush of his fingers seemed to send waves of agony through the young wizard's system. "Knife, please."
'Debatable,' Harry thought, while Astoria continued, "I take a herbal remedy, containing Belladonna and various other soothers. They … ahm … help me when I'm clumsy."
Hesitating for a second, Merlin's descendant lowered his weapon, then indicating a bow, "Christopher Pendragon, librarian of the …"
"No shouting, Teddy," Andromeda admonished reflexively, entering their living-room. "Now go and play in your room."
When the witch tried to protest, the blond put a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Come on. You know that you can trust him. Otherwise, you would never have come."
Uncaring if he was followed, the goblin sneered, "Since Master Snape was considered dead, he does not have an account manager."
Nodding, the raven-haired gestured his best friend to follow. At the door, however, he hesitated, "Why Boleyn, Nev?"
Awed the young metamorphmagus' hair turned a snowy white when he reached out to let the little fox sniff his fingers. Only when the trembling eased, did he cautiously touch the head of the shy animal. To Harry's relief, the boy was overly cautious as he whispered, "He looks hungry."
Trading a glance with his godfather, Draco suggested, "There are potions that can help a witch to get pregnant. Troubles conceiving are not uncommon with purebloods."
"You can't send me away!" The pureblood growled, fighting against Harry's hand on his arm. "I am his godson. I have a right to know what is happening!"
Harry then started the physical exercises they had neglected yesterday - because no matter how devoted Emilia was to her patients, she had informed Harry beforehand that she would not be around on Christmas Eve. She had even suggested a replacement for the night who had taken the job gladly, considering the money the young Lord Potter-Black had offered. Draco made a conscious effort not to be too soft or cautious when helping with the exercises since his godfather would hate that. The blond also reminded himself, that he was not jealous of an unconscious man, because he had received such a thoughtful gift when he had gotten nothing. He was not
Three-quarters of an hour later found him sitting in the kitchen, staring into his third cup of coffee. Somehow, the caffeinated drink did nothing to invigorate him. Could coffee expire … or lose its potency? When Harry heard the front door, he scrambled out of his seat to intercept Emilia, before the medi-witch could even approach the stairs.
Trading a helpless look with his wife, Ron soldiered on, when Hermione repeated her daughter's question with pretended innocence, "Yes, why, daddy?"
After a while, Harry groaned and tousled his hair. Shivering, he looked around. Where was this blasted draft coming from? He had checked the doors and all windows several times this last week, but they were airtight, well, as airtight as one could expect from windows. Worried that Snape was suffering from the cold breeze, Harry reached out to pull up his quilt but aborted the motion half-way through. He had no right to enter the professor's personal space like that. Had not had it in the first place, no matter the liberties he had taken these last four years. Sighing, the raven-haired pondered, "Maybe we're simply not the people you want to talk to …"
Harry but rolled his eyes at the thinly conveyed insult, apparently not bothered by the rudeness his elf displayed. Not even when Kreacher asked, "Where would Mistress like to take her tea?"
"Bad enough. Fortunately, you have a sensible partner, who at least tries to keep you out of trouble."
Putting the correct salve on the table, the young Auror stepped back and pointedly turned around. Both he and Draco tensed when they heard Astoria whimper. They wanted to help her but knew an offer would just make her uncomfortable.
Rolling his eyes, the brunet Auror revealed, "My grandmother takes tea with every important person in our world at least once a month."
Studying his best friend, Harry acquiesced, "See you later. Auror Goldsmith." With a polite nod towards his colleague, he left.
After a few minutes, where they had lain in silence, the witch whispered, "I know Harry will come for us, but …" Brushing over her pregnant belly, she admitted. "I am still terrified. What if something happens to Hugo and nobody is there to protect him?"
Chuckling, the raven-haired looked down. "Not very suitable in the long run. But what about …" Pondering, he searched for inspiration, before smiling at the bundle in his hands. Carefully he brushed a tuft of white hair out of her face, deciding, "I will call her Emerald. Because she is just tiny and precious and beautiful." When the baby gurgled, he kissed her forehead and whispered, "Hello, Emerald, welcome to the family."
He could have had that kind of support, if not for Peter Pettigrew. It was impossible to imagine. Hoarsely, Harry inquired, "What did Peter and Remus do?"
Once the pureblood had returned to the Manor, the raven-haired rubbed the bridge of his nose, repeating to himself, like a mantra, "He's trying. He's trying. He's trying."
When Draco entered the dining room, he found it cold and empty. After a little exploration, he spotted Potter in the kitchen, staring bleary-eyed into a cup of coffee.
"How is it cheating if fidelity is not contractually stipulated? Usually, only the bloodline of the child is agreed upon."
"I … what?" The raven-haired stammered, scrambling after his taller friend, fighting with the massive quill as to not drag it over the floor. "Ron, what do you mean by 'oblivious'? What am I missing?"
Once Lucius had departed, a slightly bored voice stated from the doorway, "You look dead on your feet. You did not argue with Jenkins all afternoon. The guy is a jerk, but I doubt he's a match for stubborn old you. What's really going on?"
"Did you, at any point during your last conversation with Astoria Rosier, offer advice on how she could kill her husband?"
Half worried and half expectant, the child wanted to know. "Are you going to fight?" Somehow, that prospect seemed to excite him, since he slipped off the table and left the kitchen, when Draco replied, "Possibly."
"Hm …" Draco replied non-committedly before going for the kill. "I need a sample of the venom you want me to counter."
That brightened her face even further. "That's nice. I hope he feels better after sleeping for so long."
"No, Neville. He said that he was not going to attend ministry functions with someone who did not even know the mottos of the sacred twenty-eight."
Knowing Potter to be in good hands, Draco shoved away the knowledge that Ginny would have her hands all over his naked body in a minute and gestured for Ron and Hermione to follow him. Once the door had fallen shut, the blond nodded down the corridor. "He wants to know what happened."
Instantly reaching out, Neville helped to half drag - half carry - the unconscious man to their sofa.
Barely a minute later, George stepped out of the Ministry floo, Ron and Harry hot on his heels. It merely took a few seconds for the golden trio to converse under their breaths. Then the young men vanished again. George, however, stayed behind, scrutinising the kneeling Lucius Malfoy before turning towards her, "You ottered? Pray tell me, favourite sister-in-law, how may I be of service?"
"He is," she confirmed, choosing a place, facing him. "Don't think that I have not gone over every combat spell, curse and jinx I have ever been taught, for the last few hours. I know, I can be an asset, my parents raised me a Black after all. But neither you nor I can do this alone. We have to trust Harry."
At Kingsley's hesitant, but ultimately decisive nod, Bill explained, "We need to reinstate the balance between the magic in the building, Harry and ourselves." Opening the young wizard's robe, he could not help but smile, when he noticed the young man wearing the protective armour, they had gifted him for Christmas. Maybe not all was lost and the young Auror could still learn to take better care of himself in the field. Pushing these thoughts aside, Bill opened the dragon-leather vest and the shirt underneath. "Put him down, Ron." Once stretched out on the floor, the curse-breaker gestured at their 'victim'. "A drop of blood from each of us and one from Harry. We draw the deflection rune with it and then we all touch him, each other and the floor."
It was nearly 3 a.m. when Harry staggered out of the flames of Grimmauld Place. Though he knew he would feel like a zombie in a few hours, he still faceplanted on the couch, only remembering half-heartedly to set the alarm for seven. He was ready to weep with joy when Draco offered a vial of pepper-up with his second coffee. "You have no clue how very much I appreciate you brewing for me, Malfoy," he yawned.
"Kreacher will have everything ready to be transported by owl. Magic transport could harm some of the potions."
Smiling, not at all uncomfortable as every snake in the vicinity turned their heads to look at him, Harry promised,
Taking everything in, closing his eyes against the overflowing emotions, the last descendant of the Potter and now Black family swayed unsteadily on his feet, until Narcissa confirmed quietly, "Yes, Harry, it worked." Then he broke down.
When Harry dared to look up, he found Fred Weasley crouched down before him. He had to fight down the pain that welled up in his heart upon seeing the other wizard who had risked life and limb to save him after his first year at Hogwarts. "Fred, I'm so …"
Piping up from his seat, their team-leader continued her line of thought. "So, if we put trackers on all the books, …"
"Eggs in a basket," Hermione injected, and Harry laughed, "Of course, I did. I'm just not sure if there will be any left. It's nearly nine in the morning after all."
Deciding he was done with that. He had packed his bag, had hired a live-in-nurse and had entered Gringotts the next morning. One of Hermione’s charmed bags over his shoulder and his purse full off money, he had gone to Kings Cross and left the country the same day.
"As I have already shared, my financial situation is quite stable. But I do not plan on imposing on my sister indefinitely. I need a place to stay, a new home, where …"
All too aware of Draco's faint trembling, Harry shook his head. "No, the Winter Solstice is a time for celebrating with the family, and you are now family by proxy. Molly insisted I bring you along."
Having asked her to accompany him, using her familiarity with these people to introduce himself, Harry had no problems to subtly direct the topic of conversation towards their children's education and inquire about their views on day-care establishments.
Never one to hide from her mistakes, Narcissa stepped forward, but when she opened her mouth, no sound came out. Meanwhile, Severus put his wand away and confronted the Minister, "That spell was of my making."
Pulling away, his festive mood vanishing, Draco was kept from returning to the kitchen, by his mother's delicate hand on his chest. Quietly she advised, "Watch, my love, and listen."
Rolling his eyes, trying to rescue the sleeves of his robes from sharp teeth, Kingsley rolled his eyes. "Believe it or not, I can see that. That still does not answer the question as to why she is trying to eat me."
"Bonne Yule, 'Arry." Fleur kissed his cheek. Both chuckled when Bill pulled first Harry and then Draco into a hug. "The famous Auror and his love interest. Merry Christmas. Good to see you back at full strength."
Sadly, Neville nodded, "Ritual magic can be incredibly powerful and ritual magic fuelled by blood even more so."
Clawing at his godfather's shirt, the child started sobbing. Fat tears soaked through the fabric. Lifting the boy, sinking on the bench, the raven-haired rubbed his back, whispering assurances into his ear, of how much his godson meant to him. Even Draco joined them, patting Teddy's back helplessly while trading a desperate look with Harry. He seemed to ache equally at the little guy's suffering.
"Draco," at his mother's unspoken request, the young man reached for her hand. "Do not think that we did not care for Severus. He was a good friend to our family, and despite his precarious position, he always did his best to care for you. Never doubt his love, because everybody could see him falling for you, the moment your father placed you into his arms."
” He chanted desperately until strong fingers wrapped around his wrists and the voice of his master commanded, “Lucius,
"Don't you get it, Potter?" The other wizard snapped. "We could have woken him the day after Halloween! When you brought all of his stuff."
The ghost of a smile travelled over the woman’s face, before nodding. “Yes, I may know something that will help. I’ll just have to see if we still have some Arnica Montana growing in our garden.”
Laughing exuberated, showering his wife with kisses, Ron still had the presence of mind to shove Harry, until they all lay tangled in the snow. It was the best Halloween any of them had had in a long time.
After grabbing one particular item from his room, Harry sank back into his, no, Snape's armchair. "Maybe, …" he started, taking a deep breath. "Maybe we have gone about this all wrong. Maybe, you simply cannot believe us, when we tell you that you have a chance. That this is all your choice. But maybe … maybe there is someone who can convince you. Someone you would actually believe." Closing his eyes, Harry prayed, "God, please don't let this be a mistake." Then he turned the Resurrection Stone three times in his hand.
"I would like a pot of peppermint tea, if possible. I feel a little bloated. Oh, and a shower would be nice."
Instantly shedding his pullover, the blond put on the jumper and turned towards Harry. "How do I …," then he froze.
"Half of them seem to be magical texts and the other half muggle. Several dealt with biology and others with core development. One details the history of squibs, and one discusses the Salem witch trials. A herbology book was stolen as well, and the last tome discusses ley lines." Harry shared on his way through the Atrium, while he and Lucius were about to return to Grimmauld Place.
"Kinky," George mumbled, "Should I have brought my own handcuffs, or do you think he will supply his?"
Approaching the overgrown wall, the muggle-raised gently touched the leaves and blossoms. "This is an altar?"
Situations like these had occurred in the past. Draco's dreams becoming so vivid, spilling over into this semi-awakened state. Sometimes, the raven-haired had learned; it was better to ride out the waves of the bad memories. Sometimes, it was better to wake him. But what was the best course of action tonight? The decision was taken out of his hands, when Draco opened his eyes again, noticing a smudge on his eyeliner and forcefully, started rubbing off the offending colour. Softly, Harry reached for the other's hand, promising quietly, "We'll make sure everything is perfect. Let me help. Come on."
“Two things, and I would sincerely suggest you keep them in mind, otherwise unpleasant confrontations, such as this, might happen with uncomfortable regularity. First, this is my office where I keep not only my private but also all of my work-related paperwork. I expect from you to never, ever again, enter without my permission. Is that understood?”
Mulish, the other Auror snapped. "Narcissa Malfoy was a known supporter of You-Know-Who. People would celebrate! The Malfoys are the worst of the lot because they could simply bribe their way out of prosecution in the past!"
Harry and Draco traded a helpless shrug before they let themselves fall onto the sofa. The blond ordered with closed eyes, "Two cubes of sugar and a splash of milk, please," when Harry picked up the pot.
Chuckling, Neville shook his head, offering a fresh cup of tea. "That's not how it works, Harry. We don't pray for our gods to ride down from the sky and rid us of our problems."
Bursting into the conference room the Auror Department had given their task force to work from, Harry asked out of breath, "What … what books are … missing?"
Closing his journal, as well as Severus', Draco replied haughtily. "I think I can do better than a ten-year-old Weasley-recipe."
"But," gesturing half-heartedly at the potion's equipment, he pointed out, "what's the point of all of this, if not to help him?"
Transforming one of the side-tables into an armchair, Harry sank into it and looked up. "You remember the extenuating circumstances I have mentioned earlier?"
Working some product into Harry's hair before taming it with a spell, the brunet raised his eyebrows at that question. "From the impression you have just gotten, do you really think that she cares?"
Now it was Harry's breathless, "How?" That was predominated by the Potion Master's demand, "I want to see your notes!"
Reaching out, nearly over his son's messy hair, James admitted sheepishly, "Maybe a little. But it's true, nevertheless. And while we are grateful that you have given us this chance, it is time to end it."
Emilia brought them up to speed during breakfast, about what to expect from a former coma-patient. It seemed that their problems were all but beginning, with Snape opening his eyes. For now, he needed to be brought up to speed on what he had missed. Yet, at the same time, the medi-witch cautioned them against overwhelming him. Small and most of all selective doses of reality were to be laid out in front of him. Nothing too exciting. Nothing that would elicit too strong of a reaction.
"No?" Harry gazed at his vassal, his face a picture of innocence. "Well, in that case, you better keep up!" Tossing the platinum-haired the Nimbus 2000, he summoned again, "Accio Firebolt!"
"Honestly," the redhead shook her head exasperated. "The audacity of this man, when our Harry lies here, unconscious."
"Lily …?" He didn't understand. That had been her ghost … a spectre, not really there. It had happened more than two decades after this picture had been painted.
Alright, I'm finished with my Shadowhunter story. Now I have to type it and edit it and find a betareader and edit it again and all the tedious things one needs to do for a story to get it presentable. But, fear not, I still have a few more chapters ready to role for you, my cherished readers. Even some written in advance.
Dragging his fingers through his unruly hair, Harry chuckled. “What I mean to say was that Lucius Malfoy did right today, so I believe there is a chance for redemption. At least if he keeps making decisions that help people, rather than condemning them. If he were your friend, you could be proud of him.”
The dish turned out excellent, and a part of Draco wanted to go upstairs and discover if it met Severus' approval. But that would defeat the purpose of keeping his godfather hidden, for now. Maybe he could pretend he had some leftover potion brewing? No, the youngest Potion Master in Britain had taught him better than that. His mother would instantly get suspicious if he offered such a weak excuse. Also, it was actually a pleasure to watch his potion at work. Once the wine was consumed, Harry picked up some strange muggle camera and requested, "Smile for me, Lucius."
With an honest smile, Harry replied, "You are welcome, but it was you who made it possible in the first place. Had you not chosen to swallow your pride and ask for my help, your father would be dead. So, in the end, you could say that you saved yourself."
Deciding that he did neither have the time nor the patience to deal with this blasted elf, the wizard turned to leave. To Kreacher's mumbled, "Me is punishing myself now for not providing a proper breakfast," Snape called out, "Most certainly not!" On an afterthought, he added, "And no accidental banging your head against the oven!"
"Really," the painted wizard had asked; seriously impressed. "Your family seems to be quite well off these days."
For a minute, there was a standstill where the two wizards merely looked at each other, before Harry slowly lowered his wand and opened the passage, to reveal the unmoving form of one Severus Snape.
"No problem, Lord Potter-Black. Please, come in. Have you had dinner yet?" Astoria guided Harry into the small, yet tasteful living-room of Daphne's apartment.
"Harry, you have to think with your head instead of your heart," Severus sighed. Apparently, Ron Weasley had been right all those weeks ago. His duties of educating that naïve boy would never end. "Draco certainly does."
"Because I trust it more," Draco explained. "Magic can fail you, and I don't want her retreat to crumble down around her. I'm sure I can find some leftover wood at the Manor. A basic shack should not be that difficult to create."
Laughing, despite their dire situation, Hermione touched Lucius' arm. "Concentrate, that's the compulsion. Look at it. Look and think! Who was the friend that gave it to me?"
Severus hovered at the door of Harry's bedroom, just outside of Teddy Lupin's line of sight, who lay curled up in the bed. Cautiously he inquired, "Harry, what is it?"
After a whispered exchange between the older Mdm Pince and the Arthurian Librarian, Pendragon suggested, "Why don't you return with the Lady Malfoy tomorrow at noon and allow me to invite her to lunch?"
Grinning, Harry relaxed back into the chair. "Thank me after you have tasted it. The first time, Andromeda and I came up with the final mixture, it nearly blew out my brain."
There was a long moment of silence before George spoke up. "There were once three brothers, who were travelling on a lonely road at midnight. They came to a dangerous river and cheated Death of their lives by conjuring a bridge. Death was angry but cunning, so he offered them gifts as a reward for having beaten him. The oldest brother demanded a wand, powerful enough to defeat all others. The second brother longed for a girl, taken before her time, so he wanted a stone to bring back the dead. The third brother was the smartest and asked for a cloak to hide him from Death."
Draco was shivering as he slipped between the satin sheets. Nobody had come today, not even Ruby. While he had gotten used to hunger-cramps during his house-arrest, living comfortably at Grimmauld Place had eroded his resistance against them. He wondered if not receiving food was a new 'training method' and if yes, what he was supposed to learn from it.
"Of course, not," Neville replied in all seriousness. "Or have you ever heard of a house-elf who tells anything but the truth?"
"On time, I mean," Harry raced up the stairs and found the former Lady Black ahead of himself already.
"Draco," his companion breathed, wrapping his fingers around the other's wrist, to keep him from hurting himself, pulling him into his chest. At first, the blond fought against the embrace. But then he hugged Harry back with a force that bordered on desperation.
"George," Ron cautioned, reaching for his brother's shoulder. "I know that I'm not Fred. But I'm here whenever you need me. I'm ready to listen."
Snape's first instinct was to confirm that. Yet considering that he still had his work cut out for him with this troublesome boy, he took the time to think the question through before admitting reluctantly, "I did not think it likely of you returning before dinner. And with company. Also, I believed the company to be - most likely - a Weasley. I did not expect Mr Longbottom."
"How did it go at Hogwarts?" Neville inquired an hour later when they met at the cafeteria of the Ministry. As British born and bred, almost all Ministry workers could go on tea and biscuits practically indefinitely.
Two more times, she played this game. Once, he had forgotten the lip-gloss, and the last time he was ten seconds outside of the timeframe. When she finally commented, "Perfect," and caressed his head, Draco was ready to weep from relief, yet did not dare to ruin his make-up. He knew he was not strong enough to go through another 'training' exercise.
He could feel Bill tense as each and every snake in their vicinity came to life. Carpets, tapestries, bannisters, the decoration reared up and observed him.
"And?" The former Lord asked, confused, "Surely breaking your soul into seven parts is enough. He was as close to immortal as one could get."
