“This is a muggle place. You can rent it for events—reunions and parties.” Harry swallowed heavily. “Weddings too.”
And then he disappeared in a whirl of green flames.
(10:49 pm) Ha! Thank you again, stranger from the void. This has been the best wrong number I’ve ever encountered.
.” He said the last with an exasperated eye roll.
Harry stood with a smile and offered his hand. “Sounds perfect.”
Harry blushed down at his book. “Eh, well, the woods aren’t half as interesting as you.”
“No, we should go to Incredible Edibles for breakfast!”
--------
But Draco gave up completely when Harry’s mouth closed over the head of his cock. “Fucking hell,” he gasped, dropping the violin to the bed as the bow clattered to the floor. His hand tangled in Harry’s hair and he made a few tiny thrusts forward. Only seconds later he came, almost sobbing Harry’s name. Still trembling and gasping for air, he dragged Harry up and kissed him as though the world was ending. “Harry, Harry… Merlin, I’m so sorry I stopped playing… Harry… I tried...”
him. She
Harry remembered that signing and the hour they’d spent talking to the little kids waiting for his reading. He’d had fun with colouring pages of his very own characters, and excited children talking about their favourite parts. But Ginny had wandered aimlessly and declared the hour wasted. Although she got along with children well enough, Ginny preferred loud outdoor games to quiet bookshop activities.
Draco froze and looked at Ron, then back at Harry. “O-k-a-y,” he said slowly.
The baby squealed happily and reached for Greg so he offered to sit out the first round. Draco pulled Chester up in front of him and kicked off, circling the garden in one long, lazy loop. Elyon was old enough to ride his own broom, but Theo shadowed him just in case. Potter pulled Roger up with him and almost made Draco’s heart stop when he immediately went into a swooping dive. Roger squealed in delight and urged him on faster.
“What the fuck, you imbecile!” Draco hissed. He beat on Harry’s shaking shoulders—because of course he found Draco’s fright hilarious—with the parchments in his hands. “I almost hexed you!”
“Photos. Both our wedding album and the one of my parents. Those are the only things we can’t replace. You?”
Draco wrapped his hand firmly around the wand as magic coursed through him, bursting out in a
“Oh my sweet, I think we’re going to have a
“Yeah, okay. I think I can work with that.” He titled his face up for another kiss.
for this! Eleven different spa treatments, Draco!
“Don’t.” Draco’s words sliced through Pansy’s tirade. “Don’t even say it. Pansy, we have this one chance to prove we are better than our parents. And it starts here with some compassion for two children who didn’t ask for this.”
“I told you, Ron was watching. He would have caught me if you didn’t.”
Draco adjusted the bag of his new, very
“Draco… did you just… save my life?”
She gave them a sly wink and turned on her heel, leaving the two of them frozen in a pool of embarrassment and shock.
“Hogsmeade?” Draco’s brows drew down. “Like a date?”
“What’re you doing with all that?”
“Well,” Draco laughed, eyeing the pictures with a mix of suspicion and growing curiosity, “this is indeed kinky! To fuck
The hodge podge of squares soon covered the board. Some of the parchments had been charmed different colours. Some were decorated with cartoonish illustrations or doodles.
“I’m not—” Potter looked at the panicked scene, at the children giving him a wide berth and terrified eyes. Draco could have kicked him for his tone of utter disbelief. “I’m not going to take you. I’m a good guy. Aurors keep people safe.”
He took his shirt off and Harry dragged his hands slowly down Draco’s bare back. “Yes, absolutely...“ Harry moaned. “I’ve wanted…” Draco pushed Harry’s shirt up to kiss his belly and up his chest. “Actually this is good timing. I was going to tell you—“ he paused as Draco pulled his shirt off, tangling his glasses in the material. “Wait.” He pulled his glasses out and tossed his shirt to the side.
“Good idea.”
Harry pushed them both to their feet and kissed Draco’s cheek. “Let me splash some water on my face and calm down a bit, then let’s get lunch. I don’t like skipping meals. We can fool around after that.”
“Please tell me you ordered this under a fake name.”
No one expected the chime at the gates. But judging from their faces, the others felt the same sense of foreboding that ran down Draco’s spine. He flew to the gates and surveyed their ‘guests’—two full-fledged Aurors in scarlet and gold, and two Trainees in scarlet and silver.
(12:08 pm) Again? That’s the third day in a row. Don’t you get sick of the same lunch everyday?
“Sorry,” Harry said as he had every time Draco had mentioned it. It sounded less sincere with each rendition, especially since Harry didn’t want to waste holiday play time to replace it. And given the way he’d fucked Draco over the last three days, he really had no room to complain.
“Sure,” I say, lacing our fingers together against his chest, “next time you can be the big spoon.”
“Me too.”
“Survive,” he whispered.
“Now?” Draco asked, setting his wine glass by the sink. That needed washing by hand. “I thought it would be later, when we were in bed.”
“If all goes well, I can be your last and only favourite.”
“So instead of making a normal purchase like a normal person, you stole it from the back room to screw up our inventory count all to hell?”
“No way. You’ve got me to lose a bet to now. I’m going to wring as much as I can out of this chess story.”
“Interesting…” Draco tilted his head and thought about the dozens of animals he knew about. What would suit him best? He had no idea, as he’d never given thought to becoming an animagus. Not recently anyway. “When I was younger I wanted to be a bird of some sort so I could fly. I loved being on a broom and the speed of it all. Not sure I’d like that anymore. Perhaps something clever but… Well I don’t want to say lazy, but something that lets me rest more easily, like a kneazle or crup.”
—asks for masks?”
“I’m going to get a haircut so this doesn’t happen anymore.”
“Okay,” she said quietly. “Okay. Right, of course.” She wiped her eyes. “I’m going to wait here. You think that’s okay?”
“Nothing!” Pansy shrieked. “Stop getting attached to him, Astoria! We can’t take care of a baby!”
Draco shook his head and tried to pay attention to the film, but if his own heart began beating a little faster, Harry’s must be racing and he knew it wouldn’t be long before… And there it was, Harry’s hand on Draco’s soft cock.
“I suppose we take our stances?”
“Yes. Actually, it’s the thing on the list I’m most looking forward to.” Harry plucked a hair from his head and dropped it in his cup. The smoky liquid shimmered and turned gold.
Draco tilted his head one way and the other, pursing his lips. “How do I look?”
(4:45 pm) Text me when you’re out of work?
“So I should delete—”
“No you didn’t!” Draco laughed. “I don’t know how you managed it. I swear we’ve had more sex this month than all of last month put together.”
! Gnocchi and goat cheese and tiny cakes. You love those things! Please be happy!”
(12:10 pm) Close enough, wanker. I will have leftover curry. What have we got today?
“Then Daphne said you’d think it romantic if I had
“No, they really weren’t… Which was a shame. But your mouth and hands are better. Out they go.”
But here it was, welling up in him once again. He sniffed and wiped his eyes. “Willoughby Malfoy, fir and unicorn hair,” he read aloud. “Thank you Willoughby, whoever you are.” Draco laughed and hugged Theo again, then Alex and Jason. Even Greg gave him a hug, despite hating hugs.
He wipes his mouth with the back of his hand and grins, “Thirsty?”
“Ah, Draco, my love, my sweet… my
After he checked his mobile for the tenth time in as many minutes, Claudia finally huffed an exasperated sigh. “I don’t know what he texted you, but I think it’s time you just go on home to your husband and discuss it in person.”
I'll add tags as necessary, but the outline says it's generally going to be pretty mild, good-natured fun!
“No, they’re harassing a citizen in good standing. I’m contacting my solicitor.”
Draco shook his head, trying to clear his fuzzy brain. “What? Orion? Who took him? Where’d they go?”
“Funded from your own vaults?” Ms Coddle interrupted. “How long do you think you can survive such expenses?”
The moment broke when Ginny’s voice sliced through it. “So how did you two meet?”
He flicked through reading names aloud. “Rowle, Rookwood, Wilkes, Snyde, Avery… This is quite a collection of names. Care to explain?”
The accompanying picture, of Harry in the produce aisle at his local grocery, looked so unremarkably mundane, he didn’t even know why they printed it.
Draco rolled his hips. “No time like the present.”
But instead they made their little waves goodnight and looked ahead to day thirty-three.
But he didn’t get to ask because Draco said, “Tomorrow. Oh we’re going to have such fun tomorrow.” With a beaming smile, Draco rushed from the room.
“Thank you.” Potter turned to Draco with a wry smile. “I didn’t want to be one of your charges.”
But he never got the hang of it. He had reminders for the most basic tasks all over his house, because he frequently fell so deep into work and research that he lost track of the time. Ginny grew ever more frustrated with Harry’s absentmindedness, and it was only now that Harry could see the orchid was meant to draw attention to
Harry slipped off his broom to free fall twelve or fifteen metres from the ground.
Rage bubbled in Draco at the
“Damn it, fine! I’ll get us more tomorrow.”
“It’s just a few more hours. I’ll rest when Orion is home.”
“They should be in Ministry approved homes where they can be watched!” Auror Blakely said loudly.
Draco slammed his teacup to the table and tried not to choke on his tea. He coughed roughly to clear his throat and then said as evenly as possible, “Ah, I see,” as if his world hadn’t just gone topsy-turvy.
(6:08 pm) Around 7:30. We’ll be in the back left corner (always are) and really loud.
“Are you done? Because I have things to do and, last I heard, I did not have to report my every movement and action to you.”
And now, after so many life debts and services to one another, this commitment ceremony was probably the only thing that could make them hate Harry more.
Looking up at Daphne, who nodded reassuringly, Daria took Ms Coddle’s hand. “Draco gave me a black bear that he said could be my very own, but sometimes I let Libby play with it.”
His babbling made Harry smile. When his fingers circled the air above Draco’s cock, Draco let out a soft, keening moan and gripped the sheets once again. As expected, his cock jerked in pleasure and Harry had to snatch his hand away to keep from making contact.
“What do you think you’re doing?” Draco asked, turning Annie’s cone so she could catch the drips.
“Fuck
“Draco wait! Please!” Potter called softly. Against his better judgement, Draco halted on the path but didn’t turn around. Silence held between them for long enough that Draco almost started walking again. But then, Potter said, “I’m sorry. For adding another burden on your shoulders. I didn’t mean to and if we could… if we could just be friends. If you could just call me Harry… That would be enough.”
“The uniforms stay,” the Auror said curtly to Ms Coddle.
Harry’s grin was probably more dopey than Draco’s. “But you did imagine us together?”
“—I didn’t get the little parchment with all the spells on it.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Ron is delusional.” He sighed again. “All right. Let’s go back to the common room. I’m sure everyone wants to know the particulars.”
“Bloody fuck,” Draco groaned. “Wasn’t there someone they could go to for help?”
Headmistress McGonagall ushered Theo Nott, grinning again, into the room. “Mr Nott, as requested,” McGonagall said stiffly. Headmistresses likely didn’t go around fetching students and Harry wondered how Narcissa had convinced her. Perhaps McGonagall just didn’t want to wait with Narcissa.
Harry laughed and blinked away the hot burn of joyous tears. “Oh Draco, I want that too. More than anything.” He pulled Draco close and pressed a soft kiss to his beautiful, perfect lips. “Sorry, I—”
At quarter to eight that evening, Harry put on a nice shirt and neatened his hair somewhat. At precisely eight o’clock, he knocked on Draco’s door.
... Fucking hell, Harry felt sick.
Draco scrubbed at his face. “I’ll get him back, I promise. All right? I need another Wide-Eye potion.” The ground seemed to pitch under his feet and he latched onto Pansy to keep himself upright.
Who could he even find that the Ministry would trust? Everyone he knew was in Azkaban or muggle. Why did this whole fucking world have to knock him back over and over again? Where could he find any help at all when he hadn’t found any help thus far?
(12:19 pm) No.
“Draco… I don’t know what to say.” A tiny seed of hope took root inside Harry. Perhaps all was not lost between them.
“I cannot
“Me too,” Draco whispered back. He glanced around, relieved to see no one else nearby. He’d never got in the habit of wearing muggle clothing. And seeing as the joggers and t-shirt he wore doubled as pyjamas sometimes, he felt exposed and ridiculous at the moment.
? What would you save in a fire?”
Harry shared his typical interview lines about his favourite childhood kitten stuffed toy and the stories he made up about her.  He left out the fact that the stuffed animal was a cast-off of Dudley’s that had torn and was missing half its stuffing.
Over the sounds of Potter’s protests, Draco flew back to the house, eager to reassure the children that everything would be all right.
His hands trembled as he opened the box. How ridiculous. Crazy. Absolutely mad. Wasn’t it? Men didn’t go around wearing women’s underwear! Except Malfoy did and Harry needed to figure out why.
Harry squirmed in his seat, “Erm, just two.” He started tearing the label from his beer bottle, wishing he had something more productive to do with his hands. “One meets in person monthly, and one meets weekly online.”
“I loved the emerald green wall with all your silver picture frames. I’d never seen such vivid colour in a sitting room. Grimmauld Place was dour all the time, and Privet Drive was a bland nothingness.”
Harry shrugged and popped a few buttery kernels in his mouth. “Just what I heard. I guess we’ll find out soon enough.”
Harry set his bags next to Draco’s with a sigh. “I guess I’m all right. I think I’m letting stupid things go to my head.”
“It’s an actual hike.”
As he shifted to find a comfortable position, he thought of their perfect, amazing, wonderful,
Unable to wait any longer for his romantic evening, Draco asked Gregory to close up and left work an hour early. What was the point of owning the shop if he couldn’t come and go at eccentric hours?
Not for the first time he wished he could work from home as Harry did. But as he began his tasks for opening the shop, joy and pride swelled in him. He loved his little corner of Diagon Alley and knew he would miss the challenges of each new day. Even the annoying customers and mountains of paperwork.
“Worth a shot.” Draco tucked the violin under his chin and began a lively melody that widened Harry’s smile. Draco had considerable skill after years of lessons, and it made Harry feel special that he got to hear it when no one else did these days.
be over more often.”
Draco gasped. “No they didn’t! Annabelle would never!”
. What are you doing here?” The ginger twin glared at Draco, crossing his arms over his chest.
“I was just gonna wing it.”
“Lady Malfoy,” Harry said with a welcoming smile, despite his churning stomach. He almost wished he hadn’t eaten that sandwich. “I’m glad you came.”
Draco hurried to comply, in complete agreement that pie for breakfast was exactly the right thing.
“I’m guessing it’s stringent, going by the look on his face.”
Daria visited Draco here once. It reminded her so much of her father’s study, that it triggered a panicked, accidental wave of magic that set every single book tumbling to the floor. Rather than waste time reorganising books, Draco piled them haphazardly on the shelves. He’d spent that afternoon baking a special cake with Daria (and Dowdy), so she could remember her first magic with happiness instead of fear.
In the entrance hall, they found Leila and Marrin pacing. “Oh Draco,” Leila said, latching on to Marrin’s hand. “What if this is awful? What if they aren’t—like my parents anymore?”
“Good luck, Draco.” She held the door open for him and patted him on the back as he passed.
“I think I know of someone.” Potter sent his Patronus off once again.
By the time they made it to their bedroom, he was hard and aching, his chest and neck blooming with tiny red bites. Harry very carefully hung up the expensive cloak in the wardrobe, but dropped the rest of his dishevelled clothes in a pile somewhere near the foot of their bed. Draco added his pyjama bottoms, having lost his t-shirt somewhere in the sitting room.
“What the ever-loving fuck is that? Sounds painful. Or like it’ll set the charms off.”
“You’re not,” Draco said, confused at the turn the conversation suddenly took.
to be seductive, but came out entirely too slurred. “Pansy said the list looked like fun so I made her a copy.”
(7:38 pm) I’ve had loads of fun these last few days.
That suited Harry, too. They could talk about children when they’d settled into their marriage.
“See,” Harry said quietly. “That could have been awkward.”
“Oh.” Harry didn’t have an argument for that. That seemed like exactly the sort of bullshit Lucius Malfoy would engage in. He shook his head. “No, I don’t believe it. If courtship would do wonders for their reputation, so would a betrothal. And a marriage.”
“Aww… you’d be like my little pet, and I could take you for walks and you could curl up in my lap.” Harry gave him a soft and hopeful smile.
“Anything you want,” Draco said breathlessly, his wide, luminous eyes focused on Harry’s fingers.
“I haven’t really been flying since… You know, before,” Draco said, and instantly Harry felt contrite.
“I—I think… Oh Merlin, my dearest…” Draco ran his hands over Harry’s chest, tracing the delicate fake ink lines.
“But you—you would if there wasn’t—if you didn’t have so many other things on your plate?” He rubbed Draco’s wrist, then let him go. “Could there be something for us?”
Avoid the subject altogether. Harry stood up. “To Hogsmeade?”
“You’re sex on legs, Harry. Is there someone out there
“I… I… Do you want…”
, but instead what came out was, “Me too.”
A doll. He needed to go into town and find a new doll. Still feeling shaky he stood and took a few more deep breaths. The anxiety subsided somewhat, but the itchy feeling remained. With careful, deliberate movements, he mounted his bike and followed the road into town.
“But it’s a
When the spells dropped, Draco dressed Orion in a clean pair of pyjamas from his changing bag while the mediwitch filled out the paperwork. His poor baby moaned in his sleep.
He almost gave in after dinner, when Draco hinted his room would be empty while Theo was at chess club. But he didn’t want to tempt them into moving faster than they were really ready for. It had only been a day since they got together, he reminded himself for the hundredth time. They had to pace themselves.
Draco’s face darkened. “This wasn’t an accident. What did he take?”
“The sorting hat’s about to sing any minute,” Draco said, nibbling Harry’s ear in the empty Entrance Hall, “but I thought we could take advantage of everyone being at the feast and head to the library...”
“It’s worth calling down your mother’s wrath,” Harry said unapologetically, rubbing his lips. “I can’t
The ragtag group of teens were still in the receiving parlour when Draco came home. Daphne and Astoria he knew.
The girl shook her companions hand. His glazed eyes refused to focus on anything and he wavered, almost falling into her. “He’s hurt his arm. If you could just heal it for us and then we’ll go.”
“Very well.” She took the scroll from Harry and opened it on the desk. “Mr Potter, you’ll sign here. And Draco, you sign here. I’ll cast the binding spell and your courtship will begin.”
“Me too. This is nice.” Draco looked adorable, smiling and curled up on his side with his pillow tucked under his head.
(12:42 pm) Or 48.
Draco’s eyes widened. “Okay that was a lot.” He looked at Ron, then back at Harry. “I’m not sure what to say to you while you look like Ron Weasley.”
“That’s okay. You don’t have to take me back. Or at least you can think on it a bit before deciding. But… I know I miss you and… After thinking on it, what does it matter what sort of pants you wear? Pants are pants, right? You should do what makes you happy.”
Harry, it looked endearing instead.
Potter grabbed hold of the handlebars. “I know. About the paperwork you filed.”
Andromeda inclined her head politely and followed Draco to the next room and the next. When it came time for Andromeda and Teddy to take their leave, she gave Draco a long hug and whispered, “Your mother would be proud of you.”
Harry has a split second to decide what kind of sex he wants to have.
“Don’t! Don’t say my name like that! Fuck!” Harry’s throat closed up with emotions he didn’t think he could hold in check much longer. “It’s over. You’re free. Life debt paid.”
“The tamarack won’t take the charms because it’s too dry.”
,” Ron said, “just in case. It was worth it, because we ended up finding Lisa to do the voice of Cleo Cluck for
Draco gave them what he hoped was an encouraging nod, and then followed Harry out the door to welcome their newest guests.
“Could be some in the attic.”
When they came up for air, Harry panted, “Damn, should I text you our wedding photos more often?”
Draco winked, sending Harry’s heart fluttering, and said, “If you insist.”
“I think one of us should stay sober and alert.” He laid a hand on Harry’s arm before he could drink. “I’m not sure I want to have sex while you’re high on some potion.”
Harry nuzzled their noses together, grinning and playfully nipping at Draco’s mouth, “Of course I did, and now I want to fuck against the bookshelves.”
way your fault?”
“But you just said it wasn’t a real marriage.”
Draco whispered in Harry’s ear, “Do you want to linger? In the Gryffindor changing room this time? I’ve always wondered how they compare to the Slytherin ones.”
“Different how?” Draco asked, taking the brochure. He glanced over the glossy collage of pictures—colourful gardens, a large brick house, a charming gazebo with bird feeders all around, and a bridge with a bride and groom smiling down at a little man-made pond.
the wards. But don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone,” he added with a wink. “I’m good with secrets.” He took another sip of his beer, watching the blush cover Harry’s face. Malfoy laughed and shook his head, “Thanks, Potter, but I don’t need another beer.”
But afternoon faded into evening and their empty stomachs demanded they join the rest of the school for dinner.
What followed was the most bizarre trip down memory lane that Draco had ever taken. Out went the candle that was meant to inspire lust but just smelled like fermenting berries to both of them. And the silly gag gifts they’d gotten each other over the years that served no purpose. As if they needed kinky dice to tell them where to kiss each other and for how long.
Malfoy’s brows drew down. “Are you asking me on a date?”
Harry laughed nervously and said, “Maybe you can get it next week.” He sat back with a red face, thankful for the dim lighting that would hide it. Implying Draco might be joining them regularly seemed presumptuous.
Draco’s eyes widened in expectation as he opened the envelope. Harry knew that despite the protests, Draco never got tired of dragon-themed anything. He pulled out the heavy cardstock with an eager grin.
“Let’s do Draco next!” Daria laughed. Annie clapped her hands and Draco groaned good-naturedly.
Every part of Harry sparkled with wonder at each touch and kiss. Even if Draco’s body was familiar to him, it felt brand new under his fingers and lips. They hardly spoke beyond soft sighs and moans. There were no demands, no directions, no pleas or negotiations.
Maybe I shouldn’t have laughed at the barista’s gentle teasing at my name, or winked when she handed our hot chocolates over, or licked suggestively at the whipped cream on top.
Memories swam to the surface of Alex and Jason in the year below him at school. Leila and Marrin were complete strangers, although he soon learned Marrin was in the same year as Astoria, and Leila a year below that. He’d missed the initial introductions and got the scoop from Theo while Pansy sorted everyone into bathrooms for showers.
“And kiss you goodnight.”
All these weeks, trying to use his friends’ wands… trying to feel the magic that used to rise to the surface so easily… He thought Azkaban had burned it all away.
12:45 Wednesday afternoon.
get to decide. And I want to see Draco Wednesdays and Saturdays. And tonight, since it’s Friday and the week’s almost over.”
Harry’s grin widened. “You love me.” He leaned forward until his lips tingled, hovering above Draco’s cheek. “I could kiss you right now!” He hesitated for a moment then said, “Oh, fuck it,” and planted a smacking kiss on Draco’s cheek.
Leila thought she had a grandmother living in Ireland, but didn’t know her well, or how to find her. Marrin’s older brother could take her in but she hinted that might be more dangerous than living on the streets with Astoria and Daphne.
Harry’s breath left in a whoosh. “Right. Okay. So… a date? Soon?”
“Keep playing,” Harry whispered. “Don’t stop.”
“No, I definitely want to feel you between my thighs.”
“Not… not today, I think,” Harry said, burying his face in Draco’s neck. “I feel too… I think it’s too much.”
“You mean my latest complaint of harassment? Impossible—that letter’s still sitting on my desk.” Draco gave him a tight smile and tried wrenching the bicycle free of Potter’s grip.
But his lips hover an inch away from mine, his knees bracketing my hips. His blue eyes offer a challenge I’m only too eager to meet.
“What if…” Harry leaned back and swallowed heavily. “What if this is the last first kiss we’ll ever have?”
“I wish I could hug you right now.”
“Sorry, mate,” Blaise said, with what appeared to be sincere sympathy.
“Not really.” Harry didn’t elaborate and made to return to his room. He certainly didn't want to have this conversation in front of everyone.
Penny: No one dared you to—
“What are you, four?” Harry gasped as the cold water hit his chest. In reflex, he hit Draco with the same spell.
“No, I gave two to Pansy.”
“Oh well… actually, I’ve been thinking ahead.” Harry went to the study and found the notes he’d made for their next ridiculous plan. His hand paused over a brochure he’d also picked up. Before he could second guess himself too much, he folded the brochure and stuck it in his back pocket. He returned to the sitting room and handed the notes to Draco.
Feeling more confident, Harry let himself imagine a relationship with Malfoy. It had been a long time since Harry had anyone to call his own. Too many were scared away by the weekly Potter Watch column. It was too hard to open himself up to anyone, but with this secret they both shared… Maybe he stood a chance.
Did I take artistic license because the chance was too good to pass up? Absolutely!
could mean
“What?”
“Thank you, Ron, just tell everyone all my business…” Harry blew raspberries at Ron and drained the last of his beer, avoiding the smoulder he knew would be coming from Ginny. With a new perspective on things, it didn’t have the same pull it once did.
“That’s the spirit!” Harry closed the shower curtain. “I’ll get dinner together while you shower.”
Through his grimace, Weasley said, “That’s supposed to be mixed in a cup, you absolute loon.”
“Is it working?”
Magical wands.
“I think the target audience is thirteen year old girls, so I don’t really want to say yes. It’s a little sappy and I don’t know when Annabelle and Charles managed to fit in the sex they must have had—”
“Probably half an hour or so. I’ve never taken it, but I’ve heard it makes you a little light-headed so we should definitely be sitting in a comfortable spot.”
Whether Harry went on with his shower and left everything as it was, or removed the dildo from the wall and stowed it away somewhere, Draco would know that Harry had seen it. He might get embarrassed. Actually, he would
, which their magical children greatly enjoyed), Harry shared a blanket and a bowl of popcorn with Draco.
“Yeah, that might be difficult,” Blaise said with his infuriating grin. “The snitch is caught. I think Narcissa knows about whatever you two got up to last Saturday.”
Draco made a non-committal sound, then turned towards his waiting children.
But Draco remained
“Kiss me,” Harry whispered. Immediately he got a hot swipe of Draco’s tongue that had him melting. If Draco didn’t have an arm wrapped around Harry’s waist, he might have collapsed like a puddle on the floor. “You are really good at that,” Harry said when they came up for air.
Draco ignored whatever Potter might be implying and shook off his unease. If Potter hadn’t set the Aurors on them yet, perhaps he meant what he said. Maybe his influence could get the paperwork filed properly. But just in case, Draco wasn’t going to worry anyone at home about it.
He beat Draco to the Great Hall and immediately began eating as quickly as he could, in case they had enough time to at least sneak in some snogging before their Transfiguration class. Draco laughed at Harry’s already half empty plate as he sat down.
“Harry!” Hermione said shrilly. “I think we can do without the details.”
That gained a smirk from Weasley and Potter that Draco both appreciated and feared. If those two made things difficult for him…
He’d forgotten about another present until it arrived unexpectedly in early May. He handed the large, flat envelope to Draco at breakfast. “Sorry about the dragon theme, but I commissioned it before that conversation.”
He cut off when a soft sob reached his ears. “Harry,” he said softly, finally noticing Harry Potter curled up tight in his armchair, head buried in his arms and trying to smother his tears. Draco hurried to sit in front of him, awkwardly pulling him into a hug. “Harry, I’m so sorry…”
Harry ignored him and sought out Draco. The two desk chairs had been arranged in the centre of the room, facing each other. Draco sat in one, arms crossed and looking sullen. Good, he’d got Harry’s note.
Draco’s head shot up, jolting every painful joint of his body. Hazy vision focused on the figure in front of him. “Potter,” he croaked, his voice still raw from his brief stint in prison.
“Why don’t you all sit wherever you usually sit and I’ll find somewhere to fit.”
Better prepared this time, Ron managed to stay calm when Draco came in. His body registered that same excitement but this time it didn’t lead to anything embarrassing.
“Malfoy.” Potter nodded at the bags. “Having a celebration?”
The whole point of dating a bloke was to see if Harry really liked it as much as he thought he might and that meant kissing said bloke at some point. Might as well be now, with Draco so obviously wanting the same thing. Or at least that was his second brain’s thinking and his first brain had no rebuttal against it.
(7:34 pm) Bwah haha ha!!
“Are you forgetting yours was the only home that welcomed him?”
Draco breathed a sigh of relief as their portkeys landed them in the back gardens. He whistled at Greg, then grinned as he pulled his wand and began spraying everyone in sight with an Aguamenti. Greg caught on fast and also began spraying the crowd, as Daphne and Pansy pulled their wands to retaliate. The children shrieked and ran wild, jumping and rolling through the grass and dragging the wand-wielders down.
“Me too. A real threesome didn’t interest me.”
“I think you’ll be fine in your cardi. If not, we’ve got warming charms. Ready?” Harry held out one end of his scarf to Draco.
Harry laughed at the nickname he’d been given at the start of their odd wrong-number friendship. “They’re with me,” he said to Fergus. As Fergus went to fill their order, Harry said, “He and Seamus—you remember Seamus Finnigan? They own the pub, and give us a little discount on Fridays.”
Smiling, Draco took the apple. “The more the merrier. I’ll get more bread.”
Draco laughed and kissed the corner of Harry’s mouth, relieved his husband only had laughter in his eyes. “As if anyone could ever take your place!”
“Draco Dodo it is,” Harry said, shoving his phone in his pocket and grinning openly at Draco’s scowl. “Yeah, so… tomorrow it’s supposed to rain, but Sunday should be nice. I’m going hiking after lunch. Sketching the great outdoors for a camping trip with Molly. Do you... maybe want to come with me?”
“I hate reading.”
“You’re sure Claudia and Gregory didn’t see you with it?”
“Thursday.”
Maybe it was too soon, but Harry had years of isolation to make up for. It wasn’t his fault he’d been fighting for his life instead of learning the ins and outs of snogging during his teenage years. He had a pretty, willing boy that wanted it more than he did. He could process everything later.
“Stop stalling, you big baby, and do it.” I want to take his free hand, but I’m afraid the gate will recognise
Draco met the large group at the Manor gates. Matilda Coddle handed out introductions of her coworkers, but the blood rushing in Draco’s ears made it difficult to focus. Potter winked at him, which did absolutely nothing to calm his racing heart.
The dressing gown dropped to the floor as Draco crossed to the bed. His chilled body enveloped Harry and they both sighed on contact.
Draco blinked a few times and then said smoothly, as if he’d rehearsed his answer, “We met on a travel forum about sites of interest in Hakata, Japan.”
Harry gave him an apologetic smile. “Yeah, see… it’s actually not up to the
Jason scoffed, “You think the Ministry is just going to let this merry gathering happen? They’re going to bust in here any day now and ruin everything. We’ll be back on the streets in no time.”
A week later, Auror Blakely returned with Potter dogging his heels once again.
“Sorry, I know this is weird timing and I’m in the wrong body but I didn’t know I fancied you until I was in this body, which by the way
likely to put out later. Wouldn’t it be sexier if they were sharing a broom instead? He brightened at that thought.
“No! It’s just… I… Maybe. I don’t know. But if this is how I can have you, then this is what I want.” He winced at his own word choice, and wished he never had to talk about what he
They had one last pep talk, reminding everyone that
(5:54 pm) Thanks for the offer. This shouldn’t be too bad. Just the usual group of us going for drinks. Very casual.
“You move fast,” he said with a smile, shaking her hand. “Won’t you come in?”
“More like what was Hildred Malfoy thinking, as it was my great-grandmother that decorated this room in the first place. My mother was too afraid of offending her mother-in-law to ever change it.”
“Yeah Molly keeps insisting I go home with Ron, but it’ll be quieter and more restful here. The Weasleys can be a lot to take in when they’re all together.” He rubbed his hands on his jeans again. “Yeah so, listen…” Harry cleared his throat. “I was wondering if you wanted to… Maybe you wanted to go to Hogsmeade with me tomorrow.”
He waved to Seamus’s cousin Fergus, co-owner of Incognito, standing behind the bar, and made his way to the usual spot to wait on the usual group to arrive. The advantage to knowing the owners meant a spot reserved for them every week in a pub less crowded than the Leaky Cauldron. The others trickled in over the next twenty minutes, curious about the two seats Harry was holding for two new friends.
Potter and Weasley.
The Elf froze. One eye peeked out from behind his hands and his ears twitched, “A baby?” Large eyes scanned the room with more purpose, finally landing on Orion, gumming a spoon in Astoria’s lap. “Pickles hasn’t had a baby to look after since… since…”
“Draco…” Theo whispered, watching with wide eyes.
Harry hesitated in the middle of removing his jeans. He gave the tentacle a long look.
Hermione’s face flushed adorably as she covered her mouth.
“Third floor, probably. Poisonings and potions mishaps,” Potter said, elbowing his way to the lifts.
She blew raspberries, but Draco pulled out his phone and tapped at the calendar. “That sounds like fun. I’ll text you Sunday morning to get the details.” He gave Harry a half-smile. “I can bring key lime pie.”
“I told Ron and Hermione last night.”
“Just the ones involving your lover’s semen?” Harry couldn’t help but ask. He deserved a medal for keeping a straight face. Behind Draco he saw Blaise and Neville rolling their eyes and laughing. Everyone had
“We had plans with Neville and Hannah!” Ginny protested. From down the table, Hannah waved half-heartedly at the sound of her name before turning back to Hermione.
“Do you trust me?” Harry whispered again.
“Yes.” Blaise’s smug grin was back in place. “And by the way, I’m keeping my bribe, seeing as I did my part.”
Their measured pace became speed walking once they reached the Entrance Hall, and then outright running as they neared their common room. They were both laughing so hard by the time they arrived, they could hardly get the password out.
(12:31 pm) You ok?
But Draco must have seen some sort of shadow passing over his eyes. He smiled kindly. “I loved it, Harry. All of it.” He rolled off the bed and started digging in his trunk. “You know what you need? A good book to read.”
“No it didn’t! We didn’t get buzzed!”
Draco would take it to the grave how the warm glow of copper fixtures and the lush green of plants hanging absolutely everywhere in the Hufflepuff common room soothed and relaxed him. He could live forever in this soft cocoon of blankets and a crackling fire, with Harry still inside him and his head resting on Draco’s shoulder.
Potter’s interfering attention became known when the gates chimed just after lunch two days later. Draco Apparated to the gate, walking the last few feet cautiously, his eyes immediately drawn to Auror Blakely’s glare. On one side of him was a stern witch with frizzy hair and wiry eyeglasses. The young wizard at her side had a clipboard and quill poised to take notes. On Blakely’s other side was Harry Potter, and beyond him, surprisingly, Hermione Granger.
I almost forgot to post this today because my fic for the HP Rare Pairs 2021 fest posted as well today. Check out Draco and Dean here -
(12:15 pm) Hit me up. I can google it for you.
He’d never got to keep Draco for thirty-one days. They wouldn’t be spending this morning packing Draco’s things for a trip back to the Manor. Harry wouldn’t wander the flat trying to make it look like Draco’s things weren’t missing. He wouldn’t spend the night alone and restless.
“What?” Draco blinked at him in confused disbelief.
“He hurt his arm,” she said again.
Draco looked mouthwateringly gorgeous in his charcoal grey morning suit and the diamond cuff links that matched Harry’s. Both of them got a little teary while reading their vows. Harry’s hands shook as they lit the unity candle and promised to join their lives together forever. The candle flared unnaturally bright for a moment and he wondered what sort of charms it carried. He could ask Draco about it later.
Harry handed over the bag. “I’ll set an alarm and leave at quarter to nine, just to be safe. But if he comes back early, will you warn us?”
“Well, my wand is -” he pointed vaguely to the side.
No, this was some time later, at a smaller party. Perhaps New Year’s Eve at Blaise’s? Ah yes, there was Blaise, welcoming them to his rooftop party. A trick of Harry’s imagination enhanced all of Draco’s features— whiter hair, darker lips, luminescent eyes.
“What about you?” Ginny asked, leaning forward and smiling freely. She really did have a nice smile. “What do you do?”
!” Harry growled, wishing he could punch Theo himself.
The next morning, Draco dropped Greg off at the Ministry for his evaluation. “I’ll be back in two hours, all right. Wait right here for me. Don’t go anywhere else.”
“There’s no vicar,” Draco said, his brows drawing down. A light flush crossed his cheeks that made Harry grin.
have custody of any of you, except maybe Orion. Our best bet for the little ones is to turn attention away from here as much as possible.”
Harry leaned close to Draco and whispered, “We all chip in and share pizzas for dinner. I forgot to mention it earlier.”
“Nope. Just a simple spell to overlay the design. It should last a week.”
“I’m taking you to Hogsmeade,” Harry announced to Draco at breakfast.
“Ew, please don’t phrase it like that ever again.” Draco shook his head. “I’m worried about it and I don’t think I can pay attention to him that way right now. But after… Well I’ll still be busy, but at least I’ll be on firm ground for once.”
(10:48 pm) I love that you’ve taken my side without knowing even one single detail about the situation.
Potter’s eyes bugged out but before he could protest the cost, Draco dropped the coins on the counter. He opened the packet and choked down the coffee powder, then shot a small Aguamenti at his mouth to rinse out the grit.
sounds like fun.”
Lightly he carded through thick black locks and whispered, “The students return soon and everything will change.”
“It’s not ready yet! You were supposed to wait a little more!” At Draco’s dismissive sound, Harry continued, “I modified that nightlight that Teddy had, so it would look vaguely underwater in here. Does it?”
The man looked them both up and down and shook his head. “Fuck me sideways, you two are a pair. Come find me if you wanna play.” He winked and in seconds was swallowed up by the crowd.
Although he would never admit it, Draco knew she was right. He’d dreaded returning to his childhood home, when memories of Death Eaters and the Dark Lord overshadowed everything. He’d brought Pansy, Theo, and Greg along, because they faced the same horrible memories in their own homes. It all seemed manageable when faced together.
” at Ron.
Theo pursed his lips mulishly and snatched the contract from Harry. Likely, he didn’t know what it said any better than Harry had when he signed it. But now, Theo had no recourse and had to sit on the other side of Draco.
“It won’t be, but I admire your optimism.”
Pansy giggled into her mug and Draco wondered if she’d snuck a little rum into hers. “You say that as if any of us are getting paid. I’m planning on running off to Mallorca any day now. Harry can have my spot.”
Harry sent a string of heart and kiss emojis, and Draco was tempted to send back an eye roll. But he hated when pictures replaced words and so refused to send any emojis of any sort.
“I swear you were calmer walking into the forest to die.”
It didn’t matter because he wasn’t here to ask. Draco had been thrust into the decision-making role, and he had a whole houseful of people depending on him. How did this happen? How were they going to survive this? Everything seemed more dangerous now that Aurors appeared more and more often. How did he manage to escape Azkaban for being a Death Eater, only to be thrown back in for some form of kidnapping? And harbouring two underage werewolves.
“That’s for lab emergencies,” Harry said, wrestling his muddy boots off.
“We’re not going to go round and round about it now,” Ron said to Harry. “I’m gonna go stare at the wall in my room. We’ll talk about it when Hermione gets here.”
“It was a warning.” Harry sat back to give Draco more breathing room. “Look, you don’t have to answer now, all right? It’s just something for us to consider.”
Auror Blakely tucked the scroll into a pocket of his robes. “That won’t be necessary.” He straightened, locking eyes with Draco. “But we’re keeping an eye on you, Malfoy.”
“We make Wolfsbane—”
Draco shook his head with an eyeroll and hurried away before Potter thought to ask about the muggle clothing Draco wore. At home, the flying gear was welcomed with great enthusiasm and they immediately set up flying lessons and an impromptu Quidditch match for the little kids.
“Will the wards let me in?”
His heart stuttered when Ginny came in alone. Good, Harry thought with a mental sigh, because he already had enough on his plate with meeting Draco for the first time in a million years. He didn’t need to add ‘playing nice with his ex’s new boyfriend’ as well.
Potter quirked an uncertain smile that became genuine when Lizzie took his hand, dragging him off in a sea of boisterous children. Pansy took Draco by the arm with a harsh laugh. “This is going to be brilliant.”
“It’s a Weasley Wheeze from George! And look,” Harry said, waving around a small piece of cardstock, “I got you the limited edition Harry Potter one with a tiny, tiny lightning bolt scar and glasses!”
Harry handed Draco his slice of pie and resumed eating his own piece. “Give me another half hour or so for sketches and photos and we can head back to mine.”
“It’ll be easier for you to avoid looking at it if it’s above us. You can be on your hands and knees so you’re not looking up at it. And if you decide you want a little peek after all…” Harry poked his head into the shower just to wink at Draco. “We can switch it up if you like.”
“You’d still be the little spoon right now.”
David smiled sadly. “I know. So, Pickles… you want to be free? Want to stay here and help us?” He held out a sock he’d pulled from his own foot.
She surveyed the room, the small groups of children talking or setting up board games. “No. Even if these monsters are annoying and dirty and loud and so much fucking work… I’m glad we’re here for them.”
“Ha! As if I’d sign another thing like that ever again,” Harry said, rolling his eyes. “Not if they’re going to deny a betrothal right from the start.”
“You get a taste after dinner, when we serve it to our guests!” Draco said, pouring the batter into the two waiting tins. “And I thought you were meant to be picking up food about now.”
Auror Blakely dressed as a muggle policeman.
“Harry, are you all right?”
Pansy rolled her eyes. “He’s gay as a maypole. He’d love to ‘go hiking’ if that’s a euphemism for something sexy.”
In the Great Hall, Harry sat across from Ron and Hermione, with Draco at his side. He liked feeling the warmth of Draco’s body pressed so close. He hooked his foot around Draco’s ankle and got a soft smile for it.
(3:58 pm) And that’s only because I’m meeting friends tonight and don’t want to make them jealous.
The saleswitch found him a nice mid-range broom for experienced flyers, as well as some training brooms for smaller children. She also helped him size equipment for a variety of ages. As the hour wore on and Draco’s purchases towered higher and higher, her demeanor relaxed considerably. She even threw in a competition grade snitch for free.
He did not know Alex, Jason, Leila, or Marrin.
Harry’s phone buzzed loudly against the table, even in the noise of the pub. He smiled at the text,
(1:46 pm) Figuratively speaking, I’m also game for both.
Wait, what?
“Oh, I’m sorry,” Harry said, not sounding sorry at all. “Didn’t see you there.” He handed Draco a glass and pointed with his own beer bottle to the dance floor. “Probably should hit on someone else. This one’s taken.”
“Fuck,” Draco whispered under his breath as he turned to get the violin and bow sitting behind him. “Right, of course. I can do this.” He sat back on his heels and took a deep breath, then began the tentative strains of something Harry hadn’t heard before. He faltered when Harry pushed his knees farther apart. “Harry…”
picnic by the lake.” Harry couldn’t stop his blush, making Ron laugh out loud. “You’d get detention for sure for trying that by the Black Lake.”
The building looked just the same as it did then. The wizard that owned it leased to both muggles and wizards alike, but still used magic to maintain the building.

“You won’t—you won’t be calling the Ministry?”
“Nah… Don’t need it. But a pillow under my head wouldn’t go amiss.”
t-shirt. He just wanted someone to share his life with. He didn’t fancy Draco. Which was fine, because Draco certainly didn’t fancy Harry either.
“I suppose a spell or two wouldn’t hurt,” Harry said as he bent to nuzzle the soft skin below Draco’s ear.
“That’s bullshit!”
“Merlin, Draco, this - it’s inside me. And before it was inside you.
“What? No, that’s impossible! You said Theo asked about it and you told him nothing happened.”
I have to pretend, in the quiet of our dorm, that he can’t hear the thumping of my heart or the heavy gasps I can’t hold back.
“Yeah…” Harry said slowly, finally catching on.
“Where did you get a wand?” Potter asked, eyeing the length of fir in Draco’s hand. “I didn’t know you’d got a new wand.”
The club they’d gone to back then had closed down but one street over, another club had opened that served well enough. Really, weren’t they all the same? Harry went to buy them overpriced drinks while Draco waited against the wall off the dance floor. He watched the young people dancing and remembered how much he used to love the heat and the noise of it all. But now…
Harry laughed and hoped nothing horrible happened while they manipulated the chastity spells. Slowly he traced the air just above Draco’s chest, watching it rise and fall faster as Draco’s breathing became more uneven with each tingling almost-touch. Draco closed his eyes and moaned softly as Harry circled above each nipple.
“Don’t you have essays and worksheets due?” Draco laughed as Harry suggested heading down to the kitchens for pie and butterbeer.
“We’ll get you cleaned up. Get a meal. And then we’ll see, all right?”
“I - I sterilised it. Auror grade spells, you know.”
Before Harry could respond, an otter patronus bounded through the walls and Hermione’s voice said, “
“What about me?” Draco tilted his chin up. This wasn’t about him at all.
“I figured as much,” she said with a tight smile. “It’s the hair, you know. What can I help you with?” She sat stiffly in the chair, only smiling at the baby cooing and squirming in her lap.
“And Lavender said I probably shouldn’t but it was really good wine and you’re so warm and I want you warm all over me but not in a weird way. Can we fuck right here on the sofa because I don’t think my legs work.”
Malfoy knocked on the door. “Are you all right? Is it a side effect we haven’t documented? Weasley? Can I come in?”
Harry frowned in confusion as he took the book but didn’t say anything because Draco had already picked up the second saying, “This one is much more fun, if you can look past the mentions of fanny.”
“This is so fucking hard,” Draco sobbed, grasping at Potter’s shirt and soaking his shoulder with tears. “All the damn time.”
“I heard a chime at the gates,” Daphne said.
After two weeks of snogging Draco every chance he could, their awkward wave goodnight made Harry roll his eyes as soon as he got to his room. What a stupid situation!
“Let’s get out of here before they charge us another galleon. We’ll get showered and cleaned up at home. Then I say we go out for dinner tonight with our saved ten galleons and then if we’re not too tired, we can fuck peacefully in our own bed.”
Knowing he had no leg to stand on, Theo threw Harry a scowl and stuffed his mouth full of toast.
Whining groans became excited chatter as the older kids speculated where David might sort, and what adventures awaited their makeshift siblings. Elyon chewed his lip nervously, but Greg soon distracted him. Unfortunately that involved straws and spitballs made from napkins. Pansy hissed threats at them, and Greg made Chester giggle by landing one right on the top of her bun when she turned towards Libby.
And damn if Potter’s grin didn’t tug at something deep within Draco.
“Stop! You said we’d unbalance!”
Draco had ventured out into the muggle world primarily to separate himself from the expectations Lucius set for him. He saw no reason why Harry shouldn’t work on his own separations from Ginny. He made Harry see all the good things he enjoyed about his life and all the ways Ginny really didn’t fit in those places. The daily lunchtime texts from Draco that reminded him to eat on time, also gave Harry confidence to resist Ginny’s advances.
If this had been one of his seventeen days, he would have asked Draco to cuddle under the duvet with him. Maybe naked. They’d kiss and laugh and spend the whole day doing nothing while the grey day passed them by.
“This fucking sucks. I can’t even comfort my own boyfriend!” Harry growled at his plate. “What do I do now?”
“No…” Draco ran his hands down his thighs, smoothing his trousers and picking off imaginary lint. “Thank you. For your help.”
“We’ll worry about that later,” Harry said, snatching the tentacle dildo and banishing it to somewhere in their bedroom. “Into the fake lake with you! You have a husband to examine!”
“Probably not.” Harry gave him a teasing smile. “But I suppose we’ll find out! How long will the potion last?”
“And what about the Littles?”
A celebration was in order.
Draco ran a hand down Harry’s chest and gave him a coy look through his lashes. “Want to pretend it’s my first time on a broom? Maybe ride yours together?”
“Yeah, no I get it,” Draco hurried to reassure him. “I-I definitely get it.”
But they had late afternoons and evenings together. Ron understood the novelty of it all for Harry and steered clear of their room until ten o’clock each night without complaint. Although he did specify that after the Easter holiday they’d have to work out some sort of schedule so Ron could have his alone time with Hermione back.
“Told him what?” Hermione asked, looking at both of them.
More horrible, industrial soap for Harry’s body. And all right, Draco really did enjoy this part. And not just because he got to be the one in the spray of water. He also got to run the soapy flannel across Harry’s firm chest, down the ridges of his sculpted abs, and around the hard cock pointing right at Draco. Harry moaned and rolled his hips gently through the circle of Draco’s fist and nipped lightly at Draco’s earlobe.
make me laugh when I’m furious with you! Did you hear what I said? My mother said ‘lover’s semen’ to me, Harry!”
As Harry pulled his jeans on under his hospital gown, he shrugged off her comment. “We can’t do anything until we’re back in our regular bodies anyway. I’ll need some time to think about it.”
to hear about limes.”
Ron rolled his eyes. “Yeah, I know. Question is, what are we going to do about it?”
“What the fuck are you talking about?” The sense of dread spread, making his face and hands tingle.
“Mandrakes. I’ll let the lab know, so they can verify before we treat him.” The healer indicated the bed. "Try not to jostle him too much, but you can hold his hand if you like. It won’t damage the stasis spells.” He nodded to Potter and Draco, then pulled the curtain closed behind him.
“The thirteen years of marriage sort of tipped me off on that point.” Harry took out the cork. “It’s okay if you turn me down later. There’s always tomorrow.”
Harry set the box aside and pushed Draco back on the bed, covering him completely. “That’s because you’re mine, aren’t you?” He kissed Draco deeply, squeezing his hips and then running his hands up Draco’s sides. “Only mine. Forever.” His deep, husky voice heated the blood coursing through Draco’s veins.
Harry dragged them into every single shop on High Street, looking for just the right thing to buy for Draco. When Harry declared that ‘something special’ to be a collection of muggle sweets, he thought Theo might explode right there in Honeydukes.
“No, you said you had a meeting and as I’ve been following you to meetings for the last two months, I assumed you wanted me to follow.”
This dildo had been
Harry moaned in protest, “But I love it when you’re all dirty.” Then his face lit up. “Come shower with me. We can clean up together.”
“There’s time for that tomorrow. Let’s go see what’s happening in the common room.”
think of Malfoy that way. After Malfoy brushed off Harry’s subtle attempts at flirtation, he decided he didn’t need more than their nod-in-passing relationship. Especially with some odd duck that wore ladies’ knickers. Hot pink ones, no less.
Because Draco had a wand and nothing was going to ruin his day.
Ron broke out in loud laughter, elbowing Ginny hard enough to knock her into Angelina sitting next to her. “Draco!” Ron giggled, wiping non-existent tears. “That would be perfect. Definitely invite Harry over for key lime pie.”
A prickle of apprehension shot down Draco’s spine as he watched Harry add three drops of Calming Draught to a mug of tea after dinner. What the fuck was on the agenda that Harry needed calming for?
Onlookers be damned, Harry grinned and pulled Draco in for a swift, light kiss. “You’re my new favourite.”
! A way to show Draco all the care and respect Harry intended with their relationship.
But only if they got caught.
“Is that when you attack me as soon as I roll through the floo?”
“I think I’m done with breakfast.” Harry got to his feet and took a step back, glancing around the nearly empty Great Hall. “Ready to head back?”
“Finally, Potter, we find a use for that mouth of yours,” Draco said, slipping into his role easily enough. He tugged on Harry’s hair when he saw him reaching for the flies of his jeans. “Uh, uh, uh, naughty boy. Focus on the task at hand.” Harry’s eyes met his and he gave Harry a smirk. “Well, at
“Pregnancy is making Pansy completely daft. She cried for ten minutes about some white roses in their greenhouse, ate six peaches—one right after the other—drank about four bottles of lemonade, and then collapsed in bed. Dead asleep. I’m not sure what happened there but I’m free now!”
Mr Talpin opened the file and flipped through it with Ms Coddle. She pulled out a parchment from the stack. “I see… You didn’t mention you already
“You love me?” Harry interrupted. Joy exploded in his chest as he beamed at Draco.
Draco looked between them and said to Ron, “You read fanfiction too? Harry said he would tell me about it but it never came up.”
“Are you… Are you saying you…” Harry could hardly voice the words, afraid that his over-excited brain had jumped to the wrong conclusion.
“Sod off already, I said I’m going!” Harry stuck his tongue out at Ron and hurried across the eighth year common room before he could retaliate.
“I know. But it made me realise how scary this all is. What if one day we don’t time things just right or someone misses a cue? One of us might be planning a funeral instead of sexy times.” The thought of losing Draco to a silly game kept him up late too many nights ever since the accident.
(7:38 pm) Enjoy your dinner and text me tomorrow.
“She said she wouldn’t sell it, but wouldn’t mind perhaps joint custody after the divorce. Can you believe that? Already talking about divorce when we didn’t even have a courtship contract! She said she’d talked about it with her girlfriend and they’re interested in children and that maybe we can work out something mutually beneficial. A short marriage, a few children, an amicable divorce, and shared custody.”
After a few pieces, Draco bowed with a flourish and stowed his violin. “What now?” He sat next to Harry, leaning forward expectantly.
Harry smiled at Draco. “We’ve become good friends this year.” He didn’t mention the life debt and hoped she knew nothing about it. Except that it had ended already. “I’d like to be more than friends.”
Ms Coddle had said no more than two weeks, so when they hadn’t heard anything by the fifteenth, Draco went to the office in person. It only inflamed his anger that she seemed to anticipate his arrival.
“Where did you get that?!” Neville asked, reaching for it.
“Naked,” Draco agreed. Couldn’t let all those spa treatments go to waste. Skin to skin was definitely called for.
he repeated frequently. He also wanted to avoid the bustling crowds of parents, so the Littles wouldn’t be frightened.
“Oh shit. You think Narcissa is on her way?”
“Well she knew I was gay already, which I thought was good. And actually, she thought that was a point in my favour as she has a girlfriend of her own.” Draco sat back to let Harry absorb that for a moment.
“Potter, how many times do I have to tell you we’re not friends?”
Perhaps his moment had come. Harry pulled the brochure from his pocket. “I also thought… Maybe we could do something different this time.”
And of fucking
“I’m not going to lie. That was sexy and fun and unexpected. But it’s also the place where I work. With two other people that I have to see day in and day out.”
“Maybe we can convince Theo to switch rooms.”
Harry grinned as they turned into the Great Hall. “I can’t stop thinking about what I’d name the dogs. Like funny little pairings. I love animals named for food so I thought of something like Salt and Pepper.”
Draco slapped Harry’s arse. “Get undressed while I bin this. Maybe we should sort through the toy box and get rid of things we don’t like anymore.”
“Would you play for me?”
“Maybe his
Weasley snorted and pulled his wand. For a second Draco tensed, wondering if he should respond in kind, but no, it was only a Patronus he cast. A silvery magpie flew off and seconds later a terrier appeared saying, “I’m alone, go ahead.”
Has anyone written an AU where Baz was successful with the tape recorder?
Potter unbuttoned his robe. “I’ll take mine off.”
Draco closed his eyes when he saw the familiar label on a familiar bottle of massage oil. “Please, for the love of Merlin, tell me you did
“Wait it out,” Blaise said kindly. “There isn’t much else you can do.”
“Don’t have—Are you kidding right now? It’s a galleon. Take your joggers off.”
“If we’re going to do it again, I’d prefer it happened when no one else was in the shop.”
“I don’t know. I can’t think anymore.” He tilted his head back and let Draco continue kissing down to the dip in his collarbone.
“You will never convince me that having the weight of the world on your shoulders doesn’t need relieving sometimes,” Potter said firmly.
Annie gripped Draco all the harder, almost whimpering into his neck. Unfazed, Ms Coddle turned to Daria, holding tightly to Daphne’s hand. “How about you?” She knelt down with a gentle smile. “Do you like staying here?”
Draco shouted above the din, “Enough!” As the room fell quiet, he surveyed all the children. “Okay. Alex and Jason—you both are seventeen and you get to decide if you go back or not.” The two boys looked at each other, Jason excited, but Alex contemplative. “But that’s not a decision I’m letting you make alone. We’ll talk about it later.”
“Why not? Seems like the best of both worlds.”
“They took Orion from us,” Draco growled at Ms Coddle, his words coming out more aggressively than he wanted. “Did you know? Did you know what they were planning when you invited me here today?”
“I bought it for the lie. I gave it to you for coming here today. I know you hate me but it means a lot to Draco to have his family here.”
“Isn’t dragon the obvious choice?”
It wasn’t enough, given the darkening of the welcome wizard’s frown. “No, he isn’t. But you can leave him a message and I’ll be sure he gets it.” The tight, bitter smile didn’t give Draco much hope of
This was the first six sentence story I ever wrote so it seems the best one to kick off the year!
“Thank you all for coming, even though none of you were invited,” he said as the group arranged themselves in a semi-circle around him.
His cock hardened as the hot shower drove the chill away. He gave himself a few quick strokes, wondering what to do next.
He plucked a few apples from the pile and tossed them in his basket. “No reason, I suppose.” Had her parents been arrested too? The Greengrasses were notoriously neutral. “Erm… if you’re free this afternoon… Some of us are having an ongoing party at mine. If you want to come.”
The ups and downs of running the shop always made him happy to return to the peaceful serenity of their cottage and his perfect husband waiting with a smile. And tonight they would stay up entirely too late for a work night, as if they weren’t usually in bed by ten o’clock.
Greg came over and picked Elyon up, then slapped Bryce on the back. “We’ll take good care of him. Don’t you worry.” Elyon buried his face in Greg’s neck as he returned to the group, with Greg whispering words of reassurance in his ear.
“Yeah, I mean we’ve been eating on it for weeks without problems, right?” Harry set the bag on the worktop and began pulling out containers.
Potter smiled at that. “Good. We can learn together.”
“Good to know.” Draco leaned down for another kiss.
“Muggle real. Dolphin. Duck, but we’ve already got Daniel Duck. Oh, Dragonfly. Something like that might work? Hm, Draco’s a tough one.”
Blaise’s suspicion instantly turned to glee. “Hoo-hoo, the plot thickens. I do love a good plot twist. I trust there’s mischief afoot?”
Theo went along the long wall, touching up little bits of paint here and there. “Definitely more fun than the hideous design that was there before. What was your mother thinking?”
“Sure, we’ve had flirty banter and shared pastries. Now you’ve given me a gift. Plus, I’m lemon deprived and desperate.”
“Up,” Harry said, turning on his back and tugging at Draco’s arm. “I want to watch you.”
Almost shyly he would tweak Draco’s fingers in passing or bump their knees together at the dinner table. At the next film night (
Pair by pair, Draco sent the children to the train. He could only hope this wasn’t a vast and horrid mistake. McGonagall wouldn’t have asked them back if she didn’t think she could keep them safe. Their forced immersion into the muggle world had changed them all. Perhaps the other students would see that, given enough time.
“It’s something to dry your hair, neaten it a bit. Glamour your eyes. You look like you’re high on something.”
Draco laughed and shook his head. The potion helped pull up several memories of Draco wanking over Harry Potter, but he couldn’t pinpoint which was the last. “I don’t know. I don’t remember the last time I got off on my own now that I have you to play with all the time.”
Harry rolled his eyes but chewed his food more carefully. “How was Potions?”
And most importantly, would he let Harry see them sometime?
Harry Potter once again.
As the children ran around the yard in a typical disorganised game of football, Pansy sat with Daria, Annie, and Draco. She helped Daria plait flowers into Annie’s hair. “Do you think he’ll report back to the Aurors?” Pansy whispered.
The children skipped and ran from the room, taking their shrieking elsewhere. Except for Jane.
--------
“Right, sure,” Potter said. But he still eyed Draco like a dark curse about to go off. His eyes darted down to the chocolate frogs in Draco’s basket. “Erm… that’s a lot of frogs?”
“Harry, I did everything they wanted. We did everything right. Courting and asking about a betrothal. It’s only their own stubbornness and prejudice that won’t let us get married. If you were a woman we’d never have had this much trouble.”
With an inward groan, Harry smiled and lifted his ice cream in greeting. Draco crossed the shop and sat with him, smiling hesitantly. Although he’d missed Draco this last week or so, he’d hoped to have a little more time to come to terms with their abrupt break-up before seeing him again.
More food, more food. How much more food? Draco should have asked how many more people there were before Daphne ran off. He grabbed a bag of grapes, a bunch of bananas, and a bag of baby carrots (even if carrots were tastelessly revolting), then searched out sweets.
get our discharge papers together. And we can spend the evening planning your first date.”
Theo and Hermione groaned loudly, while Neville, Blaise, and Ron began to giggle like small children.
Draco shut the shower off and angrily dried his face and body. “You’d better be.” He shouldered past Harry to the bedroom, and dug through his drawer of clothes.
Sometimes we all have down days and need a little comfort.
“No—shit—no, I’m not here on official business.” Potter seemed to only now realise he still wore his Auror trainee robes. He took the tunic off, revealing a dingy t-shirt underneath, and draped it over his arm. “I just came by floo. The visitors’ floo. Straight from Diagon after my classes today.”
Harry grinned and gave Draco a loud, smacking kiss. “Undoubtedly I will.”
His dear, sweet husband was smiling around a dozen roses and a bakery box.
Draco couldn’t remember the last time he’d felt such a hot spark of anticipation. Each day Harry arrived after Auror training (or earlier, if he randomly decided to cut his training short—why hadn’t they kicked him out? Oh right, he was
“But it’s a muggle shower…” Draco whined.
One other Elf, Dowdy, agreed to be freed, but the other two politely declined. Still, two House Elves was enough to improve their lives drastically. They had a large feast days later to celebrate the end of cheese toasties at every meal.
“We can’t,” Draco whined, even though his hips canted forward against Harry’s burgeoning erection. “We were alone back then. Why don’t we go upstairs?” His office and lab could at least provide some better privacy.
“Are you sure?” Harry asked, ever hopeful he could offer comfort of a sort. Damn these chastity spells!
“You say it!”
And with matching grins on their faces, they raced up the stairs to Draco’s hideous yellow room.
“Let’s tentatively plan for eight?”
That grandmother’s story warmed Harry whenever he fell into doubt about his current projects, and he never stopped to wonder why. But now he knew. She
Draco sighed. “If it’s another baby I’m going to scream louder than Annie.”
She flipped through the book with a sullen eye roll, but agreed to his terms. A warm bed and a full belly had tamed the little wolf considerably. Especially with winter right around the corner.
All three books had a plain black cover with small, unembellished white lettering on them. They looked just like any other random old book from the Hogwarts library that had been rebound and lost its original, more interesting cover.
As Ms Coddle made her introductions, Pansy and Daphne smiled politely, but Draco could see the terror in their eyes. Hermione Granger
“Well they’re not really orphans, are they?” Draco said bitterly. He wrenched the bicycle away. “If you’ll excuse me, I have ice cream melting.”
to find a home like—like this one.”
his fingers caress the gate and, without hesitation, it swings open. Simon’s grin is blinding as the school welcomes him home.
“Wow, nothing. I’m so confused right now.” He met Draco’s eyes. “But I do like you.”
All the same, Harry had a rough night, unable to get the image out of his head. Malfoy’s skin, the hot pink lace, and those two bright spots of colour on his cheeks. Like strawberries and cream. He finally caved to his curiosity and went to his carefully warded study. No magic allowed in the room meant a computer worked just fine. Well enough for an enlightening internet search.
And then Harry wondered if he merely wanted to fuck with them. Every time he leaned forward to speak to Draco, Theo also leaned forward. So Harry leaned back to talk around him and then Theo leaned back. Harry rolled his eyes and decided it would be easiest to talk to Neville and Ron for the rest of dinner, and just talk with Draco later.
The tour continued down the back staircase near the kitchens. Draco glanced at Potter a few times, and always found him staring. Fucking git. Draco didn’t care how ridiculous he looked wearing a small child in a navy and cream floral print baby wrap. Annie’s comfort meant more to Draco than Potter’s useless opinion.
(4:39 pm) I’m hoping it won’t be weird. With 73 there.
“This is stupid. Why are we doing this?”
(5:55 pm) Or it’ll be hellishly awkward with everyone talking about the upcoming wedding. It’s a toss-up, really.
Draco was suspicious about what Harry might be doing in the back garden but he’d promised not to peek until preparations were complete. All the evasiveness around today’s theme made him nervous, as it had each day this month. But Harry had taken good care of him so far and he trusted nothing outrageous would be happening.
Less than a minute later a falcon patronus swooped in and a woman’s voice said, “I’ll open the wards.”
“I love you too, you know.”
It isn’t enough, his arse in the air for me; I want more.
“That seems monumentally unfair.”
Draco laughed at Lizzie shrieking when Orion poked her in the eye. He shook his head and passed the plate of sandwiches to Pansy. She frowned heavily at him.
“I know. I’d let it get away with anything. If I were an animagus, I’d want to be something cuddly and not too big. Like a rabbit or a mooncalf. They always seem happy.”
Draco giggled and rolled his eyes, shooting Harry one last coy look before swinging his leg over the broom. He wriggled unnecessarily, just to press his arse back against Harry.
“Yes he’s fine now.” Draco pulled the scroll from his pocket as he stood. The floor pitched underneath him but he managed to stay upright. “And he’s ours to keep.”
But then a light tapping sounded at the common room window. Harry opened it to let in the large eagle owl. It flew across the room to Draco, dropped the letter into his trembling hand and then promptly turned around and flew back out into the night.
Draco’s worn face broke into a wide smile when he opened the door. “Harry! I was wondering if you’d be stopping by.”
They ended up with four portkeys to take the entire group directly to Platform Nine and Three-quarters. Pansy, Daphne, Theo, and Greg kept the little ones as far from the muggle barrier as possible, while Draco took care of directing the students.
He spun on his heel and stormed back to the lift. He needed to contact his solicitors. Perhaps they could spin the letter left with Orion into some sort of guardianship rights with Draco. He smacked the button over and over, willing the lift doors to open.
Draco smiled and kissed his beloved with all the love in his heart. “Do you want to see mine?” he whispered. “How it felt when I knew? Or when you proposed?”
At the Manor gates, two children huddled together looking grimier than any new arrival had thus far. Both had ratty, shorn hair and stained, ill fitting clothing. How long had they been out in the world alone?
“No, of course not,” Ginny said tightly. “I bought him the orchid when we dated.”
Harry snorted. “Yeah, well, I’m with men too, but
“Ooh, I’ll poke myself with a pin so I can fake some tears when I’m rejected! And I’ll be sure to hire a photographer to capture their horrified faces so we can remember the moment forever.”
Dean had outdone himself with the adorable artwork of a chubby green and silver dragon wrapped around a little black-haired boy hugging the spiky tail.
Draco couldn’t help but laugh. “I’m rather partial to the ridiculous. Like Lady Fluffington or Lord Periwinkle von Twinkletoes.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Potter, you imbecile… If we get caught, I’m claiming you threatened my life. What were you hoping for here?”
“No,” Harry laughed nervously, “I’m serious. Those are mine. I was going to—to tell you. Tonight. I—look.” He stood and unzipped his jeans, tugging them down a little so Draco could see the grey silk, trimmed over with wide, white lace.
“Oh. Well… I don’t really need—”
Draco’s name came out like a broken sigh and Harry almost reached for him again. “So you don’t… you don’t regret anything?”
believe this story. Never, ever in a million years. Harry focused hard on the memory to make it vivid enough to pensieve. A snorting laugh turned into wheezing laughter that had him wiping away tears. Narcissa Malfoy said
“Got it in one!” Harry said, also looking around. “Come on, I think we can get into the passenger carriages easily enough.”
“Maybe it’s… maybe it’ll be fine,” Draco said. But Harry could see he had no confidence that anything would be
“I’m not ready.”
“Here goes,” Harry said, tipping the single dose into his mouth. He closed his eyes and his face flushed lightly. When he opened his eyes again, they shone brightly with manic glee. “You know what we should do?”
“I love a Sunday afternoon nap.”
with the fucking hunting dog, he’d have saved it for a night when Potter wasn’t around. At least the fox and hound separated at the end of the film. Although that clearly wasn’t what Potter took away from it. Draco deserved a medal for the brave way he endured Potter’s shy smile and soft goodbye that evening.
But now in Harry’s mind, he could feel the warm longing that grew with each passing moment. In the memory, Draco began to shine brighter and brighter as the rest of the party faded away.
The first splash of come streaked across his cheek and his tongue darted out to catch it but then -
“Potter,” Malfoy replied kindly, sipping his beer.
“Poor, sad Harry Potter,” Draco said with a mocking sadness. “For the first time, it didn’t seem so funny anymore. I mean, what are we twelve? To be concerned in any way about our school houses? It made me realise how public your life really is. How everyone takes from you all the time and… I don’t know, I suppose having something no one knows about you… that must be very special to you.”
“Love potions are on the list?” Hmm, maybe Draco should have taken a look after all.
And no electric jolt accompanied it.
“That’s so romantic, my darling.”
It took a few weeks for the novelty to wear off, but not his general enjoyment over the knickers. He had a wide array of pairs now and only kept his old boxer briefs just in case—in case of Harry-didn’t-know-what.
Ginny finally lost her stiff posture, melting into something resembling concern. “Oh no! The purple orchid?”
“Sorry, Harry,” Neville said with a smothered smile, following Blaise to their room.
“Ah ha!”
Draco’s eyebrows went up. “Wow, someone went to a lot of trouble!”
Harry had just about all he could take of this relentless idiot that couldn’t take a hint, and decided to try a new tactic. “Mm, like this?” Harry asked seductively, leaning in with a smile and tracing along the other man’s lip. In a flash, he shoved his finger straight up the idiot’s nose hard enough to make him shriek like a banshee and jerk backwards.
“You’ll like these.” Draco pulled out a wooden box and swung open the double door lid to reveal tiny shelves of tiny books.
Potter reeled back, stunned, and began stammering, “Of course not—I wasn’t—you can do whatever you want, Malfoy. I mean, within reason, of course,” he finished with a nervous laugh.
“Are they?”
She ran after the rest of the group, and Draco sighed. Pansy took hold of his arm and rested her head on his shoulder. “I hope that’s the truth.”
Draco let out a smothered, incredulous giggle with more than a hint of hysteria. “Don’t you dare! Don’t you
“To who? Is it serious? Something you need help with?”
(12:26 pm) I’ve got Nagoya, Hakata, and Sendai.
The possessive fire shining in Harry’s eyes reassured him he had nothing to worry about on either score.

person this afternoon to ask him that. “It’s not pink eye! It’s - I got shampoo in my eye! And then… had a bit of a crying jag.” Next to him, Harry sniggered, practically begging for Draco to smack his arm. Which he did.
“But Harry, don’t you see? She’s just like me. Trapped by her parents’ whims in order to secure her education and future. The only reason my parents haven’t cracked down harder on me is they know
“I asked him to. I was afraid you wouldn’t get a fair shake otherwise. He knew I was right within minutes, the way Blakely and Coddle pissed vinegar during the meeting. But you seem to have won her over.”
Draco’s back hit the door with a dull thud he hoped didn’t alert their neighbours. He didn’t need the muggles in this hotel poking their heads into the hallway when he had Harry just where he wanted him - licking the sweat from Draco’s neck and nibbling his ear.
“What are you — that’s my
But Harry was beyond speech and could only manage more obscene moans. Especially when Draco stepped closer and tugged Harry’s head back to kiss him in a wild mess of teeth and tongue. He nipped hard at Harry’s lips and a second later groaned loudly as his come splashed across Harry’s hip. Held in place like that, Harry could only manage a low roll of his hips, but it was enough to send him catapulting over the edge too, shuddering and moaning while caught between Draco and the wall.
“My parents…” Draco trailed off but he didn’t need to elaborate.
“All the same… I think she’s… She misses her family. She doesn’t have much of it left.”
But Ron’s frown mirrored Harry’s as they both examined Ginny with an outsider’s point of view.
“He—he was just left here? With a note?” Potter asked softly. Granger took his hand.
“Sure, that sounds lovely.” Draco sat at the table and took a biscuit, nibbling on it while Harry readied their tea. His glance strayed to the paper. “This isn’t today’s paper.”
At first, Harry focused on his work. The interesting turn of this branch, the clump of flowers growing near a burrow in some roots, the rabbit track running between the trees. When he got up to take a few pictures, he caught Draco’s attention for a moment, but then Draco returned to his book.
“Even better!” Harry slapped Draco’s arse. “I’ll dig them out of the toy box. Why don’t you find some candles to set the mood?”
“That can’t be right because you look
you, but not
Ugh, fine. Draco through his hands up in the air and sighed in frustration. “I’m learning, all right? Just like you.”
“My parents tossed that shit right out the window,” Ron said, climbing into his bed. “Eloped as soon as school ended to avoid it. But I’ve heard about it anyway. There’s going to be a contract you have to sign. Rules to follow. Each family has their own traditions but… I hope you enjoy celibacy.”
“I can’t get this straight,” Harry whined, tugging at the bow tie that continued to lie diagonally.
“Want to play exploding snap?” Harry asked at last. He didn’t even bring any cards with him.
“Welcome to Sweet Treats. My name is Amanda. Just let me know when you’re ready to put your box together!” The young woman behind the counter smiled widely, and gestured to the display boxes of various sizes on the wall behind her.
A large Chinese fireball, all in black ink, streaked across Harry’s chest from left hip to right shoulder. As Harry shook off his shirt, his muscles flexed and the fireball seemed to undulate in flight. By all accounts, it should be ridiculous. Harry wasn’t the tattooed type. But all the same, it was too fucking hot for words.
“You think—wait a minute! Are we
! I’d sooner live in the forest again!”
Jane stiffened when the group approached her so Pansy and Theo hung back to let Draco talk with her alone. He knelt down a foot away from her, hoping that by sitting on the floor he appeared less threatening. “Jane, Robbie’s going to need a few days to heal properly. You’re welcome to stay here with us while he does. So we can keep an eye on him.”
. The thought made him giggle and almost choke on the rinse water. He could put up with an early bird if it meant having someone to call his own.
“What’s that?” Pansy asked.
would be taken away and that after today, no one would be investigating them anymore. Safe at last.
That only got him more hearts and kisses, but now flowers as well.
Their landing certainly could have gone smoother, but Draco couldn’t really blame Potter for that. His shaky legs collapsed from under him and it was only Potter’s quick reflexes that kept him from shattering his knees on the marble entryway.
This came about from a funny misunderstanding when I heard someone mention in a Carry-On Discord a fic with Baz measuring Simon -- turns out it was for a suit. I wrote this six sentence short to make us all laugh, and then expanded it into a full fic, which you can find here -
Of course he waits until we’re both settled under the warm covers before asking, “Why do I always have to be the little spoon?”
“I can help you.”
“Fuck no,” Draco burst out with his own blush. “I mean… go on if you like. Just…” He closed his eyes. “Merlin, that’s so fucking hot. But I can’t watch or I won’t be able to finish. Playing! Finish playing the song.
Harry pressed his hips forward with a groan of frustration. “Finish what you started or else.”
“There’s always going to be loads of responsibilities heaped on you. Don’t you have some sort of eight year plan? I can wait eight years. We can be friends in the meantime.” He gave Draco’s fingers a squeeze. “Or, we can work around our obstacles, just like other couples do.”
He mentioned his pursuit of an art degree at a muggle university and how his sketches and ficlets on the blog evolved into a publishing contract. He left out the long hours he needed to work while completing his first book and the fights he had with Ginny about it. Fighting that led to their second major break-up. That might have been it for them, but then Ginny left the Harpies for a regular job at the
Draco snorted. “You can’t be serious. You want to fuck around in our back garden? Harry, it’s October!”
Mrs Stokke ended the enchantment on her quill and gathered all her things. “Appeals to the Wizengamot’s decision may be made within sixty days.” And without further word she swept out of the room.
Ginny opened her mouth to respond, but Pansy spoke over her. “At least the dumb plant is out of your life forever. And you got a great blog post out of it.”
“Ah excellent! Let me get some paperwork.” He ducked below the counter and came up with a single piece of parchment. “If you don’t mind signing the waiver here. Are you gentlemen interested in the public rooms or would you like a private room?”
“Do you?”
“But we
“It didn’t look like much was sorted up there so I chucked that box in some random pile.”
And Draco went free.
“Oops,” Harry laughed, squeezing gently, “I seem to have missed the bowl.”
My “no” comes out with too much desperation.
Harry mentally sighed. How long could they play this game? He didn’t want to start another argument about the confusing double standard of celibacy before marriage and the allowance of rampant infidelity after. Wasn’t monogamy better? He rubbed at the ache building behind his eyes. Maybe it was just the weariness of the back and forth between life debts and the in-between.
“You’re going to pay for this,” Harry whispered.
“Yes,” Harry hissed in delight. He reached for the buttons of Draco’s waistcoat and they fumbled together to get them undone. His shirt quickly followed and Harry drew Draco back down. He moaned as the heat of Draco’s body covered him. “This is utterly mad. Kiss me again.”
And so it became a nicely appointed study where Draco could continue his post-Hogwarts schooling and study for his Healers exam. Tonight he took a page from Benedict and Jocelyn and had Harry crawl across the floor naked to blow him against his desk.
Draco ate four marshmallows from the bag and nodded. “Seems simple enough.”
“Can’t,” David yelled back as he whizzed by Draco. “Lavinia’s being a crabby pants again.”
“You are insatiable!” Harry laughed. “Don’t you want to… I don’t know… get to know each other better? Isn’t it moving a little fast to get naked together so soon?”
Draco laughed and reached for his husband, carefully running a hand along the side arm of the frames and into Harry’s potion-tamed hair. “Where did you get these?”
Twelve brightly lit candles sat evenly spaced in a circle around some large cushions in the centre of the lawn. Above them, Draco could see the wavering air of a warming charm fighting off the night-time chill.
“Don’t!” David yelled. “Don’t tell him where we are! If he knows, he has to say. Right now he can still sort of lie about it.”
“You don’t want me holding on to you?”
“Hey!” Potter called. Of course Potter had to follow him. “Malfoy, wait!” Huffing slightly, Potter grabbed Draco’s arm to pull him to a halt. “You—you didn’t buy the robe.”
Harry wanted to live in this perfect moment forever.
“Yes, technically. But it would lend credence to your application if you had a more mature adult on your board.”
Something cracked and splintered inside Harry as Ginny forced a smile across the table. Adrenaline simmered in Harry’s blood as he watched Draco, eyes shining and excited, lean forward to twist the knife. “Even I know a plant’s a terrible idea, and I’ve only known him a week.”
? The issue of kids could be worked out later. And he could give Draco space for a day or two. Surely Lucius and Narcissa wouldn’t wait too long to accept.
“I want your body under mine. I want to feel your movements along every inch of my skin. I want you moaning in my ears and your nails digging into my back.”
“Me too. You’re welcome to shower first. Get all that muck off.”
“Noted.”
Ron slapped him on the back. “Real happy for you, mate. You deserve it.”
“Because I go home, or I play around here, and I rest and somehow manage to convince myself that it wasn’t so bad. That I can do some good. Fix things so they’re better.”
, and whether

“No, I promise. No Ministry.”
Pansy eyed them openly with a smirk on her face. She and Daphne missed most of the film, whispering together and glancing over at Draco and Harry frequently. She pulled Draco to his study as soon as Harry disappeared through the floo that night.
Not a
He threw his hands up in the air. “Well I know you just told me you see Hermione the same way you see Malfoy and after how your body reacted to Malfoy, I’m just letting you know I’m not happy about that.”
like it.
“Yeah, sure, I guess.” Harry shrugged when Draco continued to stare in that odd way. Did Draco like the idea or didn’t he? “Except I’m terrible at subterfuge.”
Or he could say yes. He could attempt to be young and carefree as neither of them had been before. He could try to enjoy something wholesome and good in his difficult life.
“Just in time!” Harry said, welcoming Draco home from work with a sweet kiss. “Dinner is ready!”
Harry Potter would help.
“Harry, my Harry, you fucking dream, I’m going to come all over this glass, fuck me harder…” he moaned, seconds before splashing his release over a wide span of glass.
“Yeah, okay, let’s do that.”
) and she needed a new one. A mad giggle escaped him as he sat up.
“Feeling you move, Draco… how are you so hot? After all these years, it’s still never enough of you…”
“Probably because your brain is caught on your wood. Go take care of it and then come back to bed with me.”
One afternoon in mid-July, Theo and Draco supervised a game of tag outside in the garden. Draco pulled out four brooms from a shed, and distributed them to the older children. They had to set a timer on taking turns because everyone wanted a ride.
listed on the board of directors. It seemed only right that I should be here as well.”
“Harry, my dearest husband.” Draco drew him in for a soft kiss in the elegantly appointed suite. “You’re mine now.”
Harry set his mobile on the worktop. “No need to wait any longer, I suppose.” He leaned back, letting Draco take the lead.
“You bought the orchid?” Draco tilted his head, his brow furrowed. “Wait, haven’t you known Harry for ages? Shouldn’t you know better than to give him a plant he can’t take care of?”
Draco didn’t worry when Harry failed to mention the evening’s activities over breakfast. But when he didn’t mention anything over dinner either, he felt like he had to say something. He didn’t want to be surprised by anything uncomfortable.
“I’m—I’m good? Malfoy—your mouth is purple. Are you all right?”
Narcissa nodded at McGonagall. “Thank you, Headmistress for the use of your office. Draco, walk me out.”
With no one around to notice or care about what they did together, Harry had a glimpse of what it might be like to have the privacy of a home with Draco one day. Harry learned that Draco routinely woke up around six o’clock in the morning, but thankfully didn’t expect Harry to do the same. He spent time doing homework until Harry woke on his own closer to eight.
And then Harry flashed him that mischievous grin that always made Draco’s heart race. “It’s only illegal if we get caught.”
They kept anything that had fond memories, or sparked any real pleasure, even if it hadn’t been used in a while. Draco cleaned each piece they kept before setting it in the box.
“Of course,” Harry said quickly, his grin widening.
He woke up extra early the next day so that he could finish his paperwork before lunch, while the kids were in lessons. That left him free after lunch for games. When talk turned to the ugly patterning on the walls of the small ballroom, Draco spelled the whole thing white and joined the children in decorating with every colour of paint they had on hand.

(3:15 pm) It turns out bunnies can be just as angry.

play. And Harry agreed readily when Draco suggested it.
No one really expected Harry Potter to show up. And at the same time, Draco lamented, how could he have expected anything different?
Draco imagined it for a moment—on his back, watching the play of Harry’s muscles as he worked into Draco. His hands buried in Harry’s messy curls, his feet digging into Harry’s arse. All right, he could see how that might be sexy.
“I’m just saying maybe it would be more fair if the top gets to be the big spoon.”
Draco’s fingers slid against the glass as he pressed back into the slow movement of Harry’s cock in and out of him. “Yes, Harry…” he hissed in delight. “Oh love, you are so good. So good… Faster now.”
“Aurors Potter and Weasley, something you’d like to share with the rest of the class?” Malfoy bit out from entirely too close behind them.
“Yes? So?” Draco barked, his hackles raised.
“Malfoy, wait! I can help.”
“Not tonight.” Draco almost relented when Potter’s shoulders dropped a fraction in disappointment.
“This is very exciting. I can’t wait to tell Mother. She’s brought it up to me several times already.” He patted the pocket with her letter inside.
“Yeah. Muggles don’t let two men get married so they do this instead. There’s some sort of candle thing and we’d write our own vows…” Harry bit his lip and ducked his head to try and catch Draco’s eye. “What do you think?”
This time Draco grinned and tilted his head enough that their lips could meet. Softly, gently. He nibbled lightly at Harry’s bottom lip until Harry opened up and let Draco’s tongue sweep through. Draco’s hand wrapped around Harry’s waist as the kiss deepened.
The squeeze of Side-Along Apparition nearly made Draco vomit. He swayed dangerously into Potter.
(12:24 pm) I write children’s books which means I sit around in my pjs all day drawing mischievous animals that talk like 5 year olds. And I goof around on the internet. What’s the clue?

“Yes, we are aware of that. I included the supplementary form for it.”
“So you know how I’ve been making Theo as miserable as possible during his courtship of Lisette?”
“Isn’t it usually my job to complain about the cost of a thing and your job to remind me we are the richest people we know?”
And Pansy, the traitorous cow, grinned. “Lately, yes.”
“I’ve missed you,” Harry said, kicking off his trainers and taking his place beside Draco. His hand rested on the bed between them, unable to reach for Draco without causing an uncomfortable shock.
I’m not with the Ministry.”
. Can you put on some of that perfume? You know, that one in the swirly bottle.”
“Relax, I’ve got this.” Harry directed them into a swirling dive that had Draco shrieking like a banshee. Harry’s laugh was caught by the wind. His arm tightened around Draco’s waist. “I’ve got you.”
“We don’t,” Draco said, gathering the sleepy baby in his arms. Orion whined and burrowed into Draco’s shoulder. “Based on the clothes he fits into and the milestones the baby books mention, we guess he’s turning one soon. We’ve given him the fourth of October, because it’s the same as my friend Greg and he liked the idea of sharing.” He pressed his lips together, knowing sleep-deprived babble might get him in trouble.
Harry nodded. “As usual. Now kiss me goodnight and go before I can’t let you go.”
“That’s none of your business,” Harry said, a flush spreading across his cheeks. He actually hadn’t thought that far ahead, and honestly the spells were low on his list of concerns. Really what he wanted was some time alone with Draco, without Theo hovering like a black cloud. Sex could wait. “Do we have a deal?”
“Yes.”
“Me too. Angry sex is stupid,” Draco whispered, kissing lightly along Harry’s closed eyes and down to his lips. “I think what we need is comfort sex.” He took Harry’s hand and turned towards the bedroom. “Now.”
Damn, what Draco wouldn’t give for a drink, but Annie slammed into his legs and held her chubby arms out to him. “Hold me.”
“Shall I call you Jane?” he persisted.
“I want to know what it feels like when I’m inside you. From your perspective.”
“Complacent how?”
“Right, sorry.
As the memory came into focus, Draco realised they weren’t looking at the first time he’d worn them. That had been at a Ministry charity event where he’d barely seen Harry. As soon as he thought it, other images of Draco in those robes shot across his vision—of the charity event, of a wedding of a work friend—before focusing once again on the pertinent memory.
“Or it was too late in the day—”
“Thank you, Madam Stokke.” Matilda Coddle went over Draco’s application and the results of the inspection, finding everything in proper order with no suspicious activity or motives noted. “He genuinely wants the best for these children.”
He would miss Astoria and Marrin weaving flower crowns for Libby and Annie. And the way Alex took Chester for a ride on his broom. Elyon tried not to show it, but he would be inconsolable when his brother Bryce left for school. But at least he wouldn’t be alone, Draco thought with a smile as Daria chased Elyon around, nearly colliding with Jason and Alex, who were blowing bubbles for Orion and Roger.
“I’m not a
“I’ll wait with her,” Marrin said, taking Leila by the hand.
“I met the witch my parents found. Couldn’t avoid it really since they invited her to dinner without telling me. Her name’s Regina and she’s actually a very nice witch.”
Draco laughed into Harry’s shoulder. “You sweet, simple sap! It was nearly like any other Saturday!”
“Yes… just like that.”
Draco didn’t know if it was exciting or terrifying. Probably some mix of both. “I changed my mind. I don’t want to catch the snitch. I want to be back on the ground.”
has a bit of a denial problem.”
That evening, the baby was named Orion and happily passed around to all the waiting arms. He seemed more interested in the new faces than he did with the bottle of formula he was offered. Draco had bought a variety of outfits for him to wear, and the six to nine month size fitted him best.
... Yes… Fuck, say it again. Tell me to come…”
“No.” Draco kissed Orion’s head and rubbed his back. “Thank you, but no. I’d rather carry him.” After almost losing the baby today, Draco couldn’t bear to be parted, no matter the heavy weight on his tired arms. “Press the button for the lift.”
Harry came home with takeaway to find Draco examining the dining room table, wand in hand.
“Welcome to Murray’s,” the young wizard behind the counter said with a smile. “How can I help you?”
Staring at the official scroll in his hand, Draco almost began crying. It hardly seemed real that they’d won and it was all over.
“You should try twisting your wand at the end. It helps prevent those knots.”
“Better than Beans.”
“You think I want to play around with you now?’
He doesn’t even hesitate in whipping the shirt over his head and says, “I think these boxers are yours too.” He hooks his thumbs in the waistband and gives me a look, as though waiting for me to give him permission.
“Wait! Shouldn’t we at least attempt to plan how this will go?”
--------
“It disguises the fact that my life is woefully lacking in lemons. Here, have your slice of pie. It’s to die for.” He handed Harry one of the smaller boxes and used his wand to conjure a fork.
“Astute as ever, I see.”
Confusion clouded Harry’s thinking. Wouldn’t that remind Draco even more of that day? Harry could easily picture them together, flying over the quidditch pitch with Draco’s arms around him, pressed up against his back, just as he had been that day. He had to admit it made his mouth water, thinking about the warmth they would share, and maybe the soft sighs of excitement from Draco as they circled the pitch without the threat of death hanging over them.
,” he whined back. “I did
Dosing charts didn’t exist for Wolfsbane Potion, so far as they knew. Theo and Draco had done their best to guess how much Robbie and Jane should take each day. Getting them to drink it had been another struggle altogether. Draco could hardly blame them, foul as the brew smelled. But each day he witnessed them drinking it, hoping all the while he wasn’t slowly killing them.
“I’m not aware of any
(12: 13 pm) I should start a list for you, but I know I’d lose it.
“Okay. Shh… it’s all right. Did you know that werewolves lived here before?”
“You know what you need? Slam.” Harry sat up and summoned the deck of cards he knew Draco kept in his desk.

place particularly.”
“Well, I promised him I’d back off a bit if he let me talk with Regina alone. Like,
“And if it doesn’t work,” Draco said, “there’s always the cousins in France to inherit.”
“I was taking more selfies. The cold air made my nipples really hard.”
“Absolutely.”
“Do veela and werewolves have mates?” Harry asked.
Harry didn’t mind Ron and Hermione running a little late for their double date. It gave him a few extra minutes to enjoy Draco nuzzling his neck and teasing the lacy waistband of his knickers.
It only took Draco a few minutes to see the futility of his plan. Wandering the streets would get him nowhere, and he had no guarantee Potter was even around. He needed direct contact. Someone that could get a hold of him easily.
“I’m sorry,” he whispered.
shower at home and the rubbery floor layered in cushioning charms. At least it wouldn’t last long - he could probably finish Harry off in less than five minutes.
Just before leaving he asked, “What did they say to you?” He looked over his shoulder, relieved to see she looked pitying and not horrified.
“Fuck, I’m so sorry,” he said, trying to pull away. Reluctantly, Draco let him go. Potter wiped his face clean, even though his breath hitched a few times and it looked like tears might start again.
That meant Draco had been fucking himself senseless on this very dildo on this very morning.
“You think we’ll be safe at Hogwarts?”
“Depends on his family, I suppose. Wizarding laws about marriage only care about inheritance. Some families list
“Well I thought we could get lunch. At the Three Broomsticks?”
Harry drained the last of his tea and set the mug aside. “A pensieve is cold and flat. And again, you have these same memories. This is more about feeling what I feel. With you.”
“Really? You don’t think this is weird?”
Even if Harry thought this was the hottest thing he’d ever seen. He imagined the pink flush spilling across Draco’s cheeks and throat as he spluttered through a nervous explanation. And then his mind helpfully shifted that into a soft post-orgasmic glow instead. Harry groaned softly as his cock throbbed over that image.
Their Saturday afternoon lull seemed the perfect time to embark on the ‘special plans’ Harry had for them. No need to wait until bedtime, when they might be too tired to
Draco stiffened, wondering why he needed to be singled out, and bounced Annie in his arms. “I think Annie and I are going to sit this one out.”
Harry’s imagining of what it must feel like made his own cock throb in his pants. He knew Draco could feel each breathy exhale on his sensitive skin and was probably remembering Harry’s mouth around him as he played his violin that night. They shared so many memories of pleasure, and yet not enough. Cut short by seventeen days.
Two glasses of wine flanked a large charcuterie board of cheeses, cured meats, olives, grapes, and fresh berries. A sliced baguette curved around several small pots of dips and spreads. Hopefully a box of miniature pastries was hiding somewhere for dessert.
He tried to recall the night he’d asked Draco on a date. He’d been so confused and flustered then. Vaguely he remembered Draco’s odd comment about a betrothal contract but it slipped away in the excitement of their first date. Was Draco just playing with Harry until something real and better came along?
(9:20 am) I actually hate hiking and have absolutely no interest in something challenging.
helped us to get him settled, and explained about your Aunt Andromeda. And that they want to come to dinner after you’ve had a chance to recuperate. Or maybe just him by himself? He wasn’t very clear on that point.”
“Going to pay for that?” he whispered playfully.
? What are you reading?”
Thank fuck. Harry moaned as he gripped Draco’s hips, fucking earnestly at long last. “Is this what you want?” he huffed into the sweaty skin of Draco’s neck. “Just like this? So you can come all over the glass.”
“This is unreal,” Pansy croaked. “What are we doing?”
Without waiting for a reply, Draco dragged Harry across the office and enclosed them in a soundproof bubble.
The older Auror stepped closer. “I’m Auror Blakely, and this is Auror Reed.” He held a scroll through the bars. “We’ve a warrant to check Malfoy Manor and the surrounding grounds for evidence of suspicious werewolf behaviour.”
By nightfall, they were both nearly ready to give up on a return owl from Narcissa and Lucius. Perhaps tomorrow…
Oh Merlin, he must be a touch starved lunatic for nearly melting off his broom when Draco’s chilled hands slid across his belly. And even worse when Draco whispered against his ear, “Mm, you are so warm.”
“No,” Draco moaned. “He
This week he jolted awake when the door opened with a bang. Oh
No matter how tangentially their families existed in the Dark Lord’s service, their families were made to pay. Stints in Azkaban ranged from one to five years for minor crimes. Apparently Draco lucked out with the Saviour as an advocate to secure his home and bank accounts. The rest of them were left without money, or left to the mercy of unsavoury relatives. Nowhere to go for these children that didn’t fit in a Ministry orphanage, especially if they weren’t really orphans.
“What’s this one for?” Harry twisted it around, reading the small label. Then he looked at Draco with ill-concealed teasing. “Sizzle and chill, my darling? I see you’ve taken my modest plans for the evening and raised them a notch.”
Harry sighed and scrubbed his sweaty hair away from his face. “This is about yesterday, isn’t it?”
Harry almost dropped his fork in shock.
“I know she doesn’t mean it like she would have a year ago. Didn’t you say she’s taking muggle classes?”
“Theo,” Draco interrupted before he said anything to spook Jane. “Good timing. I need an aguamenti.”
the theme for today? Bloody hell, this list is
everything. And Harry couldn’t keep up. He liked the quiet life in his cottage, drawing his animals and staring out at his back garden. He just didn’t know how to put it into words until Draco came along and drew it out of him.
“You’re going to be brilliant, Hermione.”
“It’s not. The instructors speak to us as though we’ve never fought for our lives and the Aurors act like we’ve never bothered to learn anything. And mixed in with all of that…” Potter sighed at the ceiling. “On top of it all, I’m the ‘Boy Who Lived.’ And I fucking hate it.”
Harry had planned this date to capture as much of their first date as he could. They started with dinner at a tiny Indian place, still run by the same aged witch with a welcoming smile for everyone.
Harry dug in the basket and found two straws. He handed one to Draco saying, “Using the straw, you have to suck up a marshmallow and move it from one plate to the other.”
“Oh, let’s just -” He turned them so Draco could rest in the spray, and drew him in for a kiss. He tasted soapy and salty, and the odd, flat taste of water which should have no taste at all and yet somehow did.
“Good advice.” Harry leaned in and kissed Draco lightly on the lips. “Good morning to you.”
Over the next few weeks, Daphne disappeared for hours at a time and returned with more and more children. Their stories blended into one common theme.
Of course the back garden had to be as messy as everywhere else. Couldn’t anyone have tidied while Draco showed their ‘guests’ around? Quaffles, gloves, and flying goggles littered the grass, next to abandoned trays of bubble wands and soapy water. Croquet mallets were strewn about with (worryingly) not a single ball in sight. Did children ever actually
“No he didn’t,” Ron scoffed. “It was a terrible gift.”
Harry had the nicest guest room set aside for Lucius and Narcissa in case they decided to come. They hadn’t responded to the invitation, but for Draco’s sake, he hoped that didn’t mean no. Harry unpacked the gift he’d bought for Narcissa and hid it in a drawer in his room. He didn’t unpack too much, grinning at the thought of moving to the honeymoon suite tomorrow with Draco.
Harry couldn’t agree more.
At long last, Harry came in with a beaming smile and sat next to Draco on their sofa. He took Draco’s hand and said, “Did you know that up until entirely too recently homosexual behaviour was thought to be caused by dark magical influences?”
Harry smothered a laugh. Poor Ron wouldn’t know what hit him. This double date suddenly became
“Surely you know by now that muggles aren’t all bad.”
No, not jealousy that drove Harry to such a frenzy of possessive fucking, but a fear of loneliness and abandonment. Draco spent every day thereafter showing Harry there was only one man he wanted.
“Good. It—it was bad for them. Before they came here.”
“Oh I see!” Draco dropped the pitch of his voice. “Does this mean you’re going to suck my blood?”
“Hey Harry,” Hermione said, startling him into nearly dropping the book, as she and Ron sat on the sofa. “Are you
“I didn’t finish. But sometimes I’m having trouble with my charms and all, and I’ll take a break on the loveseat in my workshop and think of you. I like to get myself hard and savour the wanting for a while. I wait for you to finish me off.”
“Malfoy are you all right? You look like you’re going to pass out.”
“Yeah, okay.” Harry glanced at Draco, whose eyes glazed over in bewilderment at the contract. Harry lifted a quill from McGonagall’s desk. “I just sign here?”
With trembling hands, Harry stuck his
“Okay clearly I’m missing something,” Draco said, rising from the table. “And I want to hear more about it because it sounds like fun. But another time because we really should be going.” Harry stuck his tongue out at Ron.
That earned him a bright laugh. “Oh this
(12:24 pm) You can look it up. James Evans.
“I loved spending my day with you,” Harry said softly as Draco extinguished the lights. “I love having you near. I love knowing we’ll spend the rest of our lives together. Sometimes that’s enough.”
He barely had time for a thank you before darting down the stairs, Potter nearly stepping on his heels in his haste to follow. “Over here,” he said, dragging Draco to the side of the building hidden from the street. Draco braced himself with a grimace as Potter pulled him into a tight Apparition.
Draco sighed heavily and left the rest of the children to Pansy and Theo as he stood. He rubbed his face wearily. “As usual, it’s none of your business. But as we are in public and I can’t stop you following us… We’re going out for ice cream to cheer everyone up. We’re attaching the children to the rope so they don’t accidentally let go and wander into traffic. All right? Interrogation over?”
Thirty-one days.
Harry shrugged, a lame attempt at lightening the suddenly somber mood. “Sometimes I think about my parents and… I wonder if I’d still have Molly if I’d had them around. If I hadn’t been so lonely.”
“Harry…” Draco whined.
Ron tapped the parchment where it said
“Oh thank you, Harry,” Draco said softly, taking the small bag of chocolate bars. His smile warmed Harry’s rain-chilled body. “I haven’t had an opportunity to try muggle sweets before.”
with him? Desperate to find solid ground again, Draco reached for the bowl of floo powder. “Well, erm… safe travels.”
“Fuck you,” Draco groaned as he pulled out his wand to ward the door and then unbutton his robes with a spell. “After this we’re going to look for wherever I left my spine.”
Pansy yanked him out of the fireplace. “Thank fuck you’re here. They took Orion!”
“At last, he has risen!” she yelled, making the children around whoop and clap. She checked her watch. “That’s… nineteen hours!”
Draco focused on the deep green of his husband’s eyes, flicked his wand, and said softly, “
The challenge was getting everyone back to the castle after the game, except for the vital members of the scheme. Ron, flush with the excitement of his very own bottle of Gornuk’s collection, suggested alcohol. Kreacher pulled through once again and a bottle of firewhisky waited in the common room with fairy cakes and chocolates to toast the end of school.
(6:10 pm) In great detail.
.” Harry knelt by the shore and asked Draco, “Is there anything you’d like to say?”
A drowsy fog rolled through his head once again as Draco tried to force his eyes open. He yelped when a sharp sting hit his side. “Ow, that fucking hurt, you son of a bitch!”
The spell dropped when he had to blink them away. “Sorry… that was…” He wiped his eyes, feeling a little silly. They hadn’t even made it to their midnight kiss in the memory.
(12:44 pm) This kitten looks like it’s plotting my demise but I’ve redrawn the eyes six times and it still looks the same.
Potter—or maybe he could just be Harry now—kissed the back of Draco’s hand and rested their joined hands on his thigh. “I like that plan.”
Draco started unbuttoning his robe. “Excellent. My favourite prize from my favourite person. Let’s get changed.”
With an eye roll, Draco snatched it away and tossed it onto his trunk next to him. “Thanks,” he said dully.
“Potter will explain. If I don’t get upstairs, I’m going to fall asleep here in the foyer.” He kissed Orion’s head and Pansy’s temple on his way to the wide staircase. “Don’t wake me for any reason. Even if the Manor is on fire.”
Sitting through Malfoy’s new spell seminar felt like an impossible task after Ron’s impeccable timing with a dick-as-wand joke. Each snobbish “No, no, it’s thrust the wand
Without gloves, they only made it twice around the pitch before Draco said, “My hands are cold. Do you mind?” He lifted the hem of Harry’s t-shirt a little.
Fucking
“Here’s to sixty-eight more days of celibacy,” Draco added, scattering his last few petals.
“I mean about the care home.”
Andromeda squeezed his arm. “I could never regret helping you, Harry. And Dora would never forgive me if I failed those children.” She smoothed a hand down her robe. She shot a charm to freshen the fabric and vanish a drool spot on her shoulder. “If we’re short on time, we’d best hurry.”
Draco couldn’t remember ever being so wrapped up in another person’s heat and scent. He buried his other hand in Harry’s silky hair and it was everything he dreamed it would be. Especially when Harry moaned and squeezed Draco’s biceps to pull him in even closer.
could be in the water again.
“Ow,” he half-mumbled, half-snorted. “I think I hit my elbow.” He struggled to his feet. “Draco? My dearest husband? The love of my life? Where are you?”
and sighed in relief when Harry shrugged that suggestion off. Instead he wrote
“Ha!” Harry laughed, pulling out some nipple clamps. “I forgot we had these. I don’t remember them being as much fun as we thought.” He squeezed each of the alligator clips, making them look like puppets talking to each other.
“No idea,” Harry’s voice rumbled at his back. “Usually I’m so good at inserting things in other things.”
Mr Talpin got rid of the Wilsons—with no admonishments for their treatment of Orion—and now Draco and Potter were waiting for the allergy potion to finish taking effect.
“It’s all right,” Draco said, before she could kick up a fuss. “We’ve explained the inspection to the children.”
had Annie whimpering and hugging him tightly again. He kissed the top of her head and rubbed her back. “
“No, it’s fine. I haven’t been there in so long, you know. I haven’t needed it.” Harry looked down at his feet as he opened the door. “I still—if you—if you want to get dinner again, even just as friends… I’d like that.”
“If you say so but I’m going on record as saying it’ll be lame.” Draco threw his dirty robes in the hamper and started the water in the shower.
“Where do we even start from if there’s no ‘start’ line?” Niall grumbled, trying to line the ruler up against Dev’s hard cock. “Simon
? When did this happen?”
“You two are disgusting,” Ron said with a grin. “Twelve days together?”
He hadn’t been inside Harry’s mind this way in years. It had helped occasionally early on when Harry had something important to tell him but grew frustrated with trying to express himself.
For a second it looked like Harry might pull Draco’s body flush against his again, but he paused to take in the words. Good, he needed to listen.
I have to pretend, as I settle in for sleep, that I don’t want the cool weight of his body to keep the fire of my nightmares at bay.
Harry threw the whole lot into the fire and pressed Draco to the floor with a searing kiss. “Do you think we should get one of the toys we kept and play with it now?”
Granger rolled her eyes, while Auror Blakely fairly growled, “You’re on Ministry business, Trainee Potter, and meant to stay in uniform.”
When they’d first started spending their nights together, Draco found it easier to bare his soul in the dark of night in a language Harry couldn’t understand. Love, anxiety, desire, and fear tumbled through him and poured out in desperate words against Harry’s heated skin.
Pansy laid her hand on Harry’s arm and smiled in excitement. “That sounds like fun! What are the tapes like?”
he was looking at. He glanced over his shoulder, as though Draco might hear him thinking and barge in to ruin this mind-blowing moment.
“I keep seeing you fall…” Draco said, frowning at Harry.
(10:44 am) Ha! I could be a serial killer for all you know.
Draco arched his back and sighed against the glass, “For the hundredth time, they never—yes, fuck, just like that—they never swim up this high and even if they did, who cares if they see—Harry,
to be sure it hadn’t done you any harm…”
“Erm,” Draco rubbed his soapy hands together, “You’re going to have to crouch down or something. I can’t reach your hair without getting soap in your eyes or mine. If only there was a convenient ledge we could enlarge like in the shower at home.”
fucking Potter was shopping here too. The girl Weasley was with him, both apparently shopping for new gloves. Right, he’d need to buy protective gear too. Probably a few extra quaffles and snitches as well. Draco frowned at Potter and ignored him in favour of the sales wizard and witch.
(7:30 pm) If you don’t want to text me anymore, I understand.
“But what if… what if there’s nightmares and the kids are so loud and…” He choked back the emotions threatening to overwhelm him.
No actual squid in this fic... :)
“You don’t even have your wand out!” Harry laughed.
. It’s still the most popular of the series.” He smiled at Draco, more excited than he needed to be that Draco wanted to flirt with him.
He cut off when Harry’s lips met his in a kiss far softer than he wanted, but much more appropriate for their audience. Greg wolf whistled and a scattering of applause could be heard somewhere in the distance.
“Okay, thank you Ron! I guess we’ll talk about fanfiction the next time!”
“I love them.” Draco replaced his ring and drew Harry in for a sweet kiss. “And I love you. And it would make me the happiest man on earth to marry you.”
“Do you have plans for Hogsmeade?” Draco asked.
Although it only lasted a few hours, it took several years off Draco’s life. He hardly knew what to say when Ms Coddle shook his hand and said they’d be in touch within ten business days to share the results of the inspection. She specified twice that he shouldn’t worry too much about it.
“Well,” Draco sighed, defeated, “I suppose the children will be happy to see you.”
“I miss you too,” Draco said softly.
Harry yanked Draco to his feet. “I think I know just the thing.”
The noise and bustle of breakfast the next morning with a full castle made Harry long for the quiet of their Easter holiday. The end of term suddenly felt an eternity away. They would never leave this place and Harry would be spending the rest of his days chaperoned by friends and random younger students. He missed Draco, even though he hadn’t even left for class yet.
Andromeda eyed it all with an incredulous shake of her head. “I was long gone from the family by the time your mother met your father,” she said to Draco. “But I well remember the sort of parties and events that were hosted in those circles. And I never would have imagined it would lead to this sort of thing in Malfoy Manor.”
Pansy made a dismissive sound, and then gave Harry a shove when he glanced over his shoulder at the crowded table. “Don’t look, idiot,” Pansy whispered. “She’ll know something’s up.”
“I’ll be back in two hours. Have Orion ready.”
At Draco’s nod, Harry apparated them across town. Harry had been far more nervous about Draco visiting his flat that first time. At the time, Draco thought it was fear of moving too fast as well. But in hindsight, Draco wondered if it was because of how crowded and full Draco’s flat was, compared to Harry’s sparsely decorated flat.
(12:34 pm) It’s ok if you need a minute.
“Erm, no,” Potter said with a smile, “I just wanted to visit. Get to know all of you better.”
“Are you feeling all right?” Draco asked as he set his grocery bags on the worktop. “You seemed off at the shops today.” It was rare that Harry didn’t have something to say about the produce Draco picked, even if only in teasing.
“Oh no,” Harry said, clearly aiming for nonchalance. “I thought we’d take a night off from the list. Especially since I have something special planned for tomorrow.” He waggled his eyebrows with a grin.
As soon as Draco left, promising to return momentarily with discharge papers, Ron pulled Harry in for a hug. “I’m so happy for you! I knew he liked you back!”
Draco stood and nudged her towards the door. “Don’t you worry about anything, Jane. I promised we’d keep you safe and it’s a promise I’ll keep.”
It was
“You don’t even know me.”
Harry licked lightly around the crown to catch the last drops. He blinked his wide green eyes open and sat back on his heels. “Good?”
Draco sauntered forward and tugged on Harry’s belt loops. He nuzzled Harry’s cold cheek and whispered, “Me either. Best idea you’ve had all day.”
Draco groaned, but mostly just for show at this point. Honestly, with an offer like that, who would say no? “Fine! But it better be real tears!”
and Harry sincerely hoped those two idiots followed the trail he and Draco were blazing.
He wondered what Draco was reading and if it would be rude to interrupt him at this point to ask. He looked so adorable, sitting back against the tree. Harry opened his sketchbook to a fresh page and quickly drew a rough outline of Draco, then began filling in tiny details. His brows drawn down in concentration, the pursing of his mouth, the lock of hair dancing in the breeze.
“Mr Potter, it is my pleasure to accept your courtship of my son.” Her eyes met Draco’s but before either of them could say anything, the door to the office opened.
Draco sighed at the closed doors. “Well, and so it begins.”
“We’re gonna laugh at this for
“What the fuck?” Ron whispered as the tension he’d carried eased by at least half.
“Exhausting. I spent the whole day in the lab to make up for leaving early yesterday. I’m exhausted and gross and need a shower before dinner.”
“Easy… I’ll make it cooler.”
“And you supported his story?!”
“Good. It looked like Ron might join me on my way out, but he’s not acting as rashly as he used to. Still, I think he’s as disenchanted as I am with the whole thing and might decide to leave too. Let the Ministry chew on that for a while.”
, you motherfucking
Draco knocked on the door across the hall. When it opened to a white-haired old woman, he smiled. “Good afternoon. We’re looking for the Wilsons that live across the hall there. Do you know where they might be or when they’ll be back?”
Andromeda seconded her words, stressing the way all the children were collected in the first place, off the streets or running away from dangerous care. At the mention of Orion, left in a basket at the Manor gates, Mrs Stokke’s lavender brows drew down in concern.
Draco straightened his tie, and buttoned his suit jacket. He stared at the older wizard with the cold stare he’d learned at his father’s side. “Simple enough. We’ll make the rounds, much as we did when this all began, and pick them all back up, one by one, as they are kicked out once again. Those kids will always have a home with me, guardianships be damned.”
The next morning, he dragged a blanket out to the common room to read the last little bit by the fire. Draco and Theo sat at one of the tables with textbooks open. Ugh, homework on a Sunday was just the worst, Harry thought as he settled in his armchair.
“That’s a lot of brooms,” he said to Draco.
“Nice try, but that’s every
Draco’s small, nervous smile grew into something softer as they shook hands. “Steadfast. At long last.”
Blocking all the water in the process.
a little excited about the snow storm room. And the fake beach. And the salt inhalation thing.”
But not quietly enough because Harry shouted from the bathroom, “I have a thing for Draco!”
He let out a sharp bark of laughter when Harry returned and made a dramatic turn, causing his black cloak—Draco’s silk-lined dress cloak for special occasions only—to flair out widely. Under it he had a crisp black shirt and no tie, along with black trousers. He remained barefoot, which should have made the outfit silly, but because it was
Draco put the cakes in the oven and set a timer. He turned a coy smile on Harry. “Twenty minutes, you say?” He lifted the drippy spatula from the bowl. “Sounds like enough time for a little fun.”
Draco rolled his eyes as the mystery of the missing inventory cleared up. “Will you please stop stealing things from my shop?”
Draco’s kisses began softly, lulling Harry into a gentle fog of desire. As the outside world faded away, the kisses turned hotter and more demanding, setting something uncontrollable loose in Harry. He rocked his hips up hard against Draco, wanting more,
“I would, you know…” Draco set his teacup on the coffee table and scooted closer to Harry, resting a hand on his inner thigh. “I would let you tie me up if it’s something you wanted to try. Or tie you up?”
It should be since this is our first time, but arousal and
“Yes.”
“I think you’ll find that Draco is entirely above board, and providing a welcoming home for the children at Malfoy Manor.”
“That was the first space that felt like my own,” Harry said, looking up at the windows that used to be his. “Grimmauld Place always felt like it belonged to someone else. I’m glad it’s not mine to worry over anymore.”
“That’s what you get for taking forever. Fuck, you look gorgeous.”
“Two months later we were engaged. And then four months later we were married.”
alone.”
“Have you?”
Draco kissed Annie’s cheek and set her down. “I’ll wait. Where’s Orion? Is he doing all right?”
On their last Wednesday night before Narcissa’s return, Harry tried to engage Draco once again in their potential betrothal. “Do you know what to expect with the betrothal contract?”
A sigh of relief escaped Draco as soon as he stepped off the broom onto solid ground. He turned, seeking comfort in the place he always sought comfort. “Harry, that was terrifying,” he laughed as Harry’s arms came around him. “I don’t want to fly anymore.”
show up as yourself to get that from the people I work with daily.”
"I'll take it slowly, gently."
Blaise raised one eyebrow at him. “And just what do you think you can do with all those chastity spells in the way? Only Narcissa or Lucius can remove them.”
“You cheated!” Harry tackled Draco to the floor and blew raspberries against his neck.
“A McNair. We named him Orion when he arrived. He was left on our doorstep in a basket.”
“Your father would be so proud,” Pansy whispered before dissolving into her own giggles. Draco tickled her and gave her cheek a loud, smacking kiss.
“Is that so?” Harry set his toast aside and met Draco’s eyes.
, damn it!
“It’s a list of sexy things to have fun with during the month of October.”
“Draco, my love, you were so fucking gorgeous laughing and dancing and I had no idea how to deal with it. I was in the midst of another bad break up with a friend of Lavender’s and wondering if I even liked women and there you were in these fitted emerald green robes that showed off your endless legs in tight trousers.”
“I see,” Amanda said, darting her glance between Harry and Draco.
He dipped his head down and up Draco’s length, wishing he could actually lick and taste the tantalizing flesh. As his lips nearly reached the crown, Draco moaned, “Right there, Harry. Stop right there. Just like… Oh fuck…”
“This is ridiculous!” Pansy growled. “We cannot live off cheese toasties and crisps anymore!”
A young man pressed a hand to the wall near Draco’s head and leaned in to yell over the music, “You lookin’ for company?”
Imagining such things got him nowhere. Because he was Draco Malfoy, acquitted Death Eater and keeper of twenty-four children. He couldn’t afford any distractions.
Was it the implication that they’d do this again? Or the affectionate use of his last name? Maybe the seductive command in Draco’s voice? Something set Harry rocking against the toy, obscene moans spilling from his lips.
“You like to win,” Harry grinned back, wriggling the last of the tingle from his fingers. “But so do I.” They re-dealt their stockpiles for the next round. “Ready to go again?”
“Thank you, Sherri! You’re a lifesaver!”
“This feels so—is this real?”
They stayed cuddled together until they’d calmed enough to not embarrass themselves. Although Harry might have been content to stay longer if they’d been somewhere more comfortable. He’d wanted Draco for so long, he could hardly believe he had him so pliant and willing in his arms. But he reminded himself that they had time and didn’t need to rush into anything. Harry needed to take small steps towards intimacy after so much neglect in his growing years.
Draco laughed incredulously. “Harry, my sweet innocent… Good pureblood children don’t
“Welcome, Potter. The dining room is right this way…” Draco intoned coolly, inwardly wincing. The children would worry if he couldn’t relax.
