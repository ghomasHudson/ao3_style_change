"Finally, you say the right thing for once." Draco smirked and then he licked his lips, pulling Harry's sweatpants down to his feet and revealing his black briefs and thighs, which were lovely. He pushed up Harry's shirt so he could see his bulge pressing against the cloth. Draco reached forward and massaged it with his hand. "I've always wanted to do this..."
Harry opened the box to find a Christmas ornament. It was gold, painted like a snitch, and had feathers sticking out the sides as if it had wings. There was writing on the front of it.
With a gulp of his own saliva, Draco reached for the bottle and grabbed the cork. It took a few tries for his hands were clammy and sweaty, but he eventually loosened the top. He shakily grabbed the small vial in his pocket and unscrewed the cap. Slowly, Draco raised the poison to the top and attempted to pour it in but his hands were too unstable.
Draco frowned and the daunting realization cut through the alcohol. He'd never get to tell Harry he loved him.
"No idea to be honest with you," Draco responded sounding depressed compared to Harry's happy tone. The squiggles were strange, nothing making a prominent design.
"Oh please," Hermione giggled," They would kill each other the minute they found out what was going on."
“Pfft… you don’t even know what I’m talking about.” Draco rolled his eyes. His lips were red and swollen, his eyes glassy as if he was in a trance- almost drunk. Harry looked the same, and had a glimmer in his iris saying ‘I’ve just had the best make out session in my life.’
Snape rearranged his classroom around, assigning seats so that Harry and Draco were furthest away, and unable to even look at each other without it being obvious.
"Nothing specific, really. Just hints of things that might lead to clues for things later on. Dumbledore is... you know. Dumbledore. I'm sure that it'll lead to something." Harry stared at the lake. "He came from an orphanage, too. Tom Riddle. It's really... unsettling finding out things that we have in common. He was really dark when he was eleven."
"No. Like, maybe we could sneak out down the corridor or something so we could still hear the music, but no one would be around."
"I don't think he would, but the problem, I figured as they went inside, is that he and Weaslette spend so much more time together than you two do. Quidditch as well." Blaise took a breath. "I don't want to scare you or anything, worry you more than you need to. But I think this is good. He'll have someone to fall back on once... you know."
Harry gave a dry laugh. “As for your mother, I’m inviting her no matter what, so either she walks you down the isle, or she’s sitting on my side.”
"You-- b-but you didn't-- you didn't... you weren't around Voldemort," Harry stuttered and his face went pale at the thought of Draco being within a one-hundred meter radius of the awful being.
Harry continued getting into Malfoy's face, like it was going to do anything. Malfoy just smirked. "You're a monster! You're a fraud. You're a manipulator—"
"Well," he laughed an arrogant laugh, "if you do recall at our first... wonderful detention together, I did promise the both of you I would find out what was going on between you two. And I concluded you two don't hate each other. Care to speak?"
Draco had to break their bond. If he broke it, that gray bit would go away and Harry would be safe. But then he realized, maybe that gray bit was why the Dark Lord could control Harry's dreams...
"He's a Death Eater, Harry! Let him burn," Ron said, completely unaware of the conversation they just had. "He's worthless."
Maybe Potter broke something. That's it. The sandwich was definitely poisoned. There was no other logical explanation.
Draco looked up at Harry, his lips blue. “Brilliant,” was all he said and the pair made their way, slowly but coldly, to the dock. Their skin had dried, making their clothing ridiculously unbearable. They were heavy and every time they walked it sloshed against their bodies making each step horrible. At first they locked arms so they could try and get heat off of each other, but Draco had better ideas.
He looked up to meet Harry's gaze. Draco immediately turned to anger, but then eased a small amount, looking as though he was confused, then turned his face in disgust.
“Says you. I feel like you’re going to be more traumatized than I am,” Harry barely laughed. Draco just choked, another round of tears flowing as he nodded his head and diving into Harry’s shoulder. “Hey, look at me,” the man said softly.
"When Draco did your detention after we were caught by the DA. I thought he was going to hurt you," Hermione said. "I thought that you were friends at first, and I wasn't sure that Malfoy was genuine. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to intrude or find out that way. Now I get why you didn't want to tell us. But I accept you, I'll always accept you. So long as Malfoy takes care of you."
After a while, he spoke, "It's just on this loop in my head. Over and over. Him falling into the veil, Voldemort and Dumbledore dueling. Voldemort possessing me."
"Yes, well, we'll all hope for the best, then. I'd be happy to speak at your trial in your defense."
"It doesn't have to be good." He stood next to one of the two easels that were across from each other. "It just has to be fun."
Harry felt the door open behind him. Pansy helped him up and sat him on Draco's bed, for he was so shaky he couldn't even properly walk.
Draco just moaned, and Harry propped himself high enough so he could see Draco's face. He was crying, in fact almost bawling. His hormones taking over, Harry's hips sped, and he was pounding into him, legs shaking. They smelled of sweat, and could only hear each other moan and the slapping of their skin.
Draco cupped Harry’s cheek, “I love you,” he said firmly, then he smashed their lips together: the same fire, the same spark, and the same love.
Following going to funerals in the previous chapter, Harry has constant panic attacks which he takes calming draught for. He additionally has screaming nightmares that give him suicidal ideation.
She took a deep breath, and they continued up the stairs. Draco had to keep his distance though whenever anyone walked by. After looking over their shoulders, they arrived at the Fat Lady's portrait.
"What do you see now?" Draco's curiosity activated as he rested his chin on his shoulder. He ignored the burn on his arm, which, for some reason, wasn't too awful.
And maybe his brain didn't let him think about Harry because Harry now gave him more fear than peace.
"Hmm that's difficult," Draco finished his food and placed it in the basket as well as Harry. He tapped it with his wand and sent it away, Harry did, before laying down, his head next to Draco's thigh. "Probably truth because you don't know if someone it loyal or not if you don't know the truth."
He spoke softly. "Harry, it's me. And I could never... ever even think about doing anything to you that would make you uncomfortable. And I know that's the same for me. That's why I let us have sex the night of the ball. I knew you wouldn't hurt me. I knew you could never. I trust you. I need you to trust me, too."
And finally, Harry was only crying, his back jolting back and forth uncontrollably. Draco sat back against the wall, it's cool touch making him wish that he wasn't arse naked, and he pulled Harry back into his lap. But as he did so, Harry started screaming. This time, no words came out, just long strings of his voice being ripped to shreds.
Quickly, he checked it to make sure it wasn't bleeding, and the sound of rustling behind him made him bring his sleeve back down and button it quickly with shaking fingers.
When Draco walked up to her, he felt sick, and he wore a frown. Pansy had to push him slightly. "Astoria," he said, well, barely said. "May I t-talk to you? Alone."
"We are going to learn how to make out if it kills me." Draco shoved Harry on his back and then crossed his arms. Harry was cackling and clutched his stomach as he lay in the grass. "Surely you can beat a Dark Lord at one-year-old, kill a damned basilisk at twelve, but the second someone starts to shove their tongue down your throat, you go into a giggle fit."
"Not at all," Molly said. "Of course we're going to be upset about it. But you lost them, too, Harry. I'm sorry we couldn't be there for them either. And I'll always be heartbroken about Fred. Always. There's no greater pain. But tip-toeing around it only makes it worse. We're all in so much pain because we loved him so much. Grief is love with nowhere to go, as they say. We're lucky to feel this pain because Fred meant so much to us. All of them did."
by the Malfoy's, specifically Lucius. And Harry wanted to raise the question to it, but realized if it was the other way around, or Malfoy asking about the Dursley's, Harry would feel uncomfortable. They were only on the first date, after all. It's not like they necessarily trusted each other.
She led him deep into the room, a place Harry recognized and wanted to leave. Eventually he had to stop avoiding it, so he just kept going with it.
Harry covered his mouth as tears rolled down his face. "I don't want to go." He staggered backwards to the wall and slid down it. And then he sobbed. "Please don't make me—I don't want to die. I-I'm sorry."
The snitch flew around the stadium twice before swooping into it, low to the ground. They both dove close to each other, but Harry knocked Draco out of the way before grabbing the snitch.
"Oh, erm—" Draco started, but Molly had already poured him a glass of water. "Thank you," he repeated as she placed the glass in front of him. He took a sip to be kind.
A cloud of dust went throughout the kitchen and both boys had to clear their eyes before they could see again. Draco took one peer at Harry who now had white hair and pale skin before he started cracking up. "You look like you're blond!"
"Don't lie. I like you because you challenge me. I like you because you can be funny when you want to, and not in a mean way. I like you because we have chemistry. Kissing you felt nice. None of that will ever outweigh you calling my friends Mudbloods and Blood-Traitors. Thinking that about anyone that way."
Harry waited a bit until he came out from under the bed, and Draco had his eyes closed. He looked like an angel, Harry concluded. An angel that he was so luck to have alive and so stupid to lose. He took off his invisibility cloak and put it to the ground next to him. He kneeled next to him and grabbed his hand and kissed the top of it.
Harry snorted. "Yes, in the one month until I turn sixteen, I will definitely mature to your near unreachable level of wisdom."
"It's okay." He buried his hand into Harry's hair, playing with its softness, stroking it as Harry got lower and lower, going down to his hips. Then, he went over the other side of his body to the other scar and kissed up it, stopping where the two scars crossed over his heart.
"I'm aware of the function of a lawyer," Kingsley started, but a booming voice came from the other side of the room.
“Yes, Harry, we get that,” Ron rolled his eyes, “I think the entire Wizarding world gets that you’re in love with the bloke.”
"How you know? Do you even talk to Theo, or do you just suck each other's faces until you're numb and then walk away? It's not like you like each other."
Harry gave up arguing with her and uncrumpled the note.He scanned it at first but then reread it two more times. Hermione had a smirk plastered on her face as Harry's eyes lit up, but he tried to hide it.
"Okay, so. I Draco Malfoy, take you Harry Potter, unfortunately, to be my wedded husband," he sniffed, feeling his throat close, "To be not only my love but also my best friend. I will trust you and be there for you until my dying day. I will hold you every time you have a nightmare. I promise to correct you every time you tell the time wrong, and I promise to only call you an ignoramus only when your inerudite recuperation skills are that of an ignoramus."
"Just a bit," Draco scrunched his nose and stroked the hair behind his ear. "Enough to work. It's not like I made him cry."
"Draco saved my life multiple times in the war," Harry held firm. "We've been together since we were fourteen, before Tom Riddle even returned. I assure you, he was forced to get the Dark Mark to protect me, and like Snape, his allegiance was on our side. He saved my life several times. He doesn't deserve Azkaban, and he never has."
"You're not," Draco blinked and tears came out of his eyes. "You're so bloody strong, Harry. So strong," his voice quivering.
"It's important to lie on your left side. It's better for your intestines that way. I should spoon you from the back."
Draco moved to Harry's stomach and looked at it as if it was fresh meat. "I only wanted to pies to make Weasley a laughing stalk to get my mind off of you, but instead I get underneath them." Draco took his tongue and dragged it all along Harry's stomach, tickling him with his taste buds. "I wanted to take you right then and there, but I wanted to be classy and go have a wank in my room, pretending it was you, but then you put it down there," Draco bit so hard, Harry was almost scared rather than not.
Draco let out a laugh, "I didn't. I played it off well until he found out it was all just a game and, that night really didn't end well."
"A stupid voice can't either." Harry equaled him. A silence passed. "Do you think we'll ever be boring?"
Harry squeezed him tight, and Draco kissed his cheek. Then Harry reached up and met his lips, enjoying a sweet, loving kiss. "Thank you. I-I dunno what to do for you in return."
Draco hugged him tight, though he himself had racing thoughts. What is going to happen now? They were completely at risk—Draco was screwed. They both were. "There's nothing wrong with you. It's not your fault."
"I can't help it," Draco put his head in his hands for just a bit before lifting up again and going for a new roll of parchment.
"I know. I forgot to get new ones. I didn't realize how much I grew. And it's not like I'm going to wear my regular clothes."
"Harry! Wake up!" Draco grabbed his hand and tried to pinch his wrist, but that didn't work either. Then he kissed his hand as Harry cried. "Please wake up!"
Harry didn't go to the Hospital Wing. Instead, he walked with his head low and arms crossed over his chest to the Gryffindor showers, cleaning the blood off his face, and only under the spray did he let out the only tear he would waste on Malfoy.
"I missed you too, Harry. So much. I wanted to be there for you before the task, wanted to wish you luck."
Harry picked him up and set him onto the cool tile, drops of water from their body’s covering the floor around him as Draco leaned back against a support beam, spreading his legs for his lover.
"She'd better not," Draco looked down at Harry and reached for another hug. Within seconds, there was a cough coming from the hallway. "Mr. Potter."
"Really, that lame? Thought you had it in you," Harry faked a yawn, "Guess I was wrong considering I've going more that a couple weeks at a time without even talking to you. I'm sure kissing would be a piece of treacle tart," Harry joked.
"You are such a pest—mph—" Harry leaned back and captured his lips, and he arched his back against him. Draco automatically relaxed into it and put his fingers under the hem of his hoodie, but then he knew what he had to do. "Harry..."
"You're such a pain in the arse," Draco exclaimed, dropping Harry's hand, which, it's not like he noticed, for he was clutching his stomach and trying to maintain his balance. Picking Harry up and draping him over his shoulder, Draco carried him deeper into the field, a place he missed too much. With hearing the sound that made his heart rush, it being Harry's laugh, he slung him back over, and held him like a bride, letting his feet hit the floor, and he dipped him towards the ground, kissing him enough for his head to spin.
"Does it matter?" Draco furrowed his eyebrow. Harry, offended, completely forgot Draco forgot, again. His heart wasn't with the situation, and it was too cold to change its mind.
Harry felt the door open behind him. Pansy helped him up and sat him on Draco's bed, for he was so shaky he couldn't even properly walk.
They were clean, his eyes, as if they had been washed by a million tears. The green had so many dimensions, from a bluish yellow closest to the pupil, a forest in the middle, and almost a brown on the outer ring. They were beautiful, Draco concluded.
"Without all of them. It's been so strange. But without the madness, it's so quiet. I don't know which is worse."
Harry moved to the middle of his chest, except instead of a hand, two fingers found themselves on the start of Draco's scars. "T-This was the worst d-day of my life," he choked. "I'm so sorry."
Draco turned to him and met his gaze. What the hell is going on? It’s a dream. It has to be a dream. No. A nightmare. Most definitely a nightmare, kissing his savior ex-boyfriend in front of his Death Eater… co-workers?
Draco smirked and nodded at him. They rushed to the stairs and climbed over one of the landings onto the rocks by the viaduct.
He hated this. He hated everything. He hated Astoria. He hated Voldemort. He hated the Dark Mark. He hated his father. He hated his mother. He hated Snape. He hated Dumbledore. He hated Yaxley. He hated Bellatrix. He hated Katie Bell. He hated Ron Weasley. He hated Slughorn. He hated Blaise. He hated Pansy. But he especially, absolutely, surely, most definitely, certainly, confidently, unthinkably fucking hated Harry Potter.
"It was a living manifestation of hell. It felt as though someone had torn me to shreds, and I knew I had to get out of there before I went ballistic, and I really did," Draco remembered, "Hours later he found me."
"Here," Draco winked at Harry and turned to them and lowered his collar to show them. It had faded a bit. "But that one was from last week."
And of course, Draco didn’t want to let Harry know he could sense when he was there with his arm; that was a tool he couldn’t let go of.
"I love those socks." Harry gave a laugh, though it wasn't one completely filled with joy. "I think that's why I get so nervous about being bad. Before I found out that Voldemort could be in my head. I get that I'm good. But sometimes I've wanted to... lash out. But then I remember if I do, then I'll make someone feel like how I do and I never want to make someone feel like that. That's why the Quidditch match was so awful to me."
"She has black hair that goes down to her... breasts," Draco tried not to cringe at the term breasts. "Green eyes that are... Merlin, incredible, and she's short, but muscular."
Ron came downstairs wearing pajamas, his hair sticking up in different places as he yawned. And then he saw Arthur grab the banana. He then threw his head back in laughter and turned the corner to the kitchen.
"I'm only one of the best seekers in the school who has so happened to beat you every official match we've played against each other. You'd be lucky to get some pointers from me." Harry cocked his head. "This is an opportunity people would die for."
"You can copy off of mine, although I don't think it would matter. Pumblechook always fails us anyway."
It wasn't long before he heard footsteps coming up the stairs and a big bushy haired girl walked in looking in need of a rest.
Ginny walked up to him. She was getting on his nerves, annoying, and well, too flirty and girly, and fruity for his tastes.
"Now that I'm not planning a murder, I actually have a lot of time on my hands. But I avoid all the Death Eaters as much as possible. I read a lot. What else can you do?"
"A very drunk Auror who passed out at the Three Broomsticks." Ron tossed them a bag. "Snuck these. A ministry uniform."
Why was Draco dancing on glass? Why ask to take it slow and not love him as hard as he could in the time they had?
"Harry, you do still realize that's my son, right. I still see him as my little boy," he could hear Narcissa speaking softly as she leant on the doorframe.
"I think he has a Type B memory loss, meaning the memories are still there but he just can't recall them."
"You should give Hermione the condom that Blaise and Pansy gave you, since we never used it," Harry joked.
Some time later, he was released from detention and began his walk to the Gryffindor Common Room, and just as he stood before the Fat Lady's portrait, whom was sleeping, he felt a body pressed tight to his and a smell that he instantly recognized.
How could he have been so foolish, so stupid, telling Harry he wanted to forget him? Yeah they had been fighting, but so had every single couple there ever was. He didn’t even know how he even spat that sentence out of his mouth. They had such a happy marriage. Everyone, even the papers, call them the ‘forever honeymooners,’ since they were so in love, so happily, deeply in love.
Even if Malfoy's feelings were true, which was doubted, they could never get together. He couldn't even see the teenager get romantic at all. it would be like kissing cardboard... BLEH kissing Malfoy, Gross!
"Would you just fucking go away! I am so fucking sick of you haunting me, being around every fucking corner like this fucking puppy! I'm so sick of you driving me mad." Draco's eyes welled as he stood and ran for the door, slamming it open.
The next one was of them laughing, which was Draco's favorite. He never knew he could smile like that. The third was a photo of Harry kissing him on the cheek while he was smiling and looking in the direction of him. The fourth was of them looking at each other in the eye in an eternal bliss. If you could sum up 'perfect' in one photo, that would be the one to use. The final one was of Harry kissing Draco, both their eyes closed, passion in the crease of their eyebrows.
First he went to robe shop and got dress robes from the event, along with Ron who was the happiest person in the world since he didn't have to wear his Great Aunt's.
Draco threw Harry by hanging onto his hand, following the dance, as Harry raveled back into him, his back ending up resting against his chest while Draco lowered his mouth next to his ear, using his snotty, intimidating nature. "Dazzle me, Potter."
"You're a death eater," she yelled as a single tear stroked her cheek and her face went as pale as death. "You're a death eater!"
"So because I'm getting treatment in the Wizarding World, weight restoration is a few months. If I keep going the way I'm going, I should be able to play Quidditch in a month or two, too. The bulking potions help. But in terms of replacing the coping mechanism of starving myself with something else, it's going to be awhile. I have a list, but making those habits muscle memory while also fighting Umbitch... there's no timeline for that. It's a lifelong thing.
"The Kline case? That's Doug Kline! Harry, he's the son of a death eater! The second I found out he was in the same class as Lily, I freaked! And Lily supposedly hated him too!"
"Damn right I am." He wrapped his arm around him and kissed Harry's forehead, but then he remembered Granger and Weasley were there. It was just so
He didn't open it. He didn't even know if he wanted to go. The future was on his horizon, and by his horizon, he means tomorrow. He'd just have to see, but for now all he could do was think about the day approaching too slowly, yet too quickly.
Harry turned back around and untied his shoe lace. As he began pulling it off, Draco whimpered, and Harry pulled back his pant leg.
'Yeah, she physically abused your boyfriend in front of your face and tortured him for months on end, that's why,' Harry thought to himself.
"I don't want to hear it! Both of you have detention in my office December 26th at 7 a.m. and 50 points will be taken from both your houses. Now off to the hospital wing, the two of you! Now!" And she waited for them to leave.
Draco watched Potter, and he how pale his skin was. The poor kid was probably horrified, but damn did his hair look good in the wind.
"Has she ever kissed you like that," Harry asked, almost desperate for any answer, moving along his jaw. Draco didn't answer, but if he would have, it would have been a no. "You hate the color yellow," Harry kissed downward, "and y-you get jealous so easily and you talk in your sleep-" Harry kissed his neck and he felt his throat close. "Not like creepy talking, but like a word or two." Harry sucked on Draco's skin and felt him squirm at his special spot. "And you hate hickeys," Harry almost sobbed, tears stinging the back of his eyes but not yet falling.
"Harry--" Draco interrupted, but he was glad Harry ignored him because he didn't have an excuse for 'everything.'
"No, Harry! Leave him some space. For Gods sake, he's been in Askaban for 3 months, and if he really did forget you, imagine your enemy standing up for you in front of the entire Wizengamot. It's probably over whelming!"
“Don’t worry,” She smiled, not a nice smilelike Harry would of, but a crooked one, as if she sabotaged it herself and took pride in it, “I’ll be much better than that slut.” She kissed his cheek, which also stung. He then braced himself for what he was about to do. ‘For Harry,’ he thought to himself.
They both reluctantly gave them up and started scribbling on their parchment. Harry wouldn't meet Draco's eyes, but he could feel him looking up time to time.
Draco couldn't help it, he just broke down, laying across the staircase his head on his forearms. He knew in his heart Harry might now survive and little did he know soon enough he'd find out.
If the two were to run into each other in the hallway, Draco would not only stare him down more hateful than and angel to a demon, but physically abuse him such as shoving him against the wall so hard Harry heard a bone crack, or punching him so forcefully Harry would find himself knocked out for hours. The blonde brat would spew the meanest statements that he knew that would sting him hard, calling him a mudblood lover, torturing him about his family's death, along with Sirius's, finally screaming 'I hate you' before walking away, no turning back.
"Fuck off, Harry. I don't want to see you here again. I mean it. Leave. There's no reason for you to cast this spell. There's no reason for you to be around me."
Protecting Harry gave all of what he was doing meaning. He couldn't get out of bed without the thought of him being able to protect Harry.
"What makes you sure it won't be you, Weasley," Pansy smirked as Draco stood, getting into position as he sat at one end of the table, near Neville, Dean, and Seamus. Ron sat down on the opposite end, floating the chessboard over with his wand.
"Draco," Harry shouted, but they were seperated by the flames. The boy started to run towards him, but Ron held him back and pulled him away from it all.
"You don't get it," she snapped up at them. "My parents are disowning me when I turn eighteen next week."
"Then you'll get Harry," the Gryffindor said, lowering his voice a bit. "Stop making it complicated."
"Until Hagrid knocked down our door, literally, and took me to Hogwarts. Then I got his second bedroom. That's why I love Hagrid so much. Anyway, after that...well, I had magic. It was mostly neglect, and they left me alone a bit. I ran away when I was thirteen. They put bars on my window before second year. Tried to keep me from coming back to Hogwarts."
The next one was of them laughing, and it was incredible. Draco didn't even know he knew how to smile anymore. But with Harry, he just looked so happy.
But Draco couldn't help it. These were people who Draco knew didn't like him. And more importantly, they were Harry's friends. And when Draco said
"I've never gotten drunk, I swear!" Despite his truth, Draco blushed. "I have gotten tipsy, but that was when I was thirteen and someone poured me champagne when I thought it was grape juice."
Draco did his best to get out of bed as well, but his own muscles twisted and burned. He put his feet on the floor next to Harry and slowly lifted himself, despite his shaking legs. He extended his arm for Harry to take, which he did, but as they went to pull him up, Harry went loose, cackling in laughter at the sight of Draco's body.
"We don't know. They're trying the counter curse to protrificus totalus but this spell is much more powerful."
“Where we had our real first kiss, or should I say when you kissed me for the first time,” Harry smiled.
Draco gave a look of confusion towards Harry before completely blanking out and letting his eyes roll to the back of his head, and falling to the ground.
He didn't have the time to say hi to Harry (a.k.a. sneer) at breakfast because he didn't go to breakfast. Instead, he stayed in the Room of Requirement until the bell rang, leaving with strained eyes and magic exhausted.
and he thinks that after my long week of research and teaching and mentoring, that I don't do anything and I have to do all the chores. It's what we always do, whoever cooks doesn't have to clean. He's so bloody
"Always worked for me," Draco said cheekily, kissing his forehead. He tried to pull away from his embrace, however Harry held him tighter.
Ron saw the act of loving. The two were chastely blissful together, and he didn't want to ruin that. The Weasley had too big of a heart. He could see the love in their eyes, almost as if the couple were a work of art; so much pain, such a story, but still beautiful. He wouldn't admit it out loud, but he was staring at pure love in the flesh. "Hurt him again, I'll kill you, married or not... but if Harry's happy, so am I," he said after a deep breath. "Congratulations."
"That's it? The love of your life is right here in front of you and all I get is cute?" He said it light heartedly.
Draco raised an eyebrow, a sudden fear taking over his stomach. There could be aurors looking for him. He was a criminal. But maybe they just wanted to rest right now. Maybe he'd only have a few days with Harry. Best to make the most of it. "Are there wards?"
Harry took his hand once more, leading him to the unstable pile of rocks. The Slytherin began to climb when Harry held him back. Instead he climbed forward instead and got a firm grip, asking Draco for his hand.
"Of course! Only if I play Weasley," Draco demanded. Weasley stared at him wide-eyed. "As I recall, you aren't an owl, Weasley, yes I did say you. Harry tells me you're quite the chess player. I want my go at you."
"We sort of played it by ear, you could say. Since we didn't have any experience, we had to say what was on our mind. He told me he loved me nine months in because that's what he felt and thankfully, I felt that too. But I couldn't say it back. I don't know why. As far as kissing goes... well what's the harm in that? We didn't have limits, but of course we read each other very well. I knew when he was uncomfortable. We never went all the way. We were close but never actually did it, and that was because of my horrid, stupid Mark. I wanted to though, we both did."
"Oh come on," Draco put his hands on Harry's shoulders, shaking him, "surely the notorious Boy-Who-Lived-Twice has a girlfriend!" Harry glared at him, bathing in the incredulous irony that was secretly happening right before everyone's eyes to their own ignorance.
And they spent their time there, for a while, huddled together in their equal love for Harry, mourning what they could, before Ron reminded them of the stakes.
"Pretty much the case constantly.  Where is the Chamber of Secrets, anyway," Draco readjusted himself to look in his eyes while Harry subconsciously looked at the sinks to the left of them. As he opened his mouth, an idea popped into his head, and with drawled.
Ginny broke down laughing, putting a hand on his shoulder as Harry snorted. Don't touch my fucking boyfriend. "If you ever go on a date with her, I will never speak to you again."
“He would start saying things we used to say to each other, he would just freak out and start shaking and there was nothing I could do to stop him. I would just sit there and watch myself hurt him. And then when it was all too much he would go unconscious.” Draco kissed his shoulder as a few tears slipped his eyes. He will never forgive himself for doing that to Harry, ever.
And then, suddenly, Draco was pulled underwater, a sharp pain on his leg. He immediately kicked and shouted, looking down to find a Grindylow had sunk its teeth into Draco's calf. Harry ducked under and grabbed his wand, which was tucked in his briefs.
"Ha," Harry responded, "I can never sleep before the first game of the season. Don't worry, I've got enough adrenaline in me to last four matches."
Harry bit his lip and a few tears cascaded along his hot face. He shook his head, then nodded, and then cried into Draco’s embrace, his body shaking and bobbing to his sobs. Draco had to admit, hearing his weeping broke his heart a little bit… or possibly a lot. Again, he could have lost Harry. And in this specific moment, he was contemplating whether or not losing Harry was his greatest fear or not.
"Merlin, you're wearing my clothes," Draco put his forehead up against Harry's stomach, and the hand at Harry's throat softened and he dragged his nails along the skin of his chest and stomach. Harry's back arched to it. He reached down and grabbed Draco by the collar of his shirt, and pulled him up so that their faces brushed against each other.
"I'm not one hundred percent sure but I have a theory. While Draco was at Askaban he was in one of the top security cells. That means that he was being circled by up to 50 dementors all the time. Harry remember when you told us that Draco never smiled before until you and him were together?"
To be honest, his expectations of Draco not even showing up were disappointed since a figure walked his way. He too had a broom in his hand, and Harry's heart skipped a beat when he saw the pair.
But when a scream screamed loud enough to silence the whole stadium, Draco's believes were validated. It wasn't just two victors, no, but one screaming victor laying over a dead body. Draco's blood ran cold.
"I don't want me to go anywhere either, except, well, maybe I want to go back in the shower because I'm freezing."
Draco smiled and uncontrollable elation sweeping over him. He laughed and wiped a tear from his eye, and held onto the grass for quite some time, thinking,
"I learned Occlumency, unlike you, but if he suspects anything, that won't matter. If he tortures me, that won't matter. You shouldn't be here, you shouldn't even know that the diary exists. I gave Granger specific instructions to wait until after the war."
Harry winced. "Is that in any way healthy? Is that what you're supposed to do to your boyfriend when he makes you angry?"
"You didn't let me finish! I was going to say 'he was prepared to die rather than be with her and not you. He wanted to fight and told us that he was going to find a way to get himself killed because he couldn't deal with the pain you were giving him."
"Why don't any of you care? W-Why are you all just fucking around all the time—why aren't you suffering like me? You're all supposed to be suffering—a-and then we're supposed to be happy we're suffering because other people's lives are better—w-why can't you just..."
Maybe he could do this without Plan Damage Beyond Repair. Maybe Harry would just leave him alone and Draco could murder Dumbledore and then die without Voldemort knowing they were soulmates. And yeah, it would hurt Harry like a bitch, but at least Draco wouldn’t be responsible for Harry’s death—and maybe Harry would win!
And there was one thing Draco was absolutely positive about. Harry felt right. There was never a doubt that they belonged together in their purest form. The difference between their purest form and the rest of the world was the war. The Dark Lord who made his family cold and cruel and took Harry's family away. He wondered if he'd ever get along with Harry's parents if they were alive.
Draco nodded. "I faked it. I faked it because I was a coincided, two-faced bastard and to admit it out loud, I had a big giant crush on him before we even started it all." He flattened his mouth. "Of course, I didn't know that then. Funny how you can mix up love and hate so easily, huh?"
"This is why you didn't want to marry me," she shrieked. "Because you're hooking up with the bloody Chosen One!"
"It's not a big deal, it's really not," Draco's voice went higher than normal. Potter only squeezed him harder, and Draco wanted to push him away, insult him, yell at him. How dare he get so close to him? How dare Draco allow it, give him this information?
Lupin blinked, trying not to give a big reaction, but it wasn't his fault that Harry blurted it out. It wasn't what he expected to hear. "Ah, I imagine you've gone through some tough self-discovery. Finding out you're gay when there are muggle prejudices, as with your family I'm sure, out there, it can be difficult."
"I didn't go back to Hogwarts and Draco did. We were hunting horcruxes, which that's something you'll learn about during our unit, Lily." Harry had stopped crying, but he knew that wasn't the last time he would let his tears spill. It was such a tragic story. "And I hated him at the time, and basically every day he wrote me a letter that I refused to open each and every day. I remember being so angry about it. I didn't open them until what would have been our 3-year anniversary, which I initially regret."
Harry spent most of his break in guilt, trying to push out the memory of his kiss with Cho. However, when Arthur Weasley came to Grimmauld Place, he let himself feel the relief that he was okay. At least his dreams and visions gave him one good thing: saving Ron's dad. Still, he worried about Draco, and thought of him most of the time.
Harry nodded, and Draco found a robe for the each of them, which was embroidered with the same lettering as on the gate outside.
"You think he did that because he's a Death Eater or because you think he wasn't really into you," she asked out of curiosity, but she mentally scolded herself for being so intrusive.
The day started off horribly bright and early. After sleeping in late, he missed his friends going down to the Great Hall, leaving him to sloppily do his tie, alone, and walk to breakfast, alone. He made a mental note to remember the next time he wasn't with his friends to never come at all, because what greeted him just before entrance made him want to throw up.
He hoped Snape hated the latter enough today so they would be paired together, but when he arrived, notes were drawn on a blackboard, just waiting eagerly to be copied.
"You're welcome, Harry," he whispered back with a blush. Harry looked at the diary a little bit longer, the cursive, the ink, the pages, before closing and putting it next to the drunk hot chocolate. "Make sure you read it from start to finish chronological. The ending won't make sense. Promise," Draco stuck out his pinky.
“Harry,” he cried, “It’s not real!” Although he was speaking shakily and was trembling violently, Harry had a hard time believing it was fake. He searched for his wand before Draco grabbed onto his hand. “Don’t you dare try and undo it,” Draco howled.
But as Harry thought they'd take a break, Draco wrapped an arm around his neck and kissed him. And he wouldn't stop kissing him. He bit his lip and sucked on it, dragged his tongue against Harry's, and Harry moaned because it was just so intense, so loving.
"Oh," Draco finally blinked away from them, looking off into the dark water. "Are you sure you want to go in there?"
Harry shut the book and gently put it on the floor next to him, as well as took off his glasses and set them down next to the pages. He then examined the sleeping Draco. His face was highlighted in the firelight and his features were so calm. The man before him is so valuable, so precious.
He spent the next hour trying to figure out how he'd get away with having sex with Harry. If the Dark Lord ever knew... If Harry ever saw his mark...
He pushed hair back behind Harry's ear as their breathing steadied. They rested, looking into each other's eyes.
His entire life revolved around Voldemort. His guardians and his friends and his lover. He lived in a puppet show.
Draco kissed him harder, and decided to bite his lip enough to make Harry cry out. He wrapped his arms around Draco's neck as if he was his only anchor to keep from falling. Holding his hips hard enough to bruise, Draco kissed his neck and Harry threw his head back. Harry loves it when I touch his skin. I love it when he moans.
"Okay," Harry looked up to him with loving eyes before kissing his nose, leaving Draco with a small smile. Draco pulled him into a tight hug, Harry's skull under his chin. They stood there for a bit and Harry could have fallen asleep right then and there but Draco let go, holding his hand and leading him to the bed.
"How else would it be? I haven't done anything wrong." Then Draco's tone changed. "What did you promise him?"
"No, it was good. You've never done it before. You can't be mad at yourself. How are you supposed to get it right on the first try? How are you supposed to know how to do something you've never done before? No one does," Harry said encouragingly. "It took me months of lessons with Lupin. It's really advanced. You'll get it."
Harry smiled, ate, and took an extra calming draught before he met him in the locker room wearing his Quidditch Uniform with his broom in his hand.
"Off," Draco untwisted their arms. He stood up and grabbed Harry by his hand to bring him up as well. Draco opened his mouth to speak but Harry lunged at him, and hugged him. And it just made Draco feel so nice and warm and safe and everything was so wonderful and maybe, just maybe, Draco could start drifting away from him tomorrow, he could start his plan tomorrow, because, damn it, he needed this.
Harry kissed his cheek, and moved his hips backwards a bit, and the burn came back, however bearable. He moved cautiously a few times, and then they set a faster rhythm, and Harry pressed feather kisses along his neck.
Andromeda arrived a few hours later with a bundle in her arms. Harry was resting after reading the diary twice.
"What color coffin would you like? I'm sure I can get you and your parents matching ones." Snape's voice lacked any sympathy. "You're a soldier now. You don't get wants. It's the best for both of you. If the Dark Lord knows, and trust me, he will know eventually. He senses there's something different about you, you think you won't be the first on the slaughtering block? And if you do live, you think that you'll be able to keep Potter from dying? He will use you."
"He's gay," Ron said as if it was any other comment in the world. It was quiet for a bit as the rest of them stared at each other. Draco, to the boys' ignorance, took Harry's hand and squeezed it, stroking it. Hermione and Ron could see it from their view and their stomachs grew warm when he gripped back.
Harry gave an encouraging smile as Draco undid the string, his sweatpants loosening. Draco pulled on them, and as he did so, Harry said, "Please just don't bite me."
Harry was lying on the floor in the drawing room next to the fireplace, which was unlit. He stared up at the ceiling, his eyes watery.
He finally admits to having an eating disorder and begins having treatment. He actively fights his eating disorder voice and though it takes many months to recover, he eventually does.
"Of course famous Potter gets the glory, that sniveling dumb git! Of course he would be the one to have his stupid name pulled from the cup, while the more qualified, prestigious people for the challenge (me)  get to sit back and watch that idiot Gryffindork get himself killed," Draco Malfoy ranted to his posse, Crabbe and Goyle, while getting ready for breakfast. "He won't last the first task."
"I don't know Legilimens well enough. Besides, I wouldn't want to see in your head. I care for you too much. You deserve the privacy of your own thoughts and memories."
“You’re such a girl,” Harry shouted before lacing their fingers together and leading them down the many staircases of Hogwarts.
"I just... got scared. I had a memory check up. Everything is fine, but forgetting is part of the aging process, you know. And it's not a problem now, but in fifty years, it might be. I don't want to forget any moment I've ever had with you, so every day I think of a memory."
"He didn't, Lily, stop getting ahead of us! So we didn't talk for a while... a couple months I think it was," Harry turned to verify it with Draco who was sniffing and wiping his nose with his sleeve. He nodded. "One day," Harry's throat tightened, "I knew one of his attempts back fired when the girl he poisoned came back from St. Mungos. I followed him to the girls bathroom where he broke down."
"How did you end up getting past me yesterday? I was waiting out in the cold for an hour," Draco asked.
"Stop it," Harry said, pushing him away. He helped him up. "It'll be okay. Look, we just killed another piece of his soul." He turned to Ron and Hermione, who were looking at them bizarrely, "You got the Hufflepuff cup, right?" They both nodded, and he turned back to Draco. "See, it'll be okay. We just have to kill the snake."
His brain gave him worst-case scenarios all day, every day, and only silenced while Mr. Weasley came to see him and update him.
"Oh god," Draco rolled over and mumbled into the pillow before turning back to Harry. "I can't believe we decided that over an arm wrestling match!"
Draco didn't fucking care. He was going to let himself have this. Fuck all, fuck everything. He could die within the next two weeks. Why wouldn't he enjoy this? Everyone needed to just leave him alone and let him have Harry. What would it matter? Draco wasn't going to kill Dumbledore. He was going to fail, just like with Katie Bell. And the Dark Lord knew they were together, anyway.
Draco's heart couldn't help but flutter. Harry brought a light to the Manor that was undeniable, and Draco couldn't stop looking at him and the contrast of his spirit against the posh Malfoy walls.
Draco decided to tell him the truth. "Because it's dangerous to say something like that when the Dark Lord is trying to search your head. What if he saw that last year in the Ministry of Magic? When your own memories are used as a weapon against you. I'm not going to put you in that position." Harry nodded and then rolled on his back, looking up at the ceiling. He was disappointed. Draco could see it on his face. "That must be hard to hear."
Kingsley glared at them both before continuing on, causing a few to laugh.  “And do you, Draco take this… insane man to be your wedded husband?”
"For God's sake, Ron, will you stop yelling at me! We're at war! What if I die tonight? How would feel if these were the last words you ever spoke to me? Ending 7 years of friendship like this!"
Harry was an idiot. What if someone caught him here? What if his cloak fell off? There they would be, all of their classmates fully aware that they were together. What a bloody nightmare that would be.
No amount of fire could describe the burning feeling in Draco's stomach and throat. "Harry, it is the most important thing that you can do for yourself. You have to have food to live. You don't have a fighting chance without food. This has nothing to do with how you look or who you are."
Just then the bell ringed indicating them late for class. “We can’t just walk in together all happy and cheery. It’ll look like something’s up, us both being late.”
Draco broke from his Harry-induced trance, eyebrows raising to his forehead, him finally getting the message. On his tip toes, he shuffled out of the room as quietly as humanly possible as Harry engaged and distracted McGonagall in conversation. As Draco ran after he was unseen, the last thing he heard was McGonagall informing Harry about the Diggory's wishing to see him.
"I see we've reached an end to our trial. The jury needs to reach a decision. All those infavor of life in Askaban."
Draco squeezed his shoulder and then kissed his cheek. Then kicked off. "Oi, Ronald," Draco called. "Game on!"
Because fuck everything and everyone. Didn't they understand the pain and the guilt? Didn't they understand that not only did he mourn his Godfather, he mourned his future, his escape from the Dursley's and his chance at having a dad? Sirius only loved him and cared for him and did everything he could to protect him, guide him, and comfort him.
"The Weasleys have offered. But it's like Dumbledore doesn't want me there, I have to be with them because they're my legal guardians."
Harry couldn't help but grin, his face turning red. "Yeah, we should sort that out first." He sauntered to Draco, then, leant against him. "Wouldn't want to traumatize him more."
"I'm so sorry. H-Harry please." He searched the trees, and by the time he made it to the final tree, his tears had blurred his vision so much, he couldn't see anything.
"Boys," Hermione cut in, but was interrupted when Harry coughed yet again, completely falling out of their grasp.
They stood in an empty hallway outside the courtroom, and Harry nearly knocked him over from the force of his hug. He squeezed him as tight as he could. If he wasn't careful, he could have broken him in half.
He wanted to jump out of his body and leave all the darkness behind in it. He wanted to leave this life and find another.
The room started up with chatter and he found himself quieting them. Harry kept from smiling with difficulty. “Alright… so he talked about me often?”
Harry felt as though he was going to throw up before he was apparated to the outside of the Weasley home.
Draco writhed beneath him, trying to synch with Harry, but it was getting difficult to even think properly. "Fuck, you feel so good. You're so good!"
"Thank you." Harry kissed his cheek several times, then his lips again. Then he broke away and grabbed his invisibility cloak.
"And after graduation," Harry joined, "We're running off and getting married and raising little death eater children- no it's not Malfoy!!"
"Note to self, if you can't fend off Legilimency, have some memories that you'd prefer that person to watch first. It'll buy time."
Draco left for Hogsmeade well after everyone had already made it there. By now, Harry would be playing at Zonko's or something, hopefully not thinking about him at all, hopefully not checking his map.
Draco collapsed on top of him, losing all grace and control, and he kissed him fiercely with a whimper. He kissed him so hard, and tried not to cry as he did so. That in it of itself was difficult. Harry couldn't breathe, yet again, but this time it was on his own accord. Draco was on top of him, his weight pushing deep into a bed. A bed. He and Draco were on a bed. A big soft bed that they could make hours and hours of love on because they could.
Are there any questions? And if there are, once you ask, please state your name. It’s going to be hard enough for me to remember everyone’s, may as well start early.”
"It wasn't an accident," Harry tried his best not to growl, because his blood now boiled. Maybe he naively thought Draco went flying or something, because his brain wouldn't think about someone hurting him like this.
"I have the final sign off on anything that gets passed onto the Ministry. He has come to me with the recent detentions to put on your file but I have declined. I will do anything in my power to make sure that Draco will not go back to Azkaban before his trial."
"It's a date," Harry smiled, and then he dropped it. "Er, I mean, it's not a date, not like that, but like a... a set time and place date, not like a date that two people go on—well I mean it is two people going out but it's not a date... but is. If that makes sense."
"Come on, Springgate has no competition compared to Dowsett." Harry wore his t-shirt and a jumper, normal jeans with his hair a mess as always. He looked cute—no, he didn't. Stop it, Draco. "Springgate has way more experience, almost beat Krum once."
Draco swallowed. “I don’t ever remember telling you that.” Maybe that was too far of a seed to plant.
"Damn you, Potter!" He had a strong feeling that Potter was going to drive him to insanity and back.
"Draco, what are you," Harry started but realized that Draco wasn't wrapped in his arms, rather behind him. "Draco?"
Draco spent his entire Thursday evening, and well into the night, on the Quidditch Pitch, laying out several hundred roses into the shape of
“It was heartbreaking,” Draco said softly, “I just wanted to hold him and make him feel better but I just couldn’t no matter what I did.”
But this one seemed more genuine than the others. "Thanks," Harry said. "We don't have to talk about me the whole time. I'm more interested in you. What was life growing up for you?"
Harry enclosed his arms around the small of Draco's back, pulling him as close as physically possible, and Draco most definitely enjoyed it.
"Harry, I swear—" And then he saw a shadow in the corner of his eye. He looked up to find Astoria approaching. Draco pushed him off and zipped up, walking to the middle of the library so he was out in the open.
Draco wanted Harry to hurt. He wanted everything to hurt so much, just so he could understand what pain was, what he was feeling constantly. Because, fuck, this hurt Draco so bad, everything hurt him so so bad.
Draco's eyes welled, but he was able to hide it from Harry as he squeezed him tight, burying his face into his neck. It could be the last time he'd ever hear those words and say it back. "Happy New Year."
One thing had been on his mind though, and he had to let it out. It was his last chance, sin he knew after tonight he would be saying goodbye to him.
Potter blinked, and Draco turned on his heel. He rounded the corner and began walking on the bridge back to the castle, but then he caught an eye at how sad Potter looked.
Harry nodded, and then he looked around the room. "This is nicer than the Slytherin dorm you had. Head Boy has its privileges."
“Well, I would hold you, and rub your thighs with my soothing hands. And then I would kiss you slowly, gently even, and run my warm hands in your hair to get the cold out. After that I would kiss down your neck, then along your scars, as always, and then I would keep going down further and further, and you would moan my name, over and over again,” Harry breathed hotly in his ear.
Truly, being with him was an annoyance; Draco made it so, purposefully. So Harry knew he wasn't welcome.
That only meant he could go in through the front entrance, where people were. It only created a bigger risk, a risk Draco didn't know if he should take, but he had no choice.
"You know it would be a shame if someone just," Draco trailed off playfully, sticking his fingers right next to Harry's stomach, inevitably causing the boy's eyes to widen.
Harry took a deep breath and decided it was time. He wanted to test the waters, and see how much the universe could target him for announcing such a thing. "I'm gay."
"You are so beautiful," Harry stroked his cheek and kissed him again, tears blinding him. "So beautiful. I was so lucky to have you even for just a little while. So lucky."
"I'm an idiot, I'm such an idiot," Draco cried to Pansy and Blaise, who sat on Pansy's bed. "Why didn't I say it back?"
Draco licked his lips and then decided to leave Harry to the work he needed to do. He probably didn't know how else to sleep better and resorted to extra meditation. Draco frowned when he returned to Hogwarts, and he slept alone.
"You couldn't of, you love father," Lily said in an equal tone. Harry just gave them a guilty look before turning to Draco, almost breaking down.
Then, Harry continued with the moments he froze his own room, in going to the Hospital Wing, and in Draco getting jumped at Hogsmeade.
“Right,” Hermione said. She kissed his forehead. “I’ll come by to visit in the morning before hours incase this one,” she looked at Draco, “decides to lollygag. Take care of him. If you hurt him-“
Madam Pomfrey returned with one and he chugged it. It took moments for it to take effect, but when it did, it indeed took the edge off. Though it wasn't a cure by any means. "We'll check in the morning, but if you haven't improved, we might have to send you."
"You deserve so much better than me. I hope you find some one who treats you right, and I'm sorry this has to end like this. It's about time, huh? Almost two years."
"I'm here now," Draco tried to keep a soft, calm tone. "That's all that matters. We made it, okay. I'm here."
"I already told you, Malfoy," Ron said cockily, taking his seat next to Hermione, "I haven't lost a match."
"Harry, where have you been? We were so worried," Hermione automatically said as Harry walked into the Gryffindor Common Room.
"Potter, I don't want you. I don't want to be around you. I don't need you defending me. I don't want you near me!" And then Harry realized: Draco didn't just forget that he and Harry dated, he forgot everything about the War, how he fought on the good side. He thought he was a criminal.
But then March 2020 happened and everyone slow down and separated. And even more daunting I planned on moving states away from my family to complete another degree. So I knew, in this time of quarantine and isolation, I’d need the comfort of an old friend. And so I decided to rewrite it.
The day went by dreadfully for Harry. He was in Ancient Runes, a terribly boring class, but the professor didn't care if his students payed attention or not. He just went through the motions while the class zoned out.
But if he caved, he'd look guilty, and guilt meant that he knew what he was doing (He did. But Harry didn't need to assume that.)
"I deserved it," Draco nodded and an awkward silence passed. "But yeah, I've been playing since I was small."
Potter fought back a smile and rocked on his feet. "Is it because I kissed you or is it because you want another?"
They sat on their picnic blanket, so close their knees were touching. "Why does anyone do this?" Harry hooted.
Draco grabbed his old wand and ran to him, casting a lumos so he could see. Once next to Harry, he dropped the wand and stroked Harry's back.
Harry gazed over the magnificently decorated room, which was covered in pumpkins and bats and orange lights. The candles floated lower than usual as the others were dim.
“We are going to be at our wedding and in your speech, all you’re going to talk about is how I hit up some guys just for you,” Harry rolled his eyes.
," he mumbled to himself while he entered. The place looked like Hogwarts after the battle: dust everywhere, broken glass, chipped furniture.
"Boys," Hermione cut in, but was interrupted when Harry coughed yet again, completely falling out of their grasp.
"I-" Harry started, but Draco knew he'd try to explain what happened and that's not something he should be doing right now.
"Which one? You kissed me in the transfiguration classroom as revenge, and then I kissed you in the hallway hiding from-"
Draco grabbed his old wand and ran to him, casting a lumos so he could see. Once next to Harry, he dropped the wand and stroked Harry's back.
"This is my last chance to be with him," Harry almost bit, "He has that god damned ring in his pocket. Hermione, he's going to propose!"
Harry arrived at Umbridge's detention on Friday with a heavy heart. He was supposed to be on a date with Draco. His dates with Draco became the only thing he looked forward to each day. They were safe and calming and, therefore, addictive. Harry's only true source of goodness, even if they were stuck outside in the winter air.
"Shh, we don't need to talk about it tonight. We can talk about it tomorrow. We've gotten no sleep in four days, let's just rest, okay?"
“Draco Malfoy, did you just spank me,” Harry’s mouth dropped as he tried to hold back a chuckle, his left butt cheek stinging.
He released his arms from behind Harry's body and Harry free fell until just before he hit the ground, when Draco grabbed his arm and kept him from it.
"Who could ever like being a muggle," Draco asked, although he didn't mean to say it as snobbish as he meant it.
He only sneaked in and out of the library at night in his invisibility cloak, whether or not Draco was to be around the area. The encounters with him were making Harry unstable, especially under his unique circumstances.
The walk to the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom was long, awkward, and sickening. Any time Alecto Carrow saw someone in the hall, she'd hiss, and sometime hex them. If Draco didn't take the next student, he knew he'd get his own, so he hexed a small Ravenclaw who fell on the floor, crying.
"I think you could be a good person if you learned how to be. I don't want you to be like your father. He's cruel. He's mean. He's empty."
Draco let go, leaving Harry's to rest on his thigh before traveling upwards to Draco's bulge. That, Harry hadn't felt before, charms blocking him from the treasure. And it was the most amazing thing Harry ever did. He massaged it timidly and a low groan from Draco's throat surprised him. Finally, he opened his eyes to find Draco watching him, a look of desire across his face. He licked his lips.
"I think of you a lot. Whenever I'm in a fix, not a thought doesn't consume my brain that isn't of a messy haired, scar faced wonder boy. What would Harry do, you know? And my stomach feels like it's doing back flips when you laugh and it just makes me want to laugh. I guess that I might actually be doing something right for once in my life."
"Please just stop doing this to yourself," Draco sat up and kneeled next to Harry, their hands still together. "Listen, I'm sorry, okay? I am. I don't know what happened and I don't know why it did, but I can't help it. And I don't know why it hurts seeing you like this. As much as I wish I could remember just for you to shut up, I can't. I have no idea to begin with how you even fell in love with me if you really did-"
"At least you can pronounce the word boyfriend this time." Harry kissed his cheek. Draco rolled his eyes, then took a deep breath. "Don't be so nervous. They're just my friends."
"Light blue, like the sky. I normally wear purple or dark blue in the winter, dark green in the summer. But since it was for my birthday, my mother said they match my eyes and it was 'my choice.' I just wanted to please her."
Harry pressed his lip in a line. "Malfoy, er, you don't have to compliment me that much. Really, thanks, but..."
The blonde walked out of the water, naked in his glory, going unnoticed to the focused Harry unbuttoning his shirt, his hands numb and shaking. Harry only looked up when Draco’s hands touched his own, and moved them away from the plastic brooches. The gryffindor looked up to see the steamy water dripping off of the boy. Harry’s eyes involuntarily traveled down his fiancé’s body. It was all his. Draco undressed him, looking into Harry’s searching eyes, as well as at his lips, which were shivering.
“Of course now, but back then, Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy dating was not something a person even dreamed in their nightmares,” Harry said, and Draco laughed.
"You just killed Harry's owl! What did the owl do to you? I don't care how much you hate Harry, you scum. How could you hurt a defenseless animal?"
"Which one's the shampoo? There's like eight bottles in here—no, actually nine. And they're all in... Portuguese?"
He tried to change the deep groans coming from Potter's throat into squeals of pleasure from Astoria, but he seemed more turned on when he heard Potter's deep rumbles. Draco also tried to imagine breasts in place of Potter's chest and yet they did nothing for his ingenuity. Nothing of Astoria's did.
Madam Pomfrey looked at Harry and Harry looked at her, his lips slightly parted. Don't you dare let yourself get your hopes up.
"No, just enjoying the view," Draco lent on the doorframe. Harry took his shirt and whacked Draco with it. "Not very nice, are you?"
“Why are we here,” Scorpius asked, genuinely wondering, his white hair shining in the setting sun in contrast with Harry and Lily’s dark hair.
"But you two are getting along better, right?" Ron took a bite of a chocolate frog. "Not like how it was at the trial?"
Harry laughed, too, and then limped towards him, climbing in and sitting across from Draco, his legs on either side of him, ankles gracing his thighs. The luxurious heat and the feeling of Draco's body along his. The bubbles that tickled his skin. It was all lovely and calming and wonderful.
"Harry Potter." Harry couldn't help but smile as he walked to McGonagall, though he did savor a moment of looking out into the crowd and seeing his friends and the Weasleys cheering him on most importantly.
Then he put his head in his hands, keeping his eyes tightly shut, though the back of them felt unbearably hot.
Harry breathed, opening his eyes only to realize he didn't remember closing them. "J-Just wait a second." The pain died down a bit and wasn't as sharp. Draco stayed completely still, almost terrified to move again. Harry's eyes watered.
Harry's first wave of unbearable grief passed after quite a while. Hermione sat at his bedside and grabbed his hand, while Draco held him.
" He's a death eater and he indirectly killed my family member and you want me to give him a chance?"
Potter stumbled backwards, blood dripping down his face, and Draco's stomach burned. His heart. His soul, too.
"Oh, erm- probably because I wasn't telling them what it was for," Harry came up with. "They hate it went I use magic and they just wanted to make sure I'm not... I wasn't going to harm them or anything."
"I forgot to give you your wand," he said still smiling like an idiot. He reached into his pocket to find the wand that belonged to the Slytherin.
"They'll want you in Azkaban for keeping me away from signing away to someone else. It's this dancing game."
"No," Draco's throat tightened. "No I promise. I don't know of any seventh years..." He held his hands close to his chest, playing with his fingers, ready to fall apart. Like everything in the world was too much. The light from the fire and the sound of Harry's voice, and the thought of there being a death eater at Hogwarts.
"I-I..." Malfoy tried searching his memories, but it only made his head hurt. He received flashes. Dark magic. His wand pointing at the bond. His Dark Mark hissing. "Death Eater."
Harry frowned, trying to suppress the tantalizing fear that Draco was going to judge him or hurt it worse or leave. But then Draco reached into the picnic basket and pulled out a few bandages and a jar of cream off of a stump next to the hammock.
“Exactly like when we were kids,” Draco smiled a smile a million miles wide, looking at him in the eyes, their noses touching.
Ideas popped into Draco's head. They could do a lot of things with all the doors locked. Harry could murder him. "Can we go get my stuff in my bedroom before we go?"
Harry welcomed him in the shower after that. They cuddled on the couch instead of sat on the opposite ends of it. Instead being halfway out the door, Draco put Harry up against it, just so he could kiss him deeper. They made it to a bed when the had sex, and it wasn't just sex anymore, it was love. Passionate, pure, forgivable love.
Harry, again, broke free from his hold and tried running from him. He just wanted out, out of there with Draco. Draco was the one thing that Harry could say was his, was untouched by the Dursleys and his childhood. That's why he liked Draco as his boyfriend. He was different. All magic.
He stared at the letter a little while longer, clutching it in his hand. The handwriting reminded him the notes he received last year, and getting this present was more of a lovesick reminder than a happy visit. He missed him too much.
"I want the worst one. Give me your worst death. That's the one I deserve, as long as it's from you."
He let a tear slip, but then he flung it off his cheek as Harry cried and cried and cried. But then he realized he loved Harry being in his arms in the time of need. In no one else's but his own. And if Voldemort was to break through the Hospital Wing doors, Harry'd be safe, because what kind of sociopath would murder somebody in the other's arms?
By late May, kisses changed. They went from shy and awkward and too much to handle to never enough. When Draco kissed him as long as he could, Harry wanted more. When Harry kissed him as much as he could, Draco wanted more.
"Well, I must say I'd hope for better." The Dark Lord laughed, and so did everyone around him. "And who might you be, young man?"
"You're sick," Harry pushed Malfoy, then reached in his pocket and shoved his wand against Draco's chest. "Don't you dare ever talk to her like that again, Malfoy!"
"Yes. I had to support you. I always do. And what do I see while I'm there? Your hands all over each other!"
You are a deceitful, evil man! You should have been in slytherin," Draco laughed! "Remind me to never mess with you!"
"I don't think he is. And even if he is, I wouldn't stand for it. I've been manipulated enough," she said bitterly, looking at Draco in a way that made Harry's stomach twist. Those words were loaded. Harry didn't know how.
"Of course I'll wear it. I'll never take it off. Thank you." He reached down and kissed Harry again. "I got you something... it's not... don't make a big deal out of it."
"You're not ruining it if I chose to be with you knowing you were like this." Draco took his hand. "I wanted to do this."
He blinked, walked away, and then he came back to it. Again, the handle remained. Even as he put a foot on the wall and pulled with all of his might—so hard that he fell backwards onto the floor—it wouldn't budge.
"We're both not into each other at all. It'd be a miserable marriage and frankly I didn't want it to begin with."
Ron's hand poked through the shower curtain, holding a towel. Harry put it on, stepping out with soaking wet hair that hadn't yet been cleaned.
With a stinging heart, Draco put his head in his hands yet again. "I didn't mean for him to be hurt. The last thing I could ever want is him being hurt."
"I mean it. With everything in me. You're my favorite person, and you're the most important person in my life. If you weren't in this world, I'd be so lost. You mean so much to me." Draco kissed his cheek. "That's why you like it when I ask about your day, isn't it? Because no one was ever interested in your day."
"What happened in there," Draco asked, looking into his wild eyes as he shut the door, locked it, and put a silencing charm on it.
"The vanishing cabinet In the room of requirement. I've been mending it all year." It all seemed to make sense to Harry now.
They spent the turn of the century kissing each other and Draco promised Harry yet another "best year of your life" to which Harry said, 'that will be hard to beat."
"Could you imagine how wonderful of a relationship we could have if we weren't who we were? We could cheer each other on during matches instead of try to hurt each other. We could eat breakfast in the Great Hall, hold hands in the corridor." Harry bit his lip. "You deserve so much better than Harry Potter." Harry finally looked at him, solemn all over his face. Draco had a black eye by his own doing. "Damn it! Why didn't you get this healed?"
“Because I will always remember the time when you climbed on top of me and squashed my vital organs.”
Harry did as asked, and after a few more pulses, he leant back into Draco and whispered, "I'm ready."
"I-I dunno. I thought Dementors at first because look at him, but I don't think that Dementors can take happy memories. And I looked at the pocket watch. It's been stuck on 1260 days for months."
"The have a hard bite," Draco smirked, his lingering hand rubbing his shoulder before releasing and sauntering to the side of the table to face Potter. The boy looked like he was going to puke, and Draco guessed he would telling by the time it took him to get out of the library.
And he screamed. Oh he screamed so much his vocal chords broke and Death Eaters crowded him, laughing as he squirmed under the pain.
The two were startled and broke apart, their cheeks reddening. "Sorry, guys, we didn't hear you come in." Draco took his hand and ran it through his hair unconsciously.
Ron lay back on his bed. "It's fine. But I'll find out eventually. There are only so many blokes in a school."
"Silence, Potter! Draco, I do not approve of this," he hissed. "This is exactly why we made the contract—"
Harry smiled because of it. A bitter sweet smile as he soaked in the look of them, the point and the curve, the shape itself, and how they added to Draco's body.
It took Harry only a few seconds to answer. "Losing any and all of you. I don't want a trade off. I don't want to pick my friends over you and I don't want to pick you over my friends."
. What the hell did he just say? That was something that Pansy said during one of their tutoring sessions. It wasn't supposed to come until Phase 3. And Potter was just as caught off guard as Draco was. Merlin, he could slam his face against the table right now.
“Maybe we’re just drifting apart,” he erupted, throwing his hands out to the side before putting them in his hair. “It’s what couples do! They drift when they realize they aren’t right for each other!” Death eater, death eater. LIAR.
And then he showed him the last of his memories, the ball, asking him to burn everything, the heart failure, the decision that they both had to make.
"Me too," Draco told. "But hey, I love you no matter what happens okay," Draco assured him, pulling him into a hug.
"I'm getting there! So when I opened them the ink was barely visible and the papers were worn, but it was still legible. It turned out that he wanted to be an artist, and every night leading up to his service, they would lay on the ground, just as we are, hands connected," Harry put his hand over Draco's, locking his palm over the top of the blonde's hand, interlocking their fingers. Draco let him. "And they would watch the sunset from well in the afternoon, all the way up to one or two in the morning. They would only talk."
Hermione broke him from his trance. "We were supposed to leave five minutes ago," she said as everyone continued casting spells.
The Grindylow smelled his blood. That was why he attacked him. Grindylows love blood. "Are you okay?"
Potter snorted and then chuckled. "Oh, come on, who wouldn't laugh at that? How does that even happen?"
"Because you're doing it wrong," Draco equaled his tone, stirring it the proper way. "You're not tanking my grade if I can help it."
"Do you think Harry has ever thought of Malfoy being something different than an enemy," Neville peaked up. "Like a friend."
But he was too, mourning the loss of Harry ever being able to save him ever again. They'd let go, soulmate bond be damned.
Never. "One day. If the war ends and we're still together by the end of it." We won't ever be together ever again after this year.
"Point taken," Harry kissed him again. He moved his hands to Draco's lower back and then to his arse. "And we definitely shouldn't be doing that."
Harry was eager to do as ordered and immediately bit his skin, then sucked. This gave Draco an opportunity to pull his arm from Harry's side and hold it up behind him so Harry couldn't see it. He looked over Harry's shoulder. His sleeve had a dark red puddle seeping through the material, and the sight made Draco woozy. The room behind his arm spun, and he felt as though the bed sailed in the wake.
“Oh please,” Remus snuck up behind him and whispered in Harry’s ear, making him jump, “They were high-fiving and making bets on how long you’d last. They didn’t watch but… they knew.”
.' And they have to keep a straight face, because the whole point of therapy is they're supposed to not have a reaction and every time I can see they're trying to hide it."
However, Draco's handwriting made it worth it. He'd get to see him in a couple of hours. Everything would be okay.
"Then it was worth losing it." At this point Draco was back on the bed positioned as he was before. He was ready to flick his wand when Harry stopped him.
“You would have never really trusted me ever again, it was hard enough as it was to get you to trust me the first time.”
"Shh," Harry cut him off and played with his lips, not letting him speak. "Please don't say it. Just kiss me."
"I'm glad to be daft! Because everyone has a choice! It's whether or not your strong enough to take it, shows who you really are. And you chose to be a coward."
Harry grabbed his hand and turned to the sinks as Draco stood confused. "Here, I want you to feel this." He guided Draco to one of the normal sinks.
"Harry, how are you feeling," Hermione asked concerned. Although it was an obvious answer, she still needed a diagnosis from the patient himself.
"One of my therapists has helped me break down why I'm so scared of food so much. When I was six, the Dursleys made me make them pancakes, for the first time ever, and I had no idea how to make them. They just were like,
"I don't want to say good bye! You're the best thing that's ever happened to me!" Harry cried even harder. Draco just say there, holding him. About a minute passed of them just caressing each other. Draco scooted back and wiped Harry's black bangs away from his forehead so he could see his favorite emerald eyes one last time.
They made it to an abandoned classroom with little answers and Draco rushed inside, but the second he realized it was vacant, he turned around to have the door shut and locked in his face.
Draco glanced at Pansy, giving her a wink, and then strolled next to Harry, biting his lip, and he took his seat. Draco could feel Harry tense up a bit, knowing that the obscure Slytherin attempted to kiss him, and now would have to sit by him because fate enjoyed to mess with him.
"Nope!" Harry kissed all over his face aggressively, and Draco still fought against him, grunting. "Marry me?"
"I don't understand how they could have changed back though," Harry remembered reading about it from the book Hermione gave him. "Even if you had your memory taken from you."
He thought of the whole situation. Surely it could make sense if you looked at it with a different angle... well a different angle with an eye closed and head tilted almost upside down.
“I could say the same! All you talk about is how much you miss lemon drops,” Snape snapped. Harry laughed.
interaction. They'd fought a war, after all. It would be completely inappropriate to pursue a relationship right now. Especially with their rocky history.
They'd talked about it several times, whether or not he should do it, since he didn't know what type of magic the spell was, or what consequences could come of it. The war was still going on, and if Draco was bonded to Voldemort, there was a possibility that this could jeopardize everything.
The entire day went by in an adrenaline blurb. They didn't stop smiling the entire day as they walked the corridors hand in hand. Girls ooo'd and ahh'ed and adored them and the entire time they were followed to classes by herds of them.
"I had to tell the Dark Lord or else he would of put me under veritasierum. He saw Harry's memories at the ministry and questioned me about it. I played it off like it was the plan to trick him. Thank Merlin he doesn't know what love is or we'd both be dead. He thought I was clever, and he didn't completely trust me, so he made me take the mark. Plus Snape. In 5th year he made us break up actually. We faked a fight, and it worked, somewhat. He said it was dangerous, being together, but despite what he said, we kept trying, kept fighting. "
“You’re barking,” Harry’s heart quickened and face went numb. He looked at his fingers to realize he was shaking.
"Damn it Draco!" Harry went to go comfort him... again... but the ended up running into each other in the hallway. "What the hell are you wearing?"
The Gryffindor kept his sight from Draco's, knowing he'd break his own heart in the blink of an eye. After a log pause and deep breath, Harry finally spoke while playing with a stick in the sand, making an unknown figure. "Couldn't sleep," he half-lied. "You?"
Draco wrote it on a piece of paper and shoved it in the flap. Within seconds, there was a snap coming from a cupboard above the table. Draco opened it, and there rested two glasses of it. "Brilliant! Are you hungry," Draco asked.
Harry bit his lip, his stomach turning over and over. It broke into a smile. "Actually I do, because then I could wrap my arms around you and make you feel safe like you do me when I fall asleep on you."
Draco limped and limped hard, to the room across the hall where his trunk resided. He grabbed Harry's bag and found the diary in it. He flipped to the last page, looking at the shape of tragedy written by his own hand, the date February 29th, the day after he'd executed Plan DBR.
Giving out, Draco lay down on the blanket smiling up at the darkening sky, then turned his head to admire the sunset past Harry, however his view was obscured when Harry lay back as well.
"We want you to be happy Harry, really, I just don't understand how you two don't get sick of each other," Hermione commented.
It didn't seem to phase Draco, who was still doing his best to breathe. His voice cracked as he spoke, "You shouldn't have saved me."
Halfway through, Harry set his clean clothes on the counter and Draco thanked him, but nothing more came of it. When finished with his shower, Draco had to debate putting on clothes, because how funny would it be waltzing in and taking a seat with nothing on? But then he restrained himself and thought,
“Harry, we have enough money to last us the rest of our children’s children’s lives’, let alone our own! Plus I work and I never see you anyway because you work the weekends, me the weekdays. Please Harry. I can’t go on like this with you anymore. We fight constantly. We talk about divorce! Divorce! Us! Harry, please. I’m not going to live without you any longer.”
"Since when has Harry ever followed the path of everyone else. I'm pretty sure he'll die in some insane, twisted way."
"I- he....uh-...eg-..that...Po-..he-" he tried to conjure the event that just happened but it refused to slip from his tongue.
"He's innocent," Harry said flatly at the dark of the conversation. Both men turned their heads and stared at him as if he was insane. "He is. Please tell me we can get him out."
"How didn't I see it? How was he that good at fooling me? He never loved me, he..." it hurt too much to speak about it, to relive the horrors, "the whole time he was using me for information. And I gave him it. I gave him the key to everything, willingly. Here I was worried about Voldemort finding out about us. The fucker was telling him about me the whole time. He's a Death Eater, Hermione." And then Harry choked and let out a sob.
Draco chuckled and then ripped up some grass, throwing the blades at Harry. "Did you just call me a rich bitch?"
He shook his head. "Just because I don't say something for a month or two doesn't mean I grew out of it. You are my Scarface."
Draco took a step to annoy him. Then he put his hands up in the air. "Well. Go on. Do it." Harry didn't, but he still had his wand. "What was the spell again? The one you used on me?"
Anyway, I love how you treat me, even though I could never live enough life times to earn it. I love how you know absolutely everything about me, where to kiss me, what to do when I'm angry or upset. You snap me out of it, and I want to be snapped out of it when I'm with you.
"Mind him. He's insane. I'll talk to him—wait, he was talking about me last year, I only decided to apply for the job a few weeks ago."
Draco scooped water up into his hair to wet it and then went for the shampoo bottle. Harry watched his face, which remained calm and objective. But Harry waited for Draco to comment on his hair, how there were bald patches from it falling out. But he didn't say anything.
There was an awkward silence but Harry played with his hand some more. They looked into each other's eyes. Harry was so speechless when saw how colored Draco's were.
Draco grabbed Harry with his raised hand, pulling him out of the snow. He snaked an arm around Harry's lower back and pulled him so close as to their waists were pressed up against each other. "Only if you treat your Tour Guide well," he smirked, and then whispered in his ear, "Just a warning in advance, he likes to stop and snog the visitors unpredictably."
"I do. I think it takes a lot for you to break. It... it's grief. Bloody hell, you deserve to break and to be broken, and so do I and we deserve this, Harry. We do." Harry sniffed, no worded answer. He didn't want to speak any more.
Harry just nodded, obeying the headmaster and heading towards the common room. He walked up the stairs briskly, dreading every step, and changed into his new uniform for the tournament. He sat on the bed and took deep breaths, hoping it would slow time down but time stops for no one, not even the Boy-Who-Lived.
“Harry,” Draco sat up and grabbed his chin, “He won’t. Why would he ever want help from a fifteen, going on sixteen year old? I’m just a kid. I have no value to him. I still have the trace. You’re blowing this out of proportion.”
"Does it work," Draco asked trying not to sound so desperate, but he hadn't slept properly since before summer. "You are the muggle expert."
"Out of all the things in the world, you picked a whale," Draco smiled and let out a small laugh while looking down at Harry who was looking up at him with the brightest eyes in the world. "It doesn't even have a tail."
"Whatever. You hate me. I've been nothing but a nuisance for years, ever since I met you. I've done everything against you for 7 years, and I almost.. I almost..." Draco's voice got very low, "murdered somebody. I'm supposed to be rotting away just like the others."
He said nothing in return but stared at it for quite some time, letting any stray tears fall down his face.
"You can still talk to us," Hermione started. "We don't expect you to be... healed after everything so quickly."
"Is that a smile or is it like a clench," Harry asked trying to hold back laughter at the failed attempt of a smile. Draco's face dropped, for doubt overfilled him and he bit his lip. How could he of been so stupid? "Take insults well, Malfoy?"
“Because me and daddy are here to tell you two a story,” Draco put on a fake smile ruffling Scorp’s hair.
Draco put his palm against Potter's, his fingers much longer. "No wonder Skeeter thought you were twelve." Potter threw his head back in laughter. "How do you catch that bloody snitch with such tiny hands?"
"No," Mr. Weasley said. "That's not what you want. You want Draco to go through the justice system and be let go with a minimal sentence so you two can live good lives together. Being with him does not equate to a good life. A good life equates to a good life."
Sleeping brought nightmares. Eating made him more uncomfortable than he'd ever admit out loud. Even if something tasted good, he'd feel guilty for eating it. Classes made him angry at best because he couldn't concentrate on them, and sad at worst, because all the students lost should be here with him. He couldn't take walks because he saw dead bodies in the hallways. Flying, again, reminded him of Draco. He didn't want to play with animals too much—it made him think of Hedwig, who he never got to mourn more than a second after she was murdered.
Lily spoke first, as she seemed the most devastated. "Dad, how could you almost murder Father? And Father, you used an Unforgivable on Dad."
Draco returned several moments later with two glasses in his hand. Harry thanked him and gulped it down, and then they rested in silence, enjoying the afterglow. They closed their eyes and Draco pulled him close, cuddling, and they expected to fall asleep, but they were so excited to see each other again, to be in the other's presence. Especially like this.
Draco made it to the restricted section early so he could actually study before Harry arrived. Not that he couldn't trust Harry, he just knew his boyfriend well. Surely, he knew they'd barely study.
And then he buried his head into Harry's shoulder and kissed his neck, as it was the only place that wasn't obstructed by some sort of medical tool.
"Do you think Harry has ever thought of Malfoy being something different than an enemy," Neville peaked up. "Like a friend."
Yes! It's falling and hitting the ground! It's the same as you falling from 100 meters, if no one is around to see you, do you still break a bone," Draco answered sarcastically, "what would you call your autobiography?"
"Right," Draco spat, "Respect. He's probably in the Hospital Wing, like he is more than he's in his own common room, and they're probably poking and prodding at him like he's a freak, which is the last thing he probably wants right now!"
"She sure did, right to his face. Told him I was dead when I totally wasn't. I take it she approves."
Draco didn't say anything immediately. "Well, while we're talking about it... I wondered if you ever had because I... had some self-discovery and I hoped you knew how good it feels."
"Yeah," Draco agreed and there was silence between the two as Draco stroked hair out of the way of Harry's ear, faint music playing from a distance. Draco swallowed and decided what he wanted to do, and so he got up from under Harry and held his hand down for Harry to take it. "Dance with me."
“Yeah… wait hold on.” Draco grabbed Harry’s hand and placed his ear against the door, Harry doing the same. They heard muffled whispers just behind it.
Harry grew curious, glancing up at Draco with an eyebrow raised. The blond bit his lip, his leg shaking in anticipation. He couldn't read his facial expressions.
"Transfiguration... Divination... Defense Against the Dark Arts... Herbology... not Potter, ring a bell," Blaise said sarcastically.
"Good," Draco smirked. Then, he confidently and firmly took Potter's hand, and Potter, though surprised at first, changed his grasp so that their fingers interlaced with each other. If this was real, Draco would have thought this was better than a handshake in First Year. But this was fake. This wasn't reality.
Bellatrix opened the door, a look of seriousness hiding her insanity. "The boy, Potter. He's at Hogwarts. The Dark Lord is calling all Death Eaters to attack." Draco's heart pounded in his ears. "You have another mission. Go to the Room of Requirement. You have to find the Ravenclaw Diadem and protect it with your life. Bring it to me. Hide it so no one knows you have it. If you can't find me, you're to hide it somewhere far from Hogwarts."
Also a lie. He felt exhausted, achy, sore, and weak all the time. And maybe he was good at thinking that it was all because of Draco. That the cure would be to help Draco.
Draco looked at his hand, which had Harry's on top of it, and then back into his eyes. He could feel Harry's heart pulsing and beating, slowly at first, but then faster, and Draco could have sworn it skipped a beat.
If Harry didn't have his patronus, the dementors would have attacked them like meat. No one had taken a soul that Harry could see. There was something that stopped the dementors—what, they didn't know.
, he thought. After all, it was his 16th birthday, and in spite of all the darkness, he wanted to do something teenager-ish. And Harry wanted to do something teenagerish, too.
"I mean, I prefer it that way," Harry laughed. "Any weird fetishes I should know about before I commit to this?"
"Trust me, Hermione, I would love to mess with him," Harry smirked. "What's the worst he's going to do? Take away points. Darn. I think seeing him on the floor in the middle of the busiest corridor in the castle with everyone laughing at him would outweigh five stupid points. Should I make it so that he isn't able to untie his shoes himself?"
Giving out, Draco lay down on the blanket smiling up at the darkening sky, then turned his head to admire the sunset past Harry, however his view was obscured when Harry lay back as well.
"You're going to be the death of me, Potter," he mumbled, tickling Harry's stomach, causing him to laugh, and Draco swore he had never heard such a pure, angelic sound in his life. His eyes flashed again as he looked up at Harry, his ear listening to Harry's pulse as his chest bobbed up and down due to his laughter. Draco was still staring at him long after he was done giggling, and found himself lost in his eyes.
The words rang in his ear. Get the boy. They swirled through his brain, taunting him. It was when the familiar burn on his arm called him so greatly that it tore through his bone that he replied. "Yes, Aunt Bellatrix," he whispered.
"If people find out on their own and connect the pieces, good for them. It's not like we can hide it forever. But I'm ready when you are."
“Of course I did,” Draco smiled back. There was a comfortable silence before they spoke again. Harry got up and sat on the ledge of the clock window, examining the snow flurries while tucking his knees to his chest and resting his cheek on his knee.
"Could you please tell me what's going on," Draco bit, finally looking away, "When did we even plan this?"
He’d waited over three years to hear those words. “Of all the times you had to tell me,” he had claimed, and Draco just said “It felt like the right one.”
The rest of the class was okay, Draco and Harry never talked. The only thing worth discussing was the ingredients that went in the potion.
Ah. Draco's obsession with the rejection. It must still burn without remembering they dated. "I'm sorry I didn't shake your hand in First Year."
Upon realizing how much he truly missed Draco, he knew he had to see him, look at him, know he was physically there and healthy. Harry needed it more than a fish starved of water until it was on its last inch of life.
Draco kissed Harry persuasively by grabbing the back of his head and tugging at his hair, just smashing their lips together. On top of his tiredness biting at him, he grew dizzy and breathless.
“Are you kidding,” a black haired slytherin rolled his eyes, “that’s all he talked about if it didn’t have to do with potions. ‘My husband this, my husband that, oh my husband is Harry Potter, did you know?’ My name is Michael by the way, and yes, we know.”
They walked for hours, and anyone they found in their path, they hexed or tortured. A special few were carried unconsciously back to their port key and brought to the Manor.
Harry just rolled his eyes, got off of him, and helped him up. Draco grabbed him by his face unexpectedly, and kissed him and kissed him and kissed him.
He lay face down in the grass outside of the Burrow, his head pressed into his crooked arms bent above him. His clothes soaked in mud as rain continuously poured on the late summer evening.
It was plain and simple. They were in a relationship for a year and a half. They were both ridiculously attracted to one another. They were soulmates (not that Harry knew that). Also, Harry had a lower self-esteem. He'd told Draco that before the whole Ministry debacle: I never thought I'd ever find someone like you who would be interested in me. Which meant he was extra horny.
"Come catch me, ferret," Harry shouted before running out his door, through his common room and to the seventh floor. Draco sprinted after him. They spent their time scouring staircases, sprinting through empty hallways, and chasing each other through untouched corridors- all barefoot, their PJ's the only thing keeping them warm.
"Wait," Draco cried, "also make sure that he eats." Hermione furrowed her brows. "H-He doesn't have the best relationship with food and he forgets to eat and I don't want him to get sick." He swallowed and Hermione stared at him with her lips parted. "He's usually better if you eat with him b-but don't force him. Like you have to make him feel safe to eat things. Maybe take him to the Room of Requirement so he knows you're alone and let him cry, but don't let him leave until he eats."
"It's nothing harmful or painful. It's just a spell and I can look through the thread of your memories and I can search your hippocampus, neocortex, and amygdala. The brain structures that help store and encode memories to see if it's a structural problem or a memory problem."
“Harry, just please sit down,” Draco took his hand and brought him down to the couch again, his voice cracking.
"Either that or he's just daft. Does he not understand that without Harry Potter, he's literally nothing. He's a nobody. He's a sea urchin. No one would want to be with him. Not even Weasley or Granger. I don't see why he hates it so much. It's his livelihood. He said he went out with me because he knew I wouldn't care about his name."
It was such a new, strange feeling, Draco's body inside of him, Harry's body surrounding Draco's. The sheer closeness of their naked bodies. The tightness and fullness and weight.
"It's not working, Pansy! Nothing is working, no matter what spell I use, no matter what manual labor I use! I'm going to die, Pansy, I'm going to die, he's going to kill me and my family and Harry, and I-I can't do this," he started shaking out of fear, his hands clenching his pillow to try to calm him down but nothing of that sort ever worked.
“But we didn’t have to worry about that,” Harry said with a shaky breath, “because your father completely forgot who I was.” Both their mouths dropped and Lily looked confused.
Draco got on his knees so that Harry could hold his hips, and then he propped himself up on his forearms, doggy style.
He wanted it. Draco wanted it so badly. But he also begged for someone to walk in and stop them because he didn't know how this would help or hurt Plan DBR.
"If you forget my condition when you found me," he almost whispered. And then he took a moment to inhale and exhale, take a few moments to just enjoy Harry in his arms, even if he was mad. A pair of tears left his ducts once more and he let go of Harry a second to wipe his eyes, just so Harry knew he was crying too. "I think you're strong enough to break in front of me."
Then Malfoy crossed his legs and looked down at them. Harry continued sipping on the broth until he finished it.
"Luna healed me," said he. "Fixed my nose but didn't make it hurt less. It should be fine in a few days."
Which was how they found themselves an hour later, taking off the invisibility cloak before hopping over the edge of the viaduct. They slowly climbed down the rock until they reached a survivable height, now thirty feet above the water.
Potter shook his head. "I wouldn't put it that way. Not having parents is traumatizing. Having the man who killed your parents try to kill you as a ghost is also traumatizing."
"Did you really punch me that hard?" Harry examined himself in the mirror. The blood was dried down his neck but some still oozed from the corner of his lip.
Kingsley, very loudly, cleared his throat. "May I have the rings?" The ring bearer gave him them. "Repeat after me: I give you this ring as a daily reminder of my love for you. Or you know, go ahead and say whatever you want. You'll probably mess it up, anyway."
"It's like," Harry sniffed, "It's like I feel that fear every time I go to eat. I felt the anxiety I did when I was about to get captured and tortured and lose a war when I drink a fucking cup of broth. And it's like," his voice tightened. "I-I'm not a Gryffindor anymore. I'm just not. I'm not fucking brave, I'm so weak."
Ron finally made it through the clouds with Hermione, who held onto Ron, her face buried in his back so she couldn't see.
"You're a great friend, you know that, right," Draco said. That stung a lot. Right, a great friend. More like an extravagant boyfriend who refuses to give up despite his love completely forgetting their entire relationship, who then goes under a mental attack at any hint of their past. "But I didn't say that, for the record."
"I could have told my aunt it was you. It's one to one. I owe you nothing," Draco started to walk in the general direction to the exit however Harry grabbed his shoulder and spun him around.
"We have got to stop greeting each other like this," Harry yelped, grasping his shoulder. "What is it, Malfoy? Come to make fun of my incorrect use of a broom and rant how that isn't allowed." Harry had forgotten about Malfoy completely, and how he had been acting lately.
After getting on the dingy, the two talked for an hour or so more before heading back to the dock and going their separate ways, but before leaving Draco had one more question. "Are you going to Hogsmeade this weekend?"
"Yes I am." He assured himself that the pocket watch was in his right pocket and took the girl's arm headed down to the Great Hall together, trying to keep himself from yearning Potter's arm instead. The one he had was too weak.
So he continued kissing him until he couldn't breath and released only to immediately kiss his other cheek while he rose and fell against Draco's heaving chest.
But as he found himself sprinting thought the trees, Harry heard his name being called from behind, and he wanted to turn around in the hopes it was all a dream, that this insane, sick, toxic night was fake. That Draco was the real one.
"I won't move until you come up here with me," Harry opened his eyes. "The view's amazing. Hurry up, I have a head ache."
Draco pinned him up against the countertop with his hips, his legs trapping him on either side. He reached for the bag of flour and Harry struggled as Draco took the bag and dumped it over Harry's head.
"Get out, then. Really. If you're so inclined," Draco sneered. But he expected Harry to stand still, breakdown in his arms so he could hug him and kiss him.
He'd grown so much over the summer, at least three inches taller. His arms, and his legs and torso had, too, leaving stretch marks that Draco hated.
Harry, after a bit of silence and no movement, nodded his head and looked into Draco's eyes. Draco lay down next to Harry on the bed. It felt like a key into a lock when they were together, fitting one another perfectly.
He took a step back and blushed. But curiosity got the best of him and peeked through the crack he'd just created.
"I've waited days to see you. I've had nightmares. I just want to sleep." He moved to climb through it. "We're adults."
Dumbledore explained how the maze was to go, but Draco couldn't hear, couldn't think. He just stared at Harry, burning holes in the back of this head. Diggory stood next to him, readying himself since they could go first, although the Hufflepuff went unnoticed by Draco. He only saw Harry.
"He made me do it. I wanted to defend you but he would have killed my friends, my family. He would have killed you, too, and I can't bare letting you go," he choked. "I love you, Harry."
“I can’t wait either. What are you doing tonight? Oh just going out to dinner with my husband, no big deal or anything,” Harry smiled, “Me and my husband are visiting Paris, sorry I won’t be in touch!”
"I'm fine, just detention problems," Harry nodded his head. Draco had finally joined him on the couch. In his head, he was chanting 'go away,' over and over.
He had a full-length mirror, a large wardrobe, and a lumpy leather couch. His walls were barren, except a few Slytherin posters and golden snitch stickers.
"Maybe if you did it right, you'd feel better, but obviously you're too unintelligent to even comprehend what I'm saying," Draco taunted. "Maybe that's why Umbridge hates you, because you're a bloody idiot."
Draco couldn't help it: he grabbed Harry's face and forced their lips together, completely catching Harry off guard, and he found his lips against Harry's teeth. Harry, although tense from the surprise, relaxed into it, and fixed them so their lips where in between each others. Harry strictly moved his lips, and Draco felt along the length of Harry's back, caressing the smooth skin, and he tried pulling him tighter. To help, Harry scooted forward, but then had to let go of the kiss to cry in the soreness he felt along his hips.
"What if I really don't like him, like I think I do and some disease is going to clear up in a few weeks, and it'll just be awkward."
Mr. Greengrass spoke in greed. "We wanted it in writing. Her birthday is on February 10th so they are set to be married by February 20th 1999 to ensure they are of a legal age of course." Then he put a hand on Astoria's shoulder, almost like he was a predator looking down at a mouse. "Dear, sign it."
"Okay but give him a few days so he can comprehend that because I'm pretty sure he can't even think straight right now," Draco laughed.
"It was inspired by Fred's first date technique. He always tried going back and forth between insults and jokes, but I thought it'd be good for compatibility. If someone isn't meant for you, it'll display more insults. If they are, you both get compliments."
"If not expelled, his hand will fall off from being tortured. I don't even think he remembers the bet. I'm the one who always thought about it. I always have to win, and look, now we've both lost. He was trying to help people."
"It's not our fault we're too adorable to function," Harry almost laughed as he pulled Draco into an alcove just after potions. "We were just born like that," he whispered as the girls passed.
But still, Draco couldn't find peace within himself. Was he willing to risk his father basically murdering him for someone he was just dating?
At the fifth tree, nausea overcame him as the sight of Harry's face filled his vision without him even asking.
Flickering between a dull grey and a bright, loving mercury, they were. Harry got up and stepped towards Draco and kneeled next to him to get a better glance.
"Objection! You're just a 17 year old child! What would you even know about the subject of law and what is just or not!"
Harry nodded. "Yeah, but at least one night here, I have to visit Dr. Valerie. I figured I would on Tuesdays."
"I crashed on the couch." Harry was a pro at coming out with lies lately. Hermione saw through him. Big time. She couldn't stop smiling at him the rest of the study session.
Harry pulled the covers over him and faced the other way. The doors opened and heels clicked to Harry's bed. "Potter, are you awake," McGonagall asked.
“Very generic, but sure I’ll take it,” Draco commented. They both agreed on it, however in the back of their minds, they both were plotting as to what that entitled them to, making a secret scheme to make the experience more… interesting.
Draco thought for a bit and Harry stroked his arm with lights fingers, "How about a flat to start out with, a nice one though, and then when we want to expand, we do it into a house."
Within minutes, Madame Maxine ushered Fleur from the maze. Her pale skin was littered with dark bruises, blood, and dirt.
"Harry, don't cause trouble," Hermione scolded.  "He's a prefect. You don't want to go about messing with him. Again."
Draco leant back against his wall, facing his mirror. He reached for the tie on his silk pajama bottoms and pulled on the string, imaging it to be Harry.
"Since we were fourteen, yes! Do you want me to go back and get him so you can interview us? I thought there was a war going on."
"No. I'm not disgusted by you. You're forced to do this. You don't have free will. Draco, I understand if you don't do this, you'll die."
He spent the next hour wondering the same things, examining the locket, it hissing when he touched it, until he'd almost fallen asleep in a pile of sodden leaves painted in cold dirt.
But Harry wouldn't bother him. He tried to talk to him one time, but he couldn't, and Draco just pushed him away. The Gryffindor constantly kept his thoughts on Draco involuntarily, trying to figure him out. He wouldn't sleep. He's imagine Draco laying in bed next to him, them laughing at a cheesy joke or nuzzling their noses against each other. Harry wanted that again, but with the old Draco. A Draco that didn't exist anymore.
"I have a few reasons," Harry crossed his arms. "One being influenza can only last up to two weeks, from then on its severity is the same as the common cold. Two: the common flu cannot eat your lungs out, just make them flemmy-"
Harry awoke to a large amount of chatter an hour later, only to open his eyes and see everyone surrounding a body on the bed next to him. After his vision cleared, he noticed a flicker of platinum blonde hair and he tried to get up, but his body held him back.
"Okay," Harry took a step back, giving himself a second to breathe. "I just need to know you're okay. I'm not going to hurt you. Ever. Not like this. If you don't want to go all the way, you don't have to. I should have made that clear in the beginning of the night. I'm sorry I didn't."
They then changed separately and climbed into the bed, getting under the covers. They both gave each other a smile. "Merry Christmas, Harry."
"Take this back," Draco threw Harry's old Gryffindor hoodie at his head only after he walked from his room.
Draco glanced up to Harry across the room. He was focused on the board in front of him—no he wasn't. He knew. He wore a blush and bit his lip. The bastard knew Draco was literally struggling to not orgasm right then and there!
"Which means he wants to see me." Draco grew animated, almost excited. "Please. It's been days. And then I won't see him for months."
Draco jabbed his shoulder and then lunged at him, wrapping his arms around his neck, tears still falling. He knocked him backwards, pinning him down and sobbing his face into his neck and sobbing in it. "Y-you're alive! You're alive," he wept.
One night later in March, the two were walking back from dinner, hand in hand, when Ron approached them.
"My memory is torn. It's unstable. There's nothing you can do about it, and maybe that's how it's supposed to be. Maybe you're not supposed to love me in the first place, and maybe it was just an accident, and the universe is trying to fix it."
Ron put a head in his hand. "I swear if I wake up and Draco Malfoy is my Step-Dad, I'm going back to St. Mungo's."
Draco picked him up and carried him to the bed, wrapping his arms around him as they settled in. Harry's body felt smaller than it did a week ago when they were in the hospital wing.
Harry saw that, too, and as a result, he cackled, burring his head in his arms which were supporting him on the table, his body bobbing up and down.
"Oh plenty. But that's classified," Harry said, pushing his food to his cheek and taking a bit of pumpkin juice to help it down. Draco shoved at his shoulder and his mouth opened. Harry looked down at him, swallowing. "You know, jealousy doesn't look good on you."
"But the Prophet changed after the war," Draco pouted, recalling the article of his trial. It was just the facts; nothing was made up. Same with all the other articles, except from Skeeter who almost got fired.
"Fuck, you're so beautiful," Harry looked up and down his body, the way he moved to him, the way he twisted his hip and his muscles contracted and relaxed. Draco whimpered. "Will you marry me?"
He moved up his leg slightly, and Draco jerked his hips back at the unfamiliar sensation. "Harry," he whispered, but when Harry bit the tender skin slightly, he jerked about ten times harder and shouted, "Harry!"
"Oh, Merlin," he put his head in his hands, and his shoulders shook, his sobs ringing through the deathly still hall. "What if I lose him?"
Harry wrapped his arms around his waist and carried him over the edge. "What are you doing? Let me down. Potter, I swear if you put me down there, we're done—"
“B-b-beca-ause,” he shivered, not able to control his mouth from shaking, it was almost hard to understand him, “You-you w-w-w-ere ssssstupid!”
Then, Harry shoved his body off of him before taking his hand and running up another landing, slamming open a door to the nearest bedroom. Draco spun him around and kissed him. They walked backwards to the bed and fell onto it, friction driving them both wild as Harry climbed on top of him and sat on his hips. He moved to Draco's mouth and kissed him fiercely, tongue in, tongue out, fast and lovely and luxuriously. Draco bit Harry's lip before sucking on it, driving Harry into thoughtless pleasure. He didn't think as he reached forward, pulling Draco's blazer hard enough to rip the button.
