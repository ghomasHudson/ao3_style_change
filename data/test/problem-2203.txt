“Somewhere like Ireland?” Harry asks, because he wants to make sure he understands what Draco’s saying, “You want to move to Ireland with me? You’re serious?”
Harry nips at Draco’s bottom lip, tries to pull back and just think for a second, but Draco surges forward, twisting his fingers into Harry’s hair to keep him close.
“Be patient, I want this to be good for you. Want to ruin you for anyone else,” Draco replies possessively.
in a way it hadn’t before. Almost tangible. And the most amazing thing about it all is, Draco loves him too.
Harry presses his mouth against Draco’s ear, his hot breath causing the hair on the back of Draco’s neck to stand up, “You need to leave Draco. I’m not signing those fucking papers today and if you ever bring up another man in front of me again, I promise I’ll remind you who you really belong to,” Harry whispers roughly.
“You’ve went out of your way to hurt him in the past,” she states and Draco can’t deny it’s true, so he doesn’t.
When Harry glances up he finds Draco looking at him with soft affection and his heart starts to beat fast behind his ribs as Draco crosses the room.
“Merlin, I don’t know,” Draco says, nervously twirling a small trowel in his hands, “We’re friends but sometimes I think there’s something more there. Sometimes he looks at me and—Stori, no one has ever looked at me like that before.”
Draco does as he’s told, sipping his tea and watching as Andromeda scoops the little boy up. He does look tired, small fist rubbing at his eyes and stuffed  Hippogriff clutched tightly to his chest. Andromeda disappears up the stairs and after a moment Draco can hear her voice drift down from the floor above, singing softly.
Draco prepares himself for the backlash but it never comes. His father just smirks meanly and looks at Draco like they’re both in on a some big joke.
He looks up, his own cock twitching and pulsing at the sight of Potter teetering on the edge. His head is tipped back, mouth red and kiss swollen and hanging open. His eyes are closed, dark lashes brushing his flushed cheeks.
She hands Draco a cream-colored piece of parchment, sealed closed with the Malfoy crest. He’s baffled for a moment before he realizes what it must be.
Harry’s face falls but Draco refuses to feel guilty. He isn’t going to pretend that he and Harry are on friendly terms. Granted, Draco had rather expected more anger on Harry’s part considering how things ended between them.
Harry jolts awake, ripped suddenly from sleep and shoved back to reality. He’s in bed, alone, the blankets twisted around his legs. His shirt is sticking to his skin uncomfortably, sweat soaking through the fabric.
“I think you should do it,” Draco says, shuffling the papers nervously, “We could get a flat together.”
And suddenly, he can’t wait even a second longer. He pulls his fingers free, wiping them on the sheets before he grabs Malfoy and flips him over.
Harry holds his own cock steady as Draco lifts up a bit and shuffles forward. Then he’s sinking down, slow and perfect. He’s so warm and tight, his body pulling Harry in until he’s fully seated. Harry breathes out, unsteady, and suddenly overwhelmed.
Harry’s rumbling stomach finally breaks the quiet moment, so he grabs the menu for his favorite pizza place off the coffee table.
“What would your adoring fans say if they could see you now, Potter? Do you think they’d still worship the ground you walk on if they knew?” Draco asks in a taunting voice, because he just can't help himself.
Draco’s face flushes. He does miss his mother, although maybe he shouldn’t. Maybe he should still be angry at her for fucking off to France with his father, effectively abandoning him.
They’re standing so close and Malfoy’s breath is sweet as it mingles with his own. He probably had wine with his dinner, and Harry wants a taste. He brings their lips together, his tongue dipping inside as a groan rumbles in his chest.
The thought of that, of someone seeing them and knowing that Draco belongs to him, makes Harry’s cock twitch, suddenly so hard it hurts. Draco must like the idea too, because he whines, rubbing against Harry again, harder this time.
“Fuck,” Draco whispers to himself. He feels completely disconnected from his body. His legs unsteady, the effort of keeping his knees from giving out almost too much. He wants to sink to the ground. Wants to let himself fall and take Harry with him.
Harry groans miserably, “Yeah but Robards hates me. He’ll probably partner us together out of spite.”
“Hermione, I love you dearly but if you think I’m moving right now you’re mad,” Draco says glancing at Harry, who gives him a nod and a reassuring smile.
“I know,” Harry’s takes a shuddering breath before continuing, “I know we have a lot to talk about but. I need you to tell me. Tell me you’re mine Draco. I need to know you’ll still be here in the morning.”
Harry arches against him as best he can from his trapped position. It’s sloppy, uncoordinated. They’re still learning all the ways they fit together.
—and glares at Harry, “One of those blasted Love-O-Grams exploded all over me when I dropped Scorpius off this morning.”
“It’s brilliant,” Harry says entranced. He runs his fingers lightly over the tattoo, frowning when it doesn’t move or react to his touch. “Is it magical?”
Maybe they can just skip the date. Draco would be happy with dragging Harry back to his room and locking them inside for the night.
As silence once again stretches out between them, Harry tries to stop his brain from dredging up all the things he never lets himself examine too closely. It’s harder than it should be.
Potter’s mouth is hot, his tongue wicked as it teases and caresses. He laves at Draco’s fingers, moaning around them as his eyelids drop closed.
“You’re pathetic. Do you really think that Potter is a poof?” his father asks with a sharp laugh, “Even if he was, he’d never chose
There’s a pile of soft blankets laid out on the floor, cushioning charms already cast to make it even more comfortable, and the champagne and chocolate covered strawberries are set to the side staying fresh under stasis charms.
“Honestly, Malfoy,” Potter finally says, shrugging a shoulder, “I don’t know why either, but what I do know is I like you. You’re not bad company when you aren’t being an arsehole and I’d like to get to know you better,” Potter holds a hand out, a small smile tilting his lips.
Draco doesn’t particularly like being side-alonged. Honestly, he doesn’t like Apparating much at all. It always makes his stomach twist unpleasantly but he’s too damn tired to argue. He sighs and grips Kade’s outstretched arm.
“What the fuck was that, Malfoy?” Harry stalks closer, spitting the words into the space left between them.
Astoria wishes them a good evening and then Harry lifts their clasped hands, kissing Draco’s knuckles before Apparating them away without warning. Draco’s stomach tries to drop out through his feet and he stumbles when they land a moment later.
“That’s great Ron. I can’t wait to come and see it for myself,” Harry’s already thinking that he can take Teddy and make a weekend trip out of it.
“I’m just asking what you’re planning to do about your job, your flat,” Harry says as he takes one of Draco’s hands and threads their fingers together, “I just want to know if you’ve thought about what not walking away means.”
Hermione gives him a small smile and then walks across the room to sit beside him on the bed. “Don’t you have to be at work soon?”
He hits Draco’s prostate with a perfect accuracy, lighting up Draco’s body, making his nerve endings spark brightly.
Harry hauls him to his feet and then his hand is wrapping around Draco’s still hard cock, pumping up and down, squeezing lightly and twisting on the upstroke. Just how Draco likes. It only takes a few minutes and Harry’s lips against his neck and then Draco is coming too.
“What if I had someone else do the article?” Harry throws back, unwilling to let go of the desire to
Harry feels the loneliness settle over him, cold and heavy, like a giant slab of ice slamming into his chest, going right down to his very core.
Harry complies, first adding more of the silky lube before pushing back in. Draco’s body yields to the intrusion quickly, opening up beautifully and pulling Harry’s fingers deeper.
Draco shifts from foot to foot, mentally berating himself for allowing Harry to make him uncomfortable. Somehow, he had forgotten what it’s like to have that intense green gaze fixed on him.
God, it’s so good, Draco’s mouth stretched wide around his cock, his lips shiny wet and red. Draco bobs his head, twirling his tongue as he comes back up and Harry sees stars. His hips jerk up, Draco gags a little but doesn’t slow down or move to stop Harry from fucking into the heat of his mouth. So Harry grabs a handful of silky blonde hair and thrusts again, harder this time. Drool leaks out of Draco’s mouth, running down the side of Harry’s cock and dripping onto his balls, and he’s so close.
The process calms his mind, he doesn’t need to think about his next step, each action long ago ingrained into his brain. It’s cathartic. He loses himself in it, allowing his mind to wander into white noise, not thinking anything of importance. There are no thoughts of how much he has to get done today, no worries over Scorpius or Astoria, and most importantly, there are no thoughts of bright green eyes shining in the sunlight or the deep laugh that sends chills down his spine or the crooked smile he’d never before seen directed at him.
A world where Malfoy didn’t exist to antagonize him didn’t make sense, and at the time, that was all the reason Harry had needed.
“Please don’t do this. You don’t have to push me away,” Potter says earnestly. He runs a hand through his hair and charges on, “And don’t say that I don’t know you, because I do. I fucking
“Draco and Harry are making chili, Ron. Keep up,” Hermione replies flippantly, “We didn’t mean to interrupt. We just wanted to drop these off.”
Draco’s impression of Harry is terrible and has them both laughing again. They calm down after a few minutes, and Harry grabs the shower gel from the shelf and rubs soapy hands over Draco’s back. He moves around to Draco’s chest, then down both arms to link their fingers together.
Harry’s pulse quickens as he thinks of the way Draco had looked standing on his doorstep yesterday, his mask slipping and for a mere second, Harry was able to see the emotion he was trying to hide. His hair’s longer now, longer than Harry ever remembers seeing it. The fine blond strands had been pulled up into a knot on top of Draco’s head, a few pieces escaping and falling down around his face. And his eyes. Blue-grey and breathtaking. The color of the sea before a storm.
He rolls over, stretching his tight muscles and letting out a big yawn. The sun is filtering into the bedroom through the open window, bringing with it a warm breeze and the sound of birds chirping.
“Great,” Potter says with a nod. He finishes the last drink of his second frappuccino and stands from the table, the bubble they seem to be existing in bursting with the movement, “I’ll owl you a time and place?”
Draco makes a wrecked sound as Harry pulls his fingers free. “Shh. I’ve got you, gonna give you what you want.” Harry quickly slicks himself up, hisses as he strokes his cock in a few fast pulls, then he’s pressing the head against Draco’s open hole. He slides inside, so easy, no resistance in Draco’s body at all. “Been too fucking long,” he chokes out, voice rough and barely controlled, “Need you, fuck Draco, love you so much.”
He steps through the door and into Astoria’s office, his eyes sweeping the room. The office is big, with plenty of space for the impressive mahogany desk, two armchairs, and the bookshelves crammed full of thick volumes on Magical Law and Ethics. The walls are decorated with photographs and artwork, along with a framed degree from a Muggle university.
Harry swallows the contents quickly, knowing from experience that it’s better to get it over with. He fills the empty mug on his bedside table with an Aguamenti and drinks deeply before collapsing back onto the bed, dreading the miserable night ahead.
Malfoy starts to move, slowly rutting down against Harry, the hard length of his cock rubbing against Harry’s own. Malfoy’s movements are teasing, patient, as if Harry isn’t sitting there burning from the inside out.
“Hello, Potter,” Draco greets when he reaches the drawing room, pulling Potter into their normal one arm hug. The boys are standing with their heads close together, already in deep discussion about what kind of snowman they want to build.
When the pizza arrives an hour later, they all gather around the coffee table in the living room and tuck in, only the light from the Christmas tree and the glow of the television allowing them to see their plates.
Harry snorts, and Hermione looks at him with one eyebrow raised in question. “No, actually I don’t. I quit.”
Draco feels like he’s floating away up into the clouds, leaving everything—every regret, every insecurity—behind on the ground. He feels weightless. Free.
“You want this?” Harry asks. But he doesn’t let Malfoy answer, instead he captures his lips in a kiss, because Harry just can’t help himself. He crowds close again, rolling his hips and lifting a hand to tug at the short hairs at the base of Malfoy’s neck.
Draco can’t deny that he’s excited. He’s never really been on a date before. The courting he was expected to do in regards to Astoria doesn’t really count.
Ron shakes his head. “No, I couldn’t sleep. Heard you get up and figured I’d come see if you were ready to talk.”
“Breaking and entering,” Draco interrupts with a gasp of fake surprise, one hand clutching his chest, “And to think, they were going to let you become an Auror.”
Draco wakes up the next morning to a throbbing head and a sour taste in his mouth. His stomach lurches as he rolls over, paper crinkling under his cheek as he does so. He forces his eyes open and lets out a thankful groan at the closed blinds. Draco can’t remember much of the previous night. He has no idea how he managed to get back to his hotel or why there seems to be a stack of paper under his head instead of a pillow.
“And what would your father say, Malfoy, if he knew how you love to get on your knees for me? How you beg me for it.”
But Draco isn’t that person anymore, he was never really that person to begin with. Things might not be perfect between them but Draco has to acknowledge that he’s the happiest he’s been since he left England. And it’s not as if Kade is suggesting they run off and get married this minute. Draco will have plenty of time to explain everything about his past and if Kade changes his mind after he knows the truth, well, Draco’ll deal with the fallout then.
Harry slowly drags his knees up and out, leaving his chest pressed flat against the bed. Before he can become too self conscious about being on such blatant display, Draco’s mouth begins to move back down, following the same path as before, only in reverse.
“You’ve been distracted for weeks. Are we ever going to talk about it?” she questions with a smile but Draco can see the concern lurking behind it.
Honesty has seemed to work well so far, something they never tried in their adolescence, so Harry tells him the truth.
Draco reaches out and pushes Harry’s messy curls back from his forehead gently, not wanting to wake him when he looks so young and untroubled in his sleep. But Harry stirs against him at the touch, pressing a kiss to Draco’s shoulder before he even opens his eyes.
He rolls his shoulders, pulls his hair up into a knot at the top of his head, and starts on his list of tasks that need completed. Draco is meticulous in his movements; watering, pruning, harvesting. This is his routine, every morning he spends two hours in the greenhouse, tending to the vast array of plants and ingredients that are fundamental to his mail order potion business.
“Jesus, Draco,” Harry lets his fingers graze that spot again and again, “You’re beautiful. So fucking amazing.”
“Crook your fingers up,” and Harry does, Draco’s body jolting and arching when he rubs against the sensitive bundle of nerves, “Ah, ah, fuck. Yes—right there.”
Hermione must notice as well because she discreetly casts a charm that Draco isn’t familiar with, causing the Muggles in the café to suddenly turn their attention elsewhere.
“Fuck,” Draco snarls, reclaiming his fingers and looking at the indentations Potter’s teeth have left behind.
When everyone is too cold and wet to stay outside any longer, they head inside, sitting close to the fire and sipping hot chocolate. Astoria joins them and the knowing look that crosses her face as she glances back and forth between them does not make Draco’s jittery anxiety any better.
Draco shakes his head, pushing those thoughts to the back of his mind and turns from the window. He slowly makes his way back to the bedroom, hesitating only a moment before crawling back into bed and wrapping his arms around Kade’s sleeping form.
“It’s just, you must really care about him. I’ve never seen you put this much thought, let alone research, into a gift before.”
“Okay, we’re set. Give me your wrist,” Harry says, suddenly standing back in front of Draco, shaking him from thoughts of kisses and Harry’s wandering hands.
With Harry’s guidance and greedy hands, Draco improves as they move forward through the course, sinking a few more hole in ones. When they step up to take the last, very complicated looking shot, Harry halts him with a hand on his wrist.
“Obviously,” Lucius answers, and Draco thinks with his fathers skewed worldview he probably truly believes that he would be. Lucius has never been one to acknowledge his own flaws or take responsibility for his actions.
Draco’s eyes fall shut at his words and Harry closes the last bit of distance between them. His hands come up and gently frame Draco’s face, tilting it down towards him as he leans in. Draco brings his own hands up and clutches tightly at Harry’s wrists.
“Thank you,” Harry says softly. He doesn't really believe Remus’ words but he’s grateful for them all the same.
They land, both a bit unsteady, right next to the bed and Harry is already moving to pull his shirt off.
“You got it,” Harry says with a laugh. He presses a kiss to the top of Draco’s head and slides out of bed.
Draco stares at her, shocked silent. He’s sure his mouth is hanging open in the most undignified way, but he can’t seem to do anything to close it.
Never one to back down from a competition with Potter, Draco nods and they both climb up to the top of the biggest hill.
The hand Potter has resting on his lower back dips down under his shirt just as his tongue does something complicated in Draco’s mouth, and rough fingertips finally touch skin. Draco’s nerves come to life, tingling and buzzing at the contact.
And alright, yes. He did enjoy them; in bed, naked, with Potter, who licked the melted chocolate from his fingers. Of course Draco enjoyed it.
When Harry returns he asks if Draco is sure about doing the interview, his look of concern replaced with a lopsided smile when Draco assures that he is. They fall into comfortable silence then, sipping their drinks as the noisy buzz of the party ebbs and flows around them.
Draco, knowing that there’s no way he’ll be sleeping again anytime soon, gets out of bed and quietly pads out to the living room. He walks over to the huge windows that make up the entire south wall of his apartment and looks out over New York City.
When they finally break apart they’re both breathing heavy and Draco’s own arousal makes itself known, having been firmly on the back burner until now.
Draco nods and then startles slightly as Kade pulls him in for a tight hug. “I’ll miss you Draco Black,” Kade whispers against Draco’s ear, before pulling back and placing a soft kiss to the skin of his forehead.
Draco wastes no time, swallowing down Harry’s entire length. He hums in pleasure at the taste of precome hitting his tongue and he slowly starts to bob his head up and down. One hand moves in sync with his mouth, while the other grips Harry’s thigh tightly.
“I’m in love with Draco Malfoy,” Harry whispers, and it’s the first time he’s said the words out loud. It’s freeing, cathartic in a way, to finally admit what he’s been keeping locked inside for so long.
When he steps out into the grand drawing room at the Manor, he’s greeted by a house elf he has come to know, and grow quite fond of, during his many visits over the last few weeks.
Ron doesn’t look convinced, but he drops it and starts telling Harry about a new product him and George are working on for the joke shop. Harry listens,
“Do I like it?” Draco murmurs almost to himself, “Harry. This is—Do you have any idea how rare these are? Of course, I love it.”
Another inch, and it’s starting to feel good now. Every inch deeper makes sparks shoot through his body, every sound of pleasure from Draco’s lips send waves of satisfaction down his spine. Harry slowly lifts back up, and then in one smooth motion, slides back down—all the way down, until their bodies are flush against one another.
They all take their shots and then the conversation continues to flow easily, more easily than Draco could have ever imagined. These people have no reason to make him feel welcome, yet they are.
Harry nods and quickly obeys, gripping the pillow above his head, knuckles turning white as he holds on tightly.
“Wait here. I’ll go get us tickets,” Harry says. Draco feels rough lips brush his forehead and then Harry is walking towards a small booth manned by a bored looking girl.
This place was used by a wizard who practiced the worse kind of dark magic, years and years passing by before anyone even knew it was here. And then there were the dementors, and the prisoners came. Draco thinks someone should have burnt the place to the ground a long time ago but he knows it’s not that simple. He’d bet his last Galleon that the prison is sentient.
He steps closer, securing the green and silver scarf around Potter’s neck. Then their eyes meet and Draco hears Potter’s breath catch. Draco feels a jolt go down his spine at the sound.
Those hands leave his hips a moment later and make quick work of his own button and zipper. Harry doesn’t hesitate before reaching inside and drawing out Draco’s cock, but his movements are cautious at first, weighing it in his hands and squeezing gently. Draco moans as Harry rubs a thumb over the tip, spreading the wetness around, making his entire length slick when more follows.
Potter alternates between light, teasing flicks with his tongue and hard, sucking licks. Every once in a while Draco feels the hint of teeth, biting at him, and it has him pushing forward against Potter’s face.
Tormenting Harry Potter has always been one of Draco’s favorite things, just because they’re together now doesn’t mean he’ll stop. He grins at the broken off whine that leaves Harry’s lips and lifts his head.
“Snowman or sledding first?” Draco asks Potter, who’s watching as the boys fall to their backs, making small snow angels on the ground.
Once there, Harry swallows his nerves and thrusts out a hand, “It was nice seeing you Malfoy, I’ll be in touch about the play date.”
So this thing, with the choking and the rough sex, it’s a delicate balancing act. Something Harry has to wield perfect control over. And Malfoy...lets him. He allows Harry to have that control, trusts him not to take it too far.
She sighs. “It was from Draco,” Ah there it is. Hermione pauses, waiting for a reaction Harry assumes. When he doesn’t give one, she continues, “I’m guessing that doesn’t surprise you since he mentioned stopping by. I’m also guessing that you don’t care to tell me how that went?”
Beams of early morning sunlight are coming in through the window, warming Draco’s closed eyelids and slowly rousing him. He rolls over, away from the light, and pulls the blankets tighter around him. For those few precious seconds, he forgets.
Adrenaline is pumping through his body, making his heartbeat pound in his ears and his hands shake throughout the entire process of signing out and retrieving his wand. Draco’s swinging quickly from anger at his father to self loathing and then back again.
, he’s the only one allowed to see Draco like this, wrecked and begging. The pleading words and broken sounds for his ears only. “You’re mine.”
“Yes, and your dad is still sleeping. Why don’t you all go and wake him up while I finish this,” Harry suggests with a smirk, “You may have to really jump on him!” He yells after them as they rush up the stairs.
“No. Draco I can’t. You left more than just Harry behind when you took off. I know you thought we all just tolerated you for Harry’s sake but we loved you too. You were one of my best friends and you just left,” Draco catches a quick glimpse of the wetness on Hermione’s lashes before she turns away and storms out.
Draco winds his way through the crowded shop, finding a small table in the corner near the window. Draco sits and watches the people pass by on the sidewalk outside, firmly keeping his eyes away from where Potter stands across the room.
Thoughts of being inside Malfoy, of that tight heat holding him so perfectly, make him move quicker, muttering a spell to produce silky lube in the palm of his hand. Harry coats two fingers and Malfoy pulls his own legs up without being told, a soft smile on his face.
“And you think you could be one?” Draco asks snidely. The days where he sat back and took his fathers shit long over.
Malfoy and Blaise start arguing, almost instantly, over the proper way to ingest Gillyweed, which amuses Harry to no end. He sips his wine and watches as the others join the debate, Malfoy eventually getting so riled up that he climbs onto the sofa to wave his arms around dramatically. The scene is made all the more funny by the fact that someone has managed to get a bright pink
Kade grabs his wrist to stop him and Draco hopes that he might be rethinking taking Draco up on his offer.
“Wouldn’t say there’s much that’s bloody good about it,” Draco grumbles as he takes a seat and pops the bubble covering his food.
“Wait, shit, Draco s-stop,” Harry stutters, pulling Draco off, “Wanna come inside you. Want you to ride me.”
“Why on Earth would you need my wrist?” Draco asks as he eyes the bright pink slip of paper in Harry’s hand.
In the morning, Harry wakes up too hot. He glances down at Draco, asleep on his chest, and knows the smile on his face probably looks ridiculously sappy. But he doesn’t care.
“I need to talk to you,” Harry finally manages to answer. He takes a few steps closer, hating the way Draco watches him wearily, when only a few weeks ago he was so comfortable around Harry.
Thinking back it still makes Draco want to smile like a love-sick fool so he quickly cuts off that train of thought before he does or says something he’ll most definitely regret and instead focuses on trying to keep his knees from buckling.
But something tells Harry that it isn’t just attraction that draws him to Malfoy. It’s more than that. Harry
“Yes, as a matter of fact. I’m in desperate need of a break. Just let me—” Draco replies, waving his wand over the cauldron to complete the potion and then extinguishes the flame.
Ottery St. Catchpole is dark and quiet around him as he sits on the stoop, fishing the half-crushed pack of cigarettes from his pocket and uses his wand to light the tip of one. He takes a long drag, savoring the way it burns the back of his throat and immediately calms his shattered nerves. The sour smell of smoke hangs in the air around him, and he knows he’ll have to cast a freshening charm over his clothes before he goes back inside. Hermione will hex his bollocks off if she finds out he’s smoking again.
“Malfoy!” Ron yells from across the garden, clearly already in his cups as he practically tackles Draco to the ground before pulling him into a tight embrace, “It’s good to see you Draco.”
His eyes scan the tables and land on a blonde head tucked in the back corner, and suddenly, Harry forgets all about his earlier grumblings. Because there’s Malfoy, covered in red glitter, furiously trying to brush the stubborn particles from his clothes.
“Um yeah,” Potter laughs a little nervously, “You do drink coffee right? I mean, it’s fine if you don’t. We could get something else or—something,” Potter stammers out, looking more embarrassed the longer he talks. Draco absolutely does not find it endearing.
“Shower here and borrow something to wear,” Harry says with a wave of his hand, “We won’t be there that long, so you’ll have plenty of time to get your work done later.”
Draco turns away and forces his legs to carry him back out the door and into the chilly evening air.
Once in the kitchen, Draco scoops Scorpius up and sits him on the counter. Draco gets to work cutting up an apple, spreading creamy peanut butter on each slice. Scorpius shoves bite after bite into his mouth, having to be told numerous times to slow down.
The early morning light coming in through the gap of the curtains is making his eyes sting, so he closes them, pinching the bridge of his nose hard as he wills the tears away. But it’s no use, they still fall.
“Never removed you,” Harry mumbles. Draco turns in his arms and raises an eyebrow. Harry just gives him a sheepish smile, “Morning.”
“Why didn’t you tell me?” Draco demands, “How hard would it have been to send a bloody owl! You should have..” Draco lets the words trail off, sighing heavily.
Draco returns his mothers embrace tightly. Then without another word, Narcissa leads Draco back into the house leaving Harry and Kade standing a mere few feet apart from each other.
“How about this, we can just order something simple, “ Harry suggests, “Oh, how do you feel about pepperoni, mushrooms, and sausage?”
Draco wants to move his hand, wants to grab his cock and stroke it until he comes. But his hands won’t cooperate, staying clenched around the edge of the desk, like they're the only thing tethering him to this plane of existence.
Harry drags a hand through his hair, and Draco’s eyes track the movement. He can’t wait to get home and feel the silky stands sliding through his own fingers. Can’t wait to pull Harry close and press their lips together with no worry of who might be watching.
“I’m sorry," Draco mumbled, feeling about five years old, "But you’re going to have to get over it, because I’ve already invited her and Teddy to the wedding.”
The garden is beautiful this time of year, teeming with life. There are flowers blooming everywhere you look. There’s a stone patio off to the right, a large glass top table dominating the space. Narcissa and a man, who Harry assumes is Kade, sit together at the table, a tea service and a platter of small sandwiches in front of them.
Malfoy wanders off, over to the other corner of the room where Harry sees Pansy Parkinson sitting primly and eyeing him with uncertainty.
At the moment, another smile is lighting up Draco’s face, and Harry grips his beer so tight he’s afraid the glass might crack to pieces in his hand. That smile, all perfect white teeth and eyes crinkling, has his heart speeding up, and Harry wants to fucking hex Nott right in his stupid face.
“What?” Draco glances over, watches as Potter swiftly closes the distance between them to grab him up in a hard kiss.
He’d be lying if he said he wasn’t nervous though. The party isn’t going to be a big one, just Draco’s closest friends, must of whom Harry has already met. But Draco’s mother will also be in attendance today and Harry has no idea what to expect.
The rest of the afternoon passes in a dazed blur. He knows they eat lunch, and he definitely holds Teddy at one point. He thanks his Aunt repeatedly for welcoming him so graciously into her home, and smiles when she tells him to stop by anytime. But through all of it, Draco is quietly freaking out, internally screaming at himself for letting this happen and wondering what he could have done differently to prevent it. But he quickly realises that it’s pointless. The damage is done, and he knows nothing would have stopped him from falling for Harry.
“Oh don’t start being difficult, you’ll make us late,” Kade scolds lightly, “Come on,” he says, offering Draco his arm.
Draco clutches his chest in mock surprise, “A compliment, Potter? I never thought I’d see the day,” Draco teases.
Draco nods and grants him a small smile as he distractedly continues to devour his breakfast. He enjoys the silence as he eats and watches amused, as his boyfriend moves around his kitchen with easy familiarity.
While Draco knows he’s no troll, he doesn’t think he’s anything all that special either. He’s too tall and lanky, his features too sharp to be considered classically attractive but he can’t deny the look of desire on Potter’s face.
“I did what was expected of me. I got the job and the girl and had the kids but it—“ Harry cuts himself off, struggling to articulate what he means without sounding like a selfish bastard, “I love my kids, I love them so much and wouldn’t trade them for anything. But all of it, my entire life since the war, came about because I made choices I felt other people expected me to make, not because it was what I wanted.”
Narcissa Malfoy had wrote to Harry after the trials, thanking him, more gracious than he thought possible of a Malfoy at the time. But they haven’t spoken in years. Draco has assured Harry that his mother knows about their relationship and is happy for them, but Harry can’t shake the nervous anxiety thrumming through his body.
Which is why Harry has to physically restrain himself from storming across the room and snatching Draco away from Theo goddamn Nott, who’s leaning too close into Draco’s personal space, touching him and making him laugh.
“Looks like he’s occupied at the moment.” Harry’s jaw tenses, teeth grinding together as he watches Draco lay a hand on Nott’s shoulder. He can feel Ron searching his face, so he drops his eyes to the table.
“Huh, Viktor Krum, alright. That’s actually not what I was expecting,” Potter says, his brows drawn together in contemplation. But then his face smooths and an absolutely evil smile spreads over his face, “Oh my god, you were pining after Hermione’s date! I bet you were so jealous of her,” Potter teases but the words hit a little too close to home and Draco feels his face flush. Thankfully, Potter doesn’t notice through his laughter. Because Potter does not need to know that yes, Draco had been jealous but not because of Krum.
“How am I supposed to chose?” Malfoy asks in a tone that says he is personally affronted by the wide range of options available.
Harry eyes are wet and his throat is clogged with emotion, but he manages to nod and choke out, “God, I fucking love you.”
Feeling both protected and trapped, Draco can only stand there as emotions collide violently in his chest, wrapping up around his throat like a heavy chain and tightening. Suddenly, his breaths start coming quicker, his heart rate jumps into high gear, and Draco knows he has to get out of here.
“Yes ‘Mione, sorry,” Harry says with a grin, sounding like a kid who’s been caught with their hand in the biscuit jar. Hermione just rolls her eyes and leaves him to it.
“What are you coloring?” Harry asks, ruffling Scorp’s blonde hair as he plops back down at the table.
Suddenly, Potter is crowding him against the wall and Draco means to tell him to fuck off, but then Potter’s hands are coming up to cup his face, and his mouth snaps shut.
Draco swaps their positions in a seeker fast movement, spinning them and backing Harry up against the wall. Draco crowds in, lips still moving against Harry’s, and slouches down a bit to line up their bodies.
“Another time, I promise. Right now there’s something I wanted to talk to you about,” Potter says, dragging a hand through the mess he calls hair and Draco’s stomach drops.
Right. Draco’s birthday. That’s what he needs to focus on, it’s the whole point to this outing after all.
“Al!” squeals the miniature version of Malfoy that Harry hadn’t noticed. The boy is standing beside his father, pale fingers curled into the fabric of Malfoy’s trousers as he bounces excitedly.
Later that evening, Harry stands at the kitchen counter, laying out the ingredients that will soon become a spicy, hearty chili, perfect for the cold February night.
Draco lays a hand over his stomach and looks up at him, something like awe shining in his eyes. “Are you sure? Because we don’t have to, Harry.”
Finally, he bends Draco’s knees to his chest and Draco feels the head of his cock nudge against his slick entrance. Harry hesitates, gripping Draco’s thigh tightly.
With a string of expletives and Draco’s name, Harry comes, shooting down Draco’s throat, his body arching off the bed. He collapses back and throws an arm over his face, breaths coming fast as Draco licks him clean, not wanting to miss a single drop.
“I miss him,” Harry admits, his face immediately flushing with heat. He swallows thickly and forces the words out, “I don’t want to lose him, Astoria.”
Draco gulps in a big breath, silently wishing that he was able to absorb some courage out of thin air. He reminds himself that this is for Harry.
Harry pays Neville an obscene amount of Galleons, thanking him repeatedly for procuring the strange plant in time for Draco’s birthday and promises to visit at Hogwarts in the fall.
Eventually, his father speaks, asking after Scorpius. Draco jumps onto the subject with enthusiasm and tells him everything that Scorp has been up to lately. Draco recognizes the proud look that tilts his fathers lips. He saw it himself many times as a small child. But the older he got, the more his father looked at him with disdain and disappointment. Draco was never the son that Lucius Malfoy wanted.
Draco plants his bare feet against the cold floor and pushes himself up, hovering above Potter for only a moment, just the head of his cock still inside, and then he drops back down.
Ron makes a noise then, a half squeak, half groan, and Harry braces for impact. But Ron just sighs and changes the subject to work. As far as conversation topics go, it’s not much of an improvement.
Finally, Harry collapses down onto Draco and rests their foreheads together. “I love you,” Harry says simply, though the words seem inadequate. The way he feels about Draco is so much
So, Harry has waited at morning drop off and afternoon pick up, nervously chewing his lip with his eyes fixed on the Floo, willing a blonde head to emerge. He’s sat for hours in Starbucks, drinking more coffee than is strictly necessary, getting more jittery by the minute. He’s wrote letter after letter, his owl becoming more cross with each trip to Wiltshire, while his letters return unopened.
Harry dutifully takes the potion and gulps the water, instantly feeling the aches in his body and the throbbing in his head subside. He sits up and stretches his arms above his head, giving Hermione a sheepish smile before thanking her.
Draco doesn’t know how long they stand there like that, wrapped around each other. Potter blocks out the rest of the world, time passing is the furthest thing from Draco’s mind. Draco lets himself melt into the embrace, resting his head on Potter’s shoulder.
Harry decides it’s better not to disturb them. It isn’t often that their attention is held by anything for longer than a few seconds at a time, and he knows they’ll soon be invading the kitchen in search of food.
“Well, I’m in need of a strong drink. If you’ll excuse me,” Draco mutters quickly, making his escape over to the other end of the table. He pours himself a large glass of Firewhisky.
“Having a good time?” Harry asks and Draco nods. They’re sitting on a bench, Draco with his first ever bag of cotton candy and Harry with fried dough covered in powered sugar. They feed each other bites of their respective treats and talk about their favorite parts of the night.
“I don’t know!” Harry yells, pulling at his hair so hard his scalp tingles painfully, “I was relieved, happy even, to find him standing on my doorstep. Of course, that was before he opened his mouth,” A humorless laugh bubbles up his throat and escapes his lips, “And I would take him back if he asked, if that was what he wanted. I would do anything for him, anything. I still love him. I still love him so much it’s fucking killing me,” Harry’s voice echoes down the empty corridor. He pushes his glasses up and pinches the bridge of his nose, trying to blink the wetness from his eyes.
“Harry Potter, Savior of the Wizarding World and Dark Lord Vanquisher. Of course people expected it,” Malfoy says with a laugh, “But I was always under the impression that you enjoyed it?”
And it’s as if Potter was waiting for those words. Something—a hint of dark desire, sparks bright in those stupidly green eyes, and then his mouth is on Draco’s.
Malfoy, who takes Harry’s reaction as one of disapproval, immediately closes himself off. The shutters slam down, wiping every bit of openness from his face.
Draco’s neck has always been sensitive and it's one of Harry's favorite spots to kiss. He loves the salty, sweet taste of Draco’s skin tingling on his tongue. He loves feeling Draco’s ragged puffs of breath against his hair. He loves the noises he can draw out of Draco, the soft groans of pleasure.
Draco pauses and looks over his shoulder. His father is glaring at him with so much malice it makes Draco’s stomach twist, “Don’t you dare walk away from me.”
The box is small but surprisingly heavy. Inside rests a glass figurine--a dragon. Draco lifts it out carefully, watching the way the greens and yellows shimmer as he twists it this way and that. There’s a note with it that simply reads: I miss you. And Draco grabs the countertop to stop himself from Apparating straight to Harry’s and falling into his arms, telling him—
Scorpius is the most cooperative of the three, politely asking for a chocolate cone, and Harry can only glare at Draco’s smug look while he tries to calm James and Albus down.
Draco watches as his father’s face contorts. You would think that his father would feel gratitude towards Potter, considering he’s the only reason Draco isn’t sitting in a cell too. But Lucius still holds Potter responsible for his loss of power and status.
“Whatever you want, really,” Harry answers. He scoots closer to Malfoy on the sofa and tilts the menu towards him, “C’mon, take a look and see what you’d like.”
“Draco…” Harry says and Draco turns, pulling him into a tight hug, “Are you sure this is what you want?” Harry’s throat constricts at the thought of Draco walking away again but he has to ask.
“No, Astoria has a date,” Malfoy waggles his eyebrows suggestively, “and I’m dropping Scorp off with my mother, he’s staying with her for the weekend.”
Draco grumbles but allows it, and a moment later he feels a cleaning charm wash over him. The bed dips as Harry settles back down beside him and then he’s being pulled into Harry’s arms, already drifting to sleep.
“Harry! What are you still doing in bed? Have you taken your potion, eaten anything?” Hermione asks, her Healer instincts kicking in.
“Well. I’m glad, Draco. Harry Potter is a good friend to have, I’m sure,” she said, fingers tapping against the table, “But darling, Andy—Andromeda, what she did—”
Harry hums, lets his mouth slide down Draco’s throat while he fumbles for his wand. Draco swears and tips is head back with a groan at the first touch of a wet finger against him. “Two, please. I can take it, you know I can. Harry, please,” Draco begs, and Harry gives him what he wants, slipping two fingers inside.
They’re both frozen in the wake of Draco’s words, neither daring to even breath as the weight of what has just been said settles over the kitchen. No matter how badly Draco wants to drop his gaze, he fights it, keeping his eyes locked on Harry’s. He watches the emotions play over Harry’s features and he sees the moment Harry settles on one.
It’s torture. Every day that passes is slowly chipping away at his hope that Draco will show up on his doorstep again and things will go back to normal.
“Al, get your finger out of your nose please,” Harry says with a sigh. He glances down at his watch and his sense of calm evaporates in an instant.
Potter looks slightly embarrassed but he holds his ground, “No really, I invited you, it’s my treat.”
“You just want your present,” Draco states, forcing himself to grab Harry’s wandering hand and halt its movement. He will not get hard sitting in the Leaky. He won’t.
“I thought you said this was a Christmas movie?” Malfoy asks sounding confused but he’s interested enough that he doesn’t look away from the screen.
“What? Oh,” Harry laughs, the sound like sweet music to Draco’s ears, “That’s cotton candy. Knowing your sweet tooth, you’d love it. We can get some if you’d like.”
“It is,” Malfoy assures, pulling out his wand and after two tries, pops the cork, “I suppose you’re forgiven. Stori look, Potter brought us wine,” Malfoy says turning to address his wife who is across the room.
Harry turns to face Draco, intending to grab him and Apparate away, but the look on Draco’s face is so unguarded, such a rare sight, that it leaves Harry frozen. Draco is all soft blonde hair and bright blue-grey eyes, and Harry can only stare dumbly as his pulse pounds loudly in his ears. Draco gives him a small smile then, and even though they’re standing under the inky night sky, in that moment it’s like Harry is staring directly into the sun.
Draco still isn’t convinced that the odd food is actually safe for consumption, “That’s candy?” he questions with an eyebrow raised, “It doesn’t look like any candy I’ve seen before.”
The close proximity has Draco’s heart pounding. God, this was such a stupid idea. Draco stumbles a bit as they turn and Harry shoots him an amused look.
He hates how frantic people become, rushing out to buy overpriced flowers and chocolate in hopes of conveying their love, instead of just telling their significant other how they feel.
Harry lands hard outside the gates to Hogwarts. He doubles over, putting his hands on his knees as he shudders out a few ragged breaths. His heart is pounding in his chest and his entire body is trembling.
“Later,” Harry replies breathlessly, and the promise in his voice makes something break loose in Draco’s chest, “Just—don’t stop. Keep going,
Yes, it’s highly likely that he’s about to fuck this up, and Harry really doesn’t want to end up with his bollocks hexed off. But he clears his throat anyway and finally calls out “Malfoy Manor.”
“I’m sorry, you don’t know how very sorry I am,” Draco says quietly, refusing to give into his nerves and meets Kade’s eyes straight on.
“Oh, fuck off,” Malfoy replies, before he picks up the cookie and takes a vicious bite, “I hate this holiday.”
They both take several deep breaths, then Draco’s hips twitch, and Harry starts to move, pulling out halfway before sinking back in slowly. Draco is under him, long and lean and exposed, and Harry doesn’t want to miss a second of it, wants to take his time.
Draco lets out a strangled sob, tensing up tight around Harry’s cock, and Harry lets go and follows him. He bites down hard into Draco’s shoulder, thrusting in deep and staying there as the pleasure washes over him.
“You just need to focus. Line it up with your eyes and then follow through,” Harry’s voice is rough against his ear and a shiver shoots down his spine.
She nods, accepting his answer and not pressing further, “Good. I’m glad you’re not being your usual oblivious self.”
Harry has stepped closer now, his fingers trailing, almost reverently, over the branches where his parents names are woven. His mouth is parted in shock and Draco can hear his breaths coming faster.
“Fuck, that’s hot,” Harry stutters out, hips now starting to roll forward. After a few minutes, Draco takes his hand off himself and tugs at Harry’s balls. Harry’s cock jumps in his mouth.
Ron quit the Auror's before they ever finished training, deciding to help George run the joke shop instead. No one really expected Ron to have such a head for business but he does, and now they have three extremely successful locations.
Potter bites his bottom lip, “Would you and Scorpius like to come with me and the boys to the movies Friday night?”
He doesn’t want to go to the Ministry, can’t imagine how miserable it’s going to be having to deal with Smith and all of his stupidity. He only has a week left and then he’ll officially be a Junior Auror. He’ll have a permanent partner and will get to go out on calls. He’s worked his arse off for the last year and it will finally pay off. He should be proud, but he only feels hollow, because the truth is, Harry doesn’t want to be an Auror.
“Open your mouth.” Draco does and Potter slides a bite of rich chocolate cake inside. It’s delicious, and Draco moans at the taste, “Good?”
“When did this happen?” Draco demands, walking back into the kitchen and waving a small stack of papers at him.
Harry feels Draco shift around, and then his mouth is kissing the dimples at the base of Harry’s back, continuing up a moment later to drag over every bump and divot of his spine.
Astoria insists that Harry join them on New Years Eve, which is why Harry is standing in his bedroom, fussing over his appearance and trying to tame his hair. He doesn't know why it matters, he’s never given much thought to what he looks like before. He prefers to wear whatever’s comfortable and simply runs a towel over his messy curls, leaving them to lay as they wish.
Malfoy makes a soft noise in return, one that Harry feels more than hears, as Malfoy’s vocal chords vibrate beneath his hand.
“Why, because you’re already married? Or because you’re in love with Harry Potter?” Kade asks, his tone going cold as ice, "But I guess that's the same thing huh?"
Harry likes the imagery in that. Giving Draco something that will grow into something beautiful, something more. Something Harry hopes to be around to see.
But before he can even open his mouth, Potter pulls him forward into his arms, and all the words fly out of Draco’s brain.
Potter says it like it isn’t a big deal. Like it’s the most normal thing in the world. Like this is the way it has always been.
Harry is well aware that people find his life interesting and he knows that everything he does is watched closely. He long ago learned to live with it. But he wishes that for once he could just enjoy a day out with his family.
After several seconds, Harry finally pulls back out, before thrusting in once more, and everything feels like too much and not enough, his body flooded with conflicting sensations.
He always sleeps peacefully in Potter’s bed. There are no nightmares, no waking up in a cold sweat reaching for his wand to defend himself against some unknown enemy. Harry sleeps on the side of the bed closest to the door, and it makes Draco feel safe somehow. Protected. Settles some deep buried fear that Draco always carries with him. That fear, Draco knows, is probably a result of the year spent with Voldemort roaming the halls of his childhood home. But it’s washed away when he has Harry’s warm body next to him, his arms possessively wrapped around Draco, his breaths deep and even.
“Be good,” Harry growls against his mouth, “Or I’m gonna bend you over right here where anyone could walk by and see.”
“Please,” Harry begs and he doesn’t recognize his own voice. It’s wrecked, cracking at the end of his plea.
“Hey mate,” Ron says, dusting the soot from his robes. Harry really needs to have that Floo cleaned.
Potter stares at him as he comes back down, his cock still half hard and on display. Draco averts his gaze, lifting an arm up to wipe away the evidence of what he just let happen. Again.
Draco sags against the wall in front of him, and Harry follows him forward, peppering soft kisses to the back of his neck. After a moment their harsh breaths slow, and Harry decides they’ve pressed their luck enough for one night. He casts a quick cleaning charm to take care of the mess, then tucks Draco’s still half-hard cock back into his trousers.
Harry realizes over the course of the afternoon that he knows very little of what Malfoy’s life post-war has been like. What he does know, is that the Malfoy name has never recovered. People still hold grudges even a decade later and Harry knows that Malfoy is just as likely to gain unwanted attention as he is.
Orion nuzzles Draco’s hand, giving his fingers an affectionate nip. Draco swallows the lump in his throat as he unties the letter. He’s not about to go over all Hufflepuff because of a sodding owl.
, Harry thinks as his eyes take in every detail of Draco’s face. The light dusting of freckles across his nose. The small scar just above his left eyebrow. The exact color of those grey eyes, tiny specs of blue shining out at him.
The sitting room is large, fairy lights and greenery still decorate the walls and mantle. A fire is roaring brightly, making the room feel cosy and warm, and the smell of fresh logs burning hangs heavy in the air.
Guilt and regret burn in Draco’s chest. Of course he knows but he had done what he thought was best. He keeps his eyes firmly on his mug of tea, not quite sure what Hermione wants him to say. There are no words to fix this.
“Fuck,” Harry murmurs to himself. He tries to catch his breath but his heart feels like it’s about to break free from his chest.
Hermione shoves her arm into her handbag, digging around. After a few seconds she produces a handful of chocolate frogs, which she sets down on the table.
Draco can feel Harry’s smile against his skin, can smell the beer on his breath with every shallow exhale. Forgetting all about Apparating them, Draco drags Harry flush against him, one hand around his waist and one clutching the curls at the base of his skull. He encourages Harry’s hips into a slow roll, the maddening friction leaving him light-headed.
Harry steps back, playfully tossing Albus onto the sofa, and then digs through the box of Christmas decorations. There are only a few odds and ins left in the bottom. They’ve been at it for a few hours now and Harry’s patience, and energy, is waning.
“You’re back now, that’s all that matters. And look at you,” she tuts, starting to fill a plate for him, “Skin and bones. Do they not feed you properly in New York?”
Draco kicks the sheets off with a huff and gets to his feet, pushing the invading thoughts away. He makes his way into the bathroom, starting the shower and letting the sound of water hitting the stone tiles soothe him. He strips out of his pajamas, not bothering to glance at himself in the mirror. He knows what he’ll see. Dark circles under his eyes, skin so pale it’s almost translucent, waist just a bit thinner than usual.
“Nothing!” Harry says, shaking his head in disbelief. Of course that’s the conclusion Malfoy would draw from this. “What? You think this is some kind of incentive so that you'll let me fuck you? Why would I bother when you already give it up so easy.”
It suddenly strikes Draco just how domestic this is. Even more shocking, is how much he likes it. It’s so different from what he’s used to. Meals at the Manor usually consisted of sitting at a too big table, sharing stilted conversations and uncomfortable silences. And now, he eats most of his meals alone. Draco doesn’t know which is worse.
“Draco, did you hear anything I just said?” Astoria asks, hands on her hips, her plum dress wrinkling under her fingers.
Potter pulls his mouth away, ending the kiss just as quickly as he started it. He’s breathing hard as he tucks his face into Draco’s neck and drags his tongue against the sensitive spot below Draco’s ear.
”You taste fucking amazing, Malfoy,” Potter whispers. Draco moans in reply and closes his eyes, already overwhelmed.
“Harry,” Draco forces a sneer onto his face, desperate not to show the emotions that are battling for space in his chest.
And Harry doesn’t know what else to do. So he pulls Draco to him, their chests colliding hard—and then they’re kissing. Harry slides his hands beneath Draco’s shirt, his fingers clutching warm skin, and he feels the exact moment that Draco goes pliant against him.
“Well that’s unlikely,” Harry laughs humorlessly, “I told him I would owl him after the weekend and we could talk but after the way things went yesterday I don’t know. I don’t see any friendly chats in our future.”
Harry is looking down between them, watching as Draco quickly conjures lube and starts to move his hand. He has a look of awe on his face, as if he can’t really believe that this is happening, and Draco can relate.
Draco nods, licking his lips as he drags Harry down into another kiss. Harry slowly slides his finger inside, and Draco breaks the kiss with a gasp, letting his head fall back. Harry takes the opportunity and latches onto his neck, sucking and biting until Draco’s skin is covered with purpling marks.
Hermione just snorts in response and offers a hand to him. Fuck it, Draco thinks, sitting down his empty glass and taking her hand. He doesn’t hesitate, pulling Hermione into his arms and twirling her around. He does so again and again when she laughs.
Harry meets his eyes then, his mouth parting slightly, clearly about to say something that will do terrible things to Draco’s heart. And fuck if Draco can’t feel his defenses slipping already.
“Fuck. Okay, okay.” Harry takes his fingers back and looks into Malfoy’s eyes, silently asking for permission to take this further. To take it where they both need it to go.
“Sap,” Draco replies teasingly, but Harry can see the emotion shining in his eyes and he knows Draco feels the same way.
Fuck it, Draco thinks as he walks over to his bag and pulls out the Muggle phone Kade insisted he bring with him. He taps at the screen and after three tries he’s able to find Kade’s contact information.
Draco’s tongue loosened from the alcohol and the need to lash out and provoke Harry, cause his next words to slip free without a second thought, “Do you know why I came back? Why I need those papers signed?” Draco’s lips pull into a sneer, “Because I’m engaged. So the sooner I’m rid of you the better.”
Draco is taken back for a moment. It’s the close resemblance to his father that people usually point out. “You really think so?” he blurts.
Harry’s lips are slightly chapped, his palm warm where it rests against Draco’s cheek. The tip of Harry’s tongue nudges at Draco’s bottom lip and Draco is instantly hard, the arousal igniting in his body like a fire springing to life. Draco gasps and opens his mouth, allowing Harry to slide his tongue inside, where he twists it around Draco’s, the wet friction addicting.
“I did not,” Potter insists, flapping his hands around as if to make his point, “You never said it mattered
“Was that really necessary?” The owl turns its head away from him and ruffles its brown feathers rudely.
Harry throws his head back and laughs loudly. “Remember in eighth year when -“ Harry’s cut off by Hermione’s voice floating through the door.
Draco starts to suck, lazy and a bit sloppy. He’s gone. Floated off to some other place. Harry rolls his hips, fucking into that perfect mouth, already so close. Draco's eyes are closed now, and his face is flushed a beautiful, splotchy pink, and Harry—fuck he loves it. Loves every second that he spends in Draco’s presence, whether they’re fighting or fucking or doing nothing at all, it doesn’t matter. Harry loves it, he loves—
It’s a warm day, the sun shining brightly in the cloudless sky. But Harry isn't enjoying the nice weather. Instead he’s fuming, well beyond mad and now bordering on murderous. He doubts that if he actually strangled Rita Skeeter anyone would be terribly upset or try to throw him Azkaban. He’d be doing the world a favor, really.
With one hand, Harry tangles their fingers together against the blankets, holding on tight, while he moves his other hand down to wrap around Draco’s cock, hot and hard in his fist.
“Thank Salazar,” Draco replies, standing up and allowing his wife to fuss over him just a little more before he turns to eye himself in the full length mirror.
“Of course,” Hermione says, striding forward to wrap her arms around Harry, “Happy Valentine's Day. We’ll get out of your hair now.”
Harry quickly checks the stalls, making sure that they’re alone, before throwing an Auror grade locking spell at the door. He feels a sick sort of pleasure rise up in him when he sees the way Draco’s eyes widen.
The waitress returns and sits Hermione’s tea down on the table with a smile. Hermione adds sugar and the lemon, before taking a tentative sip.
“It doesn’t matter,” he says, looking over and giving Astoria a tight smile. It really doesn’t matter. There’s no point in pursuing a friendship with Harry Potter. Maybe they’ll get the kids together a few more times, maybe they’ll start to learn more about one another as just Draco and Harry, not Malfoy and Potter. But Draco knows it won’t last. Eventually, Potter will remember who Draco is, he’ll remember the things Draco has done, and that will be the death of anything they manage to grow between them, “I have to get this Valerian Root cut, so please just tell me whatever it is you came in here to tell me.”
“Thank you,” Draco says quietly, still unsure of where this is going but hoping Potter gets to the point fast. Draco hates feeling so small in Potter’s presence. He used to be all cocky confidence but Voldemort and the war knocked Draco down a few pegs. He had been so sure of himself when he was younger and Merlin, he had been so, so wrong.
“You’re a spoiled brat,” Harry says, equal parts fond and exasperated, “You’ll get it later, don’t worry.”
They sit in silence for a few minutes, both sipping their drinks and Draco nibbles on his muffin. Which is delicious. The rich chocolate melts in his mouth and he has to hold back a moan.
He sets Draco back on his feet and turns away to throw locking and silencing charms at the door, and then he stalks forward—a panther hunting its prey.
Narcissa steps closer to Harry, her aromatic perfume invading his nose as she threads her arm through his delicately. They set off onto the dirt pathway that winds through the grounds of the Manor, Harry only looking back to Draco once, before he puts his mind to the task of finding out just how mad Narcissa is over this whole mess.
Between Scorpius being on summer holiday and Harry taking up a large chunk of his free time, Draco has fallen woefully behind with his work.
“Great, just come on over whenever,” Harry says, and nerves flutter in his stomach, like pixies dancing around, at the thought of an evening alone with Malfoy.
Harry follows Draco through the long hallways of his childhood home, their hands clasped together tightly. Before long, Draco turns into one of the rooms that make up the West wing of the house. Harry glances around, recognizing Narcissa’s preferred sitting room. It’s large, decorated in warm tones and there’s a fire burning low.
Draco watches as Harry’s eyes take in the tapestry, the large tree intricately woven with gold yarn, depicting generations of Potters’. The bright green leaves and red-orange sky make it look like a vibrant piece of artwork. Which Draco supposes it is.
“Open up.” Draco does, letting Harry slide inside, all the way, until he’s nudging at the back of Draco’s throat.
It’s so late, it’s early, when Harry jolts awake. He panics, but only for a second, because everything’s alright. Draco’s here. Harry is still half on top of him, their legs tangled together, and Draco’s hand is carding through his hair.
Eventually though, Draco rolls off him and they clean up just enough to sleep comfortably. Harry casts
Harry sighs and finally turns to face him. He looks exhausted. But even with dark circles under his eyes and scruff covering his jaw, he’s still the most beautiful thing Draco’s ever seen.
Reality shatters around him as Draco’s body obeys, and he comes in hot spurts over his own stomach, his cock untouched. His vision whites out, static filling his ears as pleasure surges through his body. He’s vaguely aware that he’s making noise, distantly feels Harry tense against him as he too falls over the edge, but he can’t focus on anything expect the euphoria spreading through him.
“Better tools? Explain Potter,” Draco demands but Potter just laughs around the straw in his mouth and shakes his head.
Harry carefully unties the bow and gently sets it aside before he unrolls the heavy fabric. Draco quickly pulls his wand out and uses a temporary sticking charm to hang it from the wall.
“But you write for a Quidditch magazine and, and. Why on earth would you want to help me?!” Draco blurts when he regains the ability to speak.
“I met someone. We’ve been together about a year now,” Draco blurts and then pauses, steeling himself, “He proposed a few days ago, and I’ve said yes,” Draco confesses, glad to finally be able to tell someone. But as he watches the blood drain from Hermione’s face, he almost wishes he lied. He wishes that he hadn’t ever come back. Or maybe, he wishes he never left in the first place.
Harry came to New York. Draco doesn’t know how to deal with the feelings that information is stirring up inside him. But it doesn’t matter, he tells himself firmly. He didn’t come back for Harry. He came back to finally make peace with the past and move on. The problem is, that’s turning out to be more difficult than Draco ever expected.
Draco sighs. He knows that look. It’s the look Potter gets when he’s made his mind up about something and Draco figures there’s no use arguing.
They hold each other tight, bodies pressed together so closely, that Harry can hear every hitch of Draco’s breath and feel Draco shaking against him
And just like that everything else disappears. All the stress and tension Harry’s been carrying around all night is gone. The only thing that matters now is Draco’s pleasure. Harry doesn’t know how Draco does that, how he’s able to make all of Harry’s worries seem small and insignificant. When they’re together Draco totally eclipses everything else, the world narrowing down to just the two of them.
It doesn’t matter though because it ends as quickly as it began. Potter pulls back, looking almost as shocked as Draco but he doesn’t apologize or offer an explanation.
As he glares at Harry he sees the pain flash in those green eyes and he has to bite the inside of his cheek to stop himself from taking the words back.
Harry stands from the table, pulling Draco with him and Apparates them straight to his bedroom. He realizes his mistake when Draco meets his eyes with confusion and sadness in his own.
“Shut up,” Potter laughs, his eyes crinkling at the corners, that same look of affection and desire crossing his face for a brief second. Or maybe Draco’s just projecting, it’s hard to be sure, “Wanna race?”
When he gets to the greenhouse he’s pleased to see that everything is ready. Fairy lights are strung up and candles cover every available amount of space.
The whimper of protest that leaves him as Malfoy pulls back is a sound he’s sure he’s never made before, whether awake or dreaming. It’s needy. Vulnerable.
His hand shakes as he reaches out to trace Draco’s lips, memorizing the shape of them. Then, he forces two fingers inside, resting them on Draco’s tongue. Draco moans, sucking his fingers and coating them with saliva. Once they’re nice and wet, Harry pulls away, keeping his eyes locked on Draco’s as he reaches behind himself and slips one inside.
Part of Harry wants to be angry with Draco, wants to tap into that old hatred, to just move on with his life and forget all about the last six months. But he can’t.
They’re broken out of their kiss as the line moves forward. Draco’s nerves return and he silently hopes this isn’t as bad as it looks. Though, it would be ironic that he survived Voldemort only to be taken down by a Muggle amusement ride.
It isn’t the picture they posed for together. No, this is one Blaise managed to take while they were unaware. In the picture, they’re standing close to one another in front of the fire, Draco’s hand is on Potter’s shoulder, his head thrown back in laughter at something Potter had said. And Potter, god. He’s looking at Draco like there’s no one else in the room, like there’s no one else in the universe. His lips are tilted into a soft smile, something about it intimate, like a secret only shared between them. His eyes, focused on Draco’s laughing face, are bright green behind his glasses, the fire light making them glow like emeralds in the sunshine, and the affection in his gaze is shockingly easy to see.
There, leaning casually against the wall, looking more like a Greek god than he has any right to, is Harry Potter. He’s wearing jeans that are hanging loosely from his slim hips, the hint of black boxers peeking out of his waistband when he raises his arm in a friendly wave. The long-sleeved henley shirt is also black, the three buttons undone and showing off a smattering of dark hair, the fabric clinging to the lean muscles of his torso and arms.
Rita has really done it this time, accusing Draco of having Harry under the influence of a spell or potion. She then went on to recount every terrible thing Draco had ever done, harping on his Death Eater past and ultimately calling for his imprisonment. The fact that Harry is only recently divorced and Draco is still very much married did nothing to help matters.
So Harry goes and gets their usual orders, accepting one of the free, heart-shaped sugar cookies just to see Malfoy glare at him again.
“Harry informs me that he’s taking us out for a family dinner tonight, Draco. You boys talk while I go and call Andromeda,” his mother says with a small smile. Her blue eyes are alight with happiness as she walks into the house.
“I never thought I’d say this, but I’m impressed, Draco,” Lucius says. His hands are restrained but he can still push the hair back from his face. The movement gives Draco a clear view of his fathers pale blue eyes sparkling in the dull light, “Using Potter to improve the Malfoy image is a smart move. Have you been seen in public together?”
Draco stomps through Potter’s flat toward the kitchen, intending to dig up some parchment and leave Potter a rude note to find when he gets home. Draco stops in his tracks however, when he enters the room and finds Potter sitting calmly at the kitchen table, just the hint of a smirk on his face.
Once they untangle themselves and exit the ride, Draco pulls Harry into his arms and rests their foreheads together, trying to hide his flushed face.
Astoria eyes him shrewdly, her face calculating. Finally she drops her gaze to the gold watch that adorns her wrist. It was a present from Draco, he gave it to her the day Scorpius was born.
“Right,” Harry says breathlessly, almost certain that was the longest sentence he has ever heard Malfoy speak that wasn’t cutting or rude in any way.
It could be minutes or hours, Draco doesn’t know. He’s lost all sense of time as he and Harry reclaim each others mouths, again and again, only stopping long enough to drag air into their lungs. Draco can’t recall a single moment in his life when he experienced such an overwhelming feeling of rightness. And he knows, without a doubt, that he’s exactly where he’s suppose to be.
“I hate how much I need this,” Potter whispers as they break apart, and Draco suspects he wasn’t meant to hear that. Still, a shudder shoots down his spine, the words spreading through him like molten heat, settling low behind his balls and pulsing brightly.
By the time they break apart, they’re both panting and hard again. “Want your fingers in me. Want you to fuck me,” Draco whines.
But wait, what? Is Draco really sitting in a busy Starbucks with Harry Potter, arguing over who stalked who better? Maybe he inhaled some kind of toxin in the greenhouse this morning and is actually still at home, face down on the floor.
This was a terrible idea, Harry thinks the next afternoon as he stands beside Malfoy and watches as their sons play. The park Malfoy suggested they meet at is brilliant though, disguised with a Muggle Repelling Charm and fitted with all manner of high quality Wizarding playground equipment.
“I should make you jealous more often,” Draco says a moment later, and Harry can hear the smug satisfaction in his voice.
When midnight draws close, everyone stands and counts down. Malfoy kisses Astoria on the cheek before leaning heavily into Harry’s side and smacking a wet kiss to his forehead. Harry returns the gesture with a laugh and then sighs happily, thinking about the saying that whatever you’re doing at the start of the new year is what you’ll be doing for the rest of it.
Still, Harry can't help but bounce around, checking and rechecking things as he waits for Draco, the ten minutes seeming to stretch on for hours. But then the door creaks open and a blonde head appears. Harry’s heart is in serious danger of breaking free from his chest and his hands shake as he watches Draco take in everything with wide eyes.
Harry lets his eyes skim over the colorful little shapes, his heart aching as he realizes he can still recall exactly when and where Draco acquired each one. He often wonders what Draco would say if he knew that Harry kept these things.
Or the way Draco would come home and shed his clothing, leaving a trail from the Floo all the way to their bedroom on the third floor. It was especially bad in the winter, Kreacher grumbling as he picked up discarded scarves, gloves, and jumpers.
Harry’s eyes snap to Draco. He sighs as he recognizes the pleading look in those grey-blue eyes. And though Harry’s terrified to let Draco out of his sight, he knows he won’t deny Draco anything he needs. Even if what he needs is to be left alone with the man who just had his hands all over him.
Harry sighs. He doesn’t know if he’ll ever be ready to talk about it. But if there’s anyone who will listen without judgement, it’s Ron.
Harry’s coffee cup hits the floor and shatters into pieces. He snatches his wand up from the table, gripping it tightly in shaking fingers as he casts
But Draco doesn’t have time to decipher any of what he’s feeling, because Harry is dropping to his knees and quickly stripping him from the waist down. Harry’s thumb swipes up and over the head of Draco’s rapidly swelling cock, smearing around the wetness already gathered there. He lifts his thumb to his mouth then, sucking the taste of Draco off with a moan.
The girl-Weasley is harder to interpret, but Draco has a suspicion that this is a ploy to get him alone, and quite possibly hex him to death.
“Oh, god,” Draco whimpers, arching up, his cock dragging against Harry’s stomach, “Fuck me, please.”
Draco has to admit that Kade, shirtless with his pajama bottoms hanging low on his hips, is a welcome sight. His dark hair is a mess on top of his head and his brown eyes crinkle at the corners as he smiles warmly at Draco.
“Er. Well, no. I was about to right before you showed up!” Harry quickly lies but it’s no use. Hermione has always been able to see right through his bullshit.
His pulse pounds loudly in his ears and his palms are damp, and it occurs to Harry that he’s being ridiculous.
The potential for change and the appreciation of all the memories that were made over the last twelve months hangs crisp in the air. For those first few weeks of the year, the surge of desire to do better and make the most of all the good things in his life is almost overwhelming.
It’s just the same as he remembers; crooked, overgrown and shabby but radiating warmth and loving energy.
“And there’s not much to say, honestly. Most of my time is taken up with work. When you’re not married to the Savior of the Wizarding World, life becomes rather predictable,” Draco says, attempting to break the tension with humor.
Draco visibly shivers and then nods, standing on shaky legs to make his way onto the bed. He straddles Harry and holds a hand out. Harry casts the spell and Draco’s palm fills with shiny lube. He reaches behind himself, whining softly as he starts to work himself open. Harry watches, riveted, and can’t resist wrapping a hand around Draco. He strokes him slowly, lightly, almost teasing. Draco bats his hand away a moment later, wiping the leftover lube onto Harry’s cock. “Come on, I’m ready, want you in me.”
Thank Merlin for cushioning charms, otherwise most of the ornaments would be in shattered pieces on the floor.
Many hours later, when the sun is starting to set and they’ve all been stuffed full of desserts, Draco wanders outside to enjoy a minute of fresh air and silence.
“Kade I - Are you sure? I mean isn’t this a little fast? We aren’t even officially living together and -“
Cold winter air sweeps into the entry way along with the scent of vanilla and sandalwood and a smell that makes Harry think of the city after a rainstorm.
Harry presses Draco’s wrists into the mattress, catches that full bottom lip between his teeth, and bites down. “Yes,
“Yes,” Draco breathes the word out, all his focus on not coming in his pants as Potter’s hand continues its assault, “Fuck, yes. Please.”
He would have stayed home and avoided the day entirely, but even though he has no kids to drop off this morning and no real responsibilities to take care of, he’s up bright and early headed towards his and Malfoy’s preferred Starbucks.
The kiss isn’t one shared between lovers; rather a fight between life long enemies. Its teeth clashing and lips bitten. Its Potter’s nails, digging in and carving crescent-shaped marks into his skin. Years worth of pent up emotion rushing out of them the only way it knows how.
“We’re going to be stuck together if you don’t move,” Draco complains, but Harry can hear the smile in his voice.
“Please.” Harry runs a gentle hand down Draco’s stomach, back up and over his ribcage, holding there a moment and feeling Draco’s lungs expand. "
Hermione opens her mouth then snaps it shut again. She does this several times before squaring her shoulders and finally letting her rant free.
Harry feels a weight he didn’t know was there lift off his chest. He hasn’t ever said that so plainly to anyone before, always worried his words will be taken the wrong way. But here, under the autumn sun, Harry admits the truth that has been eating away at him for years.
“For fucks sake!” Draco yells, startled as Potter’s owl flies in through his open kitchen window and promptly drops a small package right into his plate of pasta, splattering his dinner all over the pristine cherry wood of his table.
Harry just laughs again, “Wizards have some of the strangest candy I’ve ever seen and you think that cotton candy is weird?”
He shouldn’t have done that, and certainly not to thoughts of Harry. It only makes everything worse, makes the guilt and hurt swell up inside his chest until it feels like he can’t breathe. He sits on the edge of his bed, trying to fight against the panic as he struggles to draw in air.
When Potter collapses against his back, Draco allows it. He lets Potter brush his lips against his neck in a soft kiss, so gentle and more intimate than anything else they’ve just shared. It makes his throat tight, plants little seeds of
There’s a small line of people waiting to get on the ride. They take their place and Draco watches as the teenage girl in front of them stuffs some kind of fluffy, blue and pink colored food into her mouth.
Harry knows he shouldn’t have let himself lose control like that. Not today and especially not around Draco but the thought of another man touching Draco,
Sunday dinner has become one of Draco’s favorite things. Lately, he has even found himself looking forward to going to the cosy, crooked house—eating the most delicious food he’s ever tasted and watching fondly as Scorpius runs through the overgrown garden with the other children.
Malfoy nods, an understanding passing between them as if Malfoy knows exactly what Harry means, as if he himself feels the same way.
“He might be stubborn but I’ve heard you’re pretty stubborn yourself,” Astoria answers with a smile, “Just tell him the truth, Harry. He’ll listen.”
“Shut up, Malfoy,” he says with a grin, “Anyways, a scout for the Kestrels happened to be there one day and he offered me a try-out.”
He’s barely taken a step into the living room when he’s grabbed by a pair of strong hands and shoved against the wall. The bookshelf beside him shakes from the force, the collection of snitches there wobbling precariously.
The ride is pretty mild compared to the others they’ve been on tonight but Draco likes it. When they reach the top the ride comes to a halt and Draco looks out at the breathtaking view.
Potter moans in reply and the sound vibrates through Draco’s body, making his cock twitch and drool precome all over his stomach.
But he did none of those things and now, he finds himself being knocked forward hard by a solid weight at his back.
“Thank you,” Draco says, leaning over to kiss him, “I think I should go soon, get it over with. Maybe tomorrow if I can get an International Portkey that fast,” Draco chews his bottom lip, wondering what the hell he’s going to do once he gets to England.
Which is absolute bollocks, Harry mentally reminds himself, tearing his eyes away and focusing instead on the changing leaves. He shouldn’t be reacting to Malfoy like this.
Draco sits back on his heels and stares up at Harry. His eyes are wild, the green almost completely eclipsed by black and his lips are red from being bitten. His entire body is shaking and the fact that Draco’s the one who made him loose control so fast, causes a rush of heady power to course though his body.
Harry takes a sip and savors the way the drink warms his belly. The vanilla is good, and Harry has to admit that part of what makes it so good, is the memory of the way it smells on Malfoy’s breath.
, which is now one of the most popular Wizarding publications in the U.S. and Draco prides himself on providing the magical community with factual articles that both inform and entertain.
He thinks about them over breakfast with his mother the next day. They distract him at his job interview that afternoon, make him distant over dinner with Astoria.
Harry mumbles something back, not even sure if it’s actual words, his brain still not fully functioning yet.
Harry rolls his eyes, placing the large pot on the burner and turning up the heat, “I thought you could help.”
Suddenly, Harry is hot all over, and he needs to be closer, has to kiss Draco now. Can’t wait the mere seconds it would take to get them home.
“What the fuck Draco?” Kade says in a strained voice but Harry barely hears him, he’s occupied with trying to restrain himself from ripping Draco from the other mans arms.
She’s almost at the door when she stops and turns around, her eyes suddenly serious once more. “Don’t give up on him, Harry. I know you’ll regret it if you do.” And then she’s gone.
“Here we go,” Potter says as he walks up and slides into a seat. He pushes Draco’s drink across the table, along with a chocolate muffin, “Thought you might be hungry too.”
Hermione laughs, “It’s true Harry. Honestly, I could have told you that you were bisexual in fourth year. You can be really slow on the uptake sometimes.”
Malfoy clears his throat again, “You’ve been busy this past year. Quit your job, got divorced,” Malfoy smirks and throws Harry’s question back at him, “Why?”
The denim of Potter’s jeans is rough against Draco’s sensitive skin, the zipper digging into the back of his thighs. That sharp sting of pain making everything that much better.
After Draco left, Harry stayed frozen on the floor, curled in on himself as the tears streamed down his face. He doesn’t know how long it took, but eventually his eyes ran dry and he was able to stand. He took one look around at his bedroom, his ears ringing with how quiet it was, and he knew he had to get out of there.
“No ‘Mione, it’s fine. I’m the one who’s sorry. And I really am so sorry. For everything - all of it,” Draco says waving a hand to indicate all of him.
Ever since seeing the photo, Draco has started watching Potter closely, and he’s found that same look reflected back at him in person. What to do about it, well, he still hasn’t figured that part out yet.
And most of all, Harry likes how great Malfoy is with Scorpius and his own boys, always capturing their attention with exciting stories and dramatic gestures that are so reminiscent of Malfoy’s younger self, that Harry often feels a strange tug of nostalgia for the boy he never had the chance to know.
“But um, I mean, you and Astoria - you, did you er…Scorpius though, how…?” Harry manages to stutter out after a moment. Just brilliant, Potter, the voice inside his head taunts.
“I quit,” Harry repeats, “Sent my Patronus to Robards a few minutes ago. You’re not upset are you?” Harry has to ask because he can’t quite interrupt the look on his friends face. “You’ve been trying to get me to quit for months.”
“Yes, Kreacher can be watching the little masters,” the elf replies with a bow, his nose almost touching the floor as he does so.
With a smile Draco rests his forehead against Harry’s, a million questions on the tip of his tongue.
“I mean exactly what I said,” Harry says turning, his face giving nothing away, “I quit. Three years ago. Listen Draco, what do you want?” Harry asks resigned.
“No. He’s still an idiot,” Harry says with a tired sigh. And he could leave it at that but he wants to bitch, just a little. He may not be able to openly complain about his—fuck buddy? Casual hook-up?—flirting with someone else right in front of his face, but he sure as shit isn’t passing up an opportunity to list all the ways his Auror partner is an incompetent moron, “I’d love to know whose arse he kissed to get into the program, because there is no way he made the cut on his own. Do you know what he did today?”
“Stand up and bend over,” Potter says, and while he might look unaffected to someone else, Draco doesn’t miss the way that his eyes have dilated, the way his fists clench at his sides as he waits for Draco to move into position, the way he lets out a low, rumbling moan when Draco is bent over and spread open in front of him.
He stands in front of the huge fireplace, letting Albus down when he squirms, and dusts both of them off. Harry looks around the quiet reception hall that’s usually bustling with tiny children and harried adults. It’s strange to see it so empty. He’s never been this late before and honestly, he’s unsure what to do.
doing this. I’m in, one hundred percent.” Draco takes a deep breath and sits up a little straighter. “But I’m not like you, Harry. You face everything head on, and I run at the first sign of trouble. I will push you away, shut you out. I can be a lot, I know that, and I understand if you—”
Draco stares at the post script, rereading the words, trying to get them to make sense. The wards and the Floo are
“I’ll pick you up here at nine,” Kade answers as he cards his fingers through Draco’s hair, “God, you’re beautiful. But I should head home and get ready for work. I’ll see you tonight,” Kade says, sighing as he pulls away.
His grip on reality and his feelings for Malfoy are slipping faster and faster out of his control. The more time he spends with Malfoy, the more he wants him, and Harry doesn’t know how much longer he’ll be able to hold out. The desire to surrender is like an itch beneath his skin that he can’t reach.
Harry can’t help himself, he pulls Draco to him, crashing their lips together again. When they both finally pull back panting, Draco lets out another laugh.
Harry knows he’ll pay for that later but when he hears Draco’s shocked shriek and then howls of laughter from the boys, he can’t say he really cares.
His mouth is hot, making filthy sounds echo around the room as he bobs his head up and down. He twirls his tongue, tracing the veins with firm pressure. He adds his hand after a while, stroking what he can’t fit in his mouth with a barely there touch. It’s the most exquisite form of torture.
His heart twinges when he glances over at the small door to the pantry where Kreacher used to sleep. The irritable old elf died two years ago now and while he and Kreacher never did learn to get along very well, Harry misses him terribly.
