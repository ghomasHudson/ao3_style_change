“Not at all,” he said with a small smile. “I don’t care what it shows as long as it isn’t putting you all in danger.”
“Yes,” he said breathlessly as he, and many others, realised what Harry was implying.
Harry had inherited abilities from harbouring a foreign soul fragment within him. He was able to access the mind of Voldemort at any time, more so when he was in a relaxed environment. It aided him in the process of learning both Occlumency as well as Legilimency. Having that pre-existing exposure to know what it feels like to have an intruder in his mind. In having his magical core drained, it only helped him strengthen his core, learning to expand his power. Before the soul fragment was removed, he practised on building up a powerful core, stronger than any other young wizard out there.
With his face quickly becoming red, Dumbledore turned on the spot and marched over to the nearest window to overlook the quiet grounds of Hogwarts. His magic flickering out at being questioned on his capabilities. He couldn’t even remember the last time someone dared to doubt him, his powers or how he executed a successful plan. How dare Shacklebolt come to his office and show such disrespect to the leader of the Order of the Phoenix.
The following month would definitely be one hell of an experience now that Harry is back and needing to be prepared for war. Not only did he need to get ready for a battle, but he needed to pass the exams he had missed while he was missing. It was a lot to ask of a sixteen year old. Remus looked at Harry with sympathy. What teenager could say they needed to study and train for the fight of their life against a dark, powerful wizard? At least Harry would not be alone in this battle. He had so many people behind him. Including himself.
“Dobby!” Harry’s eyes snapped to the right, locating who had just yelled without his body reacting.
Repeating the same action over and over again, Harry couldn’t help the smile that stayed on his face. Giving the Short Skinner a decent workout, he swapped the knife for another less used knife; his Ka-Bar Short Tanto knife. Running his hand along the smooth leather handle, he smiled at the blackish-silver blade reflecting the sun that shined down through the branches. Taking the usual stance, he focused his eyes once more on the red and white target in front of him.
“I don’t believe much of what you say, you are always hiding something,” said George, also narrowing his eyes.
Together, him and Drew gathered a small team to research as much as possible into these ancient forms of magic. They took notes on the history of any documented cases where a sacrificial protection was used. Many hours were spent going through parchments, some took months to translate from other languages. But one thing they had seen in all of the cases were the long lasting benefits for the person being protected. It was a very common occurrence that the murderer could not touch the protected without experiencing unbearable pain. There were even some cases where if the murderer tried to cast any spell on the protected once the sacrificial protection was in place, it would simply rebound back to the caster.
The kitchen once more became silent as the three young adults ate the beautiful cooked food and Molly continued preparing more food for the rest of the household. Harry was eternally grateful that the questions had stopped, well, for now. He knew that the girl sat before him would still ask things whenever she next had the opportunity to. His prior research on her and what he had witnessed interacting with her so far points to that being very true.
Many questions wanted to come out at once, but Remus withheld his tongue as he looked at the younger man. Now he was closer up to him, he could see so many resemblances of James and Lily. There was no doubt in his mind that this was the one and only Harry Potter. His mannerism was a little off putting, but that might be down to his preconceived expectations of the missing boy. All Remus hoped for him was that he had been safe and cared for the years he was missing, and he did seem to have been taken care of fairly well.
"What are you doing here?" Steven asked after the silence continued on. "Get out of my house."
Of course he already knew all of this. From what he had observed the night he broke in to their manor, he could tell that the Malfoy spawn was a snobbish, spoilt, rich kid. And he could feel the air of superiority hanging around the head of the family; the man had complete control of the room as soon as he entered it. His research had shown him all of the applications made by Lucius to dethrone Headmaster Dumbledore. And while it wasn’t a bad thing in his eyes, part of him was glad the elder had not been successful in his endeavours. Otherwise how else could he be having his fun during this month?
“Get ready,” Drew said as he stood up from the bed.
“Anyone can easily find this out,” he scoffed as he rolled his eyes, ready to end the lying brat and show the Order members present why he was in charge.
“Avenseguim,” he whispered, moving his wand in the required motion.
“Lemon Drops,” the Headmaster loudly barked out the password to his office, a wave of anger accidently lashing out at one of the nearby paintings which resulted in it landing face down on the ground and crying out understandable profanities.
Obviously it was time to go to Hogwarts for the Order meeting, and the Weasley’s were getting ready to leave. Harry wasn’t ready. Mentally, he was prepared, emotionally not nearly ready enough. He lowered the charms and wards he had erected around the room last night as footsteps slowly approached his door. Waiting in anticipation, the person on the other side took their time before finally a firm knock rung through the room. Harry got up swiftly and walked over to the door, prying it open without a pause. He looked into the eyes of Molly, patiently waiting for her to say something first.
“Mostly to plan,” Harry shrugged, letting the comment hang in the air as his eyes glazed over for a few seconds, thinking back on the night. “I had to convince the old coot that I am, in fact, who I am. I did that by showing some childhood memories in the pensive.”
long time. Dumbledore looked into the green eyes that defiantly stared back at him. If this brat wouldn’t reveal himself, or why he was truly here, he would have no choice but to force it out of him. Pushing into the mind of the stranger he tried to dig around as subtly as he could. Yet he was instantly met with strong barriers that protected his mind. Within less than a second, he was pushed out of the stranger’s mind, finding angry eyes glaring at him.
Drew would always ask that question at any opportunity he had. It made Harry's heart warm to know he had someone that cared for him so deeply, no matter who he was. He was so lucky to have Drew in his life. He was the closest thing he had to a family as well as a father figure.
“If I can’t convince you today, expect a visit from a rather persistent Molly Weasley in the next few days. She told me to tell you that if you say no,” Kingsley said thinking a small white lie would never hurt, especially when it came to trying to convince the conniving Headmaster.
“Okay, S-Severus,” Harry tested the name out, nodding his understanding.
“No but’s Ronald Weasley. We’ve been over this. Until you are out of school, you aren’t allowed to join the Order,” Molly said as she hurried up the stairs, ignoring the whining that continued from her youngest son.
“I’ll go with you,” a quiet voice spoke up from the back of the lounge room.
Harry cancelled the Disillusion charm as he came to stand in front of the nearest cell, holding his finger higher to cast some light in to the extraordinarily dark room. He saw his friend hunched over in the corner, clothes dirty and beard untamed. The room itself was basically bare and absolutely dirty.
Harry still had his head down as he was drying the back of it, but he froze in his efforts when he heard a shuffling sound and then a soft chuckle from somewhere close by in the room.
“I’ll ask Kingsley to talk with Headmaster Dumbledore about it,” said Molly as she wiped her hands on her apron. “I’m sure he is going back to report about how today shaped out anyway.”
“If you pass your O.W.L.s and get accepted into his class, you’ll find out firsthand how much of a prick he is. I barely managed to get a high enough score to go back. I want to become an Auror, and one of the requirements is to complete Potions. So I’m lucky to have gotten this far, although I don’t know if I’ll pass my N.E.W.T.s for it, but it’s better to try, right? Oh you might not know what an Auror is. It’s basically like the wizards and witches who enforce the wizarding law and-“ Ron said before getting cut off, barely taking a breath between each sentence.
“How are we going to tell the children when they arrive this year, Albus?” Minerva’s thick Scottish accent floated above all the other voices. “How are we going to protect them all?”
"How about we save that for last," he smirked as he stood up and walked closer to his top half.
Grabbing his wand, Harry attacked instantly, trying to stun the older man instead of harming him. Yet Lucius was ready as the red light raced towards him. Easily able to deflect it, Lucius fired back without hesitation. Going down the nasty root like Parker warned. Lucky for Harry that he has had extensive training in duels and has a comprehensive knowledge of defensive spells and counter charms.
"There's less than a week to my birthday which will give me ample amount of time to commit his schedule to memory," Harry sighed as he turned his attention back to the present. "The eve of my birthday is when I'll strike."
“Harry? Are you okay?” Snape asked, sweeping some hair out of Harry’s face and tucking it behind his ears.
“Bill,” Kingsley turned to the oldest child. “I know you are a Curse-Breaker, but how good are you with warding?”
“Well Remus can help confirm this,” Harry gestured to the other man, staring at him impassively once more. “Can you confirm that during your time at Hogwarts that my farther, Sirius Black and Peter Pettigrew learned how to become an Animagus?”
Instead of apparating again, the young man ran along the rooftop in a crouch. If he had apparated from that spot, it would leave behind his residual magic, which could trace to him. Instead he fled the crime scene by foot. Choosing to jump from rooftop to rooftop until he was far enough away to use some magic. The young man pulled out a small box and within it held a miniature broom. As soon as the young man pulled the miniature broom out, it grew to its normal size. The nimbus 2000 reflected the moonlight off its polished wood, it's twigs neat and straight. The young man climbed on the broom and performed a quick Disillusionment Charm upon himself, both wandlessly and wordlessly.
"Any idea of who or what is at the cause of all of this?" Dumbledore asked with a massive sigh.
“Of course,” widely smiled Molly. “I’m sure we can make some space in Ron’s room for you Harry dear.”
“Yes,” nodded Fred.
“I brought you some extra things while I was out getting the rest of your school supplies,” the second Remus started talking, Harry turned around with raised eyebrows.
Harry didn't say anything to the other boy. Instead he turned his head and continued writing his letter. He didn't care what the boy wanted, nor did he care if he walked in or walked away. His attention was preoccupied by something way more important than whatever he came up there for. Through the mostly silent room, he heard footsteps approach before Ron sat down on the other bed in the room. He didn't like that his back was turned to the boy, but was there really much of a threat to worry about with Ron Weasley?
He casted a nonverbal '
“Yes?” he asked with a small sigh.
"McIntyre," Harry said just as sternly.
The day had gone by rather quietly for Harry for a change. After breakfast, he locked himself away in his room and buried his head in the book Grayson had given him. He had almost finished it thanks to being able to have time to himself that was distributed every so often. And although his knowledge on spells was quite extensive, he had learnt a few new ones that might come in handy for the future. Perhaps a thanks was in order to his little Gray.
“I’ll pass. I don’t care for Quidditch. If I ever happen to go up there, I’m sure I’ll see it then,” he said in a flat tone, trying his best to not let his annoyance come through.
“As you know, your magical signature in the immediate area of their house triggers an alarm. So once that is disabled you will be fine. Also as you know, we have tested what triggers the alarm protecting the Dursley’s themselves,” he said quietly. “Any physical or emotional harm done to them that is not self-inflicted will cause some order members to arrive within ten minutes. I will be going tomorrow night to test how long the response will take this time. Especially considering the arising circumstances of Voldemort’s return and no doubt with their search efforts.”
Knocking on the door to the Burrow, Remus and Nymphadora waited patiently in an awkward silence. Although their hands were full of light bags the pair felt exhausted for other reasons. Not only had Diagon Alley suddenly got very busy, but the whispers and rumours being spread had taken a toll on them. Remus was anxiously waiting for the door to open, hoping nothing had happened since they had left. Nymphadora saw the man fidget as he looked worriedly at the closed door. She couldn’t help reaching out and squeezing his arm in comfort.
Tiredly, he continued to stay in his chair as he regained some energy. If this meeting was a look into how encounters were going to happen from now on, this was going to be an extremely long month before the school year starts back. Albus Dumbledore had not been this exhausted in many years. He struggled to even think of the last time someone took this amount of energy out of him. But Harry Potter had achieved to do such that in a matter of an hour.
“Well yes, but it’s very important for him to pass his O.W.L.s as well all of the other training he’ll be doing with the Aurors,” Molly said before turning her back and walking towards the front door. “I’ll go ask Kingsley now, behave while I’m gone.”
“You’re really doing this?” Parker asked with a shocked look.
Pulling on his fresh new underwear and pajama pants, Harry threw a weak glamour on to hide the scars on his chest, arms and neck, knowing that he would have to put a shirt on before the glamour wore off. Harry dried his hair with his towel as he walked out into his room, knowing and not hearing anyone come back to the dorms. His chest still dripped slightly from the water that escaped being dried away. Harry placed his dirty clothes away and sat on his bed.
Turning his attention back to the unconscious pair, Drew begun to set the stage. He dragged over Vernon’s closest hand and pried open the fat little sausage fingers. He guided the hand over the open wound, allowing it to soak up an acceptable amount of blood. Once the blade of the knife had also been smeared in a little more blood, Drew discarded the hand back down on the bed and delicately placed the knife under Vernon’s blood drenched hand. He forced the fat fingers to curl around the handle securely, making it appear to have been in his grasp the entire time.
A shaky hand was placed on his shoulder, he opened his eyes to find Minerva with tear filled eyes, staring in sympathy at him. She was the only one he had freely told about his past. Of course both madmen that he served requested complete access to his mind and memories. While there were few things he chose to hide, like the fact he was a double agent, he could not hide his childhood abuse and neglect from either of them. He needed to show them his weak points so they wouldn’t focus on the parts that were just out of reach.
“Thursday and Friday all day as well as Saturday evenings,” replied Severus simply, his dark persona causing shivers in those near him.
"Only on rare occasions has this occurred," he nodded his head slowly.
Harry walked up to the man as he put away his wand once more, enjoying the sight that lay before his eyes. It was painfully obvious the victim had broken his nose on the way down, a small stream of dark, crimson blood coming out from the now crocked nose. Not wanting to touch the man more than he had to, Harry unravelled the limp body by pushing his lower half with his foot. He unconsciously scowled at having the misfortune of touching him. With Steven now laying completely flat at the foot of the stairs, Harry looked around in thought, wondering what he should do next.
"No," Harry seductively whispered. "No I won't take them and leave. The world must know what you did. You must pay the price for your actions."
It was evident to everyone that Harry had caused quite a stir within the Headmaster of Hogwarts, a feat not many could claim. He was unnerved, angry, and slightly paranoid. A dangerous combination, especially if one was not sound of mind. Harry moved back to his spot, resuming his passive aggressive position and impassively staring at anyone who looked his way. Inside he was pleased with himself. He had achieved exactly what he had wanted to do this meeting. Chaos had been released. Change will be coming. The powerful man before him has been taken down a few notches.
“But he would know nothing about the wizarding world, let alone how to duel,” spoke up Arthur Weasley for a change. “He would have no time to prepare.”
“After the day I had yesterday, I slept like a rock,” he couldn’t help but give a small chuckle.
“Mum said Lunch is ready,” Ron said after clearing his throat. “And she wanted me to come and tell you both.”
Harry tried to calm his nerves down before he reached the third floor, which wasn’t an easy task. He stood outside the closed door for a second and breathed in deeply. Knocking three times, he waited for permission to enter. The door opened and Harry saw a worried looking Drew standing right in front of him.
“No, I don’t think so dear. Why is that?” Molly asked as she continued cooking.
“Peter Pettigrew,” Harry turned his attention back towards the Order members, soaking in satisfaction at the confused and shock looks he saw. “He betrayed my parents by giving Voldemort their location. He then was chased by Sirius Black after he discovered what Peter had done. He escaped not long after framing Sirius Black for his own ‘murder’ and the actual murder of twelve Muggles.”
Harry made sure his hoodie was covering his identity as he ran across the street with speed, eyes never leaving the window of 4 Privet Drive. He crouched down as soon as he arrived at the door step, wand sliding smoothly in to his hand. Silently he unlocked the door with a small click signifying the success of the spell. It swung open a few inches, a strong scent of alcohol wafting straight into his nostrils. Harry scrunched his nose in disgust as he stood up from where he was squatting. He took a cautious step in to the house for the first time in eleven years.
“Hurry up, we don’t have all day,” Petunia screeched as she pushed the small Harry Potter towards the kitchen.
The room was silent as the Order members digested what had occurred only moments ago. Everyone looked up the stairs where the one and only Harry Potter had just disappeared to. The interaction between him and Ron Weasley playing over in their minds. And they had to agree with Harry, it was far too late for an apology, the damage already long done. Quiet members thought over what the following days would include. Would they need to look at a safer space for the previous missing boy to stay? Only time would tell.
Blood soaked the carpet beneath Vernon, creating a spongy noise as Harry stood with feet either side of the fingerless stumps of hands. He looked around at the family that once abused him, glad to see the fear they had instilled in him present in their eyes. Making sure they were both paying attention first, he then proceeded to bring his right hand up to his shoulder and he lent forwards slightly. He looked Vernon dead in the eyes as he swung his right arm down with force, slicing a deep, long gash in the middle of his throat. The male immediately begun to gurgle and choke on his on blood. No longer being able to breathe properly, he soon passed out from oxygen depletion. The life slowly draining from his body.
“You knew that I was a living, breathing, walking human Horcrux, the first in history, and yet you abandoned me with those despicable
Fearful eyes looked upon his pride and joy, knowing what was about to take place. The bloodied blade of the knife inched closer and closer to the base of his penis, anticipation thick in the air as it seemingly moved in slow motion. The warm surface finally made contact with his delicate skin. He gulped down the heavy amount of saliva in his mouth. A searing pain like he had never felt before started burning as the knife was pushed forwards and backwards in a slicing motion. Steven wanted his screams to so desperately be heard. He wanted someone to come to his rescue and end it all. Wanted this moment to finish as quickly as it started.
. His eyes followed as a maker was placed upon Charlie’s head, smirking a little when the younger shivered from the strange sensation. Averting his gaze, he looked up to find three makers on the roof, indicating the human presence upstairs. Although there was only meant to be three residents, he couldn’t help but quickly scan the rest of the house downstairs. Relief when there was no other sign of human life.
"I believe we will make no more headway with the way things are," Minerva said as she looked around the tense room. "I think it's best we all go home and rest. I can tell how tired some of you are. We can discuss this at another time."
“Thanks?” hesitantly responded Harry, making Remus smile.
“I don’t blame you. And again, I am so sorry for what happened my dear,” pausing, Molly turned to look at him sympathetically.
“I-“ Harry tried saying, feeling a lump get stuck in his throat. “I really appreciate this, thank you all so much.”
“We will not be looking into that until time is running out,” said Dumbledore with a low, dark tone. “Us looking into it openly will cause the Auror department and the Ministry of Magic to delve into the case, exposing the mistakes made by many. We cannot have that at a time like this.”
Eventually, the two men stepped outside the boundaries of the Entrance Gate. The tense air continuing as the Headmaster reached out to place a hand on his shoulder. Harry had to remind his body not to flinch under the touch, instead inwardly cringing. He knew that he had to allow the other to side along apparate him to the Weasley’s, even though he knew exactly where he was going. He reminded himself he needed to play along for now, holding his cards close to his chest.
“Yeah we could be wasting our time if he’s dead,” Nymphadora Tonks yelled from the other side of the room. “Instead we need to be prepared for his return. Prepare for a battle or two. Prepare for the attacks on Muggles and Muggle-borns.”
Dumbledore merely nodded his head, already deep in thought. It didn’t make sense, it didn’t add up. Yet it was reasonable enough to believe she was so terrified it had set it off. Was it possible that someone had been there? If someone had and erased her memory, then he would have felt their magical signature in the vicinity. But when he was up there, there was no such thing like that. He trusted the memory he saw. He trusted his head, even though his gut was saying something was wrong. And alas, it was not the first time he had witnessed Vernon harm his wife physically.
“Remus will assist you in preparing for your O.W.L.s which you’ll need to pass to participate in certain subjects. You’ll be staying with the Weasley’s for the month, hopefully it will help you adjust to being around other wizards. Molly and her kids will happily help you with anything,” Dumbledore said, trying to wrap things up as quickly as he could. “Tomorrow morning I will organise an Order meeting so you can be introduced with everyone that is here to support you in the quest to defeating Voldemort. Is that all clear, my dear boy?”
“I saw him with my own eyes!” another wizard yelled, chest puffed out with pride.
Thick rope shot out of his palm and attached itself firmly to the brick work. Harry carefully directed his broom towards the window, hovering as close as he could as he begun to transfer his weight from the broom to the rope. Holding all his weight with his right hand, he swung his legs off of the broom and placed them directly on the window. For a second he looked distressed as he awkwardly held the broom in his hand, before deciding just to slip it in his mokeskin pouch for the time being.
“Harry,” Drew warned, giving him a stern look. “What happened?”
“You know why no one resides there, right?” Drew asked in a stoic tone.
"I uh, sorry," his face was flushed red in embarrassment, looking away at the ground to avoid the cold stare.
“He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named,” a different voice asked.
“I know,” Harry sighed once more. “How will we be staying in contact? I guess you have a discrete method already planned?”
“Most of the professors are easy to deal with,” the other continued talking, Harry inwardly rolling his eyes. “The Head of Gryffindor is Professor McGonagall, she also teaches Transfiguration. Personally, she is one of the best professors there. She always looks out for us, even if she does come off a little strict when you first meet her. Just don’t get on Professor McGonagall’s bad side, she can be scary when she’s angry.”
“Of course,” he shook his head in amusement. “Where else would the mighty Drew McIntyre keep his mirror?”
Entering through the open window, he landed on his feet before quickly placing the broom away and disabling the Disillusionment Charm. Harry closed his eyes and shut the alarm off, as well as quickly taking the rest of his warding down. He walked up to the door and opened it to find all of the household members that were home at his door, a few with wands in their hands. He simply raised an eyebrow in question as to why he was disturbed.
The three adults remained silent as they thought over the situation. Molly was worried what potential consequences her youngest son could have caused for not only Harry, but for the entire family. She paused in her cooking as the urgency sunk in. Walking into the foyer, she grabbed out some parchment, an ink pot and a quill. Placing them in front of Nymphadora, her face was almost pale except for a small red tint on her cheeks.
"No," smiled Fred as he turned his head to look at the ceiling, his twin doing the same. "No, he is too secretive to simply give out that small detail."
There wasn't much more to do. He had caused as much damage as he could to his victim, he had tortured him both physically and psychologically to a suitable amount. All he needed to do to complete his mission was ensure a slow death. He tapped the tip of his Blackhawk Tatang knife on his left hand palm as he thought. Knowing the anatomy of a male, cutting of the penis would not cause enough blood lost to kill Steven. Neither would all the cuts and wounds he had inflicted elsewhere. No, he needed to make another cut somewhere else near a major artery. Perhaps the wrists would do. If he made a deep cut on each inner forearm, he could ensure enough blood loss to kill the man.
With a smirk on his face from successfully unnerving the usually perfectly controlled Potions Master, he held his hands up in surrender. He brought his legs off the desk and stood behind the Headmaster’s desk. It was only then that the group truly observed all of the weapons he carried on him. Harry raised his right hand, pausing to showing he was merely taking off his hoodie after a few Order members stepped forward in an offensive pose. They were already on high alert, and some were clearly ready to fight at the first sign of trouble. Pushing back the hood, he allowed them to see his electric green eyes for the first time. He lingered on each of their faces, taking in their surprised and confused looks, and meeting each gaze without fear. He knew that only a few recognised his identity in this very moment.
“Don’t you recognise me, dear Uncle?” Harry laughed darkly as he pulled the hoodie off of his face to finally reveal himself.
spell at the person. He chuckled as he heard the inevitable thud of the person falling to the ground from the full body-binding spell.
“Thank you,” he nodded his head before relaxing back in to the couch. “Well I’m sure you are keen to know about tonight.”
“I wish I could come along,” Harry sighed. “But I know it’ll be safer to remain here.”
Swapping his feet around, Harry silently continued unstrapping the last holster on his body without replying to the twins. He was rather impressed the two had noticed that small detail during their first meeting last night. Done with taking off his two ankle holster, he turned around to place them beside the bicep holsters. Harry thought over his reply as he eloquently sat on the edge on his bed, crossing his legs with a sigh. He looked up at the pair with a slight smile on his face, hinting at his amusement.
“No thank you,” he shook his head. “Today is my day off, as well as tomorrow, before I start an intense studying routine. Please let me relax. I don’t want lessons on my day off. I want to read in peace and at my own pace. Okay?”
"It was quite splendid," Harry rolled his eyes. "Let me shower first. Then I'll come up and give you a report."
“Don’t tell me you are going to leave me here to rot, Mr. Potter,” the Irish man feigned hurt as he placed a hand on his chest.
Harry smiled as he looked at the slightly younger, feeling extremely protective over the kid. The fact he had been through the same, if not a slightly worse childhood than Harry, and still managed to live life with happiness was amazing. It showed his true character. Harry swore ages ago to protect his adoptive, younger brother at all costs. Harry may have been stripped of his family, but that didn’t mean he couldn’t rebuild one. One that he knew would cherish him, love him, protect him no matter what. Unlike certain blood related family members he was going to be visiting soon.
“Completely erased. Parker apparated us from afar after I did my final sweep,” he said, watching for a reaction.
“As Headmaster Dumbledore mentioned, it has been a long day for him. I must assume it has been for you too. I bid you both a good night and I’ll see you both again at the Order meeting tomorrow morning,” he said, nodding respectfully towards them both before turning back towards the Headmaster.
Charlie merely nodded in agreement before they stood at the edge of the wards on number 4 Privet Drive. He closed his eyes as he begun to access the log for the wards, deciding which ones to take down first and which ones to leave. It was a bit of a lengthy process as it seemed new ones had been added for extra protection in the last few weeks. Finally he disabled the first one, a ward to detect any magical use or signatures. Followed up by the alarm if trespassers were on the property, then the anti-intruder ward, the ward to trap unauthorised personnel, and the ward that alerted the Order members to any potential trouble makers, just to name a few.
Looking around, Harry slowly opened the door and entered, closing it immediately behind him. The room was full of all sorts of peculiar items and furnished by dark wooden, luxurious items. He walked around to the other side of the desk, kneeling down in front of the drawers. Harry was just about to touch the desk when he felt a small ball of energy start to form. Maybe the room didn’t have any wards in place, but the desk did.
“You two made a bet?” he couldn’t help but laugh loudly in surprise.
“Come here,” quietly, yet angrily said Vernon. His face turning red slowly. “Now.”
“I will test out a small attack on one or two of them,” Drew continued, staring ahead. “I have never seen if being unconscious triggers the alarm, so I will use a Stupefy before cutting a small line on them. Bringing Charlie with me will help me monitor the changes in the wards while I experiment with the limitations.”
“Well if you need help understanding anything, I’ll be downstairs in Ginny’s room or the living areas, come find me,” she smiled sadly as she gave up before walking away.
Not only moments after he had arrived did the Dursley’s make their nightly appearance in the neighbourhood. Vernon and Dudley loudly opened the front door, in the middle of a shouting match with each other. Petunia came rushing out behind them, trying to simmer down the loud, waddling lards to save them from anymore embarrassment then they had already caused throughout the years. Harry couldn’t help but chuckle as he saw numerous neighbours angrily slam their windows shut and shoot dirty stares towards the family of three. Some lingered by their windows with angry glares, knowing exactly what would happen next.
This was exactly what Dumbledore did not want to happen. He wanted to keep Harry a secret from the rest of the wizarding world for as long as he could. And thanks to that idiotic Weasley child, his grand plans had been dashed in one day. Part of Dumbledore was glad the boy wasn’t here, otherwise he might not have had the self-control to restrain himself from strangling the child. He wondered how long until the majority of the wizarding world knew.
A smirk overtook Harry’s face as he studied the two and their behaviour. For him, it was easy to tell them apart. Fred, who was the first twin to approach him, had more freckles upon his cheeks than his brother did. He also seemed to have a more dominate aura around him, whereas, George seemed to have a more gentle approach to life. No doubt the two would test his observation skills throughout his stay. Beginning with this show of what was meant to baffle him.
“There has,” he simply nodded.
In silent agreement, the two travelled soundlessly in to the dark kitchen. Drew signalled for Charlie to stay at the entrance while he ventured further in, slowly searching around in the drawers and on the bench top as quietly as he could for a sharp knife. His efforts soon paid off as he opened a drawer to find a stash of cooking utensils, including a rather overly large butchers knife. He made sure his presence had not disturbed too much of the kitchen, not giving away their little scavenger hunt during the middle of the night.
The two stared at each other with kindness and sorrow as silence engulfed the room. Drew looked upon the tired illuminated face and knew how much of a toll this experience was taking on the young man already. He had not seen this look in a long time; not even the missions he has been sent on in the recent years caused this level of exhaustion. Through the mirror, he could feel some hesitancy from the other. He wondered what was plaguing the younger as he watched Harry’s eyes grow distant and a blank expression replacing the tiredly content look.
“May we stop by Sugarplum’s Sweet Shop before we leave?” Remus asked quietly, looking at the ground.
"Your day will come Gray," Harry said as he headed towards the stairs. "Patience is key."
“That’s so kind of you. May I possibly owl my parents so they aren’t worried where I have disappeared to?” Hermione asked with a wide smile.
Laughing darkly as Steven's face sunk, a mixture of horror and desperation overtaking his facial features. Harry pointed his knife downwards, lining up with his victim's chest. He stopped pacing as he stood slightly to the left of him.
Remus couldn’t move from the shock at what he had just witnessed. Harry Potter was sitting at the desk on the other side of the room, back to the door and head buried in a book. Yet he had opened the door wordlessly. He also thought the boy was too still if he had gone to put away his wand, not seeing the wand in his hand. Did that mean what he thought it did? Eyes trained on the head of jet-black hair, he forced himself to enter the room and close the door behind him.
Ron’s siblings chuckled as his face only grew redder by the second. All of the attention was now on him again, much to his horror. He knew he messed up. He knew he shouldn’t have said it that loudly. He knew his words could have led to some major consequences. But everything had worked out in the end, right? They managed to get out safely. Harry was still in one piece. So what people now knew he was back? The public was sure to find out sooner rather than later.
“Shut up,” Harry barked out, untangling his limbs and clothing from the other. He was in no mood for jokes.
“While yes it may be better to focus on things in a duel, Harry needs to also complete his O.W.L.s in order to be eligible to start his 7
Sighing heavily, Drew studied the face in front of him. Darkness surrounded the now blank facial features. He could tell that the younger one felt ashamed in his error. And while he too was shocked at the slip, he could partially understand why he would do what he did. Harry could be very antagonistic, as he learnt over the years. He fought for the right, he fought for the fair. So dealing with Dumbledore so often would be getting to him, more than he was probably comfortable with. Drew just knew he needed to take control of this situation before it got too out of his hands to fix.
With a foggy mind, Harry placed the warm coat upon his shoulders and wrapped the comfortable material around his cold body. He looked at Drew sheepishly before settling in, looking expectantly at the other. He was eager to hear how the night turned out.
Almost a millisecond after the handle left his fingers, an obnoxiously loud alarm blared in the distance. Harry’s head whipped around knowing exactly what that noise was. Someone was trying to get into his room. Sighing in irritation, he left all of his weapons abandoned on the ground as he took out his Nimbus 2000, flying like the wind back towards his room in the Burrow.
“Do you expect us to take time off work to do this?” Alastor Moody barked from the back of the room.
“Well?” he asked expectantly, uneasy with the silence.
“This is incredible,” Harry laughed as he put down his mirror, hearing a soft echo of his own voice emitting from Drew’s mirror. “A two-way mirror?”
It was late at night when an alarm had been ringing loudly in his quarters, waking him abruptly from his peaceful sleep. Dumbledore tiredly got out of his bed and made his way to the bathroom. As he relived his bladder, his sleepy mind was thinking of the potential exciting situations he would find upon arriving to the muggle neighbourhood. Aching bones slowed him down as he changed from his colourful pyjamas to one of his colourful robes. His foggy mind clouded his judgement, making him walk down several flights of stairs before he realised he could simply apparate from inside the castle to Privet Drive.
“Who are you,” Dumbledore asked after the standoff continued dragging on.
Thank you all so much for all of your kind comments and questions! Also I'd like to thank you for being patient with me while I wrote this extra long chapter. I hope you thoroughly enjoy it, please comment at the end of the chapter to let me know if you liked it.
While he may have lost the ability to access his enemy’s mind, not that he was complaining, he thankfully did not lose the unique ability to communicate in Parseltongue. Why that was a surprise to everyone that had been a part of the extraction process, Harry was thankful he didn’t lose the ability. At the end of the day, he saw it as just another advantage he had over people. Not only in his line of work, but in the looming war. Continuing to practice regularly as to not get sloppy. Over time he figured out and understood how he could quickly form relations with snakes of all kinds in case of a need in the future.
“I will. I’ve already collected some more personal information of how relationship stand, yes from a more bias viewpoint, within the walls of Hogwarts in our year level. Not anything too new, just more of the Gryffindor superiority and all Slytherin students are evil bullshit,” he scoffed with a slight agitated tone. “I’ve already had to tell myself today to get used to it because of where I am staying and who I’ll be interacting with in the future.”
“May I ask where you were all of these years?” he asked quietly, looking at the younger male with concern and worry.
again, Harry swore as he looked all around him for an exit. The only possible one was blocked by Lucius at this current time. Harry tried to throw two different stunning spells at the same time, one from his wand and one from his hand. The older deflected one and ducked out of the way of the other. Before things could get anymore out of hand, Harry needed to get out of there first.
Turning his attention to his clothes, he considered what he would actually need. He wondered if he should take only a few outfits to save the limited space. Not only that, but he didn’t need to take much considering he would be getting an entire new wardrobe from Madam Malkin’s Robes as part of his birthday gift. Keeping this in mind, he grabbed all of his pairs of underwear and socks, followed by two pairs of sweat pants, two plain black shorts, five plain black and white, short sleeved shirts, and finally four of his black, leather cloaks. That should get him through until he gets the chance to make a trip to Madam Malkin’s.
“It’s not your fault,” he smiled at her reassuringly.
“No don’t come any closer!” he suddenly yelled out.
“Good evening,” Dumbledore nodded his head. “I’ll see you all tomorrow morning.”
“My office, of course,” he smiled as he too leaned back.
“Couldn’t stay awake?” he asked with a soft smile upon his features.
“But Mum,” Ron whined with a huff.
“Gross, he didn’t flush,” Charlie whispered just before they heard a door open.
“Why?” he asked, straightening up in his chair.
A knock on the door interrupted whatever Remus was about to say. Poking his head in, Ron stared at the two for a moment. A blush slowly appeared on his pale cheeks as he opened the door wider. Silence dragged on as the redhead continued to just look between the two. The awkwardness and tension radiating off him in intense waves.
“No and yes,” he shrugged as he paused to take a sip of his glass full of pumpkin juice. “I have been overseas, but I was mainly in the United Kingdom.”
The irritation was clear on both of the twins faces. They were so used to being able to get answers out of anyone. Considering they lived with so many siblings, interrogations to extract information was there forte. Nothing was easily hidden from the twins and everyone knew that. Fred looked at George, the two thinking along the same lines as usual.
After Dumbledore had returned, his anger was finally unleashed in the privacy of his office. He became quickly lost in thought, stewing over it all. He had seen the way Minerva had looked at him both in the pensive and back in the office. Dumbledore had to make sure this brat didn’t spoil anymore relationships or respect with his sudden return. Severus was silent, unusually so. He wished he could enter the man’s mind to see what he thought on this arising situation. Was he truly going to train the boy without a fight? If so, he would need to do some good old meddling to ensure the respect between the two would not flourish.
“Incredibly hard, a lot of self-restraint is involved with each word I say. Although I have put him in his place a few times since my arrival. I believe he is starting to understand I am not going to be his little puppet he can control during this war. He hasn’t considered me while making decision, instead choosing to delegate matters without my consent,” he answered with a shrug.
“Sorry,” bashfully smiled Harry. “I didn’t mean to scare you.”
“I have a faint idea as to what that is,” Harry nodded his head slowly, looking back down at the pouch.
“I’m sure your spy within the inner circle of Voldemort’s Death Eaters has told you if Sirius Black is or ever has been a Death Eater,” he smirked.
Harry Potter sat perched on the rooftop directing across from his disgusting family’s house. He was hidden from their view by the chimney, never once being caught in all of the years he had spied on them. Even after all this time, anger and resentment heavily weighed on him as he watched them from afar. Harry had studied their routine for years. But never had he carried out any sort of revenge like he would desperately hope for when he was younger.
“No, everything’s fine. You usually feel it when I hurt.” Draco shrugged, hand slipping absentmindedly to his stomach, running over the place it’d hurt early that day. It wasn’t painful, just uncomfortable and the not knowing the cause of it all had thrown him a bit, but he couldn’t afford to be worried.
Draco whined, voice cracking from the abuse his throat had taken, but Harry couldn’t think of a better sound. His hips were relentless and Draco was trying his best to keep himself up on his elbows, head falling whenever Harry hit his prostate. A sudden thought crossed Draco’s mind and he wondered if any of the other Death Eater’s or Doctor’s from St. Mungo’s still had the Ward entry codes to the manor. He wondered what it’d be like to be caught and for a moment he stared at the oak doors ahead of him, the idea flipping something inside of him.
“What if,” Draco paused, cocking his head as he leant down to kiss Harry's sternum, “What if I sucked you off?” Harry raised an eyebrow, because Draco said this as if it were something they hadn’t done a million times. Harry opened his mouth to question it, only for Draco to cut in, “Whilst I have a vibrator in me.” Harry leant back and suddenly understood. He licked his lips and stared up at Draco, giving him a look that showed who was really in control. Harry didn’t need to say anything for Draco to begin summoning the toys from his room, “And you get to control it.” Draco added, handing Harry the remote before he reached between his legs and pressed the vibrator against himself. Harry sat up and stopped him, reaching down to take the toy from him and turn his body so he had his Omega’s ass in front of him.
“The Ministry letters.” Harry tried again, feeling like they were going to get nowhere in this discussion if he kept this up. Draco froze for a fraction of a second and put his toast on his plate, straightening himself out as he tried to look occupied with Teddy.
“It was nothing.” He smirked, running his hands down Draco’s toned arms and back up to his shoulders. Draco looked at him unimpressed, pulling away for a moment so Harry would take him seriously, “Fine, it was the Potions position at St Mungo’s, okay?” He finally admitted and Draco didn’t even seem surprised. He simply smiled and leant back into Harry’s chest, lips skating his sternum as he swallowed, thinking about his next words carefully.
“I don’t know if you felt it, but I had this- this sort of pain in my stomach earlier. It’s probably nothing, but it felt like the time I got hurt playing Quidditch at the Weasley’s.” Draco paused, chewing his food for a moment, “Maybe it’s just an Omega thing.” He shrugged, but Harry wasn’t quite done with the conversation.
” Draco whined out, thighs shaking irrationally as Harry leant back on his hands to scrutinise his handiwork. He’d never tire of seeing Draco like this.
“I’m fine, really.” He smiled gently, but didn’t put up a fight as Harry began flicking through his vitals and magical strength.
“Yes,
“I- Harry-
what Draco had wanted, but he knew that was the wrong answer, after all, he still had half a mind when in Heat.
“Look, Draco, I’m not going to ‘encourage’ you or push you because you’re stubborn and I don’t have the energy,” He paused, Draco frowning at him with annoyance, “But you’re good at Potions and that’s the department they want you for. They know we’re mated which means you’ll get allocated time off for Heats and you might even get to work with Hermione sometimes. I want you to do it because you want to, not because I said so. Just think about it, okay?” Harry sighed and placed the letter on his desk, Draco looked up at him now. He nodded once and leant forward in his chair. Harry tried to keep his eyes occupied on anything but the strain of fabric across Draco’s broad, toned chest. He couldn’t tell if it were the nearing Rut or just a good old dose of teenage lust.
It wasn’t long after Christmas that Draco got another letter from the Ministry of Magic- something about wanting to show wholesomeness in the community of the Wizarding World. It wasn’t the first time Harry had found various versions of the same letter scattered throughout the Manor, but this time, he decided Draco needed confronting about it.
“No, Draco, you don’t get to make the rules. You know that, baby.” And Harry knew damn well that the pet-name destroyed Draco over and over again. Harry knew exactly what cards to play and when to play them and right now he was playing an impeccable delay-tactic.
. He began down the hallway, smelling Draco’s scent stronger, but nowhere to be seen.
“I know, I-I’m not usually like this.” Draco responded quietly and he felt Harry shift under his chest, pulling him in closer as he intertwined their legs. The room was warm and it suddenly hit Draco that Harry had charmed the room to smell of peppermint, the one thing that calmed Draco after his Heats.
” Draco moaned out, reaching between them to grip at his now throbbing cock. Harry was quick to pin his arms back behind him, pushing him up onto the table and parting his legs that dangled from the end. Draco lost his last bit of restraint at the feeling of Harry’s tongue- especially when it was sucking at his entrance with such intensity that he thought this alone might make him cum. His head fell back against the dark wood, accentuating his pale features with a wild contrast that made Harry stare a moment longer. Draco was losing himself, fading in and out of his Omega instincts and not once wanting to fight it. His back arched upwards as Harry continued his assault and Draco was seriously trying to remember if this was supposed to be a punishment or not.
“You left me.” Harry growled, between harsh kisses, tearing the blanket that covered Draco’s body in two. Draco watched it fall to the floor and gasped at the sudden pressure Harry’s hand had against his cock. He wanted to tell Harry that he hadn’t meant to leave him and that there was no reason to be jealous or angry, but his mind was slipping from any conscious thoughts and his Omega façadé was crawling back to him. Harry swung the both of them around, pinning Draco’s hips against the long entrance hall table as their naked bodies brushed against one another.
“Can you move?” Harry asked, running his thumbs down the backs of Draco’s thighs and watching as he nodded his response, “Good, then turn around for me.” He watched as Draco carefully pulled himself onto his knees and turned to face Harry, sitting diligently, waiting patiently. Harry nodded once and got to his feet, the vibe remote clutched in his hand.
“Thanks,” He mumbled, hesitating a moment before he continued, “Harry, do you- do you maybe want to sleep in my room tonight?”
“Why? Did you want this to be quick, Draco? Did you want me to fuck you straight away and leave you begging for more? Is that it?” Harry asked, slowly leaning over Draco’s body, entrapping him between the polished ebony and his chest, whispering low against the shell of his ear. It really was quite a question, because that is
“I-I’m sorry, Alpha. I’ll be good, I promise.” Draco mumbled, against his will. Harry smirked, diving back down to tongue at his soft heat. His eyes were filled with lust and Harry didn’t miss the way his ass seemed to curve perfectly against him, it was too good to be true. It wasn’t long before Harry was tongue-fucking him, Draco scrabbling against the polished wood, the leash falling against his biceps as his body jolted.
. I went into Heat first, I need you to tou-” Draco was arguing and he knew Harry wouldn’t let him get away with it, but in some ways he loved that. He wanted a
“Only my tongue.” Harry pulled back, confirming Draco’s thoughts and he was letting out a shaky breath in response, thrashing his head from side-to-side against his forearms on the desk.
“Draco, where are you?” Harry called out, wondering if he’d even hear him. A thought crossed his mind, suddenly thinking Draco might have left the Manor altogether, but he was sure Draco still had half a mind. Silence came as an answer and he turned the corner to make his way to Draco’s office in the South Wing. He could hear him now, smell his scent like a cologne on his collar and could feel his own Rut barely beginning.
“I didn’t feel it.” Harry frowned, normally he felt it whenever Draco felt pain, but at the Weasley’s and today he hadn’t felt it, “I could tell you were anxious this morning after you’d left, but I just assumed it was about the new job.” Harry said, putting his plate aside and crossing the room to kneel in front of him.
“Mm, yes-yes, Harry.” He didn’t recognise his own voice, but that didn’t matter because Harry was pulling him to his feet and peeling his jeans off and pushing everything off the desk.
“Shouldn’t I be the one to be worried?” Draco asked, a little amused, but Harry just smiled sadly and it was only making Draco more anxious, “Is it because I won’t be here as often to look after Teddy? Because if that’s it, then I don’t have to apply. I’m more than happy to stay-”
Draco cut himself off as Harry suddenly gripped harshly at the base of his cock, pushing his legs further apart for him to climb onto the table and sit between them.
“Are you okay? You’re not usually like this after Heats.” Harry asked, carding his fingers gently through Draco’s hair and scenting him without asking, “I’m sorry, it’s just you’re never like this, I’m worried.” Harry answered, continuing to card his hand, rhythmically, through Draco’s hair. He knew how much Draco hated it when he fussed.
Over breakfast was when Harry decided to bring it up. Their Heats would start in less than two weeks and he knew that Draco would be too filled with lust to keep his mind straight if he pushed it back any further.
“Will you see them? The Ministry, I mean.” Harry mumbled, swiping his fingertips into the excess jam strewn across the plate. Draco tensed up and finally brought his full attention to Harry,
“You can take it, Draco.” He heard Harry murmur, leaning over his body as gripped onto Draco’s thighs, taking the toy into his hands and pulling it out a little to watch his rim catch against the silicone as he slowly fucked him. He finally began pushing back in, Draco managing more of his cock and more of the dildo at the same time. Harry felt him groan again as he pushed the dildo further than before, watching the toy fill out his stomach, making it bulge slightly as he pushed on. Draco pulled back from Harry’s cock, breathless and sobbing,
“Harry, I want to make you feel good too.” Draco uttered, desperately trying to catch his breath as he spoke. Harry looked down at him from their place on the floor and smirked,
.” He bit his lip, waiting for Harry’s response, but none came.
, please!” He whined and Harry could hear the hint of a sob in his voice, smirking and pressing his tip to Draco’s hole, then pushing all the way in. He could almost feel himself losing it from the very sounds Draco was emitting, the way he sounded so desperate and needy and
“But just remember that if you start and find it’s not what you want to do, we both have enough money to support us and Teddy both. If you don’t enjoy it, you can leave, okay?” Harry said softly and Draco nodded his agreement.
“What do you mean?” Harry asked quietly, fingers brushing Draco’s hipbone through the waistband of his underwear.
“Draco, are you busy?” Harry asked, restlessly shifting on his feet. He always got this way when their Heat was nearing and Draco could sense it, even when Harry was across the Manor from him.
“Harry! Harry, oh my god! Harry it’s amazing!” Draco was running down the South Wing corridor, losing all composure as he clutched an armful of viles, “Harry, Harry!” He was met by a harsh ‘shushing’ sound and only then did Draco realise it was Teddy’s bedtime. He mumbled an apology under his breath as he looked up at Harry who was silently shutting Teddy’s bedroom door and casting an amplifying charm for them to sit in the living room down the hallway.
So this is where the prejudice will come out, huh? Harry shifted in his chair slightly, straightening his back and nodding in intrigue. This is the juicy information he wanted to honestly hear about. He of course already knew about the supposed ‘feud’ between the two houses, but he wish he could speak up and tell the boy he was wrong. Not all Slytherin’s are like that, not all of them end up followers of Voldemort. It was quite ludicrous to think of that, and he wondered who planted that seed in his and many others mind.
“Yeah,” said Remus with a small blush appearing on his cheeks.
“Yeah?” he asked with a sigh.
“Dudley, in life we have to teach those disobedient to us lessons. How about you teach your cousin a lesson as to why he shouldn’t touch what isn’t his,” Vernon smiled, making Minerva shiver in disgust.
Not knowing that the Headmaster of Hogwarts was currently wondering where he was, Harry Potter was serenely asleep in his bed. Blissfully unaware of all the chaos and turmoil he was causing half way across the country. Harry briefly awoke from his slumber at the sound of a creaking floor board from inside his room. Not wanting to alert whoever was currently standing near him that he was indeed awake, he turned over on to his left side. Now with his back facing the intruder and body obstructing his movement, he slowly slid his right hand under his pillow until his fingers touched the cold metal handle of his favourite knife.
A timid, skinny elf appeared in the middle of the room. He was already in a deep bow with his nose touching the ground. Harry looked upon the creature with pity as it shook in its place. While he wasn’t against owning house elves, he was wholly against the abuse they were often subjected to under the ownership of most pure-blooded and some half-blooded families.
As Harry finished talking, he walked back over to Steven's head and squatted down beside him. He crushed one of the photos with his boot on purpose, symbolising how the predator was about to become the victim. He watched as a stray tear ran down the blemished cheek and down to the floor. Part of him wanted to mess with the other by wiping it away for him. He reached forward, seeing the other wince at his approach, and with the tip of his knife, he wiped the stray tear away. Making sure to get up close and personal with his eye.
The group laughed in unison, leave it to Parker to ruin the moment with his insatiable appetite. Harry led the charge by being the first to fill up his plate. Although he didn’t mind opening presents this year, he was rather keen to eat and get on with his day. His mind filled with a plan on what he was going to do for the rest of the day. He wanted to train with his new weapons, wanting to get used to them in advance for tomorrow night. He also needed to get ready for leaving, a process that would take quite some time. Harry looked around the room as he ate in silence, observing conversations and silently thanking all of the people there for their continued support and love.
“Thank you for your help, Kingsley,” said Dumbledore as he forced a kind twinkle in his eyes. “Now let’s move on to making our training schedule for Harry.”
Drew merely nodded in acknowledgement. He knew and trusted Harry enough to look after himself. Everything he had taught him over the years was finally beginning to show. All of the life lessons, work ethics, becoming a self-sustained man was all shining through the once scared young boy he took in. As he sipped his drink and watched Harry stare blankly out the window, an intense wave of proudness bubbled up in the middle of his chest.
Upon opening his eyes, Harry saw the stunned looks on both of their faces. He smirked, knowing he had that effect on some people. While he was eager to hear what they had to say, he also wanted to get comfortable. And at this rate it would take the twins some time to get the words out. Shrugging off his coat, his lean form was revealed, along with his extra weaponry that he carried with him. Harry didn't mind the two sets of eyes that keenly ran up and down his body. He took off his two bicep holders and placed them on his bedside table.
"But I must assure you that the ward that was activated last night felt like a third party," Dumbledore spoke loudly above the noise, trying to reign in the group. "That is why I was very surprised when we saw what had happened upon arrival."
"I have my sources," he smirked with a glint in his eyes.
Harry continued opening the rest of his small pile of presents. He received them from only those that dared give him one. Many knowing how uncomfortable the whole process and day made him. He was grateful for having such understanding people in his life. He had received some more books to add to his collection, an array of candy for his devilish sweet tooth, the 12 piece set of Black Kunai Throwing Knives with two sheaths that Drew insisted on getting him, as well as a few new bullseye targets for his practice. That left him with one small, unopened gift. The group what in anticipation as Harry tore away the wrapping paper to reveal a key card for Madam Malkin's Robes. Frowning, he looked around for an explanation as to what he was holding in his hands.
Nodding his head, Dumbledore moved passed the group and headed over to the only house with lights on. He controlled his breathing and kept his heart from beating too quickly. Anxiety flared through him. This could only be one thing; an attack on the Dursley’s from Voldemort and his lackies. The biggest fear he had was to find them all dead. Once he found Harry, he would have the unfortunate news of telling the poor boy his only living relatives were perished. He needed the boy to be able to concentrate on training rather than grieving.
There was no need to ask if Charlie had already done it because he trusted the other to stick to the training he taught. They stayed silent as the two of them watched the street with intensity. The seconds turned to minutes as the street continued to be void of all movement. However, it didn’t remain that way for much longer when a loud bang alerted them to the presence of someone new. They eyes roamed the street, looking for the person. Drew frowned as he continued to struggle locating them.
“Why not?” he asked as he stood up from the bed.
"Maybe he was under our noses this whole time and we just turned a blind eye to any and all signs?" Fred instinctively turned his head to look back at his brother when he felt the eyes on him.
Harry squatted down where he stood, placing the grey, metal box to the side before placing his hands either side of Steven's head and leaning forwards. He leant right in, too close for the other's comfort as he turned his head away from the invasive action. He let his warm breath graze over his victim's skin, watching in satisfaction as the other squirmed away from him.
The noisy engine was shut off and silence engulfed the street once more. A second later, the door swung open and out came a tall male, dressed in a pristine uniform. He knew instantly this was his target; Steven Riggs. The male stretched his tired body before grabbing his briefcase and coat from the back seat. Harry watched intently as the target begun to finally walk towards his home, taking his sweet arse time. Steven tiredly locked his car over his shoulder as he fumbled with his keys at his front door.
He once again held his hand over his mokeskin pouch, summoning the items he would require to write a letter back to Grayson. Lining the ink pot, quill, letter and paper out on the desk before him, he got ready to start his reply. Picking the quill up, he dipped the tip into the ink pot, making sure nothing would drip as he brought it over to the paper. Harry had just started writing when he heard a knock on the door. He rolled his eyes in irritation before unlocking and opening the door from where he sat. Turning to see which Weasley was disturbing him this time.
“Avenseguim,” he whispered and repeated the same wand movement as before.
"You read books to pass the time?" Ron snorted. "Hermione will love you."
Harry sighed again as he walked into his private bathroom. He pulled the knife out of its sheath that was wrapped around his calf while turning the sink's hot water tap on with his other hand. He slowly ran the knife under the water, watching in satisfaction as the ruby red blood dripped and mixed in with the water.
Currently he was sprawled out on his bed, staring at the ceiling. The room was darkly lit from the moonlight streaming in through the window. His ears were filled by the muffled voices floating up from downstairs. Thinking back on the day, he was truly fatigued by the events. It was amusing, somewhat, how he felt so drained from one day around them all compared to his profession he did for a living. One would think researching, stalking and executing many assassin attempts would be more taxing on him. But perhaps his body and mind was conditioned to the job from the years of training. He was used to a life of privacy and seclusion, the complete opposite of anything that occurred in this household.
“Wakey-wakey,” Drew’s low voice echoed throughout the room, sending shivers down Charlie’s spine and enticing Petunia from slumber.
“Turned up?” the smart girl observed. “Meaning he wasn’t found?”
“Fred! George! Leave your sister alone,” Molly disapprovingly said as she plated some more bacon that was quickly disappearing.
“Harry?” Parker asked in utter shock. “Harry is that really you?”
Harry slowed down as he approached the quiet town of Little Whinging, knowing exactly where the street in question was located from where hovered. Having travelled this route many times, he could have probably navigated his way to the Dursley’s house with his eyes closed. Quickly descending from the sky, his eyes were trained on the roof he was about to land on. Before he crashed into said roof, he pulled up the handle of his broom, floating inches above the dirty, red tiles. Softly climbing off of his broom and onto the roof below, Harry made his way immediately to squat beside the chimney.
“I am,” he chuckled lightly.
The room was full. Full of people, full of emotions, full of magic. An old wizard sat behind the desk pinching the bridge of his nose as he tried to focus on anything but the talk of the other order members in attendance.
“Of course, I’m sure you can help Harry study the other subjects for his O.W.L.s,” smiled Dumbledore, hoping perhaps with the help from Remus he could keep the boy in control with the his plans. “Anyone else?”
The car pulled into the driveway and shut off moments later. Two large men hopped out of the car, the vehicle instantly lifting a few centimetres up from the ground once the heavy humans exited. The two made their way inside, heading to the back of the house ready for their dinner to be served to them like ravenous kings. Harry got comfortable in his position on the roof, knowing he needed to wait until the streets were fully covered in darkness and the residents of Privet Drive had settled in for the night. He would wait all night if he had too, taking advantage of the right time to go in his favour.
“I-I did,” stuttered Remus with a confused look upon his face.
"What do you mean?" all kindness void in his voice and eyes. "Have I took you back after your acts of betrayal? Have I not offered you a job in a world that would have shunned you? Have I not been anything but kind too you?"
“Excited isn’t the word I would use. Intrigued, yes,” Harry said, placing the book behind him on the desk and crossing his legs together with his hands clasped together on his knees. “You mentioned you played for the Gryffindor team, so that is your house?”
This encounter tonight had not gone as Dumbledore had wished it had. He envisioned how it would have unfolded when he first found the missing Boy Who Lived many times, and today was not one of them. Not only had he not pried vital information from the boy, but he had learnt how infuriatingly disrespectful he was. There was something not quite right with him and he needed to figure it out quickly. There was something strange with how Harry conducted himself, how much he knew about old forms of magic, the weapons he carried with him. Dumbledore needed to learn about his past. One way or another, he would find out. Nothing was going to be kept from him. Not anymore.
“Why Headmaster Dumbledore!” Molly Weasley loudly exclaimed as the door flung open. “Come in, come in!”
“That’s okay,” sighed Remus, knowing he needed to build up way more trust before he could start delving into his past. “I just wanted to know if you have been safe and well cared for. And maybe thank those people one day for taking good care of you.”
“Will do sir,” Harry straightened up and nodded.
“Now that I have your attention,” Dumbledore sighed tiredly, running a hand down his face. “Let’s discuss things, shall we?”
"Yes?" they both answered, confusion laced through their voices.
“Reveal yourself coward,” Lucius yelled as he sent a vicious ‘
It took all of Harry’s will not to laugh or snicker as he successfully made his way out of the smoke filled corridor. He quickly raised his hands and cleared all trace of his magical signature from the entire house. His head whipped up the stairs as he heard people walking down them, only to find Draco and his four friends storming down. Without any more hesitation, Harry ran for the entry, not even looking back as he heard a shout. Harry slammed open the front door and ran directly to Parker.
“And you know no one can access it since he is in prison, correct?” he continued asking in disbelief.
Knowing all too well what was about to happen, Harry rolled backwards to get further away from Drew. His body was low to the ground with his right leg outstretched to the side, left leg crouched taking majority of the weight, left hand flat on the ground for support and his right hand pointing his wand at his mentor. Before his eyes could fully focus, a spell was being sent his way followed immediately by the silver handed dagger. He didn’t have enough time to dodge the spell so he threw up a quick
Walking in from the kitchen after overhearing the entire conversation, Molly looked upon the bushy haired girl with kindness. Any extra hands helping Harry during this next month would be appreciated. Well, at least in her own eyes. Although she knew the decision would ultimately need to be approved by Headmaster Dumbledore in the end. The young girl was very bright for her age, so there really should be no issue.
“Might make Harry’s job that bit easier if they still haven’t noticed in a week,” he mused, also shaking his head.
The room erupted in a fit of rage. To think they had wasted the Order's time with this episode of domestic violence instead of resting or searching for the missing boy infuriated many of them. This was the exact scenario that they had feared would happen, especially when it was during the middle of the night. The anger at the way things were being handled, the way they were being instructed, didn't sit well with the group anymore. They wanted change and they wanted it now.
“Harry,” his body not flinching at all, Harry turned his head to the side and smiled as he saw the white, glowing figure of a patronus. “New mission. Come back immediately.”
“Dibs on not telling our Lord that we’re going to Diagon Alley.”
Four days of hard work. Bags were becoming purses of black under his eyes as he worked tirelessly into the night, before throwing a rug on top of the circle as soon as the sun broke the horizon. Then he’d suffer through James dragging him to breakfast where he’d sit silently and they’d all ignore the bruises and the fact Hadrian could barely walk without leaving a blood trail behind him from his leg. Lily shot her husband concerned looks, and Alex was wary, but reassured by his father easily enough. Enough that he had the audacity to tell Hadrian that the sooner he behaved and got ungrounded the sooner they could fly together and get homeschooled together.
, so quick-witted.” Draco responded, whispering the last part under his breath, but Harry was laughing now and Draco couldn’t get enough of that sound. Once Harry had composed himself he knotted his fingers in Draco’s hair, knowing how much Draco hated that, and let out a long sigh, “Really, Harry, I’ll be fine. I want to do this and we can be like a real family this way. It’ll be like playing house, except you’ll have an actual child and I’ll have an actual job.” Draco continued and Harry couldn’t help but smile at how soft Draco’s words were. Harry knew this was the Draco he’d fallen in love with and couldn’t help but want to tell him so. He grit his teeth instead.
“H-Harry?” He called, voice coming out croaked and dry, not that he hadn't expected it. The sound of the water running must mean Harry was in the shower, but Draco couldn’t bring himself to move. He whimpered, feeling the slightest bit alone and trying not to be pathetic. Nestling further into the sheets he tried not to cry, running his hands over his waist and thighs as if they were Harry’s and he wasn’t alone-
With a blink of Draco’s eye, Hadrian had whipped out his wand. A rather plain, but efficient weapon as with a flick of his wrist and a murmur all the candles in the house flickered to life. An impressive show of magic, Draco had half a mind to swoon. Especially as the tension seemed to relax and dissipate almost immediately once Hadrian’s wand rested innocently on the table. His mother smiled brightly.
“Holy, you both look like my brother and don’t look like him at all. That’s a weird line to tip toe and I don’t like it. Still. Wild.”
A sudden fear gripped Sirius. He knew what a horocrux was. If it was ever released. If Albus or James ever released it out of spite or to try and gain control of Hadrian it would be over. The press would call for his blood and the Ministry would stop at nothing until his little boy was thrown through the veil or kissed. They wouldn’t look for a solution. They would be like James and think only of themselves, rather than a little boy who deserved to live. A victim.
Immediately upon discovering where he was Hadrian pulled out his wand and locked the door. Whipping his head around his eyes caught onto a trunk at the end of the bed. The letters
It couldn’t be happening.
Then he’d lit up and she’d seen her little boy again. Only this time he was in the arms of actual strangers. Holding a child that wasn’t his sister and treating her with all the tenderness he’d rejected showing his real brother. Looking up to women who weren’t
“Malfoy Manor is out of bounds. The Prince Manor will probably be under close watch, and our other properties have been sold or destroyed.” His lord sighed softly. “I can’t think of anywhere that would be inconspicuous. An inn could turn us out, anyone have a house, not on the records?”
“Lucius, Hadrian is selectively mute. Would his sister be allowed to be present? She often helps him get his message across and keeps him grounded.”
Instead of walking over to grab the knife, Harry simply levitated it back to him. The knife had been thrown countless of times since he received them this morning, utterly destroying one of the handful of new targets. He looked down at his red, irritated hand. The cord wrapped around the handle started to rub away at his skin, the repetitive movement and tight grip not helping for this extended target practice. He ignored the stinging pain as he plucked the floating knife from thin air. He steadied his breathing, focused his eyes on the bullseye, listened to the surrounding environment and cleared his thoughts from his mind. Bringing his arm back, he flung the handle of the knife with force, causing it to spin in fast circles before it once again hit the target impeccably in the middle.
“We win!” screeched Dudley as he blindly threw a couple of punches into the dog pile before sloppily standing up. “We won Harry Hunting!”
Harry chuckled to himself as he sat back and watched the events unfold. He watched as each person walked in to the house and almost instantly walking back out. Well except for a few, the ones that are used to seeing stuff like that or that don’t have a weak stomach. Molly was frantically trying to keep her kids out of the house, while simultaneously trying to help Petunia and Dudley out of the house. He couldn’t help but roll his eyes, finding her overbearing motherly actions too much even from this distance. She finally succeeded in getting the two surviving Dursley’s out of the way from the busied Auror’s.
While he was thoroughly impressed the double spy agent thought to look outside the main crime scene, it did put Harry at risk of being exposed. As the cold, black eyes searched the rooftops of the surrounding houses, he momentarily hid fully behind the chimney. He stayed with his back fully against the brick structure and face overlooking the backyard of the property he was on, for more than a few minutes. Taking a deep breath, he turned his head and slightly peered over the edge of the chimney and saw the coast was once again clear to resume his normal position.
Picking up his wand from the bedside table, Drew pointed his wand at Petunia. He was entirely pleased with how the wound and cut looked as well as the placement of the offending ‘weapon’. Both muggle police and the Order wouldn’t know he or Charlie had been there. He would make sure this was the perfect crime scene. An open and shut case. Perhaps a confusing one for the dim witted muggle cops, but that wasn’t his fault. With a smirk firm on his face, he casted a silent
The familiar scenery of the Weasley's land came in to view as Harry landed on the soft grass after being side along apparated by Bill Weasley. The small trip up to the Burrow was filled with silence. The family surprised by what had occurred during the meeting. Although the twins seemed to be the least shocked out of them all. Considering they already noticed things about the young man that were unusual. Both the twins looked at each other before looking at Harry who was slightly behind all of them. They understood each other without having to say a word; they needed to get to the bottom of things now.
The room was filled with a tense and sadden silence as Minerva immediately started crying the second her eyes laid upon the young man in front of her. She made her way to the chair she had sat in before with shaky legs. While Severus continued to stand near the pensive, his head hung in pure shame. Shame for letting another kid like him suffer a childhood no one should endure. Dumbledore glared at the young man sitting smugly in his seat, his face turning redder the more he stared into those green, glistening eyes. The brat spilling some of his most well-kept secrets in a matter of an hour.
Harry wiped some of the mist away from the mirror, finding bright green eyes staring back at him. Lifting up his damp hair from his forehead, he stared directly at the faintest scar shaped in a lighting scar. He traced his finger over the scar, thinking back on the memories of how it got to this point. When he had come into Drew’s care, the older noticed small little signs that something wasn’t right with Harry’s magical core. Something was lurking within that was draining his magical core, something that was dark and dangerous. Through one of his many connections in the wizarding  world, he was able to discover two different, very old, branches of magic had been used on the night of his parent’s death; a sacrificial protection and an accidental creation of a Horcrux.
“Harry?” Malfoy’s voice whispered from somewhere back near the door. Harry turned his head and saw Snape standing next to him and a very concerned Malfoy at the portrait.
As if right on cue, Steven emerged out of his bedroom dressed in a baggy, white t-shirt and plain, grey sweatpants. He rubbed his face tiredly as he begun to descend the stairs, only to freeze as his eyes laid upon a figure standing in his house. Blinking to see if the darkly dressed figure would disappear, he shook his head in confusion.
year. This process will undoubtedly take up a lot of the time to catch him up to the levels of his peers, regardless of how much he may or may not know now,” he replied, trying to keep his anger hidden to the best of his ability.
“He has been fairly secretive and reclusive since getting here,” continued Fred.
“Our time and efforts throughout the years have finally paid off,” Dumbledore begun his grand speech, feeling the entire room hold its breath, the energy spurring him on. “From today, our focus as The Order of the Phoenix will no longer be centred around searching for Harry Potter. Instead,” he paused to place a firm hand on Harry’s shoulder, “we will be training him ready for his inevitable fight against The Dark Lord Voldemort.”
“Glad to have you here, Harry,” Arthur nodded with a kind smile upon his face. “I’m sure you must be tired. Why don’t we get you settled in, huh?”
As if he would spill his secrets to someone he had didn't know very well. He struggled to not roll his eyes even though the other boy couldn't see him. It was quite laughable really. Everyone here just expected him to answer all questions honestly, like he owed it to them for going missing most of his life. Hopefully Dumbledore and his little sheep would get it through their thick heads soon, much like the twins had realised today.
“I’m going to need it,” Kingsley laughed darkly before waving goodbye to the group and walking out of the house.
“I’ll be prepared for a duel if I know where the damn book is located,” he grunted before gently shoving Parker along. “Do you know where it is?”
With a smile on his face, Harry turned around and sat down in the chair next to where Minerva had been sitting. He got comfortable, resting his boots on the edge of the Headmaster’s desk. Smirking as he knew how much that it would once again annoy the old coot after he resurfaced from the memories. He pulled out his Blackhawk Tatang knife from its sheath and absentmindedly twirled the sharp tip on his left pointer finger as he waited. Bored out of his mind, he threw his head back and looked at the office upside down from where he sat.
“Perhaps,” a smirk sat firm on his face, not giving away anything.
“Okay,” he hiccupped, finally relenting and standing up straight in front of Harry.
“As I was saying, the search for Harry Potter is finally over. We are going to need to keep this extremely quiet for the next couple of weeks. No one is to know he has been found. This information you learn today does not leave this room until we are ready to let the public know. Is this understood?” Dumbledore asked with a stern gaze.
“You are not wrong,” he chuckled and looked over his shoulder at Harry with amusement. “However making and maintaining friends should be the least of your worries. As you know, you’ll be around people we have identified to be suspicious and dangerous.”
“No,” Harry said.
“Yes master Draco, right away Dobby will do that,” the elf stammered out before clicking his fingers, Dobby and the brooms disappeared within an instant.
Remus completely understood and respected the need for privacy around Harry’s past. And he was rather grateful the other did answer some of his questions today, even if they weren’t directly answering what he was asking. He noticed the willingness to open up just a little and appreciated that. With a smile on his face after realising that small detail, Remus walked down into the kitchen and sat beside an empty spot next to Nymphadora.
Drew shook his head as he walked in to the kitchen, nodding to the people that acknowledged his presence. He lent down in to the fridge, seeking his meal he had put aside.
With his large cousin now out of the way with a full body-binding curse, Harry scoffed as he turned his attention back to his slicing. He managed to finally separate the member from the hand, watching with glee as his uncle’s eyes rolled back in his head and passed out from the pain he was undergoing. Although, as much as it was easier to do his work without a fight, he was feeling quite sadistic right now. He wanted to be able to revel in the pain, to see each moment he hit the right nerve, to know that he was experiencing just as much pain that he had inflicted with these fingers.
“You know why, Drew,” Harry shook his head as he sat down, his tired body agreeing in relief.
“And?” he probed as the Headmaster refused to comment further.
Snaking his way between the bushes and the path, Harry kept one eye on the group at all times while the other eye stayed on the house. Once again he crouched down behind a hedge, this time scouting out possible ways to enter the house. He scoured the building, looking for any windows open or any doors that had been left open. Smirking once he realised a window had indeed been left opened on the second storey floor.
Snape rubbed Harry’s arms and helped soothe the young man with words of comfort. Once Harry had finally calmed down and was only sniffling, Snape stopped rubbing his arm and decided to tell him. He knew that Malfoy was definitely going to kill him.
Harry stood up shakily and begun to walk towards his uncle with both hands hiding the book behind his back. He kept his head downcast, afraid to even remotely look in the direction of Vernon. Coming to stop a few steps away from the overpowering man, he stayed still in silence in hopes he could get away without getting hurt. A full minute passed by in utter silence. No one in the room moved an inch, not a single word was muttered.
“I did,” Alastor Moody spoke up for the first time during the meeting.
“Well I wouldn’t say the entire wizarding world. I would say the British wizarding world, yes, because that is where Voldemort is. I know I wasn’t being looked for in the American wizarding world or any other country,” he tilted his head almost mockingly.
The statement took Harry aback slightly. He knew eventually the other man would bring up his parents, but he had never heard anything like this before. Sure, Harry knew about them. He had done research on them. Growing up never really knowing anything about them but what is written on paper, he felt quite detached from them. Hearing he looked like them and that he was smart like Lily, it left him feeling a little unnerved.
“The Sorting Hat will put me in the best house suited for me, Remus,” Harry stopped walking and turned around to stare up at the man. “You should know this having attended Hogwarts before.”
“You heard that too, right?” one of the unknown males said, voice deep but not as deep as the one before.
“Rennervate!” he yelled furiously, the red light coming straight out of his left palm with speed.
In the kitchen stood two new people, Minerva and Nymphadora, as well as Severus. They must have arrived not long ago since he walked in to their conversation of what the other male had seen as of yet. Dumbledore sighed heavily as he stood amongst the group. They all looked expectantly at him, awaiting to hear what he had found.
“I know, me too,” he sighed as he squeezed the other a bit tighter to comfort him.
As Harry closed the wardrobe doors he looked out of his window and up at the bright, twinkling stars. Mesmerised by the beauty, he walked closer to his window. He took a second just to stare at the clear night sky as he calmed his mind and body, preparing himself for the events ahead. Knowing he didn’t have much longer until Drew’s time limit was up. Just as Harry started to turn and take a step away from the window, his eyes caught sight of a still figure waiting with their back to the house.
Harry stepped back and held up his left hand. He flicked his wrist and with the tiniest pop, the door to the cell was opened. Harry moved forwards, opening the door, before he dragged Parker’s right arm around his shoulders to help carry his friend out. He silently cast a Disillusionment charm on them both as they begun slowly walking towards the exit.
Many shook their heads as they took in the sight of the young man who claimed to be the missing child. Although they could see attributes of the child’s parents within him, there was no way this was the one and only Harry Potter. Severus continued to train his wand directly at the stranger’s head, mesmerised by the same green eyes his childhood best friend had. The words slowly seemed to absorb and realisation dawned at who he was pointing his wand at. Shame took over many as they slowly lowered their wands. While a few remained on the cautious side and continued on with their wands pointing at the boy.
“I knew an idiot like you wouldn’t be able to follow the simplest of instructions!” Petunia’s shrill voice yelled loudly, making sure to slam the front door closed behind her.
Drew nodded to Harry, signalling he would, before placing the mirror down and disappearing from Harry’s sight. He too put the mirror back on his bedside table. As soon as he retracted his hand, he non-verbally cancelled the ‘Lumos’ spell on his wand. He placed his wand away before sinking back in the mattress below him. Exhaustion taking over his body from head to toe. The pitch black room engulfed him in a strangely comforting way, the silence deafening for once. And while his mind tried to replay the conversation over again in his head, his body enticed him into slipping away into unconsciousness before realising it. Perhaps it was the shame for messing up, or perhaps he was emotionally drained. But Harry slept well compared to the sleep he had on the first night he had arrived.
“You really think Sirius is innocent and Peter is still alive?” Remus asked after the silence stretched on.
Harry knelt down yet again. This time he straddled his upper thighs with the most devilish smile on his face. He reached up and moved the ropes away from the vicinity he needed to get to; the pelvic area. Harry traced his knife down the left hip bone, then the right, relishing in the desperate writhing beneath him. He brushed over the slightly bump in the grey pants, watching his chest rise and fall hurried motions. The torture continuing on for as long as he pleased, knowing it'll all be over soon enough. Pulling down the grey sweatpants, Harry was disgusted at the sight that lay before his eyes. The most despicable, ugly looking, below average sized penis stared back at him.
“Okay, I’ll make sure he hears it from you,” she smiled sadly, looking at the young man with sympathy. “Good evening, Headmaster.”
The environment around Harry and Dumbledore changed as the familiar sensation of apparating overtook the two. Suddenly their feet hit the moist grass and the sound of a peaceful country night filled their ears. Harry looked upon the familiar worn down house of the Weasley’s house; or the Burrow as the family so affectionately called it in public. He could feel the large amount of magic that was in place to keep the several stories from toppling over.
“So you are aware that Sev will be made aware of this situation and that he must have a look through the journal?” questioned Malfoy, placing his coffee on the little coffee table to the side of the couch.
"Whatever you want," they said in unison.
"What you said in the Order meeting about Peter Pettigrew," started Fred.
Running his finger along the spines of his neatly stacked books, debating which shall be chosen to make the journey with him. Grabbing book after book with the topics of combat, spell work, duels, and muggle special ops techniques, he levitated them over to his desk. Forming a decent pile of books to reread in his spare time, he turned his attention over to his weapon artillery stored in his wardrobe. Wondering if he should just take everything as he opened the middle drawer to reveal the many sparkling clean weapons. Deciding he could never be over prepared, he simply flicked his hand and sent the entire lot over to lay in neat rows on his desk, repeating the process with all his holsters and sheaths.
Steven violent shook his head in denial making Harry let out a roaring laugh. He continued torturing him for a few more seconds before he frowned and tilted his head, deep in thought about what he wanted to be carved into Steven's chest. It couldn't be too long, or too short. It needed to fit him, needed to describe the type of person he was. Perhaps predator will do? Or leech. Maybe even deadbeat. Parasite might suit him. Harry thought some more, none of them sitting right with him. Then the perfect word came to mind. Scum. Yes, that wasn't too short or long, and described Steven absolutely
Harry rolled his eyes as he heard the outburst from his position all the way up in the office. Anticipating the arrival of the group, he checked that the hood of his cloak was fully hiding his identity. The entire group first seemed oblivious to his presence as the room was quickly filled, much to Harry’s loathing. He eagerly watched as Order members begun to pause and instantly raise their wand at the intruder. His eyes scanned the room, looking at each person and their position to form possible escape routes if need be, before landing on black familiar eyes that stared directly back at him. A frown ever so slightly present on the harsh, pointy features of Severus Snape.
“Need help?” her eyes lit up with sparkles at the prospect of being able to help. “I’m pretty good with spells. I could explain them to you if they are too complex. Or show you how to perform them. Or-”
“Really?” Drew chuckled in surprise.
Now his next problem was trying to locate where Parker would be. Knowing the history of pure-bloods, it wouldn’t be an uncommon occurrence to have a cellar big enough to detain a few prisoners. Thinking for a few seconds on the best solution, he knew he would have to risk a small chance of being caught. He would need to use a version of the revealing charm.
century, many based in the middle of giant blocks of well-maintained land. This sure did look like the type of area a pure-blooded, rich family would buy and live. And Harry was correct in assuming as the pocketknife begun to slow in it’s travel and turned to what looked like a gravel driveway that led to the middle of an empty paddock.
“No thank you,” Harry said, closing the door in her face.
Without any more delay he placed his wand back in its holster on his right forearm, walked out of his office and headed down the stairs as quietly as his big, black, leather boots would allow him to. He paused briefly on the second floor and looked at the closed door where Harry was meant to be asleep. His eyes caught the slight shimmer of a spell that hid a certain person from view. Shaking his head with a smile, Drew continued to walk down the stairs.
Harry pushed away from the table, tears surfacing in his eyes and he ran out of the portrait hole, running into the wall opposite, leaning over and emptying his stomachs content. A hand appeared on his back as he dried heaved once all of the food he had just eaten was dumped back out onto the floor.
“Yeah, I’m sure you can see it another time,” he tried to play it off kindly. “Are you excited about coming to Hogwarts? It really is a great school. Well, for the most part anyway.”
“Quite badly,” nodded Harry.
“I see both of your points,” slowly said Dumbledore as he thought everything over. “And I think that for the cause, for the Order, for Harry… It will be a good idea to take Harry to see Sirius and start our own investigation.”
Stepping back and placing his knife back into its sheath, Harry took in all of his work as a whole. Satisfaction bubbled below the surface, hoping this was more than enough for the Requester. Keen to go home and shower, Harry hurriedly grabbed the grey metal box that had long been discarded. He spread out the pictures around Steven's head and limp body. Even laying a few beneath the word carved into his chest and one upon the exposed base of his penis, blood quickly soaking the edges. Discarding the box to the side, Harry sighed as he got ready to leave.
As he looked around the orange tinted sky, he thought about how this time tomorrow he would be departing and making his way to the Dursley’s. How this time tomorrow would be the last time he would lay eyes on this very sight for a long time. How in over 24 hours, he would be facing the very scenario he had been dreading ever since he was kicked out of the Dursley’s residence. How he would be getting his long awaited revenge on the family that tried to destroy him. And soon enough he’ll be able to get his revenge on the old fool that had placed him at 4 Privet Drive that faithful night.
“I-I, it didn’t mean to slip out that I knew that during the Order meeting,” he said with shame.
“I have no doubt I will enjoy it,” he said as he sat down. “However I don’t want to intrude, you know?”
The young man smirked as he saw Kevin grab a cigarette from his bag before he headed outside to the back yard. This is his chance to strike. The man made his way into the middle of his yard, where he proceeded to light the cigarette and stare at the moon. Perfect.
A long, slim rope shot out from the palm of his hand and attached itself to the wall of the house. Harry stilled, knowing the rope was now visible to anyone. He looked over to the group and silently sighed in relief as they were all occupied. Not wanting to get caught, Harry gripped the rope with both hands, giving it a tug to ensure it was sturdy. He begun to scale the wall as if he weighed nothing. In the short amount of time it took to get to the window, he was neither out of breath or sweating.
“Headmaster Dumbledore?” Molly’s voice suddenly said, filled with apprehension.
“Should we not test his knowledge beforehand, that way we aren’t wasting precious time?” she asked with a frown, many others nodding in agreement. “Especially if his time could go towards things that will be helpful in duels, rather than the school year ahead.”
Harry ran over to the almost completely transparent person, wand trained on them in case they managed to break free of the cruse. The shimmer of the charm apparent now as he stood directly above the still body. He crouched down and tapped the person on the head gently to disable the Disillusionment charm. Slowly the charm faded and revealed Drew who was lying flat on his stomach with his wand in one hand and a dagger in the other.
Hello everyone! Thank you for all of your kind comments, and expressing a want for a new chapter. Well here we go! Firstly please go back and read the end of the last chapter as I made major changes. Secondly, I do apologise for the delay. I wanted to explain why it took me 3 and a bit months to release it. Not long after Christmas, I had major back surgery. It's a 6 month recovery, so I'm not quite halfway yet. The pain has prevent me from sitting down and writing, I'm slowly rebuilding tolerance for such activity. I really hope you can be patient with me while I recover. But once again, thank you for your comments of encouragement and enthusiasm about this story. Enjoy and please comment!
“Note taken,” Harry nodded, doubting he would ever entice that side out of her.
Malfoy and Harry both took their half full cups over to the table and sat down next to each other. Snape sat down opposite Malfoy and drummed his fingers on the table, waiting for the food to appear.
“My apologise, Harry,” he said through gritted teeth, forcing a tired smile. “It’s been a rather long day, you must forgive this old man.”
Hi guys. I'm not doing well mentally at the moment. I would really appreciate the love for this chapter and story. I love you guys <3
"In private?" Fred followed up.
Harry slowly started waking up from his deep sleep. The sun streaming in through his curtainless window, blinding his vision as he looked around his quite room. Today was his 16
“That was close,” Parker whispered, shaking his head in disbelief.
“Mum!” the young female’s already flushed face became even redder as she hid her face with her long red hair.
"I wonder how he knows how to perform such advanced magic for his age," pondered Fred.
Harry kept every sense he had on high alert, not afraid to stop if there was something that caught his attention. Luck was on his side for now as he successfully made it around the staircase in to the other hallway. First door under the staircase. Harry smirked as he saw that he was standing right next to it. But before he entered it, he decided to check for any nasty hidden surprises. Holding his hand up and closing his eyes, he found nothing in place. How odd.
“I’m okay. Should we call a House elf? I’m hungry.” Draco mumbled, changing the subject and waiting for Harry to catch on.
“Are you going to be good?” Harry whispered harshly, pushing his cock past Draco’s lips, watching as his eyes watered, the further he pushed in. Draco nodded slowly, moaning around Harry as he hit his prostate with the toy he had gripped in his hand between his legs. His hips were bucking involuntarily, tears slipping from his eyes as Harry fucked his throat, slowly, but steadily. Harry pulled back a little as he felt Draco’s throat contract, realising he hadn’t moved for a moment and was causing Draco to gag as he looked over his shoulder to see Draco’s progress with the dildo.
“H-Harry, I wanted to he-help you-
” Draco moaned, his voice wrecked and broken as Harry pressed the dildo in, inch by inch. Without realising, Draco was reaching down, grabbing at the dildo to press it in further, knowing his limits for once. Harry smirked above him, pulling himself up onto the table to straddle Draco’s face, pressing his cock to Draco’s lips.
.” He was babbling to himself, spitting into the toilet and retching again. Harry was behind him, kneeling behind him and massaging his back, scenting him under his breath.
“Let me do it.” He spoke low, running his fingers over Draco’s entrance and watching his reaction with interest. Harry pressed the vibrator against his rim, carefully parting his thighs to slowly edge further into him. Draco groaned out, arms shaking under his weight.
happy for you, Draco.” He smiled softly, leaning down to brush his lips against Draco’s head, but Draco was still unsure, “I just,” He paused again and something in the pit of Draco’s stomach turned, “I’m just worried, okay?” It wasn’t something he’d planned on admitting, but Draco was going to figure him out at some point anyway. He always did.
“Good boy.” Harry said shortly, gesturing for Draco to begin his slow torture. And Draco did, slowly licking around the crown of his cock as if it wasn’t something so filthily sinful. He was quick to clutch at Harry’s thighs, taking as much of him as he could manage and then going further. Harry threw his head back and groaned out, long and low, reaching down to clutch at Draco’s hair and up the setting on the vibrator.
” Draco cried, pulling away from Harry as he dropped his head, trying to compose himself once again. Harry barely held back a smirk as Draco continued teasing Harry’s cock. He was never one to bring Harry to release fast, but that was the way the both of them were. It was stubborn and stupid, but they never questioned it, they teased and scratched and bit until one of them gave in and right now Draco was frantic. He had a vibrator on the third highest setting up his ass and his mind was a complete fog, but he didn’t want to be the one giving in this time. The room seemed to be spinning and Draco wasn’t once complaining at the consistent thrusts of Harry’s hips into his mouth. Draco was good like that. He took more than he could handle and then some more, Harry knew that all too well.
“Can you do three fingers already?” Harry questioned, knowing full-well that Draco could, watching as his rim fluttered, muscle tensing and relaxing in desperation. Draco hummed and Harry was quick to place three fingers at his entrance, noticing how the Omega had pushed up on his tiptoes to part his legs for Harry, it was mesmerising. Draco shivered as Harry ran his fingers over the muscle, collecting slick on his fingers and pushing into him at an agonisingly slow rate, it was nowhere near enough and all too soon, he was desperate for more.
“That was naughty. Are you really that desperate?” Harry murmured into his Omega’s ear, watching as Draco balanced himself on his bound fists, ass pushed at an uncomfortable angle against the edge of the desk. The blond flash of hair caught Harry’s attention as he nodded reverently. Draco didn’t dare look around when he heard the sound of a belt buckle, feeling the loosened grip on his leash he was sure this meant Harry had given in, but nothing came after that. He could feel Harry staring, but not doing anything and he was becoming irritated. He’d gone into Heat first, he shouldn’t be waiting, he should be getting fucked senseless and keening under Harry’s touch, not his gaze.
, please!” Draco managed pathetically, pulling his bottom lip between his teeth as Harry pressed deeper, suddenly pulling out with a smirk and licking his slick-covered hand.
On the third day, Draco crawled out of the study, leaving Harry asleep, sure that he wouldn’t have much time until he awoke again. His mouth was desperately dry and he was sure he looked worse than Harry did after the Triwizard Tournament. He could barely walk, after being fucked four consecutive times and not moving more than 2 feet in the past 72 hours. Casting cleaning charms over the room before he left, he covered himself in a sheet and made his way towards the kitchens. It was strangely quiet without Teddy in the Manor and he had a sudden pang of guilt, for how it would be for the rest of Teddy’s life. He’d be handed to friends every week of every month and come back to live with Draco and Harry inbetween. He wondered if it was really okay for a child to grow up like that, but brushed the thought away, for at least Teddy had people he knew loved him. When he finally found the strength, he pulled himself to his feet, stretching out his limbs and shaking away pins-and-needles. He found himself in the Manor’s entrance hall not too far from the kitchens and he was sure the House Elves would find him something to eat and drink, but the cold hallway suddenly felt as if it had another person’s presence and Draco spun around, clutching the sheet around his shoulders to find Harry in the corridor to the West Wing. For a split moment Draco was scared and he hated having to admit that, but Harry must’ve been able to sense it through the bond.
“Well? What about them?” Draco asked, a little too coldly. He knew he was being blunt with Harry and he would likely acknowledge and regret it later, but this wasn’t something he wanted to talk about.
“Well, you were good for me, Draco.” Harry responded shortly, trying to hide the sudden shift in his personality. The room fell silent for a moment as the Heat subsided and Harry realised he hadn’t even cum. This was another sign that his Rut hadn’t fully started, but he knew it wouldn’t be long to wait.
“You want me to fuck you? After leaving me, you think I’ll let you down easy?” He paused, leaning back on his knees and lightly sliding his hands down Draco’s legs, “Baby, I really thought you knew me.” Draco hissed in a breath and his head began to spin as he watched Harry summon an umbrella from the coat rack, transfiguring it into a black toy. Draco was sure he was going to pass out.
“Don’t be absurd, Harry, do you really think Hollywood is solely made up of Muggles?
“Hey,” Draco whispered quietly, noticing the pain in his lower back had subsided a great deal since the previous day. He looked up at Harry with wide eyes and Harry’s eyes flickered down to him, snapping the laptop closed and shoving it down the bed as he looked at Draco with a soft smile.
“Everything looks fine, your vitals are good- though, your strength is lacking a little, but that’s expected of your first full day in training. Does anywhere else hurt?” Harry mumbled, eyes flicking between the readings before brushing them away and placing his wand aside.
“It-it’s better than what I wanted.” Draco stuttered out, pupils blown wide and full of lust. Harry was very good at buying useless time, but scrutinising and watching from afar seemed to be in the top ten of his talents.
“My darling, did you already forget the question?” Harry hummed, cocking his head and taking several steps closer, watching Draco’s eyes light up, “I asked how that filthy fantasy of me fucking you in this room would pan out. So tell me, Draco, in your little fantasy, how did we end up here?” Harry had reached out his index finger, pushing the blond locks back from Draco’s face to expose the flush high on his cheekbones. He delighted in the way his Omega whimpered at the mere proximity.
“Ready, baby? Are you going to impress me?” Harry growled, pressing the toy to his hole, watching as Draco nodded frantically, helplessly.
“If you’re arguing, you won’t be cumming at all, Little Omega.” Harry said, pulling back to grip at the leash harshly. Draco’s stomach bottomed out as he clenched his jaw to stop from snapping back at Harry, distracted with the way the collar was digging into his windpipe, cutting off his air supply by a little.
leave me, Omega.” Harry growled out and if Draco wasn’t already hard he definitely was by now. He scrambled against the polished wood, trying to grasp onto anything that might help keep him grounded, because suddenly Harry’s tongue was sucking the slick from him at a pace that he was pretty sure was inhuman.
unrelenting. He pushed back, moaning out as he felt Harry’s breath fan over his skin.
- please just, f-fuck me.” Draco already sounded wrecked and as Harry continued his ministrations, Draco contemplated as to whether he’d just heard Harry scoff at him. He whimpered at the loss of contact, legs splayed further apart than he was even aware of.
“The letters?” Draco replied in confusion, chewing on his toast and silently summoning the spoon Teddy had thrown across the table.
“Wh-what do you want me to do? I’ll do anything, Alpha.” Draco whined and the conscious part of his mind was applauding him because he knew that two could play at this game and if that meant calling Harry the name that made his knees weak, that is exactly what he’d do to win.
“Are you ready, baby?” Harry asked, dragging his index finger along Draco’s spine and staring hungrily at his clenching entrance. Draco nodded, a muffled moan falling from his lips as he wriggled beneath Harry’s body,
“I-I didn’t know I was crying.” Draco whispered, letting himself be wrapped up in Harry’s embrace, tracing his hand across Harry’s chest. Harry let out a huffed breath of laughter, but it was in good spirits and Draco didn’t mind.
“Hey, baby. How are you feeling?” Harry asked, leaning down to press his lips to Draco’s forehead, scrutinising him after pushing his glasses back up his nose.
“Yes, well, I’ll be dealing with potions, not magical creatures.” Draco said shortly, voice etching on cold and almost retracting the hand on Harry’s chest, before he grabbed it back, interlocking their fingers, “Besides, we both know I am one hell of an actor and in that moment Hollywood would have begged for me.”
“Harry,
“It’s just that I don’t want anything to happen to you. I don’t want you to get hurt or for people to say things and I don’t want you to feel uncomfortable and,
“I-I just want
“Oh my god, Harry it was amazing! They even gave me things to research at home if I wanted. Hermione showed me around the wards where the patients are treated with the potions that I get to make! It’s incredible, Harry!” Draco was on the verge of squealing and Harry had ended up giggling at him from the couch as they took their dinner plates from the House elf that’d appeared beside them.
“You want me to fuck you here?” Harry raised an eyebrow, the confidence from his Alpha suddenly coming in waves, “And how does that fantasy pan out?” He was teasing, but it was completely worth it to see the way Draco’s body reacted. The way his lean figure tensed and shivered at the growl of Harry’s voice, or maybe it was the devilish way Harry was looking at him.
“Draco? Baby?” Harry’s voice cut through the sound that was bouncing around the room, only then did Draco realise that he had in fact been sobbing, “Baby, I’m here, it’s okay, I’m here.” Harry said softly, casting a drying spell over himself and pulling his boxers on to climb in bed beside Draco.
“Do you want to see a doctor? I can call you one if you want?” Harry asked, knowing Draco would probably decline the offer, but at least giving him the option. Draco shifted uncomfortably, dragging his hand over Harry’s chest and thumbing at his sternum.
“Oh god, Draco, that’s not it at all! I can manage Teddy, it’s just-” Harry cut in, only to fall short of what to say.
“How about this?” Harry questioned, horribly slowly, as he held up the ivy green, leather collar. It was the darkest green Harry could manage and Draco was sure he’d chosen the colour on purpose. He nodded at Harry eagerly, reaching out his hands only for Harry to flutter his fingers, a translucent thread tying both wrists together.
.” Draco was crude, he knew it and so did Harry, but he’d never expected himself to admit these things. Harry trailed his index finger down his back, along the curve of his ass and pressing firmly against his pulsing heat. Draco writhed against the desk, groaning out at the contact and pushing back with need, but Harry wasn’t complying just yet.
“Okay, what now?” Draco pressed, watching as Harry leant against his desk, studying everything but Draco’s expression.
“Ah, I’m proud of your Muggle knowledge, Draco.” Harry smirked, running his thumb along Draco’s knuckles and chuckling quietly.
“I c-can’t, Harry, I-I need
.” Draco begged, tears streaking his face, bouncing on his knees, Harry beneath him and trying his hardest to control himself, but Draco had said it was okay and that’s all Harry’s Alpha had wanted to hear. He pushed Draco back down against the table, pounding back into him and revelling in the feeling his knot felt against Draco’s tight rim. A few more thrusts and Harry was cumming inside Draco, reaching between them to pump at Draco’s cock, riding them both through their orgasms as Harry’s knot swelled within him. Harry watched as Draco collapsed beneath him, body jolting as he came over his stomach. Harry was guiding his hips, holding them against his own as they collapsed against the surface. They’d barely recovered from their highs and Draco was barely conscious, but Harry knew that this would be the end of their Heat. Draco was sated and Harry was satisfied.
“Sounds good. Do you want any help with the application?” Harry said warmly and Draco was a little confused as to why he wasn’t pushing so much anymore. It was beginning to scare him a little.
The raven glanced at the rug laying on the floor beside his little fort under the bed.
The boy didn’t reply and the two disappeared from the doorway.
“See? It’s ugly.” Severus looked at him with such sorrow and Tom’s arms squeezed tighter against his waist. But both were overshadowed by Draco finally butting in and stomping over. Grabbing his mate’s face and slamming his lips over the other’s forcefully until he yielded, melting against his long time boyfriend’s grasp. Draco pulling back with a sharp gasp.
He’d had that exact dream. The dark hair, the wide dark blue eyes. He even knew exactly what stuffed dragon his husband was talking about. It’d been a red dragon because that was the mascot of his mother’s muggle university. He’d had the plushie for years. Severus knew it was in the Prince vault, as it had for many years, but Tom had never seen it to Severus’ memory. He’d wanted to save it, for a child, for a son.
A cold feeling was beginning to gnaw at him.
“I know, I know, desert lad. But, in the highlands of Dicia in the mountains, there is deep cold and snow. My mentor taught me how to ice skate there and I fell in love. I also burn like a white boy in the desert sun, so this is better yeah?” Severus spared the teenager a smile, examining the area, before looking under the ice itself. The area was oddly blank, normally teenaged minds were complex with memories and emotions. Severus could see the chunks of life that were missing, but the ice is what scared him.
“Yes, that should be fine. He can speak with Hadrian’s therapist Nina too if he wants a better overview of his history.” Lucius jotted some notes down with his quill.
“Piers and Esmerelda it is when you two are together and not in the common room. I will not be made a fool calling a shared name. It would do well to answer to those names if it is amenable to you?” Hadrian glanced to his ‘sister’ and she seemed to look him up and down. Sizing him up, it was oddly amusing to see a child act so tough.
“Is this seat open? Or should I leave?” He was confident, but who wouldn’t be with the two bulky shadows who stood guard behind him like bulldogs. Laney grinned and waved him in, definitely Mama’s daughter as she welcomed them with open arms, letting go of Harry’s hand to help them settle in.
Snape hid his slight surprise when the Potter spawn replied with a bland voice. “Many, and I believe Mama and Mother will beat you to it. Mother has been fed up with them since my adoption.” His godson hopped in the conversation. Snape eyed the way the blonde’s hands curled around the long-haired boy’s bicep. It wasn’t the worst Potter twin it seemed, but Snape was still displeased. Though, this wasn’t the conversation he’d been expecting, or where he was expecting to have it. Draco growled his input.
. Literally anywhere else but here is
“First, let’s dissuade you of this notion that you will ever leave here. As Head of the Potter house you will
“As I stated earlier, they only requested your brother’s attendance, however as you are family and I his head of house. I deemed it prudent to drag all of us up here. I fear the havoc you and Draco could wreak if Hadrian nor I were there to witness and fix it.” Snape sighed despondently to which Laney giggled brightly. Hadrian blinked as Snape caught his eyes, but quirked his lips up into the best half smile he could. As their professor gently grabbed both their shoulders Hadrian knew he understood.
His Papa choked as Hadrian skipped out of the room and tackled his beloved in his arms. Nagini hissing delightedly and the Malfoy’s snickering quietly at his parents.
That event had some other consequences as well. Laney was perfect one because of her lack of fucks to give and two,
Dumbledore’s eyebrow crooked, “Suni?”
“Boo-hoo.” A ghost of a smile fluttered on his lips when she tugged his ponytail with a swift tug in irritation at his bland attention. It was at least his full attention.
“I’m from Britain and I’m probably English by blood. But my home culture is from a small desert island named Dicai. Blistering sun and spice is our life, though I grew up here and only have been to the homeland a few times, my mentor made sure I was taught all our traditions and immersed in the culture from the second she took me in.” Hadrian paused. “You don’t have to hide your wands or magic by the way. I know and I am.”
All his life he'd known nothing but to bend and break his own spine for the sake of others. Now forced into a marriage he never wanted, with a man who hated him beyond belief. Harry could really only see one way out, and that was throwing himself at his enemies feet and letting Death soothe away the humiliation and the pain.
This is rated Explicit.
I don’t think my apologies were either unnecessary or enough but you’re very kind to say so.
Draco adds another finger when Harry starts to relax around him.
The sun is rising at the horizon when Malfoy barrels into the room they’re in.
Pleeeeease?
And now, look at you!
I'm not sending this, this is stupid.

"Open my trousers."

Thank you!

was a wand though.” Harry is a little annoyed at Draco for mocking him.
"No, no, it's me. I just don't - I thought you liked me cherishing you, caressing you. Now you're saying… What are you saying exactly? You want me to force myself on you?"
You were probably right though. James’s been crying all day, the house is a mess
It takes one second for Harry to freak out, asking over and over what he did wrong, if Draco's okay and then apologising profusely.
The weird thing is, Harry knew. He knew that Draco had reached out to Andromeda a few years back, and that he was in Teddy’s life. Harry never imagined it though. It feels like two different worlds are colliding in front of his eyes and where he thought would be a disaster, there’s only…home? A warm and all compassing feeling of being where and with whom he belongs.
The day of the rendez-vous, Harry makes sure his hair is tamed-ish and his suit pressed. From what he saw of the restaurant, this is more of a place to take a date, rather than a friend. He doesn’t want to assume that’s what Draco’s going for, however much he might want it to be a date, but just in case.
Draco softly conjures lube and lowers his right hand to Harry’s cock again. Draco strokes Harry a few times, then fondles his balls and moves past to circle his rim. Harry inhales sharply at the wet sensation. He’s so gone already. Draco continues to massage his hole before diving one finger in.
.” Then, in English. “I can’t eat this by myself, you should stay. You’ve earned it.”
“How else would I mean it?”
Draco,
When they finish the last of the preparation, Harry nervously starts getting ready to leave. Draco looks at him confused.
"Sorry, I just thought I'd - Sorry. I'll buy you a new one." Then he flees the room, face red from embarrassment.

Hint of homophobia.

Harry
. He just wants to have Draco back.
Also, because this is a private reading of my vows, let me tell you that the sex is out of this world. I’m serious! I never knew it could be like this.
“It’s crazy”, Draco finally says, “them being parents soon. We’re barely adults ourselves.”
It scares me sometimes. I don't know anything about growing up with magic. I don't have a clue how to help him. I still don't even have full control of my own magic sometimes. Like yesterday, James was wailing - he can be quite distressed when he's hungry
I'm sorry I missed James's big achievement, I hope he forgives me.
” Harry says without thinking about it, so used to answering Draco in French. Teddy’s eyes go wide and he exclaims : “You speak French too Uncle Harry? Like Uncle Draco?”
“Err, I’m not sure - I mean - I guess I’d like that - shouldn’t we… “
) and grilling (
"Stupid prat. It was amazing, love. Everything I wanted and more. Thank you."
"Oh. I'll take us upstairs then."
” Draco explains, mouth, lips.
“You’re it for me, and if you say yes, I’d like nothing more than for you to be my husband.”
“Harry?”
Later, when Andromeda has come to get Teddy, they find themselves lounging on the sofa with a cup of tea. They’ve been sharing multiple kisses since their dinner a few days ago. Harry desperately wants to do more than kiss Draco, perhaps tonight… Just as the thought crosses his mind, Draco gets up and cleans up his cup.
"Shhhh it's okay, I love you."
Harry Potter
Three hours later, Sam’s hand starts cramping. Marcus has been asked to leave after a few too many snide remarks. Deputy Head Auror Weasley has relaxed around hour two. Something’s off though. Sam thought at first that Weasley didn’t like Malfoy because of his Death Eater past, but the way the Auror kept looking between Malfoy - with contempt - and Potter - with worry - makes Sam wonder if there’s something he’s missing. There’s also the fact that his notes barely make sense. Potter and Malfoy communicate with half formed questions and barely there answers. They seem to be able to read each other so well they mostly don’t need words. Sam is beyond puzzled. He has three pages of notes on Malfoy’s silences and body language. Hopefully that’s what the Head Auror needs.
”, he whispers.
Thank you for including me in your life Harry. I’m sorry that I was unable to get Lucius to see reason.
, gods fuck me already.”
Malfoy,
The department is buzzing for the next three days. People are stopping in the middle of the corridors to whisper about the Malfoy case. A lot of false information circulates. Sam knows because he was the one to fill out the report on the initial intervention. Head Auror Potter had come to his cubicle and asked Sam personally to handle it. Sam had blushed and stammered like a fool.
Once in the study, Harry can see the extent of Malfoy’s preparation. The walls are covered in pictures of all sorts of magical objects. Harry looks around, awed at the amount of effort it must have taken Malfoy to do all this in barely twenty-four hours.
Your letter was such a pleasant surprise. Of course, the answer is yes. How could I not give you my blessing? I have never seen Draco as happy as he is with you and young James. I would want nothing more than for you to officially join our family.
I’m looking forward to receiving you three in the new house.
Dear Narcissa,
“Yes, but you could have refused.”
“Please tell me this is not about this old crook.”, Harry pleads.
I'm sorry I kissed you, I thought… You said I knew how you felt, apparently I was mistaken.
“Yes, keep going, slow and steady. Breath through it.”
It was amazing! Remember how the book said most children start with 'mom'? Do you think he should see Ginny more? Am I depriving him of something? I love him so much, Draco.
Best of luck.
It's the endearment that does it. Harry turns Draco around and pushes him face first on the bed. He runs his tongue all the way from Draco's neck to the dimple above his left cheek. Draco's trembling underneath him, making Harry's cock leak against his stomach. Without further teasing, he mouths at Draco's balls, taking one in his mouth then the other. He moves up a little and finally licks around Draco's tight hole. Draco moans and desperate whimpers fill the room, Harry revels in them. He could come just from the sound of Draco's pleasure, he's so high on it.
D. L. Malfoy
"I'm okay. It's fine. It was just a bit much, we'll get it right eventually, okay?"
“Five, my place?”
The man in question comes out of the kitchen with a tray full of tea and biscuits.
Harry takes a deep breath and tries to regain control of the situation. He grabs Teddy and sits him down on the couch.
Harry Potter
I enjoy my work very much, I love my flat
“Yeah?”
Harry barely has time to escape Draco throwing a pillow at him.
to be thorough.”
I love you.
Again, Draco laughs, except this time Harry laughs with him.
he kisses your picture. Is there really no way for you to join us? Even a little bit? I promise Ginny's fine with it. I'd like you to meet her properly.
I'm sorry, please come back home. I didn't mean to imply that your father…
Draco laughs. "I came twice and blacked out Harry, what does that tell you?"
"Yes. I'd anything for you Draco, you know that."
“Yes, yes.” Harry answers distractedly. “But if they don’t have Hogwarts, they don’t have the same houses. So, why wouldn’t they just use the proper name?”
Thank you again for the charms.
Malfoy pauses then, his face so closed off that Harry can’t read him at all. Then, like he made a decision Harry didn’t know needed making, “No, I didn’t.”
Who would have thought when we first met all these years ago, that we would be here today? I certainly didn’t. Even when my heart - and my body - were telling me that maybe there was something there, my life has always felt too temporary to even think about that sort of thing.
He did it!!! Jamie called me DADA! Can you believe it? He just looked at me and said it.
It's a while before either of them can talk. Somehow, someone cast a cleaning spell and they moved so that Draco's head is on Harry's chest. They lazily trace random patterns onto each other's skin, just enjoying their found again intimacy.
"Come on Draco, don't I deserve to come on your pretty little face? Open your throat for my big fat prick. You want it don't you?"
. He loves the music box you got for him. He made me rewind it all morning to see the little dragons flying around. I've taken a thousand pictures so you'll see it for yourself.
His excitement makes Harry smile.
“Mmmm”, she starts, “I see a great love between the two of you.” Harry chuckles. That’s hardly a revelation, anyone who’s seen them today can tell how in love they both are.
I hope you agree.
"Do you believe me?"
To teach you to play
family, no?
Draco feels his cheeks heat.
"Fuck, Harry! These are my favourites. Were, I guess. And you know I can't
“No, young man", the old lady scolds, "I'm not talking about the past. I’m talking about the future. Dark days are coming. Ones that won’t require your bodies to fight, but your hearts.”
"I did? When?"
They share dessert in a near silence that could have been uncomfortable but is not. Draco shamelessly licks the
"Fuck, the way you sound…". Harry sounds almost pained.
? Sam thinks. That’s new. Or maybe it’s not actually. He’s in the interrogation room before he can form an hypothesis on what’s going on between Malfoy and Potter.
The day of their ninth lesson, Harry receives an owl from Andromeda. She’s needed at some event, and asks Harry to take care of Teddy. Harry always jumps at the opportunity to spend time with his godson, but today he’s a little reluctant. It’s not that he doesn’t want to, it’s just that he really wants to see Draco. Their schedule has prevented them from having a lesson in more than five days now and Harry’s just missed him, as crazy as that sounds.
"Okay."
I sometimes wonder what sixteen-year-old me would think about me calling you that.
They stay silent long after leaving the booth, strolling through the park aimlessly.
Draco
Draco,
They break apart slowly, foreheads resting against each other’s.
“It’s not, not really. It was just a lot of things mixed up together. The way you talked about Ron and Hermione, and that speech. Fuck, that speech Harry. Do you have any idea? It was beautiful and really intense, but most of all it scared the crap out of me. How could I compete? These ghosts you compared me to! Your parents, Harry, your godfather! I was going to screw it up. And even if I didn’t, was I really what you wanted? Were you just holding on to me because you so desperately wanted what your friends had? And that old lady with her tales of pain and suffering… I panicked. I wanted to say yes, of course I wanted to. I guess I got scared you didn’t want it as much as I did.”
Harry's on a loop, alternating begging for forgiveness and cursing himself for being such a jerk.
It so happens that I didn’t know about Ginevra. It must be hard for you to be away from her, what with
The stag starts galloping away, leading them to where Potter and Malfoy are. They arrive in a blur of hexes and shouts. Scorpius is kneeling in the dirt, protected by a strong shield charm. Potter and Malfoy are trying to capture the two remaining vigilantes. Weasley jumps in easily whereas Sam lingers on the sideline. He’s never been part of an actual fight before. He tries to remember what he learnt in training but his mind is blank. He’s starting to panic a little when Potter’s voice booms next to him.
Today they are having an outing, as Draco put it, so Harry really hopes he can control his damn hormones.
I know we planned for an exchange of vows tomorrow, but you know I don’t do too well with words in public. So in case I mess it all up during the ceremony, I wanted you to have this.
"I don't understand," Harry says.
"What are you doing?"
Maybe it's not too late to backtrack, forget about all this.
“Fuck!”
He kisses Harry on the spot, nibbling at his lower lip and grasping his hips tightly.
Soon after that, Draco finds himself pressed into the couch once again. Harry's demeanour is changing slowly into a commanding self-assured man. He looks taller somehow and it makes Draco whimper. He goes to put his hands in Harry's hair, when a rush of magic pins both his arms above his head.
He can’t really remember when he first realized Draco was hot, probably fifth year, not that he would admit that to anyone. Back then, it was just part of the list of facts he knew about Draco
When they start the third interrogation, the objective is crystal clear. They need a location. Every hour that passes increases the risk of Scorpius being dead. The group has been apprehended, the teenager is probably left alone somewhere without wand, protection and food.
Headmistress McGonagall and I have a partnership, she reaches out to parents of new wizards and for those expressing the desire to, she refers them to me to help their children navigate through discovering magic. We’ve managed to dramatically lower the number of accidents due to accidental magic amongst Muggle-borns.
I saw my parents the day we were to have dinner. I'm not sure why but I told them about
"Okay." Harry finally says.
"Do you think I'm weird? Fuck, I'm a pervert, aren't I?"
Sincerely,
“Fuck.” Potter mutters. He takes a deep breath and turns to Sam.
I love you,
“When will I see you again?” If that sounds like the end of a date, well, Harry can always dream.
“Okay, Ron and Conley, you’re going this way as per the plan. Draco and I will take the other side. Send a patronus if you need help or find something. Be careful.”
For the first time of his life though, he doesn’t fill the silence with snark, insults or obscure historic facts he’s the only one to know hoping it’ll make him sound smart.
Harry
. In any case, James, loved as he is, was very much unplanned. Ginny was wary at first, because of her career, so we decided I would raise him. He gets to see his mother of course, she takes him when she’s around. It was hard the first couple of weeks after she left, he definitely missed her. I think we’ve got a good rhythm going on now. I won’t be returning to the Ministry in the near future.
“Yes you did, you said ‘fuck’!”
Draco,
“Well, yes, it is too.”
Honestly, I didn’t know a tiny human being could produce that much nasty stuff, did you? The puking is awful - and yes, I’ve had a healer confirm it was nothing serious before you threaten to report me again - but the worst is the diapers ! The whole house seems to stink of it.
"Oh, Merlin" he can barely talk between laughs "Did you think -" he cuts off still laughing. Harry's this close to hex him. "Did you think
He then turns to the fireplace.

Harry, my love,
“Maybe she’s a Seer,” Draco shrugs, amused.
“Yeah okay,” he says more to himself than anything else, “yeah, Harry wouldn’t let anything happen to him.”
Harry
, he thinks. Then, he says “It’s nice though, right? They’re building a family together. They were already, what with being married and all, but now it seems more real.”
Harry opens one eye carefully and looks at the pictures. He flushes bright red when realisation dawns on him.
Draco!
Harry frowns. Draco inhales sharply next to him.
Love,
recipe, no?”
"Sorry, sorry. Anyway, before that moment, it was so hot. Having you on top of me, surrounding me and pressing me into the couch. It was everything I have ever imagined. It's alright not to get it right the first time. Like everything else, we'll figure it out. Did you enjoy it?"
Sam drops the files on the nearest surface and flees the office. He’s almost out the door, when Potter addresses him again, a warm smile on his face.
Harry worriedly asks "Aren't you going to come up?'
” and
Until one day, the Head Auror comes barging in the bullpen, robes barely fastened, face showing his lack of sleep.
Please tell me we can still be friends, I need you. Jamie too.
“Talk? In French?”
Draco can see the moment understanding dawns on Harry. He wants Harry to mark him, he wants to be able to press against the bruises in the morning and remember how tight Harry was holding him, how wanted he'd been.
“It’s okay. He’s with the Head Auror and the Deputy Head Auror, they’ll protect him.”
“You could have told me though. You just said no, and my heart stopped. Like I’d been imagining everything from the start. Like I’d been the only one to dream about a bigger house, a couple of babies, about growing old with you.”
Harry looks at him pointedly, an eyebrow raised.
Harry
I thought I wanted to be your friend when I was eleven, I thought I wanted to be your enemy when I was sixteen, now I know I just wanted you to be part of my life.
me to manhandle you?"
They all take their seat and Head Auror Potter casts a few protective spells around them. Sam frowns, Malfoy is a witness, right?
I took the liberty to add two books with this letter. The first one is the one I always recommend to parents with magical children. I believe you will find it useful for handling accidental magic and all that. The second,
They walk quietly to the Apparition point, a bizarre sort of reenactment of their walk after the shopping spree. Harry wants to grab Draco’s hand but he doesn’t dare. It’s not that he doubts Draco’s attraction to him, it’s just that, it’s Draco. Harry wants this more than he’s ever wanted anything in the last few years.
It’s been thirty minutes and Harry already wants to leave. Ron is looking at him like Harry’s going to burst in tears any minute, Hermione keeps patting his shoulder in obvious pity and Luna is just being
“He seems to be having a really hard time, and I figured, if you’re both miserable then maybe, you could find a way to make things right?”
"Well, I didn't want to risk splinching myself. The wards?" He adds, confusion clear on Harry's face.
Yours always,
"You want me to dominate you," Harry whispers, as if realizing for the first time since the beginning of this conversation what they're talking about.
Prompt : Suburbia
You’re so fucking tight. I’m close.” Draco’s now babbling in a mix of English and French but it doesn’t matter to Harry. They’re both delirious with pleasure and with the last of his clarity Harry wonders why they’ve waited so long to do this.
A month passes on and Harry hasn't tried again. Draco wants to mention it but isn't too sure what to say. It's a rare occasion for him not to broach something that's bothering him. The first time they discussed it, Harry struggled so much with the idea, immediately jumping to the conclusion that Draco wasn't happy, that he's a little wary to mention it again. Whenever they have sex, Harry's watching him intently. It's not unusual per se, Harry has always been an attentive lover, except now he's looking for clues, signs of boredom or frustration. It makes Draco's stomach churn to imagine what's running through Harry's mind. Has he convinced himself that Draco's faking his pleasure? That while they're together, Draco's fantasizing about strangers roughing him up?
It took ten minutes for them to get ready and another ten to drag Laney out from her dorms. (Another five to get her to stop mooning at his bare arms and making suggestive comments. Draco pointedly tried not to stare at what were some nice biceps for a preteen). They made it to breakfast on time however and sat next to Crabbe and Goyle on the end. Marissa was on Laney’s lap mewing up a storm and demanding bacon from his sister’s plate. Hadrian hid a smirk. Simply eating and relaxing until the post came swooping down. Draco got his customary letter from his parents and Laney grinned as a letter from one of the postal owls dropped into his hands.
The house was quite ever since their son went to school, she hummed and gently stirred the stew that would serve to be their dinner. She still hadn’t adjusted the recipe to feed less mouths, so there would be a lot of leftovers. Though, if the number of mouths to feed would soon go up again. She hoped.
Severus paused, as far as he knew when the younger Potter went missing he had never gone to another family. Albus had said he was sent to live with a branch of relatives in the muggle world for better education and a better safer life. Seeing as the Dragma’s adoption began processing a couple weeks after Hadrian went missing from his aunt and uncle’s home; there was little chance he’d went to a bad foster home before the Dragma’s got hold of him.
Snape felt any lingering doubts of Hadrian being his father’s son fade away from the back of his mind. He more had to worry about the adoptive twins being like their mothers than his tormentor.
The circle folded itself to create a small path that Hadrian stumbled out of. The wards were buzzing curiously at him, still recognizing him as well as not really remembering the taste of his individual magic without the family blood. They poked and prodded at him. But as he’d been here so long and still tasted of Lady Magic’s influence, they ultimately left him alone. The raven grinned, bloody and victorious.
The platinum blond looked so bewildered it made Hadrian tear into loud giggles, a hand clasped over his mouth to be as quiet as possible. Obviously understanding that he wasn’t getting it, Draco blushed a bright red all the way to his ears as Hadrian and Laney laughed hysterically, tears glittering in the brunet’s eyes when he finally calmed down and placed a hand on Draco’s shoulder. The touch felt searing in the best of ways when he got a crooked grin.
“We have to.” James mouth was set, and Lily didn’t try to change his mind.
” Laney replied with a croak, voice hoarse and cracking.
Alexander Potter.
“I know. I know. Lily was insistent to make him feel at home. That meant giving him free reign and hoping for the best. All he did was lock himself in his room and never come out until everyone was asleep. Surprised the little snake didn’t slit out throats in our sleep. He hurt Alex! And used his own blood for the disownment ritual.”
Summer wasn’t over just yet.
Laney snorted. “Doesn’t every house have something they liked to keep behind the doors?”
“Because Alexander and Potter are right di-“ Hadrian elbowed his sister swiftly in the ribs, making her wheeze. “very annoying people I meant. I’m assuming something happened with the Potters and our parents?”
She’d sat there with Annabee wailing, unresponsive to anything until her mother was frantically shaking her. She’d remained in the fog as her family panicked and rushed them back to the Manor and firmly stayed lost.
Like a well performed play, it was absolutely stunning to watch in practice.
“Lily. Take Alex and go finish up lunch. We’ll be down in a minute.”
Draco and Hadrian glanced at each other and hid a smile.
James had been indifferent, more focused on Alex. Alex had been distraught and angry that his brother had disappeared when they had promised he’d get to see him. Lily had been equally distressed. Searching all over Wizarding Britain and finding nothing. Until her baby showed up to the sorting. With a sister according to Albus.
“Welcome to the family, Hadrian. I’m glad my son found his one so easily.” Draco swept Hadrian’s long hair off his shoulder absentmindedly when Hadrian sat back down. Which Nagini seemed to take as an invitation to slither up onto Hadrian’s shoulders. His Lord stiffened, hissing.
Hadrian doodled a tiny bumblebee with a snake at the bottom underneath his name and folded it up to seal it with a wax stamp. Looking up to where Laney was folding up her own reply to their parents, he raised a brow and his sister grinned.
“Promise not to tell or make fun of me? Also, I apologize in advance Mom, I was really hoping to introduce you in much better circumstances.” The dark lord looked quizzingly at him as did his mother as he pulled out a small black flip phone from his bag and dialed the first contact. Ignoring the way his father stared at the odd muggle object in his son’s hand. He picked up on the third ring.
-Watch James get arrested by coworkers
Staying here was intolerable. He’d die before that happened.
Draco was more than pleased to escort his mate through the alley. His hand on Draco’s arm as they looked at all the sweet shops, the quidditch store, that stupid joke shop run by the Weasels that unfortunately Hadrian seemed to adore. Draco’s favorite was the apothecary, listening to his Uncle and his boyfriend bicker about the proper way to brew (potions for his uncle and elixirs for his boyfriend, the same thing really, but Hadrian insisted a few elixirs differed from potions) before they bound together to spout theories on how to improve each other’s concoctions. Their lord seemed pleased to visit the book store, where Narcissa, him, and Draco were arguing on the legality of Dark Arts textbooks versus Defense Against the Dark Arts.
Padfoot had been distraught when Harry had gone missing, he’d only visited a few times compared to his near daily visits with Uncle Moony when Harry had been there. Dad had said he was just working through his emotions, throwing himself into the Order. Now, Uncle Sirius didn’t have to grieve anymore! Harry was right there and now once he penned Mom and Dad, they could bring him back home.
And it was all her fault.
“But Harry, we named you after-“ Laney interrupted as her brother’s hand nearly broke her fingers.
“Or what?” Hadrian smirked back.
-As a Potter, Potter wards hold little effect
“She is an attention whore. She adores wrapping around Anna because she knows that Hadrian will absolutely spoil them together. A snuggle slut as I like to call it.”
outing with his closest confidants and his husband had the man trudging out. Cracking his first smile when Hadrian decided to mimic his glamour with rich blond hair and bright brown eyes and mockingly sulk around the man. Draco and his mother was nearly in stitches, almost falling over when they apparated into Diagon Alley.
“Your Metamorphagus traits will have stopped most physical changes, but you might notice a slight difference in your bone structure, eye color, and or skin tone. Maybe even hair color. This is to both clear any lasting compulsions, and possibly some of the memory charms and potions, and void out the blood adoption so that we can keep custody of you, should Wizarding Britain not recognize your foreign magical guardian. The last thing either of us want is you caught back into this war too. You had no place in it, you have no obligation to try and clean up the mess that Dumbledore caused.” Hadrian looked up at them, his parents.
.” Draco thought it was a little unfortunate that Dragma (male Dragma? They would figure this out. Maybe middle names?) didn’t laugh again or continue talking with that deep rumbling voice. Alex seemed to stew angerly at the two basically ignoring his existence. Ron, a Weasley, stayed quiet and watched with confusion.
“Harry did soccer?” Erin nodded.
“Essentially.”
“Where’s your husband Severus?” The dark-haired man snorted and glanced at the clock. “Ah, well, I’ll wait a bit before starting breakfast then. How did you two sleep?”
“Obviously, we’re friends with Draco, Vince, and Greg. I would say we get along with pretty much everyone else. I don’t have beef with anyone in particular and Hadrian’s way too chill to really piss anyone off. As for our muggle school, not really? We had friends, but they were more school friends? Like, you hang out at school, but nowhere else? Hadrian has always been my first and best friend, more so after we adopted him.”
“This may not offer much comfort, but all my charges are under my care. They are my snakes and as such I won’t let anyone hurt them. Hadrian may have been my godson when he was a Potter if Lily had forgiven me for my mistakes. I owe him for not seeing what they’d done and letting my hatred of his father blind me to shielding him.”
“Those two don’t, I have a black owl named Akumu. He was my mother’s but she got him when I was a baby and he imprinted of me, so she gifted him to me when I was ten so I could send my own letters. I wanna meet Hadrian’s snake though, what breed is it?” The long hair brunet answered for his sister.
“SLYTHERIN!”
“A what?” Hadrian rolled his eyes, getting up and flanking Draco as Laney tried to describe their mother’s job with the international bioterrorism group as a high ranking soldier in wizarding terms that Draco could possibly understand. However, that conversation was interrupted as they were stopped by two lions standing in front of the Potions Labs.
“Hello Headmaster, it’s good to see you! What are they doing here? Did you call
Hadrian gave a pointy grin. That’d work.
Hadrian was happy, lazily doting on his honeybee. Draco beside him trying to wrestle Suni into submission as the snake threw herself on top of every piano music sheet the blond pulled out to read and study. Laney was having the time of her life terrorizing the peacocks and Annabee was being spoiled rotten not only by him, but the Lady of the house as well. (Their mothers were both working and spending ‘quality time together’ and he couldn’t hear it through the walls. A plus).
The absence of both of his babies stung like knife embedded in his chest.
“I will do whatever you want because you’re my precious angel.” Mother sighed.
“Basil.”
“He’ll visit if that’s what he wants. And only what he wants. I won’t force my son to see the people who abandoned him.” With that the two women brushed out of the office. Severus and the Potters hot on their heels where outside the office Severus had to smother the chuckle that threatened to escape.
Their reputation untainted and in the clear from the hurled accusation, Hadrian had two weeks to figure out the plan to end his brother’s beloved social life and turn it into a PR nightmare when Alex did all the work for him.
“I wouldn’t worry about me ma’am.” Severus could see the shorter man’s hand squeeze Draco’s thigh under the table and held back a spit take. Internally he was cackling, Hadrian was still smiling like a church boy as the hand squeezed again when Draco wheezed quietly. The young man would’ve made a good Slytherin, Severus mused.
After breakfast James would throw him into his room, Lily had warded the door against being locked by James.
Harry was always so easy.
-Ruins what’s left of the Potter standing (even without accusation and trial)
Bitterness and anger and hate hate hate hate
Hadrian hadn’t been kidding when he said he was going to use the end of school to spruce up the place.
Hadrian didn’t respond.
“I’ll go with him.” And off those two went. Laney smiled anxiously.
“Maybe he won’t notice if we bolt to our next class, he can’t try to corner us if he can’t catch us.”
“Ah, Sara Anderson and Erin Dragma yes? I’m Lucius Malfoy, Draco’s father and now your barrister in Wizarding Britain. It’s a deep pleasure to meet the mothers of Draco’s closest friends, he speaks quite fondly of Hadrian and seems to be baffled and intrigued by your daughter.” Lucius extended his hand as Erin nodded and Sara grinned. Greeting both of them warmly.
“Shouldn’t we be getting to bed?” Draco nodded and slipped off the bed, all of them getting changed and wandering off to their beds. Hadrian didn’t even bat an eye when Suni snuck up onto the bed for a cuddle, nor when Laney attached herself to his back, a fuzzy bundle squished between her chest and his back. The raven just closed his eyes and accepted it was going to be a family cuddle. Not the worst thing in the world.
Although he griped about wearing an uncomfortable glamour their lord was quickly swayed with the promise of a relaxing and
, he’s July 31
“Alex is doing wonderfully, the Weasley boys and him have been thick as thieves, the loud and rambunctious lot they are.” Snape figured this was his turn now as he kept a vigil on the two mothers’ side.
“It’s a pleasure to meet you Hadrian.” The crooked grin looked so innocent in that moment that Draco almost laughed hysterically as Hadrian grabbed her hand with both of his.
“Harry was attached! I didn’t want Suni to get sick from wild rodents, he would have been heart-broken! Then you know Laney would have been upset and Annabee would have a downright melt down that her brother was sad.”
Or take a flying leap out of his window and hope the wards rip him to shreds.
“How long have you and my son been together?” Hadrian peeked at him, a hand squeezing his knee under the table.
“Hadrian. Leandra. Go play with your friends. I need to talk to your professor.
“I’ve heard so much about you Lady Malfoy that I feel like I already know you. Please, all of you, come in and make yourselves comfortable. I’ll make some tea and we can chat while I finish dinner. I’m sure a warm meal and a safe roof is a priceless thing.” His green eyes sparkled when Hadrian leaned back towards him. Going on his tiptoes to give Draco a kiss and a pat on the chest.
-I won’t starve to death waiting
“Haden! Haden!” Alex’s chest burned when that gained the first ever full blown smile he’d ever seen from his twin in all of their days together at home and now at school. It didn’t feel fair. He was his brother. He should get Harry’s smiles. His attention and doting. Instead, he watched as his taller brother curled around and coddled the tiny girl with his whole body, sharing his space with both girls that were
“The pet snake?” Sara grinned. Suni had been her idea.
So Alex not only was responsible for points lost (an extreme 50 points) and detention for a month, Laney was also extremely well liked by quite a few people in all the houses. She was fun loving, and chaotic while still being sensitive and kind. Social rating for Alex plummeted. The most important consequence was one he hadn’t seen coming.
The blonde paused, green eyes flashing in his mind. It was April, Hadrian wouldn’t be expecting it, but he also had the landline if he wasn’t at the café. He had a home, technically, it was Hadrian’s home. He’d always said that Draco was always welcome. The key in his pocket felt heavier than lead. His uncle saw his hesitation.
“Don’t we have to get sorted now? Oh! They’re calling names! Boys let’s roll!” Leaning out of her brother’s arms, neither boy had time to react as Laney grabbed Hadrian and Draco by their robes and shoved them forward merrily. A skip in her step as she separated her brother and friends from the massive prick. “Vincent! Gregory! Let’s go boys, we’re holding up the line!”
“I share a room with you. I
Unless, that's not really what happens
Even if it's not with the light.
Hadrian’s adopted parents resembled the two Dragmas. It was made more difficult when physically Snape saw the uncanny resemblance James held toward both his sons, but expressively wise was nowhere near like Hadrian.
“You made English tea?”
Weeks passed with school work, the world's most interesting Halloween feast, and cramming as many politics lessons into his head as possible. Hadrian was exhausted and more than content to simply exist. It was another one of those meetings the Headmaster had to arrange with his mothers and the Potters, where more arguing and useless bantering happened. Severus was escorting the children, Draco tagging along like a lost puppy with Hadrian (the crush his godson had was disgustingly cute). Severus was quick to grab the children and place himself in front of them as Sara slammed open the portrait door gasping for breath.
“That’s… awful. That’s like Urbosa wanting me dead when I was declared to have a dark affinity. Magic is of the soul and the body, morals of evil and good are of the heart and mind. They have no link besides how you use them together. The most evil king in our history was a light sorcerer, our greatest had no magic at all. Why would he want you dead?”
If Hadrian wasn’t a man of passivity, he might already be in Azkaban by now.
as Severus and Draco rounded the corner. Right on time to see the older Potter twin staring at his god daughter lying on the ground, face swollen and wand nearly ten feet away from where she was moaning in (exaggerated pain).
