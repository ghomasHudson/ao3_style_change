N.E.W.T.s were steadily approaching, and the level of stress and panic in the older students was rising at such a rate, one could practically smell it in the air. Draco, however, found himself surprisingly unconcerned about the upcoming exams. He was far more devoted to the studies of his apprenticeship.
“Yes, I know,” Potter replied, slowly. “You were the one who was telling me it’s normal to, er, fly for both teams, or however you put it.”
this chapter has been kicking my ass for three months. also I've had a lot going on but whatever, point is it's here now! hope you enjoy.
“Heidi and I both got offers from the Harpies, right? It’s the only team that bid on the both of us and we both love them, so I thought she’d want to join them with me, but we were talking and she said she’s leaning more towards taking the Falcons’ offer and I just feel sort of…narked about it.”
Not wanting to draw attention to himself, he quickly sat himself down in a mustard-coloured chair near the door, stroking the armrest almost automatically, as if his body was searching for something—anything—to soothe him.
“Everything alright?” Harry asked. He could tell Ron was just barely restraining himself from interrupting, so he shot him a quick look and nod.
“Yes,” said Draco, hesitating, as though trying to decide whether he wanted to elaborate or not. Finally, he did, speaking in a slow and careful voice, though he still wouldn’t meet Harry’s eyes. “We met for a drink recently.”
“Blimey, Hermione!” Potter exclaimed, jumping in surprise at the sound. To Draco’s surprise, Granger actually looked apologetic.
“Er…” Harry didn’t know what to say to this, as he knew it was thanks to Malfoy that their potion even came out right, but he couldn’t exactly admit that he had basically done nothing to Slughorn. Before he could figure out what to say, however, Slughorn had already moved on to the next table. Once they were dismissed, Harry went to say something to Malfoy, perhaps apologize for Slughorn completely ignoring him and crediting their potion to Harry alone, but as soon as Harry turned to face him, Malfoy was already out of his seat and halfway out the door.
Draco felt himself go speechless, finally withdrawing his right hand from Armstrong’s mane to trace his fingers faintly over the tattoo. The parts that Luna had just added were slightly raised and tender and he could feel the delicate lines.
“Ah, it must be a secret. That’s alright, I’ll go along with it. Transfiguration is a good cover,” she nodded again and flashed him a wide smile. “I hope it’s something you enjoy.”
“You’re stuck. Merlin, you’re stuck in your Animagus form and my owl nearly ate you. Swear you won’t have me arrested when you’re back as a human?”
“A hyacinth,” Draco managed. “Blue means sincerity. Purple mean sorrow for a wrong committed and…and deep regret…and asking for forgiveness.”
“Yeah,” Harry said, not really meaning it. He didn’t know how he felt about starting Auror training right away. The war had
In retrospect, it was quite clear that much of his malice was rooted in jealousy, however he didn’t fully understand how much Potter detested media attention until they were partnered up.
look past the monstrosity on my arm, I never even got my N.E.W.T.s, I’m not qualified for anything. And when Mother…” Malfoy paused, and Harry felt a jolt in his stomach as the thought that Malfoy was holding back tears. “After she was Cursed, I tried everything to get someone to see her. They turned her away at St. Mungo’s again and again, even after she got worse. I looked for private Healers, but I couldn’t afford them, and no one wanted to be associated with the Malfoy name. All I could do was take care of her the best I know how, but I’m not a Healer, I don’t know what I’m doing.”
Narcissa had insisted that one of the remaining Malfoy house-elves be assigned to him. Draco had attempted to argue, but he should have known better than to try and dissuade Narcissa of something once her mind was made up, so Polkey officially became his house elf. He had managed, at least, to convince the two of them that Polkey should spend most of her time at the Manor, since he was often at work anyway, but Polkey still came around to prepare meals and clean up.
He turned the corner with his hand firmly wrapped around his wand, hearing the vague sound of conversation, but relaxed his hand when he saw a silver and green scarf on one of the figures.
He supposed she had come to check on him after Ron had told her he wasn’t going to come to pub night. He opened the door, ready for Hermione to rush in and fuss.
Draco’s head jerked around, his hand automatically reaching into his robes and pulling out his wand, his heartbeat rocketing up in record time.
“Have you been down to visit the herd of Thestrals?” she asked casually, as if the two of them were old friends. “The babies’ wings have finally grown in.”
that the fact that Potter kept coming back to him was pure, sheer luck, and more than he was worth, and more than anything, he
This wasn’t really alright with Harry, but he didn’t have the energy it would take to argue with Malfoy, and certainly not when he seemed to be…emotionally involved.
“It’ll be alright,” said Harry, and as the words came out of his mouth, he felt a strange certainty that they were true. “We’ll figure it out.”
“Ow, alright, alright, I’m sorry,” he placated and Summoned the owl treats from the drawer in the kitchen where he kept them, and offered one to Elpis. “Here you go. I’d wager you’re rather tired then, aren’t you?”
He had been doubtful, certain that his illness was something else, but he’d followed her instructions nonetheless and found that she was mostly right; the stress and the tiredness slowly dissipated as he gave himself more time to rest.
“Hmm,” Hermione seemed to think this over. “Honestly, Harry, I think you might need to just go with your gut here.”
Harry sighed. It was, of course, the obvious answer, but it was also the one he was avoiding. He didn’t know why, but he felt nervous about bringing this up to Draco. He was terrified that he would look weird or crazy for it. The friendship between them was still so new and it felt…shaky sometimes.
Theo was looking at him, his dark eyes wide and questioning, and Draco looked away, his heart beating rather quickly.
“Lots of people for an N.E.W.T. level class, don’t you think?” Ron said, voicing Harry’s thoughts aloud.
“How so?” Granger asked, and Draco was glad that she seemed interested. He hoped she would be able to find some answers, since the past three hours had been fruitless for him.
“Yes, Harry,” Granger said, somewhat shortly. She was frowning, and Draco started to worry. What if there was no way to fix this?
“Don’t worry, no birds were harmed in the making of this quill. Birds shed feathers all the time, you should know that. I only buy ethically sourced quills, I promise.”
Draco helped her to her feet and began walking her back towards the stairs, only stopping when he realized Potter wasn’t following them.
“No, thank you. I’m fine. I know they’re supposed to be frightening. I’m sorry I couldn’t cast the spell.”
“You see this?” he said, as Ella and Daphne stared at the scarred Dark Mark. “I am the only Marked person in this castle. I am responsible, not you nor any other Slytherin. Next time, you tell them that if they’re angry about the war, they can take it up with me.”
“I remember her boggart? It was a girl bleeding. A girl who looked like her. Did someone in her family die?”
She was also very friendly with Sophie, in a different way to how she was with Harry and Ron. Hermione had never had very many female friends, except for Ginny and Luna, with whom Hermione didn’t really have much in common. Sophie, on the other hand, was rather similar to Hermione, which Harry frequently liked to point out to Ron, earning himself a smack on the back of his head every time.
Harry felt like people were spinning all around him, as Molly fetched the champagne glasses and one was shoved into his hands. The noise only lessened once again when everyone’s glasses were full, and eyes turned once again to Bill and Fleur, waiting for them to speak.
But you’re the one teaching me about Muggle things! At least tell me enough so I can look it up in the library!”
“You did,” said Potter, sounding a little odd. After a brief pause, he asked, “Was that a Thestral?”
“You’re too kind, sir,” Draco said, feeling that same sort of hollowness he’d felt at Luna and Violet’s words. Ollivander regarded him.
Draco found himself looking forward to going to the Ministry, just so he could have those short conversations with Potter. The more days that passed however, the more disheartened he became at Potter’s surprised expression when he entered the Auror headquarters. He knew that Potter wasn’t remembering any of these conversations, and he hated knowing that they could never become real friends like this.
They walked back to where the others were sitting with smiles on their faces, Harry finally feeling like everything was maybe going to be alright.
“Yeah, you too. Good work,” Draco said, and Chang offered him a smile, before patting his shoulder and nodding at Potter.
“Thanks!” Neville answered, brightly. “Edgar Caverly actually gave me the seeds, his family owns a farm where they grow all sorts of magical plants.”
“Go on, Potter, take it,” Draco said, his voice snappy and impatient. Harry looked up at him, but Draco wasn’t meeting his eyes.
That was the first time Draco endured the Cruciatus Curse under his father’s hand. His mother had gasped and recoiled, but stayed in her seat after Draco threw her an expression to indicate it was alright.
“It’s extraordinarily difficult though,” she had said, with a thoughtful look on her face. “You’d have to be an exceptionally skilled Occlumens. It’s also draining. Putting up an Occlumency shield during a short period of time is one thing, but trying to do it all the time is exhausting. And since he doesn’t know when you get to hear his thoughts, he must be keeping his shields up all day.”
Draco let out an involuntary yell and automatically rushed towards Potter to grab him as he began to fall.
Draco had a very strange expression on his face, looking as though someone had just clubbed him in the head. What followed was a stretch of silence so long that Harry almost thought Draco had just decided to ignore him, until he spoke.
“Don’t worry, Harry, you were great,” Demelza reassured him. “Very personable and candid, my supervisors were pleased.”
“You know Hermione,” he said, with a shrug. “She’ll drown herself in schoolwork if given the chance.”
That was why Harry hadn’t been surprised to learn that he was so good at Occlumency, he seemed to be able to shut himself off at a second’s notice. But with emotions, he was unpredictable, because Harry had very little frame of reference to compare it to.
“He’s quite busy, as well,” Harry said, thinking of how exhausted Ron was every time he saw him. “We still see each other though; we’re getting lunch today, actually.”
Granger was making good points, but Draco was distracted by a sudden lightness in his stomach. He wouldn’t have even thought of researching it if it weren’t for Violet and Daphne, but this directly affected
“You only say that because you love to argue,” Nott said, with a wide smile on his face. Harry, who had never seen Nott so much as smirk, was rather taken aback.
“I suppose,” Draco sighed. “I lived my whole life there—it’s time to stir now, go on—but it doesn’t feel…right, being there. It’s like I can still feel him there.”
They sat there, a strange and awkward silence falling over them. Harry’s heart was still racing, and he felt like he was growing short of breath, just sitting there on the sofa.
“Right,” Potter said, scratching at the back of his neck. “And you want me to…talk…to this understudied, unpredictable, easily startled, venomous snake?”
Draco’s eyes snapped to his side, where Potter was calmly looking at the snake, his tongue bitten between his teeth. The snake’s eyes were now on Potter as well, its body seemed to sway slightly, before it released a low hiss.
Waking up to find Harry Potter in his bed was nearly enough to distract Draco from his blinding hangover. Nearly. Draco groaned and fumbled to find his wand, Summoning his Hangover Potion. He took a gulp and leaned back into his pillow, waiting for his headache to drain away. He felt the mattress shift beside him and his eyes flew open.
“Yeah, they are,” Violet replied, seemingly understanding exactly what Draco meant. “They used to be way more into that ‘pureblood is superior’ stuff, but after Laurel, they sort of had to reanalyse everything they believed in. She changed everything. They had to take her into hiding during the war. Wanted me to come with them, but I stayed at Hogwarts.”
Surprisingly, Narcissa had encouraged it, proclaiming that it was time for Draco to be his own man. She had been proud of his work, even though Draco knew that Lucius would have sneered about it, and had offered to help Draco search for a new place to live. Draco had turned her down, because he knew she’d end up taking over the task entirely. He did promise to have her over as his first guest however, and he had followed through once he had made the purchase.
“I’ll see you there,” Potter said, and before Draco could say another word, Potter had vanished with the familiarly loud
“It’s not all bad, Harry,” Parvati said, with an optimistic tilt in her voice. “Maybe you’ll fall in love!”
“It was his uncle,” Draco muttered, knowing it didn’t matter. Theo and his father had distanced themselves from Cantankerus Nott, but that hadn’t stopped his actions from staining the family name and causing everyone to assume Theo and his father were also Death Eaters.
“Why?” she asked, which was precisely the question Harry didn’t have an answer to. So instead, he decided to tell her about their last session, about what had happened after he had stupidly slashed open his own arm and Malfoy had healed it and yelled at him, and about the strange conversation they had had afterwards.
“Excellent!” Ollivander said, clapping a wizened hand on Draco’s shoulder. “You are making tremendous strides, my boy. Your theory on the cores was
“Yeah, we had to have him remove the spell in order to release you,” Chang confirmed. “He was upstairs, Transfigured himself into a bed.”
Harry felt his stomach sink more and more with every word Ashworth said. He didn’t have anything against the idea, exactly, but his standing in school was nothing like it was in fifth year, when he was in charge of Dumbledore’s Army. In fact, it was completely the opposite now. Instead of the outcast, he was now the Boy-Who-Lived-Twice, Saviour of the Wizarding World, as much as he hated it. How was he supposed to find someone who actually needed tutoring and was able to take him seriously as a teacher, instead of seeing him as the Harry Potter? It wasn’t like he could just get old members of the D.A. either, they had already learned what he had to teach them.
Harry pondered this. He supposed it made sense—Ginny and Cho were both excellent Quidditch players, and it would explain the slight lurch in his stomach he had gotten at the sight of Dominic Armstrong heading into the changing rooms. Hermione hadn’t mentioned anything about them being
“You have no idea what this experiment could do for our knowledge of time, Granger,” he said, pulling out his wand. “And you’re disrupting it for him?”
“I was supposed to have my meeting with my Head of House today,” he said, trying to ignore Dumbledore’s portrait and the intense, twisting pain in his stomach that he felt because of it.
Casting an eye at the rest of the ingredients on the table, he added, “You can take the morning dew back. It doesn’t need to be added for another week.”
Lovegood had been far too polite to him—friendly, even, at times. Ollivander had been a tired sort of polite as well, while Thomas had remained mostly silent, staying in the corner of the dungeons and not even looking at Draco. The goblin had been the only adversarial one and that had stopped as soon as Draco withdrew his wand in silent threat. Draco had secretly been glad he didn’t have to curse him.
“I guess not,” he replied. “But it’s normal to want to know that kind of stuff about somebody you care about. Whether you’re together or not, you care about her, right?”
“It’s not bloody Mermish, Potter, it’s just Potions,” Draco rolled his eyes and looked back at his book. “If we manage to unearth something here before nightfall, I’ll help you with Potions.”
Arrested? He’d just spend two days patching up Harry’s wing, why on earth would he have him arrested?
Draco suppressed a snort. He supposed he should have expected that; it must have been quite hard to believe that Draco Malfoy was suddenly all chummy with Muggles and Muggle-supporters. Sometimes he didn’t even realize how much he’d changed until he was confronted with moments like these.
“Sometimes,” he nodded. “Not often, I don’t think. I mean, when I was thirteen, I accidentally blew up my aunt. And last year, sometimes my magic would just come out without me casting a spell.”
Granger nodded, but cast another worried look at Potter before sitting and turning to Draco, who wondered if Potter’s aversion to loud noises had anything to do with his accidental attack of the Weasel.
“Don’t be so dramatic, Draco, of course you do. I received a letter from Headmistress McGonagall for you; they’re invited the students of your year back to Hogwarts to properly finish. You’re going to do just that.”
“Glad she wasn’t trying out when I was,” Ron said, when she made an extraordinary block by hanging upside down on her broom and kicking the Quaffle away with the tip of her foot.
“Hey, Harry, I almost forgot, do you wanna come to Hogsmeade with me this weekend?” asked Ron, as he began loading his plate with seconds.
“Yeah, she’s the one who finally got me to realise I was burned out,” Harry admitted. He didn’t know why he was suddenly divulging all of this personal information, but it just came so easily. He tried to ignore the voice in the back of his head that was practically screaming at him that he had
“We just need to gain access to the dungeon. There could be all sorts of evidence in there that could further the case. There’s only one way in and the snake is guarding it.”
“As much as I hate to say it, sometimes your gut is right. You’re an intuitive person, Harry. I know it’s difficult and I know you’re nervous, but I think if you’re open and honest, you’ll be fine. You and Draco overcame years of enmity to become friends. I think you can handle this.”
“Ah,” said Draco, feeling disappointed. “Yes, normally I send Eleanor, as I tend to be quite busy. Not to worry, Potter, she’ll be fetching them next time.”
“Good memory,” she said, and turned away to find them a table. Meanwhile, Draco went up to the bar to order their drinks. He let out a breath he hadn’t been aware he was holding. Perhaps he was nervous for no reason, he told himself. Maybe Pansy just wanted to catch up, now that she was back in town. Maybe she was reaching out, looking for friends, because she wanted to try and move back to Britain for good.
“But, but who is this person?” Harry asked. “What makes them my soulmate? Or, supposed soulmate or whatever.”
Harry felt like he was having whiplash. Seven years of knowing Draco at school and in the past five minutes, he’d been directed with expressions from him he’d never seen before.
Harry was watching Hermione, carefully. He knew she often had to keep secrets for her job, but he liked to think he knew her well enough by now to be able to tell whether she knew something or not. She didn’t seem to be displaying any of the usual signs that she was keeping something to herself though—her eyebrows weren’t tense and mouth wasn’t twitching at the sides as if itching to speak. Instead, she was looking at Ron with a slightly amused but sympathetic expression.
“I’m doing it right now,” said Draco, his heart thrumming. He kept walking down the hall, refusing to turn around and look at Finchley again, worried he would lose his nerve.
She shoved the toast into her mouth, holding it with her teeth, grabbed her book-bag, and waved at them before hurrying away.
Two years later, incredibly, Draco could actually call them friends. They worked well together, Potter’s intuition lending itself to Draco’s logic, Draco’s methodical approach complementing Potter’s gut instincts.
“She’s well,” he said, sighing. There was really no point in trying to distract Potter, he was always ready with more questions.
Draco trailed off, his brain catching up to his mouth, but it was too late. Potter was looking at him, expectantly.
“As long as you keep catching the Snitch and participate in interviews at the same rate as your teammates, I’m happy,” she’d say.
“Ladies, we have more than we could possibly even need, please sit so we can start this delicious meal.”
“Fisticuffs!” she exclaimed. “I am truly at a loss for words. I am quite familiar with the many differences you boys have had over the years,”
The rest of the class went off in relative silence for Harry and Malfoy, only interrupted by Malfoy occasionally muttering instructions like, “pass the pomegranate seeds,” or mild reprimands like, “does that
“Ravenclaw,” Harry supplied. “Mostly because Zacharias Smith is the Hufflepuff Seeker and he’s a tosser. He did terrible too, the Snitch was right in front of him at least three times and he still didn’t catch it.”
you were in my career prospects. I’ll make sure to consult you next time I plan on making any decisions regarding
Ron was yelling loudly throughout most of the game, especially when a Hufflepuff Beater pelted Bludger at Ginny and hit her right in the ribs, causing her to double over on her broom.
“I’m on duty today,” Potter explained, rolling out of bed. Draco got up as well, pulling on a dressing gown as Potter re-dressed.
“Why would he do that?” Ron just looked confused, but Hermione, who had been nose-deep in a book as usual, seemed to gather that something was going on, and set down her book.
“I want to try something,” Draco said, standing up and walking over to sit beside Potter on the sofa.
“I’m meeting with Ollivander tomorrow evening,” Draco replied, as they departed from the third floor corridor. “But I should have time on Thursday if that would work for you?”
Potter came over about once a week, sometimes less often if he were particularly busy with work. The first few times, they hovered a bit; Draco offered wine and they sat there and sipped and made small talk, until finally Potter would snap and say, “this is stupid,” and reach out to pull Draco into a kiss. After a while, they fell into a rhythm. Sometimes Potter would be in a rush, and he’d just throw himself at Draco the second he was through the door. Other times, he seemed intent on torturing Draco with his slow and teasing kisses. Potter rarely stayed the night, typically Flooing home after they were done, and they never went out, or, for that matter, met at Potter’s place. Draco was very aware of what he was to Potter—a convenience—and despite his pride, he accepted it, because he knew it was the most he was ever going to get from Potter, and far more than he deserved.
She sat with her legs crossed, a book open in her lap. Her thick black hair was piled up messily atop her head, and she twirled a quill between her fingers, a faraway look in her eyes.
“I cannot do this,” Harry mumbled under his breath, his heart rate picking up with every step he took towards the Velvet Tearoom. He felt exceedingly nervous and unsure of himself. He had taken nearly an hour to dress, when it typically only took him ten minutes, and he had gone through practically every set of robes he owned until he decided to throw caution to the wind and go Muggle instead.
Making the decision that he was going to go and see Draco had been incredibly difficult in and of itself, so it was no surprise that actually
Draco shot one last vicious look at Potter, surprised to find bright green eyes staring back at him. Ripping his gaze away, Draco followed Theo up the stairs to the boys’ dormitories. He entered Theo’s shared room with the Hufflepuffs to find it empty, other than one bed with the bedcurtains drawn.
“It looks like her,” Potter replied. It did, she had the same heart-shaped lips, the same delicate, curly brown hair. She seemed to be asleep in the portrait, her hands folded in her lap, and her chest moving slowly as she breathed.
He couldn’t believe it. After everything that had happened yesterday, he had had to loop again. Buggering Jamison.
Despite getting nothing but positive feedback from Northstar regarding his performance thus far, Harry was still the most nervous for the photoshoot.
Agh, I know this is late, sorry about that. Been traveling a lot lately and I also managed to catch a cold so I'm just a whole ass mess rn. Will try my best to have the next chapter up in a week tho :)
A spark of yellow shot from Draco’s wand, and Potter’s blood began to run in the other direction, returning to Potter’s arm before the gashes closed up neatly, leaving no evidence of any wound. Potter’s long white scar, the same size as Draco’s Dark Mark, remained.
At precisely two minutes after noon—after Finchley himself had gone—Draco went for lunch. The food served at the Ministry canteen was nothing compared to the food at Hogwarts, let alone the food Draco was raised on at the Manor, but it was free, and at this point in his life, Draco knew when to swallow his pride and take what was on offer.
“But it was also a symbol of despair and grief. The loss of love. It was a flower of pain. Its connection with death also led to people believing it had the power to resurrect the dead, though not as much as the poppy. Some people thought the marigold to be a positive flower, too. Medieval wizards used to carry them as love charms when they wanted to attract someone new. They were said to represent winning someone’s affection through dedication and hard work. But the marigold’s association with death was too strong for it to truly escape.”
“Hello, love,” Draco greeted her with a warm smile. Harry felt his stomach lurch, unwittingly imagining Draco regarding him with that warmth, calling him ‘love’…
There were several gasps from the class, and Harry didn’t know if it was because of the rattling desk or the powerful wandless magic their new instructor had so casually just performed.
“Scared, Potter?” he asked. Harry looked at him. He had a cocky smirk on his face, and his eyes were shining again.
“Hermione?" Harry asked, tentatively, approaching his friend at one of the desks in their common room. “Can I talk to you a moment?”
“I do wonder,” Ollivander said, his voice suddenly changing to sound curious, “what the current status of ownership of the hawthorn wand might be.”
Draco was trying to teach himself how to cook, something he only thought of after a thorough admonishment from his best friend—
“It’s not stupid, Potter,” Draco said. “And trust me, I’m always the first to tell you when you do something stupid.”
“If you’re desperate to know, Potter, I’m apprenticing in Transfiguration and there’s no one more skilled in the field than Minerva McGonagall. Next time you feel the urge to poke your nose into other people’s business, however, kindly do so on your own time and leave me out of it.”
a third option: freezing. And Draco was frozen, physically unable to move, seemingly only able to concentrate on Potter’s hand wrapped around his bicep, on the proximity of Potter’s body, on the sensation of Potter’s breath coming out hot and gentle against his face, on the vivid green of his eyes.
Foxblade gave a stunted nod and let Malfoy lead her back to their seats. Harry watched them, watched how Greengrass looked at Foxblade with worry all over her face, watched how tightly clenched Malfoy’s jaw was.
“Here,” Potter returned, dumping an armful of supplies onto the table. Draco massaged his temple with an index finger.
McGonagall mid-lecture, but before she could direct another dangerous look their way, her office door burst open with a loud bang.
He never talked about it with his father either, not even after the war as they awaited trial. He hadn’t brought it up to anyone, hadn’t even spoken the words aloud; it seemed far too difficult. It was easier just to shove it all down, to try and pretend like it had never happened, like it had all just been in his head.
“They’re sort of like…Muggle psychologists, but for wizards and witches. You know what psychologists are, right?”
“It must be said, you are far more innocent than I am,” Malfoy went on. “Can a bird even be guilty? You have no moral compass. Merlin, you don’t even understand what I’m saying and here I am, blabbering at you all day.”
He dreaded the idea, but he knew showing Hermione he was serious about it would get her off his back. As expected, Hermione looked satisfied with this answer, and resumed eating her dinner.
“Definitely for a nefarious purpose. It’s all a plot, Potter, I lured you here so that I could poison you with laced pumpkin juice.”
Harry looked at him, curiously. This was their fourth session, and Harry was simply glad that there hadn’t been any arguments between them, or insults thrown. Malfoy had gotten impatient last session when he couldn’t master a spell quite as quickly as he wanted, and he had said that maybe Harry would have made a better Auror after all, but that was incredibly tame for him, and Harry had just laughed. But they also hadn’t talked about anything other than the spellwork, and Harry wasn’t sure if doing so was the best idea. After all, it wasn’t like they had ever held a civil conversation before.
“As you may know, I previously taught Defence Against the Dark Arts at Ilvermorny. I myself attended there as a youth. I know you have been through several professors in your years here at Hogwarts, so I think for our first few days together, we will go through some review work based on my curriculum for the years below you. Once I have a grasp on where we are as a class, we’ll get started on the good stuff. Any questions?”
Draco suppressed a snort. He supposed he should have expected that; it must have been hard to believe that Draco Malfoy was suddenly all chummy with Muggles and Muggle-supporters. Sometimes he didn’t even realize how much he’d changed until he was confronted with moments like these.
“No, Mr Malfoy, sir, nothing is alright, I is not knowing what to do and no one is telling Tilly what to do!” The elf began twisting her ears in her hands, but it didn’t look like she was punishing herself, it seemed more to be out of anxiety.
There were gasps from around the classroom, as Foxblade stared at the lifeless body before her. Like Harry had been, she seemed to be frozen, unable to open her mouth and cast the spell. The longer she stood there, the more blood poured from the girl, the more her body sagged lifelessly.
“It’s a good base subject,” he said, truthfully. “I know it’s not as specialized, but it lets me keep my options open. I just couldn’t see myself as a Potioneer, no matter how much I enjoy brewing.”
“Excellent work, as always,” Slughorn said, approvingly as he passed by their table. “And you used a gold cauldron! Ah, Harry, my boy, you remind me of your mother. Take ten points for Gryffindor.”
He finally snapped out of it after days of holing up in his flat, having nearly made the rash decision of sending Potter an owl. He no longer knew what iteration of the loop he was on, and he was starting to grow desperate.
“I want to believe we are better than this,” McGonagall went on. “And I will not have my students tormenting each other in this castle. We have seen enough harm, we have seen enough pain. It’s time to move on. We should be helping each other heal our wounds, not creating new ones.”
“Oh, come off it,” Draco said. “Don’t tell me you really want to go to a Valentine’s party thrown by the
Harry paused for a minute, absorbing this. He wasn’t sure what Ginny meant about the feelings she had, the ones she said she thought everyone had. What kind of feelings were they? He didn’t exactly have much of a frame of reference when it came to romance. The brief, disastrous relationship he had with Cho didn’t include a lot of romance, and when he thought of his relationship with Ginny, the feelings he remembered most were jealousy, and desperation, and fear, and sometimes, a sweet relief, when he held her in his arms and felt warm and content and safe.
The last time he’d seen him was at his and Narcissa’s trials—one of the few times Harry had left the Burrow in the past several months.
“Your memories aren’t meaningless,” he said, softly but firmly. “Bad memories stick to you, they replay in your head over and over. They’re almost clearer in your memory than the good ones. Voldemort is the cause of most of my bad memories too. But, well, Hermione always says that he’d already taken up enough of my life and that I shouldn’t let memories of him take any more of it.”
“Ah, is this what’s bothering you, Potter? The fact that Weasley wasn’t ever able to truly love you?”
“It isn’t an eye for an eye, Draco,” she said, sharply. “Just because I told you my story doesn’t mean you have to tell me yours. You don’t owe me anything.”
“Help yourselves,” Greengrass said, with a nervous-looking smile, setting the radio down on the same table.
The rollercoaster his heart had been on today would require a good night’s sleep and some chamomile tea to recover from, as it suddenly felt like it was soaring. He stared at Harry, unable to believe what he was seeing, that this beautiful man in front of him
A few people laughed, but Harry automatically looked to the back of the classroom, where the Slytherins were seated. It was only Malfoy and two girls. One of them was the older Greengrass girl, and the other one looked vaguely familiar to Harry, though he couldn’t recall her name. She’d been there last night, when the confrontation with Theo had happened.
But the feeling of fear that he associated with the war hadn’t left him. He still woke up in cold sweats from nightmares featuring snakelike eyes and green light. He kept expecting to wake up and find himself in the Manor under Voldemort’s control, as if this unusual post-war world had all been a strange dream.
“Poppies are used in a variety of potions,” Draco continued, when it was clear Potter wasn’t going to say anything. “Opium poppies are even used in Muggle medicine,” at this, Potter’s head snapped up, as though shocked Draco could possibly know anything about Muggles. Draco chose to ignore this, partly because merely a short time ago, his surprise would have been completely founded.
“Committing horrific and evil crimes,” Malfoy replied promptly, pulling out an apple from his bag with a victorious look in his eye.
“I don’t know. We can’t help how we’re raised, I suppose. We believe what our parents tell us. You were raised to think all Muggles were inferior to wizards in every way. My parents would have raised me the exact same way if it hadn’t been for Laurel. They were forced to face the truth, and in that, they were lucky and so was I. Just because you weren’t doesn’t mean you’re a bad person. Not if you’re willing to challenge your old views when given new information.”
Malfoy merely rolled his eyes, and discreetly withdrew a miniscule glass vial from his bag. Reaching across the table, he picked up a large jar labelled
“Congratulations,” he heard himself saying, feeling a smile on his face without knowing how it got there.
“Professor Horace Slughorn has returned as Potions master and Head of Slytherin House,” McGonagall paused as the Hall politely applauded and Slughorn raised a pudgy hand in a sort of wave. “Rubeus Hagrid remains as Hogwarts gamekeeper and Care of Magical Creatures professor,” the applause was much louder for Hagrid, several Gryffindors even yelling out things like “Yeah, Hagrid!” and “Woo!”
“I’ve said all I intend to say to reporters at the Quibbler,” Draco said, in a practiced level tone, turning to walk up the stairs to his shop.
“Oh, yeah?” Harry cracked a smile at that. He could easily picture Ginny marching onto the set with the aggressive determination she did when she walked onto the pitch.
He’d always been slightly fearful of Thestrals, especially once he had been able to see them. He was old enough to know that the myths about them being omens of death were nothing more than superstitions, but they certainly
“Of course,” Harry mumbled, turning his head to see Draco Malfoy approaching the set, followed by Gabriel, who still looked rather cheerful and pleasant, and Demelza, who was chewing on her bottom lip and avoiding Harry’s eye.
And then the Dark Lord had questioned him, over whether his loyalty to his family was as great as his loyalty to the cause, and Lucius had hesitated just a little too long, and thus was issued a challenge.
Draco stared at her, and Daphne’s cheeks went furiously red. When it was clear Draco was unable to speak, Daphne launched into nervous speech.
“The entrance to your common room in the Founder’s Tower is behind a wall-mounted sixteenth century Persian rug, next to the portrait of Lady Kellestra. The current password is
It took Draco a moment to process this, so Theo grabbed his wrist and yanked him forward until Draco found himself closer to the bar, almost face to face with the barmaid.
“Originally, it was created to trap would-be robbers as well as create a saferoom of sorts. If a member of the household touched the part of the portrait that triggered the spell, they would be transferred to a saferoom within in the wall, enlarged using wizarding space. But if a stranger did the same, they would be taken to a room like this.”
“I’m glad to hear it,” Waya said, his voice becoming serious again. “Nothing wrong with some healthy rivalry, of course, but I find it’s never good to pit children against each other at an early age.”
think of him at all. It was just painful enough to keep such dangerous ideas at bay. But suddenly, Potter was back, coming to his favourite café, sending him owls and asking to meet, telling him about his
Draco frowned. Potter had never been conventionally attractive, it was true, but he had certainly grown into his looks the last few years. He was reasonably tall, though not as tall as Draco or Weasley, and not as skinny as he once used to be. He was all lean muscle and messy hair and bold smirks and Draco would be lying if he denied that a big part of the reason he went to such lengths to avoid Potter was because he was disconcertingly attracted to the man.
Harry had been sceptical during his first meeting, but had warmed up to her quickly. She was far more casual than his last Mind Healer, who had sat across from Harry with a clipboard, scribbling on it with a quill as Harry spoke and barely even making eye contact. Rhiannon had no clipboard, just a little Muggle-looking notebook on a side table that she’s occasionally jot down some notes in, and speaking to her felt far more like a regular conversation than some sort of medical appointment. She was also rather younger than her predecessor, with kind brown eyes and a head of messy black hair that strongly reminded Harry of his own, if just a bit longer. It had taken a few sessions, but Harry grew to trust her and feel comfortable being open and honest with her.
“Yes, Potter, you’ve been in school with her for eight years now,” he neglected to mention how even he had barely known Violet before this year.
“What oath?” Violet asked, and Draco was about to start explaining when a look of realization crossed her face. “Oh. People still do that?”
“You know what I mean,” Demelza waves her hand, dismissively. “It’s your brand. Tall, dark, handsome, mysterious.”
he tapped his glasses again, and quickly pulled out his Cloak from within his robes, sweeping it around himself without a second thought.
He knew how to wear a mask, how to hide everything he was feeling and give nothing away in his face or body language. He knew how to close himself off, how to switch his brain to work automatically, and separate himself from his body. Exposing one’s emotions was a sign of weakness and vulnerability, and Draco was taught never to look vulnerable.
Harry recognised her—unfortunately not by her pretty brown hair worn in bouncy waves past her chin, or her gentle, dimpled smile, but instead by the faded pinkish-white scar on her right cheek.
He’d never stopped hating it, though, so any time he could avoid it, he did. He’d imagined it would be so much worse cursing someone without a wand who was also as kind to him as Lovegood was.
Just like that, Draco’s heart fell again. That was never going to happen. Even if Potter agreed to let him have his wand back, he wouldn’t agree to experiment with it without a proper reason, and Draco couldn’t tell him the truth about his apprenticeship.
"Thank you, Professor,” he said, nodding at both Dumbledore and Snape, and then striding off down the spiral staircase and towards the Great Hall, feeling a sense of purpose return to his steps.
Potter make his usual uncomfortable-looking face, glancing from Draco to Slughorn, but surprised Draco when he spoke up.
Draco recalled his encounter with the gamekeeper in the woods. He had tried to be more polite, dedicated as he was now to reshaping all of his opinions and relationships after the war. But maybe he could keep disliking Hagrid.
Oliver was really not at all similar to Ron, but Harry could still understand why Hermione would be interested in him, as he was clearly on her intellectual level and the two seemed to be able to talk for hours.
Draco looked back in front of him, at the small parcel and letter that sat by his plate. He reached for the envelope, wanting to read his mother’s letter first.
“I know,” McGonagall said, her voice once again echoing across the Hall and silencing them all, “that you are disappointed, however I strongly believe that with your additional classes and workload, you would be hard-pressed to find the time to meet the demands of Quidditch as well. You are, of course, welcome to use the pitch for flying practice when it is not being used by the Quidditch teams.”
His wing burned in pain and a cawing sound came out of him, involuntarily. He didn’t want to think about what would happen if he couldn’t transform back. There was no way he was going to be able to fly away with his wing this badly injured.
They’d been working on this case for months now, and it had been one of the darkest, most frustrating ones yet. Someone had been hunting and murdering Squibs in some of the most brutal ways Draco had ever seen. The victims had all been women, and there was always an element of sexual assault, however the killer was disturbingly good at covering his tracks. It had seemed like no one had seen him, and, unfortunately, his choice in victims made it even more difficult, as many of the women had been cast away by their families and had been forced to live as Muggles. Draco and Potter had interviewed countless Muggles, even checking if they’d been Obliviated, but there wouldn’t have even been a need, as in a Muggle area, all the killer would have needed was a simple Disillusionment Charm.
Jamison raised his wand again, as if he was going to fight back, but before he could even get his arm up to cast, Potter’s wand was out and he was casting,
Draco’s own family members, so really, he had no right feeling bad for himself at all. Feeling oddly angry and appropriately guilty, Draco bid Violet and Daphne a good day and quickly left the Slytherin table, before Violet could start to figure out what was going on in his head.
Harry could feel his heart beating heavily against his chest, not sure what to do with himself but worked up all the same. He had agreed with the Prophet to have their address listed for any inquiries regarding the article, not wanting his own made public, and he silently begged that the man would decide to write to him.
She had a soft look on her face and Draco almost envied her for a moment, wondering what it was like to love someone so much.
“Have you two checked your schedules yet?” she asked, not pausing for a breath, let alone to let them answer. “When are your meetings with the new head of House? Do you know what you’re going to ask him? You still want to be Aurors, right? I
Harry looked at him, curiously. This was their fourth session, and Harry was simply glad that there hadn’t been any arguments between them, or insults thrown. Malfoy had gotten impatient last session when he couldn’t master a spell quite as quickly as he wanted, and he had said that maybe Harry would have made a better Auror after all, but that was incredibly tame for him, and Harry had just laughed.
He supposed it was for the best, since Malfoy clearly had a better handle on what they were doing. He let Harry prepare some of the ingredients, like sifting through the iguana blood or dicing the pixieweed. Sometimes he’d criticize him for how he was doing it, but Harry came to realize it wasn’t out of malice, but rather a side effect of how perfectionistic Malfoy really was. Sometimes he’d even be…
“Harry,” Hermione starts, pausing to scan over Harry’s face. “Have you thought about seeing a Mind Healer?”
“Thanks for agreeing to meet with me,” Harry finally said, fighting the urge to wince at how stilted he sounded.
There was a long, sharp intake of breath, and then Malfoy seemed to crumple, his shoulders dropping and the tension in his body fading as he relaxed into Harry’s arms. He lifted shaking arms and clutched at the back of Harry’s shirt as his body shook with dry sobs.
“You always did think me a bit full of myself, didn’t you? Well, you may not have been entirely wrong. Go on now and join your friends at dinner.”
had been repeating for him for days on end, how he had lost count of how many repetitions he had gone through, how he had quit his job one day and talked to Potter on another, and no matter what, he kept waking up on April 10
Harry sat there, unsure what to say. He felt as though his world had been shaken today, and here he was, having pictures taken of him during this existential realisation.
It took a while, but Gabriel’s patience with him and the familiarity of Dennis helped Harry relax slightly. When he started his individual shots, it took him a while to find his footing.
He found it relaxing, the sound of sizzling oil and water boiling, the smell of onions frying and bread baking, and he felt himself almost fall into the routine of it with a sense of comforting familiarity that he didn’t often feel. He realised that cooking wasn’t actually the part he disliked growing up, but rather the shrill nagging of Aunt Petunia following him around the kitchen, and—perhaps most importantly—the fact that he, more often than not, had not been allowed to
“Strange,” said Draco, his eyes focused on his now-empty teacup. “She’s almost exactly like I remember. We used to be quite close.”
Draco Summoned a quill and penned a quick note, asking after the senior wandmaker’s wellbeing and whether he would like to reschedule their meeting, and then called over Elpis, promising her a treat when she returned. She hooted happily as he tied the letter to her leg, and took off as soon as he opened the far window.
“Thank you,” said Draco, tucking the letter into his bag and giving Elpis another little scratch before sending her off to the Hogwarts owlery.
As it were, though, Draco was far too preoccupied to wonder about the strange qualities of the hallway he was walking down. Tonight was his first meeting with Ollivander, and he didn’t know what to expect. He still didn’t understand why Ollivander had agreed to mentor him, but he was overwhelmingly grateful that he had, so he didn’t want to mess up and make him change his mind.
“Erm,” Harry looked around the room, trying to find something to summon. Deciding on the Gryffindor flag hanging by Ashworth’s bookshelf, he cast, “
“Precisely. Blue flowers are quite rare in nature, but the Siberian larkspur is one of them. The first known use of larkspur flowers was to chase away scorpions and other such pests. Both Muggles and wizards used it for this reason, although wizards also believed that larkspur could protect them from ghosts and spirits.”
watch, with a pale grey dial and shiny black hour and minute hands that glistened under the Christmas lights that hung in the air. Circling around the dial were miniscule planets and the moon, displaying their orbit. The band was black and, as Draco traced a finger across it, he determined it must have been made from dragonhide. It was in remarkably good shape for being an heirloom and Draco picked it up gently. The face was unusually thin and, as he touched the back lightly with his fingers, he could feel there was some sort of inscription. He turned it over and found the letters
Harry didn’t like the way this insight made him feel. He found himself obsessing over sixth year again, over all the memories he had of Malfoy sneaking around. At the time, he had been sure Malfoy was up to something, and while he had been right, looking back with the knowledge that Malfoy was very much operating against his own will with the threat of his parents’ deaths looming over him made Harry’s stomach churn.
“When you’re told something your whole life, over and over, it becomes reality,” he said, trying to sound more sure of himself than he felt. “It’s ingrained in you. It’s a part of you. You almost become blind to anything that contrasts it or outside of it, because the tunnel vision can get so strong. When all of a sudden, the belief—that purpose—vanishes, it can leave you feeling lost. Even if it was…horrible and wrong and something you’re glad to be rid of, you can still feel like it’s missing from you, like you need to search for it. Like it’s just around the corner waiting for you.”
Harry had gaped at her, at a loss for words. She had gone on to tell him that he was showing classic signs of being burned out—in other words, he had worked himself to utter exhaustion. She sternly told him he had to cut down his workload and had to take more time for himself. She insisted he take proper care to make sure he was eating nutritious meals and sleeping enough hours at night.
“Yes, well, that’s where they store and create Time-Turners, and study the progression of life and the passage of time and such,” continued Granger. “And recently, they have proposed studying the effect of time on human beings, on how magical shifts in the space-time continuum would affect a person. While they don’t have to answer to the Aurors or the Magical Law Enforcement Squad, they
“Love, need I remind you where I’ve been these past few years? There is no shortage of attractive men with loose morals in Paris. But dating as a Death Eater here in Britain, I’ve got to say I’m curious.”
“I was wondering,” she finally spoke, in a tremendously soft voice, tucking a lock of golden hair behind her ear. “If you don’t mind my asking…have you taken the Oath?”
The stench that assaulted them upon entry of the house was horrific, and Draco felt his brain shoot him back in time. Suddenly he was seventeen again, sent to clean up the dungeons, the smell of decaying flesh surrounding him, a ringing in his ears as he tried not to look at their faces and swallow down the contents of his stomach threatening to come up.
He had sold one wand today thus far, to an energetic girl with wild blonde curls and a mother with the patience of a saint. She had tried six wands before finally landing on the right one, causing quite a bit of destruction in the shop. Her mother had apologized profusely, but Draco had smiled and waved it off, reassuring her that it was all part of the process. The girl had been delighted with her wand and had nodded and listened intently as Draco instructed her on how to care for it. After she had left with her mother, Draco pulled out his log and quill and added a new line.
but not everyone can study experimental potions. I think I would enjoy having a store, brewing for a living. It’s relaxing, potion-making.”
“Mum and Dad have known I was a lesbian since I was ten years old,” Violet said, light-heartedly, but Draco noticed how she discreetly placed a hand over Daphne’s on the table and squeezed it. Daphne offered her a warm smile.
Draco stretched out in his bed and sat up, feeling warm. He allowed himself a minute to wake up fully and get his brain working properly before drawing his bedcurtains and hopping out of bed. He dressed quickly and head into the bathroom to wash up. He found himself excited to get to breakfast. He supposed it was simply a force of habit, it was as if his body knew it was Christmas Day and started preparing him for it.
Throughout the war, but especially during his sixth year, he often felt as if it wasn’t even him inside his own body, as if he was watching himself from afar, as he cursed the necklace or poisoned the mead or worked on the Vanishing Cabinet. It was easier that way—to separate himself from the things he was doing, because he knew there was no other way he’d be able to accomplish them.
“Patronus charms are exceptionally difficult. Many grown wizards are unable to cast one. Spells that require much less power are typically those you would want to try to do wandlessly, as wandless magic in itself is quite challenging. However, given that you learned to cast a Patronus at only thirteen and have demonstrated immense skill at both wandless and nonverbal spells in our sessions thus far, I cannot say that it is impossible.”
“Yeah, exactly! But you know, even wizards don’t fully understand how Conjuration and Vanishment work, because no one can really explain or prove where Vanished objects go. And even with Conjuration, it isn’t like you’re creating energy out of nowhere, is it? Because you’re using your magic—that is, your
the Aurors would want to examine it. Harry thought of Narcissa—beautiful and glamorous—who had saved his life in the Forest, who had lied right to Voldemort’s face in order to save her son.
He let out a heavy sigh, taking off his glasses and rubbing at his eyes. He needed to get a hold of himself. If the man was going to such length to avoid Harry getting a glimpse of his thoughts, then clearly he didn’t want to have anything to do with him, and Harry was just going to have to accept that.
Everyone eagerly jumped into the subject change, even Hermione, who normally couldn’t give a toss about Quidditch.
His legs seemed to move of their own accord, and before he knew it, he was standing right in front of Potter and Granger’s desk. The two of them, alerted by his presence, looked up at him.
“Ah, bugger, you’re right,” Harry sighed. “Why did Ginny turn it down anyway? Isn’t she hoping to get recruited this year?”
Certainly not when he was growing up—the Dursleys barely ever acknowledged it and if they did, their gifts were often more insulting than receiving none at all—and though the Weasleys were kind enough to make him a lovely cake and attempt a party for his seventeenth, it had been slightly marred, of course, by the war and the heavy responsibility weighing on Harry’s shoulders.
Potter’s eyes bore into him in that deep, chilling way of his, and despite the warm weather, Draco felt a chill rush down his spine and arms.
“I talk too much now,” Draco grumbled, more to himself than to Potter. “This is all Violet’s fault.”
“Hello, Potter,” Draco greeted him politely, standing from his seat. Harry felt as though his hands might start shaking at any moment.
“I want them here,” Harry said, and everyone’s head whipped around to look at him. He didn’t know what made him say it. He supposed it was rather unfair, to invite everyone but the Slytherins, especially considering the fact that they were all sharing a common room together.
“This has nothing to do with you being Harry Potter,” Ginny waved him off. “This has everything to do with
Draco stared at her, and he felt oddly touched. Violet didn’t need to give him an explanation. Quite frankly, he didn’t deserve one. And yet, she had trusted him—a Death Eater—enough to tell him that her little sister was a Squib. She didn’t think him a bad person—which was more than he could say for most people.
The last two worked were spoken in a whisper, even though the Common Room was mostly empty and its few occupants were not paying any attention to the two of them over by the windows.
Draco, who knew that Finch-Fletchley was a Muggleborn, didn’t ask more. He could guess why Finch-Fletchley was staying, and he’d rather not have to say it out loud. A beat passed, where Theo and Draco chewed in silence and Draco felt his stomach twist uncomfortably.
“I haven’t been doing well so far this year,” Draco said, looking downwards in automatic shame. It was true. Although they were barely a week into classes, Draco had made absolutely no headway with Self-Transfiguration, and he was usually one of the first to make progress, typically right after Granger.
Actually, that was a lie; he knew exactly what he was doing here, but that didn’t help with how out of place he felt.
Dennis also acquiesced and Draco hesitantly reached for Harry, as though he were expecting Harry to physically push back.
Cordelia was looking at him with warm affection pooling in her brown eyes, as if checking that he were alright. Theo, who had lost the last member of his family when his grandmother had died a year ago, smiled reassuringly at her, and Draco quickly looked away, feeling like he had infringed on something personal.
Potter wordlessly picked up the offending glass bottle and walked off again. Draco let out a breath he didn’t know he’d been holding. He didn’t know what it was about Potter that made him so intimidating, but it frustrated him to no end that the boy had that hold over him. He’d known Potter since they were
Harry grinned at her as she walked back to her desk, and did as he was told, downing his cup of coffee and beginning to pack up his lesson plans.
Hermione protested and swatted at him and Ron laughed and batted her away and Harry felt a sudden lightness in his head.
“Their mother is dying. I think…I think they might be crying. I feel…sad. Sort of…distantly. It’s weird, it’s like…foggy, but I still feel it.”
It all came spilling out of Draco without him even realizing. When he drew in a sharp breath at the end of his rant, he could feel Potter’s eyes boring into his skull. He forced himself to keep his gaze focused on his work, deftly crushing the claws into a fine yellow powder.
“Potions, hmm?” Slughorn murmured, unhelpfully. “Anything in particular you’d like to do with Potions or are you interested in becoming a Potioneer?”
He didn’t know how he was going to make it clear who he was looking for in the interview. Would it seem insensitive if he spoke out about someone’s ill mother? What if the man wanted to keep it private? The man seemed to fear for his safety, after all. Harry wanted to help, but what if he actually made things worse?
He didn’t know if it was the effect of the pixie juice coming out in the fumes of the potion, or just another sign he was losing his mind, but Draco felt the words come out of him without permission, like he had no control over what he was saying.
“I need to go to Hogsmeade this week,” Draco began carefully, monitoring Theo’s face for his reaction. “I have to pick up a gift for Mother. Would you like to join me?”
“After you,” Draco said, gesturing towards the newly revealed hole in the wall. Ron gave him a highly suspicious look, but followed the girls as they entered the Common Room. Harry hung back for a moment, looking at Draco.
Draco was once again sitting beside Potter in the Quidditch stands, watching as Ravenclaw and Gryffindor battled it out in the pitch. The two Houses were neck-and-neck in the race for the Quidditch Cup, making it a rather intense game.
“Only in English, unfortunately,” he said, with a rueful smile. “And I will assure you that Spanish women do not find our language nearly as attractive as we find theirs.”
“Did you—” he floundered, unsure of what he was trying to aask, let alone how to ask it. “Are you—is this—?”
“Because they wanted to be,” Ginny said, like it was the most obvious thing in the world. “They had all these pent up feelings for each other and if they didn’t at least try to see where those feelings would take them, they’d be left wondering what could have been for the rest of their lives.”
Ron Weasley, Potter’s partner in the Aurors, sat in the front, along with his sister and several others from Hogwarts—Longbottom, Lovegood, Finnigan, Thomas. Order of the Phoenix members—Shacklebolt, who had not run for a second run at Minister; an assortment of Weasleys; McGonagall; even Dumbledore’s brother. The heroes of the war. The good guys.
“Right,” said Draco, his heart aching. Here was the reminder of something he couldn’t have. A proper friendship with Potter meant memories with him, memories that they both had, not just Draco.
It took about a week of almost a complete lack of proper sleep until Harry finally gave up and decided to talk to Hermione about it. He didn’t want to worry her, but he also knew that she was bound to notice how exhausted and moody he was becoming sooner or later, so there was really no point in avoiding it any longer.
“Well, you Gryffindors seem to be picking up the habit of calling every Slytherin you see a Death Eater. Might as well use it on the only one of us that actually was.”
could make him forget the moment Potter leaned over him on the sofa and sloppily pressed their lips together.
“Slow down, Potter,” Draco muttered, catching up to Potter as they stepped across the threshold into the house.
He lifted the cloth and leaned forward to look at Harry’s wing, his blond hair falling into his face. Harry took a moment to marvel at how different he looked with his hair loose and free instead of slicked back the way he had always worn it in school.
Waya, who had been observing Malfoy and Foxblade carefully, waved his hand at the desk and the boggart was forced back into its drawers. The class was silent. Everyone was staring at the Slytherins.
“Yes, I know. His portrait is in the Headmistress’s office. He gives lots of advice. The rumour is it was his idea to have everyone in our year housed together.”
“To be honest,” Harry sighed, thinking he may as well admit it. “Malfoy and I don’t exactly have the friendliest history.”
This felt chaotic.  Trying to think about his feelings for Draco gave him a knot in his stomach and the more he tried to make sense of it, the more tangled the knot became. He found it even started keeping him up late at night, his thoughts would start running in circles and he didn’t know how to calm himself down.
had a choice. Lucius Malfoy had been disgraced after the fiasco in the Department of Mysteries, and Harry knew that the task of killing Dumbledore had been given as penance, as no one had believed Malfoy was truly capable of it.
It had been two days and Harry had started to worry—at least, as much as he could worry with his brain being confined in the tiny body of a crow. His wing was feeling much better, he could flap it again, although he couldn’t quite fly yet.
As soon as Slughorn announced the name of the potion they were brewing, Draco’s heart sank. The old professor spoke with such excitement and vigour, but all Draco could think about was how much time it was going to take from him.
Draco sat near the back. It was amazing he was invited in the first place, even though he had been working at the Ministry for over two years now. Still, he wasn’t exactly high up, merely a clerk at the Improper Use of Magic Office.
“Oh, good, after you do that, remind her how much I adored that strawberry toffee she made for Violet’s birthday.”
The boggart started to form into a similar shape, but it wasn’t a cloaked shadowy figure, it was far more…human. And it was just about as tall as Harry was…with the same messy hair…and glasses. Was it his dad?
“Potter,” Draco said, in a clipped tone. He was standing up straight, his hands tucked into the pockets of his robes.
Slughorn was pointing out to the class the soft periwinkle colour of their potion and explaining Malfoy’s method of freezing the etharica, but Harry was still looking at Malfoy, even when Slughorn dispersed the crowd and instructed them to go back to their own potion.
Ever since the news of his and Ginny’s breakup had spread, Harry had been confronted on almost a daily basis by girls sneaking up on him in order to ask him out. He had started carrying his Invisibility Cloak around with him again and sweeping it over himself whenever he heard a group of girls approaching. It was becoming increasingly difficult, however, as some of them had figured out his schedule and would wait for him outside of his classes.
I pored over books on Dark Magic in the Manor all summer, trying to find something that would take it away.”
“Yes, well, Father’s in Azkaban, so I’m sure he’s got bigger things to worry about,” Draco had responded, still not making any moves to rise from his bed.
“Good for you,” he said, tersely. She reached out and put a hand over one of his, a move that caused him to freeze.
“Oi,” said Jones, narrowing her eyes at Potter. “Don’t you think just because the entire Ministry’s ready to kiss your arse, you can boss us around. We outnumber you.”
“He’s without his mother though,” Draco said, as the adolescent Thestral sat beside him and rested his head in his usual position in Draco’s lap.
“Mainly for all the times he called me a Mudblood. He also told me he was always jealous that I did better than him in classes. He went rather red at that.”
Draco felt another wave of guilt wash over him at the mention of Ollivander. He knew that Ollivander would certainly not be the one to mentor him, not after the ordeal he had suffered in the Manor’s dungeons. Draco just hoped that McGonagall would be able to find another good wandmaker that would be willing to teach him.
“I don’t know if they’re the right choice either. For Ravenclaw, that is. I suppose, to a certain extent, yes, they represent dignity, dedication, protection against danger, and again—remembering loved ones who have passed. But, more notably, they are symbols of cheerfulness and openness. They’re for the romantically adventurous, people looking for new experiences; creative, positive people.”
“Thank you, Granger,” Greengrass said, somewhat quietly, and Hermione gave her a smile, before returning to the window seat and the Ravenclaw boy. Greengrass pushed Zabini forward again, who revealed a rucksack he was carrying and began to pull bottles out of it. The room began to buzz again, with people leaning forward interestedly. Zabini placed all the bottles on a nearby tabled and Summoned several dozen goblets from the other side of the room.
hi guys, sorry for the late update, hope you enjoy it; it was one of my favorite chapters to write :)
Potter’s eyes didn’t leave Draco’s and, though he felt the strong urge to flinch, he didn’t look away. Finally, Potter gave a short chuckle.
He had moved into London last year, when he had taken over Ollivander’s, declaring that he wanted to be closer to work. While true, it hadn’t been the only reason. Returning to the Manor from Hogwarts had been difficult. His mother had truly outdone herself in the repairs and renovations, and the cold and maddening feeling of the remainders of Dark Magic had been removed. However, Draco had found that many prickly memories remained. He had once loved this house; had played in the gardens and run through the hallways, but too much had happened here. Too much had changed.
“No need to apologize, Mr Pickering. I find many students are largely unaware of the other major wizarding schools. Uagadou is actually the largest wizarding school of all, and the oldest as well. It’s located in western Uganda, and has a truly gifted student boy. I am very grateful for my time there.”
She spoke with an intense sort of affection in her voice and Draco thought inexplicably of his mother.
Harry was supremely grateful, and had made sure to already ask McGonagall and Waya for letters of recommendation so that he wouldn’t fall behind. All he had to concentrate on now was studying for his remaining N.E.W.T.s.
“I think the Ravenclaw Seeker is rather fit,” said Hermione, casually, shooting Harry a knowing look. He could have kissed her.
This seemed to surprise both of them. After a silence far too long to be natural, Granger picked up her wand from the table and smoothly Conjured a chair.
“Is…” Hermione hesitated, looking over at Ginny, who had chosen that moment to press a loud kiss onto Heidi’s cheek, causing the other girl to laugh and jokingly swat her away. “Is it hard? Seeing Ginny with someone else?”
was another headline, with a small photograph of Potter standing off to the side, looking tremendously uncomfortable, as Granger and Weasley embraced. It was probably from some recent Ministry event; those were the only times Potter willingly showed his face to the press.
Harry hesitated. He wanted to answer honestly, about the new Gryffindor Keeper—Simone Wexler, a girl in the same year as Ginny and a formidable force—but he feared his answer would be misconstrued, and the next article in the Daily Prophet would be about Harry dating his way through the Gryffindor Quidditch team.
The students did as they were told, rising from their seats and walking over to the Ravenclaw table. Harry, once seated, was glad to see some familiar faces. Susan Bones, whose long red hair had been cut and now stopped just short of her shoulders, gave him a warm smile when they made eye contact. Padma Patil had scurried over to sit beside her sister. But on the other side of Parvati, Lavender Brown was noticeably missing.
this year, no one was trying to kill him or his friends, the only things he had to worry about was his apprenticeships and his N.E.W.T.s, so
“No. The Ashwinder eggs need to steep in the rosewater for exactly thirty days, which is why the process usually takes that long, but Slughorn’s already done that for us.”
“Seventh years are being advised to start thinking about apprenticeships, too,” Lovegood said suddenly, breaking Draco out of his thoughts. She was staring at him with a knowing look in her eyes.
“That’s rather clever,” Draco said without thinking and then immediately felt himself flush with embarrassment. He was much better about acknowledging the ingenuity of Muggles these days, but there was still this part of him that instinctively felt peculiar when he spoke these thoughts aloud.
Theo had then insisted they stop at Honeydukes, which Draco rolled his eyes at, but he ended up finding a glass case of sugared violets that he was sure his mother would love and even bought a few Chocolate Frogs for himself. Theo, who had more than a single sweet tooth, practically had to be dragged out, carrying a rather large bag of various chocolates and sweets.
“Thank you,” he said gently, and she smiled at him in response. A thought occurred to him as he mulled over her words and he paused before voicing it.
He knew it wouldn’t have been a typical Christmas like the ones he’d had as a child, what without Lucius at the head of the table and only two elves left to prepare the meal, but nonetheless, Draco felt down at the prospect of missing it. He had never spent Christmas at Hogwarts—in fact, he had mercilessly mocked the students that did, loudly proclaiming that they had had no one who wanted them back home.
Instead, he focused back on Professor Fiona Ramirez, who was seated again, but still looking at the students with a merry grin on her face. Harry decided he liked her.
No one had seen it in a long time. In fact, the only one who had seen it since Draco had taken a knife to his skin had been Polkey, who had caught him in the act.
He braced himself for Potter to shoot him down, for him to get up and demand Draco leave his house. But Potter just leaned his elbows on his knees and rubbed his hands over his face.
“Hey Harry!” Dennis greeted him. “Please don’t hug Ginny right now, the lighting is falling perfectly and I don’t want her to mess it up.”
“Bugger, he must have already gone,” said Ron, quickly reaching for his pumpkin juice and glugging down as much as possible before letting out a hollow belch. “See you later!”
Draco looked away just as quickly. He didn’t know how this happened so often, how easily Potter got him into these emotional conversations that normally he would stay miles away from.
“I know! Honestly, I wish more people were as curious as you. The wizarding world is so ignorant on all things Muggle, they think they’re all quaint and stupid, but the fact that they’ve done so much
“Okay, so the main idea here is that energy always exists, right?” He was leaning so close to the table that he kept having to push his shoulder-length hair back behind his ears. “You can’t create new energy or destroy it, you can only change its form. That idea is called the law of conservation of energy. It’s a little more complicated, but that’s the gist of it. Muggles classify different forms or types of energy and how they can go through transformations; so, for instance, there’s sound energy, which of course relates to sound and vibrations, and there’s thermal energy, which is in essence just heat. The way Muggles explain it is that thermal energy comes from a rise in temperature, which causes an object’s atoms to vibrate at a higher frequency and—” he took a look at Draco’s face and paused. “Okay, you have no idea what I’m saying.”
“I suppose they’ll tell us when we get there,” he said instead, and the others nodded, seeming to take this as the end of this particular conversation.
“Because I’d like to,” he said. “I liked listening to you talk, about your books and your job and stuff. I like how you laugh, and your Muggle notebook and the fact that you make candied walnuts. And now, I can even respond.”
after all, the Forbidden Forest, and any sort of creature could come barrelling into the clearing at any moment. Draco began making a mental list of what spells he could use that wouldn’t be questioned at his probationary hearing this coming July.
Draco knew he couldn’t tell Potter the truth about how he felt. He knew that Potter would run at the first sign of feelings. Righteous and self-sacrificial as he was, Potter would be wracked with guilt, as though it was his fault Draco had fallen arse over tit for him. He would convince himself that he had manipulated Draco or forced him into something. He was irritating like that, always sure he was to blame for everything. He wasn’t looking for a real relationship, Draco knew that. He had said it before, unknowingly shattering Draco’s heart as he did so. If he was honest with himself, Draco knew that even if Potter was ready for a relationship, it wouldn’t be with Draco.
He’d been a coward, like he always was. He’d spent his whole life talking a big game, and it turned out he hated everything he’d bragged about—hated the Dark Arts, hated performing Unforgivable Curses, hated hurting people.
Harry stripped in the dressing room, quickly pulling his jeans and t-shirt back on, feeling a bit safer in the comfort of his Muggle clothes. He breathed in heavily, trying to calm the shakiness emanating throughout his whole body.
Just like that, the discomfort and heaviness of the past conversation was gone. Potter easily slid back into game commentary and Draco tried not to think about what it would have been like to have Potter as a roommate down in the Slytherin dormitories.
And that, more than anything, made him feel like a failure. Was he now so pathetic that even Malfoy was feeling bad for him? Was he truly so incapable that he had to be treated so delicately, like he might explode at any minute?
“Potter,” he said, slowly. “Do you mean to tell me that the concept of bisexuality is foreign to you?”
“Potter, if I got angry every time you got the credit for other people’s work I would have exploded by now.”
He sighed as he reached Slughorn’s quarters. He had never been chosen as one of Slughorn’s special favourites and, while that used to bother him to no end, he found that now he couldn’t bring himself to care. He had no desire to be special anymore, he just wanted to get by unharmed.
Harry watched him. He hadn’t heard much about what Malfoy had been up to, not since the trials and that had been more than a year ago. But despite walking away from Azkaban, Malfoy couldn’t have been welcomed into the open arms of society.
Weasley didn’t seem to have a response to this, so instead she gestured for Luna to get up and leave with them. Draco was uncomfortably aware of Potter’s eyes on him. Luna got to her feet, still smiling at Draco.
He still had dreams of this night. Nightmares, rather. He could still see Dumbledore’s face when he closed his eyes, wrinkled and worn-looking. He had looked so frail. But his eyes had still been kind, had looked at Draco searchingly, and Draco had felt so raw, so bare, so
It was his second year being fully and independently in charge of Ollivander’s now. Most of the year was quite peaceful, and he was able to dedicate a majority of his time towards research and crafting new wands, with only the occasional customer dropping in for a purchase. Late summer was the busiest time, with an influx of new and returning Hogwarts students flooding the streets, first-years purchasing their first wands and a handful of older students bashfully admitting they had either broken or lost theirs. Christmastime was also somewhat demanding, but far more manageable. Thank Merlin for small mercies.
“I just—I figured that—I—” he paused, and sighed. “I have a map. Of the castle. It shows me where people are.”
“Could you not find him?” he asked Elpis, though he heavily doubted it. He had had Elpis since he was eleven years old and she had never been unable to find a recipient before. Elpis hooted indignantly and pecked at Draco’s finger.
He was finding Muggle botany rather fascinating. It was a subject he never thought he’d be interested in, although that was more to do with the Muggle part than anything else. The Muggles were far more symbolic about it, as many of the flowers served no other purpose to them to look beautiful and smell fragrant. There was something special about that, about them ascribing meanings based on nothing other than the emotions the flowers invoked.
It was a strange feeling, not having anything urgent to take care of, and something he was still getting used to, despite years of a generally calm and quiet life. His first year out of Hogwarts, he had started as a trainee at Keswary. He had still been receiving regular instruction from Waya, his old Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, Flooing into Hogsmeade and walking up to Hogwarts grounds. Life was still somewhat stressful, although of course the stress of Advanced Defence training and the study of education didn’t exactly compare to the stress of an evil wizard trying to kill you and everyone you love.
The feeling was indescribable, and every single time, Draco couldn’t help but think how he would completely fall to pieces once Potter decided he had had enough.
“When would I have done that, Violet? When my father was carted off to Azkaban the first time? When I was tasked with the mission of assassinating the Headmaster by the most evil wizard who ever lived? During the
“Please, everyone knows about that. Nadine spread it across the entire House. She and Romilda had a bet over whether or not it would work. Of course, Nadine only won on a technicality.”
Draco stared at her as if suddenly realising she was there. Laurel and Astoria also looked rather confused. Astoria, of course, knew to whom they were referring to, but also didn’t quite
“They didn’t die for you, Potter,” Draco found himself saying. “They died for what they believed in. Whether it was peace between Muggles and wizards, or that the Dark—Voldemort was an evil bastard, or revenge, or justice, or even if they believed in the mystical heroism of Harry Potter, they didn’t die
With a deep breath, he unclenched his hand and withdrew the wand from his pocket before sitting down by the window. He twirled the wand between both of his hands, observing the way the light bounced off of the shining wood. A long fifteen inches, Draco still wasn’t used to the way it fit in his hand.
“I don’t think you’re a mammal,” said Hermione once, her eyebrows furrowed by thought. “Non-mammals are much harder to transform into, because of course there are more differences between them and humans.”
invasive, isn’t it? Knowing someone can hear your thoughts and never knowing which ones they hear. And you are a famous and powerful person, it must be intimidating.”
Okay, that's all I've got! Chapter title is from Life of the Party by All Time Low and this chap's moodboard is our lovely Draco. Enjoy!
become an Auror with you, but then insisted he didn’t want to be your partner? He worked as an Auror just like you, but refused to be working
not spending as much time with Draco. He hadn’t realized when he had become so used to the other boy’s company and now that it was suddenly gone, he found himself
“I don’t know, honestly. Ashworth suggested it, and it just sort of…made sense,” Harry said, truthfully.
” Granger interrupted loudly, shooting Weasley a sharp look and then turning back to Draco. “The moon landing, what do you want to know?”
“The door is just over there, Potter,” said Malfoy, gesturing to the front door at the other end of the room.
Everyone was watching them now, mostly silent, aside from a few girls sitting by one of the table, who were whispering amongst themselves. Ernie Macmillan had sprung forward to meet them at the bottom of the stairs.
“Ah, yes, the Romilda Vane incident of sixth year,” Sophie nodded, wisely. The three of them stared at her.
“I don’t know,” Harry said, honestly. “It came out of nowhere. We had written a few letters back and forth, and then I got one from him that was suddenly very…clipped and short and he ended it by saying this would be the ‘last letter of our correspondence’. I tried to write back and ask him what he was on about, but everything I sent after that kept coming back unopened. Eventually I just gave up.”
Harry thought to himself. He took a deep breath, not bothering to mention that dandelions weren’t technically an herb and that he had never cooked with them before and had no idea what to do with them.
However, Astoria never actually tried to chat Theo up, because she adored Cordelia and was far too respectful of her to shamelessly flirt with her boyfriend in front of her.
“It’s just Potions,” Harry shrugged. “Malfoy does all the work anyway. I wouldn’t be much help to him like this anyway.”
“On one condition, though,” he said, sternly, after she let out a squeal and wrapped her arms around him in an almost painful hug.
“I’m sorry,” he finally said, trying to ignore how Malfoy’s eyebrows shot up in surprise. “Can I just call you Draco?”
“I know,” Potter said. He would, seeing as his Invisibility Cloak was one of those ways. Potter began to venture further into the house, and Draco followed, feeling the sweat on his palm as he gripped harder onto his wand.
The Slytherins looked like they hadn’t expected this victory, given the surprised expressions they sported.
Draco certainly wasn’t the best at recognizing emotions—especially not his own—but he liked to think he was reasonably sharp and observant. Observant enough to notice that, although Violet’s eyes were fixed on her book, they were unmoving, and she hadn’t turned a page in over five minutes.
Harry wondered if he could ask McGonagall about it, if she’d tell him anything, maybe that it was a cover for something, perhaps something to do with the terms of Malfoy’s probation. That would make sense. That would also explain why Malfoy had gotten so tetchy when Harry had asked about it.
Malfoy looked at him with those intense silvery eyes as if appraising him, and Harry was just about to start squirming under his gaze when Malfoy gave him a short nod and turned his attention back to their potion.
“Yeah,” said Harry, trying not to seem overly eager just because Draco had asked a question. “She’s great, really, dunno where I’d be without her. She thinks I work too much.”
Hermione looked like she was going to say something more, but was interrupted by the loud sound of the bricks of the entrance to the common room opening. Dean and Seamus walked through, followed closely by an interested-looking Luna and a grinning Ginny.
“We’ll be starting off with something a little simpler to get you back into the rhythm of things,” Slughorn announced, rising from his chair with what seemed like considerable effort and pointing his wand at the blackboard. “However, don’t get lazy! This potion will require constant supervision in order to achieve the desired result.”
“Tomorrow, the bulletin board in your common room will announce the names of every student’s mentor, the weekly times they will meet, and the classroom in which they will have their sessions. Now, because wandlore is a heavily protected magic, it would be best if the other students did not know what you were studying. You may tell one or two of your most trusted friends, but you must make sure it stays quiet. You don’t want to attract unwanted attention.”
Draco was always careful walking around hallways—he had to be. There was often a Stinging Hex or Trip Jinx waiting for him around the corner. It hadn’t been unexpected, even when he first arrived. Maybe especially when he first arrived. He had been a Death Eater, of course there would be people seeking revenge. He knew Daphne and Theo had also encountered a few hexes here and there, from people who mistakenly thought their families had been Death Eater sympathizers, but nowhere near the level of Draco.
He had tried to make sense of it, because that’s what he was good at. He was good at analysing, at figuring out the logic behind people’s actions, but things always got messier when emotions were involved. He told himself it was the power, that Lucius felt weak and out of control and needed to assert his dominance over something. Draco could understand that. He could even relate—the loss of control in his own life led him to be capable of things he never thought he could be.
exactly. It wasn’t bad at all actually. The advertising manager that served as his contact at Northstar turned out to be Demelza Robins, a former Gryffindor who had flown with him when he was Quidditch Captain during his sixth year, and he had been happy to see someone familiar in the intimidating official offices of Northstar.
“And when it’s someone they claim to care about? A pureblood? When it’s someone they’re meant to prote—respect?” The words were coming out automatically again, tumbling out of his mouth before he could stop them, and he stumbled to try and repair his slip of the tongue, but it was too late.
As usual, he had been right. The beginning had been tough, and he had overheard many people wondering out loud if Ollivander had “lost his rocker” hiring an ex-Death Eater, but over time these conversations grew less and less frequent, and people got used to him being around. He had even become somewhat friendly with some of the other workers and owners of neighbouring shops.
This information would have to be unpacked at another time. Harry jabbed his feathers at the quill again. Merlin, this was so much easier with
“What about Transfiguration?” McGonagall went on. “I seem to recall you did rather well in my classes as well.”
“Outstanding job, my boy, simply outstanding,” Ollivander was saying, but Draco was far too distracted by the wand he held in his hands. It wasn’t a particularly handsome wand, but it was a
“Mhm, no, I think I’ll have something stronger. The prickly pear black tea sounds good, I think. And tell Sabrina to send over whatever she recommends today.”
“Well, I…yes, of course,” Draco said, trying not to let his unease show. Potter smirked and shoved at him lightly, leading the way into the house.
“I didn’t mean it like that,” Harry amended. “I just—you were—she was scared and you were really good at talking her through it. It was impressive. You were impressive.”
Draco’s face was burning as he placed the top over the cauldron and carefully removed it from the flame.
Maybe Draco was just very focused on his apprenticeship. He wasn’t allowed to tell Harry much about what he learned, but Harry already knew that wandlore was an old and complex form of magic, so he imagined there were a lot of challenging aspects that took a lot of attention and concentration to properly learn.
Draco wanted to roll his eyes again, but refrained. If he rolled his eyes every time he was tempted to around Potter, he would have a constant headache.
“What?” Potter said, distractedly, chewing on his bottom lip in worry as Ravenclaw scored another goal. “Oh, blimey, no. Hogwarts wouldn’t hire me right out of an apprenticeship, Chosen One be damned. Ashworth recommended I start at local day schools, maybe even magical preparatory schools for children under eleven.”
The season of Hogwarts students shopping for the new year had officially passed, with only a few late stragglers remaining. This would normally mean a calmer and less stressful time for Draco, however unfortunately, this was not the case.
“I know,” said Harry. “Can you believe he’s learning about Muggles from his friend, that Foxblade girl?”
“No,” she said, sharply. “I painted myself. It was one of the only things I was allowed to do—paint.”
Harry groaned slightly, and Hermione snickered, casting a Cleaning Charm on her quills. A slight tapping interrupted them, and Harry looked over to see an owl waiting outside the window.
“Damn,” Potter said, letting out a sigh. He turned his head to look at Draco. Trying not to tremble, Draco met his eyes.
no tomorrow morning, not for me. When I wake up, neither of you are going to remember this. It’s going to be April 10
“Yes, sir,” he said, in his most polite tone of voice. Slughorn looked at the potion once again, from which steam was rising in perfect, characteristic spirals, and then back to Draco.
He needed to distract himself. What he really wanted was to go out into his garden. He didn’t even have anything ready for harvest, but it relaxed him, pulling weeds and planting seeds, smelling the fresh earth, even the dirt caking up under his fingernails. But it was past sunset, and it was a rather chilly night, so Harry sat, fidgety, at his kitchen table. Once he started to feel itchy in his seat, he got up to put on a pot of tea.
After bidding goodbye to Theo, Draco walked back through the curtain to the front of the shop. Willa was busy with a customer, so Draco just sent her a little wave before ducking out of the store and heading back north towards Ollivander’s.
“I don’t know!” Harry exclaimed, and Nadine Bellmore looked up at him from the table beside theirs in shock at the sound. He murmured a quick apology to her and lowered his voice. “I guess I just…I didn’t know you could do that. I didn’t know you could be interested in women
“Furthermore, as you are all of age, you are permitted to visit the village of Hogsmeade on all weekends, not only on supervised trips. Know that this is a
They stood there, silent and awkward. Draco didn’t know what to say. He didn’t know where all of that had come from, but once he had started talking, it had all just come spilling out.
Seemingly by accident, he started to realise that Potter didn’t enjoy his job. He seemed eager for the distraction when Draco came in, and sorry to see him go when Draco left. As Draco watched him in the canteen, he soon noticed that the smile Potter put on, when people came up to congratulate him and the rest of the Aurors for their big arrests, was fake, and not even particularly convincingly so—not when Draco was really looking. Draco enjoyed their conversations, even though Potter couldn’t remember them the next day, even when Potter unknowingly repeated himself.
“You were Snape’s golden child. Everyone knows you were best at Potions.” After a slight cough from behind him, he added, “Besides Hermione.”
“Do I think she would mind if Harry Potter expressed interest in supporting her proposal? Of course not, Potter, she would be chuffed to bits.”
“He’ll kill you,” Claudia whispered, her eyes filling with tears. “If he finds out you’re here, he’ll kill you.”
“Say you could do anything you wanted, anything at all—at least within the confines of one day—and the next day you would wake up and it would be as if none of it had ever happened. What would you do?”
“Dobbs sees it!” Draco hissed, and sure enough, the Slytherin Seeker had her eyes on the Snitch and began to speed towards it. Just as she did, the Ravenclaw Seeker—who had been watching her—sped off in the same direction.
Without so much as another word, the students all obediently shuffled towards their respective staircases.
“If you don’t mind putting your wand away for a moment, could you demonstrate the wandless spells you are able to perform?”
The kitchen was primarily Harry’s domain, as Hermione had never become much of a cook. She joked that after having been responsible for their meals while they were out hunting Horcruxes, any appeal it had had completely vanished. Harry, on the other hand, found that he quite enjoyed it.
“Nothing exciting,” Theo snorted. “There’s some sort of stomach bug going around, we’ve been selling out of our Stomach Soothing Tinctures, so I’m making more batches.”
But nothing had exploded when he took the wand, so he’d paid five Galleons—an absurd price for a wand of such shabby quality—and left as quickly as he could. Once he had gotten home, he tested a few simple spells with his new wand, and it wasn’t entirely useless. It handled basic charms alright, but it wasn’t
“Oh, it’s been wonderful!” she exclaimed. “Peter even said he was going to take my proposals to his boss.”
Filch and Mrs Norris continued to patrol the halls at night in hopes of finding a student to punish; Hagrid would be raising some strange and likely horrific animal down by his hut; students would sneak off to the Astronomy Tower to snog after hours; and Ron would continue to have seconds at every meal.
“Huh? Why?” Harry asked, feeling disoriented, as he tried to refocus on the conversation at hand and dismiss the memories swirling around in his head.
“Snape tried to teach me in fifth year,” Potter countered, and Draco actually paused, as this was new information.
Parvati had been the Head Writer for the Style and Fashion column in the Daily Prophet for the past two years and had done quite well for herself, but—as she breathlessly informed Harry after he had given her his final approval on the article and she had submitted it to her editors—her interview with Harry was her first piece to make it to the front page.
“Are you alright?” Draco asked. It hadn’t been what he had planned on started with, but Potter looked so drained that it spilled out of his mouth nonetheless.
“Of course,” he said, somewhat resigned. He had never thought he would be this kind of person, the kind of person who willingly sacrificed his time and effort to help a friend, but he found himself
“She’s in Potions with us,” Theo said, confirming Draco’s deduction. “Tiny little thing, isn’t she?”
Did Potter really think him above Unforgivables? Violet, Luna, Ollivander, they all seemed to believe he was hiding some heart of gold under all of his abysmal decisions, but Potter had seen him, Potter knew first-hand how cruel Draco could be, how little humanity he treated people with.
“I followed your trial in the papers,” she said quietly, so that only Draco could hear. “Are you back in school then?”
“Thank you, sir,” Draco said, carefully, taking a seat across from him on the edge of a dark orange loveseat.
Potter seemed to realise that this was difficult for Draco, so he waited patiently for Draco to find the words. What came out wasn’t exactly what Draco had intended.
“What?” Harry hissed and followed Ron’s eye line to find—sure enough—Draco Malfoy. He was seated in between Blaise Zabini and Theodore Nott, however while the two of them were engaged in conversation, he sat hunched over the table, his hands crossed and his eyes looking down.
“We’re studying wand ownership, and the case of the hawthorn wand was brought up. You don’t have to give it back to me, I just need to test it. You can be there while I do, if you wish.”
“Merlin, this is insane,” said Malfoy, finishing up at the bottom of the page. “Alright, spell something out for me.”
“Harry and I broke in when we were fifteen, I’m sure we’ll be quite alright,” said Granger, already getting up from her desk. Potter stood as well, seeming to have to problem with the prospect of breaking into a highly secretive Ministry department.
Draco approached them, quietly at first, but then clearing his throat to make his presence known. He had a habit of sneaking up on people, not necessarily on purpose. He had always had a quiet way about him, something his mother liked to describe as his
But there were other times when Harry wasn’t sure how much he could say or what was okay to mention. He and Draco had never had a proper conversation about boundaries, about what was an acceptable topic. Whenever the subject of the war was brought up, the conversation shifted, often into one that was dark or miserable, and Harry could feel that they both became somewhat tentative, choosing their words carefully.
“We were together for a short time,” he said. “After three or four months, we realised that ultimately, we were not compatible together. He wanted a future with someone, something I could not give him.”
“No, I imagine he’s not,” said Draco. Gabriel Whitewater was one of the greatest Potioneers alive. Even Snape—who had always been notoriously hard to impress—spoke of him with great respect. Draco had been amazed McGonagall had gotten him to agree to mentor a student at all.
Ron and Hermione sat there, seemingly at a loss for what to say. Harry breathed heavily, the strange sensation of feeling someone else’s sadness slowly trickling away.
gotten an O in his Defence O.W.L and even made it into N.E.W.T level Potions. McGonagall had had confidence in him, and she was not a woman easily impressed.
He didn’t like cursing people without wands. He was taught proper duelling techniques growing up, taught its importance in ancient pureblood tradition. Attacking someone who didn’t have a wand to defend themselves didn’t feel
He felt exhausted. He had no reason to be; N.E.W.T.s were over, classes were wrapping up, he was even sleeping at night, but nonetheless, he felt completely drained. His body was sore everywhere and he felt himself get out of breath with no cause. It had been
“Yeah,” Ron agreed, looking off into space. “So Auror training. Wonder what it’ll be like. I mean, I suppose it’s not the same as the official Auror training, but still. Maybe it’ll give us a leg-up when we actually do apply.”
—and putting it back into her book bag. “But I’m the only person you talk to about Muggles and I’m not even from a Muggle family. If you’re genuinely interested, and I think you are, it’d be good for you to talk to people who actually grew up around Muggles.”
“Do you think,” he kept his voice low, even though he knew no one was listening, “you could maybe tell me some of what you learn in your Muggle Studies class?”
“They left us the Manor, but only because they couldn’t figure out how to dismantle the blood wards; they’re centuries-old. No one will hire me, of course. Even if someone
Both Potter and Granger looked stunned once again. Granger, as expected, gained her composure first.
“Er…no, not really,” Harry replied honestly, giving the hawthorn wand back to Draco, who seemed so excited he didn’t even take the opportunity to insult Harry’s intelligence.
“Yeah,” she sighed. “We’ll practice more next session. In the meantime, don’t practice on your own. You need to have either Ron or me there to perform the spell in case you can’t transform back, okay?”
“During the Battle of Hogwarts,” he went on. He made eye contact with Laurel, and surprisingly, found that it calmed him. It was self-centred and would sound horrendous to anyone that didn’t know them, but his friendship with Laurel sometimes helped reduce his guilt. It reminded him that he wasn’t the same person he had been during the war.
As he got closer, he realized that the figure was actually Daphne, her golden hair tied up in a lax ponytail and her Slytherin scarf draped around her neck loosely. She was leaning over someone, and speaking in a low and soothing tone.
“You do that, Potter,” Draco smirked, and sat back as Harry hurried to the supply closet. The pygmy blossom seeds took a moment to find, as they were in an extraordinarily small jar, however Harry retrieved them and turned to walk back to their desk, where now, Theodore Nott, chatting with Draco.
with Potter and Weasley,” said Daphne, impatiently. “Honestly, Violet, how do you put up with him every day?”
It was all too complicated. Yes, of course he had been under pressure, of course he had been threatened, of course he had been worried about his parents. But it had been
“That was brilliant, Draco,” Potter said from the ground, his breath coming out in quick, heavy pants.
Arriving back at Hogwarts still gave Harry the feeling of coming home, but it also had him feeling somewhat nervous. He had sent Malfoy an owl asking if they could have their first session the week term began again and had received a brief response in perfect cursive:
“Sometimes I see him and he’s…he’s hurting people, but I can’t move, I can’t help. It’s like I’m paralyzed in my body and I can’t do anything but watch as he tortures people. Over and over again. And they’re people he never…I see Sirius, all the time,” he feels an overwhelming urge to scream, to yell, to throw something, but more than anything else, he wants to cry. “And Remus and Tonks and Fred and you and Ron and Dumbledore and…and even Sophie and Neville and Malfoy and Ginny and…”
“’Course,” said Ron, easily. “Auror training won’t be as fun without you there, but you sound really chuffed about this. ‘Mione’s right, too, you know. You’d be a good professor. I learned loads from you in fifth year.”
Harry didn’t know how Hermione felt about Waya’s casual nature, but he himself was starting to like him. He reminded him, Harry realized with a pang in his heart, of Remus.
“Each major magical school has a variation of this; in Hogwarts, it’s called the Book of Admittance, written by the Quill of Acceptance. It records every time a witch or wizard in Britain or Ireland first exhibits sufficient signs of magic, which is usually before the child turns three, though in rare occasions it can take longer than that. That’s how they know who to send Hogwarts letters to. And typically the Headmaster or someone in his place will go to explain the situation to Muggleborns’ families, but if they know their names from such a young age, there’s no reason why we can’t introduce it to them far earlier.”
Draco had seen her family name—Foxblade—in a book about pureblood genealogy that he’d found in the Manor once, but it was an old book and hadn’t even included Lucius’s generation, let alone Draco’s. The Foxblades hadn’t been among the Death Eaters, nor any of the Dark Lord’s known supporters. Draco supposed, like the Notts and Greengrasses, they had remained hidden and neutral during the war.
“Oh, she’s well, thank you,” Draco replied. “She’s gotten back in touch with her sister, which I think has made her much happier lately.”
“Harry, his father is in Azkaban and his mother is on house arrest. They’ve had Aurors in and out of their house all summer. Practically none of his friends returned to Hogwarts this year. Maybe schoolwork isn’t the first thing on his mind right now.”
It was a rather intense game, as the Hufflepuff Chasers were formidable, but the new Gryffindor Keeper was very quick.
strange and Harry would be bewildered as to what to do about it. It often had something to do with food, and Harry had deduced that Kreacher was trying to
witches and wizards. They claimed that if the participants knew about the experiment, it could affect its academic integrity. Well, of course, I denied their request, it was completely unethical, and I told you about it, Harry, because it was so preposterous and I was
“Are you so starved for affection you feel the need to live through my exploits?” Draco asked, looking down at his suddenly-full glass of wine.
Draco stretched out in his bed and sat up, feeling warm. He allowed himself a minute to wake up fully and get his brain working properly before drawing his bedcurtains and hopping out of bed. He washed up and dressed quickly, finding himself excited to get to breakfast. He supposed it was simply a force of habit, it was as if his body knew it was Christmas Day and started preparing him for it.
“Well, I’m sure there’s something else you could do,” he said, dismissively, and Draco found himself bristling at how casually Slughorn was taking this. He knew that he had scoffed at the idea of having any sort of future himself, but it felt very different when someone else—a professor, at that—was doing it.
“Money, which I know you don’t care about,” she said, rolling her eyes. “Basically, you’d represent them and advertise for them by wearing their clothing and using their equipment, which they will give you for free. The original contract is for a year, but depending on how happy you are with them and vice versa, they might extend it. If you end up staying with them long term, you might even have a say in your own line of gear.”
He found that this father’s face joined the Dark Lord’s in his nightmares sometimes, however, and in the beginning of the year, when the boggart had appeared in Lucius’s shape, he had to confront the truth.
And, well, if Theo was rather good-looking as well, it wasn’t Draco’s fault he felt that little flutter. That flutter was a purely physical reaction that had nothing to do with Draco’s thoughts or desires. Draco didn’t
“Is this about Violet?” he asked, in a gentle voice. Daphne’s head snapped up, her big blue eyes suddenly looking terrified.
He looked even better entering Hogwarts, after what was clearly a summer full of the Weasley matriarch’s cooking—strong and serious, his disastrous hair looking more like it was wind-swept than just a bad case of bedhead. He still had his terrible round-framed glasses and his awkward, lopsided smile, and a bad, hunching posture when he sat, but Draco couldn’t deny it to himself—Potter was
Draco was struck once again by the generosity and kindness of his mentor and felt another surge of gratitude at the opportunity he was given to work with the man.
He had told Hermione he was able to cast a Stunning Spell wandlessly and nonverbally just the other day and she had gasped and gushed over how technically challenging and difficult that was. Meanwhile, Ron had grinned and joked that he hoped Harry wouldn’t be practicing on him any time toon.
“Could I—do you think…” Draco stumbled, not sure how to phrase his question without sounding like he was pleading for it. “Would it be possible for me to take a look at it?”
His call was met by a tableful of cheers, and Harry made eye contact with Neville, who offered him a shrug and a small smile, which Harry returned.
He had the poor bloke’s blood and viscera and intestines all over his robes. I’d take garlic breath any day.”
“Honestly, Harry, you can ask them to leave you alone,” Hermione tutted as he pulled off his Cloak in the Transfiguration classroom.
“I wouldn’t say I’ve taken over,” he said, instead. “I like to think I’m continuing Ollivander’s work.”
“Oh, Draco, I’m sorry, I…” he trailed off, seeming to be at a loss for what to say. Draco’s body was still unmoving and he felt his pulse quicken. He couldn’t identify his emotions; they were coming at him too fast. He knew there was guilt—there was always guilt. Remorse. Regret. Anger.
“The war was…Everyone suffered. And people have lost far more than I have, but…not everyone felt that
He arrived at breakfast a little bit late, so Theo was already seated and eating when he got to the Great Hall, and Draco walked over to sit across from him. Theo greeted him warmly, and immediately insisted he have some pigs in a blanket, despite his preference of avoiding heavy foods in the mornings.
There was something pathological about it—this obsession he had. He didn’t know how to exist without strong feelings for Potter—he had had them for as long as he could remember. He often thought it was far easier when he hated him.
The snake was coiled up on the ground, but it had lifted its head at their arrival, eyes unnaturally shining. Draco felt his heart thumping erratically against his chest, feeling like it was moving higher and higher, into his throat, until he felt like he had to swallow it down. The snake’s eyes seemed to be singularly focused on him, unblinking, and it reared back as though preparing to strike, when a sharp hiss seemed to stop it in its tracks.
“That makes sense,” Theo nodded, and Draco felt himself release a small breath of relief. It was odd, this feeling—how uncomfortable he suddenly felt at telling even the most insignificant of lies. He’d never had a problem with it before, smoothly lying without a problem to get himself in or out of any situation, as necessary.
As if the process itself wasn’t difficult enough, approval for Animagus applications was hard to come by. Each application had to be reviewed and signed by the Minister himself. Hermione was a shoo-in, of course, and as an Auror, Ron had excellent reason for applying, as an animal disguise could prove to be an asset, depending on what animal it was, of course. Harry, on the other hand, felt like there was no way Kingsley would approve his application, Chosen One be damned.
one. He felt some sort of responsibility for every death of an innocent that had occurred during the war, as if it was somehow his fault that Voldemort and the Death Eaters were terrorizing people. Especially those who had died during the Battle of Hogwarts, it seemed like Potter carried their deaths upon his shoulders, letting the overwhelming guilt weigh him down constantly. Draco had tried to tell him it wasn’t his fault—albeit in a snarky, condescending way, implying that Potter was making everything all about him—but Potter had just shaken his head slowly, like Draco couldn’t possibly understand, which of course made
Draco had blinked at him, surprise probably written all over his face, but he’d made a valiant effort at recovery.
Harry cast a glance over to the Slytherin table, easily finding Malfoy’s pale hair among the crowd. He was sitting next to his friend, Foxblade, and he was smiling at her—a genuine smile—and Harry saw, with an unexpected jolt in his stomach, that for the first time he could remember this year, the sleeves of his robe were rolled up.
The Greengrass girl went first, telling Waya her name at his request—Daphne. She had a hard expression on her face and didn’t shake one bit when she raised her wand and approached the boggart.
“Slughorn tried his best to keep it normal, but everything was so mad and hopeless. He just sort of let us keep making Calming Draughts and simple Healing Potions to slip to the younger students. Didn’t really learn much.”
Draco woke to a familiar tapping sound. He grumbled into his pillow, feeling as though he hadn’t slept a wink. The tapping continued, growing louder.
“Know thine enemy, Harry,” said Hermione, meaningfully, and Harry just rolled his eyes, but as the owl flew back out the window, he unrolled the newspaper all the same and the enormous headline took him aback.
Harry liked to keep busy. He liked to be productive, he liked to know he was helping, he was contributing, he was
Malfoy aimed his wand at him, and Harry had the fleeting thought of how strange it was to feel so relaxed with Malfoy’s wand pointed right at him before Malfoy cast.
Draco had never behaved so out of sorts with a professor before, had never lost control of his temper, or had an outburst, or stuttered as much as he had today, so he couldn’t help but think,
But Draco had continued to feel slightly uneasy, as though there was a constant chill up his arms he could never shake off. Much as he loved his mother, he had been glad to have the excuse of his work to move out.
Harry had been avoiding phrasing it like that, for fear of cementing the resemblance to having Voldemort’s thoughts invading his mind, but he had to admit it was a similar sensation—although, he should acknowledge, not painful the way Voldemort’s were, nor as frightening.
“Are you feeling alright?” Draco murmured, tracing a finger over Potter’s shoulder. Potter nodded slowly.
“That was only one time!” cried Harry, defensively, but Ron was grinning at him, clearly taking the piss.
“Fuck off,” said Potter, tossing his cigarette onto the ground and crushing it with his dragonhide boot. He looked up at Draco and held out a hand. “Apparate us?”
Harry looked up, and sure enough, Slughorn was walking around inspecting the tables, heading in their direction. He sat up a bit in his seat and Malfoy snorted.
Just a minute ago, Harry had been cutting the Biting Nettle and Malfoy had looked at the plant, then looked up at Harry, and said, in a patient but somewhat tired voice, “Potter, what is that you’re cutting?”
Suddenly everyone was laughing—genuine and absolutely strange laughter. Even Draco couldn’t help but fall into it as Blaise chuckled by his side.
“Oh, er, Transfiguration,” Draco replied, still at a loss as to why she had decided to engage him in conversation. She looked at him and he resisted the urge to fidget uncomfortably under her stare. She didn’t seem to blink quite as often as most people.
Draco watched him, but Potter’s eyes remained on the flowers. Draco found it an odd thing to say; he never thought that Potter was especially close with any Hufflepuffs. None of his immediate group were Hufflepuffs, not that Draco knew of. He wanted desperately to know, but he knew Potter would clam up and disappear if he pried, so he contained his curiosity for the moment.
Draco felt a flush rise up in his neck, remembering the embarrassing experience of having to ask Granger about it in front of both Potter and Weasley.
Draco sighed quietly to himself. He started to wonder about Slytherins from younger years, would they want to come back? He supposed many of them would have no choice, but he was sure that at least some parents would choose to send their Slytherins to Beauxbatons or Durmstrang. He wouldn’t blame them. He did not expect any returning Slytherins to be met with welcoming arms, even those who didn’t bear the shame of being related to a Death Eater.
“Do come sit up front, please,” McGonagall said, her voice sounding far more casual. She gestured to the side of the Ravenclaw table closest to the front of the room, and she herself got up and walked over to stand in front of it, her fellow professors following suit.
Draco sat with the letter for a long time, his chest deflating like a balloon more and more each time he read it. He didn’t know what Potter was trying to tell him. He wasn’t ‘able to love like that’? What did that even mean? The more times Draco read it over, the more certain he became that it was a rejection. Awkward as ever, Potter wanted to squash any notion of anything romantic between himself and Draco. Why else would he say that he stopped trying? He clearly didn’t want to be in any sort of relationship, he viewed it as forcing himself into something he wasn’t good at. Draco felt something rise in his throat at the thought that Potter might have felt as though Draco was
make everything difficult, Potter? Me? Tell me what potion we’re making. Go on,” Draco slammed the textbook shut as Potter’s eyes automatically moved to it. “That’s what I thought. Tell me the main difference between using pomegranate juice and lavender water as a base. The effect ginger root has in potions. How to withdraw a lionfish spine without spilling its venom. Can’t answer any, can you? But that’s fine, because
Various chatter filled the classroom, until Professor Ashworth cleared his throat firmly. The entire class fell silent, and Harry was rather impressed. Not all professors had the natural ability to silence a room like that.
Here it was. Here was the moment of truth, did he make up a lie or tell the truth, and risk one of his secrets being in Potter’s hands, for him to decide what to do with?
“Oh, you mean the party that you purposefully kept a secret from us so that we wouldn’t show up?” Greengrass said, making her voice louder so that everyone would hear.
They ate quietly, however the silence seemed to morph from something awkward to something more companionable as they chewed their pastries and sipped their tea.
“Go there—to the Department of Mysteries?” Draco asked, incredulously. “We can’t just go barging in there!”
After the trials—after they had hauled Lucius off—Draco had expected his mother to fall apart. He had expected to step into his role as the man of the house, as Lucius had always told him he would one day. He had been prepared to take care of his grieving mother and devote all of his energy and focus on her. She deserved that.
Draco felt a shiver down his spine and his arms that he knew the gentle warm spring weather wasn’t causing. He didn’t know why he had come up here anyway. It was a stupid idea, one he hadn’t thought through at all.
“Misery loves company, it seems,” Ron nodded glumly, not looking nearly as excited about his pancakes as he had a mere thirty seconds ago.
“He’s gone, Claudia. Hang in there a little longer, and I’ll file a request to have you officially placed somewhere. Where would you like to go?”
“You just went around tapping trees on the hunch that loose magic might have triggered an old fairy ring to reopen?”
“I would advise one drop into your pumpkin juice at dinner per night, and after two weeks I’d like you to come back and check in with me about how you’re feeling.”
Luckily, there was now tea and tart to occupy him, so Harry gratefully bit into his tart, and was happy to find it was just as tasty as it looked. He dared a glance up at Draco, who had what looked like a slice of carrot cake on his plate and a small fork in his hand.
about Muggles?” he said it with such disbelief that Draco was unsure whether to be offended or not. Then he remembered the countless times he had called Granger a ‘Mudblood’ and decided he didn’t have the right.
“You can’t seriously be this upset with me,” Potter exclaimed, his eyebrows scrunched together and his eyes looking bright and beseeching. Draco felt an ache pinch his heart, like a soft crack in a glass window.
it’s cold,” Draco muttered through gritted teeth, digging through a desk drawer in search of change. The owl dropped the Prophet on the desk and stood there, pouch tied to its talons, waiting.
Grey carpeting covered every inch of the floor, and the various armchairs and sofas that occupied the room were all black or a muted shade of grey. White lamps glittered with the appearance of stars, bouncing off the walls. Desks were tucked away under the staircases, and bowls of fruit sat on several end tables by the sofas. There were only a few spots of bright colour, made all the more noticeable by how monochromatic the rest of the room was.
“Good memory,” Waya said from the corner, where he’d been sitting silently until now. Harry grinned at him.
Draco stared at him. He was sure that Potter was aware, too, as he wasn’t being subtle, but Potter’s eyes remained on the pitch.
“Fetch the ingredients, would you, Potter?” Draco said, in a somewhat resigned voice. Whether this turned out to be an utter catastrophe, he supposed he would just have to wait and see. “And do
On the rich scarlet of the Gryffindor tapestry was a lion, its mane exploding around it and its mouth open in a growl. Golden writing spelled out,
He hadn’t told Luna that he was learning about Muggles with Violet, however the more time he spent with her, the more he realized that Luna often seemed to just
“Because nobody bothered to question the original recipe,” replied Draco, sneering at the textbook as though it had personally offended him. “However, if we were to add approximately two seeds instead of the fourteen petals, we would simply have a more efficient Finder’s Friend.”
“I’m glad to hear it,” the wandmaker said. “I was hoping you would accompany me at the store come July, as that is when I find myself busiest, in preparation for the new Hogwarts students who will be needing their first wands.”
Draco’s heart was pounding violently against his chest, but his voice remained cool and casual, and for that, he had to be grateful.
“I don’t know if swearing at an officer from the M.L.E.S. is really what constitutes wittiness, but cheers, Malfoy.”
However, it was when Slughorn reminded them on which potions were likely to be on their N.E.W.T.s that Draco realized Potter had absolutely no idea how to make any of them. Initially, he thought, well, that’s Potter’s problem, isn’t it? But then he started feeling somewhat guilty. Slughorn favoured Potter, there was no question about it, but even the Saviour of the Wizarding World couldn’t get away with passing a Potions N.E.W.T. without knowing how to draft a simple Pepper-Up.
But there was no taking back eighth year. Once Potter directed him with a genuine smile, it was over.
“Exactly,” Seamus said, in a serious tone. “The Ministry just uses Harry as its poster boy because of how devastatingly handsome he is.”
“You didn’t like them together?” Harry asked. He had never really figured out what Ginny’s opinion had been on Ron and Hermione as a couple.
When he could sleep, he did, because despite the nightmares, being conscious had felt even worse, as it left him alone with his thoughts far more than he would have liked, and his mind was not a place he felt safe in anymore.
“Magical tattoos are particular,” she began, her eyes looking up from his arm to his face once again. “Especially when imbued with Dark Magic.”
“Granger? I don’t suppose I could disturb you for a moment?” he used his most polite voice, the one his mother had taught him.
Draco was still sitting there staring at the flowers when the now-familiar sound of bricks clattering open shook him from his daze. His head snapped up and—of course—it was Potter. Who else? Of course Potter believed himself immune to the rules, of course Potter wouldn’t find a problem with being out of bounds after midnight, why would he?
“You take Muggle Studies?” Draco asked, astonished. She was certainly an intriguing Slytherin, that was for sure.
He turned around to face the two portraits, hanging side by side. They couldn’t look more different—Dumbledore with his white hair and pale blue robes and the golden frame, next to Snape in his typical black, wearing a disdainful expression, his dark hair hanging in his face. Even Snape’s frame was a deep chestnut brown.
“Yes, of course, I…” Draco sighed. He wondered when he was finally going to really trust Potter. After all, they had been working together for over two years now, and had saved each other from messy situations at least a dozen times over. Draco could easily say he trusted Potter with his life, and he liked to think that Potter could say the same, but that didn’t mean he trusted him with…information. With details about his personal life. With his history. It was harder to talk than to duel sometimes, particularly to Potter. And yet Potter seemed to find it so easy, casually mentioning his family dinners at the Weasleys’, and nightmares about the war, and doubts about himself, all just spilling out of him as if he were discussing the weather. And Draco would stumble over himself and try to come up with an adequate reply that reflected the seriousness of the subject matter, but then Potter would just follow it up with something inane like “have you had the lemon scones in the cafeteria? They’re always gone by the time I get there.” It was all just open vulnerability with Potter and Draco was terrified of it, partly because he couldn’t imagine doing so himself, and, perhaps, partly because there was something so…
But seeing the babies changed that. They were clumsy and excitable and their mothers were patient and caring with them. They were just creatures, living their lives, at peace with the enormous burden the Wizarding World had placed upon them.
They travelled through the house, Draco’s hand unconsciously hovering over his wand holster the whole time. He knew that the house had been mostly cleared, but Dark Magic tended to
It was as if he had opened a dam. Potter’s arms relaxed, their weight and warmth leaning comfortably around Draco. His shoulders fell, causing Draco’s face to nestle further into his neck. He leaned his own head forward, until they were truly wrapped around each other.
Draco didn’t fully understand everything Violet told him about her apprenticeship, but he knew she was studying under a Squib, Peter Duncan—which was a surprise in and of itself, because Draco hadn’t known Squibs could even see Hogwarts—who worked for the Wizard-Muggle Relations office in the Ministry, and that she wanted to create more opportunities for Squib integration into Wizarding society.
Harry felt strange, like he wanted to sit, something he had never felt in his bird form. He squawked again, feeling frustrated that he couldn’t speak.
“I think me and Malfoy are sort of mates now,” he said, more to himself than anyone in particular. A fork clattered against a plate, and Harry looked up to see his friends staring at him.
Harry cawed loudly, feeling victorious. He flapped his wings excitedly and pushed his head against Malfoy’s hand, which automatically moved to stroke him.
She didn’t push him though, instead offering tea and biscuits as they sat in her living room, and leaning back in her velvet armchair, waiting for him to speak.
“Come sit, we’ve just ordered the first round,” said Ginny, grabbing him by the wrist and leading him to the largest table in the pub, over in the corner, the one they always frequented.
“Absolutely not, she’s with Potter and Weasley,” Draco said, stubbornly. Violet and Daphne shared exasperated looks that Draco chose to ignore.
Granger listened intently, her eyes growing wide and nearly bouncing out of her seat by the time Draco had finished.
Here he was, traipsing after Hufflepuffs to reach their new shared common room. Blaise and Theodore had both shot him and each other worried looks as they walked, but they all knew better than to speak. The less attention they drew to themselves, the better.
“So you’ve been…what? Trying to provoke me into some sort of response? Trying to get me to hex people back?”
The photographer was another surprise—the familiar face of Dennis Creevey grinned up at him from behind the camera.
“Where’s Ron?” Harry asked, as he sat down in a grey armchair beside Hermione. Recently he’d noticed that a lot of the time it was just him and Hermione. Sometimes it was because Ron had long apprenticeship meetings, but it had become increasingly frequent for him to be absent. He hadn’t asked about it, assuming that maybe he still wasn’t comfortable being around Hermione or something, but it had been long enough since they’d broken up and they seemed to be back to normal around each other.
Coming back to Hogwarts had been difficult, and Harry had taken a long time to readjust. He had been twitchy and anxious, flinching at every sound like an easily startled cat. He hadn’t been alone in that, it seemed many students—mainly the older ones—still remained in the state of mind of war, and being back in the castle where the battle had occurred did little to help that. The professors all did their best to help make everyone feel safe and welcome, and the castle itself bore few signs that any war had taken place, but Harry still
“You could be honest about that with him,” suggested Hermione. “Say that you’re worried that he won’t want to continue meeting up with you.”
“Not all of them,” he said. “When I was a child, my mother charmed my bedroom ceiling to look like the night sky. A bit like the Great Hall, but it didn’t change like at Hogwarts. When I couldn’t sleep at night, I’d look up at the stars and find the Draco constellation.”
“I’m well,” Draco replied. “Trying to make it through the rest of August in one piece. And yourself?”
“How come you’re doing an apprenticeship with McGonagall?” he asked, and suddenly he felt Hermione’s hand grip his forearm.
“The right thing for the wrong reasons,” he repeated, looking at Potter curiously. “Isn’t that still better though?”
“Hello, Potter,” Draco greeted him politely, standing from his seat. Harry felt as though his hands might start shaking at any moment.
“What are you doing? Do not get near me with all of that dirt on your hands,” Draco warned, holding up a hand.
Draco had said nothing, not even to his mother, for fear that she would confront Lucius and then receive the same treatment. He suspected she knew regardless, large as the Manor may have been.
Harry just shrugged, wondering if Ron’s disdain for Ashworth had more to do with how much Hermione seemed to like him than his rigorous instructing technique. He himself wasn’t sure how he felt about Ashworth. He was quite interesting and seemed to be a good teacher, despite how quick he seemed to move through the material.
“Oh, it’s lovely. Could do with some more colour, though. You know…” Luna launched into a long-winded explanation of how colour affected the soul, but Harry’s was distracted by Ginny reaching out and putting her hand on his on the arm of his chair. He looked up to find her brown eyes on him.
Suddenly, everyone wanted to know what had happened between him and Ginny, and when he refused to give out any details, people were more than happy to make up their own.
For one thing, it had only been a little over a week since he and Draco had gone to the Ravenclaw-Slytherin Quidditch match. It had ended with a Slytherin victory, and Harry had been even more excited than Draco about this, yanking him into a celebratory hug and cheering loudly. Draco had come out of it with wide eyes and a few hairs out of place and Harry had laughed at his shocked expression and reached out to ruffle and mess up his hair even more. He had expected Draco to make some snide comment about touching his hair, smirking in that way that let Harry know he was joking, but he had just continued to look at Harry, his face looking slightly surprised and slightly bemused.
“You know, I first started thinking about it when we got back from Australia,” she said, looking off into the distance with a fond expression on her face. “My parents were very upset with me, of course, but somewhere in the midst of all the scolding, my mother took me aside and asked me about Ron. She said she could tell that something had happened, something had changed between us. I asked her about Dad, about how she had known she was in love with him. She told me that being in love with someone wasn’t what made you want to spend your life with them. She said that there were thousands of kinds of love, and only by letting yourself feel as much of it as you can will you figure out the differences.”
“No, I was visiting when you popped by,” he narrowed his eyes at her at the reminder of her dramatic entrance and she smirked, unrepentantly. “I have my own house now, in Kensington.”
Having never spent Christmas at Hogwarts before, Draco didn’t have anything to compare it to, but if he had to guess, he would suppose there were more students staying at the castle than in previous years, for no reason other than the war having taken many of their family members from them. Draco could only hope that those students who felt in necessary to take justice into their own hands—which they did by aiming hexes at Draco’s back—had been on that morning’s Hogwarts Express.
He entered Hogwarts this year focused. Now was not a time for lounging about and enjoying himself, it was for hard work and study and for keeping his head down and being as non-threatening and non-combative as possible. He knew people would be looking for excuses to get him in trouble and he was determined not to give them any.
“As if you’d ever let me forget,” he responded, feeling himself slip slightly into the old rhythm of their conversations, the awkwardness melting away.
“We were curious to see your common room,” Luna supplied, smiling at them before taking a seat next to Hermione. Ginny had already made herself comfortable in a grey armchair next to Harry’s.
“Do I look like I’m on duty?” he gestured vaguely at himself, obviously not in his scarlet Auror uniform.
Potter was thoroughly addictive, the heat of his skin under Draco’s fingertips, his five o’clock shadow scraping across Draco’s collarbone, his wild hair falling into his face as he thrust into Draco, the way he would bite down on his bottom lip in a feeble attempt to restrain his moan. Draco always found it a personal success when he managed to get Potter to let loose, to pant and sweat and groan. More than anything, he wanted Potter to look at him. He could never say it out loud of course, but nothing turned him on more than Potter’s eyes looking into his.
Harry was ready to argue more, but at the sight of all the racks of clothes and potions and vials assembled on the tables in sight.
He glanced at his book, making sure he was retrieving the right items from the cabinet. Once his arms were quite full, he returned back to where Malfoy was seated.
He was half-right; Hermione did have a disapproving look on her face, but when she spoke, she only said, “Well, it’s better than using the Prince’s book, I suppose. Still, Harry, you should at least be paying attention to what he’s doing. And that’s not really fair to Malfoy, either.”
“Nothing,” Draco tried to cover up, but Potter narrowed his eyes in that frightening way of his. “Oh, don’t be an idiot, Potter. Of course people are angry at me, what did you expect?”
“I have to say, I am very impressed with you all today!” He spoke with a broad grin on his face and his arms out as if he were inviting them all to embrace him. “You all brewed a highly advanced potion to a relative degree of success.”
He hadn’t known why he wanted to speak at Malfoy’s trial, but he did, so when it was his turn to speak, he got up and simply told the truth.
“Ugh,” came Potter’s voice, gravelly and rough. Draco felt chills rise up over his arms. He never thought he’d know what Potter sounded like first thing in the morning, but here they were.
“Tabitha Hawk was the best Keeper the Falcons ever had. She played for seven years and never once let the Quaffle into the hoops. Not
“Hey, don’t blame Aquila! Hunting is in her nature. Not her fault you got yourself stuck in your Animagus form. Are you even
Potter shot him a glance, but when Draco looked back at him, his green eyes were back on the pitch already.
Harry couldn’t help but feel nervous. There were so many factors, so many things that could go wrong. He tried to loosen up with a strong drink, and distract himself with his friends’ conversations around him, but all he could think about was the man at the other end of his Legilimency link.
But this year, Draco had found people. He had found violet, who he trusted more than anyone else. She was highly unusual, with almost everything she believed in going against what Draco had been taught as a child, but she was passionate and determined, and a fiercely good friend to Draco, even though he often felt he didn’t deserve it. And there was Luna—eccentric, odd Luna—who was ready to march off into the Forbidden Forest with a man who had assisted in holding her hostage. Luna, who took him to see the baby Thestrals and inked beautiful flowers around his horrendous Dark Mark, and who always seemed to just
Hermione and Ron had come over, on one of their few evenings off, and Harry had cooked dinner. It had been lovely at first, Harry once again trying to apologise to Ron for quitting the Aurors and Ron waving him off, Hermione cutting in to reassure Harry that they supported him no matter what he decided to do, and Harry felt a rush of affection for his best friends, but then a thought so out of place shook him.
“Potter,” said Draco, suddenly serious. He had to get the words out before his fear got the best of him and he thought too hard about what he was about to do.
“She thought that throwing the idea of magic at them and their parents all at once and immediately whisking them away to boarding school was rather overwhelming, and that it may benefit them to integrate sooner, to teach them how to control their accidental magic the way the rest of us are taught by our parents. It would also help the parents come to terms with it if they’re able to understand earlier on, while their child is still at home.”
Draco listened, quietly. He had always thought that everything had come so easily to Potter, it was one of the many reasons why he hated him so much. He seemed to have all the luck in the world, friends who were constantly saving him, teachers who favoured him. But Potter was clearly feeling fraught here, and Draco—though he never thought he would—found himself relating to him.
It had certainly not been clear to Harry, but he didn’t say that to Hermione because he knew she would just give him one of her
“Completely understandable, Harry,” reassured Ashworth, with a smile. “What was it about being an Auror that first attracted you?”
“I suppose,” he said. “He protected me because he loved my mum and Voldemort killed her. But I don’t know if that makes him a good guy. He was a Death Eater before, and my mum dying was the only thing that changed his mind and made him switch sides. I think…” Here, Potter paused and scrunched up his face, as if he was thinking very hard. “I think that he did the right thing, but for the wrong reasons. And even if he did change his mind about what the Death Eaters believed at some point, he was still a slimy old bastard who was bitter and cruel to all his students. Well, besides his precious Slytherins, of course.”
“Yes, of course, I don’t mean exactly that. I mean, I think you should find someone—a student, or even several students—whom you could tutor. There are definitely students who need it and it would be good practice for you as well. I know you’re busy with classes, but try and find a time once a week to meet up with whoever you end up tutoring.”
“You want to cover it completely?” she asked. He wondered how she did that, how her voice remained soft and dreamy and never wavered for a moment.
He looked over at the Slytherin table. Malfoy was there, his attention-seeking hair hidden under the hood of his robes. A Transfiguration apprenticeship didn’t make any sense. He supposed Malfoy might be good at it, but it was so out of nowhere. Potions made sense. Even Quidditch would make more sense. But Transfiguration?
When he looked up, he found Granger, Weasley, and Potter all staring at him. Granger was still smiling slightly, while Weasley looked like someone had clubbed him in the head. Potter had an infuriatingly unreadable expression on his face, his bright green eyes boring into Draco as if wanting to unravel him like a ribbon.
On the curved wall opposite the arched windows hung four enormous tapestries, depicting the House mascots.
Draco wasn’t sure when he started ceding to Potter’s demands without bitterly arguing the whole way down, but he supposed he would have to analyse this new change in his behaviour at a later time, and for now, he took his seat again and scowled at the pale green flower.
What was the purpose in doing anything, when everything would just reset by the next day? It wasn’t like he could build any sort of rapport with Potter, every single day it would just be erased again.
“Alright then,” Draco acquiesced, unsure if the pink in his cheeks could be blamed solely on the brisk weather. It was only after they had walked into the Three Broomsticks that Draco realized why this was actually a horrible idea.
Draco couldn’t help but snort at Potter’s poor impression of Granger. Potter didn’t look amused, however, just tired. He took his glasses off for a moment to rub at his eyes before shoving them back on.
The Daily Prophet had had a field day when they found out that Harry and Hermione were living together, without Ron. There had been countless articles about how Harry had betrayed Ron by shacking up with his ex-girlfriend or about how Hermione had always been in love with Harry and had only dated Ron because Harry had been with Ginny and she’d wanted to make him jealous. It was all rubbish, and thankfully, Ron had taken it with good humour, mockingly admonishing Harry for dating both his sister and his ex-girlfriend and warning him off of Sophie. Eventually the articles died down, because of course, nothing ever happened between Harry and Hermione, and people slowly got bored of the same old rumours being recycled.
“Er…I’ll get the ingredients,” Harry said, standing up from his seat and starting to search for the potion in his book. Malfoy just gave a sort of non-committal nod.
not to,” Violet was saying, more to the room at large than directly to Draco. “I bet none of them even know that the Americans have been to the moon.”
Strangely hurt, Draco had penned a reply. Stilted and formal, he had written that this letter would be the last of their correspondence. He sent it off before he could second guess himself, before he could rethink what Potter’s letter had meant. He rejected any and all letters Potter attempted to send afterwards, not wanting to read more explanations of how bad Potter was at relationships, not wanting to think about how
“Have a seat, Mr Malfoy,” she said, gesturing to the spindly purple chairs that sat in front of the desk, and moving to sit behind it. Draco sat and looked up at her, intending to get right to the point, but finding himself frozen.
He had finally acknowledged that it was possible Muggles were far smarter than he ever gave them credit for. He allowed himself to be impressed by Muggle innovations and even found himself agreeing with some of Violet’s ideas for the further integration of Squibs into Wizarding culture.
He was so focused on shoving that name back into the deep abscesses of his mind that he hadn’t thought to school his features into a neutral expression.
“What made you think about that, Harry?” she asked him. The question somewhat surprised him, seeing as she had said almost the exact same thing about Malfoy after they’d gone to the Quidditch match together.
“How did the Americans walk on the moon?” He let it all out in one quick breath, trying to get it over with as quickly as possible.
Potter pulled away, slowly, one hand still holding Draco’s arm, the other clenching a fistful of Draco’s robes at his chest. He breathed heavily, his eyes still shining.
who had died. But as quickly as that relief had come, it had been forced away, shoved back into the corners of Draco’s mind, because there were far more important things to focus on now. The Dark Lord had returned and was none too pleased with Lucius and the other Death Eaters that had supposedly abandoned him. Once school had resumed, Potter was treated as a pariah, and Draco had felt a vindictive pleasure in having power over him for the first time. It was almost as if the realisation of the attraction he had towards Potter had made him more hateful towards him, more cruel.
chapter title is from Therapy by All Time Low, one of my favorite songs ever. chapter moodboard is Harry.
He was then introduced to the other three recruiters of the group—Chester Vogel, a slightly hefty man with thick black eyebrows and a matching moustache who worked for the Montrose Magpies; Ruth Merriweather, a relatively young woman with long auburn hair falling down to her hips who was here for the Holyhead Harpies; a Keegan Hitchens, a fair-skinned man with broad shoulders and a friendly-looking face, who represented the Kenmare Kestrels.
Once he felt his breathing go back to normal, he reached out for the menu sitting at the centre of the table, in the form of a square shaped book. He flipped through it, barely registering their extensive collection of teas and pastries, still feeling like his heart rate was slowing down to its usual tempo.
“So they did it anyway?” Draco demanded. “You denied their request and they just decided to go ahead with it anyway?”
People had rushed to see what the noise had been, and they had flocked around Ron. Harry’s ears were still ringing and he could barely hear the commotion going on around him, only vaguely registering Hermione’s voice.
“Of course,” he said, and patted the spot next to him on the window seat, as an indication for her to sit.
“Ingredients first, Potter. Questions later.” Draco tapped his fingers against the open Potions textbook on the desk before them.
Draco didn’t even flinch at the words, but he felt them settle uncomfortably in his gut, twisting around with the wine—
“There’s something I would like to tell you, Potter,” said Draco, pulling out one of the chairs and sitting down, with Potter following suit. “It’s about my apprenticeship.”
“Harry, leave it,” she warned in an undertone, but Harry ignored her. He wasn’t picking a fight, he just wanted to
“Easy, tiger,” he murmured, when Potter tugged at his shirt so hard that several buttons popped free. Potter pulled away, looking at Draco as though he was seeing him for the first time.
“I’m well aware of your turbulent relationship,” he said, in an assuring voice. “Professor McGonagall has given me the highlights.”
“It’s because of this maddening wand!” he burst out, withdrawing his wand from his robes and tossing it haphazardly on McGonagall’s desk. “I’ve used other people’s wands before, I know wands can have difficulty harnessing a wizard’s power if not finely attuned to the wizard using it, but I have never encountered a wand so utterly useless before in my life. Yes, kneazle hair does make for weaker wands, but I can barely cast a Lumos without it going out in three seconds flat.
“It’s never enough,” he had spat, pacing. “Every day, it’s something else. A speech, a picture, an interview. I came out of a bloody
“Hi,” he said, offering a small smile, and walking over to the table. They hovered awkwardly for a moment, seemingly debating whether to shake hands or not.
What came out of his mouth was the word, “grateful,” and he found it was very true. Ollivander’s silvery eyes softened slightly.
Now, he seemed a lot more like pre-war Malfoy. Harry didn’t quite know how to react. His Malfoy-instincts were off.
Subconsciously, he rubbed at his left forearm, at the Dark Mark seared deep into his flesh. He had tried to remove it this summer, using every spell he could think of until he had desperately and hysterically resorted to digging into his own skin with a kitchen knife.
“Yes, I suppose I had considered it. As you well know now, however, I don’t have to worry about that anymore.”
Potter continued to stare at him, until Draco started fidgeting from foot to foot, feeling uncomfortable, and then suddenly, he broke into a wide grin.
“Well, my boy, as you may know, my father and grandfather used various cores, as do wandmakers around the world—cores such as kneazle whiskers or mermaid hair or Thunderbird tail feather—and they can certainly make for suitable wands,” Ollivander gazed off into the distance, something that Draco had by now realized meant he was reminiscing. “In my studies, I found unicorn hair, phoenix feather, and dragon heartstring to produce the most reliable wands with plenty of variety within them. But every wandmaker is different; we all have our own spin on how produce wands. Alejandro Allegretto, a wonderful wandmaker in Argentina, prizes fairy wings and dragon scales over other cores. Irene Dandridge, an exceptionally talented young wandmaker in Australia, makes wands out of mermaid hair, billywig stingers, and snallygaster heartstring, which make for very different wands and she does an excellent job.”
“Once they’re full-grown, they’ll go in the lake, see,” he had told Harry. “But fer now, they’re still babies and need ta grow.”
“I want to,” Ella insisted, wringing her hands in her lap. “This year was really hard and I know it would’ve been impossible to get through if you hadn’t helped me as much as you did.”
“I’m not going to hurt you,” the man said, softly. “Aquila has only ever brought back mice and rats, and they’re usually already dead when she…
“I suppose it just…clicked,” she said. “I guess I didn’t think about it too much, because I liked blokes too, so I thought that the feelings I had about girls didn’t really matter, or that everyone had them. But after talking to my friends about it, I figured that no, not everyone felt the same way. I started paying more attention, and I realized I was attracted to girls just as much as I was to blokes. And I just sort of thought, okay, well, if I do meet a girl that I like and that I’m attracted to, then why not see where it goes? And you know, it’s been going really well.”
Harry had started to grow frustrated when session after session passed by without him being able to turn into his form.
The flowers were beautiful, drawn with thin lines and excellent detail. The stems of the narcissi sprouted from the snake’s head, the zinnia beside the skull but larger and pulling the attention towards it. Two tulips sat on the other side of the skull, with a blooming hyacinth right below them. The skull and snake were no longer the focus, despite their thick black ink.
Potter simply stared at him, his green eyes large and unreadable. Draco sat under his gaze until he felt his skin start to crawl. Swiftly, he straightened up.
He was met at the shoot by Demelza wielding a clipboard. She ran him through the set time while walking him into the building.
“I want to help people. And,” he felt his heart clenching painfully at the thought of Tonks and Moody, “some of the best people I know were Aurors. They gave their lives to save others.”
Draco had tried not to snap at him, because he knew that would lead to an argument or at least some snarky exchanging of words, which they really couldn’t afford while working on a potion this complicated. He was rather proud of himself to have accomplished this feat, especially since Potter had
“Bloody Potter,” Draco muttered under his breath. “How does he do that anyway? Is it some sort of Prat-Who-Lived mind game? By the end of this year, he’ll know my entire life story down to the colour of my baby blanket.”
“Maybe I’ll see you afterwards?” Draco had asked, trying unsuccessfully to sound blasé. He was terrible at hiding his emotions around Potter, and it was only Potter’s natural obliviousness that kept him safe.
He sighed and cast a desperate look over to where Daphne and Violet remained, sitting by the window. They weren’t looking at him, but rather laughing over something. He couldn’t believe he had to do this in front of Potter and Weasley.
Yes, it was just so incredibly lucky that he was to spend another year at Hogwarts with Harry bloody Potter.
Draco couldn’t help but snort. Civil? Barely restraining himself from calling Potter an imbecile every time he messed up a basic ingredient wasn’t exactly civil, was it?
The pantry was five steps away and Harry could easily get them himself, but he figured he should be giving Kreacher more to do, lest he come home tomorrow and find his kitchen swimming in more flowers.
Their little pity party was interrupted when Hermione appeared, plopping herself down across the table from them.
. You were clearly uncomfortable with the presence of the press so I got us out of there before we had to make any sort of excuse.”
Harry supposed he shouldn’t expect much more—after all, he and Malfoy had never exactly been on good terms. But he felt…
“Well, not that she’d show it,” acquiesced Blaise. “But she said something about having offended you somehow.”
Malfoy’s face softened slightly, and he seemed to unclench, tension dissipating in his arms and shoulders.
“What are you brewing?” Draco asked, curiously trying to catch a glimpse of the contents of the cauldron.
Potter had gone silent, and Draco wasn’t sure if he was expecting a response, but he spoke nonetheless.
Gregorovitch had come from a family of wandmakers. He had also read about Kinta Wolfe, the granddaughter of the famous Native American wandmaker Shikoba Wolfe, and Alejandro Allegretto, the latest in a long line of successful Argentinian wandmakers.
After witnessing Draco fail to block a Stinging Hex aimed at his ankle, Nathaniel had taken to waiting for him outside of Ollivanders and walking with him to the nearest Apparition point, which was right by his own work. With his large frame and muscled arms, and a deep frown on his usual chipper face, he had been extremely effective in preventing people from taking out their anger on Draco in the street.
Hermione said that talking about it would help, that he needed to get some of the pressure off his chest. But he felt like talking about it just made things worse, just made the pain more present, more focused. And talking always seemed to worry his friends, something that he didn’t feel he had any business doing anymore.
“Ah,” she said, clicking her tongue and nodding. “You’re not the first to come to me with nightmares, Mr Potter, but I daresay you have even better reason than most.”
“You said they’re odd choices. Maybe they’re meant to send us a message, like the Sorting Hat. The poppy could be telling Gryffindor that we can’t keep chasing after the dead. They’re gone. We have to acknowledge that we can’t change that, we can’t bring them back. And the Hufflepuffs. They’re always cheering everyone else up, making sure everyone else is taken care of. Maybe the marigold is a way of telling them that they’re allowed to grieve as well. That they are allowed to feel the pain of everyone we lost. Maybe the larkspur is saying that Ravenclaws shouldn’t close themselves off, that they should be willing to take chances and risk getting hurt instead of saying safe inside their comfort zone.”
“I think that had more to do with the wizard than the wand he was using,” he mumbled. He didn’t often find himself complimenting Potter, but at this point, it would simply be ignorant to deny that he was an extraordinarily powerful wizard.
“She’s gonna kill herself taking all those classes,” he said, shaking his head in disbelief. “You’d think she’d have learned her lesson after third year and that whole mess with the time-turner, but no.”
It was a technique he had learned from Rhiannon—focusing on one particular sensory experience in order to quiet down any intrusive thoughts. His fingers rubbed over the soft velvet, trying to focus on the feeling of the texture more than anything else.
“If you’d like me to leave, I would more than understand,” he said, looking down. There was a long moment where Rosmerta said nothing, until finally she made a tutting sound.
He then decided to visit Hagrid more often, and devote his free time to helping him with whatever monstrosity he was pouring his attention to this year. They turned out to be seapocks, strange and small aquatic creatures with vibrant green scales and alarmingly sharp teeth that Hagrid was keeping in large tubs near his cabin.
“Oh, yes,” said Luna. “I’ll be with Dad, and then we’re both going to the Burrow for Christmas dinner.”
He’d originally tried employing his usual method—short answers that gave little to no useful information. That didn’t work on Potter. He only asked more questions, even more insistently, as though he was trying to uncover some great mystery. It was easier and quicker to just give Potter what he wanted, which always seemed to be more information about himself.
It was clear he wanted nothing more to do with Harry, which Harry supposed he should have seen coming, but he couldn’t just leave it like this. He was aching with curiosity, he wanted to see
“Look, I get it, you think I’m useless at Potions. I sort of am. But you don’t really seem to want my help anyway, so make up your mind, do you want me to do my fair share of the work or not?”
on one of the goblins, and on Travers,” Potter continued, his eyes still focused on Draco’s face. “And I used the Cruciatus on Amycus Carrow. I still don’t think you could have cast it that day.”
He returned to the Ministry, but avoided the W.A.S. office, instead wandering into the Auror Headquarters.
“I thought I did, too,” said Harry, quietly. He didn’t want to elaborate, didn’t want the conversation to lead to the war, as it inevitably would. Thankfully, Malfoy didn’t pursue the subject.
Draco had forgiven his father, of course. He hadn’t even really needed to, because he hadn’t thought forgiveness was necessary. When the Dark Lord told you to do something, you did it, and there was no questioning or hesitating done.
“I think you were right, Harry,” came Ginny’s voice, and Harry turned to see she had come up behind him.
Harry’s mind was racing, mostly through memories with the D.A. The image of Hermione’s face when she first saw the form of her Patronus. The astounded gasps when Ginny cast a perfect
She didn’t come every time, claiming she didn’t want to impose, no matter how many times Violet and Daphne insisted she was more than welcome, but Draco still saw her often enough due to the proximity of their workplaces.
Harry's nightmares had reached a level that rivaled fifth year, and considering that he no longer had a piece of Voldemort’s soul inside of him to blame them on, it was becoming a major point of concern.
“And I doubt very much you lacked success with women, English or not,” said Theo, his tone implying it was not exactly a compliment. Blaise flashed him a wide grin.
Everything happened very fast after that. Or maybe, like it was in slow motion. Could it be both? Harry couldn’t move, he was frozen to the spot. His ears were ringing wildly, painfully. His breathing was heavy and quick and he felt even more tired from it. He didn’t know how he was standing, he felt like he could collapse at any second.
“Oh,” he said. “Sometime after the war. Maybe a few months later. Hermione had just gotten back from Australia, that’s why she’s all sunburnt on her nose.”
He didn’t hate looking at his Dark Mark as much anymore, not since Luna had added the flowers. It still made him think of the war, and of Voldemort, and of his father, and the scars reminded him of his agonizing desperation to remove it, but now it also made him think of Luna, of Armstrong and the other young Thestrals, of friendship and healing and recovery and change.
Normally, this would be a question for Hermione. He could sit down and ask her, “Hermione, why do I want to hang out with Draco so much?” and she would put down her quill and make that little frowning face where a crinkle would appear between her eyebrows, the one that meant she was thinking hard, and then she would say something like, “Well, Harry, it may be that a part of you is still suspicious of Draco, so you want to be around him because you want to know what he’s up to all the time.”
They were all condolence letters, the next being from Theo, Blaise, and Cordelia. He managed to get through them all, but by the end of Cordelia’s letter, his vision was blurry and he knew that the days of detachment from shock had passed. He folded up Cordelia’s letter with shaky hands, set it atop the stack of the rest, and then buried his face in his hands, allowing himself to cry.
Hermione read through it quickly, already knowing what it said as she had helped Harry go over the final edit.
Though Draco felt his cheeks flush pink at the praise, he was quick to give credit where credit was due—something that before this year wouldn’t have even occurred to him.
With a feeling of horror immediately coursing through him, Harry watched as greenish smoke swirled above her body, forming in the shape of the Dark Mark.
Luna and Neville were sharing a place in Hogsmeade as the two of them helped out at Hogwarts—Luna assisting Hagrid with his gamekeeping duties and caretaking of magical creatures, and Neville apprenticing under Professor Sprout.
“’Ere, ‘ere!” Fleur cheered, with a few tears in her eyes. Bill smiled at her and kissed her eyelid gently, before clinking his glass against hers, queuing everyone else to follow suit.
He felt like he was lying to them. Like he was presenting himself in sheep’s clothing, as an innocent boy who just got caught up in a bad situation. He hadn’t been a prisoner in that house, not really, no matter how much he may have
So here they were, steadily taking down the wards around the house so that they could enter, Draco whispering spells as Potter kept his eyes peeled for any movement. They were careful and meticulous, aware of how important this case was with every step they made. They couldn’t afford to mess up.
“Oh. Right,” nodded Harry. As Draco stood, shaking out his robes, and Harry felt his heart rate picking up again at his nervousness, he managed to get out a, “Could we meet up again?”
“She said something about Luna, called her ‘Loony Lovegood’. It wasn’t…I know I’ve said worse before, but…” he paused, trying to articulate his thoughts. “I wasn’t a good person, at Hogwarts. I didn’t like being reminded of that. Not that that’s her fault, I suppose.”
“Happy birthday!” Everyone exclaimed, and Harry couldn’t help but find he was grinning. He clinked his glass with everyone else’s, several spilling drops onto the table, before taking a long hearty drink.
“Honestly, this is getting ridiculous,” Hermione commented at dinner, regarding the latest rumour that Ginny had cheated on Harry during the war.
Perhaps if he had told someone, even one person, what was going on, he would’ve realised he was too far gone before it was too late to get out. But then again, maybe it was too late from the start.
Daphne nodded emphatically and grabber her book once more, bringing it back up to her chest and standing up.
What reason did he really have to be seeing her instead of Slughorn? Would it look like he was seeking preferential treatment of some kind? After all, Minerva McGonagall was certainly not his biggest fan.
On Christmas morning, Draco woke up with his chest feeling much lighter than it had in months. He had spent the previous night wrapping his mother’s gifts before sending them off, along with a letter, with Elpis. The eagle owl had seemed quite happy to have something to deliver and Draco felt another little pinch of guilt. Elpis used to be rather busy, bringing Draco gifts or letters from his mother on an almost daily basis, and taking his replies back. This year had been different. Narcissa had been keeping herself busy with the great purging of the Manor, so Draco had only received a handful of letters since the beginning of term. Elpis still regularly visited Draco in the mornings when mail arrived, even if she wasn’t bringing him anything.
“You can do whatever the hell you want, Harry, you’re gonna be Robards’ golden boy for a while now.”
“It looks to me to be larch and unicorn hair,” Draco said, trying to sound sure of himself. To his relief, Ollivander’s face lit up in a smile.
“Blood magic doesn’t just disappear when one member of the family dies,” Hermione said. “It’s only if there is no family left to bond to that it loses its power. That’s part of the reason Dumbledore made you stay at the Dursleys all those years, Harry, remember? Since they were related to you by blood, you were still protected by your mother’s sacrifice, a deep form of blood magic.”
It wasn’t much of a party, to be honest. Not that Harry had known what to expect, but it was much like any other Saturday in the common room, with people relaxing and chatting amongst each other. He was just thinking that he would tell Hermione he was tired and head to bed when a loud noise interrupted his thoughts.
“I am not disappointed, Draco,” Snape reassured him. “Merely surprised. You are a man of many talents and I am sure you will prosper, as you did in my class.”
“She’s in my History of Magic class,” Violet continued, “and she’s never anything but nice to me. She’s one of the only Gryffindors who stands up for us Slytherins, you know?”
It was nowhere near as horrific as living in the Manor during the Dark Lord’s reign, of course, but Draco certainly did not feel comfortable. Which was part of the reason why, when he entered the common room, he felt his shoulders relax in relief when he found it empty for the most part, spotting Slytherin colours by the windows.
. What did the Saviour have to feel guilty about? He had rescued the entire wizarding world from a psychotic murderer. But the more time he spent with Potter, and the more they conversed, Draco realized that Potter didn’t play the hero—he bloody well
He led Potter into the bathroom, and turned the shower on, letting it warm up as he unbuttoned Potter’s Auror uniform robes. Potter was trembling, his eyes flickering as though he couldn’t focus on anything in particular.
So, unfortunately, now Draco was actually attempting to teach Potter how to brew the potions they were assigned, which was proving rather difficult. Thankfully, there were no longer at each other’s throats quite as much, however Draco was still finding Potter’s ineptitude challenging his patience. When Slughorn announced that today’s potion was Amortentia, Draco felt his heart sink slightly. Amortentia was an exceptionally difficult potion to brew, and talking Potter through it was not going to be easy.
Draco hated himself a bit, hated how he went to that blasted event where everybody hated him just so he could see Potter afterwards. Hated how he knew Potter would leave as soon as they were done and he still let him in, still wanted him here. He hated how he knew, he
apologies for the late post, the holidays have got me in a major writing slump!! hope you enjoy the chapter, late as it may be!
He waited for a moment, to see if she would ask, but she stayed silent, waiting for him to elaborate.
“Dumbledore thought I needed to learn it in order to better block Voldemort from getting in my head,” he paused and looked slightly embarrassed. “Remember how Snape told you I was taking remedial Potions?”
“You probably won’t believe me, but I’ve been stuck in some sort of time loop,” he said. “I don’t know what’s causing it and I don’t know how to get out of it. Every day I wake up, and it’s April 10
“Shh!” she cast a panicked look around, even though the only other people in the common room were Oliver Rivers, curled up in an armchair with a book, and Hannah Abbott, hunched over one of the tables and scribbling aggressively with a quill.
He reminded himself she had just returned to Britain for the first time since the war, and perhaps didn’t know how she would be welcomed. For that, he felt a rush of sympathy for her. He knew what it was like to live as a former Death Eater in a post-war world, and though she had never taken the Mark, she had earned a reputation as a Death Eater sympathiser, and had to be afraid of the reaction she would get from people upon her return.
“Honestly, Malfoy, I have no clue. Maybe she likes your pointiness. Maybe she can smell that you’re a Slytherin.”
“Yeah,” nodded Harry, his mind swimming. Draco was staring at him, and through his peripheral vision, Harry could see he had an odd expression on his face, as though Harry was some sort of puzzle he was trying to figure out.
