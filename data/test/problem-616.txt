“Well, I find that I must thank you for your help.” He smiled at her, “so, what an earth are you doing here all by yourself?” he asked as he attempted to give her a scathing look. Key word: attempted.
Draco nodded, deciding to let Weasley's last comment slide, before taking a deep breath. “And how’s Potter?” he asked hesitantly.
. And I can’t and won’t let anything happen to you.” He said determinedly before smashing their lips together.
She sniffed. “That’s completely mad.” she gasped out.
Draco stared contemplatively at himself in the mirror, something wasn’t right.
“Nothing. Except from the fact that you’re my boyfriend and I care about you. That I want to make you safe and happy. And that it makes me feel genuinely sick, whenever you feel sad… do you want me to continue?” he deadpanned.
Draco wanted to scream. How was Potter still not getting it? Was Draco being that unclear?
He gave her a small nod. “Everything’s fine. Well, it will be fine.” He corrected himself.
Draco shook his head. “It’s okay. It’s okay.” He repeated. “I forgive you.” He said earnestly. Potter opened his mouth to protest, but Draco silenced him with a kiss, one full of tenderness and forgiveness. “I forgive you. So, please take me. I need this. I need you.”
The little girl said nothing, too weak to move or speak. Draco’s eyes widened, and then it was all moving in slow motion.
.” He admitted. The reality of his words hitting him like a tonne of bricks.
Weasley released him and sat back down. “So, don’t you dare tell me that it’s just chicken. And if Harry were here then he’d agree with me.” He finished with a smug grin.
Draco felt broken as he watched Potter leave, deep down knowing that Potter had taken his heart with him.
She shook her head violently. “Of course, I don’t hate you.” She reassured him. “I love you. You’re my best friend.” She declared fiercely and Draco couldn't understand her.
Did anyone ever take a minute and just think: you know what, Draco already looks extremely confused, so let’s not confuse him anymore. No, let’s help him.
He now realised how naïve he’d been. That wasn’t the truth. Not anymore. Because the scars were permanent. A mark engraved onto his skin to remind him why the bruises had been there in the first place. To remind him of all that he had lost, and all that could’ve been.
A small voice perked up. “Is grandpa struggling to use muggle technology again Papa?” it asked, and Draco turned to smile at his daughter. His beautiful, beautiful daughter.
Over his dead body! Pansy plus makeup equalled death. It was a known fact.
Draco shook his head. “You don’t mean that.” He attempted, half convinced that Potter was just saying what he knew Draco wanted to hear.
Potter chuckled dangerously. “You’re sorry?” he snarled. “You’re fucking sorry? That’s all you have to say for yourself?” he demanded an answer that Draco could not give.
Of course he didn't entirely forgive Macmillan, but he honestly didn't have the energy to think far too much into it.
Draco was sitting by the Great Lake.
She eyed him sceptically, “my friends at the Hufflepuff table told me that you were a big, awful, Death Eater Slytherin and to stay away from you because I’m a Muggleborn.”
He had Potter’s present wrapped messily beside him, and he suddenly felt nervous.
(See the end of the chapter for
Where had he heard that before? Oh yes, only two bloody minutes prior. It was if Pansy and the Gryffindor's had planned this. Some kind of Draco Malfoy intervention. Well, he wouldn't stand for it.
“That’s quite true. But even I can see that you’ve changed.” She mused. “You’re not that much of an arrogant idiot anymore.” she decided, giving him a once over.
This was awkward. Draco wasn’t imagining things, right? He’d spent hours thinking about how his first meeting with Potter would go, he’d even dreamed about it. There had been smiles, cries, and screams, but never had he dreamed anything like this. This was particularly embarrassing.
His father’s eyes lit up as soon as he saw him, which made Draco flush all over. Hearing that his father cared deeply about him was one thing, but seeing it, that was another thing altogether.
The Hufflepuff's drew their wands dauntingly, “oh, that was a threat by the way, if anyone was confused.” Kat said in a chirper voice before leading the first years out.
He needed to get out now!
Maybe there was some hope from Macmillan yet?
Severus growled. “Don’t give me your cheek, you idiotic boy. Don’t you understand the severity of your actions?” he questioned, glaring daggers at him.
“Do you really think it would work?” she asked albeit hesitantly.
The Headmaster carried on, “Forgive me, Draco. But I cannot help feeling these actions are so weak that your heart really couldn’t have been in them.” He said calmly and Draco hated him.
But he had people who loved him. People who were devoted to him and would do anything for him. He had people to guide him, to show him right from wrong. He had people willing to die to keep him safe. He’d made a family in the Weasleys.
Okay, that was it. He didn't want to do nicely. He didn't even want to share her toilet. He needed to divert the topic of conversation, and he needed to do it now.
That made sense. With their help, there was a greater possibility of success. He had a chance. He really had a chance.
If Draco was in the corridor with his Hufflepuff’s then Potter was hidden behind a pillar. If Draco was in class, then Potter was waiting outside. If Draco was alone… well, he didn’t want to think about that.
Yes, how
He raised a brow. “How?” he asked.
Nathan’s eyes widened with fear. “How do I know that you’re not lying?” he questioned.
Kat smiled at him in concern, “are you sad, Draco?”
He opened his mouth to speak but was abruptly cut off his father’s drawl, “because if you were feeling alright, then you would have no excuse as to why you were associating with mudblood filth.” He angrily spat.
Draco smiled softly. He was happy that the girl felt so strongly about him, over the past few days she’d become very special to him. Like the little sister he’d never had. Nevertheless, he couldn’t let her put any potential friendships on the line for him. After all, he’d be leaving in two years and she’d be staying for the next five. Of course, he’d write her, but it wasn’t the same as being with her in person.
He kept on running. He ran and ran without a care in the world for the intrusive looks he was getting.
Draco ran faster, quicker than he ever had. The Death Eater readied her stance, readying himself to utter a life ending curse.
He just wanted to know. He didn’t want to be baffled or confused. He didn’t want to spend endless days and nights antagonising over everything. He just wanted to understand. Was that too much to ask?
Ah the whole Slytherin and Hufflepuff one-sided hating. Slytherin's had hated Hufflepuff's for as long as he could remember. It was fitting in a way, he supposed. The sly, scathing Slytherin praying on the innocent Hufflepuff.
With shaky hands he opened his arms, in hopes that his mother would join him. He would
Defeated he sunk to his knees feeling his eyes start to sting.
She beamed. “Draco. What a pretty name.” she decided, before giving him a concerned look. “Anyways, Draco why are you sad?” she asked, and part of Draco was grateful for her constant interference.
Draco let out a cry. He knew that he had to stay away. He just didn’t know if he could.
He had to get out of here. Perhaps come back another day with Vincent and Greg as lookouts. Partially so they could be on the watch for any curious do-gooders. Mainly because at least they’d be there to find him if all the crazy ate his brain.
“Beautifully broken.”
There
He sighed, bracing himself for the worst.
Draco sighed. “Can I leave now? I’m tired.” He asked already getting up, determined to leave whatever the answer may be.
He was worse than the bloody Hufflepuff's. Much, much worse. At least the Hufflepuff’s made it known that they were following Draco. Potter on the other hand, thought himself to be a bit of spy. Draco would think it was pathetic, if he didn’t already feel a bit sorry for the git.
time Draco actually
Piggy shook her head and Draco wanted to hex her. “No, we just followed you in here because we
He sighed. “Weasley is absolutely besotted with you.” He assured her. “He doesn’t look at anyone but you. He doesn’t even speak about anyone but you. Hell, he even does his homework when you ask him to.” He declared, spitting out the hard facts. “If that isn’t love, then I don’t know what the fuck is.” He mused.
On his behalf,
Draco’s eyes started to tear up. To hear his father, say these things to him. For his father to act like somewhat of a human being, was all he’d ever wanted. It was what he deserved to hear.
“Yes, yes I’m extremely generous. Now please do get on with it. I’m a very busy man.” He said quickly, feeling as if he'd drop dead if he didn't sleep soon.
“This whole idea is insane, Malfoy. Are you sure you haven’t been slipped some of the potion yourself?” he attempted to joke and Draco wanted to cut his tongue out.
Ms Pritchett shook her head, taking a deep breath. “My daughter wasn’t always the beautiful, happy young girl that you knew her as.” She started. “She was heavily bullied at her old school. She was different. And the other kids didn’t like that.” She admitted quietly.
Draco was at a loss.
“Then tell me. Help me to understand.” She urged.
loved him. He would never get over that.
A stern cough erupted from above him and Draco pulled away from Kat.
Anyways, the cabinet was more or less fixed, and Death Eaters were planning their descent into Hogwarts. Father would be proud. Mother would be reeling. And Draco… well Draco, he was disgusted with himself.
Draco shook his head “No, that’s quite alright.” He said and got up to leave.
am I stupid?” she snarled.
Okay, so maybe she wasn't the bitch in this situation. Draco was the bitch. He was very much the bitch.
He’d snuck out to the pond every night since he’d gotten back to the Manor. He couldn’t explain it. He just felt this persistent need to sit by the pond every night by himself, watching the sun come up. It was silly, he knew that. But in a weird way, the act made him feel safe, protected.
It was pathetic. He was truly pathetic.
Draco turned his attention back onto the Hufflepuff. “Hmm that is a very accurate observation.” He quipped.
Draco growled. “So, what if there was? What’s it to you?” he snapped.
But Kat was okay.
Theo.” He glowered. “I need to go anyways.” He stated.
He shifted slightly, “I was ready to give up. To give up on happiness. To give up on love. To give up on life. I was in such a dark place. I didn’t think I had anyone to turn to. I was tasked with something impossible that I knew deep down I’d never be able to complete it. It seemed as if it was all over. That I was done.” He started, desperately trying to fight of the tears that threatened to escape.
He turned his attention back to the wide eyed girl who let out a questionable chuckle, “You don’t seem very happy.” She observed.
No! He thought. He didn’t want the blood. He didn’t want to be saved. He wanted this. He needed this. It was perfect. It was poetic. It was his way out. The darkness was his only way out. He would be free. He needed to finally be free.
Draco huffed. “I don’t want to talk about it.” her turned his back on his father, it was none of his business. What Draco thought felt or maybe possibly feels was none of his concern.
“It feels like I’m barely alive, as if I’m in between existence and death.” He started, tears spilling down his cheeks. “I look at you and I feel so much. I have all these fucking feelings that I don’t remember ever developing. I’ve always known you as my arch nemesis, as the guy who rejected me all these years ago. But now that’s different. You’re still my enemy, but ever since the beginning of seventh year, you’ve meant more to me than anyone else ever has.” He admitted.
She let out a defeated sigh. “Fine. I trust you. But don’t make me wish that I didn’t” she said simply.
Ricky nodded. “Thank you, Draco.” he told him earnestly, and Draco couldn't help but like the small human.
life many of the Malfoy’s before him had lived, then he needed to obtain a potions NEWT.
They lay like that for several minutes, seeking comfort in one another. Draco took a deep breath, “I wish that it was you.” He muttered honestly. “I really, really do.” the admittance hitting him, leaving him raw with pain.
Kat jumped up and down ecstatically. “Really?” she beamed and the rest of them followed her, smiling and clapping frantically.
Draco smiled. “Well, you know how it is, the Puffs and I are a package deal. If you can’t accept my Hufflepuff’s then you can’t accept me.” He joked.
“Because now you have me.” She answered simply. “And I’m going to do my best to make you happy.”
Pansy gave him a look full of pity, placing her hand atop of his in comfort. “I know that I’ll never be able to understand what you’re going through.” She started intently. “But what I
Hermione glanced at him solemnly, “Please just stay away.” She whispered and Draco felt his hear smash into two.
Draco looked at the young boy. “Love is a fickle thing. It’s not so much of me loving the man he has become but holding onto the man he once was. The man who’s cared for me all these years.” He took a deep breath. “That man has always been special to me, someone who I’d deeply admired. Do you understand now?” he asked.
Potter sent him a curious glance, which Draco ignored as he spun on his heel and headed towards the Great Hall for lunch.
.” She spat out the word as if it was poison.
Draco took a deep breath. This was his chance. The old bat had given him a way out, a ticket to sanctuary. All he had to do was be brave enough to take it. He could come clean to the order, ask for protection for himself and his mother. He was certain that they’d provide help for his father if he asked for it. Salvation was right there in front of him, all he had to do was reach out and grab it.
His father tutted. “Enough with the pleasantries. If the Dark Lord finds out that I’ve been communicating with you, then it’ll be both our heads!” he snapped.
It didn’t hurt nearly as much as the dark mark had. It didn’t hurt as much as having his freedom ripped from him. It didn’t hurt as much as having his family’s lives in his hands.
She tutted. “Nonsense, you’re here now, and that’s all that matters.” She gave him one last squeeze before letting go. “Draco’s here!” she called out and almost seconds later he was flocked down by an army of Weasleys.
But yes, his problems consisted of Potter and Potter only.
dramatic.
Draco wasn’t even surprised. Currently, Draco and Theo were making their way towards Honeydukes, a band of Hufflepuff's trailing behind them led by Kat.
Draco felt something acute to anger start to bubble up deep inside him, “Yes father, I’m friends with a Muggleborn Hufflepuff. Actually, I’ve made friends with many Hufflepuff’s.” he lowly informed him.
The boy turned a shade of Weasley red. “I was just wondering if I could talk to you about something?” he stuttered out and Draco realised that the boy was scared of Draco.
Oh, he saw how they wanted to play it. Well, two could play at that game. He stroked his chin as if he were in deep thought, “I wonder what my Hufflepuff’s are doing?” He started as he watched his friends start to squirm. “I hear that they’ve charmed their butterflies to act a little more aggressively, I do ponder what exactly would happen if they just so happened to attack once I step out of the carriage.” He threatened lightly.
Draco took a deep tired breath. “So, what is it that you want, Macmillan?” he asked distractedly, looking to see if someone,
Draco was late.
Draco turned round so that he was looking into lazy green eyes, “but I like doing this.” He stated as he cupped Potter’s balls, giving them a squeeze.
Hermione slapped him again. “Not an actual elephant.” She corrected. “I meant Harry.” she stated and when Weasley's baffled gaze cease to leave, Draco pitied his friend.
Luna shrugged. “I think that makes it even better. What’s the point of being different if nobody knows about it?” she reasoned.
Potter pulled away from the Weaselette, giving him one last triumphant smirk before returning back to his food.
She blushed. “Do you really think so?” she asked hopefully.
Theo took an almost calm breath, “I think you should leave, Potter.” It was calm. Too calm. A calmness like that in a situation like this, well.. that was dangerous.
Pansy took his hand in hers for a second time, “we’d ask questions. Give subtle hints about things regarding Potter that only we’d know. You’d never fail to look at us as if we were crazy. Your face would remain blank every time.” She told him and Draco felt tears starting to prick his eyes.
He gulped, that was all that he wanted to hear. But he needed to stay strong, for Potter and himself. “I hope that’s true.” He said honestly. “But I need you to do this. I need to do this.” He finished.
Draco’s mouth fell open in utter shock, his father carried on, “that has got to be the most
She gave him a hesitant smile, “if you still love him, then you should be with him. We all made you happy, but he made you the happiest.” She declared before turning on her heel and rushing into the store.
Happily, full of chicken, Draco sat on the couch as he watched Potter play with Teddy in complete awe. He looked so relaxed, so free. He looked almost as happy as the day at the manor when he’d seen Draco again for the first time. Knowing that seeing Draco again had made him happy, filled him up with welcomed delight.
“Are you really going to ignore me?” Yes, and yes and let Draco think about it…Yes.
He shook his head. “No, I don’t mean like that.” He started. “I mean really thought about it. Of how it houses so many different beings. Of how every part is too big to explore in a lifetime. Of how wonderful it is.” He spoke passionately, and his wonder made Draco's heart squeeze.
What could his father, a convicted criminal and somewhat fugitive want with Draco? It must be important if he was risking capture in order to speak to him.
He nodded, walking towards his mother, and launching himself into her strong arms. He’d missed this. It took him back to a time where his mother’s arms were the safest place in the world. They still were in a sense.
With a newfound strength, Draco screamed putting up the sturdiest shield charm he had ever known, channelling all that he had into his flow of magic. The crucio that his aunt had just been firing, rebounded as she fell to the ground clutching her stomach in agony.
“I’ve never hated you. Disliked you, yes. Thought you a bit of an imbecile, definitely. But hated you? Never. That was always you.”
Draco’s eyes widened with intrigue. “And who would this girl be?” he enquired, he had to admit, he did like to indulge in a bit of gossip now and again.
It took the little strength he had left not to look at the mark that stained his skin. The blackened snake reminding him of what he was. Of what he would never be. He was dirty, repulsive, a complete disgrace to wizarding kind. His whole worth, his entire existence all coming down to one choice. A choice he thought he made out of pride, one out of ambition and devotion. He’d hoped to prove himself worthy, to make him seem more than the petulant child he knew himself to be.
Draco’s heart clenched. Those were the words he’d waited months to hear, that he had waited a lifetime to listen to. Thinking them was one thing, hearing them was another, but believing them… well, that was another thing altogether.
He forgave Potter.
This was it. This was what his father had meant. This was closure. He knew that he’d never stop grieving. For grief was the price to pay for love. But he was healing. He’d never forget his best friend, but he’d heal. It was the only option.
Draco pulled away from Potter, shaking his head violently. “Can’t you see that’s the problem? I
“Can we talk?” Potter pleaded and Draco found himself turning to his father. It was astonishing really, that his father’s approval still meant so much. He held his breath as his father raised a brow, giving him a concerned look. His father looked as if to be in deep internal debate as he turned to his mother who gave his hand a reassuring squeezed.
“Don’t you DARE bring Hufflepuff's into this. We can settle this without being judgemental.” He huffed. No one should even dare to say anything bad about Hufflepuff's. Not when he was around.
Not that he'd ever admit that out loud. No, unlike Blaise, he valued his life.
Draco scoffed. “Well, yes I do believe that’s what the badge says Severus.” he fought the urge to laugh. He was quite proud of that one.
“Was it?” he asked again and Draco kept his head down, he couldn't look at Potter. He couldn't face him. Not like this. Not after what he'd done.
Draco shot her a reassuring smile. “It’s alright Pans. I’m alright.” He offered.
He shook his head. “I don’t think I’ll be able to get a new one for a really long time.”
too well.
In fact, he looked kind of good. Less prickly and more defined. Less uptight and more relaxed. The soft waves of his hair framed his face, soft wisps of hair brushing his forehead, bringing out the silver in his grey eyes.
He still hated Potter.
Fine! He admits it. He was worried about Potter. Of course, it wasn’t because he cared about Potter. That didn’t make any sense. He hardly knew who Harry Potter really was except from being his childhood nemesis. But he had to listen.
Draco felt a sick smile of satisfaction curl onto his features as he raised his wand, intent on finishing the job.
Draco raised an eyebrow, “see what?” he questioned.
She smiled widely. “That’s okay.” Her smile grew even larger. “If you want, when you die, you can share my toilet.” She said with glee and Draco felt sick.
Hufflepuff.
Draco nodded and she smiled giving him a light slap on the arm. “We’ve been worried about you, young man.” She chastised him. “Going back home like that instead of following the others and coming to us.”
Draco was doing the right thing. He was making a calculated survivors move. How could he possibly win a war if he were too caught up in his emotions. It just wasn’t practical.
even was that?
“The question is, are you willing to find that Draco again?”
Weasley gave him a warm smile. “You’re a better man than me.” he said in admiration and Draco decided that couldn't be further from the truth.
“This potion counts as one quarter of your final grade for this year.” Well it looked like things could get worse. Okay, Draco was sorry. He apologises to whatever God he’s seemed to have upset. He’s sorry.
Draco gave her a smile. “I’m more alive than I’ve ever been.” He reassured her and the other Hufflepuff's as best as he possibly could.
quietly if you asked him.
. Not a week. Nor a fortnight. Definitely not a few months. No. They’d been back for a bloody day.
He grinned. “Hello Kat.” He offered the small girl.
Blaise grinned. “I call bullshit on that pathetic excuse. Now, tell me the real reason that you rejected Theo.” he prodded.
He decided he didn’t care, if he died trying then that was the bloody point wasn’t it?
“You’re an idiot Draco. You’re a complete and utter idiot.” He snarled. “He has your mother; you narrow minded fool. How long do you think he’s going to keep her alive?” He spat and Draco felt sick.
He wanted everything to stop.
Theo nodded and Draco shoulder’s sagged in relief. “That’s understandable. I was actually wanting to ask you something.” He breathed out nervously.
His aunt started to shake violently with laughter. “Oh, likkle baby Draco, has finally come to play.” She shrilled turning around to face him, a sick glint residing in her eyes. “But you’re being rude, you haven’t said hello to our guest.” She grinned before turning the tiny figure to face him.
Draco shook his head, “I can assure you Weasley that I haven’t been kidnapped.” he walked towards the potions station taking over from Weasley. The potion looked remarkably stable. What a pleasant surprise.
Draco didn't like him one bit. The idea that this guy knew when you were sleeping and knew when you were awake. And not to mention the fact that he knew where all the children of the world lived. It had to be the creepiest thing he'd ever heard.
Potter smiled reassuringly. “So am I.” he stated. “But we’ll get through it.” he assured Draco. “Together.”
Kat and the girls were all looking up at the boy in fear. “People do dangerous things for the ones they love.” He concluded and Draco couldn’t speak.
Had it really been that bad? Draco glanced down at his feet filled with guilt. “So, I’ve heard.” He sighed. “I wish I could remember; I at least owe him that.” he half-asked, half-admitted.
“There comes a time when we must all face the choice between what is right and what is easy.” The Headmaster spoke steadily.
Instead of panicking, like he so very wanted to, he put on a brave smile. “There’s nothing to be scared of.” He said simply. “I’m sure you’ll make lots of friends.” He reassured her as best as he possibly could.
are you talking about Potter?” he asked and Potter’s face fell.
Pansy looked torn. “What else does he do?” she asked.
“Really?” she asked, her wide eyes glistening.
Draco felt a sweaty hand squeeze his. Against his better judgment, he decided that it felt…nice.
In one quick motion, he rounded on Piggy. “What in Merlin’s name do you think you’re playing at?” he seethed, red faced with anger. “You could have been killed! No, you
Mrs Weasley shook her head, “I don’t want any excuses. We’re getting ready for Sunday dinner as we speak. You
“I brought you something.” She said shyly, snapping him from his thoughts.
He had spent so much time by himself. He'd spent so long thinking that he was alone. It was nice to think that they were there for him. That they understood him. Even though deep down he knew that they didn't. He was certain that they never would.
Draco finally smirked. “Because I’m helping make it.” He commented smugly.
“Draco… years ago I knew a boy, who made all the wrong choices. Please let me help you.” He pleaded. Draco scoffed.
want to be brought into their argument. Despite to what many may think, he
Draco stared down at the raised mound in front of him. A wooden cross lay hauntedly in front of it. He would add a gravestone in a years’ time. Hopefully.
Draco assessed the situation, his aunt’s wand was pointed at Kat, a manic look plastering her features. He knew that look.
chicken when we snuck down to the kitchens to find some after curfew?” Draco shook his head. “Was it
“Please Draco?” She asked again. “I’ll be good, I’ll be very, very good. I promise I won’t laugh or anything, even if they’re bad. Not that you could ever draw anything bad. Please Draco. Please, please, please, plea—”
Well, you can't stop true love.
“And who’s fault is that?” he answered scathingly. Giving his father a pointed and somewhat frustrated look.
Draco rolled his eyes, “can’t you see that I was in the middle of something.” He narrowed his eyes at his godfather.
Potter put his arms firmly on Draco’s shoulder’s, holding him in place. “Am I disappointed that you took the mark? Yes. Do I wish that you hadn’t? Absolutely.” He started and Draco was frozen in his place.
I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry. The decision to kill Kat has been something I've been battling with since the story began. I really didn't want to do it, but I had to. It makes perfect sense for the story's direction and Draco's character development. Scream and me, shout at me, do whatever. I was in tears after writing this chapter :(
He sets Draco down carefully on the ground, besides the warm fire. Slowly, he begins to unbutton his shirt, revealing his slender but somewhat toned frame. Draco turns from him slightly, suddenly feeling extremely self-conscious. He hates his body. He’s always hated his body. Potter tuts, steering Draco’s face to look at him. “You’re gorgeous.” He says earnestly before kissing him once more.
“Don’t say that word.” Kat hissed at the piglet.
The trial hadn’t exactly gone in the direction that they were hoping. Many had testified on Draco’s behalf; he had been amazed to see the amount of people who had showed up to support him. Some students that had attended Hogwarts during his seventh year had testified in favour of him claiming that he had saved them from the Carrows torture, by pretending to crucio them. They had even commented on how he’d helped them all hide from the Carrows at times when they had been most vulnerable.
Was Draco meant to be intimidated? If that was the case, then these doofuses were doing a pretty shit job at it. “Maybe because I am?” he pointed out as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.
Draco stood uncomfortably outside a quaint three storey home situated in muggle London. The war had ended three weeks ago, and Draco had been acquitted of all charges held against him. His trial had been a well-documented event, with many commoners attending, all hoping to see the Malfoy heir shut away in Azkaban for life.
“War took you from me. And I will spend every moment of the rest of my life resenting it for that.” He took another deep breath, “I was meant to protect you. I promised that I’d keep you safe. I’m sorry. I’m so, so sorry. I can’t change the past. I wish more than anything that I could, but I can’t.”
So, only two more chapters to go! All I can say is: fluff, fluff, fluff, and a teeny bit of angst because who am I without angst!?! :)
With a shaky breath, Draco’s hands wrapped around Potter’s own present, handing it to him. Potter smiled before hastily opening it.
“Why?”
I just wanted to say THANK YOU for all the comments and kudos so far! the response has been quite overwhelming. You're comments and kudos inspire and urge me to carry on writing, so thank you.
This was war.
Potter was leaning on one foot, his face was bloody, his shirt torn exposing a trail of cuts and bruises. Despite the obvious pain that Potter was in, he was smiling, his eye twinkled with a freedom that Draco craved to see more of.
He had a lot to think about.
He took a deep breath, “and most of all, I hate how much I love you. And I hate myself because I don’t know why. I can’t remember why I love you, and that hurts more than you can imagine.” A single tear rolled down his cheek, and he felt truly powerless.
Weasley jumped up from his seat excitedly. “Well, come on then.” He gestured Draco to follow him, and he couldn't help but comply.
Draco’s eyes.” He whispered quietly to himself.
But there was no need to worry, Draco had a plan.
She rolled her eyes. “What does he want?” she questioned and that was the million dollar question.
The boy let out a scared yelp, rubbing his palms nervously together. “It’s… just well I kind of, just a little bit, think that Kat’s…. really pretty.” He choked out and Draco blinked feeling confused.
“That I am.” He agreed. “And don’t you forget it.”
Potter opened his mouth to speak, but Draco abruptly cut him off. “And it’s hard. It’s so bloody hard.  To feel so much for someone but not remember how you fell.” He finished.
Well, that hurt.
The first year’s rounded on Ernie Macmillan, pointing their wands at him in challenge. Macmillan squealed putting up his hands in defeat. Kat hissed at him before turning on her heel running towards Draco, the other Hufflepuff’s following suit.
chicken when I brought you two drumsticks out of the goodness of my heart when you were stuck in hospital?” he asked.
“Draco.” A voice called from behind him and Draco walked faster, the voice was oddly familiar. Too familiar.
It wasn’t much. A quick brush of the hand as he walked past, or a brief pat on his lower back if he came up behind him.
His father sighed an exasperated sigh, “Draco, I spend my days locked away in a tiny cell. I shall not and will not be ignored.” he raised a brow just urging Draco to defy him.
“Draco. Hello— Dracoo. Are. You. Ignoring. Me? Draco. Draco. Draco Lucius Malfoy-Potter, you will answer me and you will answer me now!” A voice bellowed at the other end of Draco’s mobile, and he sighed, pulling the phone abruptly from his ear.
“You’re fucking worse than all of them combined.” He seethed.
If that was the case, then just where were the Slytherins? He needed to find Crabbe and Goyle. He’d tried to call them Greg and Vincent for a while, but he’d failed. It was just too weird. Anyways, he needed them. He needed some sort of protection. That may sound a little selfish, but really, it was just strategic thinking. It’s safer to stick with a crowd than travel on one’s own, especially during a battle like this. It may appear to be narrow minded, but Draco didn’t care. He’d rather be selfish and live, then be foolish and perish.
…” Draco whispered quietly, eyes shining with tears. “I remember.” He choked out and Harry’s eyes widened with pure disbelief. “I remember.” He repeated. “I remember how I fell in love with you. I remember it all.” he vulnerably breathed out.
Bill had shook hands with him, Fleur his girlfriend had excitedly commented that she was sure that he had veela blood.
Although, he already knew that he was an absmayl excuse for a human being. Where he could do better he would. He
Draco tried not to snort in disbelief. He knew better than to trust in fickle things like feelings. They only caused upset and heartbreak. Nothing more, nothing less.
Well it wasn’t his fault that Draco wanted to tie Potter to a quidditch pole and leave him up there for the dementors, for even dare thinking that he could be better than Draco at something.
It had been several months since he’d let the Death Eater’s into Hogwarts and it was now the Easter break. Ever since that day, he’d just felt… empty.
His words faded, as Potter lifted his hand, bringing it to Draco’s neck, gently pulling out the ring that lay silently on Draco’s chest. Carefully, he unclasped the necklace, removing the ring from its chain.
He couldn’t breathe.
Blaise laughed. “That bag is bigger than you.” He puffed out. “You look like that great big fat guy that muggles are always talking about.” Ah! He had heard all about the fat man.
good to laugh.
Draco gave him a peck on the lips. “Thank you, you’re perfect.” He said earnestly, not quite understanding what he had done to deserve the man standing before him.
He knew that. How could he love him? He didn’t even remember him. What he did know, however, was that Potter meant something to him. How could he not?
Draco raised a brow. “And it’s taken you several months to grow the balls to tell me just that?” he asked sceptically.
Draco flared his nostrils. “oh yes, Draco’s drawing so something has just
Kat gave him a concerned look, “what’s wrong?” she asked.
She waved before walking towards the store. Moments before she was about to step inside, she stopped and turned towards him.
“Whatever, Malfoy.” Weasley snarled before retreating towards where Potter and the mudblo— Granger were waiting.
Scared, Draco abruptly pulled away. “What in Merlin’s name do you think you’re doing?” he sneered angrily.
Draco shook his head, tears spilling down his face. “Please just take me home. Take me back to Hogwarts.” Draco begged and Theo nodded as they began their journey home.
Was it hot in here?
thing I have ever heard.” He mused in almost disbelief. His father rolled his eyes, “please do close your mouth Draco, it’s ever so unflattering.” He chastised.
Draco abruptly pulled from, her embrace. “I have too..” he started eyes wide with fear and determination.
Potter growled, if looks could kill, Theo would be dead three times over. “I don’t think you want to do that, Malfoy.” Potter snarled; his voice promised threat.
His father opened his mouth to speak but he cut him off. “Don’t you dare interrupt me.” He seethed. “You raised me to believe that we were right. That we were the good side. That the Dark Lord was great.” He hissed. “You raised me to become a
“Please?” he pleaded.
A girl. Why was it
Draco plastered on a fake smile. “I’m fine.” He repeated. “Let’s just go.” Theo nodded when he added, “Can you wait for me outside? I just need to use the bathroom.”
Potter turned a shade of red darker than humanly possible. “And will you two be getting back to whatever you were doing when I leave?” he challenged.
“And this, is why you should have never quit the team Draco darling.” Pansy informed him lightly.
He wrapped an arm around the girl, “But you are helping, by staying safe and alive. I don’t know what I would do if anything happened to you.” He said honestly.
Draco never said anything. The nights air was full of the sound of Potter. Draco never turned to him. Never nodded at him. He barley acknowledged he was there. Outwardly, that was. Internally, Draco smiled at Potter’s jokes. Mused about his day. Disagreed with his favourite subject. It was peculiar, but Potter’s company was oddly comforting.
sound good.
I can hung silently between them.
Draco was fine.
The last few days before the end of term past by quickly, and before Draco knew it, he was alone in the Slytherin dorms.
“What map?” Draco asked.
She laughed. “Yeah, and Ron’s going to become a chicken specialist.” She bit out sarcastically.
Well, he guessed he was here for the long haul. Draco nodded, gesturing for his mother to continue.
it whined.
Pansy shook her head in amusement. “He’s dating Harry Potter, best friends with Hufflepuff’s, whilst impulsively going around handing Muggleborn’s portkey’s in order to save their lives.” She smiled. “I think Potter’s Gryffindor had more than rubbed off on him.” she declared.
“She’s done something to you. Taken someone from you. Someone you loved.” He stated gently and Draco felt tears start to form in the crests of his eyes. “I should know, it’s the same look that I see every time I look at myself in the mirror.” He admitted quietly.
He looked at both Hermione and Weasley, secretly pleading for a little bit of help. Hermione sighed apologetically, whilst Weasley gave him a teasing smirk.
Severus snarled. “Don’t humour me, you idiot. What do you think your father will do when he finds out that you’ve been off gallivanting with a Hufflepuff who I may add is a mudblood, as well as accepting filthy muggle gifts. What an earth would the Dark Lord say?”
He believed that emotions were just fickle things that one could control. That he could decide how he wanted to feel, and he’d decided to feel nothing.
.” Potter warned and Draco sighed defeatedly, this was
Draco gulped feeling distressed. “But I did choose.” He admitted more to himself than anyone else. “I chose to be better. I
Potter tore off his shirt, tweaking on one of Draco’s nipples which earns him a loud moan full of desperate need. “I know just how sensitive you nipples are.”
Draco blinked a few times in amazement. Surprised that such an acute statement could come out of such a small girl.
Potter flinched, patting Draco’s shoulder. “The bread doesn’t come with the toaster. You put it into these little slits, then press on this button and it toasts the bread.” He answered.
Draco gave Pansy a cunning smirk, “oh yes, she definitely would.” He assured her.
Theo patted his back, “it’s good to see that war hasn’t changed you much.” He commented, and Draco narrowed his eyes.
Blaise shook his head. “That sounds absolutely marvellous, but you know what? I think I’ll pass.” He mocked. “Besides, these beautiful smooth hands weren’t made for manual labour.” He said whilst admiring his hands.
He took a deep breath and asked himself one question. A question that was needed, a question that would allow him to rest.
“I thought I said that I didn’t want to see you again any time soon, Mr Malfoy?” she asked pointedly.
He had to keep going. He had to live. For Draco.
didn't have the energy for any of his witty remarks.
apologise for grieving.” She crossed her hands over her chest, her gaze hot.
to make nicey nice with the Gryffindor’s.
As he stood behind a grieving mother, he realised that he had been selfish. He hadn’t just lost a best friend; a mother had lost a daughter. And his actions had resulted in her struggle going on for that just little bit longer. If anything were to happen to him, he wouldn’t want his death to be withheld from his mother. So, who was he to have done that to somebody else?
Draco stood up abruptly. “I said
“Wrong answer.” Kat said, her voice colder than he’d ever heard it.
The next day brought an array of trails and tribulations.
you’re not this dense Draco. I didn’t say that you had a problem with Potter. I vividly remember stating that Potter was your problem.” She huffed out in frustration.
She carried on, “but now looking at you and hearing what you have to say, I couldn’t be any more confident that you’ll go on to do great things, than I am now. I’m proud of you Dragon.” She told him, tears lacing her voice.
Potter chuckled. “Shower sex.” he smirked mischievously, a suggestive glint residing in his velvet eyes, That
Okay, so all the evidence may point towards Draco not always being right. Well he was only human! Or was he? He’d never really figured out if having magic meant that he was less than human. All he knows is that he isn’t as infallible as the Great Merlin. We can’t all be Perfect Potter.
Draco was sitting at the Great Lake, the stars shining down on him protectively. He had his sketchbook on his lap, and a pencil in his hand. He mused that it had been such a long time since he had drawn anything. He missed it. Losing himself in his own little world, away from the clutches of reality. It was his escape, and he was thankful that it was still there for him to go to.
“We just wanted to help.” Hermione offered quietly.
“Draco?” his father called out. “I can barely hear you.” He pointed out, and Draco finally realised what the problem was. He chuckled slightly; his father really wasn’t the brightest button in the pot.
She gave him an award-winning grin. “I am proud.” She took a small step towards him, “I’ve always wanted to be in Hufflepuff, ever since I first heard about it. My friend says that Hufflepuff's are the kindest and bravest houses of them all.”
Draco was completely submerged. So, locked in the warmth that the locket was emitting that he was only broken out of his trance by Weasley’s violent screams.
He’d rethink the name later.
how it was meant to go.
He took a deep breath remembering something that his mother had told him long ago, 'If you don't sacrifice for what you want, what you want will be the sacrifice.' He hadn't understood her then, but now as he thought about it he realised her words couldn't be anymore true.
Draco shook his head, “what do you want from me?” he asked, nearly begging as he stared into hurt green eyes.
Several moments later, and Draco stopped in his tracks, before him lay the body of Jerry. Big mouth Jerry. Draco let out a cry as he fell to his knees, holding his body close. Too many innocents had been lost to a war with no biases. He was so young, so, so young.
His eyes widened slightly, “that would be amusing if it wasn’t terribly creepy.” he joked again.
It felt good to talk with his best friend.
With a sigh, Draco lamented over the letter he had just written Potter, carefully folding it and tucking it safely into its envelope. It was his shortest letter yet.
But, I’m sorry, I’ll do better.
And of course the rest followed suit. “They. Will. Suffer. They. Will. Suffer. They. Will. Suffer. They. Will. Suffer!” the first-years started to chant.
“Sev, I’m going to be honest with you.” He started and Severus narrowed his eyes, willing him to continue. “You really need to get laid.” He bit out with a smirk.
“Trust me, you’ve changed, you’re different. I’m just not sure of what kind of change yet.” she said honestly and Draco’s face fell.
“Draco!” Pansy gasped, her eyes shining with tears and Blaise wrapped his arm around her, pulling her in for a tight squeeze.
Draco’s eyes filled with fresh tears as he gave her a warm smile. “You make me happy. You make me so, so happy.” He cried out and she beamed as she disappeared in a flash of green light.
Kat nodded and Draco shot her a fond look, “he can’t see you through the phone darling.” He reminded her.
Draco nodded. “Yes, it appears that I am.” He answered solemnly, feeling a void in the pits of his stomach.
What an absolutely atrocious colour.
Draco took a deep breath and plastered on a fake smile he prayed appeared real, “I’m fine.” He answered simply.
A father that told him he loved him.
being heavily implied.
He hadn’t seen nor spoken to Potter since the night that Draco had gifted him the letters. Potter had deemed a moments peace to allow him to think necessary, so had flocked off to the Dragon reserve in Romania where Charlie Weasley worked.
And to see her like this, with tears running down her cheeks, well, it was something he never wanted to see again.
“I’ve never thought about it in that way before.” He told him.
Draco shrugged. “What makes you say that?” he asked.
“What. Do. You. Think. You’re. Doing?” he spat.
He groaned as he felt Potter’s hard length rub against the crack of his arse, and Draco greedily moved his hips so his arse was rubbing against Potter’s cock.
Draco didn’t love Potter.
“And what would that be?”
He gave her an even bigger smile, “definitely. In fact, I think you’d look beautiful.” he said sincerely.
Potter gave him one last final glare, before leaning towards the Weaselette and giving her a long, drawn-out, passionate kiss.
“Don’t lie to me Draco.” He urged.
Ah Snape. Severus Snape, the current greasy, haired git that Draco had been trying so desperately hard to avoid. Was Snape blind? Or did he have to charm 'Fuck off Snape!' onto his forehead?
of you Draco.” Pansy teased and Draco shot her a death glare.
Several seconds of silence passed before his father let out a low cough, “do you want to talk about it?” he asked.
Oh wait…that was right now.
Pansy pulled him into a tight hug as he sobbed onto her robes. “I know darling. I know.” He whispered soothingly. “But you have to. You don’t have a choice.” he froze.
She glared at him, “I’d keep it shut if I were you.” She told him and Draco promptly shut up, he figured that he liked his balls a little too much to dare to speak.
Ricky started to shake. “I just want to tell her that I think she’s beautiful. A girl that pretty should know.” He stated sweetly.
Instead, he just held her close. It wasn’t about him. Not anymore. In his arms, he held the woman that laughed at his jokes. Who’d attempted to make him cookies when he was sad. The woman has always and will always love him unconditionally.
And here was the thing about broken hearts. No matter how hard you try, the pieces will never fit the way they did before.
“Malfoy!” the voice said again desperately, and Draco turned around.
Draco shuddered. His words hitting far too close for comfort. Dumbledore thought he knew so much; that he’d had it all figured out. Well he was wrong.
The first thing he’d done was run to his mother, tears running down his face as he pulled her close, them both sinking to the floor with both relief and disbelief. They’d cried and they’d howled, seeking comfort in the others embrace. It was as if he were a little boy once again, seeking refuge in his mother’s safety. And he did feel it. He felt safe.
He took a deep breath. Sometimes, he wished he were a Gryffindor. He’d have the strength to grab what he wanted by the balls. The strength to chose death over life in favour of doing the right thing. But alas, he was a Slytherin.
“I hope for all our sakes that Potter is who he says he is, but how do we really know?” he enquired. He was lying, of course, he had the upmost confidence in Potter. He trusted Potter.
He felt like he was losing something important to him. Something he couldn't live without. He reasoned it to be his former self's innocence. The naïve belief and devotion he'd had in his father. The very thinking that had got him hurt.
“What’s so funny?” she asked accusingly.
“What in Merlin’s name is going on here?” Potter laughed in amusement.
He took a shaky breath. “It’s Lavender Brown.” He said more clearly. And wow, for the umpteenth time, Macmillan had surprised him.
The dungeons were dark and cold. The chain hanging from a single leg dug forcefully into his angles. The Malfoy’s had been sentenced to spent three nights in their own dungeons after what had happened with Potter. It was less of a physical punishment, than it was to bring utter humiliation on the Malfoy name.
He didn’t know how he thought it would feel to have another person’s tongue inside his mouth. To have someone explore you, to take care of you, to devour you – but he’d never thought that it would feel like this. His kisses were confident and long, determined but awfully refined. He feels like he was melting, as if he were slowly loosing himself in Potter’s heat. Potter brings one hand against Draco’s chest and used the other to cup the back of his head, and Draco groans into his mouth, low and hungry.
“What the
He was done! He was completely done. Seriously, was
Mr Weasley had given him a strong pat on the back, whilst thanking him for being there for Harry and his son.
He gazed up at the stars until they were covered by the sun’s light.
Draco took a frustrated breath. “Then don’t say stupid things.” He countered and he had to admit, he was quite proud of that comeback.
The Weasley twin looked up at the rubble hovering over his head, and back at Draco with complete astonishment. He smiled, before rushing over to Draco, helping him to lower the mound safely.
The story of Draco’s hearing had been on the front page of the Daily Prophet that morning. They’d deemed him the ‘unexpected hero who had protected them all’. They’d also regarded his relationship with Potter as the great love affair that had saved the wizarding world. He had been blow away with that response, he wasn’t a hero, he was just a man trying to do the right thing.
Draco sighed, before pulling up his sleeve, not knowing if he’d regret his action. Nathan screamed when he saw the mark, trying to pull away, Draco’s earlier sticking charm holding him firmly in place.
The choice had been made for him.
With a shaky breath, he ran out of his room sprinting towards the door. He needed to do this. He had to find Potter. He’d been letting fear rule his life, he’d almost let it cause him to lose the one person that could make him truly happy.
Having hope was the ability to still see the light, despite being surrounded by darkness.
With a determined breath, Draco pulled out his wand and charged.
Draco raised a brow. “I don’t know Ricky, does it?” he growled.
Oops. It appears the can has opened.
Draco looked up at her defiantly and her eyes widened with acknowledgement. “Oh, this will be fun.” She squealed firing the first spell.
His attention immediately turned to the lifeless figure before him. Frantically, he scooped her up into his arms. “Kat!” he howled. “Wake up, please wake up. You’re okay. You just need to open your eyes. Do it for me. Open your eyes.” He begged, pleaded.
“Dracoo. Draco. Draco. Are you even there?” a frustrated growl snapped him from his thoughts as he diverted his attention back onto his father.
He shook he head. “I’m sorry Theo, but I can’t.” he stated simply.
Draco eyed him sceptically. “And what exactly are your intentions with Kat, Ricky?” he snarled as if the name was distasteful.
So, the moral of the story was that it was all Draco’s fault. He was stuck at the manor antagonizing over Potter who was probably in Romania forgetting all about him. You know what they say, karma really was a bitch.
He realised that it wasn't a question whether he wanted to die or not. No, it was a question whether he wanted his mother to
There was silence for several moments before Potter growled, “Are you still not going to speak to me?” he asked.
His aunt gazed at Potter and her grandson lovingly, before giving Draco a knowing glance. “He looks really happy, doesn’t he?” Draco didn’t trust himself to speak, so he gave her a quick nod.
On second thoughts…
A cautious cough pulled his thoughts from his mother’s safety, as he glanced up and into the repentant eyes of his father. Part of Draco wanted to shake his head, to tell his father that he hadn’t forgiven him. That he may never forgive him.
His thumb traces a long line along his jaw, and Draco shivers. Potter pushes him against the pillows and kisses him again, and Draco aches for him. “I’ll make it good. I always make it good.” Potter whispers reassuringly.
A cheery voice perked up. “So, Draco, when do you need this all done by?” Kat supplied helpfully, and Draco loved her.
Draco howls. “Come Potter, fill me up with your come. Make me yours. Mark me. Mark me.” He screamed as Potter fucked him twice more before he too was coming in great waves inside Draco.
“Sometimes. But then I just remember that they say those things because they don’t believe. Not everyone can see the world as I do.”
“How’s your mother?” she asked quietly, almost desperately.
Out of pure luck, he’d found Potter, which is why, he was currently standing in front of him, wand raised and poker face on. “Give me back my wand Potter.” He attempted to spit out, internally pitying his mortifying excuse.
“I’ll make you happy?” she asked innocently, and Draco’s eyes teared up at her words. The same words that he’d heard so many years ago. The same words that kept him alive. That kept him fighting.
She took a deep breath. “I’ve done everything. I laugh at his stupid jokes. I help him with his homework. I glam myself up with makeup. But he still doesn’t notice me.”
Why was he making this so hard? Why couldn't he leave Draco alone? He already felt horrible, he already had the weight of the world on his shoulders. He didn't need this too.
Draco blinked, scrunching his face, utterly confused. Had he said that out loud?
What hurts? Goddamn it! What hurts?
“That’s just sad, Draco.” Blaise cooed.
Draco lies there, watching silently, as he works on his own bottoms, carefully taking them off. Potter’s cock is thick, long and Draco just wants to ravish it. Once they were both naked, Potter grabs hold of his feet, placing them firmly upon his shoulders. Draco started to squirm. “Shhh, shhh.” Potter whispered, stroking Draco’s face. “I’ll make it good. I promise. I just want you to feel so good.”
To have ones free will ripped on them. To think that he was free, then be told differently. He didn’t know how to comprehend it.
Draco hadn’t had that. He has parents who loved him but were on the wrong side of the war. He’d grown up thinking that Voldemort was right and the light was wrong. He was taught that Death Eater’s were good and Muggleborn’s were bad. It was so much worse when a parent loved you because you were much more likely to trust and respect their beliefs.
It wasn’t meant to be a constant thing. Just a few scattered meals here and there. Nothing much, nothing special. But after the sheer relief he saw on the Manor’s prisoner’s faces, he knew deep down that he’d never be able to stop.
Couldn't she that he was doing his best? That this was hard. It was so, so hard. He just wanted one thing. One thing that allowed him to breathe, that preventing him from loosing all that he had become. That stopped him from becoming the person that he could potentially be if left to his own devices.
But it was something he knew that he was. Something he knew that he would always be. And that terrified him.
Draco raised an eyebrow with an ounce of newfound respect.
Draco stared at him for several moments in sheer disbelief. “Really?” he questioned, deciding that Lavender would absolutely
No, apparently Slughorn had bitched about Draco’s ‘foully absurd language’ claiming that it was ‘disrespectful and disruptive’. Well quite frankly, Draco found Slughorn’s unibrow and toad’s breath ‘disrespectful and disruptive’ but you don’t see him running off to tell the Headmaster with his tail between his legs.
Draco was making his way towards the library, quite speedily in fact. Although, not too speedily mind you, because a Malfoy must be nothing but calm and collected.
He needed to get out of there. He needed to go. Leave. Goodbye. Fin. Finished. Done. Nada.
“Uhm, erm, uhm.” Draco spluttered uncomfortably.
Draco looked down at his crossed legs, “I don’t have anyone.” He admitted quietly, more to himself than anyone else.
She looked up at him with wide eyes. “I came to see you.” She muttered sweetly.
He smiled a sad smile. “I know that I should stay away. That I should run away and never look back. That what we have going on between us is an all-consuming destruction.” He said absently.
He huffed impatiently, “what is it that you want Theo? Do I need to remind you that I’m a very busy man?” he told him.
If he were honest, Draco didn't think there was a time where he wasn't thinking about Potter. The man had stolen his mind, just as he'd stolen his heart.
Draco looked away, his eyes filling with tears. “I’m sorry, I just can’t.” he chocked out before running away like the coward he was.
just say that a dent was a smirk. He was going barmy. Crazy. He was loonier than Luna Lovegood.
“What the
Draco blinked, feeling meek. “I’m sorry.” He whispered. “I’m so sorry for what I’ve done to you.”
“Toaster.” Harry sighed. “It’s called a toaster.”
His aunt lifted her wand again, and Draco dived.
It was breezy on the cliff. The air was stuffy, the grass was long and overgrown. Harry dropped down to his knees as soon as he’d hit the ground. Tears were felling down his face; his eyes were red and puffy.
the romance going on.” He remarked.
wasn’t over the whole ‘I stepped on your nose and tired to send you back to London’ incident.
Draco’s heart was beating frantically within his chest, as he held onto every last one of the Headmistress’ words. Her putting into words the very things that he didn’t know how to express.
“Do you really?” she asked, her eyes growing wide with wonder.
. He had given him acceptance, hope, love. He had said all that Draco was too scared to admit, but what he desperately wanted to hear. So, he took a deep breath, and gave Potter what he deserved. The truth.
The moral of his little discovery remains intact... Draco was still better than Potter in potions. Suck on that you little Gryffindor cheat!
Potter sneered at him. “Go out with you.” He answered simply.
He nestled himself deeper into Ms Pritchett’s warmth as they grieved the little girl who had changed both their lives. Draco realised that he had taken a step. He had taken another step in accepting his true self. He was one step closer to Potter.
Was she really trying to guilt trip him?
Everywhere he looks Potter is there. Giving him something to do, giving him confidence, giving him hope. He’s written to Potter more letters these last few weeks than he has anyone in his whole life.
His father carried on. “What you have with Potter is the real thing. I can tell by the look in your eyes when you speak about him. It’s the same look I get whenever I speak about your mother.” he admitted, a wistful look dancing in his eyes.
“The essence of
Draco took a shaky breath, “what the actual
She narrowed her eyes at him. “It’s rude to take the gifts that you brought for someone for yourself.” She reprimanded.
Draco narrowed his eyes at him, “what I felt, and what I didn’t feel is none of your concern.” He growled.
Draco was tired. He was tired of the lies. He was tired of the fake appearances. But most of all, he was genuinely just really bloody tired.
One thing that Draco had always loved about his mother was her ability to make him smile even in his darkest of hours. He’d be crying on his bed, or curled up into a ball in the parlour, and she’d find him. She’d always find him.
And Draco shook frantically. What had he done? What
liked them.
The Dark Lord had invaded his home.
Blaise smiled. “We don’t either.” He offered and Draco nodded.
Draco didn’t know where to look, so he settled on the ground. Potter scoffed. “Why do you never look at me Malfoy?” he asked. “Why do you never bloody talk to me?”
“Stop…” he says and Draco shakes his head. He doesn’t want to stop. But he reaches up and holds him still. “I want this to be good for you.” He breathes out.
Draco chuckled slightly as his eyes fell on Weasley, the git had obviously forgotten to take off his greased stained apron. He still couldn’t believe it. If you had told him nineteen years ago that Weasley would’ve become the first successful chicken expert to ever grace Wizarding society, he would’ve laughed in your face. But nineteen years later, and here he was only buying chicken that had been tested and manufactured by Weasley.
His lips were slightly chapped, as they desperately moved against his. They were begging, pleading, full of emotions that he couldn’t express. Words that he couldn’t bring himself to say. Draco felt his stomach churn, something fluttering inside of him. his heart was beating rapidly, it felt good. It felt
His friend shook his head. “You’re not going anywhere.” He said and she stared at him fearfully.
“Well, MAYBE if you let me talk once in a while, then FUCKING MAYBE, I’ll be able to answer your questions.” Draco spat angrily and the boy started to quiver.
Hermione gave him a thoughtful look. “Maybe if he spent half as much time working on his relationship as he spends looking at you, then they’d probably have a shot at something real.” She mused.
“How can you love him but not care for him?” A boy accused.
It was rude. Just so very rude.
Weasley narrowed his eyes. “What makes you think it’ll be brewed correctly?” he asked sceptically.
Potter gave his hand one last squeeze. “If you can forgive me. I don’t deserve it and I understand if you didn’t. But if you did, please know that I’ll change. That I have changed. That it’ll be different this time. I understand now. I almost lost you and I never what to lose you again. I care about you far too much.” he finished, and Draco's head start to spin.
“Definitely, you’ve gone soft.”
He sighed. “All right, all right.” He repeated, holding up his hands in defeat. “So how have things been without me?” he asked genuinely quite curious .
Okay, so Potter wasn't only the Boy Who Lived. He could now read bloody minds? The Dark Lord's chances had suddenly become a whole lot slimmer.
It had come up a few days ago in potions when Weasley had told him of his questionable plans for the future. The one and only thing Draco had thought upon hearing them was that Hermione was going to fucking kill him.
“You’re late.” Potter stated as Draco sat down next to him. Draco ignored him, focusing his gaze on the sketchbook beneath him.
Over their many nights spent together, he’d created a bond with the blonde girl. He admired her ability to stay optimistic no matter what. He envied how she always managed to stay true to herself. To be the person who she always wanted to be.
Perhaps, he had been avoiding the Weasley’s, but that was only because he was sure that he’d run into Potter if he accepted any of the invitations.
Draco narrowed his eyes at him, “and what reason might that be?” he questioned.
Draco was sitting at the Great Lake when a presence appeared beside him.
Theo looked down on Draco in concern. “Are you okay?” He asked.
Draco opened his eyes and looked straight into the ecstatic eyes of Harry Potter. He looked
So, what if Pansy said his jokes were a little too much? Or that one, or fifty times that Blaise had commented on his poor wit. Their ignorance wasn’t his fault. That they were so wrapped up in their boring dialect to truly appreciate his intelligence.
“Are you having a laugh, Malfoy?” Annie Warbeck bit out.
been you.” He admitted quietly.
Kat laughed. “Well it’s not as if Draco’s silly enough to get himself in a situation like that in the first place. He’d very smart.” She preened.
With a deep breath he carefully placed the chirping bird inside the cabinet, fixing the door shut firmly. He then muttered the necessary spells before opening the cabinet.
“Draco.” Pansy hissed, and he abruptly to face her, shoving the note safely into his pocket.
Honestly, Draco had no idea what to feel. One part of him was full of embarrassment, but the other bigger part of him felt deep gratitude and belonging.
So, if he could offer her nothing else, then he'd offer her friendship.
He mused that recent events showed that you could somewhat forget occurrences. But feelings, now those were something that could
Draco fixed his eyes back onto his sketchbook in an attempt to block out Potter’s existence.
He opened his mouth to object, but was abruptly cut off by a vicious glare, “and don’t you
He avoided her eyes, suddenly feeling quite shy. “Potter doesn’t seem to think so.” He mumbled.
because of him.
Draco remained silent. “Please Draco. Please just talk to me.” He almost begged.
He sighed. “Can you believe that the little bugger is in love with Kat?” he asked, still not being able to get his mind round it.
“You don’t have a problem that I’m gay?” he whispered hesitantly. His head was spinning and his face was red as he waited for an answer.
Was that too much to ask?
It was as if all his past mistakes had finally caught up with him. He was finally getting what he truly deserved. He didn’t want it. Oh Merlin, he didn’t want it.
Kat stared back at him, eyes wide, quivering with fear. Her dress was torn, her body bloody. Her hair was matted, her smile was non-existent.
He shook his head, “this is my burden and mine to bare alone. I love you Pans; I really do.” He took a large gulp of air, “but I need some time to myself. I need to be alone.” he said with finality.
Hesitantly, Draco made his way towards them. He shook his head frantically. He refused to believe that anything had happened. He would know. He would
He glanced down at his feet; his skin tainted with a soft blush. “It’s silly, I know.” He murmured.
Theo chuckled. “Where are you going to put it all?” he said gesturing to Draco’s lean frame.
She’d come in just after he had finished crafting one of his many letters to Potter. ‘Is everything okay mother?’ he’d asked her in concern. She’d slowly shook her head, tears spilling down her cheeks as she collapsed onto his lap.
She gave him a questioning look before opening her mouth to speak, “What’s is all abo—”
“Make sure that my funeral is prestige and honourable.” He said hopefully, “I want the best of the best. My robes will be flawless, my corpse will smell like bloody roses.” He heaved, “And you will
Hating someone because you felt you had to, hating them and not knowing why, was something Draco was far too acquittanced with. After all, he'd been doing it for most of his life.
The nerve on this guy! Draco scoffed. “You mean that your sorry that you and your little buddy Smith pelted me with so many hexes that I ended up with the hospital wing?” he spat.
Severus put a hand on Draco’s shoulder shaking him vigorously and Draco started to feel deep frustration arise from within him.
They all shook their heads frantically, their lips firmly glued shut. “Then please do yourselves a favour and do shut up.” He bit out before walking into Honeydukes.
He sighed. “I know it sounds crazy. It’s only been four months and I already feel like this. I can’t quite believe it myself. Never mind accept it.” he held onto Draco’s hand even tighter. “I just know that there’s no one who understands it like you do. No one that’s willing to just listen to me. No one who just sees me. Not the Boy Who Lived. Just me. You. Only you. It’s
So, maybe it was true, maybe it all made perfect sense.
His blessing? Who the fuck did he think Draco was? Kat's father. Last time he checked, Draco was only five around the time that Kat was born. So he had the smallest and he meant smallest huch that he wasn't biologically  related to Kat in that way.
what you did Malfoy.” He snarled as he took a step towards Draco and Draco reflexively took a wary step back .
Draco huffed as he started to put his gifts back in the bag.
He couldn’t breathe.
Fleur laughed. “Dhere iz nothing wrong with za little bit of sauzage.” She glanced fondly at a blushing Bill before biting into a fat, juicy sausage.
He took a deep breath, setting a trigger word. One that only Harry would know. One that Harry would say when the time came.
did he want him to say? The war was over. It was bloody over. It wasn’t meant to be like this. Draco was meant to be happy; everything was meant to make sense. So, then why was everything still so confusing? Why wasn’t it all just simple?
He took a deep breath, “I read your letters.” He told him, and Draco felt something close to dread pool in the pits of his stomach. Potter shook his head upon seeing Draco’s reaction, “they don’t change anything. In fact, they’ve made me love you even more, if that’s at all possible.” He admitted.
“Drawing?”
“She would?” Kat gasped happily and the same time Pansy chocked out “
Begrudgingly, he answered. “Of course, this is
Draco didn’t think he could handle that.
Draco smiled. “Always.” He assured him before walking out.
Draco grinned. “But it isn’t Christmas yet.” He pointed out, trying and failing to mask his excitement.
Potter turned to face him. “I still can’t figure you out Malfoy.” He accused light-heartedly. “You’ve been a complete git to me for the past few years. But this year, this year you’re different.” He contemplated. Really? He hadn’t noticed. Please carry on with your first-year observations, they’re ever so informative.
During those first few months on the run, Harry had wanted to give up. He’d lost Draco, there was no point of carrying on without him. But after months of wallowing in his self-pity, he’d realised something.
He didn’t understand it at all. He didn’t know why Potter was so horrible to him during the day. He didn’t know why Potter treated him like a real person at night.
Draco glanced at the shelve beside him, dread lacing the pits of his stomach. To his right, lay a necklace. He shuddered, he felt physically sick.
Draco looked up at her with hope lining his eyes. “Not make me drink any more of those disgusting potions?” He enquired with disdain, “they should be illegal.” He decided.
He took a deep breath, “she’s as well as she can be.” He answered shortly, taking in the concern on his aunt’s features. He decided to take a risk, “I know that mother would love to see you, if you ever get the chance.” He offered.
Potter sighed, “You need to stay here. You can’t leave. I’ll come and get you when this is all over.” He stated and Draco’s eyes snapped back up to his.
So, it had become an everyday thing.
work killing that pimple, because sweetie, it’s not a great look.” Pansy snapped and Blaise glared.
Draco nodded and gave her a quick hug “See you tomorrow.” He whispered and she sent him a friendly wave.
Draco crossed his arms firmly across his chest, shaking his head stubbornly. “I will do no such thing.” He bit out, over his cold dead body.
of all people would understand that.” She finished, as she shook her head at him.
So, I think there's only 3 chapters left including the epilogue. Hang on in there! Happiness is only a couple of chapters away :) :)
, I’ll marry you.” Harry broke out into a grin that lit up his entire face as he slipped the ring onto Draco’s finger, bringing him into a tender kiss.
He nodded. “Yes, very much so. In fact, I think that she’s beautiful.” he said in awe, the same wistful look dancing in his eyes that he'd seen on Macmillan just moments before.
“Thank you.” Potter said after a while.
Weasley growled. “Don’t remind me. I hate what he’s doing to my sister. Playing her like she’s a toy. “ he spat. “Although I can’t place the blame all on Harry. She’s only with him because he’s the bloody Boy Who Lived, she’s blinded by the fame and fortune. They’re both as bad as each other.” He resolved.
Draco nodded as they dissolved into another outburst of laughter. He never did answer Potter’s question.
Convenient. This was all just so bloody convenient. The
He shook his head. “No, but I’d like to.” He wiggled his eyebrows suggestively.
Potter nodded at him, giving him a small grin. “And I came back.” He whispered.
“Of course!” he yelled deliriously. “ Of fucking course, you won’t take accountability for your actions.” He swore. “Jokes on me, huh? For clinging onto that little piece of hope that you actually cared about somebody other than yourself. I’m such an idiot.” He snarled.
She shook her head. “I used to think that my mum’s death was my fault. That maybe if I were happier, or kinder she would’ve lived. I was just so confused.” She let out a loud sigh and Draco felt his heart crack a little.
“Just shut the fuck up and fuck me!” Draco ordered.
Draco narrowed his eyes at her, “no I don’t think I will.” He said blandly.
. He had simply written. Because he was, fine that is.
How could you have enough of good people? It was just something that wasn't done. There were good people, and bad people. Opting to venture with the bad people was just ludicrous.
“Get them off. Get them off.” He shouted frantically, running around in circles.
“It’s not much like that anymore. When I talk they still listen. They don’t judge nor mock me. But they’re not my friends anymore. No, they’re my family. I like to think that my parents are two stars out of thousands in the vast sky.” He admitted and Draco was transfixed onto him.
Content to remain in the others presence. The silence engulfing them like a warm, safe blanket.
She raised a brow, “And why’s that, pretty blonde one?” she wiggled her eyebrows suggestively and Draco paled. He knew that look, he knew it
Draco shrugged. “You.” he told him gently, because it was true.
“Then tell me. Please just talk to me.” Potter begged through his own tears.
A high-pitched squeak erupted from behind the pillar and Draco found himself taking another cautious step.
follow you.” she countered, and Draco was at his wits end.
let the Death Eater’s into Hogwarts. I
Once the hour was almost up, Draco made it his mission to pack away his things and get away from Weasley and Potter as quickly as possible. Just as he was about to escape to freedom, a wave of a hand stopped him in his tracks.
Draco looked at him with disinterest, he was getting bored now. “Yes, yes Weasley was incapable of maintaining a stable relationship.” He mocked. “You’re missing the fact here.” Macmillan gave him a confused look.
He let out a low cough, “so is anybody going to comment on how awkward this all is?” he asked looking around. They remained silent, “No? Just me?” he bit out sarcastically.
Draco screams as Potter pounds into him with fast, long strokes hitting that one spot inside him which brings him painfully close to the edge. He cries out, coming in hard, desperate spurts. “Come for me Potter. I’m gagging for it. Gagging!” he yells as Potter fucks into him chasing his own release before he’s shuddering filling Draco to the brim.
Draco eyes softened a facture. “Well, I’d always suspected it, but it just feels so nice to hear you say it out loud.” He gushed smiling like a loon before realising that he was being led off topic.
They had been promptly escorted from the courtroom after that. Draco smiled slightly at that; he loved his Hufflepuff’s.
Draco glared at him. “That’s a whole load of bollocks!” and Potter chuckles and tweaks his nipples once more and Draco groans, arching up against him. “You were saying…” he raised a brow cockily.
“The bravest and most beautiful person that I’ve ever had the pleasure of knowing was in Hufflepuff. Your namesake.” He said as he pulled out a ‘Draco Malfoy Pride’ badge pinning it to her robe. It shone brightly, a perfect fit.
“The bread?” Potter questioned.
before he flared his robes and swiftly left the common room. Draco Malfoy wasn’t anything if not dramatic. Severus Snape would be jealous.
He couldn’t do this. He couldn’t do this alone.
away from her.” he hissed demandingly.
He sighed. “Draco. My name’s Draco.” He stated. In all honesty, he felt quite sorry for the girl. She had no friends, no one to talk or laugh with. Draco may as well be dead, but in a sense he was glad that his heart was still beating. That he was still
Pomfrey shook her head. “Last time I checked; I hadn’t discharged you.” she chastised him.
Say it louder for the people in the back!
“A chicken specialist.” She hissed, again giving Weasley a murderous glance, and Weasley nodded. “Why would you want to throw your life away like that?” she seethed.
Draco blinked, completely astounded.  “I don’t know what to stay.” He started.
There was no other explanation. He had died and had ended up in hell and was currently undergoing deep torture. It was unexpected, Draco decided. He’d always believed that once he’d died and descend into hell, he’d be sitting on a throne. Instead, he was seated in an uncomfortable wooden chair in the Headmaster’s office. What a peculiar change of events.
Suddenly, a great bang erupted and all four of them turned to face Hermione, “This isn’t going anywhere.” She huffed, turning towards Pansy and Blaise. “Just admit that you two were wrong, and we can forget about it.” she urged them.
Draco also found it extremely peculiar that he was friends with Hermione and Weasley but not Potter. From what he could remember Potter was hardly ever there, and when he was, he hardly acknowledged Draco except from the odd taunt. When they were alone, Potter was vicious. Pushing and shoving Draco, desperate to make him hurt. It wasn’t as if Draco minded, he deserved it anyways.
Draco grinned. “Well, I do love my Hufflepuff’s.” he admitted, his features giving away the love that he felt for them.
He followed it deeper and deeper until he reached the foyer of the Manor, and his heart stopped. His Aunt Bellatrix was looming over a figure. A small and defeated figure.
She grinned. “I know, that’s the beauty of it I think.” she told his wistfully
He read it over.
As Draco followed Potter out of the hall, making the first free decision he had in ages, he heard his mother whisper quietly to his father. “I know that was hard Lucius, but part of being a parent is being strong enough to give your child the wings to let them fly.”
The pleading in Potter’s eyes heavily unsettled Draco. He mused that Potter must be one hell of an actor to pull something like that off. Draco almost believed him.
Draco attempted to speak but she cut him off with a wave of her hand. “If this were even a few months ago, you wouldn’t have been able to string a sentence together without calling me a
As always, comments and kudos are appreciated :)
“Open them, open them.” She chanted and Draco was absently aware that everyone’s eyes was still one them.
Potter seemed to be the one person he couldn’t forget. The one person he could never get out of his mind. It was as if Draco was drawn to him. Part of him couldn’t imagine his life without Potter, and that scared him. It scared him more than death.
.” He breathed for the first time and Harry froze. “There’s nothing you can say or do that will change my mind. I have to stay. I’m a liability at your side and we both know it.” he said rationally.
Draco had managed to sneak past the Death Eater’s and escape to the pond that was located near the back of the Manor’s grounds.
It was sickly sweet. Seeing the couple so in love with one another, filled Draco with a deep sense of longing. He
do you think I’m going to do with it.”
Draco narrowed his eyes at him, “I’ll show you extreme measures.” He threatened, picking up a pair of scissors waving them around frantically.
. He remembered it all.
He couldn’t have Theo. He couldn’t have anyone. Death Eaters didn’t deserve nice things.
With all the strength that he could possibly muster, Draco held his wand up high, looking Potter straight into his blazing green eyes. Potter gave him a small smile, one that he knew was only reserved for him. A silent smile, one that said so little, but meant so much. It was all Draco needed. He nodded his head, and Potter fired the first hex.
“I’m sorry Draco. I’m so, so sorry.” He grieved. “It’s going to be okay. It’s all going to be okay. I’ll protect you. I’ll protect you.” Draco could barely hear him, the pounding in his ears becoming too much.
He turned around to smile at his Hufflepuff’s only to met with nothing. Oh no, where were his Hufflepuff’s? If they weren’t there than that meant Draco was alone, and if Draco was alone…
“We were just really worried mate.” Weasley offered him.
It was all extremely exhausting.
’ The voice urged and Draco couldn’t breathe.
“For fucks sake Malfoy.” Potter’s voice raised in anger. “What the bloody hell are you up to?” he snarled.
He shook his head, “Well, then I’ll figure that out if it comes to it.”
“In fact,” Weasley carried on, stepping closer towards Draco, “if you wouldn’t mind, I’ll just...” He snatched a drumstick from Draco’s hands, sinking his teeth into the juicy chicken flesh.
“Now you don’t speak unless spoken to. You hardly spend any time with your friends. You’re either in the library or spending time with you Hufflepuff minions. You don’t eat eggs for breakfast anymore.” He spat out.
just happens?” he preened running his fingers through his hair before stomping out of the dungeons.
“I’m not even joking. They’re currently running around the castle attacking people with butterflies and promising to spill the blood of whoever hurt you.” He shuddered and Draco suddenly felt fearful for Potter’s safety.
“But then I found the wrackspurts.” Draco bit back a laugh, because of course it was. “I realised that I could see them. Floating around everyone, and I realised that I wasn’t alone. Everyone was as confused and sad as I was. I wasn’t any different.” She concluded, and Draco felt weirdly better. Even if he still had no idea what in the hell wrackspurts were.
“Draco.” A voice breathed and Draco looked up, straight into the teary green eyes of Harry Potter.
But it wasn’t even the fact that he had taken another life that disgusted him. No, it was that he’d liked it. He’d looked into her defenceless, pleading, eyes and had felt nothing but sheer pleasure. He wanted her to die, he’d wanted her to get hurt. And he’d done it.
“Hi Draco!” she beamed excitedly.
Draco was breaking a sweat. He was fascinated. What was in this thing? He’d heard from a friend that it made toast. But Draco couldn’t find the bread. Where was it?
“For Merlin’s sake Potter, what are you going on about?” he huffed.
Draco had always loved Ravenclaw's, again, ask him to admit it and well, use your imagination. Anyways, he was going off topic, he had a plan to execute.
She took a deep breath. “How I feel about him.” she admitted quietly. And there it was!
Potter edged closer towards him. “I can’t figure you out. Not anymore.” He seethed. “I used to know you so well. I knew what you always ate for breakfast. I knew what friends you had. I knew your favourite hairstyle. I knew that you were a selfish, arrogant, attention-seeking, git.” He looked at Draco expectantly. Draco remained quiet. Potter wasn’t saying anything he didn’t already think or used to do.
He hadn’t seen or spoken to Potter since the day of his trial. It was better like that. Potter was the Saviour of the Wizarding World; the press were following him even more than they had been Draco. Besides, his life now consisted of running from the press, hiding away from the manor, and fixing his atrocious hair which had been completely ruined during the war.
“I’ll be supportive when you aspire to be something that actually exists.” She snapped.
Draco sighed. “What in Merlin’s name did I do to deserve such dramatic friends?” He joked. But was it really a joke.
She squeezed his hand painfully hard. “So, promise me Draco. Fucking promise me that if you still feel just a smidge of love for Potter, you’ll go to him and you’ll never look back.” She begged him. “We all dream about finding someone that’s made for us. Someone who doesn’t care what we look like. Someone who appreciates all our misgivings and faults. Someone who loves us unconditionally. You and Potter had that.” She gave him a weak smile.
A comforting hand clamped gently onto his shoulder. “It had to be done. There was no choice.” Neville said determinedly.
Draco figured that he’d always known it.
He missed Draco. He missed him so goddamn much. It was as if someone had taken away the piece that made him whole. The most important part of him.
Yes, that sounded like Weasley. Too bloody stupid to see what's right in front of him. Except if it was chicken. Weasley
Anyways, he was attempting to look at anything but his controversial looks. No, instead he was checking to see if he had the words
? Alone. With only a ghost for company. He couldn't even remember what life was like before he'd gotten the mark.
The Battle was at an all time high as he walked towards the Room of Requirement. He had to find Potter. He knew that Potter had wanted him to stay in the room. That Potter wanted to keep him safe. But what about Potter? Who kept him safe?
Smith narrowed his eyes. “I don’t know what you’ve done Malfoy, but I demand you stop it.” Okay this was pitiful. Truly pitiful.
The twins wouldn’t stop calling him the ‘oh so Dark Young One.’
“Lucius?” Pansy shrieked, and Draco felt a snarky comment coming on.
Severus sighed. “You really are a foolish young boy.” he told him and Draco scoffed. Tell him something he didn't already know.
“Yes, yes Pansy. You’ll cut my balls off.” He sighed distractedly, as he started to flush all over.
He felt nothing because he was
Draco took a deep breath. “Not all that well.” He decided. “But I’ll get better.”
She’d come over, a frown dusting her features and say, ‘Draconis, I took nine months to form your heart, do not let yourself or anyone break it in fifteen seconds.’
Draco shook his head. “But I don’t want to.” He mumbled deciding that this wasn't up to her or anybody else.
Crabbe looked up at him with deep alarm. “What the
They sat there for several moments in silence before his aunt spoke again, “it’s your Black side.” She stated and Draco gave her a baffled look. She sighed, “It’s because you’re a Black, that’s why you’re holding back.” She said simply.

that he was thinking about her.
She nodded. “I know. But you’re only temporarily happy. I’m going to make sure that you’re happy
Draco approached him, tears staining his cheeks and pain eating up his heart.
.” she spat out hysterically.
He took another deep breath. “It was perfect. It was everything I’d ever wanted. And it scared me. It scared me so much.” He said shakily. “I was Harry Potter. I wasn’t meant to feel this way about Draco Malfoy. I was meant to marry Ginny and have hundreds of little ginger haired children. I felt dirty. I felt sick. It was as if something was wrong with me.” he wanted to console Potter. To tell him that there wasn't anything wrong with him. But he couldn't. He
But then again, the cabinet had already mocked him and taunted him, who’s to say that it wasn’t laughing at him? Draco took another look. Merlin! It really was laughing at him. The dent wasn’t just a smile. No, it was a full-on throaty laugh. There was no way on this goddamn planet that it was just a smile. A dent that big couldn’t be anything less than a laugh. He was sure of it.
“Really?” he mused. “Because I thought that it was hilarious.” he gave her a smug smile, and he could feel her deciding whether or not to smack him there and then.
is.” He said, gesturing between Draco and himself.
It was just all to fucking much. Why was it all to much? So, Potter really wanted to know? Well, Draco would tell him. He'd bare it all!
Greg sent him an apologetic glance as he gathered up his things and made his way towards the Weasel. Both he and Potter shot daggers at him as he sat down. Great, it must be his lucky day. Not only did he have one grumpy Gryffindor, but he had two. Bloody two for one. Maybe Dumbledore will fall down the stairs and break his neck, then he’d really be having a lucky day. For all the Dark Lord knew, Draco could’ve ‘pushed’ him. There, job done. Finished. Finada. Dumbledore no more!
His father took a deep breath, sitting down next to him on the bed. “I’ve made my choice. There’s no hope for me now. I may still believe in what the Dark Lord stands for, but I don’t follow his leadership. I find that whilst I may believe in what he says, I cannot wholly commit myself to a man like him.” He admitted and Draco was shocked.
? Really?
“But I can’t. I need you Malfoy. I need you so much.” He sobbed, his voice laced with vulnerability and Draco’s heart broke for a second time that evening.
Draco shook his head. “No, it’s fine. My father isn’t the greatest man. I love him, yes, but I don’t much care for him.” He hoped that answer was enough for the little creatures. He didn't much fancy going into great detail regarding his father and his less than absmayl relationship.
Draco gulped. “You can take her if you want. You can have a proper burial, with family and friends—
Draco didn’t much know what to say, luckily Harry came to his rescue. As always. “Don’t worry mushroom, I’m
“Because I’m sure you’ve gotten lots of gifts before that are much better than mine.”
One minute they were at each other’s throats and the next they were acting as if they were the best of friends. Draco could hardly keep up.
He wanted his father to understand. He
“The ‘Snarky responses to prevent having to talk about anything of importance’ game”. Dang it! But Draco loved that game.
“Have you ever looked at the stars Malfoy?” Potter asked, his gaze ablaze with wonder as he took in the nights sky.
Draco took a trembling breath, “the same.” He said quietly. “But it doesn’t matter. Not anymore.”
“I haven’t got time to get involved in insignificant things like relationships.” Draco said unconvincingly.
With a shaky breath he sunk to his knees so that they were resting just in front of the mound. Hesitantly, he pulled out a sheet of parchment from his pocket and began to read.
He wanted to tell her that he was fine. That everything was going to be okay. But he couldn't, and that completely broke him.
from a lot of pain. Draco was sure of it.
“I told you that I liked you at the end of fifth year and again at the beginning of term. But still, to this day you’ve ignored me. You haven’t told be if you like me, love me, or just downright hate me. So, which is it Draco?” he questioned. “Which is it?” he repeated, his voice laced with vulnerability.
“Why doesn’t he want to do what?” Theo asked.
“You know what?” Weasley choked out. “I may rethink that whole auror thing after all.” he declared and Hermione smiled.
?” an angry growl erupted from behind them.
“You’ve been a very, very bad boy.” She whispered in his ear, raking her sharp nails into his hair. He visibly shuddered, willing himself not to throw up. “I tired to fix it.” she spat out and Draco froze.
He had to stay calm. He had to get to Potter. After he knew that Potter was safe, he’d deal with her. He’d deal with her so good.
She pulled him close, “It’s not your fault sweet child.” She murmured soothingly into his ear. “You saved her.” she whispered in pure amazement.
“Damn it! I didn’t get anyone except Hermione and Weasley presents.” He moaned. Trust him to completely forget to buy a few extra last minute gifts. Actually, it was quite unlike him.
All he wanted to do was get back to the common room in peace? Was that too much to ask?
Draco took a deep breath, tears glistening in his eyes threatening to fall. Carefully, he extended an arm latching his hand onto Potter’s giving it a squeeze. He felt calm. He felt right.
“Over my dead body.” He hissed.
Greg snorted. “Slughorn’s assigning partners and you’ve already missed your name being called.”
is this a good thing?” he spat as he dug his nails deep into the palms of his hands. “He doesn’t remember me. What part of that sounds good to you?”
Draco narrowed his eyes searching heavily for the mocking words. Where in Merlin’s name was it? It was hiding, he decided. That had to be it.
No matter how much preparation he'd given himself, nothing would have truly prepared him for that. Hearing that his best friend was scared, and it was all his fault in the first place.
He carried on, “And if you get sorted into Hufflepuff, then I trust that you’ll show the same kindness, love, and acceptance that she’d always shown.” He pulled his daughter into a tight embrace. “I promise you; I’ll never be prouder.” He told her earnestly as he held her close.
Plus, Draco couldn't bare to think what would happened if the Dark Lord ever found out. No, he had to keep it a secret.
He looked up at Draco with emotion filled eyes. “through these rings, our magic has come together as one, just as I hope us to.” He got down on one knee and Draco gasped. “What I’ve been trying to say is, will you
The first night after Draco had cast them away with a portkey, he’d felt broken. He still did. He was just far better at hiding it.
But right now. right now, Draco was happy.
He pulled away from Kat who smiled before joining into the conversation once more. He watched the pure joy light up her features. He grinned, he also never thought that he’d be best friends with one. But as he watched Kat laugh with happiness, he mused that it wasn’t such a bad thing after all.
It was if it all had finally clicked in Macmillan’s obscenely small head. “You’re right I think I will.” He declared with determination.
Draco felt his body starting to shake with anger. “Raised me better?” he spat. “
Draco gave him a reassuring grin. “It was perfect.” He answered honestly without giving too much detail. He preferred to leave some parts to Potter's imagination.
“No buts.” Draco intervened. “Everybody makes mistakes and does things that they don’t mean.” He reasoned.
He sighed realising that she wasn’t going to let this go.  “My mother wasn’t able to get the potions cauldron that I so desperately wanted.” He lied through his pearly white teeth.
(See the end of the chapter for
sound like that, for Merlin’s sake!
It was
Ah Theo! The very person that he had been trying avoid ever since he'd step foot into the castle. It wasn't so much that he didn't want to talk to him...
Potter scoffed. “Do you want me to leave Malfoy?” he questioned and Draco froze.
Draco’s features softened. “Why not?” he questioned, completely confused as to why such a loving person like herself could ever be sad.
irresistible?
“Then what do you want?” she pleaded.
He ran.
Draco lifted an eyebrow, “you can’t act smart you bumbling buffoon. You either are or you’re not. Not that I’d expect the likes of
Suddenly, he felt two arms wrap around his waist. It took a moment for him to realise that he was being hugged, it had been so long. Again, he felt a warmness invade his stomach and he gave her a small hug back.
Blaise glared at him. “And you think you’re helping her like this? That you’re not putting her in harm’s way?” he spat out
Why did he think that Kat was pretty? He had no right to think that she was pretty. Draco needed to poke his eyes out or something, because this just wouldn't do.
“I’m Katerina” she started, “but you can just call me Kat.” She held out a hesitant hand which Draco gladly took.
The Headmaster took a deep breath. “What brings you here, on this fine spring evening?” he asked and Draco wanted to hurl.
Blaise took a deep breath. “You know we’re right mate.” He said softly and Draco broke.
She squealed in glee, “I wonder what it could be?” she asked as she tore open the gift. She gasped as soon as she lay eyes on it. “Oh Draco, it’s beautiful.” she cried, carefully tracing the sketch of herself staring back at her.
I'M WEAK! I COULDN'T KILL DOBBY :(  That kind of hurt, but we do love a little bit of Drarry! I kind of wanted to explore the Draco and Lucius dynamic. I don't much care for Lucius but even though he hasn't got great morals, I believe he loves his son.
He glared at her. “And why the hell not?” he prodded.
Draco blinked, raising a brow. “Shove it up my asshole.” He deadpanned, taking in Theo’s wide grin. “What the
Draco was doing the right thing. He knew that he was doing the right thing. He had to believe it. He had to. Because he couldn’t afford to be wrong. If he was, then he’d lost everything for nothing. And Draco wouldn’t be able to live with that.
The boy smiled. “Kat was right, you’re not a bad person.” He decided.
. Whoever that may be.
Draco bit back a laugh, “I don’t think the wizarding world would care for your declaration.”
Draco pursed his lips sheepishly, “I can’t say I was. Sorry, I was uhm distracted.” He said honestly.
The first years were surrounding him at the Slytherin table all involved in excited chatter. Kat was to the right of him squealing in delight whilst Pansy was to the left of him, her eyes glistening with amusement.
Truthfully, it wasn't so much that he was different, it was more so that he was quiet. Or maybe it was because he was defeated. That must be it, he decided.
“Malfoy!” a loud voice yelled and Draco ignored it because he was
Muggle? Well,
It all suddenly became too hot. Draco was sweating far too much for comfort. He needed to leave. He needed to get breakfast.
Draco groaned. “Alright, you annoying little cretin. I’ll show you a few. And I mean a few.” He resolved.
To be honest, he still had one question. What the
Weasley two nodded. “Does Potter take it up the arse?”
He knows it’s Potter. Of course, it’s Potter. Draco had been obsessing over him for several years. Potter had invaded his speech, his thoughts, his dreams…
Draco raised his wand at the Death Eater, “get the
Suddenly he froze, as he came across a folded piece of parchment in her front pocket. With shaky hands he pulled it out, unfolding it.
Draco Malfoy? I want to spend the rest of our lives watching the
you to be supportive of my life choices once in a while.” He huffed, and Draco had to admit, they sounded like a bloody married couple.
Draco frantically shook his head, “no, no, it won’t be. It can’t be.” He cried out.
He shook his head and sent the girl a reassuring look, “there’s nothing wrong with you sitting here. Old Severus probably just wants to talk to me about potions or something.” the
The last memory he had of Macmillan was him hexing him so hard that he'd blacked out later waking up in the bloody hospital wing. So
“But I don’t feel sad anymore.” She continued. “Ever since you helped me, I haven’t felt alone anymore.” She beamed. “You make me not sad anymore. You make me happy.” She gave him a massive heart-warming grin.
He laughed, “Anyways, Potter what on earth are you doing here?” he said once again in that terribly offensive tone. Draco did not sound like that!
“You’re mad!” Annie spat out. “You’re all fucking mad.” She swore.
What was he meant to say? I’m sorry that I haven’t visited you in prison father, I’ve been too caught up confessing my love for Potter to acknowledge your existence. Oh, and also I’m still not one hundred percent sure that Potter wants to be with me at this point, so there’s a possibility that it was all for nothing.
Draco started to pale. He couldn’t move. He couldn’t speak. He couldn’t breathe. He wanted it to stop. He couldn’t take it. He couldn’t
He felt a single tear fall onto his reddened cheek. “But I can change the future. I can look it straight into the eye and go for it. I can be someone that you’d be proud of. That I’d be proud of.” He sighed, “there’s nothing I can do or say that would ever make it up to you. But I can try. I can try and laugh. I can try and be kind. I can and will try to be the person who you thought I was. Of whom I
Potter laughed. “And it’s called a screwdriver.” He corrected and Draco looked at him as if he were stupid.
The girl watched him eagerly, “Well that is what I asked, wasn’t it?” she exclaimed.
“You’re a Hufflepuff now. Embrace it!” he exclaimed and his defence fell.
Draco had planned to work on the nuisance that was the vanishing cabinet. He hated that cabinet. He hated it’s smirk. He hated it’s smile. He hated it’s fucking laugh. When this was all over, Draco would take extreme pleasure in killing it. Who’d be laughing then? Definitely not that blasted cabinet, because it would be dead. Sucks to be it.
Draco felt his heart speed up as Potter continued, “Like hell am I going to let you spend Christmas all by yourself.” He declared.
Weasley smiled. “Harry was way out of order.” He said.
“Thank you for your blessing.” She bit out sarcastically. She carried on, “You had just been born, and it was the happiest day of my life. The Healer had just handed you to your father and I watched how his eyes sparkled. He looked more beautiful than I’d ever seen him. He just looked down at you with so much admiration, with deep, unconditional love. And he smiled at me.” She smiled softly, “That’s when I knew.”
Almost dying does that to a person. But he wouldn't dare admit that to Weasley. He'd had a glimpse of death and he didn't rather fancy seeing it again for a long while to come.
She nodded enthusiastically and Draco was surprised when a small hand latched onto his own. It was a very peculiar act, but it strangely warmed the pits of his stomach, nonetheless.
you’ve finally realised that I fucking exist.” He swore in mock laughter.
He felt bad. Here Potter was only trying to offer his assistance and Draco was acting like a brat. Still, he'd rather die than admit defeat.
“It seems as though everything was lost. That everything was taken from us. Ripped from our clutches. And in a sense, the war did do that. It tore down the life we once knew, the life that we had become accustomed to. Throwing us away as if we were broken and used. We didn’t have much, but at least we had something.” Her voice started to shake and Draco could tell that she was holding back the tears.
Theo’s lips were chapped. Moving against Draco’s with small strokes. It hesitant, careful, and soft. There was hardly any tongue. There was no emotion, no passion. There was none of that. It was just…nice.
He felt the need to defend Potter. It was as much Draco's fault than it was his. After all, Draco was the one who had played with Draco's emotions resulting in this mess.
He nodded silently, a single tear escaping his clutches. He’d find Draco again. How could he not? Harry would do anything for Draco Malfoy. That was something that would never change.
He took a deep breath, “do you not believe me?” he asked, his voice laced with vulnerability. Potter clutched Draco’s wand, their hands almost touching. “I promise that I’m telling the truth. I’ve been completely lost without you. There’s been more days than I’d like to admit where I’ve wanted to give up because you wasn’t with me.” He told Draco intently.
Was he
Hermione beamed and mouthed a genuine ‘thank you’ to Draco, who nodded. They didn’t call him the Prince of Slytherin for nothing.
His mouth was soft, his lips just brushing against Draco’s slowly at first. His body started to tremble, but Potter was careful, so gentle. He cups his face even tighter and kisses Draco passionately until little sounds well up in the back of his throat, his mouth opening up for him as he feels Potter’s tongue slide in. He tastes of chocolate, of treacle tart, but mostly, he tastes of home.
A pain fiercer than he had ever known ripped through him, as he fell to the ground, withering in pure agony. It was as if millions of hard electric impulses were flowing through him. It hurt. Merlin, it hurt. Tears were streaming down his face; his heart was beating erratically.
Bellatrix smiled viciously before dropping Kat’s broken body to the floor. It falling with a tortured
“No. No. NO!” Potter shouted. “I won’t lose you. I can’t. Not again. You’re coming with us.” He declared as he attempted to pull Draco towards them.
He was not going to stand for this pure disrespect. No one insulted Draco Malfoy and got away with it. Well, unless you were Potter...
“Oh look, there’s Aunt Hermione and Uncle Ron.” Harry gestured to the couple who were giving their daughter Rose a tight squeeze, snapping him from his thoughts.
Gathering up all the courage he had left, he placed a kiss full of longing, passion, and love to Harry’s pouted, full lips. The kiss saying all the words that he couldn’t express. It was over as quickly as it had began and Draco felt empty.
He gathered his strength for what he hoped was the final time and opened his mouth to speak. “Father, I want you to keep silent and listen closely.” He ordered, pausing for several seconds. When the phone became silent, he took it as a sign to carry on talking. “You’re holding down on the speaker, that’s why you can barely hear me. Take your finger off the speaker.” He urged him.
Draco snorted. “My hero. For none of this would be possible without your sacrifice.” He teased, but sadly he wasn't really in the mood for chicken at the moment.
Draco turned to face the inquisitive little menace, “quite simply actually. He is my father so I love him but he is an obnoxious twat so I don’t stand for what he believes in.” he answered, mentally kicking himself for being so vulnerable. To a bunch of first years, nonetheless.
It had been just over a month since the final battle, and this was the first time that Draco had interacted with anyone who wasn’t his mother or Ms Pritchett. He wouldn’t admit it to anyone, but he was really starting to become quite lonely.
“No. No. No. No. NO!” he shouted tears streaming down his face. This wasn’t real. It was a dream. No, a nightmare. One that he needed to wake up from. “Wake up.” He ordered more to himself then the sleeping girl.
He scoffed. “I don’t know why I expected any better.” He snarled. “You’re a coward Malfoy.” He spat. “You’re a fucking coward.” He said once more before stomping out of the Great Hall.
Blaise chuckled, patting Draco’s knee. “You know for a Slytherin, you’re a shit liar.”
“Hello Luna,” he spoke quietly at the sleeping girl. He felt the familiar feeling of guilt wash over him when he looked at her. Her face was dirty, her clothes hung off her bones. It was a sight that should never have existed in the first place.
He could swear that his father’s face had turned red amongst all the green. “A puppet?” he drawled. “What are you talking about?” he asked him, and Draco didn't see what was so hard to understand.
A week later and Draco was pissed.
“Well I think you’re stupid.” The boy spat and Draco would’ve hexed him if he didn’t remind him so much of his former self.
Draco dug his nails into the palms of his hands. A part of him that was larger than not wished that he drew blood. He wanted to hurt. He wanted to feel the pain of suffering that he so desperately deserved.
“I said. What. Are. You. Doing. Here?” she seethed again.
Kat laughed before pulling Draco in for one of their hugs, “You’re right, I’ll see you at dinner.” She assured him before shooting Macmillan one last glare and walking towards the door.
Merlin! The woman was acting like he’d been ignoring her for all of her life. It was extremely unhealthy if you asked him.
Potter stayed until the sun came up.
Weasley intervened. “The point is, that it’s not healthy.”
Luna shook her head, “don’t worry Draco, it takes some time to accept, but when you do, you’ll never feel freer.” She reassured him.
is it to send an owl Draco Malfoy? Or even reply to one of my owls?” He opened his mouth to speak but she silenced him with a wave of her hand, “and don’t give me some rubbish excuse about how I could’ve come to the manor. Your wards wouldn’t let me in.” she pointed out.
He took a deep breath, “Kat I’m very grateful that you like me enough to distance yourself from your friends.” He started, “but you’re a great person and you deserve to share your friendship with so many others, not just me.”
“Merlin Draco! What the hell are you going to do with all this chocolate?” he half-laughed, half-sighed.
Draco nodded. “Yes, yes have me.” He gasped out. “I want you, only you.” He murmured. Draco could feel Potter’s erection, hot and hard through his bottoms. He squirmed against his lap, allowing himself to press against his erection, again and again, breathless with want as Potter’s eyes flashed with desire. Draco wants him. He can only pray that Potter wanted him just as much.
disappointed in her.
Well, the time for redemption was long gone.
But now, now it was real.
“I want to hate you. I want to hate you so goddamn much. But I can’t. I fucking can’t. And that scares the shit out of me.” he said and Draco didn't know what to do.
Answer: You did not.
He gave Draco a quick peck on the cheek after checking if anyone was looking. They couldn’t afford to be found out. A rumoured Death Eater and the Boy Who Lived, a couple! That was sure to bring some unwelcomed attention.
Her words meant everything to him. The one thing he’d always wanted to do was make his parents proud. And knowing that not one but both his parents were proud of him, that they accepted him… well, that made him accept himself as well.
” he repeated for good measure.
Why? Just why? Why had it all come down to this? Why did he have to do this? He'd been naïve. He'd been so naïve, going through the year as close to normal as he'd possibly could. He'd been foolish. So. so foolish.
With one last glance at the poison that stained his hands like a scar, he walked out the door. The last shred of his innocence left behind in the room as he descended the path to destruction.
didn't Potter say that in the first place? He eyed the device greedily.
She shrieked in crazed filled laughter. “Oh, I’m so scared. Likkle Bikkle Dwaco is going to do something bad to me.” She spat out. “Well, it’s a good thing I know exactly what to do to make him hurt.” She snarled firing a crucio at Hermione.
“Wingardium Leviosa!” Draco frantically pointed his wand at the rubble, so that it barely hovered over the Weasley’s head.
Draco opened his mouth to tell her that she was wrong, but she cut him off, “we push people away because we’re scared. Because we can’t imagine a world when we’re not in control.” She put her hand atop of Draco’s.
He was confident that Potter wouldn’t be making an appearance, especially after his earlier outburst.
Dark Lord to come and kill the Headmaster his damn self instead of leaving it up to a sixteen-year-old boy.” He spat out.
Deep laughter filled the room as Potter tore off his invisibility cloak. He narrowed his eyes at him. “I hate it when you do that.” He spat and Potter.
Draco gave her a genuine smile, “I do. I like them a lot.”
He felt conflicted. Obviously this was more personal to Potter than he would ever know. To think that he hurt someone like this. That
Draco grinned, “you know? I think that Slytherin green is an excellent idea.” He exclaimed.
Draco’s face fell slightly. “Sometimes he’s mean to me. Sometimes he calls me pathetic or a Death Eater. He does things he know will upset me. It hurts when he’s like that.” He saw the scared look on her face. “But that’s only sometimes. And it’s only during the day. At night he’s perfect. At night he makes me happy.” He tried to reassure her.
liked this woman.
She sighed. “I’m sorry darling, I wanted to bring you a nice cup of tea before your big day tomorrow.” She offered in an apologetic tone.
There was no point arguing or dismissing a person like Potter. It would only get Draco into more trouble than he was already in, and he really didn't need the attention at the moment.
Draco shook his head, “they haven’t done anything to me Potter. You sound crazy right now.” he pointed out.
Payback was a bitch.
? Oh, dear Merlin, he could see it now, the wizarding world completely overrun with Draco Malfoy prider’s, that was something he definitely didn’t want to see.
She shook her head. “Silly Draco. I’m not a young lady. I’m a big, grown Hufflepuff.” She said defiantly.
kind of look. She slapped his arm, “don’t question me.” She told him.
“You’re nothing but Death Eater scum.” He insulted and Draco abruptly slammed his book shut.
Kat put a small hand onto his and squeezed, “I know you’re lying” she started knowingly, “but that’s okay. We all get sad sometimes, but all we need is someone with a bright smile to remind us that we’re not alone.”
He was about to turn to leave, when a small tuff of curly brown hair stopped him in his tracks. He watched startled, as a small girl crept out from behind the pillar. She was small and frail, he guessed that she couldn’t have been older than a first year. Her robes were too long, her black eyes drenched in tears.
Hello, old friend, Draco thought absently as he looked round the room of requirement. It looked the exact same, he supposed some things never changed. He’d come in here in search of Potter, Crabbe and Goyle trailing behind.
His father let out a defeated breath, “it’s always been about Potter.” He said matter-of-factly. “Has been since the second you met him. That was a lie. It’s been about him since before you even met him.” his father reluctantly admitted.
Draco was sitting nervously in the Great Hall. Kat was chatting away to the left of him and Theo was on his right. He had no particular reason to be nervous, he just was.
Draco had never been more embarrassed.
Draco couldn’t do much. He was living with the Dark Lord himself, after all. But what little he could do, he did.
.” he whispered almost pleadingly.
was wrong. Nothing was secure. Nothing was safe.
Again, Macmillan nodded.
He knew that it would always protect him, that it would always keep him safe. The ring gave him the strength to carry on living.
The Hufflepuff's were living legends. The lot of them! He needed to see this, and he needed to see it right now.
Actually, he was disappointed in all of them. And here he was thinking he'd trained them better than that. Well, obviously he was wrong.
Draco felt pain.
It was the next day and Draco was surrounded by a bunch of Hufflepuff first years. Who’s idea was this again? Oh right, his.
Potter took an intake of breath, “it hurts so much.” He said with a shaky breath. “And I don’t know what to do. I don’t know why I feel like this. Why you make me feel like this. Hell, I don’t even know what I feel like, never mind what
Draco rose an eyebrow. He was fine. Well, except from the fact that he bore a mark of evil, was set an impossible task, hadn’t had one bloody idea on how to kill the old crow, hadn’t gone back to fix the vanishing cabinet until the start of term oh and let’s not forget this thing he had going on with Potter that he didn’t know what to do with.
“It wasn’t all that great before.” He started. “He didn’t much talk to me. He didn’t really interact with me. But at least he bloody well acknowledged my existence!” he huffed out.
Then, Severus Snape burst through, pointing his wand directly at the Headmaster. “
Draco chuckled, looking down at his miniature saviour. “And what exactly do we have here?” he teased.
“Why would I do that, anyone would take my flawless hands over your overworked ones.” He bit out innocently. “Although, I may take you up on your whole looking at myself in the mirror idea, I truly am something to be admired.” He uttered boastfully.
It was as if it had all come down to what he would say next. As if, his next few words were to be the decider. Draco was scared. He was afraid that he was going to mess up. So, he said the first thing that came to his mind. He couldn’t think, he just had to act.
Luna gave him a smile, “It’s not easy to be like us.” She commented.
He carefully opened the letter and his heart stopped.
He felt useless. Worn. Torn. He really was a puppet. But it wasn’t his father, no, it had been his aunt Bella all along.
Blaise chuckled. “Anyways, I should tell you that Kat’s been waiting for you outside the common room for the past several minutes.” He smirked deviously.
Potter looked at him expectantly, his foot tapping nervously beneath him. Draco remained silent.
“Keep to your side of the desk.” The Weasel snarled.
He edged closer toward it. Was that an upwards curve in the middle of the wood? He took a closer look. Was. The. Cabinet. Laughing. At. Him? Draco shook his head, of course not. He was being an idiot, cabinets didn’t laugh.
They stayed like that for several moments, before Potter pulled out of Draco, murmuring a cleaning spell before pulling him close. “Sleep.” He whispered softly and Draco hummed, feeling safer than he’d ever felt.
Draco never did hear what his father would do.
Pansy scoffed. “Come of Draco, even you have to admit that this is quite peculiar.” She mused.
He watched in glee as Hermione’s face turned a frustrated shade of red, “I can’t take it anymore!” she shouted in defeat.
Madam Pomfrey smiled at Kat. “As lovely as your war chants sound, Mr Malfoy has to rest.” She informed them pointedly and their faces fell.
They watched the sunrise that night, and many nights after that.
Blaise nodded. “That name does sound awfully familiar.” He gave Draco a sceptical glance, “how the bloody hell did you know that?” he asked and now it was Draco's turn to act smug.
someone.
His head falls back. He can’t think about anything but Potter’s touch. How it feels to have Potter need him so much.
Hope was the only thing stronger than fear. And if there’s no hope, then there’s only fear. And if there was only fear, then there was no reason to fight. And if there was no reason to fight, then it was over. And if it was over, then he had lost.
.” He cried out, as he wished that he were somewhere else. Anywhere but here.
Potter touches his lips to the silver scars on Draco’s chest, and then does a double take. “I did that?” he croaked out, his eyes filling with tears.
Maybe if he’d realised what a colossal jerk he was earlier then perhaps they would’ve become friends sooner. He definitely would’ve liked that he decided. He reasoned that she must be a beautiful person to forgive him after what he’d put her through. He reckoned that’s exactly what she was.
They were completely lost in one another. Every smell, every touch, every taste, was all Potter. Their tongues twirled fiercely together, as if fighting for dominance. His lips were red, hot, and enticing, and Draco couldn’t get enough of it, as he tugged on Potter’s hair pulling him even closer.
Draco did a double take. “What about me?” he asked sceptically.
Every single time he’d wanted out. Whenever he’d been so close to giving up. He’d kept going. A little voice in his head telling him to keep going. One that he couldn’t ignore.
So, Draco took a deep breath, laying his art things on the ground next to him, then doing the only thing he could do. He extended his arm over entwining his hand with Potter’s. He promptly ignored the warmth that gathered in the pits of his stomach.
He coughed loudly. “Anyways, the fact still remains that I wiggled my arse, like this.” He turned around shaking his arse with everything he had, before facing them once more, “in order to get you all to follow me.” He stated matter-of-factly.
He heaved himself up and tutted as his mother muttered a cleaning spell. “Well, if I wasn’t before then I am now.” he bit out sarcastically as his mother came to sit next to him.
Draco nodded, one hundred percent understanding his message.
Draco turned around and raised a brow in response.
Kat frowned. “Don’t you like them?” she pouted gesturing to her badge that read
was wrong with him? Why was he like this?
“It was if I’d gotten my best friend back.” She admitted softly.
“I know that I don’t deserve you. But you make me want to become a better person. To be the person that I know I can be. Someone I can love. Someone I can look up to. I want to be someone who stands up for what he believes in. Someone who’s not scared to do the right thing. I want to be that person. I wish more than anything, that I were that person.” Potter read, his voice starting to waver.
He smirked at Weasley, “So you finally came to your senses and realised that this one’s been crazy for you for years.” He joked gesturing to Hermione who promptly jabbed him in the stomach.
Suddenly, he stopped in his tracks, coming face to face with the last person he wanted to see. With someone he hated even more than he hated the Dark Lord. With the woman who killed Kat.
He took a deep breath, before plastering on a smile, looking up into the big brown eyes of
Kat nodded before she grinned widely. “I knew I could make you happy.” She cheered before sitting next to him.
He blinked back the tears. “Yes well, I have one and they need help on their project, so I’m bloody well helping them. Problem?” he sneered at the boy.
Ricky shrugged. “Well, I would like to take her on a picnic, and maybe buy her a box of those chocolates she liked so much.” He answered innocently.
She shook her head. “Don’t lie to me Draco.” she chastised, and Draco felt his stomach start to sink.
“And I said no.” Potter bit out defiantly stepping even closer towards him.
Jerry gave him a confused look, “But you don’t have a lot of friends Draco.” he said almost innocently.
Potter sighed. “Why didn’t you stay to watch the sunrise?” he asked. “Why did you leave me? Don’t you care?” he asked again his voice cracking.
His aunt gave him an encouraging pat on the back. “So, the question is, what would you do if you had no fear?” she asked and Draco finally knew.
Draco felt his heart give out a small squeeze. “I came back to Hogwarts with the intent of doing just that. Of being all that I was supposed to be.” He chuckled, “One look at you, and all that changed.” No, no, NO. He couldn't say things like that. Not like this. Not now.
Draco had ‘bumped’ into Potter more times than he could count, and it was only midday. He’d didn’t rather fancy bring up the consequence that Potter’s stalking had on the little task the Dark Lord had set him.
. He thought before packing away his things and walking back to the castle without a word.
That’s all that mattered. That’s all he cared about. He bore it so she didn’t have to.
Weasley turned towards him, and Draco froze. No, no, no! He
Draco carried on laughing. “I’m sorry, it’s just—” he tried again but was deeply unsuccessful.
Weasley’s face paled, and Hermione sent him a grateful look.
He had to try.
Draco chuckled. “I assure you that I’m not stealing your Hufflepuff's.” He made a mental note. Stealing Hufflepuff's. That actually wasn't a bad idea.
“All done then?” Theo asked and Draco nodded.
“Thank you Weasley.” Draco acknowledged.
“Stupefy!” Draco yelled, knocking the Death Eater out cold, before quickly putting him into a body bind. He wouldn’t be escaping any time soon.
This was definitely my favourite chapter to write by far! I absolutely love Ron! And the Hufflepuff army squad are adorable! I don't condone Harry's actions but I wanted to show the why to the what.
He smiled in understanding. “Well, I’m not sure what that has to do with it, but I promise that I don’t want to hurt you.” He tried his best to come off as sincere as he felt.
“Don’t
“Potter…please.” He starts to beg in between sobs. “I want you inside me. I need you to come inside me.” He pleaded. Potter adds a third finger and Draco almost black out. He’s sucking him again and again, and he’s full, so, so full, so good.
been Potter
Why was it always Potter? Why did everyone always assume that it was Potter? It infuriated him.
real. It had always been real, even when Draco didn't want it to be. Something would simply just stop being real because he determined it to be. It didn't work like that.
Draco glanced at Hermione briefly, her wounds seemed to be recovering nicely. Well, everything but that hideous scar. Certain that she would awaken soon with strength, he got up and ran into the battle.
She fixed her gaze onto her lap. “Because he doesn’t like me like that.” She mumbled.
“I hate it. I hate it so much. I just want it to stop. I want everything to stop.” He howled in pain.
And for the first time, he realised that the darkness was needed. That it was the one thing that drove them. For the light was a good thing, but stars could only shine in the dark.
Giving your heart wholly to another, that had to be the scariest thing that he’d ever have to do. If he’d ever be brave enough to do it.
Suddenly, a rouge hex flew past Draco’s head, and he quickly looked up, raising his wand in defence. The battle continued.
“Bollocks!” Blaise muttered before following him out.
“Kat, I don’t know what to say.” He choked out.
She scoffed, “don’t act dumb with me Draco Malfoy. I’m not one of your little Hufflepuff’s who blindly believe all that you tell them.” She warned.
With all the strength that he could muster, Draco took a small step forwards. “I have some news regarding the whereabouts of your daughter. May I please come in?” he choked out, willing himself to remain clam and strong.
The castle had ears, he was certain of it.
He carried on, “I didn’t know what I was doing or saying. I just knew that you were gone. And I didn’t know how to handle that. You seriously don’t know how much I need you.” he admitted and Draco wanted to scream. Potter didn't need him. He shouldn't need him. Draco was bad for Potter. He was dangerous.
Blaise clasped his shoulder gently, “Draco, you’re my best friend. I know you better than you know yourself. What ever problem you have with yourself, I want you to know that it’s okay. I’m here for you and we’ll get through it.” He smiled and Draco was taken back by the seriousness in his tone. Blaise was never serious.
She smiled and him knowingly, “I know exactly what you’re doing. I’ve seen this many times before.” She commented.
Potter must have sensed his confused state because his features became very serious. As if the middle of a bloody battle wasn’t already the appropriate place to at serious.
After several moments, a painful hissing rung through his ears.
Wow... that was cheesy. He
Great, just great. He knew that there was a strong possibility of this happening. After all, what kid was going to believe that big, bad Death Eaters were after them. Especially when it was coming from the son of a renowned Death Eater.
“Really? I would’ve put you down for more of a pug than a pig.” He joked and she jabbed him in his side. “Ouch.” He said whilst peering closer at her, “you know, since you mentioned it, I do think you could pass for a bit of a pig. Your nose is very pig-like. Don’t you agree Pansy darling?”
He blinked. “What?” he asked.
Kat giggled, “I’m pretty sure you’re doing
Yes, he had been banned from the battle.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Oh, ha bloody ha.” He bit out, “just for that you’re off my Christmas present list.” He snapped. And if Blaise thought he was lying, well... he'd have a shock come Christmas morning.
He's not crazy! Was he actually that idiotic? That's exactly what a crazy person would say. He decided that wasn't far from the truth either. He
“Go get Pansy to suck yours.” Weasley fumed.
Draco felt the air leave his lungs. His head was spinning, his heart was beating painfully within his chest. Everything hurt.
Mr and Mrs Weasley had also to his surprise testified on his behalf, claiming that he was one of the most beautiful souls that they had ever come across. Mr Weasley had told the court about his fascination with muggle technology, stating that a heartless Death Eater wouldn’t dare be so obsessed with muggle things. He’d even brought the toasterer as evidence. Mrs Weasley had further commented on his actions during the final battle, disclosing the moment they’d had together as well as times he’d fought for the light. After they’d finished their testimonies, they’d both sent him warm, loving smiles which he greatly appreciated.
Draco grinned. “But I find everything funny.” He reasoned, because everything was just that little bit better when viewed as satirical.
Mass production of
Draco shook his head. “They are platonic.” He hoped his words didn't sound as shaky as they did to his won ears.
Fluff, fluff, and more fluff!
The first thing that Draco noticed about Azkaban was that it was cold. Although it was only the end of the summer, it felt as if it were the middle of winter!
“Where do you think you’re going, Mr Malfoy?” she warned.
He sighed; he didn’t have time for this. He carried on walking.
His family and he were still under heavy surveillance by the other Death Eater’s. They were still seen as soft, condemned by all. Draco letting the Death Eater’s into Hogwarts had spared their lives, his failure in assassinating his Headmaster and cost them their freedom.
Once again comments and kudos are much appreciated! They keep me writing :)
And Slytherin’s were cowards.
“But it’s my fault. It’s all my fault.” He choked out through tears, as he was engulfed into Ms Pritchett’s strong arms.
He shook his head, smiling through the tears. “It’s not goodbye.” He told her determinedly. “It’s just see you later.” He promised.
He hadn’t completely lost Draco, not yet.
thing that he wasn't getting. Oh yes. Sleep!
Severus growled. “Not everything is a joke, you idiotic boy.” So, he was idiotic and foolish, oh bother! Severus had forgotten devilishly good looking and charming. He'd have to tell him so that Severus could use it in one of their future little talks.
“Was it Potter?” Theo questioned hesitantly; Draco nodded. Theo let out a sigh laced with deep acceptance. “It’s always been Potter, hasn’t it?” he came to a conclusion that Draco found hard to accept, but a part of him had always known.
alive. He hadn’t planned for this.
how you should feel about him.” she spat.
“Hugging you?” Potter said as if It were the most obvious thing in the world. “I’ve missed you so much. I’ve been up every night, just pleading that you was okay. That I’d see you again.” He started and Draco blinked in bafflement.
“Anyways,” Blaise perked up. “Why ruin a little girl with your absmayl makeup skills.” He remarked. “You look hideous, darling.” He mocked. Sadly, Draco couldn't help but agree.
He shook his head. “Not at all. Is it surprising? Yes. Stupid? No chance in hell.” He reassured her.
He sighed, knowing one think for certain. He’d left the manor in an attempt to clear his head but will return with his thoughts more scrambled than ever before.
lying about the portkey, I’m not lying about the Death Eater’s. You’d be dead either way.” he stated firmly, reasoning that part was entirely true.
“There’s nothing wrong with you Draco.” She assured him.
Severus sighed defeatedly before releasing him. “When did you become so reckless?” he commented showing as much emotion as Severus Snape could possibly manage.
His mother was huddled into a corner, complete discomfort plastered onto her sleeping features. His father was siting next to him, wide awake, deep in fury. For once, Draco understood the emotion on the elder Malfoy’s face, the act was nothing but mortifying.
His father came from behind him, begging and pleading with him to be sure. Draco ignored him. He was far too focused on the ring pulsing from beneath him, filling him with an indescribable warmth. He felt safe, he felt free.
was making their way down the hall to perhaps help him.
Potter would come back to him. He would
All Draco wanted to do was plan his Headmaster’s demise in peace. Was that too bloody much to ask?
Blaise grinned. “Good. Anyhow, I know you like dick, but have you seen the tits on Greengrass this year? I’m worried she’s going to fall over they probably weigh that much.” He babbled on and Draco smiled a rare smile.
With a heavy heart he pulled out his wand, it felt empty in his hands.
Well, obviously they didn’t. Oh no, they’d all made it their secret missions to baffle him to the point that there was no return. It was all extremely rude if you asked him.
Draco scoffed. “Yes, she is. She’s
Abruptly, he stood up muttering his apologies before running out the door straight towards the apparition point, ignoring the concerned shouts and objections that he had left behind.
The Weaselette had sneered at him.
Draco looked up at him in alarm. “This. Us. You!” he frantically spat, gesturing his arms between them.
Snape shook his head, “This isn’t up for discussion.” He snarled before exiting the hall in a fit of robes, gesturing for Draco to follow.
Potter stopped right in front of Draco, and his heart split in two, he felt sick to his stomach. “And you.” Potter spat and Draco’s cheeks started to heat up.
He huffed. “Yes, you bloody well are and you know it. We both know the real reason you’ve been ignoring me.” Draco remained silent; his eyes glued to his shoes.
Hermione glared. “Oh Ronald. I can’t even with you anymore.” She bit out, giving him a look that deemed him a helpless child.
Seriously, his hair was a literal dump upon his head. He instinctively raked a hand through his locks. They were better. But not good enough. His haircastrophe had been quite alright during the war, it had given him the broken soldier kind of look. But the war was over. All he wanted was a prestige, ‘my hair’s better than yours’ look. Was that too much to ask?
Draco would rather pet a blooming hippogriff than tell her anything. He was fine for fucks sake. Just fine.
“Harry Potter is
Draco sat alone at the Slytherin table.
Weasley took a deep intake of breath. “You know I still don’t like Malfoy all that much.” He decided. “But Draco. Now he’s someone I could find myself becoming friends with.” He offered with a smile.
go over to the Dark Lord’s side. He would
He knocked the door three times anxiously, dread pooling in the pits of his stomach. A ghost like woman opened the door. Her face was pale, her once presumably thick, brown hair was thin and matted. Her eyes were hollow with dark grey bags lining them. She looked broken. She looked defeated.
“But that’s three days away.” Jerry complained and Draco wanted to strangle him. The boy Just. Did. Not. Shut. Up!
“What are you doing here?” Draco asked in pure disbelief.
“I’m sorry,” she blabbed hysterically, “please don’t hurt me.” she begged.
“But you’re miserable darling.” Pansy stated knowingly as they sat in the drawing room of the manor. A platter of tea, sandwiches and biscuits were sitting quietly between them.
Draco clicked his tongue, “So are you planning on releasing me anytime soon?” he asked.
“I love you, and I let you go.” Draco whispered as the love of his life disappeared in a puff of smoke and a flicker of a green light.
Potter shook his head violently. “Then I’m staying with you. I don’t care what happens to me. As long as were together.”
Draco turned away embarrassed. “You don’t mean that.” He muttered softly.
The boy frantically shook his head. “No, she’s okay.” He assured him, “well I think that she’s okay, do you think anything’s happened to her?” he cried out.
There was no hope. There was officially no hope. Blaise would forever be vain and doomed to a life of isolation and unhappiness. And right now, Draco couldn't say that he actually gave a fuck.
Draco nodded, still immersed in his investigating. “Yes, the bread.” He answered with disinterest, “it’s called a toasterer.” He added.
Potter sighed. “Then please Draco, just tell me what’s wrong.” He begged, and Draco snapped.
Draco knew that he should stick up for himself. That he should stop ignoring Potter during their talks. But he couldn’t. Deep down he knew that he deserved it. That Potter had every right to berate him after all the years Draco had antagonized him. He couldn’t talk to Potter during their meetings or even attempt to interact with him. If he did, then he’d be allowing himself a pleasure that he couldn’t accept. He was a Death Eater and Death Eater’s didn’t deserve nice things.
They all laughed and dissolved into mindless chatter. Draco was watching them contently, joining in when necessary, when Kat came and pulled him into a hug.
That had resulted in him bringing food to the prisoner’s only at night. On the rare occasions that he was caught, he’d crucio them. Well, by crucio he’d say the words as they skilfully pretended to writher in unbearable pain. Every prisoner was taught how to successfully fake a crucioing on their first night at the Manor.
But of course, it was. Because all of Potter’s problems were Draco’s fault. And you know what, maybe he was right. Maybe they were. It made sense in a twisted way.
Once again, this was something that he needed to bare alone. He couldn't burden anyone else with his problems. Especially Potter.
Crabbe chuckled unkindly, “we don’t have to do what you say anymore. Your father isn’t as bad as he used to be Malfoy.” He hissed and Goyle nodded.
Macmillan shook his head, “don’t worry, I’m not going to babble. Mainly because babbling is bad and makes no sense at all. I mean really? Why do people babble. Are they scared? Are they confused? Do they—”
Potter’s eyes shone with tears, “I don’t know what to say, no one has ever done anything like this for me before.” He said through tears. “Thank you, thank you so much.” He cried and Draco grimaced, Potter shouldn’t be thanking him just yet, he thought as he gestured to the second sheet of paper.
Her features lit up slightly, as she took a wistful breath. “Like he’s everything.” She said exasperatedly. “He’s funny. He’s thoughtful. He doesn’t treat me like I’m some freak, or that I’m any different to anybody else. He laughs whenever I crack a rare joke. He comforts me when I’m sad.” She sighed. “I think I might love him.” she admitted.
It was beautiful.
“You want to know what’s wrong?” he spat and Potter’s eyes widened in concern. “My mother is weak. The man I’ve admired for my entire life is nothing but a deadbeat, idiotic fool who doesn’t care for me.” He bit out. “And let’s not forget the fact that I’m a Death Eater who’s dating Harry Potter, who may I add that I don’t deserve in the slightest.” He growled.
It was his guilty pleasure. If his father ever found out, then well, Draco didn’t want to think about that.
Severus shrugged giving Draco a demanding glare. “Then why haven’t you fixed the cabinet? Why haven’t you killed the Headmaster?” He asked and Draco frantically searched for an exuse.
Draco took a deep breath. He had to stay calm, he couldn’t break. He had to remain strong for Kat. “Helped me?” he whispered brokenly.
“Then what are you talking about?” he challenged.
it was.
Although, he had to admit. He'd be an amazing trophy wife. Just gorgeous. The potential. Oh! The potential.
Potter crouched down next to him. “No, it’s called a toaster.” He repeated for a second time.
“There you bloody well are!” Weasley exclaimed as Draco entered the classroom. “I thought that your Hufflepuff fan club had kidnapped you of something.” He added.
There may or may not have been a teeny bit of angst squeezed within all that fluff. I couldn't help it, I live for ANGST! So, that was my first time writing smut... was it any good? Draco/Muggle Appliances/Sausages is life!!! A lil teaser for next Chapter: The calm before the storm....
“Don’t worry Draco, we’ll come with you and help.” She decided, gesturing for the rest of the Hufflepuff's to follow her.
“But how do you expect me to trust a Death Eater?” he spat and Draco’s heart clenched.
“I’m not.” he spat defiantly.
Draco thought silently.
His reaction was quite funny actually. Weasley truly believed that he had a say in the matter. It was both unfortunate for him and so terribly amusing for Draco.
What was his aunt talking about? What push?
Potter took a sharp intake of breath, frantically shaking his head. “No. No. No. No. NO!” Potter shouted. “Draco, No. Why?” he cried.
This was harder than he'd ever imagined. He thought that knowing what he was going to do would make things easier. Would soften the blow. He was wrong. He'd never been so wrong.
. A hissing voice echoed throughout his head that he knew to be the Dark Lord.
But at the same time, they were so different. He’d been raised by the Dursleys, and even though they’d been less than good, at least he knew they hadn’t loved him. At first it had been a tough pill to swallow. They were his family. He wanted them to love him, so, so much. But they hadn’t and he was so thankful for that, because if they had, he knew that he would’ve turned out just like them.
Potter smiled at him, leaning in to give him a quick peck on the lips. “Whatchya thinking about?” he asked.
“Don’t even joke about crap like that.” Pansy growled angrily and he couldn't blame her.
Draco took an abrupt step back as if burned. “I’m sorry.” He said. “I’m so, so sorry.” He babbled incomprehensively before leaving the common room ignoring Theo’s desperate pleas to come back.
you communicating with me?” he huffed.
“Is it?” Draco asked, albeit shyly. It wasn't okay to be sad. It was never okay to be sad. It left one too open, to vulnerable. Something that he couldn't afford to be.
He nodded before unfolding the gift. His eyes became blurry with tears as he stared down at a muggle photograph of the two of them. They were sitting at their favourite tree, Kat was staring up at him in wonder as he spoke passionately about something, a huge smile lighting up his features.
Weasley nodded. “Fair enough.” He shuffled slightly in his seat. “If anything, though it’s Mione and me who should be apologising.” He said honestly.
She nodded. “I’m certain of it. It’s us three for life.” She gave him a smile.
He took a deep breath, deciding that at this point there was only one thing that he could do. The one and only thing that would bring him peace of mind.
“Don’t shoot. Don’t shoot.” Theo held his hands up in a joking manner.
He’s just merely extremely realistic. Blaise just can’t handle his truths. It was quite so very sad if you asked Draco.
“I kissed him. I kissed him.” Draco repeated deliriously from the edge of Theo’s bed. He’d run all the way there after ‘the incident’ with Potter, he felt that even if Draco couldn’t give himself wholly to Theo, then least he could do was give him the truth.
He was laying atop of his bed in the Slytherin dorms, thinking about his pathetic, pathetic life. When suddenly, Potter burst through the doors, dramatically lying down on Draco’s bed. What was he doing here? And how the hell did he know the password to get in?
In the meantime, Weasley and Hermione had appeared behind Potter, them both shooting him concerned looks. He knew that they just wanted to help him, but their somewhat helpful looks weren’t helping his current situation.
Macmillan turned a deep shade of crimson. “Besides, I’d never be able to score the girl I like with him around.” He stated, and Draco was yet again surprised.
She sat with Blaise who sent him a few confused looks, which left him with no one else to sit with but Crabbe and Goyle. Not that he minded too much, unbeknownst to most, Crabbe and Goyle were actually pretty decent to be around. Besides, it prevented him from having to sit next to Theo. The man harboured a crush on Draco as big as the Dark Lord’s forehead and believe him it was big. He should know.
“I don’t know Pans,” he admitted, “I thought I needed time to sort out all these crazy feelings I have for Potter. But I’m not so sure anymore. I mean, do you know how hard it is to be in love with someone you can’t remember falling in love with?” he prompted.
her.” she whispered again. “For the first time in a long time I had my little girl back. So, thank you. Thank you for giving me back my daughter.” She said in pure gratitude, and it was Draco’s turn to pull the woman closer.
How could she say that? How could she lie like that? Was it meant to reassure him, or make him feel better? Well, it didn't. No, he just felt worse.
They had? He was the one that was actually in the relationship, he surely would've noticed if that were the case, right?
It was stupid. He knew it was. Potter would never read the letters. He didn’t even want Potter to read the letters. That was the furthest thing from his mind. It was an outlet. Someone to speak to that hardly knew him. Who didn’t know who Draco really was.
He loosened his tie as soon as he entered Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom, approaching the sink and splashing water onto his pale face.
“Like I’ve been splinched.”
Pansy and Blaise acted distant whenever he mentioned Potter. When he’d first spoken about him on the first day of their seventh year, they’d both looked at him with pained expressions. As if they knew something that he didn’t. It was all terribly off putting.
He narrowed his eyes at his father, “how do you know it’s about Potter?” he questioned.
But yes, he was fine.
Scars weren’t marks of a survivor; they were the mark of a man who’d forgotten how to live.
Hermione took a deep breath, “All I’m hearing is that he doesn’t remember you.” She started and Harry opened his mouth to tell her that, yes that was the point, but she quickly cut him off. “He doesn’t hate you. Or is going against you. He hasn’t fallen out of love with you. The Draco that you know is still in there.
Potter held up his arms in defeat. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to annoy you.” He said honestly. “It’s just you never draw this early in the morning by yourself, unless there’s something wrong.” He argued.
been a choice. He didn’t have to kill her. No, he could’ve shown her mercy. She’d be rotting in Azkaban right about now, but at least she’d still be alive. At least he wouldn’t be a murderer.
Draco assessed the situation. He could lie, but what would he say? Defeated, he settled for the truth. “I’m going to the Great Lake.” He replied.
Draco could do nothing but stare into the distance. It was no secret that his aunt had been a horrible person, but he’d killed her. He’d killed her with a vengeance, just like she’d done to Kat.
Draco shook his head. “nothing.” He bit out.
She gave him the biggest grin known to all of wizarding kind, which he returned. He was just about to help himself to another slice of toast when he abruptly stopped.
He knew he shouldn’t. He wasn’t stupid. He knew that Potter treated him like shit during the day. But at night, at night Potter spoke to him like he was a fucking human being. And Draco needed it. He needed it so much.
Blaise’s eyes softened slightly, taking in the distressed state of his best friend. “Fine.” He held up his hands in surrender, “but I’d give him a chance if I were you, he really likes you.” he attempted to be convincing.
Did he want to give his blessing? No, not really. Did he want to hex the small boy into next year? Definitely. Was Draco going to act like a mature adult? Sadly.
Draco nodded. “Don’t act oblivious, father. It’s not a good look on you.” he told him bravely, and the look on his father's face had made it
He shook his head, standing up quickly, “I’ve just remembered the transfiguration essay that I haven’t yet completed. McGonagall is going to chop my balls off.” He had to admit, but he really liked his balls. And he meant
“Then why
What could he possibly say to that? It was raw, vulnerable, loving, and Draco could say absolutely nothing. He wanted to say something.
He sniffled, taking a deep breath before pulling up his sleeve. Pansy gasped when she saw the mark, her eyes welling with tears.
So, Draco did.
Blaise shrugged. “You never asked.” He said simply and Draco glared at him before stomping off.
That small piece of paper meant so much. It symbolised and determined so many things. It was the only thing that could perhaps save them all. It made it all
He attempted to make her see reason. “But the Muggleborn’s.” he started. “I can’t help them. I’ve tried, but I can’t deliver the portkey’s there’s not enough time.” He sniffed, how low his odds were finally sinking in.
“Thank you, but I’m fine.” He said robotically.
Another cry erupted, louder and more pained this time. He shivered remembering the first time this had happened and he’d come face to face with a crying Kat. Stopping, he thought, had been one of the best decisions of his life.
Tears were running freely down Draco’s face. “I’m sorry.” He offered Longbottom, no,
He thought of his mother locked up in the Manor, scared out of her wits. He thought of his father locked up in Azkaban fighting to get out and back to his family. Draco sighed, he bore it, so they didn’t have to.
Perhaps you really did fall in love with the most unexpected people at the most unexpected time.
Draco secretly agreed because if the past week had shown him anything, it was that Potter was nothing but transparent.
Kat smiled. “That’s great news Draco!” she beamed. “Then why are you sad?” she questioned.
Draco didn’t know for how long he’d ran, but he came to a stop inside a little alcove. He pressed up against the wall, with the intention of catching his breath. He was slowly coming to the opinion that maybe having that extra sausage at breakfast hadn’t been one of his brightest moments.
If Draco was a stronger man he would’ve done just that but alas, he wasn’t. He was pathetic. He knew, deep, deep down that Potter had already been forgiven, even before he’d apologised.
Draco blinked, as he frantically darted around to find that he had suddenly forgotten how to breathe. His aunt was looming over Hermione, a manic glint residing in her eyes.
“You know you can’t do that. Please think rationally.” Pansy begged him, tears slipping freely from her cheeks.
She had smiled at that and then persisted to ask, “and did you or did you not demand that he do just that even though he had originally refused?” to which Draco once again replied with a simple “Yes”.
Potter shook his head. “I don’t want to take this outside. No, I want the bloody world to hear.” He spat, his eyes wide, pupils blown.
He beamed at her. “Thank you, you’re amazing.” He said genuinely, staring to feel himself tire even more.
They all nodded enthusiastically and Draco took a moment to notice the bright purple badges flashing on all of their robes. Draco’s eyes widened in mortification.
Sorry for the slightly later update! Another update will be posted either later on today or tomorrow morning :)
it was. The same old Lucius Malfoy that he’d always known and right now only conditionally loved.
Draco smiled sadly, “that’s my mother.”
The last thing he saw was Potter’s broken face before everything went black.
Kat shook her head, with strong force. “Not that good?” she questioned, “Draco, they’re so wonderful.” She proclaimed, slowly turning the pages of his sketchbook, her hand stopped on a portrait of his mother.
He mocked laughed at her. “I want you two to bloody acknowledge what you’ve done. To realise how good everything was before you intervened. To see how badly, you’ve both messed this up.” He choked out.
“If you must. Arthur will love it.” he assured Draco and that just made him feel a million times more confident. He wanted to make a good impression on the Weasley's.
Green eyes met grey as Potter stared right back at him. He raised a defiant eyebrow, his lips curling into a twisted snarl. Draco sighed; he was disappointed but not surprised. He thought that just maybe things had changed between them last night. Evidently, he was wrong.
Draco’s eyes softened. “Of course I’m happy to see you, I was just a bit surprised that’s all.” he admitted quickly, not wanting to upset the girl further.
“Well then. I guess it’s time for you to leave.” Theo almost ordered.
With a sigh, Draco got up to leave, but was stopped when Potter’s arm latched onto his pulling him close.
Harry sighed as he threaded his finger through the ring that he kept so close. Through teary eyes, he looked back into the nights sky. He knew his parents were up there watching over him, and deep down he knew they were doing the same
Piggy looked up at him with wide eyes, full of determination. “They mess with you, then they mess with me.” She growled, waving her wand around in threat.
“I know you don’t remember.” Potter whispered against his lips. “But I do, and I’d be a fool to ever give you up Draco Malfoy.” He admitted before quickly fleeing the room without so much as a second glance.
Potter’s eyes gleamed. “Do you mean this?” He smirked producing a turny breaky thing. Draco clapped enthusiastically, before snatching it from him.
Draco turned round to face him, startled. “I can’t find the bread.” He said simply, diverting his attention back onto the appliance.
He sighed, stirring the potion a couple of times. “I’m not sure.” He answered dishonestly, “perhaps I’ve decided it not appropriate to insult others for pleasure anymore.”
Kat’s eyes glossed over and her lower lip wobbled, “Are you sure?” she wavered.
Theo’s nostrils flared, his hands shaking with anger. “And how do you know that?” he questioned harshly, and Draco's heart squeezed a little.
He couldn’t understand what they saw. His nose was too pointy, his hair was too light. He was too skinny; his eyes were sunken and grey. His foul mouth, twisted beliefs and cruel actions did nothing to complement his looks.
He was currently sitting on his ’throne’, visibly shaking. Potter’s outburst a few moments ago was unexpected and had completely rattled him. He didn’t know what to say or do. It was too much. It was all too much.
“Does he
“Can I bring my toasterer?” he asked hopefully.
“That’s right.” she squeezed his hand tightly. “So please darling, tell me who’s broken the heart that I took so long to make.”
Draco breathed out dramatically. “Really Blaise? You act as if I’m not best friends with an eleven-year-old muggle girl.” He said matter-of-factly.
Draco opened his mouth to object but was cut by Weasley. “Yeah mum, Malfoy’s some sort of
Pansy shook her head. “I don’t blame him the girl is stunning. She’d look even better if I gave her that makeover I told you about.” She asked hopefully, giving him a pointed look.
Draco chuckled. “Where exactly are we going?” he asked.
condone the soft kitten that you’ve turned my son into.” Draco sneaked a glance at his husband who was trying and failing to suppress a laugh.
“She has a point, mate.” Weasley stated and they all nodded in agreement.
“What’s wrong with me? Why won’t you talk to me.” Because
He sighed, carefully sealing the letter in an envelope that was never to be opened. It scared him. How much he needed these letters. How they kept him fighting. How they kept him living. He mused that the reason behind this wasn’t Potter. It could’ve been anyone. It just so happened to be Potter.
“Don’t you think you’re being just a little bit dramatic Draco?” she asked gently.
Theo sighed. “You’re right. I’m sorry.” Draco nodded in acceptance. “So, what’s going on between you and Potter?” He asked hesitantly.
like you.” He said honestly.
Why was Potter doing this to him? Why was he saying these things? Words that meant so much. Words he couldn't take back. Words that gave him
Fair play, it was perhaps a tad idiotic to trust a stranger. But Draco wasn't any old stranger, no he was the Prince of Slytherin.
He smiled. “I know so.” He promised.
She shrugged. “That doesn’t matter anyways.” She brushed him off with a wave of her hand.
Draco nodded and Theo gave a beaming smile.
This was torture. This was actual torture. He couldn’t understand how muggles actually did this. Were they sure that they weren’t wizards? This was virtually impossible.
And Kat. Sweet, little, adorable Kat. They were attached from the hip. There wasn’t Draco if Kat weren’t there to guide and help him. She’d even dyed her hair Slytherin green just a couple of days ago, and Draco couldn’t be prouder of his Slytherpuff.
“I want to understand it. Help me to understand it.” He almost begged.
know that it was Snape’s book that he was using. Draco couldn’t bare to think what Potter would do if he found out. Oh well, what he doesn’t know won’t hurt him.
“I became happy because of you.” She started “And I know that you’re even sadder then I’ve ever been.” She stated and Draco was amazed.
Potter pulled him into an embrace, “I love you. I’m so in love with you, I can’t even think about being with anyone else. You’ve ruined me. Nothing you do or say will ever change the fact that I’ll only ever want to be with you.” He promised.
He couldn’t hear anything but the tiny voice in his head telling him that maybe she was right.
They all squealed murmuring a chorus of ‘thank you Draco’s’ and Draco smiled at them before making his was towards the Slytherin table.
He had just finished handing out all of the portkey’s. All but
To say that his introduction at the Burrow had been unusual, then that was an understatement.
“So, what are you doing here?” he asked as they made their way down the alley.
Smith burst into puffs of laughter, “I don’t care.” He said defiantly.
He took a deep breath, “I don’t know. I seriously don’t know anymore.” He attempted to walk away, but Potter caught his arm, bring Draco closer towards him.
One that if executed correctly would potentially aid the wizarding world. Successful or not, his plan only meant heartbreak for Draco.
He’d at first managed to get into a spectacular row with Pansy. It was on nothing that particularly peaked his interest. She’d been annoyed at the lack of attention he’d given herself and the other Slytherins that morning and the previous evening. Personally, he thought it a pathetic reason to be upset.
Draco felt a sudden surge of protectiveness. “Why? What did they do?” he questioned.
He coughed. “I’m fine.” He repeated again and the Headmaster’s eyes flashed with disappointment before returning back to their naturally warm state.
He rolled his eyes, “go on, hate on the guy that’s trying to help.” He snapped.
Kat started to cry hot, wet, tears. “No, I don’t want to see you later. I want to see you now.” she wailed, pulling him into a hard hug.
“No!” he said a little too quickly and Theo frowned. “Sorry, I just really need a bit of time for myself.” He said hoping that it was an acceptable answer.
Draco looked at her confused. She carried on, “someone stupid would let their emotions guide their every action, but someone brave would renounce everything they believe in to save somebody that they loved. It doesn’t mean that their beliefs or the right thing isn’t important, it just means that they’re human.” He wanted to believe her. He desperately wanted to believe her.
Theo huffed. “You’re even defending him!” he pointed out. “Draco Lucius Malfoy defending perfect Potter, how can you defend him, then tell me that things between you two are just platonic?” he almost demanded.
He had his answer. Maybe justice and revenge were two different thing. Perhaps, justice wasn’t revenge and revenge wasn’t justice. But sometimes…. Just sometimes, they coexisted together in perfect harmony.
He nodded. “Of course.” He started to lead her through the battle, “now lets get you to safety.” He stated, pulling her tight and keeping her safe.
Pansy looked as if she were about to kill him. “I’ll show you hideous.” She threatened, pulling her wand out and advancing onto him.
So, he lied.
Draco Malfoy wasn’t a bad person; he was the strongest person that Harry had ever known.
He looked up, nodding his head in a cordial fashion, “Father.” He replied stoically, in somewhat of a greeting.
Draco was in the Slytherin common room. Alone.
Damn it! This guy didn’t seem like a threat at all. In fact, he seemed like the perfect candidate for Kat’s heart.
“We just thought you’d like to know that you are no longer the Slytherin Prince.” She snarled; her pug eyes gleaming. “You’ve been dethroned.” She added for good measure.
“That would be great.” He answered and she beamed and immediately started to lecture him on the properties of a common healing potion.
He saw the lifeless figures of Mr Lupin and what appeared to be his wife, his cousin, their bodies broken and crumpled, lying side by side. In that moment, Draco felt horrible for his past behaviour towards his teacher. He’d never apologised. He never would get to apologise. That realisation tore at what was left of his heart.
Okay, so just maybe Draco had taken things a little too far. But wasn't that the point of life? To push boundaries that were meant to remain fixed. As far as he was concerned, his comments were a gift to society.
Weasley rolled his eyes. “Oh, ha bloody ha Malfoy. A chicken date is not something to be joked about.” He gazed into the distance dreamily. “Biting into that juicy, succulent chicken breast, your mouth full of it’s juices. Oh yes, that’s heaven.” He breathed.
“Petrificus totalus!” he shouted at the distracted Death Eater who promptly fell to the floor, completely paralysed.
Whether he wanted it nor not, it was his.
“Well, I don’t wake up every day to impress you with my commentary.” He huffed before walking towards the gates. As he got to the lock, he stopped, before turning back to face the amused girl.
“Don’t understand what?” he enquired.
Draco had no words to describe how good the shower had been. Potter’s hands were just… well, a gentleman never tells.
Draco wanted to tell her that he was tired. That for the longest time something hadn’t been right with him. Like he’d forgotten something and he couldn’t remember what.
Pansy let out a small tear. “If you truly want to be happy, you’ll grab Potter and never let him go.” She finished and he nodded.
He squealed in delight, “So you’re giving me your blessing?” he asked hopefully.
you. I fucking love you so much, but I hate you. I still hate you.” He threw his hands into the air in frustration, pacing in front of Potter.
“And you get a present. And you get a present. And you get a present.” Draco bellowed enthusiastically to a herd of beaming Hufflepuff’s.
Draco felt a single tear roll down his cheek as he pulled her closer, hoping that the moment never had to end.
Draco made his way through the castle, half-running, half-sprinting. He hoped he wasn’t late. He couldn’t be.
He said the only thing that he could. “I’m sorry.” Draco choked out. “I’m so, so sorry.” He put his head in his hands, shaking with sobs. Shame rushing though him, making him dizzy.
“So, are you going to expose me to the matter regarding Potter that is so obviously causing you to act like a petulant, self-pitying idiot?” His father asked and Draco rolled his eyes.
Infiltrating Draco's brain, completely breaking his Slytherin side. It was rude, so very
“No, you don’t!” He howled pulling abruptly away from her. “You can’t understand. Nobody understands.” He cried.
He could see them.
Smith screeched and Draco smiled. “Be your own man!” Draco jeered. “Be the happy Hufflepuff I know you to be.”
She shot him a smile before rising to her feet. “Well then, I think I might just do that.” She eyed him contemplatively, “I still don’t like you Malfoy.” She declared. “But thank you.” She said sincerely.
He shook his head. “It’s not the same. It’s not the same. Can’t you see?” He cried out. “I have to protect her. I have to protect her.” he choked out repeatedly for good measure.
Potter to understand. “You can’t bloody help. No one can help.” He spat out deliriously.
She shook her head. “Yes, but he almost killed you.” She pointed out.
(See the end of the chapter for
Frantically, he jumped up from his seat, shooting daggers at Potter. “What the actual
Draco looked up, taking in his apologetic features. He nodded, before returning his gaze back onto his work.
Blaise huffed. “Mad. He’s absolutely mad.” he commented a bit too loudly.
Potter smiled putting his arms around Draco, “don’t get mad” he started hesitantly and Draco glared at him, this couldn’t be good. “but I may or may not have accepted Mrs Weasley’s Christmas dinner invitation on your behalf.” He stammered out and Draco hit him.
“I’m not even going to pretend that’s not creepy mate.” He tutted.
Hermione looked up at him with troubled eyes. “I don’t condone his actions at all. But you’ve got to understand, he’s not being himself at all.” she tried to offer him and Draco could laugh at the excuse.
“You know what you are?” he queried in between hexes “You Macmillan are a measly follower, grow some bloody balls. Or you can borrow some of mine, I’ve got more than enough.”
He didn't have time for this. He was tired. He was so fucking tired. Stupid Hufflepuff's and their adorable faces, full of want and need. Draco could really do without the glitter in his hair.
potions freak. It’s mad, it is.” He boasted and Draco could literally see the daggers that Mrs Weasley was shooting his way.
“But how can you say that, after everything I’ve done?” he whispered.
He bit back a scoff. It was only natural that the boy who lived to be a pain in Draco’s ass looked like a damn god, whereas Draco was sure that he looked like a shrivelled shrimp.
Draco couldn’t breathe.
Their tongues swirled around each other in a perfect harmony. Hard but sweet, fighting for dominance. Draco felt like he was flying. Like there wasn’t anything but Potter. He felt safe. Secure. Alive in a bound of passion. Potter had his heart. His soul. And it scared him.
Potter sniffled. “Why does it hurt so goddamn much?” he begged her for an answer.
Draco smiled maliciously. “I mean exactly that. A puppet.” He said. “Would you like me to book you in with an appointment at the healers?” he asked innocently. “It appears that your memory isn’t what it used to be.” He quipped.
Her mother said that he’d saved her, but that couldn’t have been further from the truth. Kat had saved
“Can you describe the nature of your relationship with Harry Potter?”
“Draco, it’s absolutely beautiful. I’ve never see anything more artistically amazing.” She said in complete awe.
Theo raised a brow. “Really? Because it didn’t look like nothing.”
With the last shred of hope that he had left he lifted the wand and pointed it to his head. He prayed that feelings were something that couldn’t be forgotten.
And that was worse than the person he'd once shown himself to be, an open traitorous person was far more acceptable than a hidden one. Those were the ones most likely to stab you in the back.
“Really?” she whispered in wonder.
hope. But it was something he could never have. Something that he didn't deserve. He shifted uncomfortably, but it was a feeling that he had. And one that he feared would never go away.
But to see this, to see him on the verge of some sort of breakdown. Well, Draco couldn't put into words exactly how he felt.
Draco rolled his eyes. Lucky him. His crazed aunt was keeping a killing to herself for once. Must be hard for that murderous bitch.
It wasn't okay. None of this was okay. But he relaxed, hoping that even for a moment, that he could forget everything.
he thought deviously. “Muggle?” he said hopefully and Potter grinned. Draco stared at the contraption in complete awe before his face started to fall. “But I don’t have my turny breaky thing.” He muttered sadly. “How am I supposed to look inside it?”, he started to shake it frantically.
He wasn’t weak. He. Was. Strong.
Kat smiled. “Good choice.” she told her, lowering her wand as the door slammed open.
“I’m always right.” Draco smugly commented. “I really don’t understand these muggles, where do they hide the bread?” he asked Potter, whilst slamming the toasterer onto the floor.
He’d always known that he was there but knowing it and seeing it were two different things. Whilst yes, you could say that Draco had already witnessed the Dark Lord in his home when he’d received the mark, but he’d been shipped off to Hogwarts only shortly after that.
Draco had yet to assassinate his Headmaster, but he had a plan for that. He had a plan for
“Sometimes I hate you. I hate you so much. I don’t want to, but I do. I thought it was because of all the horrible things you’ve done to me. But now,
She gazed at him longingly. “But would I ever change him? Never.” She finished and there was no doubt in Draco's mind that this was a girl in love.
She cried, pulling him into a hug full of tears, love, and trust. “You make me happy too.” She murmured into his ear.
appreciate this invasion of privacy, he thought as he pushed her arm off. Especially when he was being attacked by who he thought were his best friends.
“RONALD BILLIUS WEASLEY! I swear on my seven children that if you don’t step away from that chicken now, I’ll cut off your tongue!” Mrs Weasley yelled, and those were the first words he heard as he stepped through the Weasley flew.
Instead, he walked right up to Madam Rosmerta, placing the velvet box in front of her.
In all honesty, Draco had no frickin idea, but he was going to carry on doing it. Crabbe may never forgive him, but he’d rather that then never being able to forgive himself.
He sighed, “fine.” So, Draco told him everything. He spoke about the beginning of his seventh year and his newfound feelings for Potter. He told his father about how he’d been detached and lost all year, and how Potter had been one of the only things to keep him going.
