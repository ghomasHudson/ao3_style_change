Hermione was laying on the floor with a massive desk calendar and four neon highlighters. Ron had pulled a fucking tome out of his backpack that had the store’s employee schedules, shipping schedules, sales rotations, events and maintenance.
She had to send him some kind of message after an exchange like that.  This was no funny ginger cat meme.

He rolled over and repositioned himself on the futon with a demonstrable clearing of his throat.  Laying on his back seemed more composed, despite the adrenaline rush.  Too late, he glanced down to see the hard bulge in his jeans and Harry’s intent gaze.
said point.”
“I love you, Harry.”
He dropped down on the sandy path in front of the door.  The books shifted inside the bag, jerking him down into a clumsy landing.  Talons dug for purchase, found balance, and shifted to human feet clad in modest oxfords.  The Ministry hadn’t left him much, but at least they’d given him his shoes.  A few pair, anyway.

He raised his hand for a third knock, and the door swung open to reveal a startled, dripping wet Malfoy in a… women’s skirt?  A blue and white satin skirt with big flowers on it.

Chin high, we’ve got you.
“I have a proposition for you, Draco,” she stated firmly.
“I need a shower,” Harry murmured, the beginnings of a smirk growing.  “Don’t get married without me.”
Draco ducks out of the fireplace and stands, hands full of Merlin-knows-what, but he beams like the sun, and Harry forgets how to greet a guest. Draco steps onto the thick rug, and a gust of warm air that smells like foliage follows him before the Floo dies down.
Harry huffed a laugh. “You cried when we had to put down a Peruvian Vipertooth.”
Unzippin’ that rite orgiastic
“I’ll see you Thursdaaaaay,” he sings.
She always carried the same satchel. A gargantuan, floral embroidered drawstring monstrosity. He often wondered if she used it on a daily basis, or only for her visits here. He was prepared to feel flattered if she had a special Going to Draco’s Bag, but that was unlikely.

“At that point, they all but had.”  He readied the tea, and she watched quietly.
Another book landed on the stack, and Harry eyed it warily.  “You can add maybe three more, and then I’m at the limit of being able to Apparate both you and your books back home.”
A rectangle of sunlight tumbled from a stack of manila folders onto the table, a corner of it beaming into a small orange jar. The jar glowed like a fire opal; a sugary sunset of color.
“Falk and the Goblins,” Harry offered.  “Maybe they’d have stuck their necks out for a stranger, but maybe not.  They do all hate the Ministry.”
“I was just gonna-”
“Then tell me a bad one. A terrible one. The worst one you can think of.”
“Hm,” Ron hummed in appreciation.  “An interview with the Muggle-raised Head Auror would be a nice touch.  Probably sell plenty of copies, too.”
“Matilda,” he nodded in greeting, edging a wide circle around the eagle.
Sitting up suddenly, he gripped the seat in front of him, letting a wave of nausea and vertigo pass.
“To be fair,” Draco croaked.  “I thought you meant tie, like dress code.  Not Thai, like… this.  I was prepared to wear a restaurant loaner jacket.”
Malfoy’s fingertips
“You would. Hell, a brick would be an improvement right now, but you’d be great. They won’t get rid of him till they see him as a financial risk, though. So, piss away all the money you can till you’re in charge.”
His lips found Draco’s in a fumbling, tear-slicked movement.  Not a kiss, because it’s difficult to kiss a grown man whose heart has broken in the best possible way.
Harry, just admit you want to do butt stuff.
“You’re welcome,
Hot tendrils of pressure spilled over, and she bit down with finality as her body gripped him, coursing waves of pleasure through her.  He groaned low and shameless, throbbing inside her as she held him tight.  Quieting, she licked across the imprint of her teeth, embarrassed to have left such a violent mark on him.  He shivered and caught her lips in a deep, melding kiss.
“But I’m allowed to know about my own life.”
It had led to a lot of embarrassing erections under tables on Harry’s part.  He’d often watched their fights escalate while hoping they’d end in sex.  He’d chosen not to analyze his own desire to watch his teenage friends throw down and rage-fuck in front of him.
“Uhm, yes,” Hermione stammered.  “A little.  And uhm… with good reason.”
Draco rolls onto his back and yawns. “And a prick.”
“We had bets going, you know,” he said offhandedly.  “On whether your mutt would give up and let you off the leash.”
“I’ll be sure they get their referral bonuses,” he bit sarcastically.
Luna continued, “It was a strange time.  You weren’t the only one to travel.  But not many others have come back.”
“Why…” Malfoy gulped.  “Why are you wearing that?”  The bag of charms almost hid the fine trembling in his hand.  Harry watched as the faint blush drained from Malfoy’s cheeks.  He held the bag delicately, touching it as little as possible.
“Mm hm.”  Draco’s hand settled on Ron’s other shoulder, and stifled a satisfied moan as he felt the other man reach up to idly stroke his forearm.
“Very well.”  Draco’s hands slid out and covered Harry’s, finally warm.  Dove-grey eyes looked up in quiet anticipation.  “It’ll make quite the Quibbler article, you know.”
I doubt I’ll ever be allowed to meet my half-siblings.  Father will probably convince them that I hate them.  Maybe he’ll draw horns on paintings of me and turn me into the Malfoy family’s personal bogeyman.  He’ll teach them I’m a threat.
Draco’s jaw dropped in surprise.  “No!” he shouted.  “Merlin’s tits, you think I’d be making confessions instead of hemorrhaging out new wards?!”
“And you told me before that you still loved him, and so I guess I shouldn’t have been surprised, but then you didn’t answer me when I asked if we were dating other people,” he hitched another breath and continued, “so I know we’re… whatever we are.  And I guess it makes me a hypocrite, with Hermione, but I just-”
“You fucking want it?” he asks, pitch rising.
Gather round, O children mine-
“Huh,” he huffed.  He’d assumed the way Malfoy and Ron had talked about Thestrals that he and Falk were very much exclusive.
Her hands skimmed up the insides of her thighs as she stood, coming to rest near her navel.  Turning back to him, she whispered a wandless contraception charm.
“Hm,” he puffed.  “Never considered it.  Relevant witnesses are all dead or in Azkaban, and Death Eaters.  But yes.  That would be… significant.  Talk to Potter about it in the morning.”

He pressed into her, pinning her hips against the carved stone railing.  His hands wandered up to cup her breasts, and she leaned her head back onto his shoulder.
She pats the long, leather chair, and Harry gingerly sits back in it. His fingers curl over the hard arms of the chair, and Harry wonders if he looks like a terrified astronaut, because he certainly feels like one.
“Ready?” Draco asks, holding Harry’s waist and cock, and Harry nods.
The amount of time and effort Potter had put into his machinations was breathtaking.  It was the most quintessentially Slytherin thing Draco had ever witnessed, and further confirmed Draco’s suspicion that this man was rather brilliant when allowed time to think.

Harry was sitting on a park bench, which was not warm yet mid-morning, in Muggle London, watching Falk negotiate with a food truck worker.  The vendor had warned that it would take a half-hour to warm up his fryer, and another fifteen to actually make the chips.  Falk told him that was fine.  He’d wait.
“I…” she stuttered.  “I…

The projection dissolved into the room again.
The club on Knockturn is everything that’s right with the world and wrong with society. It’s right in that no one gives a fuck whose body is doing what with whom. It’s wrong in that only those deemed closest to perfection see any action.
Harry’s coffee rose in his throat, and he swallowed it down.  Bad.  This was going to be very bad.
Harry, by contrast, had obliterated a small cheese and fruit plate and ordered an omelette as a
“Fuuuuuck…”  Draco groaned into the hapless pillow.  It really didn’t deserve his verbal abuse.
Harry had more questions now than when he’d started snooping.  Investigating.  Not snooping.  Aurors do not snoop.
“Did you just tuck your head under your wing?”  He chuckled, wondering how many of Draco’s idiosyncrasies were actually remnants of his Animagus form.
A soft knock on his door drew his attention away from his paperwork yet again, and he huffed in annoyance.  “Yes?”
snooping Narcissa and Lucius’s files.  Had Malfoy seriously been fucking around playing Quidditch at Durmstrang while the Ministry was ripping Western Europe apart trying to find them?
“Oh,” she whispered in surprise, as she opened a centerfold of Magnus Falk wearing nothing but a… Snitch.
He shook his head, letting Magnus’s hand hover.  “I don’t want to see you together, Mag,” he whispered, voice breaking.  “I can’t.”
He rolled his forehead against the cool metal of the rather ordinary-looking door.  In theory, he could open the door a crack, slip his wand in, and just hit the whole room with the Killing Curse.
“It’s… fine.” Harry sighed.  “I don’t think it’s really for me, you know.”
Prince of Ashes!

Harry’s hands wash and dry themselves while he loses himself in his own head. They’d talked at the pub. Met twice in his shop. Spent the gala together. And the night. And snuggling. Jewelry. Cinema.

I expect the unexpected, and yet am surprised still.
The man turned sideways and caught Draco staring. His eyes wandered down Draco’s body to linger on the bulge in his joggers. He tilted his head toward the bathroom door. “You first.”
His arm wraps around my shoulders, a treacherous golden snake dangling from his fingers.
That was definitely the better option.  The other option being dropping out of school, losing her Ministry internship, and gracing the world with another fucking Malfoy.  That plan had absolutely nothing going for it.  Probably a cute little fucking Malfoy, though.

A soft hum comes from the throat under Harry’s lips. Draco licks his fingers clean, then runs them through Harry’s hair.
Time in Azkaban moved to the beat of several drums.  There was the shift change of the guards.  Thrice daily, in a cacophony of footfalls.  Afternoons spent in the yard, metered out by his father's knuckles.  Weeks measured in the bloom and fade of bruises, with trips to the infirmary at what seemed like irregular intervals, but turned out to be distinctly related to the guard schedule.
“The day you wank in the Burrow kitchen is the day I stop coming to Sunday brunch,” Harry said, stepping out of the Floo.
“What about the other kids?  And Granger?  And Potter?  And the whole sordid mess?” He rambled.  Everything could go wrong.  Just, simply everything.
“It was a compliment of sorts.  And he just sat in a club chair and watched.  It’s not every day you get to watch an inebriated war criminal ruin a cake completely starkers.”
Harry peeked around the corner of the bookcase, unsure if subtlety was the best approach when one expected to walk in on another masturbatory performance. With a relieved sigh, his shoulders dropped as he took in Draco’s sleeping form.
Toss etiquette; slowed bites lose heat.
Panting breaths fell from Harry as he watched Draco move, just out of arm’s reach.  Harry’s cock leaked, tension spooling in his hips.  Draco’s hips rocked in a slow rotation as he traced fingers down his flanks, body on display.  His palms pressed down the outsides of his spread thighs as he sank deeper onto the orange length below him.

Ron’s heart dropped into his small intestine and rebounded into his throat.
Draco’s grip on his cock stilled as tension broke, and he came in his fist as Harry shuddered behind him.
Harry tosses Draco his coat with an equally-wide grin. “I can take a compliment.”

Gratefully, Hermione and the Supreme Mugwump retreated to a side table with their reams of paper.  Harry watched them with pride.  Pink Power Granger, he thought to himself with a grin.
Her patience with him had officially reached its limit.
Malfoy’s lips stilled, and he stepped forward.  He mouth was a tight line as he dipped the knife, thinking.  “I believe we understand each other quite well, then, Potter,” he confirmed, beginning another incantation.
“Yeah, I guess.”
Soft moans from Hermione drifted down the entrance to the spring, and he grinned.  That didn’t sound like hair being braided.  Not yet, anyway.
“You don’t have to watch,” Harry whispered, hand still on his forearm.
Draco huffed a small laugh in his sleep, and Harry hugged him tight. Waking up entangled was swiftly becoming one of Harry’s favorite things. Eventually, he’d have to finagle himself between Hermione and Draco for a night. His shoulders shimmied happily at the thought.
A furious lecture on his abuse of the English language was brewing in the back of her throat, but it could wait.  She scrolled back up to look at that cock again.  As far as dick pics went, it was worth a second look.  Maybe a third.  Later.  Knickers off.
Humming in interest, he matched her sip.  “Muggle custom?”
Gods, she felt good.  He’d gotten so used to only being touched through fabric, that he’d nearly forgotten what skin felt like.  Her tongue flicked out to lick his nipple, and he groaned.
Draco sagged against Harry’s chest, a collapse more than an embrace, and Harry held him tight and waited.  He waited for the man he loved to unravel.  He waited to watch Draco’s heart break.  He waited as the doors closed, and the conductor hollered.

He Vanished the vomit in the bin, anger and sorrow winding together into bitter resolve.  Malfoy’s parents deserved to die very, very slowly.
Threads pulled.  Frayed.  Taut.  All feigned control.
Pulling the first folder, he opened it to an index on the first page.  A case folder that required an index was new to him.  And there were tabs in the folder.  That wasn’t standard.

, but that wasn’t exactly a bad thing.  She’d absolutely end up late for a project meeting in the morning, though.
Ron gasped from in front of her, followed by a wet slurp and dark chuckle from Hermione.  “Godric’s fucking gonads,” Ron blurted, half in awe.  “Bunch of glorious fucking sluts, the lot of you.”
An investigation of sorts would be a fantastically entertaining way to jog his memory. The Sherlock Holmes of the blank space between his own ears. He could solve The Case of the Bakery Order Worth Keeping the Receipt.
“Well, that does sound thorough.”  Hermione turned in his arms.  “Why did you blast extra bedrooms?”
“Huh,” Harry huffed.  “Didn’t know she even worked.  How long will you be gone?”
“Come to Cardiff,” a weak female voice faltered.  “Please.”  It laid down, closed its eyes, stilled, and dissolved.
“Ron!” Draco hollered from the kitchen.  “Don’t bring home puppies!”
“Well, shit,” Harry mutters.
He slides down my back, soft lips and hard teeth alternating in a line along my spine that makes me raise my arse in offering.  Rough hands spread me open and hot, damp breath skates over my entrance.

He withdrew from her mind, stroking his fingers over her head.  He’d had no idea she’d been nesting every year.  She had no chance of successfully hatching an eaglet in the middle of London while having to leave her nest to carry messages.  Poor bird.
He shrugged again.  “Purebloods will know.  Maybe some others from older families.”
“Mate, come on.” Ron obliged.  “He just literally invited you into his actual bed.”
Flourish & Blotts, 2021
Tears pricked in the corners of his eyes as he clutched her head to his chest.  How could one man have gotten so lucky?  How could one man have the privilege of loving so many children?  One for each chamber of his heart, till it felt ready to burst every time he thought about it.
“If a book club could make any witch come, it would be you,” he accused weakly.
Ron was going to have a serious talk with the Head Auror about shagging Draco to pieces and then leaving.  Un-fucking-acceptable.
Metaxas nodded enthusiastically.  “Yes, and the Scots-Irish League is welcome to compete internationally.”
He honestly hadn’t thought about how Malfoy would feel about the reassignment.  Merlin, what would that be like to answer to your own classmate and school nemesis?  And one who’d vociferously rejected your advances for years?  Shit.  Maybe he should have told Robards about that.  But he’d thought it was one-sided till just this morning.
His head snapped up, eyes flinty. “You wouldn’t.”
Percy shrugged, hands quickly packing his bag.  “Call somebody you know who has a residential Floo and just stick your head through.  That should be alright.  Right, Harry?”

“That morning started with Narcissa throwing her copy of Witch Weekly in my face and crowing about it,” he sighed.  His wrist flicked long lines across the paper.  “I left after she worked herself up to a Dementor-worthy state.”

A dripping-wet Hermione tiptoed between the bookcase, startling a bit as she noticed him sitting up in bed.
Draco grunted in response, or he was pretty sure he did.  Might have been a chortle.
Harry shook his head and frowned.  Wrong time and place to be thinking about Draco’s exes.  Not while he was setting up a rather risky gift all along Draco’s table.  Fuck.  Draco loved this table, and Harry was going to do

Draco’s breath caught.  “What?”
He sighs and lets his shoulders relax under the steady pounding of hot water. So hot. Almost too hot.
“Ted’s going to inherit the Black and Malfoy vaults. That boy won’t even notice what you throw in the pot when you kick the bucket, Harry.”
Draco gagged on the smell as he closed the door behind them, but the man pulled his wand out, and the air rushed out and back into the room through invisible windows. Under the real windows sat dead houseplants, the most vibrant thing about them the cigarette butts piled on the dry soil.
Rather un-Malfoy.
Draco bit his lip, thumbs stroking over the back of the chair.
“I could skip it,” she blurted, and Draco looked up.  “I could have an assistant read opening remarks, and greet the UN delegates, and I could go with you to King’s Cross.”
“Did you watch it when they named you Ted’s godfather? Or did Andromeda give you instructions? Maybe I should have asked her, but I think she’s mad at me for lighting his toy car on fire. And besides, I don’t want to know if you have to kill people on Teddy’s wedding day, Harry. I don’t. And I don’t want to have to put hits on people when I could be eating cake.”

A hot breath snuffles against his thigh and he wakes with a start.
Oh, Gods, Ron thought,
Cassandra nodded encouragingly.  “John’s rugby team will be there, and they’re mostly single.  And fit.”
“Uhm…” Harry draws a slow breath and stares at Draco’s lips, daring them to smirk. “I can’t Apparate.”
“You will, eventually.” The man wiped tears from his eyes and sighed.
Slowly, Harry lowered his face toward Draco’s ear, sniffing dramatically.  “Potter!  You mother fucker!”
Dazed, he turns to find a disheveled Draco Malfoy watching him, head cocked as if he’s watching a bug in a jar. Under Draco’s arm are several leather-bound ledgers. Quills peek from the back pocket of his skin-tight jeans as he bends over to pick up the errant wand.
Ron’s pants hitched up over his hips just as he heard the buzzer inside the flat. Unsure of what to do with it, he held the button, and it buzzed back.
The dimples are gone, and his thumb doesn’t have anything to fit into as he spreads Draco open, but there’s so little flesh left that he doesn’t need to. Draco’s entrance is slick and warm along his cock, and the back against his chest vibrates with an eager hum.
“I- What?” Draco stammered, pulling his eyes away from his not-husband’s arse.
Harry shook his head and took the mobile from his ear to enter his code number.  His gaze lingered on Draco, so uncertain and hesitant in front of him.

“Well, go on and shit on it, then,” he challenged.  He really did expect her to do so.  She had an uncanny ability to understand him out of his Animagus form.
Turning back to the Goblin, and the tree, Malfoy noticed Harry’s waving hand and held up a finger in delay.  Harry dropped his arm and pouted.  And then questioned why Malfoy’s reaction made him sulk.  Aurors don’t sulk.
in your life, thought ‘Oh, I know who’d be a great help? Draco Malfoy!’”
Yeah, he thought.  Malfoy was going to need to register that gorgeous beast of a fireplace he’d blasted out of the granite.  No reason to muck about with inferior equipment when his brother was the one in charge of it.
Ron bit a fingernail, thinking.  The silence tied Draco’s guts in anxious knots.

She knew it was a weighty proposal, and both an unorthodox but very traditional one.  It had only taken her a decade to finally approach him about it.
Armed with fistfuls of apple slices, Lou was released to sticky up the kitchen.  Ron smiled, pleased someone enjoyed the literal fruits of his labor.
“You said that last time, Harry,” she said with a self-satisfied smirk as she used both hands to lay the hair of his lower abdomen smooth.
“A month or two,” Draco said with a too-casual shrug, torn between enjoying Harry’s anxiety and wanting to soothe him.  It was immature, and he hated himself just a bit for wanting to throw Harry off-kilter.
Draco’s breathing has a raspy edge to it, and Harry can make out the lines of his ribs in his back through his t-shirt.
Tentatively, he approached the violet one at the foot of the table, closest to the bedroom.  Nothing magical jumped out at him, figuratively or literally.  It wasn’t at all impressive in size, but it was rather exquisitely-detailed.  Intricate veins and lines decorated its length, and a terribly life-like moulded scrotum below sported ridges and wrinkles.  More detailed than plenty of actual cocks, he mused.
Aurors don’t cry when someone kisses them.  They don’t.  They absolutely do not.  Not even when someone slowly, tenderly presses his lips to their forehead because it’s difficult to snog someone who’s softly sobbing.
With an interested harrumph, Draco slipped out of bed and padded to the living room, rounded the couch, and froze.
“Metaxas,” Draco says, a curt nod in greeting.
“Uh huh,” Draco mutters into Harry’s neck. “Uhm. Question.”
People like him didn’t have happy endings.  Quiet endings, if they were lucky, but not happy ones.  Happy endings were for people who were raised in that world.  Like Ron.  Weasleys got fairy tales.  Malfoys were cautionary tales.
Wiggling into his shoes, he hastened a goodbye wave to Connie, and turned to leave.

Harry snorts a laugh that dies in his throat as Eric lays tentative fingers over Harry’s arm, brushing over the black line under his shirt. “Thanks, Harry.”
A skittering tingle of magic skates over Harry’s hole; the sudden slickness pulls an eager hum from his throat.  Draco’s fingertips graze over the tight furl of skin, and Harry grunts in protest.  “I’m ready.”
His fingers slid down over his nose, as if blocking out the memory of the smell.  Harry’s heart dropped, and he fought to keep his face from showing it.  He’d really thought he’d seen all the misery Draco had lived through, but he’d only seen what his

.”  Draco enunciated carefully for Harry’s benefit, barely noticing the familiar deep rumble and abrupt slickness.  His fingertips pressed against his entrance as he willed himself to relax.  They slipped in easily, and he took a moment to spread them gently in preparation.
Pah!  Friends.  “And you’ll have a new one in July.  Bully for you.”
Draco quirked an eyebrow, intrigued.  “And jacket, I assume?”
“Give it to me, Harry.” Teeth press lightly around the base of his cock, and Harry whimpers as his composure breaks.
Night hunting was a terrible fucking idea, Draco reminded himself.  Terrible, exciting, and often productive.
“Good point.  Any idea what’s wrong with him?”  Crookshanks rolled over between them on the bed, belly bared.  She kept her lips tight as Ron’s hand drifted down to the fuzzy proffered tummy, oblivious to the teeth and claws at the ready.
Onasis eyed them suspiciously and looked more anxious for it.
“Let’s see.  Potter’s many reasons he simply

He settled for letting his head roll back and forth on the back of the chair, lips between his teeth.  Potter wouldn’t want to dance with him, anyway.
Draco’s words are smothered by Harry’s lips and come out as an interested hum by the time Harry pulls back. He blinks wide grey eyes at Harry and lets out a shuddering sigh. “I don’t think you care about my trip to Alsace at all.”
, I feel’s, the deeper wound.
“Oh, little Blackblood,” he whispered to himself.
He squeaked in surprise as the ledge was replaced by open air, and Harry’s hot breath on his neck.  His back bowed, only hips and shoulders in contact with Harry.  His hands clutched Harry's forearm across his own chest, desperate for something stable to cling to as Harry drove into him.
He’ll say it’s my guilty conscience that made me imagine he was fucking his friends.  He might be right.  He’s always right.
“Yeah, this is it.” Draco rolled his forehead against the glass. “But the receipt was old.”
“Not that I think you
own legs, apparently.  “Breathe.”
The couple in the spiffy robes that had intimidated Malfoy still sat in their seats chatting pleasantly.  Either nobody cared to fling hexes at them, or they had a way of blocking them he couldn’t see.
Dull grey water filled the bottom of the kitchen sink, and Draco rammed his wand down the drain, where it ground to a gritty stop against the mass of clogged ash. Why they’d retaught him how to cast a spell for fire without teaching him how to put one out was beyond reason.
“Harry.” Draco said, drawing his attention as he made his way back to his chair across from Hermione.  “If you had the money, why did you opt for that hideous
“I just don’t want to deal with you after your… personal revelation,” Draco admitted, trying to make it as little about Potter as possible.
Instead, he cleared his throat and released the harp from its hug.  “Hm?”
Flourish & Blotts, 2021
Draco propped himself up on his elbows, and blood trickled down his chin. A split lip and maybe a mild concussion, a distant, clinical part of him decided. He dripped water and blood on the white tile while the man stepped out.

This adventure’s convocation consisted of four fellow Steller’s sea eagles, a golden eagle, and a Peregrine falcon who liked to punch above his weight.  They’d sniffed the owlery out in less than the hour it had taken him to catch their breakfast in the bay.  Teamwork among raptors was rare, except, apparently, when one of them was a human.

“The Bats, the Kestrals, the Bangers, the Wanderers, Pride, and the Magpies have joined the Scots-Irish League.  The Catapults and Harpies are in talks to form a Welsh league, but they may join us, as well.”

Take it all?
The Goblin on the table levitated the chalice into the arched ceiling, letting it hover.  Tendrils of gently looping white vapor cascaded from it, slowly forming a hazy cloud.
“Oh, shit,” he giggled to himself, half in fear.
And the "too" leaves a crumb in my nose that wanders into my ear, and it plinks back and forth. This "too" bounces, eardrum to eardrum, and as it arcs up, each volley, it rattles about, knocking bits of memories down like rain to drip and fizzle down the copper wires of my auditory nerves:
the whole time.  Not her.
“Huh,” he huffed to himself.
Slowly, Draco sits on the hearth, then scoots himself back, sitting inside the fireplace. “Ah, bollocks. Hand me the powder.”
“Oh, bullshit. I’ve seen you with a-”
Harry was kind of friends with Malfoy now, so that was a conflict of interest, right?
“Draco,” Harry whispered, trying to hide his concern.  “You okay?”
The neighborhood must have gone to shit quickly. Then again, it was mostly industrial buildings around the decrepit strip mall.
Fumes from the rubbing alcohol burn his nose as he scrubs the workbench. The monkey tree resin had worked, but not without leaving an awful, sticky mess. He throws the rag in the bucket and tosses it all in the utility sink. He wonders, briefly, if it will spontaneously combust overnight, and sets it all in the alley. Just in case.
“Only if you get caught,” Harry mused, leaning in.
“Thanks, mate.” The man said, reaching into another bag and holding out a fistful of plastic-wrapped forks and knives. Confused, Draco accepted them and stuffed them in his back pocket.
They both took a deep breath and relaxed.  The epiphany that had threatened the other day had found an odd time and place to manifest.  Maybe ripping it open wasn’t meant to be done alone.
“Fuck,” I say, the K catching on the back of my tongue.
,” he whispered, eyes vacant. His tongue ran the full path of his upper jaw, and he let Harry see the gesture.
you’re not brewing poison over there?”  He eyed his beer suspiciously.
He turned and looked back up, expecting some kind of rejection, but Draco simply hummed and nodded softly.  “I thought that, too.  I was sure I’d hex a student for chewing gum or something silly.”  His lips pulled under as he thought.  “It is disorienting,
She thought back to the shredded pile of naan Ron had wasted the other night.  Maybe it hadn’t just been a way to occupy his hands.
He took the bait!
Draco sets the quill down and stands, hands sliding into the back pockets of his jeans and tugging the fabric tight over his hips. He rocks back and forth a bit, thinking.
But Malfoy didn’t know any of that.  “Ah, bollocks,” Ron hissed, checking his schedule for the day.  Luckily, very little that couldn’t be dealt with tomorrow.
Harry’s fingers traced the leg bands of her knickers again, this time meeting in the middle to pull the gusset down.  His fingertips barely brushed her cleft, and goosebumps ran down her thighs.  He withdrew one hand and licked a finger.
“And are pathologically generous.”
Our tete-a-tete,
“Gonna eat your arse for dinner,” Draco mumbled.
The loose tendrils of pleasure weaving through her snapped into a humming rope, and with his next thrust broke, sending her moaning, her body clenching around his cock as he groaned against her shoulder.

“Just do your job, you fucking clown.”
“I… won’t,”  Potter said warily.  He reached for the wine, and Draco thought he was going to top off his mug.  He simply slid it out of Draco’s reach.  “You really

Thud.
Draco whines and tucks his muzzle against his chest. “How did you get the fridge open without thumbs, anyway?”
“I...”  Harry started, but trailed off.  Again, he wanted to argue, and tell him that the Draco he knew wouldn’t
“Hm?”  Draco hummed drowsily.  The warmth from Harry’s hands slid down to the back of his head, and he opened glazed eyes as his head lolled back.  “I’m terrifying,” he murmured with a lazy smirk.
“And me,” Malfoy acknowledged, also proud of Harry for using words.  “Heals his players up mid-game with Blood Magic, too.”  Malfoy had to look away.  Harry’s gaze had gotten too intense.
One of Malfoy’s hands had drifted down to skirt the edge of his lace knickers but hesitated at the border.  Harry’s cock throbbed, watching the other man’s drowsy indecision.
The cat grudgingly walked off the laptop, and a fullscreen photo showcasing a very erect, rather large penis next to a hand giving a “thumbs up” filled the screen.
"When there's
Feathered caresses and glances of cool magic flicked around his eyes as Hermione and Draco communicated wordlessly.  An unspoken union that he both envied and thrilled in.  They adjusted angles, changed pace, and all without so much as a glance to him.  It was simultaneously impersonal and indulgent.
And why does he know entirely too much about female anatomy?
He follows Draco’s blurry form toward the kitchen, and breathes in deep lungfuls of air that smells like forest floor.
“Lucky that’s all I broke, itchy witch,” he teased. “Bed?”
Harry moved, slowly, carefully, and Draco pressed back into him, eager and begging with motion the way he couldn’t with words.
He watched, jaw slack, as black ink rolled over into jade vines, normally-colorful flowers winking open into glistening silver blooms.  Slowly, they opened and furled back shut, swirling in a glimmering mass on his shoulder before fading.
Ron took in the cut on Malfoy’s hand, the slender blade resting on his thigh, and the unholy amount of blood.  Malfoy looked up to find Ron glaring at him.
Molly, Fleur, Audrey, and Percy all shot daggers at him.  Bill looked thrilled at the possibility of bloodshed at brunch.  Arthur had been stricken with sudden and total deafness, the cure for which was obviously at the bottom of the butter dish.
“You worthless little
“May I come in?” she asked, balanced excitedly on her toes.  “I have a surprise.  No,
“What?” Harry asked, startled.  It was an odd time to be discussing his work-related ethics.
Ron gritted his teeth and whipped hexes at Harry, a wild grin growing as they traded barbs.  Red and orange sparks skittered over the Quintaped blood-stained floor, snuffing out on impact.
The noise in the room cascades in on waves. Traffic on the outside street. A ceiling fan. Kate’s mobile buzzing on the far counter. A ticking clock. All of them caught by the Hearrings and sent to his good ear.
Such a fucking nincompoop.
“Take off your glamour,” he suggested with a bit of a smirk.
Merlin be damned.  Hermione must have gone to Malfoy’s this morning.  The thing did work.  Ron was waiting for an answer, and he wasn’t sure how much he was allowed to divulge.  But then again, he pretty much had no oversight or objective for this case.
Ugh, his flat.  Hermione had been right in her assessment.  It did look like he’d just moved in, because really, he’d never moved in.  He slept there, ate there, showered there, and that was about it.  It was never
“Hi,” she balked.  Confidence waning, she was caught off guard by him not being in the middle of something nefarious.  She’d expected to interrupt him plotting her demise, not… taking a bath?  And looking up at her with those grey eyes.  Fuck, he looked like he’d been carved as an homage to a Greek god.  Why did he bother hiding any of his face behind hair?

“It is.  I think roses will do quite well in your front garden.  Do you want to know about her, love?”
Draco huffs a laugh right into his mouth, pulls back and glares down at him, wiping tears from his eyes. “I very much wish I were. But not on weekdays. And even-“
He took a tentative sip of the coffee and hummed in appreciation.  Plenty strong, but not brewed too hot.  Harry did make a good cup of coffee, Draco thought, followed by the jaw-dropping realization that it had been
Harry turned off the bedroom light, exiting with a tie draped around his neck.  “So, will they assume you and I are dating, or will they somehow know we’re not?”
Out of the corner of his eye, a slight ripple in the scales of the underside caught the light.
Affections left to give.
“You okay?”
review it, before you signed it?”
“Tell me a story, then.” Draco took the cup and refilled it. He leaned a hip against the counter and drank slowly.
The eagle held a crust of sandwich in her beak and alit on the top of the chair in front of him, nearly eye-to-eye.  She quirked her head expectantly.

“What do you think, Crook?” She asked the lazy ginger beast at her feet. “What would you do?  What is the value of a shag?  Definitely less than the cost of ten owls.”
He smiled.  “Malfoy, I guessed and got you chicken tikka. But you can have my korma if you like.”

As she watched, the ribbon of smoke turned into a steady stream, and the “#6” was starting to peel off the metal door.

Four equally-packed folders sat behind this one.  Taking in the drawer as a whole, he noted that Lucius’s records took up half the damn drawer.  Merlin’s mustache, that was a lot of paperwork.  He pitied the Aurors who’d had to fill all of this out.
“You?” Draco tried to ignore the implication of professional sports equipment that had to belong to another man.
Even though you’re not grown yet.
Draco woke to bright sunlight and a disappointingly empty expanse of white sheets. It had to be past noon, by the sun. He stretched and lazily slid a hand down to cup himself. The dream he’d been enjoying had already melted away, but it must have been exciting. He rubbed his face with both hands, and hoisted himself up to standing. Everything felt wrung out and sore from a long flight yesterday. Caffeine was in order.
Three weeks, though.  He could handle three weeks in Azkaban, assuming the remaining Death Eaters didn’t have him killed while the guards weren’t looking.  Big assumption, that.
His mark burns again, and he scratches it as he looks around the office. Muggle and Wizarding legal texts fill the bookshelves behind the desk. A framed degree from a law school in Amsterdam is surrounded by smaller framed photos of parties and receptions with a few landscapes thrown in; a vineyard, tundra, the Golden Gate Bridge, a desert.

“Yeah, maybe.”  Harry shrugged and threw the duvet over him. “Probably.”

Why he’d expected a blur to nod, he didn’t know.  It just shimmered there.  Not unlike the early eaglets in his dreams, he thought.  Before they’d found forms.  A plenipotentiary of people.  Cornucopia of corporeal forms.
“I suppose you can just Apparate now that you’ve been here,” he said, taking her in.  The anger added a glint to her eyes that he couldn’t help but find appealing.
Hermione glared at him suspiciously, hiding the flowers behind her back.  They’d be less impressive covered in rock dust.
Draco’s fist moved in a quickening blur, and orgasm approached like a suspension bridge at the bottom of a valley. Fragile, ethereal, inevitable. He barrelled into it with his breath held and grip tight, body shuddering. A moan broke from his throat, shattering out in ripples as he pulsed his release into his fingers.
Draco nodded, tight-lipped.  Harry didn’t need to know the details.  He didn’t need to know Magnus had had an anaphylactic reaction to the penicillin in front of him.  He didn’t need to know that the MediWitches had panicked and Draco had been certain he’d killed the only person to love him.
“Wish you could come along,” she sighed.
Cassandra looked like she was accidentally auditioning for a role as any manner of spring or fertility goddess.  Her blond hair wound around the top of her head in an intricate braid, with smaller French braids feeding up into it from the nape of her neck.  Artificial flowers were stuck throughout the woven crown.

Harry frowned.  “Ron, it’s alright.” He stepped closer and took the bag from Malfoy’s outstretched hand.
An old man sweating through a tweed suit hustles up to them, and Harry’s grateful someone else failed to dress for the heat.  Malfoy, on the other hand, is wearing precisely what he normally does to the office.
Roots dug deep,
She shut the book and reopened it to a new page, placing a finger at random.
“Yes.  That’s accurate.” Falk stated blandly.  “The only hostility I’ve experienced was from Muggleborn and half-blood Brits.  I blame integration.”
“Hermione!” He snatched her up in a bear hug. Her arms wrapped around his middle as she got a face full of sweaty cotton. His armpit and shoulder shouldn’t have excited her as much as it did, but Merlin, he smelled like sex already.
—————————
Anxiety shot pinpricks up Harry’s chest and neck.
“So suggestible, too,” he chided, resting his other palm against her clit.  Maybe having something to grind against would at least give her something to do.
Their conversation faded out as Harry tried to ignore the throbbing need in his pants.  And his throat.  And his hands.  And his lips.
Draco cleared his throat and inhaled deeply.  “I may have been in the wrong in blaming you.”  He bit his lip, gaze intent on the center of the table.  “Possibly motivated by jealousy.”
Ron’s head snapped to glare at Harry.  “Harry! You knew about this?”
“Ronald Bilious Weasley!” Draco yelled, body a tight plank.  “Do not bring puppies into this house!”
Harry scoots over to him, lays a kiss on his shoulder, and runs a hand down his back. His skin is feverish to the touch, but Harry’s the only one sweating. “How did you avoid sending Blaise up in… well… a blaze?”
The fingers of Falk’s unoccupied hand danced a dysrhythmic jig on his thigh, and Harry thought it looked suspiciously like Malfoy’s movements while healing Ron.  And Magnus had scars between his fingers, now that Harry was looking.  As many or more than Malfoy.
His tongue runs along the side of his palm.  He can’t see his hand without his glasses, so he’s giving his entire hand a tongue bath.  Like a kitten.
“Oh, uh…” Harry stammered.  “I tried to side-along him, and I guess we got separated.  Could you see if he’s here somewhere?”
So, she just hadn’t slept in a week.  And Pepper Up potion didn’t seem like a good idea, in case it caused issues with… pregnancy?
Eyes turning up to Malfoy’s face, he noted the man looked positively wrung out.  His color had been high when he started, and now he didn’t look much better than Ron had.
It was a very erect cock with a “thumbs up” next to it. Sent by Potter.
Draco looked up from his plate, dubious.  “Because he’s in charge of my case?  And parole?  And general existence?”
But, The Malfoy Situation.  Ron had agreed that really, since he didn’t know what he was getting into, focusing on the issues he

She was currently sitting, facing him, with her knees in front of her, eyes glazed, hips working small circles on his cock while her fingers stroked her clit.  Every little movement was torture as he held back his own climax to let her pursue hers.
“Well, we got your package, you know,” Pitchlynn continued, though Ron shook his head.  He hadn’t known what happened to the package.  “And I was just kinda curious why you sent us Horned Serpent parts like you did.”

Adams sat bolt upright in his chair, jaw hanging open.  His mouth clapped shut before he dared to speak.  “That’s… our favorite party game,” he said nervously.  “Of course.”

“And I don’t think there’s a real wizard tradition about courting and food shopping.”
“She’s a MediWitch, Harry,” Draco said, lifting the cup.  “Kos would be a professional trip for her, as would attending the twins’ birth in Slovenia with me and Magnus.”
Falk’s free hand came up to cradle Harry’s jaw, warm and smooth, and he fell headlong into those black drowning pools, absently noting a faint click.
office, he tried to remind himself.  He was responsible for oversight here.  He’d be here for meetings with the warden on a regular basis.  A disgusted shudder shook his shoulders.  Maybe Azkaban was another Ministry institution that was due for overhaul, too.
So profound, absurd creation; writ real in bones and meat.
“Uh huh. It just said custom order.”
Harry thought, more to himself.
“Suit yourself.” The bags of food are lifted from Harry’s arms, and he finds the countertop with his fingertips. Slowly, the room comes back into view, and he takes it in as Draco unpacks groceries.
Harry’s grin fades as he wonders why Draco felt the need to sneak his dirty laundry out. He could have just asked for the shirts. Or at least stayed when he stole them. He could have helped himself to Harry’s bed. And Harry.
“Just one receipt?”
“I’m sorry.

Surveying her shopping bags, filthy shoes, and backpack of leaves, she had to admit that Bute Park had been only marginally successful.  And that maybe she’d gotten a little carried away, having visited two flower shops, a gardening center, and the silk flower section of a craft store.  She had spent the entire afternoon snipping, arranging, rearranging, tying, retying, and overthinking.
“Cupcake!” Harry shouted, startling himself.

Harry pulled his face down as he rose to meet him, warm dry lips against slick, swollen ones.  Opening, searching, tasting, nipping, speaking without words, a language sans syllables.  Draco moaned, soft and eager as Harry released him.
I don't want to be at this baby shower.  I intensely do not.
She hated walnuts (“bitter”), toddlers (“sticky”), paperback books (“flimsy”), sandstone (“be sand, be stone, or fuck off”), shoes (“morally reprehensible”), and being small, though her daintiness may have kept everyone safe from her temper and magic both.
Draco’s questioning hum tickled her ear.  He knew what Ron was asking about.  The subtle motion inside her halted, and a long finger swiped the droplet off the tip of Harry’s cock and delivered it to her lip.
“She could have stayed, you know. I wouldn’t have minded.” Harry alternated mushrooms and carrots on his fork, lining them up just so.
Regret gnawed at him as he picked at the last muffin.  He’d shared entirely too much with her.  The Sorting Hat, Ernie, his juvenile obsession with her hips, the dream.
“Did you know you were my bogeyman?  Bogeywoman?” he asked softly, turning his head to run his lips down the scar on her forearm.

“I don’t know why you think I need to know outdated courtship practices, anyway,” she muttered, zipping up the bag.
The aroma wafting through the doorway smelled like fish and chips, but chicken noodle soup, and also cornbread dressing.  It couldn’t possibly be all those dishes, so it must be something even better.
“Was that so difficult, greedy witch?” he asked as he nudged her onto her side.
Unzipping the front pocket, she had to pull Crookshanks back by the scruff to keep him from diving in face first.
“I love you, ‘Mione,” he panted as he came to a stop. “I really, really love you. A lot.”
Ron sighed and wrapped his arms around her. She allowed him precisely three moments of a warm, sentimental hug before sliding ice-cold fingers down the back of his pants. He yelped and held her out at arm's length by her shoulders.

Luna stopped to ruffle his hair appreciatively, and he wondered if she’d ask who else had cut his hair.

He was fairly sure they’d intended for him to blow himself to kingdom come.  Running water would have been a more logical improvement.

“Okay,” she said, brushing crumbs off on her trousers, “if I outrank the werewolf, they’d show their neck, and then I’d do what?  Lick it?”
Draco watches him retreat, elbows swinging as he makes his way to the pitch.  Platinum hair brushes Harry’s ear, and goosebumps march down Harry’s arm.
, like the darkness spell.  Nox… stars.
Harry nodded emphatically.
The salary amounts the article threw around were jaw-dropping.  It didn’t look like loyalty to Magnus’ newly-created league was going to keep him in Ballycastle much longer.
“We used to count Pansy’s periods down like a New Year’s Eve ball drop.” He couldn’t keep from laughing to himself.  “She got so mad. It was great.”
Leave me comments.   Please.  Holy fuck.  It's literally the only way I know anyone reads past the first chapter.
Rummaging around, Luna managed to cobble together an assortment of apple slices, cold meat, and his leftover tea. She arranged it on a plate in the shape of a rabbit, with the second truffle as the eye.  Perfect.
“You know why.”
He watches a fox and a hound form an uneasy truce. One of them is orphaned, and one is wanted. One of them finds his own way, and the other is raised without mercy or kindness. One of them offers up his life for the other, and Harry knows down to his bones that the offer stands as long as he lives.
Ugh, she’d flat-out told him she didn’t want to spend the night, or snuggle, or make love.  She’d absolutely told him she wanted to fuck and leave, and he’d responded by begging her to stay and pouring his fucking guts out.  No wonder she left in such a hurry.  Stupid.
He shivered, and opted to brave the perilous voyage to the next room.  Shockingly, she let him, but he felt her staring daggers in his back the whole walk.  When he rounded the bookcase, she was standing, braced for combat, hands on hips, in the center of the open space.  A showdown, then.
“Will they…” she started.  “Will they think less of me for it, Draco?”
Harry pinched his nose and huffed a laugh.  Draco scowled at the laugh.  There was nothing funny about brazenly violating someone’s privacy and weaponizing the findings.
“Oh, a vixen. Very clever.”
.  More motion, more friction, more everything.
Maybe it had deserved that puncture wound.

catching up, in the case of Ron. He was obviously listening intently and several times opened his mouth to chime in, but quickly closed it and refocused on his food.
It would be fine, because he trusted that man more than he feared the Ministry.
Then again, the promise of a repeat of the night before last was enough to make her consider forgoing all platonic friendships.  That had been… something.  And the two of them were undeniably attractive.  Three of them, she mused.  Malfoy stripping off in her kitchen had been an unexpected treat.
“Ah, yes, my brilliant son.  And his equally fireproof accomplice.” She fixed Harry with a stern glare for good measure.

Draco shook his head.  “No, I wouldn’t go that far.  And yes, I’m taking the Azkaban Floo to Gringotts.”
Wheal Elvan was going to become a two-man Bacchanalia, and that was entirely too exciting a thought to dwell on.  But it meant Harry was probably going to be useless for at least a few more hours.
“I just don’t trust him.“ Ron muttered, crossing his arms.
Fleur admonished.  Draco huffed an embarrassed laugh at the Black family motto turned compliment.
Her fever had finally abated, and he’d looked pleased with himself.

Hermione beckoned with her hand slowly, encouraging him to continue.
Can I tell you a secret?
John had only said it once, and when Harry didn’t reply, he’d never bothered again. Three weeks later, he was on leave. The next Harry heard, he’d died.
Luna smirked and laced the rope through his armpits, binding his upper arms and shoulders to the frame of the high back chair.  The shimmery rope looked decorative, but it was deceptive. The slack would be just enough to maintain circulation in his hands after she’d secured them behind him.
Her admonishments had softened years ago after he reminded her that a wizard with an unutterable name had gotten him here.
“Harry Potter, private residence,” he whispered to the Floo.
Draco pushed his chair away, relieved to get their signatures, but already worrying about the issues he’d just created down the line.  Gardens?  They didn’t own any fucking gardens.
The Supreme Mugwump was literally levitating with rage, which Ron hadn’t thought was a real thing.  Hermione was highlighting lines in a pile of papers, which the Supreme Mugwump was copying down onto forms.  The forms were glittery gold ordeals that disappeared as soon as she threw them in the air.
Ron snorted a soft laugh.  “Figures.”

Gods, thought Harry, that wasn’t helpful.  She arched her back and slowly stood, finally turning to face him.  The bra he’d been waiting to glimpse was an elegant twist of black satin straps below and between her breasts, with fine black mesh composing the cups.
Zabini pulled his headphones off one ear, waited, and slid them back on. Parkinson looked up from the novel pinched in one hand, then shrugged. Her other hand sifted through the head of blond hair in her lap.

Futilely, he tried to shift his weight to one side, but couldn’t move his torso enough for it to make a difference.
problem, though.  Or at least not his responsibility.  If Granger were dead or tortured somewhere, it really had nothing to do with him.
Draco kept a hip in front of the hungry toddler, a watchful eye on both the boy’s balance and his knife.  A test bite of an apple from a basket drew an appreciative surprised grunt from him, and he sliced it while Lou watched, one tiny hand fisted in Draco's shirt.
Draco followed the waving ginger tail into the middle bedroom.  Russet-hued light poured in through the windows on either side of the bed, and he paused to admire the design.  He’d watched Ron putting furniture in the rooms, but hadn’t stopped to inspect it.  Rather Burrow-like.  A stack of books sat on the floor next to one side of the bed.  One drawer of a bureau lay open, haphazardly stuffed with clothes.  Cozy.
He took a step toward her and stopped.  There was a distinct possibility his hands were going to end up all over the very soft red sweater that clung to her breasts.  Living at home with his mum puttering downstairs had significant disadvantages.

Smiling, Ron wondered how that conversation had gone.  He couldn’t imagine Hermione being at all receptive to the suggestion she should learn about traditional wizard courting when she didn’t even seem keen on modern dating.
In dying soil.
He'd flung the words as a diversion.  A mental stumbling block to knock Potter off-track; to leave him flustered, inattentive.  An underhanded way to lighten the conversation, but much-needed in the face of Draco’s disquiet at the rising tide of
Draco’s thrusts took on new urgency as his groans pitched higher.  Harry dug his thumb in above the other man’s pubic bone, pressing on the length moving inside him.
The lecture on punctuation and grammar was itching to pour out of her fingers like righteous magma.  Shag him first, she told herself, and then you can rip into his language skills. Everyone loves a grammar check as pillow talk.  She realized she’d been staring at the screen when a second message appeared.

“More of a beer drinker.”
The woman in front of Ron finally put her phone away and looked up.  Her hair reminded him of Hermione’s, and he wondered if that’s what hers would look like in thirty years or so.
The Wizengamot box erupted in a cacophony of profanity and more than a few hexes thrown toward Falk and Metaxas as the two men took their seats.
“Harry Potter, please report to the bedside of Draco Malfoy immediately. Enclosed is a Portkey, which, if activated-“
Harry chuckled at something in his sleep and rolled over.  Malu twitched and kicked him in the arse, and he wrapped an arm around Ursella in response.
Harry set his mobile down and made a mental note to tell the Aurors to text less and email more.  So many tedious text messages.  Far more interesting was the argument between Draco and Ron.
From “Writings in Exile”
The note at the bottom of the last sheet is hand-written:
Collaborate with me?  Evade?
“Yeah, we’re on the same page,” he concurred.  “Or Harry and I, at least.  No idea about Malfoy.”
Maybe the receipt was evidence from a case. A clue he’d kept from a failed mission. Some kind of very important bakery heist. A cinnamon crumble crime syndicate.

Shacklebolt had melted onto his podium with his chin sitting on top of his forearms.  “Potter?  Is that acceptable?”
She watched Ron’s neck turn red as he hesitated, waiting for her reaction.  It took her a moment to catch his meaning.  He didn’t lay awake at night and daydream alone.  He was thinking about kids when he was
“No,” Harry says with a smirk.
“Ah, there’s that dimple!”

find such riches useful and meaningful.
Softly, Hermione opened the door to the tiny bathroom on the third floor, slipped inside, and immediately regretted it.  Quiet sobs came from behind the shower curtain.  Seizing the opportunity, she took his wand off the sink and set it on the floor behind the toilet, just in case this went exceptionally poorly.
Bryn, son, what can I say you haven’t heard?

“Mm hmm.”  His preferred topic of conversation would have been how torturously slowly he was going to make her come underneath him, but changing course now would seem suspicious.
It’s rather peaceful inside Draco’s jumper; soft cotton one side, cashmere on the other, and Draco’s slowing heartbeat in his ear.
“No,” Harry says with a smirk. “I want to know how I-“
He shifted his hips and slid himself out of her, but kept a tight hold of her.
Taking his hand in hers, she cradled it gently, looking up to him, and lapped the inside of his palm.
Well… I never.
Ron grinned and squeezed her tight.  “Thought the four of us might want two bedrooms sometimes.”
“I… I was Initiated by my grandfather.  My parents never knew.  And I Initiated my children and grandchildren,” she rambled, grateful to finally talk to someone about her family’s secret history with Blood Magic.  “Audrey and Fleur know.  But Arthur and my children don’t know.  They’d be furious.”
She chewed her lip in thought.  Mostly unaware that her hips were pressing at a rather pleasant angle.  What could be non-violent, non-sexual, and scare her off?  “Show me."  She leaned down to clonk her forehead indelicately against his.
There was a painted set for all four of them; mug, bowl, salad plate, and dinner plate. His own bowl was a riot of eagle, peacock, and abstract feathers.
Knuckle tattoos, nail polish, swathed in powder blue cashmere; Draco tosses hair out of his eyes and glances up at Harry. Cherry red lipstick is a stark contrast to his pale skin and pastel jumper. It almost hides his split lip and nearly distracts from a fresh bruise along his jaw.
We crossed paths at a few more parties.  He never talked to me, but sometimes he’d let me sit on his lap.”  Draco’s breath shuddered in, and he ventured a wary look up to Harry’s waiting gaze.  Soft fondness filled his grey eyes.
He flicks the lighter and a single spark flickers, but no flame, and Eric and the lighter are gone. No loud crack of Apparition. Not even a fucking breeze. None of the Muggles around him notice, or even turn to look.
Draco looked down at his own erection, the garish orange toy, and Harry’s shirt-covered length.  “This is a lovely threesome you’ve arranged.”
He looked entirely too comfortable, Malfoy thought.  Like he had a right to be in this bed.  And he could have been.  He could have brought Potter home from the Gala, he was all but certain.  Gods, he’d looked so fucking eager.  And he didn’t look disinterested now, but he knew better.  Potter was never actually interested.
His shoulders shuddered, and he stood to survey his handiwork. Definitely an improvement. It was a bit charming, in a Ruins of Pompeii kind of way.
Throwing the rocks had been immature, Harry thought regretfully.  He’d been so worried that Malfoy thought he was dating Falk that he hadn’t stopped to really think about whether storming his property was the best response.
Harry runs a hand down Draco’s side. His own mark might be a bit darker, but it might be the setting sun. And the lines over Draco’s ribs might be lighter, but it could be the angle.
A castle. A gorgeous ex-fiance Draco never technically broke up with.  Stress and questionable coping.

“Uh huh.” Harry’s shoes stick as they walk over dried, spilled fizzy drinks on the floor as they walk back through the cinema.

He grinned, sliding his hands up the backs of her calves to the crooks of her knees.
His back popped, and he grunted at the release as he melted into the warm rock.
"You know what."
She licked her lips, and leaned forward as her fingers stretched him open.  She rose up on her knees to hover her mouth over the tip of his cock, and whispered against it.

“Excellent.  Anything to get that hideous
But oh, no, not Draco Malfoy.  In for a penny, out a pound of flesh.
“Oh,” he said, examining it.
Harry nods, blinks tears away, and considers what he’d look like in earrings. Probably not terrible. People would get used to it.
“Granger, can I borrow this?” he asked, hoisting the massive hardback book up so she could see it.
Gods, his chest was on fire, and everything was fucking blurry and his throat felt like it was strangling itself.  But Ron was still waiting for a response, not caring that his best friend was dying in front of him.
She was as afraid of Lucius as Narcissa had been.  She chose to cut Narcissa and Draco off for the sake of sparing herself and her family from his wrath.  It felt cheap in retrospect.  And in the end, Narcissa had eclipsed Lucius’s cruelty.
Someone had gone to great effort in making these.  An obscenely thoughtful tribute to the male anatomy.  The indigo one was a touch thicker, and just a little less finely-sculpted.  The blue one was a hair larger yet, and also a bit smoother.  A good strategy, he thought with a shrug.

Malfoy shook his head, disappointed in his fellow menfolk. For as much as they likely built their lives around fucking, they didn’t seem to understand some basic biology.
Know no quarter.
“Fear doesn’t lead to good orgasms.  If any.  For example...”  Draco bit the inside of his lip and fought a wicked smirk.  “Ernie couldn’t come without socks on.  Ever.  Felt too exposed, I guess.”
“Oh!”  Fleur said with a start.  “
“Yes, I can
The Bludger, the blunt instrument of a human, took a towel from the rack, unfolded it, and wrapped the blood-streaked fabric around his fist.
It had become fairly routine, Harry had noticed; Draco dozing off around sunset.  He tended to wake for the day around sunrise, too.  When he was cooking dinner, he usually made a pot of coffee, but still faded fairly quickly after the sun had been down for a few hours.
, do you know what his last words to his son were? After he spat a Dark curse at him?”
A balding red head and sour face popped into his doorway with a quick knock.
Harry scanned for any hidden spells or charms, and came up empty-handed.  The cell smelled of damp rock dust and sea salt, but under that was a familiar scent of cinnamon and cloves.
Hips and shoulders,
Draco’s silence amplified the slick squelch of soap between Harry’s legs as he brusquely washed himself.
———————
Draco Malfoy was nothing but an exquisite burn around a thick cock.  He may have had a body beyond that.  One that was laid flat on its back, but he wasn’t sure.
“Does that happen often?” she asked.
“You gonna be alright today?” Ron asked, not wanting to pry, but knowing Draco had been wary of today’s date for over a decade.
Harry leans down over the basil to hide the dumb grin spreading over his face. Draco’s fox brain had decided Harry smelled
“Adverts?” Draco’s whispered question tickles Harry’s good ear, followed by trumpets from the speakers.
Not that Draco felt he was at his best, either.  Tripping through the halls of one’s own brain for days was never a fortifying experience.  And he’d spent his night dreaming, blubbering into his pillow for hours, then watching Potter sleep.  But at least he could be trusted with hot liquids.  Composure.
Draco shrugged, half-hearted.  “The Scandinavian League showed up, and they were big, and loud, and there was a kitchenette in the basement.”  He straightened and ventured a glance at Harry.  “And I wanted cake, but I couldn’t find my clothes to go out and buy one.  So I was naked, very drunk, and trying to whisk sugar and eggs with a potato masher when Magnus came down.”
Tears glittered in the corners of his eyes as he whispered, throat tight, “What did you say?”
Harry gasped, suddenly back in the hive.  The searing pain in his lungs was gone.  Godric’s glistening glans, that was fucking terrifying.  His heart hammered in his chest as he tried to slow his breathing.
————————
Draco grinned, head lolling back onto Harry’s shoulder.  “I love you,” he whispered, throat strained with the angle, voice hoarse.
Closing his eyes, they mercifully let the conversation die.
She reached up to tuck his hair behind his ear, fingers skimming to ruffle the back of his head.  Her nails began a gentle scratching above the nape of his neck, and his shoulders dropped as he sighed.
Pride radiated through her chest, her own reflected in his. Shuffling feet in the doorway drew their attention, and Harry’s form filled the space.
Janine’s gaze flicked between them and settled on Cassandra.  The humor drained from Janine’s face as she mimicked Cassandra’s hard posture.
Two men.
Eyes suddenly widening in alarm, Malfoy excused himself with a gracious nod.

, she did precisely that with her jeans, earning a frustrated huff from Harry.
“Oh. Yeah, okay,” the man whispered.
But the truth is, I wrote this alone.
But maybe they could.  He’d been kissing Draco.  Then biting Draco.  And stroking Draco while he came.  And cupping his balls, which were so warm against his hand, and…
”  Draco crooned, back of his hand against his forehead.
“Potter?” Draco asked softly.
Loon.  Magnus uses a box.  It’s like going through a file cabinet.  Very tidy.  Very efficient.  Very boring.”
What, you’d ask, would make them pull that stunt?
, go say goodnight.
“Fine!  But Vic, if you and Dominique gang up on me again, I’m telling," Ron grumbled, shuffling the deck.
Just a little bit of penetration was all she would need to finally come, but he refused to give it to her.
No, no.  Patently absurd!
Surprised by their shock, he looked up at Granger.  “Yes, there are at least three that I’m aware of. We designed the third one as a house project when I was a fifth year.”
“Yeah, sure.” Harry shrugs. His workshop won’t be busy.
The man’s eyes wandered up the edge of the doorway and lingered on faint stripes on the corner of the door. He went up on tiptoe and scratched a neat line with this thumbnail. The fresh line was a brighter white than other lines around it. The man picked something out from under his nail, examined it, smeared it between his thumb and finger, and smelled it.
She hid a snort behind one hand, “I have more faith in your sexual prowess than your decorating abilities, Harry.  But I might get you some throw pillows for your birthday.”
in the same room.  He shrugged.  She’d probably take the bait.
Lucius Malfoy is just universally unpopular.
Draco’s mouth fell open. “I forgot about the stars.”
“That’s the last of them,” he said, straightening slowly.  “The ink and glazes are in the small box with instructions.”
She sighed dramatically and left the podium to confer with the remaining Wizengamot members again.
Aurors in love.  Who’d have guessed?
Uncomfortable heat burned in his throat as he mulled Falk’s words.  Not the pufferfish.  The other one.  The bigger one. The dragon-sized one.
The dents in the walls weren’t from someone trying to walk through them, after all, but he’d have gladly fallen through the floor if he could.
“Hurry up!”
———————————
Hermione and Malfoy have the first of many serious discussions.
“Sometimes,” he said.  He rested his chin on the dry edge of the fabric.  “It was never much of a secret in Pureblood circles.”
“Maybe put it underwater?” Harry offered.
——————————
cumslut, then,” he said with a shit-eating grin.
Harry pulled back from the kiss to look at him.  “You’re so fucking beautiful.”
“This is leaving in your cunt, Granger.”
He wasn’t wearing underwear. She snorted softly in amusement, his hard cock suddenly ready and willing.
Leave me comments.   Please.  Holy fuck.  It's literally the only way I know anyone reads past the first chapter.
“I guess not,” she said sheepishly.
Draco hovers over a board that has the sharp tips of dozens of nails protruding from it. Strands of fibres are wound between the nails in a makeshift attempt at weaving, and the loose ends hang off the edges of the board.
.  Only one question left.  Maybe you can still salvage this.”
He blew a deep breath out between pursed lips.  This was why Harry slept on top of the duvet.  Wandering minds lead to wandering hands lead to Azkaban.  With a deep inhale came the faint scents of coffee and chocolate.
“Seeker.”
———————————
Draco hummed in agreement, resentment ebbing in on the tide as grief washed out.
He could make any manner of magic-cancelling equipment, firebreaks, security equipment.  So many things.  But so little time, seeing that preservation spells didn’t work on the parts.  He needed to store them somewhere cold, but that didn’t rely on magic to-
—————————————————-
A hot, slick grip encompassed Draco’s cock, and he shouted.  The building tension in his hips broke, and he came throbbing into Harry’s fist, but Harry kept moving.
Humor drains from Draco’s eyes as he fits the lipstick cap on with a click. “Disparage away, then,” he says resolutely.
He was going to go slap an Auror with a magazine.

Adams had finished the sausage rolls and looked ready for a nap.  His chin was cradled in his palms, and his eyes were blinking more and more slowly.
These?  Ammo.
He leaned his head over and touched the silver rope loop with his lips.  “Mm hm.”
“I’m gonna come in you so fucking deep, you’ll never get me out of you.”
The end.  Sort of.
Wide eyes met his gaze and Draco nodded slowly.  His eyes fluttered shut as his hand worked over his shaft, twisting a bit at the tip.  His other hand traced the lines of the dildo below him, but his shoulders slumped as he sighed heavily.
“No more than I am.” Draco rolls his eyes and budges over. “Sit. See, Blaiseybones? I’m in excellent hands. Or so I hear.”

He pulled back the curtain and stuck his head out.  Lou was covered head to toe in mud, some kind of burred seed pods in his hair.  His auburn hair was matted into clumps around the pods, made worse by drying, flaking dirt.  The tyke must have found his own appearance hilarious, given his peals of laughter.
And I'm a praise slut.
“Your parents know?”  She couldn’t see Lucius and Narcissa accepting that their son would ever grow up to be anything but his father.
And it would be perfect, because his ass hurt in the best way, and he was deliciously, perfectly tired and safe and warm and home.
Should have had them delivered by the shop, he thought, watching him take down his hair and sort it into a tighter ponytail.

Draco shrugged again, a soft smirk spreading.
He grazed the outside of her arse and waited, keeping gentle contact.  She sighed, and he felt the puckered muscle relax against his fingertips.  His eyebrows rose in soft surprise.
Light the hearth,
Eyes round with worry, Harry walked back toward Draco.  He suddenly looked as terrified as Draco felt.  “Do they get hurt?” Harry said, barely above a whisper.  “Do they die?”
The head of the bed had proven to be secure enough to withstand her gripping it for dear life while Ron drove into her from behind. And the foot of the bed tolerated a vigorous pounding by the Wizengamot. But the corners of the bed were, as yet, unproven.
“Cal, I think you can leave now,” Draco whispered, not looking up at him.  “And I don’t think you need to bother coming back.”
Crouching down in the water to rinse off, he wondered what her Muggle university process had been like.  Maybe he
“I wasn’t jealous of
Draco’s breath shuddered out over Harry’s chest hair, and Harry smiled softly.  Draco’s scalp was an erogenous zone.  His fingers alternated between carding through the platinum strands to Draco’s sighs, and gently grabbing hold of them while Draco whimpered and pressed his hard cock to Harry’s hip.
“Well, I suppose you could tell people.  Or show people.  I dunno, send Stephen an owl.  And then sit back and be surprised when nothing interesting happens.”
Harry rolled his eyes as Draco tugged at his waistband.  It wouldn’t be the strangest place they’d gotten each other off.  “If we get caught, I’m going to say you hexed me into it.”
The fox’s ears twitch, and he lifts his muzzle to growl a disagreement.
“Why did he bring me dishes?” he asked, frowning.
“So, I guess, only Purebloods can use it, and they’re super secretive about it, and only teach it to their own kids, and I didn’t honestly think there were wizards still using it.”  Ron tried to tone down his defensive ramble.  “Makes sense the Malfoys never gave it up, of everyone.  Racist pricks.”
Draco merely stared at him, face blank.  “Oh.”
That’s the life they’ve bought.
Bleary-eyed, she looked up to find Harry waiting in the doorway in a gray bathrobe.  “What happened?” he whispered, looking over his shoulder as Ron stirred and yawned demonstrably.
Watching Draco put a condom on was somehow more arousing than watching him get himself off, Harry thought, slipping a hand into his boxers to wrap around his own cock.  Probably, because when he finally put it on, if he ever got around to putting it on, Harry got to grip that hot, slick length.  In the meantime, he seemed perfectly happy to use up a whole lot of lube and erode Harry’s patience.
the weapon?”
True to form, Harry’s erection beckoned him from below the floral print of the satin skirt.  Tomorrow morning, he could wake Harry up with his lips and tongue, and not this fucking skirt.  It had served its purpose and earned its retirement.
He smiled softly to himself and leaned his forehead onto Harry’s dusty shoulder.  His Legilimancy traced Harry’s mind, gently offering up the dream he’d just had.  The girl with his eyes, with his accidental magical outbursts.  Harry’s barrier dipped, and he stilled under Draco’s touch as he watched.
According to Harry, that was an “inappropriate” response.  But arranging a threesome-turned-twosome-plus-judgemental-voyeur was an
“Yeah, yeah, I guess so.  Tomorrow.”
Draco nodded and sighed.  “I got two miserably sober days in Mag’s bed before they breezed in and demanded sanctuary.  Look, Harry.  Nothing about my relationship with Magnus was ever, or will ever, be normal.

“What?!” she jumped up off of Harry, pulling him out too quickly.  She winced at the sudden stretch.  More slowly next time, she told herself.
“You’ve been summoned by the witch with the itch,” Malfoy jabbed.  “Good luck.”
He nodded and slid them down flat, taking a second to chuck the pillows on the floor.  She moaned at the friction in changing positions, and resisted the urge to just sit up and ride him.
Harry released his grip and stroked Draco’s hair back from his upturned face.  Draco smirked and wiped his face with a finger, licking it clean.
He could have called over a week ago, and it was stupid to be so nervous.  It was an automated system, for fuck’s sake.  It wasn’t like some grouchy nurse was going to answer and yell at him for having a boyfriend.
“Oh, no, I just picked it up on the way in.  Why?”  Harry’s unease was growing rapidly, and he sipped his coffee to hide it.
Harry shrugged apathetically, but visibly relieved.
A thorough index was unexpected in a text this old, but very much welcome.  Flower arrangements and their meanings, decoding formal dances, home furnishings and their significances.  So many of these had to do with the hidden meanings behind everyday objects.  It was tedious.

Standing at the foot of the bed, she yanked her jacket off and threw it in a corner. Her fingers grasped the hem of her shirt, but a low hum of warning from him stopped her.
Eric shrugs and pulls his sleeve up. Robards’ breath hisses in as he takes in the raw, blistered skin that covers the middle half of Eric’s arm.
occurred to him that Potter would interpret holding his drink as a suggestion to consume it.  Nor that Potter would practically overdose himself on straight carnal desire out of boredom.
“I don’t…” Harry croaked.   Fucking pufferfish.  He sniffed.  “I don’t want to, Ron.”
“Huh,” he huffed.  “Articulate for someone who licks his own ass, aren’t you?”
“You’ll probably have to come to detention hall soon, cuz Felix can’t not fuck up-”
In addition, Lucius had gotten the Kiss at dawn.  That alone was a good enough reason go hide in bed and cry, but it didn’t upset him like it should have.  Relieved him, in a guilty, greasy way, as had Narcissa’s death.   It was like mourning the end of a plague, or the removal of a malignancy.  A welcome loss of life.

“Yeah, sure, mum,” Ron said, concerned.  They watched her leave.
It was more than a little humbling to see the life Malfoy had built in the matter of a few years.  The same years during which Harry had really only drudged through Auror training and tried to keep out of the press.
Not his pen.
Draco’s finger glides down to Harry’s entrance. He clutches Draco and moans; guttural and greedy. “Please.”
Harry tightened his fist and stroked a little faster.  A deep moan vibrated Draco’s chest as his back arched.  His hips snapped and he let out a whimpered shout and came.
“Ron!” she hugged him as though she could meld them together and never separate again. He held her like she was the last solid thing on Earth. Tears welled in her eyes, and she hid them against his chest. He did the same, burying his face in her hair.
Harry crossed the room to inelegantly smash his face against Draco’s shoulder blade.  His arms snuck around Draco’s waist, pulling him in tightly.

Ah, this was a tricky one, Draco thought.  How to politely decline a very desirable job offer while being insulting?

Potter handed what was left of the beer over to him with a sheepish grin.
Rough, tanned hands skimmed thumbs back and forth over the velvet next to his legs, and he watched them with trepidation.
Except when they absolutely, enthusiastically, vociferously do.
He flinches and huffs a laugh as Draco wrings out one last drop before releasing him. Draco’s lips are slick, and lush, and pink, and salty as he kisses Harry, and beautiful even without lipstick.
“Ron!” Hermione scolded.
Harry’s breath fell in a groan, and hissed back in.  “Fuck, Draco.”
Harry mumbles something in his sleep, and I’m pretty sure it’s about food, because he then hums and chews on empty air.  Maybe he’ll bite his tongue.  I hope he doesn’t, though. For entirely selfish reasons.  Fun fact.  St Potter is the patron saint of sucking cock.  I saw it in a cheap porno rag on Knockturn, and I’d be hard pressed to prove them wrong.
“My, how the tables have turned, Weasley,” he hissed sarcastically, still clutching a handful of silverware.  “
Draco’s breath came out in a rush.  What would he have done if Harry had had any other reaction?  Excused him from duty?  Bought him parenting books?  Signed him up for classes on changing diapers?

Stick the landing.  Surprise attack.
“She sounds awful,” Hermione joked weakly.  “I knew a pretentious Pureblood boy who did something rather similar.”  Her hands ran up and down the outsides of his thighs slowly.
She ripped into the fish enthusiastically, and he smiled.  He would tell Potter tonight to just deliver messages in person.  He seemed unable to stay away for long, anyhow.
“It’s a wizard disillusionment charm.  Hides the wards from wizards and Muggles both.  You have to expect to find the wards to find the wards.”
Harry protested that he wasn’t experienced.  Robards countered that Harry was unlikely to retire and pass the buck.
“Ahem.  Yes.  Hello,” he stammered.  “I am Mentor Metaxas, and I am the Chair of the ICW Quidditch Committee.”
It was a bit of a risky request, but sharing their experiences with Harry had become a habit.  He’d also shared some memories of Magnus, and she’d given him glimpses into her forays in Perth.  It was an odd kind of bonding, but not one they had anyone else to share it with.
Draco chuffed a weak laugh.  “My penchant for the dramatic isn’t

He flinched and closed his eyes as the shadow shifted with a wet plop.  The head rolled free, he hoped, conflicted over using his mum’s kitchen spells for such nefarious purposes.
“Talking out your arse,” Malu shot back.
“Oh,” he squeaked, accepting the card with numb fingers.  “Thanks.”

Harry’s wry chuckle doesn’t quite hide his disappointment. He’d had every intention of fucking in this kitchen. He tugs his shirt down and adjusts his trousers, whilst Draco steps around to the other side of the kitchen island.
“Ahh, you cunt of a bird!  Go!” Malfoy yelled, flinging his arm out the window.  She cawed ruefully, and took flight.
Onasis closed his eyes and exhaled deeply.  “Thank you.  You look nice, by the way.  The trench coat suits you.”

Hermione and Ron gaped, slowly turning to each other.  Harry leaned against the window frame, watching the winged silhouette disappear between buildings.

While these two hearts beat.
Her hand reared back for a playful slap to his arm, but froze.  He tried to hide a soft smile watching her curtail her response, grateful she’d taken his words to heart.  It had only been weeks since she’d taken a swing at him and accused him of plotting against her.  It would be a lot longer than that before he forgot about it.
Somehow, telling Weasley and Potter was worse than reliving it all in the Pensieve with Robards.  At least Robards had plied him with chocolate.
The man flicked open a small panel, turned a nob, snapped it shut, and made his way to the small kitchen. He turned the tap on and watched it run. He didn’t touch the water to check the temperature, nor did he look up from running it straight into the drain.
Harry taps the stack of mail against his desk, and a small, glossy ticket falls out. Enchanted paper with a photo of a fireworks display overlaid with the golden Gringotts logo.
The fur against his lips melts away, and the bed sinks down along Harry’s side. His chest is pressed against warm skin, and a hand pins him to the mattress as Draco rises up over him on all fours. His hair sticks up at odd angles as he looms over Harry, grey eyes livid.
“Not…” she sniffed. “Merlin, Ron, not like this.”
Potter had, probably accidentally, brought along spectacularly appropriate libations.  A dash of the dry Riesling had perked the soup up perfectly.  Potter had watched him with open suspicion. Like he was dosing the tureen with a bottle of Living Death.
“Gonna slip him your lipstick?” Pansy asks with a wink.
Luna could probably get Hermione out of this pinch, he thought.  Too dark to fly, though.  The Floo would get Floo powder on his muffins.  With a gasp, he realized he could Apparate.  He could Apparate
“Romantic.  Your turn, Dad.”
“Comfortable?” She stopped to check with him.
Draco chants it like a summoning, a benediction, until he's coming on the tile between his feet, and his clenching arse tips Harry over the edge.
Ron huffed, “Apologizing
“Funny,” Draco huffs, and turns his face to Harry. “A creative combination of water conjuring spells and fireproofing charms. None of which either of us are capable of.”
Granted, you’ve brought me other thread.
“Shit.”
Ron flooded her mouth and moaned her name, while Harry pulled her down by the waist and held her tight, spilling himself in her with a shout.  Her core milked him in small squeezes as Ron withdrew himself, and she steadied her breathing.
Draco cracks one eye open to look at Harry. “That bread would make excellent toast.”
——————————
But, no longer.  Now, it was chock full of family, and warmth, and feet that wiggled under his legs, and riotous curls that tickled his nose.
He smirked, and relaxed with a soft hum as her fingers wrapped around his hardening length.  “Wanna pretend to make a baby, ‘Mione?”
She grinned, and tugged his face back with a grip on his hair.  Her lips brushed over his.  “I love you, too, Ron.”
“Toss me through the Floo.”
He nodded, and she grinned around the head of his cock.  It should have looked silly, he thought, but it was comforting.  She was comforting.  Trustworthy.  Plus, she had small fingers, he thought.  If he were going to let someone touch his ass, better it be someone with small hands.
“Oh…” she whispered, eyes distant.  “Okay, then.”
The words felt different than when she’d said them to Ron. With Draco, it felt well-reasoned and a sensible admission. Not the romantic, blurted confession in the Burrow garden.
“Oh, bloody hell,” Ursella whispered, and stepped forward.
Malfoy glared at him over his hand, licking the wound one last time before drawing it away for inspection.  “Are you here to tell me to be nice to Potter?” he asked snidely.
Sweat-soaked black curls stuck to the man's forehead, and he wiped them away as he followed Draco into the hall. The wall was dented, a sharp hole in the plaster, just above Draco’s ankle. His gut churned as he watched it pass.
Draco’s lips tightened in a tight light while he thought.  “Yes.  I don’t know how or why, but Narcissa won’t be an issue.”
“The Ministry and the Wizengamot are being absolutely wallpapered in sanctions from the International Confederation of Wizards, love,” she replied.  “It’s… not good.”
She shot him a challenging glare over her shoulder, somehow threatening even on her hands and knees.  He cringed and mouthed an apology.
The crystal ball and Ron’s ring had shown him the same thing.  Magnus Falk, naked and tousled, asleep in a bed with a delicate cut between his fingers.  Rather specific.  Rather enough to panic about.
Don’t be silly, what backlashes?
“You’re sure Harpies keep their last names?”
“Again.”
Grey eyes roll toward the glass ceiling and stay there while the fox sighs.
It was a daunting amount of… crap.  Expensive, luxuriant, valuable crap.
Far more impressive was the fucking piano next to it. Why they thought he wanted a piano, he had absolutely no idea.
Curls brushed along his chin as she nodded.  “I don’t trust it.”
Deft fingers trailed down Harry’s abdomen, following the line of dark hair to its conclusion.  He was half-hard even before Draco squeezed the base of his shaft.
Her fingers tweaked his nipple, and he squeaked.  She caught the other one in her lips, and he hummed softly as he relaxed back down.  “I hate sitting in class listening to lectures on Muggle law and then
“You did.”
“What the fuck are you wearing? And what time is it?”
up for dinner, ‘Mione?”
She felt her eyes grow wide with comprehension. “It is.”
Ron stood next to the sink, finishing off a glass of water as he grunted a non-reply.
Out of the corner of his eye, he could see a pen twirling in thought.
Dead and gone.  Capstone Death Eater.
Falk huffed in amusement on his way to the platform, and Harry smiled.  He could never tell Connie to fuck off.
A gentle snowstorm of sentencing, flakes swirling and flowing together.  The box on the left, marked with a silver circle, accepted every piece of parchment.  None drifted to the semi-circle-adorned box in the center, nor to the box on the right with a black circle.
Flourish & Blotts, 2021
“Are you okay to Apparate?” Malfoy inquired, squinting at him.  “Once splinched, twice shy.”
“I fudged the paperwork so the sentence started the morning of the day it was passed, and maybe worked it so it was over at the end of business for the preceding week.”
“I will,” he replied, too calmly.  “In a bit.”

“Malfoy!  Fuck!  We were busting up rock and then he was screaming and bleeding and then he stopped moving and I can’t fucking Apparate like this and I can’t get him to the Floo and everybody’s gone and-” Potter continued, but Malfoy had garnered what he needed already.

That familiar, clandestine sympathy that gagged him when he thought about how much he understood the rage that came with being an abandoned half-blood in a society that felt little to no obligation toward them.  He’d never told anyone, not even Ron, that he

Proportional again, he thought, stooping to pick up his t-shirt.  He did have to give Falk credit, though.  For as awkward as he had seemed standing around fully clothed, when he posed, he fucking owned it.
His release splashed down her hand, on his belly, and across a thigh.  Her finger pressed as her hand milked the last drops from him.
Draco:  I feel abandoned and regret oversharing and have crippling self-doubt now.
Crookshanks rounded the corner, like his assistance had been personally requested.
He was still only a few inches taller than her, but had grown significantly. Wide shoulders tapered down to a rather nice, round rump clad in revealing jeans, if denim could be thin and tight enough to be revealing. Which, apparently, it could be. The jeans showcased strong thighs and stretched over the front of his hips without giving much of a preview.
Harry shook the proffered hand, grateful someone was talking to him at all.  Embarrassed, he noted how sweaty his hand was compared to the coolness of the Goblin’s palm.
The sound of running water grows louder, and Draco sighs in Harry’s ear from a room away. Plates drop from Harry’s hand, but land safely on the chopping board. Draco groans under the spray of hot water, and Harry’s nipples tighten as he tries to ignore it.
“From behind.”
Harry suppressed a chuckle.  She looked like she’d just slipped off a broom and barrel-rolled halfway across a field.
Ron snorted a laugh and several people turned to look.  A wizard across the aisle in a white button-down, bolo tie, jeans, and leather boots gave him a long appraisal.  It wasn’t the first time he’d been on the other end of the man’s dark gaze.  Nosy cowboy-looking weirdo.
“I am working,” Harry retorted. “I’m… monitoring my parolee.” Harry nuzzled into Draco’s hair as the other man pulled Harry’s fingers up for a kiss.

“Doubt any of that was wrong, though.  Illegal, maybe,” Ron pointed the handful of menus at Harry for emphasis, “but not

Ron threw Harry a towel, quietly envying Harry’s abs, but knowing damn well he wasn’t willing to go through the training Harry did.
Yeah, no shit, Falk, Harry thought, slamming the box shut, waiting for it to evaporate.  Pale blue glow fading slightly, it sat, waiting to be reopened.  He heaved himself out of his chair with a groan, and went in search of coffee.
I’m sure it burned to ashes,
“What?” Draco whispers.
He had to scoot inside on one elbow, cake on an open palm like a serving tray. Inside, Harry lay on his side in nothing but his boxers. Every line of his body was exactly as Draco remembered, and he tried to catch casual glimpses. The straight line of Harry’s shoulders. The curving indentations of his abs. The crease of fabric over his groin that made Draco wet his lips.
*********************************
“Would anyone like to explain to poor simple Harry and I what the fuck you’re on about?” Ron asked, getting up to retrieve the paper ball and depositing it in the bin.

“Mm hm,“ she hummed softly, letting the offer hang in the air between them.

Slowly, he shifted to trail kisses down between her breasts.  His lips ghosted across her navel and his shoulders settled between her thighs.
Hermione wasn’t gobsmacked by the famous Harry Potter, and it was a little unsettling.  Maybe this hadn’t been a great idea.  Was he supposed to kiss her?  Hold her hand and tell her she was pretty?
“So, there was an old Death Eater safe house in St. Petersburg.  We got there in October of ’98.  It was awful.  A moldy, leaking, rotten townhouse infested with rats.”
Ron nodded.
basement?”
“Draco?”
The Ministry knowing Malfoy’s whereabouts was certainly news to him, even as a more senior Auror.  Harry nodded Malfoy into the room and closed the door behind him. This wouldn’t be a great way for Hermione to meet her neighbors. “I was betting against Hermione being able to find you,” he half-lied.
But those truffles.  Why did each have a truffle in front of it?  Could he simply take the truffles?  They
“Hm, a little.” She stroked his hair back from his forehead, and wiped a finger under each eye. He sighed and sagged into the ropes.
“My idea,” he chuckled.
“Best keep that head on your shoulders, Supreme Mugglerump,” Draco murmured as he appeared between the bookcases.  He leaned down, kissed the top of her head, stole her empty mug, looked in it, and pouted.
Draco darts forward and snags a handful of what look like posh little sausage rolls. He tosses two in his mouth with an appreciative shoulder wiggle. “Venison,” he mumbles, mouth full. “Want some?”
“No…” he whispered to himself.  The Source number matched Malfoy’s identification number.  Malfoy was the source witness for absolutely hundreds of crimes against his own father.  Had he testified willingly?  Was that how he’d gotten such a short sentence in Azkaban?  Why were the incident dates so spread out?
Hermione!  You'll get yours in the next chapter!
He’s still careful, though. He doesn’t bring him coffee when he goes up to the Atrium for his tea, even though he knows exactly what Eric orders. Cream, but they never have it, so milk instead, but no sugar. He doesn’t hold doors for him, or pick up the Muggle ink pens that roll off his desk, or any of the small courtesies one would expect.
———————————————
“Alright. I’ll get my coat.”
Dropping his chin back down to her hair, he muttered, “Alone, this time, greedy witch.”
Stealthy little squibs on boats,
Worth a try.  And texting Harry was a hell of a lot faster than waiting in line for the Truro public Floo to contact Ron.  And then what, have that conversation within earshot of everyone in the Weasley kitchen?
“It’s a date!”  She shouldered her rucksack and shouted over her shoulder.  “Love you!”
Malfoy shrugged.  “Haven’t had much use for a broom in years.”
Hermione:  I am developing feelings and am going to blaze out of here now.
Harry was confused.  He had no idea what that seal was, or what Malfoy could have gotten in an envelope that was so terrifying and thrilling at the same time.
What if he didn’t
Perfect!  Darkness…
“Yeah, I guess.  But like, we’ve just been divvying them up kind of randomly, and this one is important.”  Adams bit his lip and looked down, cocky facade cracking slightly.  “And most of us don’t know a Muggle prison from a Muggle dungeon, if you catch my drift.”
Draco’s head popped up, and he bit Hermione on the thigh before rolling over and scooting up next to her.  He grinned and wiped a hand down his face before pinning Harry with his gaze and licking the hand clean.
Pitchlynn hummed in thought, transferring his hands to his back pockets.  “And why go through the Choctaw and not MACUSA?”
Harry frowned in confusion.
Draco shrugged, letting a fall of blond hair obscure his face. “She is, but I’m very pretty, and she likes… We were betrothed, you know, and we…”
“Auror Potter, you may begin presenting evidence to support the charge of murder.”  Codger motioned to the enormous Pensieve and vials.
A dark chuckle rumbles through Draco’s chest as he presses his lips to Harry’s, all demand and possession. He mouths his way to Harry’s nipple, then nips a line lower. Harry’s heart thunders in his chest, and his skin runs hot under Draco’s lips.
Malfoy chewed a lip and folded his glasses.  He went to hang them on his shirt collar, only to be reminded he wasn’t wearing one.  A chill skimmed up his arms, and he wished he’d put one on, but damned if he was going to invite Potter in while he dressed.
*********************************
Harry shrugged, one shouldered and softly bewildered.  “I wanted it to go faster, so it did.  And I wanted to watch it again, so I did.”
“Let go,” she said, punctuated by small kisses along his jaw as she settled her weight onto his hips, riding him in short strokes.
He withdrew again, and she whistled high in understanding.  They were both very alone.
“I’m your Auror.  I can’t…” Harry whispered, the excuse feeling worn out.
Blaise wraps an arm around her and squeezes. “You know you can come back any time.”
To dance with death is one thing, but even braver yet,
He didn’t look the type to smoke on a weekday morning, which begged the question of what he was intensely daydreaming about.  Blue eyes blinked rapidly below dark brows, and he inhaled deeply, coming back from wherever he’d been.  Adjusting in his seat, he caught her watching him and smiled sheepishly.
“Happy Yule,” she said to no one,
His shoulders swayed slightly with the music, giving his body something to do while he waited.  He could be patient.  Especially if it meant going home with Malfoy.
———————————
Harry’s chuckle sent sweat running lines down the sides of his waist.  “And?”
*********************************
Harry watched as Malfoy’s hands slid to a cupped position over the wound, his lips stilling and eyes opening.
Ron shrugged, a contrast to the suspicious squint to his eyes.  “Sorry you lost your chance to rescue Kneazles, mate.  Beer’s in the cooler there.”
drawer left of the sink,” he said as he acted out his own instructions with his eyes closed.  Bit cute.
Ron turned over his opposite shoulder to shoot her a questioning look.  She raised her eyes to the ceiling in thought.  “My mother’s… second-cousin?” Fleur said with a squint.   “Yes.  He is… like the Minister of Healers?”
“Fair enough.”  Harry nodded in acquiescence.   “So you got together over a nude bakeoff at an orgy full of ballerinas and Quidditch players?”
They were interesting, and distracting enough to tug his mind away from his existential dread long enough to refocus.
Harry slunk in through the door like a drunk teenager at dawn.  “I, well,
Harry’s face dropped as his heart cracked, and a cold burn trickled behind his ribs while his cock twitched, unaware.    Glass, he thought.  Heart chambers pumping nothing but broken glass.  His vision blurred as tears welled.

Brown eyes rounded in sheer terror looked up.  “Uhm… Werewolves can’t be Aurors.”

“Sure. I’d hate to Apparate in and find you half-naked,” she said mockingly.
No charter of the blows or beaten.
Harry frowned, trying to recall ever hearing Malfoy say that.
Flourish & Blotts, 2021
Falk’s subdued baritone chased him.  “Slow down, Potter.  We have a breakfast date, do we not?”
Burgock sputtered, flabbergasted, and replied, “That was my first impression, as well.  A rather good one, too.  But no, it was made by a Black.  And so, as is our custom, it is yours.”
“I saw the headlines, Harry.”  She busied herself switching lenses.  “It would sure suck if Robards sent you back here for a full shoot.”
Connie nodded appreciatively.  “Bold move.  I like it.”
“You’ll need a bigger table, Mum,” he said, swallowing thickly.  “The babies are due to start arriving in five months, you know.”
A pop of Apparition shook the plate glass windows of the living room slightly, and he saw his Harpy in his Mum’s garden. He grinned and took the last of the items out of his bag and let them expand on the table. Pots, pans, lanterns, bedding, rugs, all of it dusty and oddly perfect.
Harry went to laugh at the joke, but realized it wasn’t a joke.  His face froze in quiet consideration.  One sleepy, heavy-lidded grey eye examined him from over his bicep.
********************************
The hat smelled like stale crisps, and she didn’t care which bloody house it sorted her into, so long as it had shampoo and plenty of hot water.  It slid over her head, resting on top of her curls like a disgusting, judgemental halo.
Feeling confident, she slid her hand over his and lightly traced the line of his tattoo.
“Oh, thank Merlin,” Harry enthuses.
Draco bit the inside of his lip, face softening.  “Magnus didn’t ask, did he?”
Whether dragon hatchlings would eat this or if Basilisks were immune to fire, he had no idea.  He might just end up with very hot Basilisks and a dead hatchling.
“He was just looking out the window behind us.  Since when were

He rose up to catch her lips, and she balked.  Rejection coiled, molten, in his gut.  The humor in his eyes evaporated, and she cringed.
He snorted a laugh and set her injured wrist on her knee. “I wouldn’t advise it, no.”
Ron gestured around the flat.  His stupid flat they all hated.  His impersonal quarters even he had to admit he disliked.

He earned his place.
Draco’s fingers tap up the front of Harry’s robes, button by button, until he bites his bottom lip and flicks the top one open. “And I do love a man in uniform. Second only to a man out of one.”
She reached down and touched his foot, pushing her own thoughts back to him.
He chuckled, tight-lipped, mouth full of his last muffin.  “No, I mean the actual date.  But good to know.”
Malfoy huffed a laugh.

Harry’s breath stopped, and he turned to look at Draco.  Surely, he’d misheard.
“Second, he needed a haircut.  From a mother.”  She paused, wand busy with vegetable chopping.
Brik-a-brak,
and lain in beds of weeds,
Her cleft parted smoothly over the head of his cock, and those worries evaporated into the bliss of sliding into her heat in one luxuriously long stroke.
Harry shakes his head at the offering. “Ah, no. Not too keen on meat, to be honest.”
Clusters of people walk past them, banners and team logos everywhere.  All different languages, but a lot of Greek.  Not surprising, given the location.
Warm, smooth fingertips lifted from Harry’s lips too soon.  He caught Draco’s wrist and pressed the fingers back to his lips in acceptance.
The third column should have been the charge, but every line repeated “Statute Pending”.  That was odd.  Either something was or wasn’t a crime.
Rolling her eyes, she slid out of bed to get dressed.  “I said I’m fine.  My entire day tomorrow will consist of hot, steamy textbook passages.  I’ll even stay in bed, if it makes you feel better.”
Emboldened, Harry grinned.  “How long, then,
Not a question, Harry noticed.  A decree.
Ron took one last appraising glance at Draco as he stepped back to the Floo.  Definitely going to talk to Harry about leaving him in such a state.
What if Narcissa had been able to send Liore to another family?  What if he had an older sister?  What if they’d met at Hogwarts?  What if they’d been sorted into the same House?

Her hand slowly skated down the curve of her breast, raised goosebumps as it trailed the slight hollow of her waist, and settled on her hip bone.
He patted her on the ass and she rolled over.  A lazy, content smile graced her face, but her brows were knit in mock offense.  “You skipped a contraception charm on the word of a Death Eater,
Draco's stunt pays off.  Harry's day improves immeasurably.
Draco’s lips smell like popcorn and cinnamon, but his mouth tastes like toffee as he kisses Harry’s spit-slick lips. Harry groans into Draco’s open mouth and fumbles his own jeans open. He shoves them down around his thighs and wraps a hand around his throbbing cock.
“I… may have. At Yule. I told him I’d bring him a full-size Cooper, whatever the hell that is, but then he was crying and Andromeda said he needed to go to bed. Then she wrapped up a piece of cake and hustled me out the door.”
“He used to host dinner parties,” Harry blurted, lips tight.  “According to Falk.”
One of her fellow students had his chin cradled in his palms and was staring, glassy-eyed at their instructor, who was interpreting this as rapt interest.  The guy either had a vivid imagination or half a leftover spliff in his pocket.
“Sure. Want some help?” he offered.
For deft of knife, clean flesh regrown.
“Not till June.”
“Right, well.  How much do you know about the Auror deaths in the Durmstrang raid?” Robards laced his fingers together and began.

It was a little disorienting, he thought, to grip and stroke, but not feel it from the other side.  Was he holding it too tightly?  Not tight enough?  He bunched up some of the satin and stroked it in his fist around the head of Draco’s cock, and the man absolutely

Her joke fell flat and she looked to Luna.  “Who’s even left, Lu?”

Harry watched Ron’s reaction, confused.  He didn’t expect Ron to leap into Malfoy’s arms, but the man had just saved his life.

to the smoldering box, and escaped out of the building as it hissed and steamed, scraps of charred paper flowing out onto the lobby floor.
She hummed in non-committal agreement.
Two sharp raps on the door froze his renewed stroking, and he waited. The door opened, and the man walked in, looked around the floor, and stepped toward Draco, lips parted to ask a question.
Ron shrugged and accepted plates from Draco, setting them on the corners of the futon.  “Want the blood for wards?”
Merlin knows.
“Language.”
.  Hm.
Draco’s breath hissed in as he pulled the skin taut down his shaft and ran a thumb over the swollen head of his cock.  Harry leaned forward over Draco’s hips, but was pushed back to his cross-legged seat by a hand against his shoulder.
“I… Okay.  Councilwoman Granger.”  Adams took a deep breath and straightened against the stiff back of the wooden chair.  “Yes.  I am.”
“No, no,” she laughed, finally easing.  “It was just a convenient vessel.  For urine.”
“Sorry, I just, um…”  Harry slid the cord down and carefully wound it around his palm.  “What’s wrong?”
What would Ron think when he got to the girl who looked like Potter?  That ought to give him pause.  Or maybe he wouldn’t see the resemblance.  That wasn’t a bridge they needed to cross, anyway.
Hermione is introduced to Draco's prostate.
It had to be hundreds of years old, she thought. The script inside was barely comprehensible English.  Merlin, though, it was gorgeous script.  The margins were intricately filled in with delicate animation.  Hell, the artwork alone was probably as informative as the text.
Lucius hummed in approval.  “Well, return the rings to my vault.  Unless you think the Lovegood girl is an option?”
Draco was too quiet, and Harry wondered if he should have just nagged Hermione again to get his post.  London simply wasn’t very Draco-friendly.  He’d let out a startled squeak when an ambulance drove by, flinched as Harry’s neighbor’s door slammed shut, and slunk behind Harry down to his post box and back without so much as a word.
“I mean, text me before you pop in, but yeah.  Way better than whatever Floo Cardiff apparently offers.”
Draco was absolutely having an existential crisis instead of a nap, and it was decidedly not restful.  The noon sun was usually enough to make him nod off, but today, sprawling in bed and contemplating his overall reason for living won out.
But he couldn’t just
“Are you sure that’ll be enough?”
Hermione’s heart thudded against her ribs.  Harry did like it kind of rough, especially compared to Ron.  But then, so did Draco.
“Hmm… It would be a shame, but I would think that ragamuffin would need to have something of value.”
Crookshanks hissed at the window and bolted under the bed.
,” he crooned, letting his voice echo. “Do you know how to get in touch with Cal or Baz Onasis? I need to send something to their mother.”
“How did I not…” Harry trailed off, both angry at Ron for not telling him, and angry with himself for not figuring it out.
Malfoy cleaned his face wandlesssly, and Harry’s bracelet lit up.  He wasn’t supposed to be using magic outside his wards.  He knew that.  Why would he risk it for something so minor?
She would forever treasure the memory of him screaming and clutching a shirt to his chest for cover while his bottom half was still on full display.
Draco!  Potter is not to be trusted with your immobilized ass!
"  He chuckled lightly to himself.
Even his office was fucked.  Senior Aurors got rather large offices, and now his was crammed full of file cabinets and Pensieve storage.  The crumpled tissues surrounding the garbage can didn’t help the aesthetics.
The picture of The Chosen Cock, as she was calling it, on her laptop was very distracting.  It had a habit of taking up the whole screen while she was trying very hard to type up an essay.  And then it just sat there, daring her.
His laughter shook her torso, and he relaxed his hold.  She slid down to eye level with him.  “My deepest, darkest secret, I’m afraid.”
“You’ll… fuck me?” Draco held his gaze in a soft plea. “Maybe?”

He turned and watched the two women discussing their plans as Connie wound her hair up into an effortless chignon and secured it with two long silver pins from her bag.  She slipped glasses on and critiqued Basilia’s set, lighting, and general existence.  Basilia withered, and Harry tamped down a smirk.

“I hope she throws her knickers through.” Pansy mused, brushing his hair away from his upturned cheek.  “I bet she’s completely soaked them, the greedy little witch.”

He scoops up a bit too much Floo powder and let’s some pour back in the bowl on the pedestal. Goblins watch him from the teller kiosks, and he’s keenly aware of the pointed ears waiting to eavesdrop on his destination. Draco had already left his office for the evening, but Harry wasn’t sure if-
Draco leaned his hips back and lowered his shoulders, forehead on his forearms on the ledge.  Harry pulled back and thrust forward in one long stroke, and Draco groaned, low and guttural against his own skin.  Encouraged, Harry found a rhythm, pulling whimpers and moans from Draco as he stoked the growing heat in his groin.
Draco glared at him, fighting a smile.  “Did you just call me like a Kneazle?”
Boxes of dishes sat on the hearth rug, instructions and glazes already unpacked.  The bowls, in particular, were a lovely size and shape.  Just enough of a rim to tap a spoon on, but not over-wide and likely to chip.  Big enough to serve a soup as a meal, but not so big as to cool it too quickly.
“Last one in has to wash their own arse!”
Harry chuffs a laugh and reaches behind Draco’s neck with both hands. “You went back for more Disney films, didn’t you? Let me tie it on and dab it with resin.”
————————————
“I… no, probably not.” Harry admitted, wrapping his arms around his middle.  The edges of his vision felt blurry, and he wiped his glasses to no avail.
“Council Member Granger has yielded the boar,” Draco mocked, addressing Hermione’s ass, “if you do not object, I’d quite like to snog this hog a while.”
Harry’s gut lurched at the idea of Ron being privy to Malfoy wanking, but he ignored it.  He rummaged through Ron’s shirts, pulling out one he’d loaned Ron years ago.  Ron tossed him a pair of jogging shorts.
“Does he still keep his socks on during sex?”
“Mum, what are they doing, exactly?”  Ron finally leaned over to ask.  His mum had been following the proceedings with a level of attention that only the informed could maintain.
, leaving the rest of the plates behind.  The door slammed behind him, and Hermione came back from the bathroom, thoroughly confused by the outburst.
This was… different.  This felt… foundational.  Like they were finding new footing together.  Blasting down to bedrock.  Something that was a home, and a family, and maybe more.
The lazy humor drained from the grey eyes as he watched Harry, and his fingers slipped from the belt loops.  “Oh.  Not a quick trip and then you pop right back, then?”
That was a much better plan than letting anything happen with Malfoy.  His presence had always weighed heavy, but at least he knew where they had to stand.
“The Gringotts Board of Directors has made the difficult decision to discontinue our relationship with the Ministry of Magic.  It is simply not advantageous for us to do business with an organization so heavily sanctioned by the International Confederation of Wizards.
“I… yeah,” Harry said, stalling as he looked over the familiar faces.  Adams, Janice, most of the team from the Manor investigation.  “What’s up?”
“Why is the Bārû herself here?” he said as he reached out to wipe dust off the corner of the nearest shelf.  He inspected the dust on his finger and wiped it on his sleeve with a shrug.
“Oh, right,” Harry blurted.  “I just wanted to give you this.”  He thrust the bag out awkwardly.  Eyeing it suspiciously, Malfoy accepted it, weighing it in his hands.  Realization bloomed slowly across his face.
Its beak and talons in front were coated in blood, like it had gotten several good licks in.  Further up the front legs rose blisters in various stages of healing.  Shackles, then.
By D.L. Malfoy
Sharp lines cast by the long metal table reached toward him like skeletal fingers, but nothing moved.  His eyes scanned the floor, starting at the doorway, carefully crossing and re-crossing the room.
——————————————
Draco, so far, is different. He wields his mouth, tongue, and lips like weapons. He handles Harry’s body in a way that makes him feel like he’s done something wrong, and is getting everything right. Harry’s last thought before he falls asleep is that stealing Theo’s fire brigade suit might not be a ridiculous idea.
Shacklebolt continued.  “Our only item left to address is a report from the Department of Magical Transportation-“
“Ron!” she yelled, fairly sure it was him.  He didn’t respond to her, but took the face covering off to reveal a neat auburn beard.
“I love you, Harry,” Draco murmured softly, letting his hands wander up Harry’s thighs on either side of him.
The man in front of her disappeared, and she pinned Draco with her gaze.
“You can’t guess, Auror Potter?” he said with a tired half-smirk.
Harry nodded and tried to not focus on the other man’s trousers pulled tight across his groin.  “The plan this week involves funneling a massive
Harry took a deep breath, daring the pufferfish, hopefully for the last time.
“Fifty points to Gryffindor!” she shouted into the mattress.  Lifting her head to draw a deep breath, she dissolved into giggles, ending with an indelicate snort.  “Am I what?”
“Mum,” he croaked.  “Did you know?”
Draco’s chest froze, and panic fought its way up his throat. “Oh.”
And… it hadn’t happened at the hands of his fellow Aurors.
She growled softly and blew a raspberry in the crease of his groin. He squirmed and nudged her away as his gaze drifted up to Harry in the doorway. Green eyes watched the scene eagerly, but his posture was stiff, hesitant.
,” he said, addressing his companion as they walked down the stairs together, “I believe I shall retire.  Quite a day.”
His thumb made a pass over the tip with every stroke, and tension pooled too quickly in Harry’s hips.  “Fuck… fuck… fuck…” he chanted with every pass.
Ron’s voice startled his attention away from the growing weight in his pelvis with each small movement.  “Hey, ‘Mione, you’ve got about a minute till he’s done.”
Draco inspects the jagged end of the wand, sniffs it with an appreciative hum, and hands it over. Harry scans him as he accepts the wand. He looks tired; faint rings under his eyes that aren’t bruises or smeared eyeliner, a bit of a slump to his shoulders, and a lethargy to his movements.
He sighed, held his breath to feel his heart rate speed, and exhaled for the slow, thudding beats that followed. Four days without a single ward run. A week without a flight. Without his Auror in attendance, he’d have gladly run in the rain, but Aurors were susceptible to fogged glasses and general irritability.
receipt.
Draco’s tone is gentle as he whispers, “Magic or rubbers?”
“Oh.  Right,” he muttered sheepishly.  “Wait.  You still love him?”
“Malfoy.”
“Can’t say I’m not hurt.  Not surprised.  Not unsympathetic.”  He shook his head softly.  “But I have no intention of being your whipping boy who puts out on the side.”  He swirled his tea, thinking.  “Frankly, I’ve had it too good to be treated that poorly again.”
********************************
“Like a belly full of shepherd’s pie, it is.  Watchin’ these old family gits come in cryin’ and sellin’ their grandmum’s robes.  Hits the spot, ya know?  After what they did?”
“Your penetrating wit fails to compensate,” Malfoy fired back.  “What do you have for me?”
If she’d have sent it with a jaunty invitation to dinner instead, would he have been in this state all day? No, probably not. In fact, he probably would have been flattered and more than a little impressed.
“Yeah, this is Potter.”
Ron froze mid-swallow, inhaling the ice water.  “She said what?” he coughed.
“Again,” Draco whispered, sniffing back looming tears.
“I… just… don’t fucking hex me, Granger,” he pleaded.  “And don’t leave because of it?”
“Okay, then,” he mumbled, “Let me know if-
Draco nods to a young woman putting supplies away, and she abandons crinkly packets of needles to wave back to him. “Draco!”
His cadence picked up, every stroke hitting nerves deep inside her, lighting fireworks behind her eyelids.  Sweet pressure was building in her again, and her moans increased in pitch.  He felt her tightening and knew she was close again already.
Falk chewed his gum slowly.  “He’s upset.”
“Truro Public,” he said, and held on to the magazine while green flames hurtled him through the network.  With an off-kilter spin, the Truro public Floo dumped him out unceremoniously in a narrow alley that reeked of piss.
“That’s why Cal said he took you for dead,” Harry muttered, followed by his own soft gasp at the weight of his words.  “And why he said he thought Falk would give up.”
He got that far-away look again, and Harry wanted to hug him till he broke down and cried, then put him back together.  “No,
“Tap on the wards,” the invitation said.  She’d guessed where the wards were based on the little map he’d drawn.  They seemed to take up the entire area on the north side of the dirt road.
“Okay, thanks.  Janice.”
Ron, you're kind of drug dealer!
“...Draco,” the man whispered, not looking back at him. “I knew you weren’t… I knew you weren’t doing great, but…”
Relief and anxiety twisted through him in alternative waves as Magnus started toward the stairs at a run.
Ron was incredulous.  “You just kill people’s owls?!”
“Mm?”  Harry looked up, tongue curling into his mouth with a dab of chocolate on the tip.
Did she forget something horrible he’d done, and she felt he’d taken advantage of that?  What could he have done that was worthy of this wrath, but was forgettable to her?
, followed by the notification from the Ministry ward,
Harry buried his nose in his arm and sighed. He shifted his hips to release his hand, and a hot line ran over his knuckles.
“Please,” she panted.
But, no.  Not yet.
someday.”
“Spring.”
He’s wearing brass knuckles made of gold and heartstrings that I armed him with.  They’re not for punching, though.  They’re for tenderizing.  For softening flesh and making it malleable.  Suggestible.
Up to your fucking eyeballs
He looked up from swirling the bottom of a drink when a gruff voice addressed him.
It stung a little.  Maybe more than a little, he thought.  It felt like she was trying to pick a fight to keep him at a distance.
Her breath caught at his words.  They’d never talked about it, but they’d both seen it in each other's memories.  Endless hours spent alone.  In libraries.  In a cell.  In rooms of faceless classmates.  At formal parties.  In dormitories.  On cliffs over the sea.
A choking groan hitched from Harry as his hips bucked.  His body throbbed against Draco’s thumb, and he held Harry’s cock tight while he came.
Scraping the last of the crumbs from his plate, he noticed the cake plate drifting back toward him.  It rotated mid-air to offer him a second slice, but he shook his head in declination.  There was such a thing as too much ganache.
Harry inelegantly choked on his own saliva at the imagined sensation of Draco’s hot, wet tongue laving around and inside him.  His nipples tightened and cock twitched at the thought.  Draco smirked at his reaction.
“I don’t think I can.  This looks terrible.” Ron chuckled.
His hands loosened their grip, and she slid hers around to his hips, steadying herself.  With a long, last final suck, she pulled back, licking a single drop off the tip of him.
“Uhm…” Draco hesitated.  “Hall of Prophecy.”
“No harm in asking,” Harry said, punctuated by a thick gulp.
“Hmmm,” he hummed, lips pressed firmly against her.  She bucked and groaned at the sensation, and he grinned.  “I think it would serve you right, you know…”
It just sat there, this Griffin.  Well, not sat.  Lay.  Lay exactly where Ron had levitated it to against the wall.  Its wings twitched every so often, and its eye watched him, but it hadn’t moved other than that.
********************************
Apparently, finding an Auror that didn’t want to execute Malfoy on sight had been a serious issue.
Halfway to the ladder he paused to throw his sweatshirt and pajama bottoms over a chair.  A pair of white lace knickers followed, and Harry’s breath hissed in at the sight.  Draco descended the ladder, and Harry turned to survey the phallic table arrangement.
Ron grit his teeth like he was amputating a finger and made a shallow scrape between his fingers, grimacing as though Death was dragging him bodily through a field of shrapnel.
Published and distributed by
Ron shrugged.  “Beats me.  All it does is makes the stars come out in broad daylight.  Named it AstraNox.”
“Oh?” he inquired, rather interested.  “Why would that be?”
Carpet fibres dig into his knees, and he hopes they leave an imprint. A chosen mark in his skin.
Malfoy chuckled, amused.  The high and mighty Weasleys.  “Crones and their smut.  By Penny Royal?”
want that side of Harry Potter, Head Auror.  The broken, needy, wanting side of him that wasn’t satisfied with banal one-night stands.  The side of him that wanted to own and be owned in return.  The side of him that he’d perhaps never shown Ron or Hermione.  The side of him he was likely ashamed to admit existed.
Draco blinks once. Twice. Then a third time, before his lips spread into a self-satisfied grin. “Your affairs. I am here to get them in order.”
Draco took another sip to hide his wide eyes and let Harry’s question hang in the air.  He couldn’t think of a time or place he
Studying her, he murmured, “The Sorting Hat was kind of racist.  And definitely crooked.”
I’d breed a Quidditch team’s worth of tow-headed and raven-haired little miscreants, at least.  As fast as I could.  A new one every May, so their birthdays could be the first outdoor party of the year.
Ron shrugged, more than happy to be in charge of beer procurement.  Malfoy swiftly dealt with the celery, producing a pile of uniform little arches.  Watching the man handle a knife was oddly entrancing, Ron thought to himself.
“Ah, bollocks,” grumbled Ron, handing Hermione her shirt and skirt.  The knickers were soaked, and she shoved them under the couch.  A handful of napkins from the takeaway order sufficed for cleaning herself off.  Her skirt was long enough that she wasn’t terribly worried about going naked under it.
Draco’s hips lock, flush against Harry’s arse, and he comes in short thrusts and sharp sobs.
With a pop, he Apparated the miles to the road in front of Malfoy’s wards and placed a studiously polite knock on them.  His mum would approve of his manners, he thought.
——————————
Pinpricks of errant magic race down Harry’s arms. He cracks an eye open, and a golden dust sifts from Draco’s skin.
Fuck this room, and fuck your face.
He arranged and re-arranged the pieces for a while and pondered the fate of the missing prisoners.  Perhaps they'd been sentenced to life as Squibs.  Most of them would beg for death or quickly find it after being released.
His fingers threaded through Harry’s hair.  “It hurts to give children what you were never given, and that you had to grow for yourself.  But it gets easier, and you won’t be doing it alone.”  His lips found Harry’s, and laid a soft kiss.  “And you
Harry cleared his throat and let Draco rest an arm on his chest.  “You were right,” Harry murmured, bringing Draco’s fingers to his lips.  “They like me.  And I like them.”
Grey, in and of itself, was not a bad color.  But a grey sea that never surged, and a grey sky that never roiled could drive a man mad with unfulfilled anticipation.
Harry shrugged and stuffed the cords in a rucksack.  “I was already going to take the position.  I just figured I’d keep it in my back pocket in case it was useful.”  He shouldered the bag and hefted it onto the kitchen counter.  “That’s why I went ahead and put furniture in the office last week.”
“Ah, hello,” the man says, eyes only on Harry.
He grabbed one of the larger shreds of paper, briefly mourning the fate of the bouquet he’d tediously tapped out.  Flipping the scrap over, he scrawled:
,” Hermione hissed.  “I have a presentation in an hour.”
He was only half-listening to her lingerie perversions, distracted by the soft whisper of draped fabric randomly tracing his back and side.  What the fuck were they doing on his hearth?
“Impossible,” Lucius scoffed.  “Even you couldn’t fail that completely.”

Worry prickled up her neck.  Maybe her concern about the caffeine was warranted.
He’d been avoiding broaching the topic since Potter’s announcement yesterday.  Yes, Harry Potter was moderately desperate to get in Draco Malfoy’s pants, he reminded himself.  But was he enough of an imbecile to indenture himself to DMLE service to hasten the removal of said pants?  Was he so impatient that he’d wear a badge for
“Yeah, I’ve gone through a bunch of different-“
Harry gasped and rocked his hips back onto Draco’s hand, pulling his length from her lips.  She watched as Draco turned his hand and dug his thumb behind Harry’s sac.  Harry made a low keening sound she’d never heard, and she slid her hips against Draco eagerly.
“So the owls will stop hitting your wards,” he paused as he stretched, “and stop getting eaten by eagles.”
“I slept like shit last night,” he mumbled into the soft sweatshirt.  “Want to go not talk about it in bed?”
“In the room off the kitchen…” Harry trailed off, watching him expectantly.
“You stopped?” Draco asked.
*********************************
He only gets a glimpse before tears blur his vision, but it’s plenty. His scars are thick, ink-black lines that nearly blur into each other. A black ribcage penned into his flesh. The scars Draco had decorated with iridescent glitter now eat all the light that dares hit them; a soul-sucking darkness.
Draco’s forehead rolled back and forth against the glass. The rain would never end. It never did. Well, it did. But not till April.
“Oh, Merlin…” Harry cursed, sucking his bottom lip in.
The sodden wad of paper towels in Harry’s fist drips over the sink as he opens and shuts cabinet doors in search of the bin. He gives up, throws them in the sink, and opens a top cupboard to begin searching for plates. The top cabinet next to the refrigerator contains nothing but a white plastic rubbish bin. He shakes his head and drags it out to set it on the floor, then tosses the paper towels in it.

be one of them.  Or Malfoy was just mad at him.
or Discord as Vukovich.
in case Malfoy sat on his glasses, Harry thought, smiling.  That’s one he’d used uncountable times.
“Close your mouth,” Malfoy mumbles. “You’ll draw flies. And zip your fly or you’ll draw mouths.” He huffs a laugh that turns into a coughing jag that ends with him on his side hugging his ribs.
“Yup. Two trips, maybe three.” His shirt had somehow found its way under the bed, and he shook it out before putting it on. Seemed like a good place for spiders to lurk.
Harry didn’t need to know Draco had spent the following week terror-vomiting while waiting for the rest of their blood test results.  He didn’t need to know about the months of sobbing apologies he’d heaped upon an eminently forgiving Magnus.
