had he been thinking? Losing his cool like that and almost doing something stupid and completely unwarranted. Merlin, he hadn’t even been in Potter’s company for more than a few days and apart from no longer hating him, his feelings for him were borderline indifferent.
“You can’t blame yourself for this,” Blaise told him firmly. “So Potter isn’t in love with his girlfriend anymore? These things happen.”
“Thanks, Mum.” Ginny was already piling food onto her plate and she gestured at Draco to do the same. “I’ll bring the tray in when we’re done.”
“No,” Draco gasped, and shook his head vigorously. “Just here to play Quidditch and then leave. Eat some of Molly’s cooking too. She’ll never forgive me otherwise,” he said in a rush. The older man let out a deep chuckle.
, Potter needs– I don’t–” Draco choked and clutched at his throat. He couldn’t seem to formulate proper sentences.
Eventually they seemed to have calmed down and his mother pulled away, dabbing at her eyes with her embroidered handkerchief. Aunt Andromeda turned to him now and he suddenly felt shy, though Merlin knew why.
“Al calm down, Draco wasn’t really going to do that.” Potter said comfortingly from his place on the ground, shooting Draco a glare.
“No, she did not tell me!” Draco wondered what else his mother was keeping from him. Suddenly he felt much more worried about just how much she actually knew about what had happened between him and Harry. His mother had known something was up when he’d rushed home after their confrontation, but for once she hadn’t pried. She hadn’t asked about Harry afterwards though so he’d known that she had an idea about what was troubling him. Having an idea was one thing, but if Harry had told Ginevra about what had happened, she might have told Mama Weasley and if she knew, it was almost assured that his own mother knew too.
“So do you accept my proposition?” Potter looked at him imploringly and the full force of his stupidly green eyes hit Draco hard.
Draco made a sound of distress and broke the kiss, stumbling back in shock. He brought a hand up to cover his mouth but Potter was having none of that, crowding him back against the counter and swiftly pulling his hand away. He gently took Draco’s face into his hands and gazed at him like he was something precious, and when he brought his mouth to Draco’s again in a dizzying slide of lips, Draco’s eyes slid closed in surrender.
Weasley shrugged. “Like I said, it’s not my business. Harry’s old enough to make his own decisions and sort out his own messes. Or at least, that’s what ‘Mione says.”
Granger nodded. “With Draco here, we can have two Chasers for once if I play too. And I’m sure you all don’t want Percy to play again.”
His mother didn’t try to bring up their conversation in the library again, but whenever Draco told her he was going out with Potter, she’d get this look in her eyes. The look was a strange mixture of pity and hope and it grated on Draco’s nerves. He didn’t need her to look at him that way. He didn’t want her pity or the looks that she and his aunt exchanged more and more these days. Most of all though, he didn’t want these feeling that Potter had invoked in him. Draco was no innocent lamb when it came to the physical aspects of attraction. He’d shagged his fair share of men in his lifetime, some he’d even considered worthy of a long term relationship. Yet it had never worked out. No matter how much he’d enjoyed a man’s company both outside and inside the bedroom, it had never lasted more than a few months. But now, Potter made him crave something that was as far out of his reach as the moon.
They hear a feminine squawk of outrage and a slammed door, and laugh as they watch Harpy-lady vigorously close her curtains.
“I assure you my mother taught me many things, some of which are the only reason you still remain standing with all your body parts intact,” Draco spat back at him, his fisted hands itching to plant themselves in Thin Lips’ grinning face.
Potter’s mouth hardened. “Yeah, we heard about that. Clifton’s a right bastard to everyone though, so don’t take it too personally. He oversees most of our hand-to-hand combat classes and if he ever actually took to the mat, he’d probably get a good beating from all the trainees – myself included.”
When the dishes are done and the popcorn is ready, Harry finally joins Draco on the couch, placing the popcorn on his lap.
Draco leant forward and covered his face, not knowing if he should laugh or cry – and then settled on shrieking when Potter’s hand somehow ended up on his arse and gave it a hearty squeeze.
Mirage-Pansy rolled her eyes in a wonderful imitation of the real one. “Get up, idiot. We’re real, unfortunately for you.”
A loud hoot sounded through the room and Draco turned just in time to see a small blur of fluff diving straight for his head. He ducked on instinct alone and managed to avoid it just in time, although his mother wasn’t as lucky. The owl slammed quite solidly into her chest and she gave a startled gasp as it literally bounced off her and landed on the pile of letters.
“So, you think this’ll make front page news?” Potter asked once he’d finished devouring his cone. Draco wasn’t even halfway done with his own vanilla and raspberry sauce sundae.
Harry nudged him lightly and he turned to find his husband smiling back at him with a soft look to match his own. “Come on, you have somewhere to be, remember. You can gaze at it all you want when we get back.” He used their still joined hands to pull Draco to the Floo.
Draco also opened his mouth to argue but between the two of them, his aunt and mother shooed them out like a pair of unruly schoolboys. If the barely concealed smirk on his mother’s face was anything to go by, it had all been planned.
“Are you really sure these burst?” Draco frowned as he rubbed the balloon harder. “They feel quite thick.”
“Again with all that rubbish,” Thin Lips scoffed, his almost non-existent mouth threatening to disappear completely as he scrunched it up. Draco shivered as the lout regarded him contemplatively from head to toe, and the leer that came onto his face afterwards certainly didn’t help matters.
Ignoring him as best he could, Draco exhaled slowly and felt the balloon inflate a little before it got stuck at a certain point. Frowning, he blew a bit harder, but the obstinate balloon still wouldn’t budge.
“It wasn’t foolish of you to go to Andromeda,” she replied calmly. “She is a retired Mediwitch so it is perfectly understandable that you chose to go to her for aid. In fact, had you messaged St Mungo’s, we’re not even sure if they would have taken your call.”
Draco paused for a moment, swallowing around the lump that had formed in his throat. “I didn’t want to do anything to mess up, and then I find out that there was nothing to mess up in the first place. And I should have been happy, right? Instead, the realisation that there was nothing to stop us being together terrified the shite out of me.”
“I’ll take Lily, you take Al.” Potter said, stepping up behind Lily. “After that we’ll take them to join James at the seesaw.”
The kiss that followed had Draco arching his back just to withstand the force of it. He scrambled for purchase before finally clutching onto Potter’s broad shoulders, his head hitting the cabinet above them with a dull thud, although he hardly felt the pain. Potter’s mouth was suddenly everywhere; travelling the expanse of Draco’s face and neck, a trail of saliva and stinging flesh marking his path. Even in his dazed state, Draco had enough presence of mind to know that his neck would be sporting some spectacular love bites afterwards.
“Come, Draco.” His mother grasped his arm and gently pulled him out of the room. He expected her to lead him to the Floo to go after the others but instead, she took him to the kitchen where she made him drink a cool glass of water with a few drops of sherry in it.
“I always thought it must be kind of nice to share it with a friend like that,” she continued. “Wouldn’t you like that too?”
. One moment he had the upper hand, and in the next, he was flat on his back with Potter’s hands firmly pressing his wrists down on either side of his head.
“Exactly!” Draco pounced on what Potter had said. “Have you met his wife? No? Well, I ran into her at Flourish and Blotts the other day and ended up helping her find a book about Divination. From our brief interaction I found her to be rather lacking in intelligence, which explains why she’d marry Smith of all people, but making up for it by the fact that she is rather stunningly beautiful. The point to note here though, is that she is almost as blonde as me.”
Draco turned to all of them, still smirking. “We’re truly grateful for all the trouble you went through, but now I ask that you all kindly leave.” He sent Potter a wicked look. “Potter and I still have some things to discuss in private.”
a boyfriend willing to move in with him a mere five months after they’d started dating. His friends had warned him that he was moving too fast and was bound to be hurt, and he’d been the only one not surprised when Draco had said yes before he’d even finished the question.
“More like he lived abroad for most of his life,” Potter replied. “Didn’t you catch a bit of an Australian undertone to his accent?”
“Bill!” Percy exclaimed, thus confirming Draco’s fears. “Come to say hello to young Malfoy over here?”
“Weasley, please take Draco and go,” Pansy interjected with an impatient huff of breath. “They’ll be at it all day otherwise.”
“Hard to get that out was it, Potter?” Draco quipped with a smirk. “Well it’s not really a shock that she likes me so much. After all, I
look kind of sick. I’m sorry I was late,” he said. “The girl at the shop took forever to get our drinks.”
him? He closed his eyes tightly, the very thought of it almost too much to bear. He really would be lost afterwards.
Draco bit back a scream. Just what he needed – a lecture from Granger’s three year old daughter. As if the adult wasn’t bad enough, he had to now contend with a miniature version too.
“Of course I’m sure,” Harry replies, taking off the white t-shirt he’d chosen for this occasion. He hands it to Dean who sets it down next to his brushes.
When Draco finally pulls back with an audible smack, his pupils are blown and he is panting slightly. “My hero,” he breathes huskily, leaning in to nose at Harry’s neck. As he proceeds to move lower, unbuttoning along the way, Harry decides that this is one trick he’s willing to forgive.
“Cissy, keep stirring. We don’t want the mixture to clump.” Aunt Dromeda called from where she was rolling out dough. Teddy was standing beside her, using a template to cut the rolled dough into shapes.
“Kreacher could have brought some up for us too,” Weasley grumbled, flopping down on his back. “He saw us come in. S’not fair.”
Draco’s heart sank at the innocent question, delivered with simple curiosity but also intrusive enough to have him feeling helplessly cornered. He struggled to stem down the swell of anxiety that had bubbled up inside him and Charlie’s smile began to dim as his question remained unanswered.
Draco huffed but didn’t say anything else, following in silence when Potter led him into a darkened hall with an enormous screen at the front.
“I’ve finally gone round the bend, it seems,” he said aloud, feeling pretty serene considering his insanity. “Janus Thickey ward, here I come.”
“But,” he continued, an idea coming to mind, “If you still want me to feel better, perhaps you could listen to what I have to say?” He felt pretty good considering he was trying to manipulate children – some of which were still in nappies.
“That’s good. I was considering wearing the turnip ones, but I thought the purple would not go with my dress. Rolf picked it out for me.” she added, her face taking on the slightest of blushes.
“You can’t do that!” Draco protested loudly, shocked at the loathing in Potter’s voice. “That tapestry dates back to the 13
“Please, don’t fight,” Draco moaned, opening his eyes to look at them beseechingly. He didn’t need a pair of bickering lovers added to the shitestorm that was his life.
Harry wishes he has enough breath to shout something back at Draco, but as it is, all he can do is send a sort of panted growl his way. Draco is strolling in front of him, completely at ease while Harry’s painfully lugging a cart filled to the brim with pumpkins. His arm feels like it’s about to be ripped out of its socket and he’s sure that any minute now, the cart will pull him back and he’ll die rolling down a hill, surrounded by pumpkins. What a way to go indeed.
“Dad’s here!” James whooped and ran to his father at once. “We thought you were busy with Aunt ‘Mione.”
Draco spun around so fast his towel came loose and he was just able to grab it before his bits were revealed. Luna smiled complacently from her place by the door, holding up what looked like a pair of jeans and shirt.
Draco lets out a watery laugh. “Yes, you are. But I’m the one who started it so I guess it’s really my fault.”
in fact finished with – and clutch at his right arm, his face rapidly losing colour. Horrible black streaks appeared on his hand and they pulsated ominously, spreading a few centimetres up his arm each time. Potter’s face was scrunched up and sweating profusely, and a thin line of blood dripped down his chin as he bit through his bottom lip, unsuccessfully trying to hold back his cries of pain.
Narcissa picked the owl up and it sat quite contentedly in her cupped palms. “Why ever would you want to do that? He’s simply precious.”
Although Draco was loathe to admit it, he actually thought it was quite sweet that Ginny was being so earnest about it all.
Mrs Weasley nodded. “I shall get Arthur to arrange an appointment with Kingsley for the two of us. You can report this incompetent Auror as well.”
“Hey, you have to admit that was funny.” Potter raised his hands in surrender, palms facing upwards. “Although, Bob
“Draco.” she said, reaching for his face with a tender hand. She stroked his cheek and then turned to her sister. “Oh Cissy, he’s lovely.” she said and then took him into her arms as well.
He turned to the children who were quiet for once as they regarded him. “Has anyone told you that you lot are terrors? Menaces. The stuff of nightmares!”
The balloon finally came to a stop when it hit the Black family tapestry and fell to the ground. Silence descended on them, Potter surprisingly quiet with not so much as a teasing remark made as he stood up and retrieved the wayward balloon. Handing it back to Draco, he resumed his seat and sent a dark scowl at the tapestry.
“Yeah well anyone would have run like that if they had a demon dog after them.” Potter said dryly. “By the way, thanks for doing absolutely nothing at the time. It was greatly appreciated.”
“I’ll just have to best her in Halloween décor,” Draco declares after a few more minutes of pouting. “Start cleaning, Harry. I want to start carving as soon as possible.”
taste, and Draco would have to rinse his mouth out thoroughly when he was done. He didn’t know how Potter could stand the unusual flavour without so much as a grimace.
Progress increased rapidly afterwards and the biggest surprise was probably the fact that he and Potter got on quite well when not actively hating each other. Potter turned out to be warm and unexpectedly witty, with a wicked side that Draco hadn’t expected at all. He could make Draco laugh, which was no easy feat, and could take a joke at his expense with good grace and patience that he certainly hadn’t exhibited when they were children.
“No Lily.” Draco admonished sternly, trying to lean his head away from the little girls’ grabbing hands. “You can touch, but no pulling.”
“Whatever are you doing skulking around in the dark, Potter?” It was kind of eerie not being able to see Potter’s expression. Only his glasses were visible, glinting in a faintly menacing manner.
ago but he hadn’t dared approach Gallivander about it, and now here he was making an utter fool of himself. He began to shake the wand vigorously, barely resisting the urge to snap the bloody thing in two.
“Thank you, Mrs Weasley,” Narcissa said quietly, and Draco had to look away, his chest constricting. Things weren’t supposed to be like this; that a small act of kindness
“Hmm, I think my house elf might like you better than me,” Potter observed, accepting the plate of biscuits Draco handed to him.
got a new shipment of those but they’re in the back right now. If you’ll just wait here, Mr Potter, I’ll be back as soon as I can.” He practically skipped out the door to the back.
Draco watched as Charlie easily lifted Ginny’s prone figure, hardly jostling her at all. She mumbled something to herself but otherwise didn’t stir.
Ginny looked out at where the sun was already starting to set. “Shall we call it a draw and stop for the day? It’ll be dark soon and I need to service my broomstick before I put it away.”
“That’s the name of my parents’ house.” Ginevra explained helpfully. “They get lonely now that we’ve all moved out so we try to have these family functions whenever we can. Mum just likes the opportunity to cook for a large crowd again.”
“Yeah Malfoy, you did promise to spend some time with them and you aren’t busy right now.” he said, his lips twisting into a rather vicious smile. “You should come with us for sure. It’ll be loads of fun.”
He took Harry’s hand and led him to the Floo. They passed the Black tapestry that still hung in its place on the wall and he gave it a fond smile as his eyes sought out his name, proudly connected to the one which lay branching out from
“I’m fine, Potter. I may have inhaled an unhealthy amount of dust though,” he added with a forced laugh.
Al grinned from his perch atop his father’s shoulders. The Potter children seemed to like that particular vantage point. “I want ice cream.” he stated with a sweet smile.
“Wonderful party, Draco,” Granger told him with an approving nod and smile. “You’ve handled everything beautifully.”
Harry was trembling now, in anger or hurt Draco had no idea. Regardless, he recklessly plodded on, taking on a jeering tone. He was starting to feel giddy now. “What’s the matter Potty? You don’t look too well.”
Draco ducked his head, fists clenching again. He didn’t know what to say but at the moment all he wanted was to see how Potter was doing because no, he did not feel better now. In fact, his calmed nerves were making him feel even more terrible; ashamed and embarrassed.
“Careful.” Potter was next to him in an instance, a warm hand on his back. “It seems to get worse day by day. Wasn’t like this before, but Hermione thinks that since I officially live here now, it’s acting up to get me to leave.”
“No it wasn’t.” Pansy glared but it quickly subsided and she sighed. “But I suppose you were somewhat justified in thinking that way.”
“Your clothes are fine, Draco,” Granger assured him as she took a seat in one of his armchairs. Weasley moved to examine the pictures on his mantle, snickering at the one that showed a cake-covered six-year-old Draco grinning at the camera with an equally messy Blaise and Pansy beside him.
Potter opened his mouth to say something but Draco silenced him with a raised hand. He wasn’t finished just yet.
Harry turned away without another word, but Draco caught a glimpse of a face filled with as much anguish as he felt. He watched as the other wizard strode away, disappearing out of sight without ever looking back. Draco blinked frantically, his eyes starting to smart.
The shout brought him out of his stupor and he quickly moved to duck into a nearby alley. Peering out, he looked around as he tried to mentally retrace his steps. They’d been on their way to Flourish and Blotts when he’d had that spell shot at him and then the schoolboy had come along. Come to think of it, Draco thought with a frown, the last time he remembered seeing her had been just as they’d left the Apothecary.
The elf bowed low and warbled, “Kreacher would like to bring Master Draco some biscuits but he is not knowing what flavour Master prefers.”
Draco settled back in his own armchair, realizing that Potter was serious. “I suppose I should start at the beginning.”
“Who knew you had such a dangerous childhood,” Weasley said with the first friendly grin he’d ever directed Draco’s way. “And I thought mine was bad with the twins as brothers.”
Potter instantly looked apologetic. “I’m sorry, you’re right. I’m acting like a randy teenager.” He stepped forward and took Draco’s hands. “I should take you out to dinner first, at a swanky restaurant. Anywhere you want. We could – ”
Only recently had his mother begun to show an independence that hadn’t been there when Lucius was around. Draco thought it partly had to do with her re-acquaintance with her sister, but mostly it was just because she was finally free to make her own decisions for once. Same as he was.
“Oh, no, snake boy, you are not chalking this down to ‘I am a Slytherin and that’s what we do’. You’re coming for the Quidditch game tomorrow and if you keep fussing, I promise you I’ll set Mum on you faster than you can say ‘hair gel’.”
Draco felt his heart practically lodge itself in his throat. Before he could gather his thoughts, he was already pelting through the crowd in the direction of the shout. He faintly registered footsteps following behind him, but any attempts to process this flew out the window when he came upon the small crowd gathered around his mother, who was defiantly staring back at a pair of leering wizards.
“Salazar, Potter, give a bloke some warning next time.” Draco reached out to steady the other wizard. “Here, why don’t you just lie down? The floor’s clean and you can lean against one of the armchairs if you want.”
“Oh yes, we’re quite alright, thank you.” She inclined her head graciously and offered a polite smile. “Your assistance was greatly appreciated. I’d hoped to deal with the situation without bringing Draco into it, and I found myself at a loss when that despicable cretin turned his attention onto him.”
a snob! Who even says things like ‘blasphemous’? I don’t think Ron even knows what that word means!”
Draco trudged off to bed, his feet dragging behind him. He hadn’t been lying when he’d said he was exhausted and it was with a sigh of relief did he finally slip between the covers of his enormous bed. He was already more than halfway towards deep slumber when an image of Potter popped into his head, the look he’d had when Draco had tried to comfort him. With that picture in mind, Draco drifted off to sleep but not before realizing that what he felt for Potter now was definitely more than attraction.
Harry knows it’s childish but he still grabs a handful of grass and rubs it deliberately into a squawking Draco’s hair, making sure to get as much dirt in there as he can before he’s shoved off. Draco looks furious now but he must be really pleased with his trick because he doesn’t say anything as he casts a Cleaning Charm on himself. Harry walks over to where the garden snake is and this time when he picks it up he sees that it is actually a very realistic toy that Draco had probably spelled into animation.
After that Draco was able to keep the children entertained with innocent stories of his childhood and lower years at Hogwarts. They always listened in respectful silence, save for the occasional question and seemed to drink everything in. His storytelling was punctuated by his smoke figures and after the initial hippogriff story he kept his characters remaining in the room so that it was filled with all sorts of creatures ambling about.
The door opened just as the last of the biscuits had been eaten and Weasley came in with Granger. When he caught sight of the empty plates, he looked dismayed.
“You’re becoming one of us normal folk!” Draco exclaimed in a mock shocked voice. “Be still my heart, Harry Potter admitting that he enjoys a nonlife-threatening life. Wonders will never cease it seems.”
“I’m fine.” he said, pleased when his voice didn’t shake. Potter let go of him and Draco thankfully stepped away before turning around.
“Yeah,” the other man chimed in, his nasally tone grating on Draco’s already frayed nerves. “Let off with nothing more than six months house arrest with no magic. Sounds awfully suspicious to me.” He addressed this to the crowd and many gave murmurs of agreement. Draco’s hands curled into fists.
Charlie blinked in surprise. “So what, you’re just staying at home doing nothing? Not looking for work or
“Running away, are we?” the boy jeered after him, having apparently regained his bravado. “Can’t really expect anything more from cowardly scum like you.”
Draco felt a twinge of regret at that, although he’d never entertained the idea of Potter as a Slytherin. He sometimes wondered what it might have been like to be his friend, but he’d never
were my best friends. I suppose you could say that they were what Hermione and Weasley are to Ha–Potter. The day after my trials, I received two letters from them. Pansy’s was smudged and soaked in tears. She said that her father had threatened to disown her if she continued her association with me. It was bad enough that she’d tried to give Potter up to the Dark Lord and he didn’t want anything else soiling the family name. He always was a cantankerous old bastard. She couldn’t do anything but obey him. If she was cut off, she’d be penniless and homeless and knowing Parkinson Sr., he’d make sure that no self-respecting wizarding family ever gave her the time of day. She’d lose everything.”
“Oh, so I’m not the only one in the dark?” Draco asked with mock-surprise. “And here I thought I was the last to hear about this little
Draco’s forehead furrowed as he realised that he didn’t like this hesitant, defensive Potter, and that he couldn’t just leave the situation as it was. Potter had made the effort to try and apologise for his behaviour on Monday, and now, Draco knew that it was his turn to be the better wizard.
Before Draco could dredge up a response, the door to the Leaky opened and a boy of around ten came out. He had a head of bushy hair that reminded Draco of Granger for a moment, but when the boy caught sight of Potter he gave an excited cry and his hair suddenly turned into an exact replica of Potter’s while his eyes turned green.
“It’s very nice to meet you Mr Potter.” Draco gave the boy a firm handshake. “I’m Draco Lucius Malfoy.”
‘Everything is fine!” he said in an overly cheerful voice. “Now you know I’m alright, you can get back to the children and Ginevra.”
” Draco cried, appalled and still struggling valiantly. “Salazar, how are you this strong?” His mother must have cast some sort of strengthening spell on herself for it only took one more pull for the covers to get away from him.
“Malfoy, how nice of you to join us today,” he gritted out in monotone, and Draco was surprised any words had come out at all, from the way he was clenching his teeth.
He shut his own eyes for a moment and then shrugged on the shirt without another thought. He reached for his pants but then turned back to Luna, still sitting placidly on his bed, her eyes trained on him.
Potter gave a wry smile. “I want Ginny in a good mood, so yeah. There’s er, something I want to speak with her about.”
“I, er, forgot you had a sixth brother,” he finally said, lamely, in his opinion, as he gestured at ‘Charlie’. Ginny, however, looked grateful for the change of subject. She hastily wiped at her eyes with a shaky laugh and Draco stiffened when she casually leant against him. Such nonchalant familiarity wasn’t something he expected coming from someone who wasn’t Pansy or Blaise, but then again, the Gryffindors had been a somewhat in-your-space lot.
owl, seeing as how he’d selected an empty cage, but then he caught sight of said cage and the words died in his throat because there
“Do take a seat,” Pansy continued, inviting them in as if it was her room and not Draco’s. “Would you like some tea? We can ring for it if you want.”
Draco has slumped against the side of the fireplace and the thump Harry had heard was probably him sliding down to the floor. His knees have been drawn up to his chest and the position makes him look
Of course, it also helped that he’d yet to meet any of the other Weasley men, but alas, it seemed that was going to change very soon. A week’s company seemed to be enough for Ginny to want to officially introduce Draco to the rest of the family, and she sprang that particular idea on him when they were sitting in the kitchen eating hot buttered scones.
Before Potter could say anything, Lily decided to make herself noticed by springing from her perch on Potter’s shoulders towards him. Luckily his days as a seeker had left him with quick reflexes and he instinctively dropped his bags and caught her, cradling her against his chest. The girl even had the audacity to smile angelically up at him while he was busy trying to get his heart to stop pumping like the Hogwarts Express.
They set off but after a few minutes Draco found the metamorphagus child walking beside him with a curious look on his face.
Draco suddenly looks angry. “What did you expect? I come home and suddenly it’s like I’m sixteen again and back in Myrtle’s bathroom, except it’s not me bleeding to death on the tiles, it’s you!”
“In retrospect, I suppose it was a little foolish of me,” Draco admitted with a shrug. “But remember, I was in a kiss-induced daze and wasn’t thinking straight.”
Draco took her arm and led her through the gate and up the short walk to the house. It was a quaint little thing, surrounded by a beautiful garden. The fence surrounding the property looked as if it were just for show but as they had passed the gate, Draco had felt a shiver of magic around him. Apparently there were wards and someone had included his and his mother’s magical signatures in them, allowing them to enter without difficulty.
, you can join us downstairs after you finish up with Rose’s hair. It’s looking lovely already and afterwards you must show me how you made these smoke figurines so solid.”
“Draco, glad to see you could make it!” Arthur came up and clapped him on the back good-naturedly, a broad smile tugging at his lips.
When Draco once more stuck his head through, he found Blaise groaning and nursing his head while Pansy smiled smugly.
be above using, and full-on seduction involving interesting choices of clothing. All in all, Harry manages a full day and is proud of it.
Potter stared at him in disbelief. “Oh don’t make that face, I was doing her a favour here. I even offered him the robes that I’d been thinking of getting Ginevra. That blue would have looked lovely on Mrs Smith.”
He didn’t say anything more and Draco tried to ignore the fact that the man he was harbouring a major crush on was lying with his face inches from his crotch. If that wasn’t the very definition of a frustrating situation, Draco didn’t know what was.
to be fine with what we were, er… doing.” Weasley snorted again. “But then he suddenly freaked and pushed me away and threw pies at me,” he ended with a slight pout. “My hair probably still smells like gravy and meat.”
Having ‘settled’ his owl, Draco found himself at a loss for things to do. Ginny was away somewhere with Granger so he couldn’t pop over for a visit, and as he spent the rest of the day wandering aimlessly about the Manor, he realised that her presence in his life really was a breath of fresh air. How he could have gone about his days before, he could hardly comprehend. If it wasn’t for the unexpected company of his owl, stubbornly following him around like a fluffy shadow, he’d have likely gone mad with boredom. His mother had found it ‘endearing’ while Draco had thought it a right pain in the arse at first, but he’d quickly grown to admire the surprising level of intelligence the creature possessed.
The days that followed passed in a blur of cleaning and sorting. Draco took Potter to task, firmly demanding that they work interminably each night until exhaustion forced them to stop. Potter had whined plaintively that he needed to get up early for Auror training, but Draco had been unrelenting. If they wanted to finish the job within this century, they needed to pick up the pace. There would be no more chatting in the sitting room until they were done.
Luna vacated the room and Draco found himself chuckling. It was a good thing Luna was going with him today or he didn’t know how he would have survived the day. He dragged on the jeans and found them to be tighter than he was accustomed to but still comfortable enough not to make any adjustments to.
“Why, what did you get him?” Draco asked curiously, intrigued by the mild blush that had come across the bridge of her freckled nose. Ginny gave an embarrassed laugh.
Draco swallowed. “I’m sorry… about Fred.” he blurted out and then he could have kicked himself for it. He had no idea why he’d just said that.
Aunt Andromeda led them into a warm sitting room where Potter and Teddy were playing with Quidditch figurines on the ground. Potter hurriedly sprang to his feet when he saw them, his face flushed with embarrassment but he covered it up by smoothly greeting his mother with a polite, “It’s wonderful to see you Mrs Malfoy.”
who suggested a break in the first place! So excuse me for wanting to know what’s gotten you into such a snit.”
should be off,” he said as politely as he could, throwing a handful of Floo powder into the hearth. “Goodnight, Potter, Weasley.”
“What are you all talking about?” Percy asked as he came up to them, and then stared in confusion as Ginny and Charlie hurriedly said “Nothing!” while the rest studiously looked anywhere but at him.
Draco shook his head. “The last owl I received from him was two weeks ago, but he was never a big letter writer to begin with so we shouldn’t worry. I assume he’s still working as a Muggle builder. He always did enjoy using his strength more than his mind.”
“I seem to do nothing but ramble when I’m around you,” Potter said with a twinkle in his eye. “Shall we sit and I can explain myself?”
“It’s not about power,” he insisted, looking offended now. “I just meant that I could have vouched for your character.”
“Harry, maybe you could take the cake down to Kreacher?” He placed the cake box in Potter’s hands without waiting for a reply and pushed him in the direction of the door. “He can keep it under a good Preservation Charm until it’s time for Teddy to cut it.”
“So, are you really planning on leaving Clifton like that?” Potter asked after a moment of contemplation.
Potter looked embarrassed. “I’m happy he got to meet you today. The Weasleys have practically adopted him but until now, Dromeda was the only one he could truly say was his family.”
When he emerged from the Floo, he dusted himself off thoroughly and patted down his hair. He could hear laughter from outside and stiffened, trepidation hitting him hard. Ginny placed a comforting hand on his arm.
Ginny appeared above him, freckles greatly pronounced against the sheet-white pallor of her face. Draco coughed and held up the Snitch in response, smiling weakly with dirt-covered teeth – he was valiantly ignoring the abominable taste in his mouth – and she gave a watery smile in return. “Yes, you reckless bastard.” Her hands closed around his hand holding the Snitch and gave it a squeeze. “You won us the game.”
“Pansy, I don’t think you understand,” Draco said desperately. “We’ll be playing a game of Quidditch. Quidditch involves Bludgers. It won’t seem the slightest suspicious if one was to ‘randomly’ smash my head in
“Give it up, Malfoy,” Weasley interrupted. “You should know by now that once Hermione’s set on doing something, it’ll happen. Save yourself some energy and just go with it.”
“Okay, now you’re just being intentionally rude.” Potter gave a long-suffering sigh and looked at Draco apologetically. “I really didn’t want to do this…”
Ginny could obviously recognize a peace offering when she saw one and she visibly relaxed. “I can wait outside until you’ve finished your call,” she offered politely, but Pansy stopped her.
Draco smiled fondly at the two of them, feeling a sense of déjà vu about the whole thing. To think, the last time they’d assaulted him like this, he’d wanted to shake them off and beat a quick getaway. He opened his mouth to ask them where their dad was when another voice spoke up.
Draco flushed. Just what he needed, his own bloody reflection giving him a pep talk as if he was a schoolgirl out on her first Hogsmeade date. He couldn’t even call this meeting with Potter a
“I froze. I literally could not move and suddenly he was right in front of me and then ducking under the umbrella to sit beside me. He ran a hand through his hair, pushing the wet locks back before giving me the most devilish smirk I’ve ever had the pleasure of seeing. He said that he hoped I’d been enjoying the view and obviously I started to flush like an idiot and splutter. I’m not usually very good with people I don’t know, and this man was a Muggle too. But somehow, I felt completely at ease with him and we actually had a nice conversation.”
If Potter had been stiff before, he was practically carved from stone now. “I assure you, I do not.” he grit out. “We were all at the Burrow and they snuck out the moment my back was turned. Why do I even need to explain myself to you?”
Said son ambled over, with evident reluctance, a stiff smile plastered across his face. His hair was neatly combed back and his clothes in impeccable condition, regardless of their simplicity. Draco almost found himself nodding in approval and he hastily pulled himself together. It wouldn’t do to find common ground with the pompous ex-prefect. Although, Draco noted with surprise, there was a sort of lightness in his countenance that you wouldn’t expect coming from someone who was supposed to have a permanent stick up his arse.
Working in the attic, which had started off as an enjoyable experience, quickly evolved into the very epitome of frustration. Their work consisted of repairing, restoring and sorting through the old items they came across, and it was so clustered that they oftentimes had to work in close proximity. Huddling together side by side for days on end had resulted in enough accidental brushes to almost drive Draco completely spare, and been a true exercise of self-restraint.
?” He casually placed his arms around Potter’s shoulders and any remaining distance between them disappeared as he pressed their chests flush against each other.
“Wanna be set up then, Malfoy?” George goaded. “Charlie’s hardly ever in the country, so I have no idea how he does it, but he seems to know practically every queer bachelor in the kingdom.”
pretty good at it after all. Now that the Dark magic was gone, the suffocating pressure was gone as well, and Draco could breathe easier now. He pulled his wand out and prepared to cast the counterspells to get into the room, but Potter stopped him.
“Hey, are you getting anything for Arthur too? I found this terrific Muggle shop that sells antiques. I bet we could find something for him there.”
fifty Cleaning Charms by now so it can’t be the rust anymore.” He picked it up and peered at it closely, his face mere inches away. “It
offer Andromeda the house, but she refused it. She says she was never very fond of it in the first place and much prefers her present residence.”
“I’m so glad you find all this amusing, Malfoy,” he drawled, voice virtually dripping with sarcasm, and Draco had to take a couple of deep breaths to compose himself, quite overcome.
“Good afternoon.” she said cheerily after giving the boy the initial push. He seemed capable of doing the rest himself. “Lovely day isn’t it?”
on him, the utter nerve. This would be the last time he bent to his mother’s will; he didn’t care how reproachfully she looked at him, he
Pansy and Blaise were watching him earnestly and the weight of their gaze felt heavy and uncomfortable. He knew they were only looking out for him but to his already frazzled mind, it felt more like they were pushing expectations on him that he just couldn’t meet. He hadn’t been lying when he’d said he was still a coward. He couldn’t just recklessly leap into the unknown the way they thought he could. He was afraid. He’d always been afraid.
“Oh, har har, very funny.” Draco shot her a quelling look. “Joke all you want but I’m sure you of all people know that if any of your brothers were home, I’d likely not leave here with all my body parts intact. Weasel especially would go for blood, no questions asked.”
He sounded completely sincere and it confused Draco so much. He couldn’t understand why Potter was pursuing him when it was so obvious that he still loved Ginny.
The rest of the Weasleys were milling about in the back garden and Draco could see that they’d already set up the Quidditch hoops a fair distance away from the house. Some of his trepidation melted away in place of anticipation. If he remembered correctly, he hadn’t played a proper game of Quidditch since fifth year.
“It gave one of the most terrifying shrieks I’d ever heard before. I’d been turning to smile at the rest of the class but quickly turned back when I heard it. And the hippogriff was
Draco did sit up, but not because he believed the mirage. “Ah, but that’s exactly what a hallucination would say,” he reasoned smugly.
“Bloody hell Mother, for all you knew I could have been naked under here!” Draco yelled, struggling to pull the sheets back.
His sharp tone must have jarred on Potter’s nerves and he crossed his arms stiffly, his whole bearing going into the offensive. “Really? Well, from the way you were mooning over her on the couch, I was pretty sure you didn’t know.”
“Oh, shut up, Granger,” Draco laughed. “As if I would wish that on the poor child. I made sure to only invite the people dear to my cousin’s little heart.”
“I know, my darling, but I am already proud of you. Even after all you’ve been through, you still survived with your mind and heart whole. You may feel lost now, but I have the utmost confidence that you will find your purpose soon, and when you do, you will handle it with brilliance.”
Mercury simply gave him an unimpressed stare and then proceeded to burrow deeper into Draco’s favourite pillow, no doubt getting all sorts of owl germs and fleas on it. Not to mention the damage his claws were doing to the silk cover.
known each other for years, but in Draco’s opinion, unconcealed contempt and brutal hostility didn’t really count as an acquaintance.
Suddenly it was too unbearable. Draco had been a fool to think that he could ever have that. Harry may have been attracted to him but once they’d scratched that itch, would he even want him anymore? Draco couldn’t replace Ginny Weasley. He couldn’t even try to fill her place in the children’s lives. What did Harry want him around for when he had her? She was obviously a wonderful mother, attentive, loving, playful. Watching them as he was, he felt like a complete outsider. He had no place here. He had no right to even be witnessing this little tableau. He felt like an intruder and all he wanted to do now was leave.
“Glad they meet with your approval. I’m quite pleased with them myself actually.” He entered his bedroom and set the cage down. “I suppose you want to stay in here?” The owl rubbed its little head against Draco’s cheek. “I’ll take that as a yes then.”
“I’ll take that into consideration next time,” Potter laughed and was it wrong that Draco felt absurdly pleased that he’d accomplished that particular feat not once but
Pansy laughed. “I don’t know whether to be offended or gratified by your regard for my level of debauchery. There was no Polyjuice involved; we simply made the acquaintance of a pair of delectable twins. One happened to swing my way while the other swung Blaise’s.”
!” Albus wailed as he shot out of the robes like a Seeker after the snitch. He practically flew to Potter, who fell back onto his back with Al clinging to him as if his life depended on it.
Draco let out a belligerent growl and he too pulled his broom into a dive. He’d be damned if he let Potter out-sneak
Draco laughed. “Really Potter, what was I supposed to do? I couldn’t very well cast a spell with all those Muggles around now could I?”
Draco leaves the room with one last lascivious look back, and Harry wastes no time in cleaning the room. This past month has been frustrating at best, and Harry’s not sure he can ever look forward to Halloween without a certain vigilance from now on. Still, he figures now that the tricks are over, it’s only right that he collect on some treats.
There was a silence and Draco wondered why Potter suddenly looked nervous. “So…” Potter began and then trailed off, biting his lip and looking away at the dark street. Draco found himself once again waiting patiently for him to continue – something he found himself doing a lot these days – but Potter just continued to stare at the street.
, not some half-baked schoolboy. After he’d kissed me until I was so dazed I probably didn’t known my own name anymore, he invited me to adjourn somewhere more private.”
Draco’s nerve left him as soon as it had come, and he took a step back, fully intent on hightailing it away and sequestering himself back at the Manor until the end of days. There was something inherently
“I see.” said Draco absently. “Wait, what?” He turned to her with wide eyes. “Mother was invited too?”
His mother beamed and then turned to him and Potter again. “You boys should wait in the sitting room. We’ll bring you some when we’re done.”
“No need for that Harry.” Aunt Dromeda said. “After all, too many cooks spoil the broth. We’ll be fine.”
Mercury gave a hoot as if to second him. Draco pulled out of the grate and flopped onto his back, staring up at the ceiling. So apparently his friends had abandoned him after finding out what an utter prick he was. And yes, Draco was fully aware that what he’d done to Potter was beyond prick-ish.
She gracefully left the foyer and Draco made his way up to his suite of rooms. He switched out of his outdoor robes and haphazardly dragged on a pair of Muggle shorts and a plain t-shirt that was much too big for him. It made him look even more emaciated than he already was, but was also sinfully comfortable. He then grabbed a band off his dressing table and dragged some of his hair back into a messy queue. His hair really wasn’t long enough to tie back – and he sure as hell didn’t plan on growing it out – but he found that he liked to pull his hair back. His mirror, on the other hand, was not a fan of the look.
“I should never have introduced you to George,” he tells Draco plainly, giving the snake a small kick before he stalks back to the house.
Draco had no idea what a ‘film’, or ‘the tube’ were, though he had an inkling they were Muggle. Nevertheless he couldn’t back out now and he refused to look like an ignoramus in front of Potter so he just nodded.
“Hagrid warned us to be respectful around them and not to do anything to insult or anger them.” Draco continued. “But see, I was peeved at all the attention Potter was getting and thought that if he could do it, why couldn’t I? So I walked up to the beast and made the grave mistake of calling it a ‘great ugly brute’. It didn’t take it too well.”
“Not that it’s any business of yours,” Draco began pointedly, seriously considering the possibility that Potter had been cursed. “But I’m going home. I’ve already finished making my purchases and want to give my gift to Mother.”
“A little too long but perfect to describe Percy,” Ginny said in amusement. “Here’s an idea though. How ‘bout you try calling them by
Tentatively, he looked over at Potter again, but there was no overwhelming desire to lock lips with him anymore. Draco let out a relieved sigh; celibacy for practically two years had left him frustrated, that had to be it. And so what if he found Potter attractive? That was hardly news.
“I should have sent a message to St Mungo’s. Why, for fuck’s sake, did I fire-call Aunt Dromeda instead?”
he is an expert in all things Muggle, but his know-how really only consists of operating the television and using the coffee machine. Harry hasn’t even taken him to a Muggle restaurant or supermarket yet, wanting him to first be properly Muggle-trained. This outing has been a first.
Weasley exploded. He laughed so loudly that everyone jumped and this time George really did spill his drink all over Angelina.
“Come on,” said Potter, and to Draco’s immense surprise, he took his hand, pulling him closer to the swings as if it were the most normal of things to do. His hand was warm and rather calloused; no doubt he still played Quidditch. It was slightly larger than Draco’s own hand and felt capable and comforting. Draco’s breathe hitched in his throat and he wanted to snatch his hand back and scold Potter for confusing the shite out of him.
. All anyone has to do is mention you and he instantly perks up. I swear if he had a tail, it would be wagging nineteen to a dozen. Draco, you’re so good for them and all I ever want is to see them happy.” Her voice brooked no argument. “I may not be married to him anymore and I may not be in love with him, but Harry is still my family and I love him. So stop hurting him and stop hurting yourself over some stupid reason – because I’m pretty sure whatever you’re worrying about is not anything serious.”
Granger laughed. “Perhaps it hasn’t reached that stage just yet, but it sure seems to be headed that way.”
After a few quiet minutes of work, Potter seemed to decide that sitting straight was overrated and he brought his legs up to half-lie across the couch and subsequently put himself well within Draco’s personal space. Draco shuffled over to give him more room but Potter just stretched out even more until he was fully reclined and had his head resting on Draco’s thigh.
A day past and Draco was still in a foul mood. His mother had most probably heard the whole story from Ginny, and she made sure to stay away from him. She must have warned the house elves as well, and as such, Mercury was his only source of companionship at present. Draco didn’t mind so much, finding that his owl was pretty good at listening to his rants.
“I’m going down for a glass of water,” he called out to Potter, making for the stairs. Potter offered a distracted grunt in response.
Almost as if timed, his mother chose that moment to sweep back in with his aunt and cousin. Draco shot her a suspicious look, wondering if she could have possibly been listening outside the door.
“Some of my friends were staying back for the Easter hols, and they asked me to stay too,” he continued. “But I know that Gran feels lonely without me and I love coming home anyways. Sometimes I stay over at Harry’s and he lets me eat ice cream before dinner, but don’t tell Gran or she’ll be mad.” He lowered his voice conspiratorially. “Harry’s the best Godfather in the world! He lets me do
“You might not believe me, but as a Slytherin, I protect my own. I consider Ginny a close friend now and therefore she falls into the category of people I look out for.”
Potter stepped closer until they were nose to nose, his expression dangerous. “You were almost melting in my arms, Malfoy. I bet I
Draco leaves by Floo and as soon as the flames have dissipated, Harry is throwing a small handful of Floo powder into the grate. He calls out the address to Dean’s flat, and soon his old housemate is coming through into his living room, a small briefcase in his hand.
For a thrilling moment it looked like the smile was going to leave Bob’s face and Draco waited with bated breath. To his disappointment though, Bob seemed to compose himself quickly and managed to maintain his grin. “No problem, Mr Potter.” He scooped a few handfuls out of the bag into a much smaller one and sealed it. “Here you are.”
To a casual observer, it would seem that Narcissa was the personification of calm, but Draco wasn’t just anyone and he could read his mother well. Anger swelled up inside him as he took in the tense way in which she held her shoulders; how she was surreptitiously trying to reach into her robe sleeve for her wand.
“Well,” Potter continued, taking a step forward. “You obviously can’t use that when you sit for your N.E.W.T.s.”
tired after all that running you did today.” He smirked. “You’re almost as fast on land as you are on a broom.”
“Maybe he could be a crazy old house elf man?” Pansy suggested. “Narcissa says he speaks with them quite a lot now.”
Weasley turned to his wife with a helpless expression. “It’s Malfoy.” he said as if he could hardly believe his words. “Malfoy’s sitting on the ground of the playroom and he’s plaiting Rosie’s hair. And Hugo’s on his head
“Turn around so I can do your back,” he tells Harry. “Though I warn you, I’ve never done anything like this before so I’m not sure how well it’ll turn out.”
“You like it?” Draco has come up behind him and he looks smug as he nods at the snake. “I got it from George.” Draco brings a small black box to his mouth and says “Slytherin” to it. Almost immediately, the sound emerges from the snake in a drawn out hiss, sounding nothing like Draco’s actual voice. Harry throws the snake onto the ground in frustration.
“You said you’d come visit.” James stated blandly, crossing his arms in a pretty good imitation of his father.
James groaned. “Honestly, we just got back and you two are already all over each other. Don’t you get enough shagging done when we’re at school?”
“Salazar Mother! You cannot be trying to set me up with Potter of all people!” he said incredulously.
“I’m not even sure what exactly ‘the tube’ is.” Draco replied. “I take it, it’s some sort of Muggle transportation?”
The surprise in Potter’s voice did not go unnoticed and Weasley coughed pointedly, prompting him to immediately blush hotly.
“No, no, I don’t!” Harry isn’t sure why he’s so freaked out. Maybe he actually is a Parselmouth after all, and it has nothing to do with Voldemort. Still, Harry’s hand shoots up on instinct to touch his scar, half-expecting it to be swollen and pulsing. It isn’t of course, and he lets out a shaky breath. The War is over; there isn’t anything to worry about and he just needs to–
at Ginny. “I think it might be better if I go home actually…” he trailed off as he noticed Weasley’s gaze focusing on Draco’s neck, and Draco
“That I do.” Luna replied softly and Draco felt a warmth spread through him. He kissed her on the cheek one last time before finally strolling away from the house.
done in gold thread, and connected to his parents. He noticed that quite a few names had been scorched out and with a jolt, he gathered that these were people who had probably consorted with the ‘wrong sort’ by Pureblood standard. His aunt was one such scorched mark, as was the cousin he’d never met, Sirius Black. Teddy wasn’t even on the tapestry.
“So I’ve been told.” Draco shrugged again. “We got the robes in the end anyways and Al you’ll have one very happy mommy when you give these to her.”
“Feisty one, isn’t he?” Thin Lips spoke to what remained of the crowd. It had dissipated wonderfully when Draco had entered into the fray and now only a few stragglers were left. Apparently an angry Draco was still considered dangerous; a small comfort in its own regard.
She let out an irritated sigh and briefly glanced at the Weasleys, giving them a stiff smile before grasping Draco by the arm and leading him away from them. “If you must know,” she began once they were out of earshot, “I’ve been subjected to unfriendly behaviour before.”
“It was only a suggestion,” Draco said slowly, eyeing them warily and wondering what had gotten their wands in a knot all of a sudden.
“Well I couldn’t leave you to undertake this demanding task alone.” he replied teasingly, making his way to him. “So pray tell, what has the Golden boy on his knees?”
“I’m in love with Potter.” Draco’s face slackened in shock as he registered the words that had left his mouth, and Pansy and Blaise mirrored his expression. He brought a hand to cover the lower half of his face. “What the fuck?”
This whole ridiculous ‘outing’ had been a mistake right from the start. He’d already been hexed at, had rubbish chucked at him, and been called just about every rude name he knew and then some. One witch had even
“Oh yes, well as I said, he and Ms Weasley split up early last year. It was an amiable split too and I hear they’re still on the best of terms. No scandals whatsoever.”
Harry isn’t usually afraid of spiders but he thinks Aragog and his children may have done a number on him because the moment he’d caught sight of the gigantic monstrosity crawling towards him, he’d been
“Luna, I don’t know what my mother thinks she knows about my personal life, but I’d rather she kept her nose out of it.” Draco said stiffly.
Harry springs up as if hit by a Stinging Hex and he scrambles on the fake blood as he sinks to his knees in front of his boyfriend, feeling a sharp ache in his chest when all Draco does is give another muffled sob and shrink further back against the wall. He’s staring at Harry as if he can’t believe his eyes and Harry is scared to even touch him at the moment. Draco finally removes his hands from his mouth and reaches out tentatively, still trembling but not as much as before.
A carnal, desperate sound erupted from Potter; the thrashing against the bonds tripled in intensity, squeezing Draco inside of his hole, impossibly deeper. Draco watched as Potter’s still contained cock leaked pre-come, and he wanted nothing more than to lean down and lick it off.
The man had captured a small group of fans, who clapped good-naturedly at him as he stepped off the board and picked it up, nodding his thanks to them with what looked like a  smirk, from what Harry could tell from behind his smudged sunglasses.
Harry cleared his throat, remembering his breathing exercises and not giving him the satisfaction. A few moments later, Malfoy looked away, moving to face the sun as he stretched out again beside Harry by the pool.
As he sipped on the cold beverage, he was ever so grateful for her taking up bartending after school. This drink was indeed remarkable; he could easily see himself downing ten more by the end of the day.
After all, he knew that Potter had known all along it was him, thanks to his bellend of a boyfriend. That he had
Groaning pitifully, he desperately prayed that Malfoy doesn’t find the flogger he packed with him. But another part of him painfully hoped that Malfoy
Draco nodded vigorously as he caressed Harry’s face again with one hand, a slight grin saved only for him in the most genuine of moments, Harry keening in response as he turned back around to face the bed frame, every thrust producing another carnal sound from him.
Rather than answering, Potter’s hips propelled backward, seeking more touch. “Another, please,” Harry begged, and Draco almost lost it, adding one more finger and curving it perfectly, so it grazed against his prostate, and Potter whined, his legs shaking already from the feeling.
He could feel his prick twitch within its confines, and wouldn’t be surprised if he came untouched with the way things were going. He did manage to reluctantly grab at his robes with his free hand to keep himself from reaching down to touch his straining cock.
Draco felt as though his entire body was on fire, even though he wasn’t the one being tortured physically; he was still aching to come from the slightest touch. Instead, he took out his frustrations on the tied-up man below him.
Harry didn’t especially feel in the Christmas spirit this go-’round. This whole season had been quite a damper, and he blamed his uninspired mood on his workload this time of year.
And isn’t this just depressing. His first vacation in years and he has that unbearable ferret on his mind.
They then went down memory lane of fourth year and laughed at how terrible of a dancer Harry had been, but in that exact moment, he couldn’t care less as he recognized the song that just started to play.
He did have bigger things to think about, though. Number one on his list: finding out who was sending him these sodding songs.
"Uh-hm," Malfoy replied with an uncharacteristic lack of words. He seemed focused on a patch of dust on an old rug. Harry could see nothing wrong with it, just a stretch of an Oriental rug, a flowery pattern in sombre colours.
To his absolute delight, Malfoy seemed not to be one to wear pants to bed, as he pulled up the pajama bottoms with nothing underneath.
Harry frowned, not liking that idea at all, his heart beating sporadically in his chest at the thought of speaking with Typhon with actual words. He much preferred the song lyrics they had going at the moment.
Harry furrowed his eyebrows before slowly turning his head and meeting Draco’s steadfast gaze head-on. He almost gasped with the way he held his gaze, his grey eyes full of desperation and promise.
Graciously opening his mouth wider to accommodate him, Harry moaned again, the feeling of the man’s cock grazing the back of his throat. He wanted to plead with him to go further, deeper, and to pull back and let him breathe all at the same time.
He started to eat his salad.  Thankfully no more broken plates ensued as the evening transitioned into a lighter mood. Malfoy began telling him a story about how Neville almost broke his leg when Malfoy tried to teach him how to surf when he came down one summer.
It was clear Potter wasn’t the one who wrote these so-called ‘rules’, if the use of ‘him’ was anything to go by. Brushing aside the worry he felt at that, he sidled closer to Potter, who seemed to be somewhat twitchy with the expectation of what was to come.
Finally, they made it to Potter’s room, and Draco had to hide his jump of surprise at the sound of the lock on the door. He glanced back at Potter, who was laying his wand down on the bedside table, before making himself comfortable and sitting on what must be his bed.
He liked to float on his back, his arms with his arms fanned-out on either side of his lithe body. Good for him that the pool this morning didn’t have but two other occupants, who were currently relaxing in the hot tub across the way.
His voice started right as the music did; there was no warning for Harry to get settled at all (or hide) before Malfoy opened his mouth and began singing.
Draco wasn’t even sure if he was talking about Potter in that context or himself at this point for allowing this to happen.
It was almost as if his brain and cock were playing tug of war in his body, a clear winner coming out of the short-lived fight.
She smiled lazily at him and turned away towards the sitting area. “Watch out for the nargles; they can be pesky things.”
His blood pounded as his body hit wave after wave of sublime release, but then his mind caught up with what just transpired, and he was confident that his heart stopped. For one terrifying millisecond, he was sure the Slytherin had caught him.
By the fifth time in a row of this, Harry swallowed heavily, opting to walk to the pool bar for a drink to cool off.
Malfoy then took no time to take off his robe, stripping himself of it completely, and folding it up nice and neat on the bench beside his towel.
Harry’s grin widened when he felt Draco’s chest move in small titters. “Yes. I suppose that is what it means.”
As Draco touched Harry, he looked down and watched, entranced, as Draco barely touched his cock, his fingertips brushing along his length.
One of Harry’s eyes twitched in his attempt to hold back an angry retort, or one of those magical outbursts that he seemed to be having recently.  He took a sip of his water and glared at Malfoy from across the table.
And as soon as he was complete with his last sordid adventure that night, he would hang up the cloak for the remainder of the year, and that was that.
“What are you going on about!” Harry laughed at the ridiculous man beside him, swatting his hand away as he tried to pinch his cheek yet again.
He figured it might make things easier if he attempted to hold a conversation with the bastard, so Harry finished filling up his glass and began to make his way to the couple he had been eyeing most of the night.
But instead of hexing him or continuing their bickering, the blond downed the rest of his red concoction and gave Harry one more fleeting look. “Well, goodbye, Potter. I hope we never see each other here again.”
His cheeks were deliciously pink as he bit his bottom lip, his hips thrusting back and forth through his loose fist, water catching on his cock beautifully as it traveled down his length to his balls.
Obendiately, Harry sucked his finger into his mouth, and Draco grabbed his erection through his pants to relieve some tension. Harry will be the death of him; he was sure of it.
Harry had been in the middle of downing the rest of his unknown dragon drink when Luna piped up again, coughing and sputtering all over the place.
Suddenly, Pansy got a gleam in her eyes and leaned over to Blaise, whispering something frantically in his ear. “Oh, yes. Brilliant.”
By the time Harry had put his headphones away and his phone in a place away from harm, he looked up to see there was only one person left for him to partner with.
“Draco-? Are you alright?” Harry reached a gloved hand up to touch his face, but the blond took a step back, his mouth still agape.
He made sure his robes covered most of it; he wouldn’t want to disrupt poor old Slughorn’s delicate sensibilities and have him catch him getting off to the Chosen One’s odd mumbling problem.
“Look, Malfoy, whatever you have to say about that party, just shove it. Alright? You want to squash. Well, consider it all squashed.”
Harry didn’t care to watch when it occurred, but he couldn’t help himself. It was disconcerting that his friend just
Harry continued to watch as Malfoy finished drying himself thoroughly off with one of his posh fluffy towels and wrapped it around his waist.
It was as if the pool water suddenly became 20 degrees hotter then, and Harry reached up with one shaky hand, placing it gently against Malfoy’s pale chest.
It almost made him want to find whoever was sending him these songs and go full Hufflepuff on them and give them a hug.
Harry frowned and nudged his boyfriend with an elbow. “Nah, come on. We already brought it up; I’d rather get it over with, wouldn’t you?”
Inspecting the tight entrance to see if he would fit through, he jolted when he heard a loud clatter, followed by a man’s grumble.
One of Draco’s eyebrows lifted, “Oh, you mean one of the cold cases that Robards specifically told us to wait until after the New Year to break into again?”
After a few minutes of this, Harry had enough and decided to hell with it all and resolved to rent a surfboard. It couldn’t be
If they didn’t eat dinner together at least every other night of the week, Harry would consider it a lousy week altogether and Floo himself over to Draco’s flat to make sure he wasn’t feeling ill.
“Make it up? All you tried to do was that barmy duet with him! Which, by the way, mate, was a bit weird, and you are going to have to explain that one -
A sudden prick of annoyance hit him at that. “Okay, that’s fine, and I am sure I deserve that; however, I feel as though I am missing something here? I mean, I understand you lot being angry with me for embarrassing Malfoy up there -”
Typically nobody wanted to go up against Dean and his intimidating hip moves. Except for Malfoy, it seemed.
Draco gasped, shocked at the display, but managed to answer the soft kiss back with one of his own, one he had wished he had given Potter that night two months ago when he had him laid out under him.
“Malfoy! Pleased to see you here. I wasn’t sure if you would make it with the extra errands the departments had you on recently. You deserve a break.” Kingsley’s eyes, always firm and resolute, yet kind, as he searched Draco’s face.
"Ah, yes, this is exactly what I'm looking for." Malfoy pulled out quill and parchment and scratched down a note.
Actually, now that that thought had crossed his mind...it didn’t sound like a bad idea at all. But he held himself back, barely. He wanted to see if he could draw this interaction out for as long as possible.
In response, Draco leaned forward to draw Harry into another bruising kiss, one that left Harry breathless and leaking, desperate for any kind of touch he could get. Which was why he oh so lightly pushed his hips into Draco’s own, groaning at the feel of his cock rubbing along his thigh.
“-But I am...relieved it’s him. And happy. And I wanted him to know how I feel and that it’s reciprocated.”
Seeming to know precisely when Harry was getting closer and would loosen up the hold on his cock, and when he calmed down enough to where he wasn’t about to burst, it would realize that and tighten it’s hold again on him.
Seamus, Ron, Dean, and of course Harry himself, were working on an all-out plan that the Slytherins had concocted for him that consisted of Cher, fancy lights, and of course...more karaoke.
And he did just that. He leaned down, sucking the bottom lip between his own teeth, dragging it out, wanting to leave Potter just as breathless as he left him at the end of Potions. With that in mind, Draco straddled the man, making sure to rub himself against him, delighted with how hard Potter was under him already.
They haven’t shown up yet or any of the years prior, so Harry assumed it was something only she was privy to. Which honestly suited him just fine.
Giving in, he pressed his forehead against the other man’s, feeling the hand around his waist tighten minutely.
Harry couldn’t help notice the small amount of muscle the man had gained over the past few years, the strength emanating from him, and he remembered the way those same arms moved around on the stage, the way the stage-lights hit his skin so perfectly, how his sweat illuminated out to the crowd -
The bartender gave her a wink as he sat the shots down, and Pansy took them both, one right after the other.
Potter was truly a sight to behold, the ropes doing wonders against his flushed skin. Draco kept his finger on Potter’s skin, on his boney collarbone, now moving down further to his chest, lightly over one swollen nipple between its clamp.
Finally, he shook his head and chuckled under his breath. “Only Malfoy…” he muttered, as he turned back around and reached for the conditioners next, picking out one that smelled softly of lemons.
He could ask Draco if he wanted to come over for the Puddlemere game next week; that would lift his spirits, it always did. But he probably had plans with Justin already.
Draco walked straight to the bar and got a double gin and downed it as soon as the cold glass was handed to him, nodding to the bartender for another. The bartender hardly blinked an eye, fixing him up again, and this time, Draco took his time sipping the drink, eyeing the large room for a familiar puff of raven-black hair.
His eyes immediately went haywire, looking back and forth as if Typhon would pop right out of the woodwork with a
Malfoy finally reached down slowly and slid the wet undergarments off, throwing them to the side under the bench somewhere.
“Well,” Harry watched as Draco straightened up his shoulders and turned to face him completely, “I just discovered that sometimes, things are right in front of your nose and perhaps have been for a while.”
“I - I love you, Draco. And I guess I wanted to hash out our past before I said that. But - I don’t know why? I guess I thought it would be good to squash old silly things like that, but now, looking at you tonight, that’s really all I wanted to say.”
He took another sip of his drink as the man in the ocean decided it was time to move. Harry watched as the man leaned over his board on his stomach and somehow pivoted himself up onto his feet, the wave catching him as he began riding it so effortlessly Harry would've been surprised if he had some magic helping him out there.
Hermione pursed her lips. “I’m not so sure I believe it’s only anger that he’s feeling right now, but go on.”
Draco stopped then, and placed one hand on Potter’s shaking thigh, and grabbed his wand with the other. He raised his wand to his own throat, muttering a spell that would change the timbre of his voice for a few minutes, at least.
Draco blinked the wind from his eyes as he eyed Harry, pretending to rub some snow from his eye. “Well, here I am looking. What would you like from me now
He felt Malfoy’s arms tense around him, “Ah, I wasn’t aware Granger, and you were that...close that you would talk about those types of...topics. Wonder what Weasley has to say about that…”
Malfoy’s shower, however, was sadly vacant. Not even his seven different hair products were there waiting for him. He could see water on the tiled ground as if someone had just finished a bit ago.
“You do realize there are people around us. Surely you know better than to embarrass yourself to that degree? Oh wait, that’s right, you have no measure on that at all, do you? Want to go ahead and nail your coffin of mortification shut then?”
Harry didn’t think much of the news, having more important things to occupy his mind this year, with his classes, and studying for the inevitable N.E.W.T.S, which honestly began to be more than a bit of a bore after the first month of being back.
“You should be,” Harry muttered into his salad, feeling the other man’s gaze on him from across the table.
“Hmm...we’ll see about that.” Harry laughed, dragging him even closer, steadfastly ignoring the hooping and hollering from the group of Gryffindors from the other table.
Draco quirked one eyebrow, his eyes still trained on Harry. “Levels?” he breathed out, one hand coming up to trace Harry's collarbone, causing goosebumps to erupt in his wake.
Draco pulled out entirely then and pushed his boyfriend over, so he laid on his back, face looking up at him.
Either that or he desperately needed it just as much as Harry did at that moment. That in itself spurred Harry on even more. “You like me like this, don't you Malfoy?” Harry asked naughtily, rolling his eyes up to the back of his head at the feeling of a third finger entering his arse, his breaths coming out in heavy huffs.
Draco didn’t know why, but reading about the Savior’s sexual preferences and learning first-hand was different, and it gave him a thrill knowing the truth from the man himself. His old, long-time crush was veering its ugly head back, and Draco needed to cool it down.
Draco’s eyes were gleaming now in glee as the laughter subsided, and he sighed, shaking his head, “Ah, Harry. You can be so unperceptive at times. But
“Come on, let’s get you some water. Some with...perhaps a little less salt?” Rodrick offered him a hand, and Harry begrudgingly took it, making sure to drop it as soon as he stood up, trying to hide the shake in his legs.
Harry nodded once and pulled out his notes pertaining to the House Elves Victory Fund. Thank Merlin for Hermione and her last-minute help with it, as he had nothing to go off of.
He couldn’t understand why he allowed himself to get so riled up about stupid things like how many times Draco has looked his way versus Justin all night and why Justin felt the need to kiss Draco’s cheek at least once every half-hour.
Draco decided to loosen his grip a bit, he wouldn’t want Potter to lose all interest, but that didn’t seem like a possibility as his cock seemed hard enough to cut diamonds. He wrapped his hand back around him, this time a more firm grip than before, and Harry puffed out a breath.
“Wouldn’t you like to know! Why are you so obsessed with what I smell anyway? Hoping it’s you? Do you desperately desire me, Malfoy?” Harry felt a disgusting surge of pride, simultaneously seeing Malfoy clearly sink into himself, his face growing paler than usual.
Since this was a Muggle resort, Harry made sure to hide any incriminating items, like his wand, for example, in one of his bags after he inconspicuously arrived where no one could have seen.
He carefully watched as Harry seemingly calmed down after a bit, the excitement fizzling into a dull pleasure. He still looked beautifully obscene, his mouth open, eyes closed, all his attention was on him, following the flow of light pressure Draco was giving him, enough for him to feel his hand, but light enough for it to be maddening.
Harry just figured pub night was a ploy of Ron to get him to take his earbuds out for longer than half an hour and actually interact with society.
Malfoy looked as though he didn’t know whether to laugh or cry at that. “You think-” Malfoy coughed, trying to hide his surprise laughter, “Is that what just happened, what you call…
Hermione shot him such a strong look in response that he stood up from the Great Hall table and scurry off to his room to grab the sodding book after all.
The blond’s attentions were pasted to his mobile, eyes glinting, absorbed in whatever he was doing. It looked to Harry that he was typing something up, one ear plugged with an earplug and a soft smile gracing his face.
He threw the dirty towel in a hamper under the bar and pulled out a clean one to wipe down some glasses.
A whimper came from Malfoy then, and Harry knew he was seconds from coming as he watched, entranced, as his classmate’s hand then suddenly halted, as his cock twitched and he was suddenly coming, his head thrown back and his mouth open with a breathy gasp.
But all of a sudden, Potter muttered something low in the back of his throat, and Draco found himself leaning backward, away from him, and back in his seat. He found himself getting hot and wondered if Slughorn ended his cool air spell.
“If I had known a simple thank you would have me in this position; I would have done so months ago.” Draco nipped at his bottom lip, earning a deep groan in his back of Potter’s throat.
But Harry paid them no mind at all at this point; in fact, he was pretty confident that if Voldemort rose from the dead and Apparated into their presence, demanding a duel to the death, he still wouldn’t look away from Malfoy’s - erm, everything.
Harry swung his head back to glare daggers at his partner, only to find grey eyes staring back at him with a fiery intensity, his pupils larger than he had ever seen them before.
He pulled out his mobile, his attentions shifting back and forth from checking it every so often for any new songs and eyeing Malfoy’s table across the way to make sure he wasn’t missing anything important there either.
A few times, he came so close to sending Malfoy something in response, just to try to wrangle another response from him, but when he cornered and asked Parkinson if that would be a good idea, she had just cackled.
Harry clenched his eyes shut, his knuckles white as he gripped his hands to the point of aching under the cloak. Worse still, he felt the familiar stirrings of arousal. He forcibly moved his attentions from Malfoy and turned his head a few inches to the right from the minuscule opening, leaning his forehead against the cold stone wall.
A loud bang echoed in the room then, and Draco recoiled from his position, looking up to see the door of the room swinging open, and a mousy-haired man with a furious expression swept into the room. Draco recognized him immediately.
He took another peek out the window and saw with horror that Potter had managed to escape the mob and was almost at the door now. Short from stuffing himself into an owl cage, there was really nowhere for him to possibly hide so he grabbed the nearest item – which just so happened to be a cage – and rushed to the counter. Affecting a nonchalant pose, Draco shot Bob a warning glance and hoped for all the world that he looked like a normal customer about to make a purchase. Just in time too, as Potter chose that moment to push through the door, the doorbell giving a soft tinkle.
“I wouldn’t say that,” Draco answered slowly, considering the matter. “Lucius may have thrown a fit and smashed up the table but Mother came to my room later that night and told me that it was perfectly alright. There was the matter of my marriage contract but she said we’d deal with that hurdle when the time came.”
will be expecting you here as soon as possible. You’re surprisingly good company. For a Slytherin,” she added with a smirk.
“I still think you should take it easy though.” Draco turned back to his sorting. “We don’t want a setback in your recovery.”
“We both know, you don’t mean that.” Draco’s tone is much too smug for Harry’s liking, and what little hold he has on his temper snaps.
Draco began to shake his head. “No. No, this isn’t happening. I’m not– I can’t be– It’s just attraction. It’s a fucking crush! I can’t–”
“I was just trying to help, for fuck’s sake! How was I supposed to know the little bugger would take it the wrong way? I only took the bloody roast out of the oven for him.”
Draco shook his head with an indulgent smile. “You know, I could have summoned it myself. You’ve only just been given the go-ahead to doing magic. It doesn’t mean you have to go crazy with it.”
At first, all he could do was lie there with his face in the dirt, fingers still closed tight around the quivering Snitch. He could hardly hear anything save for the staccato thudding of his heart and a light ringing in his ears, his lungs seemed to have forgotten how to breathe and the rest of his body probably hated him now, and yet Draco had never felt more
Harry rolls his eyes. “I’m pretty sure what you’re doing could be considered harassment, and I don’t want her calling the cops on us.”
Dean tilts his head critically and then hums. “Yeah, I think that looks good.” He gives a small shiver. “Merlin, Harry, you look pretty horrific actually. Malfoy’s going to have a right fright when he finds you like this.”
“You could have asked me,” Ginny persisted. “At least after you felt more comfortable with me. Friends talk about stuff like that.”
Suddenly there was the now familiar sound of rustling in the bushes, though this time, whatever it was sounded much
Ginny smiled sweetly at Potter and patted him on the cheek. “Long story short, Draco’s my new best mate. He’s here to play Quidditch with us. You’re Seeker on Bill’s team. Oh, and I look forward to watching Draco wipe the pitch with you.”
Apparently Luna had offered to babysit the children as their parents were still busy and were due to arrive only in time for the party. The party, which was not supposed to start for another hour and a half in fact, something that Luna had kindly failed to mention. Draco now knew that it had all been a trap and he was torn between admiration for the decidedly Slytherin tactics Luna had employed, and outrage for being tricked in the first place. He had a feeling his mother had played a role in the ploy as well
Two more women entered after them and… bloody hell, was that the Beauxbaton’s champion from his fourth year? The veela who all the boys had been raving about. She’d actually married into the Weasleys?
Ginny shook her head, the amusement leaving her face. “I haven’t had any need to go meet McGonagall. He’s there though, and as intimidating as ever if the tales I’ve heard are correct. The lower classes are frightfully well-behaved this year because they’re so scared of being sent to the Headmistress’ office. Apparently she isn’t there sometimes when they’re sent up and Snape takes it upon himself to lecture the kids until she gets back.”
“Listen, I’m not so sure if…” he trailed off as the boys’ faces fell. “I mean, I’m not busy but – Potter?” The prat only shrugged indifferently.
The redhead’s eyes narrowed and Draco sincerely hoped she wasn’t going to start screaming at him, or hexing. He still shuddered at the mere thought of her infamous Bat Bogey hex.
Draco leant back on one of the empty bookshelves. “And what makes you think I’d be willing to do that for
James guiltily dropped the Muggle markers he was using to draw slugs on his sister’s cheeks. Teddy managed to grab Hugo before the boy went tumbling out the soon-to-be closed window, and Fred ceased in his hair pulling long enough to throw a small stuffed cat at Louis’ head. It caught him unawares and the can of paint he’d been holding went flying into the air, covering all the nearby children as well as the wall in purple paint.
“I still think it might do you good to have to look after someone other than yourself for a change,” she continued, and her tone brooked no argument. “Now, why don’t you take your new
Blaise wrapped his arm around Pansy and pulled her against him, whispering something into her ear that had the effect of Pansy slumping back against him and releasing a shuddering breath.
.” He shot a covert look around and saw that Harry had given up the chase and was now sulking in a corner. If Draco hadn’t been so relieved, he might have laughed at the petulant look on his face.
“I’m gay,” Draco replied at once, giving Potter a cool look. He refused to ever be ashamed of who he was. “I hope that doesn’t bother you.”
Still, it was a tad disconcerting to hear her so openly jabbing at Lucius and while it gratified him to see that the fire she’d had during his childhood was returning to her, it also saddened him to think that it had ever been put out in the first place.
“I don’t think you’ve any broken ribs or fractures,” Molly finally said when she was done with her examination. “You’ve hit your head, though, and I’ll want to see to that. Come along, I have some healing paste that we can rub on to take the soreness and bruising away.”
“I’ll be going then,” Draco said finally. “Goodnight Potter.” He turned to go down the steps but suddenly found himself being hauled back and shoved up against the wall.
“It’s getting late,” Draco replied simply, smoothing out his trousers and looking around to see if he’d left anything behind. “Besides, you should have a night out with your
“Can’t Harry.” Granger sighed. “Rosie still has a fever and I think Hugo has caught it too. It should go away in a few days but they need rest. Let me know if it’s a good movie and I’ll take them to see it later with the others. I have to go now. Bye Harry. Kids have fun.” She turned to go back into the Leaky. “Good to see you back Malfoy.” she added with a small
“You know, it might be faster if you helped me with the cleaning first,” Harry remarks as he reaches for a knife. “Just a suggestion.”
The Snitch must have sensed that it was being chased and suddenly darted to the left, disappearing from sight again. Draco pulled his broom to a halt as he lost track of it and turned to Potter. He was busy manoeuvring his broom out of the way of a Bludger and he too seemed to have lost it. Draco exhaled slowly. The Snitch couldn’t have gone far and if he just kept his eyes peeled, he could…
He lifted the pillow and his face must have been quite the sight if Narcissa’s stunned expression was anything to go by. She recovered fast enough though, and gave him a cold look.
Draco was sure his heart came to a dead stop when Potter held out an unassuming brown wandbox. He stood up on legs that were shaking badly and took the box into his hands, locking eyes sharply with Potter.
He looked up to find his friends regarding him with worried expressions. He bit back a laugh. For all their scandalous behaviour and quirks, Blaise and Pansy resembled nothing more than a pair of doting parents when they looked at him like that. He shook his head.
anymore?!” he shrieked, pulling a sheet over himself as he realized that he was wearing his ‘clothes-for-my-eye-alone’. “What has the world come to?!”
Draco held out the finished plate to Potter. “Can you take this up? I’ll be with you in a bit, just need to arrange another plate.” What he really needed was some time to pull himself together when he felt like he was splitting at the seams. Potter took the plate but placed it back on the counter.
Potter sighed. “The Leaky or The Three Broomsticks, which are both perfectly fine establishments. Christ, you’re overprotective.”
“Well, fuck me,” Draco cursed as he ducked into the closest shop and startled a witch who had just opened the door to exit.
Granger smiled again and came forward. “I’ll just be taking Hugo then.” she said as she took her squealing son off Draco’s shoulders. “I won’t try to take Lily since Ginny says she’s quite taken by you.”
The fireplace flared at that eventful moment and they both sprang apart at once. Potter stumbled over the coffee table and landed sprawled across the couch just as Weasley emerged, a large cake box secured firmly in his hands. He paused at the grate as he surveyed the scene in front of him and Draco flushed guiltily even though he had nothing to feel guilty about. To make matters worse, Potter’s shirt had gotten twisted up during his fall and his muscular abdomen was exposed in a most telling manner.
This time Draco did jump, whirling around with his wand aloft as Pansy shrieked and Blaise fell off the bed onto his face. Ginny marched in like a general leading her charge into battle, followed close behind by an equally determined-looking Granger, one exasperated Weasley, and last but certainly not least, Potter. If their arrival wasn’t already astonishing enough, there were yards of rope wound tightly around Potter’s body and he was being levitated in by Granger.
“Malfoy, you’re early.” A voice said behind him and he jerked forward, tripping over his own feet. A hand grabbed his elbow, preventing him from falling on his face and for a moment he was pulled back against a firm body. Draco gulped.
A few days later, the pair were seated side by side in the attic as they attempted to restore an old toy carousel to its former glory. There was a great deal to be found in the attic, a plethora of items that the Blacks of the past had accumulated over the years, and Draco had been delighted to discover truly fine pieces of his heritage in the most unlikeliest of nooks.
get murdered though, I call dibs on his wardrobe,” Blaise said quickly. Pansy silently stared at him for a long time and he eventually excused himself to the bathroom.
“Potter, we blondes can wear many things, but burgundy is a definite no. It makes us look practically sallow.”
On a whim, he bent down and gave her a quick peck on the forehead. “Goodnight Lily.” He was just pulling away when she suddenly said something in a voice almost overcome with sleep.
“Pot, kettle,” Potter returned with a jaunty smile, and then yelped and took on a defensive position when Blimpy suddenly appeared in front of them with a loud
owl – as it slowly clambered to its feet, shaking its head in a dazed manner. How it had even gotten out of the cage in the first place, he had no idea, but he was sure the latch had still been firmly locked when he’d set the cage down beside the fireplace. Narcissa leant forward to get a better look at the owl and it gave a polite hoot as if to say
“The mood swings are the worst of it,” Bill sighed, taking a long sip from his drink. “One moment she’s all smiles and the next she’s in tears because I forgot to put my dirty socks in the clothes hamper. Thank Merlin it’ll all end next month.”
The owl took off and did a quick circuit through the rooms before alighting back on Draco’s shoulder. It hooted once, sounding vaguely approving, and Draco laughed.
Draco’s breath stuttered in his chest and his face felt like it was on fire. Potter really did have beautiful eyes; vibrant green and framed by long, thick lashes. He could only imagine how devastating they’d be without the glasses in the way, and for once he was grateful for the hideous frames. Potter’s expression suddenly shifted and before Draco knew what was happening, he was pouncing forward for a kiss.
“Well, that was anticlimactic,” Pansy mused dryly. “After all we did to get them to this point too.”
When the bushy-haired menace sprang her ambush, Draco was lying in bed staring at the ceiling as he was wont to do these days. He hadn’t seen Ginny since the accident which was probably because she was pissed that he’d handed a cursed book to her other half; bringing to mind past events best left forgotten. He turned, fully expecting to see his mother, but instead found himself faced with one Hermione Granger, famous for her intellect and doesn’t-know-when-to-bloody-quit attitude, breaking into his sanctuary like a witch on a mission.
Draco looked down at the smooth elm wand in his hand. “Yes, well this is Mother’s wand. I figured it might be best to have a wand that actually responds well to me at all times.”
“Wait, you’re leaving right this second?” Potter shot to his feet as well, mouth dropping open with something akin to dismay. He held out a hand imploringly. “You really don’t have to.”
Draco groaned. “Well, it sounded more like a bloody date to me.” He rubbed his eyes tiredly, resigned now to the fact that he’d apparently been killing himself for nothing.
Kreacher cracked into the room with two plates piled high with sandwiches carefully balanced on his hands. Weasley’s mood lifted instantly.
A strange look passed over Potter’s face and Draco found himself leaning in as if drawn by some sort of invisible force. They were much closer now, Potter’s eyes boring into Draco’s own. “I was hoping it could be,” he confessed lowly, and Draco, winded and completely off-balanced in the face of Potter’s brazen honesty, wanted nothing more than to kiss him.
. Granger and Weasley were long gone because they so conveniently had ‘somewhere to be’, and Draco had been standing outside the library door for a good fifteen minutes now, willing his legs to move. The rational part of him knew that Potter wouldn’t have asked after him if he didn’t want to see him – if he didn’t
Draco ignored him in favour of taking a cautious peek outside. Potter had to have passed on by now and… Bugger, it looked like he was trying to claw his way through his throngs of worshippers to get to the shop.
Draco swore under his breath and hastily ducked out of the way as a spell shot straight at his head. It hit the wall behind him and he gulped as he took in the smoking hole it had made in the brick. Salazar’s ghost, that could have been his
“I think your eyes are bigger too,” the Weaslette continued, tapping a finger contemplatively on her chin. “Or it could be that your face is thinner. Your hair is longer too.”
“Keep it down, you utter berk,” Pansy hissed, glancing behind her. “Do you want to inform the entire household?”
“I use this broom so often, it’d probably fall apart if I didn’t routinely service it,” Ginny explained as she reached into her servicing kit and pulled out a pair of twig clippers.
Potter complained frequently about the unfairness of it all, and almost as if his whinging had been answered, suddenly Auror training was put on hold later on in the week. A raid gone wrong had left a multitude of Senior Aurors in the hospital, which meant there was a subsequent drop in active Aurors. There simply weren’t enough Aurors to spare for the trainees and this allowed them whole days to work on the attic until training resumed.
Harry held his hand as they walked back to the rest of the party. James had gotten over his anti-kissing fit and stated gravely that while he shared Al’s sentiments when it came to Draco becoming a part of the family, he would not want to see any more ‘yucky kissing’, so could they kindly not do it in front of him again. To tease him Harry had swiftly leant over to give Draco a quick peck and James had screamed in outrage and took off back to the others.
Ignoring the warning looks his mother was shooting him, he pushed his way towards them. He dearly wanted to pull out his wand and hex the living daylights out of the swine, but he couldn’t risk violating his probation. Landing himself in Azkaban with Lucius was the last thing he needed.
Draco laughed. He’d actually had a nice time today. Better than he’d ever expected a day out with Potter to be.
. The house elf stared at Potter dispassionately and he blushed, tucking his wand back into its holster and pulling out of the crouched position he’d taken.
Al studied the playground gravely, tapping his chin as he no doubt comparing the pros and cons of each piece of equipment. Eventually his eyes settled on the swings.
“That was so cool! Did you see me, Harry? I did just what Cousin Draco said and I didn’t fall off even once!” Teddy exclaimed with a big smile on his face.
“Must be nice to be rich,” Angelina mused casually, and just like that the atmosphere of the room was lighter. “Bet you had a lot of fun as a kid with such a big garden to play in.”
They descended into silence and Draco began to feel awkward as the meal went on and no words were exchanged. It reminded him uncomfortably of meals at the Manor back when he was growing up, but there was nothing he could do about it. During their impromptu tea party the day before, Narcissa had skilfully led the conversation and he’d hardly had to say anything at all. Today too, their cleaning had been done in silence. Draco had never been very good at small talk when he was ill at ease.
,” Draco whimpers pathetically and Harry gropes around frantically for his wand. He eventually finds it wedged between the cushions and gratefully casts a
Draco rubbed the bridge of his nose in anguish, coming to the conclusion that children were evil beings indeed. How he could have once found them cute, he had no idea.
Draco let out a breath that he hadn’t known he’d been holding. George suddenly gave him a hard smack on the back, causing him to stumble a few steps forward.
Draco knew that he had to stop before he fell in too deep, but he was afraid that it was already too late. The times he wasn’t with him, Draco’s thoughts were full of Potter and the children. He wondered what they were doing at the moment. He recalled the times he’d spent with them. He found himself craving their company more and more. He sometimes wondered if he was addicted. Addicted to something that no potion could cure him of. Even in school, Potter had always caught his attention but now rather than trying to invoke an angry response, Draco would do just about anything to make him smile. Whenever Potter looked over at him with that smile that made his eyes practically sparkle, all he could do was try to smile back as normally as he could, willing himself not to do anything stupid like blush or look at Potter like he was Draco’s whole world, or – Salazar forbid – haul him over for a fevered snog.
“I have nothing better to do.” Draco had replied with a casual shrug, trying not to show how curious he suddenly was to know more about the wizard seated across from him.
As the conversation threatened to veer towards a topic he could not discuss with a calm face, he politely excused himself to get a drink and hurried off again. This time he really did bump into George though, causing the man to spill his drink all over the floor. Mortified, Draco tried to back away but ended up slipping on the spilt drink. He would have had to face the indignity of landing on his arse if George hadn’t stepped forward and wrapped an arm around his waist, the result being that it gave the impression of him dipping Draco.
Harry’s happily humming away as he rubs shampoo into his hair, when the shower curtain is suddenly yanked back. He turns, fully expecting it to be Draco here to join him, grey eyes filled with wickedness. Instead he’s met with the terrifying appearance of one Severus Snape, who in all sense should be dead and certainly not cornering him when he’s buck naked in the shower.
Pushing his wet bangs out of his eyes, Draco turned to see that the perpetrator was little more than a schoolboy, probably in his fourth or fifth year at Hogwarts. The crowd around them was watching with interest and this only seemed to spur the whelp on even more.
He’s out in the garden a week later, mowing the lawn the Muggle way. Draco has opted to stay inside with the pretence that Harry doesn’t need any help mowing, though Harry knows the real reason is that Draco is scared of the electric mower and the loud sound it makes.
Draco blinked and then felt his lips curve into a wide grin. “You know what your Dad and I always say.” He turned to look at Harry, listening agog to James’ tale, Al commenting from the side. “A lily in a hole is a sign of good things to come.”
As soon as Bob was gone, Potter turned to Draco. “Listen, Malfoy, I just wanted to say I’m sorry for how I treated you last night.”
“Hey Dad, aren’t you s’posed to officiously introduce us?” James broke the silence once again. “’Cause you already know Draco and Auntie Hermione says it’s rude not to introduce people.”
“Mmm, that’s nice,” Harry sighs, closing his eyes and letting his boyfriend release all his tension using only the magic of his hands. If he wasn’t already a successful solicitor, Draco could make a fine career as a masseuse.
“Other than the apparent,” Weasley snorted and then yelped when Granger smacked him hard with a hissed, “Not now
When he came out, Luna was waiting for him and she held out a small vial for him. Draco fell on the hangover potion like a starving man being given food and downed it in one gulp, hardly even noticing the horrid taste. Relief was almost instantaneous and he sighed happily. Perhaps the day wouldn’t be as bad as he thought.
“Will you help us?” he asked stoutly, and again there was something so familiar about that unwavering stare. Draco gave a curt nod, even though he wasn’t so sure he was willing to climb down into a filthy hole, just to retrieve a sodding flower. He’d simply levitate it out if they were so adamant about it. So he approached the hole and peered down, and then almost fell in himself. A little girl stared up at him with wide, terrified brown eyes, her red hair hanging messily around her tear-streaked face.
“So I’m equivalent to a piece of furniture now? Property of Potter.” Draco had no idea why he’d just said something so strange, but his mouth didn’t seem to be listening to him.
“It’s quite invigorating,” his mother continued. “Takes up more energy than I initially thought. Of course we could always use magic, but Dromeda says that it tastes better when they’re made the Muggle way. She said she’d teach me to bake a cake next time!”
Draco tried to bite back a laugh but ultimately failed. “If I spread this little titbit of information around, I’m sure you’d lose your image.”
With that he hurried out of the room, but not before he saw his mother and aunt exchange sympathetic looks.
Draco gave him a vicious smile, teeth bared. “I am, actually. My mother is by far the bravest witch I know, and anyone who was present at her hearing would know that too. Lying to You-Know-Who isn’t something that many have lived to speak about.”
Draco waited until everyone else had gone and as soon as the door closed behind them, he dropped the flirty attitude, regarding Potter apprehensively. Potter stared back impassively for a moment and then shoved his hands into the pockets of his jeans and turned away. Draco internally winced. Apparently Potter wasn’t going to make this any easier for him.
“Yes Potter, I know he got there first. I’m actually pleased that he pulled them out from that corner they’d been shoved in or I might not have seen them, but the fact remains that he did not deserve them.”
Which brought him to the only downside to his newfound liking of Potter – the growing attraction he felt for him.
Still, Draco felt panic building up inside him. What if he hadn’t managed to turn his head in time? If the kiss had landed its mark, there was no way he would have been able to resist Potter, and it made Draco hate himself all the more – that he could so easily throw all his principles away just like that.
he saw that it was not a thing at all, but a small child. A little boy with a mess of inky black hair and a pair of the biggest green eyes he’d ever seen. Those eyes were now staring up at him unblinkingly and Draco felt oddly unsettled. It was almost as if he’d seen them before. The child continued to stare, then he opened his little mouth and Draco noticed that his bottom lip was trembling violently.
Thin Lips stepped smoothly in front of them. “Leaving so soon? But we were having such a pleasant conversation.” Nasal Voice laughed again. It seemed to be the only thing he was good for.
Potter gave him a look that clearly said ‘you are an imbecile’, while James and Al gave twin whoops and pounced on him again.
Potter looked pained. “Listen, I didn’t mean it like that. I’m truly sorry and it has nothing to do with my bollocks. I mean, yeah I
“No,” Harry tells him firmly. “There are loads of other tricks I could’ve pulled on you. I took it too far with this one and that is not on you.”
“Oh you don’t know the half of it.” Potter replied with an enigmatic smile. “Anyways let’s hear it.”
“Yes?” He made the mistake of looking down and was immediately captivated by Potter’s intense stare.
His aunt invited them all to stay for dinner as well, but Potter declined, saying that he’d best be getting back to the children who were staying with the Weasel. He left soon afterwards and Draco had shared a strangely awkward goodbye with him. Perhaps they were feeling strange after realizing that they’d shared a rather personal conversation.
“Shall we go?” Luna asked kindly, seeming to sense his dilemma. “The Burrow is not too far from my house, as you might know. I’ll side-along you.”
“Ignore her,” he tells Draco as he heads inside to retrieve their wands and some carving knives. When he comes out again, he can see Draco making rude gestures at their hidden neighbour and he sighs, discretely passing him his wand, which he pockets just as sneakily.
They drifted into a comfortable silence and Draco wondered if this was what it was like to be Potter’s friend. Eventually Potter broke the silence with a question.
Ginny caught sight of him, kneeling in front of the fire. “Not a bad look for you,” she said with a sly look. “Come on, I was worried you’d chicken out so I came to get you. Sweet Godric, your house is
“Excuse me, but may I interject?” Mrs Weasley enquired pleasantly, as if she hadn’t shamelessly inserted herself into their discussion uninvited. Her daughter stood behind her, idly watching the scene with arms loosely crossed over her chest. “Mrs Malfoy, if I’m assuming correctly here, it seems that you’ve been harassed regularly. Have the attempts ever crossed over to violence?”
“Well, here we are,” he said aloud when they reached his set of rooms, gesturing out with his arm and feeling a tad silly as he did so.
“Six tickets for Up please. Two adult tickets, two child tickets and my three and one year olds can share our tickets can’t they?” Potter said, reaching into his pocket for the money.
Potter looked unrepentant, leaning back against the kitchen table with a stupid grin on his face. Draco hadn’t heard the slightest indication of his entry and he cursed Auror training for making Potter even sneakier than he already was.
Luckily for Potter, their stop came up just then and he was able to beat a quick escape, almost leaving Draco and the children behind in his haste to leave the woman behind. Once out of the train, they made their way back to the surface and after walking for a bit longer they came to what Potter pointed out as the film theatre. There was a small compartment at the front and a girl sat in it, passing out tickets in exchange for Muggle money.
Draco huffed and took his place on the floor by the pile of books he’d been sorting through. “What makes you think something is wrong?”
“Ginny tore a right strip off of me when I told her what happened,” Potter continued. “Yelled at me for a good half hour I think, and even threatened to hex my bollocks off if I didn’t apologise as soon as I could.”
Draco shook his head, hysteria bubbling up inside him. What the fuck had he been thinking? He couldn’t tell Potter, he simply could not.
“Nonsense,” she interrupted sharply, and then turned to a startled Potter. “My son accepts your proposition.”
“Alright.”  Draco replied and he hated himself for still feeling the ghost of Potter’s hold on his hand.
Ginny gave him a friendly shove. “Seriously though, were you actually worried about my brothers? Mum’s already told them about what happened. If not friendly, they’d at least treat you all politely.”
Draco opened his mouth to say something but the train suddenly gave a jerk forward and they were moving. Draco tried looking out the window but he could only see darkness. He instinctively moved closer to Potter before remembering himself and moving away again.
“Malfoy, you might want to pull your jaw off the ground.” George’s amused voice in his ear had him hurriedly closing his mouth – mortified that it had indeed dropped open – with an audible click. Bill and George snickered.
“I forgot to take off the bloody Repelling Charm,” Potter groaned, running his hands through his unruly hair and mussing it up even more. “I need to go back. See you, Malfoy.” Before he could respond, Potter was already hurrying back to Eeylop’s.
When his fingertips come in contact with Harry’s cheeks, both of them let out twin sighs, and then Harry has an armful of Draco and is crushing him back against the wall, feverishly stroking his soft blonde hair as Draco clings to him and buries his head in the crook of Harry’s neck.
Harry sodding Potter was standing before him, his atrocious hair even more of a mess than usual with leaves and twigs and
Things come to a head when the lights suddenly turn off, and they are plunged into darkness. Draco lets out a bloodcurdling shriek and Harry yelps as his nails dig into his arm so hard, he thinks the skin might have broken.
Draco tried to swallow around the lump that had suddenly lodged itself into his throat. He stared down at the smiling child, left orphaned by the War. Apart from his mother, there wasn’t anyone else in the world that Draco could call his family. Lucius had long since passed away, Azkaban being too much for his health, and Draco hadn’t even come back for his burial. He wondered what it would have felt like to be like Teddy, never knowing the feel of a parents’ love. He looked up and found Potter, laughing at something Albus had said. Potter would understand just how Teddy felt, and Draco suddenly felt ashamed of himself. When they’d been around Teddy’s age, Draco had made it a point to bring up Potter’s lack of parents every chance he had, never once stopping to consider how the other boy would feel.
“Up Dwaco.” Lily said, toddling over to Draco and he swung her up onto his shoulders the way he’d seen Potter do before.
Blimpy cleared his throat pointedly. “Mistress says that if Master Draco is finished attacking Mr Potter, you both is to join her for tea.”
Draco smirked. “I continued to harass them as much as I dared. Never anything to cause them real harm, just little things to tick them off. When Lucius was sent to Azkaban, the first thing I did when we came home was find someone to take them off our hands. A collector of rare birds has them now. He offered to pay us but I couldn’t take his money when I was giving him peacocks from hell.”
Ginevra scoffed. “Oh please, don’t play dumb Draco. Do you really think no one has noticed that you’re avoiding Harry as if he’s the plague? I don’t know what happened between you two but you need to stop running away and face him head-on.”
Draco shot the door a dubious look but sure enough, people seemed to be giving it a wide berth as they walked past.
Draco snorted. “Please, I’ve known since third year at least, maybe even second year. It was plain as day that Granger had a thing for Weasley. Honestly she’d sometimes regard him with the same look she’d give books and that’s saying something! All that had to happen was for Weasley to get a clue, and mind you I was a tad bit worried about that part. Blaise was practically ecstatic when he was dating Brown but really, who in their right mind would choose
you! You’re all they talk about. For the past few weeks it’s always been ‘Draco this’ and ‘Draco that’ and ‘When will we see Draco again’. I don’t know what you did, but they’re utterly charmed.”
Draco practically climbed over James in his haste to get out of the taxi of death. Potter had wanted to visit a Muggle park that day and in a moment of madness, Draco had been persuaded to take his first ever ride in a Muggle car. Needless to say, he wouldn’t be doing that again anytime soon!
Fire, so hot and so close. Screams and shrieks coming from all directions. Vince’s face as he lost his grip on the ledge. Fear, panic, a sense of despair. And then a hand reaching out to him. A back against his front, solid and comforting…
, but it was a wand nonetheless, and after being without one for more months than he liked to remember, Draco was thankful for it. At least he wasn’t reduced to living as a Squib any longer.
shriek like a girl. He didn’t. He simply gave a… manly squeak. It was hardly a squeak even – more of a gasp really. A
Draco felt completely humiliated and his next words burst out unthinkingly, loud and sharp as he said, “Well, it’s not like anyone would hire me anyways, what with my track record and all.”
Bob chose that moment to return, dragging along a simply enormous bag of pellets. For some reason he wasn’t using his wand, even though it was right there tucked behind one ear, and he grunted as he hefted the bag onto the counter.
Draco crouched down next to him. The robes came all the way to the floor and it was the perfect hiding place for a mischievous little boy. Well, the boy was about to learn that if you played hide-and-seek with a Slytherin, you were bound to lose.
! Mind you it was stamping its paws and looking like it wanted to make us its dinner.” He made the smoke hippogriff also stamp around in agitation. “Of course in the end it was Potter that went up to the beast and managed to pet it and after that he even went for a ride on it!” He conjured up a smoke Potter and made it get on the hippogriff before he sent them both whizzing about the room. The children cheered in delight.
“So rude, Pans,” Blaise said pleasantly. “And to your host no less! What would you be doing if I hadn’t offered you a place to hide out in?”
“We did,” she conceded with an exasperated look. “We got together after the War but that didn’t even last a month. Harry’s gay, you twit.”
when you look at it,” Draco continued, sneaking a glance at Potter who was staring at him with his mouth slightly hanging open. “And I feel like owe it to those scorched off, as much as to you, to do something about it. I can even add you to the tapestry through Sirius.”
Potter gasped, completely covered in meat filling and bits of crust. “Fucking hell, Draco, what did I do?”
Draco sent a smug look over to Potter and the other man made a sound almost like a growl. “I think it’s time we headed down anyways.” he said tersely, levelling his broom towards the ground whilst staying in the perfect position to catch Teddy should he fall.
“Couldn’t Potter just buy you another one?” Draco helped himself to a tin of polisher, spreading it along his handle with a soft brush. “You should ask for a newer model.”
There was a beat of silence and finding nothing else to say, Draco turned to leave. “Goodnight then, Potter.”
He thought it prudent to immediately get away before someone else had a go at him, but no sooner had the thought crossed his mind than he found himself sopping wet.
“Dwaco.” Lily said in a pleased voice, rubbing her cheek against his own as if she were a nuzzling kitten.
There was a commotion in the hallway and suddenly the room was teeming with Mediwizards. Draco flattened himself against the wall, trying to make himself as unobtrusive as possible and watched as they quickly took over the spellcasting and eased Potter on to a magical stretcher. They took him out the door and Aunt Dromeda followed worriedly, deep in discussion with one of the Mediwizards. A lone witch remained and she hunched over the book, muttering feverishly – most probably a Curse-Breaker at work.
“Anyways,” Potter continued brightly, quite obviously changing the subject. “Tell us what you did today at the shop.”
“I don’t know what you just said but I think I should be offended,” Ginny huffed and sharply smacked Potter on the head.
“I don’t know!” Weasley yelled back, arms waving wildly and face still doing a worthy impression of a tomato. “I walk in and you’re yelling at ‘Mione about privacy and knocking, and you’re all bundled up like you’re naked. What’s a bloke to think?”
Draco sighed before turning to his husband who had a similar expression of weariness. “Were we honestly counting the days for the term to end? I already want to send them back.”
Pansy’s lips curled back at the mention of Daphne. “Bitch,” she spat. “I heard she’s having a wonderful time in the dungeons. The only eighth year Slytherin female to return.”
“I no longer call you that anymore so stop fussing,” Draco admonished. “Anyways, let’s see. Well, there’s joke shop Weasley, Gringott’s Weasley and stick-up-his-arse Weasley.”
Harry tries to stay mad at Draco for the pumpkin incident, but it’s pretty hard when your boyfriend employs the basest of means to get back into Harry’s good graces. That is to say, Draco alternates between putting a puppy to shame with acts of cuteness which he
“Such behaviour is to be expected,” she continued. “People aren’t likely to forgive and forget so easily, and the War is still fresh in all our minds. Stop giving me that look, Draco.”
“Merlin no, of course not! It’s just, have you been with another boy before?” There was genuine curiosity in his voice.
“Oh and Malfoy?” Potter said quietly as they walked to the nearest apparition point. “I saw you cry.”
“If he has any taste whatsoever, he’ll like what he sees.” the mirror shot back with a knowing smirk.
Everyone eyed everyone else. Well, except for Potter. He had his eyes locked on the back of Ginny’s head and Draco wouldn’t have been surprised if a hatchet materialised out of thin air to lodge itself there.
Draco smirked. “Are you trying to tempt me into insulting the Weasel because that’s a game I’m sure to win.”
A strangled sound came out of Draco at George’s outrageous remark and Charlie laughed even harder, bending over and clutching at his flat stomach. Bill gave them both hard thumps to the head.
The party was to be held in a spacious parlour and they’d already put up most of the decorations and arranged the furniture. All that was left was to blow up the balloons and hang up some more streamers. Potter directed Draco to sit down on one of the couches and picked up one of the many small packets that he’d left there, ripping it open and subsequently scattering balloons all over their laps. Draco picked a blue one and regarded it with a tilt of his head, rubbing it between his fingers. Potter had wanted to use Muggle balloons and it was the first time Draco was dealing with them. The material felt rubbery and quite solid as opposed to the Wizarding ones which were pretty soft.
Draco’s responding hum sounds strangely muffled and Harry’s frown deepens. He finally places his hands on Draco’s to stop the massage and turns around.
“I know that feeling.” Draco said softly and Potter wisely didn’t say anymore. Eventually after ten more minutes of walking, they came to what looked like a staircase going underground. Draco followed Potter downwards, and they came to a row of small gates which Potter opened using a small card.
“Shite, Harry, I didn’t mean to–” The sound of Draco’s voice is like a balm to Harry’s frazzled nerves and he opens his eyes just in time to see the greasy visage of Snape melt away to reveal a concerned looking Draco, biting his lip in that way he does when he’s feeling particularly guilty about something.
Draco offered him a smirk. “When we walk into that room, prepare for the interrogation of your life.”
James shot Draco an unsure look but still turned to follow his cousins. Draco raised his voice. “I suppose you don’t want to know about the time I was attacked by a ferocious, mad Hippogriff?”
She waved her hand impatiently. “Didn’t Luna tell you? Mr Potter has been divorced for a little over a year already. He’s a free man.”
found something noticeably different in Bob’s accent. If it hadn’t been for Bob’s perpetually happy tone, he might have even found it to be moderately attractive. “I suppose I did,” he acknowledged, and then gave Potter a searching sideways glance. “And why exactly do you know so much about dear Bob?”
The child regarded him with a thoughtful expression. “You look like her.” he said cryptically. “I’m Teddy Lupin.”
“Okay so, after the War, the public weren’t very accepting of us Malfoys.” Draco gave a bitter laugh. “It was expected so I wasn’t too concerned about it all. When I came back to Hogwarts for my eighth year, the only other Slytherin who came back was Greg. I think he only came back for me actually. It was strange not having Vince with us, and Greg seemed lost without his friend. He left after the first week of school. Said he couldn’t do it and that he was sorry. I didn’t try to stop him and we sort of lost touch after that, though we still
“Well, you shouldn’t,” Draco shot back snappily, the careless statement instantly souring his mood. “Ginny is a lovely girl, one of the most amazing people I have ever met, and you are
“I trust you,” Harry says simply, doing as told and turning his back to Dean. “Now buck up before Draco gets back.”
Draco sent her a grateful look, not missing the compassion in her eyes. She probably didn’t know what had gone down between him and Harry, but she was a smart witch and anyone who’d been in the room must have felt the weird energy crackling between them. This was her way of allowing him some time to regain his composure and he was humbled by her help. First Harry, then Ginevra, Molly and now Granger – they treated him with kindness even after all he’d done.
“Fred, stop pulling your sister’s hair! Louis, you cannot drip paint all over Molly’s dress! Teddy, get Hugo away from the window this instant! Good god James, what are you doing to Lily’s face?!”
“I can’t!” he yelled back. “I can’t cast a bloody Patronus!” He clenched his fist, feeling utterly useless. “I’m not– I can never–” Potter gave a particularly wretched whimper and Draco gagged. At this rate, he was going to sick up right here in the library.
“I’ve left a hangover potion for you downstairs.” his mother continued and then swept out with a flourish.
. To make matters worse, Draco wasn’t even drawn to Potter on a solely physical level; he’d begun to miss his company
“Look at that, Draco Malfoy is a softie deep down,” another voice quipped behind him and he turned to see Ginny approaching with Potter, his arm possessively around her shoulders. Draco managed to smile, even while his stomach squirmed in a strange mix of jealousy and guilt.
Draco found himself flushing as he looked down at his own jeans and the light blue button down he’d worn over them. “You said to wear casually didn’t you?” he said defensively. “And of course I didn’t have to go shopping. I do wear Muggle clothes Potter, have for years now.”
“Potter, the thing was growling and practically foaming at the mouth. What about that, gives the impression of friendliness?”
About fifteen minutes into his walk Draco came to a halt, suddenly feeling as if he was no longer alone. He was now walking in a more woodsy area, and the trees and shrubs cast shadows all around him. He listened and sure enough he heard a rustling in the bushes, the sound coming closer and closer. Draco felt a rush of panic shoot through him. What if it was some wild beast that would surely make a meal of his succulent form? Or worse, what if it was a wizard, possibly on the run from the law – a murdering psychopath perhaps? The rustling got louder and Draco finally had the sense to reach for his wand and why the bloody hell had he kept it in his robe pocket? He struggled to get it out and just as it seemed to come untangled, a small form came rushing out of the bushes.
The little girl gave a sniff but nodded her head. “Good. Then I promise to come visit you as soon as I can.” Behind his back, Draco crossed his fingers, knowing that it was juvenile but he really did feel guilty as he saw the little faces light up at the idea of him visiting. So he’d stooped so low that he was lying to toddlers now.
“I had a Burning Hex shot at me today,” Draco added before he could stop himself, the words leaving him in a rush. “I ducked out of the way, but it left a crater in the stone wall behind me.”
The owl obligingly withdrew his attack and perched on the back of Draco’s garden chair, still giving Potter dirty looks, and Potter watched him warily as he finally got off Draco and onto his feet, wands still clutched in his hand. When he seemed to deem it safe to look away, he turned his attention back to Draco, and after only a brief moment of hesitation, held out a hand for him to take.
“That’s it,” he said to himself. “I’m done. I can’t do this anymore.” Was this the punishment he was finally receiving for all the fucked up things he’d done in his youth? Well, consider himself punished.
“Mother, how could you not tell me any of this?” Draco demanded angrily, although most of the anger was directed at himself. He should have known what was happening. He should have been there to protect her.
She didn’t say anything more at the moment but also didn’t let go of his arm. It was Luna’s way of telling him that she wouldn’t pry whilst also letting him know that she was here for him always. It was one of the things he loved the most about her. How she always knew exactly what to do. She never asked too many questions or said too much but just gave you what you needed at the moment.
“I humbly accept your invitation Potter.” Draco said with the most dazzling smile he could muster. It must have worked too because Potter looked taken aback for a moment.
Draco sighed, leaning into the touch. He wasn’t sure how to tell them about his dilemma. It was just so complicated and the concerned looks they were giving him weren’t making matters easier.
“Oh yes. It would be best if you didn’t go commando today.” Luna said seriously. “The jeans may be a tad bit tight and I’m not sure if you’d want the shape of your nether region to be visible.”
Draco would have stepped in then, but Narcissa suddenly looked his way and sent him a sharp look. She obviously wanted to handle this without any assistance, and all he could do was give a stiff nod and remain where he was, nothing more than another unhelpful spectator in the crowd.
“Potter,” Draco enunciated slowly, rubbing at the bridge of his nose tiredly, “I’ve spent the better half of the morning on my feet and would very much like to go home now, so perhaps you could cut to the chase and tell me if there is a point to all this. Honestly,
“Those people shouldn’t have treated you like that,” Potter continued, dark eyebrows pinching together as he looked at Draco earnestly, and
letting go. “I’ll just get you some supplies for him then; it’s a male by the way. Oh, and I’m not charging you. Even though Little Owls are usually quite rare and therefore expensive, you were wonderful enough to want him in the first place and for that, I will give him to you free.” He hurried into the back room again.
”, too busy shoving off his seat with a snarl. Instead of breaking the bastard’s nose again, as he was sorely tempted to do, Draco swept out of the kitchen, barely keeping his anger in check.
Of course his hopes were quickly crushed when Potter continued. “We should ask Andromeda and your mum to join us. I’d love to see Narcissa Malfoy in Muggle London.”
“I think you can truthfully tell your mother that I am indeed ‘stuffed’. I think I even have a belly bulge!” He scrutinized his stomach thoughtfully. “I’ve never had one before.”
Draco wasn’t sure he wanted to meet any of her brothers but he nodded nonetheless. The back door opened and Molly came out, levitating an enormous tray that she placed between the two of them. It was piled high with all kind of buns, slices of crisp toast, eggs, bacon, slices of cured meat, a platoon of small pies, a bowl of salad and a large plate of fruit tarts.
“Not to forget, even if it doesn’t work out, at least you’ll get some good shags out of it first,” Blaise added dreamily. “Potter’s hot as fuck.”
“Let’s just go back. I want to see if anyone survives the film.” Harry walks back to the living room with Draco close behind.
“You’ve quite charmed all the Weasley women.” George continued, casually leaning against the wall. “I think my daughter’s already planning to marry you.”
than the actual time just in case,” Ginny groaned in exasperation. “Whatever, we can still pick teams until he gets here. If he has a problem with that, it’ll be his own fault. Hermione, are you playing?”
“We wouldn’t even be in this situation if it wasn’t for you and your bloody tricks,” Harry snaps back. “And seriously, what in the world possessed you to create
“Draco, you are the stupidest smart person I’ve ever met.” She sounded completely fed up. “Honestly, just
“I think it’s best if I leave.” Draco said instead. He needed time to sort out what had just happened between them. This changed everything.
Before Draco could respond, his bedroom door banged open and he jumped, almost smacking his head on the grate.
“Well, I believe the picture speaks for itself.” Draco replied with a smirk. Whoever had taken the picture had done a bang up job indeed. It clearly depicted a chocolate ice cream covered Draco laughing as his vanilla missile hit Potter squarely on the nose, splattering onto his glasses, while Al laughed in the background. The thing that Draco loved the most about the photo was the fact that Potter’s irritated frown morphed into a brilliant smile and the beginnings of a laugh could be seen right before the photo panned back to the beginning.
Narcissa’s eyes narrowed dangerously. “And what, may I ask, would you have done if I had told you? We are no longer under house arrest, and yet you still insist on living like a recluse. If I hadn’t managed to coax you out today, you would still be holed up in your rooms.”
Lily smacked him smartly on the head with her hand. “Stop bothering them. Just because Alyssa Smith won’t give you the time of day doesn’t mean you have to whinge at anyone who has a successful love life.”
His business with Potter done now, Bob finally turned his attention back onto Draco, but when he caught sight of the cage with the tiny owl in it, he froze and stared at in unblinkingly. Draco shot Potter a questioning look but he only shrugged before making a discreet gesture that expressed his opinion that the shopkeeper was not all there. Bob looked up with an expression of worship and much to Draco’s unease, his eyes were brimming with tears.
“Fucking hell, Draco, this is a fine mess you’ve gotten yourself into,” Blaise groaned. “If the groping is anything to go by, Potter obviously has a certain fondness for your arse.”
Potter startled violently from where he was standing by the fireplace and opened his mouth to respond before abruptly shutting it with an audible snap, his eyes widening. For a few uncomfortable moments, all he did was stare openly, and Draco wrapped his arms around himself self-consciously. He was keenly aware of the fact that his shirt was so thin it was practically translucent and so big that even now, it had slid halfway off one shoulder and threatened to fall off completely. At least he was wearing cotton trousers instead of shorts for once – small comforts but he’d take them. He wondered what he looked like to Potter. Probably like some washed-up street urchin.
“You think you can take such liberties as touching me whenever you please, Potter?” Draco continued relentlessly.
Draco’s eyes widened, finally understanding where this was going. “I said I’d go see him. Right now was not implied.”
his mother and aunt – and it had quickly become their place in Muggle London. They always stopped by to get a bag of their chocolate brownies on the way to pick up the children.
Before he even knew it, a week had gone by and he’d spent every day in the company of Ginny Weasley. What made the whole thing so surreal was how
“James, Albus!” Another familiar voice cut through the air and Draco caught a glimpse of a dark head making its way through the crowd, a tiny red head firmly on his shoulders. Great, more Potters.
“I assure you he did. It was the talk of the dungeons all of sixth year. Even I heard about it and as you of all people know, I was a little distracted that year.”
“Whatever,” Draco muttered in defeat, snatching his hand back and staring down blankly at his wand. He couldn’t say that he cared for Potter and his strange mood swings; let him do as he pleased as long as he left Draco alone. Not everything was about him after all.
Draco turned but instead of Harry, he found himself face to face with Ginny Weasley. Lily was in her arms and Draco was struck by how she really was the spitting image of her mother. Ginevra’s eyes were fixed sternly on her sons, but they suddenly shot to him as if only then realizing who was with them.
“It was the same with Mum. I never noticed just how worried she was until after the War was over. For one thing, she doesn’t glance at the clock every five minutes anymore.”
“So, Draco, you single?” Charlie casually asked next and George snickered again, tightening his hold on Draco as if he expected him to keel over – which, truth be told, was beginning to be a very real possibility.
Draco hardly registered her command, his eyes locked on Potter. Would his younger self have been pleased to see him thus fallen? Suddenly Lucius’s voice was in his head, crowing over the fact that he managed to cast a Cruciatus Curse on the great Harry Potter. Had Potter cried like this back then too?
Weasley scrunched his brow. “You’ll probably finish tomorrow, right? But tomorrow’s the party so we can’t celebrate like this. Think of it as a compromise.”
She pursed her lips and eyed him with concern. “I won’t disturb you long then. The post came while you were out and I brought it up for you.” She placed a small stack of letters on his bedside table. “Goodnight, my darling.”
The two witches began to move towards the shop, still chattering away to each other and Draco was left behind with the Weaslette. She looked completely unsurprised by the truly shocking turn of events.
Many would have found their friendship to be shocking and surreal at best. After all, Luna had once been held prisoner in his family dungeons and that was a good enough reason for her to hate him for eternity. So when he’d come across her by the Lake, somewhere in the October of his eighth year, Draco had blurted out an apology and then closed his eyes, waiting for the harsh words that were sure to follow. Instead, he’d felt a gentle pressure on his arm and opened his eyes to find Luna smiling beside him, her small hand holding his arm. That simple exchange, before she walked away had left him warm for the first time since the War had ended. After that, it had been only a matter of time before he held a special place his heart for the whimsical girl, whose ideas were more to the side of mad, and whose nature was sweeter than anyone he’d ever known.
Potter scratched the back of his head sheepishly. “I know, I know. It’s just so nice to be able to do magic again, alright? And I’m still too weak to stop using this bloody cane so allow me this much at least.”
“Your mum’s pretty different from how I expected,” Ginny spoke up, and Draco opened his eyes to see her nodding towards the inside of the cottage. “I used to think she didn’t know how to smile, let alone laugh.”
He emerged in his mother’s sitting room and was pleased to find her already seated in her favourite armchair, busily browsing through a stack of letters. She looked up with a smile and he made sure to dust himself off in the grate before approaching her.
Potter looked torn and suddenly leant in to give him another kiss. Unlike the previous one, this was gentle and sweet. It didn’t last long, but it had Draco trembling when they pulled away.
“Potter, surely you should know not to question the inner workings of Ginevra Weasley by now,” Draco admonished lightly. “Her mind is a terrifying place, I warrant.”
He shifted uncertainly, looking both nervous and hopeful at the same time, and Draco didn’t know what to make of it. He supposed he should be delighted that Potter was trying to patch things up with her. If all went well, Draco wouldn’t have to speak to anyone after all. He would simply tuck his feelings away to never be touched upon again. There was a reason he’d always excelled at Occlumency; he’d always been good at compartmentalising his emotions. Aunt Bella had called him cold, and maybe she’d been right all along.
“It wasn’t anything important,” Draco replied quickly, shrugging. “I can’t even remember what it was now.”
Potter looked so vulnerable at the moment and Draco suddenly realized with a jolt that even though he was the Saviour of the Wizarding world, Potter was also just a man. A man who like him had had his life already planned out for him, before he was old enough to even walk, and who wanted to just be himself for once – no expectations. It somehow made him more
Draco blinked, the anger dissipating in a matter of seconds. “Well, I believe Potter and I just had an argument.”
Ginny stared for a moment before closing her eyes with a pained expression. “Trying to understand your thought processes is giving me a headache.”
When Draco lifted his gaze, it was with a jolt that he remembered Ginny. She was looking at Fred’s hand with a sad little smile gracing her face, pained brown eyes glistening brightly. Draco swallowed and then looked back at the clock, wondering at the pain the family must feel every time they looked at the clock and its ever-present reminder.
“It’s not funny.” Potter said to Draco petulantly. “Next time I’ll make you wash them and then we’ll see who’s laughing.
“Come on, can’t you just admit that I knew something you didn’t?” Draco cajoled recklessly, even though he knew he was this close to making Potter lose his temper.
“So let me get this straight,” Draco needed to be certain, “All that rigmarole was you trying to ask me if I’d been harassed during my shopping spree?”
Potter gave him an incredulous look. “Well, for starters, you went from standing completely still to spilling your tea down your front. Then you started screaming at
The movie begins a few minutes later and Harry is soon clinging onto Draco as tightly as Draco is clinging onto him. He hasn’t expected the movie to actually scare him, but bloody hell is it creepy. He’s surprised Draco hasn’t begged him to turn it off yet, considering he can’t seem to stop shaking.
as Harry tackles them onto the ground. Harry lets out a practically animalistic growl as he tugs his invisibility cloak away to reveal Draco’s grinning face, just barely resisting the urge to throttle him.
Instead, he gave Potter an apologetic look and said, “I think it might be better if I went home. Please, don’t try to contact me.”
Draco cursed his pale skin as he erupted into a fiery blush. “If you are finished insulting me, I’ll take my leave now. See you on Monday, Potter. Goodnight all.”
“It’s so nice to meet a friend of Harry’s.” she continued. “Did you also go to that mysterious boarding school of his?”
Potter looked sheepish for a moment before apparently returning to his element and glaring. “No one has heard word of you for the past ten years! Did you expect me not to be even the slightest surprised to see you now?”
agreed to this. A game of Quidditch was one thing, but actual conversation? It was next to impossible when every other word that came out of his mouth reminded everyone of what he’d once been – of what he’d
To his surprise, she gave an unladylike scoff. “My dear child, you would have to be married to Lucius Malfoy to understand what real drama is.”
“Might I point out that I’m deeply offended by your poor regard for me,” George interjected in an injured voice.
Harry followed his gaze and gave his hand a light squeeze. “I still remember that moment when we got home after our honeymoon,” he said, voice faintly teasing as Draco tried his utmost not to blush and then failed spectacularly. He remembered that moment all too well.
“I’m not really one for accepting big expensive gifts usually,” Ginny replied with a wry look, snipping away at her broom. “But Harry was adamant I accept this, so I did. It’s to ‘make up’ for not getting me a birthday present last year.” She rolled her eyes. “Because
“Yes. Dangerous,” Ginny echoed fervently, nodding her head. “Don’t want to die just yet. And besides, I have… something to do tomorrow.”
to him for one thing and had even trusted him with her daughter. To his surprise he realized that given time, he could one day see himself calling her a friend.
Harry was taking in the scene with an unreadable expression, eyes softening when he looked at the children but when they looked at him… Draco took an involuntary step back at the purpose in those eyes. Salazar save him, Harry wanted to
I was expecting one with the War going on and all. My gift to him that year wasn’t something to crow about either, more’s the pity.”
Draco found it difficult to hold back a ridiculous smile, absurdly pleased by everything Potter had said. When he’d been younger, he’d strived to emulate his father to no end, finding it flattering when people compared them favourably. But as he’d grown older and started to see Lucius for what he truly was, the comparison had grown stale.
Draco stared aghast. “You bastard! You actually think that?” He moved his shoulder back and sent the tail of his broom smacking into the side of Potter’s head.
Draco didn’t say anything but after a while he looked up to find Potter regarding him nervously, worrying his bottom lip with his teeth, and generally looking completely pathetic. Draco sighed. Salazar, he was getting soft.
Potter murmured something he couldn’t quite catch and then shuffled between positions, until he got comfortable. Draco’s breath hitched as Potter settled on his side, facing towards him. His cheek lay warm on his thigh and he could feel Potter’s slow breaths through the thin shirt he wore. Draco exhaled shakily.
“We’d like that, yes.” he said smoothly, giving Draco’s hand a warning squeeze. Draco didn’t say anything and after buying the tickets, Potter finally let go of his hand. They made their way inside and then only did Draco round on him.
After a moment of deliberation, Ginevra’s brow smoothed out and she visibly relaxed. “The children have told me a lot about you.” she said. “Harry too.”
“So tell me Potter,” Draco began, but the Gryffindor was just staring with an odd expression on his face and didn’t appear to be listening. “Potter?”
! He heard Ginny give a loud whoop, and the rest of the game seemed to freeze as they watched the two Seekers hurtling towards the Snitch.
“Alright, fine, I suppose that’s a bit drastic. Even I’m not cruel enough to send you back to Bob. Though the ‘plucked and roasted’ threat still remains as long as you stay on my pillow. You’ve already shat on my seventh favourite pair of boots and now I’ll have to send them to be cleaned.”
Making his way down to the kitchen, Draco finally felt some of the tension leaving his shoulders. It had been more discomforting than he’d thought, seeing Potter with Ginny, and to his great shame, he’d been rather cold to her as he tried to mask his jealous feelings. He’d noticed her giving him worried glances all night and it made him feel like the worst of bastards.
Draco could have just stood there and gone on baiting Potter but it was late and he was tired and all he really wanted to do was go home and sleep. Not to mention he really shouldn’t have been antagonizing Ginny’s boyfriend in the first place. So he pushed back the biting response that threatened to spill out and took a fortifying breath.
“Well, it needs repeating. You’ve been gone far too long.” she chided gently as they walked out onto her veranda.
“Lily was the result of too much alcohol coupled with some fumbling in the dark that both of us couldn’t even remember the next day.” he said with a face devoid of emotion. “I’m grateful it gave me my little angel in the end, but that doesn’t make it something I’m proud of.”
Harry does just that, seating himself comfortably down on the porch and leaning back on his hands. It’s dusk now and the sun has begun to set, casting everything in a soft, muted light. Harry watches a couple of children pass by on bikes and smiles as he wonders if he can persuade Draco to get on one. The front door opens and closes quietly, and Harry’s about to voice his thoughts, when hands land on his shoulders and begin to knead them in firm, strong strokes.
“I’m just going to say it.” Potter mopped up his spilt stew with a dry little smile. “This is bloody awkward.”
Narcissa hummed, taking a sip of rose tea before she continued, “I received a letter from Molly when I was out in the garden. She’s invited us both for brunch tomorrow morning and I accepted the invitation.”
“So you’re still having trouble with that wand,” he began haltingly and Draco rolled his eyes. Could Potter do nothing else but constantly state the obvious? He was starting to seriously question his taste in men.
“Oh.” Draco had never met his cousin, but he remembered Aunt Dromeda mentioning that he’d been very close to Potter when he’d been alive. “I suppose he and Mother must have gotten their eyes from their fathers then. Grandfather and my great-uncle were known for looking startlingly alike.”
Pansy stroked her boyfriend’s shoulder, nodding with that signature Cheshire cat grin of hers. “It’s only Draco we’re talking about here. And we all know how accommodating he is.”
Once this whole debacle was over, Harry wasn’t ever going to step foot in another karaoke bar. Well at least for another month.
“What is your damn middle name anyway? No, no, it doesn’t matter, and I don’t care! Just get your ruddy arse down from there right now. We need to speak. Now!”
Harry immediately imagined what his defense line could be if Malfoy ever discovered this and decided to throttle him for it.
Harry grit his teeth, wanting nothing more than to grab his wand. Too bad he left the bloody thing at home.
Instead, he glanced around the classroom yet again, eyeing his classmates with boredom, and rolling his eyes good-naturedly at Pansy cutting her cuticles a few tables over from him and Blaise clearly staring off into space thinking about Merlin knows what.
He rather hoped to Merlin and back that Smith wasn’t the mysterious song sender, especially with the way he was currently chewing open-mouthed all over their blasted table.
Harry closed his eyes and took a deep breath in and out, and again. He tried to blame his morose feelings on the holidays, but he knew himself better than that.
“Harry…” Hermione proceeded cautiously, her eyes knowing, and her brows raised in anticipation of whatever he would do next.
Harry’s attention drifted back to Justin, and his eyebrows rose of their own accord as he glanced at Draco, who only had eyes for his glass of Cabernet in his hand. Harry forced a grin on his face, and he hated that it didn’t come more comfortably for him. “Good things, I hope?”
Another week went by, and Harry finally did manage to crack open the hellish history book Hermione had been forcing down his throat, reading through a chunk of it before falling asleep in Malfoy’s chair during one of their meet-ups for the potions assignment.
His hand never stopped pulling on his cock, even though he was silently having a mental breakdown. He only took a break to restart the song, put it on a loop, and turn it up. His erection wasn’t having the same issues, as it spouted out more precome.
“Oh, for Salazar’s sake, Potter.” Harry’s grin encapsulated his whole face then, as he leaned in for a second kiss, with the sounds of cheering from the fire pit as their background noise to ring in a new day.
Then he recognized a perfectly posh voice from above him as he emptied his body on the sand below him.
Harry sank into the water to his shoulders, observing the other man. “You must not know me well at all then.”
Harry then clenched tightly around Draco’s cock inside him, and he could imagine him groaning in the back of his throat like he always does when he’s too tight. He deserves it, at the very least.
“Out of everyone in the Mysteries Department, you deserve some time for yourself. I can’t remember a time in the past four years you’ve taken for yourself if I remember correctly.”
He felt Harry’s glare from where he laid on the bed and looked down at him with an unperplexed expression.
“He - he didn’t - he wasn’t good. He wasn’t a fair dom.” Potter kept his gaze to the dark sky ahead, and Draco walked up closer to him, their arms brushing against the other.
Draco reached a hand down to himself, massaging his cock to relieve some pressure, as he continued his path down Potter’s body, kissing the scars lingering on his skin before finally reaching his erection and lifting his head to get a better look.
He spread his thighs as much as his trousers allowed him as the first wave of orgasm hit him in a surprise. Harry let out a low groan as spunk pulsed over his fingers, spurting up and hitting the wall.
“Erm, it seems the mistletoe has gone elsewhere,” a voice came from behind Draco, and it sounded a lot like his boyfriend.
that he had never mentioned before to Harry. Only the standard thank you occurred, not even a blush to his cheeks or stammering of questioning after the fact as he stuffed it back into the box, surely to use at a later date.
Harry drew in a deep breath, his hands twitching at his sides. He did feel quite a bit of pent up energy still from the mission, perhaps if he just...tried it out…
A few more moments passed when the fireplace lit up in green flames, signaling the start of the meeting, and Harry knelt forward on his knees and popped his head in through to the other side.
Harry glanced at the good looking man and noted his name was Iain by his name-tag. “Er, yes. Sorry, I was just taking in my fill of the view.”
Potter leaned in the rest of the way and caught Draco’s open mouth with his own, a moan escaping his mouth as soon as they met as if on reflex.
Harry still watched him with an air of distrust. “Oh? What is so special about this place? Did you somehow figure out I was staying here so you could watch me from afar?”
Too many nights of Harry going home early from a workday and getting comfortable on the couch, his favorite take out on the table and a lager in his hand.
Draco’s dropped his gaze further, almost reluctantly, but was quickly rewarded by the sight of Potter’s toned legs, which were tied securely by black ropes and wrapped all the way around his thighs, crisscrossing beautifully over his tanned skin.
Finally unpacking a bit (or at least, throwing his luggage somewhere on the floor), Harry lay on his bed and finally felt as though he could breathe in a full breath of air for the first time in months.
Harry knew she was trying to stay positive, but even her optimism was beginning to wilt under the onslaught of flying Christmas decor.
Harry imagined bucking backward into the feeling, sitting on his face and forcing him to go even deeper as a punishment for eating him out in front of his bloody boss. He felt more sweat run down his face from holding back, and eventually, he felt the upper half of his body sag, defeated in knowing Draco had him right where he wanted.
Harry went ahead and paid for his drinks; there was no way in hell he was staying here. He figured he could make his excuses to go to the loo once his “date” got back and scram from there.
“Keeping tabs on me, are we Potter? Didn’t know you cared so much.” Draco said with a sly smile, feeling absurdly pleased when Potter’s cheeks bloomed pink.
Draco closed his eyes. His mother was one of the most dreadful matchmakers he’d ever known and she was relentless in her pursuits. He suddenly had a bad feeling about this visit.
Draco wished he had Potter’s confidence. Yet another thing currently stressing him out would have to be Teddy’s first birthday party, a mere day from now. He, Potter, and Weasley had taken over the operation, assuring his mother and aunt that they could handle it, and up until now everything
, he stooped down and picked up the Weaslette’s fallen bags, handing them to her with a muttered apology.
“Tell us, Draco,” Pansy murmured, moving up to pull him into a loose hug, her fingers carding gently through his hair. He closed his eyes for a moment, savouring the comfort of having her with him again. He’d never admit it, but when she and Blaise had left, it’d been like losing a piece of himself.
“Yeah, I did.” Draco tucked the wand back into his pocket. “I er…didn’t expect you to send it back.” he said haltingly.
“Can’t you just call him ‘Father’ like the rest of us?” Al asked with a roll of his eyes. “We aren’t little kids anymore.”
Instead of lying still and allowing himself to be bashed into the ground like a ragdoll, Potter immediately sprang into motion, and Draco had to hastily seat himself on his midsection in the hopes of holding him down. Unfortunately for Draco, it turned out that Potter was
“It’s fine,” Draco said, pulling out his wand and releasing Potter from his bonds. “Better, Potter?”
Draco held Luna close, snuggling his head into the crook of her neck as he let the familiar scent of rose water wash over him. He sighed, and then hid a smile in her hair as her phoenix feather earring tickled his cheek. It felt good to hold her like this again. When he finally let go he was sure he had a sappy grin on his face, but as always Draco knew that with Luna he could let down his mask with no hesitation. The petite witch got on her toes in an attempt to kiss his forehead but even so he still had to bend down for her to reach. She gave him a loud smack and patted his hair gently, a wistful smile on her face.
“Anyways,” Potter continued. “With the help of my house elf, Kreacher, I’ve managed to spruce the place up a bit, redecorating the rooms and throwing away some of the more...
Draco threw his arms around Potter and pulled him into a tight hug, unable to stop himself and not wanting to either. “Thank you,” he breathed into the side of his head, nuzzling into the thick, soft hair. “I feel whole again.”
Draco couldn’t help smiling at that. “Yes, my name is Draco.” he said as he bounced her lightly, resulting in more giggles. She really was a sweet little thing and seemed to have some sort of fascination with his hair, now lightly petting it as if it were a kneazle. He’d never held such a tiny person in his arms before, but he’d quickly found out that the minute he put her down, she’d try to clamber onto his head.
“Wait!” Teddy sprang forward and grabbed him before he could make the turn. “You should come over tomorrow for lunch. To Gran’s place I mean. Harry is coming too.” He stared up beseechingly. “Please?” Draco looked over at Potter and saw that he was smiling now.
“Just so you know,” Harry had a face of utter seriousness, though his eyes glittered mischievously. “Ginny’s getting married to Neville, not me.”
fitter than the other two, his muscular physique clearly outlined through the tight t-shirt he wore.
“Draco dear, I was just telling Fleur about your old French tutor.” his mother said when she saw him. “Apparently she is one of her distant aunts.”
The crowd tensed up as they seemed to come to the realization that Draco was now armed, and the snotty schoolboy looked ready to wet himself. Although sorely tempted to hit the brat with a strong Furnunculus, Draco restrained himself and merely cast a Drying Charm on himself before striding away.
Potter told Draco to go on ahead with the children while he paid the driver, so he led them into the large park.
It was like being doused with cold water. Draco jerked back sharply, and one of his arms knocked onto the carousel. It fell onto its side with a loud crash and suddenly began to turn, sweet, old-fashioned music emanating from it. Potter gave a delighted exclamation.
Narcissa continued to glare icily at him and he met it with one of his own. A cleared throat finally broke the tension between them, and they both turned to see that despite it being obvious that they were having a private conversation over here, Mrs Weasley had
“I’m beginning to wonder if you know what ‘safe’ even means.” Draco shot back, wincing as the taxi narrowly missed a collision with a bus. “I am never taking a taxi again in my life, and I advise you to at least keep the children at home if you ever feel the need to take one again. Merlin, I think even the Knight bus is safer than this!”
“It was nothing.” Potter replied, rubbing the back of his neck sheepishly. “Sorry you had to have mac n’ cheese like the kids.”
Draco stood up and stretched luxuriously, sighing as his back popped in a satisfying way. “I don’t need a new broom to beat you,” he said, adopting his old, haughty drawl. “I’ll take the old one and you’ll still be eating my tail bristles.”
“Surrendering on you own terms to prevent a humiliating loss? How very Slytherin of you Potter.” Draco said with a tilt of his head. “Didn’t know you had it in you.”
He and his mother stayed for dinner, which his aunt ordered from a Muggle restaurant nearby. Draco had eaten curry before when he’d been in India, but it was his mother’s first time having it. She instantly loved it and Draco had a feeling the house elves would soon be learning how to make it.
“Unlike you, I know how to get them to behave.” Draco replied smugly, even as he felt a thrill go through him at the mention of a ‘next time’.
“Did someone say ‘dragon’?” an unfamiliar voice spoke up and Draco turned to see another redhead approaching. This one was only an inch or two taller than him – as opposed to Bill and George who fairly towered over him – but made up for it by being
“Yeah, yeah,” Draco muttered, giving the book a half-arsed glance before turning back to his work. “It’s all yours.”
He was about to call out to the fallen hero in his best placating tone when the children suddenly sprang up from his arms, rushing towards Potter in a way that would surely spook him and result in a frenzied attack. Just as Draco was about to intervene though, he recognized the excited cries coming out of their mouths.
Lily also came tottering over and held her arms out imperiously. “Up.” she commanded with all the flair of a queen. Draco could do nothing but grin and scoop her up, having grown accustomed to holding her by now. She immediately latched onto his hair and he laughed.
,” Draco amended with a roll of his eyes. “I’ve already gained quite a lot as it is, but I remember you mentioning
Sometimes Ginny would pop by and then they’d take a break to chat with her or go for a quick flight, Disillusionment Charms hiding them from Muggle eyes. Draco found that he’d really missed hanging out with her, and watching the way she and Potter interacted brought into perspective how
Potter swung around in his seat with a wide grin. “Ginny! You didn’t tell me you were coming over today. I thought you were helping out at the shop.”
Draco was just finishing his lunch when the large owl landed beside his plate. It hooted pleasantly and held up a foot with a parchment tied to it. Draco untied it and gave the owl his last bit of rabbit as a treat. It affectionately nipped at his finger before flying away out the window it had come from. Draco unrolled the parchment and then smiled when he saw that it was from Potter.
The children nodded their heads gravely, all except for Teddy who seemed to be trying not to laugh by stuffing his fist in his mouth.
If anything Potter looked even more bemused now. “I did say we’d meet here at half past didn’t I?” he asked. “If my watch is correct, then it’s only a quarter past.”
Draco couldn’t really blame Potter for his scepticism, but that didn’t stop it from hurting. He might not have realised that they were almost finished but he
Pansy’s gaze softened. “I know, Draco, but she’s welcome to come too. Ariana would love to have her. She’s currently between lovers and would enjoy the company.”
“I’ll wait for you,” he told him. “Better to spend as much time with you as I can before you’re no longer a semi-permanent fixture in this house.” Potter laughed ruefully and Draco wanted to hate him for not knowing what statements like that did to Draco’s heart.
“Act natural!” he hissed at the still smiling Bob and then looked around frantically, wondering for a mad second if he could hide. Finally getting a good look at the shop he realised that he’d dashed into Eeylop’s Owl Emporium in his haste to avoid Potter. He wasn’t sure why he was avoiding him in the first place but considering their somewhat unpleasant encounter the night before, he was sure it was for the best.
Draco gave a weak smile. “So I let them go, and haven’t heard from them since. Mother probably hears from Mrs Zabini but she knows not to mention any of it to me.” He blinked. “I’ve said rather a lot, haven’t I?”
“How benevolent of you.” Draco gave a small smile, pleased to find them returning to their earlier dynamic, as if the accident had never occurred. “How do you take your tea?” he asked as he poured a cup for Potter.
In retaliation, Harry clenched even harder around Draco’s hardness, almost pushing him out from the force of it. But his Slytherin boyfriend wasn’t deterred in the slightest, as he grabbed Harry’s hips and pushed back into him, slamming home.
Since the War ended last year, a slow integration with the Muggle world had started trickling through; even some of their past classmates had elected to live in the Muggle world rather than coming back to Hogwarts for their final year.
Harry managed to grimace on behalf of Ron, understanding his frustration. It was as if all the professors felt the need this year to make sure the students were having a ‘normal’ year since the last few weren’t quite what Harry would describe as
His glasses weren't cooperating either and smashed up against his face. But he figured there wasn’t much he could do about that and just ignored them, figuring he could live with the red marks that were probably going to be on his face from them pushing into his cheek.
He pulled down one of his favorite straps and clasped it around him as he eyed the selection of dildos before him.
"Well, it must hate Christmas then. You should see the mangled wreath on my door and let's not even mention what happened to the garland."
“Did you…” Potter’s eyes strayed back to his stained trousers, and Draco could swear he heard him swallow. “Did you...come earlier? In class— when I was watching?” Draco could hear Potter’s nervousness through his speech, and he wanted nothing more than to drag the bastard to his bed, tie him up, and have his wicked way with him.
Even though Harry wasn’t all that mad about it at the time, himself not being all that sober either.  He wasn’t too drunk either, as he could still feel the ghost of Malfoy’s lips from that night.
Harry opened his mouth to argue when Malfoy took a few steps closer; his hand reached out and grabbed the handle of the shower, opening it right up, steam hitting his face and reminded Harry of some Greek God that came to save him from his tragedy currently unfolding.
Potter’s arms were pulled above him parallel to his body, clearly tied by some sort of invisible ropes, same as how his legs were.
At that, he popped the plug out of his mouth and watched as a line of spit followed from Harry's mouth and groaned at the sight.
“If you want to wipe yourself down, you’ve made quite the mess.” Malfoy quirked an eyebrow at him, amusement painting his features. Harry swallowed dryly.
Harry nodded vigorously, face-down in the pillows, with his arse propped up once again, slightly swaying back and forth, and Draco chuckled under his breath, “Of course you are. You’re always ready for me, aren’t you.”
He felt a pang of something ugly in his chest because he couldn’t help but notice there was no sign of Draco anywhere.
Harry felt an enormous wave of relief, as well as annoyance with himself for wasting his time with this lunatic. He would have greatly preferred reading that book Hermione kept harping about rather than sit one more second with Smith.
Harry twitched in his seat as he watched Malfoy sit back down at his booth, grey eyes catching his own for a split second before Harry quickly glanced down at the empty glasses at their table.
“The reason why we have kidnapped you from your lovely lions is for you to understand the impact you have made on our best friend. And trust me when I say, we have tried for
He then grabbed his quill and started up retaking notes to try and convince himself that Draco currently wasn’t curling his fingers in his arsehole, aiming quite accurately at his prostate with every plunge.
Stretching his arms up, he breathed in the salty air and turned back towards the dry sand, heading up to where a bar was located, about 100 feet off the water.
The Sectumsempra scars were visible, barely, through the water, and Harry didn’t think the man could have looked any more delectable at that moment. He leaned in closer, suddenly needing the feel of his hands on him, desperately, when a loud clearing of a throat had him freezing up.
Not that he personally wouldn’t have blamed Potter for wanting to let loose with a couple of good looking blokes, but he was pleased he decided to follow him instead.
“I know it was probably bad timing; what I did tonight, and yelling at him in the Potions classroom…”
Draco had only gotten a glance before he hid from sight earlier, but Potter’s dress robes made Draco want to jump him and drag him from the view of all those Ministry officials, and have his wicked way with him without
“I sent cancellation letters behind Jakob’s back to the rest of the sods he invited. I never had a say in them in the first place, and he didn’t find out about the letters until we got back to our flat that night.”
“Oh, quite splendid Potter. Now, are we going to continue this pointless drivel, or are we going to announce the elephant in the room?”
He imagined how he would feel if he hadn’t had a sunburn, and Malfoy was giving him a full massage, with oil instead of the aloe. He had to swallow back a moan at that thought as he ignored the heat developing further down his body.
