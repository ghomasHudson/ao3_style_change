Even he had to admit, he was proud of that one. He thought back to what Blaise had said a few months ago, 'your insults aren't that funny Draco' he had rudely stated.
She nodded frantically. “Yes, you are. I never said that I would die my hair Hufflepuff purple, that would be atrocious.” She laughed and he whole heartedly agreed, “Anyways, I’m quite partial to Slytherin green.” she told him and his ears immediately perked up.
He sighed. “Well, I think it’s a commendable idea.” He answered and Hermione gave him an angry look.
The Muggleborn's would be the first to go. They were the kind that the Dark Lord saw at the bottom of the social ladder. It didn't matter whether you were innocent or just merely a child. Death Eater's didn't discriminate.
something was terribly wrong. That’s how we knew that you still loved Potter, but somehow, you’d forgotten how you’d fallen in love with him.” Draco didn’t know what to say. How hadn’t he realised his friends had known this, that they’d felt like this?
Draco saw the familiar orange of Weasley’s head as they made it outside the potions classroom. He shot Weasley a nod before crouching down so that he was the same height as Kat.
It wasn’t perfect. It was far from perfect. Potter would call him names, Draco refused to speak to him. It was unexpected, fragile, and scary. But it was also wonderful. Their nights made him feel like everything was okay. That there was no Dark Lord or that he was a Death Eater. No, Potter made him feel like Draco. Just
Potter pulled away from the Weaselette, giving him one last triumphant smirk before returning back to his food.
her.” she whispered again. “For the first time in a long time I had my little girl back. So, thank you. Thank you for giving me back my daughter.” She said in pure gratitude, and it was Draco’s turn to pull the woman closer.
He already knew that he wanted all of Potter. He knew his faults, he knew the things that he had done, and he loved him more because of them. He needed to know that Potter accepted him in his entirety. And this was the only way to do that.
The Weaselette looked like a beauty project gone terribly, terribly wrong. Had no one ever told her that less was more? What did Potter see in her?
Draco felt his eyes well with fresh tears. “But she’ll be safe with me. I know she will be.” He attempted to persuade them, to make them understand.
He turned around to smile at his Hufflepuff’s only to met with nothing. Oh no, where were his Hufflepuff’s? If they weren’t there than that meant Draco was alone, and if Draco was alone…
It was a bit like the students back at Hogwarts. They’d fake every scream, every cry. Draco was seen as somewhat of a hero back at the castle. That thought couldn’t be more unsettling. He wasn’t a hero; he was a fraud who had gotten them all into that situation in the first place. He’d been the one to let Death Eater’s into Hogwarts. He was the reason that Albus Dumbledore was dead. It was all his fault.
“You know you can’t do that. Please think rationally.” Pansy begged him, tears slipping freely from her cheeks.
So, what if Pansy said his jokes were a little too much? Or that one, or fifty times that Blaise had commented on his poor wit. Their ignorance wasn’t his fault. That they were so wrapped up in their boring dialect to truly appreciate his intelligence.
He took a brave breath, “You may have made your choice, but you made my choice for me.” He gestured to the mark that was ingrained onto his skin.
Reluctantly, they pulled apart, lost in each other’s eyes. Potter smiled before pressing one last chaste kiss to Draco’s lips. It felt like goodbye. Draco didn’t want it to be goodbye.
“I’m always right.” Draco smugly commented. “I really don’t understand these muggles, where do they hide the bread?” he asked Potter, whilst slamming the toasterer onto the floor.
He nodded silently, a single tear escaping his clutches. He’d find Draco again. How could he not? Harry would do anything for Draco Malfoy. That was something that would never change.
He was ashamed to admit it, but he was glad to be free of his posy of Hufflepuff's for the minute. They were adorably unbearable. Kat he could handle, she was starting to become that of a sister to him. But with her came a whole band of excited, overbearing little Hufflepuff first years and Draco wanted to AK himself.
Draco shook his head. “I don’t know. I don’t know.” He said deliriously. “This is a good thing. It’s a good thing.” He repeated. “Now you can stay away from me. You have to stay away from me.”
She nodded, “I’m scared she admitted.” and Draco felt his face start to flush. It was the worst thing to hear that your child was fearful.
Suddenly Draco shot up, eyes wide with possibility. It could work! It could, it could, he was sure of it. He needed to be quick, it needed to be planned accurately. He only had one chance. But it could really work. He could really get out of here.
Several more seconds passed and Draco attempted to be calm. He was fine. He told himself. He. Was. Fine! Goddamn it! He felt a single tear roll down his cheek and he broke.
It wasn't okay. None of this was okay. But he relaxed, hoping that even for a moment, that he could forget everything.
“Malfoy!” a cold voice boomed, and he felt his heart stop. He kept on going. He couldn’t face it. He couldn’t face him.
She carried on, “But at the expense of our loved ones. Of our innocence. Of our sanity. So, we ask ourselves, what do we have to celebrate? What do we have to be thankful for?” she took a deep breath, looking at every last one of them intently, before continuing.
He decided that he was quite similar to Macmillan in many ways, well apart from the stupidity, but the biggest difference, was Macmillan's drive to change. Draco was still stuck being his father's puppet, too cowardly to stand up for himself.
He wanted to tell her that he was fine. That everything was going to be okay. But he couldn't, and that completely broke him.
Her lips curled knowingly, “yes, yes that seems about right. Especially after the amount of hexes your body took.” She said.
Was this what he got for being a little bit truthful? How rude. If this was how people were going to act whenever he told the truth, then he would cease to do it. He’ll become the classic lying, scheming Slytherin that everyone used to think he was.
He shook his head, smiling through the tears. “It’s not goodbye.” He told her determinedly. “It’s just see you later.” He promised.
“I’m sorry. I’m so, so sorry.” Draco sobbed. “But you all have to go. You have to go now. they’ll be here soon and I can’t stop them from hurting you. Please go, please just go.” He pleaded.
This was all his fault. Everything he touched died. She shouldn’t have been here. It shouldn’t have been her. She was the epitome of beauty and innocence. A vibrant and loving little girl, who represented all that was pure in the world.
Draco drooped his head back down, his gaze once again focused on his feet. He could see that Potter was hurting, that he needed Draco to say something. To say anything. But he wouldn't. He couldn't.
felt empty. Even though he was surrounded by his friends. That he had so many people who loved and had faith in him, he’d never felt so alone.
Weasley turned a very bright shade of red, “if you meant that I realised how much of an idiot I’d been, then yes.” He admitting placing a chaste cheek on Hermione’s cheek, who also began to blush.
Draco shrugged. “Nothing apart from the fact that you could’ve save us both a lot of time and effort, if you hadn’t called.” He bit out.
He was also a father that bathed him when he was young. A father who brought him his first broom. A father that picked him up and kissed away his injuries when he’d get hurt. A father that had tears in his eyes whenever he would hurt him. A father who’d held him when he had nightmares, who brought him chocolate when he was sad. A father that read to him, dressed him, smiled at him.
Why did the paper fold like that? Why were all the ribbons torn? Where the fuck did he put all the glitter? Why were there so many colours? No, seriously who thought it was a good idea to print numerous colours of the same bloody thing?
Okay, so Potter wasn't only the Boy Who Lived. He could now read bloody minds? The Dark Lord's chances had suddenly become a whole lot slimmer.
His father sighed an exasperated sigh, “Draco, I spend my days locked away in a tiny cell. I shall not and will not be ignored.” he raised a brow just urging Draco to defy him.
She smiled. “I’ve got the list you asked us for.” She waved a sheet of paper in front of him triumphantly, and his heart started to beat up.
With all the strength that he could muster, Draco took a small step forwards. “I have some news regarding the whereabouts of your daughter. May I please come in?” he choked out, willing himself to remain clam and strong.
Draco shrugged. “What’s wrong with being a little mad. Normal is totally overrated.” He teased the baffled girl.
His father, yet again tried to speak. But Draco sent him a glare, quickly silencing him. “You’re the one that got mixed up with the Dark Lord even before I was born. You’re the one that carried on serving you precious Lord after his death. Why?” he shamefully begged him for an answer.
“Potter, that doesn’t make any sense you bumbling idiot.” Potter said in a posh voice as if he were trying to imitate Draco.
The Weasley shrugged, “let’s just say news travels fast.” He laughed, “plus, Harry has always been bollocks at covering up his feelings.”
He shook his head. “You my friend, should take a good look at yourself in the mirror and ask: why would a man have anything to do with me, when they can have a self-sacrificing hero like Draco, who risks his life wrapping presents for Hufflepuff’s?” he asked feeling that some appreciation was in order.
Several seconds of silence passed before his father let out a low cough, “do you want to talk about it?” he asked.
Draco gave her a weak smile. “That is freakishly adorable.” He informed her. “You should tell him.” he decided.
Draco could do nothing but let the tears fall down his cheeks. He was awestruck. He realised that Potter hadn’t been his enemy. No, his biggest enemy had been himself.
He’d just arrived after another late-night talk with Potter by the lake. It had been nice. Potter had smiled, Draco had smiled. Potter had laughed, Draco had laughed…. And now he sounded like a sap.
He laughed, “I was just getting to that. Once you’ve selected the best, bring them outside the Slytherin dorms. Do you remember where they are?” he asked and she nodded.
In all honesty, Draco had no frickin idea, but he was going to carry on doing it. Crabbe may never forgive him, but he’d rather that then never being able to forgive himself.
Draco growled. “I don’t know what the fuck you’re talking about but let go of me. I need to stay. I have to protect my mother. I have to lead the Death Eater’s away from you. Who the fuck do you
He nodded. “Yes, I find that extremely hard to believe. I’ve been horrible to you.” He said honestly.
Hermione was his friend. The friend who had forgiven him for his previous vile behaviour. The friend who tutored him in transfiguration and sat with him in the library. The friend who comforted him when he was sad and vice versa. He wouldn’t allow his aunt to do anything to her. He couldn’t let it happen. Not again.
She opened her arms, hugging him close whilst she sobbed into his chest. “You’re not. You’re not. You’re not.” She droned deliriously.
So that ending broke my heart. Harry's insecurities are staring to make an appearance. A lil teaser for the next chapter: Drarry, Drarry and did I say Drarry?!
Potter touches his lips to the silver scars on Draco’s chest, and then does a double take. “I did that?” he croaked out, his eyes filling with tears.
Draco wanted to tell her that he was tired. That for the longest time something hadn’t been right with him. Like he’d forgotten something and he couldn’t remember what.
“Was it?” he asked again and Draco kept his head down, he couldn't look at Potter. He couldn't face him. Not like this. Not after what he'd done.
“Don’t get snarky with me.” Severus warned and Draco wished that he would just shut up. Alas, he didn't. He wouldn't.
He gave her an even bigger smile, “definitely. In fact, I think you’d look beautiful.” he said sincerely.
Draco raised a dreaded brow in acknowledgement. “Will you go to Hogsmeade with me this weekend?” he choked out.
With a shaky breath he sunk to his knees so that they were resting just in front of the mound. Hesitantly, he pulled out a sheet of parchment from his pocket and began to read.
“You should hate him.” she said simply. “You should absolutely hate him.” she urged him, and Draco wanted to scream.
Severus nodded smugly. “I thought not.” He snarled. “The Dark Lord fears that you are becoming complacent.” He remarked and Draco felt something close to dread start to build within him.
The Weaselette scoffed. “Really?” she drawled. “Because I’m quite sure that he loves sausage much more.” She spat and Draco paled. “Harry’s sausage to be exact.”
Everywhere he looks Potter is there. Giving him something to do, giving him confidence, giving him hope. He’s written to Potter more letters these last few weeks than he has anyone in his whole life.
Draco wanted to chuckle. Wasn’t it obvious that Potter didn’t know him anymore? Not really. Nobody did.
chicken when we snuck down to the kitchens to find some after curfew?” Draco shook his head. “Was it
Maybe Draco was overreacting, maybe Theo wasn't going to ask what he thought he was going to ask. He probably wanted to know what hair products Draco used, he couldn't blame him, His hair was flawless.
She smiled, and to his upmost surprise started to laugh right along with him. If anyone would’ve happened to come across them, they’d be cast off as crazy. But that didn’t much matter, they needed this.
Draco felt his heart clench and his skin prickle with anger and he imagined people picking on his best friend.
With a deep breath he carefully placed the chirping bird inside the cabinet, fixing the door shut firmly. He then muttered the necessary spells before opening the cabinet.
Oh no, Draco knew that look, it was here 'So, how are things with Potter and yourself' that he most definitely did not want to answer.
He sighed, stirring the potion a couple of times. “I’m not sure.” He answered dishonestly, “perhaps I’ve decided it not appropriate to insult others for pleasure anymore.”
He couldn’t understand what they saw. His nose was too pointy, his hair was too light. He was too skinny; his eyes were sunken and grey. His foul mouth, twisted beliefs and cruel actions did nothing to complement his looks.
No, but wait. He peered even closer. It was a smirk. He was sure of it. A long, nasty smirk. Well, how rude!
Theo was waiting for him outside, a chirper smile on his face. Draco wanted to wipe that smile right off his face. He didn’t deserve kindness. He should suffer. He needed to suffer.
Because by doing that. By acting as if everything was going to be okay, he'd given himself hope. He'd become ignorant to the consequences of his actions, he'd been made vulnerable. And that was dangerous.
Potter carried on, “But after a while. Those nights. Well, those nights became everything to me.” He reminisced. “They became an escape. A place to hide. To get away from a world that only saw me as their saviour. I was free to be Harry.
He wanted to tell her to smile. To tell him that everything was alright. He wanted her to hold him when he cried. To make him happy when he was sad. He wanted his mother back. He
Draw something happy he thought. Draw something happy. He could do that. It wasn’t that hard. Not really. All he had to do was think happy thoughts and his creative side would do the rest.
He looked at her confused, and she raised an eyebrow up in defiance. “Did you want to say something, Malfoy?” she asked boldly.
Draco screams as Potter pounds into him with fast, long strokes hitting that one spot inside him which brings him painfully close to the edge. He cries out, coming in hard, desperate spurts. “Come for me Potter. I’m gagging for it. Gagging!” he yells as Potter fucks into him chasing his own release before he’s shuddering filling Draco to the brim.
Potter stopped right in front of Draco, and his heart split in two, he felt sick to his stomach. “And you.” Potter spat and Draco’s cheeks started to heat up.
He gave her a first real smile, “you’re welcome, Hermione.” He returned, feeling light as if a weight had been lifted.
Potter was treading on deep waters now. It was one thing to insult Draco on his own. But to bring his friends into it? That was an all time low.
Yes, that sounded like Weasley. Too bloody stupid to see what's right in front of him. Except if it was chicken. Weasley
The battle had drawn to a close the moment Potter had struck down the Dark Lord with the help of a backfired
“Anyways.” Weasley continued, “Harry’s little episode cost me my chicken date. I was absolutely fuming. Still am, mind you.” He bit out.
It was raw, passionate, and full of longing. Draco sighed, pulling Potter closer. He needed this. Needed
Several moments passed before a small, meek girl coughed. “I think that’s brave and stupid. It’s stupid to be ruled by your emotions, but brave to let them take control.”
He rolled his eyes. “Hush, I was just getting to that.” He informed her. “Well, if I were a big brave Gryffindor, then I’d grab his fat head and plant one on him, right in public for the world to see.”
Draco felt Kat’s small hand lock with his, giving him a reassuring squeeze. He couldn't say anything to Potter. Not even if he wanted to.
He shook his head. “No, I need chicken.” He corrected. “Do you think that the kitchen’s are still open?” he asked.
spell. It was laughable really. Trust Potter to defeat one of the Darkest men of all time using nothing more than a bloody disarming spell.
He should’ve tried harder to get Draco to come with them. He should’ve pulled, tugged, done anything to keep him safe. But he hadn’t. Because he was a failure. When it came down to it, Harry Potter was a coward.
.” he snapped, willing with all his strength for Potter to understand him. “You don’t know how it feels. You don’t know how it
Draco was starting to second guess his sudden outburst of kindness. Kat had done exactly as he’d asked, ushering a herd of Hufflepuff's to meet him outside the Slytherin dungeons. They were all looking at him as though he were some kind of disease. A Disease? Draco. Lucius. Malfoy. Diseased! The only disease he had was his infectious charm and devastating looks. Insolent little gits.
It was sickly sweet. Seeing the couple so in love with one another, filled Draco with a deep sense of longing. He
“I know what they’re saying about Potter is true.” She started and Draco was slightly shocked. “We all knew. Kat was the first to figure it out.” She slowly admitted. He winced, because
“Certain.” He assured her. “Well, why don’t you go back to the Hufflepuff table. I probably wont be returning anytime soon.” He offered and she nodded.
His aunt laughed manically, “is poor likkle Draco looking for his precious Potter? You’ve been a bad, bad boy.” She reprimanded, pointing her wand him in a threatening stance.
That was a lie. She was more Draco's than anyone else could ever hope her to be. He knew he was being selfish, but what was the point of martyring himself off if he wasn't going to receive any gains?
before he flared his robes and swiftly left the common room. Draco Malfoy wasn’t anything if not dramatic. Severus Snape would be jealous.
This was awkward. Draco wasn’t imagining things, right? He’d spent hours thinking about how his first meeting with Potter would go, he’d even dreamed about it. There had been smiles, cries, and screams, but never had he dreamed anything like this. This was particularly embarrassing.
Pansy laughed. “Only you would be proud of little buggers torturing people in your defence.” She mocked, and alas he was happy to say that she was right.
The courtroom broke out in celebration, and Draco’s heart had clenched with relief. It was over. It was all over. He had looked up into the crowd of smiling faces only for his eyes to settle on Potter. Because of course, it was always Potter. They had shared a smile that was only reserved for the two of them, and for the first time, Draco felt as if the future was bright.
“I’m not outwardly renouncing the Dark Lord. I’m helping him.” he said quickly in an attempt to divert the heat from him.
But of course, it was. Because all of Potter’s problems were Draco’s fault. And you know what, maybe he was right. Maybe they were. It made sense in a twisted way.
“Are we going to keep talking about Draco’s arse or are why going to talk about why it called us in here?” Big-mouth Jerry commented and Draco growled at him.
Once again, tears formed in the crests of her eyes. “Draco” she whispered cautiously. “That’s not healthy.” She said gently.
The dungeons were dark and cold. The chain hanging from a single leg dug forcefully into his angles. The Malfoy’s had been sentenced to spent three nights in their own dungeons after what had happened with Potter. It was less of a physical punishment, than it was to bring utter humiliation on the Malfoy name.
So, he’d snapped. He told Pansy to shut up and never utter Potter’s name whenever he was around. It was a moment that he was less than proud of.
“Katerina is that you?” His father asked and Draco concluded that he’d finally let go of the speaker. He felt the same emotion filled tears that threatened to spill whenever he heard his daughter’s name.
Draco shrugged. “I can’t say I’m all that bothered.” He quirked. “Anyways, how’s the potion coming along?” he asked, taking a seat next to Weasley.
Draco stared at him for several moments in sheer disbelief. “Really?” he questioned, deciding that Lavender would absolutely
They stayed wrapped around one another as the sun came up. A new day, which symbolized, need, forgiveness and a deep understanding.
“I’m sorry Draco. I’m so, so sorry.” He grieved. “It’s going to be okay. It’s all going to be okay. I’ll protect you. I’ll protect you.” Draco could barely hear him, the pounding in his ears becoming too much.
“Since I found out that you won’t get into Auror training if you’re shite at potions.” He answered honestly.
His father shook his head. “And that was one of the biggest mistakes of my life. I should’ve let you choose. You could’ve been greater, better than I.” he mumbled.
Ms Pritchett stepped aside and he entered the house. He figured that it would have been homely even just a few weeks ago. Now it just seemed melancholic. The lights were dim, dust lined the floors. The white walls appeared grey, and the air was stale and old.
think I’ve called this group meeting?” he asked them dismayed to be given a bunch of blank faces in return.
Draco scoffed. “That’s an outrageously long name for a game. But I must say, it does sound quite interesting. I’ll have to give it a try one of these days.” He mused.
“What’s going on in here?” Madam Pomfrey tutted, walking in briskly, shaking her head in disappointment in her wake.
“Not that I don’t like the Hufflepuff’s.” Theo whispered, “but wasn’t this supposed to be a date?” he asked light-heartedly.
He briefly wondered if Draco had misjudged him. He glanced at the red faced guy. So, maybe Macmillan
“Ever since he’s been back, he’s been different. One minute he’s hot, the next he’s cold. He snaps for no reason. We just don’t know what to do.” She sighed in defeat.
Draco glared at her. “And I like it when you’re quiet.” He deadpanned. Do you know what Draco wanted? Sleep.
Several moments later, Potter and Weasley burst through the room. Through blurry eyes, he was sure that he could see their ex-house elf with them, but he was probably hallucinating.
“I’ve never hated you. Disliked you, yes. Thought you a bit of an imbecile, definitely. But hated you? Never. That was always you.”
Deep laughter filled the room as Potter tore off his invisibility cloak. He narrowed his eyes at him. “I hate it when you do that.” He spat and Potter.
Draco felt shaken to his core. Potter always managed to surprise him, he'd give him that. Actually, surprise wasn’t even the right word to describe how he was feeling.
Kat was his saving grace. She was the light in all the darkness that surrounded him. She’d taught him bravery. She’d taught him determination. She’d taught him love. She showed him how to be
He didn’t have any answers, but he needed them, he craved them. He had to know, he had to understand why he was feeling like this.
It was if it all had finally clicked in Macmillan’s obscenely small head. “You’re right I think I will.” He declared with determination.
It wasn’t right to align himself with The Dark Lord. It wasn’t right to bare his mark. It wasn’t easy to have his home ripped from him. It wasn’t easy to see his mother withering in pain at the hands of a crucio. It wasn’t as easy as to flock over to the order and leave his mother to die. It wasn’t bloody well easy to renounce everything he was brought up to believe, but still be trapped in a destiny that had already been decided for him. So, Draco didn’t have a choice between right and easy. He had a choice between life and death, and he’d chosen the latter.
, I’ll marry you.” Harry broke out into a grin that lit up his entire face as he slipped the ring onto Draco’s finger, bringing him into a tender kiss.
Luna shifted closer towards him, resting her hands softly against his own. “Do you think, that, perhaps, you meant that in more ways than one?” she asked intently.
He looked up. Potter’s eyes were on him as he slowly made his way towards Draco. He didn’t want to hurt Potter. He could never hurt Potter. No matter what Potter may think of him.
give me some bullshit about seeing Ms Pritchett. She’s not the only person in the world, it’s unhealthy.” She stated firmly and Draco promptly shut up.
it hadn’t been years, but it had been one so it still counted! Anyways, after years and years of analysis he’d realised that every Gryffindor had a little bit of Hufflepuff within them. And maybe, just
His words faded, as Potter lifted his hand, bringing it to Draco’s neck, gently pulling out the ring that lay silently on Draco’s chest. Carefully, he unclasped the necklace, removing the ring from its chain.
He diverted his attention back on Potter. “You didn’t scream at me. You didn’t demand anything. You just wanted me. You listened to me. You never said anything, but I knew you were always listening. You would smile when I said something funny. You would squeeze my hand whenever I said something sad.”
Was he really that obvious? Did he seriously have the words ‘I love Harry Potter’ written on his forehead. It was all very concerning if you asked him.
The first years were surrounding him at the Slytherin table all involved in excited chatter. Kat was to the right of him squealing in delight whilst Pansy was to the left of him, her eyes glistening with amusement.
In all the 'excitement' he should say, he'd never stopped to think how his accident could've emotionally impacted the Hufflepuff's.
Kat sill didn’t look all that convinced. “Anyways, I’m sure Pansy would like to hear all about your Slytherin green hair idea.” He offered.
Draco sighed opening his mouth to tell her "nothing" at the same time Kat said “we’re showing Draco our war chants.” and Madame Pomfrey gave him a death glare.
“Harry, we’ve got to get out of here!” Weasley cried, he stopped when he looked at Draco. “Good to see you again mate.” He gave him a smile which he hesitantly returned.
Just as he was about to accept his Headmaster’s offer of salvation, Death Eater’s stormed in. Them circling and prodding him, urging him to finish what he’d started. He wouldn’t. He wasn’t strong enough for that.
Draco shivered as he made direct eye contact with Potter, shifting slightly in his seat as Potter gave him a confused glare.
“You’ll always have a piece of me with you.” He said sweetly and Draco looked up at him in awe, a single tear rolling down his cheek. It was beautiful. He was
He shook his head. “Don’t worry Draco, I’ll never do anything to hurt her. I love her.” he chirped before walking away, a spring in his step.
Draco sighed. “I suppose I could spare a few moments of my time.” He snapped because he wasn’t heartless. He was just tired. Very, very tired.
He would always forgive Potter. That thought used to scare him, but now it made him feel peace. It helped him to remember that he was capable of feeling anything but sadness. He felt passion. He felt need. He felt happiness.
He took a shaky breath as he readied himself, he was scared. He was really, really scared. But he had to do this. He finally had a choice, and he was going to make it. He was ready.
Severus glared, “I can’t decide whether you are dumb or just stupid. Since you’ve decided to openly go against the Dark Lord, I must settle on the latter.”
He took a deep breath, “do you not believe me?” he asked, his voice laced with vulnerability. Potter clutched Draco’s wand, their hands almost touching. “I promise that I’m telling the truth. I’ve been completely lost without you. There’s been more days than I’d like to admit where I’ve wanted to give up because you wasn’t with me.” He told Draco intently.
But it wasn’t even the fact that he had taken another life that disgusted him. No, it was that he’d liked it. He’d looked into her defenceless, pleading, eyes and had felt nothing but sheer pleasure. He wanted her to die, he’d wanted her to get hurt. And he’d done it.
“Draco darling, don’t you think you’re being a tad dramatic?” she asked him and he glared at her. He was
shed an abundance of tears, or Merlin help me, I’ll rise from the dead and strangle your brains out.” He threatened.
He took a deep breath and asked himself one question. A question that was needed, a question that would allow him to rest.
She sighed. “I’m sorry darling, I wanted to bring you a nice cup of tea before your big day tomorrow.” She offered in an apologetic tone.
“I haven’t got time to get involved in insignificant things like relationships.” Draco said unconvincingly.
She shook her head. “Don’t lie to me Draco.” she chastised, and Draco felt his stomach start to sink.
Hesitantly, Draco made his way towards them. He shook his head frantically. He refused to believe that anything had happened. He would know. He would
Oh no. Oh dear. Oh god. Oh whatever else that came after 'oh'. This was bad, this was very, very bad.
Draco opened the rest of the presents to find a pack of art pencils, a watercolour pallet, a pack of coloured pencils, an easel, and a canvas. He was in complete shook and he had to blink discreetly to prevent tears from falling.
Draco felt something acute to anger start to bubble up deep inside him, “Yes father, I’m friends with a Muggleborn Hufflepuff. Actually, I’ve made friends with many Hufflepuff’s.” he lowly informed him.
Draco shook his head, “what do you want from me?” he asked, nearly begging as he stared into hurt green eyes.
? Alone. With only a ghost for company. He couldn't even remember what life was like before he'd gotten the mark.
Her face lit up as soon as her eyes landed on Scorpius. “And who do we have here?” she teased, grabbing him from Harry’s hands and spinning him around. “Have you been a good boy Scorpius?” she asked as Scorpius nodded frantically, clapping his hands with glee.
If Draco was a stronger man he would’ve done just that but alas, he wasn’t. He was pathetic. He knew, deep, deep down that Potter had already been forgiven, even before he’d apologised.
Anyways, he was attempting to look at anything but his controversial looks. No, instead he was checking to see if he had the words
This was torture. This was actual torture. He couldn’t understand how muggles actually did this. Were they sure that they weren’t wizards? This was virtually impossible.
Potter snorted. “No Malfoy. I’m sure you don’t want to stay here alone with me.” he said almost sarcastically and Draco was less offended than he was scared.
Maybe if he’d realised what a colossal jerk he was earlier then perhaps they would’ve become friends sooner. He definitely would’ve liked that he decided. He reasoned that she must be a beautiful person to forgive him after what he’d put her through. He reckoned that’s exactly what she was.
He continued to sketch. His messed-up attempt at happiness. It wasn’t perfect, it wasn’t normal, but it was his.
He’d once thought that life wasn’t about avoiding the bruises, but maybe it was collecting the scars to prove he’d shown up for it.
Potter nodded, “Draco this is Andromeda Tonks. Andromeda this is Draco Malfoy.” He gestured between them and Andromeda smiled in welcome.
“I didn’t know if you were even alive. I prayed you were. I begged and pleaded every day. It almost became too much, I almost let go. But I realised, that I had to carry on. That I had to keep strong. The sooner the war ended, the sooner I’d see you. You were the only thing that kept me going. What keeps me going.” He whispered his eyes laced with emotion.
He paused as if waiting for Draco to respond. Fat chance that was going to happen. “I swear to Merlin Malfoy if you’ve done anything to her, I’ll end you.” He spat and Draco could feel a slight anger start to boil beneath his skin.
He'd decided to go for the easier option. Because he was fine. Well, in a sense. Okay, he wasn't. But he should be. He
“Not so fast.” Slughorn boomed, and Draco wanted to hex the man where he stood. “I have yet to announce the project that you and your assigned partners will have to complete.” Draco cringed looking between his assigned partner and the twinkle in Slughorn’s eyes.
What was with all the questions? Why did Potter care so much. He wanted nothing to do with Draco, he'd made that quite clear.
If I were a cowardly Slytherin, afraid of a battle like this, where would I go? He thought, Draco was a Slytherin, yes, but a coward? He was not. Not anymore.
“No!” he said a little too quickly and Theo frowned. “Sorry, I just really need a bit of time for myself.” He said hoping that it was an acceptable answer.
When did Weasley not do something that was both idiotic and ignorant? In fact, he had a sneaky suspicion about what this all could be about.
Draco shook his head. “I’m sorry, my head’s just all over the place.” He sighed, hoping that the somewhat of an admittance would get her off his back..
His mouth was soft, his lips just brushing against Draco’s slowly at first. His body started to tremble, but Potter was careful, so gentle. He cups his face even tighter and kisses Draco passionately until little sounds well up in the back of his throat, his mouth opening up for him as he feels Potter’s tongue slide in. He tastes of chocolate, of treacle tart, but mostly, he tastes of home.
And that was worse than the person he'd once shown himself to be, an open traitorous person was far more acceptable than a hidden one. Those were the ones most likely to stab you in the back.
He prayed, he hoped with his whole hard that wasn't the case, that they'd make it. But a part of him knew that wasn't true. That it would
Shit he thought as he was hit with an abundance of hexes. He absently remarked that maybe he should’ve kept his mouth shut, before it all went black.
“God, I want you.” His hands slips under Draco’s pyjama top. “Please Draco, let me have you.” He begged.
Potter smiled reassuringly. “So am I.” he stated. “But we’ll get through it.” he assured Draco. “Together.”
It was if he was finally whole. That the part of him that had been missing for so long had been found. Potter made him feel safe. He made him feel secure. He made him feel alive.
is this a good thing?” he spat as he dug his nails deep into the palms of his hands. “He doesn’t remember me. What part of that sounds good to you?”
When was Potter not completely out of order? It was like second nature to him. Perfect Potter really wasn’t all that perfect if you asked him.
Gathering up all the courage he had left, he placed a kiss full of longing, passion, and love to Harry’s pouted, full lips. The kiss saying all the words that he couldn’t express. It was over as quickly as it had began and Draco felt empty.
Draco looked up at her defiantly and her eyes widened with acknowledgement. “Oh, this will be fun.” She squealed firing the first spell.
It must be spelled so that only Hufflepuff's could see them. It was the only acceptable answer. It was the only solution as to why Draco had a band of devoted Hufflepuff first years, willingly aiding to his every beck and call.
did he want him to say? The war was over. It was bloody over. It wasn’t meant to be like this. Draco was meant to be happy; everything was meant to make sense. So, then why was everything still so confusing? Why wasn’t it all just simple?
Draco could do nothing but stare into the distance. It was no secret that his aunt had been a horrible person, but he’d killed her. He’d killed her with a vengeance, just like she’d done to Kat.
Draco looked up, his head searing in pain. Smith seemed to have killed him. Congratulations Zacharias fucking Smith, for he had successfully done what even the Dark Lord could not. Draco really needed to stop dying. Cause of death: an obnoxious twat and his massive ego.
An innocent girl had gotten hurt, Madam Rosmerta would perhaps never forgive him, his innocence was lost, and for what? The old crow was still alive and kicking and the Boy Who Lived to obsessively stalk Draco Malfoy still hadn’t gotten the hint and backed off.
Well, not anymore. He was tired of running. It was time to fight for the one person who had never stopped fighting for him.
She clapped her hands excitedly before picking up a large gift bag from the floor and plonking it down to the table.
Draco pondered this. “I’m not quite sure, I just know that I am.” He decided to shy away from the whole truth. He didn't need Weasley to help him, not when they'd just become friends.
Ricky nodded. “Thank you, Draco.” he told him earnestly, and Draco couldn't help but like the small human.
Draco spent the rest of the night transfixed onto his drawing, silently, desperately trying to understand what Potter had meant.
“No first you deceive me. Then you tell me that you love me. And now you’re going to leave me. No. No. No!” he screamed.
Potter must have sensed his confused state because his features became very serious. As if the middle of a bloody battle wasn’t already the appropriate place to at serious.
With a choked sob, he smiled at the star and whispered, “you’ve done it. You can rest now.” he told his best friend, who’s love had saved them all.
It hadn't been this way before the start of sixth year. Potter hadn't been acting so.. unstable. No, it had started around the same time that Draco had become more subdued.
him to say? There was nothing he could say that would make much sense at the moment, so he kept his lips firmly shut.
Draco pulled out the rusty tin can, before handing it to her as she disappeared in a whirl of green light.
“Draco!” a familiar small voice squeaked in greeting. He felt himself start to relax and the sound of the voice he knew all too well.
His aunt licked a long strip of his face, saliva now dripping from his chin. “You taste of fear.” She murmured. “You shouldn’t be scared, sweet Draco. I’m not going to hurt you. I helped you.” She stated simply.
He’d snuck out to the pond every night since he’d gotten back to the Manor. He couldn’t explain it. He just felt this persistent need to sit by the pond every night by himself, watching the sun come up. It was silly, he knew that. But in a weird way, the act made him feel safe, protected.
It didn’t seem real. These sort of moments only happened in the safety of ones imagination. Draco shook his head in pure disbelief, “you’re here.” He whispered his voice drenched with pure wonder.
Draco hugged her just as tight, “I promise.” He said truthfully, and they remained wrapped in each other’s arms for several more moments.
Draco’s features softened. “Why not?” he questioned, completely confused as to why such a loving person like herself could ever be sad.
on me just because you’re feeling a little bit touchy.” Blaise teased, backing away slowly in a joking manner.
that Draco’s nose twitched whenever he was thinking. Draco didn’t know anything. He had no bloody clue. He didn’t know what made Potter happy. He didn’t know what made him sad. He didn’t know the names of his parents or what his childhood was like. He didn’t know why he liked Draco. Or even why Draco bloody liked him. He didn’t know a thing!
Anyhow, Pansy said a few things, he said a few things. Screams erupted, slaps were thrown. The bitch had managed to claw him right on the cheek. He raised a shaky hand to the wound; he was convinced that she was part cat.
Draco gave her a rare, genuine smile. “Enough of this lovey dovey feelings talk, tell me how you first day of classes are going.”
She sat with Blaise who sent him a few confused looks, which left him with no one else to sit with but Crabbe and Goyle. Not that he minded too much, unbeknownst to most, Crabbe and Goyle were actually pretty decent to be around. Besides, it prevented him from having to sit next to Theo. The man harboured a crush on Draco as big as the Dark Lord’s forehead and believe him it was big. He should know.
He couldn’t remember where it was from, he just knew that he could never part with it. It was a part of him. He’d rather die than leave it behind.
Draco opened his mouth to speak, but she cut him off. “You’re the only person that came to check if I was okay.” She smiled, “I don’t think that you’re a bad person.” She repeated. “I think that you’re lovely.”
Instead he was lost. Broken. Engulfed in a path of devastation. He’d realised he had never truly felt pride. Nor loyalty.
Hermione told him that worrying was pointless, and he would go crazy because of it. She promised him that if she knew Harry like she think she did, then he would never fall out of love with him. Pansy on the other hand, had slapped him on the head and reminded him that Potter’s leaving was all his fault in the first place.
The Headmistress took one last strong breath, “we’ve been given a second chance. It’s time we forget how to survive and begin to learn how to live.” She finished and the entire hall erupted into applause, tears dusting all faces.
Draco shook his head slightly, but he felt his resolve starting to fade. What was it about this girl that made him act so out of character?
Her eyes shone with surprise, “Thank you, Draco.” She breathed and his name fell from her lips with minimal effort, but it was quite odd.
Draco sighed, knowing that he was fighting a losing battle. “Fine.” He bit out. “I have no bloody idea what we are or were should I say.” he said.
He groaned as he felt Potter’s hard length rub against the crack of his arse, and Draco greedily moved his hips so his arse was rubbing against Potter’s cock.
Sulkily, Draco began to make his way towards the door. “Hold on!” Slughorn’s chirper voice ordered. Draco groaned before turning back round, “there will be
He couldn’t do it. He wouldn’t do it. The Headmaster would one day die, but it would not be by his hand. He’d made his
Draco was sitting nervously in the Great Hall. Kat was chatting away to the left of him and Theo was on his right. He had no particular reason to be nervous, he just was.
Draco turned a fine shade of red, “Of course Sir, I’ll try to control my Hufflepuff's.” He sent him a small smile before taking his leave.
Truthfully, it wasn't so much that he was different, it was more so that he was quiet. Or maybe it was because he was defeated. That must be it, he decided.
“You’re impossible. Absolutely impossible.” He spat. “Let me spell it out to you in a way that even your miniature brain would understand.” Draco raised an eyebrow expectantly. “Draco Malfoy Pride badges equal Hufflepuff’s. Hufflepuff’s equal Mudbloods. Mudblood’s equal soft Draco. Soft Draco equals angry Dark Lord. Angry Dark Lord equals dead Draco.” He patronisingly said. “Do you understand?” he asked.
Draco felt his heart start to break. “It’s no excuse for how I treated you. I know it isn’t. But I want you to get it. I want you to understand.” He pleaded. “I felt as if I had to do it. That I had to make you sad. Then it wouldn’t be so bad. Then I could ignore everything I felt for you. I was in denial. In fact, it maybe worked for a week at the most. After that, it hurt. It hurt to see you in pain and know that I had caused it. But I still carried on. I still hurt you. Because I was a coward. Because I
Carefully, he retrieved his art supplies. It had been such a long time. He didn’t want to sleep. No, he wanted to draw.
He’d said it one and he’ll say it again, who needed the Saviour of the Wizarding World, when Draco had a mob of angry little Hufflepuff’s?
Potter shook his head. “Why did you do that? How could you do that?” he spat out. “I trusted you!” he screamed.
He’d at first managed to get into a spectacular row with Pansy. It was on nothing that particularly peaked his interest. She’d been annoyed at the lack of attention he’d given herself and the other Slytherins that morning and the previous evening. Personally, he thought it a pathetic reason to be upset.
Suddenly, Potter jumped from Hagrid’s arms, a defiant glint residing in his eyes. Draco gasped, overwhelmed with feeling. But it was… impossible. It couldn’t be true. He must be seeing things. He blinked a few times. No, Potter was still there, as alive as he’d been when he’d last saw him.
A comforting hand clamped gently onto his shoulder. “It had to be done. There was no choice.” Neville said determinedly.
Draco took a deep breath. “He’s kind to me. He tells me wonderful stories. He’s patient with me. He doesn’t ask for more than I’m willing to offer. He makes me feel special. He makes me feel safe.” He said, half-admitting it all to himself.
Potter continued, “as I said, I went to see your father today. He gave me the last push I needed, the last piece of strength that would allow me to do this.” With shaking hands Potter let go of Draco’s hand, pulling out a ring that hung silently from his own neck.
Honestly, he didn't know how much more of this that he could take. There was a point when someone had enough. Where it all became too much. Draco feared that point had surpassed him long ago.
It was his guilty pleasure. If his father ever found out, then well, Draco didn’t want to think about that.
Potter crouched down next to him, tears falling from his eyes. “Draco?” he whispered in pure disbelief. His features wide with shock.
Kat shook her head. “I thought that they were nice before they started saying mean things about you. But you’re my best friend in the whole entire world, if they don’t like you then I don’t like them.” She stated firmly.
She shot him a smile before rising to her feet. “Well then, I think I might just do that.” She eyed him contemplatively, “I still don’t like you Malfoy.” She declared. “But thank you.” She said sincerely.
Draco glared at him. “No, it doesn’t. Why not have built in bread? Why build this confusing contraption? Why not use a charm to toast the bread?”
Potter narrowed his eyes, stomping away from the Gryffindor table with determination. Draco’s eyes trailed him as he walked towards the doors.
He smiled. “The end of the week, at the latest.” He answered, shooting her one of his rare, signature smiles.
Draco grinned. “Well, I do love my Hufflepuff’s.” he admitted, his features giving away the love that he felt for them.
Draco’s eyes widened in fear. “No. No. No. No.” he raked a hand through his hair anxiously. “I need him Pans. I need him so much.” he begged her, clutching the hem of her robe tight.
Draco opened his mouth to tell her that she was wrong, but she cut him off, “we push people away because we’re scared. Because we can’t imagine a world when we’re not in control.” She put her hand atop of Draco’s.
“Draco, is everything okay?” Kat asked, her eyes full of worry, as he made his way hesitantly towards her.
cowardly leave the battle. Part of giving up was accepting that it was okay to start again. Opening his arms meant staying true to himself, to what he believed in, to
Draco sniffed, as he opened his mouth to continue. “But it’s true, and I want you to remember it.” he said honestly.
He nodded, “I’ll bring it down after dinner.” He promised just as Draco was pulled into a hug from Hermione as Weasley patted him on the back.
Potter looked up at Draco, deep pain was plastered onto his broken features. Tears falling from his one broken eye. He looked a mess. His emotions seemed to be all scrambled up. Draco couldn’t comprehend it. He looked happy, but sad. Optimistic put defeated. Relieved but worried. Tortured but thankful. And something else. Something that was so large, which made him glow so brightly, something that he couldn’t quite place.
His father looked him dead in the eye, “But as I look at you. As I see all that you have become. All that you fight for. I
So, he sat down next to her, with the intent on bringing a smile to her face. “What ever is the matter?” he asked, his voice laced with concern.
Well, that was the case anymore. He'd personally make sure that Kat was loved and appreciated in the way that she so desperately deserved.
“This whole idea is insane, Malfoy. Are you sure you haven’t been slipped some of the potion yourself?” he attempted to joke and Draco wanted to cut his tongue out.
Pansy stopped abruptly as she laid eyes on him, “Oh Draco.” She whispered bringing him into a tight squeeze. “It’s okay, it’s going to be okay. I’m here. I’m here.” She soothed running her fingers through his hair gently.
“When are we going to work on our project?” he questioned and Draco grimaced. If looks could kill, Weasley would be six feet under by now. Draco inwardly smiled at the correct use of the muggle phrasing that Kat had taught him earlier. Anyways, Draco had just managed to forget the project he’d been told of just moments ago, and now Weasley was idiotic enough to bring it up again. What was with all the rude Gryffindor's today?
Draco narrowed his eyes at him, “what I felt, and what I didn’t feel is none of your concern.” He growled.
The tears were running freely down both of their faces. “The second I’d done it, I realised how much of a mistake it had been. I was a coward. A freak. A puppet. I was making my father’s choices not my own. I feel dirty. Worn. Used. I’ve been marked. My soul blackened. And I regret it. I’ll always regret it.” Potter finished.
He finished up his hair with a drying and setting charm, before looking at his reflection intently. Well he didn’t look…bad.
“No, you don’t.” He screamed. “You don’t know how much it hurts. To look into the mirror and hate what you see. To know that you’re nothing but a pathetic failure.”
? She just had to be messing with him. They really weren't anything special. Just a few sketches here and there. They mostly reflected his mood more than anything else.
“Really? I would’ve put you down for more of a pug than a pig.” He joked and she jabbed him in his side. “Ouch.” He said whilst peering closer at her, “you know, since you mentioned it, I do think you could pass for a bit of a pig. Your nose is very pig-like. Don’t you agree Pansy darling?”
So, Draco was sarcastic? Everybody in the world was sarcastic. And if they weren’t? Well, their poor life choices wasn’t his problem.
He didn’t want to breathe. Not anymore. The one thing that he’d thought about. The reunion that he’d so desperately craved. The one and only person that had kept him going, was gone.
Was nobody going to comment on how awkward it all was? Draco looked round frantically at his friends; their lips remained tightly sealed. Seriously, nobody?
Potter shook his head, taking a few steps towards Draco so that their lips were almost touching. Gently, Potter clasped their hands together and Draco forgot how to breathe. “He took the wrong person.
He didn’t understand it at all. He didn’t know why Potter was so horrible to him during the day. He didn’t know why Potter treated him like a real person at night.
Potter entwined their fingers together and looked up at Draco defiantly. “There’s not much I can say to that except that I remember. Oh Merlin, do I remember. And I can promise you now, that what we had is worth fighting for. I wasn’t lying when I told you that you were it for me Draco Malfoy.” He said intently.
Growling at him she snarled out. “If you don’t stop this instant Draco Malfoy, I swear you’ll be the one explaining to Harry why you no longer have balls.” She spat out, and Draco promptly shut up.
With a sigh, Draco ripped open one of the presents to find a large black sketchbook. He gasped, a hand flying up to cover his mouth.
Draco felt conflicted, he didn’t want to hurt his friend, but there was no way in hell that he was letting him kill Potter. He wouldn’t let that happen.
Something had happened. Something had definitely happened in their sixth year. Something monumental. It made sense. The whole year was foggy in Draco’s brain. Whenever he thought back to the year, there were gaps missing. Events he couldn’t quite piece together, and whenever he tried to think about them, he would be hit with a wave of uncomfortable pressure. So, something
“Then it shall be the most honourable death known to man.” He joked, feeling much better than he had in days.
changing partners.” He stated with finality and the last shred of hope Draco had, smashed into little pieces.
So, I think there's only 3 chapters left including the epilogue. Hang on in there! Happiness is only a couple of chapters away :) :)
She shrieked in crazed filled laughter. “Oh, I’m so scared. Likkle Bikkle Dwaco is going to do something bad to me.” She spat out. “Well, it’s a good thing I know exactly what to do to make him hurt.” She snarled firing a crucio at Hermione.
The nerve on this guy! Draco scoffed. “You mean that your sorry that you and your little buddy Smith pelted me with so many hexes that I ended up with the hospital wing?” he spat.
Draco crossed his arms across his chest, looking away. “I don’t want to talk about it.” he mumbled almost grumpily.
He knew that. How could he love him? He didn’t even remember him. What he did know, however, was that Potter meant something to him. How could he not?
Blaise took a deep breath. “You scared us both half to death.” He tried to appear calm, but Draco could see right through him.
Except from the fact that a madman is trying to kill himself and his family. That he’s being given a task to kill Dumbledore dearest. That he needs to push all his friends away in order to protect them. That he hadn’t realised how much his friends cared for him before it was too late. That he’s realised what a complete bigoted imbecile he was and wants to change but can’t because it’s not his duty. And…you. Then nothing, nothing at all.
Draco looked at the young boy. “Love is a fickle thing. It’s not so much of me loving the man he has become but holding onto the man he once was. The man who’s cared for me all these years.” He took a deep breath. “That man has always been special to me, someone who I’d deeply admired. Do you understand now?” he asked.
“There you go again. Ignoring me like you have been since the beginning of the year. Go on then, run away you bloody coward!” Theo spat and Draco turned on his heel.
Hippogriff’s. Disgusting creatures. They deserved a punishment worse than death. He hated those bloody chickens.
Bellatrix squawked as she danced around in triumph. “You thought that you could get away with it. That you could be a blood traitor and no one would notice. But I noticed. I. Noticed. It. All!” she howled.
He looked up at his father with tearful eyes, “I’m not fine.” He admitted, his heart threatening to explode.
Severus sighed defeatedly before releasing him. “When did you become so reckless?” he commented showing as much emotion as Severus Snape could possibly manage.
Draco rolled his eyes, because yes, Draco normally sounded exactly like a younger Snape. He should thank Potter for that stupid observation.
Draco breathed out dramatically. “Really Blaise? You act as if I’m not best friends with an eleven-year-old muggle girl.” He said matter-of-factly.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Oh, ha bloody ha.” He bit out, “just for that you’re off my Christmas present list.” He snapped. And if Blaise thought he was lying, well... he'd have a shock come Christmas morning.
Draco knew that he should stick up for himself. That he should stop ignoring Potter during their talks. But he couldn’t. Deep down he knew that he deserved it. That Potter had every right to berate him after all the years Draco had antagonized him. He couldn’t talk to Potter during their meetings or even attempt to interact with him. If he did, then he’d be allowing himself a pleasure that he couldn’t accept. He was a Death Eater and Death Eater’s didn’t deserve nice things.
It had been almost a month since he’d been back there. Since he’d been to Kat’s grave. He knew that it was weak, that it was wrong on his part. But he just couldn’t bring himself to. He’d thought about it many a times, he’d even gone as far as to make it to the door of the Malfoy grounds. But he’d always receded, wanting it to stay a dream just a little while longer had always won in the end.
Well, that was all kinds of wrong. Being a Slytherin was about knowing when a good lie was warranted in a particular situation. Sadly, this pathetic excuse of an interrogation didn't qualify.
Weasley gave him a confused look, but Draco nodded urging him to continue. Weasley would thank him in the future.
He could understand that. He really could. But that didn't make it hurt any less. He wished it did. He really did.
“ARRGGGGGGGG!” he screamed as he slammed open his door and came face to face with a very confused Death Eater. The Death Eater was tall and well built. He looked young too, as if he could really pull a few punches if it came down to it. He wasn’t kidding the man was really, really ripped. And suddenly, Draco didn’t have that much faith in his chances…
There may or may not have been a teeny bit of angst squeezed within all that fluff. I couldn't help it, I live for ANGST! So, that was my first time writing smut... was it any good? Draco/Muggle Appliances/Sausages is life!!! A lil teaser for next Chapter: The calm before the storm....
He sighed. “Who says you can trust anyone?” he started, taking a different approach for the umpteenth time today. “This is war. How do you know that the good isn’t the bad and the bad isn’t the good?” he prodded and she gasped.
Luna shuffled closer to him, resting her head on his shoulder. “We’re just as sane as they are.” She murmured.
He couldn't change. He wanted to, desperately. But how could you change the person that he was always destined to be?
Draco had spent the whole summer worrying out of his wits. His mind was constantly submerged with bothersome questions like what if Potter forgot about him? Or what if Potter never wanted to see him? Or the dreaded, what if Potter fell out of love with him?
Draco huffed. “It’s not a big deal or anything, he just annoyed that I won’t go out with him.” he explained.
Her eyes softened when she took in Potter’s distressed state. “Leave it Harry, come on lets go.” She extended her hand towards him.
A small voice perked up. “Is grandpa struggling to use muggle technology again Papa?” it asked, and Draco turned to smile at his daughter. His beautiful, beautiful daughter.
That's when it all clicked. He finally understood. She wasn't mad, no, she was afraid. She didn't want to lose him. Neither of them wanted to lose him. He felt horrible. He felt ashamed.
. Draco seemed to hurt everyone he touched these days. But hearing that he'd hurt Potter. Knowing all that he had done to him. He realised that hurting Potter was worse that all the others he'd hurt combined. It pained him that he didn't know
He took a deep breath, “I read your letters.” He told him, and Draco felt something close to dread pool in the pits of his stomach. Potter shook his head upon seeing Draco’s reaction, “they don’t change anything. In fact, they’ve made me love you even more, if that’s at all possible.” He admitted.
She shook her head more certainly now. “I was crying behind that pillar for ages. So many people passed me by and didn’t as much as spare me a second glance.”
He knew he shouldn’t. He wasn’t stupid. He knew that Potter treated him like shit during the day. But at night, at night Potter spoke to him like he was a fucking human being. And Draco needed it. He needed it so much.
Draco gave him a peck on the lips. “Thank you, you’re perfect.” He said earnestly, not quite understanding what he had done to deserve the man standing before him.
As he’d grown older, he’d realised that her words didn’t matter, no, it was her actions. She could’ve just left him cry or told him to get over himself like his father had. But she didn’t. she made sure that he knew that he was loved. She made him believe that no matter what, it would all work out in the end.
For the second night in a row, Draco found himself crossed leg, sketchbook in hand, staring at the vast lake.
Draco raised a brow. “Really?” he deadpanned. “Of course, I’ve thought of the world. I bloody live there.” he told him absently.
Potter gave him a tight squeeze, “how I just love it when you cooperate.” He teased snuggling closer towards him.
He looked up, nodding his head in a cordial fashion, “Father.” He replied stoically, in somewhat of a greeting.
Potter smiled, observing Draco with interest. After several seconds he took a deep breath. “Have you ever thought of the world?” he asked.
Well, that bloody well hurt. What next? Was Severus going to berate him on his good looks and charming personality?
But what could he change? What could he change? He wondered thoughtfully. His gaze shifted, his eyes searching, before they came to rest on his slicked back hair. He raised a brow suggestively, now there was something he could change.
“Can we talk?” Potter pleaded and Draco found himself turning to his father. It was astonishing really, that his father’s approval still meant so much. He held his breath as his father raised a brow, giving him a concerned look. His father looked as if to be in deep internal debate as he turned to his mother who gave his hand a reassuring squeezed.
The person he’d always been too afraid to be. Theo’s words rattled inside his head frantically. He’d never thought about it like that. He’d just assumed that had changed, that war had morphed him into a different person.
He turned around begrudgingly to face the careful eyes of Ernie Macmillan. Did the world hate Draco? What in Merlin’s name did this joker want?
“Screw it!” he yelled taking a step closer towards him. “They’re probably worried out of their wits. But I couldn’t know because I left straight after you. I’ll always follow you.” He whispered the last part quietly.
Neville nodded. “I understand why you want to do it. Believe me I do. But please think about what you’re doing. If you can stand to look at yourself, knowing that you’ve been tainted. Knowing that you’ve taken a life. Then do it. I wouldn’t stop you. If I were a different man, I know I would do it myself.” He started and Draco froze.
There was no point arguing or dismissing a person like Potter. It would only get Draco into more trouble than he was already in, and he really didn't need the attention at the moment.
“It’s because of what I said at the end of fifth year. Draco looked away. “Well I’m not taking it back. I like you Draco. I like you a lot and I want you to know it. Hell, I want the entire wizarding world to know it.” Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Draco was a wizard, not a trophy wife.
Potter mutters a wandless spell before his inserts one finger deep into Draco’s heat. “Fuck!” Draco whimpers, arching up against him. He pushes in further and Draco clenches around this thick, lubed finger.
“I love you, and I let you go.” Draco whispered as the love of his life disappeared in a puff of smoke and a flicker of a green light.
Draco rolled his eyes, “what is it that you want that requires my undivided attention?” he asked impatiently.
He took a deep breath, praying that Merlin would give him the strength that he knew he so desperately needed. “Father?” he questioned calmly, waiting for a response. The mobile remained silent.
Just when he thought that things couldn’t get any worse, he looked up, straight into the tired eyes of Katie Bell.
real. It had always been real, even when Draco didn't want it to be. Something would simply just stop being real because he determined it to be. It didn't work like that.
And in that moment he realised that hope wasn’t just something to have in one person. It was something that he needed to have within himself. And he had hope. He
Seriously, his hair was a literal dump upon his head. He instinctively raked a hand through his locks. They were better. But not good enough. His haircastrophe had been quite alright during the war, it had given him the broken soldier kind of look. But the war was over. All he wanted was a prestige, ‘my hair’s better than yours’ look. Was that too much to ask?
Potter coughed. “Why thank you Harry, you’re the sweetest, most wonderful person that I’ve ever had the pleasure of meeting.” Draco frowned, because he
He was ready to risk his life, to lose it all in favour of doing the right thing. Of staying true to himself. That was his Hufflepuff talking. The part of him that he secretly never wanted to let go.
At least Draco didn't pretend to hide who he was, he was open about it. The Weaselette on the other hand hid behind the light, her family and Potter, shooting hexes at those who hardly deserved it claiming that it was okay because she was on the right side of the war. Bloody hypocrite!
Tomorrow was like a promise. A beacon of hope that swore to be better than today. It was something to want, to need, to fight for. Wizarding kind had spent years turning against one another, judging by the purity of ones blood, when in reality, they should’ve been worrying about the quantity of ones heart.
He coated his hands with water, slowly running them through his hair. He preened. He was no longer Draco Malfoy, Slytherin Prince, and typical Bad Boy. No, he was Draco Malfoy, profound hairstylist, and a friend to all Hufflepuff’s. He smirked, now that was a name he could get on board with.
Blaise tutted. “Now, now Pansy. No need to be so dramatic, Annie here is obviously extremely scared.” He said patronisingly.
A large part of him knew that he should be spending his time trying to execute the task that the Dark Lord had so graciously set him. But right now, he suspected he cared more about dragon dung than the noseless bastards wishes.
Draco smiled. He remembered when he was a first year and the castle seemed like a colossal, daunting establishment. He was awfully familiar of it now, but he still found it to be quite large.
Draco arched against him. The way Potter looked at him, the way his hands move demandingly over his skin, drawing him closer. It’s perfect. His body is hard and real, thrumming with heat and desire. His kisses turn more passionate, as he turns them over, gripping Draco’s arse and pulling him onto his lap.
Draco shook his head. “It’s not like that. He’s with the Weasele— I mean Girl Weasley.” He countered.
Draco couldn’t breathe. Was he brave? No. He decided. He was not. He was a coward; a braver man would’ve never taken the mark in the first place.
Ricky started to shake. “I just want to tell her that I think she’s beautiful. A girl that pretty should know.” He stated sweetly.
Kat shot him a contemplative look before sighing, “No, I don’t think so.” She decided, “I’ve seen a picture of your father in one of the wizarding newspapers. You have his nose, jaw, and colour hair. But you have her kind eyes, full lips and I’m very sure that you would’ve had her smile too.”
Draco had always loved Ravenclaw's, again, ask him to admit it and well, use your imagination. Anyways, he was going off topic, he had a plan to execute.
“Sometimes I hate you. I hate you so much. I don’t want to, but I do. I thought it was because of all the horrible things you’ve done to me. But now,
Draco narrowed his eyes at them. “So, are you both here to tell me to back the hell off?” he spat bitterly.
Several minutes later and Draco realised that no matter how much he wished it, Potter was here to stay. Reluctantly, Draco collected his artwork and got ready to leave. Like hell was he staring here with ‘I take pleasure in insulting Draco Malfoy’ Potter. He stood up quickly ready to leave when a voice stopped him in his tracks.
It had been nineteen years and his husband still never failed to get under his father’s skin. It was actually quite amusing to sit back and watch their relationship. It was the most peculiar thing he had ever witnessed.
Draco didn’t particularly like himself. Sure, he thought he was decent looking. He hair was so blond it was almost white, sprawled neatly across his head. His jaw was strong, lips red and pouted. His eyes were pools of mercury silver. Okay, he was attractive. Some may even go as far as to say drop dead gorgeous. Fine, Draco was ‘some’ but his opinion was the only one that counted. Anyhow, it helped that Draco was always right.
Her features lit up slightly, as she took a wistful breath. “Like he’s everything.” She said exasperatedly. “He’s funny. He’s thoughtful. He doesn’t treat me like I’m some freak, or that I’m any different to anybody else. He laughs whenever I crack a rare joke. He comforts me when I’m sad.” She sighed. “I think I might love him.” she admitted.
“This is the part when you tell me I was right.” Severus commented, giving Draco a smug look and Draco narrowed his eyes at him.
His friend nodded. “I know. For the better I think.” He said determinedly. “But I don’t think it’s changed you. I think it’s brought to light the person you always were but was too afraid to be.” He offered Draco.
During those first few months on the run, Harry had wanted to give up. He’d lost Draco, there was no point of carrying on without him. But after months of wallowing in his self-pity, he’d realised something.
Macmillan rubbed his palms on his robes nervously. “I wanted to say that I was sorry.” He repeated a little louder this time.
Draco sunk to his knees, tears falling down his cheeks. He’s never felt pain like it. It was as if someone had torn out his heart, leaving him with nothing but a blackened soul. His rock. His head. His heart. Was gone. And Draco didn’t know if he was ever coming back.
He opened his mouth to speak but was abruptly cut off by Hermione as she stood up. “Just think about it.” she smiled before she was gone in a flare of robes.
Nevertheless, Draco’s eyes filled with tears and he wondered what he had done to deserve such a beautiful friend.
“Stop!” A voice yelled, and Draco turned to face no other than Neville Longbottom. His face was bloody, his clothes were ripped and torn.
“I brought you some chicken.” Weasley offered sheepishly, handing him two freshly cooked chicken drumsticks.
“You can’t run away anymore.” He said with confidence. “I’m not going to let you.” his words were laced with an unspoken promise.
Potter turned to face him. “I still can’t figure you out Malfoy.” He accused light-heartedly. “You’ve been a complete git to me for the past few years. But this year, this year you’re different.” He contemplated. Really? He hadn’t noticed. Please carry on with your first-year observations, they’re ever so informative.
They sat in peaceful silence for a while with Draco absently aware of the warm heat rubbing off Potter. It was quite distracting.
She raised a confident brow, “let me guess, does a Mr Potter have anything to do with your current predicament?” she questioned knowingly.
She gave him a curt nod. “Yes.” She answered simply, with a hint of suspicion. “May I ask why you’re here?” she questioned. Her voice was tired, and Draco’s heart broke for her.
Moaning Myrtle. He'd heard all about her, but he'd only managed to catch a few glimpses of her over the years. That was mainly due to the fact that she hardly ever left her bathroom. And well, it wasn't as if Draco was actively looking for her. She wasn't someone that you particularly wanted to find.
he believed in. If there was no one left to fight for, then he’d make something to fight for. He’d been naïve. There was
“Okay.” Theo said as Draco started walking towards the bathroom, promptly ignoring Potter’s angry gaze burning holes in his back.
Draco waved his hands manically, “This is so fucking typical! The only time you four bloody agree is when you’re rallying against me.” He bit out, glaring at Weasley.
Theo scoffed. “I really don’t think that Weasley will show up, especially after the stunt that Potter pulled earlier.” he told him.
“But that’s three days away.” Jerry complained and Draco wanted to strangle him. The boy Just. Did. Not. Shut. Up!
Draco attempted to speak but she cut him off with a wave of her hand. “If this were even a few months ago, you wouldn’t have been able to string a sentence together without calling me a
“I apologise that I haven’t visited sooner. Everything’s just been a little too… much lately.” He replied as honestly as he could.
Potter racked his free hand through his messy curls. “It’s me Draco. It’s me. Can’t you see? Don’t you know? Don’t you remember?” He sobbed through tears.
It’s not like he didn’t like the Hufflepuff’s, because he did. It was just whenever they were around it was always: Draco let’s play a game, or Draco let’s preach about happiness or kindness, or Draco does He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named really look like a reptile? In which he answered no, piss off and shut the fuck up.
“What do you mean you’re not close anymore?” he asked, Macmillan's answer being far from what he had expected.
He put a hand on his hip. “If you were wondering, I get up every day to fix my luscious locks. Do you think that
Draco took a deep breath, ready to bare all to a girl he hardly knew. “I really don’t want to do this anymore.” He cried out, pacing around the bathroom.
“And now,” he carried on, “now you’re bloody telling me that I have to give Kat the portkey and maybe never see her again.” He roared, his face plastered with complete despair.
Draco howls. “Come Potter, fill me up with your come. Make me yours. Mark me. Mark me.” He screamed as Potter fucked him twice more before he too was coming in great waves inside Draco.
What could his father, a convicted criminal and somewhat fugitive want with Draco? It must be important if he was risking capture in order to speak to him.
“But you’re miserable darling.” Pansy stated knowingly as they sat in the drawing room of the manor. A platter of tea, sandwiches and biscuits were sitting quietly between them.
Draco was sitting at the Slytherin table in the Great Hall when the Malfoy family owl landed right in front of him.
Draco woke up with a smile on his face absently noticing that he was in an actual bed, as he felt strong arms pull him in closer.
“Help me out here Malfoy!” he said exasperatedly. “You’re quiet and meek. You don’t taunt nor talk to me. You have a bunch of Hufflepuff's following you around as if you were Merlin himself. I just don’t understand it.” Neither did he, neither did he.
And maybe, they were the teeny weeniest bit funny. Okay, they were extremely funny. It wasn't his fault that he was hilarious.
He missed his mother dearly. He even missed his father. But they’d never had a Christmas like this. Despite how wonderful the Christmas were when he’d been younger, they’d never been this… warm.
Luna shook her head, “don’t worry Draco, it takes some time to accept, but when you do, you’ll never feel freer.” She reassured him.
In the meantime, Weasley and Hermione had appeared behind Potter, them both shooting him concerned looks. He knew that they just wanted to help him, but their somewhat helpful looks weren’t helping his current situation.
She nodded enthusiastically. “Oh, yes. Something good is going to happen tomorrow, I can feel it.” she said in wonder.
Potter smiled, before his eyes grew wide in realization, as remembrance adorably washed over his face.
That made his heart swell. Draco loved his mother more than anything, she had always been the one person that had stuck by him through thick and thin. The
Potter kissed the line of his jaw, in long haughty sucks, his stubble contradicting with the softness of his mouth. Potter tore off his robe, slipping a hand underneath his shirt, his fingers rough and possessive as they slide over his skin, Potter latches his mouth back onto Draco’s, their tongues colliding in a whirl of heat, feverish and strong, them both battling for dominance.
Jerry gave him a confused look, “But you don’t have a lot of friends Draco.” he said almost innocently.
His father blinked a few times, taking in his broken state. “Draco, I really think this outburst is completely unjust and inappropriate.” He spat out and Draco’s blood turned to stone.
“I can’t be sure.” He said with a shaky breath. He’d made his choice. The one that he would always make. He realised that it had never really been a choice. No, it was an action. One that he had carried out.
In fact he had to poke the eyes out of every single straight man in this school. Actually, screw the school, he was poking the whole world's eyes out.
, I was just getting to that.” He took a deep breath. “As you know we have just over fifteen Muggleborns at Hogwarts, Kat being one of them.” He smiled at her and she preened.
He couldn’t. He knew deep down that his father loved him. That he wanted nothing but the best for him, despite the twisted way in which he showed that. He’d been so close to loosing everything. He
She smiled widely. “That’s okay.” Her smile grew even larger. “If you want, when you die, you can share my toilet.” She said with glee and Draco felt sick.
He beamed at her. “Very much. It’s got many potions that I didn’t know even existed.” He exclaimed excitedly.
tell me what I feel for you. You’re my rock. You’re the reason I wake up in the mornings. Why I keep on fighting. You saved me Draco.” He whispered before bringing him for a kiss.
Blaise tutted. “Now, now Draco let’s not take extreme measures.” he told him almost condescendingly and Draco was
He took a deep breath. “Kind of. It’s a portkey. But after it activates it becomes just an ordinary ring.” He started and Potter looked at him sceptically. “It’s a promise. I charmed it to bare my magical signature. So that you always have a piece of me with you. That you remember that no matter where you are or who you’re with, I love you.” He said with a shaky breath and Potter’s eyes widened.
Draco sexually confused because of Harry Potter? Now, Draco had heard it all. He was convinced that his father had gone crazy. Azkaban does that to a person.
.’ The same four words that he had written so long ago. The same for words that he had meant with all his heart.
Whoever thought that it was a great idea to make a vanishing cabinet should be publicly shunned. How in Merlin’s name did the psychotic Lord expect Draco to fix a however bloody old cabinet and let the Death Eaters into Hogwarts. Let’s not forget the whole assassinating his Headmaster thing he had going on as well.
“There comes a time when we must all face the choice between what is right and what is easy.” The Headmaster spoke steadily.
He saw the lifeless figures of Mr Lupin and what appeared to be his wife, his cousin, their bodies broken and crumpled, lying side by side. In that moment, Draco felt horrible for his past behaviour towards his teacher. He’d never apologised. He never would get to apologise. That realisation tore at what was left of his heart.
What could he possibly say to that? It was raw, vulnerable, loving, and Draco could say absolutely nothing. He wanted to say something.
Draco looked at his father in complete bafflement. He was so confused. “Aren’t you mad?” he couldn’t help but ask.
Potter growled, if looks could kill, Theo would be dead three times over. “I don’t think you want to do that, Malfoy.” Potter snarled; his voice promised threat.
He felt a soft pulse on his chest, it warming him up all over. Confused, Draco’s hands latched onto a chain that hung round his chest. He pulled on it, lifting it as it revealed a sliver ring hanging from the other end. It was
Suddenly, he felt a large weight slip from his fingers. His eyes snapped open, as he watched his friend plummet into the fire below, in pure horror. What had he done? He didn’t save him. He couldn’t save anyone. He couldn’t even save himself.
, there were in fact, a good number of Slytherin’s who seemed to be fighting with the light. Against the Death Eater’s. But in comparison to the students of the other houses, that particular figure appeared to be in the minority.
Well, she had nothing to be ashamed of, and he was determined to make her see that. He lifted her chin gently, so that her eyes were locked onto his. “Now you listen to me and you listen to me closely.” He told her seriously.
“You make me happy.” He said sincerely because she did. “Now, I have to work on my potions project, so why don’t you go back to the Hufflepuff dorms and I’ll see you tomorrow?” he offered.
Draco took a deep breath, lowering himself onto his knees so that he was eye level with the small girl. “Something’s happened. Something’s going to happen, and I need you to listen to me. I need you to do as I say.” He said seriously.
Ms Pritchett took a step back, collapsing into an armchair. Her face was red, her eyes were puffy with tears. She looked to be in a state of disbelief. “No. I don’t believe you. It can’t be true. It
“You’re alive.” he whispered almost disbelievingly to Potter as they entered an abandoned classroom. Draco didn’t know what to feel. His emotions were all over the place. They were
Although, he already knew that he was an absmayl excuse for a human being. Where he could do better he would. He
Potter took a deep breath before carrying on. “But I’m not that person. I’ve never been that person. I don’t think I’ll ever be that person.” Potter’s voice cracked, and Draco felt sick. He didn’t want this. He couldn’t do this. But he would. He had to.
to be coming to an end.” Draco commented. “Because why else would Ronald Billius Weasley actually be doing potions work?” he teased.
Draco gave her an apologetic look. “Sorry, Blaise conveniently forgot to tell me that you were waiting out here.” He said, internally think of all the ways that Blaise could 'accidently' trip down the stairs.
Couldn’t a man plan an assassination in peace around here? It had been a day. A day since the ‘Potter tried to provoke him by using first year insults’ incident. Draco cringed. He’d have to work on the name later.
Draco looked at him with disinterest, he was getting bored now. “Yes, yes Weasley was incapable of maintaining a stable relationship.” He mocked. “You’re missing the fact here.” Macmillan gave him a confused look.
Potter shifted in his seat, “I want to believe that it’s because you’ve changed. That it’s because you’re different now. But I can’t.” he admitted, and Draco's heart sunk.
He let out a low cough, “so is anybody going to comment on how awkward this all is?” he asked looking around. They remained silent, “No? Just me?” he bit out sarcastically.
He took a deep breath, “and most of all, I hate how much I love you. And I hate myself because I don’t know why. I can’t remember why I love you, and that hurts more than you can imagine.” A single tear rolled down his cheek, and he felt truly powerless.
During the day Potter acted as if Draco was worthless, as if he were nothing. He laughed at the jabs Weasley threw at him during potions, he smiled when Draco was hexed. He rolled his eyes when Draco spoke, he growled whenever he was around friends.
In fact, he had just finished writing a letter to Potter. He had been desperate. He needed someone to listen. Anyone.
“Well there was that one time you shaved all of Blaise’s hair off because you feared it was nicer than yours.” Pansy countered.
He shrugged. “Why change perfection?” he preened, not believing his words in the slightest. But they were funny, nevertheless.
“Why don’t you care Draco?” she screamed. “Ever since we’ve been back, you’ve done nothing but not care.” Draco opened his mouth to protest but was abruptly cut off. “And don’t give me some bullshit of us only being back for two days. I know you Draco Malfoy. I know every action you make before you make it. I know what you think before you think it.” She hissed.
Pansy had carried on, “So, is this, or is this not all your fault, because you’re a stubborn little git?” she asked smugly, to which Draco had replied with a simple “Fuck you”.
“Oh look, there’s Aunt Hermione and Uncle Ron.” Harry gestured to the couple who were giving their daughter Rose a tight squeeze, snapping him from his thoughts.
He shrugged with disinterest. “What’s it to you?” he asked with a slightly accusatory edge to his voice.
“I’m sorry.” Potter whispered and Draco entwined his fingers with Potter’s giving them a tight squeeze.
Tears were falling freely as he set down a single white rose onto the mound. “You made me happy. You will always make me so, so happy.” He finished before holding the ring that hung from his neck close, as he let his grief take over.
That hardly mattered. He felt his restraint dwindle as he glanced at the arm where the dark mark lay, covered by his robes. He was no longer Draco Malfoy, Slytherin Prince. He was weak. A follower. He wasn’t anything but a single choice.
“This one.” Draco excitedly said. “And this one.” He decided. “Oh, and let’s not forget about this one.” He commented throwing yet another box of chocolate on the outrageously large pile in Theo’s hands.
Draco gave him a confused look. “What the hell is that?” he bit out, giving the contraption a once over, shivering slightly.
Draco laughed before walking them towards the till. “I guess I’m paying for all of this?” Theo asked as if it were even a question.
Well, obviously they didn’t. Oh no, they’d all made it their secret missions to baffle him to the point that there was no return. It was all extremely rude if you asked him.
No one had ever looked at him the way Potter was looking at him now. It was deeply unsettling. Draco didn’t deserve it. That look wasn’t his, it was probably reserved only for the Weaselette, and he’d stolen it.
Kat shook her head slightly as if she were coming to a realisation, “I don’t think that you’re a bad person.”
Weasley narrowed his eyes slightly, rubbing hand on his freckled forehead. “That doesn’t sound like you.” He accused.
He gave her a strong hug, mumbling absently into her hair. “It’s okay. It’s all going to be alright. I promise.” He assured the quivering girl.
He thought of his mother locked up in the Manor, scared out of her wits. He thought of his father locked up in Azkaban fighting to get out and back to his family. Draco sighed, he bore it, so they didn’t have to.
“Is that supposed to upset me?” he narrowed his eyes at her. “if you hadn’t noticed, I couldn’t care less.” His lips curled into a sneer as he watched her waver, “now if we’re quite done, I’d like to go to bed.”
It sickened him that in a few days’ time, Draco would betray the man he cared most about. It had to be done. There was no other choice.
The rest of the battle had taken place with thankfully minimal losses. It was if Potter’s fantastical emergence when times had looked bleak, had given the light a newfound strength. Everyone was more determined than ever, hurtling hexes, shooting jinxes, and throwing curses like there was no tomorrow. Draco muses that if the Dark had won, then there wouldn’t have been much point in tomorrow.
Suddenly he froze, as he came across a folded piece of parchment in her front pocket. With shaky hands he pulled it out, unfolding it.
His mother pulled him into a tight squeeze. “You know, there was a time when I believed that you would never say that.” She said honestly, and Draco’s cheeks started to warm up.
He was laying atop of his bed in the Slytherin dorms, thinking about his pathetic, pathetic life. When suddenly, Potter burst through the doors, dramatically lying down on Draco’s bed. What was he doing here? And how the hell did he know the password to get in?
Draco’s pleas were drowned out as his wand fell from his grasp. He clumsily picked it up, turning to face a complete battle.
Draco let go of the body as two warm hands wrapped him into a strong embrace. “It’s okay. It’s okay.” The loving voice of Mrs Weasley repeated over and over soothingly.
She shook her head, “I guess not. Would it be so hard to believe that I genuinely wanted to sit with you.” She queried, and for the first time Draco Malfoy wondered if Hermione Granger was stupid.
Pansy shook her head, “nothing.” She said before lying down next to Draco, Blaise sitting by their feet.
Potter seemed to be the one person he couldn’t forget. The one person he could never get out of his mind. It was as if Draco was drawn to him. Part of him couldn’t imagine his life without Potter, and that scared him. It scared him more than death.
Suddenly, two arms wrapped around his waist, picking him up and turning him around. Draco’s heart stopped as he looked into the eyes of Harry Potter. Silvery grey on emerald green. He could hardly believe his eyes.
Weasley nodded. “Of course, I did, Malfoy loves chicken.” He said proudly shoving a piece of chicken it his fat gob.
Draco grimaced slightly before looking away. He didn’t have time for Potter this year. The days of antagonising Potter were long behind him, he had far more pressing matters to attend to.
Potter gave him a quick peck on the lips. “Was last night okay?” he asked shyly and Draco wholeheartedly couldn't put into words how good it had been.
Theo took a step closer towards him, “I had a really good time today.” He said shyly, his face close to Draco’s.
Myrtle screamed. “Bad man, bad man. Stay away from Draco. Stay away!” she yelled frantically, and Draco felt the need to console the frightened girl.
This girl had only known him for just over two days, and already she was buying him gifts, doing all that was in her power to make him smile. It was kindness that he shouldn't have and quite honestly, a kindness that he didn't deserve.
His head was killing him, his limbs were hurting, his chest felt heavy. Had it all been a dream? Was Crabbe still alive?
Potter let out a defeated sigh, “can’t you see? It is my concern. Everything you do is my concern. You will never not be my concern. Draco please listen to me.” He begged.
And that was why Draco was currently sitting on his bed surrounded by glitter, paper and presents, silently praying that the Dark Lord would come to his senses and AK his fine arse.
“Still a bothersome fool?” Draco shot right back and they both paused for several seconds before bursting into a round of laughter.
He hums feverishly sucking up and down his shaft. “I can’t wait. Ahhhh. I need to be in you Now!” he shouted and Draco nodded frantically. His head fell back. He couldn’t think of anything except how good it felt to have Potter touch him that way. So, demanding. Plentiful with want and need.
Potter chuckled, “I think dinner’s ready.” He commented looking solely at Draco which made his heart thump. He hated the effect that Potter continued to have on him.
“Because you’re the most amazing best friend that I could ever ask for.” She cried pulling him into another hug.
what to tell her. He’d tell her to stick her little feelings and intuitions somewhere Draco would never find them. Thinking that she could act all warm and comforting, and he would tell her everything.
He glared at him. “That’s what I said.” Draco pointed out, his attention still on the device. It was just so immersing, so complicated, He felt it his duty to figure it out. Nothing was too big for Draco Malfoy to figure out. He was sure of it.
It still surprised Draco to no end that Ms Pritchett was willing to befriend Draco, after the mess he’d gotten them into. But she had. In fact, she visit the manor at least three times a week without fail. They’d converse, laugh, and visit Kat’s grave, remembering all the beautiful things that she had represented. It was a friendship he’d never realised he’d needed but was so desperately thankful for having.
It all seemed to be a waste of his time. He felt long for all the things he could be doing at this very moment, if only he didn't have to listen to Pansy act like a complete and utter bitch to be frank.
She locked eyes with Draco, and he gave a small reassuring nod. She continued, “But now, now we get to experience
The first thing he noticed was that she looked quite similar to his mother. Despite her brown locks and thin lips, in many respects they could’ve passed as twins. The second thing he noticed was that she was carrying a small child in her arms.
Draco rolled his eyes, “can’t you see that I was in the middle of something.” He narrowed his eyes at his godfather.
He couldn’t speak to Potter. He would never speak to Potter. He knew that he didn’t deserve to. The second he spoke to Potter he’d be giving in. He’d give into a pleasure that a Death Eater like himself didn’t deserve.
. Draco could understand that. He could really understand that. He tried to picture himself in Potter's shoes, tried to feel what he possible felt.
“I heard about the little Hufflepuff mudblood, ghastly thing is young death.” He remarked and Draco’s teeth clenched at the mention of the word ‘mudblood’.
Seriously, that thing needed to be locked away in Azkaban or something, he was sure the sheer vulgarity of it was breaking at least some laws.
They were completely lost in one another. Every smell, every touch, every taste, was all Potter. Their tongues twirled fiercely together, as if fighting for dominance. His lips were red, hot, and enticing, and Draco couldn’t get enough of it, as he tugged on Potter’s hair pulling him even closer.
Draco shook his head. “But I don’t want to.” He mumbled deciding that this wasn't up to her or anybody else.
Draco gulped. He had to do this, he had to push her away. He had no choice. He had to protect her, he loved her. And love was weakness.
The room was spinning, his head was pulsing. The blood running through his veins was cold as ice, the magic thrumming through his core stilled. He’d never felt anything like it, it was as if all his strength, all his magic, was slowly leaving his body.
.” He breathed for the first time and Harry froze. “There’s nothing you can say or do that will change my mind. I have to stay. I’m a liability at your side and we both know it.” he said rationally.
He turned to face his boyfriend, because of course it was. Somehow Potter always knew when he was upset, was always there when he needed comfort and a shoulder to cry on. It was more than he deserved.
The love he felt for Potter was so intense he had no idea how he’d ever come to feel it. He may never remember how he’d come to feel it. But before he gave himself wholly to Potter, he had to understand
Hermione took a deep breath, “All I’m hearing is that he doesn’t remember you.” She started and Harry opened his mouth to tell her that, yes that was the point, but she quickly cut him off. “He doesn’t hate you. Or is going against you. He hasn’t fallen out of love with you. The Draco that you know is still in there.
It had been months since those joyous few weeks that were the Christmas holidays, and it was now only a couple of weeks before the end of the school year.
Malfoy. Why are you doing this to me? Why are you making me feel so much? I can’t stand it, just make it stop. Please make it stop.” he almost begged.
But what happened when there was no hope left? What happened when the light burned out? There would be darkness, only darkness. And Draco was engulfed in it.
Broken, he collapsed onto the floor and was quickly engulfed into the tight heat of Hermione’s arms. He started to sob, big, painful tears were running down his cheeks, showing no sign of stopping.
“Over my dead body.” She spat out, before turning her attention back to the matter at hand. “Face it you and Harry are head over heels in love with each other, nothing can change my mind.” She said stubbornly.
Draco was breaking a sweat. He was fascinated. What was in this thing? He’d heard from a friend that it made toast. But Draco couldn’t find the bread. Where was it?
Draco gave her a smile. “I’m more alive than I’ve ever been.” He reassured her and the other Hufflepuff's as best as he possibly could.
“NOOO!” He shrieked, crawling towards his best friend. He dragged him broken body along, ignoring the sheer agony of it. That didn’t matter, none of it mattered. He was close, so, so close. He didn’t care what he had to do. What he had to endure. As long as she remained safe.
He sighed. “He knows about the mark. But not about my task, not about what I’m going to do.” He told her.
Draco groaned at the statement, heat pooling between his legs. “You’ve had it before?” he asked, conscious of the slight edge to his voice.
He knew from their tired smiles that something was wrong. That something was going to happen. He made his way towards them, with something acute to dread pooling in his stomach.
He thought he’d been doing it to keep his mother safe. To keep his family safe. He didn’t know anymore. Was it a lie? Had it all been a lie?
He sighed, “Perhaps they were right, you should stay away from me.” He put his clammy hands into the pockets of his robes. “I’m not a good person.” He added for good measure.
If Draco’s hair was long enough to flick, then he’d have flicked it right about now. “Don’t worry, it’ll fit and you have the Malfoy genes to thank for that.” He boasted.
“You made me feel safe. You made me feel accepted. It was as if I was an actual human being. I’ve never believed in platonic soulmates, but after meeting you, I now know for sure that they do in fact exist.”
“Oh yes, definitely.” He answered. “They were terribly incompatible.” Mainly because Weasley is so besotted with Hermione to even try to give himself wholly to another girl, but Draco decided to keep that part to himself.
“Are you going to ignore me like you’ve been ignoring me since the beginning of the year?” Potter questioned.
Kat looked down in disappointment. “Oh” she muttered and Draco felt horrible for his Hufflepuff's, he looked at Madam Pomfrey hopefully who sighed.
Harry paused for a moment, digesting everything she had to say. He supposed that she wasn’t entirely wrong. Draco still loved him; Harry was sure of it. He’d just forgotten.
“Is it?” Draco asked, albeit shyly. It wasn't okay to be sad. It was never okay to be sad. It left one too open, to vulnerable. Something that he couldn't afford to be.
It was only eight in the morning and Draco was already contemplating death. No seriously, was it even possibly to AK oneself?
He guessed he could understand it. People dealt with things in different ways. It didn't mean they were right, but it also didn't mean that their actions were beyond understanding.
The Astronomy tower was dark and grey, it almost lifeless except from the Headmaster who stood before him. The man was weak and frail, struggling to stand up right.
condone the soft kitten that you’ve turned my son into.” Draco sneaked a glance at his husband who was trying and failing to suppress a laugh.
Draco was attempting to put pencil to parchment yet again without much success. It was a travesty. A catastrophe. How dare the artistic side of his brain refuse to generate any ideas that weren’t related to death, blood, gore, darkness, death, anger, pain, and oh yes did he mention death?
Draco kept his gaze fixed firmly on the ground. Of course, he was going to ignore Potter. It was convenient. It was needed.
He gulped, that was all that he wanted to hear. But he needed to stay strong, for Potter and himself. “I hope that’s true.” He said honestly. “But I need you to do this. I need to do this.” He finished.
His aunt started to shake violently with laughter. “Oh, likkle baby Draco, has finally come to play.” She shrilled turning around to face him, a sick glint residing in her eyes. “But you’re being rude, you haven’t said hello to our guest.” She grinned before turning the tiny figure to face him.
Draco felt his cheeks start to heat up. As he gazed down at the little girl who made him feel so safe.
He felt his eyes well up with tears as he came across the body of Colin Creevey. Sure, he had been annoying, but he didn’t deserve this. No one deserved this…
Out of pure luck, he’d found Potter, which is why, he was currently standing in front of him, wand raised and poker face on. “Give me back my wand Potter.” He attempted to spit out, internally pitying his mortifying excuse.
She cried, pulling him into a hug full of tears, love, and trust. “You make me happy too.” She murmured into his ear.
He couldn't possibly believe that. Draco Lucius Malfoy, the esteemed Slytherin Prince giving up the password. To a Gryffindor at that. No, he just wouldn't accept it.
“There you are!” Kat sighed out as soon as Draco got outside. “I thought that you’d never come out.” she walked up to him quickly, a giant smile lighting up her entire face.
The first year’s rounded on Ernie Macmillan, pointing their wands at him in challenge. Macmillan squealed putting up his hands in defeat. Kat hissed at him before turning on her heel running towards Draco, the other Hufflepuff’s following suit.
“Me too. Me too, sweet girl.” He mumbled into her shoulder. “But I swear that when you see me again, it’ll be as if no time has gone by at all.” he reassured her.
This one was clever, but not clever enough. That was questionable actually considering she was a Ravenclaw. Didn't they have to solve riddles to gain access into their common room or something?
“You make me feel safe.” Potter started to read out loud, “when I’m with you, I feel nothing but happiness. I feel wanted. Need. As if I’m not alone.” Potter looked up at Draco with wide eyes, and Draco gestured for him to continue.
Kat’s eyes widened in fear. “Draco, what’s going on? You’re scaring me.” She sobbed and he felt awful.
Draco melted into the kiss. It was fierce, desperate, and needy. It was tangy and sweet, expressing all that they couldn’t find the words to say. It was passionate but refined. Slow but long.
Was he blind or just stupid? “Obviously, I was having a lovely breakfast with my new Hufflepuff friend before you rudely interrupted.”
Draco furrowed his eyebrows, feeling quite confused, “what does me being a Slytherin have anything to do with me hurting you?”
He chuckled. “It’s an alarm clock.” Draco raised a confused brow. “It’s muggle.” Potter carried on and Draco beamed.
Madam Pomfrey smiled at Kat. “As lovely as your war chants sound, Mr Malfoy has to rest.” She informed them pointedly and their faces fell.
One that if executed correctly would potentially aid the wizarding world. Successful or not, his plan only meant heartbreak for Draco.
He looked up at Harry’s broken green eyes before shoving the ring into his hand and pushing him into Hermione and Weasley, who both shot him smiles that were full of reassurance and forgiveness.
He gave him a serious look, “think about it son, you’re a smart boy. You’re a Malfoy after all. Who do you know with occlumency training that would obliviate you so expertly that you remembered everything about your life
Draco felt sick at the reality of her words. He reasoned that there may be a little truth to what she was saying, but still, he shot her a defiant look. “And pray tell, what problem may that be?” he asked, whilst subtly trying the appear to have minimal interest in the subject.
“Detached my pearly white arsehole. Seriously Draco, it’s been a over a month and you haven’t left this depressing Manor.” She chided him gently.
Merlin! The woman was acting like he’d been ignoring her for all of her life. It was extremely unhealthy if you asked him.
Nathan narrowed his eyes at him. “Really? Because that is exactly what a crazy person would say.” He declared, and yes it was decided, he was officially a crazy person.
Green eyes met grey as Potter stared right back at him. He raised a defiant eyebrow, his lips curling into a twisted snarl. Draco sighed; he was disappointed but not surprised. He thought that just maybe things had changed between them last night. Evidently, he was wrong.
Weasley huffed in annoyance, “and when is that?” he prodded and the ginger haired freak was really starting to test Draco's patience.
Potter was sitting at the Gryffindor table laughing at something Weasley had said. The Weaselette was seated next to him, hanging off his arm. Draco didn’t quite understand as to why they were sitting so close, it was extremely unflattering.
Kat beamed when she saw him. “Oh, Draco! They said that you were still alive but I just didn’t believe them.” She said sadly, and his heart broke for the hundredth time that day.
His hand was on the door when the Headmaster called out “Mr Malfoy.” Draco turned back round. “Please do look into controlling your Hufflepuff's, we wouldn’t want anyone else to suffer how poor Mr Smith has suffered today.” His eyes twinkled with mischief.
growled at him, as she pointed her wand at him accusingly. “Of course, it’s a good idea. We spoke to Kat’s mum,” she started, and they both winced at the name. “She told us what happened to Kat but also how happy was in the Draco Malfoy Pride.” She stated and Draco hung his head down in shame.
And Draco took a deep breath, preparing to keep this alteration in his memory bank for future stories.
He couldn't lie to her. Not anymore. Especially when she'd shown nothing but concern for his wellbeing. What kind of person did that make him?
She’d come over, a frown dusting her features and say, ‘Draconis, I took nine months to form your heart, do not let yourself or anyone break it in fifteen seconds.’
*Weeps into chocolate* Well, that hurt. I actually cried when I wrote this. It had to be done. I know it looks bleak but Drarry WILL get their happy ending! A lil teaser for next chapter: … :(
Draco shook his head, taking a hesitant step towards her. “I’m not going to hurt you; I promised didn’t I?” he tried his best to shoot her a reassuring smile.
Anyways, the cabinet was more or less fixed, and Death Eaters were planning their descent into Hogwarts. Father would be proud. Mother would be reeling. And Draco… well Draco, he was disgusted with himself.
Draco took a few moments to come back to himself. Had they been that obvious? How was everyone else so sure about what he had with Potter, whilst he was more confused than ever?
Draco felt his heart stop, the name sending shivers down his spine. “I’m fine.” He said simply as he attempted to come across emotionless.
That had resulted in him bringing food to the prisoner’s only at night. On the rare occasions that he was caught, he’d crucio them. Well, by crucio he’d say the words as they skilfully pretended to writher in unbearable pain. Every prisoner was taught how to successfully fake a crucioing on their first night at the Manor.
It was the first time he’d been to Diagon Alley in months. After that talk with Pansy, Draco reasoned that he need to think. And a stuffy manor full of uncomfortable memories wasn’t the best place to do that.
Potter shrugged. “It’s been almost two weeks Malfoy, are you still not going to speak to me?” he asked.
Potter narrowed his eyes at her. “Calm down?” he snarled. “You want me to fucking clam down.” He swore. “Well, guess fucking what. I’m. Not. Fucking. Calm.”
His father was okay with him being gay? His father had sort of made peace that he was dating Potter? Draco wasn’t even dating Potter for Merlin’s sake!
Hermione slapped him again. “Not an actual elephant.” She corrected. “I meant Harry.” she stated and when Weasley's baffled gaze cease to leave, Draco pitied his friend.
Draco broke down. He felt so broken. So, defeated. Potter was gone. His mother had tears in her eyes. She was looking at him as if he would break, love alive in her eyes. She had been the one who’d held him when he’d cried. Who’d picked him up when he’d fallen. Who told him that she loved him every night before bed. His mother, who he loved more than anyone else on this world.
Seven of then still remained. Sitting comfortably at the Slytherin table as if they owned the place. Bloody Hufflepuff's!
appreciate this invasion of privacy, he thought as he pushed her arm off. Especially when he was being attacked by who he thought were his best friends.
He sighed a defeated sigh. “Fine, Draco, you was right and I was wrong.” he admitted and Draco preened, because
Determinedly, he ran towards her, the hexes flying towards him didn’t seem to matter all that much anymore. A Death Eater had spotted her, snarling as he made his way towards the quivering girl, his wand drawn in threat.
He thought this was a joke? The nerve on him! Draco had two minds to hex him to the point of no return.
Pansy gave him a look full of pity, placing her hand atop of his in comfort. “I know that I’ll never be able to understand what you’re going through.” She started intently. “But what I
Draco grinned. “I’m going to show them that I’m not the big, bad evil Slytherin that they think I am. And maybe if they understand that then they’d want to be your friend, and you’d want to be theirs.” He finished.
He raised a brow. “And I will not be treated like a puppet.” He glared defiantly at his father. “Oops.” He mocked. “It appears I already am.” He snarled, satisfied with his defiance.
“May I sit here?” his aunt asked and Draco nodded, gesturing for her to sit. He was only waiting for Mr Weasley and that wonderous blue rubber duck anyways.
Theo growled. “Stop acting dumb. Stop pretending that you don’t know what I’m talking about. You know
So, it appeared Draco was wrong. Crap. He really thought he had something with the whole hair products guess.
He wasn’t just fighting for himself. He was fighting for the lives she’d ruined, for the lives she’d yet to ruin. For the lives she’d taken. For Kat…
Another presence dragged him from his thoughts. Draco turned to face the intruder and found himself looking into big black eyes.
He shook his head. “No, I don’t mean like that.” He started. “I mean really thought about it. Of how it houses so many different beings. Of how every part is too big to explore in a lifetime. Of how wonderful it is.” He spoke passionately, and his wonder made Draco's heart squeeze.
Draco took a deep breath and plastered on a fake smile he prayed appeared real, “I’m fine.” He answered simply.
Potter glanced at him expectantly before sighing in defeat. “I guess not. That’s okay though. I like your presence anyways.” He decided and Draco wondered what the hell he was on about.
His bed was uncomfortable. Why in Merlin’s name were satin sheets uncomfortable? What was the point in buying the best if it still wasn’t good enough? It was decided. Screw being a Potions Master! Draco was going to become a satin sheet expert, and that was that.
She shook her head. “Don’t be silly Draco, you saw me yesterday morning. That was over twenty-four hours ago.” She commented and Draco found that he couldn’t fault her logic.
In the few weeks since their first interaction, Draco and Ms Pritchett had become fast friends. She reminded him so much of Kat, and not just in physical attributes. No, it was clear that Kat’s kindness, optimism, and love had all been traits inherited from her mother.
He sniffled, taking a deep breath before pulling up his sleeve. Pansy gasped when she saw the mark, her eyes welling with tears.
He couldn't do this anymore. He just couldn't. The resentment that he felt for his father had become all too much to handle. He had to get it out. He had to let it
She gasped. “Why would they want to hurt me? I haven’t done anything to them.” She cried out with worry.
And Kat. Sweet, little, adorable Kat. They were attached from the hip. There wasn’t Draco if Kat weren’t there to guide and help him. She’d even dyed her hair Slytherin green just a couple of days ago, and Draco couldn’t be prouder of his Slytherpuff.
“I’m Katerina” she started, “but you can just call me Kat.” She held out a hesitant hand which Draco gladly took.
Blaise shook his head. “That sounds absolutely marvellous, but you know what? I think I’ll pass.” He mocked. “Besides, these beautiful smooth hands weren’t made for manual labour.” He said whilst admiring his hands.
Potter smiled at him before handing him a neatly wrapped present. Draco’s fingers shook as he carefully unwrapped the present to find a ring attached to a necklace. He gasped, his hands flying to his mouth.
But to see this, to see him on the verge of some sort of breakdown. Well, Draco couldn't put into words exactly how he felt.
So instead of buying only several presents for the seven people that mattered in his life, NO Draco had brought a sickening thirty-two presents!
Theo’s lips were chapped. Moving against Draco’s with small strokes. It hesitant, careful, and soft. There was hardly any tongue. There was no emotion, no passion. There was none of that. It was just…nice.
Draco hated himself. He hated that he’d let his guard down. That he’d been naïve enough to feed into Potter’s words. To be vulnerable with him, to almost open up to him. He’d been a fool.
“Shushhhh.” His mother whispered softly, “what do I always tell you Draconis Lucius Malfoy?” she asked expectantly.
“Oh, please do think about this logically Draco. There wasn’t a moment when you didn’t speak about Potter. You even found yourself in the room as soon as his name was mentioned. It was quite obvious that you hated him for a different reason then you let everyone think.” His father boasted.
He’d made the biggest mistake of his life for his father. And he didn’t care. His father couldn’t care less. And that hurt. It hurt so damn much.
Potter huffed. “For fucks sake Malfoy. I’m speaking to you.” Really? Draco mused. He hadn’t bloody well noticed.
“Draco, wait up.” Theo’s suggestive voice stopped him in his tracks as he turned away from the common room door. “Where are you going?”
Kat nodded. “Alright, I’ll see you tomorrow Draco.” She grinned before speeding off down the corridor.
Did he look okay? He'd just been shouted at in front of the entire school. He was scared, embarrassed, ashamed, And don't even get him starting on the whole mess that was Harry Potter.
Draco couldn’t do much. He was living with the Dark Lord himself, after all. But what little he could do, he did.
It was all his fault. Why was it always his fault? Why wasn’t he Potter? Why couldn’t be Harry sodding Potter Saviour of the bloody Wizarding World. Why did he have to be Draco Lucius Malfoy? Why was his father a Death Eater? Why was Draco expected to become a Death Eater. To always be a Death Eater.
Kat’s eyes turned to stone. “Ever since someone thought it was okay to harm our Draco.” She growled and the other Hufflepuff's nodded frantically, their eyes ablaze with an anger that Draco had no idea that Hufflepuff's were even capable of.
Draco stared down at the raised mound in front of him. A wooden cross lay hauntedly in front of it. He would add a gravestone in a years’ time. Hopefully.
It made him paranoid, double checking his every move. He couldn't eat, he couldn't sleep. It were if the attention were an ocean, and he was slowly and painfully drowning in it.
Draco’s breath hitched, he remembered Kat taking about some terrible kids a while back. He hadn’t fully understood her at the time, he never would’ve dreamed that she had meant this. How could anyone do this? Not to Kat. Not to sweet, innocent, little Kat.
She smiled knowingly. “Harry is…complicated.” She attempted, “he doesn’t do all that well with change.” She declared. “Also, let’s not forget that you were a complete git to him for six years of his life.” She added.
“We just thought you’d like to know that you are no longer the Slytherin Prince.” She snarled; her pug eyes gleaming. “You’ve been dethroned.” She added for good measure.
Over their many nights spent together, he’d created a bond with the blonde girl. He admired her ability to stay optimistic no matter what. He envied how she always managed to stay true to herself. To be the person who she always wanted to be.
“It’s also rude not to share.” Weasley countered. “But you don’t see me telling Malfoy off for his lack of manners.” He pointed out through mouthfuls of food.
The last nineteen years had been absolutely perfect. Harry and himself had married straight after graduating from Hogwarts, not wanting to wait a moment more. Many had thought them mad, being nineteen and engaged was one thing. But being married… well, let’s just say that he didn’t want to relive the moment his father had found out about the wedding.
Although, instead of walking out the doors he took a sharp turn left, an annoyed look dusting his features as he made his way towards the Slytherin table, to Draco’s complete dismay and surprise.
Kat and the other Hufflepuff's drew their wands in a threat filled stance. “You mess with Draco, then you
Draco gave him a small nod before sitting next to him and opening up his sketchbook. Potter didn’t speak like he normally did, instead he looked out onto the lake as if deep in thought. Draco was itching to ask him why the hell he was so quiet, but he decided against it. He reasoned that he didn’t much like Potter, so he shouldn’t care.
Several seconds later, he opened his eyes, tears were trickling down his cheeks. The room was alive in colour. Surrounding them all were tiny little dots, the colour of the rainbow.
A dutterhead. He was trying to reason with a complete dutterhead! Draco huffed, “meaning that we can control how long and how much you’ll become insane.” he'd have more a better chance trying to talk to a brick wall.
Hermione looked up at him with troubled eyes. “I don’t condone his actions at all. But you’ve got to understand, he’s not being himself at all.” she tried to offer him and Draco could laugh at the excuse.
She gave him a small nod. In light of her slowly relaxing posture around him, Draco attempted to divert the conversation towards a much more pressing matter.
Weasley and Hermione had took the stand proudly, both testifying in favour of Draco. They claimed that even though Draco had unwillingly let Death Eater’s into Hogwarts, he’d made portkey’s for not only all the at risk muggleborns, but for themselves and Potter so that they could escape. Hermione had even gone as far as to disclose the events that had happened at the manor and how Draco had protected her by taking the crucio curse himself. They had both concluded stating that he was one of their closest friends and life in Azkaban would be an inhumane charge for someone who had saved so many.
They say that hope is the only thing stronger than fear, but what do you do when there’s no hope left? Fear was the only thing he knew. It would be the last feeling that he would ever feel.
Potter held Draco’s hands in his, “I had to leave. I had to go. If I had stayed, then nothing would’ve stopped me from coming back to you. I couldn’t do that to you. I couldn’t ignore your wishes. So, I left.”
Draco glared at his friend, tucking his wand safely back into his pocket. He huffed, “in what part of your twisted mind did you believe that to be a smart way to approach a friend.” He chastised.
Draco smiled sadly. “I think that’s an excellent idea.” he told him, wanting to just have a few precious moments without the weight of the world hanging from them.
“No, you’re not.” Theo started, drawing circles on the back of his hand, “you can tell me Draco. You can tell me anything.” He reassured.
He was nearing the dungeons when he heard a small cry come from one of the pillars. He blinked before carrying on with his pursuit towards the dungeons. He reasoned that it was probably a ghost or something.
better.” He gave his father a thoughtful look, “I have to believe that. I have to understand that. Or all this, everything I’ve done, would be for nothing.”
Smith narrowed his eyes. “I don’t know what you’ve done Malfoy, but I demand you stop it.” Okay this was pitiful. Truly pitiful.
His father remained silent for several more seconds. A silent Malfoy… that was never a good sign. Draco braced himself for the worst.
He tutted. “What is it?” he asked impatiently, he was a busy person, he had places to go, people to see, beds to sleep in.
With a newfound strength, Draco screamed putting up the sturdiest shield charm he had ever known, channelling all that he had into his flow of magic. The crucio that his aunt had just been firing, rebounded as she fell to the ground clutching her stomach in agony.
Of course, he had accepted, it was Hogwarts! And if Draco didn’t want to spend his days living the same
She shook her head. “Of course not, Draco. But I can see what’s right in front of me. I’m afraid the wrackspurts are larger now, more potent. But that’s not all, there’s something else, something I can’t quite place.” She mused, studying him carefully.
The Dark Lord a name that stayed at the forefront of his mind. A name that he so desperately wanted to be rid of, but could never escape from. it shook him to his core.
“Don’t you DARE bring Hufflepuff's into this. We can settle this without being judgemental.” He huffed. No one should even dare to say anything bad about Hufflepuff's. Not when he was around.
Draco shrugged. “I know, that’s what it’s called.” He said again, frustrated that Potter would even dare to question him.
It was as if his hope had been sunk. Potter was right, he hadn't changed. No, he had just masked the truth.
Okay, maybe he was expecting that in the sense that he already knew. But he hadn't by no means expected her to admit it so quickly. She was fearless.
Draco was currently sat next to Potter at the dinning table, surrounded by a flock of chatting Weasleys.
She shivered. “I’m grateful too. But why does this feel like goodbye?” she asked her eyes filling with tears.
Do I hear wedding bells?? So, we're virtually finished. I just wanted to thank each and every one of you have commented, left kudos, or simply just read the fic, the support has meant so much to me. I hope you've all enjoyed this journey, and stay tuned for the epilogue. It'll be up tomorrow! It's not over yet :) :) :)
He felt tired, worn. He’d been fighting for so long. It had been so, so long. It would be easy just to give up. To admit defeat. But he wouldn’t. He’d come so far; he wouldn’t stop now. Not when he was so close.
“Remember what?” he asked pointedly. “All this better not be some sort of distraction to--- mmphh.” Draco was cut off, because suddenly Potter was kissing him.
Potter stood up abruptly. “Now he doesn’t even do that. When I talk to him, he walks away. When he sees me, he walks in a different direction. He doesn’t respond to my touches or voice. And it’s only been a day. It’s only been a fucking
His pride was misunderstood. His loyalty a product of fear. His ambitions were his fathers. Draco was nothing but a fake. A fraud. A puppet. His decisions never fully being ones of his own making.
He swallowed loudly. “And then you took it all away. My escape. A place where I could be myself. My rock. You took it all, and I broke. Hermione calls it a psychotic break. I’m not too sure how I feel about that.” He chuckled, but it sounded forced, desperate. Draco didn't like that. He didn't like it at all.
Draco took a deep breath, tears glistening in his eyes threatening to fall. Carefully, he extended an arm latching his hand onto Potter’s giving it a squeeze. He felt calm. He felt right.
He looked at hesitantly, “I was?” he whispered quietly, as if he was struggling to believe what she was saying.
The Death Eater crossed his arms, glaring and him intently. “And what do you think you’re doing?” he sneered.
“I kissed him. I kissed him.” Draco repeated deliriously from the edge of Theo’s bed. He’d run all the way there after ‘the incident’ with Potter, he felt that even if Draco couldn’t give himself wholly to Theo, then least he could do was give him the truth.
Couldn't she that he was doing his best? That this was hard. It was so, so hard. He just wanted one thing. One thing that allowed him to breathe, that preventing him from loosing all that he had become. That stopped him from becoming the person that he could potentially be if left to his own devices.
Weasley coughed, “Okay Malfoy, that’s enough, stop fondling my girl.” He teased as they broke apart.
He'd tell you one thing, he did not envy any of them. He could barely remember the Slytherin password most of the time.
He nodded before unfolding the gift. His eyes became blurry with tears as he stared down at a muggle photograph of the two of them. They were sitting at their favourite tree, Kat was staring up at him in wonder as he spoke passionately about something, a huge smile lighting up his features.
Macmillan snorted and Draco blinked. He’d forgotten about Macmillan. How disappointing. Well, if you’re looking for someone who’s even more irrelevant than Neville bloody Longbottom, than Macmillan is your guy.
Wow, is this what they meant by manmade karma? Draco had to admit he'd always been sceptical of the idea, but seeing the bastard withering in pain like that, well... Draco decided that manmade karma was his new favourite thing.
“That’s quite true. But even I can see that you’ve changed.” She mused. “You’re not that much of an arrogant idiot anymore.” she decided, giving him a once over.
His father shifted slightly where he stood, and Draco wondered what in Merlin’s name he wanted. Their last conversation hadn’t been exactly ideal, and the Malfoy heir hadn’t spoken to his father since. He hadn’t wanted to.
“The bravest and most beautiful person that I’ve ever had the pleasure of knowing was in Hufflepuff. Your namesake.” He said as he pulled out a ‘Draco Malfoy Pride’ badge pinning it to her robe. It shone brightly, a perfect fit.
The first thing he’d done was run to his mother, tears running down his face as he pulled her close, them both sinking to the floor with both relief and disbelief. They’d cried and they’d howled, seeking comfort in the others embrace. It was as if he were a little boy once again, seeking refuge in his mother’s safety. And he did feel it. He felt safe.
been a choice. He didn’t have to kill her. No, he could’ve shown her mercy. She’d be rotting in Azkaban right about now, but at least she’d still be alive. At least he wouldn’t be a murderer.
He raised a brow, “Would you care to test that theory?” he challenged her, and they all burst into a fit of laughter.
Potter looked at him as if Draco were everything to him. No one had ever looked at him like that before. It terrified him that he meant so much to Potter. That someone could be so dependent on another person.
He couldn’t speak. The Weasley’s felt that strongly about him? He didn’t know. He never would have guessed.
And here was the thing about broken hearts. No matter how hard you try, the pieces will never fit the way they did before.
is that supposed to mean?” he asked in threat, and Draco couldn't bring himself to try and even care.
Draco sighed. “Yes, yes you can be shallow later.” He muttered distractedly, jumping up from his bed and put the last present in a giant red and white velvet bag. “I have some presents to deliver.” He said determinedly.
“No? Then please tell me why they’re following you around like you’re a god?” Smith asked, pulling his wand out, Macmillan following suit.
Draco would rather pet a blooming hippogriff than tell her anything. He was fine for fucks sake. Just fine.
She shook her head. “Nice try Mr Malfoy.” She quirked and he huffed. “It’s thanks to those disgusting potions that you are now allowed to receive visitors, would you like me to send the first few in?” she asked.
He hadn’t seen or spoken to Potter since the day of his trial. It was better like that. Potter was the Saviour of the Wizarding World; the press were following him even more than they had been Draco. Besides, his life now consisted of running from the press, hiding away from the manor, and fixing his atrocious hair which had been completely ruined during the war.
Draco shook his head. “No, it’s fine. My father isn’t the greatest man. I love him, yes, but I don’t much care for him.” He hoped that answer was enough for the little creatures. He didn't much fancy going into great detail regarding his father and his less than absmayl relationship.
It was an adventure that was needed. He had to let go for a while. To forget about everything, while he still could.
He gulped. “You haven’t done anything. You’re absolutely perfect. They’re just very deluded and prejudice people, who will stop at nothing to get what they want.” He snarled out that last part.
So, nothing was wrong. He had to believe that was true. He just had to. Or else he feared he'd go insane.
Mine. Mine. Mine! Mine to break, mine to open, mine to play with. MINE! He stuck his tongue out in deep concentration as he breached the device.
“Really?” his daughter chirped out, bouncing up and down in her seat. “That would be wonderful.” She mused, giving Harry an almighty grin.
Potter’s eyes blazed with anger. “Help?” he spat out ludicrously, “You two wanted to fucking help?” He raged.
The Hufflepuff first-year’s blinked in confusion, absently shaking their heads. Really? Had his message
She gave him an award-winning grin. “I am proud.” She took a small step towards him, “I’ve always wanted to be in Hufflepuff, ever since I first heard about it. My friend says that Hufflepuff's are the kindest and bravest houses of them all.”
He could see it now, being followed around the school grounds by a purple Hufflepuff. Well, that just wouldn't do. He'd have to charm her hair back when she wasn't looking.
