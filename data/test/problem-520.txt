. “They’d hushed it up pretty fast. Not really something you want your 'Boy Who Defeated Voldemort' advertised as. And I figured I just needed time off and yet... And yet, the cases got worse. Once we’d rounded up all the worst ones, easy open and shut cases— your Herringborn, your Divitis, your McDonoughs. That was when we started getting things more in the gray area. People who’d lost limbs and given up their fight long ago. Scared teenagers. Unpaid reparations. Many victims and rarely did we get the bad guys. It was harder and harder to draw the line and leave it behind at the end of the day. Ron was spending more time with Hermione, and she’d just started her advocacy work. And Gin was busy with her team. And here I was... still fighting a war I’d thought I’d ended.” He swallowed hard. Draco knew he should stop this, this emoting of personal business, knew he should look away at the least, but he couldn’t.
“So like an auror?” Harry asked, equally unaware of what the FMI or its Muggle counterpart, FBI, was.
“Tell me about it,” Harry let out a huff that normally would be a laugh, “It’s weird, having all that money.” He wisely said nothing. Money had been a given in his life, and even without that, the status of the name he bore.
safe, he corrected. He’d only been thinking of himself.
Harry Potter was trying not to be upset with Draco. He knew this was hard. He saw, every week, family’s struggling with being ripped apart. The urge to become whole again so strong and human that it was practically a base need.
For a little while.
“But in the end, we grew up to be different people, and became better for it and better for each other.” He was certain he’d said something like that when being interrogated at Sunday dinner at the Weasley’s, he was certain it would suffice now.
“And used a terrible insult, just in quality alone.” Harry gave a wet laugh at his rotten mouth, giving responses just to give them.
Draco, wrenched it open and nearly took a fist to the face from Harry Fucking Potter, who was standing, slightly soggy in front of it, a determined expression on his face while Ronald just looked pained behind him.
“Oh,” Thomas interjected, “Tell him about Project Circumference—Yous guys’ll love it, it’s such a cool idea.”  He looked even more excited than Cynthia did to talk about it, if that was possible. It was almost a complete departure from the stoic man who they’re picked up from the ‘air port’.
“Use your

He looked down at
“I bet you say that to all the former death eaters,” came the retort before he could stop it. He wasn’t even drinking yet.
They stood like that, back to back, Draco providing the counter to every dark curse being shot their way, as if no time had passed since 1998, and Harry, powerful defeater of dark wizards, sent each one within range into a crumpled heap on the street, for a solid five minutes, there was only chanting, breathing and Draco shouting counter curses.
they were freed and heading home, Harry chattering beside him while they aparated and then walked the rest of the way home. Whereas the conversation through dinner had made him irritated and given him a headache, the smooth and cadenced speech next to him was soothing, punctuated by introspective pauses that he only had to nod or shake his head to. What sort of inferences Harry made, what he’d thought of the food and their strategies. He bounced back and forth between topics easily, his excitement palpable, despite his muted tone. Their house was exactly as they’d left it, just a little too small and full of their things. It felt better than any spell, just knowing they were blessedly
“Yes, every day, unless it’s snowing,” she answered looking up at him.
“Yes, I think it was about that. That some people will orbit around each other, in perfect circles, even if they want to leave it.”
We could stay like this and never leave…”
“Here we are,” Harry interjected neatly, saving them all from embarrassment, opening the door for them, letting them file in and then ducking around them to talk to the hostess. They were led to the back of the restaurant, near a quiet table that was their usual when they ate here, this time four instead of two. It was time for dinner.
“I think we’ve made a good start here, Tommy,” she finally said. “We have a list of what to tackle next, yes?” Her reading glasses were holding her hair back, an impromptu headband.
As if answering his thoughts, Harry said, “It’s always like this, peaceful, you know.”
“I’m not lying! You dragged me into this and I...” he paused. “I hate this! This was supposed to
Harry blinked, knocked out of staring with surprise, “Alright?”
Harry noticed him scrutinizing him and looked slightly affronted at, what Draco assumed was, his utter expression of scrutiny and disbelief at his lack of propriety. It was, with some pride, an expression often reserved for either the boy-who-lived’s utter lack of knowledge, or conversely, the obscure and pointless knowledge he seemed to have.
And something deep within him, where the bone deep emotions stemmed, warmed, unabashed and with fervor. It was pride and it was pain, still, from the information he now had, and it was an ache and a
“It’s a fancy way for saying between when I was an auror and when I took this job.”
“Well,” the anger of the day, combined with the exhaustion spiked and rose higher, before cresting and falling. All he really wanted was someone to tell him he did all he could. So he settled in the middle: “Could be better.”
“Because I love you,” Harry said with all the confidence of the bravely drunk, “And I know I upset you with something but I apologized and I just want you back.”
That startled a short laugh out of him.
“Right,” he swallowed thickly, taking the hand Draco was offering after adjusting her on his other arm and squeezing tightly. “She’ll be okay.”
me, that’s my problem. You just dragged me along with your inane plan! I never wanted children!” Harry looked as if he had slapped him. He knew all of his sensitive spots as well and as much as he knew he didn’t want to, he felt the devilish validation of the pain he was causing. To make one hurt as much as he did, an utterly human thought, forgoing magic entirely. Just as a muggle would.
What do you say to someone who you spent years obsessing over? Spent years trying to kill, out of youthful arrogance that you would live forever? Spent years trying to understand
Harry opened and shut his mouth.
So here he was, a warm pint of lager in his hand, looking “casual” while his heart tried to beat out of his chest, lurking like some sort of mental patient with a carefully neutral expression on his face that screamed
He was very lucky, though he didn’t really deserve it he was starting to realize when the carnage had settled down.
“Thin pizza just can’t hold up to it,” he interjected, giving the Brits a grin. Harry returned it. Draco has always envied his fast friendships. “But Italian is good, reminds me of the Little Italy back home.”
Four hours and two screaming matches later, almost always between Auror Butterman and Loreen, who kept trying to authorize an arrest, Harry finally just stood up and said what had been on his mind.
“Was it something I said— or did?” Harry asked, determined to figure out the truth, “I knew we were going slow—“
“She will be.”
curses. Grief. Sorrow. Biting loneliness. Curses that magic couldn’t cure and curses that seers couldn’t predict. He did, having seen it first hand, believe in the darkest curse of revenge, of anguish from loss. And while he wouldn’t not put any stock into it, it didn’t stop him from setting his own curse into the world, cursing this new breed of death eaters brought howling up from hell, spinning cyclones of death and destruction.
“Hmm, well, you have to remember, we only deal in federal crimes, so it’s all the more serious stuff than what the cops handle—so we have a whole division on Malicious Uses of Unenchanted Objects, basically anyone who enchants objects for nefarious purposes, there’s my division KRS, then there’s the Unenchanted Enchanted Relations group—they’d be the ones to handle dark wizards. Then for the rest of us, we work in conjunction with existing departments in the FBI, Cyber Intelligence, Terrorist Screening, and so on.”

end of the war, after the last of the major skirmishes with the remaining groups of Death Eaters, the holdouts who didn’t believe it was over or didn’t want it to be over, content to watch the destruction around them with relish, had been dealt with. He didn’t know much about it, becoming a recluse for his year of punishment (to be forbidden to use magic) after the first series of trials, his ‘wand’ (though there was none) was confiscated in some vault somewhere. People had testified on both sides, but, as the Prophet reported (back before the takeover) it all came down to a single testimony. Harry Potter, calm and tired in his pitch black robes, his voice hoarse from making sure that no deed, good or bad, went unacknowledged, stood up before the Wizegamot and told how, against all odds, Draco himself was a small but crucial part of the plan to stop Voldemort, orchestrated by both Dumbledore and Severus and executed by none other than the Boy Who Lived, after Draco’s change of heart in the final hours. It was all very dramatic.
It takes him longer than he’d like to admit to actually knock on the door, all of the anxiety and stress of the day culminating in this moment. At so many points in this year, and it had been a year, he could have stopped and taken a different path. He could have never ended up here in front of this door, waiting to knock with the last ounce of courage (stupidity) he had left. But Blaise was right. Trying to resolve the past or trying to avoid the future would never let him knock on that door, would never open him to the possibilities, good and bad, that were ahead. And sometimes, the bad would be
Harry Fucking Potter.
“Alright,” Ronald said, thumping him on the back with one of his frying pans that were also his hands, “Good luck mate, I’m rooting for you lot.” And he turn around and disappeared down the stairs to head back to his office, leaving Draco, shocked, in front of the door that announced “H. Potter” and below that, “Magical Child Protective Services.”
He wasn’t sure why he knew it but Draco finally tore his eyes away from the instruments playing themselves in the corner and back to his mother. It had become a habit of theirs, during his supervised visits with her while she served her own (longer) house arrest.
“You’re either wise beyond your years or completely insane,” Draco said before he could stop himself. Luna laughed before grinning widely at him.
“Oh,” Potter put the plate down, “That would be annoying.” But then he seemed just as lost as before.
“Now, now, Missus McIntyre, Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy are both eligible to petition for custody under ministry law—“
Which is when Draco’s anger carried him with a bang through the door, 20 minutes late, into the
in danger? Because from where I see it, you’re just upset you couldn’t have her!” Draco exploded, hurt and aching phantom pains in his chest, where magic had cut him open. When had they both stood up?
Suddenly he realized all of the times he'd jeered at Potter's infamy, not realizing, in all of his youth, that being bred for a purpose was as isolating as it was for him, only he had parents and relatives and friends to fill that space. Harry had none.
racial problems like the ones in the notes (the dread in learning what slavery exactly entailed floated past him again) but he knew that there was a reason a female minister would be a first for them. He wasn’t sure he wanted to find out the rest.

It had been almost four years since Draco had first seen Harry in Patel’s Emporium. In that time, Harry had asked him to move in with him and they’d had at least four fights about money or rent. But sometimes, when they were at the pub after a long day, snipping at each other and slowly working their way to another shouting match, Draco or Harry would stutter to a stop and look at one another and realize how far they’d come and how much they preferred being
“Harry,” and Harry finally looked up at him, a chunk of glass missing from his beloved glasses, his hair singed on the same side and his cheeks still far too thin from childhood, and Draco’s admonishment died in his throat, “Why don’t you tell me about her?” He motioned to the small girl in his arms.
have stopped him, or could have as he was just as enamored as Harry was with him, as strange as it was. It was more the principle of it. Yes, of course, all of Harry’s many friends knew and were slowly warming up to the idea of them, to the point where even Ginerva—Ginny was having polite conversations with him, and he’d been round to meet Teddy as Teddy instead of Theodore and spend the afternoon, and he was sure he now knew every auror in the department when he would pop in to meet Harry and even his mother has said: “My darling Draco, you could do far worse.” And though Harry had looked offended on his behalf Draco

instead of
But the point remained: while Draco didn’t believe in curses, it didn’t mean he wasn’t,
“I don’t want to lose you either,” he said after the longest pause, feeling the hot wet heat of Harry’s teardrops on his shoulder soak into his shirt. Harry never made sound when he cried. He never had to wonder why. “I’m in love with you, even after all the things I said. Gods, I— I don’t know why I did it. But I’m still in love with you. I think I might always be.”
“I rung Zabini and let him know you were busy with the statement, he said to take the whole day.”
A pattern he’d yet to avoid in the decade he’d known him.
It sounded almost like permission.
“Just
“Brill,” and without another word, the tea set floated over to where Draco had commandeered a corner of Harry’s desk and began pouring him a new cup, all while Harry continued writing. He stared in a little bit of shock at the action— wandless magic, such casual wandless magic, was practically unheard of. “Let me know if you need something stronger alright? Today was,” the grimace set on his lips as he finished the form, “One of the worser cases I’ve seen.”
“Hop up here, dear.” And Rebecca let go of them to sit on the desk, but quickly took Harry’s hand back. Harry was oblivious, as always, and entirely focused on Rebecca, leaving Draco to do the dirty work. He put on his best, withering Malfoy sneer and looked at them each in turn. Only the witches had sense to look embarrassed but he knew what would work best.

“But you did.” He could feel his temper start to rise. Why did he have to keep rehashing his crimes? His just punishment? His atonement?
“And do you feel things a lot?”
“Really? All sorts of skeletons in your closet you haven’t told me about?” Harry gave a chuckle, leaning into him. It wasn’t cold by any standards, but the warmth seeping through their contact felt soothing, familiar. Like whiskey in a poorly named pub.
This chapter is a huge info dump but, to be fair, I did put legal drama in the tags and with any legal drama comes background and case law. Think of it as the wizard’s version of Legally Blonde. Draco would look good in pink but it ruins the aesthetic of being an emo boy. (sidebar: I get
With nothing left to lose, Draco did.
“Or something,” Harry echoed, sounding entirely too fond and chummy and he quickly remembered he was just another platonic friend to him.
“I think in primary school, it was Maths, because I was good at it, and it was practical, for money and cooking and at Hogwarts, I think I would say...” He paused, sitting down, “I think I would say Charms.”
“What did you say?”
So they would waltz in and, if they were lucky, they would be hospitalized for a few days.
“Hey handsome,” his mouth twisting into a grin. Draco rolled his eyes with a blush.
Apparently, all of the papers would put together list of the biggest books of the week and let everyone know—the one from America was the most popular and prestigious list—so it was on the covers of all the books to let you know it was popular. Those were harder to read—too much information and bloody crime and political intrigue for him to understand. When the librarian took note, she switched him to something classic, “You’ll enjoy these, they’re so exceptional and classics for a reason!”
“Well—”
“You work as a curse breaker right? For a boutique company?”
“UMNAS seems really complicated,” Harry told her, the auror voice long gone, “I can’t imagine the amount of work that goes into it.”
Finally, Narcissa looked down and away and Draco retracted his hand. The rest of their allotted hour passed with only polite remark. Observers in the room, when glancing at them, would offhandedly remark how pale and still and smooth they were, comparing them to cold, perfected marble. How right they were.
true then you’d think he’d look a bit happier.”
He loved her, he really did and for all his parents’ faults, Draco knew, objectively, that she only wanted the best for him. That to see him alive and well and happy was her only care in the world. But constantly needling him was only going to send
“Well,” he huffed, a little proud that he could still strike fear on a day where he’d been stood up, cried and had far too many emotional conversations, “He could have owled.” Weasley had the decency not to comment on the flimsy excuse he was using to cover his tender heart and led him into the underground. They moved in silence for a bit.
Draco nodded, unsure where he was going with this. The story had been all over the old Prophet, and was probably one of the last majors stories they had run, after the trials and while the reparations were being doled out.
But the conversation moved on: “By extension, each state had their own local schooling systems based on area
“Hey,” Harry said, annoyance creeping into his tone as they stood outside of the pub with the
.” He pulled Harry of him so he could look him in his eyes, “I was scared alright? You might have loads of training in how to handle children but I...” he swallowed thickly, unable to break eye contact with Harry, “I didn’t even know if I wanted children. I wanted the whole bloody line to end with me.”
“So,” He looked back at the other man, “I think I was supposed to give an explanation. And I would offer you a chair but...” he gestures lamely to the kitchen. “Would it be odd if you sat and I stood?”
They sat in silence, Harry glued to the Telly until he nudged Draco with his shoulder, “Doesn’t matter what pub you’re in, they all seem to always have reruns of
“And it might make her want to stay even more, to know all the parts of you that you don’t hide,” Harry told him, “At least the parts you don’t want people you love to know,” he added. Draco felt relief wash in, for that was exactly why. “I feel the same way.”
“Getting back on track,” Hermione said, gesturing with a crisp, “After the Magical Civil War, which coincided with the American Civil War—it had to do with slavery,” she added, for the benefit of the pure bloods, not that it added much context for them, “It was decided that the schools, as a result of the change in states versus federal rights, could continue to operate uninterrupted as ‘separate but equal,’ meaning that the federal government had little control over what was being taught, how it was being taught or who was going the teaching, beyond the bare minimum of what was required. This all changed after the First World War.”
“One and the same. It affected not only muggles but wizarding communities, well, not as much, but still enough to be mentioned. In the United States it was actually worse for the magical community there. First, there was a huge amount of people affected by various diseases, magic and otherwise. The Spanish flu, polio, Dragon Pox, extreme poverty some would even say, they were hit by all of them. It’s actually rather fascinating, I was reading a book on the research team behind the cure for—“

of all people should know that.”
so cut him a break.
“Charms?!” Draco sat up, barely avoiding hitting the plate in his kneejerk reaction. “Why Charms?”
“Hey,” Harry breathed, standing up to stand close to him, “I’m glad Ron caught you before you left.”
“You know,” he finally responded, crossing his arms, “I assumed that dating you would be more cause for emotional trauma or being ostracized.” At one point, he did think those things, extensively, but persistent wearing down had worked like a charm after the first year and a half. Now it was just a joke between two people who understood one another and could laugh at it all.
Tumblr: we-re-always-alright
The bartender set down their drinks with a grunt.
It was a good question to ask. Unless... the pieces started to click together, not strongly and not with any supreme clarity, but enough for Draco to ask the next question. The right question.
In this case, it was a bad one.
“Hmm, I don’t actually know” Harry admitted, almost as if it were shameful to not know.
“Don’t worry Lacey, we’ll get you and Draco nice and dry soon,” Potter said, stepping into the point while three cleaners stepped past them, ready to compile and remove the bodies, and held out his hand, landing on Draco’s shoulder, who looked at him a daze, and with a tug, they popped out of the space.
He entangled himself around Draco as he got in, smelling of mint and  home, as the paler man burrowed into the hold.
“What do you think of this one?” Potter looked to him expectantly. “Too blue?”
It felt like they had stuffed a whole month’s of conversation—fears, doubts, shame and trust in spades. They talked all through breakfast (which was at their favorite place by the park, the little cafe that sat across from it and had plenty of space between its tables) and with the tourist crowd busy tucking in, they were undisturbed. It was these moments that Draco relished, and realized that Harry did as well. They were just two men sitting and eating and being entirely themselves, away from their histories and their foibles.
“Belt up, you’re being reasonably weird again.” Reasonably weird have become their codeword for anything related to the seven years that they had spent being hated enemies and nearly killing one another before ending up falling in love and moving into domestic bliss together; courtesy of one Ronald Weasley-Granger, and one of his finer (and only) bon mots to date, in Draco’s opinion.
Well. Now they had to talk. It was only years of proper rearing and breeding that kept Draco from doing exactly what he wanted to do (quickly apparate home, exhaustion be damned and try to warm up) and instead head directly over to Potter and ask him what he was doing.
“Now you’re just dodging the question,” Harry laughed, getting himself another cup of tea, Draco looked away at the fire. It was time to change the subject.
Draco just put his head in his hands, and by the time he’d lifted his head back up, he had to laugh. Harry looked at him a little confused.
(The sick irony was not lost on him.)
“Stop her!”
The next day, they both took their Saturday to walk through the neighborhood, looking at the houses there as they talked.
“Here,” Harry finally said, saving them all from the possible small talk that might have started, and Draco once again thanked Merlin for his partner’s preternatural ability to interject that the most inopportune times for the people around him, “It’s 4 quid and 20 p right?”
And his own smile had dimmed. Everything would be for Rebecca now. He knew it was petty but he didn’t want to share.
“Sort of,” Harry stepped in, “The American government didn’t start until right before the American revolution.”
This was the only room in which the walls were painted, the walls a soft, gray blue that exuded calm, while the paint cans laid in the corner under a few glossy magazines that showed furnished rooms and curated spaces. The bed was covered in dark gray sheets, covered in a warm, hand knitted blanket in blue green—
“No.” That one was easy.
Get Bummed out is a pretty damn fine song for this fic, it’s all “Steady heartbeat for once in my life, I’m moving my feet so I can try,
and walk in. It’s nearly empty, just a few men in union work trousers quietly drinking beer in the corner, one very solemn woman drinking at the bar. A tourist family making noise in the other corner.
Now, while Draco had clearly had a large realization leading to why he was sitting in their usual restaurant in their second most usual table, a realization earned through crying in front of Blaise Zabini, an event many would liken to a crucible of the greatest degree, clearly Harry Potter did not.
Draco was still confused but he couldn’t
And that might make her want to leave.”
“Yes.”
me a million dollars to get on one of those.”
Unlike the flat in Pimlico, lived in with their styles so thoroughly merged, the place in Camden was stark, almost like the first time Draco had been to Harry’s and looked at the plain off white of recently sold. It didn’t seem to bother Harry, the comparison as much as it did Draco. They were restarting again and there would be a whole new issue of what to place where and how to turn the emptiness full. And navigating the styles of a child which had very different needs from a pair of adults.
There was an extended silence. Draco traced the bookshelves which were empty except for a sloppily organized set of six books on child psychology, fresh paint over wood catching on the sensitive pads of his fingers. He wonders if Harry has callouses and if they catch on the shelves or if they glide past, leaving no trace.
“Oh.” He knew that feeling.
(a book he slogged through during the coldest part of winter after his father died and well after his punishment was over),
“I’m really sorry, this is—“ The mousey girl behind the till seemed nearly in tears as the machine in front of her. What Harry called a ‘Till,’ gave another mournful tone. “—This is my first day.”
The furious expression wavers, and she tucks her hair behind her ear, tiny engagement ring sparkling next to the plain gold band, and finally heaves a sigh, shaking her head.
He held out his arm for Draco and after hesitating, in one smooth motion, he placed his hand on his and they were sucked away with a pop.
The silence hung like a weight around both their necks.
He didn’t really wait for Draco to nod, preferring to nod to himself and steamroll on, as though if he paused for too long, he’d lose his nerve, “How I was angry and reckless, waiting for something stupid to kill me so I could
He’d barely gotten the words out when she’d flung herself at him, clinging as she trigged another curse which he barely deflected into the dining room, a wave of destruction ripping through the table and china cabinet.
“Actually,” Potter interjected, a slightly amused curl to his lips, “Auror Weasley said I could take both of them in for their statements, as this would fall under
“No problem,” Harry responded, “Happens to all of us,” he gave another winning smile as he slid the paper across the table, a ‘fiver’ as he always called it, “Just be lucky I can still do it without a pen and paper.”
“Oh, I’m on the Magical Child Protective Services Department; well, department of one,” he smiled, “But I help children of witches and wizards after any dangerous or deadly incidents. Comfort them, make sure they’re safe, warm and dry and sent to a safe home. The pay is rubbish but it’s for a good cause.”
Draco nodded to some thing that Cath was saying, looking distant and blank. He was certain he was just as nervous as Harry was and he was definitely using a glamor. Only Harry could really recognize the look.
to hurt you...” Bile rolled in his stomach as he realized how close he’d been to all the people who had hurt the Boy Who Lived. How he’d almost thrown it all away to win a stupid fight in an effort to protect himself from the one person who wouldn’t hurt him.
“She’s not a piece of property!” And at that the door slammed closed and papers flew and Draco had to hold Harry back a bit as he went to stand.
“My family,” and he grimaced, “My family was very strict with muggle toys and games.”
He kept repeating the words over and over in his head. Liza gave him a smile but he wondered if it were false, if all the others were. He had to leave.
“You did it all the time in school and I’m not just going to
“Right, that was back before we changed the legal term from Giftless to Unenchanted, so we changed the degree name to fit the new norm.” Cynthia politely folded her napkin and set it next to her empty plate. Thankfully, it looked like everyone was finishing and the two Americans were looking a bit tired, Thomas hiding a yawn behind his hand.
but he appreciated the lie all the same.
Now it might tear them apart.
“Your sources are wrong then, I haven’t been an auror in a while.” Draco looked at him again.
Happy July-is-the-month-of-national-holidays-and-revolutions!
happy and I—”
Robes off, in another jumper (a Mrs. Weasley original, judging by the homemade quality) with the sleeves pushed up and his decent jeans and a few bags under his eyes but he was smiling this little stunned smile at Draco and he could feel his own mouth tugging upwards in response. Beyond him, the silent picture of the Thames rolled by, while the fire crackled and classical music (some piano piece—Beethoven? Liszt? Probably Liszt) softly played from the wireless on the mantle.
And at the same time, the voice that hung in the back of his mind, the one that reminded him to
Instead this looked more like a scene from one of the muggle war documentaries that Harry would fall asleep watching on the couch, with shell shocked people being pulled from the rubble, healer teams appearing and reappearing to take them to the hospital, ‘ambulances’ with squibs taking the obliviated muggles away, and bodies being stacked in the streets. A boy with half a face placed not ungently next to a woman clutching a bundle of shopping, her legs long since gone. All it needed now were the ‘planes’ flying overhead and ‘air raid’ sirens.
Hermione was tucked up on the couch a month and a half later, a pen holding together her bushy, natural hair and a glass of red wine in her hand, a stack of notes on her lap. It was weird to think that over the years they’d become friends and that it didn’t feel as odd as it should anymore that Draco Malfoy was here sitting on the squidgy loveseat of the Weasley-Granger household while Ron passed out glasses to both Harry and himself before sitting next to his wife and readjusting the piles of papers on the low, dinged coffee table.
“Much like the Muggle government—“ Hermione started.
“Guess that comes with being Master of Death,” he wiggled his fingers spookily, before laughing again and going to the door. Draco’s smile dropped as he followed him to the door, seeing the three again and feeling the cup of tea churn internally.

“Not going to use your chosen one privilege?” He huffed out half a laugh in response.
Now he got it.
“Aye, yes, in the back break room, the whole lot’s all full up but we’ve got space yet,” she held out her hand, “Come on now, we’ll get you sorted out.” Rebecca looked at her distrustfully and Draco eyed her approvingly. She was quite smart to be suspicious, however nice this woman was.
“Extenuating,” Draco corrected, losing his patience with the drunk giant next to him.

it’s right, which I think is a key difference between Gryffindor and Slytherin. Being an auror, there’s some gray area— you uphold the laws but based on the last wizarding war, the law isn’t always right and changes based on who’s in power. I’m not sure that Harry would be able to reconcile that and it would leave him a lot of angst. Being a public figure didn’t help either, because people would just sway and agree with whatever he said. So he decided to forge his own path and build something where he knew he would always be on the side of good. It’s like the best version of the ‘Think of the children’ fallacy.

Garden magic was more organic than pureblood magic; both were refined over decades and centuries of familial use, but while pureblood magic was studied, refined and distilled to its purest form, garden magic moved the opposite way, growing less like a cultivated rose and more like a camellia, a wild species that could pop up and support itself but looked very much like a rose. It could be tempered over time, like pureblood magic, but it hardly ever made exact logical sense. Garden magic was always a bit wild, a bit unpredictable. Things that made sense at the time compounded over ages never ended predictably.
Draco croaked our a wet laugh, his arms holding Harry tightly. Somehow it felt better, knowing he was just as angry as he was. That it all wasn’t some genial mask worn by the Chosen One.
Part two was punishment for those who had done the worst of the crimes, banned and prevented from ever using magic again, they were sent to a commune, in a newly constructed and staffed building, to live out their sentences. Why they weren’t just executed, as some were very fond of writing into the struggling Prophet about, was that Shacklebolt’s goal was rehabilitating a majority of the people and a lot of them, as much as it pained him to say, were still people and still connected. It wasn’t a perfect solution, but it handled the worst of them.
“There is a man, but I’m not ashamed of it. I’m actually,” he collected himself slightly, “I’m actually ending it today...” He felt the shame and sadness roll through him like waves, a storm over the ocean of unsaid things.

Dumbledore— The wizarding world, they needed their savior.” Harry’s shoulders sagged, the weight upon them, five years old now, still too great. He thought about how after, when McGonagall became headmistress, how much Harry had spent talking about her with pride. Who did he wish she was? A friend? An aunt? Anyone?
But Harry brushes this off, sighing with a chuckle and heading downstairs, Draco close behind him. As they stepped out into the night air, he had to say something.

“I think he does it because it makes her laugh, mostly,” he adds, as they fall into step, looking down briefly at his trainers and Draco’s shined oxfords, “Love’s weird like that.”
His head was swimming, unsure of the information being poured in.
“Really.” There’s a comfortable silence as they regard each other. Some time passes, they’re both a bit out of shape for dueling it seems, and they only make the occasional comment until the witch next to Harry finally wakes up and leaves to yell at the front desk and Draco snatches up her chair so they can sit together. “Though, there are far worse words to leave behind.” Harry nods, adjusting the girl to his other shoulder so he can press the closer one into Draco’s.

“That’s uncalled for—”

Draco chuckles, thinking back to the bar, and says, “You know, Weasley said that this was the least reasonably weird thing you’ve done to date.”

Here’s how they reached that point. Neither Draco or Harry would forget that day, so remembering it was no hard task.
He had to laugh, deranged as it was. That was two months ago.
With his hand on his wand and his charcoal robes blowing in from the door and his second best casual suit on, he knew he cut an imposing figure. The three of them came to a stop, Butterman bending over to huff and puff at his knees. The older woman fixed him with a shrewd look. He held her gaze. “What’s going on here?”
Every couple of weeks, Weasley, who was, at this point Ronald in the same sort of way Potter was now Harry, only different, would join Harry and Draco at the pub. They would usually drink pints of lager, still, only switching to wine after particularly trying cases.
This part of the journey was terrifying, the leaping forward. He’d read about the pains that couples went through with the adoption process in the muggle world, never mind the additional troubles of being a same sex couple trying to adopt and add on the problems of being part of the wizarding community.
“It’s interesting stuff,” Harry said, “Though my days in law enforcement are far behind me, I’m sure you have a lot of stories to tell.”
“But I thought you were happy—you always had that look—“
“Pint of lager and a double of whiskey. J&B,” Harry said, barely making eye contact. Around the bar, there dozens of mirrors and photos but only one, rolled in on a cart ‘Telly.’
“No,” he said shortly and without a smile, so much so she slightly recoiled in the way that wait staff would when faced with the worst of customers, “Thank you.” He added as an afterthought, while she bobbed and weaved around the other closely seated tables, back to the hostess stand where she instantly started gossiping to the other waiter.
A few people were staring across the road. He was going to need a drink soon, pity his poor liver.

The next day at the firm had been a nightmare; he was snappish and rude, aggravated at the slightest perceived offense and even Blaise, the most unflappable person, had agreed in sending him home.
“Sure, whatever you need...” Cynthia gave them another wide smile before continuing to setup the desks.
He’s clearly moved to the UK at some point the traitor, but seriously. If there’s separate quidditch teams for each country and prime ministers/presidents for each country then why the fuck would the Irish go to Hogwarts. Just—everything about Jo’s expansion into other magical governments and schools is the worst world building I’ve ever seen which is why I tore it apart and have rebuilt it in a way to attempt to reflect the actual countries and cultures they represent. (Why you ask? It’s British Imperialism baby.)
“Did it though? This room is, with all the respect of the story you just told, very bare. It might be worth getting the real me’s opinions on it.”
Either they thought him completely insane, a logical step considering that he and Harry had spent a good portion of time trying and nearly succeeding at killing each other, or under some sort of curse, equally likely due to the aforementioned fact.
When he had made his unintentionally dramatic entrance, Harry had instantly bounded over to him, looking for all intents and purposes like an overly excitable dog and greeted him with a loud, “Draco! You made it, I was starting to worry,” which if his entrance hadn’t turned heads that most certainly had. And then, as if they were publicly close and dear friends, had given him a
“Yes, seems to be so.”
“Well you know Neville, once he sets his mind on something these days, he goes all in.” And it was true. The man was far different from the boy, taking reform at Hogwarts to do away with the bullying and badgering by teachers as his own personal mission. Of course, no one had been as bad as Severus had been (excluding the final year) but it was still common for teachers to make…an example of their pupils. He wondered what the rest of the old guard had thought, though most were retired at this point. “And it’s actually given them a bit of an edge over St. Augustine’s, they still use physical punishments for severe issues.”
“Hmm.” He wasn’t sure that he wanted to continue this deep and scalding dig through the past but he could agree there: Rebecca did not deserve any sort of physical punishment. Even the few times Father had slapped him would have been enough to turn him off of the idea but this cemented it. And if you were willing to hit someone you were supposed to love and protect, then what else could you be capable of?
“Now, I was wondering what your reaction would be if the child in question decided to cut ties with you and Mr. Potter at 17.”

event,” Harry corrected back, before nudging Weasley out of his stupor. Draco shrugged in response. It was hard to be as open when there was an audience.
He didn’t anticipate this level of destruction. Even the battle of Hogwarts hadn’t been so utterly violent on its surroundings, so rarely did wizards intend to cause property damage. Here whole buildings had gone up and cars eviscerated to their parts. Often any damage was caused from deflected spells, unless a barrier was in the way, their recipients always, well, recipients. He didn’t remember much from the battle of Hogwarts with any distinction, the fear and adrenaline and terror turning it into flashes and sensations. Not unlike today.
Also also: any time I had a meeting with the folks in our UK office, the first thing we’d spend about 5 minutes talking about on our weekly calls was the weather. Turns out living in a place where you can have 3.5in of snow on Halloween (our coldest since 1871) and then wear shorts over the weekend because you're back in the 60s/70s is fascinating conversation.
“Leave the house and never or rarely contact you again.” Something sharp and painful twisted in his gut. “It can be a very natural reaction for adopted or fostered children, especially if they realize their parents or foster parents are not what they seem to be.” She watched him very carefully, watching to see that old part of him rear up and prove her right. He almost wanted to let it, just for some relief from that inscrutable gaze.
So far, he’s passed with flying colors.

“Loreen McIntyre.” She leaned her head around to see where Rebecca was buried into Harry’s arms and Draco caught a whiff of her old, saccharine perfume. “And that’s my granddaughter. Thank you for catching her.” She smiled at him, so pleasing and demure and full of good breeding, it made his stomach turn. He’d seen that hollow smile so many times.

Draco opened his mouth to say something when Weasley started again, “You know, Malfoy,” he said, rolling the words in his mouth like stones in a tin cup, “When Harry told me who we were going out with tonight, I was...” he trailed off again, tilting his head the other way. Maybe he was more drunk than tipsy.

I didn’t want her to hear it, the
He spat once more into the toilet, flushing away the foul smelling stuff. Someone banged on the door, the the swinging door to the outside of the washroom bringing the smells of lunch and other people and he felt the bile rise again. He nearly choked on his own throat, retching again, as if his body was trying to purge itself of all of the bad things he’d done and was coming up short.
“It’s not— it’s not that simple,” Draco sighed, because even to describe the gulf of non-simplicity between them was too much. There was too much of everything, history, animosity, emotion, to be doing favors for one another. Harry tossed the biro on his desk and rubbed his eyes, tired, but he maintained his earlier statements.
Everything books and movies and television and any person he’d talk to, their descriptions of love finally made sense. He’d liked Cho but had never expected her to actually return his affections and never in the way it had ended up and Gin had been this force just outside of his reach. Like he was a breeze in her hurricane. But with Draco…
(This also gave me a great idea for a sequel to this story, if folks like it)
They had talked on this, he and Harry. How he was a changed man. How he had made his penance. There’d been flashcards and very strong gin and tonics as they reviewed. He wondered what Cynthia and Thomas would think of him when they’d finally read the reports of this conversation and the trials. He wouldn’t fault them for giving up then, but he knew it would upset Harry.
I can’t believe Killing Me Softly came out in 1996. Gosh I feel old. Daddy Issues was picked because the second that song starts, all I can think of is rain.
She sobbed into his shoulder, mumbling and crying and warm. Draco felt all his body slowly stabilize after the spike of energy from the deflection, they were lucky that he’d had enough time to recognize the spell work. A favorite of Herringborn, the curse was a parting gift for whoever had survived the initial assault. It was nearly impossible to detect unless you were to last person to leave after the initial curses and, well, there wouldn’t be much left of you after. He’d seen it happen enough times to know the signs and knew he had a good chance of avoiding it but on the fly...

“Save it for someone who wants to hear it.” He tried to wrench his arm away but it seemed to only make Harry hold on tighter. Even through his robes he could feel how warm he always was. “Let go.”
“We will,” he agreed, kissing their clasped hands, “We’ll set a better example of how to communicate.”
Until it was right before the anniversary of his father’s death and amidst the happiness of daily life, he slammed right into a wall of sadness and grief, a swath of emotions that left him angrier than he’d ever been. It’d been
“Do?” Draco was still staring at him as he moved from the soft taupe ceramics from Turkey to the China from Poland.
“If you’ll excuse me,” Draco Malfoy said politely, standing up with an incline of his head while the three compared notes. He exited quietly from the room, went down the hall where Harry was busy talking to some old colleague, passing by without a trace to the washroom. A pale ghost, he was certain someone had told him long ago that Death was a pale ghost, riding on pale green horseback. He could be cutting a similar path.
running about, half of them marked with some kind of chalk from one of the wizards running the overrun intake desk. There was a wide variety of colors, ranging from black to red to orange to yellow to green, and once they’d pulled and pushed their way to the desk, they were shouted over and given green marks after a quick spell to check over the them and sent in the direction of the over crowded chairs, nearly getting run over by a large group of Portuguese tourists all shouting in Portuguese while the official kept shouting back in English and Celtic that a translator was on the way.

So this story roughly takes place in 2005/2006, after the end of the Troubles but not so far past that people don’t remember it. In fact, a lot of the Irish wizards probably remember it all too well. Also, firmly putting my stake in the ground that magical Ireland is one ‘whole’ country in the HP verse, and because I think it makes more sense as wizards seem to not be particularly religious though more ethnocentric than expected. This is a theme that you’ll see throughout this fic.
“Yes,” replied Harry and said no more.
With Draco, there had always been some sort of inexplicable force, pulling them together, and if for a moment he had believed in the drivel that Trelawny had always spoke of, he would have said it was some kind of fate. Only now, he
“Right, so Cynthia and Tommy are still working on the case files—there’s apparently a lot of lineage information to go through to satisfy some of the requirements of the Irish Ministry and they’ve got it nearly ready to run through. They just need to finish up some paperwork really. And then Liza is going to speak with our list of witnesses this week and once that’s filed they’ll use that as evidence as well.” Right, their list of people to vouch for them. Well, mostly for Harry.
, he was tired, he could feel every pulse of magic left in him and it was like trying to run after running all day. The sun was hotter than he remembered. Was it even the same day? It was all still a bit fuzzy—shock, one of the healers had said while he was shrugging them off to focus but as long as Harry was moving then, well, he was fine.
That was a lesson worth passing on to Rebecca. A lesson

Insolent and uncaring of Draco’s own opinions on the matter it seemed.

Draco pushed him off, mind overloaded with the sense that he now knew how Harry Potter, object of his misaligned affections kissed, and tried again, “Harry James Potter if you don’t explain yourself right now—”
“Oh not again,” he couldn’t help but say out loud but there he was, Harry Potter, talking with Lacey Stone and wrapping her in a warm dry blanket, a few meters away while she sat on a semi-dry shaded bench in the overcast light. Maybe he could just leave before anyone noticed—and no, of course not, because Potter was looking up and meeting his eyes with his green ones and smiling sadly.
That same feeling of moving too fast hit him again but he shook it off. This was the right thing to do.

was a question he had once asked himself.
Each time Draco opened them, it had seemed that time had passed. There was tea placed in front of him that he drank gratefully, small biscuits to nibble on, Lacey had long since fallen asleep after tearfully telling what had happened in the broken understanding of a child and now Harry just sat quietly in his chair, leaning back and resting his feet on on of the open drawers of the desk while he filed paperwork. In the background, he could hear a polonaise emitting from the wireless.

“And nearly kill each other, as well,” Harry added, with his lips loosened by the wine, while he stiffened just slightly, remembering the slashing of unknown magic just faintly, just as much as was sure Harry could feel fiendfyre at his back. “Even before the war.”
“Harry...” he tried to say something but the words got caught in his throat, choked by anger and time. To do these things to a child. To anyone was wrong. He understood that now, as hypocritical as it was. He wanted to find them and shake them to pieces, to drop his wand and fight them in a way he'd never felt. These muggles who hurt this man standing before him, who survived wars and cheated death and lost so many he loved. That Dumbledore, in all his wisdom had deemed the sacrifice of a boy he'd never met, who's parents he'd cherished, was more a lamb to slaughter than an intelligent and feeling being.

“The Americans have always had a different view of magic. It’s hard to describe.” Hermione set her notes aside, sighing and leaning into Ron as she did so. “We’d likely have to ask someone from their community to describe it, but it seems, from all the readings, that they treat muggles differently than we do here. For better or for worse, they see their fate tied to muggles and take a far stronger stance on integrating the muggle and magic community. They often live side by side, congregating in local meeting places versus building insulated communities.”
Harry remembered, a long while ago, watching from the corner of the room while he was cleaning, when Petunia was watching a movie—some sort of American musical, where the main bloke had been so blindingly happy after a date that he’d ended up singing in the rain, kicking up the water and getting soaking wet, just because the woman had gone on a date with him. At the time, he’d thought it was rather stupid, with all the certainty that eight year olds have, but now.
“By the end of the month, I couldn’t go anywhere and not see enemies and death eaters in every corner. I was arguing with everyone, fighting with my friends, with Gin, even with Mrs. Weasley,” he swallowed thickly as if he had just admitted the greatest treason. “With Gin it was worse—I would get angry and she would respond and then we would be screaming at each other and then something would explode as if I were still eleven and she’d spend the night at a friend’s place. She gave it a real go after but by the end of the month we were broken up and I was turning in my resignation.”

Narcissa was always emotional proceeding winter. Something about approaching Christmas always set her off—the Malfoy’s had, historically, held a Christmas ball the day before, and a New Year’s one shortly after, and she was always the most generous with her smiles then, they seemed to fall like the flakes from the gray sky on days like that. And after the war, she’d been subdued, prevented from throwing anything more than a single gift for her son’s birthday in his direction, though they were separated only legally. And then, his father had been killed.
As he walked towards where he would normally apparate from, he could feel the tiredness truly settle deep into his bones. At work, Draco would be what one would describe as a loner. He kept to himself and for good reason. Letting people in was a full effort and taxing, getting them to see beyond the name and the story and the past—it was in this way he admired Blaise and his family. If the Zabini’s had one talent in excess, it was being on the winning side, always. They had played close enough to the Death Eaters to avoid any form of setback when the Dark Lord had taken power; yet, they were far enough to avoid perjury when they said they were acting out of self preservation. They had Slytherin pride of course, but Slytherin cunning was far more valuable to them in all aspects, so they weren’t ashamed to lick boots if it served them better in the long run and left them in charge of themselves and their wealth.

But gone where the soothing patterns he was used to, the woman throwing it off with her dark, serious eyes, red painted lips and deep auburn hair.

if we keep wallowing in the past,” his tone softened slightly, “We may not have lived lives to be proud of, but it’s the past, we’re meant to move on from it. To take a second chance and waste it, to not do better.
“Anyway, that was the start of the magical government which, as Harry said, wasn’t formalized until the American revolution. Schooling was regional and mirrored the state system, which is very unlike here. Essentially, each state has their own sub level of government that reports to the federal government, within reason of course.”
He wasn’t sure why it had affected him so much, the war was so far in the past, the antagonism of the seven years spent leading up to it so long behind him, even his father’s death was more than two years ago. In a way, he was angry.

Much like the previous pattern, soon they had a new, adjacent one that snuck up on him.
In all honesty, Draco blames himself. He hadn’t said anything. Hadn’t gotten up the courage to contradict Harry. He’d instead drifted behind the man like a ghost, darkening his doorway and foiling his simple story. The Outcast. The Other.

It didn’t feel out of his control and it didn’t feel outside of what he new. It felt like coming home. And it was so bloody worth it, to have him close, to listen to him complain about Zabini and his coworkers, to watch him make a comment in his dry drawl and immediately check if it were alright, to look at the way his wrists tapered into strong, rangy forearms when he would roll up his sleeves, uncaring and daring Harry to say anything about the faded tattoo on his forearm.
“Just fuck off Potter,” he sighed, returning his attention to the tea that would soon make up his cheap, poorly tasting hot toddy, “I cannot be bothered to deal with you today.” He hoped that was enough to scare him off.
“I mean it.” And he did. He knew all the horrible things he’d done, by his testimony and by his own admission, in privacy. Yet he was still here. And maybe that was enough, when things were hard. To be known. To have the entirety of your crimes laid bare and still be acknowledged as a person.
“Ohhhhhh,” Rebecca nodded, “Okay.”
That was a funny sort of way to describe the firm.
Here’s how the war had ended. After the Dark Lord had turned to dust and only Potter remained, it came to light that the ministry was extremely complacent with what had happened to many,

to dress down, and somehow the conversation had started back up as Harry had led him to the bar to get a drink, though he was certain it was all about him. The numb tattoo on his forearm itched but he knew to make any sudden moves would be the sure way to get a stunner in the back.
amazing is that I have not used a single Lorde song in this entire playlist. Who even am I. (To be honest, it could just be both albums because Lorde is just. that. good.)
“Well, the good news is is that it’s almost over with, then it’s just the trial and moving into the new place. Which reminds me, John and Liza and Cathleen should be here any minute.” It was still astonishing how preternatural Harry was at timing, for then the doorbell rang, which only made him laugh. “Right on time.”
Another fun fact, when you live in a major city in America, and it’s got a sense of community around that city, you consider yourself a member of that city above that state, which is something I feel daily living in Chicago. Turns out, Fall Out Boy was right the whole time. Can 100% recommend the city and it’s hundreds of beautiful neighborhoods though, walking around here is delightful.
Draco can’t help it, he half laughs at that, the tension broken. It’s been a long day. Harry gives him a wider smile, and they sort of stared at each other that way for a few moments. On the wireless, a Chopin piece was playing and in the room, the fire crackled.
, as they were looking to buy a bigger place in Camden to account for the added person so they were viewing their current place in Pimlico, as it was most accurate, and then the new place (still in the hands of muggle solicitors) to ensure it wasn’t some sort of glorified dungeon. He had balked at that, making a snippy comment about how dungeons weren’t all that terrible, weeks ago. Now he felt barely able to muster up a weak smile to keep up his facade.
“Jet lag,” Cynthia added with a tired smile, “Always hits when you least expect it.”
“Draco—”

“It’s okay Harry, I do the same thing when I have to do my chores...” He took a deep breath, gripping Draco’s hand as well. He squeezed back. He felt like he was taking a leap off a very tall building. Was this what doing the right thing was all about?
“Mountains of it—“
“Blaise, I’m not particularly in the mood,” Draco said, folding the note and placing it back into his pocket as he set his cooled tea to the side so he could continue his research on pincushion curses from India that had been twisted into the latest death eater case in Newcastle upon Tyne. “If you could be so kind as to return to your office—”
at Wandless magic and here’s why: magic is hereditary but when you’re intermarrying all the time, you ruin the gene pool much like the Hapsburgs. Yes, Magic should get stronger if you’re always marrying witches and wizards, BUT, and this is key, that assumes you’re marrying someone with magical blood and not from the same 20 magically blooded families, because it can’t just be
Well, there wasn’t much else Harry could say about that but smile at him, and though Draco would tell anyone outside of their family and friends that his being with Harry was obviously for the fame and fortune, it was really for this, quiet conversations and frozen sweets in the candlelight while the storm blew around outside, a separate set of spaces made into one.
“Well then.” His face split into a grin, bright white teeth against copper skin.
And that’s when the sound came back, all at once, a cacophony of muggle sirens and screaming people and spells being launched and blasting apart more explosive cars, their unholy cackling rising up. It wasn’t the death eaters. It simply couldn’t be.
“How...” Draco stopped and shook his head. “They’re going to get found out. One way or another. The separation is necessary.” They were too different to coexist in knowledge of each other. He looked to Harry for support but he only half nodded, in that way he always did when talking with headstrong Aurors. He’d yet to make an opinion but wouldn’t make that known until necessary.
Rebecca nodded, hopping up from the chair and taking Harry’s hand, clutching it right before capturing Draco’s hand as well. She was bit taller than waist height on both of them, certain to be almost tall as them when she was full grown. Through his Occulemency, he could sense that she was resting just outside his normal shields, not intentionally, but just that was where she normally sat.
“Anyway, we’d been working for a couple of months, when I started becoming...more paranoid, I guess you could call it. Ron had been transferred to his own team, we were both training new recruits. But I couldn’t shut it off, the job. The older aurors would talk about it sometimes, that after enough cases, you were always on. Sort of lent credibility to old Mad Eye, now that I think on it. And it wasn’t so bad at first. Until I’d nearly blasted some gent apart who’d snuck up on me to get an autograph.” He gave the mug a grimace, slowly rotating it in one rougher hand.
Shortly after the trials, where Draco and his mother had been sentenced to a year or two of house arrest, respectively, his father was sentenced to 7 years in prison, stripped of his magic. Azkaban had been ruined during the war—there was really no place for high ranking wizards after that, so instead they were all kept in a lower security facility. There a riot had broken out among the defanged wizards, and the details were fuzzy, but in his darkest, drunkest moments, the Malfoy heir assumed the worst: that the purist, blood-obsessed thinking of a toppled regime had held strong and lead to the death of his father. The official story was that he was stabbed in the neck in an alcove and while security wizards were subduing the rioters, he’d been missed and had bled out quickly. Had he survived, Lucius would have been irked by the offensively muggle-caused death he had suffered.
Liza was the opposite, cornsilk hair, hazel eyes, barely coming up to Harry’s chin and cursed like a sailor when there weren’t children around. She said her family was here by way of her mother and by way of Poland and had a boisterous laugh, filling any room she was in. She had joined first, marched right up and had demanded a chance to prove herself to Harry Potter, who had graciously ‘accepted.’ Where John was steadfast and eager to tell off aurors with biting commentary that he’d hidden behind his solemn demeanor, Liza was fast, darting in and darting out of scenes, moving in a flippant way that hid how upset she could be. She recently had chopped off most of her hair after someone on the tube had put gum in it, she told him when he had blinked at her appearance.
“I know, Harry makes fun of me all the time for it even though he didn’t learn until he was 13.”

Here he was, apparating a few blocks away from home just so he could kick the snow and hoot and holler into the empty, late night air, muggle neighbors be damned. It felt like flying.
In my opinion, Harry doesn’t want to be a hero as he wants to be a good guy. He wants to always be on the right side of things
(The time had seemed to gone by in a blur for Draco and while Harry seemed to be drawing energy from the proceedings, he had felt unmoored and tired. Their place was always being called on by owls and paperwork. Floo calls and visits between their place and the Weasley-Granger residence. Between work and preparation, he wasn’t sure even what day it was any more. This he could at least do. He’d been accompanying Father since he could politely use all four forks and hold a conversation on local politics with ease.)

They’d apparated directly into Harry’s office, something he wasn't sure how they did but he was grateful for, a small but cozy space between the second (Department of Magical Law Enforcement) and third (Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes) levels, Harry described as he set Lacey down on the tiny couch by the fireplace. His tone was smooth and soothing. “Makes it harder for people to find me,” he added with a grin at Draco who stared blankly back at him. The grin had disappeared.

Here’s how they meet Rebecca McIntyre. They’re talking back and forth, chatting about almost nothing at all (though Draco would be loathe to admit his hair amounts to nothing, particularly how Harry could spend hours running his hands through it when watching telly) when the little girl who was sleeping on Harry looks up at them apropos of nothing, with giant brown-green-hazel eyes and says plain as day in a thick Irish accent, “Am I like you now?”
But the talking hadn’t stopped since.
“Do you know why I tell you that you’re brave?”  They were at the park by the palace, the one with the big reflecting pond that he’d never been able to remember the name of, Hide or something, having already walked all the way past the other underground station near their neighborhood. There weren’t many muggles out at this hour and those that were were jogging or older, sitting at the benches. Already there was one woman reading on a blanket catching the first unfiltered rays of sunlight on the great open lawn. Someone once told him, he thinks it might have been Blaise of all people, that it was originally a hunting ground and that at one point an elaborate crystal palace had been erected there. But now instead it was a park and a man in fluorescent spandex rode past them on his bicycle.
no less, I could say the same of you, Draco Malfoy.” She finished her drink before neatly tucking the umbrella onto her hair artfully, “Don’t be a stranger at these things, we still need more evidence that there’s a bias against blondes.” And with that she ducked around him to get to the bar and passed Granger and Weasley with a trailing hand and as he watched her, he caught Harry’s eye and with how he was grinning, that made the last five minutes worth every other embarrassing moment that had accompanied it.
“Yeah, and it was wonderful to know even that about my dad, but at the same time… I felt as if I didn’t do well in Quidditch or didn’t love it enough, I was letting him down.”
“It did,” he said, unable to look away.  Cynthia beamed and Tommy looked happy at that.
Didn’t know if he could.
“Sounds fantastic!”
, he rationalized.
There’s a morbid fascination with the spectacle of failure he’s about to go through, like passing an auto collision.
So far the conversation had been relatively light. Things that wouldn’t come up normally in the files:
“And I...” Draco started again, talking around the sobs that wanted to escape, “I can’t believe I said those things to you, I was just so angry and I wanted you to feel as bad as I did— it was so wrong. I... There’s no way that’s forgivable.”
By now, Weasley was tipsy, on his third glass and Harry was smiling a lot more and adding in his usual insightful comments that were often just for him and each time Weasley would let out a louder than average laugh and Draco was stuck there stiff as a board. Sure he was following along with the conversation but he wasn’t ready to add anything. The

“Of course,” he replied, setting the notes neatly on the table. That was enough world history for one day. “Do we have everything?”
“Together.”
“At first. And annoyed. Out of every git in the world, I believe was what I said.” Gregarious stories aside, Weasley seemed to have grown a better grasp on the English language, “And believe me, for all the odd and absurd shite that Harry has gotten me into over the years, this is the only

Silence fell in the street as the last one hit the ground, stunned into submission. Just the sounds of Harry’s harsh breathing, and the ringing in his ears, the heat from the sun and the explosion and the familiar ache of dueling settling into his arms. It was over.

and turned and left with a pop.
“Draco, Draco,” he clucked, shaking his head, “Don’t make me pull rank on you for this.” He ignored him, pulling out a quill and paper, ready to continue the task at hand. He started reading, content to pretend the other man wasn’t there.
“At first, I thought I’d completely lost it. I couldn’t believe you were there, staring at the wall of rugs. And I knew I had to ask your opinion, if you were real.”
“I—I am so sorry, sir—“ she tried to tell Draco. Harry gave him a look that said very plainly
Draco finally snapped out of it, whatever it was and flung aside one of the curses heading towards Harry from behind—more false death eaters heading up street— and resolved to try and cause as little property damage as possible. There were plenty of muggles and wizards injured here—prone and immobile with few moving— and one of the many old buildings, beautiful and ancient, could easily collapse on them.

part of the magical and unenchanted community, compared to the wizards in the UK who see themselves as entirely separate, binary concepts. You aren’t a person—you’re a witch/wizard OR a muggle, whereas in the US, you’re an American who is also a witch or wizard. It creates a very isolated, detached experience I think, for better or worse. So far this is the chapter I'm most nervous about and have fiddled with the most so hopefully it makes sense. There's a lot of organic stuff in here compared to canon.
So Draco started pulling back.
His hands trembled with unspoken things—the ghost he was twisting into a poltergeist, with pain and agony fueling the change, wringing out every

Within the hour, after Harry had ducked out to get some groceries and pick up the case files, when it seemed they were more eager to get started than tour the area; they had already set up a wide array of things, Draco watching all the while, providing answers when prompted. The whole process was a bit entrancing, if unsettling that it was

Did he mention that Harry was brilliant? He should mention it again. The wine was getting to him. Even now.
He started pulling out the muggle ‘pounds’ to cover his two waters when someone finally dropped into the seat across from him with a huff and Draco’s heart thudded as he whipped his head up—

Harry led them to the bar and they both sat down, Harry dressed in a sweater (gray) with a button up (red) below it and yet another pair of jeans, this time in better shape. Draco felt overdressed in his tailored vest (charcoal) and shirt (white) and trousers (also charcoal) but the allure of the drink outweighed it. The bartender swung by dropping down coasters advertising Guinness.
when he was gone, really he would. He would still have his friends and his nearly fully furnished flat and the expanding Weasley family and his fulfilling job and Draco Malfoy would just fade into the background and disappear entirely. He’d become a story that others would ask Harry about, or Harry would tell them about, and one day, he’d fade entirely from memory. Harry would be fine. Yet to make himself keep standing by his side only to wave goodbye as a friend was some sort of unholy torture that, while earned over his life, was too painful.
“We’re glad you could come on short notice,” Draco said, never one to lose his manners over a simple thing such as meeting the two people meant to help them retain Rebecca, “I know it’s quite the trip.”
echoed in his mind and he was certain it echoed in Harry’s.
“Uncanny.”
trying to disengage from this, trying to hide, trying to make himself as small as possible, but Draco wouldn’t let him, grabbing his arm, a mirror image. How many times had they been in this position? No one was keeping count. “Face it, Harry Potter, we’re not her best choice. And you won’t accept that.”  He wanted him to admit it, he wanted him to acknowledge what he was. A monster in man’s clothing.
“In order...” he started and stopped a few times, trying to form the words, “In order for the protection magic to work, I needed to be taken in by family, after my parents were murdered.” His tone was a hair closer to clinical then personal. A terrifying prospect. He had seen people in the aftermath of the war lose all sense of time and space, detach from the terrible reality, knowing it wasn't healthy but finding no others options for survival.
“—You’re always so
“Well,” Harry scratched the back of his head, like he wasn’t the most powerful wizard to beat death twice, “He sort of turned to dust—“
“You know,” Weasley started. And stopped, looking at him again with that queer look.

“I almost did,” Draco admitted, watching the way Harry blinked in response, “You were two hours late and I didn’t even need to be occulumens to know that muggles were thinking it was pathetic. Switching back and forth between the lonely yet handsome man and their own sad lunch dates like it was a particularly boring quidditch match.” And Harry laughs and

“Well,” the blonde continued, “I find it perfectly reasonable considering you did wandless magic— again— in a shop.”
After that, the rest of the evening passed in a bit of blur, which could have been due to the second bottle of wine they finished over the course of their discussion. Who would owl who. Who would file for what. What papers needed copies. Ron kept busy with refilling and adjusting things, adding his own opinion, asking the obvious questions.

“—But then after, we kept running into each other and after a few false starts, we decided to give it a go.”
And yet, their off brand scotch, tea and toast had gotten him through some dark times. Even at, looking at his watch, was roughly four past 4:30, he knew where he was headed. The voice in his head reminded him it was a bad idea and he tucked it away. He’d rather get good and drunk now and just deal with the consequences later when—

This wasn’t only designed to kill, but to maim and forever dismember, stinging barbs home grown from ages of mistrust.
“Yeah,” Harry added, “There’s a great little Italian place up the high street that we’ve been to a few times, nice and cozy.”

“How did you two meet?” Cynthia asked, after thanking the waiter for a refill.
Abstractly he knew that was true.
His life was far too strange. Strange enough that he didn’t even protest, knowing that the night alone would be trying enough, due to the sheer amount of oddities happening.
During the year in magical seclusion, he didn’t have much to do, and there wasn’t much in terms of the muggle village near the manor, so he ended up walking around to pass the time. And when that became boring, he read everything in the tiny place. And when he ran out of cheap romance paperbacks and a collection of dull books by someone named Dickens, he found his way to the library and kept reading there. Luckily, his interactions with the Muggles were slow, or entirely soundless, and bit by bit, he got used to them. And while he did, he read their books. Mostly fiction, the classics, as the librarian would tell him,
Which is why when Draco is waiting outside the pub (thinking all the while, and for the umpteenth time, that the

“Hmm, seems fairly cut and dry to me but that’s your own choice and volition then, Mr. Malfoy.”
“Please,” the woman’s voice was shallow and weak and he hand to strain to hear her, leaning in over the doorstep but not actually stepping in, “Please save Lacey.” So long as she didn’t move much, the mirrors would move very very slowly and he would have some shot at disarming it.
Even at the reunion party tonight, Harry hadn’t felt uncomfortable at all. He’d told everyone, or rather, he’d told Seamus, who had told everyone and really, at the end of the day, he didn’t care what anyone outside of the Weasley’s and Hermione had thought, but everyone seemed to gloss over that he was now dating a man and skip right on to former Death Eater as their sticking point. Harry understood, he did. He’d put enough of them away to know, they were bad people, doing dark deeds for no reason other than self superiority. But in Draco Malfoy, he recognized something of himself, as strange as it was, in the desire to fit in, to be loved. If he could, he would have killed Lucius himself just for the self doubt that he had forced upon his son and made Draco think that he was less than worthy, that he'd have to fight a war to be that way, that blood was equivalent to superiority. Maybe it was an overreaction at the ghosts that surrounded them but
“Please take me back,” Harry murmured, leaning in for more before Draco ducked out of his way.
Draco waited.
It was almost a death eater mask, but not quite. The face too long, the colors too bold with bright blue swirls and shapes, but the gaping, stitched maw was the same. Draco froze.
“And you?” The bartender wasn’t as old as he thought on first glance, but his face

Draco stared at him, afraid that if he looked away, he’d end up tearing up or something silly like that. It was what he didn’t want to hear, but needed to hear, yes, but he didn’t believe it yet, this ‘truth’ he’d spoken. Not at all.
“More or less.”
“Never took you as much of a reader,” Potter admitted, “Or at least not someone who read for fun.”
“Why on earth—“
“For money, you know, a job,” the reddish-brown skinned man looked at him, quickly sliding his eyes across his form before turning back to plates, “Aside from being the Malfoy heir.”
He stared at the ghost of Harry across from him, breathing just as heavily and probably thinking just the same things as he was.

“Wait,” Weasley interjected, removing his robes to reveal a Weasley Jumper and less decent jeans than Harry’s (by Draco's measure), “I can’t have a pint—it has to be wine.”
“Well,” the Medi-witch said, “I really should take this to the Head Auror—“ she motioned to Harry to walk out of range, like it was up to Draco to distract Rebecca. His body and mouth taking over, after having seen Harry do it so often, using what he hoped was a gentler tone. “Rebecca, you said you ride your bike to school?”
Draco, if you asked him, didn’t believe in curses. He was more of a practical sort, the kind who would look for signs and signatures and real magic left behind in the silent houses he would sweep through. Privately, he would not admit to it, but he did believe in

Draco wasn’t sure what to feel, so he resorted to what he knew, the safe comfortable shell he’d spent years cultivating. He opened his mouth to make a cutting remark but Weasley, apparently, beat him to it.
Draco composed himself, blind to the small splinters still clinging to his cloak and the small cuts along his temple, but well enough to know that he should at least exit with dignity.
It was roughly a eight or nine square meter space, with one long wall where the door sat, covered in bookshelves, case law and filing cabinets, which carried around the corner, past the small table with the tea service bubbling along, around behind the desk, where it looked like the files and books and case law turned more personal and had stuffed toys, blankets and spare clothes before turning into a coat rack where Harry hung up his slightly damp cloak. He wasn’t dressed as a wizard usually was, or an auror usually was at the least, instead wearing jeans and an odd muggle jumper advertising Greenwich University. His desk was relatively orderly, a cup of quills and strange devices sitting on the desk, parchment and other forms of paper in neat piles, a stack of memos and notes in their appropriate boxes. Above it sat a few muggle and non-muggle photos of deceased family and his living friends. Along the wall opposite of the desk and next to the fireplace was the small blue couch, where Lacey was currently tucked under a blanket and holding her mug of tea, staring into the flames. Above the couch was a false window that looked for all purposes, as though you could see a silent view of the Thames running by. It was entrancing to watch.
“Just like how everyone learns charms or potions or transfiguration. Just, Maths and literature and grammar and such.”
Therefore, they created all these super complex, delicate and dark Magic’s to supplement natural talent. It’s kind of like this: dogs can be bred for specific traits, giving us unique breeds. However, go too deep into it and all of the niche breeds have health problems abound and don’t last long. Mutts will outlive anything as far as I can tell and it’s the same with Wizards. Pure bloods created this class of hereditary, monetary status but the natural talent, the natural abilities were squelched. So yeah: when you breed out instinct, you lose that ease of use.
He missed her as much as Draco did, perhaps even more. Something in him called to her, a protective and fierce part he knew was family, in the way that that part had called to Ron and Hermione, and to Sirius and to Remus and Tonks and now to Teddy.

Bare.
Here and there, he would cancel a dinner or a meetup or a pub afternoon, even if he desperately needed it, instead reading alone in his flat. He took longer to respond to the owls or would miss floo calls entirely. He went to one more outing of Hogwarts graduates, just to fulfill his promise, before declining them ever since. Though invited, he never went back to Harry’s office snug between the second and third floor and he never went back to his flat, sure if he even took one step he would just fall harder and his hard work would be undone. He never outright lied, because that would be admitting that what he was doing was wrong when it wasn’t.
Harry turned back to argue but Draco was already stalking off in the opposite direction, throwing up two fingers in defiance over his shoulder, not wanting to parse out whatever Weasley was being enigmatic about again. He wasn’t
“Wine.” He reiterated firmly, chin jutting out as if to challenge him, “If it’s wine, then ‘Mione will think we were at dinner instead of getting plastered at a bar.” Draco could only raise an eyebrow in response but before he could make a cutting remark, Harry added in, “I think that’s fine with me.

“It’s because of all you’ve done,” Harry said, without malice or preamble, “At any point, you could have just denied it or lied or fucked off somewhere with your money. But you told your story, all the bad bits included.” He let out a long breath, hand sliding into Draco’s like it belonged there. “I don’t know if I could have done that.”
“Could be worse,” Potter countered, giving him that same small smile.
“You don’t have weird names for your school tests in America?”
“In Muggle primary school or—“
He’d never expected this. Never once dreamed that in any reality, he would be this happy after a date with Draco Malfoy. You could have told him, at any point in his life, that he would be here and he wouldn’t believe it. Not ever. And now.
and daily news and everything in between, even after it had been shut off and rolled away.
“I don’t—
if that isn’t the best sound he’s heard all day.
Once Lacey was settled, Harry also took his cloak, gently hanging it up to dry as well and guided him to the cushy chair sitting in front of his desk. The wireless on the mantle kicked on and classical music began playing out of it softly, and while he was drying himself off, rolling up his sleeves with no hesitation—Harry has already seen the mark long before, when it was a stark contrast to his pale skin— he felt a warm drowsiness settle in. He sat heavily but gracefully in the chair opposite Harry's. He would just rest his eyes for a second.
“For your girlfriend?”
What they don’t tell you about in much of dark magic cursebreaking, as small a field as it is, is that sometimes, there’s not much you can do to actually break the curse. Most curses were intended to be used in the moment, when emotions, or lack there of, where high and potent, giving each curse an extra edge. But dark curses settled into objects, festering like mold, those could be violent and deadly, twisting just as much as their creators. It was rarely possible to know the exact effects of the curse itself, particularly if the creator was dead.
Which is why, in Harry’s rather cramped office (it wasn’t so much made for four grown adults as it were one maybe two adults and a child) between the second and third floor of the Ministry while Harry caught them up to speed.
We could stay like this forever

It wasn’t an ideal way to pass hours but reading their books, watching their movements, their lives, he started to sympathize with them. They were just as unhappy as he was at times, lost in a world where they couldn’t change without magic and yet...at times they were happy. Blindingly happy in their own world. He couldn’t help but think of
(far too deep of a look into himself) and even more. When the librarian knew he was going to read essentially everything they had, she gave him a list to go through: 100 Books to Read Before You Die. And after a while, more popular books of the day, to cut through all of the older prose he was reading.
of all things and I was ready to go home and face the nightmares again and she kept giving me these sad looks and she told me it was alright to stop fighting now.” He inhaled again, letting it out with barely a tremor. “That was all she said. That it was safe to stop fighting now, Harry, you’re safe now and I don’t remember much of that night aside from that. According to Hermione, I completely broke down and
Usually, a prospective family or the government would contact the firm on the property in question. The lower level breakers would research the property, followed by an initial look by the junior partners to feel out the limits in the curses. These two groups would return and present these notes to the partners or advanced members of the firm, who would determine the best suited member and potential courses of action. Final discretion was always left up to the head curse breaker, but often the majority of the busywork was left to younger members. Then the curse breaker for the case would formulate a plan, come up with how they would resolve the curses and potential curses, and assume any contingencies they might need. In the end, it was a little bit clinical. The research, the diagnosis, the treatment. Mostly solitary, mostly mentally taxing but emotionally devoid, the places empty and bare of wizard or witch affects.
“What’ll it be?”
Draco stood up stiffly as well, noting how much time had passed sitting here talking, and followed the other man to the hall, lights being turned on as they went. They passed the little water closet, which was indeed, filled with things to make it hospitable, soaps, towels, even a little bowl of decorative stones. “And then this is the office,” Harry pushes the doors to the side and it was clear to see that this was a far better looking room, there was a print on the wall, even.
When had he turned the tap on?
The last part was the final and most brilliant part of his plan, and ultimately where Draco and his mother had ended up. Since there were too many people who were implicated enough that needed punishing but not nearly enough that warranted permanent banishment from magic, they were instead blocked from magic for a period of time, wands confiscated, wards in place and left in muggle villages across the country, under observation but mostly left alone. It was low cost and had an
“He actually said more about you than anything else,” he slowed to a stop a few steps ahead of him, turning back to look at him, “Something about me helping you settle and that if that’s what I could help you with, he was alright with the reasonably weird things going on.”
He’d never felt his place in the world as being small. In fact, at times, it seemed like their now apparently small island was the only one in existence, floating outside of ominous words like World War and Cold War and Genocide. Yet now he was starting to think that it was less ignorance and more isolation. So much destruction in such little time, now subsisting in footnotes.
After that, Granger—Hermione now—invites him into the conversation asking him about the work they’d done on a muggle school in north Sussex a few weeks prior and Ronald keeps plying him with beer and Luna stops by twice more to report on people’s reactions to them (slowly growing the umbrella’s in her garden of hair) and even Longbottom stops by, remarks that he didn’t believe until he saw it and that he’s alright with it all but one step out of place and he’ll punch him with such drunken seriousness he starts—which only serves to send Granger into lightly scolding him, red wine in hand about inciting violence in a muggle pub and Ronald into peels of drunk laughter and Harry to smile and grip him on the shoulder until he relaxes.
“Yes, and I don’t take any objects home. Usually only case files or texts on curses. We keep them in a warded drawer in the study.” They’d practiced those answers a dozen times, so often he felt they were more study partners in school than romantic partners.
Then there was a small staircase that went up to the top floor, a bathroom that also functioned as the loo for the first story, which Rebecca would have use of, next to the plain room with a decent closet and view overlooking the garden. Their own room had a decently sized bathroom between their walk in closet (his suits really only could be hung up) and the master suite which overlooked the street. It was a nice place, very large without all the furniture.
