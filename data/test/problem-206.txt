Hermione smiled reassuringly at him, pausing for a moment before answering. If anyone had told her as a teenager that years down the line, her and Draco Malfoy would come to rely on one another, basically as in-laws, she would have laughed in their face.
“Harry, why don’t you lay down for a bit? I’m gonna get Scorp and Teddy settled, and then I’ll be back, okay?” Harry just looked up at him for a moment, dazed.
“Oh. Well I wouldn't want us to catch that,” Harry laughed, and the sound of it took Draco's breath away.
“Not yet, no. You eat. I'm gonna send another Patronus. I was thinking I ought to try Ron this time since Kingsley hasn't gotten back to us.”
Harry finished drying his hands and turned to face Draco, brushing a hand through his messy hair. Draco looked into those worried green eyes before pulling Harry into a calming hug.
Draco was testing Harry, willing his husband to be honest. No way in hell was he going to go to work if Harry turned up with the flu as well.
“Good. I’ll be back soon,” Harry said, carrying the crying baby out of Teddy’s room and down the hall into the master bedroom.
“I can't Potter! This is highly contagious.” He scratched at the rash on his fingers and realized his hands were shaking.
Draco shook his head in disbelief. “Surely someone would have made sure you got your proper vaccinations. Madam Pomfrey must've done it.”
But that was life. It wasn't fair, and it made him worry all the more each time Draco became ill because it all could have prevented if Draco's family had cherished him as they should have. Harry supposed he and Draco had that in common.
“Sir,” The Healer to Harry's left spoke to the one who'd been talking with Draco, “The infection has spread to his lungs. It's more advanced than we thought.”
Draco looked down a Harry with a smile, holding him close. Even an ounce of the man's usual sarcasm put his heart at ease, though his shallow breathing was sounding increasingly labored.
Draco nodded, watched suspiciously as Harry and slid up out of the little bed and left the room. ‘Please,’ he thought to himself, ‘please don’t let Harry be catching this flu.”
Hermione handed Draco the messenger bag he’d packed for Harry, which he slung over his shoulder. “Okay Har. I’m going to side-along you to St. Mungo’s. Can you stand?”
Draco cast a charm to check Teddy’s temperature, which read 100.3. Not, great, but not terrible. Although he wanted to let the boy rest, he knew needed to wake up and get him to drink something. It would help keep his fever from worsening. Draco used Aguamenti to conjure fresh water in the glass on Teddy’s bedside table and then gently shook the boy’s shoulder.
“Please?” He asked again with a slight smile, and Draco begrudgingly laid back down, albeit much further from Harry than he had been, to begin with. “Are you warm enough?”
“I am going to ask you to calm down Mr. Malfoy. Yelling about this isn't going to benefit either of you.” Harry's wide green eyes met Draco's as the Healers pushed him in his bed out of the room.
“Okay, but the one at eleven was a booster shot. We got the initial vaccine when we were younger, maybe three or four.”
“Harry, I love you. You aren’t a burden. You aren’t with the Dursley’s anymore.” He squeezed Harry’s hand. “We all cherish you.” Draco pointed to a corner of the room where there were cards and piles of sweets. “You’ve had so many visitors in the past few days.”
“Is he okay?” Teddy sniffed. The nine-year-old was looking extremely pale again, and Draco wondered how long he’d been looking after Scorpio with Harry being so out of it. Thank Merlin Ted wasn’t sicker, and that he’d had the good sense to call for help.
“Harry! You’re awake!” Draco uncurled himself from the bed and rushed to Harry’s side. “How are you feeling?”
He turned back to glance at Harry, who’s stomach was beginning to settle. He was covered in a sheen of sweat and was still panting exhaustedly.
“That’s so nice. But to be honest, all I want to do go home. I want to curl up in our bed with all three of my boys. And I want to have a bowl of your mother’s sick-day-soup.”
“Malfoy, exactly how bad is this?” Harry asked. “I mean, I have never seen anyone with Dragon Pox before. I know my grandparents died from it.”
“Never...? Malfoy, I don't understand,” Hermione exclaimed, sitting down next to Harry and beginning to fuss over him.
Harry brushed a stray lock of hair off of Draco's face, allowing his fingers to trail down the man's burning cheek for a few seconds longer than necessary. He knew he shouldn't be touching him if he hadn't been vaccinated, but he figured the damage was done.“Sleep, then. I'll be right here.”
After staying with Teddy for a little while to reassure him and make him as comfortable as possible, Draco carried Scorpius into the nursery. He peeked in at Harry as he passed the master bedroom and saw that his husband was asleep.
Another four hours later, and it was evident to Harry that he wouldn't be able to stay awake the entire night. He had eaten a protein bar from the bag, hoping that would give him a burst of energy. It worked for a while, but it was wearing off, and he was developing a persistent headache, though from exhaustion or stress he wasn't sure. He sat still for a long while, listening to Draco's congested breathing and willing his eyes to stay open, but it was a losing battle.
The next thing Harry knew, he was being shaken awake. It took him a minute before he realized he was lying face down on the kitchen floor, where he’d collapsed midway scrubbing the floor. Vernon was angry, but Harry was so out of it he nearly couldn’t process Vernon’s anger. There had been so much yelling, and then Harry was grabbed by his collar and dragged into his cupboard under the stairs. He barely came out for days. It took weeks for Petunia to stop reminding him of what a useless burden he was, which made him worse than he’d felt when he’d been sick.
Walking into the master bedroom, Draco saw that Harry was shivering, even under the mess of blankets. His dark hair laid flat and stuck to his forehead. As much as Draco wanted to let him rest, he needed to check his fever, and probably try to get some potions into him.
Harry loved Draco. He really did. But whenever Harry was sick, Draco would declare him useless and send him off to bed like a child. And that just made Harry feel worse. He didn’t need to be waited on hand and foot just because he had a runny nose. Right now Teddy was sick, and Harry needed to be there for his son. This was not the time to get sick himself.
Harry's thoughts were racing. “We don't have tea, but I can try and heat some water for you to drink if you like? Might be good for your throat.”
Draco turned the corner, finally arriving at the apparition point, and apparited home. He emerged in his warm kitchen just in time to hear the tea kettle start whistling.
Levitating behind Draco was a huge pot of homemade chicken noodle sick-day soup, a centuries-old Malfoy family recipe. Narcissa had asked the house elves to whip it up to moment Harry fire-called to tell her he needed her to take care of her darling grandson. It was the one thing that any Malfoy (or, Malfoy-Potter in this case) needed to recover from any sort of malady. A historic cure-all, from flu to heartbreak. And it was one of Draco’s favorites.
“Malfoy, I never applied to be an Auror! Robards recruited me after the war, and I just accepted. I never applied!”
“I am fine!” Harry said, brushed a strand Scorpius’s wispy blonde hair behind his little ear. “Ted’s been better. I just got his fever under control. Have you spoken to Draco today?”
He climbed the stairs to Dudley’s room and knocked on the door. “Aunt Petunia,” Harry sniffed, “I don’t feel so good.”
Harry walked slowly up the stairs to Teddy’s room. All of his muscles ached, and it reminded him of his time training to be an Auror. It had been a good job, and he was looking forward to joining the force again someday. But right now, he was happy to spend his days at home with his sons.
“It's fine, we'll enlarge your blanket.” Under his summer robes, Harry was wearing a thin navy blue button-down shirt with the sleeves rolled up and gray plaid trousers. Draco couldn't help but stare at his partner's tidy appearance. When he tried, the man was downright gorgeous. Actually, he could be gorgeous even when he wasn't trying. Draco thought back to last Friday when he and Harry celebrated closing a big case by going out for a drink together at Draco's favorite place, The Rainy Bell Tavern. Harry had gone home to change after work and had shown up wearing worn-out jeans and a simple black cotton V-neck that accentuated his chest. His toned muscles took Draco's breath away. Where Draco had always been long-limbed and wiry, Harry was solid and strong in all the right places.
“Hmm,” Draco frowned. “Pepper-up hasn’t been doing much for this year’s strain, but we have some fever reducing potion in the potion cabinet if you think Teddy needs it.”
Harry began being pulled from the nightmarish memory of his past. He heard Scorpius crying and felt a little hand tugging his shirtsleeve.
“Let me see. It'd be great if we could cover the window with something. At least attempt to keep all that snow from falling in on us.” Draco shivered and reached blindly into his bag. He pulled out a dish sponge. “Will this work for anything?”
Surely it was just worry, or exhaustion from his stressful day. He didn’t feel like he was catching the flu, did he?
“Will you at least eat something first? Our portkey will stay active for at least another 20 minutes.”
Harry smiled and carefully removed himself from Teddy, who merely coughed a couple of times and rolled over, falling back into a deep sleep. Harry blinked for a moment, swallowing. His throat hurt. Draco handed him a mug of warm tea and took a few sips.
Harry made his way back to Teddy’s room. The nine-year-old was resting fitfully, his brow furrowed. Harry couldn’t believe that he’d gotten so sick so fast. This morning, he’d seemed mostly fine. Maybe just a little quieter than usual. But by midday, Harry knew we was coming down with something. Teddy had no interest in eating lunch, and his complexion had taken on a distinct paleness that Harry came to recognize over the years as his guardian.
“Mhmm.” Draco said suspiciously, taking one last swig of his wine and then standing up to clear his dishes. “Have I told you recently,” Draco started, still playing him, “that you are honestly such a fantastic father? And Husband?” He put a lot of emphasis on the word honestly. Perhaps that would drive his point home.
“I have good friends,” he agreed, and then after a moment of thought he asked, “We're friends, right Draco?”
“I've sent a Patronus to the office, but no one's responded yet. And as far as I can tell, we are alone here. I can't trace any magical signatures on the lock or the window, so whatever is keeping us here isn't recent magic.”
Teddy shook his head. “No. My belly hurts.” He turned away to cough into his elbow. “And I keep having to cough”.
“That can't be possible. Besides, we all had to provide proof of immunizations with our application to start Auror training.” Draco watched as Harry's face morphed from confusion to full-blown panic.
Clearly he hadn’t been paying enough attention to his husband. He’d been going on and on about how busy the apothecary had been, and how families needed him to keep making potions. He even said it yesterday when he was passively trying to get Harry to admit to being ill. Sure, yesterday he’d been joking, but it was just like Harry to put everyone ahead of himself.
“Better. Thanks.” Draco replied as Harry climbed back under the blanket with him again. Reaching back into his bag, Draco pulled out a thick blue sweater and pushed it into Harry's hands. "Put it on. Please?” he added and was grateful to see that for once, Harry did what he was told. Draco then pulled out some more clothes and transfigured them into pillows. They would be lumpy, but they would elevate his head which would be good for his sinuses. He passed a pillow to harry, who accepted it gratefully.
Draco sighed. “My Grandfather did too. But they were old when they caught it. And it really isn't as severe as it used to be. The vaccine should make it relatively mild.”
Walking downstairs, Harry swallowed thickly and realized for the first time how sore his throat was. He thought about making himself a coffee, or maybe try to eat some of the orange slices Draco had left for him. But his stomach hurt, and he thought caffeine or fruit might make it worse. He realized that he should probably take his own temperature. He whispered a quick diagnostic spell, and after a moment, his temp appeared in the air by his wand. It read 102.1. That was definitely higher than Harry had expected. Maybe if he took some potions before Draco got home he could get himself back under control. Just as he was about to Accio a fever-reducing potion for himself, he heard Teddy’s cries from upstairs.
Finally admitting defeat, Harry spelled some wards to wake him if anyone approached the cell, or if they received word from the office. His robes on the window were only doing so much to keep the cold away, and he was wary of putting up another heating charm with Draco's rising fever. In the end, he decided on placing a personal warming charm on the sweater he was wearing. Draco's sweater. Which smelled like him, as did the blanket and pillows, and Draco himself, who lay not a foot from Harry. For all the times' Harry had fantasized about the first time he and Draco might share a bed, this was not what he'd envisioned. He rolled over to face the blonde and saw that his brow was furrowed tightly in his sleep. Another nightmare, Harry supposed. He knew Draco had them regularly. Harry reached out from under the blanket and took Draco's hand into his, his thumb rubbing small circles onto the man's palm in an attempt to calm him. The repetitive motion relaxed Harry, and he soon drifted off to sleep, his hand still entwined with Draco's.
He heard his sons, and he knew they needed him, but he was struggling to wake up. His eyes felt cemented shut.
Harry chuckled, though he felt himself getting tired again. He pulled the blankets tighter around himself.
Eventually Draco came downstairs, dressed in green silk pajama pants and a white t-shirt. “Hey, I didn’t expect you to be making dinner.”
Harry nodded and held the handkerchief out to him. Draco's fingers grasped it tightly, his hand just centimeters under Harry's. A moment later they both felt a familiar tug on their belly buttons.
Draco pulled back from Harry, leaving both hands to rest on his husband’s shoulders. “Think you can hold down the fort here for just a little longer? I want to pop over to the Manor for a bit. I brought home some Echinacea potion from work today, maybe that will help keep Scorpius from catching it. I took some this morning, but you should take some yourself. It’s in my coat pocket downstairs.”
Harry looked up just in time to Draco’s face fall in disappointment. He felt a knot of guilt twist up in his stomach that had nothing to do with his flu.
Draco was definitely warm, but not alarmingly so. Harry would have to watch him throughout the night. He looked down from where he was sitting against the wall and questioned how Draco could still be so beautiful, even when sick. It baffled Harry how Draco could look like he did and not have people fawning after him all the time. In the year they'd been partnered together, Harry couldn't remember Draco ever talking about a relationship, or even a hook-up. Harry would know, they spent all week and much of the weekend together after. Logically, Harry knew that the public was still wary of Draco and Narcissa's loyalty after the war. He wasn't blind, he saw how witnesses frequently spoke directly to him and ignored Draco altogether. It made Harry's blood boil. Couldn't people see how strong Draco had been, enduring his own father's Imperius, and then going on to build a life for himself?
“You got it” Draco replied. “Why don’t you lay here next to Papa and I’ll go get us some popsicles, okay?”
St. Mungo's kept Draco and Harry together in adjoining beds, and the room was an overwhelming flurry of activity. Harry slept through most of it, And Draco fought to stay awake to help answer the Healer's questions.
“Yes. Picked it up from George’s kids. They are dealing well enough. Still bickering over their toys, so I take that as a good sign. I did go to pick up some potions at your shop earlier. Blaise said you guys have it too?”
Draco could feel the green eyes boring into him, and he curled gracefully down into the transfigured mattress, adjusting the pillows and pulling the blanket up to his chin. His eyelids suddenly felt so heavy. “Will you sleep tonight?”
“You did, actually. Although apparently you were being drugged at the time,” Harry smirked. The bastard.
“We need to get him into a pressure chamber and pump the air with potions to clear the smoke in his lungs.”
“But, Pans, look at the bigger picture. Would you rather watch a bunch of witches fly around on broomsticks, or would you rather be the very image of a domestic heroine, swooping in to save the wizarding world from all of their ailments?”
Draco breathed a sigh of relief as he watched Teddy climb up onto the bed and slide into Harry’s arms. Harry remembered his son, so that was a good sign. He went back to packing in silence. Walking over to the dresser, Draco reached a drawer and pulled out Harry’s favorite pair of flannel pajamas, the red ones with the golden snitch pattern.
Down the hall, he could hear a few noisy Aurors discussing their plans for the weekend. Potter had invited Draco to join him at the Weasley's for Teddy's fifth birthday party on Saturday, and Draco was considering taking him up on the offer. Last time they'd been over at Andromeda's Teddy nearly talked his ear off about the party, and since the boy was his cousin, he really shouldn't miss it.
There was a sharp November chill in the air, and it had been raining for two days straight. While Draco truly did love his job, some days certainly took more of a toll on him than others. The apothecary has been busy this week. It was flu season.
‘This morning I woke up and discovered that Scorpius is under the weather. I’m so sorry, I had hoped that isolating him from his brother might have prevented him from becoming ill. He is resting now, but when he wakes I will bring him to you. Let me know if there is anything else you need.
“Draco,” Harry bit his lip before a series of coughs interrupted his thoughts. Draco waited patiently and handed him a glass of water for him to sip on.
Draco waved a hand at him before scrunching his nose up and sneezing quickly in his elbow, nearly dropping the soup.  He winced, swallowing hard. That definitely felt like it burned.
Harry performed a couple of spells on his robes and then pressed the fabric taut against the edges of the window where it clung firmly.
Harry looked him dead in the eyes for a moment before responding daringly, “You are too, you know. Honestly.” he responded.
Draco reached into his bag and pulled out small fleece cloth. He enlarged it into a thick fleece blanket before handing it to Harry. “I suppose we are going to have to make ourselves comfortable.”
Hermione took a deep breath. “He didn’t kidnap us, but I agree, we... er...we do need to get back to Hogwarts”. Hermione lied, glancing sideways at Draco. As smart as ever, Hermione had realized that going along with whatever Harry was imagining would be a lot easier than freaking him out.
“Takes a lot of energy away from your healing to be worried sick over someone you love, doesn't it?” Pansy smirked.
“I don’t know...” Draco started, as if in a trance. He stared into the bright and glassy emerald eyes which were glaring back at him. His husband was covered in sweat. He looked sicker than Draco had ever seen him, and he was terrifying. It was as if his husband had transformed back into his sixteen year old self. Draco turned quickly away to start packing Harry a bag to bring with them to St. Mungo’s, but he was so worried he could barely think straight. If Harry’s fever was so high he was forgetting literal years of information, then Draco probably should have gotten him to St. Mungo’s hours ago.
“Haven’t you learned to expect the unexpected around me? I mean, you did marry the golden boy,” Harry teased.
“Shhh, shh, please Scorpius. We all need to rest,” Harry muttered hoarsely, sitting up and rubbing the baby’s back.
‘And so, the game begins,’ he thought. ‘I just hope I can find someone to cover the apothecary. No way am I going to be able to go to work this week if Harry is sick too.’
“Yes, of course, dear. Anytime. You take care of yourself.” Narcissa glanced at him knowingly before appariting away.
Harry shut the window and turned back to Teddy, one hand coming up to rub at his temple. He had a serious headache coming on. “That was Nana,” he sighed. “Scorp is sick now too”.
Meanwhile, Draco was scheming. In an overly exaggerated voice, he stated, “So I was thinking about tomorrow,” Draco started. “Normally I’d close the apothecary for a few days to help out around here, but I don’t know if that’s a good idea this time. There were so many mums who came in to buy potions for their families, I’d hate to not be there for them. They trust me, you know?”
Harry was sitting on the edge of his bed, debating whether or not to go downstairs and get started on something for dinner. If he was being honest, he wasn’t very hungry. In fact, if he was being extremely honest, he could feel his stomach churning. He thought Draco’s immunity potion might even set him over the edge.
Harry raced up the stairs, but he was too late. The potion must have upset Teddy’s stomach. He was hunched over, sicking up onto the blankets. Harry grabbed the garbage bin from the corner of the room and rushed it under the boy’s chin. He rubbed circles on Teddy’s back, doing his best to calm him until he was finished choking over the bin. Watching the whole scenario was making Harry’s stomach turn dangerously, and he swallowed
“I am not a mother goose!” Harry exclaimed, but with a ‘pop’ the blonde was gone. Harry simply shook his head and turned to look at himself in the mirror. He could see dark circles forming under his eyes. He was a worried mother goose.
“But just so you know, Potter,” Draco said, poking the brunette jokingly in the ribs, “if you ever scare me like this again, I swear I’ll kill you myself.”
Draco was terrified, but he wasn't about to tell that to Harry. The man needed him to be the strong one for once. “It's okay Harry. It's only temporary. You're going to be okay.” Harry was trembling in Draco's arms, though from fear of fever Draco didn't know.
‘This day will never end ...’ Harry thought. He wondered if he should just owl Draco and admit defeat. He’d been napping all day, and after waking up from each nap, he’d felt worse. He didn’t know how much longer he could go on by himself with two sick kids. Harry felt himself start to get emotional, which was a sure sign that his own fever was rising. The boy who lived could usually keep his cool in situations like these.
Draco put the cups of tea on the bedside table and gently shook Harry’s shoulder. Green eyes slowly cracked open to peer up at him.
“Dray, I don’t... I can...” Harry started, flustered. But that was all he could manage before doubling over the bin for the third time. Scorpius, still in Teddy’s arms began whimpering again and Draco moved away from Harry to gather the baby in his arms.
Theodore Nott had been the first one to suggest that Draco get checked for an immunodeficiency disorder. Draco had visited St. Mungo's on four separate occasions during Theo's first rotation as an Apprentice Healer. He connected Draco to a specialist who agreed that his immune system was impaired, and who theorized that it was due to the extreme stress of enduring the Imperius curse for so long.
It was cold. Unbearably cold. He was in at Privet Drive, and he couldn’t have been any more than nine years old; the same age as Teddy is now.
“About Scorpius, you mean? No, I haven’t. I assumed you'd want to inform your husband yourself.” Narcissa smiled politely. “Is there anything you need? I must admit, you are not looking so well yourself.”
Teddy reluctantly took one more sip of the water before handing the glass back to Draco, who set it on the bedside table.
“We tried! We already tried. There's no way out! We have to wait for help, and you need to sit back down before you collapse or something. You've barely eaten today.”
Harry made a low sound of sympathy and handed Draco the cool goblet of water. He ran a hand through his hair again, wondering what was taking the Aurors so long to find them. He laid a hand across Draco's brow, which made the man flinch. “You're pretty warm, do you want to take a fever reducer?”
“Any chance you can you think of a place in Scotland where it snows in July?” Draco looked over to Harry and watched as his eyes darted rapidly around the dark room. The Ministry had never given them a faulty portkey before.
Harry tried to lift himself up off of the bed, but his muscles wouldn’t offer him much support. After a few moments of struggling, he gave up and looking down at the floor, whispered a quiet, “I’m sorry.”
Draco glanced over at the messy desk across from his and found the equally messy mop of dark hair belonging to his Auror partner. Harry Potter was slouched over, scribbling furiously at a piece of parchment. There were stacks and stacks of paperwork littering the man's desk, some decorated with coffee rings, many decorated with spilled ink. The man was constantly in a state of disarray, and Draco loathed himself for finding it endearing.
Groaning in effort, Harry rolled to his side to get a better look at his surroundings. He was definitely in St. Mungo’s, in a single room of his own. Harry had come to learn a single room meant that whatever had happened to him had been serious and that he’d probably been out for some time.
“He slept in for a while this morning, and by lunchtime, he was running a fever. He has been coughing and sicking up all day. And complaining of a sore throat.”
“We need to get him to St. Mungo's right now!” Draco exclaimed as the team barreled their way into the cell. “He never got vaccinated.” Harry was exhaustedly sinking back down onto their makeshift mattress.
“Yes, but you are sick, and you could get worse and we need to be prepared for that,” He replied seriously. Harry could see that their time here was taking a toll on his partner. “It's nearly five o'clock in London. You should eat something out of your bag.”
“Would it be alright with you if I rest my eyes for a bit?” Draco asked, his voice sounding incredibly scratchy, probably from the cold air. He had half a mind to be embarrassed about it, but Harry had seen him ill enough times that it hardly made a difference anymore.
Draco glanced down at the still sleeping Teddy. Normally, Draco loved catching a peek at Teddy when he was asleep, as it was one of the rare times his appearance was untouched and he truly looked like himself. But tonight, he looked white as a sheet. His dark hair was damp around the edges of his hairline, and there were bright pink blotches on both his cheeks. He didn’t like to see him looking so sick. Sure, Teddy was adopted, but the normally vibrant and loud boy was just as much Draco and Harry’s son as Scorpius was. Draco would do anything to keep him healthy and safe.
“I think we better give our boys a second to themselves,” Hermione said, letting go of Harry's hand and standing. The rest of their friends followed her out of the room. Draco could feel the blush burning through his cheeks.
Draco frowned. “I said I would be going home to them shortly. I’m doing the best I can. They’ll manage another hour.”
Draco Malfoy was finally heading to the apparition point after a very long day at work. This year marked his third year of running his own apothecary and pharmacy on Diagon Alley, and as he trudged through the gray and drizzling English streets, he found himself once again annoyed at the Ministry of Magic’s new regulations regarding apparition.
“Ugh... My nose feels like its burning.” Draco moaned, rubbing a hand over his face once again and flopping back down ungracefully onto the pillows. His hand rested over his eyes, and it was a pitiful sight.
Harry coughed again into his elbow. He felt as though he could feel his chest rattling with each cough. Merlin, what he wouldn’t give to just lie down for a bit. Harry sighed wistfully. Later, he promised himself, I will rest. Just as soon as I can get Teddy’s fever down. Harry had forgotten all about his own rising fever.
but there you are. Not hard to come to a conclusion.” Harry fights down a flush, but Pansy’s no longer watching him anyways.
The men left Kingsley's office and walked back to theirs. As expected, Draco set off quickly to gather random supplies in his brown leather messenger bag.  He brought it with him whenever they went out into the field, and Harry knew it was filled with everything from emergency potions, extra clothes, and even some snacks.
Hermione and Draco both sucked in a breath, looking over to Teddy. Would Harry recognize his children right now?
After settling the soup away, Draco used a charm to reheat their forgotten mugs of tea and carried them both upstairs to find Harry. Once again the house was silent. He first looked in their master bedroom, and then in Teddy’s. What he saw upon entering the room was two very sleepy boys curled up in one very small bed. All the blankets were pushed to the end of the bed, and Teddy had managed to squirm half of himself on top of Harry without either of them waking. Draco could hear soft, congested snores coming from his son. The sight of the two of them made Draco’s heart soar.
“Not this week I don’t. Ginny has her first championship game with the Harpies. In Germany. And I’ll be damned if I don’t get to go see that.”
“You’re undermining my bravery, Potter?” He smirked down at his sick husband, whose eyes were now fluttering closed. “What are you, scared?”
Harry saw that had an IV in his arm, connected to the machine that was endlessly beeping. And then he saw his husband, curled uncomfortably in a chair next to his bed, fast asleep. Although his muscles ached with every move, Harry reached out and took Draco’s hand into his own. Draco’s eyes snapped open at his husband’s touch.
Only about two hours in, Draco began tossing and turning in his sleep. He was muttering incomprehensibly and it was clear that he was having a nightmare, but Harry wasn't sure whether to wake him up or just let him ride it out on his own. He gently reached out to feel in his fever had risen, but his hand froze in midair as Draco startled awake. His glazed eyes focused on Harry in a panic, and it took a long moment before his brain finally caught on the fact that he was not in any imminent danger.  Breathing heavily, Draco immediately scrunched up his forehead in pain.
“This was supposed to be an easy mission. We were supposed to have been home by now.” Harry whined for the third time that hour. They were trapped, and it was freezing.
“Harry!” Hermione was suddenly standing right behind Draco, though he hadn’t heard her come through the floo. “Harry, calm down. Draco cares about you, he is trying to help you! You are very sick right now.” Hermione could that her friend was white as a ghost. There was panic and confusion written all over his face.
“... I may not be feeling my best Potter but I can assure you I am not coming down with the plague,“ Draco scoffed.
He doubted that he would be able to get Harry to swallow a fever reducer, and even if he could there was no telling whether Harry’s stomach would actually stay put and let the potion do its job. Instead, he pushed the blankets down gingerly peeled Harry’s sweater off conjuring a cool compress. Harry's body was trembling, and he made a small noise of discomfort. Draco whispered calmly to soothe him as he dabbed the compress over his forehead and chest.
“Mhmm, okay,” Draco replied, already drifting off. The last thing he was aware of was Harry's cool, calloused hand brushing against his forehead.
“Okay! But can't you just settle with the fact that we caught the bad guys, you ended up with your lover-boy, and we all lived to tell the tale?”
A couple of harsh sneezes interrupted Draco's thoughts and it felt as though they burned a path all the way down to his chest. Summer colds were the worst. The frigid air being pumped into the office was making him shiver, and he set his paperwork aside to stand and crack open a window for some warm air. His muscles were beginning to feel sluggish. It was nothing too extreme, but he'd have to check for a fever later, and maybe firecall his Healer when he got home.
Draco spent at least an hour trying to apparate, break the bars on the door, anything to get them out. He was exhausted. Harry sneezed again, which sparked but didn't ignite. He groaned at the pain of it, and reached out to Draco, taking in a labored breath.
“Get some more rest, I’m just going to be downstairs”, Harry whispered. He picked up the blankets from the floor and tucked them around Teddy, smiling as the boy snuggled down into them.
Draco remained standing, and Harry was briefly distracted by the way the blonde was worrying his bottom lip. Now was not the time.
Tears formed in Teddy’s eyes and he just stared at Draco, not understanding what was going on. To be honest, Draco didn’t understand much of it either. How could Harry remember the boys but not his own husband?
“He’s gonna be fine. Daddy and I will take care of him, just like we are taking care of you.” Harry scooped Teddy up in a hug and brushed the beginnings of tears from his cheek. He offering him a couple of sips of cool water, and then just sat with him for a while, continuing to wipe the cool cloth across his son’s warm body. Teddy’s eyes soon began to close. Harry checked his temperature again, and the spell read 99.8. Thank Merlin for potions.
Harry scrunched his eyes shut, willing whoever it was to go away, but the knocking persisted. He realized with a start that it was Narcissa bringing his sick baby Scorpius home. Harry got up slowly, so as to not disturb Teddy. Coughing again, he slowly walked downstairs to the front door, glancing at the grandfather clock as he passed through the living room. It was only noon, but that meant that Draco would be home soon.
We're fine, Harry.“ Draco moved away from him to pushed at the bars of the steel door. It wouldn't budge. Locked then. He pulled his wand out from his sleeve and pointed it at the lock.“Alohomora!” Nothing happened. He tried again, and then Harry brushed him aside to try and get them out. After about 10 minutes of them using every spell they could think of to try and get themselves out they finally had to accept that for now, they were stuck.
Teddy nodded and Harry helped him to sit up. He gave Teddy the potion just as he heard an owl scratch at Teddy’s window. Harry helped Ted back down onto the pillows before walking over to open the window. The small pristine looking grey owl flew in, perching on Teddy’s desk. It was Narcissa’s. Harry took the note from its leg, rubbing the side of its head with his knuckle. He unraveled the note, seeing Narcissa’s elegant scrawling cursive.
As it was, Draco been gone for nearly 6 hours. He was worried about his family. Scorpius had never really been sick before, and Harry wasn’t the greatest at taking care of himself. ‘Maybe I should owl Him, and check in,’ Draco thought.
“Pansy, you and I both know that Blaise barely passed his potion O.W.L. back in fifth year. I do not trust him to make potions for my shop.”
Draco peeked out from under his hand, his dull silver eyes meeting very concerned green ones. He saw that rash as well, but he only blinked tiredly at it. “Mmm, figures, doesn't it. Couldn't have just been a simple, boring cold,” he swallowed. “Hurts to talk.”
“Please! Can't I go with him? I'm not that sick. I'll stay out of your way! I have to be with him!” His heartbeat continued to rev up and he could hear rushing in his years. A Healer who Draco didn't see to his right grasped his chin and held a potion vial to his mouth, knocking the contents of it down his throat. He was only able to yell out one final remark before his world closed into darkness.
Draco stripped off his damp robes, laying them on the back of the kitchen chair. Aside from the whistling kettle, the house was unusually quiet. Grabbing two mugs from the cupboard, he began preparing tea for himself and Harry, before going upstairs to look for his family.
“Yeah, Yeah.” Harry teased, “Thanks Healer Malfoy.” Harry took another long, soothing sip of tea. “Mmm, thanks for this”.
“We are in communication with his adoptive family. The waiting room is packed with them. I'm sure they will keep you updated.”
“You should eat.” Draco ignored him. “Are you not hungry? I can bring you back something for later?”
Harry cursed quietly to himself as the owl flew back out the open window. This was the last thing he wanted to hear right now. He had to just take this one kid at a time.
“You can say that again. Look, I know this is asking a lot, but could you please watch Teddy and Scorpius-” Draco started, but Harry interrupted Draco’s request with a sudden bout of harsh coughing. After a moment, Draco realized that Harry wasn’t stopping. His coughs were coming out too quickly, and it didn’t sound like Harry was getting much air in between them. Draco swiveled around and rushed to Harry’s side as Hermione looked on from the fire. He pulled Harry up into a sitting position, and rubbed his back, trying to calm him and get his breathing back under control. Finally, Harry’s coughing slowed, and he opened his eyes for the first time in hours.
Harry stared back into the mirror, admiring his handiwork. The glamours gave him a lively, healthy-looking complexion. Harry swallowed roughly before heading downstairs to make dinner for him and Draco.
“I don’t know,” Draco sighed. “I got him to drink some water. He’s asleep now, but when I left his temp was 101.4. We’ll have to keep checking it. Any higher and I want to give him a fever reducer and...” Draco stopped suddenly. “What are you wearing?”
His stomach began to flip-flop, and he realized he didn’t have the strength to fight the nausea this time. He quickly set Scorpius back on the bed and rushed to the trash bin.
“No. Let's wait until... well, let's just hold off on using up the potions. I just want to go back to sleep,” he answered, his eyelids feeling heavy.
Even if the spell was glitching, Harry did not want to take chances with such a high temp. He accio’d a fever reducer from Draco’s potion cabinet and conjured a washcloth and a bowl of cool water. Harry stifled a coughing fit of his own and felt his lungs burn in retaliation. Now was not the time. Harry brushed the cool wet cloth across Teddy’s head and neck and Teddy’s eyes blinked up at him.
It took Draco months to realize he had feelings for the prat, but that was all in the past now. He had been married to Harry for five years now, and they were raising two brilliant boys together.
Harry shivered, realizing for the first time that he was freezing. He got up and went to his dresser, pulling out one of his old Weasley sweaters and slipping it on. He walked over to the full-length mirror that was leaning against the wall and realized that the sweater he’d grabbed had a big green ‘D’ written over the front. Well, it didn’t much matter, it was warm. Harry noticed how pale his face was becoming, and how his hair was beginning to fall uncharacteristically flat.
Although Draco was always awake much before Harry so he could get to work, Harry usually woke fairly early to tend to Scorpius. Harry realized that he had slept the whole night on the couch in his clothes and that at some point Draco must’ve covered him with several warm blankets. Harry wanted nothing more than to close his eyes and curl back into the blankets, but he had to go check on Teddy. Groaning, Harry sat up. He was not feeling well at all. His throat hurt as if he’d been coughing all night, although he knows that if he had been, Draco never would have left.
Draco looked at the cloak covering the window, swallowing down the burn in his own throat. It had been hours since any light seeped through the fabric, so it must be night again. That meant they'd been there for a day and a half already. What was taking so long?
Nearly forty minutes later, Harry lulled Scorpius back to sleep on his chest and then drifted into a fitful sleep himself.
“Water?” He choked out, and Draco immediately raised the goblet to his lips. The water helped, but only marginally. “This all just keeps going from bad to worse,” he murmured quietly.  Once Harry was done, Draco set the goblet aside and pulled out their last fever reducer and pain potion. He uncorked them and fed them to Harry one at a time.
“What? Potter, don't be daft. Of course, we're friends.” he laughed. “Don't tell Pansy, but we might even be best friends.” Harry nodded, barely reacting, and Draco wondered if he'd remember this conversation when he woke up next. He helped Harry sink back down to the pillow and then laid down himself.
Draco sat with him for over an hour. He used a spell to cool the compress over and over, but it didn’t seem to make a difference. Harry’s fever wouldn’t break. Should he try to spell a fever reducer into him after all? For a moment, Draco considered calling his own mother over to help. Or maybe Molly?
Harry struggled to get up to help; he needed to help. He knew he needed to take care of his family, but his body had other plans. He leaned over the bin once more.
Harry had begun to feel unwell days ago. It was nothing serious, just general malaise what he couldn’t quite fit his finger on. But in true Gryffindor fashion, he had been determined to not let his husband see that he was beginning to feel sick. Draco shouldn’t be expected to handle a sick child and a sick husband all on his own.
Ron figured that anyone who saved his best friend's arse out in the field more times than he could count deserved his friendship. And if Harry someday worked up the backbone to ask Malfoy out on a proper date, Ron supposed that would be alright too.
“Hermione, he's barely lucid,” Ron complained, trying to pull Harry to his feet while one of the Aurors worked on packing up their makeshift sickroom. Once upright, Harry elbowed Ron away from him to sneeze, making the redhead yelp at the sudden sparks hitting his robes.
“Fine,” he sighed. “But I wish I'd brought my soup. And don't even bother saying I told you so. I regret it well enough on my own. I've got some granola bars. You want one?”
“We need help,” Harry tried to say, but he was nearly incomprehensible with all the cracks his voice made.
Harry suddenly doubled over and Hermione put the bin under his head in perfect time. She held him until he was finished, and then banished the mess.
“I'll be fine,” Draco defended stubbornly. The sides of his mouth turned up and with a single raised eyebrow he muttered under his breath, “Quit worrying, Mum,” before side-stepping Harry and walking into Kingsley's office to get the details of their mission. Harry laughed quietly to himself and followed him in.
“Good idea. Maybe try Granger as well.” Draco pulled out a granola bar but was only able to eat half before his aching throat decided to protest. He glanced warily at the other half of the bar before deciding to cover it carefully in the wrapper and save it for later. The persistent tickle in his nose and throat was beginning to drive him crazy.
Teddy’s eyebrows raised “I’m...I’m sorry Papa. I didn’t mean to get him sick.” His bottom lip jutted out and suddenly began quivering.
“What about something small? A popsicle?” Draco suggested, and he saw the briefest flash in his son's eyes that told him that a popsicle would do just the trick. He chuckled. “I’ll take that as a yes, what color will it be?”
Harry looked down at his lap. His fingers worried at the blanket for a moment. “Are the boys any better?” Harry finally asked.
‘Well,’ Harry thought, ‘I guess there’s no arguing with that.’ He stood up, feeling lightheaded, and realized that there was a layer of sweat across his brow and the back of his neck. He’d have to take a shower after checking Teddy.
“Yeah, I bet.” Draco bit out, although most of his venom had fallen away. “I know that you are probably still not feeling your best, but do you have any idea how upsetting it is for me that you never seem to let me in and tell me what’s going on?”
“I wonder who he caught it from this time,” Ron said. “I haven't heard of anything going around the office for at least two weeks I think.” Ron was Head Auror, so he was always informed of all the office gossip. He often warned Malfoy when someone in the department called out sick.
Draco pulled the edges of his thick wool cloak higher around his neck in an attempt to get warm. The rain drizzled down the edges of his umbrella charm and he shivered. Just one more block until the apparition point. He could’ve taken the floo directly from his office, but he had wanted to bring home some immunity boosting potions for Harry and their sons. The last thing he wanted was for one of them to be down with the flu while Draco was so busy at work. So, apparition it was.
Harry winced at the taste and wiped a hand over his mouth. He was startled by the ugly purple and green rash covering his hand and wrist. He pushed up his sleeve and saw that it spread nearly up to his elbow. Draco saw the way Harry's face fell, and it nearly broke his heart when he looked up at him with those sad, glassy green eyes. “I'm sorry...”
Draco held Harry up against his chest as Harry coughed and coughed. At some point, Harry had removed his tailored shirt, and Draco could feel so much heat radiating off him. He tried massing a hand over Harry's bare chest, his back, even his throat, but nothing was helping. Each desperate inhale fueled the fire raging inside of Harry's body.
“Welcome to my hell, Weasley,” Draco said, getting up to hand Harry their goblet of water, again. Draco overestimated his strength and swayed dangerously. Weasley shot out the hand that wasn't holding up Harry to pull at Draco's wrist before he tumbled sideways. Pansy pushed over to his side and wrapped an arm around his waist to help stabilize him.
Harry glared at Draco’s back as he left. ‘I’m fine!’ He thought angrily. ‘I haven’t said or done anything to make him believe I’m not feeling my best and he’s already being fussy.’ Harry pushed the pasta around his plate for another five minutes before deciding to just banish it. He poured the rest of his wine down the sink. Walking slowly to the living room, Harry attempted to yank the sleeves of his sweater down further. Why was he still so freezing? A couple of coughs overtook him, and he did his best to keep quiet so Draco wouldn’t hear from upstairs. “Maybe, Malfoy,” Harry mumbled angrily to himself, “if you were just a little bit less of a stuck up know it all, I would tell you when I’m not feeling great.” Harry sat down for a moment on the couch, deciding to read some of the latest World Quidditch Weekly before heading upstairs. He had fallen asleep before he knew it.
“Their fevers are probably a good thing,” One Healer said to another, “Or else we'd be dealing with hypothermia.”
“It may actually be burning,” Harry said, quickly. The distress was evident in his voice. “I think... Draco, you've caught Dragon Pox!” he said, noticing the beginnings of a green and purple rash spreading its way out from between Draco's fingers.
Harry sat down on the edge of Teddy’s bed, brushing some damp curls off the young boy’s forehead. His forehead and cheeks felt warm to the touch, but Harry wasn’t sure if he should give him a fever reducer just yet. He remembered Draco telling him once that low fevers can be helpful in killing a virus. So instead, Harry just removed the heavy comforter off Teddy’s sleeping form and pushed it to the end of the bed. Teddy stirred, coughing a few times. Harry smiled down at the sleeping boy and decided it would be best to stay with Teddy, so he wearily pulled his legs up to rest properly on the bed, leaned his head against the backboard, and shut his eyes. He forgot all about his tea that was cooling in the kitchen, as well as the immunity booster Draco brought home.
‘Bloody hell, that won’t do,’ Harry thought to himself. ‘If I look ill, Draco will probably confine me to our bed.’ He pulled his wand out of his pocket and whispered a few incantations that added glamours to his face. ‘There,’ he thought, ‘Much better. No need for Draco to start his coddling.’
“Do something, Healer Lawson.” The healer glanced up over Draco's shoulder. “Before he goes into a full-blown panic attack. Draco barely noticed their interaction.
Draco laughed at her, only now realizing how much energy he'd spent worrying over his partner. He was ready to sleep for a week.
“In fact, I propose we go out for a proper date when they let us out of here. Which is something I should have asked you for a long time ago.”
I am leaving for work early this morning, against my good sense. I plan to be there for 4 or 5 hours at most, so I should be back around lunchtime. As of this moment (7:30 a.m.), Teddy is running a fever of 101.2. Your fever is at 100.8, so you’re not fooling anyone.
Draco, Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together at their usual lunch seat in the ministry cafeteria. Except now Harry and Draco sat a little closer to one another then they used to.
Draco forcefully swatted Harry's hand. He looked at up with a pained expression before pushing himself up on one elbow and letting out a deafening and very un-Malfoy-like sneeze. Harry's eyes widened in surprise and he moved away just in time; as Draco sneezed, fiery sparks burst out of his nose. One landed on Draco's sleeve, and Harry rushed to pat down the spark before it could catch fire.
Harry turned and left, feeling the beginnings of tears prick at his eyes. He had just wanted a short break. He felt positively rotten.
Blaise’s booming voice cut into his thoughts from another side of the apothecary. “Oi, Draco, We have a customer over here who wants a flesh-eating slug repellent, and I can’t find any.”
Draco pulled the neck of his robe tighter and rubbed at the back of his neck. He truly wasn't feeling his best. He'd decided that he would finish his paperwork on their previous case and then ask Kingsley for the afternoon off so he could go home to rest. A good night's sleep ought to help his body fight whatever virus he's caught this time.
“Hey,” a voice spoke. The voice was low and raspy, but there was something overwhelmingly comforting about it. “Are you ever going to wake up, you lazy sod?”
Although Harry could hear Teddy calling him, it sounded as though he was a million miles away. Harry felt the hot weight of his baby lift off of his chest, and found that he could suddenly breathe again. He tried to take a deep breath in, but instead began coughing and choking up phlegm. When he had finally succeeded in forcing his eyes open, he squinted over at Teddy, who was busy soothing a crying, sick Scorpius. Harry’s stomach lurched dangerously.
Harry pulled himself out of bed with a groan. He could put on a fire, but it would be easier to just adjust the thermostat. Did his house have a thermostat?
Over the years, Draco had come to the conclusion that most of Harry’s quirkiness was just part of his charm. But the man got even weirder when he was sick, and not in a good way.
“Harry...?” Draco sat down on the bed and rubbed his hand up and down the length of his husband’s arm, to get him to stir, but Harry just moaned incoherently. Draco frowned, looking down at Harry. He could feel the heat radiating off of the man, even though his thick Weasley sweater. Draco used a diagnostic spell to check for a fever. 103.8. That was hot, too hot for an adult. Draco wracked his brain, trying to decide what he should do.
The next morning, Harry woke up to sun rays cascading themselves through the living room blinds. ‘I can’t believe I slept here,’ he thought to himself. Harry groggily pulled his wand out of his pants pocket and cast a tempus spell, which read 10:45.
“Here, drink some more water.” Draco picked his wand up from the covers of the bed and conjured Teddy a small glass of water. “Are you hungry? He mentioned with a smile.
“I am always sensible,” He huffed. “Thank you for all your help Mother, and thanks for calling. Now I need to get back to work so I can finish up and go home.”
Draco startled, looking up as a coughing fit suddenly raked through Harry’s body. Eyebrows raised, he waited until Harry was finished before speaking. “All right there, love?”
That day was one of the longest Draco could remember. He now had absolute certainty that Harry hadn't received the proper vaccinations. Even Draco's sluggish immune system was doing a much better job of fighting this virus than Harry's. The fever reducer worked for a bit, but then Draco had to resort to peeling the blue sweater off of Harry's fevered torso. He spelled a cool wet rag for Harry's head, and the man slept on. Draco could see close to double the pockmarks on Harry as he had on himself, and his skin had turned a dark, foreboding green shade. Draco tried his best to rest in between Harry's fevered tossing and turning, but both of their sneezing fits were becoming more frequent. Seven times he'd had to extinguish fires caused by Harry's sneezes, and only thrice for his own.
“The tavern? Yes! I am a regular customer there. Potter and I went together last Friday to celebrate our closing a major case.”
Draco gathered plates and silverware, and then poured two glasses of red wine, placing it all on the table. Harry carried over the pasta he’d made. He spooned himself out the smallest of portions, and then passed it to Draco, who filled his plate hungrily. “That’s all you are going to eat?” Draco questioned. Harry was always hungry, he’d never managed to grow out of that teenager phase.
He sounded horribly congested. Harry took a deep breath and reached out to pull Draco's hands away, feeling his forehead, and then his flushed cheeks. “You're feverish.”
Petunia so was busy nursing her little Dudlykins back to health, but the housework still needed to be maintained. Fast forward three days and little Harry was dragging his feet as he tried to accomplish the overwhelming amount of tasks he was told to do. Uncle Vernon had threatened that it better all be done before he got home from work or... well, Harry didn’t want to think of what would happen. But Harry was feeling ill himself.
“ Okay,” Teddy mumbled, sitting up. Draco could hear the congestion in his voice. Handing Teddy the glass, he watched as Teddy took three small sips before sinking back into the pillows.
Finally, after several long moments of silence, Teddy pulled himself away from the bin, breathing heavily.
Angrily, Draco wondered how he had been careless enough as to miss all the signs that his husband hadn’t been doing well before yesterday.
Harry sat up and held Scorpius closer to himself. He had no idea how long they’d been resting for, but it felt it had been hours. Where was Draco?
“So,” he started, in an attempt to change the conversation, “You look better. Healthier.” It was true. Harry's skin was beginning to fade back to it's usual, non-green color. The pockmarks were healing, and Draco doubted there would be much scarring. He hoped he looked the same.
Harry stopped walking and blinked for a moment. What had he gotten up to go do? His mind went blank as he was hit with a sudden wave of dizziness. Strong arms suddenly reached out to steady him.
“You go on without me. I need to catch up on all this,” he said, gesturing to the neat stack of paperwork in front of him.
Draco pried his eyes open. Beside him, Harry was sitting up in bed. Weasley and Granger sat beside him, and Granger's small hand was firmly clasped in Harry's.
Draco smiled tiredly up at him. “What do you mean?” He joked, “Doesn't everyone carry around a sponge with them?”
‘Good,’ he thought. ‘He needs it.’ Draco sat them both down on the rocking chair and conjured a bottle of warm milk, but after a few moments, he accepted that Scorpius wasn’t interested. Draco didn’t push as it seemed nausea was a major part of this flu. So he just sat there rocking his baby gently and humming to himself as he worried over the harsh coughing he could hear coming from Harry in the next room. It took only about 15 minutes for Scorpius’s eyes begin blinking drowsily up at him. Draco placed him down in his crib just as he was falling asleep, and covered him with a light blanket. He would need to come back to check his temperature soon, but first Draco needed to see to Harry.
Logically, Draco knew that the unusual behavior Harry displayed whenever he was feeling under the weather was attributed to those horrible muggles he’d grown up with. They’d treated him worse than a house elf, and they never cared for him the way a child should be cared for. Most of the time, Harry insisted that the past was in the past and that the Dursley’s behavior didn’t affect him anymore. But whenever Harry was sick, he would isolate himself and try and downplay what was going on. Which made Draco have to work extra hard just to figure out what was going on.
“No. Can't think of anywhere in Scotland like this.” Harry dropped the handkerchief and glanced over at Draco with a twinge of fear in his eyes. He was breathing just a bit too fast. Given his upbringing, Harry didn't do well in small, dark spaces.
As the Healers began to unhook Harry's machines to wheel him away, Draco felt himself panic. “You're taking him away?” He could hear his heartbeat increase rapidly in the beeps of his monitor. What if something happened to Harry, and Draco wasn't there for him? He promised to be there for him.
Draco reached out to grab him under the arms and pulled him up to sitting although his muscles ached with the effort. “Not yet. Take this.” He pushed and uncorked vial of fever reducer into Harry's hands, and watched as the brunette drank obediently. In the year since they'd become friends, Harry had helped Draco recover from illnesses dozens of times. This was the first time Draco had ever seen Harry sick, and he seemed to be much more pliable than Draco had anticipated.
“It's not your fault. No one got me vaccinated as a kid.” Harry's blinked at the sudden onslaught of tears. “No one cared...”
“-Hermione,” Ron’s voice sounded from another room in the Weasley home. “Do we have any more tissues?”
Harry stared at the blonde a moment longer. Curiously, in this lighting, his skin seemed to be taking on a greenish hue. Harry didn't think about it much and instead searched through Draco's bag to see what potions and supplies they had on hand. He was embarrassed by how his heart swelled when he saw just how prepared Draco was for such an unexpected situation like this. Once again, they would've been much worse off if not for his stubborn preparedness. They had snacks, empty goblets to Aguamenti water in, and a variety of emergency potions. They would be alright for now.
Draco wasn't exactly shocked by the selflessness Harry's fevered brain was resorting to, but he'd very rarely seen the man cry, and it worried him. “Quit it,” he said gently, wiping the tear away with his thumb, “This is just your fever talking. We're sick together now, so we're just going to have to take care of each other. Like we always do when we're out in the field, right?”
Shocked, Harry felt the boy’s head and neck again and found that it didn’t feel nearly as warm as the spell suggested. Harry wasn’t sure if that meant that his fever had also risen, or if there was something wrong with his spell.
Draco felt Teddy’s forehead, which was warm, but not terribly so. He pulled his wand out of its pocket in his robes and accio’d a pepperup potion from their bathroom medicine cabinet. It won’t cure him, but Draco thought it might ease his symptoms for a couple of hours. “Ted, I think this might make you feel better Can you drink this for Daddy?”
“I fell,” was all Harry could manage. Draco lifted him back on the bed and helped him pull up the waistband of his pants before Harry even had time to blink. The fall seemed to shake Harry back into reality and he leaned forward, placing his warm forehead against Draco’s chest. “Dray ... I don’t feel good.”
“Will do.” Harry whispered to himself, before pulling the door shut. He smiled down at Scorpius, who was clinging tightly to Harry’s shirt and sucking his thumb. Scorpius was just over a year old, and he was dangerously cute, even with the flu.
“Harry, can you put these on for me? He placed the clothes on the bed in front of Harry, and then took Teddy’s hand to guide him away so Harry could have some space to change. Suddenly, Harry was yanking Teddy closer to himself and out of Draco’s reach.
Draco put his soup under a stasis charm on his desk but threw a couple of extra protein bars in his bag for good measure. “I'll eat later. As you said, this will be quick.”
“Can't say they do, mate. Here, give me that.” Harry took the sponge and with a few waved of his wand, transfigured it into a large mattress that would cover most of the floor of their cell. “Up,” he instructed and Draco stood to help him lower the mattress onto the floor.  Harry then took off his outer robes.
“Yeah, Ted. I’m in with Papa.” Draco leaned down to press a kiss to Harry’s head. He was going to call a healer if he didn’t see any change soon. Behind him, he could hear Teddy’s little feet padding into the room. “Hey, Buddy. You okay?”
He’d really wanted to leave early, but with so many people coming in and out, Draco wasn’t sure if that was possible. He’d spent the morning making all the necessary potions he’d need, but without time to properly train Blaise, he couldn’t trust that the man knew what he was doing. He didn’t have any idea what to prescribe, and his shop had a reputation to uphold. Draco would have admit though if only to himself, that it was nice having a bit of help. Even if Blaise was fairly incompetent.
“Right, of course”, Harry managed. ‘Well, there goes that idea,’ he thought. “If I told Draco that I might be catching Teddy’s flu, Draco will stay home, and then other children in other families will suffer. “Go to work tomorrow, we’ll be fine”.
It was Draco. He was home and... oh no. Draco was home. Harry’s fevered mind began to panic. Draco would be able to tell that he was really sick, and he would worry. Harry had been trying so hard, and he didn’t want to be a burden. He didn’t want to go back to his cupboard.
“It’s okay, Harry”. Hermione interrupted, as Draco just stood there, shocked. “You change your clothes and I’m gonna go bring Teddy back to his room, ok? You change.” Harry allowed Hermione to scoop Teddy into her arm and carry him back to his room.
On the day Draco had moved in, he had looked around the grimy, ridiculously constructed house. Then, on one of those irrational impulses that still overtook him sometimes, after all this time, the kind of impulse that stems from human agency and self-indulgence, he’d walked to the staircase and fit himself in the tiny space beneath it. He banged his head on the stairs, but he quickly curled up, tucked against the corner of the underside of the bottom steps.
“‘G'bye, Potter, thank you for having me,” the slur of alcohol mixing strangely with his pureblood accent.
On their second night of drinks, Blaise lowers his eyes shamelessly and stares at Harry’s lips for a good ten seconds, then allows his gaze to wander back up. And smiles. Smugly.
“Don’t be stupid, I talk to lots of people. How else would the world inform me how worthless I am as a person?”
“Seems so. Must have been something extremely fast-acting in the cake. Now, if you’ll excuse me-” Harry raises his scythe.
He jumps an impressive distance upwards, and strings together a rather interesting set of words, which include
Harry looks at him patiently. Draco shifts his weight hesitantly, bites his lip, then throws himself at Harry. Tilts his head up, wraps his arms around Harry's shoulders. He kisses Harry briefly, ephemerally, like the tick of a second or the length of a lifetime or a galaxy exploding for thousands of years, and for a second, for a lifetime, for thousands of years, Harry feels anger and sadness and guilt and gratitude and sheer, overpowering, wonderful joy, joy for silvery eyes and silvery hair and the desire to grow.
“So, is it time to compare notes? Did you get any more of my people?” Draco asks, after drinking his entire glass in one go, and Harry wonders when this game turned from something born from irritation and spite into something almost friendly.
The next day, Friday, some awful man is kicking up a huge fuss near the self-checkout area. Sarah, the high school student, is futilely attempting to resolve the situation. Draco can’t understand any of the words coming out of the man’s mouth, except for the swears. The conversation sounds something like this, to Draco’s ears.
“They are both on the mend. They’ve been staying over at Ron and Hermione’s. Thank Merlin for the two of them.”
Draco needed to check his husband’s fever. The way he was acting had Draco pretty worried. He helped Harry lay flat on their bed, and then ushered Teddy back into his room. He could feel Scorpius’s head getting heavy on his shoulder. Draco watched as Teddy crawled back under his covers.
Harry rubbed a hand over his brow and then shifted Scorpius in his arms. The baby wasn’t very heavy, but in Harry’s aching arms he felt like he weighed a million pounds. “We’ll be alright. Draco will be on his way home soon. Thanks for trying to keep this little guy from catching this.”
At least this mission, Malfoy hasn’t yet tried any of that shit. But still, it doesn’t change the fact that working with him is a nightmare. He’s stubborn (refused to dismantle the golems even when Harry pointed out their eyes were glowing a kind of red that could only be described as evil), pedantic (argued for an hour, all while fending off two murderous automatons, about how he’d like to see
Draco plays his Death’s Shadow. It comes in at 7/7, and Harry has no cards in hand, and one creature in play.
it’s Malfoy, talking earnestly to someone inside. Harry re-holsters his wand. Wait, isn’t this the room with-
It takes him a moment to realize that he has Apparated to Harry’s cottage, not to his own house. Like the night shift Auror, Draco shrugs and goes with it. He knocks on the door, belatedly realizing it’s four thirty in the morning and dark outside.
Two days ago, Harry had taken the kids over to a playdate at George and Angelina’s. Halfway through the afternoon, their oldest child Fred announced that he wasn’t feeling well. That must have been when Teddy got exposed to the virus.
Harry, however, had not woken up, and Draco was worried. His fever was still dangerously high and Draco wanted to bring him to St. Mungo’s, but he needed to find someone to sit with the kids. He firecalled Molly, but she was busy helping Angelina nurse George and baby Fred back to health.
Draco was one of the most prepared people Harry knew, second only to Hermione maybe. In fact, that bag reminded Harry of the one Hermione carried during the year they spent searching for Horcruxes. On more than one occasion Harry wondered if she'd been the one to give it to him in the first place.
They were huddled together under Draco's blanket, sitting against the wall furthest from the window, but no matter where they were in the little cell, the walls and floor felt cold and damp against them. It was dark outside, but Draco spelled an orb of light onto the ceiling as a makeshift lamp with a spell Harry wasn't familiar with. They had been there for three hours, and each passing hour left Draco feeling marginally sicker. His head felt heavy, and he leaned sideways to rest it on Harry's shoulder. Of course, Harry let him. This was as close to cuddling as they'd ever done.
“Shh, it’s alright. We just gotta cool you down a little bit, and then you’ll feel better,” Draco sighed. “How did you get so sick so fast, huh? You seemed fine enough yesterday.” Harry was too headstrong for his own good. Draco knew enough about medicine to know that symptoms didn’t usually get this bad overnight and with a jolt, he realized that Harry could have been hiding the brunt of it for days.
Harry interrupted their conversation with a coughing fit, and Draco glanced over just in time to see him emit sparks in between his coughs, presumably from his lungs.
Draco shifted them both so that he was lounging next to Harry on the hospital bed. He reached for his husband’s hand, and Harry sniffed once and let his head fall onto Draco’s shoulder.
“God forbid I actually spend time with my husband. Whom, I’ll remind you, is ill. As is our son, which is what I need your help.”
Just over an hour later, Draco returned from the manor arms full of baskets containing crackers, fresh fruit, cough drops, throat soothing tea, ginger ale, boxes of tissues, and a plethora of various medicines, all of which his mother insisted he take home. It all made Draco realize that he had much more appreciation for her coddling when it was directed at one of his sons rather than himself. She had really covered everything, there’s not much else Teddy could want for.
Draco scooped him into their arms, and with a pop, the men were gone. Hermione breathed a sigh of relief. That was just about as bad as she’d ever seen Harry. They all needed him to be okay.
Draco could feel the warm sun rays beaming in through the window to his right, but as he sat at his desk at the Auror Office he admitted to himself that he was still quite chilled. It was getting hard to focus. He was on his third cup of Earl Grey tea that morning, but it was not doing much to ease the sluggishness headache he was suffering. As soon as he'd woken up that morning, he'd suspected he was coming down with something, but he'd been hoping it wouldn't affect his day too much. He'd just gotten over being ill three weeks ago.
Harry pulled open the heavy oak door to see Narcissa, dressed as elegantly as ever, without a single hair out of place. In her arms was Scorpius, who held his fat baby arms out in Harry’s direction.
It took two days before Harry came out from the haze of the flu. When he did, the first thing he noticed was the annoying beeping he heard, and the second thing was the smell. It was an uncomfortably clean hospital smell, which meant he was at Mungo’s. Harry remembered waking up here often when he was on the field as an Auror. But he hadn’t been admitted here in years, not since he’d left work to stay home with the boys. What happened?
“Mr. Malfoy, do you have any idea who you might have caught Dragon Pox from? Who you came in contact with before you began experiencing symptoms?”
“I know, Malfoy,” Harry sighed. “But look, I'm not the one who's sick right now. You are. If I get this and we are still locked in here, then we'll just have to deal with that then. But right now, please, just lay back down and let me help you, alright?”
Harry worked his eyes open to see Draco looming over him. There were bright streaks of mid-day light seeping around the edges of their makeshift window cover. Draco's skin looked even more green and pockmarks were peeking out from the neckline of his robes. His eyes were drawn down to Draco's lips, which were pulled downward in a tight, tense line. “What'sa matter?”
Finally, he watched as Hermione’s face appeared in the fire. Draco could see even through the flames that her normally wild hair was even frizzier at the moment.
“Alright team, what do you say we get these two blokes out of here, and deal with the rest of the case later?” Ron asked, and the team nodded in agreement. Hermione doled out portkeys, and within seconds, the dungeon cell was empty.
“Like hell he cares!” Harry barked, pausing to cough into his sleeve. “He’s probably the one that kidnapped us here in the first place. Where are we? We have to get back to Hogwarts!”
And Harry does, wipes the rain off his lips and laughs, as he watches emotions wheel and compound and shift in the always-slipping circles of grey eyes, overwhelmed by the wonder of fools.
Draco’s spirit stands up, spots Harry, and immediately starts talking, but his body remains prone on the floor.
Harry startles at the use of his first name, but then settles, realizing he has been thinking of Malfoy as Draco for some time now, anyways. Draco’s hair shines silvery, almost gold, in the warm light of Grimmauld’s fireplace. He looks perfectly refined, even when he’s sprawled out in Harry’s armchair, legs crossed at the ankles. Harry wonders what kind of ungodly things Draco did to get his hair to look like that, and sips his brandy.
“It’s nothing. If you really like sitting at the bottom of my well so much, feel free to keep doing it, I suppose.” As the light fades, so does the atmosphere.
And finally, Draco talks to Harry. Well, not really, more like stands around in Harry’s general vicinity, and focuses intently on incorporating large quantities of vodka into the punch.
Pansy’s eyebrows shoot up, and somehow she does not appear disappointed at the absence of Draco’s outraged tirade, which she had clearly been looking forward to. She merely detaches herself from Harry, smiles, and walks back to the Manor, casting a backwards glance at them.
“Here,” Potter says, and he puts his hands over Draco’s, guiding the wand. The tips of his fingers brush against Draco’s wrists, his right index almost touching the Dark Mark. “
Draco luxuriates in the darkness of the well, not responding, listening to the sounds of Harry's voice but not to the words.
“Uh, I-” He pauses for a suspiciously long time, then shakes his head free. “I’ve been trying to lift some of your restrictions.”
Draco finally looks up. “So, Blaise, Pansy and Luna on your side, and Ginny, Ron, Sirius and Hermione on mine. I’m one ahead.”
“Thank you, Luna. Pansy.” And then it’s as though someone has flipped a switch on Pansy. Suddenly, conversation with her is easy and interesting, helped along occasionally by Luna’s interjections. They argue back and forth over the Chudley Cannons’ prospects (“Please, Potter, you think they’ll win any games with
“Well, imagine. Once, you were part of a tree, a great big living thing, and now you are naught but a single plank, far away from even your building brethren.” Luna points to the wide gaps between the rafters of the bar.
Seducing the Savior of the Wizarding World. This is probably just the sort of nefarious deed that people like Tom’s parents were always suspecting him of. Draco smirks at the thought, and takes another step forward, the toes of his shoes almost lining up against Harry’s, the grass stalks bending gently under his weight.
He’s crying too, now. He pulls the vial of his misbrewed Angel’s Trumpet Draught out of his pocket. It is said that potions gone wrong have the opposite effect. He downs the whole thing in four swallows. There is work to be done. Work, work, work,
The first night they meet up, Blaise is taciturn. He just stares amusedly at Harry for an uncomfortable length of time, and doesn’t seem inclined to speak to him at all.
So Draco rigs up his harness and climbs down the walls of the well. “It’s only about four metres down,” he calls up to Potter’s face above him.
“No, I got that part, Potter. Do you not know I’m gay? Thought everyone picked that one up, at least.”
An owl swoops in through the still open window and drops a red envelope, edges already blackening, onto the kitchen countertop, then swoops back out.
“Compared to all the harm the Malfoy family has caused you over the course of the last decade, and even before you were born, I doubt it weighs much in the balance.” Complicated.  But Harry doesn’t mind the complicatedness at all, this time.
he thinks, one last time before sleep overtakes him too, still sitting up against the headboard. He dreams about fields of grass and stars, and the taste of forgiveness and freedom. And this time, Draco doesn’t leave, or hide, or run.
Back in the present, Draco looks at his drawn reflection in the prefect bathroom mirror. Drawn, drawn, drawn, his mind sings delightedly. Mirror, mirror, mirror.
And for a horrible second, he wonders if he walked all the way here just to hear that question from Harry’s mouth. But he quickly dismisses the idea, just as he had dismissed the idea that he would drown in his own tears. He stands up, and chucks the letter as hard as he can within the limited space of the well. It loops gently over the edge, and lands at Harry's feet.
“Would inviting you in be sufficient proof?” he asks, jerking his head towards his cottage. “We could cast a spell again.”
“As if it has anything to do with personal morality. It was a mere mistake. Clearly, Asimov’s rules are not sufficient.”
Harry has a life that has been more than long and varied enough, filled with all kinds of desperate wanting. Can Voldemort not kill me this year? Can I please survive this tournament? Will Ron ever notice me the way I want him to? What- ignore that last one.
The first casualty on Harry’s side is Ron. It happens one dark rainy Friday night, the usual time for Ron, Hermione and Harry’s weekly gathering at 12 Grimmauld Place. Harry had cheerfully walked down to the door, which was being hammered on incessantly, and opened it to find Ron, his arm slung around a shivering and drenched Malfoy, both of them grinning.
“You too, Narcissa,” he returns, as he is subtly but forcefully escorted away by Draco’s hand on his back. He tries his best not to lean back into the touch. They return to the party, which has reduced to a subdued hum. But when Draco re-enters, conversation picks back up.
He hears a pop - someone has Apparated right beside him. He whirls around and tries to dampen his instant flight-or-fight response, a simple thing, sharpened to a horrible sensitivity through years of curse dodging and Voldemort killing.
” and by the end of the syllable, he ends up practically snarling. Draco doesn’t think he’s seen Potter this angry since school. Evidently, they still rile each other up. As always. “So you just haven’t done any magic for, what, four years?”
Harry looks at the elegant, soft lines of Draco’s face, then down at his singular land. “I can cast this Opt card, right?”
“Well, I no longer have hair. Or robes, apparently,” Draco remarks dully, holding up a rapidly disintegrating sleeve. “So fortunately for you, you won’t need to endure distraction any longer, Saint Potter.” Draco blinks dazedly up at him. “I like you too, you fucking idiot.”
“Oh, Harry, would you care to come over for tea tomorrow? I believe Draco will be there, too. Draco Malfoy.”
The irritated customer pulls a large handkerchief out of his pocket and spits out a remarkably sized piece of chewed gum into it. Well, then.
He Apparates to the tall spiked gates of the Manor. The wards are down today, but it’s always politer to knock, isn’t it? It’s a windy day. Harry swallows slightly as he remembers the circumstances of his last visit - a screaming Hermione, a Stinging Hex, Draco lying to Death Eaters. But Malfoy Manor today looks nothing like it had. The once wilted gardens have been restored to full glory, overflowing flowerbeds filling the air with a clean scent, roses on trellises along with strange blooms that Harry has never seen before. The long winding gravel driveway is well maintained and neat. Everything looks immaculate. There’s the quiet noise of excited shouting a long way away.
is. So, feeling extremely bitter the next day, Harry tries. Malfoy’s tight with Luna Lovegood, isn’t he? Harry owls her, asking if she’d be interested in getting a drink. She replies within minutes, with a long winding letter that details her studies of magical creatures Harry has never heard of. But it ends with “A drink sounds wonderful, there are many Nargles at bars this time of year!” They meet at the Leaky Cauldron half an hour later.
He slides one of the windows open, steps through it awkwardly, and shuts it again. Narcissa looks up, and spots him. She stands up - but standing up isn’t the right term, not when there is so much elegance attached to the movement. She rises.
“See you, Harry.” He ducks out of the open, wide streets of Diagon Alley thankfully. He has a parole appointment at four.
Harry bites back his own admission of love. Standing here, waiting for his Death powers to help him win the stupid contest, listening to Draco’s painfully unfulfillable aspirations, this is ridiculous. He snaps his fingers, and a perfect three-by-three stack of Jenga pieces appears. Draco’s face falls. But then Harry takes a careless swipe at the tower, and the whole thing collapses. Best out of three.
And as if on cue, a second owl swoops in and drops a letter on Draco. He scans through it, while listening to Harry’s voice. It’s from Granger, thanking him for the apology but asking ‘haven’t you already apologized? You must have, because I forgave you a long time ago.’
Draco begins to feel more comfortable at work, returning greetings to the cheerful high school student who works the Tuesday night shift with him. Probably because he has finally had an actual interaction with someone who doesn’t a) hate him for what he’s done (everyone magical, basically) or b) hate him for what he hadn’t done (angry Muggle customers, complaining about bruised produce.) Strange that Potter straddles those two worlds, and yet is the first person to be willing to talk to him.
Harry looks at the two of them, bent over their meals shaking in solidarity, Ginny grabbing at her own ribs and Malfoy poking at her, telling her to “stop laughing, stop laughing, I can’t stop, oh god,” and feels an intense pang of jealousy.
He loves the house. He doesn’t change a thing about it, not the grime, nor the tiny windows, nor the tattered greyish curtains. He doesn’t even buy a bed, instead sleeping curled up in the space under the stairs, long limbs aching and cold when he wakes up.
But he hasn’t felt anything romantically like that for Ginny in ages. Why would he be jealous? Especially when it’s Malfoy, of all people. Harry decides that this is an unsafe line of questioning and brushes it away. He is going to
like someone who would do that?” And this anger, anger at Potter, is so familiar to Draco that it slips out between his lips without any real effort on his part. Abruptly, Draco realizes he is inches away from Potter, in a well that’s only a few feet wide in the first place. He scrambles back quickly.
Draco nods, and abruptly climbs back out, almost kicking Potter in the head a few times. Potter remains standing at the bottom, cleaning his glasses and looking amused.
He thinks about wandless magic. “I sort of just pretend my arm itself is the wand,” Potter had said.
At that, Malfoy regains his haughty composure. He waves his fingers dismissively at Harry. “Do what you want. You may have,” he sniffs self-righteously, “managed Luna, but you’ll never get either of
Malfoy shrugs, and holds his hand out for the dice. “I get a second turn,” says Harry. Draco snatches his hand away like he’s been burned. Harry rolls again. Six and five.
Death turned a piercing gaze towards Harry, which was impressive for an anthropomorphic personification with no eyes.
Harry Apparates to Andromeda’s cottage the next day, as he had promised her a week before. He hasn’t seen Teddy in far too long. He walks straight to the nursery, and is startled to see Andromeda leaning against the doorframe, instead of in the kitchen as she usually is. She turns to Harry, and smiles softly, but doesn’t move aside so that he can enter.
Despite the massive toll Euston Road took on him, Harry makes a speedy recovery, and Malfoy is soon approaching bankruptcy. He surveys the board with dismay.
“Three’s a good time to drop in. Thank you very much for listening to me. It was wonderful to see you again, Harry.” She smiles shyly at him, then glances upwards. “Goodbye, rafters.”
Anyways, it explains a lot. Kind of embarrassing that you had to tell me before I figured it out. You weren't right about the Cedric thing, though, thank God. I told Ron and Hermione a week ago, it was positively nerve wracking- wait, you don’t care about that. Sorry for ranting, but I’ve been losing sleep over this for two weeks and it’s your fault.”
He goes to Eeylops, rents an owl, and buys some extra parchment at a stationary shop. Then he returns home, and by the feeble light of the narrow kitchenette, writes an apology letter. It’s generic and stiff, and he intends on sending the same one to everyone. In the letter, he apologizes for this fact. But it’s as honest as he’ll ever be.
Draco frowned. “I know you're hurting. Think you can drink some water for me?” The brunette weakly shook his head.
“Harry! You alright?” Draco came busting in to see Harry sitting on the floor in his boxers, his pajama pants pulled up halfway.
“No, you ungrateful little brat!” Petunia snapped at him. “After all we’ve done for you, are you really too lazy to complete a few simple tasks?”
On the coffee table in front of the couch, there was a glass of water, a plate of orange slices, and a note. Harry grabbed the glass and took several gulps of water before reaching for the note. Draco’s neat scrawl read:
“The kids and I were over at George and Angelina’s, and then Freddy said he wasn’t feeling well, and... er, yeah. I guess I felt it the next day.”
“Daddy...” Once again Teddy’s tearful voice sounded far away. Harry could hear was his own teeth chattering, which sounded loud in his skull. It was so cold. Were the boys this cold? He should put a fire on.
“So go into work early tomorrow and restock all the potions you will need for a few days. Then Blaise can just sell things.”
Given all their history, it had taken Ron a while to admit that Malfoy was a surprisingly good Auror. When Harry had first gotten paired up with him early on in Auror training, Ron cornered the blonde and grilled him on having Harry's back out in the field. He didn't trust the bloke, but surprisingly Malfoy had never once let him down. Against all odds, it quickly became obvious to the entire office that Harry and Draco were well suited to one another as partners, and eventually, as friends. No one could talk sense into Harry quite like Malfoy could, and Harry needed someone to keep him in line. As much as Ron admired Harry for his Gryffindor bravery, he had to admit that Malfoy helped Harry analyze situations instead of jumping right in and getting hurt. He taught him to be critical, to slow down, and take precautions.
Tears still spilled from Teddy’s checks as he flopped back onto his pillow. It physically just Harry to see him this way.
“Twice. That only happened twice.” Harry rolled his eyes but stayed quiet, watching the blonde circle around the room in his usual dance to gather everything he wanted. He knew better than to fight Draco on this, the man would over-pack regardless. And if he was being honest, Draco's stupid bag helped them more times than he was willing to admit.
“Hello, Harry!” Hermione waved him over to their usual table. “No Malfoy?” She asked with eyebrows raised as Harry arrived at the cafeteria alone. Harry set his tray down across from her and Ron.
“Expecto Patronum!” Harry sent his stag out through the window, willing it to get to Ron or Hermione quickly. “Alright,” he said turning back to Draco who was still sat on the floor. “What do you have in your bag that we could transfigure to make this place more comfortable?”
Draco dropped his hand from his face and pushed himself back up on his elbows,  speaking slowly. “Yes? We were vaccinated. It was mandatory, written in our initial Hogwarts letter? Don't you remember?”
“Of course, love,” Draco said, stepping back from Harry. With a wink, he added, “I know what a worried mother goose you turn into when the boys are ill.”
“Easy, Harry. No fast movements.” Draco reached out to cup Harry’s cheek. “You’ve been in and out of it for 2 days. You had nearly a 104-degree fever, your body shut down to try and protect your brain from getting cooked. We... we’ve all been really worried.”
“It's okay now. We'll take care of him,” Pansy said in her most reassuring tone. She knelt beside Draco and took one of his hands in his. “How are you feeling?”
When he reached the kitchen, he realized that Draco had brought home a gift basket from Narcissa, along with a big pot of sick-day soup. He looking at the pot longingly. ‘It’s tempting,’ he thought, ‘but could be a dead giveaway that Harry wasn’t at his best. Better to cook something else, and save the soup for Teddy, who was actually sick.’
Draco’s brow furrowed in concern. “Okay. We are going to get you straightened out. Are you hungry at all? Nana sent us some sick-day soup for you.”
A few months back, St. Mungo’s released an article about how splinching injuries had significantly gone up over the past few years, which caused the ministry to place an Anti-Apparition Jinx on all major wizarding towns. They were trying to discourage the average witch or wizard from relying too heavily on apparition, since floo powder proved to be a much safer option.
“Well, I guess it’s gonna be my job to negotiate your freedom out of here then.” Draco smiled and leaned down to kiss Harry’s warm forehead. “After your fever is completely gone, that is.”
“Shh, shh, you're okay. I've got you. You're okay.” Draco chanted nonsensically. Though it was only minutes, it felt like hours until Harry stopped coughing.
After the dizzying blur of colors, the world righted itself again and the men took in their surroundings. To their surprise, they found themselves not in a secluded field in Scotland, but in what appeared to be a prison cell. The room was dark and damp, with a low ceiling. There was a barred window, revealing piles of snow and what looked like a blizzard outside. A chill slithered down Draco's spine. This wasn't right.
Just as he was about to sit back down, his wand began to buzz, which meant Kingsley had a field assignment for them. He frowned and went through his usual mental checklist to make sure he would be well enough to be out on the field. He wasn't dizzy or nauseous, and he didn't think he had a fever yet. Just a headache, chills, and mild fatigue. Nothing too bad. Some fresh, warm air would probably be good for him right now.
“But... but I can't take care of you like I'm supposed to if I'm sick.” A big tear-streaked it's way down Harry's cheek.
“Malfoy... what the fuck? Where am I? Let go of me!” Harry yelled, struggling. Draco felt a chill rush down his body. ‘Malfoy...?’ He thought, ‘We haven’t called each other by our surnames in years!”
Some wizard had sent in a tip about strange activity seen at an old abandoned manor which belonged to a Death  Eater in Azkaban. Harry and Draco had been assigned to go to the property in Scotland to check for anything unusual. The wizard reported that he had seen two men wearing dark cloaks carrying a large, heavy piece of furniture into the home. Given the nature of the previous homeowners, Kingsley was concerned about the possibility of it being a dark artifact. He gave Harry and Draco a portkey to get them there, and to Harry's amusement, it was a handkerchief. Seemed rather fitting for Draco at the moment.
