Harry sighed. “So he’s pulling his son out.”
"But enough about that,” Ron said, putting his arms around her waist and leaning down to give her a kiss. “How about some lunch then?”
He heard Draco snort. “You were expecting me to be awful?”
“I think he
I figured I could get it up and keep it up, even with a woman. I figured it wouldn’t be all that different, really. I
“Very good, Master Draco, sir,” the elf replied with a smile. “Pipsy will be doing that.”
(Vesper)
“I have plenty of wine here.” He held up his glass. “So you can stop hovering.” He said it somewhat good-naturedly, although Hermione could also tell that he meant it.
“No, I’m not quitting as Seeker,” Harry said. “I like Seeking. And now I can really focus on it, instead of trying to wrangle my ex-girlfriend all season.”
Both men jumped apart automatically at the sound of Kyle’s voice. The man appeared a moment later, smiling when he caught sight of them.
“So, what’s your team?” Teddy asked, getting Draco’s attention once again.
He welcomed his lunch break and was considering what he wanted when there was a gentle knock on his door.
“No?”
“Mm, you really are ready, aren’t you, love?” he asked.
“Yeah, but he gave me no sign that he was. He kept his distance, for one thing. And his eyes remained on my face the whole time. Not once did he check out my cleavage.”
Harry sighed in contentment. “Me too. We can’t wait that long again. I’ll go mad.”
“So they’re somewhere in the house. Have you checked behind the sofa in the sitting room? Or maybe under your bed. Those are the places you like to toss your shoes and forget about them, aren’t they?” He gave Teddy a knowing and amused look.
But now, he welcomed it.
He extracted a flat velvet box from inside his robes. “An early birthday present,” he said softly.
Ron pulled away a bit, leaning back against the headboard with a sigh. “I’m not talking about abandoning them or giving up hope. Obviously we’ll still go visit them all the time, we’ll pay careful attention to the treatment plan, we’ll… keep researching.” Hermione let out a little scoff at that. The research was already exhausted. He ignored her. “We’ll do everything we can, whatever it takes. But… but blaming yourself is not a part of that. It
,” he said softly. A white glow appeared under the surface of her skin, in the shape of the fig-sized fetus below. Then the light turned green, holding for a moment before slowly fading.
Harry found it didn’t care which one it was. It felt so good to be back in Draco’s arms and he simply lost himself, clutching Draco to him and breathing deeply. Everything about him, the feel of him, the smell of him, made Harry feel safe, and he chose to enjoy the feeling for as long as it lasted.
“And you too,” Harry said, with a roll of his eyes. “Don’t pout.”
And there was also a part of him that thought it might be quite fun to be the one on his knees.
“I Obliviated them. I Obliviated them so thoroughly that they thought they were completely different people. Do you know how much the mind has to be altered, what kind of modifications are required, to make that happen?”
Harry nodded. It was all starting to make sense now, where Teddy had gotten his notion to marry Toby. “Well, he is right about that. Best friends are always there for each other. But that doesn’t always mean that we should marry them. You know, Ron and Hermione are my two best friends, but I don’t want to marry them, do I?”
“And that’s what you want? To be with him forever?”
“I wish I could take your hand right now,” Harry said. “I wish I could kiss you. I hate that I can’t kiss you, sometimes.”
Harry took a deep breath, then nodded. “Yeah, all right.” He heard Draco murmur the same beside him.
And then the Sunday morning came when he regretted his wish.
He chuckled. “Do you want me to?”
“Good.” Draco released a relieved breath. “It would mean a lot to me. I can’t help but feel I’ve rather… bollocksed it all up.” He shook his head. “Our friendship I mean. And for that I’m very sorry.”
“Is yours a dragon as well? Or perhaps a lion,” Draco added, arching a brow.
Draco stared at the parchment in his hand, his brow furrowed.
Draco scoffed. “It’s not going to rot, Harry.”
“That was mostly luck.”
“And what of his mother then? Lily?” Draco asked, shuffling some papers around on his desk so he wouldn’t have to look at the older Slytherin. He was starting to get genuinely annoyed. “Was he not like her at all?”
. Fuck.” Kyle replaced Draco’s teasing hand with his own. “I want to get you off. I really, really want to. Trust me.”
But he wasn’t imagining them now. It was unmistakable, the sound of shuffling papers and rummaging stationery – Draco heard the heavy scrape of his father’s Baccarat ashtray across the oak desk.
Potter groaned, a heady sound that sent all the blood in my body rushing to my groin. I redoubled my efforts. We moved in tandem, matching each other’s rhythm as short, sharp breaths and gasps sounded in the room.
“I believe that,” Harry said. “But it’s also possible that you didn’t know who you were selling to. You said yourself that the buyer was anonymous, right?”
A loud keening cry rang out. It was the Reading Room alarm.
“I should take my pants off too, shouldn’t I?” Harry panted. His erection was stiff through the fabric of his trousers; Draco wondered how they hadn’t ripped already.
“This is starting to feel like an Auror interview, Potter. Draco, are you reenacting those silly books you read as a child again with Potter?”
“That’s … really an image. You’ll have to show me one day.”
“Off you go, then.” She tapped a key on the console. “I’ll let him know you’re here.”
Riddle was unperturbed. “I suppose compromise is in order for both of us. Very well; I will relinquish from making any more threats against Potter while you finish the task you had agreed to do.”
“Potter! Potter! Harry! Don’t you dare die on me, you bastard.”  I kept my wand level to his chest, struggling to maintain the spell. My eyes drooped.
“I won’t run,” Fletcher squealed. It was too dark to see Fletcher’s complexion, but Draco bet it would be as pale as snow now.
“Andromeda?” I couldn’t keep the surprise out of my voice.
Damnit! I was becoming aroused again. In the middle of the Ministry, no less. I hurriedly tried to think of his faults. Brash and rude, impulsive, with a death-seeker’s thirst for glory and a priest’s conviction of moral certainty, Potter and I were two different species.
“What I don’t understand is why it would be in Afghanistan of all places,” Dawlish said, recovering from his sullen silence. “If I remember correctly, the Trojan war was fought in Turkey.”
Draco wasn’t sure who these newcomers were. They could be police, firefighters, or Shacklebolt’s men. Draco hoped fervently it was the last. Shacklebolt was monitoring the situation from wherever he was, and an alarm in the middle of the night could be construed as a signal for reinforcements.
“I know who you are,” Ron interrupted. “We don’t have anything to do with the likes of you.”
There was a knock at the door.
Malfoy inclined his head gracefully.
“You should see the look on your face. Never thought coffee and sandwiches could get you off like that.”
The second surprise was when Harry agreed.
Draco dropped ungainly into a chair.
“Of course, mother.” I had no intention of following through. For once, I was in agreement with my father. The thought of having Potter and my Mother sitting across from me at tea was mortifying. “Potter’s my partner in this latest research project. That’s why we’re here, actually.” I hoped my mother received the unspoken message: ‘This is only temporary.’
The second-best option might be to go into hiding, at least until I had inconvertible proof that a secret group was after me. It had a certain appeal, but usually I wanted to hide from social obligations, not from thugs.
I stared at his back. I was filled with a sense of relief – and surprisingly, triumph.
She narrowed her eyes. “Well, if they have, you let me know. What are you doing here, anyways?”
Theodore Cross”
“We had a good run, didn’t we?” Harry said softly. He must be thinking along the same tracks. “You and I. We worked well together.”
And where the fuck was Harry? Draco desperately craved the reassurance of Harry’s arms, but Harry hadn’t followed him out. The idea of venturing inside to seek him out was too much for Draco.
Malfoy nodded. “You’re not going to like this.”
Potter accepted my logic reluctantly.
“Well, there’s one cave not too far,” she said, taking out a map and marking it for me. “But it’s rather dangerous to go, and I don’t see you bringing any heavy equipment. Our general store would carry them, but I think they’re out of stock at the moment. There are some nice trails nearby, though.”
As I sank into the water of the bath, I thought back about last night’s events.
“Of course not,” Draco said with injured dignity. He ceased trying to wipe it off.
“That’s only for the public,” Harry said. “I do have clearance to that building though. If you want to go see it, we could sometime.”
“Have you been here before?” I asked. I knew the history of Godric’s Hollow, of course, as the site of the Potters’ former home. I wasn’t sure if he knew that.
He blinked hard. Draco needed to stop these ridiculous fantasies. It would only bring him misery in the end. And, Draco had never been keen on the whole master and dominatrix business before. He must really be losing his head.
“We had to deactivate the defenses on the house,” she said, tucking a stray strand of hair back. She looked at Cross. “Hello, Mr. Cross. I admired some of your work. It’s a pity that I have to arrest you.”
It rather appealed to Draco.
“Yes.” Harry launched into a quick overview of the circumstances, of how the body had signs of an overdose, and how the data chips had been found near the deceased, likely to have been taken from work.
Where to begin? There was no archivist or librarian here to answer my questions or a catalogue of books. And there must be thousands of books here.
Only Shacklebolt …. Not even his deputy McLaggen, though Harry was secretly relieved that he wouldn’t need to beg McLaggen for any favors.
“No,” agreed Wormtail. “Can we go back to the car now? It is rather cold.” Draco sympathized with Wormtail, though his plaintive tone was immensely grating.
The other had a long, pale, twisted face. Burly, he nonetheless moved with much more grace than the driver and whipped out his own wand. He fired at Harry, who had leapt off the Firebolt.
“Well. Yes.” Potter seemed embarrassed by it. He shot me an ambushed look. I shrugged. Father’s brows knitted together in disapproval, but my mother thanked Potter graciously and gave it to a house-elf to pour.
Fletcher gave Draco a malevolent stare. “I knew you were an informant.”
Theo had taken out a gun similar to the one Dolohov had. Draco didn’t even bother questioning where Theo had gotten that from. The Decoder was safe in his hands. It was all that mattered.
Harry chuckled. “No. That would be even more stupid. You know she’s an expert in unarmed combat, right? I’ve seen her take out a man twice her size without blinking.”
Harry glowered. First Finnegan and now this computer. He was tempted to unplug it.
He hoped Harry was able to keep up. No doubt they had a lock on his cell phone and were able to track him and Fletcher, but Draco didn’t relish the idea of being so exposed. It would be easy for someone to sneak up behind them with a knife in the back.
“So what do you want me to do with these names?” Potter stared down at the sheet with alarm. It was at least a foot long, crammed with miniscule script.
“That makes sense, I suppose,” Harry said. “But how do we find it? Godric’s Hollow and its surroundings isn’t easy to search for a small book.”
“I’ve shut myself in for longer periods of time,” I said, a little taken aback and annoyed at Granger’s usual insight. Then: “It is a bit tiring being the house all day,” I admitted. “I found a bunch of artifacts in the house that I would like to take a closer look at, but I need cross-referencing materials, and this house lacks a proper library.”
I looked up, startled at how direct he was. “What are you on about?”
I nodded. I just — knew — that it would be safe.
“What else did you find in the cave?” Draco asked, ignoring Harry’s question. “Did you get the Shield?”
I laughed. “Love letters from housewives mooning over you? I want to read them.”
Malfoy gave a little smile. “I believe that, Commander, is your job to find out.”
“This door isn’t like the one at Grimmauld Place,” Harry said. “It’s not reinforced steel because – well – Ron and Hermione aren’t paranoid ex-spies. The door is strong, but this isn’t a bank vault.”
I rubbed my head. So many questions. I needed something stronger than coffee.
Harry entered with a cup of tea and a wrapped sandwich. “I got hungry and already ate,” he said, handing them to me.
Harry, on the other hand, had not been so grateful. Hence the current scene.
The coffee was ready. I pushed a cup towards him as I held my own in my hands. It warmed my numb fingers, the steam curling as I inhaled.
I smiled to myself. I would have considered this night a success had no fisticuffs occurred; this was beyond my expectations.
I touched my chest, felt the scar the Sectumsempra had left, remembering the immense hate and anger as I raised my wand –
“Such vulgarity, Mr. Potter,” Cross reproved languidly. “There’s no need to be so rude. A simple no would suffice. But Draco here will miss you, won’ you?”
“Oh, he never liked his greens,” my mother confided in a carrying whisper. “He always fed it to the hounds when he was young.”
Harry turned to Draco, responding to Draco’s stare.
My hand came around the small of his back, pulling him in deeper. Potter came to straddle my hips, his weight hot and heavy. I didn’t mind how small the chair was; I relished our closeness.
Ron’s face didn’t soften but Hermione’s did.
I was reminded by this of how decent Potter and his friends truly were. “No, there weren’t enough Aurors to take my report, and when I found my flat wrecked, I came here straightaway.”
“Thought you were overdue for a vacation. And with Harry too,” Blaise had said, winking naughtily at Draco. “I always knew you had a crush on him back in school. It’s good to see that you’re together again.”
“I don’t think this is a good idea,” Dolohov warned.
“It’s alright,” Harry said. He wondered what Finnegan thought about Harry’s strange refusal to allow his bio-enhancements to do its job and boost Harry’s performance. It had been remarked by some of his past partners and superiors when he had been a junior officer. Harry had been exemplary otherwise and it had never grown to be an issue.
“Why are you up so early?” he mumbled. “Go back to sleep.”
I forbore from pointing out that it was money from the trust Grandfather Abraxas set up for me, and mine to do as I wished once I had reached my majority. I was twenty-eight. Besides, the flat was less than a few minutes’ walk from the family townhouse. It was easy to visit, and the reverse, though I chose the building precisely for its mixed residents to deter my family from dropping by unexpectedly.
Of course, Hedwig replied. It’s saved and stored for when you need to come again.
“Not tonight,” Granger said. She gave both Harry and Shacklebolt a disapproving look. “I don’t know what this is about, and I admit I don’t really want to, but I think the best course of action for Draco is to get some sleep right now.”
It warred with the unpleasant bile that rose whenever I set my eyes on the tatter remnants of my flat. Damn pride and fear – I couldn’t handle this alone. A piece of what had been my kettle rolled towards my feet.
The finger movements stopped. “Malfoy?”
I ran into my bedroom. A similar scene of devastation awaited me. My bedsheets were in shreds. I winced. Those had been expensive. The pillows were torn, some feathers still lightly aloft, and the mattress had a large slash down the center. Clothes were strewn on the floor with abandon, and the wardrobe door hung slightly off the hinges.
“Well, Draco, are we ready to talk now?” he asked, as we settled into the armchairs. I gripped the handle of my cup so tightly that I thought it might shatter. It was the only thing that anchored me in my tumultuous state.
It was probably the plumbing, which had not been overhauled since the Edwardian times, Draco told himself fiercely.  Another item that needed attention in the ever-growing list of details that required maintenance. It was why so many of his family’s friends and acquaintances had decamped for smaller and more modern residences.
“But – what happened?”
Trying to relax, Draco spoke in an easy tone: “Does that mean you’ll waive your fee? As a gesture of goodwill?”
“It wasn’t completely my fault,” Harry said defensively. “Wait – a Cruciatus?”
It was a mechanical model of a great Eagle Owl, large and heavy, with fierce orange eyes and tufted ears. It beeped in response and waved its wings.
“Is this it? It looks like a cave entrance.”
“Medication?”
“I want to talk to Harry,” Draco said. Five pairs of eyes stared at him uncomprehendingly. “Alone.”
“We can’t.” Potter’s voice was tight as we sped — away from the Manor. “It’s not safe for us. That man’s still there. And your parents have the elves to help them. They’re not who the man’s after.”
He tried to focus. He dimly remember the map that had been on display at the briefing this morning. It wasn’t difficult for the details to return to him; Draco had been staring at it the entire time, only half listening to Harry and Shacklebolt and Dawlish talking.
Damn. That took balls,” Finnegan said.
And Draco wasn’t in a particularly good mood.
“Your behavior is atrocious.” Malfoy sighed. “But I suppose I can’t blame you. Plenty of people fall for this type of boorish behavior, it seems.” He appraised Harry with a curious look. “You seemed receptive to Blaise’s advances back at the Leaky.”
“A very happy Christmas to you, my dear,” the woman replied.
sitting on her desk, left open on a page that happened to feature photos of Harry and Draco out together with friends on the first Hogsmeade weekend of the term. Harry remembered that day clearly. The reporters had been unavoidable.
Eamon, who had a great deal of money thanks to a recent inheritance, considered simply paying the ransom, but ended up contacting the Aurors instead. It was the right call, but unfortunately their investigation hadn’t turned up anything of significance, at least according to the case notes so far. Of course, this case was actually an old one, and had already been solved. But they were only receiving case notes for part way through, to see if they could figure out the rest on their own.
“Good.”
But today was not that day, and he would just have to live with that.
“That’s not why.”
Harry wanted to be with him. He might even… he might even be…
He needed a distraction. But what? Homework? That only made his stomachache worse, thinking about all he had to get done.
Draco snickered, enjoying Harry’s (mostly exaggerated) annoyance. “Come on, let’s go to lunch. I’m starving.”
“Great,” Vesper said, realizing she sounded a little breathy. “I’ll give you my address and you can come over around… what do you think? 5:30? And we can go together.”
Malfoy was now a regular feature in Harry’s wanking fantasies, which were currently his only outlet for release now that he and Ginny had broken up. He had never been with a man before, and he wasn’t entirely sure exactly what he wanted to
cared about. “I don’t know what to say.”
He wasn’t going to take his time this morning. He was going to take what he wanted.
her? She’s exquisite.”
… what was he supposed to make of that?
Now she was looking at him, so at least his admonishment could land.
“Hey, you never know. He could be the love of your life.”
“I am,” he replied, just as quietly, and Harry smiled to himself. “Come into the yard with us and sit down,” Draco said more loudly. “It’s lovely out.”
Looking down, he could see both of their hard cocks pressed together, Harry’s just a little darker, but both of them angry and red, leaking copious amounts of precum that intermingled as the tips rubbed against each other. Their hands overlapped naturally as they both gripped around them, moving together, and it was glorious, pure pleasure.
Draco found himself staring again. Every time he thought he had Potter’s game figured out, the man surprised him. First, at the staff introduction, he was overly charming, as if trying to win Draco over, or perhaps outdo him. Then, when term started, he behaved like Draco was just any other colleague. And now he was here, spilling his guts about how Draco’s presence brought up trauma from his past.
Vesper, though disappointed they hadn’t guessed exactly right, was gratified to know they had gotten close. It made her feel better about her own investigative skills and the prospect of using them once she was on the job.
Harry closed and locked the door behind him and even put up a silencing charm, and Draco watched him do it in confusion. It had been weeks since they’d done anything in a classroom, including even discussing their secret arrangement. But Harry obviously wanted to discuss it now.
,” Draco said, grinning. “I suppose it’s that I’m just not brilliant enough for you to be properly intimidated.”
Draco narrowed his eyes at the brunet. “Hmmm.”
, he supposed – had returned to the stove to finish the meal. Draco told her about his summer and a research project he was thinking of starting back up, happily accepting a glass when the brunette handed it to him.
“You’re saying he was lazy.” For all her talk about how Draco shouldn’t say hateful things about his father, she sure was saying plenty about Lucius herself.
“The elf is going to help me and Draco out around the house. She’ll cook us dinner sometimes and she’ll clean and do the wash. But,” he poked Teddy in the stomach so Teddy would look at him. The boy did, giggling again. “This is important, Teddy. We treat the elf with respect. We say ‘thank you’ when she does things for us and we are kind to her. We don’t boss her around. If we need something from her, we ask nicely. She’ll be just like any friend or family member, like another member of the household. And we treat everyone with kindness and respect, don’t we?”
“Oi, when you two are finished eye-fucking each other,” Ron called to them across the table, making the other 8
“Yes, it is.”
“Fair point,” she conceded to Vesper, who laughed again.
“You don’t need to, Professor,” Harry said quickly. “Honestly.”
To Draco’s dismay (and pleasure), Harry returned to his task, getting his hands much more involved now. One ventured down his arse to tease his sac while the other rubbed expertly at his erection. It was enough to keep Draco hard and wanting but not nearly enough to satisfy. The barrier of fabric dulled the sensations, and Draco was craving the sense of completeness that only skin-on-skin contact could achieve.
The table was pervaded by silence, and Draco took a moment to savor it. He didn’t know why he was enjoying himself so much all of a sudden, but he rather was. Perhaps it was that every time his father said something awful he knew he could think of the Bully’s Demise and entertain himself instead of getting insulted. Or perhaps it was the thought of the Gryffindor he had waiting eagerly for him back at Grimmauld Place. Or maybe it was the fact that his parents really didn’t have any say in his life anymore. Draco was already lord of the Malfoy estate; it had passed to him when he married Astoria. They couldn’t disinherit him, and they couldn’t force him to get remarried to someone of their choosing. They couldn’t tell him where to go and what to do.
“You don’t think there will be other political issues in the future that you will feel strongly about?”
“Kiss my neck, on my pulse point.”
Ron groaned. “I’ve just remembered we have double Potions this afternoon. I don’t want to go!”
“It was a kiss, Harry. It’s not like they shagged.”
“Harry,” Draco’s voice was gentle. “Look at me.” Harry tore his eyes from the scar, trying to swallow his shame. The gray eyes he met as he looked up were full of determination. “I did much worse than you ever did to me.” Harry swallowed and started to shake his head, but Draco held him still, his hand coming to rest on Harry’s forehead. “The past is the past, remember?”
“Well, doesn’t everybody?” Draco smirked at Harry, and Harry rolled his eyes. “He looks quite good blond.”
Harry kissed his godson on the head once more. “Ok, Teddy. Whatever makes you happy.”
“Not the way Blaise tells it,” Hermione replied, amused.
“Hi,” Harry said.
“Check,” Ron said, and Harry turned back to the game.
“Exactly,” Hermione replied. Instead of heading to her side of the dormitories, though, she curled up in the armchair across from him. “What are you writing?”
“Would you like a slice? I have plenty.”
For the most part, Aurors dealt with much smaller offenses: illegal tampering with magical goods, the smuggling of dark artifacts or other contraband, and performance of experimental magic without a license. Aurors still got into scuffles and duels with these criminals on occasion, but it appeared as though Vesper’s dueling skills weren’t going to be put to use as often as she expected. The job was going to be as mental as it was physical.
Draco half expected her to follow this speech with something like “No one understands him like I do” or “We were made for each other and no one can keep us apart” or something equally teenager-esque. But she didn’t, thank Merlin. She only stood there, waiting for Draco’s response.
what Kingsley was suggesting. “I don’t think that’s a good idea. I’m not exactly built for politics. I’m too honest, and I’m not very diplomatic, and I don’t care much about pleasing people or making them like me.”
“I had accepted it, for the most part.”
“What happened between them?” Draco found himself asking, out of mere curiosity.
Draco took another minute to look around and finally found his way to the Italian aisle, overcome again by the selection. He stopped at the Chianti section, eyes peeled for that familiar label. It wasn’t jumping out at him.
“So long as you don’t mind being in the company of a nursing mum,” Hermione said. “I wouldn’t want to make you uncomfortable.”
“Because…” Harry had no idea how to explain it. “Because my childhood had nothing to do with me defeating Voldemort, positively
“Ugh, that
“Where are we going?” Harry asked him as he accepted.
you break the rules, I just made sure you got caught.” Harry tossed Draco a wink.
Ron swallowed and wouldn’t meet Harry’s eyes. “You’ve ruined this. It was going to be the four of us.” He gestured between himself and Hermione. “It was going to be perfect, and you’ve completely ruined it.”
Draco smirked. “I suppose we wouldn’t. All I know is, I didn’t snog anyone but you. I remember because there was that one bloke who groped and tried to kiss me and I shoved him off because I knew he wasn’t you.”
“Apparently no one has done the reading,” he said drily. “Or perhaps you thought skimming it and simply noting that it was about basic Healing potions would be enough to let you slide through the period? Well, ten points from Hufflepuff and Slytherin both, then.”
. I can’t even begin to tell you, Uncle…” He trailed off, in serious danger of getting misty-eyed. He swallowed. “You didn’t see me much before the summer. You didn’t see me upon my arrival at Hogwarts. But I was… a different man. So unsure of myself, so lost…”
you’re not my dad. You’re my cousin. Everybody knows that.”
It had been silent since around 8:30 that evening, when Harry had written him:
“Hey,” he greeted them, hoping he didn’t still look like he’d been crying.
a book, in fact, though the black leather cover held no words, only an embossed silver infinity symbol directly in the center. Hermione’s brow furrowed as she stared at it in recognition. It looked exactly like the symbol on the front of Ron’s InfiniVault. She opened it, only to find that all of the pages were blank.
“Yeah, it’s a little excessive, I know,” she said with a lopsided smile. “But he and I are really close and he doesn’t have any kids of his own, so he basically sees me as his daughter.”
“Good,” Kyle said, his eyes flitting to Draco’s lips a moment. “Because I prefer to bottom.”
“Is it ready?” she asked finally, staring into the cauldron. “Is that enough?”
“He knows this already!” Kemp called.
“I think so too. We’ll have plenty of help.”
“Lesson one,” he said, his voice still mostly breath. “Coming with your clothes still on.”
And the third mistake… well… that was staring Harry right in the face as he looked up from the paper and met a pair of disbelieving blue eyes.
But it was also easier, because it was the right thing. And that gave Draco courage.
“It’s a ‘for the best’ thing,” Vesper said with half a smirk. “We ended it.
Draco cocked an eyebrow, staring at him. “What?”
The conversation moved on, but Harry couldn’t help feeling that he might have planted a seed, one that could grow into something interesting.
It was sort of sweet, though, the way Harry would stand aside when Kreacher had it in mind to open the oven and prod the potatoes on occasion, as if to prove he was somehow contributing, if only in an honorary way.
With a look of mild concentration, Draco waved his wand over Harry’s head. Harry could feel the tingling breeze of a grooming charm work it’s way over his scalp, and he remained still, watching Draco with satisfaction as the blond’s expression turned bemused.
. He had forgotten his little lie of omission from a few months ago. Francesca believed him gay. It hadn’t come up again, until now, so he had forgotten it.
Max’s face fell, and Kyle immediately felt a stab of guilt and remorse. He knew this wasn’t really Max’s fault, and he didn’t want to hurt the guy. But they were very different, and not in ways that were going to be compatible. There was no future here, and Kyle was at the point where he really wanted to find something that could have a future.
“Gawain,” she replied in the same tone. “Thank you for coming.”
he thought. Or perhaps worse. Perhaps he was coming to give Draco a pep talk about putting himself out there and trying again. He didn’t think he could stand to hear something like that right now.
“Yeah. And psychologically. They locked me in rooms, they starved me, they told me my parents were worthless low-lifes who never amounted to anything, and I was going to be the same as them. Sometimes…” Harry’s hand tightened on his own bicep, the nails digging in, and he could feel himself closing up, closing off. But he made himself speak anyway, just like that day, in bed with Draco, when he’d told the whole truth. “Sometimes my uncle beat me. Both of you have seen me shirtless. You’ll have seen the scars.”
he realized, and the thought perked him up a bit. He was looking forward to that even more than he was looking forward to Christmas morning, and giving Teddy all the gifts he had gotten him.
Harry nodded absently. “Sure.”
And yet, there was plenty in his affection for Emilia that
She smiled, enjoying the praise. This was one of the wonderful things about being with Ron. He had no judgments about what she should like or what should get her going. It hadn’t bothered him that she had watched porn before and liked it, even the fact that some of that porn had been only of men, fucking each other. It hadn’t bothered him that she liked to play around with his arse a little when she was going down on him, though she knew he had been cautious at first. But he had been open to exploring, and had even learned to enjoy it. No, they weren’t the
“Traditionally, the best man guards the door and waits for the couple to decide when they’re ready to make their appearance,” Draco explained, though rather unnecessarily. They’d had this conversation already. Many times.
“So back to the old grind,” Kyle said.
“I don’t get to do it very much, you know. You always wake up before me.”
At Draco’s face, Riddle laughed. “Don’t look so anguished at yourself. It isn’t typical that one has secondary security systems installed in a high-end office building like this one. After all, I myself was conflicted about it. We pay such a premium to be in this space and look at their poor security!” Riddle made a moue of mock disappointment that Draco wanted to slap.
Harry thought it had been a ploy by Finnegan to save him from McLaggen. Harry had spotted McLaggen’s burly frame coming down the hallway to his door when Finnegan burst in and told Harry he had to leave. With a hastily given shrug, Harry had allowed himself to be rushed to the car park.
Which would be nothing.
The meeting happened in this exact room, actually. There were two of them. They looked at us and asked the Dark Lord if he wanted power.”
Yes, Hedwig replied. We have prevented a massive influx of Elixir. By my estimation, it should result in a 0.3% decrease in violent crimes in the City and a 0.013% decrease in Underground.
All that paled in comparison to the man at the focus of the room.
“Don’t be. It was a long time ago.” Potter tore his faraway gaze back to me with an effort. “I’m sorry about how your father was at dinner, by the way.”
“Don’t touch him, Greyback,” Dolohov said, walking in. “We need him in one piece and you know what a mess you leave after you play with your toys.”
“That’s normal, isn’t it? I mean, for a meeting between two dangerous groups, it’s not uncommon for them to bring reinforcements, right?”
Dolohov gave an ironic little bow. “After you.” It didn’t escape Draco’s attention that Dolohov tightened his grip on the gun.
“Draco is joining me,” Cross said, his eyes on the Grimoire, a hungry light gleaming in his eyes. His wand was out, pointing directly at Harry’s chest. “You’re also welcome to do so too, Mr. Potter, though I very much doubt that you want to.”
“I don’t know,” Harry said. “We need to return to the base and regroup. It’s possible that this was a trap from the beginning, or that they somehow found out we knew about the sale. Either way, it’s not good.”
The pieces fit, like two parts of a puzzle. It was still awkward: the ground was hard and cold, and Draco’s hair had him almost slipping off.
“We were right about you, Mr. Malfoy,” Shacklebolt said with a slight smile. “We’ll provide you with financial renumeration, of course, and you’ll be given access to our resources for travel and other field equipment you might need. You’ll also be assigned a partner when you land.”
We were outside a nondescript farmhouse in the middle of nowhere. Or rather, the outskirts of London. A haze of magical protection surrounded the structure that made me wince even standing near it. I could not imagine what Granger and her team were experiencing.
Draco considered the offer. The car was parked illegally in front of the recently constructed flats which would be soon joined by their brethren here.
“Draco!” Luna Lovegood’s ethereal voice greeted me. Even in the middle of the day, she still managed to sound as though she came from a dream. “Long time no see.”
He had called about the latest article in Enchantress Express, breathlessly reporting our latest escapades. This time, an intrepid photojournalist had somehow managed to slip in, and pictures of harried Harry and a sated me winking at the camera proliferated like the plague. It had done wonders for my career, the new publicity — I received more inquiries through my agent from publishers than ever. I guess sex sells, even for history books.
“Follow the money. That’s a good idea. You know, you have a talent for this.”
“No, Goyle,” Harry said. He didn’t trust Goyle to run off at the first opportunity. “After you. And remember, you’re being paid not only to be the guide, but also for your silence.”
I waved off her concern with a confidence I wasn’t sure I felt. “I’ll be fine. I can take care of myself. I’ve been practicing my dueling.”
“I wouldn’t recommend that. Fighting on a military base is strictly prohibited, and we’re pressed for time as it is. Now, the more cooperative you are, the faster we can get this over with, and you can go back to England.”
“That’s true, and that’s what I told my pa,” she said, replacing our tea with a fresh kettle. “But he wouldn’t listen. He’s a bit daft about this sometimes, you know? But family’s family, and I guess that’s just something I have to live with. More eggs?”
On the day we were set to visit the Manor, I dressed with care. I sent two letters to my parents, one to my father and one to mother. I neglected to mention Potter was accompanying me in the copy my father received, my reasoning being that my father would be more receptive to the news from Mother.
“You talk as if these people are real.”
“Oh.” Draco didn’t know how to respond to that. “You’re welcome.” He felt this was one of those moments he needed to be more expressive than that, but his foggy mind failed him.
“Then you know what happened?”
How Draco wished he had been with them.
“It is.”
“It’s assumed that this is the place to gather information,” Harry said, “seeing how this is the most popular gathering spot in the Underground. Don’t you think, Malfoy?”
“Anyone injured?”
“I’m a little shaken but I’m fine.” What I had experienced was so vivid….
He was about to leave his hiding place in search for Harry, consequences be damned, when Harry popped back next to him. It was lucky that Draco was too busy blowing hot air into his hands at the moment, or else he might have scream. As such, he let out a squeal that would have been worthy of a mouse.
“I’m not going to help you,” Draco said, trying to summon up courage and meet Riddle’s eyes. “I don’t understand why you even bother asking. I’m not my father.”
“Except the credit,” Theo repeated. “This is a big find?”
They had arrived in a respectable, if not exactly prestigious, neighborhood. Apartment buildings reached into the skies like metal fingers; here and there were a few trees that broke up the gray landscape of concrete and steel with some greenery. It was the sort of place a rising professional – single, perhaps recently attached with a partner – would live. Comfortable but not lavish.
Dolohov smiled. “You feel it too, don’t you?” he said softly. “The power that’s in it. It’s tempting, isn’t it?”
“It’s no use bemoaning the past,” the voice said, with a touch of sharpness for the first time. The librarian bowed his head. “Go and give the Malfoy boy the key. If he is unwilling, there are ways to make him cooperate by force.”
“There’s no need,” Malfoy cut off. He faced Harry. “You have no reason to trust me, and I don’t particularly like you. Though I do have to say, you fascinate me with your bloody idiocy and sheer dumb luck.”
Draco didn’t intend to let anything happen to Theo, aggravating as he was at times. “The ocean is unpredictable,” Draco told Bellatrix. “And these waters aren’t exactly undisturbed. The Decoder can get stuck to the bottom of a haul, or caught in a fishing net too. And you can’t carry out that massive diving action without catching notice. Do you really think the Greek coast guard or the media won’t find out? You can bribe a few of them, but not the entire fleet.”
Done. Hedwig’s voice came through smug.
“Then it’s settled!” Fudge exclaimed. “Our savior — Harry Potter! Our thanks are in order. I’ll arrange with matters with Shacklebolt later to make it official.”
A knock at the door.  A sandy haired young private poked his head in.
“It was my idea,” Draco said. “I was the one that decided breaking into one of the most prestigious building was a good idea.”
The two men doubled back, the taller man holding his nose in a hand full of blood, the shorter one with his arms around his stomach. There was a new wariness in the taller man’s eyes now.
Potter chuckled. “Then you came to the right person. I should put that on the marketing materials.” He looked out the window. It was a beautiful day and regret that I was unable to spend it outside touched me. “I couldn’t stand the inertia of office life,” Potter admitted.
Harry understood the logic behind this, not least of which was the possible ensuing turf war if the Aurors insisted on their sole control of Underground egress, but the arrangement still struck him as grossly unfair.
“You can show me you care in other ways.” I grabbed his shoulders and pulled him down on top of me. He was hard too, his erection jutting against my hip even through the folds of his robes. He groaned, a throaty rumble. The sound touched my groin. I pulled him in, feeling the hard, lean muscles against me.
“Yes, sir.” Harry didn’t look worried. “I’ll be relocating Draco back to Grimmauld Place first thing in the morning. I might be late coming in the office.”
There were several on the base: one for the light armored vehicles used for the more dangerous missions, and several for the supply convoys bringing in the necessities. Draco ended up standing amidst a sea of Humvees and Land Rovers.
Potter shook his head. “No. It’s too dangerous for Malfoy to come. I assume it’s going to be a raid and that you haven’t secured the location?”
He found himself tuning Fudge out in favor of studying Malfoy. Beyond the clothes and the physical form, there was a hardness in Malfoy’s eyes, one that reflected what must be his inner thoughts behind the polite smile. It was a flintiness, like the blade of a knife, which threw off flashes of disdained enjoyment as Malfoy observed Fudge attempting to make political capital out of the event.
“I suppose it’s in our best interest to cooperate with them for now,” Riddle said. “Anything of value in those?”
Draco had a ridiculous urge to place his hand in Harry’s as they trudged along the path.
“Where, then?” Draco was still shaky. He tried to think.  Hard. It was difficult to cut through his overloaded senses to find a semblance of space where he might be able to use his mind. “We can go back to the HQ.”
I hissed in anger. And fear. Whoever had done this managed to break the wards I had set. The spells I casted were sturdy enough to cause trouble for anyone but a powerful wizard. In theory. I never had anyone test their durability before.
“Huh?” Draco tapped it gently with his finger. “How can you tell? By just looking, I mean.”
“Are you sure?” Draco wasn’t certain himself. It was no shame to admit he enjoyed the finer aspects of life, and he wasn’t certain that Grimmauld Place had that. Though, Draco enjoyed life itself even more.
“Oh.” There was a beat of a pause. “I haven’t either.”
“I do know about your background, Mr. Malfoy, and I’m wondering why you’re choosing to have dinner with me instead of bidding on several different lots I can think of which would meet your specifications. Or, for that matter, why you aren’t seeking to buy anything directly from the sellers. You’re well-connected enough to know people who might have what you want.”
“You can try summoning it,” the Weasley suggested.
“Potter.” My voice was patient, like a parent reasoning with a particularly stubborn child. “I can’t hide in your house forever. I need to find the Grimoire. In addition to doing a field examination of the hideout like Granger said, I can use this as an opportunity to look for clues. Sitting in your house with its poor excuse of a library is getting us nowhere. Sorry,” I added quickly to the chandelier swinging ominously above me.
“You can have him,” Dolohov said, thumbing at Harry.
Then he saw me. His mouth opened in surprise. The toast fell out and he uttered a curse as he bent to pick it up from the floor. I caught a look at his back, as muscled as the rest of his body, the curves mesmerizing. My throat dried.
“Uh huh,” he said, his tone neutral. If I didn’t know Potter, I could have sworn he sounded jealous. “You sure he won’t mind if I wear it?”
“Someone just shot at us.” The words were surreal. If Draco hadn’t just witnessed it, if he didn’t have one hand squarely in the middle of the blood, he would hardly believe it.
They heard the sound of the engine, the car leaving like a gunshot. Once the lot was empty again, Draco stood, stretching his arms.
Damn. Now I was definitely going to be late. I looked at Blaise evenly. “Potter is joining me for dinner with my parents.” I made no effort to elaborate further. I hadn’t mentioned the Grimoire or the attacks to any of my friends. I knew the less they knew, the safer they would be.
“I don’t agree with that, Mr. Malfoy,” Potter said. I tensed. Potter hearing this was not the best idea; it had only been by his conviction that we were reformed to which we owed our freedom and our comfortable life. “This ‘way of life’ doesn’t need to involve lording over the Muggles with the idea that they’re lesser.”
Draco wondered when his role had evolved from consulting on archaeological and family matters to helping the Secret Service apprehend a criminal organization. “What about the recovered artifacts?”
“What about my father’s papers?” Draco wondered what he had just agreed to. On the face of it, it didn’t seem much different than if someone invited Draco to his estate and assess the heirlooms. But uneasy nerves unsettled his stomach.
Draco stopped, his mind full of plots and stratagems – frozen. He wasn’t sure if he had heard right.
“No, I had the house-elves bring it from the Manor.” I gave an embarrassed laugh. “I haven’t been out of my house before today.”
“Sorry,” he said, blinking hard. “I hate the countryside.”
“Yes, that would be what I refer to.” I knew it wouldn’t be long before the Ministry took notice of the event. It had improved markedly in effectiveness. “A man in a cloak attacked me. I defended myself within the limits of Section Four, clause B of the International Statute of Secrecy, and –”
me something. It was wrong.”
Vesper felt her stomach give a lurch. “Yeah, I am. I invited him to Hermione’s party, actually.”
“What’s that?”
Harry let their pace lull Draco into an almost meditative state of tantric pleasure before, in one swift movement, he grabbed Draco by the hips and slammed him down onto his cock, his own hips thrusting upward to meet him. Draco cried out in surprise, but the moan that followed told Harry he’d gotten the angle just right. He did it again.
“Challenge accepted,” he said, and rolled over onto his stomach.
“Only a little,” Hermione replied. She had told Ron that her parents were sick, only... not the kind of sick she really meant. She had intended to go visit them, and when Ron asked why, she had every intention of telling him the real reason as well. She got as far as "They're not well" before she choked, seeing the concern already pooling in Ron's eyes. She found she couldn't go farther, knowing that once she said it she wouldn't be able to unsay it, knowing what a cloud it would cast over the day and the party. So she said that her parents had the Muggle flu instead, and she was just going by their house to check on them.
But that was a question for another time. Wine glass in hand, she decided to make the rounds of her guests, making sure everyone was enjoying themselves. She chatted with Angelina and Hannah for a bit, then went to check on how Fleur was faring with the children. Audrey was there as well, the two women discussing the pregnancy and the way that Audrey and Percy had decided to set up the nursery.
Harry was no longer in the pool of his apartment. He was in the murky water of the lake, running out of time, desperate for oxygen. Turning a corner and shoving his way through seaweed, he saw the person he had been looking for, their body sinking, drifting to the bottom of the ocean, losing consciousness. Harry couldn't save them, not if he wanted to come out of this alive. Christmas colors began to decorate his vision, and Harry pushed himself up to the surface, saving himself but abandoning another.
*Mostly* Draco's POV (Harry's POV sneaks in a couple times):
"Well, I've always known how to play, but up until moving here I wasn't very interested in playing." Draco admitted, remembering how he would count down the minutes until his piano lessons were over as a boy.
Harry clenched his fists. Typical pretentious Malfoy behavior. He couldn't deal with this right not, anyway. He had come here to escape the past, not relive it. "Whatever," He said. "I came here to get away from all that. And with your distracting, excruciatingly loud piano-playing, you're making that very difficult to do."
"I take it you like the place," Draco answered, flopping back against the divan.
Fingers jumped across keys, a blur of black and white below Draco's fingers. One stroke of finger against key drew beautiful melodies from the piano, gradually building up to the climax of the piece, the part Draco both anticipated and dreaded. He anticipated it because the climax of the piece was absolutely beautiful, finishing off the song perfectly, like the final piece of a puzzle. He dreaded it because it meant the song was a few notes away from ending. The end of the song meant the end of his distraction, his survival mechanism. The end of his peace, until he launched into a new song.
"True." Harry said, the idiocy of his question catching up to him. "Since you've always steered clear of muggles, I'm assuming you didn't willingly play one of their instruments."
Shit. Draco hadn't meant to say that. He bit his lip, a habit he'd picked up over the years. "Something like that."
Smirking, Draco swept the door all the way open, welcoming Harry inside with his natural pure-blood manners.
Harry blinked. The chaos was gone. He was back in present time, in the pool, not in that lake. He was okay. Except in all the ways that he wasn't.
Out of sympathy for poor, blushing Potter, Draco's chuckles eventually slowed. "Let me get you some tea, Potty."
Ok, screw it.
"Careful, you don't want me to laugh like an adorable bunny again, do you?" Draco taunted.
But Harry did. He was so lucky and he didn't even realize it.
"I don't know if I'd call it nice," Harry grumbled under his breath. "Why are you here?"
Refocusing on his surroundings, Harry straightened his shoulders, took a deep breath, and knocked on the door. A moment of silence passed. Irritated, Harry pounded on the door again, and it finally swung open.
It also meant Harry had to combat his persistent fear of water on his own. After a while, he was able to drink a glass of water without breaking down. After a while, taking showers and baths grew bearable. He still avoided lakes and oceans like the plague, but, after a while, he was able to swim in pools again. Including the crappy, smelly pool that Sunny Spaces Apartment Complex offered. Shitty name, shitty service, shitty pool- but it would suffice.
"Shut up! You're the one who started laughing like an adorable bunny!" Harry spat out and instantly clapped a hand over his mouth.
Without paying any mind to them, Harry cannonballed into the pool, hoping the water would wash his worries away. The blonde figure watching him from a window went unnoticed.
"What the hell are you doing here?" Was Harry's instant response, as if it were rehearsed.
"Back to the piano-can we come to an agreement? You won't play your death machine for five bloody hours?"
Harry tried to shove the sudden thoughts away, the thoughts that wouldn't have made an appearance if Malfoy hadn't put them back in his head, if the water weren't so cold, if he weren't in such a terrible mood.
"Oh, so now you're playing host and offering me a drink?" Harry bit out.
"I guess. Whatever. Answer the damn question."
"Well, if you weren't planning on filing a police report and throwing the piano in the nearest dumpster, you could've at least gone to the front desk and asked for the previous owner's name. So you could figure out who sent it to you."
"Wait, you knew how to play?"
Harry knew he was right, that Ron and Hermione had been searching for his address, searching for a way to contact him. But that was none of Draco Malfoy's business. "You don't know. You don't know the details or what really happened sixth year. You don't know shit. And why do you even care?" Harry yelled, the words coming out louder and harsher then he'd intended.
Harry leaves Draco's apartment with a lot to think about, and a swimming session goes horribly, horribly wrong.
Wait, what?
A part of himself that Harry couldn't identify was strangely disappointed with this. Harry didn't want to admit that a part of him hoped that Malfoy really did care. For whatever damn reason, a part of Harry had wanted to believe that the concern in Malfoy's blue eyes was real, that Malfoy would listen to him if he ever worked up the courage to revisit the past he wanted to forget.
"What's your deal with this thing, anyway?" Harry asked.
"It's not obvious? I live here, what else?"
Draco laughed harder at this. What a scene this was, the renowned Harry Potter slipping up and calling his rival an adorable bunny. Naturally, Harry's cheeks were redder than the time he had walked in on Hermione and Pansy doing it.
"Potter?" Draco finally said, deciding that someone should break the tense silence.
Draco shook his head. "Potter, Potter, Potter. Considering the fact that you're The Boy Who Lived, I would expect you to be a little less dense. "You've been living here longer than me, and you haven't yet noticed that this apartment complex has zero management and the staff is out in the back smoking weed 99.9% of the time instead of helping residents?"
"You know exactly what happened in sixth year. You saw Rita Skeeter's articles. Everyone did." Harry continued, almost stumbling over the words as he spoke, as if they were painful to say.
"It's my way of saying that these past two months have given me some time to reflect. But that's neither here nor there, Potter. Anyway, I didn't buy this piano originally. It had been left behind by the previous owner when I moved in, with an unsigned note saying it was a gift from them to me, that I would need it."
He needed to go for a damn swim.
Some hero he was.
Draco did know. Most people at Hogwarts knew the main story, the gist of what had happened. But even though there was plenty of speculation, distaste and controversy regarding Harry Potter after the incident, not everyone had turned on him. He had overheard countless students (particularly Gryffindors) bitch and moan about how they missed the presence of Potter, about how the incident wasn't entirely his fault. He had observed the defense some students would jump to whenever someone spoke ill of Potter's name. Even some of the newspaper articles outlining the scandal would give Potter the benefit of the doubt, with the exception of Rita Skeeter's articles. She milked the incident for all it was worth. Bottom line: Not all the attention Harry had gotten from the incident was negative, and something about that both relieved and bothered Draco.
Just before his left hand could spring into motion, a harsh knock sounded.
"Besides, I've moved into this God-forsaken muggle ridden flat right next door to you. I'm kind of past avoiding them at this point." Draco added, then bit his lip in hesitation, wondering whether or not he should say the next few words. "And Potter, please keep in mind that two years have passed since we were in school together, and I don't necessarily stand by all the remarks I made towards muggles then."
No other witch or wizard... but him.
This didn't sit well with Harry. Because Draco's laugh was oddly sweet, like melted honey, contrasting sharply with his general sour personality. The sound emitting from his mouth didn't at all sound like his crude, hasty laughs back at Hogwarts. It was something new. Draco's laugh was, to Harry's shock and horror, pretty.
Okay, maybe take out that next part, since his neighbor was probably am muggle. No other witch or wizard would ever move into a muggle complex under any circumstance.
"Shit," Harry muttered under his breath at the sound of the piano starting up next door- AGAIN. Normally, Henry would've condemned himself for using muggle-curse words instead of his typical "Merlin's beard!" but he was so pissed off at this point, he didn't care what sort of language he used.
"Believe me, I was quite bewildered myself. I was planning on throwing it away, but I had a gut feeling, and decided to play around with it for a little while before giving it up. The next thing you know, I'm playing for the next two hours. It just had that effect, the way most coping mechanisms do."
"Well, I told you that it wasn't my intention to interrupt your Gryffindor man brooding time. But, putting intentions aside, it is unfortunate that Gryffindors seem to have no taste in music."
Draco swung the door open, to see the last face he'd ever expected to see. Green eyes met gray, and as a result, Draco's mouth swung open like a nicely oiled hinge. Harry Potter's mouth formed the same shape, surprise dancing in his eyes, the eyes Draco had studied for years. When that enticing green stare was directed at him, it was usually full of moderate resentment and bitterness. Surprise was a nice change of pace. It made sense, considering the fact that Draco and Harry had had a moderate rivalry back at Hogwarts. Draco had messed with Harry and his friends at times, but hate was a strong word. Draco had learned the hard way that he didn't want to be on the other side of the great Harry Potter's wrath.
Draco shrugged to himself and decided to ignore it, not wanting to leave his comfortable spot at the piano. Before he could move a muscle, another knock sounded, a considerably more aggressive one. Draco could practically sense the impatience simmering on the other side of the door. Draco bit the bullet and stood up.
"Wait, what am I thinking?" Harry admonished his mind for betraying him and came to a halt in his pacing. The pool was relatively secluded, but there were a few muggles hanging out on the side giving him a strange look, probably inquiring after his pacing and muttering.
"Ok, ok, Malfoy. I'll come inside and we'll figure this piano thing out. But if this is a joke and you're about to dump a bucket of ice over my head or something, I'm going to turn you into a ferret, your rightful state."
"Well?" Harry asked. "I'm all ears."
No. Shitting. Way.
Draco held back a chuckle. He found it amusing how Harry could be oblivious one moment and witty the next, all within the span of a few seconds. "My father insisted I take piano lessons when I was younger. Even if pianos were a muggle-made instrument, they were sophisticated and cultured, according to him. At the time, I begged to differ." When Draco thought back on his indifference towards pianos at the time, he was certain he must've been out of his mind. Today, he didn't know what he'd do without his piano.
"Keep playing your piano so loud, and I'll unleash Avada Kedavra on you," Harry recited in his head.
Harry's neighbor, whoever the hell he was, needed to shut the fuck up. Classical music, while beautiful, grew very strenuous after five. straight. hours.
The water was cold today. It made sense, considering the fact that it was almost autumn, but it still irked Harry. He preferred the typical lukewarm temperature, so it didn't feel like he was swimming in a lake like... that day. He tried his best to endure the chill, swimming a few laps around the pool with strong thrusts, the coldness of the water familiar. He had improved at disassociating most forms of swimming from the incident over the past few months, but his encounter with Malfoy made Harry feel like he was right back at square one. Swimming was supposed to take his mind off of this, but instead, it was doing the opposite.
Harry wanted to push it, to satisfy his curiosity, but the look in Malfoy's eyes told him it was best to leave it, for now. Not that he cared about Malfoy's feelings. He just didn't want to waste time. He was only here to settle the piano business.
"Don't say a word," Harry seethed before Draco could speak up. "Let me guess. You want to trick naive little Harry Potter into opening up about his dirty little secrets right when he's vulnerable so you can have permanent blackmail material. You'll listen to his little sob story without giving a shit, and then you'll use it against him. What else could be expected from a Malfoy?"
Draco paused. From an outside perspective, his comment did sound hypocritical. They both had problems they were running away from. But for Draco, it was different. No one had stopped Draco from leaving and no one was waiting for him back at Hogwarts. He had no one to go back to.
Harry had always loved swimming, but after the incident, he had steered clear of all bodies of water. Before he took refuge here, he had been hiding out at the Weasley's for a few months. During that time, even fetching water from the kitchen sink was a challenge. Drinking it made him feel like he was choking on it. Eventually, the press found out where he was hiding and Harry had bigger problems than his sudden fear of water. Harry left the Weasley's and moved again. But the press found him- again. So did Hermione and Ron, who stood on the other end of his door, begging for him to let them in. Harry left that apartment before one of them cast Alohomora. He then survived out on the streets for a little while, manifesting in his self-hatred, until he found this flat this January. Trashy, poorly serviced, full of muggles, and the last place you'd expect the Great Harry Potter to be hiding. It was perfect.
Although, it wasn't like Harry was any different. Nowadays, stuffing his mouth full of cotton seemed preferable to witnessing any reminder of Hogwarts.
"You know- the deal. The thing. The big bang."
"My deal?"
"Yes, it is, Potter. When I moved here, I had no other option. But you? You have people back at Hogwarts, back home. People who care about you. Ron and Hermione." The words felt strange and unfamiliar on his tongue, as Draco had gotten used to addressing the two as "weaselhead" and "mudblood" after years of doing so at Hogwarts.
"Fuck off. Stop acting like you don't remember." Harry chugged down some of his tea, so he wouldn't have to waste any more words regarding this particular topic.
"Right," Harry mumbled as Draco approached him, glass in hand. "Most hosts would offer their guests something to drink, you know."
He never had much of an opinion on them, really. They were long, black and white instruments muggles used to generate sound- to generate music. Nothing more, nothing less.
"Right," Draco returned to his spot on the divan. "The piano."
Yetikatter wrote most of the beginning and middle of this chapter while I wrote the end, so the result is an awkward mix of mostly Draco's POV but it kind of molds into Harry's at the end lmao. In the future, Draco's POVS will be more individual and Harry won't steal the spotlight as much lol.
"It's also unfortunate that Slytherins fail to see that their pureblood cult practices aren't so tasteful after five straight hours."
"That's different, Potter," Draco said quietly.
"Maybe I can turn my lease up early, crash at another invisible muggle flat where I won't have Draco Malfoy as my neighbor. Staying next to that bastard is hardly an option anymore." Harry mumbled to himself. He couldn't stand living next to Draco Malfoy and dealing with his mind games, his tricks and schemes. Above all, Harry couldn't handle the way the sunlight caught onto the git's face while he talked snobbishly, somehow making him look all the more attractive. He must have one lucky girlfriend.
"Fine, fine. As I said earlier, my intention wasn't to interrupt your solidarity Gryffindor man brooding time. I'll tone it down with the piano... a bit. Maybe take off an hour or so so you only have to endure four hours of my Pureblood cult practices." Draco tried to sound as smooth and unbothered as possible, but deep down, he was hesitant. Every moment he spent with his piano was sacred. Every second of every song lifted a weight off of his shoulders and eased all his troubles, whether old or new. If Draco hadn't grown into less of a jackass over the past two months, if he didn't empathize with Potter's need for peace, he probably wouldn't be making this agreement.
"And that's not what you're doing? I don't know why you came here, but it's clear you're hiding from something too. Check your hypocrisy at the door, Malfoy."
Harry's POV:
"Don't fucking play dumb." Harry's voice took a cold, bitter edge. Strange. From time to time, Draco did enjoy riling Harry up at Hogwarts, seeing his cheeks grow that lovely hue of red and his eyes fill with that magnificent anger, but he didn't recall Harry being this short tempered.
"I bet you just hate all the attention," Draco retorted, his voice coming out more smug than he intended.
Harry thought he had endured torment before. He had sat through the dreaded detentions with Professor Umbridge during her reign of terror, suffered the unfairly docked points from Gryffindor courtesy of Professor Snape, but this- this was something new entirely. Detentions from that pink, evil, kitten-obsessed witch and a few lost points seemed like paradise compared to this unusual new form of torture.
Harry didn't recognize his movements through his anger. One moment he was standing in Draco's apartment, the next he was back in his. Then he was pulling off his shirt and putting on his swim-trunks. Now he's storming outside. In the event that Draco broke his promise to tone it down with the piano (which he probably-definitely would) Harry wasn't going to listen to him play while seething. No, he couldn't listen to him play at all.
Harry shrugged, and took a seat on the cushioned chair behind him. "Fair enough. So, the piano."
Harry discovers who his 'mystery' neighbor is- and that they may have more in common than he thought.
"Ah, so this is about my piano. Well, Potter, I apologize. My intention wasn't to interrupt your time away from society. Although you'd probably rather eat led than have anything in common with me, I understand the need to be alone, to get away from things." Harry didn't respond, his eyes flickering with surprise. Draco deduced that he probably expected a smug reply instead of this sudden sincerity.
One of them being that, even though Harry James Potter was temporarily free of that horrid memory, his lungs were still filling to the brim with water. His ears were still ringing, and Christmas colors were still decorating his vision.
Harry shook his head. He wouldn't think about that right now. He couldn't think about that right now.
"Right," Harry mumbled, reason catching up to him. "I guess I should've chose a different flat to hide out in."
Harry's POV
Harry then ripped his hand away from Draco's. Draco sensed that he hadn't meant to hold it for that long.
But it wasn't real. It couldn't be.
Draco was unable to restrain another laugh. "Is this your very eloquent way of asking me why I like to play piano?"
Draco didn't respond. Because, truth be told, Draco wasn't entirely sure why he cared. Maybe it was envy. Maybe it was something else. He didn't know.
Harry had to suppress the urge to hold his jaw, simply to prevent it from falling to the floor. Were these words actually coming out of Draco Malfoy's mouth? He was never this sincere. Especially not towards him.
Harry grabbed the cup of tea and took a sip, desperate for something to focus on aside from his embarrassment and Malfoy's stupid quips. Wait, he did. The piano.
"Yeah, but why are you here?" Harry snapped.
And Draco continued to surprise not only Harry but himself with the next words that tumbled out of his mouth. "And... maybe... maybeyoucouldcomeinforasecond? Just to come to an understanding regarding the piano?"
"I was about to ask you the same question, savior of the wizarding world." Draco remarked. "They all said you crashed at the Weasley's before you up and disappeared without another word."
Harry's eyes widened. Draco couldn't blame him. It was strange, that he had been neighbors with Harry Potter for nearly two months and neither of them had realized until now. On the other hand, Draco didn't leave his apartment much, aside from shifts at work and occasional grocery trips. Leaving his apartment meant leaving his piano, and Draco tried to do that as little as possible. Now that he thought about it, it wasn't too big of a coincidence that he hadn't crossed paths with Harry until now.
But he failed.
Although Harry had, for a reason that was beyond him, chosen to enter Draco's home, he still hesitated upon stepping inside. Draco shut the door behind him, to Harry's distaste. Well, if this turned out to be a huge prank and Harry needed a getaway, he could always smash open a window.
Draco sighed. "It won't be long, Potter. Just a way to come to a compromise regarding this piano problem. You have my offer, take it or leave it." He extended a shaky hand, just like he'd done that first day at Hogwarts. Draco didn't know why, but he really, really wanted Harry to accept his offer, the desire ascending beyond the piano matter. Draco hadn't seen Harry since he left Hogwarts two years ago and left everything behind, and certainly hadn't realized he was living next door to him for the past two months. Draco was starting to consider the option that he missed Harry, or at least the amusement their banters provided.
"You play as a coping mechanism?" Harry asked.
Harry took the stairs down to the back, where the pool was located. Harry came to a halt in front of the pool, and proceeded to pace back in forth for awhile, wondering how he would endure living next door to Malfoy of all people. He had already endured it for two months, sure, but at least he hadn't been aware of it. Now, each and every time Harry heard the sound of that piano starting up, he would know that music was being made by Draco Malfoy. He would have the uncanny interaction, the unwelcome conversation they'd shared sealed in his brain like glue.
Harry James Potter has never had a problem with pianos.
Draco severed eye contact for briefly, then stood and approached the small kitchen tucked away in the corner of the room. Tugging open the fridge door, Draco retrieved a carton of orange juice, the closest thing he could find to pumpkin juice at those muggle supermarkets.
“What do we have here?” Harry asked. “Why have we’ve been called in?”
My face burning, I turned to face the body on the floor. It was moving now, the concealment spell still preventing his hood from falling.
Nothing happened. The information in Harry’s spectacles continued to show the car moving.
Potter took advantage of the distraction to shoot an Incarcerous at the intruder. The rope shot out – almost trapping – the intruder’s reaction was too quick: he turned it into sand that scattered onto my floor.
I tried to hide my groan. I had an enormous headache that the coffee this morning had only partially stemmed, and I had more than a feeling that the librarian would undo all its work.
Dark light pooled in Malfoy’s eyes. “Potter….”
Malfoy was not bad in bed, Harry thought, squishing the pillow into a more comfortable state. In fact … Harry stretched, letting the knotted muscles loosen out. He looked around.
I pinched myself. Just such a reaction to an innocuous question boded ill for our working together. But – the sick turn of my stomach at the memory of my flat being broken into prodded me to speak.
“Of course not,” Dolohov said. “We wouldn’t waste all that effort just for you. We could have taken you back in good ol’ England. It’s your fault that you’ve decided to be busybody and interrupt our transaction. We knew your MI6 was watching. We simply moved up our handoff earlier.”
“It probably is protected,” Potter said to the Weasley apologetically. “Remember the locket? When I went with Dumbledore to retrieve it, there were also defenses in place to protect it from the summoning spell.”
So he’s not aiming to kill, I thought as I responded in kind. The knowledge didn’t comfort me.
I had only intended to have drink before I headed home to sleep before Potter’s arrival (I gave up hope of a haircut; the stylist I usually went to needed an appointment at least a week in advance), but one turned into two, and the next I knew, I was downing shots with Granger. She had a surprisingly high tolerance.
“We’re not simply asking you to read the Grimoire to us,” Cross said, taking a sip. “We need a leader. The Blood Circle of Slytherin needs his heir to lead us to create a new world for wizards.”
“What?”
I hit the bushes outside, feeling the cuts and scrapes of wood and leaves against my skin. A soft thud sounded as Potter landed besides me. A whistling sounded – a broom appeared, almost out of nowhere.
“I’m full of surprises,” Draco said, with a tiny raise of his shoulder to substitute for a shrug. “How are you? Are you hurt?”
“I see your point.” Draco ran his hand through his hair. “Then where do you propose we go first?”
Harry emerged through the door, his wand out in one hand, the Grimoire in the other. He entered warily. He started forward when he saw us.
“Hello, my dears.” A woman peeked out of the curtain at them. Draco had expected someone similar to Professor Trelawney, the arts teacher at Hogwarts, all misty-voiced and draped in sequined shawls. To Draco’s relief, Madam Rosa looked no different from a bank manager, dressed in a simple pencil skirt and white blouse. “I usually do readings one on one. It’s much simpler that way.”
Then the realization hit Draco even as a branch narrowly missed his face. His father’s papers. They wanted his father’s papers. The legal documents pertaining to the estate were at the solicitor’s safe, but the others were untouched in the study. Draco had left them there undisturbed.
Suddenly, Draco wanted to hit someone. His father, Dolohov, this mysterious ‘master’ – they had destroyed the family he had, for the sake of greed and whatever twisted desire that grew in the muck of their hearts. What Draco had with Lucius and Narcissa wasn’t perfect – god, it was the farthest from – but he had treasured it nonetheless.
“What? Why?” Harry failed to keep the curiosity out of his voice. “I thought a man like him would love to be on the front page.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes,” Hedwig said. “Our victim is the latest one. Keep in mind however that I don’t have access to the official files and my linking the deceased to the project could be simple conjecture.”
“Yes.” This would definitely fall under the Auror Force’s umbrella. “That means we need to be thorough in our report. We also need to check everything in this room to make sure nothing of Hopkirk’s work is left in the open.”
“It’s my charm,” Potter said. I could just hear his grin in his voice. “I’m not surprised.”
Potter laughed. “You should see your face just now.” He gave me a curious look. “I can’t wrap my head around you drinking with Hermione. You two … well, it’s unexpected.”
I hoped breakfast would be ready for me in the kitchen. Then I laughed at myself. How easy it was to revert to old patterns; I had lost my expectation to be waited upon when I moved to London. I supposed this was one of the dangers of living with a house-elf.
“Ah! You’re up.”
As to the case … this is a worrisome development. These chip schematics, if they fall into the wrong hands … who knows what damage one could do with them?
“What did you think of your first stakeout?” Harry asked.
“Actually, that sounds nice,” Potter answered my mother. He looked at me. In the flickering lights, it seemed like a smile. “Lead the way, please.”
“Really?” Fletcher fairly jumped up at this. “That’s all?”
“Someone who reads,” I said, with an annoyed huff. “And I doubt my clothes are that expensive, Mayfair rent being what is.” I took out my coin pouch. “Do I need to pay upfront? I didn’t bring much on me. I always envy Muggles and their banknotes. And that card, the what’s-it-called – debt card. So convenient. Wonder why we don’t use it.”
They got into the taxicab, speeding along Embankment. Draco’s head drifted pleasantly from the aftereffects of the alcohol. Looking out, Draco took in the flaring pinpricks that pierced through the glass.
“Why don’t you touch it again?” Potter suggested.
It was on the edge of my tongue to tell Potter that appealing to my father’s better natural wasn’t an effective tactic. My father stared at him as if he had grown a second head.
“Doesn’t everyone?”
“Hi,” Harry said, appearing. “Am I interrupting anything?”
Had this been all a trap? Had they foolhardily fallen in a hole that a child could have seen?
“Perhaps it is for the rest of the world,” Wormtail said.
Harry stopped moving.
“Then why do I feel fine?”
Loathe as I were to admit it, the Weasley had a point. If I had not gone willing looking for trouble, my parents would not be in St. Mungo’s right now. And yet, another part of me rebelled at the thought. I wanted to find it. I wanted to see the stuff of legend before my very eyes and touch it with my own hands. I wanted to unravel the secrets found within this thousand-year old book.
Potter’s office was located in a discreet townhouse in Mayfair. I would have mistaken the rust-red brick facade to be an estate agency or brokerage had I not known what I was looking for.
“Don’t be an idiot,” Harry snapped. “That’s not why I’m here. This is a criminal investigation.”
Me too. Harry looked out the window, ignoring the twinkling lights of buildings passing by.
Draco reached out to touch it.
“Let me know next time you’re in London,” he replied easily, ignoring my father’s furious look. “I’m sorry to have to cut this short, but I need to take Draco now. We’ve plans tonight.”
“Don’t remind me,” Harry muttered. He had been in the meeting with Shacklebolt and the Head Unspeakable, Croaker. He would do anything to ensure he would never be in another again. “So there’s nothing out of the ordinary – well, nothing that would suggest any lead to the man’s death in this?”
I could smell the damp and disuse even in this hallway. After the War, my parents had removed themselves to only a wing of the Manor, giving the rest up to shameful memories and neglect. The house-elves did what they could to stem the ravages of time, but without inhabitants, the rest of the Manor gradually would begin to decay despite their valiant efforts.
His knowing gaze trapped me. His words struck a chord, even as I saw them for the ploy they were. The truth hits home, no matter if it is merely a lever used for manipulation.
“I could arrest you –” Harry began –
She nodded. “We can. Go. Make sure he’s alright.”
It was true. There were no more hovercrafts, but the number of people walking had increased to a swarm. There were screams -- the car barreled towards the columned portico of the Royal Opera House. Well-dressed attendees scattered like flocks of birds at the incoming vehicle. At this rate, the velocity made it a deadly projectile that could level the entire building.
“The clear opposite?” I asked with a clear edge in my voice.
“And I’ll be staying with you,” Harry said. “So you don’t need to worry about them breaking through.”
“Anyone else you would like to invite in?” Harry asked, annoyed. “Haven’t you two ever heard of knocking?”
Harry finally finished eating. “Thanks for the biscuit, Professor.”
Was it the War that formed such animosity in him? I mused, as I exited Diagon Alley into the streets of London proper. He might be one of the thousands who suffered at the hands of my father or the Death Eaters. It was possible, and the idea hit me with shame. If that were true, then I should have been more understanding, gave him more leeway ….
He was wondering whether to have Hedwig contact the concierge to inform Malfoy when the slightest of noise alerted Harry to raise his head.
“I’m working,” Harry said shortly. A part of him did find Malfoy’s offer appealing, especially with Malfoy sprawled on the couch in that way. Malfoy, sometime during their conversation, had loosened his tie and collar. Harry could trace Malfoy’s collarbones with his eyes, the neck long and alluring –
Draco didn’t like the reminder of his father’s criminal past. “The unit at 2 Hyde then? It’s an investment property, but I can check if it’s unoccupied at the moment.”
Draco backed up, touching the display case. There was a sudden blare of noise. It quickly faded into a rapid beeping.
Potter gaped at the mess of volumes littering the wide oak table.
“None that I could find,” Hedwig said. “Still, to be on the safe side, I’ll compartmentalize it and put the file in a container.”
“Yes,” I said, forestalling Blaise from any further questions. “He forgot to bring his own.”
Despite the clean classical lines, there was a strong air of Gothic eeriness. It might have been the untended weeds or the ivy growing unchecked on the marble or the thick canopy of trees blocking out the sun, but here the bird chirps were faded, the light muted.
“It must be rather hard in the desert,” Draco said, trying to ignore an inexplicable floating in his chest.
“What have you gotten yourself involved in, Draco?” My father shook his head. “That thing’s dangerous.”
The enamel on the details were intact too. They were mesmerizing, drawing the eye in with its minute accuracy. The Earth, sun, and moon took center, surrounded by the constellations. And moving outward were depictions of life as the Myceneans knew it – farming, war, festivals. Even as Draco examined it, these images flickered, shimmering. They changed, the swords into guns, the plows into tractors –
I pasted on a bright smile as he approached my area of the table. My faint hope that he was going to someone else – dashed.
Now that she mentioned, I noticed that she was only in a safari shirt and khaki pants without cloak or jacket or coat. It was just like her to forget London’s fall weather had a bite to it.
Riddle didn’t pay any notice. Soon, he thought, he would have the secret of the Shield.
“Would you rather spend a night in a cell?” she asked. “And no, we don’t. Gringotts has a direct line to the Ministry when situations like these occur.” She looked at me wryly. “Interesting form of a stretch break. Most would just take a walk.”
Alright, so that didn’t work. Harry, if anything, was even more morose. “Maybe it’ll keep me busy,” Draco said. “In between all the cleaning.”
“Stop being so bourgeois and enjoy yourself, Harry. Military flights are monitored by governments with much more attention than two brats taking their daddy’s jet for a weekend of debauchery in the Mediterranean.”
The night blurred. I ate and drank too much, my head pleasantly light, my stomach comfortably full. Our decibels rose ever higher as more alcohol was consumed. Goyle touched Millicent’s arm as they laughed over something she said, their heads huddled together in a mimicry of a lover’s intimacy.
He fell back onto the bed, Harry on top of him, both surrendering to it.
“You were always a lot better at doing this,” Harry said. It was in a lower octave than usual. Draco’s hands were at work, and Draco tried to concentrate. A half-Windsor wasn’t even complicated, but Draco’s attention kept slipping.
“No!” Harry said hotly. “I haven’t!” He turned imploringly to Draco. “Don’t listen to him. Don’t give them what they want. You’ve seen for yourself what these people are. Think of your father… think of all their victims.”
“Apparently Unspeakables have leeway to come and go as they please for national security reasons,” Hedwig said. “Their entry and exit register in our system, but they don’t trigger any alarms.”
I set the tray down. “How are you feeling?”
“I know.” Some of the fight had left Draco. “That’s why I came all the way here instead waiting for you to return tonight. It seemed like a piece of information that needed to be shared straight away.”
“Yes,” Shacklebolt said. “That’s why we were so delayed coming here. There was more trouble there than expected. Apparently they thought you were going to head there instead.”
This was a new level of paranoia, I thought, as I cut a piece of toast that had been from my parents’ leftover breakfast. At least I hadn’t ordered the house-elf who brought me the food to taste-test it. That would be extreme. Not to mention unnecessary.
They landed in a small private airport on the island closest to where the shipwreck was supposed to be. They were met there by a pot-bellied man in a Hawaiian shirt.
Harry shook his head. He was being overly fanciful, and he needed to keep all his wits about him if he wanted this night to be a success. His team kept a watch on the entire city, and the SI analysts kept up a constant stream of projections where the drug runners would be. Every sign pointed to his section being where they would most likely be.
“Oh, I don’t mean that I was unfaithful, or that I had a roving eye.” Potter gave a twisted smile. “More that I was used to being on the move, too comfortable with uncertainty and danger to really lead a domestic life. Of course, coming to the realization that I enjoyed the attention of both men and women didn’t really help settle me into domestic bliss either. It was a surprise, I tell you.”
I was already here.
“No,” Shacklebolt said. “Just deal with them as they arise.” He sat back in his chair. “But enough about interagency politics. What else have you discovered?”
“Of course.” I could have sworn my mother winked at Harry. “Don’t let us old fogeys keep you from your fun.”
“What would they be doing in the Underground?” Pre-war, it had been a thriving transportation network. Now, it was nothing but a wretched hideout for the scum and villainy of London. Not that Harry was surprised Ministry officials frequented it. There was a thrill to illegality that everyone, no matter how highly placed or wealthy, succumbed to. Not to mention the brothels and the gambling dens….
It was not a particularly noteworthy flat of any kind. Bland, with moderately priced furniture looked like it was ordered from a digital catalogue. The room was decorated with the taste of someone who saw a picture from a glossy and attempted to transpose it to life. There was a small console meant for home use and nothing more involved in the corner, a small doorway leading to the what appeared like the kitchen, and a smart-couch that responded to a person’s stress and attempted to match its own softness for muscle relaxations. All very typical.
“There’s nothing to talk about,” I said, determined to wait patiently for the book to finish writing. “It was a kiss.”
In the shadows, it was easy to picture Harry’s face above him, the invisible pressures the weight of Harry’s chest.  Draco pulled and flexed, losing himself –
Luna leveled a glare. “If you can be patient, I’m going to explain it to you.”
They sat quietly for a while, each lost in their own thoughts.
It was quiet enough that I almost wondered if Harry could hear my heart racing. This meant something, taking me to see his parents’ grave. No matter how I tried to justify my acquiescence as mere academic interest, or however Harry tried to play it off, it was monumental.
The wall smoldered at the impact of the Killing Curse. I ignored the pain in my chest, running to Harry’s side. It smelled of charred paper.
Potter attacked the mound of sandwiches with gusto. I settled for a more sedate pace, pouring out cups of coffee for us both.
Draco stood, blood rushing to his cramped shoulders. “You could have been killed. How did you know he had a knife in the first place, anyways?”
“You borrowed it? You two have very different styles though. Or — oh....” He drifted off in embarrassed silence. Finally, he said, “Are you two ... you know....”
Potter appeared thrown off by my sudden change from reticence to bluntness.
“Is that Draco?” My mother’s face appeared in the fire. “Hello dear. How are you?”
There was a figure in the circle, surrounded by chanting men in a room lit by candlelight. A snake hissed, coiling around the man. As the men looked on, the figure in the center drew back his hood, revealing the librarian. He raised his wand in the air and out spit the ouroboros that blazed on the cover of the Grimoire. It hovered, sulfurous green, circling above the group.
I thought of all the times I had argued with my father while my mother looked on, exasperated. I took a deep breath. “I’m not going to let them get away with this.”
I swallowed. Potter noticed the reluctance.
Draco made to go after them but the ladder was already out of reach. Dolohov too, had already sped away.  He didn’t even bother to look back.
Harry had never seen anything like it.
“You bastard,” Harry gasped. Malfoy’s hands explored Harry’s body with a familiarity that left Harry writhing. “Don’t – ugh, fuck, that feels –”
“My dear friends,” he said, calm and unaffected, “I don’t think we shall be seeing each other again. You can remember today as the day you almost caught me. Don’t be upset, Granger. It’s the closest anyone’s ever come so far.” He made a sardonic now.
“Don’t we have specialists? I’m assuming you want to examine the objects. We can remove them and have Malfoy view them after the raid’s completed.”
“Yes,” Draco said. “I think I can promise that.” Their mouths met, Draco getting lost in Harry’s lips, allowing himself to forget, for a time, the dangers ahead.
But the Grimoire — Potter had proven that the Founders’ Heirlooms were real. Maybe this included the Grimoire.
“We need to talk to someone,” Harry shouted. “Anyone!”
“Did you eat yet?” I asked suddenly. My stomach grumbled. “I’m getting hungry.”
Honestly, he needed better things to do. I looked at him, not bothering to hide my dislike. He had never stopped blaming me for my actions during the War. Whereas most others gave me a wide berth or side-eyes and scowls, this man seemed to take my presence in the Reading Room as a personal offense.
I felt disingenuous for saying that. In truth, I didn’t give a damn about the female Weasel, and I was not sure if Potter had children either. Or at least, the glossies had found that detail too dull to publish. It was just a convenient excuse, and guilt poked at me for manipulating Potter’s decency in this manner.
But … I should treat this as an adventure. The life of an academic — aside from what one sees in fiction — was relatively cosseted. Quests for historians, even a magical one, was more mental than physical.
When he realized I was not going to respond further, the librarian said: “I only wonder because it seems to be one of ours. Yet without a cover, it’s very difficult to identify.”
The doors of the elevator slid open to reveal a foyer in elegant marble and chrome, with floor-to-ceiling windows revealing the expanse of London glittering beyond. It was breathtaking, and Harry fought a losing battle not to be impressed.
It was more to emphasize to Potter that I was a Malfoy, and that we were supremely different from each other, our temporary alliance aside, I told myself. Nothing more. Certainly not to make myself more appealing in his eyes. And it was not like I had many options in my closet. Most of the closet was filled with Potter’s clothes. But I had secretly tasked Kreacher with fetching some items from my own wardrobe. I knew Potter would disapprove, but his sweaters were too big, and frankly, I was tired of wearing old band t-shirts.
I shook my head. In my view, she was fighting a losing battle: the wounds were carved too deep.
I refrained from rolling my eyes. “Yes, father.”
I gazed upon him, solid and real, touching him to reassure myself that this was all real. He caught my hands, flipping me in a quick maneuver onto my back.
“Malfoy?”
“And why,” Draco asked, managing to keep his voice level, “was there a reason for you to watch my house in all that time?”
The computer beeped again.
“That’s not what your friend did.” Potter pulled me behind him. “Your friend tried to kill us.”
It was too difficult to fly with his vision being clouded by data. Harry needed all his concentration to pilot the Firebolt. The spectacles provided a solution that didn’t strain his attention, and he had gotten used to wearing them, despite the odd looks from others in an age when unimpaired and enhanced vision could be achieved with a single operation.
“Yes. I thought you might be hungry. I remember you used to skip meals while you were working.”
I looked at Potter. “Well, after you.”
“He’s a dangerous man, Draco, despite how comical it may be to adopt such a stupid nickname. He’s a mass murderer, someone who kills without compunction, and sometimes even without reason.”
“Are you cold?” Harry asked.
Bellatrix held up her hands. “I can see when we’re beaten,” she said, in a silken purr that raised Draco’s hackles even more than the shooting. “We’ll leave.”
An arc of light aimed directly at Harry. Harry turned -- the Firebolt spun – Harry pressed his body as close as possible to minimize the surface area, throwing his weight opposite the motion –
Potter tugged at it. “Ginny used to do it for me.” He fumbled with the silk. I winced. At this rate, he was going to accidentally rip it.
But then, Slytherin set this protection for a reason. For his heir to obtain his wisdom and accumulated knowledge.
Luna shook her head. “We scanned it beforehand. It’s clean. And I have to say, you’re getting paranoid.”
“Grimmauld Place.”
“Oh?” Blaise ran a glance down Harry that had Harry blushing. “So you’re here for sex?”
It was a small, out of the way café nestled in the center of Bloomsbury. The streets were stuffed with people. Coming out of the Tube, Draco was shoved into the middle of a sea of humanity: tourists eager to see the British Museum, or students on their way to the various universities and colleges in the area.
“After you,” Draco said.
“That sounds rather simplistic to me,” Draco said dubiously.
“That’s pretty much the gist of it,” I answered him dryly. My head ached and I regretted my earlier insistence to meeting them with Potter. He was right: I would have been much more comfortable in bed. “The key itself is in the shape of a book, though that’s only its outward appearance. I wonder why it took that shape?” I needed to focus on the academic nature of the problem lest the terror and the near miss of it overwhelmed me.
“I’m not trusting Malfoy with a gun,” Weasley said, with a glare at Draco. “And since when do you know how to shoot anyways?”
“Do you have any record at all?” Malfoy asked.
“Well, we’ll leave you to your … activities,” the Weasley said, eager to get out of the room.
“Then I shouldn’t give them any indication that I’m not useful anymore, shouldn’t I?”
“I’m in charge here,” Bellatrix said, and there was a sharp edge in her tone now. “You just need to make sure you stay alert and not allow something like last time to happen. It was only because you were lucky that you didn’t lose the Shield that our master spared you. If anything like that happens this time, I don’t think he would be so sanguine.”
“All the more reason not to involve Malfoy,” Potter pointed out. “Besides, his expertise is the history of Dark Arts, not actual Dark Arts.”
“I did no such thing,” Harry said indignantly. “They refused to stop.”
“I was saying you deserve special commendations,” Fudge said. “After all, you did seize a massive amount of Elixir, and saved our lives in the process. I’m sure Mr. Malfoy would agree.”
When Harry woke, the sun was already midway across the sky, and its light filled the room. The high rafters and arched ceiling left an airy feel, and Harry could look out the window and see the entirety of London below.
I blinked. “What did you do?”
The sky was choked with hovercars and flyers and neon lights from the city’s own buildings. Gold and silver threaded the view, overlaid by red and green from the sensors. Red for unlikely routes, green for the paths predicted that the drug runners will take.
“Where’s Cross? And the Grimoire?”
Harry grinned. “Alright. Do it, Hedwig.”
The door shook.
Harry grinned. “Well, what else do you have for me?” He gestured at the display. “Do you know how to find this ‘Order of the Phoenix’?”
“Thanks.” Blaise dumped mounds of sugar. “Do you have milk?”
“Thanks for the unqualified praise,” I said dryly, settling down beside him. “But in all seriousness, give me more time to think about it, okay?” He really was wearing down my resolve.
“We’re here, boys.” The cheerful voice of the driver cut like a blast of mortar. “Home away from home.”
After exhausting all the safe areas of topic – the ever-English subject of the weather, Ministry gossip, the research I had been working on (thankfully, the manuscript had been untouched during the scuffle with the librarian) – I finally mustered the courage to ask the question that had been troubling me since I called upon Potter.
Malfoy spoke with a sardonic curl, and Harry suppressed the urge to retort with something nasty. That would make the day for all the tabloid reporters watching. “Auror in Shouting Matching With Socialite at Opera.” Harry shuddered, imagining Shacklebolt’s face at the headline and the inevitable lecture he would have to sit through.
“So you were attacked by this ‘Circle’ over some book?” the Weasley said after we finished. “And you’re the only one that can use the key to find it?”
I stared at Cross, unblinking.
Harry somehow managed to steady and unsettle me at the same time. Just his proximity was enough to set my stomach cartwheeling. And yet, when he was near me, I found myself not worrying about others’ opinions, about all the mistakes I had made haunting me in some way.
That’s two for the record, I thought as I poured a tumblerful of whiskey into a new cup of coffee. I supposed once this was over, I should tell Luna that the Quibbler had hit on the truth again.
I wondered idly if I should make Harry share the cost of tonight as I took the envelope from her. Then I decided against it.  After all, half the fun of having a trust fund was spending it. “What is it?”
The interaction between the victim and his coworkers, Hedwig said. Then I tabulated their technical skills, seniority, and interests, and calculated the odds that they would be involved in a project like developing SI web components.
“A single king’s available,” she said, giving us a knowing wink. “And might I just add, we’re very tolerant and welcoming here. In the warmer seasons, we get busloads of tourists from Brighton, all people like yourself, and they love it here. Something about the charming village life and the open air. Perfect for couples like yourself.”
Potter curled one hand on the nape of my neck, the other gripping my thigh. I groaned against his mouth. I was hard, every part of me that came into contact with him on fire.
Ottery St. Catchpole, Devon, UK, 2003:
Draco stared at Harry. His tongue was knotted in his mouth, heavy and useless.
I cursed at the slip-up – Muggles used the term doctors, not healers, but she didn’t seem to notice, as agitated as she was.
It was clear now, though there was still nothing to be found. Draco had always found swimming, whether in a pool or in a natural body like right now, to be soothing. Even with the residents here moving with stealthy precision did not detract from the relaxing tenor.
I understood. Potter leaving the Ministry would have cast a shadow, regardless of the reason why. It would have made at least page two on the Prophet, most likely along with screeching columns decrying the government’s ability. I wondered why he left. Must be a personal issue, since Granger was still here. I doubted she would have stayed when he left if it was related to government decisions.
“It’s beautiful. I miss this place. It’s funny, isn’t it? I’ve traveled all over the world, been to four continents, and yet I still think my old school is the best place in the world.”
Potter picked himself up. “I would advise you against touching the book-key again. Not until we have a good sense of how to break that protection so it’s safe.” He eyed me like he could read my thoughts. “I know it’s tempting to dwell in the past – this time literally – but you have to resist it. Even without knowing all the other ill effects touching this book-key could have.”
Time stopped. I watched as his face, usually set in cold patrician calm, contorted in surprise as he fell on his back.
The Dark Lord regarded the man coldly. ‘You resisted my Cruciatus, so I accept you have resources beyond what others possess. However, as you point out, it is only a small trick. You’ll have to prove you have more than that for me to help you. What is it you wish for my assistance anyways?’
“How’re your friends?” Harry asked. “I think I heard Gregory Goyle recently starting his own builder’s firm. It was in the alumni newsletter.”
“Oh.” That made more sense. “Are you sure it’ll work? I don’t think the security here are fools.” Or Draco hoped not. He probably invested in some of the companies in the Gherkin. It would be terrifying to think that they – and his money – would be so exposed to thieves and potential espionage.
My father looked at me impassively, unmoved. “Why isn’t this a formal Auror interview, then?”
Harry’s thoughts swam like molasses. There was something mocking in Malfoy’s tone, but harry couldn’t for the life of him come up with a passable repartee. He thanked Malfoy again.
“How come I don’t know about this?” While Potter’s antics did not make the front pages anymore, the papers still loved publishing stories about him. The Chosen One still sold copies.
“They’re difficult to track, my lord. It might bring more delays, not to mention additional demands for renumerations,” Bellatrix said.
He shrugged, setting my milk on the bar top as he tapped my coffee machine. It made a little noise and began to steam. I sat down, heavily; my legs were about to give way. The mesmerizing smell of coffee filled the room. I breathed in. Heavenly.
“Oh yes. Draco Malfoy is one of the world’s most renowned cybershrink.”
“We’re not sure if the source of the Elixir supply is from Underground, sir,” Harry said. “We don’t have the manpower or the trust with their residents to root it out. It was only by chance that one of our agents had spotted a transaction between a dealer and had exercise the presence of mind to track rather than immediately arrest.”
“No,” Harry said hastily. “No, it’s alright. Besides, we know what’s going to be said, anyways. The drug situation is under control, we can’t comment on an ongoing investigation, all available resources are being allocated to deal with the any potential conflicts between criminal gangs invested in selling Elixir, etc.”
Draco found them sipping tea in the sitting room. The maid was right — they did look ‘mighty posh’. Their suits were not Savile Row, but they were neatly pressed and immaculate. Draco felt himself at a disadvantage in his dirt-streaked jeans and sweat-stained shirt. He hadn’t changed since the melee with Dolohov and Wormtail.
The air froze in Harry’s lungs. Even at this current state of mind, Harry still had enough capacity to be horrified.
Draco ignored the bumps as the all-terrain vehicle plowed forward, the GPS in the car beeping.
“Yes.” Draco clenched his glass. It was no act. The anger still smoldered. “Why bother with being a good person when every one expects you to fall in the end?”
“I’m glad you like them,” Harry said self-consciously. “I wouldn’t know what to do with them. They’re not really my color, and I don’t really know how to put them on, you’ve seen me with a tie –”
There was silence as Shacklebolt registered what Harry said. Harry waited, wondering how Shacklebolt would receive this analysis. Web burnout was especially prevalent among those with heavy cyberized bodies, which included essentially all of the Auror Force. And the Ministry, for that matter. It was a great danger, one that risked not only psychological, but physiological damage. Elixir was created by a well-meaning neuro-chemist to alleviate the symptoms of that, but ended up being far worse in consequence.
“It should be from centermost out,” Draco said. “It’s clear that the center represents Heaven, form which wisdom, and the gift to understand wisdom emanates. The zodiac is supposed to be the way that the gods show humans how to behave. Aristotle, coincidentally or not, was supposed to be one of the pioneers of combining his school of philosophy with astrology. To the Greeks, who got a lot of their concepts from the Egyptians and the Mesopotamians, the Earth and the Heaven were connected, and there was a link between our spiritual, psychological and physical experience.”
“You drive a hard bargain, sir,” Finnegan said glumly. “You know how much I hate paperwork.”
“Hullo,” I said, finally. “You look – good.”
Draco flung the flashlight at Bellatrix, throwing it like a javelin. It was much too to travel like one, the head going askew as it arced through the air. What did matter, though was that the glare flashed directly in her eyes, as Draco intended.
“You’re too dressed,” he said. He held his liquor remarkably well, despite downing twice as much as I had drunk. He still sounded remarkably coherent, with only a slight softening to his words.
“I’ll bring it back to the office to analyze, then,” Harry said. “You’re certain that there’s nothing wrong with it otherwise? No hidden computer viruses or anything?”
“Before they died, they were all spotted by our cam-eyes going into the Underground.”
Then, I knew what to do.
“We guessed,” Granger said simply. “If I were attacked, I would be seeking the safest place I could think of. And this would be a logical first choice.”
Potter gave me a small smile. “One ex-wife. No children.”
“Of course.” In truth, Harry needn’t even bothered. Like all officers under the National Security Department, he was not beholden to the accountability laws that regular Law Enforcement agents had to obey. Shacklebolt, however, liked to make a show of his own people voluntarily following these rules, saying that transparency bred trust with the community. Personally, Harry doubted that – cynicism towards the government went too deep for a superficial demonstration of compliance. “You can check my SI recording, sir,” Harry added.
“Have you found Cross yet?” A few days after I had left St. Mungo’s, Granger had come with the news that they had found Cross’ body in the ruins. It was possible that his body had burned to ash by the fire, but Granger’s face creased with uncertainty even as she mentioned that.
“Slow down, man,” I laughed, as he dug in. “Don’t want you to choke.”
I wondered Potter and I had reached a stage in our acquaintance where I could ask. It was personal, but we had – kissed – and didn’t that give me the right?
I caught a flash of surprise from him, that he couldn’t believe I was such a strong Occlumens. He had always thought me weak, a traitor who had not the strength to stay with the Cause.
“Harry can help you. He taught all of us how to duel.” She gave me a small smile. “He told me you hired him.”
But it didn’t matter. Harry was right; in this moment, it was like time had been suspended, that their past had disappeared. Right now, they were just two people, connected by circumstance, offering each other comfort. Draco snuggled close, wishing that they could stay like this forever.
“They have,” Metis’ voice came through the intercom. “Some more than once. Nothing stands out about their visits, however.”
Draco glared at Harry. “Do you also know how much I want to punch you right now?”
There was no other way to describe it; that banshee’s howl, that stumble of pain — something had clearly gone wrong.
“Well,” Harry put on a smile for Finnegan. “That’s easily remedied. I’ll just go find him right now.”
I took out the bottled memory and set it on the table. McGonagall squinted at it with an academic’s interest.
The man took off his hood and I gasped. It was Ted Cross, the Head of the British Museum, Magical Section. I stared in disbelief, and yet it made sense in a way that he was a Circle member. No one else had the depth of knowledge and access to antiquities that he did.
“You know, I’ve never traveled on a private plane before,” Harry said, his legs swinging easily. He was wearing a monogrammed bathrobe with initials BZ, with a glass of water in the other.
London, UK:
They put the DPVs into the water and got into the wetsuits. Draco felt the oxygen flowing instantly as the mask went over his face. He turned on the camera and looked at Harry. Harry was ready, slipping the gun into the holster of his belt.
“Lifeblood of an academic.” I lifted the cup in a toast. “Cheers.”
This must be the nerves, I thought annoyedly, as I sought to disabused myself of these fanciful notions. It was clear, even to my urban eye, that this part of the world had remained undisturbed since likely Slytherin’s visit to hide his Grimoire here. There were no tell-tale signs of any other human activity – broken branches, unnaturally wide clearings, etc. – and the path was probably magicked to keep clear.
Where was Harry in all of this? Draco’s heart hammered so loudly he was almost surprised no one heard him.
Did something happen, Draco wondered? A momentary spasm constricted his throat. He knew that Riddle kept a close watch on him. The hot burn of shame and frustration at losing the shield was like bile.
Harry stared at the stack some more, taking in its massive size. “You can’t be serious.”
It took Draco a second to catch up. “The abuse?”
He risked a glance up at Draco, to find him hanging on Harry’s every word. He swallowed.
Ron nodded, likely understanding that Hermione was referring more to Blaise’s relationship with Vesper than his relationship with Daphne.
didn’t I? I gave you a second chance-“
“You don’t need to apologize, Harry,” Draco said, leaning to give the corner of his mouth the softest of kisses. “There’s no need to be sorry. I guess I just wanted to know… I didn’t want to come into this with me assuming one thing and you assuming another. I just want us to be on the same page about things, I suppose. While at the same time being open to whatever comes, obviously. But the issue of children specifically had come up a couple of times and I suppose I just wanted to make my feelings clear, in case there was any question. And I wanted to know where you stand.”
“Maybe I do,” Kyle said, mostly just to shock her. He wasn’t actually sure if that was true. Maybe, if he really couldn’t get this sorted out on his own, he would find someone to talk to. “It’s something worth thinking about. But I’ll make that call for myself.”
“Hurts the relationship?” Draco echoed, not understanding. “I’ll grant you the former, but all relationships require
“A bit more?”
On the way back to his quarters after the gathering, Draco tried to sort through his feelings. On the one hand, the entire endeavor had gone quite well. It seemed that McGonagall had not misrepresented things, and the staff was glad to have him join their ranks. In this respect he was feeling more optimistic than ever about his choice to return to Hogwarts, and actually looking forward to beginning the school year and reimmersing himself in his most beloved subject.
“Look,” said the brunet. “Our second course is here.”
"Oh," he said. "I'm sorry. I didn't realize you had company." He gave Hermione a wave, which she returned.
“I can still do magic, though, right?” Kyle stood. “I wanted to finish this part of the procedure today.”
Knowing he ought to at least say goodbye, though, he went in search of his sister. He found her in the lounge retrieving another drink.
Harry furrowed his brow. “Aren’t you tired, Teddy? Don’t you want to sleep some more?”
perfectly happy, and then Blaise-“
“It’s the step between a toy broom and a real broom,” said Narcissa. “It behaves much like a regular broom does, except that it limits how high or fast one can go and has some safety charms built in that keep the rider from falling off or crashing. It’s how many young witches and wizards learn to fly.”
“I told you. It’s not that I refuse to watch the films, assuming I won’t like them. I
“Extra credit,” Draco said, his eyes wide with shock. “We got full marks plus another ten percent.”
“Next week,” she replied. “The exact date hasn’t been set yet, because I haven’t yet informed the Healers of my decision. But that will happen soon. And then we’ll be getting started right away, is my understanding. Which means…” She met his eyes. “You should be prepared to take Teddy within the next few days. That’s awfully soon, I know-“
dinner to shag each other’s brains out. We work up an appetite, go to Voyage, enjoy ourselves without any guilt or pressure, get a good night’s rest, and have even more sex in the morning if we feel like it, before we go retrieve Scorpius.”
Harry almost said. “Yes, Sir.”
“He’s sympathetic to the issue,” said Harry. “He would help if he could.”
“What a Slytherin way of thinking,” Malfoy said, sounding vaguely impressed. “But I don’t intend to write it for you. Just give it here.”
“Well, of course it is,” said Draco. He looked at the photos. “We look quite good. Even your hair is cooperating.”
. While you were just perfect in absolutely every way.”
Hermione enjoyed a pleasant chat with her two friends for a few minutes, but had to soon leave them to the food so she could greet the other guests that were arriving. This included George and Angelina, who were newly engaged and looking quite happy about it, Penelope Clearwater, who gave her a warm birthday hug, and Kingsley Shacklebolt, looking kind and ministerial as usual.
“What?”
“Sure.” Hermione had been hoping to sit down with the Mind Healer during her visit, wanting a progress report on her parents. She could see visibly that there was improvement, but the Healer’s take on it, the analysis of the progress, was even more valuable.
“Don’t you deserve a rest, after everything that just happened?”
“All right, not in those exact words. But I understood the subtext.”
do you like them?” Draco asked. The firewhiskey had loosened his tongue perhaps a bit too much, but he was definitely enjoying himself, and that was something.
He looked down at her, as if contemplating his answer. Finally, he nodded. “Yes. It’s been one hell of an autumn, hasn’t it?”
“My pleasure, Aunt,” Draco said, giving her a kiss as well.
“Teddy said more to you about what happened with Ms. Sturgis, didn’t he?” Draco said, reading Harry's face.
Harry couldn’t help his answering blush.
It was inevitable. The two men were going to get married and have lots of babies and live happily ever after. The bastards.
Harry stuck to his assigned role, though, and was thankful for it, since there was a bit of a near miss early on when he spotted the Snitch hovering not far from the far right Hufflepuff goal post. Gryffindor was only up twenty, at that point, and Harry knew that Ron would not be happy if he caught the Snitch so early.
In the evening they went out for drinks, meeting up with a couple of other friends Max was sure Kyle would like. Kyle had heard that before, and might have gone in with some skepticism, but it turned out to be true. They were artsy types, like Max, but very down to earth and just as happy to hear from Kyle as to share their own perspectives. So not at all like Evan’s old friends that Kyle disliked so much.
anything, Harry.”
Her eyes flickered to him a moment. “That’s true,” she said.
). “We’ll have our house winning the Cup this year, just you wait and see.”
“Ok,” Kyle replied, surprised. “What is it?”
“Hi.”
“As far as what
Harry’s eyes shimmered in the green flames of the fire. “Would you?”
But he didn’t want to lose himself, not completely. Because Harry was underneath him, and Harry needed satisfaction too. So he thrust in again, a little faster this time, and aimed for Harry’s prostate. After another few thrusts he found it, and Harry gripped Draco’s biceps hard. The nails digging into his flesh grounded him, and Draco thrust again, and again, and again, hitting that spot over and over. Harry had yet to lose all sense, but as Draco looked into his eyes he saw the pleasure, the impending climax, building in them.
Draco chuckled. “I don’t remember this at all.”
Harry shrugged one shoulder. “I pay attention.”
He expected David to argue, to insist that he run right over to Draco’s and tell him everything. But he didn’t. He sat back in his chair with a sigh, and said, “All right. I understand. I know it’s more complicated than it looks from the outside. Draco told us a bit about his ex-wife, the divorce…”
“By us,” said Harry. “He already has. He’s written in favor of our relationship. He wants the wizarding world to move on from its obsession of who’s a Death Eater and who’s a pureblood. I’ve read it directly from his articles. I remember because they’re among the few I can actually stand to read.” He put his hands on Draco’s hips as Draco’s hands slid down his neck. “I want you to do the interview with me.”
“Hm.” Kemp’s mouth turned down slightly at the corners. “We may have to do something about that modesty of yours.”
“Hogwash. The contract every parent signs when they enroll their child stipulates that you have the right to remove a child from the program if you deem it necessary.”
“I think, when he’s forgiven himself for what he thinks he’s done, he will,” said Harry.
“But it’s not just about that. It’s not really about that at all. Draco breaking up with me wasn’t exactly fun, but it’s the end of my relationship with Evan that really… That’s what I’m wrestling with, more than anything. And I just don’t think dating someone new would help me with that.”
Harry sighed, staring up at Draco as Draco stood looking at him. “I did think that before, but now I’m not so sure. I mean, it did upset her, but… she would have found out anyway, don’t you think? Better she hear it from us.”
Draco heaved a sigh, but went on. “So we were into it, and I thought I was doing pretty well, all things considered. But then before I knew it Rick was dragging me off the dance floor towards the loo. At first I was excited. I thought, ‘This is really going to happen.’ I
“Yes, I’m fine, thank you.”
“I appreciate that,” said Hermione, eager to get to the point.
“Heading out?” he asked, his voice still a little rough from sleep. The sound of it did something to Draco, a kind of sweet, tugging ache in his navel, even after five years, and he bent down to give Harry a kiss. It was returned lazily. “How long?” Harry asked, once Draco pulled away.
He managed to lift a tired arm and run a hand down Clint’s back, which was slick from his exertions. The hand climbed up the man’s spine, over the back of his neck, to rest gently in Clint’s hair. The curls nestled his fingers invitingly, and he stroked a few times, feeling Clint settle even more against him.
“Well, it doesn’t make much of a difference now, does it?”
“Fuck me.”
“I checked the roster. Weasley’s finally put us together. We duel this afternoon.”
Draco removed his fingers and reached over to one of the bedside tables. Harry watched him from under his arm as Draco took out something long and red from one of the drawers, and Harry realized it was a dildo. He didn’t get a good look at it, but he didn’t think it looked quite as big as Draco’s cock.
It was quite a tempting invitation to say the least. In truth, Draco didn’t want to walk away from Harry just yet. But he also knew it was an invitation he couldn’t accept, not right away.
She laughed. “I mean in a very tough, manly way, of course.”
Potter’s mouth nipped at a spot at the back of Draco’s jaw, the spot right under his earlobe, and Draco groaned as if Potter had touched his cock. The sensation was that sweet, that sharp, that
“Harry, that’s what parenting
“Hm,” Harry said, eyeing Malfoy for a moment. “You want to preserve wizarding culture, yet here you sit, wearing Muggle pajamas.”
“I appreciate everything you did, Gerald. Ron and I both owe you a lot. But please, never defend Robards’ decision to me. There is no argument you could make that would make me accept it.”
She looked down at her shoes a moment. “I understand. But it’s not like that. I promise it isn’t.”
“It is Master Draco who should be having rest,” Pipsy insisted. “You is having a bad day.”
it to me.”
Vesper fought a smile. “Something like that. Plus, you know… I want to – to do something
“Is this what you wanted to talk about?”
Draco turned, and Harry relished the view of Draco’s glorious arse as he started walking away. As if he could sense the gaze, Draco turned, looking back at Harry with a smug smile on his face. Harry grinned back at him, amused that, even completely naked, even after three days of hardly sleeping, his boyfriend still managed to put some swagger in his step.
