that clung to the air. “If he destroyed the work himself, it means he took steps to make sure they didn't get what they wanted. So it’s possible that he knows who they were or why they attacked the Manor in the first place."
Dramatically, he refused to leave the room but flourished onto the couch, a quick wand movement for the files to shift. Now, he tried to rest though he made it a point to glare whenever Harry tried to speak and ended up turning his back on him. Idiot, as if Draco wasn’t paranoid enough. If Draco happened to levitate over a cushion to settle on, he did it purely to announce he was still awake and ignoring Harry not that he was planning on napping.
The next memory morphed into Draco lying down on the sitting room couch.
Having someone nearby helped keep his mind from wandering, from hyper focusing and losing his time. “This potion will knock you out but there will most likely be numerous side effects.” Draco added more and more measures to the recipe. It shouldn't take too long, though the side effects wouldn't be pleasant, not even for Harry.
“You don’t get to suggest that twice, Zabini.” Draco was nice enough to caution. The next one was going for his face, damned what Pansy would think of her lover’s new looks. He sniffed and went to pick up his wand.
Vrooom. That's the sound of Draco's revenge engine.
“Sorry to interrupt but it is medicine time for Harry.”
“Okay, okay. I’ll set up the post.”
Albus shifted in his chair.
“It would hold some financial interest for you.” Draco left him then, going to sit down and wait for Blaise’s curiosity to win out.
Luna’s drawing.”
The next day, Draco was taught little but enough on how to soak bandages in a distilled mixture of water and and the gloop so it would evenly distribute along the fabric. “Dressings tend to absorb any moisture, this should hold the salve close enough for him to absorb the magic within them without us needing to change the sheets after every application.” It smelt terribly bitter, burnt and Draco was glad it wasn’t going on his arms.
“Tell me you aren’t still a Cannons fan Weasley?”
His parents were in France, living in luxury most never reached.
“Draco, I’m going to take Fornax to the Ministry, that’s still okay, right?” Draco nodded, not too interested in Harry right now. What was the curiosity was Siobhan herself.
“Some stuff, some of Luca’s stuff is still there. Just letting you know, the next time you’re over you’ll see a lot more boxes.”
As if Draco had given the Auror a task, paramount to the safety to all of Britain, Harry nodded once. Determination and a detachment Draco hadn’t expected. Draco sat down on the same backless chair and picked up the quill.
He definitely knew. And Draco refused to scare from this: which was a positive of having his younger years terrorised. There wasn’t much that truly frightened Draco these days, even a suspicious, might-too-close Harry Potter.
“It’s your house.”
Draco returned to his lab, brewed some more and hissed at the cramp. Waiting, heavy eyelids shutting on their own he hummed a tune and sighed. Boiling potions ventured into a static boredom, quiet enough for Draco to snooze, loud enough to keep his focus for a time.
It wasn’t fair. Being undone with kisses and pawing at his skin. Harry yelped, close to it, when Draco shifted back again. Pulled closer, let his raised thigh grind against him.
Perhaps, it wasn’t on their best interest they snuck into their boss’s office and underhandedly retrieved files which they should simply ask for. Was Harry really this incompetent? Draco pretended to hear something at the other side of the room and removed himself.
“I told him.” Harry wasn’t sure if he was admitting to a mistake or not.
Draco sighed, search for the wand forgotten “What're you doing?”
Right. Potions. Cauldron One was smoking, purple swirls that jumped over the others before dissipating. Cauldron Two and Three were quiet. What was the difference in recipe? Ah, more thorns less fang of arachnid.
“Why is it always Muggleborns and Half-bloods who think they can wave a wand and have everything fixed?” Running a hand through his hair, he tried to focus on each word, not the weight in his throat that threatened to silence him.
The crup’s ears twitched and off it ran, nuzzling and scratching at the door before it opened and Jeff looking grim and he mentioned they should both leave. Now. Draco didn’t need to be told again. He grabbed at Harry and apparated as soon as they were outside.
“So, he might not bite.” Siobhan sounded a little too disappointed by that.
Drumming his fingers on the arm of the couch he wanted something – a twitch, a dismissal, anything – but Harry didn’t even hear it. Didn’t have it so much as have his concentration wavier to even acknowledge the pestering noise. To say Harry was being competent for he wasn’t really, not in the grand scheme of his work, but Draco recognised that expression. Whatever Harry considered, planned to get through tonight was going to happen.
Draco and Luna chatted, an occasional point noted by Neville - and somehow, Draco wasn’t sure how - they were talking about plants. Plants. How dull had Draco grown to be discussing this topic? Luna about creatures favourites, Draco about potion application and Neville, well the actual herbology. Drinking his second FireWhiskey, Draco made a very strict point not too look over to Harry and Ginny. He could hear them whispering to each other now too.
“You won’t fall.” Draco wasn’t some scrawny kid who couldn’t hold someone upright. Harry laughed then and it eased the tight coil of shame in his gut as the laughter rumbled against him.
Instead, Draco tried to focus on Harry. Ignoring the scraping and the dink of dippings in the inkwell. He couldn't do this.
So, as Harry and Ginny kept their pace up on going around the room, Draco did the same. Never once standing in the same circle of gossip or conversation. He knew not everyone liked him but he welcomed them all the same. He just pretended they were Luna, who he spied across the room. Now, he had one more reason to move along faster. He hadn’t even given her name much thought, too focused on those he didn’t know.
“Date.” Harry corrected, “He’s my date.” An apology was sent his way in the form of a pale face and a touch of panic. One Draco dismissed because it wasn’t necessary, not yet. Out of the two of them Harry was the one most uncomfortable.
Speaking of clothing, he wasn’t sure he even had anything that would fit without extensive work. Too old, last season, he might need to venture out and buy another suit. Did Harry have one? Best ask sooner then, so as not to blindside him and Draco's plan ruined before it was out the planning stages.
“Wouldn’t mind kissing you now though.”
He hadn’t thought much of Astoria on the days Harry joined him. Maybe this was enough for the metal to burn anew? He licked his lips and quickly tapped onto the metal. Cold. Nothing bubbling yet. Another tap, another touch. And taking the last vestige of bravery he scooped it up in his palm and waited. It sat innocent and shiny in his hand.
“Lions, tigers, bears, giraffes that sorta thing.” No dragons or kelpies? Nothing of interest then. What could any of those do against a griffin or minotaur? “Have you ever seen a platypus?”
“Somewhat.” Draco twirled a loose galleon in his fingers, desperate for a distraction. Why did Harry have to be here? Why couldn’t they just not deal with each other again? That was nice. Go back to seeing each other two or three times in as many months, not days. He didn’t even want to look in Harry’s direction. He just kept remembering.
“It’s a Ferris Wheel. It’s--”
“Oh, so it was a--” An insult. Good. That explained it. Draco would never bring this up again.
“Are you doing them now?” Harry kept going. They swirled inside. Two, Three… Four? Five? What? No. They might clash and merge, taint and twist together, ruining the memory itself. Draco kept an eye on them. If he were poetic he’d call them something wondrous and bright, something illuminating and eye-catching. But he just wanted them separate.
He peered to look at the name. “What is it?”
Just as Draco was settling Lotty, telling her to spend the entire day away - not doing chores or maintenance, no not even the garden - Harry appeared beside him and said in far too innocent a tone for its contents, “You’ll have to lose the robe and cloak.”
Harry didn’t knock, he’d burst in and Scorpius whispered, “I’ll go find them. They must still be here, they have to be.”
ALSO KNOWN ALIASES
She glared at him for some time before she wilted and left the door open. “Better come inside then.” Draco didn’t take long to follow along to the kitchen with her. She accepted him here but Draco couldn’t say what questions or statements might unleash that infamous rage of hers.
He relaxed as it seemed the next few customers were adults. And then Draco wept. Why by all that was good, was Potter and Weasley here? Maybe to warn the owner how awful this place smelled, the polish was giving Draco a right headache.
“We are old.”
He crouched low by her grave, the photographs dark in the early morning.
“And Harry?” Because Harry definitely didn’t know, he was still under the impression he was forced into that form.
How dare-- “This is ridiculous.”
“I'll go get it. It'll help hide that blush of yours.”
It took a moment to connect the two. To realise and Draco snorted, laughed, at the misunderstanding already. “Yeah, sometimes.”
Mumbling and mutterings from the next room told Draco at least he had time to dawdle and not rush. So, Malfoy took his time to feel better, to have the knots in his muscles and tension in his head ease with the water. Only when he was certain he could waltz back out, without pausing and alerting Scorpius to his weakness did Draco leave the bathroom. At least it was normal behaviour for him to return immediately to bed.
He’d adopted a complete goofball and he loved it already.
And if Moran was going to come here and try to kill him - probably after the Rings of Celius did their job and Draco was then disposable - then Harry couldn’t be here. Not anymore, not while he was ill and weaker than normal.
Firewhiskey.” If not for Potter he’d be having a good day.
Draco’s legs dangled off the desk and he had to wonder how his life had culminated to this point. Being in an Auror office, through choice. Wonders never ceased.
“--The radial artery, as low down in your arm as we can manage it. I’ll be adding a tourniquet to make sure you don’t bleed out. You’ll have to be awake to take any Blood-Replenishing Potions, any other questions?”
“Yeah? And why’s that?”
“But I did.” Harry curled into himself, started back picking at the curtain.
“The roots will find the earth, just use the bloody thing--” The marble was shredded more and more until Draco was scared that the whole Manor was going to fall; he was glad Scorpius was not here to see this, “--Before you destroy everything!”
“Had to do something before we head.”
“Alchemy is an extension of brewing and transformigation. It changed everything.” Harry looked up, good. Finally. “You said you used it. How? How did you use it? If you did.” In the stories, the Philosopher Stone was the reddest red, gleaming and pure. Some claimed it wrong. Some tried to
The rage was real on his part, Blaise always implosive with anger. Never too easy to rile him to that point, never a task Theo or Draco did on their owns in Hogwarts. Draco closed his eyes. He wanted to say he believed Blaise, to say he could forget instead of forgive – because did he need forgiveness? Did his father ever utter an apology to the horrors he claimed to have committed under spell?
“And the hovering one?”
Maybe he’d realised then he didn't have all the facts. How he’d been tricked and manipulated by his own children to argue their innocence. “Wait--”
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Draco,
Right.
How long did Draco strain the bluster eel’s guts or how long did he spend on finely cutting ingredients the same size, weight and shape. Too long, said his neck and shoulders, his back and wrists. Not long enough, said himself. Potter might very well be fighting for his life, his magic. A few nights of no rest paled in comparison.
“Don’t take too long.” Whirling round, finally Harry looked at him. “What?” Why did that garner such a strong reaction?
“Good. Scorpius, all forgiven?”
Broken, that’s what Potter was. Why the Aurors had no need for their superior, why the magic with Scorpius was even possible. No one needed to look at his face to hear that Potter knew it too. Hermione did what no Slytherin would have done, she repaired, replaced and put back everything without a word passing between her or Potter. She was the only one talking for an eternity, speaking her incantations clearly and efficient. Harry didn’t appear to do anything but sulk against a wall and Draco had a thought to slap the moron on the back of the head and tell him it’s his anger that does this bullshit more than not. Sadness had a way of cracking, crinkling and shattering items but this--
Family was always so simple and complicated, his mother had said once. Draco agreed and hadn't a clue if he should revel in Albus' actions or not (he wanted to).
“You two are new at the dating scene, right? Am I right? Both of you sat here, and you on your phone and he was blabbing away-- you don’t have a connection love, try someone else.”
Fuck.
“Speak for yourself,”  Draco snorted, took another swig of this disgusting beverage. Looking around again he saw the three doors off to other areas of the house - who knew how big this place was - and the Floo hidden off in the corner. It wasn’t decorated by Harry; he’d seen that hovel of a place.
“So, I asked Hermione about Casting Trees.” Harry sounded too proud of himself for asking a friend a question, so Draco just stared, willing he’d elaborate and that his eyes would stop burning. Harry didn’t do well under unwarranted attention and he glanced around the Manor but Draco didn’t stop.
“How is that even a--”
“Nott will vote in his best interest, I’ve no doubt.” Draco would send another letter to reinforce such an ideal.
Draco would bite the child if it meant he wasn’t sold to someone who looked as if he wouldn't get five minutes alone. All he needed was to transform back, before he’d been ‘rescued’ he hadn’t done much in his owl form but eat and sleep. But if he was too aggressive, he doubted he would be bought. Too child-friendly and Sticky-Fingers were waiting for him.
“Beaten by a Gryffindor, this is ridiculous. Fine. I’ll buy you all a round.” He was so glad no Slytherin was close by. Losing to a Gryffindor had some connotations: ones which said very little on Draco’s ability and intellect. Slinking and pushing passed the crowd, Draco wanted to just keep walking and leave.
No, he couldn’t have this happen again. Lotty needed to be alerted and vice-versa if there was a problem with someone else. Not with two murders happening so close to each other. Whoever had killed Moran had left him in Draco’s house as a message.
Harry was used to calling out orders, that much was obvious. “Albus, you come with me. We’re destroying the rings right now. Keep your eye on Theo. Scorpius stay with your dad.” Deviating, Albus scooped up the one on the floor and nodded. Hurried his father out into the garden ‘just in case’ Nott decided against his plan on fleeing with Blaise.
“What bloody map? Neville--”
, quill.”
“I suppose you should be in on all the Malfoy secrets.” He directed at the crup and it didn’t disappoint in staring at him like it really was curious as to all his secrets. “Don’t hurt any of the animals here, understood.” Draco wasn’t sure the Manor recognised him as Head of the House when in owl form and couldn’t trust the idea the crup might see him as a chew toy if he changed without warning.
"What was he working on?"
“You take her to Mungo’s and I’ll deal with Moran and the Auror part.”
“Wait. You didn’t drink from the yellow. So, my drink was uncontaminated, right? Does that change anything? You said it to me earlier: you know you’re blushing, right?” Prodding Harry's side with his foot wasn't as funny as Harry batted him away. This definitely felt like a win for Draco.
“I’m sure I would have managed.”
“The fuck I will. She’s out.” It was the smile that made Draco wonder if he’d ever seemed so sadistically inclined. “And I’ll have the best party over telling her to go fu--” Draco wanted to laugh at how Theodore was trying to anger him. He didn’t say the term these days because it held no meaning other than a memory of how wrong he was. If Theo wanted to say it till he was grey in the head, he could. It just showed how little he learned.
Luna arrived first, Seamus arrived after Draco drank his fourth FireWhiskey at that point, his glares lessened to mumbling complaints. And he drank more and more. Seamus egging him and Luna for another and another all while Neville sipped at his butterbeer.
“Not a high bar that one.”
Keen he was not to look at what Draco left for him but as he read, the more it seemed to dawn on him. “What? Collins should have had this…” And then he was fidgeting with his glasses, taking them off and cleaning them, “I’m such a shitty boss.”
“You’re pretty red,” whispered Harry, far too bloody pleased with himself.
The youthful really were a terrible curse upon themselves.
“Harry!”
“And you take offence whenever I say anything.” Harry sighed and for second, Draco thought this chat over. “Thanks for putting me on the wards, Siobhan said it would help.” That all sounded a little too much like Siobhan gave the impression she’d came up with the idea. One which Draco wouldn’t correct just yet. If Siobhan wanted credit, fine. The less Harry knew of his time near death, the better for them all. What if he didn’t realise how close he had been to dying? Would Potter retreat and curse the Malfoy name again? “I think it’s helping me sleep, actually. I haven’t slept so well in a while.”
“Tiny, little, itsy-bitsy.” For effect, he patted Harry’s head and didn’t bother to hide his sneer.
Potter opened the cage. Gilded and polished it must have cost a pretty Galleon but it wasn’t fun to be inside, with no space to fully spread his wings. Not waiting for a prompt or any order from Harry - he could try and Draco wondered if it would be too suspicious if he did the exact opposite of what Harry asked of him - he flew over to the post. Petty, certainly, Draco knew he was and having Harry order him around was not happening, owl form or not.
“You remembered everything? I thought Impervius curses meant the memory wasn’t altogether after it was dispelled.” Harry had went off and grabbed a chair from another room, confusing Draco further since yet again, he’d somehow forgotten he was a wizard capable of making a chair out of anything else.
A dating life filled with love or being cherished was a difficult road for Draco. But to the Twenty-Eight they’d snap up the chance to intertwine more favours, more money. The eventual access to the Malfoy Vault; because the Twenty-Eight never thought for just their generation but the next and the one after that and the one after that.
Squeaking as it opened, the bathroom door revealed Harry’s bright eyes - which didn’t look as if he’d been asleep at all - the hair did, as if he’d woke up two minutes before, that hadn’t changed. Draco was forever grateful for the owls ability to turn its head in such a manner as he tried again, to look as unimpressed with Harry’s interruption in his crisis as possible.
He’d laughed at him, said that of course, Potter couldn’t go a day without being the centre of attention. It hadn’t anything to do with the constant need to pull Luna away from Potter - him talking about old memories Draco had no way to add to - and it was unfair. Unfair for Potter to act as if Draco was the bad guy. All he wanted to do was see Luna, see to the this letter and nothing else. And here he sat, waiting on Luna to broach a subject Draco wasn’t sure he could handle.
Albus sat a little straighter, but didn’t raise to meet his eye. “Yes, Mr. Malfoy. I’m really sorry.”
Okay. Okay. Harry’s head lulled to the side and Draco ignored the voice in his head that said this was wrong. The leech made a squeal as if a hurt pig had entered the room. But Draco saw the way it stilled as it hovered over Harry arm. Then it started to ungulate and the teeth started to click.
A folded piece of parchment made its way onto the table and Draco recognised it. Checking Siobhan hadn’t turned around yet, Draco slipped the registry form into his nearest robe pocket. They mashed leaf after leaf, for hours in silence. Until Draco tutted loud enough for both Hermione and Siobhan to question him on it.
“What’d you mean?” If Harry hadn’t killed the good humour on his face, maybe Draco would have explained how he was terribly bored and lonely as a child. But it was the bite in those words that made Draco realise he’d assumed again, incorrect and no way to take it back. Draco was never unhappy, or wanted for anything else. He pointed and it was his, he broke it and it was replaced without a word. Harry was kept under the stairs like an unused mop.
Was he bitter? Yes. Of course he was. If Potter did have some twisted way of showing affection ruining his chance to gain more allies wasn’t cool.
Finally becoming a little calmer as she scrunched up the cloth and rubbed her face dry. “--Harry was so concerned and I could tell, I mean, of course he didn’t mean it. He was
“We aren’t okay,” Draco started off. “It might be a good idea to take a break from this. For both of us. I’m going to see to see someone to-- well, to undo the damage trusting Blaise did. We need to take a break from this.” Draco eased his hands away from Harry’s.
“Listen,” Draco was surprised how Harry did stop and actually listen. Or maybe he was shutting down and about to apparate away. In a resolute decision, Draco would drag Harry to Matthews. Absolutely. Only if he couldn’t charm or convince. “Just follow me into a room, don’t think about anything else. You can do that. You don’t need to speak, you just need to get to that room.”
“You overthink everything. I’ve been busy. Really.”
“Did he ever have to take time off work? Years ago, I mean, before all these problems, before the potions.”
What?
“Potter, there you are! I’m sorry to let you know you were right, we’ve been totally shagging – might want to cover your ears there, Scorp.”
A hurricane, loud and whirling and disorienting yelled out: Idiot. Idiot. Idiot. Awful thing to say. How could I say that? I didn’t mean it. I didn’t. It was better than a cupboard. He had food. That’s all I meant. He wasn’t--
“Just a few healing spells, nothin’ fancy.” Mary answered but didn’t pick up the quill.
Right. Because Draco was so serious about it. But Wilks believed it, no doubt about it. No doubt that the mistake Draco made when he was a kid was still fucking following him. Branded forever, despite the scars silver and barely recognisable, it only took a word for the world to remember. Remember how he’d fucked up and let Hogwarts be overrun - his home away from home - and all in a name he didn’t believe in. And he stood there, rejection never stung these days and he shut up his emotions as fast as he could. An easy way to stop tear ducts was to push his tongue to the roof of his mouth until it hurt.
“Did Harry really fight alongside my father?” Draco wasn’t sure if Ron was being hyperbolic or not. It hurt his head to try to imagine that one.
“He’s a fussy eater, he wouldn’t be doing this if it’s just mice. It’s something else. Leave him be.” Someone else tried to distract him with a cut of jerky. Harry’s voice was enough to stop all that. “That’s an order. Get out of his way.” It made it easier to track, that the humans that were doing their writing stopped and moved out of his way, the others that tried to grab onto him, began to back away.
Draco shushed him, letting his brain catch up and for his body not to feel so sensitive and vulnerable. Where Harry had scratched, he traced with his fingers, they nipped pleasantly against the film of sweat on his skin.
“If Harry does get better will you--”
“A tank.”
“Extended family, Teddy probably would claim it.” He had seen his cousin once or twice, in passing but they’d never formally been introduced. Supposedly, he guessed it was his mother and her sister’s plan for them never to meet. Whatever their reasoning, Draco didn’t interfere.
The announcement of making sure the harness was fastened and having a Muggle roughhouse it hiked the adrenaline up. What if it wasn’t? Was he going to die? What safety precautions did Muggles really have to save someone falling out of this-- clinking of metal underneath him made him freeze. And slow, the ascend into the sky. Dragons shouldn’t be made of segmented metal.
“You must be hungry. I haven’t seen you eat anything.”
Draco didn't understand the question. Harry looked at him, same expression on his face. Harry had done more the last year for Draco than, well, than he believed Pansy or Goyle and Crabbe had. Blaise had fled. Defeating Voldemort? Good and all but getting him out of a life sentence? Draco still didn't really get it. But whatever Harry's little moral compass said, he wouldn't argue.
Draco paced around the house intermittently taking tea. No. A waste of time, a waste of precious time. He headed downstairs to the lab. Not too gloomy these days considering Albus made his way here between boughs of inspiration. Some of his potions and attempts lay strewn around, messy as ever.
“I’m fine.” Harry always struggled against it – always against something. The man didn’t seem capable of having an easy life, making everything a bit too complicated to only create further complexes further on for everyone else.
“Potter’s words were, ‘he was all over you’.”
His head hung low, without an easy excuse waiting in the wings to flee from this embarrassment, he couldn’t look at Harry anymore. What was he doing? Forget Jasmine, this was far more awkward, more damaging. Another rejection by Potter, bloody pest.
“And what do you think my son can manage?”
Siobhan stood at the ready at the end of the table where Harry’s hand lay palm-up, potion and wand and ready to act. Charlie was to the left and Draco the opposite side and eager to look anywhere other than that disgusting creature, he ended up looking at Harry’s arm. Right. Holding Harry’s arm down like this as a parasite to one of the most deadly creatures made its way closer. They were all ready. Right? He tightened his hold before the scale leech even came into contact. Oh, he wasn’t sure he could do this. Was Potter really going to die now? Luck running out in Malfoy Manor, that was tragic.
Draco shook his head. Someone tried to give him their phone number and Draco panicked out the door with Neville making excuses.
“Bit dramatic.”
Ever the mature one, she ignored the spite and took to the task of doing what needed to be done. Draco made sure not to make a sound, not to move and not to blink in case he missed Hermione’s reaction. What if she knew exactly what this was? How soon could Draco go home? She turned the parchment around in her hands, holding it at different angles and ignoring Potter’s attempt at sulking.
Harry thankfully had arisen, wandering the Manor and having Lotty chatter to him.
“Is that so.” Did it make sense for Blaise to return to the Manor after he’d left with Scorpius? Unless he did see someone and ushered an oblivious Scorpius away before returning, forcing himself into the Manor in search of what he’d seen.
Harry ruined everything.
Luna was one of the few who Draco held any real affection for - Hermione had his respect and impressed him nearly each week - but it was Luna’s forgiveness that had done more in helping Draco pick up the pieces of what he wanted himself to be, of the man he could be. If not for Luna’s reply, Draco wouldn’t have bothered to have sent letters to everyone who deserved an apology. Unlike Luna’s gracious response most returned unanswered and some unread. But her lacking in revenge, in hate for keeping her in the Manor’s dungeon was a kindness Draco hadn’t felt or would feel for years after.
Huffing to himself, he mock glared at Harry. “This is ridiculous -- I don’t know how you’ve managed it -- I’m actually anxious.”
They returned to the potions which were still going strong.  Draco also conjured a mirror right there and then and showed Harry’s his face. He slipped it towards him, this little ornate mirror and Harry’s eyes may as well have fallen from their sockets.
“And? He started it by saying my son should expect abuse because he’s a bad kid. Idiot doesn’t even know him--”
“Don’t be difficult. Just go.” Draco was glad Blaise rose from his seat then and perhaps, his sudden unconsciousness was a factor in moving him. Guilt was the greatest motivator for Blaise, just before galleons.
It was signed by a Emit Renrüt, a name unfamiliar at first until Draco read the whole thing through again. He always did have a flair for dramatics. The more he read the more the parchment crinkled in his hands. He took no enjoyment from burning it to ash and he left the Leaky Cauldron with a still, silent rage unlike anything he’d felt before. Whatever drink he’d ordered, he left untouched and abandoned. The note was correct, Draco Malfoy would not fight but he could plan and scheme because as much as he wasn’t a snake, he was a Slytherin. And now he knew what he had to do.
The deep breath tingled his lungs and Draco coughed it away.
What? Was he serious?
“That does explain why a corpse ended up in my house.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“...He’s mine?”
The voting hall was similar to the dreaded court system. Circles of chairs and tables around the centre, which in it sat a large box, bolted to the floor. Harry and Draco picked two free chairs and wondered if someone was going to attack the very hall.
Almost as soon as Harry had sat down and pushed the near empty notepad off to a drawer so no one could see it, a knock at the door had Draco unsettled. Who was it now?
“What?” Harry perked up.
Luna was a terror, not choosing emotions but simple expressions. “I’ll make him scrunch his nose!” Whether it was as unconventional as her or not, it netted the table another two rounds of drinks. Draco by this point was no longer concerned over Harry’s closeness with his wife. Too warm, too fuzzy to really be mad at anything, Draco ended up following Seamus and resting on the table too. Harry wasn’t paying him any attention now. That made winning a bit more difficult.
“I am finished--” Draco said as petulant as he could muster. And Draco watched Harry take a bite out of the sandwich in his hand and bristled.
“Would Theo really do all this because of one insult at a party?”
“Astoria.”
That’s that. What a terrible philosophy in life. Potter was still weak and out of everyone, Siobhan - or whoever this bloody woman was - was one of the few who knew it. Draco couldn’t also then hand her his secret of being an animagus. What did Harry mean, that was that. Bloody Merlin, how could Harry be so on point at times and so far away at others? What did he expect would happen? Draco would find her, chat and everything then be magically fine?
“Yeah, no, I just--” Harry stumbled and stuttered and it was endlessly amusing.
Quartz. He didn’t remember seeing much. But he would understand, in a weird way – instinctively or not – Draco was sure the rage which filled him would never die. If Scorpius-- “He thought I killed his son.” Ron didn’t say a word and Draco had to fight not to give him a reason, that no, he did not in fact kill Quartz’s son.
“You don’t even know Luca.” Harry still having his arms crossed, his expression a bit too dour Draco tried to pull him out of it – away from the thoughts that had bothered him all day.
Draco didn’t say a word, not after a full week of Siobhan trying once again to extract more galleons for her work. Or the second week where Harry’s walking was less newborn animal and more clumsy toddler when he walked too far. Potter was now a resident it seemed here, the guestroom renamed Harry’s Room in Draco’s head, even if he never referenced it to anyone else.
“It’s not like I haven’t spoken to him without you present before.” Blaise wasn’t a common fixture at the Manor but Draco couldn’t remember the last time Blaise had been here. So long as he wasn’t telling Scorpius nonsense and trying to bleed more galleons from the family Malfoy he was welcome. But he’d prefer to keep his son away from most people who could tell him of how much an arse he was at his age.
He sighed, remembering the house wasn’t just a building, “Lotty!” The elf reappeared, “Do me a favour and check the heirlooms, make sure none of them have ran off.”
“She’s a potential murderer too. Still I don’t get why’d she would pick a Healer with so many issues.” Harry disarmed, shoving his wand in his back pocket leaving half jutting out.
The Owlery resembled Hogwarts own, small alcoves built into the wall but instead of the cages, they were left unbarred. No one else needed the room but delivery owls and falcons so free reign ran in abundance here. The room was cleaned by Lotty exclusively and it always had a peculiar smell to it as if the fragrances were covering up something a tad musky or wet.
“Lotty is sorry, Lotty was very bad--”
It was a surprise when it was Harry standing in front of him and Draco glanced to the sides of him, Lotty was busy removing the decorations and additions to the room. “You’re bleeding.” Harry didn’t wait for an answer but grabbed at his hand and muttered, “
“You're literally the only person ever to have all three of them other than Death itself. I have to ask you.”
“Can’t manage another bite of this,” Draco huffed, not even a complete corner had been finished off.
His eye stopped on his name. Malfoy, not Draco. The silly Ls and wayward Ms were familiar; Features of Blaise’s handwriting. He rushed back, checked overleaf. All addressed to Theo and all from Blaise.
Even when the next day came, he sat in the sitting room and still didn’t understand.
"Have you seen my father lately?"
“Just in case you're slow on the uptake I am quite fond of you, really, I am.” Harry sighed through his nose, snuggled into him more. “But if you dare put those cold feet of yours on me again, I will hex you from this bed.”
“This is more like it!” Harry smiled and tentatively took Malfoy’s hand, glad when he didn’t shake his hand away.
“Yeah, yeah, all good. Just surprised me, is all.” It was a bold-faced lie and they both knew it – Harry always expected paparazzi – but Dean didn’t call him out, instead slapping him on the shoulder cheerily and turning away.
Fingers still wrapped around Harry’s wrist, they watched each other, aware of something bubbling up in the space between them, unaware just what it was.
“Did you two have sex?”
Harry raised his fists to push Ron away from him, pissed, but as he did, he took a deep breath and froze still. The scent of citrus surrounded him – Malfoy. Malfoy’s arms were wrapped tight around Harry, holding him against the warmth of his chest. Harry found himself relaxing into Malfoy’s arms, resting his forehead against his shoulder, shaking with adrenaline.
Malfoy reassured her they’d be calm and collected, and they turned to apparate to outside the forest.
Harry swore suddenly, turning away. “How long has she been here while we faffed about doing fuck all?”
Harry spotted Ron a few feet away, engaged in a lively conversation with Dean and Neville. He wished he could leave this awkward conversation and join them. He wondered if he could call Ron over or if it would be too rude.
“Is that the invitation to this year’s dinner party and ball?” Harry asked, taking it and looking more closely.
It was Harry’s turn to share an amused glance with Hermione, which Ron missed as he shoved another handful of crisps into his mouth.
Malfoy rolled his eyes.
“Obviously not, Potter – he chose to be a wizard first and a werewolf second. These werewolves willingly live in the wild, as a pack… some of them don’t even have wands.” Malfoy replied, head tilted slightly as he watched Harry, clearly tired of biting his tongue. Harry could feel the heat of his stare and was psyching himself up to explain to Malfoy why he no longer used a wand.
Harry nodded wretchedly, desperate for any source of comfort.
Harry handed over a tenner.
He was surprised to find himself so concerned with the topic – although in the past few weeks he’d been increasingly focused on it, he hadn’t really thought about love and relationships since he and Ginny had split up. It had been strange to find himself no longer with the woman he’d once thought he’d marry, but at the time he’d been so full of hope and excitement for the future that it hadn’t mattered much.
“Potter, you haven’t changed your face shape at all.” Malfoy hesitated, then gripped Harry’s chin, not ungently, twisting his face up and sideways towards him. “Here, let me do it.”
Harry groaned – he could only imagine the fervour and intensity she would bring to this case, and while he loved her to bits, he didn’t think he could handle working so closely with her on it for long.
“Both sides are slept in.”
“You’re looking distracted, Harry. Are the nargles disturbing you? I can make you a tonic, if you'd like.”
Malfoy pulled his own hand back and seemed to realise for the first time that Hermione and Ron were now both watching Harry’s face keenly, barely blinking, watching and waiting for something.
“Actually, that’s not a bad idea, we can have a look around. I’ll come with.” Malfoy followed, pulling on his cloak.
“Enjoying the party?”
“This is very new to me, letting someone in that doesn’t already know my baggage, wasn’t living through it with me. I know I’m not doing it right, but I want to.”
“I don’t mean to offend, but you have been unsuccessful so far. We ask your permission to carry on her investigation – to find and bring to justice the perpetrator of these crimes.”
“Nah, not at the moment. Connor Johnson from the Falmouth Falcons asked me out last month, but he’s not really my type.”
“Well, it’s mine. It has been for years, since the before the battle.” Harry hesitated, tried to speak, failed. He tried again.
Harry, too surprised to do anything, let him. Malfoy rested the tip of his wand against Harry’s cheek for a moment, fingers tightening on his chin momentarily before letting go. Harry’s face was now thinner and the chin was weaker, less pronounced.
“Hermione’s just in the shower, but she’ll be glad to see you when she gets out.” Ron joined Harry on the sofa, holding out a large bag of crisps. “I was just about to have a snack, want some?”
Both Harry and his partner shuddered at the thought of Dorothea Savage, who had been aptly named at birth – at perhaps seventy years old, she was the still-ruthless Head Auror that had first paired them up three years ago after several failed partnerships each. She seemed totally uncaring of Harry’s fame and Malfoy’s old reputation, and treated both of them with a barely concealed impatience for their friendly bickering and the rebellious streak that ran, mile-wide, through both of them.
“C’mon, Malfoy, let loose a little.”
“Harry!” Hermione cried out from behind him, voice shrill with shock, quickly followed by Ron’s shout.
Harry talked to Connor for a little longer, no longer desperate to get away but certainly uncomfortable, until he saw Ginny and Luna arriving. Seeing him, they called out his name. Making his excuses to Connor, he made his way towards them.
“But it’s different now – I’m not just some colleague of yours, I’m your boyfriend.”
Ron and Harry shrugged at each other, and turned to their own piles, steeling themselves. Malfoy leaned towards Harry.
“We know, Susan. We don’t blame you. But we need to know who he is so we can stop him killing anyone else.” Malfoy took over, giving Harry a warning glare as he opened his mouth to reply.
“Malfoy, in all seriousness here…” He paused. “I fancy you too.”
“Why would Dumbledore want you to sacrifice yourself? Without you the war wouldn’t have been won.”
Both thought for a moment, stillness in the midst of the chaos surrounding them as people buzzed in and out of the room.  The realisation dawned on Harry, and he covered his mouth with his hands instinctively.
Telling them about it seemed to help – she became less emotional and more factual as she talked, eventually pulling out an envelope that she said contained a list of all the times and dates she was missing.
“It’s terrifying!” Susan burst into tears, and Malfoy left his seat, knelt down beside her chair. “Sometimes I find myself just standing somewhere, no idea where I am!”
Not long after, Harry and Malfoy left Hermione and Ron’s flat, agreeing to meet work separately tomorrow and meet back together on Monday.
“Yeah. I’ve got the Invisibility Cloak, too. It’s a family heirloom, actually.” This was safer ground – people didn’t get killed over cloaks, did they? Even one-of-a-kind, magic ones, surely.
Finally Malfoy stirred, stretching his arms as he sat back up.
“Well, we’d better get going, we don’t want to be late.” Hermione held out her hands to her boys and spun them away.
He jumped out of his chair, waving a hand at his radio so a cheerful disco tune came on. He started to bop around the room, limbs flailing everywhere. He was, normally, not a terrible dancer, but he was enjoying pretending in front of Malfoy, who looked mildly horrified at Harry’s lack of coordination.
Harry looked sideways at Malfoy’s fourth glass, half finished, and fished it out of his hand, downing it himself. Malfoy, mock-outraged, jabbed him in the side and Harry shifted out of the way, smirking. Malfoy wrinkled his nose at Harry and returned to his conversation with Ron, and Harry relaxed back into the chair, realising a moment too late he’d slumped too close to Malfoy – their arms and thighs were pressed against each other. Flushing with embarrassment, Harry didn’t shy away, thinking it would be too rude, and besides, Malfoy was probably too drunk to have noticed anyway.
Harry sat across the table from Malfoy, Ron and Hermione, fists tightly clenched. He’d finally slept, although not well; he’d been in such a state after finding Cressida’s body that no-one had been willing to leave him alone, and so he hadn’t returned to his flat. Instead, he’d slept on the sofa at Hermione and Ron’s.
“That was useful, wasn’t it?” Ron barged into the room, and Malfoy blinked, looking away.
The man growled again, and then coughed, seemingly trying to clear his throat.
Harry pulled a face at him and took a long swig of his beer, still peering down at the notes.
“So what happens if someone somehow claims all three?” Malfoy mused, fascinated. He didn’t seem concerned that Harry had kept this secret for all three years of their partnership so far, or perhaps he was going to pounce once he’d learnt all he could.
He was vaguely, and probably pointlessly, hoping Malfoy would suggest Harry could stay over. He didn’t want to go back to his lonely flat.
“Is something wrong, Malfoy?” Malfoy had spoken with more animosity than he usually did, and although Harry racked his brain, he couldn’t think of anything he’d done wrong recently.
Shaking his head, he decided to pop in and visit Ron and Hermione – all their conversations lately had been about the case, and he’d missed their banter. None of them had been to last night’s Wine and Whiskey Wednesday, instead choosing to rest and relax after the successful end of their case.
“Ah, yes. She was researching a couple of things, if I remember correctly. This was a few weeks ago, love, and my memory’s not what it was.” Suzanne shook her head sadly before continuing. “She mentioned wolves, and I said to her, no wolves in this part of the world, pet, but I’m not sure she listened. And then she wanted to know about crimes in the area.”
Ron and Harry grinned at each other, amused at the memories of tiny eleven year old Hermione rushing around with books and talking a mile a minute while they waited in suspense.
The angle of the kiss was awkward, uncomfortable, and without breaking the connection of their lips Malfoy stepped backwards, bringing Harry up to stand against the balcony railing. Harry released Malfoy’s face with his uninjured hand and pulled Malfoy towards him, to stand flush against him.
“Hey, hey, don’t ruin my hair. It took more than an hour to look this perfect, you know.”
“No, Ron’s right, Harry, I’ve never seen you wear them before.”
Pansy and Blaise’s annual dinner party/ball had a different muggle theme each year, which dictated the style of food and decoration – their first, five years before, had been Masquerade. It had been followed by Circus, Disco, the four Seasons and last year had been Ocean, which had included mostly seafood, much to Ron’s disgust. The guest list varied each year, but Pansy and Blaise always invited Malfoy, Harry, Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Luna and Neville, along with other school friends and Ministry colleagues; the guest list often topped fifty people.
“And for a boy, well, we wanted to go with Harry Frederick Granger-Weasley, if that’s alright with you?” Ron asked, looking towards Harry, who felt his eyes fill with tears.
Harry woke up screaming. His mind was filled with pools of blood and cut up faces and voices howling in pain. He lay on his back, panting, crying, for a long while, trying to understand his nightmare, but only one thought kept returning – he’d just dreamt of casting the Sectumsempra curse on multiple people, and it had felt like real memories. Was it possible the Elder Wand had won? Could he be the one killing those werewolves without knowing?
“I wouldn’t worry about her; Ron’s the one you’ve got to watch for – nasty Jelly-Leg Jinx.”
Malfoy looked distinctly upset now, and he wouldn’t meet Harry’s eye.
“Four Hermans at Ilvermorny, but only two are possibilities – one is dead, and another lives in New York.”
“Remember that time she told everyone about Auror Rabnott’s filthy one night stand with the French Ministry’s ambassador?”
“Exactly. My time at Hogwarts wasn’t brilliant but at least I wasn’t at home.”
“Thanks, Hermione. Now, just so I can officially note it down, you didn’t commit any crimes against werewolves, did you?”
“What are two young wizards doing in our territory?” His voice was low and gravelly but the men were relieved he spoke without formality. Harry and Malfoy glanced at each other, and Malfoy dipped his head, allowing Harry to answer.
She agreed, and turned to leave. Just as she reached the door Malfoy spoke.
“Potter!”
“I agree. Potter and I can work tomorrow – we’ll look at matching the dates, and then try and work out who has had access to Susan.”
Connor was clearly still interested, despite being rejected by Harry several times now, and Harry couldn’t work out how he felt about that. Perhaps tonight something would come alive and he’d finally be interested back. Harry was lonely – that much was obvious to him – and even a bit jealous that all of his friends were happily in love, but was he desperate enough to find love that he’d date someone he found so boring and vanilla?
“After the war I let all the house elves go, and then I didn’t have much choice but to learn. It’s mostly spells, though.”
“I really am.” Harry replied, listening to Malfoy laughing next door, wondering if he’d finally gotten his great happiness.
“Harry’s right, ‘Mione, he obviously doesn’t have a criminal record.”
Dean held up each photo as Seamus described it – each photo was taken with care, capturing private moments between friends or lovers. One lovely photo showed Ron hugging Hermione from behind, chin resting on her bushy head, both smiling widely and laughing at what Harry knew to be himself, just out of view. Another photo, more striking, showed Harry and Malfoy stood side by side, heads bent towards each other, chatting enthusiastically, faces relaxed.
“No, Luna, don’t worry, I don’t need a tonic.” He almost retched at the thought of her anti-nargle concoctions. “I’m just thinking.”
“A higher level of perception, I suppose, or foresight.” Luna paused, thinking – often her tattoo ideas came to her without her knowing why, and she had to think to understand them, same as her client. “Also the evil eye – it was used as protection, for good luck, and it harms those who wish you evil. It felt right.”
“Of course. You’ve been a great help, Susan. Would you be able to come to our office on Monday morning to run some tests?” Harry asked.
And for a long, long time, he waited with bated breath, invisible and silent, hopefully watching each alleyway for a sign of Bellchant. They’d been unsure if he’d come as himself, or wearing someone else’s face, and Harry didn’t know how to distinguish a disguised Bellchant from an innocent muggle who had somehow gotten through Hermione’s many spells.
“I’m the only one stupid enough to ignore Hermione’s advice, that’s what it is.”
“Harry, darling, how have you been?” She leant forward and kissed each cheek. “It’s been an age, we really ought to catch up more often. But at least Draco has finally given in and brought you along!”
When Harry woke up, Malfoy wasn’t in bed. The space left by his body was still warm, thought, and Harry rolled lazily into it and closed his eyes again. Neither Harry nor Malfoy had been disturbed by nightmares.
“It’s impossible to resist.” Ron added, voice low and quiet. Hermione gripped his hand tighter.
Ron had used the stone, once, after the war, and it had been terrible. He’d wanted to speak to Fred, to say goodbye, but when Harry took back the stone Ron had become distraught, shouting and screaming and crying. He’d tried to kill himself, to join Fred, and only Hermione’s quick thinking had saved his life.
Both Harry and Malfoy started uncomfortably as Hermione spoke – Harry at Hermione’s mention of Remus Lupin, which brought a lump to his throat, and Malfoy at her casual use of Voldemort’s name. They eyed each other warily for a moment, half expecting the other to call them out, and then relaxed when neither said a word. Hermione, oblivious, continued talking.
“Yeah, she’s my cousin Cressida. We thought we’d come pay her a visit while she was in the country.” Harry smiled, and turned his eye to the menu. “I’d like a cheese and onion pasty, please.”
Harry stared down at the silver eye tattooed on his inner forearm.
“I can and I will.” Ron replied stubbornly, tips of his ears turning pink, and Harry, sensing the possibility of an argument, interrupted.
Malfoy relaxed, mock frowning across at him.
Harry wasn’t convinced – his working relationship with Malfoy was pleasant and even friendly – he thought that bringing up memories of the war would only confuse things.
“Shit.” Malfoy swore as both men twisted to watch Susan subtly.
“You didn’t tell them you were coming here?”
He’d had four years to make it homely, and he loved it – there was no true colour scheme, no themes, but everything in it was his. He’d packed it full of souvenirs he’d collected on his travels – porcelain figures, colourful rugs, ornate lamps, ancient jewellery and much more. In the first few years after they’d won the war, he’d been invited to meet key figures from every Ministry of Magic across the world, and he’d delighted in the freedom – he’d come home from every trip with a souvenir for each of his friends, and three more for himself. As heir to the Potter and Black fortunes, and with his Auror salary, he had more than enough money, and he knew it was terribly materialistic to want things, but when he stood in the doorway of his flat and saw what was entirely his own, he almost forgot about the cupboard under the stairs.
“We’ll have to look into both options.” Harry said, trying to dispel the sickening memories of casting the curse, as a small owl flew into the alley, landing at Harry’s feet. He looked around nervously, but no muggles were around to see. He knelt down and opened the note that Hermione had attached to its ankle.
“Just a moment, please, we’ll need to look at the menu first, if that’s alright.”
“There must be a pack based somewhere around here.” Harry thought aloud.
He took a few deep breaths, schooling his face into a pleasant, hopeful expression to match the mood of the evening – Dean and Seamus made a huge effort to make the event a positive, hopeful experience rather than gloomy and sentimental about the casualties of the war. Harry hated to disappoint them by showing up in a mood.
“I double checked Bellchant was safely in custody this morning, and everything is sorted. He’s headed to Azkaban tomorrow morning. Your plan was really rather good, Harry.” She continued, reaching out to pat Harry’s cheek.
At that same exact moment, back in the Ministry building in London, Hermione’s assistant submitted a report, under a fake name, reporting werewolf activity in the small town of Caster-on-Sea – one of Fenrir Greyback’s remaining acolytes had been sighted and would be retrieved later that day.
“I’ll do it. You know I’m better at transfiguration.” Harry held out his hand to stop him. He waved his hands in a complex pattern in the air, sending tiny ripples of sky-blue sparks outwards from his fingers. Both men looked down to see their robes replaced with dark jeans and a plain coloured t-shirt.
Harry laughed merrily.
Harry tumbled out of the Floo first, still unsteady on his feet even after all these years, and grumbled to himself as Malfoy stepped out behind him, ever graceful. They’d arrived in a lovely little cottage on the edge of a seaside village in the north of England. Both wizards paused to wonder aloud what Cressida Boone had been doing, seemingly hiding away in a muggle village in another country, but neither had an answer.
It was hard for Harry to see Lupin’s pale, scarred face – it was always hard for him to bring someone back and know it was temporary, which was why he only used the stone for work, and only when it was absolutely necessary. The first time had been Sirius – Harry had needed information about a criminal blood-purist relative of his, and he’d cried for hours after saying goodbye. The second time Harry had brought back Dumbledore to ask about a highly secret organisation of Dark witches, and it had been very hard for Harry to put away the stone.
“Because we don’t listen to Hermione or Pansy, obviously.”
Hopefully, somewhere nearby, Herman Bellchant was somehow receiving that very same report. They’d hypothesised that if he’d got to Susan, he’d likely gotten to several other Ministry officials, and could be counted upon to be reading every report about magical creatures.
“And whose idea was that?” Hermione’s glance was sharp and intuitive, and Harry felt it pierce right through him.
“Oh, aren’t you two a picture! What a lovely couple you make.” Suzanne seemed delighted by this scene, and Harry blushed, about to set her straight.
Ron cheered, throwing the pillow in the air, which hit Harry firmly in the face, who, laughing, cried out “Oi!”
Ron immediately reached out to whack Ginny on the head, crying out that Harry wasn’t stupid and he agreed the Cannons were the best. Harry just shook his head, smiling, refusing to get between two of his best friends, as always, and instead turned to check that Malfoy had come through the fire.
Harry laughed.
It was the use of his first name that shocked Harry into replying – he and Malfoy so rarely used their given names in this strange friendship of theirs.
“We’ve certainly got a lot to be getting on with.” Hermione agreed, following at a slower pace.
They headed quickly to where Susan was queuing to collect another glass. Harry carefully collided gently with her shoulder, immediately apologising profusely. To his confusion, she didn’t seem to recognise him as someone she’d met before, instead blushing and ducking her head when she saw who had bumped into her. He spoke to her for a moment, flashing several hand signals at Malfoy behind his back. Malfoy stepped into the conversation, distracting Susan as Harry searched for any signs of magic around her.
“Ah, yes, there was that one time two years ago.”
“It’s new protocol, Mr Umbridge – we’re to visit anyone who speaks out against werewolves or any other kind of magical non-human, just to check up.”
“I just have a few follow up questions from our chat yesterday.” Harry added.
Malfoy deliberated for a second, thinking whether to charm himself dry and leave the bathroom. He took a glance at Harry, naked and smiling in the shower, and instead stripped off and stepped into the water.
“Bit of an odd theme, isn’t it? Bit vague.”
“And it didn’t occur to you that the Prophet is wrong? They talk shit about me all the time, Malfoy.”
He felt so much rage welling up inside him at the thought of the serial killer roaming free somewhere, blood on his hands. He span in a wide circle and punched his fist into the trunk of a tree looming in the dark. The pain shot through him and, relieved at the clarity of it, he punched again.
“Ah, shit! I’d forgotten… yeah, I’ll be there.” Frowning now, Harry left Hermione’s office and headed down to his and Malfoy’s shared office, hoping Malfoy had had more success than he had.
“You’re acting like a child! What’s wrong with you?”
“Alright, Weasley, time to bugger off now.” Malfoy’s voice was free from acidity, however, and he gave Ron a parting wave as he left.
“Yes, I’d like that.” He frowned at his over-formality, but shrugged his robes off and instead pulled on a muggle jacket, watching Malfoy do the same.
“Did you just squeak, Potter?”
“I didn’t know that.” Harry blushed, but Malfoy looked unflappable as he explained.
Harry smiled and rolled his eyes – in the six years since the war had ended Neville had dated a surprisingly large number of attractive, successful witches from around the world – he chalked his success in the romance area up to karma and his early lack of luck, whereas Harry and his other friends insisted it was because he’d gotten, in Ginny’s words, ‘hot and hunky, with a healthy helping of hero’.
Luna bowed down over Harry’s left arm for what felt like hours, slowly, painstakingly carving an image into his skin with burning silver ink. He tried to think of what it might be, but Luna’s mind had always been a mystery to him. Finally, she pulled away, carefully casting a pain releasing spell and showing Harry his new tattoo.
“You’re not?” Surprised.
“You look very handsome, Harry.”
“So he’s been nuts since day one, then; doesn’t help us get him.”
“You’ll have to hold tighter than that, Rosie bear, or you’ll fall off.”
Finally, he reached out, tapped the door a couple of times. A few seconds passed, and then the door swung open, revealing a ruffled and sleepy-eyed Malfoy dressed in a large t shirt and muggle trackies.
“Teddy’s great - he’s six now. He looks a lot more like you, but he likes to dye his hair crazy colours like Tonks did. He’s very brave, and curious, and he’s so full of love. You’d be proud of him, Remus. You both would.”
Malfoy nodded.
“And don’t forget, boys, we still haven’t found Cressida Boone, yet, either.”
“Is this the only dream you’ve had like this?”
“Of course I’m fucking secretive!” Harry shouted back, slamming his hands against the table. “Do you have any idea what I went through, Malfoy? What I suffered?”
“You’re right, Harry – I do want to be involved. This seems rather serious.” She flicked through some of the papers, double checking something, and then peered over at the map, which Harry had left on the table, still shimmering with magic markings.
“I don’t know why everybody makes such a big fuss about you coming back from the dead, Potter. After all, it’s not as though you actually died, is it?” Malfoy said it like he knew the answer already, like he was expecting Harry to agree with him, like it was ridiculous that people could believe he’d died. But Harry said nothing, not sure if he wanted to let Malfoy in on this secret.
Malfoy was still distracted by the menu, and so Harry thought fast, recalling the picture of the almost middle-aged dark haired woman in the case file.
“Goodness, that’s a lovely mouthful, isn’t it?” Luna said chirpily and Hermione laughed.
“No, no! We think the victims are werewolves. Or, at least, Cressida Boone does.”
“Potter…I don’t want this to just be a fling.” Malfoy’s voice was pained, and he wouldn’t catch Harry’s eye. Understanding hit Harry like a punch to the stomach.
“No, I’d have mentioned. She never replied to my letter, and after a few days I filed her missing, after trying to contact her via Floo.”
“I don’t know…” Harry paused. “That’s a lie. I do know. I wanted to.”
Usually Malfoy was as relaxed and amused as Harry was about the out-bidding, but that didn’t seem to be the case this evening. As Harry outbid Malfoy for the fourth time over the photographs, and Malfoy’s lips turned down for a moment, Harry realised perhaps Malfoy was more emotionally invested in the photographs than he’d thought.
Harry doesn’t address a single remark his way.
Ron glances across at Malfoy, and she follows his gaze. He has one hand gripped tight round the pile of papers on his lap. The other is still holding the alert globe.
His voice sounds hopeful.
As Harry rises he tries not to look at Draco. He can still see him in his peripheral vision though. He looks ready to bolt. From the look on Draco’s face Harry imagines that if someone offered to apparate him away to a bar right this second, as Hermione had done for him, Draco would leap at the chance. But he’s trapped, on stage, with nowhere to run. Maybe Harry got the better deal here. At least he was already aware of Draco’s presence.
“That was the day before I split up with Nate. I just couldn’t do it to him, not once I realised how strong my feelings still were. It wouldn’t have been fair. The horrible thing was he didn’t even seem surprised. He was really upset, don’t get me wrong, but it felt like he’d kind of been waiting for it. And he never even knew about me and Draco. I think maybe he guessed there had once been someone else. Someone I loved.”
Draco is there to speak about Dark Artefacts, share the latest thinking on how magic is embedded into their fabric, how even when the object is removed echoes of it can still be sensed in the space that housed them. His current research is the offspring of those early scribblings in his office at Grimmauld.
"I could come with you? I mean, only if she's at the London house. I'm not going to Malfoy Manor. I love you, but not that much." She smiles as she says it, but Harry knows she means it. She has no desire to confront those demons.
doesn’t expect anything of me, the lightness of it. He knows I’m not me anymore. I wonder if he can tell that I know he isn’t who he was?
“Careful though, Ron, or you’ll end up with a whole Quidditch team!” Ginny snorted at the look of horror on both Ron and Hermione’s face.
Harry didn’t need clarification on who Malfoy meant, and he didn’t ask Malfoy to say his true name, either.
“Sorry I interrupted earlier, Harry, but we needed Draco to give his speech. He was Best Man and Man of Honour, you know.”
Last night had been the best night of his life (although Harry recognised that thought as a bit a cliché) – Malfoy had been gentle and kind and patient, and Harry had been unafraid, instead feeling the passion and intimacy of the act.
“Sit down,” Mrs. Malfoy said. She sat herself in the armchair next to the chaise and looked at him expectantly until he did as he had been told. “Draco, she is… not ideal.”
He rolled his eyes at himself when he saw that he had landed at the front gates of Godric’s Hollow. He knew that Potter was otherwise engaged and would not have been open to callers at this time, but he did not want to reenter the lair of Narcissa Malfoy. He decided a walk would be a better alternative to going home and began a leisurely stroll down the canopied road.
Suddenly, a voice called out, “Mr. Malfoy!” and Draco turned to see Mrs. Granger-Weasley walking toward him, dressed in ivory cotton dress robes, her skirts tangling behind her in the breeze.
“I did. Did you survive a day with the Weasleys?”
“I am sure you are aware that Mr. Potter is Teddy’s godfather. If something were to happen to me, Teddy would be adopted and cared for for the rest of his life. We do not need your inheritance.”
it, like a mug of warm chocolate on a cold, wet day.
Draco nodded and waited for her to leave before he took his correspondence to his bedroom. When he closed the door behind him, he dropped the other letters to the floor in haste to see Potter’s reply, and popped the seal with his fingertip.
They stood there in silence for a moment, and Draco thought he might perish from the awkwardness.
and put away his wand.
“So would I,” he said.
He peeked an eye open and realized exactly where he was: lying on top of Miss Lovegood on the chaise, muddied and half dressed, with his mother standing before them.
“Besides the obvious, you mean?” Draco responded, and Potter nodded. “I know that you lived with your muggle family, and that you had to return there during the summers for your protection.”
She responded with such a piercing stare that it would give his mother a run for her money.
“Yes, Potter, it
“Andie—”
“HARRY!”
than one night with you, Draco.” Draco turned, stunned to hear his name from Potter’s lips; a blow to his chest as sharp as a stunning spell, one that he would willingly subject himself to again and again. Potter closed his eyes and took a deep breath before opening them once more. “I want more than one night with you. I want…” He trailed off.
Draco had not, until that night, touched himself while thinking of Potter. It was not because of a lack of desire, of course. He wanted Harry Potter more than he was comfortable admitting. No, instead he had feared that his feelings were one-sided or that their first kiss had only been a one-time occurence. If he had started thinking about him in such an inappropriate manner, he had been unsure if he would have been able to stop if the attraction had not been mutual. However, now they had kissed like
Her brow arched expectantly. “Oh?”
Draco heard the meaning in Potter’s voice, knowing he had just thrown his own words back at him all of these years later. He smirked and squared his shoulders, replying, “Never, Potter,” before taking off at full speed. He heard Potter laugh behind him seconds later and Draco laughed in response, drunk on the exhilaration of flying fifty feet above the ground and competing together once again.
delivered their paper three more times that week, and it nipped food from Draco’s plate each time without fail. This particular morning it swooped in, dripped rain water all over the table, then took off with a piece of sausage firmly tucked in its beak.
“Erm,” he said in response to her strange greeting.
Draco exhaled and smiled, his heart full of elation and relief. “I was thinking forever. As my husband. If you are free.”
Draco clenched his jaw, and turned to walk toward the open window, realizing it had begun to rain outside. “Do you not want just one night with me where we forget all of these things?”
She smiled. “Mr. Malfoy?”
“Is that right?” he asked.
Had Potter had romantic inclinations toward other men, or was Draco the first? He knew that the muggle world prohibited such relationships, and he therefore wondered if Potter had been influenced by his upbringing. The Wizarding World was better in regards to same-gender relationships, but only somewhat. Oh, common people were free to be with whomever they liked, but high society, and especially purebloods, were expected to forego any such inclinations to secure heirs for the family’s legacy. Duty was always more important than following one’s heart. So while Draco had had a couple of minor dalliances at university, at some point he would have to do what was expected of him: marry a woman and have a child. His lip curled at the thought.
Draco stopped in his tracks. Harry was… stunning. Draco recognised the style of his dress as Indian, and seeing him dressed so beautifully made hunger swoop in his gut. Harry was in a long, dark green, buttoned coat that fell to his knees, which was covered in small, intricately embroidered silver snakes. He wore three strands of pearls, and a silver shawl was draped over one of his arms. His silver trousers were tapered at the ankle, and his shoes, the same color as the coat, were pointed and curled at the toe.

“Surely we are not the only home from which it steals.”
Draco nodded and said, “Just, slowly,” and then Harry was pressing inside, his cock stretching him and filling him. He cried out, and Harry paused and kissed his face, asking if he was alright.
“Perhaps we should join my mother and Mrs. Granger-Weasley in the garden?” Draco suggested, his voice thick with… with something he would rather not think about right then.
“Oh, so there was a plan?” Harry asked.
“Of course,” Miss Lovegood responded. “It is a worthy publication and the world deserves to know of your findings.”
He sighs and drops his forehead to the table.

“We saw each other actually. At a work thing, abroad. Neither of us knew the other would be there beforehand. But he took the opportunity to tell me then, rather than write.” She strokes his hair, making a pretence that it is to push some errant lock into place. He allows them both the comfort of that fiction.
sees me he stumbles to a halt, makes to turn around and leave, then hesitates.
“I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.” She’s seen Harry apologise for endangering his own life before, been on the receiving end often enough, but she’s never seen this look on his face. She’s shouted at him herself, years ago, but she’s never heard that tone in his reply.
Let there be no doubt. When I picture my life, I see you.
“I realised Nate would need an office at home.” Hermione twists her mouth, gives him an understanding look. “I hadn’t been in there since he left. Not even once. I just put a locking charm on the door and left it. Then when Nate was there and he asked I just said it was a storage room, old personal stuff I wasn’t ready to go through just yet. I think he thought it was maybe stuff of my Mum and Dad’s or Sirius’, and I didn’t disabuse him of the notion.”
It still fucks with his brain a bit that this photo existed before he had even been born. Stored away in Ministry files waiting for
“Yes. In the East Wing.” Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Why had he let his thoughts drift? He blames the wine and the warm press of Harry’s muscles against his.
“Right. I'll just go and watch my friends declare their love in public then.” The way Harry drops his forehead to Draco’s takes away some of the sting.
Hana looks between them curiously at that. She clearly knows enough to understand school wasn’t exactly a safe haven for Harry. “Oh! In a good way, or a bad way?” but she's still smiling. The details of their shared past hold little weight for her.
“Come on then.” His tone is mock resigned as he looks up and meets the watching grey eyes.
“I just couldn’t. It was like this physical reminder of how he’d touched my life. Been entwined with it. An echo of him. He’d removed every last bit of himself, but not taken a thing from me, from our life. And it broke me, Hermione. Since he'd left I’d had sex with other men in our bed, sat at the kitchen table morning after morning with Nate. I’d rearranged the living room, because I fucking hated the way Draco had it set up. And all that was fine. But seeing that, the way he’d left every single bit of our shared life behind. If he’d even taken the Holly print, or the bloody fucking umbrella it might have been better, you know? But it was like it all just washed off him, like it had never happened for him. He just stepped away and left this husk of what had been there.”
“Shit! I’ve read this wrong, haven’t I? Fuck!”

“So I took a day off work, got some cardboard boxes and unlocked the door. Figured I’d pack anything left in there away, give it a clean. Maybe get some new furniture, or move some of the stuff from other rooms in. I actually went into it feeling quite positive. It felt like a fresh start. Properly drawing a line.”
The longer and more formal written apologies had come later, by owl. To her, to Ron, to Neville, to Luna, and she can't even guess how many others. They were more carefully considered, but seemed no less truthful or remorseful for it.
“I love you.” Harry says it as if it is simple, and he doesn’t understand how Harry can seem to think that just because he saw something in him once, that they had made a fleeting connection, that that is worth sticking around for. He’s a mess. He did terrible things. He feels torn apart inside. He’s surprised it isn’t visible, blood running from the rips, like they did when Harry cut him.
He can’t believe it is true, even though those green eyes shout that it is. “You’re strong. I’m pathetic. Look at me. Sat out here crying in your garden.”
"Why isn't there someone from the DMLE here? Injuries on active duty always trigger a presence from personnel? Why couldn't they request Healer Green themselves?"
He's never felt so sure of anything. He wishes it wasn’t this situation which had forced him to see it. But he knows now it is worth it, to be the one allowed to be here, in moments like this. He pauses, hand on the door of the room, nods his head.
“The treatment she’s having right now will help with her strength, give her longer, but they still think a year at the longest. So she may move back to the Manor. At...at the end. But for now. I’ll stay there with her in London.”
The lyrics had felt stupid and overblown with their pop backing track.
“Draco?” He puts an hand on the man’s arm. It suddenly hits him. ‘
“You spoke then?” Her voice is hopeful, and he hates to crush that but he’s not going to give her false hope.
’ he is dating to get the paperwork fast tracked. Even if he has to go to the Minister herself.
Draco seems to have lost the ability to speak, so Harry continues. “At school actually. We were at Hogwarts at the same time. In the same year.”
“I was thinking that if the boys wanted to get together over the holidays, it would be our pleasure to have Scorpius. But then...you probably don’t want to be without him.”
He’s never liked it.
"What happened?"

“Malfoy.”
Draco is still silent, so it’s up to Harry again, “At school? Bad. After? I guess we got there in the end.”
It seems like there is little time to second guess herself. "Get Senior Healer Green." She has no authority here, but it is an order nonetheless. She sees the Junior Healer hesitate. She wouldn't want to be holding his wand in this situation.
“And you know approximately...ninety-nine? Yet you still tie by hand.” Harry watches Draco’s fingers deftly flick one end of the fabric over the other.
I've resurrected this due to a lovely comment on Chapter 3 the other day. I hadn't realised I had so much of Chapter 4 already written, ready for an edit.
He shakes his head at Ron, "He must have spotted something in the surveillance data. I saw him at I guess six-ish and he said he was going to go through it all, including the new reports. I went back just before nine, as I was leaving, and he was gone. I didn't have a chance to go through the documents to see what he'd noticed. But the plans for Arcadia were on the top of the pile. There were traces of recent apparation from the nearest point to his office. By the time I got there he was down. I brought him straight here, but they just pushed him straight in, started standard curse damage protocol."
Smirking, Draco strolls up behind him, voice mockingly sing-song, “Can do wandless magic like it is
’ is in a smallish meeting room on the first floor. Harry is sat at the far side of the room, chatting to Hana about whether some little known and supposedly Muggle cultural traditions can be used as a basis to start examining the nature of early magical agriculture, when Draco walks in.
He breathes out slowly. “Twice. And at first you sometimes went every day.”
“Some things are worth doing by hand, Potter.” He arches an eyebrow suggestively.
As he brings it up to his lips his voice is low. “This one goes out to all the heroes.”
Narcissa is sat on a bench at the far side, sorting through cut flowers in a basket. The garden is still rolling and verdant, although wilder than he remembers. Harry knows it is only about half the size it looks. While it does have an expansion charm on it, to make it bigger than the space it occupies, it also has charms around the perimeter extending the view beyond the actual edges. From the centre of the garden they give the impression of distant countryside, up close he knows you start to see the blur of illusion.
Teddy climbed into his lap, which was certainly not something with which Draco was acquainted. “Grandmama let me get on a broom with Uncle Harry today! It was my first time.”
as it dropped that day’s edition of
Draco squeezed his hand. “I am sorry. I did not mean—”
Harry smiled at him, and cupped Draco’s face in his hands. “I love you,” he said.
“Yes.”
“What else should I do then?” Draco asked in a low voice. The conversation and Weasley’s last move had made him nervous. He commanded his rook forward.
“A Death Eater?”
“Of course,” Potter replied. “I will call for Kreacher for tea and we can have it in the library while you explore.” Draco nodded and they returned to the house.
“No.” He paused. “How are you really?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I have never seen her,” Draco replied. “But some supposedly have.”
Kreacher then escorted Draco to the grounds where Potter was waiting with two brooms.
“I am very sorry, Mr. Malfoy,” she said. She looked down at her plate and then back to him. “I am sorry, but—”
Draco gasped before he realized that the sound was leaving his mouth, and when he did, Harry sat up and looked at him with bleary eyes. His brows furrowed in confusion.
She looked at Mrs. Malfoy. “And what are your thoughts? Do you approve of accepting the wife of a muggle back into your family?”
“Likewise. To both statements.”
“I can see very clearly why you might be tired, darling, but is that any way to speak to your mother?”
As Draco predicted, his mother was beside herself with joy.
“Delightful,” she exclaimed with a smile and headed, no doubt, toward her bureau to write a letter. “I will reach out to Mrs. Greengrass to make arrangements.”
Draco cleared his throat. “Our social calls have been pleasant. I am happy to hear that he feels the same.”
On Friday, Draco came downstairs for breakfast. He and his mother were to meet Mrs. Granger-Weasley soon at Inviting Invitations to pick out the cards for the unity ball, and Mrs. Malfoy was reviewing the final invitation list.
“Of course it is.” It was not as difficult for Draco; at least, not as much as he thought it would be. A chasm had grown between him and his father during Draco’s sixth year as he had worked to save them from the Dark Lord’s wrath. As time had gone on, he had begun to place blame on his father for getting them caught up in the Dark Lord’s tangled webs to begin with. His obsession with blood purity and lust for power had been the downfall of their family and himself. He did miss him at times, as grief was a strange companion, but he had found it easier to deal with his death than one might think.
“Use his name for good,” Mrs. Granger-Weasley interjected, giving Potter a look as if they had had this discussion before.
How much of Draco’s plan was to clear his family’s name and how much was to bring about the greater good? He pushed away those uncomfortable questions for another time.
A lurching trip by portkey and an Apparition later, they arrived at the steps of his home under the cover of darkness. If he would have been in his right mind, he would have been worried about appearing in the middle Horizont Alley, half dressed with muddied trousers while accompanying a lady with grass-stained robes. It looked as though they had just returned from a rather enthusiastic dalliance. He was not at all in his right mind, however, and instead, he stood on his doorstep waiting for Miss Lovegood to open the door while he slumped against her pitifully.
He shrugged. “The Hat almost put me in Slytherin.”
She smiled weakly. “I am so proud of you, of what you have accomplished.” She grasped his hand again. “And I do believe you about what your studies found, even if it is difficult for me to fully… accept knowing our family history and traditions.”
“As if you have not had an elf undressing you your entire life.”
“You hurt him,” she said shakily. “You used him. I asked you not to and you did.”
Potter smiled sadly. “Throwing a rug over a boulder will not hide the boulder.”
Potter fully entered the office and he looked… well, he looked quite fine, if Draco were honest with himself. He was without robes, a habit he seemed to still carry from his muggle upbringing, and his hair was still a righteous mess. But his dark green tailcoat, matching waistcoat, and cream cravat were a lovely contrast to his brown skin and made his green eyes gleam even brighter.
“Perhaps I should go home before any of the house elves awaken,” Draco said, untangling himself from Harry. “We will see if I can successfully sneak up to my bedroom without anyone noticing.”
for dinner? It seems an odd choice.”
He sighed. “Yes.”
They were edging closer to the house. “My studies have consumed most of my time the last few years. The magic of the blood is fascinating and I have greatly enjoyed working to understand it better. Otherwise, I read a great deal. And, of course, I am attempting to make amends on behalf of my family.”
Miss Lovegood’s brow furrowed as she wrote down the results in her notebook. “I have two upcoming trips, one in search of myskitus and the other for crumpled horn snorkacks. I wonder which will be unfruitful.”
“Of course not, Mr. Malfoy. My apologies.” He handed Draco the parchment and quill as requested, and Draco jotted a quick note.
He did not see Harry when he arrived; he had apparently pulled his friends together to tell them the news, and to, no doubt, deal with Weasley’s ire. Draco realised that he had essentially traded Mrs. Greengrass’s obnoxiousness with Mr. Weasley’s loathing, but it was certainly worth it to be with Harry.
“My apologies,” Draco replied. “I did not realize that you were in ownership of an estate.”
“As do you, as always.”
“Miss Lovegood,” she interrupted, “I would like to have a conversation with my son. Perhaps it is time for you to go home.”
“No, of course not. I have only ridden it once before, but it was fine.” Potter stood up and walked over to where Draco had thrown the broom to pick it up. “Oh.”
been in talks, and for a while I thought that I may one day ask for your hand in marriage. But the truth is, Miss Astoria, that my heart belongs to someone else. At first, I thought it would be an impossible match, but I have hope that that is no longer the case. And it would be unfair to both of us if I promised myself to you when I loved someone else.”
his mind replied. He buried that thought in an instant.
When his anger subsided enough to speak evenly, Draco had but one answer. “No,” he replied. “No, I have not.” He called out his play.
Draco had forgotten, for the briefest of moments, that there was a plan altogether.
He sighed and stepped toward Weasley. “Do you play, Mr. Weasley?”
Draco walked down Diagon Alley the next day to meet with Miss Lovegood for tea. As he traversed the well-worn walkway, he thought of the meeting from the previous day. It had ended well enough, though Potter had seemed distant after their
made sacrifices,” he shouted, stepping away. “We lost Father, we lost our home, we lost our standing! We are giving tremendous amounts of money to every charity in Britain!”
Draco’s hands tangled in those unruly locks and pulled his head back to bare his throat. His lips trailed to the small bit of skin uncovered by his starched collar and cravat. “Malfoy,” Potter whispered when Draco’s tongue pressed against his throat, and his hips thrust forward at the sound of Potter’s breathless plea. They both groaned at the movement, and he needed to feel Potter’s skin, he needed to be as close to him as possible.
“Yes, I slept in a cupboard under the stairs. They did not want to waste a room on me. At least not at first.” He continued. “So her touch won me over. She could have manipulated me so easily if she wanted to, but she was… kind. We made a habit of meeting as often as possible. She would often pay my aunt and uncle for my ‘labour’ and I would go to her house to read and learn all that I could. She would smear some dirt on my cheek afterward to sell our little lie and send me back home.
“You kissed! That’s why his speech was so terrible, he must have been distracted!”
“No, that’s just it.” Harry replied, wondering if he was about to sound like a madman. “Everything Susan Darling said was perfect. She was really polite – nice, actually.”
“Viktor Krum. Ron hasn’t liked him since he took Hermione to the Yule Ball, remember?”
Harry didn’t go inside to listen to Malfoy’s speech. He didn’t want to hear him cracking jokes and sounding all clever and fancy as though what had just happened meant nothing. (Harry would later find out his speech had been a terrible mess – Malfoy had stumbled through it, clearly distracted.)
“You think the Wand is controlling you?”
“Maybe they thought you were. In pain, I mean.” Malfoy finally spoke, looking at him out the corner of his eye.
“Sorry about that.”
“And Harry, mate, you’re the most eligible bachelor in the country! No, in the whole world!” Ron patted Harry’s leg. There was no answer from Harry or Neville, and Ron sat up to see both of them snoring. He climbed unsteadily to his feet, placed two small vials of Hermione’s hangover potion on the side table and stumbled through the fireplace with a final “Byeeeee”.
The next morning found Harry and his friends bent crooked over piles of parchment, tired, achy, and more than a little short-tempered. It had been a long night of fruitless research, and Harry’s argument with Malfoy loomed over them – Malfoy was still a little sour. Harry was still on edge, too, but for different reasons – he suddenly couldn’t bear the thought of Malfoy being pissed at him, and he was desperate to fix it.
Harry quickly followed, and couldn’t help the gasp that escaped him at the sight of Malfoy’s bedroom.
As they enter the lights are already dimming over the audience. The Lumos cast around the room fade down to a dull glow, just enough to see your own notes as you write. There are four people sat up on stage, chatting in the dark. The Chair, a very talented French Unspeakable that Harry has encountered in the course of his work, climbs the steps onto the stage and seems to check in with each of the speakers. She turns and gestures to the technical support at the side of the stage and the Lumos levels at the front increase to light the four invited speakers.
Hermione wrinkles her nose. “Beer. We’re in Prague, Harry. Why the hell wouldn’t I?”
Harry pulls him against his shoulder, so his head rests there. Wraps an arm around him. “How many times a week do I see a Mind Healer?”
His look is pleading, “How did I not see how much I’d been lying to myself?”
“I just couldn’t do it. Seeing everyone. I could feel my thoughts getting away from me...I just…” He can feel his heart racing in his chest as he talks. His breaths coming faster.
The Chair wraps things up, with a view to taking a few questions. The lights come up a little in the auditorium, but Harry feels safe enough tucked away at the side. If he leans back a little to hide behind the very tall wizard sat beside him, then what of it? The discussion rolls around him, audience members contributing where relevant.
Healer Green in on the weekend on the say so of a... Of you. Sir."
