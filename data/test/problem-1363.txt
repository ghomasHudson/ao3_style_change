Reaching the end of the staircase, I was presented with a small, enclosed space that shown a red trimmed door covered with licorice wooden paneling opposite from where I stood. A glass counter was settled to my right where two people stood behind. One of the people was a man who was decked out in a large black suite that covered his massive muscled frame, his torso seeming to bulge and want to escape the confines of his clothes as the cerulean hue of his eyes narrowed in on my person with a suspicious air surrounding him, his dirty blonde hair in the style of a military cut. The other person standing beside him was a female that wore peach colored lingerie material, the round of her nipples peeking through the sheer intricately designed bra and the panties in a form of a G-string. She was tall with a voluptuous amount of hazelnut brown hair, pin straight and shining as it reached the small of her waist.
Tossing my coat over the Vanity mirror desk chair next to the bathroom and throwing my shoes off next to the foot of my bed as well as my socks, I padded across the cool floor with the naked soles of my feet.
And then I found myself back in the office we were at recently with Hezian, although this time, Hezian wasn’t alone.
I scrambled my nails further into the edge of the stair above me, a shiver spiraling down my back when I felt a burning, long and large cock shove its way over the wet of my skirt, settling between the space of my arsecheeks with a harsh push that made my head whip back at the feeling of a cock persistently pushing through my skirt but not having penetrated, the line of my throat bared as I arched down into a delicate bow like shape as I rose the apex of my bum up to meet that large dick against my arse.
The thought of Harry potentially putting himself in danger by infiltrating a building filled with powerful wizards didn’t sit well with me.
.” It was as if Harry was punishing me for liking him when he spoke his confession out loud with the timbre of his gruff, tormenting words. As if him caring for me was the damnation of mine and his existence, a hatred laced in his deep rooted affection for me.
Harry’s eyes were searching the room then, my head tilted back as I watched him and the sharp of his illuminate green red gaze darken in a deep focus, his body like stone with the complete stillness he held himself with. The handsome lines of his face shuddered into that cold indifference right in front of me, leaving me shivering and confused.
“Nope.” I let my mouth pop around the word in a subtle pout lilting in the shade of my voice, turning a scarlet red at the Gryffindor’s future sexual intentions for me.
for me with the contact he’d put upon my body, making me conjure up the flicker of hope that perhaps the assassin wanted me when in accordance with the truth, he didn’t.
“Fuck you, Potter! You have no clue who I am. And you surely have no fucking right to tell me what to do! I’m sorry you’re stuck with such an awful person and I may be a tool for this mission but I am still a person and it would be nice to be treated as such. Y-You’re so fucking
And Harry tilted his head to the side, his lips tipping up into a slow cadence made up of a minute, malicious grin that made a sensation of a dip whoosh into my stomach, my head in a state of wreckage as the sanguine shade of Harry’s eyes completely captivated me.
The assassin angled his head towards one of the cabinets to my left, the glow of his jaded eyes flickering with light and shadowed shades, enticing and breathtaking. “Why don’t you grab some plates to get some food and I’ll answer your question.” Harry’s tone was laced with an emotionless drawl, causing shivers to rake down the length of my spine from being put under that cold demeanor.
I made an offronted sound in the back of my throat, ready to give the damn Slytherin girl a piece of my mind, only to be disrupted by Blaise having slammed the front door to Pansy’s dorm room open with an adrenalized huff of air.
kinds of people. I was working under a man who went out of his way to help a faction that took pleasure from killing people so they could fuck them for their own sick fantasies.
For some appalling reason, my gut dipped with a zinge of energized warmth at that sudden intruding thought, briefly rendering my freak out session immobile as I snapped my eyes back up to look for Harry in all the wreckage he created, my pulse quickening as I looked for the threatening man with a sense of thrill and dread.
“Take off that scarf.” Harry’s voice brook no argument, but there was a sense of panic from my person in the way the assassin spoken his words, low and frightening.
Students were loitering around or chatting amongst each other, some in small or large groups as they cheered each other on in doing whatever dumb shite they were doing together while others vacated to themselves with a drink or smoke in their hands. Some were watching animatedly in interest at the others’ actions around them.
“Love this fucking ass,” Harry growled out, so vehemently that it didn’t sound anywhere near human before I heard the thud of something hit the ground behind me.
Weasley looked smitten for a moment, the hard lines of his face smoothing out the tiniest bit into a contortion of ease and delight. “Yeah. That’d be nice.”
And hearing Cho Chang talk about Harry having fucked her in the past did nothing to quell my anxiety over Harry being with countless other people, let alone Chang who was his ex girlfriend. Him not telling me about it since he had said he only fucked boys after breaking up with Ginny had gotten under my skin and I couldn’t get the apprehension out from under my skin.
.” Harry let his words out through the deep rasp of his voice, the sound rigid with simmering rage and an undertone of annoyance.
I have always been a fucked up piece of shite, not just throughout the war and after, but when I was young as well.
Kikue was shrieking up at me as he tried to dig his long, pristine nails into the skin of my hand, his voice shrill with seething befuddlement as I curled my lip up in sadistic delight, reveling in the way Kikue struggled in my grip. “What the fuck is wrong with you! You psychotic bitch, let go-”
“Are you saying that I’m a munchkin because of how small I am?” I asked through a scandalous drawl of my voice.
“So you’re telling me that I can’t bring any of my stuff with me to wherever I’ll be staying at for the next few months?” My voice came out clipped and drenched in bewilderment.
I had turned so red that Sirius had started to cackle like a bumbling witch and made cooing sounds towards me just to make me turn even more crimson.
On instinct, as I reached the two men, I whipped my hand forward to grasp the mahogany strands of Kikue’s hair through the tight grip of my curling fingers and with a snicker, I immediately yanked the host’s head sideways, hard enough to hear him yelp out in pain as I felt the locks of his hair being almost ripped from the surface of his scalp with the ferocity of my tug.
Yelping out loud in the quiet of the mansion, I skittered across the marble floor with the wet, naked flesh of my feet slapping across the ground as I ran straight towards the stairs and started to jog up the steps in a panicked, reckless trek, my lungs aching now from the fast breaths I was releasing out of the part of my mouth while the ringing in my ears grew louder in terror and heated adrenaline.
damn pretty. Hell, half the guys here, whom we know aren’t gay and who are gay, would fuck you because you’re so outrageously attractive.”
I knew Hezian was scared, hell, anyone would be since Harry was the most powerful wizard to have ever existed and the assassin knew that he was making his boss uncomfortable with the clear demand Harry gave about me not having to do anything else for the facility from the way his words came out as an order rather than a statement.
I had to disregard my panic about my sick actions from the past numerous days so I could focus on getting enough power to kill Zereth.
.” I gasped out loud, my fingers opening and closing around the Gryffindor’s shirt as I shook within the bones of my body and left my mouth hanging open from the sheer pleasure I felt at the press of both our skin together.
My throat went raw as I bounced in Harry’s lap with the abrupt thrust of his hips against my arse, making me grasp onto his knees between the spread of my thighs with my flailing, twitching hands to grab ahold of something to ground me and keep me seated to prevent myself from falling flat on my face.
I’ll go. During my free class period, I’ll go up and sign the paper in the Gryffindor headquarters.” I spoke out through an eased drawl now, once again swinging my Nintendo Switch back and forth absentmindedly from my hooked fingers.
to completely engage myself beneath a filter of liquid until my limbs grew taut with immobility before Harry’s power could seep into the feverish flesh of mine.
The glow of his sea green, sangria cherry kissed shade of his eyes seemed to burn through the stygian of the hallway, reminding me of a demon peering at their target from the solace of their hell. An eerie calmness rolled off of Harry in radiating waves.
I was too stunned to move, thinking that I must have imagined the knock on my door since I never have had anyone visit me, not even Snape who at least met up with me every Thursday of every week.
There was a disturbing lightness to it that seemed to drain the very energy in the the area, my body breaking out in tremors from being in its slight presence, more so than what came into the room through the fucking door.
With a quick flourish, I turned around to rid myself of my old gloves to put on a set of new ones since my poor hands had been sweating from having been put under the latex of the gloves for a good eight hours now.
With Harry’s finger twisting inside of me and puncturing against my prostate with a constant stream of violent jabs into my arse, my ears had suddenly started to thrum from the loud, screeching keen I was emitting out of my moist, slacken mouth as I was forced onto the flat of my back, my vision going blurry with darkened colors for a few seconds before I came face to face with Harry’s breathtakingly gorgeous one.
Potter tilted his head sideways, silent in the chatter of mine and Granger’s exchange of words as he stared me down from his spot. The man didn’t even blink and I found myself touching the solid cobbled streets of
The voice was familiar, deep and having a vibrating undertone that caused my eyes to widen as if they turned into headlights, large and filled with brimming surprise.
I barely had any money to go out and do something for myself, so the only choice was to stay in, read and write and be my nerdy self for the next 48 hours or so. I didn’t mind it. I loved my books, and writing gave me an outlet for the overwhelming thoughts that festered in the back of my head every minute of the day. But what I really wanted right now, was some ice cream, and I didn’t have any money for that because rent was due tomorrow.
I thought I was out of my mind, so at times I tried to kill myself. I thought that the world didn’t need someone having so much power carry around such a screwed up cadence inside themselves. I was dangerous. And people would get hurt sooner or later from my very doing, I thought.
Potter’s matching black cargo pants lined with pockets at the sides hung off of his defined hips with every minute shift he made, black boots accompanying his attire as he stood in one spot and threw one punch after the next. I could make out his knuckles pushing against the fabric of his gloves, the material crinkling beneath the constant movement of his hands as he tightened his fists or opened them to shake the strain of his long fingers from their curled position.
As if sensing my eyes on his every move, Draco’s bright gaze shifted down after having the guts to agree with Caetia and his idea of disregarding my person to go dancing, his eyes catching my own as I let a severe command leak heavily through my stare towards the Blonde, feeling my eyes pulsating in that thrumming pain as the crimson of my gaze thickened achingly with profuse
But then hot fingers slipped their way casually into the top hem of my skirt behind me, too fast and with such an abrupt motion, that the bare of my feet stumbled about in surprise as my mouth released a wet gasp as I felt my skirt being tugged backwards and my body lilting forwards towards the wide stairs, inhumanely fast.
I watched Harry’s breaths shudder out of his mouth at hearing my words as if he had just wanted affirmation of my not hating him for something he couldn’t possibly prevent from happening.
I may not be treated like a human being at the my new job, but I did get a good work load and got a decent amount of pay for it.
Hezian looked up to the sky as if asking the heavens to give him patience or strength, being a dramatic bitch and all, the strands of his blonde locks moving about with the tired motion as he let out a sigh and waved his hand my way like I was a nuisance now. “Fine. I’ll let you go and let Harry know where you are when he’s done. I’ll give you this day free from any potion making since you already finished a task I asked of you, but just this one time.”
I had the sudden urge to stomp on Harry’s polished black oxfords in retaliation for making me suffer.
Harry eased his heated finger from out of my hole, a gushing squishing noise popping out of my pucker as I felt a trail of lube slip its way down between my bumcheeks, a filter of air caressing the enlarged aching rim of my hole, loose and gaping from the finger fucking it was put under a mere few seconds ago.
Instead of being caught by Harry’s boss in Erus’ rock T-Shirt with my black lace panties and with an array of dark magical runes taking solace on my flesh, I found myself with a pair of tight dark blue jeans that seemed to suction themselves to my bum and I’m guessing Harry’s Gryffindor sweater that was rather too big for my tiny frame. The sweater was an off-the-shoulder type to my right, displaying the sharp of lines of my collarbone and the bare of my pale flesh.
My chest felt hollowed out, the slow beating of my heart ringing in my ears as I remembered yesterday’s events. Potter always kept to himself, most of the time reserved and quiet but always watching and thinking a mile a minute from the way his jaded eyes soaked in the conversations of others, analyzing and picking apart the words so he could digest their meaning and any hidden aspects in a person’s sentences. I remember watching Potter look at others as they spoke, gaze focused and his body still, before the war broke out.
As if a spell had been broken, the relaxed set of Harry’s person had become rigid, the muscles in his abdomen tensing up and the breath playing at my ear pausing for a moment as I held my own in anticipated dread.
I knew my boyfriend was overprotective and possessive, I’ve finally learned that after a few good sessions of me screwing up and him teaching me lessons for my reckless behaviors and anyone who tried to fuck with me in general.
“No.” Harry’s words were blunt like the damn sharp edge of a knife, the brutal rigidity of his tone slicing through the tense air surrounding us with a deafening order that made my body both melt and tighten in the limbs from how monotonous the Gryddindor’s voice was, as if there was no emotion and only pure demand.
I trusted that the Assassin could take care of himself if he was just dealing with one person. And given how Harry said that it was to deal with some sort of “business” then surely he wasn’t going to get into a fight or anything similar.
Launching myself across the table, I went to reach for the bag again only to release a squeak that bubbled out of my moist mouth as I saw the table disappear from beneath me and I felt my body grow weightless, one out of the two Gryffindors using wandless magic to make the table damn well pop out of existence.
the itching need to sob and tear away at my own skin and hair from all the events that happened tonight catching up to my mental health.
“Where is Pansy anyway? She can’t even come and convince me to go to the party herself if she wants me to go so bad? And don’t use that tone with me, I’ll rip your tongue out and shove my game console down your throat so you can choke on it.” My words came out short and impatient, the slightest bit of annoyance hinting in my callous, cool tone while I stared back at Blaise in the most unnerving gaze I could muster up.
I had started to rock back against Harry’s hits, my head lolling to the side as Harry gripped my hair still and kept my neck craned back, the blurry vision of my gaze blinking dazedly up at the ceiling as Harry bit down on every piece of flesh he could get on my body, malicious and mockingly sinful in the way I thrashed beneath his ongoing assault.
I give you a chapter! Hope you guys enjoy. Next update will be next weekend or earlier depending on how the chapter goes for me. Ohhh, *rubs hands together* this is going to be good, and I'm going to enjoy making you guys curious as to what happens next, mwaha.
“Tell me what you did wrong from the past few hours.” Harry’s tone was neutral, a dead, flat sound that made my toes curl in on themselves in my boots and my fingers above my head to curve into the bottom of my sweaty palms, breath stuttering out of my lips.
Harry raised his brow, slow and deceptively calm and unnerving, as he let the back of his head softly thunk against the headboard, his gaze fixating itself down the slope of my figure and back up as he grumbled out his next response, openly assessing every nook and cranny of my body. “Oh, is that so? I do believe that if I gave you an order, you’d drop to your damn knees and stick that perky arse out for me to fuck into without any hesitation.”
The assassin already had to live with barely no friends, even when he was young I noticed, because he couldn’t bring himself to trust anyone. So having to distance himself from the two people he actually put his trust in to keep them safe must have been devastating on his mental state.
I jumped on the apex of my feet when Harry flipped his wand up into a series of rounding spirals before letting it land softly in the palm of his outstretched, awaiting hand, popping out of existence once again and leaving an empty space where his wand once was in his palm.
itself and leaving a hollowed out form of space that left me trembling in unadulterated fright and wicked warmth.
Drawing the plump of my bottom lip into the moist of my mouth so I could nibble absentmindedly on it, I chewed over the flesh as I fell into step beside Harry while we both trodded after Kevera, following his short stature through the left long golden corridor where everything lay barren except for the polished floors, walls, and steel trimmed safes with the large wheels attached to their fronts in an ominous fixture.
I keened, moistened and mingling in with a stuttering exhale of a breath from the bliss embedded gape of my mouth at the low of Harry’s command brushing featherlight over my skin, his teeth an alarming euphoric sensation over my flesh.
People knew I was gay all throughout the academy, but they had theories in thinking that I was actually asexual and I just didn’t want people to know, not that being asexual is something to be ashamed about nor was being gay either. I think others liked making up idealizations about me even though I specifically proclaimed that I liked having cock in my arse when someone asked about my sexual preferences. Perhaps the fact that I’ve only had sex at least four times in my life and haven’t been seen or heard of going out on any dates had made people assume that I was an asexual.
Hezian chuckled at my words once seeing how his own personal cum hole jerked towards me with an ugly snarl of her mouth and a clench of fists at her sides, his hand shooting to tap lightly against the girl’s stomach to stop her start at hoping to maim me.
I was jostled in the Gryffindor’s arms, his right one sliding underneath my arse with the scorch of his black stained fingers catching on the ripped seams of the fabric of my pants that shown the beginning bottom curves of my cheeks, making me gasp out in affronted heat as as I tried wriggling my bottom half about to give the man a hint to not
him.” Weasley spoke in a deep undertone of unsettled fixation, murmuring out his words all the while as he stared on at the man in a look of subtle horror.
“You can try it out on me once you’ve got something.” Harry’s voice dripped from the uptick of his enticing mouth, rising his arm up to put it behind his head, his bicep flexing with the motion and rendering me somewhat dumb at the actoin.
Please, if you have any questions or comments, ask them or write them away, and I'll do my best to answer!
, the “Chosen One”, of which I'm shamelessly grinding on, had my toes curling in on themselves, legs shaking as overwhelming heat built more into the space of my lower stomach.
I just wanted this to happen with Harry by my side so he could lessen my despair and to share this moment with him.
I used my other hand to place it against the wall in an effort to keep myself from falling sideways, my heart beating so fast that I thought it would rip itself out of my chest and onto the concrete floor beneath me.
I could be on the list to get rid of if Arte et Marte decided that I wasn’t really their problem and that they could easily kill me so I wouldn’t be a danger in giving out any information about this assassination facility or Animadverto.
The man before me seemed worn down then, even though he still held himself adamantly, he let the tire of his pain leek out of his pores just a bit for my body to break out in a shudder at the way Harry let his eyes shut and pressed his cheek more firmly into the space of my hand, letting the shaking of my fingers soothe the lines of his forehead with a caress that bordered on a velveteen stroke.
Two burly men followed on each of his sides as the crowd of weapon and physically skilled killers parted for the well dressed man, whom I assumed was their boss because the loud breaths and spewed, fighting spurred words seized to a halt as a quiet filled the large room.
Since it was nearing twelve fifteen at midnight, the time I was supposed to perform, Catia had wandered off with my cousin and Granger stood off to the side of the stage at the back to keep her eye out for any potential threat since she still was an assassin and her job of taking care of me was the first and foremost important thing to do.
It was quite a shock that Harry wasn’t fighting me tooth and nail with his stubborn streak of not listening to what I’d say to him. But now by Harry actually taking in my words and not arguing with what I’ve said, this went a long way to show that he probably had beaten himself up internally about the possibilities of having gotten to me sooner way too much and just felt the need to hear that I didn’t hate him like he hated himself for not getting to me in a shorter time.
I shook my head back and forth in an exasperated taunt in the somewhat reluctant conscious admission of my train of thoughts, the mess of my dark hair sweeping in a soft caress over the warm skin of my forehead.
With the way Draco gave out a contented little hum of a sigh from the slightest, sleep addled lilt of his lips, I
Chang just looked off to the side and glared at the wall nearest to her while Hezian watched me for a good couple of minutes with that annoyingly concentrated blue stare of his before finally answering me. “You don’t trust me?”
Draco embedded himself in my skull and stuck to the walls of my head like an addiction that became a destructive craving I couldn’t get rid of and was chewing away at the walls I built up against the boy for his safety.
I rolled my eyes towards Yevsky, keeping my gaze away from the man, Gavin, as I quickly walked passed him and into the large room, hearing the doors click shut behind me like a foreboding entrapment.
How did I not have anything to do with this?! This man, because I was sure that the guy wasn’t Kingsley with the way he acted, came into my apartment to come looking for Potter! Was everything that the pretend Auror told me was a lie? Was Javine and Trisko still alive?
Zereth pushed it's pelvis against my ass, shoving their hardened large dick disgustingly over the cleft of my bum.
I felt like I would combust at any moment, rubbing wantonly across Harry's thigh and the knowledge that this was
I whined, body shivering as I turned into a rag doll against the solid ground and the hard planes of Harry’s lean and muscular frame that pressed against my soft and supple one.
I didn't plan on hearing the guy’s words. The obvious answers he emitted were a resounding pathetic begging of the word "no".
But I felt like I was invading in on their personal time together, so with an awkward slow turn of my head, I let my gaze fall away from the couple before me, settling my eyes on the silky fabric of Pansy’s bed sheets as I went to close my fingers around the bottom hemline of my sweater and fiddled with the material there to keep myself occupied.
you. Fuckfuckfuck! And you keep secrets from me, and I have a mark on my back that you claim to have made! What the fuck is with up with that? huh?!” My words rang throughout the whole area, my breathing rapid as my body shook from where I stood and watched with exhilarated trepidation at the way Harry literally popped out of my vision and reappeared right in front of me.
And I didn’t even give two bloody fucks that the guy I kneed was groaning and grumbling profanities beneath his breath as he shifted from one foot to the next to try and alleviate the pain I caused him, no, I simply swept around his large frame and headed straight for Harry and Kikue.
But my skirt was still on me, except it was no longer wet and the garter belts were nowhere to be seen on my person nor around me..
Oh, but he was the devil himself. Or better yet, maybe Harry was the man behind the devil’s fall. I believe that Harry must have told Lucifer to follow his damn intuition like the conniving sinister bastard that he was just so he could shake the heavens and make chaos, acting all high and mighty because he’s the Chosen One and getting everything he wanted from everyone with a simple look, acting like a good man when in reality he was down right evil and enjoyed creating disaster. He was brutal in his apex severity.
Potter ignored my words, and instead, twisted his head sideways, tilting it to the side in wicked salaciousness, the tendrils of his hair falling into the glow of his emerald eyes as those lips of his were dead set into a straight line. He let his left elbow settle on his bent knee as he let the bloodied knife slip through the quick play of his long fingers, flicking it around with each one. “You act like you’re disgusted by my licking blood off of a knife, but you’re not. Your pupils are dilated, the skin on your cheeks have grown into a flush of pink petaled colors while your breaths have gotten significantly faster and that cock of yours is pressing insistently against that ridiculously short shirt.” Potter talked with a low drone of a voice, without any care as he spoke in a deep murmur to me.
“Let go”. I hissed out my words with a monotonous drawl, loud enough to be heard over the bass of the music but not to the point where others could hear the simmering anger and distress I felt at having someone I didn’t know
My teeth released the plump of my lip, the veins beneath my skin pumping viciously as my ears rang with a heady thrum that made my body tingle in the wake of Potter’s eyes.
My hair reminded me of white pastel paint. The cream colored locks went from pin straight to crazy waves whenever it wanted to. Mother used to say that my hair looked like snow. The silver strands made veryone openly stare at me like I had more than one head.
I tore my gaze away from my surroundings and focused on the redhead, giving her a shy smile as she watched me with a raise of her brows in bemusement.
Nodding my gratitude rather lazily towards the girl, I waved towards both Pansy and Blaise as I shouted my goodbye to them while I was already starting towards my destination. “I’ll be back, lovelies!”
Weasley was inside the kitchen getting some dinner ready so he had left Granger and me to hang out together.
My mind felt obscured, a fever that traced its way through every vessel of my thrumming brain as an inflamed pitch black sensation started to crawl its way into my mind and scratch away at the walls of my sanity, desire burning the tips of my fingers that peered into the soft, porcelain pale flesh of the blonde’s pretty thighs beneath me, branding him with my touch as a morbid fascination filtered in the observant warmed glowing gaze of my eyes that traced every wet trail of Draco’s aroused exertion played out lovingly over the slim of his limbs.
It seemed things would be falling into place again. And I didn’t mind the calmness of it all. I think I’ve about had enough of the chaos that’s happened for the past few months for the time being. And Harry, it seemed, felt the same way.
Hezian spoke through my bundle of thoughts. “The Ministry of Magic doesn’t know about Arte et Marte, so don’t think that you could come to them for help because they’ll just think you’re crazy. Andrew was found dead shortly after the murders in Astringent and the people at your work are blaming you for it, so it would be safe to be protected by us and keep a low profile. I thank you for your cooperation, Mr. Malfoy.”
My breath stuttered in my throat, cheeks burning to a high degree as I heard Krum chuckle softly. “A lot of the members like their sex partners untouched. So I think you should stay clear of the main part of the club,
My eyes practically bulged out of my head at watching the heavy sack burst apart at the seams and spew out its innards over the expanse of the concrete floor, fabric torn as the poor bag was officially rendered broken and disabled.
We worked well together on job cases, I can tell whenever Weasley was going to do something either immensely stupid or brilliant. I could understand his actions before he even brought it up simply by looking at his body language and the way his eyes expressed every little thing he thought. He was a good partner, loyal and determined and strong nonetheless. But where he strived, he lacked in other spots such as assessing problems quick enough to solve them, or how to go about events that could lead to potential danger. Wealsey rushed in like a bull. He needed to focus on conventional thinking rather than trying to alleviate problems right off the bad in case the situations grew worse.
A surge of heat fell into the space of my abdomen, harsh and abrupt as tingles spread out over my skin in increments, fire licking at my groin as an inevitable arousal filtered into my system and left me dazed at the sight before me.
I flashed a cheeky smile once the spells disorienting effect wore off of me when both Sirius and Caetia had walked out of their average sized clean and white washed living room, both their faces screwed up into looks of confusion as their puzzlement shown clearly across their faces towards seeing me in their apartment.
at the abstract realization of exactly what position I was currently in, and my display of open depraved
“H-Harry! Please don’t do this!” My exclamation was barely heard over the next rock song that started to play, “Boogeyman” by King 810. The heavy rasp of the male singer deep and foreboding as the low strum of the guitar and drums kicked in along with his words.
“I’m coming, I’m coming.” I murmured out in slight annoyance, my steps trailing up the stairs as I begrudgingly met up with Blaise and Pansy at the top.
Neville’s grip around the back of my thigh had loosened, his hand letting go of their grasp on me to leave me cold as I breathed raggedly and felt a flush of thrumming pain in the depth of my chest at having been so damn mortified at myself for having such a reaction from these two men and at the Gryffindors for doing such a thing to me.
had no sense of decorum when he licked up his cum slipping down the slippery slopes of my shaking thighs afterwards and decided to leave me filled with his juices with a conjured up pink tinted glass buttplug to hold it in.
“U-uhm … Potter?” My words were spoken through a crack in my voice, the sound high and unnerved as I chewed over the skin of my lip in my fidgety state, my eyes running up the long, toned figure of the assassin in front of me, watching with awe and thrilling visage at the way Potter’s messy hair licked at the smooth skin of his forehead and cheeks as slick strands fell into the mint emerald illuminate green of his eyes, the tendrils of garnet red seeping into the jade like entangled strings.
I looked down the hallways, taking in the numbers of the first doors I could see so I can read off of each one to see which one was closest to the number "399" to see which path I needed to go through to get to it.
The blonde’s keening turned into a siren’s wailing as I fucked him, fast, hard, and relentless as the skin across my bones started to hum in a heated pitch and my ears rang with a white noise that popped and crackled like fire eating away at the rope of a stick of dynamite ready to implode.
Then with no prevail, both Harry and I just soaked in each others’ presence and took silent comfort in the warm, calming sensation.
A rather high pitched annoying squeal left the flawless skinned Japanese slim male, the glossy stain of his lips opening wide as he reared his head up and got onto the tips of his high heel shoes and pressed the fat plump of his lips right against Harry’s right chiseled cheek, the sound of his mouth connecting against the Gryffindor’s smooth, tan skin, sloppy and ricocheting in the static abruptly combusting in my ears.
Harry drove up an incline that had the mansions putting more space between them, my gaze wandering over to central Tokyo behind us with a slight twist of my head to catch its twinkling lights and the whole view of the towering business buildings of the city.
I snickered, the sound intruding on Kingsley’s analysis. “We both know that one shot can barely do any damage to someone. And I needed alcohol because I was stressed with worrying over getting back to work in time. Like I said, my boss can vouch for me.”
Fumbling with the popped open buttons of my white long sleeved buttoned up shirt, I took my other hand to wipe it down the front and back of my thighs in an effort to straighten out the black fabric of my slacks, my coat at least covering mymost of my figure.
This time, I cut off my cousin’s words with a confused, irritated snip out of my mouth. “You still didn’t answer my question as to how you were alive. And I don’t appreciate someone I don’t know coming into my room without my permission.”
Harry settled his grip over the motorcycle handlebars, the motion causing my body to rock forward as I squeaked lightly from watching the assassin simply twist the handle and cause an immediate purring rumble to come to life within in the motorcycle beneath me, the engine starting with an uproar that made my skin break out in goosebumps.
But when I saw the whole of the kitchen, Sirius nor Caetia was awaiting for me, but the tall and lean, muscled form of Harry’s corded back shifting beneath the fabric of his mauve red short sleeve shirt met my eyes instead.
Feeling the edges of my mouth turn down, I looked around at the quiet town, neglecting my impending thoughts and finding that the brick road streets were without any other human figure.
“Draco Malfoy being here is none of your business, Cho.” Hezian spoke his words lowly towards the uptight woman staring me down as if she could set me aflame on the spot.
Keeping my head down, I walked towards Potter and Albon, tossing the envelope on the bed and quickly turning on my heel to book it out of the room with a stumble in my steps. "Lock the bloody door from then on, idiots.” I hissed out in a mumble to myself as I walked away towards the still open door.
and filthy and similar to that of a Devil’s giddiness with the slight curve forming on the side of Harry’s succulent mouth.
Sirius let out a deprecating chuckle, his eyes low lidded as he shook his head back and forth in a slow cadence, the ugly curl of his lips turning into a wince. “Most of the time you are incredibly smart that it’s rather vexing to be around you, Draco. But this one time, I want you to not follow your own head and to promise me to not get involved with someone outside of this room. I really don’t want to deal with an angry godson, especially the one and only Harry Potter.”
of Harry’s apparation spell screamed in my ears for just the briefest moment along with the sickening sensation apparating always carried with it, before I felt the weightlessness of my feet plop against solid ground once again.
My frame was like a live wire, power surging through the bubbling heat of my veins as the inside of my gut tingled with a bombing of arousal and terror. Snatching the weak limp of my hands up, I subconsciously grappled at the floor as my thighs shook on the sides of Harry’s own, my poor throbbing prick swinging to and fro in the hot air as I writhed in delirious need.
My eyes trekked up to where the flat of his soft tummy tensed and relaxed beneath the black, long sleeve top I made him wear, an inferno of heat gathering in my gut as my breaths dulled down into a low, weighted drawl in complete and utter
Just as I was about to sneer up at the man from my ragdoll position across the marble floor, the intention to hiss and yell at Harry bubbling up in my ashamed chest, the Assassin simply apparated us.
I liked praise, and I love being told what to do, but that is by someone sexually involved with me and is a partner like interest of mine. My friends and strangers were a whole other thing. They don’t tell me what to do, I make my decisions and I get all sorts of bitchy when they attempt to push me this way and that. I let it slide at times with Blaise and Pansy, but the instinctual need to snap at those who thought that they could order me around was hard to suppress at times. And at the moment, I wasn’t having any of it.
My knees buckled as if I had been kicked, mouth parting in a silent moan as Harry pushed his face further into the crevice of my ass and chuckled into the rim of my hole, tongue sluicing and filling me up as he licked his way inside of me with slow torturous flickers of the wet appendage. I whined out into the night, cheek rubbing uncomfortably against the wall of the house as I tried to catch my breaths and keep myself from turning into a literal puddle on the ground.
But then Harry let me go, making my feet settle soundly onto the earthy floor, my eyes watching the Gryffindor reach his arms up above his head. The fabric of his shirt rode up the taut line of his fit stomach to reveal the bronzed flesh of his navel and abs as well as the low rise of his jeans that hung off of the cut lines of his hip bones, the cords of his muscles in both his stomach and arms tensing with a defined prominence as his shoulder blades protruded and reminded me of a slinking predator, powerful and all contained sin.
Harry had his arms crossed over his chest, lazing about with his legs crossed over one another and his head tipped down to watch me beneath hooded lids, eyes shining a glint of blood and jade.
“Then hold still, I’m going to fuck you like the whore that you were made to be for me.” Harry spoke out again, deep and commanding as he shifted back only for a split of a second, his one hand still pushing my twisted arm into my back to keep me trapped between the table and him while his other hand went to efficiently pop the buttons of my jeans open and yank my pants and boxers down below my knees with a sharp tug.
, let me go?!” My voice came out breathy and high, breaking at the shifting tone levels as I panted against the wall in an effort to try and get away from the magic flicking heat across parts of flesh that I’ve never given any thought to that would be so
Sucking air through the abrupt clench of my clattering teeth while a heavy dose of a chill brushed over the space of my flesh and caused goosebumps to arise, I shook my head vigorously to wave off the desire to step back and away from the freezing water and take solace on the warmed sand and instead, started to break off into a frenzied run through the cave.
But the abrupt sound of knocking against Harry’s bedroom door jolted me away from the assassin in surprise as I turned my head to look towards the door and back at Harry who looked suddenly put upon from how he started to frown in dissatisfied aggravation with the way his face fell into a mask of quiet contempt.
“I-I-I… uhm, th-thank you f-for-I mean … I-f-fuck! This is n-n-not what I’m trying to sa-y …” I wanted to crawl into the nearest hole and rot there, I was so bloody embarrassed, my voice squeaking out like some sort of cracked up mouse on some weird energy drink, high and disturbingly screeched.
I was swaying back and forth, my arms skidding across the floor in my staggering, needy pace to make myself come, rubbing myself off of Harry like a cat in heat, blushing and stuttering out pleas for my pleasure to release out of me.
was going to eat me. And I had no way, in any sense of the word, any help that could get me out of here. No wand to cast my magic -
And I’m not some “precious” person. I don’t need to be shown softness. I wanted roughness, I wanted to be called a slut and something filthy, but only by someone who I liked and trusted enough to actually allow them to do such degrading things to me.
Harry waved Hezian off as he turned towards me and snatched me up from around my waist, giving me a dirty grin that made my heart stutter and distracted me enough to not yell at him when I felt the familiar sensation of the apparating spell take hold of my body.
Grimacing slightly, I did a quick walk towards the right set of staircases that led down into the Chamber, my throat constricting in on itself as I practically barreled through the large of the main club floor to jog down the set of dark staircases that would lead me into the promised land of BDSM.
I heard the vibrating, animalistic cadence of Harry’s growl reverberate within the soles of my feet and up the dip of my spine to the top of my head, the sound a deep warning that dipped itself in wicked threat and making my body spontaneously shudder as I whimpered beneath the gasping of my open mouth.
The only thing I could comprehend about the room we were in was the pitch black, floors having that same dark granite color in the Chamber and a large mattress that was blanketed with burgundy silks. My eyes weren't allowed to take in anything else since the only thing I could see was Harry’s looming frame. He pressed his pelvis against my own, his defined hips bringing the hard, long, thick line of his cock on my own.
for the pain and the pleasure and harsh journey we would have together once we collide with one another like we’ve both wanted for years. “I’m yours and you are mine. You can control your magic and I’ll make sure not to die by your hands. So please,
My head reeled from one point to the next in blurring tandems, the edges of my teeth clamping shut together and sluicing in a screeching grind as I felt the corners of my lips tip up into a deranged, malicious musing snarl, all covetous and carnivorous when my thoughts flickered like the disintegrating shadowed flames of a lit candle.
He said that Sirius just gave me a mark to make Harry mad at having his job bruised up. I wasn't going to dwell much on it even though later, I probably would.
Words were jumbling out of my mouth before I could comprehend what I was saying. “Uhm … I-I understand. Can you put me down now?” My voice came out with a shaking hitch, my body having no space or power to move from the harsh magic surrounding me.
“Ah, of course. Caetia and the others are upstairs so you can find them there. Have a nice time, Draco.” Kikue spoke politely in response to my own words, his voice airy and dream like with that pitchy like husk he carried around in his tone.
“T-T-That’s a lie. You just killed someone, I-I-” I couldn’t think straight, my mind a wreck as I couldn’t form the right words to come out of my warbling mouth, Potter’s eyes now boring holes into my very skin and eliciting my body to have an internal dilemma to recoil or spread myself out to bask in the man’s burning attention.
He let out a low hum, the rumbling of his enticing baritone shaking beneath my chest and fluttering over my lips as he clamped his teeth over the jut of my bottom lip and dragged it down with his mouth, aberrant and arduous in his bite while his tongue played with my own.
The man’s lips were set into a slight frown, the strain in the corners of his mouth visible as he leaned forward in his sitting position at the same time he tugged on my ankle with a careless flick of his wrist, dragging me bodily down the couch while he lifted my leg and let it settle over the warmth of his muscular thighs.
“If anything happens to Draco, I’l have your head on a fucking stick, Hezian,” Harry called out vehemently to his boss as his unearthly gaze looked over my head to most likely pierce into Hezian’s soul behind me.
My skin was thrumming with power, the magical traces of any dark creatures’ and demonic entity clearly showing themselves fully on my flesh now. I was a walking stick of energy, pulsating with it as if I was breathing life itself in and out of my small frame like I was some sort of energy source. Which I had basically become.
I almost choked on my own spit then, both from shock and the need to laugh my arse off at the way Hezian’s face resembled that of a summer’s sun with how red he went at the ears, face, and neck in angered disgruntlement.
I was breathing rapidly, my chest heaving up and down as Harry leaned over me to reel his thigh away from my straining pick and arse and shove it back up against my prick and arse, my breath hitching in my throat and getting caught in my chest as I spluttered about in a treble of shuddering, incoherent words.
And the assassin only confirmed my thoughts when he let the heavy lilt of his heated voice tremor it’s way into my heaving chest and leave a deep vibration there that left me bereft of air, my eyes turning up to meet Harry’s low lidded stare that displayed his focused adoration for me while his lips curled up into a brilliant smile that seemed to turn my insides into liquified gold as he spoke down to me.
I looked over at Chang from where I was seated, her statuesque stance near Hezian’s right side still as she watched me with those dark rich brown eyes of hers as she assessed me openly, waiting for me to reply.
Blinking, I let out a shaky exhale. “U-uhm … why did you and Ginny break up?” My voice came out rough and nervous as I watched Harry raise the dark of his eyebrows up before he shrugged nonchalantly.
A mewl, tiny and kittenish, bubbled up out of my working throat, lips popping open wide as my low lidded pale eyes stared up at the inclining staircases coveted in darkness and flicks of lightning spilling through the large window with the milky froth light of the opal moon splashing over the granite of the steps.
I seethed in my frustrated anger and embarrassment as well as the perplexity I fell under when it came to Harry and the events that unfolded just moments ago.
It was funny how the man didn’t exude the intimidation that Potter did. I was not as in fear of this guy as I was when Potter was around.
The bottom point of my spine erupted with a scorch suddenly, a heated burn right where that mark Harry left on me was settled as the assassin tried to embed himself to my front, giving a languid roll of his lower half against my own that had my hips stuttering and a zing of tingles cascade all over the expanse of my trembling flesh, my breaths high and wheezing as my chest heaved incredulously at the press of Harry’s cock rubbing and creating a burning friction against my aching prick.
This is the first time I’ve actually seen Harry focus on a part of my body with heat broiling in his gaze, at least, the first time that Harry is letting himself show how much attention he puts onto me.
Harry was only wearing low slung pajama trousers while I had only worn one of his black T-Shirts and some red silk boxers he had gotten me at some point when I had been sleeping.
Two bars flanks on each side of the room from my left and right, red fluorescent lights beaming down over the bartenders who catered to their customers. Some people were bare in their exposed flesh, some barely wearing any clothing and some completely in covering outfits.
Harry imitated my actions, crossing the set of his strong arms over the broad of his chest, muscles tensing and relaxing beneath the onslaught of his shirt while his watched me beneath the unruly locks of his raven colored hair that licked away at the bronze of his features enticingly, jaded eyes gleaming.
Granger had on fitted jeans and a long sleeve black top that did well to show off the small dips and curves of her dainty yet powerful figure. She was small like me but she definitely gave off the vibes of a full grown wizard woman who would beat anyone’s ass if they so much as messed with her or her family.
Despite the absolute terror invading my system all at once, I couldn’t help but glare at the demon, clenching my jaw tight as the creature raised a dark brow at me.
That’s when my ears picked up an indefinite sound of heavy pounding, similar to that of a sack being thrown onto the floor, over and over with a precise tempo like the steady thrum of my heart beat.
Weasley shook his head, raising his arm to toss it over Granger’s shoulders and tug her into his side, practically smothering her to his large frame. “This is the place they would least expect because it’s so out in the open. They would assume that it would be smart for assassins to hide in tiny, closed spaces so they wouldn’t think twice about looking in larger places. Besides, they don’t really like this area of the wizard world since the people here aren’t so nice to newcomers, so they would probably assume we wouldn’t be here either.”
” Harry’s voice was thunderous and alarming in the way he spoke, the tense of his jaw flexing in time with the rise and fall of my chest pressed against the floor.
” I hissed out my desire with a quivering voice, the need laced into my tone making the Assassin groan out in a volatile rich sound.
I rolled my eyes in response, a small smile playing at the corner of my lips as I swept the loose strands of my hair away from my face by tugging them back to rest behind my ears, the long silver locks free from the low ponytail I had put it into during school earlier today.
And when I looked back up at the second floor level of the mansion, my eyes caught, to my utter disbelief and embarrassment, a peak of stripper poles, gleaming and shimmering beneath the amethyst illumination at the far far back atop of platforms, showing just the slightest bit in my vision since I was still on the ground level of the house and couldn’t quite make out the rest of the area.
in fucking me, trapping me between him and the surface of the house. His cock was rapid and vicious as his breaths went out of control, groaning out in euphoria while he shoved his face into the space between my shoulder and neck. He pressed his forehead against the wall while he enveloped his body completely over mine, suffocating me against the wall and his body while he fucked fucked and
Harry turned right, up a spacious road that was quiet compared to the chatter and revving car engines from the main part of the city behind us. Large, flat roof coveted mansions took up at least three acres of the extensive area we drove through. Most of them were covered in tall floor to ceiling glass windows that towered high into the sky, displaying the intricate and lush furniture inside the modern, high class houses.
That’s when I noticed that I was only wearing a large, long sleeved pale purple top that dipped low at the neckline and shown off my sharp collar bones, the skin of my upper thighs exposed with no such boxers beneath.
The Assassin’s neutral set of lips tipped up the slightest bit, almost minute and too fast for me to catch but there nonetheless, which completely unnerved me because that quick grin was something akin to a lingering disturbing severity that promised a punishment that would come sooner or later in the near future for my actions.
And I let out a hushed, quiet gasp as I rolled my hips in a figure eight motion over Harry’s prick, brushing my own with his and letting out a wail of restrained pleasure that I felt was just at the tip of my bursting coming.
Chang hissed beneath her breath with strained words towards Hezian, catching my attention then. “Why the hell are you associating yourself with an ex death eater?”
someone came across my mind, I had to squash down the ache that shuddered in my gut nauseatingly and push through my plan.
I wouldn’t let myself be careless around him though. Just because someone shows their apology through their body language and expressions doesn’t mean that they mean it. I would be willing to forgive the Bulgarian but the paranoid Malfoy seeded deep within me wouldn’t allow such an easy forgiveness from my person.
My face smooshed into Harry’s pecs as he pulled me into his chest , almost suffocating me in the process. But I couldn’t care less as I opened my mouth to let out an agonized cry that seemed to shatter my vocal chords, my lips dragging over Harry’s flesh as I rubbed my face across his skin to make sure that he was real by forcing myself to
I fell right into Neville and Harry’s laps, my groin pressed firmly against the strong spread legs of Neville’s while my chest thudded against Harry’s own long muscled limbs. My body hung off of the two as I felt my heart lodge itself into my throat at the state I found myself in.
I was practically vibrating out of my skin with how much excitement and heat poured into me as the Gryffindor kept kissing me in a dirty stimulation.
Before I even realized it, my eyes were already drifting shut, a heaviness falling over me so fast that I couldn’t help but quietly squeak out indifferently as I snuggled in closer to Harry. Realizing, I think, that I was finally safe and sound and that Harry was very much real and alive and
But Zereth had clearly voiced that if I didn’t kill the man, it'd kill me. The goal was for me to take in enough energy into myself and make my dark magic get stronger so the demon could have a well fed meal of it's own.
I was in an underground sex facility that catered to the most rich. Why the hell does Krum run this sort of place? Does he have a thing for sex clubs? And what’s up with everyone creating their own businesses these days? Blaise just created his own club but it was made for more of a dancing and letting loose with some sex thrown in kind of scene. I was sure that since Krum referred to his club as a place specifically for sex, it was probably more indecent than Astringent was.
I cocked my head, taking in a deep breath as I gave the massive demon a grin that I didn’t feel one bit, my lips spreading uncomfortably.
Hence why I had to settle for jobs that tolerated me. I wanted to be both a writer and a potions maker, maybe even write a book on potion producing and how I did it to help others perfect their own crafts for their pleasures and dreams. But with my reputation, I wasn’t trusted nor wanted for that sort of help.
Hezian, with his Captain America looking self, simply just watched the exchange between Chang and I, those gleaming eyes of his mostly fixated on me with open observation that made me want to hiss at the damn man and ask him what he was staring at for so long, but I focused my attention on Chang instead.
I was also emotional, which I made sure not to show to the entirety of my work as I traipsed my way back towards the elevator and out of the building.
I got why we couldn’t apparate though, because with apparition, you left traces of magic and since the physical body of the person that used the spell had been teleported to another area, they couldn’t mask the magic they left behind in casting the chant since they weren't physically there do so, and so the Carbonous would immediately pick up on the magical residue, hunt down its owner and kill them.
Harry spoke around a dirty grin right when I was about to reach him, voice low and rumbling in his chest like a thunderous roil in a chaotic storm. “Feisty little thing you are.”
I felt heat crawl up my neck and over my cheeks then. “N-No, don’t be ridiculous. It’s just nice to know where my p-protector is wandering off to during the middle of the night.” I mumbled out my words, fast and breathy.
I scrambled to wrap my arms around the assassin’s strong shoulders, clawing my fingers into Harry’s naked muscled back as I went to look down at him.
My words failed to finish my statement. I was making sure to keep my gaze stuck to my plate of food and not over to Harry’s direction, flustered and mortified at the heady sensation of
The Gryffindor rumbled into my throat with a severe and callous thunderous inflection, dragging the edges of his teeth away and releasing the flesh he bit into his mouth only to run the warm of his lips down the column of my throat, following the thrumming vein that went in time with the fast tempo of my heartbeat, grazing the shivering skin there as he spoke. “Your eyes are a sin. Large and innocent in the vast grey, milky opal shimmer of their colors. Begging for attention that you don't know you seek. A watery scheme that makes the pastel white of your eyes glisten, to the point that it reminds me of glass. You constantly look like a porcelain doll to me, fragile and easy to shatter. It brings out the worst in me, the most sadistic, malicious intent all intermingled with that heavy carnal craving I have for both your mind and body. And that fucking hair of yours, long and unruly with its snow kissed strands so pale that it could be mistaken for an opal’s crystalline illuminance and tainted by nothing dark but light, makes me want to cover it in my own cum, especially over that pert, aristocratic and pixie like face of yours.”
Tossing on a teal blue long sleeved top that dipped at my neckline, I found a thin scarf the same color of my shirt and immediately wrapped it loosely around the circumference of my burning neck.
I enjoyed having Harry between my open legs, lying on the flat line of his back on the bed with the smooth tufts of his dark hair ruffled about across the expanse of my naked thigh where he rested his head over.
The smoke created a cascade of swindling curves and swirls above both our heads, twisting and turning from one point to the next as the silver, shadowed smoke dispersed into a faded out cloud and fogged the space above, weaving up into the high ceiling.
Granger nodded with a splitting smile and turned her brown gaze towards me as she pointed to the six bags on the floor. “I went out to get you some clothes. You don’t need to pay me back, but I do still want to go shopping with you tomorrow. Harry should be here in a few hours so just get settled in.”
The one thing that kept me from crying out of fear was surprisingly the sound of the tar like substance dripping away from the tip of the creature’s obsidian horns, my gaze and ears honing in on the sight and sound as I did my best to contain whatever semblance of cool I could muster up.
I whined high in my throat, the sound ripping from my mouth as I took my other hand to lay it flat against Potter’s right muscled pec to push him away from me. But my effort was for naught and the man was like a fucking boulder with the way he didn’t even stumble from my shove, my gaze wavering at the amount of rolling heat and hardness coming from the assassin’s skin and chest.
hell, I’ll be showing e-everything. Change me out of these clothes and perhaps we could find another-r way to get a ride.”
Ron was already working on trying to find any of Draco’s magical traces, the almost frantic swishes of his wand to navigate the spell around the room repeatedly causing him to look like a crazy git.
The wizard world loved their Sundays with a heavy dose of laziness. Work never was allowed on a this particular day of the week.
Granger and Weasley were shooting off pistol after pistol, their hand occupied by their handguns as Carbonous kept rushing towards them with those shrill, animalistic sounds, snapping their mouth continuously as they ate at the malicious air and searched for the two wizard assassins.
“Don’t put yourself in danger, brat. I told you that before, being mouthy to a man eating creature can get you killed.”  Harry responded to my panicked words, voice grumbling with a hint of a sinister cadence.
There are times where I’d blink rapidly wherever my body has collapsed in on itself and I would stare blankly at the floor on the scrape of my shins. It is there that my breaths would solidify between clutters and cruelty that I couldn’t help but give myself into.
I wriggled against the hold of Harry’s harsh magic on me, not feeling myself budge from the press of the wall and the air in my lungs choking me as I felt myself grow hot.
But I was elated with the fact that I was the first to ever see where Harry lived now and that the assassin didn’t have to deal with his family again.
Sucking in a sharp breath, I gave am immediate nod in Harry’s direction, my assent sharp and nervous as I attempted to let the fast rhythm of my hyperactive heart slow down into a settled pulsate, trying to get myself to stop the violent tremors in my hands and legs as I fixed my gaze onto the assassin’s, finding the determined tethered darkness in Harry’s eyes a calming effect.
When I saw myself standing upright on wobbling legs in Harry’s living room, the Gryffindor leaning against the wall nearest to my right with an unperturbed air about him, I snapped.
of the assassin staring down at me that filtered in with the heated warmth mingling together with the ball of anxiety in my chest. The fact that I was in a situation that could very much potentially have my body ending up rotting and without any soul made me want to crawl away to the nearest hole and bury myself there so I could keep myself away from the barrage of emotions and chaotic dark wanting bubbling beneath my skin.
The release was a white hot blinding sensation, making my head shake back and forth in unbelievably overbearing euphoria as the back of my head cracked against the floor beneath me while my back arched like it was in a shape of a bridge.
The Gryffindor made me press my head further into the side of my bed when he all but shoved his covered cock at the open part of my mouth, my throat releasing a small broken whimper when the flesh of my bottom lip brushed featherlight at the zipper of Potter’s jeans. My eyes got even larger at the sound I just emitted, my cock throbbing beneath my sleep shirt as my stomach dipped with an inferno of heat at the musk I smelled from Potter’s cock, feeling my mouth barely caress the fabric that covered his prick.
Potter towered over me now, breathing levelled with an eerie calmness as he stepped up and gave away a blank stare towards the angry vampire, lips pressed into a thin line of cruel tranquility that had me shivering on the spot, his voice monotonous and cold as the vampire’s body was. “Get lost.”
I shook my head as I gave the assassin a sad smile, my bottom lip quivering in the face of my emotions from having to see Harry look so defeated and angered at himself for not having come for me sooner.
Harry chuckled lowly at Hezian’s open excitement towards my accomplishment, causing my attention to slide back over to my boyfriend as he summoned the vile of the “knock-out” potion I made, the purple liquid filled enclosed tube flickering into existence in Harry’s right hand.
Letting out a shaky breath, my fingers flinched from where they draped around the chain connected to the cuffs, my nerves trembling inside of my chest as I talked around a dry mouth, my words mystifying in the cool air.
“This is so good, Harry.” I moaned happily around the chewing of my food, swinging my feet back and forth from where I sat perched on top of the marble kitchen counter near the oven and stove where the Gryffindor stood flipping crispy bacon and sausages with a spatula in his hand over a frying pan.
The demon’s blood was pure black, the darkness of his spilled wounds encasing the cemented floor becoming a sharp contrast between the brightness of the room. Spots of his blood sprayed gruesomely across Draco’s front torso and the tops of his thighs that straddled the demons’ hips.
I was mad at Harry. And I was mad at myself for my actions for my anger towards him and the wizarding world. I was being a needy little shite and I was both ashamed yet taking immense happiness in it.
Harry stared down at me, a smoky film crossing over the green and red hue of his eyes. His head tilted down to watch me on my knees for him with that same staggering calm that crossed his features and left me light headed at the way his presence pressured down onto my frame and around my rising goose flesh.
Dread, cold and panicked, washed over the flesh of my taut body as I felt a sense of unease fall into my gut and gather like an anxious ball of energy there. I decided to finish what I was saying, although this time not mentioning who it was that was fucking Trisko.“A guy. I don’t know who, couldn’t make out his face, honestly-” I jerked back when Kingsley let out a sneer, his features pinching into an ugly grimace as he spat at me.
And stared up at the man in front of me who had been standing near me and trying to get into my fucking pants, now back away slowly, his brows nose diving into a look of discomfort as the bright of his eyes stared over my shoulder at whom I presume was Harry.
Harry’s crimson eyes were an illuminate red in the dark of the forest as he slid that cruel and wicked gaze of his over to my figure to glance over the tensed line of my body in a slow observation, my mind fizzing out at the almost visible scorching touch of Harry’s eyes skating over the bare of my skin as his stare lingered over my shoulders, stomach, hips, the flare of my skirt over my bum and the long stretch of my legs.
Zereth’s face scrunched up in rage then, their features screwing together viciously as something harsh and sinister passed over their pinched face before they let out another roar of pain at the same time they whipped their outstretched right hand towards my head.
“Harry! Please! F-fuck me already. Shove your cock into m-m-me. Can’t wait no more-” My words were cut off by the abrupt press of Harry’s mouth against my own, my eyes snapping open wide from their low lidded haze as I felt the heated press of Harry’s lips over mine, smooth and consuming my very being as I felt the Gryffindor’s mouth pry my own open with such fine finesse.
. Do as I say.” The assassin’s voice was hard and wicked, a pure demand that pulled my insides every which way. The sound of my name dipped in the low rasp of Harry’s voice caused my head to be brought up, the collar comfortable but a sensible presence around my throat as I trailed my gaze up the length of Harry’s fitted form and let out a keening, stressed noise as I tipped my head back.
I shook my head despite my horrifying curiosity and joy at the thought of killing this man before me.
“I had to stop myself from going out of my mind with everything that’s happened. The war, gaining more dark magic that belonged to others, and dealing with being, well … me. Sirius had Caetia come to me once when he was having a panic attack over his own stresses because I grew through so much that I learned to calm myself down and learn how to handle myself. But most of the time, I wished that someone had been there for me like I had been there for others that I would see go through melt downs,” Harry breathed in with a roughened draw of his breath, chest heaving up and down as he let out a heavy sigh, although elated in the way he gave away a low chuckle “Often times I hated helping others go through panic attacks when I didn’t have that help when I needed it. But with you, I don’t feel that way. It’s as if I’m sharing this mental break with you, mending it in a way that won’t fix but heal slowly. It helps me calm down knowing that I can give you comfort.”
good. Better watch out for any creatures who like pretty little blondes.” Granger spoke her comment through a pristine drawl of her words.
I couldn’t believe that I fell for the kicked-puppy look he just gave me. He went out of his way to make me jealous and get all sorts of riled up because I didn’t verbally tell him that I thought he looked so fucking good tonight that I wanted to have him on top of me and inside of me the instant I saw him in his outfit.
The magic was suddenly gone as quick as it came, leaving my body with a taunting caress over my flesh as I tried to catch my breath.
I swiped my hand out, my teeth bared as I yelled out in angered distress, my magic following my command easily as I forced it to stab into the demon’s side with a quick deadly flourish.
“Finally got you to say that I look good,” Harry grinned at me, showing off his white teeth as he gave me a dimpled smile that made me want to drop kick him into the ground with his sudden change in mood.
It wasn’t hard to do per se, but it was rather something that I preferred not to for the sole reason of having to get close to the two Gryffindors while they would stare me down and make me feel like my every action was being watched as if I was some bug under a microscope for them to observe and try to make me cower away from their attention.
With my jeans and boxers pushed down around my ankles now, they kept my legs from sporadically fumbling around in my state of euphoria. There was some part of me that loved the sensation of being forced not to move but I so badly wanted to spread my legs just to get Harry’s cock nestled deeper inside of me.
!” My head fell back, pressing it against the wall behind me as the the magic slipped its way between the spread of my thighs and caressed the curves of my bum, lightly ghosting over the jean clad hole of my arse, burning and mocking.
Although I finished my potions project this morning, I still had to edit my essay paper and make sure that all the spells playing into the assignment would cooperate and fulfill its purpose.
me about him being with the opposite sex nor with him being with another woman whom he once had gone out with and had a stupid crush on back in Hogwarts.
at the ridiculousness of the situation I was currently in, loving this feeling of stupidity and joy despite how fucking exhausted I felt.
“H-Harry? I s-swear I didn’t intend to get myself hurt tonight. I p-p-promise I won’t do it again!” My words were a constant stream of unnerved, flared questions and statements, the whole of my frame trembling from where I was roughly pressed flush between a wall and Harry’s tall, lean and muscled scorching body.
I couldn’t help the way my skin lit aflamed by the Assassin’s rough treatment, my throat bobbing along with my indefinite fearful anticipation, my breath hiccuping out of my parted mouth when I felt the unmistakable hardened cock of Harry’s press right up against my jean clad arsecheeks.
Deeming myself fit to go out into the public, I made sure to put on a pair of dark blue gloves to match my top and walked out of my apartment with a slam of my door, energy buzzing beneath my skin as I walked down the black colored metal balcony to climb down the stairs at the end of the hall. I wanted an apartment that wasn’t on ground level with the building, given the fact that I liked looking at the whole of the town from five stories high.
Weasley let out a shaky breath, his chest rising and falling with the motion as he breathed in a roughened manner and pressed his thin lips together. He tilted his head forward, letting the top long strands of his auburn hair fall over his pale smooth forehead and obscure the view of his disconcerted blue gaze that trailed cautiously back to the dead man’s body at my feet.
I've lost count of how many people I've killed. So I was filled to the brim with energy. And with determination, I was going to tear this demon apart fast enough for them not to even have time to think of retaliating.
Eyes the color of cerulean blue shimmered in the man’s gaze, reminding me an ocean’s crashing azure waves folding into its own body of water, his eyes zeroing in on my stature like person as I had to hold back the need to sneer at him with the way he cocked his brow in a mocking gesture, all high and mighty in the face of my stricken confusion.
I could make out the veins in Potter’s straining, exposed arms, a light sheen of sweat covering the whole of his light bronzed skin as he flung out one first after another, a series of quick jabs that my eyes couldn’t catch from how blurring his motions were.
It’s body expanded from the inside and out, the obsidian color of its hard muscled skin tensing and stretching itself until the flesh ripped apart from each other and splurged in every direction it could find, the black of its insides being thrown haphazardly onto the floor and walls, it’s innards splattering and drenching all over the trembling of my form as I watched the thing turn into a string of flesh and bone.
I let out a small whimper, so soft and weak as I rolled my bottom lip into my mouth so I could bite on it in frustrated fear.
The man gave me a smile that was large, reminding me of a shark with how wide the stretch if his lips went, eyes gleaming and voice low. “Oh sweetheart. I can tell you’re someone that needs to be put over a knee and spanked until you see red in your eyes and on your body. And I’m sure you now that you are as well. A very pretty submissive bottom you are.”
There was no way I was going to feel guilty about giving snark to someone who decided that my room was some sort of open space that people could just walk in and out of as they pleased. I could allow Sirius to do such a thing because he was my cousin.
The space in front of me had flooring that had a tan brown granite coloring, the mixing colors of mahogany and blood red seeping together to create a warm shade of a polished ground. The furniture was spaced apart, lush burgundy lounge chairs and thick glass tables brought together on certain areas of the floor that each faced the walls lined with BDSM instruments such as chains, whips, floggers, ropes, and other sexual devices that could be used as a means for punishment upon a submissive's body hung from them.
Harry had looked worn out and completely disgruntled, the usually stone cold mask he held about himself torn away as a crease in his forehead slightly shown to display the amount of frowning he’s done lately, clearly worried about my physical and mental state and trying not to show it despite him being quite obvious about his distress for my health.
My head thunked back against the wall behind me, tipped back and bobbing throat exposed to the air as I gave away a silent scream, mouth agape as my legs kicked out around Harry’s hips in a frantic flail of sorts, the sudden sensation of being completely filled with one easy slide making my insides
I cried out when I heard the tear of my panties ripping at the seams in the heavy air surrounding us now, the bottom of my top being lifted up over my arse to leave me bare to the world now.
“Your voice gets higher when you lie. What were your intentions coming here?” Harry spoke in a deep murmur, voice drifting over my prone figure as I felt my teeth gnash together from how much I had grounded them against each other in the wake of my bubbling annoyance and unsettled nerves.
“You’re lying. Who’s the man that was with Trisko? Tell me, was it Potter? Huh? I bet it was. That fucking arrogant bastard, thinking that he can outsmart us. Tell me it was him!” Kingsley’s voice roared at me from his sudden close proximity, eyes huge and wild like a caged animal as his flashing eyes ran over the whole of my face with a frantic pace, searching for something that he wanted from me.
Shaking my head back and forth against the wall, I tugged against the magical binds that descended into my limbs and burrowed their way beneath my warmed flesh.
Surprise! I updated a day earlier than I said I would. Just couldn't wait to get it out there. Okay! Hope you liked this update, it's to move the plot along and get you guys riled up some more for the next chapter. Heated stuff is going to happen mixed in with anger and some questions answered. It's going to get all hot and heavy soon mwaha. The next update will be on June 5th or 6th, on Tuesday or Wednesday so please be understanding and be patient for the next chapter!
Rearing my head back, I felt the tendrils of my chaotic hair brush across the wet of the back of my neck and exposed, slick shoulders as the erratic searching of my wide eyes went from chasing one window to the next in hopes of finding one low enough for me to climb up towards and perhaps ease the glass door open belonging to it so I could get inside the fucking mansion.
I opted to wear a dark gray trench coat for the cool weather I knew that awaited for me outside since the season was in the middle of winter.
while my weeping cock cried out for release from all the grinding I was doing against the man’s thigh. “H-Harry!"
The tufts of my long pale hair been tugged, Harry’s right hand wrapping the strands around his wrists at least three times before he yanked my head back at the same exact moment his shoved his pelvis down onto my arse and brought my upper torso along with the pull of my head. The action had made me drop my mouth open as I gasped for air that seemed to have punched its way out of my lungs, my hands now scrambling to lay flat over the floor beneath me as my back was strained into a definite bow.
I was fumbling about with the sheets of my bed, wrapping it around my body like I was some sort of burrito, my words cutting off in my haste to cover myself up from Kingsley’s eyes that wouldn’t stop
My boss’s head was knelt down to look at the stack of manuscripts in his hands, murmuring under his breath while I stood there with my hands quivering like the pathetic, weak person that I was.
I looked anywhere but at Harry’s face in retaliation for making me practically turn into some virginal handmaid with my reaction towards the Gryffindor’s statement.
Harry Potter just called me a “Little Bird” and I wanted to either ram my foot down his throat to shut his obnoxiously gorgeous self up or let him do something to me that I would not let myself think about.
“Harry! Come here please-” I squeaked when I turned back on my heel to bump into the broad chest of the Assassin’s body, releasing a surprised breath as I stumbled slightly away from Harry’s looming figure.
And immediately, I felt the man’s big hands wrap around my hips, the blunt of his fingertips pressing into the fabric of my skirt cinched tight around my petite frame to shove me towards his figure seconds after grasping me in his hands, my vision blurring at the quick, rough movement as I felt a warmed muscular thigh slip up and drag the jean material of the man’s pants along the inner flesh of my thighs, spreading me open with such slick ease that it left me blinking rapidly up the guy who took control of me without any warning.
I could feel the harsh lines of my jaw click its muscles in a strain as I watched from where I stood in the foyer of Kikue’s house, how Draco practically ran away from me and up to the second level of the mansion.
and have all those things if you are around me, do you understand that? I’m cruel to you because it’s necessary, it’s
I was stopped from doing anything for Harry. Because of my own fear of defying my parents and my pride as a Malfoy.
I nudged Harry on the side with my elbow, jabbing him slightly as I let out an indignant huff as I turned even more red at the cheeks, voice murmuring out of my barely moving lips while I stared straight ahead. “Shut
I didn’t even get the time to walk down the aisle to my right to get to my own small cubicle before my boss, Andrew, popped out of nowhere to my right and shoved a crisp envelope into my left hand.
I visibly gulped, my Adam's apple bobbing nervously yet my stomach seemed to have a sweeping motion of heady excitement flutter about haphazardly at the same time, my magic significantly
“Y-you know what! You keep touching and teasing me, physically and mentally and I can’t-” A deeply familiar voice rang out through the turmoil of my roughened words, the sound arrogant and dripping with accented tones that was thick and rich.
I whipped my arm back, the straining of the muscles in both my triceps and biceps stretching taut within the smooth flesh of my limb as the protruding veins in my arm were prominent in the quick and harsh action.
taking up about the length and size of my three fingers connected together. The bruise was gnarly, a brush of mauve and indigo hues of colors mingling in together to show the rise of my blood beneath the pale of my neck’s flesh, the shape disconfigured and harsh in the bathroom’s lighting.
, I’m so in love with you,” I gasped out breathelssly in between my joyous laughter that had immediately been cut short as I squeaked out in astonishment from the utter
I couldn’t help the tiny open gape of my mouth as I stared back at the not-so-dead man before me, surprised and an uncomfortable awkwardness seeping into my bones.
, before I felt my upper thighs being gripped by both of the man’s hot hands to be violently shoved apart from one another some more. My widened sprawl emitted the muscles in my slim thighs to shake and scream out in agonized, desirous discomfort.
And the Ministry of Magic didn’t have the fucking balls to do anything about it. I bet they knew of the sick things Animadverto was doing but they’d have to get their own hands dirty to stop the dark arts group and that would make them look bad because they were all so adamant on making the wizard world look like a nice and happy place when in reality, it was far from it. Better to hide the ugly than to deal with it and make the citizen’s think they were safe when they really weren’t.
My back was arched into a delicate bow as my mouth popped open to emit a high whimper of surprise when I felt the familiar pair of Harry’s warm, large hands grip onto the sides of my hips and bring me down fully onto the seat, plopping my bum precariously over the leather, my whole frame shivering in the face of my anxiety at having to be on such a dangerous … machine as well as having Harry
A jabbing fixture of energy played across the expanse of my skin, the drumming of my heartbeat ricocheting off of the inner cage of my ribs at the reluctant compliance of Sirius’.
And smoke rose up from the lines of the tattoos, tendrils of heat that wound up from the marked surface of my skin and into the air around us.
Harry snickered in aquisense to his best friend’s words, letting the bag of edibles swing softly from side to side as I eyed the bag with determined annoyance.
And of course, Harry was going to ask such a simple question that I should have asked right from the start instead of making him feel the pain he held back so strongly. But maybe Harry needed this, to feel the emotions he held back so often. I know I needed to with how strongly I tried to control my own emotions.
My stream of thoughts were interrupted when I watched Potter walk over to Kingsley's prone form, bending at his knees to get into a low crouch with an easy gate and grip the end of the dagger to easily wrench it out of Kingsley’s head, blade slipping out of the wound with a slick gush of sound as more blood poured out of the gash.
The vampire’s body was was going against him. His innards were moving on their own, slipping out with a ferocious push that caused the man to spit up blood and cry a pool of red that ran down his cheeks and splattered against the cold floor.
I cried out at the pain, glaring heatedly up at the man in my rage and embarrassment as I tried tugging my wrist away from Potter’s tight, pain induced grip, the single touch of his hands on me shooting energy down my spine. He didn’t move an inch at my struggle to get out of his hold on me.
I had woken up after a few good days of resting, Harry beside me the entire time as a comforting presence. I had this inane urge to comfort the Gryffindor then. I guess it was because I had woken up to Harry staring at me with my chest pressed to his front.
I could feel my limbs suddenly go lax, all strength leaving my body as if energy was being sucked from my very pores and slipping its way towards Harry, my breaths coming out shorter as dizziness started to impede on my temples and sink its way into my very befuddled and rioting mind.
Harry Potter was going to be the death of me, mentally, not physically, well maybe a little bit of both, but dammit, this man was such a devastatingly tortured and powerful being that it was
My brain sort of short circuited in the confines of my head, throbbing with an electricity fueled energized high that made a flourish of soft cherry red spill out over my cheeks and the part of my lips opening wider into a surprised “O” as my jaw went slack at its hinges.
Fuck me and punch into me the knowledge that I only belong to you. Want you touch me, to show me all your bad.
And the damn man had that aggravating raise to his light brows that made me want to storm right the fuck up to him and slap that easy smugness right off his obnoxiously handsome face.
I watched with a pressure against my inner chest, Potter stalk his way forward, one step after another that seemed to thunder in the deafening silence of the steamed bathroom. The sharp angles of Potter's jaw and cheekbones shown with an illuminate glow, as if they was purposely reflecting the fluorescent lighting above our heads to cause my attention to veer towards the harsh lines of Potter's gorgeous, stern face. Taunting me.
Harry groaned appreciatively, muttering out a curse beneath his breath as he pressed me further into the wall before reeling his hips away and dragging the heat of his girth along the clenching walls of my asshole to leave just barely the tip of his cock resting at my rim right before shoving into me again with the ferocity of a fucking
But I wasn’t going to be rude and end up being kicked out of the Chamber simply by being a mouthy little bitch like I wanted to be and tell the guy that I’d rather lick dirt than get anywhere near him.
I watched the Gryffindor’s face contort into a look of unbidden disgusted terror as he looked down at the mess I created, growing ghostly pale at the flesh as a result. I wasn't the least bit surprised when the assassin’s body lurched to the side as Weasley vomited right beside the dead man’s head, his leftovers churning and falling in a sloppy drench of his physical showcase of nausea across the ground.
I bit down on my lip as I caught sight of Harry’s fingers flexing with small movements, his restraint in touching me obvious.
Weasley had easily grabbed a hold of one Carbonous that came barrelling in through towards him, its packed muscles bunching up with a mass of flash quick movement, the redhead having grunted when he dug the meat of his fingers into the Carbonous’ front left mangled leg and with a cry of frustration, tugged the creature’s leg clean off of it’s deformed torso and watched it writhe for only a second before bringing up his sleek black hand gun and creating a hole in its head with a bullet.
you.” Harry grunted out the low words between us, as if talking to himself as he watched me beneath the dark of his lashes, gaze hooded and burning.
Harry of course made me feel wanted and cared for and he was honestly someone I trusted the most. And he was my best friend so to say with everything that we’ve been through and his way of communicating with me. But it was nice to have someone else be in good company that wasn’t in any way romantic with me like Harry was.
I gave Harry a small smile, genuine in the way it spread across my lips as I gazed at Harry beneath my wet lashes. The Gryffindor gave me a lopsided smile, brilliantly gorgeous and striking in the way his eyes gleamed with mirth as he watched me laugh lightly and freely.
, so just stop-” My garbled words were interrupted as well as my physical smack down on Harry’s unbothered body when I felt my wrists being clasped tightly by the Gryffindor’s warmed, large hands and found my back slamming into the nearest wall, brutal and causing pain to explode in waves across my spine.
Having seen people die left and right because of my being a bloody savior to thousands upon thousands of wizards, had never made me sick, rather, I grew used to it and found sickening enjoyment out of seeing bodies drop to the ground.
There were strippers dancing and clinging to the poles on the upstaged platforms, people watching them while others danced and dry humped against each other with their clothes on, swaying of their bodies against one another to the rhythm of the music.
And when Harry didn’t move a muscle in the hand that was rubbing my lower half up against his own, I cried out in mortified frustration and blindingly stared ahead of myself as I brought the shaking of my hands up with my forearms to lay them out under me so I could get a strained leverage over the floor  and made a minute rock of my cock over Harry’s, blushing like the virgin that I was and letting out an obscure, wet moan that made Harry’s bulge stiffen further and my skin break out in shamed goosebumps.
Before I could protest on behalf of Harry, Hezian snapped his blue gaze on mine and gave me a curious quirk of his brow as he spoke to me directly.
With the way I reacted to seeing Potter after all these years, it seemed like my crush for him was still intact, and I hated it very much. Obviously, the Golden Boy wanted nothing to do with me from the way he treated me like of piece of gum scraped apart at the bottom of his shoes.
Ah, there it was, the dazed heated interest and caution in the fluttering of Draco’s eyelashes over his hazed blanketed eyes, showing the sudden sweet compliance and obedience in the slackening curve of his downy pink lips for a brief moment in the face of my gaze before blinking hard and causing his pliant surrender to harden visibly.
But when I went to quickly make a glance around the room while talking with Hezian in search for Harry, he wasn’t anywhere to be found.
in shattered moans as I tried to gasp for air, a euphoric dazed state of mind playing around the splotchy corners of my vision that gave me the gave way to the same sensation of being drunk.
Harry's hand was gripping the blonde tufts of the man's severed head in front of me, the appendage dangling precariously in his right hand.
Harry wasn’t affected at all. Unfazed. He just kept staring down at me with the red and green of his unsettling and carnal gaze.
The smell it emitted made me curl into Harry’s side some more, my breath stilting in the working of my repugnance and fear, my heart racing beneath my shaking chest as I gulped down the throw up that threatened to burst forth out of my mouth any second now.
Potter was going around killing people like it was nothing but a job to him, which was exactly what he was doing.
people to punish me! This is so fucked up, Harry. I demand for you to put me down!” I rose my right hand to slap it across Harry’s left shoulder, chest heaving up and down as I went into a sort of hysteria at the abrupt emotions smothering my conscience and body, scared of the man holding me yet oh so intrigued and heated by him.
Thanking the gods that Harry had decided to be nice and take out the butt plug and put a cleansing charm on me before he apparated me to the married couples place, I wiggled my bum comfortably across the floor of the warm living room happily, not having the strength not to get excited about how
the life out of the man and the dark magic that he gained from him having used it to murder his whole family like the sick fuck that he was.
When the demon slipped it’s long tongue between the open moue of my mouth from my scream, I hiccuped around a terrifying sob, panic rising in my chest as I tried to calm down the racing of my heart and my quivering body.
Although most of the time I did my best to hide any sort of emotion, I had a shite tone of it. I just didn’t want people to poke and prod at my vulnerability because they have always done it what with their expectations for a Malfoy being proper and bitchy and having no heart basically.
A thump of acidic hurt wound its way up the skin of my throat, my teeth smashing together harshly in an attempt to keep the mental and physical pain that pricked beneath my wide chest from expanding and spilling forth out of my emotionless mask.
The place before me had high ceilings and low, floating lanterns, each side of the walls having two sets of separated hallways that I could see doors line up against in rows.
me, hearing from the man that I liked tell me that we couldn’t be together because it would literally
I could hear people cheering, yelling, and releasing boisterous noises within and outside of the creamy peach marble covered mansion.
around incoherent words when I felt the long, scorch of Harry’s fingers wriggle its way further and deeper into my arse with a slippery squelch that made me turn a beet red at the face and neck.
And he probably didn’t think I would do anything bad, just run away like I often did in the face of his taunting.
Trying to will the heat away from zipping down into the space of my abdomen and straight to my groin, I gave a slight shift across Harry’s lap, wiggling about to appease the sudden influx of arousal threatening on a precipice to suffice over my lower half and shamefully reveal itself to Erus’ eyes. The showcase of my desire for Harry would only give this man leeway into making jabs at me for my damn horniness for him. So I kept my cock from perking up in interest.
twitch of my hips against the Gryffindor’s to feel the brush of his large, hard cock against my groin, searching for his touch like a an attention starved creature.
But then, something sliced right behind the space of my eyes, red hot and agonizingly biting into the frontal lobe to pierce like a hammering nail to the back of my skull, vision turning into vapid spots of flickering electrified blue and static white.
My nerves were completely frayed by such simple words, the absence of Potter’s being leaving me in a heap of inflamed flesh.
Next time you think of putting yourself in harms way, know that more deaths stack up because of your carelessness to maintain a behaved nature.” The Gryffindor’s voice dripped with his monotonous statements, muscles shifting beneath the onslaught of his shirt as he suddenly bounced me up off of his arm so fast and viciously that the movement had caused a significant squeak to leave my lips as my bum collided back on top of the curl of Harry’s forearm.
Taking in the way Harry’s back was eerily stuck with stiffness and how the muscles shifted with a predatory movement beneath the fabric of his dark shirt, I didn’t have the capability in my eyes to catch Harry actually bringing out a sleek black gun in the palm of his steady hand, the product looking eerily familiar to a Walther PPQ M2 from the quick motion of it being gripped in the Gryffindor's palm.
“So why do you work as an assassin?” I spoke through my mouthful of eggs, enjoying the food and the rare, civil conversation I was having with Harry for once in our lives even though I felt like my skin was being ripped off of my body to let the Gryffindor in front of me peer into my very soul.
The whole of my frame shook with a tremendous fluster of rioting emotions, the dreadful sense of unease trickling fine and thin inside of me, like the slipping of an unforeseen virus clustering together across the definite quiver of my stomach. But there was also the heady sensation of a dark enrapture that my mind fell into as I gazed, stricken and dazed with a disturbing heat, at the massacre before me.
Throughout my years as a student in Hogwarts, there has been this shadow casting over my body everywhere I went. I’ve lingered on the doubt of my parents love for me, the doubt of the promise Voldemort bestowed upon mine and my parents safety throughout the war that he initiated. There’s been doubt about who I was as a person, consistently and continuously. As I grew older, each choice I made, bad or good, festered upon my flesh and mind like a damn parasite. There has always been doubt inside, it breaks in me and molds me into who I am as of this present moment.
"You're not some other notch on my bed, Princess. You're someone very important to me and I'd kill anyone for you." Harry mumured his words down at me, sincerity eatched into his low tone as my bidy lit up from hearing his words.
My feet touched the platform as I sucked in one breath and the next in a calmed heavy inhale, eyes keeping straight forward whenever I did any sinuous movements as my hips rolled, my arse swayed teasingly, and as I writhed across the floor and around the pole. With the music reaching its second chorus line, I let my body snap forward at the same time I gripped the pole with my hand behind me as I faced towards the crowd, whipping my head forward in tune to the heavy rock song in an imitation of a sensual head bang.
The potions lab was large and spacious, the walls a deep color of steel grey and bare as it surrounded an area of tables with an array of colorful potions and mixing trays and bowls as well as informational books.
My cheek pressed against the wall, my arms flailing about from the sudden dizzy turn of my body and Potter’s hands branding themselves into my flesh.
“Didn’t know you were such an attention whore for me.” Potter murmured back, voice pitching in its husky tone as he let the green and ruby glow of his gaze slowly slide over to where I stood, watching me from the corners of his eyes as he gave another careless tug on his left wrist this time and caused me to yelp out at the intruding sound of the velcro dislodging from the base of his glove through the hush of the dark room.
But before I could protest any further, Zereth slammed their palm into the small divot of my spine, the impact harsh enough to make me gasp out in pain as my knees buckled beneath my weight and I fell the floor on my shins and palms. My breath was pushed out of me, back
I flicked my tongue out of my bottom lip, feeling my mouth dry as I stared at the Gryffindor before me, realizing that the man decided to ignore my rambling and instead, speak about how he named his bike after a
The vampire snarled at Potter before glancing back towards me with an angry curl of his lips, the sharp, stained yellow of his teeth enticing my throat to convulse in gross wariness.
But it’s not all fun and games in the face of my straining displeasure at having some random guy literally try to make me become his personal sex toy on a dance floor.
My lips pursed against the downy surface, letting out a tired whine in the silent confines of my dingy studio apartment as I rubbed both sides of my cheeks over the width of my pillow, murmuring into the fabric in a bout of boredom and restlessness.
Kikue’s eyes were dazed as he watched the playing of the purple lighting above his head, the red stain of his lips wide open as his chest heaved up and down rapidly while he let his eyelashes flutter about in a sort of hazy bliss. His hips swayed in sensual rolls up against Harry’s pelvis, like a ticking twitch that was oh so desperate and wanting as the assassin didn’t make a move but let the boy grind up on him.
When Sirius spoke his words, his voice came out stern and dipped in a undertone of a demand, causing my body to want to recoil from my cousin’s space in a way to distance myself subconsciously away from him in regards to hoping that I could perhaps try to run from the room now and not be forced to change into clothes that I was sure I could not work.
So my work schedule has been crazy. I'll be updating sometime every other week and I will not be giving away any official dates now because life gets in the way of me writing and therefore prevents me from meeting deadlines I want to meet and I don't want to end up disappointing you all when I say I will be posting on a certain date and end up not doing so.
The demon was openly watching me flail around like a wild puppet with a sickening mirth gleaming in their observant fiery gaze.
Realizing that I hadn’t responded to Harry, I whipped my head forward to stare out into the daunting shadows of towering forest trees a few feet away from the house before me, trying to calm the rapid beating of my heart as I responded.
The feeling of being utterly alone was slowly chipping away from around my heart, the sensation foreign almost from having been hated by everyone for a long time and not having anyone to talk with as an acquaintance.
I was talking before I could fathom what I was saying. “Wh-why are you here? Did you just k-k-kill Kingsley? Was this man even Kingsley? W-what’s happening?” I was a stuttering twat, nerves and hysteria getting the best of me as I looked up at Potter, my body still hunched over as the oxygen seemed to have been drained out of my chest and left me empty.
“Harry James Potter. I’m going to do this for the good of everyone and you’re not going to stop me. Besides, I’ll be fine if you give me my wand. I also won’t be
And dare I say, if Hermione didn’t pull me back into the conversation we were having, I most likely would have given Cho internalized bleeding with my magic.
But of course, without practice of wandless magic, I was left with nothing to help me rid of the thing playing with my head.
“Harry! Now should be a good time to use that trick of yours!” Granger’s unruly curls of auburn hair flipped around her neutral set of features as those doe brown eyes of hers snapped to the center of the large and red streaked room that was quickly stacking up with more piles and piles of human body parts.
Despite the magic from the guy having been sucked dry from my own magic drawing it with itself, the process done and over with, there was that heady sensation that catered to a vitalized dominion over the self and everything around me. My body felt as if fire flickered down the line of my throat and into my stomach, gnawing away at my abdomen with a power that felt all consuming and addicting.
I blinked up at Kingsley, lips thinning out as I responded. “I got there around 4:30 in the evening and left around 4:44 since I couldn’t stay for too long. You can ask my manager, Andrew, at my work that he, too, can vouch that I wasn’t gone long and he was the one that sent me to go to Astringent to give a drafted manuscript to Albon Trisko, one of our customers. Jazine told me where I could find Trisko, I also ordered a tequila shot from her then left afterwards. The reason for my rush out of the nightclub was because I was on limited time with staying in the club as well as getting back to my office quickly.”
The leather, black pants I wore were so fucking form fitting that it felt like I wore nothing given the simple fact that the material was quiet thin, stretching taught around the flex of my long legs and plump arse. It felt like they were painted onto my skin. When I first put on tht clothes, I felt a light breeze sweep across the flesh where my arse met my thighs. I ended up angling my head down and sideways to catch sight of the fabric ripped right below the swell of my bums cheeks to display my pale flesh out to the open.
Harry had come closer, impossibly so, causing me to release the tiniest bit of a whimper from the part of my lips at the audacity of this man having to place himself directly in my line of sight behind the second set of tables near the stage.
“U-Uhm … Can you please explain to me why you’re watching me sleep and how you’re alive Sirius?” My groggy morning voice filtered throughout the stilted air between us.
“I’m sorry. I wasn’t ordering you to do something. I just … well-Pansy and I really want you to go. You’re our best friend. Pansy can’t be here to try talking you into going to the party because she has to help some freshman do their homework. So please? Come with us?” Blaise’s tone sifted into a smaller hushed whisper, as if he was a child having been yelled at for doing something they knew they weren’t supposed to, his warm gaze falling away from my own in a meek, awkward manner as I continued to stare at him to purposely make him feel uncomfortable in his own skin and realize what he’s done.
I snapped my eyes away as I took in the way Sirius’ boyfriend’s back hunched as a warning that he was about to vomit any second now and focused on my own hysteric breathing as that same alcoholic, unwanted taste bubbled up in the back of my throat with a clawing fixation, stomach dipping with sickness while my widened eyes couldn’t escape the sight before me.
I let the door shut behind my person, closing it softly behind me since it was much more quiet in this room with alternative rock playing in the speakers mounted against the walls with magic in every top corner.
I was about to bring the boy’s head up by his hair and smash it back down across the gleaming floor hard enough to knock his arse out and leave him limp in his own sack of flesh for a good hour or two, but right when I was about to do just that, I felt hot, large hands slip their way from beneath my upper arms, grasp my tender flesh there and bodily lift me up with an easy pull.
But perhaps Harry was just saying that to make me vulnerable enough to let him give me the punishment he intended to procure upon my person for being, simply, a brat that needed to be taught a lesson.
“There’s nothing wrong with getting a little high. You guys do it, so I can too. Equal opportunity and all that. Now if you would give me an edible ... ?” I let out a languid tone, keeping my voice steady even though I caught the way Harry’s succulent lips tipped up at the edges in a minute small dark smirk, the green of his eyes shadowing over as he raised the left of his hand to curl it into a fist and rest the sharp bottom curve of his jaw against the furl of his knuckles. The black of his hair getting more messy from the subtle movement he made while he emitted a humming noise of contemplation, deep and viciously taunting.
“I wish to be apparated to Caetia and Sirius. I’d like to start working on the potion you wanted me to create tomorrow night. I’m rather tired and I’d like to be with people that I know and trust at the moment given my situation. Please tell Granger to visit me to wherever you send me.” I spoke in a soft murmur, although tight voiced as I tried to keep my boiling anger from sufficing out from my eerily calm tone.
With one last look down to the foyer, I gave a jolt in my frame from having my gaze collide spontaneously quick with Harry’s, the glow of his crystalline red and green eyes peering at me from beneath the hood of his eyes and the strands of his pitch black tousled locks, an indifferent expression on his face. But his gaze … it seared into me and left me staggering on my own two feet as I was being burned by the penetrating set of his harsh eyes.
Although I have learned and taken deep pleasure in the emotions provoked from killing, I still have parts of myself - the humanity that still lingers - that shames and hurts over a harsh act. Although the feelings are brief now and I could care less about it, I still have them. I’m more immune and indifferent to the emotions given through the time I spent in my own head and coming to terms with who I was.
My lips parted on a shuddering intake of breath, eyes trained on the rather prominent bulge of a cock, confused and rendered immobile.
Swallowing around a suddenly dry throat, I stepped off to the side in a slight split, my limbs stretching out in an elegant drawl as I turned my head in a fast circular motion. I let my hands grip around the pole above my head just as the heavy strumming of the guitar and the rasp screaming of the vocalist blasted through the speakers and thumped along the heat of my flesh. The slender shape of my arms tensed as I bodily lifted myself up with a slow inhale and swung myself around the pole, my head tilted back as I rotated it in a quick succession to go along with the pace of the song, movement aggressive and seductive as the tendrils of my hair kissed along my cheeks and forehead in a quick sweep.
I yelped at the motion, eyes widening when Harry made sure that my gaze was on his, holding me captive there to ensure that I held eye contact at the exact moment he gave me a notoriously sinful uptick of his cupid bow shaped lips, the blunt head of his heated dick kissing the pucker of my contracting asshole.
I snapped at Caetia then. “I’m fine. Harry is downstairs talking with with that slut of a host he probably fucked before multiple times. And as you can see, he doesn’t care to ‘console’ me at the moment because he doesn’t care about me, he’s made that clear now. I’ll admit that I’m having a small panic attack but I’ve gone through this countless times when I was a teenager so I don’t need your pity or your help and surely no one else's.” My words came out sharp and dripping with venom hissed countenance, my lips curling up to reveal a snark as I stared down at Caetia slightly from the few centimeters of height I had on him. My breaths came out short and rough as I pressed my lips tight together.
Lifting Harry’s hand up to level with my face, I felt my cheeks flush further, the buzzing in my ears humming louder as the red of Harry’s eyes grew into a faint burgundy hue, similar to that of dried blood, carnal and foreboding, when he
People around me seemed to have noticed my quick steps, their heads lifting the slightest as their slitted eyes observed the way I went over to Andrew’s office door and knocked fervently.
Sirius must have seen the look of alarm crossing over the width of my face because the man had taken a cautious step forward, deliberate and slow approaching as his eyebrows nosedived in genuine concern. “Look. I know Narcissa was a controlling bitch when she was alive so I’m sure you’re probably having a panic attack over having to wear something your mother had specifically taught you to never put on your body, but you are over twenty years old and Narcissa is not alive to give you a verbal smack down. Besides, you’ll look good in anything like Caetia and you’ll blend in more with the crowd so Harry doesn’t catch you. Your hair can’t be helped though, what with that silver, pale white color you’ve got going on, so you’ll need to hide behind a lot of people.”
from a Muggle comic movie series! Thanos was also the shorter name term for “Thanatos”, derived from Greek mythology as the personification of death and morality.
Then I remembered what Krum said about my virginity, my mouth pursing into a confusedly shamed and angered pout. “Like I said, don’t call me by any nicknames. And what makes you think I’m a virgin, Krum?” My words came out stilted and strained with a broiling rage, cheeks turning a profuse shade of pink that I couldn’t cover up for the life of me.
My bum bounced off of Harry’s groin only to come into contact again with the Assassin’s clothed prick when he tugged on my hair again, my body instinctively jolting back to follow the man’s pulling motion to keep my hair from ripping away from my scalp. My fingernails dug into the marbled ground as I let out a wail the same time Harry hit his hand again across my left cheek, the flesh jiggling as tears started to well up in the corners of my eyes.
I was taught by my father to be cold to others and because of that, no one liked me and thought of me to be a heartless bitch.
Screeching shrieks of pain and the sound of the cracking of bones and ripping of human flesh flooded my hearing, causing my breath to hitch in strain and terror as those screams reminded me of the war when I was a teenager, but
The wet snow kissed strands of Draco’s hair fell around the quaking of his shoulders in wisps of tousled filthy euphoria, the cherry petal “O” shape of his moist lips moving about in frenzied scorch, opening and closing with the slut of his broken kittenish mewls and squeaky unhinged pleasured screams a symphony of bliss in my ears as I took in the way the flushed peach tinge of his perky nipples hardened and stood up invitingly.
I sucked in a sharp breath, befuddlement taking over the whole of my brain as I tried to understand what the hell these two were chatting about. “W-what are you guys talking about?”
Despite the pain slucing down my spine across the floor I fell on and with Harry suffocating me beneath him under his passed out body, I really didn’t see myself wanting to be anywhere else.
I’d want someone to bury myself beneath concrete ten feet into the ground if Potter thought that I was turned on by him. It was true, but I’d rather have him know that adrenaline caused my state of arousal, not him. It happens. I heard it does.
But I figured at the same time, these sort of people that I had to exterminate were no better than I nor were they worth much of my time.
Sucking the bottom of my lip into the moist caverns of my mouth, I couldn’t help the bad habit of mine to chew fixedly on the flesh with an insistent manner, nibbling and causing the skin of my lip to tear and bruise faster than normal.
My eyes were stricken wide, my limbs having become jello by Harry’s touch and body on mine and from the utter surprise at being suddenly throwed and being in this sort of situation by Harry that I accidentally created.
The boss huffed out an irritated breath and looked off to the side, defeat evident in the way his shoulders slumped in surrender. “Deal. Now do you want to tell me all about this obvious new found relationship between you and Draco and also about the multiple damages and dead bodies you and your friend’s caused within the last week, Harry?”
I wanted to hyperventilate and have the panic attack I had to keep on lock down since everything that occurred recently.
. Alcohol will be everywhere, sex will stain the air and you can dress however you want since this isn’t a supervised get-together.”
Although his reputation for not giving two fucks about the way he carried himself now made others quite wary of him nowadays.
The air surrounding us went visibly thinner, making it hard to breathe and my mind to spiral out of control as I felt myself become dizzy with the sudden mixture of chilled and fire induced air.
Zereth had a man in his mid twenties crawling away from him over the ground with his broken limbs on the flat side of of his tummy. The man was looking frantically back and forth to me, horror etched across his face before the demon broke more of his bones with a simple wave of it's hand towards the guy, obviously using it's own magic to hurt him.
I recoiled from the massive body of the creature’s, my body instinctively going for its “flight” mode as my mind determinedly tried to find a grounding sensation of sorts to keep myself from outright screaming bloody murder.
If Harry could kill. So could I. And we can be fucked up together because of our actions and degrading morals.
” I choked out, reaching both my hands out with the intention to push Harry away from my ass only to hiccup around a mewl and drop my hands to place them on the wall weakly when Harry shoved his face between my cheeks unceremoniously.
Scrunching up my nose, I yelped out when my foot caught on some stone that protruded out from the others on the walkway, causing my mind to snap out of its daze as I tried to regain my balance and looked at the opening of the alley on the other end, a sensation of relief flooding me from the sight of it.
My breaths were caught in my throat as my heart stopped and started up again during abnormal intervals.
Snapping my eyes open, I gave out a squeak as I found my face at eye level with a black jean covered crotch.
Harry had calmed down the anxious insecurity that often took root into the deepest space of my stomach whenever I went too in-depth within myself, getting caught in the making of my own spiderweb of low self esteem.
And with one swift nudge of Harry’s hands, the steel door flung itself outwards and revealed the night shade of the sky, a flutter of leaves and tree bark surrounding the square entrance in a flurry of orange, red and copper brown, the seasons of Fall evident in the area surrounding the now open door to this bloody underground club.
Breathing in air through my nose, I felt my chest concave as it rose and fell incredulously in a slow manner, the abrupt calmness falling like a silent storm inside of my sternum causing my heart to thud in a tranquil pace now.
“We’re leaving this place and you’re going to get fucked. I’m taking that purity away from you and you’re going to beg and cry for more throughout every second of it. Do you understand me.” Harry’s voice was unnoticeable, his words dipping low in a grunted baritone that reached deep into the core of my groin, heat sufficing in my cock as Harry let out a clear demand instead of a question.
Sirius started leading me up the steps along with Caetia, right behind Harry’s retreating figure as he reached the top landing of the stairs and literally
And that’s when, after a given moment of wandering aimlessly around in this heavy air of darkness with my wide, horrified eyes, my peripheral view started to cease out of the cluster of the harsh and ominous smoke like tar of Harry's magic to slowly disintegrate back to a crystalline clear view, as if I was peering my head out of an endless tunnel and into the clear sheen of shimmering water.
Blaise reminding me that I wasn’t allowed to go to the party and have fun once in awhile for the sole reason of my school work getting in the way of doing so made me want to hex the Slytherin into next year.
I watched Blaise’s eyes track the ruffling movement of my hair, how the brown of his gaze fluttered to the opal hue of my messy strands in an awed fascination that shown in the slightly widened observant large set of his eyes.
Biting down on my lip and absentmindedly reaching my fingers up to brush them across the bruise of my neck , I jumped at the snarl that left Harry’s mouth, an animalistic low growl that had my stupid cock twitching and my skin breaking out in waves of heated tingles, fearful and warmed all at once. My eyes snapped up to meet Harry’s crimson, peridot etched gaze as the assassin leaned back against the kitchen island in the center a few feet away from me, the muscled cords of his arms flexing beneath his shirt as he crossed his arms over his chest. “Why is there a hickey on your neck?”
My heart gave a vicious thump against my chest, my lip releasing from its trap beneath my teeth to allow my mouth to gape apart, my breaths coming out in breathy exhales that left me shuddering on weakened limbs against the wall I was backed into like a trapped prey.
When I caught sight of the pole in my view as Harry walked with steady long strides a couple more inches away from it to suddenly see a damn red wooden chair placed smack dab in front of said pole as if was some sort of anomaly, that’s when I really started to try and get off of the Assassin’s shoulder.
Harry, the devil that he was, took initiative to snap his hips forward, the ramming of his pelvis over my aching prick causing my body to shift up the length of the wall as the assassin shoved his hard cock right up against my own, a sound of distressed heat bubbling out of my mouth as my feet were slightly lifted up off of the ground, the tips of my toes barely kissing the floor as I was held up against the wall from the press of Harry’s narrowed, fit hips.
I felt like a Christian child having been caught masturbating in the confessional booth in a church.
The clatter of my envelope against the black wooden floor made the boy who was getting fucked, snap his eyes back up to mine, stricken and worried about being caught in such a state. The sound interrupting my haze of thoughts.
I slapped my right hand up above my hand and against the wall, my other hand still clawing at Harry’s muscled back as I tried to ground myself with every push of Harry’s dick puncturing into me.
With the boiling of my arousal now dwindling away from the rush of my actions, I simply left the knife in the man’s rectum as I withdrew my hand from his gaping wounded arse spewing copious amounts of blood. I let my other hand drag itself through the slush of intestines for a couple more seconds, enjoying the way the guts sloshed around in a slippery slope around the smooth texture of my fingers and palm before drawing it out of the man’s body too.
With a roll of my eyes, I ignored the pain pricking at the center of my chest, trying to vanish the image of Potter fucking into Trisko from my head.
As I tore out some sort of intestine that I had no clue of - my magic a swirl of chaotic energy that took in Zereth’s own dwindling afterlife magic - that’s when I felt a presence stab into my magic’s atmosphere.
“Fine fine,” I voiced out quietly, already trying to peel away from Harry’s chest but failed when the Gryffindor slapped his free hand straight across my bum, stopping my attempts to get off of him.
Harry’s large hands that gripped Kikue’s arse, tensed for a moment, the veins beneath his flesh becoming a brief definite protruding strength that made the host’s spine curve back and rub the pert of his nipples over the Gryffindor’s chest, the meat of Kikue’s arse practically spilling through the ironclad grip of Harry’s steel like fingers.
The sound was there for only a split of a second before Harry, without as much as flinching and without hesitation with how fast he pulled the trigger on his gun, fired one single bullet that rang aloud throughout the room and stung my hearing range, temporarily cutting off any noise from the strain of my ears.
I yelped out in surprise, my tone high as I felt my frame being carelessly drug up into the air as I was forced to dangle above Kikue’s still figure, my feet swinging to and fro as I blinked profusely in confused irritation, my mind going haywire as I tried to catch up to everything happening around me and sort through the cluster of emotions that nestled inside of my gut.
idea. “No way. I’m just starting to get comfortable in my own body as well as showing skin for fucks sake. Becoming a stripper requires strength that I don’t have when dealing with grabbing onto a metal pole for your dear life. I’d be injured, plus, I’m not confident in seduction skills, thank you very much.” My words came out rushed and breathy, an uncomfortable ball of energy settling into the space of my gut with the thought of swinging my legs around without barely any clothes on as I ground myself against a non living object for others’ pleasure.
The two men went clattering across the floor in hard grunts when I saw their backs slam against the ground from their weight making their fall rather heavy.
And my head cleared of any ache, body lazing against the chair of Hezian’s office as all air wheezed passed my mouth lightly, my vision clearing with sharp clarity.
I had to control that part of myself, my magic, from hurting the one thing that I absolutely adored.
I ignored the sounds the men created around me, taunting me as I was about to snatch the bag of edibles right before the damn bag itself moved further away from my reach and towards Neville, causing my body to tilt forward from losing my balanced momentum as the left of my hand smacked against the wooden table and cards when the bag had moved on its own away from my grip.
With my brows furrowed, my body jolted back, eyes widening when Harry shifted so fast in front of my eyes that it felt like my head would have been swivelling off of my neck at my quick, sorry attempt to following the assassin’s rushed motion that led him to turn the broad of his back towards me, standing right in front of my sitting form across the bed.
I looked over at Harry as the Gryffindor brought down his book away from the front of his face, his blank expression giving me the urge to shuffle uncertainty on the balls of my feet under the guise of his penetrating heated gaze.
I rolled my eyes, lifting my left leg up the slightest in quick succession as I collided my shin against Kikue’s right one and watched him sway to the side and wobble on the heels of his stilettos, his scream of panic causing my ears to string from the pitchy tone.
Before deciding to take a shower, I had wandered around the suite to check if Potter was here and after a good solid ten minutes of calling out his name in curious fixation with no response and no sign of the man, I had given up and went about my own business.
I jerked in surprise, my breath exhaling lightly from my gaping mouth, as I felt the drying cum on my skin, vanish. My once bare legs and my naked groin were now covered up by the leather pants that Harry had torn off of me just minutes before, my eyes taking in the barren floor now, scraps of the ripped fabric gone and the evidence of my pleasure becoming a clean slate.
On instinct at being left with no clothes on my lower half, I tried to scramble across the floor with the snapping of my hands coming up above my head so I could claw my fingers into the stone floor and get some leverage in my writhing panic, embarrassment, and heat to try and drag myself away from the prying eyes of Harry’s that I could feel boring into the soft cheeks on my arse.
“I … I didn’t do as you told me to. I got in a fight with a vampire who would have k-k-killed me if you didn’t step in. I-I tried running away from you and insulted you. I shouldn’t be t-talking because I’ve killed people too, in the past.” My voice came out weak and quiet, breaths coming out rapid now as I avoided Harry’s burning gaze and tried to force my boner down.
Thankfully the table I was bent over had only an array of potions books, but the legs of the table had rattled in it’s metallic state, the table wobbling slightly at the impact of my body being forced upon it.
Hermione loved her husband in the way he was a loud and boisterous fellow with a heart of gold and the need for the morally right aspect to succeed.
I both hated and liked the way Potter made me feel comforted. He made me feel weak and strong at the same time.
Lifting my head up, all oxygen in my lungs halted as I was faced with Harry’s mouth now barely a millimeter away from my own, my gaze subconsciously darting down to the Gryffindor’s lips as I spoke around a distracted rasping mumble. “What do I do about it?”
I’m about to come! W-wh-what’s happening? Aha-ah-ngh!” The heavy familiar sensation of Harry’s dark magic slipped its way around my torso in a slinking touch, wrapping itself over me to abruptly tug me up in a nauseating fast pace where I found my back colliding with the burning, hot clothed covered abs of Harry’s, feeling the racing of his own heart against the sweat of my shuddering spine.
The air in my lungs felt dissipated and gone from the shock and heat and turmoil my skin and body fell under as the astonishing brilliance of Harry’s gaze fell directly upon my figure, watching me beneath his hooded lids as the cupid bow shape of his lips tipped up into a grin that was nothing but sinister delight.
My knees buckled form under my weight, making me stagger across the wall as I slid down the hard surface and breathed rapidly with the rise and fall of my chest. I looked up at Harry, who had taken a step back and looked down at me with a raise of his brow, eyes dark and hair glinting from the low lighting above us.
my cock rising up in interest. And the way Harry said my nickname made me flush deeper, as if teasing me about my high status and how I was on my knees for someone when a person of royalty shouldn't be.
I pressed my lips together, stubborn in the face of my thoughts and Harry’s demand even though what I really wanted was to follow through with Erus’ demands and have everyone know that I was his and he was mine.
Potter’s grip on me had been released, the warmth of the Gryffindor’s body evaporating as the man took a step back and watched me heave in one breath with the next at his quick movement, cheeks burning and my limbs seconds away from crumbling beneath my weight.
Kikue was staring up at me still, as if having stopped in all his movements with the way his once trembling arm that he had outstretched towards me in a fit of frantic rage, was caught up above his head and was stuck that way without motion.
Harry's voice dropped into a brutally calm rumble, the sound shaking my rib cage and causing my breath to leave my lungs for a passing beat. The now straight, cold line of his mouth revealed a dark and foreboding air, giving nothing away of his thoughts.
Harry must have mentally conjured up a spell that kept my clothes from showing my boy parts. I obviously couldn’t use magic and the skirt would have already shown the world my lace covered prick and arse from the gust of air the motorcycle sped through with a smooth trek without having magic playing a part in all this.
I don’t … I’ve n-never-r-r …” My words grew faint through a hiccup I released as a spike of pleasure shot right over my groin and in the mingling of my trepidation when the Gryffindor gave me an ascending tilt of his lush mouth, the corners of the usually void line of a lips turned up into a crude, carnal grin at the same time he raised a brow and brought his knees further apart, agonizingly slow, causing my thighs placed precariously over his own to sprawl out and split apart even more so.

And I grew slightly dizzy with a nauseous sensation at the way my thoughts and the frame of my person reacted to such a
I yelled at him this time, my voice shrill and cracking at the seams as my words cut over his own, the stutter of my heart rapid and agonizing beneath the flutter of emotions brewing a storm inside of me at what I was hearing. “I don’t have to understand! I want you! You want me! It’s that fucking easy. Tell me what you’re talking about and we can find a way to get through it.
The only thing I could think of to do at the moment, was to stay by Harry’s side and follow the assassin to our destination, my skirt ruffling about across the sensitive skin of my bum cheeks and my eyes resisting the urge to wander towards Harry’s person so I could end up gawking at him.
I watched the way Harry’s exposed hard rock abs tensed and relaxed beneath the flitter of his shirt that rose up whenever the Gryffindor dug his cock into me with malicious intent, coveting me with the blunt of his fingers jabbing and leaving crescent moon shaped marks over the top sides of my thighs where he held me spread open for his taking.
us being together would never happen and why he would end up hurting me if we did? I also wanted to know about what the hell was going on with him in regards to all that
“You’re out of y-your mind. Oh gods, what the bloody hell did I get myself into? Put me down, Harry.” It seems that once I’ve spoken Harry’s name out loud, I stuck with it.
He made me want to inflict every disembodied emotion my hazarding self had onto him, so he could take some of my confused pain, sorrow, happiness, and joy so I wouldn’t have to carry everything, even the void that I drowned myself in most of the time.
by the time I’m through with this shite.” I cursed out my words angrily, hunching forward to catch my breath and close my eyes from the nauseating sensation tingling in my stomach and the thudding pricks inside of my head that gave it a dull throb of pain.
I was going to have to behave for the time being if I wanted to live through the next few months. If anything was to happen to me, Potter was supposed to protect me and the only way he could is if I allowed him to and if I did as I was told, which was to be cautious and
With my orgasm having came, I was still in the remnants of it’s come down, simmering in it’s ride of pleasure as Harry gave a few more series of hungry punches inside of me with his cock before he went rigid, the lines of his muscles tensing profusely as he went completely still and flooded me with his cum in a stream of warm liquid, squishing me against the wall as he let all his body weight fall onto me.
The guard raised his dark brows, a slow frown curling down on his mouth as his eyes darkened into an azure hue, voice harder and coated with a bittersweet heat. “I see you’ve still got that awful attitude you’re so widely known for,” Brady let out a gruff snort then. “Better get in there, Death Eater, or I’ll crush your scrawny arse before you can even blink.”
The scent of sea water salt invaded my senses as the purse of my mouth parted in surprised awe as I looked around the area surrounding me.
is.” The familiar sound of Harry’s deep timbre of a voice, warmed and in a low drawl, came directly from my right, sudden and causing me to jerk on the spot with an indefinite squeak.
Harry let out a low, amused chuckle, foreboding and sadistic with the edges of his lips tipped up the slightest to reveal a crooked, teasing grin.
The bartender snapped at me as I stood there contemplating if I should go down or not. “Blaise said that no harm is to come to you, so don’t worry about it. The club does have a reputation to uphold and messing with a wanker isn’t something we want to do.”
I had a sickening feeling that what Draco was born and turning into made my own powers grow heavier with the urge to consume and sabotage. But the question was
Potter and I were always fighting since we were little. Maybe, perhaps, I got off on it. The hate and the cruelty constantly filled with heat made my blood boil and my body crave the burn from Potter’s words and actions.
“Don’t let strangers into your place when you look like a whore. They may think you’re an open invitation to fuck, and we both know you’re a virgin. Wouldn’t want your precious virtue soiled so easily. Mother dearest would roll in her grave.” The Gryffindor’s statements had made my eyes widen in affronted shame, anger and astonishment.
And the fact that Granger just called me by my first name made me feel so fucking elated with a sense of ease and familiarity that I haven’t felt with a potential friend in a long time since Pansy stopped talking to me.
Sucking on the skin of my lower lip, I brushed my hands over the plaid of my skirt, trying to get my legs to work once again and gain enough strength to move as I tried fixing my messy appearance from the bike ride and the chaotic strands of my hair, letting the blood flow back into my limbs. “Right, w-well, let’s go.”
Just give any of the guards your name and they’ll let you in since it has such high security surrounding it. He’s a very important member for this company, don’t screw up and lose the papers," My boss snipped at me, tone crisp and without a pitch of interest, just blunt and drone like.
The assassin let out a large breath, the timbre of his voice warming me up from the inside out as he spoke back to me into the top of my head once again. “Don’t say sorry. I know you’re not doing alright so just let me hold you. Get some rest. Talk to me about everything and anything when you are ready, Draco.”
Since Granger couldn’t show up with the clothes she bought for me until tomorrow morning, I had asked Harry about what I was going to wear for the night and he simply cast his hand in a sweeping gesture to the night stand beside my bed and magically conjured up a white T-Shirt with flannel pinstripe pajama pants, soft and silky to the touch. Harry had given me my clothes the second I walked into my bedroom.
Openly glaring at the girl, I let out a small puff of air. “Don’t ever call me ‘cute’. And I’m not being a prude, it’s called having the decency to keep any inappropriate language or thoughts from being heard by others, similar to the phrase ‘having manners’.” I refused to acknowledge that Potter was going to be with Granger and when we shop, my pulse seemed to like the idea of having the Golden Boy around with the way my blood rushed and heated my skin up at that thought.
The Gryffindor crowded into my space, looming over me with the tall frame of his fit stature, the enticing scent of his blanketing my senses and the furnace of his body heat playing across the constrained limbs of my person. I stared back at him in shocking fear and rousing inflammation.
Completely fucked dumb on Harry’s cock, I could only dangle there, jostled to and fro while my pleasure rode higher and higher. My breaths were cutting short in my lungs as I tried to make sense of everything going on around me.
I went even redder at the Gryffindor’s words, my fingers falling to the floor so I could dig my fingernails into the wooden ground in a rush of nerved heat.
It took me a while to stop my denial of how much I enjoyed taking pleasure in literally draining people of their essence for my own gain, both dark and light magic combined.
Huffing out an air of exaltation, I walked over to my little closet to throw on a pair of skinny blue jeans that hugged my arse and the long stretch of my legs snugly, form fitting around the small of my waist and over the jut of my hip bones with a comfortable clinging. I got the jeans from a muggle store in London last week since the clothes in the muggle world were significantly cheaper than the ones in the wizard world. I put on a loose fitted, long sleeved blue top to match with my jeans and a black trench coat to cover up the whole of my body so no one would really notice the dainty frame of my figure and have a chance to make fun of me for it. I knew people here were itching to have an excuse to make harsh remarks at me, simply for being an ex death eater and a Malfoy. I didn’t need to give them more leverage over my diminished confidence.
“It would be really nice if you looked at me w-while I talk-” My words were halted when Potter gave a particularly too hard of a punch against the bag, the sound deafening to my ears. It made the thing tear itself away from its hook on the chain and bang against the wall opposite from where Potter stood.
drew itself out of Harry’s still body, the color of ink like smoke having whipped forth from the bronze flesh of the assassin’s, similar to the obsidian color of Harry’s unruly hair.
My cock, half hard since I’ve been in close proximity to the delicious blonde, swelled up further with the rush of warmed blood flooding my groin at the pained and angered expression so obviously shown across Draco’s face.
I felt torn, skewed of conscience as I observed the one thing I couldn’t have keep a good distance away from myself while I tried to keep my magic at bay and self taught myself to keep it intact. I felt out of place from my body, made up of fog that clustered in on itself and smothered those around it. I felt like a fucking animal, a mere disgusting creature that fumbled about on pristine floors until it seemed as if I had begun to walk on all four limbs like the
“We broke up because we both concluded that we were better off friends given the fact that I didn’t feel any sexual attraction towards her. Sex with Ginny seemed like fucking a friend that I’ve known since I was a little kid. Didn’t feel right. I should have stopped being with Ginny when I noticed I didn’t feel anything romantic towards her but back then, I cared what people thought about me as the Chosen One and everyone wanted Ginny and I to be together so much that I was wary of breaking things off. And of course Ginny was pissed off at me for my feelings but she dealt with it and she was the one that ended our platonic relationship. Now she’s with Dean and she hates my guts.” Harry’s spoke his words as if he had recited his lines to an audience, formal and emotionless.
Harry stared me down, gaze unwavering in the way the red seeped into the green and showed a grim carnal focus that had quite literally almost had me turning around and running far away from this intimidating man who clearly was not having any of my sass at the given moment. I didn’t know what it said about me when my stupid prick started to plump up with the sudden influx of warmed desire coursing through my veins at the evident danger the Gryffindor gave away.
The confident man pointed at the chair positioned in front of a glass desk as he rounded it and plopped himself down into the cushioned brown leather office chair opposite of mine behind the desk.
That’s when I felt my energy start to visibly and physically pour away from the center of my stomach and up my esophagus, a pain unlike anything I’ve ever imagined sufficing as agony started to burn through my lungs. It seemed as if fire licked it's way from the inside and out of my body like iron spikes, the pain prodding viciously against my chest and up my throat as my widened gaze stared up at the burning ones of Zereth’s.
As usual, I became a bitch in the face of my vulnerability in an effort to cover the my havoc of emotions I was feeling.
you, so I need you to hate me. You don’t have a single ounce of thought as to how much I’ve imagined
