"Um…yeah, sure," Potter followed the suggestion, sitting in the chair across from Draco's, making Potter seem smaller than he was.
There was no warmth in that memory now.
Realization settled into Draco's stomach. "You think I pushed her," he said, his chest hollowed out.
Draco sighed, this wouldn't work if Potter was worried. "Come on, help me with this," Draco motioned for Potter to follow him to a table that appeared behind the couch. The Room changed around them has Draco imagined exactly what he needed for tonight. Draco laid his bookbag on the waist-tall wood table, then started to pull the objects out of his bag that had been expanded with an Extension Charm. Potter stood next to him, setting the objects in a more organized manner, although Draco hadn't truly needed help.
"I think he's dead," joked Daphne.
Draco ran his tongue over his teeth.
"Fuck off," Potter smiled up at him.
"Here," Potter shoved a small object into Draco's hand.
"You should know that she really liked you," Cho stood up, there was a sharp determination in her eyes.
Daphne, glowing with her long blond hair as smoke billowed above her head.
"Potter, this isn't a reflection of your abilities."
"But…" their Lord's voice raised slightly, "it was more than one mistake, wasn't it?"
"Draco-"
Draco absolutely would not talk to Potter, he was very busy avoiding Potter. Thank you very much.
"Quiet Harry, I'm having to concentrate," Draco tsked. Potter laughed as Draco scratched his head in pretend thought. "A third reason why you're lucky…hmm…can't be your friends or your looks"
The pair continued to level their gazes. Severus pulled his hand away from the doorway slowly, allowing Potter through. Draco hurried to follow, only to have a cold hand lay on his shoulder.
"Good morning," Draco greeted whenever Astoria came down the stairs from the girl's dorm.
Murdered.
Pansy fumed for the rest of dinner, but remained silent.
Potter didn't need coldness now. He needed some kindness, some warmth. Potter would take the responsibility for Daphne's death. There was nothing Draco could do to pull that grief from Potter's hands. He clung to grief by the very tips of his fingers. When would the weight of the death that followed Potter, but had yet to find him, be enough to force him to the floor? How much blood would Draco spill and Potter bare the grief? Was Draco strong enough to carry Potter's grief, as well has his own? Was he worthy?
The man instantly released Potter as the glass broke against him. The smell of blood suddenly in the air as the man was forced from his feet, his back hitting the shelves with a twisted snap. Glass broke against the Death Eater as glass globes continued their attack. Blood dripped from the opening of the bone white mask.
"He is the problem!" Severus yelled. "Ever since you two have started this-" Severus made a vague hand motion in Draco's direction- "you have become unstable."
Potter yanked his hand from Draco's, Draco turned to a wand in his face.
If any other Slytherins were in the class, Draco would be more inclined to start a pissing contest. Thankfully, Zabini was a quiet person, and preferred conversation over public confrontation, so Draco did not feel the need to instigate a fight with Potter. However, that did not mean Draco refuses to rise to the bait, as Potter is teasing with his overly stupid remarks.
Astoria kept glancing at Draco. He made her uncomfortable, he supposed. She wouldn't enter the compartment, but she wanted something from Daphne. Did Draco's presence stop her? Was she scared of Draco to the point where she couldn't bear to be in the same room as her?
"Yes," he wasn't capable of being cleaver.
If only Umbridge wasn't the first Professor to break up the fight. If only Umbridge wasn't a Professor at Hogwarts. Potter would have been given detention, of course, but not this abuse. Perhaps if this abuse was reported, given to the media, then maybe this would stop.
"I'm glad to hear that, as I understand, there was a bit of a close call?" Draco tilted his head. He was playing with fire. He couldn't make himself stop.
Daphne.
"You probably breathed in her direction wrong," Draco joked, "I can get you a salve that will relieve the bruising and tenderness, it's been too long to try any simple medical spells. I can also give you a potion that could get rid of any scarring, though-" Draco made a motion to Potter's forehead, "you might not be too worried about that."
"I'll just be going," he stood a step back.
He was only able to enjoy Finnigan's confused expression for a second before Draco punched him in the throat. Wrapping his hand around Finnigan's wand, he yanked the weapon out of Finnigan's grasp, tossing the wand behind him. Finnigan had both hands at his neck, trying to catch his breath. Draco brought his fist back, and drove it forward into Finnigan's diaphragm, the air leaving Finnigan's lungs.
"Morning Draco," Daphne supplied cheerfully.
Potter took his place at Draco's side. Draco couldn't stop himself from staring at him. Potter's face was knitted in concern. "Look, Astoria, I'm really sorry about your sister-"
Draco's heart sank to his stomach. "Oh, I'll just leave," Draco turned to grab his things.
"Draco, please, I'm already so tired."
Bulstrode and Blaise stood together. Blaise looked at Theo, who looked as if he was about to cry, but he didn't say anything.
The front page, the entire front page, were articles of the ten missing Death Eaters from Azkaban.
"What did Firenze talk to you about after class?" Potter called out to him.
"Do more? What could you possibly do?" Draco intrigued.
Draco was stupid enough to further investigate, finding the Weasley Twins dramatically announcing their different products. Fred and George were, quite simply, the biggest pricks Draco had ever had the displeasure of meeting. Did Draco draw first blood by making it his personal duty to piss off every Weasley? Yes. Did the Weasley's hate Draco because of his name, what his father did do the youngest Weaslet? Probably. Did Draco blame them? No. Did this erase the fact that the Weasley twins were still in fact, pricks? Absolutely not.
That smile made Draco lean in. His head was warm from the breath of fresh air that was being with Potter. Potter's face slacked into surprise as Draco's forehead almost touched his.
Astoria.
Draco finally managed to focus on his homework as the talk died to a whisper between Montague and Pansy. The only interruption was the occasional giggle from Pansy as Montague started nosing her neck.
"Did I?" Potter teased.
She looked behind her, saying something that Draco couldn't hear, before looking down at Draco and miming smoking. He nodded.
Greyback barked, "Who the fuck did you piss off enough to get your nose broken?"
"Mafalda," she answered, clinging her bag to her chest.
"-just. Give it to me."
"I'm doing this for my own reasons, don't try to understand," Draco argued, his voice steady.
"Careful, Daphne's on her warpath," Crabbe grumbled.
He wasn't going to kill Dumbledore. He couldn't. No matter how irritatingly vague the man was.
Lucius knew his son better than to take his words for face value. "Don't be coy Draco, it doesn't suit you," he snapped.
"Move it or lose it Malfoy," he heard a familiar voice from above him.
"I think you're more than just brilliant," Potter prompt his head on his hand, looking down at Draco.
"Why wouldn't you?" Draco snapped. "I'm just a bloodthirsty Death Eater after all."
The bricks echoed their footsteps, they sounded too loud in Draco's ears. His vision blurred with tears he had yet to shed, he shallowed down the lump in the back of his throat.
Blaise and Bulstrode stood next to Ms. Zabini. She gave Draco a hug as he passed her. He made himself hug her back. He didn't deserve to be comforted.
Bulstrode, because the situation couldn't get any worse, shoved Crabbe while he was distracted. Crabbe fell to the floor, flush with embarrassment. The crowd gasped; the Slytherin House was usually united.
This could reintroduce the wizarding world into the idea of betrothing minors. She wasn't being forced to marry an old man twice her age. It would be presented as a mutual agreement between two families, the media could spin this into a fairy tale happy ending. Which is why a family not in the immediate control of the Dark Lord was chosen, the Greenglass family was well known throughout the Wizarding World.
"That's true, but-"
His meals were served in his room, so he would not be a bother to the Malfoy's guess. Draco supposed this was his mother's way of protecting him. Out of sight, out of mind he supposed.
"Gross, get a room," Pansy piped in.
"Yes, I remember a troll wearing a ridiculously pink dress tackling me off of my broom while I was flying," Draco smiled at the memory.
He wasn't so brave.
The sounds of his footsteps filled the otherwise silent halls. Not many students were out this close to bedtime, but he was able to walk as he pleased due to his prefect status. He made his way directly to the statue that marked the entranceway to the tunnel that would lead to the Shrieking Shack. He wondered if Potter wouldn't mind if they changed their meeting spot. The initial surprise of being in that space again had worn off, but Draco always found himself cold in the shack.
"Have you started the homework for History?" Daphne helpful asked.
"A group has to be more than two people," Daphne joked back.
"You've got to be shitting-" Daphne stepped on his foot.
"He approves, I assume."
The feast ended too soon.
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, please forgive me, I won’t cause you anymore trouble-" Potter kept chatting into Draco's shoulder, now wet from Potter's tears. Draco cupped the back of Potter's head, his other arm still wrapped around his waist.
"Is that all you wanted from me?" Potter asked, walking down the hall to the couple.
He wasn't a child. He wasn't. He had that taken from him.
Draco's chin quivered. Since when was this void between them?
"Draco?" he heard Potter call for him. Cho must have left. Draco, with as much dignity as he could, crawled out of the table, his bookbag in hand. There was no point in trying to hide the fact that he had been crying. He hurried to the door, he needed to get out of this room.
"Who's there?" a harsh male voice growled.
"Potter I can't accept this."
Pansy met his eyes, standing stiffly next to her mother. Pansy's hair was styled in a bun at the base of her skull, and there was so much makeup on her face she could easily pass for twenty. Her waist was tightened in a dark purple dress, the color brought out her pale complexion. Her eyes were wide with fear, her neck red with force as she fought back her tears.
"Potter is making you into a-"
"Harry Potter says you must come quick! Umbridge as fou-"
Daphne stared at Draco. "Why?" she prodded.
No. He wouldn't allow himself to focus of the hypotheticals. He needed to handle the situation he was facing now. The rest will have to wait.
Dumbledore nodded gravely, "I can assure you that Madam Pomphrey is doing her best to help her."
He didn’t look into why he liked having people struggle for his attention.
"Do you know who you're going to pick?" Theo continued asking him questions.
He shrugged, "None so effective."
Draco's shoulders relaxed, "I should get back to breakfast," he mumbled.
"No impression, just a good reason," the venom laced his voice.
"Daphne spent the date literally twisting my arm, I have bruises," Draco challenged.
Daphne paused to take a deep inhale of smoke, she shrugged, "I suppose so. Should I be?" she answered.
Then Pansy wouldn't return home for break.
Draco made to shove pass the woman, only to flinch when she brought her wand up. He instantly moved his arms to protect himself, moving to grab his wand. “And what exactly do you think you’re doing?” he snapped.
"How am I supposed to not think of anything?" Potter retorted.
"Just ask her to compare notes when she gets here," Theo reasoned.
Draco snorted, turning it into cough whenever Severus turned his glare to him.
He was brushed aside by his parents. The betrothal ceremony would take place this evening in the Manor's grand hall. There was much to still plan.
"No, I won't. I promise," Draco swore. Draco leaned against the wall of the hallway. Theo followed.
Draco stacked his books high on the table in the far corner. Mostly used as a spot for snogging as the space was almost private, but Draco had started to use this table for his studies. There were no tables nearby and no one wanted to sit with him so he had blessed silence. A couple of students and couples walked by, but hurried away whenever they saw who had taken the table, but Draco had barely noticed any of them due to his work.
Class ended, Draco stood, his back already packed, ready to follow Potter to lunch. Everyone was ready to leave, they hurried out of the hell that was history class, Potter was lost in the crowd. Pansy pulled Draco back into his seat.
So why, Draco pondered, was Potter hiding in the overhead storage next to Goyle's trunk? Who else would be under the invisibility cloak? If it's fucking Weasley, Draco will break his nose.
Potter took a deep breath in, as if gathering his courage, "Malfoy, look, I-"
Perhaps the Dark Lord would make an example of what happens whenever you fail him and put an end to Draco's misery.
"Oi!" he snapped. The present reappeared on the table.
She stared into his eyes, quickly serious, "I promise I will stay true-"
"This will be your table," the hoist prompted.
She hated him. Pansy, his friend. She hated him. How could Draco be so blind to her suffering? He had tried, had tried to take care of her, but she needed more of him than he could give. He couldn't do anything. He was worthless.
Today was not that day.
A knock saved Draco from an hour long lecture of the life of Daphne Greengrass. Daphne opened the door with a cast from her wand.
Draco repeated his attack. He was much more gentle with this retelling however when he told Potter that he didn't see his assailant.
Draco didn't budge, didn't blink. He stayed still and silent. He wasn't going to bait Snape. He wasn't going to give him an inch out of sure stubbornness.
"All as well," Draco answered dryly.
"Pansy?" Draco inquired at the strange sight, his stomach twisting.
"No, I just know my mother," she grinned.
"Yes, well, Greyback and his goons are ones to talk," Draco noted, his tea long cold.
"Sorry?" the tiny genius asked.
Severus looked up from his paperwork. Glaring at Draco for interrupting his paperwork, before looking down to finish grading the report.
Potter let out a small giggle, he shifted, rubbing the back of his head, but he didn't step away. Draco could see Potter's dark skin warm under the comment. Potter bit his lip. "How very Gryffindor of you," Potter grinned.
"Yes, Draco," Dumbledore smiled, "I trust you."
"It's no one!" Potter blurted.
"Fuck, so you heard about that," Draco put his head in his hands.
"How do you explain yourself, my dear?" he asked, his voice strangely warm.
"Potter," Draco wouldn't let go.
"I'm worried that it took you this long to figure that one out Potter," Draco smiled back.
"Someone needs to show you your place, Malfoy," Montague sneered, "walking around like you own the castle, when really you're nothing but a traitor to the pure blooded name." Montague moved closely into his space, trying to intimidate him.
He pulled at Daphne's fucking chair, waiting for her to sit.
Draco had ensured himself a spot close to where the champion was supposed to enter with the help of Crabbe and Goyle and his own biting personality. He had hoped the champion would be Cedric; Draco had even made him a champion pin with his newfound crafting abilities. Cedric would always say hi to Draco in the halls with his charming smile. He would always talk to Draco, thank him for all of his support. He had even listened to Draco when he went on and on about the different strategies Cedric should use when facing his trials in the tournament. That excitement turned into pure dread at the sight of his lifeless body.
"Aw, thanks. You too," Theo returned the agreement.
"I have my ways," Draco wasn't ready to give up all of his secrets.
Draco turned back to the couple, Theo pale, his eyes wide and smile gone. Blaise was looking down.
The silence that hit the room sunk into his chest. He froze, he made sure to leave his face blank after the realization. How could he forget? He killed her, and he dared to forget that? Forgetting her, washing her blood from his hands, was the worst sin he could commit. If she was willing to give her life, her memories, her soul, carrying her memory was his sacrifice to contribute.
Draco tried a different approach. Uncrossing his legs, he allowed his elbows to rest against his knees as he leaned forward, "I'm not trying to be difficult, Potter, I just need to know how this information could get out. I need to watch my own back," he confided, allowing his voice and face to soften, appearing vulnerable.
What did Cho Chang have that he didn't? She was a girl, for one.
Crabbe's face lit up in worry, "Is he ok? I only ask because that won't let me see him and he hasn't written to me. I know he isn't one with words you see but-"
His Lord hummed, turning back to the sky. "Did you know her well?"
"This is wonderful, thank you," Daphne spoke over his yelp.
"What does it matter if Daphne and I are more than just friends?"
He didn’t pull away when he was done weeping, enjoying Daphne's embrace. He waited until he was sure he had finished crying before separating from her. His face felt too warm when he pulled away, he was too tired to be embarrassed at his own outburst, but she just looked at him with kind eyes as she rubbed his shoulders. She stopped only to light another smoke with practiced hands.
"It's been a long day."
Draco took the smoke. He leaned into the flame provided by a lighter from the man's pocket. Inhaling deeply as the cigarette was lit.
"If I were to have used my wand, I would have finished you in three seconds," there wasn't a waiver in Draco's voice, he could have been talking about the weather with one of his Professors. "Remember that the next time you want to get cheeky."
Daphne looked up at Lucius, challenging him with authority she didn’t have.
Draco wanted to follow Weasley's lead, to put his head on the desk to sleep after last night, but he couldn't. Not with Potter sitting so close to him. It's not as if the two had never sat next to each other before. After last night… Draco knew the energy between them had changed. How was he supposed to talk to Potter now? Surely Potter wouldn't try to extend their new relationship outside the walls of privacy, would he?
"Giant spiders classify as, 'ok so long as they aren't trying to eat you'," Potter corrected in a very serious tone.
Draco blinked, "Um… Draco. If you don't mind the informality, my Lord."
He understood exactly what Blaise was toying with. Draco remained silent, turning to Blaise, facing him, facing his own past self. He could not allow Blaise, his friend, to continue down this train of thought. Draco, he should, he could, help him. But at what risk?
He was being tested.
If Draco had a week he wouldn't be able to list all of the reasons why not. He lowered his wand. He didn't have a lot of options. "Nice to meet you," he shook Black's hand. His nails were filthy.
"What do you mean?" his voice was full of gravel. Talking to Potter was like falling.
Potter nudged Draco's shoulder with his, "What's wrong?" he asked.
"Remind me again why I'm doing this."
"She's nothing much in looks considering her personality," Draco humored dryly.
"You know we're fucked, right?" she asked, only halfway done with her smoke.
Draco nodded, pulling out his handkerchief, handing the fabric to Theo. Theo wiped his face. "You're brave," Draco assured him.
She eventually asked, "You don't seem like the sort of guy to get into fights."
How much blood would be on his hands when this war ends?
"No, but I'm the only one who makes sense, don't I?" he confided.
Draco's chest ached with how much he missed the late nights the pair of them spent by the fire. He missed the feeling of Potter's warmth at his side. He longed for the sweet laughter that would be shared only between the two of them. He wanted to wrap himself in Potter. Have Potter hold him until he was finally able to heal his own scared soul that was ripping him apart inside out. "I wasn't aware that you knew the deceased," he stated instead of all the words he knew he would choke on.
"You talk to Dumbledore?" Potter asked, his voice quiet as he broke through Draco's thoughts.
(See the end of the chapter for
Astoria scrambled to stand. She rushed across the creek, the water coming to her knees. She looked so young in the too large cloak that had been her sister's. Her eyes were wide at the sight of her sister's murder. She opened her mouth, but she was past words. Tears flowed down her face as she glared at Draco.
Sirius nodded, "It's such a shame. Dumbledore should have protected her."
Potter leaned forward and kissed him.
“You forget this year.”
"Hey," Draco woke surprisingly easily, Potter was leaning over the back of the couch over him. Draco moved to sit up, drawing his knees up to his chest as Potter took the seat next to him on the couch.  Potter passed the two opened chairs, Draco noted with a warm feeling not coming from the warmth of the fire. The feline monster was nowhere to be seen, probably had left when Draco fell asleep.
"Shit," Draco had left his bookbag in the Great Hall.
They didn't agree to meet tonight, but Draco rose from his bed anyway. He grabbed his cloak he had laid out on his trunk earlier, slipping his shoes on and leaving the dorm as quietly as he could. He made sure to also bring his bag, which had healing potions Potter might need as well as his dinner that Draco managed to grab from the Great Hall.
"Oh! Look at me! I'm Harry Potter and I'm a massive dickhead!" Potter avoided, his eye were wide in embarrassed panic.
"I didn't say handsome exact-"
Draco nodded, "Yes, thankfully my father managed to use his influence at the Ministry to intervein before a student was hurt."
"Wordless."
The two boys enjoyed the simple act of walking without any roles to play, not saying anything, using the setting sun and the deep blues to hide behind. This had become a weekly routine, one which Draco enjoyed, however pathetic it may be. Zabini had yet to converse with any of the other students for more than a couple of minutes since returning to Hogwarts from the summer break.
With a dry laugh he responded, "I have to be, don't I?"
Draco smiled at his name, the man was complimenting him. He followed the smoke billow from the man's lips.
"They're awfully hideous, aren't they?" Blaise asked.
Perhaps Lucius was struggling with whatever task their Lord had given him.
Pansy turned back to room. Draco stepped in between her and everyone else. He was so tired of fighting.
"I needed you, dickhead," she growled.
He pulled his hand away from her, rubbing his face. His eyes glancing at where Potter had been sitting.
So, when Draco caught them selling makeshift inventions to other students in the Owlery, did he walk away, realizing that the Weasley twins were, in fact, fucking twins and therefore automatically outnumber him? Unfortunately he had not thought that far. Now, he was fucked.
“I missed you,” Potter was always ready to take the first step.
It was a bold move, Draco had to admit, giving your enemy all of the power just to see how they play. It was a smart move.
"Well, fuck you, you tiny genius," he tensed, impressed.
Would he have to poison his friend to ensure she wasn't actioned off to the highest bidder?
He got out of bed, putting on his dark blue cloak that brings out his eyes over his grey sleepwear. Getting dress in proper robes was too risky. Leaving his dorm and the Common Room was easy, no one was out this late. The night was heavy, as he heard crying. He usually wouldn't have investigated, but it was the sort or crying that touched your soul. The followed the sound to the girls lavatory, half expecting who was crying. He peaked in, using a listening charm to advance his hearing so he wouldn't have to enter.
"My Lord, no-"
"Asshole," but Potter was grinning at him as he said it.
Their plan had gone to absolute shit.
Potter's hand was tight around his as he lead them into a small office off of the original room. Draco stood closely behind Potter. The sounds of Rabastan's screams ringing in his ears. With the hand that wasn't in Potter's, Draco clutched the back of Potter's shirt. Like he never did with his mother's skirts, vulnerable. He just needed for his hands to stop shaking. How was everyone so calm?
Draco could barely see Potter through the sea of black cloaks. Potter and his friends were circled by Death Eaters. All in dark cloaks and masks in the shape of sculls. Draco's stomach dropped when he saw his father's blond hair. He was still doing their Lord's bidding? His father had been so shaken after…after Draco had killed Daphne. Yet he stood tall, towering in front of Potter. He wasn't leaning on his cane, he must have taken a potion for mobility.
"Pansy?"
"It was a joke right?" he asked.
Draco was surprised when he had entered the room to find the most hideous feline creature he had seen in his life. The creature was sitting in front of the fire, basking in the warmth. Whenever Draco had allowed himself to enter, assuming the room was empty, the creature simply blinked at him before going back to sleep. The feline appeared to be thoroughly domesticated.
Draco and Longbottom turned the corner only to be met by the rest of Potter's group.
Montague stood from the floor. "You bitch-" he yelled at Daphne, jumping over the couch.
He entered the supply closet, all the ingredients neatly labeled and alphabetized. Draco began to look for what he needed, working quickly. Pansy entered behind him, seeming nervous. Draco found what he was looking for. Under the 'V's', was Doxy Venom in a glass bottle, as pure Doxy Venom could only be held in glass.
Potter winced at his words, or perhaps at his tone of voice. He lowered his eyes as Draco reminded him where exactly they were. They weren't in the safe bricked walls of their home. They were in the middle of a frozen lake, the ice cracking around them under their feet. "I knew her from school," Potter's voice shook.
"Potter, I'm sorry-"
"You see, Mr. Malfoy, I don't believe you are being honest with me."
Potter tried to push him away, "No, I don’t want you to be burdened with me-"
There was no one here to read a thought that had simply crossed his mind. There was no one here watching him. There was no need for Draco to so carefully force himself to blend in with the background.
The Dark Lord watched this trembling girl beg for her young life. He said nothing as Daphne worked herself in a panic at his silence. Her sobs scratched against the skulls of the crowd, echoed against the high ceilings. Draco's stomach lurched into his lungs, but he wouldn't allow himself to turn away. He owed her that.
"I always worry about you Harry, it's ok," he hushed.
Nothing but to wait for the inviable.
"I- I just can't believe, what? How? When?.... Shit," Daphne eloquently explained.
A better question, but still a stupid one.
"Obviously, Goyle, he will tell us when we have proven ourselves worthy of his trust," Pansy hissed.
After Potter entered, Draco motioned for him to remain quiet as Draco placed an Imperturbable Charm on the door. Draco tried to ignore the shaking of his hands, he did his best to appear confident and in control, not as if this very conversation could cost him and his family their lives.
"Fuck off Montague!" Daphne snapped, Draco woke in a shock. He didn't move from his place on the couch. Montague was standing above them, stepping on Theo's notes. Theo seemed to curl in on himself, arms around his knees.
Her eyes narrowed at the sight of her sister's killer. Draco's head felt the caress of pain from where she had thrown a rock at him. The blood rushed to his ears. His words snuffled in his throat. What could he say to her?
Shit. "My apologies, I seemed to have forgotten my manners." Draco excused.
Draco had known what he meant. A cold grip had taken hold of his ribs and squeezed, had spread to his arms and legs until he was numb everywhere. Draco had stayed there, frozen to the spot, watching the intimate moment of Cedric's father mourning his son. The other students moved around him, unnoticed in the background.
Draco rushed into History, hurrying to shake off the glances being sent his way by anyone who knew of his betrothal. He took his usual seat at the back of the classroom. The seat next to him remained empty. He was one of the few students here this early.
"Have you seen him?" Potter laid his hand on the mark as he looked up at Draco. His other hand entered Draco's, holding him. Grounding him. All of Potter's attention focused on Draco, who still smoked with his free hand. "If you want to talk about it."
"Merlin, Potter. What's the gossip?" Draco demanded.
A snort escaped Draco's noise before he could stop. The look Potter gave him caused laughter to be ripped from Draco's chest. Potter's shoulders shook as he asked, "Did you just snort?"
"Headmaster Dumbledore adjusted the room more to my liking," their new Professor explained. "Do come in."
His wand, where was Draco's wand?
Severus had a few choice words to say to that attitude, but Madam Pomphrey sent him out of the room so Draco could rest.
The official story was that Daphne drowned in the pound of the estate. Draco didn't know how they managed to convince the Ministry of a death without a body to prove the source.
"I live with my aunt and uncle," Potter broke the silence, still not looking at Draco but stayed within his grasp. "And I don't know what I did, but they… they ignore me," Potter took a deep shaking breath, "They hate me." Draco kissed his head. "I don’t know what I did, but they hate me so much." Potter didn’t start crying, but Draco could hear the disappointment in his voice.
"Just being polite," Draco sighed. "We have to tolerate each other, make appearances."
"Good, hold tightly now," he stated, as simply as if he was making sure she didn't drop her milk.
"Almost as if there's actual consequences for his actions, unheard of," Daphne mumbled next to him.
"I'm not your mate, prick," Finnigan dismissed Draco's olive branch. The class fell into a hush. Draco was known for going for the throat, an act of mercy was not his usual response. Draco frowned as casually as he could, keeping the sharpness out of his voice, "You've made that clear." Finnigan fumed, but Draco couldn't tell what had set him off in the first place, he had no clue about how to handle this.
Dumbledore continued, "Perhaps deep down you want someone to hurt you, as a way to make up for your sins."
Draco looked up from his textbook. Daphne pulled out the chair next to him. Draco had taken to studying at the small table in corner hidden by the stairs, the most privacy could be found here.
“That still doesn’t seem like a decent reason to poke the dragon,” was the older boy’s reply.
"And what circumstances would those be, Professor?" he asked innocently.
Alfie looked between the two of them. "Um, I think I left my glitter pens upstairs," she explained as she left.
"I have no idea what you're talking about sir," he stated. He wanted to hear Severus say how wrong he was to leave children alone in this war. He would make him say it. After all, would any of this have been necessary if someone reached out to the students? Would he have to marry at seventeen? Be engage at fifteen? Witness murder at fourteen?
McGonagall inspected the sweet, "I see."
"Why, yes, I wasn't expecting you. I would have cleaned up," Potter stepped into the shack as he motioned around the dusty house. "I hope you don't mind a bit of mess."
Theo was out the door.
Draco pushed down his hot anger, he couldn't afford the attention. He breathed through his temper, fighting back the hot spike in his stomach. He wanted to fight.
Potter pushed open a random door. Draco shut the door behind them. Their backs against the smooth wood. Their breaths loud.
He also happened to throw another pebble.
"Damn it Daphne, this is way we can't have nice things," Draco pretended to scowled her to a classroom full of laughter. The class broke into chatter. Draco looked towards Professor Firenze, who was just staring into the circle of ash. His shoulders slumped, his hands worked together in front of him. He looked twenty years older.
Potter looked down instantly, his chin quivering. "You’re nothing like your father," Potter argued.
The Dark Lord chuckled, "Of course."
"Yes, I'm…" Potter sighed, "I'm a mess." Pity stabbed Draco's heart. Of course Potter wanted control, there was so much out of his. Draco was only about to take more options away from him. Potter finished with his hand, but Draco didn't pull away.
Is this a date? Draco did not ask. "Are you wearing cologne?" That wasn't much better.
They didn't hold hands as they made their way to the Shrieking Shack.
"It feels like it," Potter opened the door to shack. Draco shoved his feelings about being here aside.
That would be too much of a fucking privilege, but also the worst sin he could commit in a long line of sin.
"Yes, but you had a good reason."
"So I guess you two are more than friends."
Potter stood, "I don't really know, I guess I focused on… anger?"
"Oh, please, Astoria. They would have offered me up to anyone to save their own asses," Daphne snapped.
Draco's stomach twisted, his hands started to sweat as Potter walked over to him. Draco could sense his parents tense on either side of him. One wrong move, Draco would get all of them killed. "Potter," he ensured that no familiarity, no warmth, was in his voice. His face contorted into a sneer of displeasure.
He let himself relax for the first time since he had gotten off this train a little over a week ago. Just a little over a week ago, and Draco's life had tilted to an impossible angle.
Cho Chang and Susan Bones stood in the middle of the room.
Greyback steadied him with a heavy gaze, sizing him for his words. Draco just continued to smoke. Greyback gave him a knowing smile as he seemed to have found whatever comradery he thought was in Draco. "How would you know, you probably haven't even been in a fist fight."
"You have to get used to it," was Daphne's only comment.
Draco clawed at the memory weakly, his Mother gripped his mind tighter, making him reply the events of that night to her.
"…No. We just have to make sure to play nice. It'll be helpful to be seen together every one in a while."
"Then you have nothing to prove, but your enthusiasm is noted," his Lord forgave.
Dumbledore nodded, "You are correct."
"Cunt on a warpath," Crabbe grumbled.
"Necessary for what?" Dumbledore asked. He was leading Draco to the answer he wanted to hear. Draco rubbed his face, thinking of a way out of this. He knew the consequences before he attacked Finnigan, the pros had out weighted the cons. What he hadn't considered, stupidly, was how invested Dumbledore would be to the reasoning. Draco would have preferred for the Professor to look at the problem for the face-value, not looking into the core.
Draco felt Potter's hand on his arm. He forced himself not to tremble under his touch. Thankfully, Potter let him go.
Draco broke into a run. Fuck his wand.
But what if Potter did come by and Draco wasn't there? Would Potter assume that Draco didn't want to talk to him? Would Potter get angry with him?
"Daphne has been acting awfully strange lately, is there any reason why?" Pansy whispered mid-way through the lecture.
Dolohov's hand was on Potter's collar. Potter thrashed against the hand at his throat, his eyelids fluttering from lack of air.
"Fuck!" a voice rang out as Draco fell to the ground. He hit the brick floor with a sickening crack in his shoulder and instantly started to roll himself away from where he landed. His instincts were right, a ball of fire scorched the ground where he had been.
Their lips gently brushed against each other, not exactly a kiss, but almost.
The amount of eyerolling Potter managed to pull off was almost more impressive than annoying. "We talk, Draco. Remember? The DA?"
"Everyone, just calm down," Draco watched has his father raised his hands in a false sign of goodwill. Lucius stepped forward slowly, all while filling Potter's head with lies.
"I didn't use my wand," Draco started carefully, "because the result would have been less than satisfactory."
"I didn't lose to Potter. He cheated." Draco corrected as he shut his book.
"We'll all end up walking at this rate-" Draco sighed as he made his way to the carriage.
He probably wouldn't live that long.
"I wouldn't be able to kill you without you wanting me to, sir," Draco stated the facts coolly.
Draco unsure fear quickly turned to a hot rod of anger in his stomach, "And I supposed you would know of unfit coyness, wouldn't you?"
"I have yet to decide the fate of the Greengrass family. I'll have to investigate their loyalty," his Lord explained.
Having her join the DA would be dangerous. Risking her life just to have control over her. Could Draco trust her? Daphne was smart enough to know of her situation. Manipulating her into joining the DA would be risky, would she see threw Draco? Then their relationship would be ruined beyond repair. The only person Daphne cares about is her sister, Astoria.
Draco sighed, "It’s fine," he spoke in truth.
"Draco-" Daphne whispered behind him, her hand grazing his arm.
"I'm sure Theo would enjoy your company," Draco agreed, feeling Theo's anger in his back.
"Pansy!" Draco squeaked.
Daphne froze.
“Vulnera Sanentur,” Draco continued, ignoring the sound of the girl hissing between her teeth. The blood returned to the wound, while the skin loosely knitted itself together. Her skin was together enough to stop the bleeding, but that was all.
The pair walked their way around the manor's grounds. Draco discussed his classes. The Dark Lord kept up with the conversation with genuine attention. Draco found himself talking more with his Lord than he had with anyone since his return to the manor. The Dark Lord asked him about Quidditch. He even admitted to never having played the sport himself.
He accepted the pain with open arms.
"Did Snape make you tea in thanks?" Goyle teased.
"War is coming," Daphne took his hands, "We have to be ready, you have to prepare us."
"Really? You didn't get arrested or…?"
"What do you do to earn you that?" Theo broke the silence that had encircled the Slytherin table.
Draco stared at Potter. Potter opened his mouth, closed his mouth, looked down at his feet, shuffling. "I was worried about you," Potter mumbled.
"No one," Potter squeaked.
"Fucking get out of here!" she shoved them to the exit.
Which, naturally, made Severus only taunt Draco more.
Crabbe, in all his social graces, shoved Blaise. Blaise was caught by Bulstrode with ease, and somehow managed stay on his feet. They were starting to gain a crowd.
There wasn't a soul in sight, but he could hear voices.
"Malfoy," Severus interrupted. Draco slouched at the unsaid order.
The feeling of Cho's glances made his face itch. What did she want? When her glances turned into stares, he shot a glare at her. She mumbled an apology and turned back to her book that was open on the ground in front of them. They were studying the planets today. Could the planets foretell the fate of earth as they looked down on the occupants? Divination was a waste of his time.
Potter sent a glare in his direction, Draco bit his lip, trying to hide his smirk. This was fun.
Draco watched as Potter and Weasley helped Finnigan to his feet, letting him sit in a chair that Granger had conjured.
"Hmm?" was Potter's response, his eyes following Draco's mouth.
"What do you mean?" Draco inquired.
"You waited," Draco noted, his voice quiet at the proximity of Potter.
"Oh, thank Merlin," he relaxed.
"My Lord," he started. He had to pass, he had to gain his Lord's favor. The manor loomed in front of them, casting long shadows. "About my father…" The Dark Lord steadied him with a heavy gaze. Draco's chest was being coiled by anxiety. "I'm not sure of his mission… but I know that he's disappointing you. I won't. I promise."
The quite, dark dorm was easy to slip out of. Draco had changed into some casual robes. The dark blue ones that bring out his eyes.
He had used the excuse of needing to focus on his assignments to stop doing his Prefect rounds. Severus had not been pleased, but had eventually agreed when Draco purposely flunked a few assignments across all of his subjects. Draco had pulled every book on Occlumency and Legilimency from the library. When he had gone through those without much found, he had turn to texts that weren't allowed in Hogwarts.
"All in a couple months work," Draco replied. He didn’t need Dumbledore's approval.
"What's wrong with Pansy?" he asked.
Potter had missed Draco.
"I'm not scared of you, Draco," Potter snapped, "I'm jealous of you."
There was no way he could have seen the second person hiding behind the corner.
"Perhaps you were pressured to be liked by your peers? Or perhaps you were swept away by the romance of sneaking around school grounds. Or perhaps you just truly did not understand the weight of your actions," he thought of random excuses. Daphne nodded, her head still lowered. "I'm inclined to believe you, my dear. Believe that this was just one little mishap."
Draco woke with a gasp. "What the fuck?" he spoked into the curtains.
Severus was keeping him in the dark. Draco suspected that whatever information Severus was keeping from him, and Potter by proxy, wasn't due to his own judgment. Dumbledore was the one in charge.
Potter nodded, Draco hoped that this would be enough of an explanation for him. "Okay," Potter agreed, "okay, I can understand."
Pansy slapped him across the face, breathing deep with adrenaline.
Draco's anger was in the form of an ice pick in his heart. "Father," he stated coolly. All three adults turned to the forgotten child. "We are at a funeral," he reminded his father, "remember your manners."
"Bella," Narcissa stepped forward.
So, of course, he went. The chance of meeting Potter, seeing him, was too important.
He could only watch as his world fell apart.
"Alfie, drop it."
If Draco could just find out what Dumbledore was hiding, then he might have a breakthrough with Potter's lessons. This is how Draco had found himself in the library during his free period.
Somehow, that fact was comforting to both of them.
Draco walked straight to the stall, placing a hand on the door to enter.
"His father almost died over the break, that’s what," Daphne snapped.
"How?" Potter asked.
She was tenacious.
"Just us three and Harry," Dumbledore answered with ease.
Draco didn't move.
Draco took his favorite table under a window in the back, taking advantage of the unoccupied library due to the odd time of study. The thick leather books from Severus's personal collection had yet to be helpful. Draco was currently focusing on one particular, an in depth explanation of Dark Magic.
He was only going to be able to keep this up for so long. He knew that, but if he waited long enough, he would be back in the Manor. Where fear could override his need to grieve. Then the ability to feel would be taken away from him. He could return to the cold distance he was able to wrap himself into. The cold was easier than pain.
Astoria lead him much farther than he was expecting. His stomach was squeezed. His shoulders straightened with focus. What was so important that Astoria needed him alone? Was she safe? Had someone attacked her like him? He remained silent as they continued deep into the castle. The halls became darker as less torches were lit in the barely used corridors. Mold climbed up the bricks as they entered the dungeons of the castle. Astoria took out her wand to provide light for the rest of the journey. Draco had never been this deep in the dungeons before, they would certainly be alone.
Dumbledore clasped his hands behind his back. "Malfoy, I want you to be safe. I know you to understand the dangers you are putting yourself, and your family at," Dumbledore explained, as if to a child.
"Blaise?" Draco whispered.
He wouldn't accept her kindness. He was a coward. Staying for the expected abuse was easier than leaving for the unexpected. He was warmed, however, by her small token.
"-the cat, darling, keep up."
Draco searched his knife, needing to focus on a task. The knife Potter had given him. The weapon was covered in blood, and rested in the pool of raw still growing from Daphne's seeping neck. He reached out to pick up the knife, only to blink at the sight of his bloodied hand. His heart tightened. His breath shallow. His spine tingled in danger.
"Um," Patil pursed her lips in thought, "well, a convoluted image could mean an unsure future. I'm not sure about the blood."
"Because she's Pansy," Draco supplied. Their laughter was cut off by a familiar voice from behind Draco.
Potter would make a good ally. Draco could trust him.
He had even ground now. Spell after spell he sent to his assailants. He spent the summer training for battle, he was sure he could handle two students, but he wanted this to end. The moment he could, he broke into a run down the hall as he conjured snakes to deal with his assailants.
"Would you like to sit down?" Draco asked, as if entertaining a guest at the Manor, something the Malfoy's haven't done in almost a year.
Draco shouldn't. 'Of course,' he replied, his heart in his ears.
His hands were shaking. Tears pricked at the corner of his eyes. He made himself blink them away. Draco touched the handle of his wand strapped to his thigh.
"Yeah, I know," Draco whispered despite the thundering of his heart against his ears.
"You scared me," Potter seemed surprised as Draco by his words. "The way you fought, I wanted to pull you off, but I couldn't stop… watching." Draco let go of Potter's hand. "I thought you weren't going to stop." Draco didn't speak. Potter now knew of the part of him that was twisted. Draco had shown too much of his soul. Potter continued with his work of Draco's hand. "But when you did," Potter went on, "when you did stop you were so… cold."
Draco turned back to Professor Binns, who was lecturing about the Giant Wars. Giant Wars, how interesting, he should pay attention.
Daphne didn't answer him, only gave him a smile that told him she had him right where she wanted. She nodded towards a shop, letting Draco lead her, as were her manners for a date.
"No, it's okay," Potter dismissed.
Daphne didn't scream, but she did cry. He just ate. His forearms covered in her blood. He watched as her lungs expanded in panic. Her hands shook when he sliced a part of her away. She tasted like sorrow.
"I'm the worst. I come here, ruin your quality time with Bentley-"
Potter gently stirred, opening his eyes, the realization of where he was showing shortly after. Potter smiled up at him, Draco's cheeks turned warm at the sight as he returned the gentle smile.
“No one,” Draco answered in truth. Daphne was there for him in ways no one else was, but Draco knew that her true intentions laid with protecting her sister. Draco didn’t go to her more than absolutely necessary.
Draco sighed, his chest light. "Give her time, Potter, she's grieving, and so are you."
"Oh…is it hard?" Crabbe continued. He started to pick at the skin on the palms of his hand.
Potter's pathetic smile pained him. "It's nothing," Potter answered.
Severus glared at Draco, he was waiting for an answer. Draco wanted to live through this class, so he kept his mouth shut and eyes down cast.
"Well, who doesn't?"
"Just listen first," Draco begged. His stomach coiling, but not from hunger. When Potter nodded in agreement, he continued. "I don't think your connection with the Dark Lord is caused by regular magic," he began. "Frankly, I think I've shown you all that I can with what information I have to work with."
"He's not Fred, I'm Fred, he's George," Fred argued.
The two left the room without saying another word. The halls were cold compared to The Room of Hidden Things, no lanterns were lit to provide light or heat. Draco turned to Potter, but couldn't say anything. Something had shifted in their relationship, permanently. The weight of this caused silence on Draco's part. Potter seemed to feel the same. The two stood there, feeling this change between them, saying nothing.
"Ah, yes well, let me just tidy a bit here-" Potter rushed around as he tried to clean a place for them to sit.
He worked on his notes for his ideas to fix the cabinet. This notebook would go back into the Room of Requirement whenever he was completed with his research for the day. He was too paranoid to walk around with this information for longer than he had too.
When a letter dropped for Pansy, Draco instantly tensed. The lettering was definitely Pansy's mother, this could not be good. Pansy didn't receive any letters, but she didn't send any either. Her mother would only begin communications if the news was dire. Pansy must have known this, as she just stared at the envelope. Draco reached for her hand, but Pansy snatched the letter quickly. She didn't open the letter, just stuffed the message into her robe pocket. She continued to eat her toast with a slump in her shoulders. Daphne took her hand, Pansy didn't look up.
The other three were frozen under a jinx on the floor. Forgotten. Two Death Eaters now circled Draco, who was only able to rise to his knees with the force of the blows thrown at him.
Movement from across him made him glance up. No one else was usually here this late.
"The Golden Boy, detention? Unheard of," Pansy teased.
"No, but appearing to put in the work doesn't hurt."
Severus dragged the desk chair to the widow. He settled across from Draco, but didn't say anything, he just looked down at his hands.
His breathing was the only sound heard as he walked into a large circular area. Tall ceilings with curved walls made the light from the low torches ribbon across the smooth bricks. Draco's heart clenched. This was what the bottom of the well would look like. He was at the bottom.
How could she be expected to handle herself? How was she handling the questions that weren't being asked? Their engagement was open, yet private. Everyone knew, but only but whispers in the corners, never out loud.
He ignored the look Pansy gave him, he also ignored the unsightly gestures she kept making throughout the lecture. His skin was itching to talk to Potter. How was he? Why did he leave Hogwarts early for break? Questions wouldn't leave Draco's thoughts, and he couldn't answer these questions or logically explain them. He was stuck in his own swirl of thoughts and concerns. Draco was forced to pay attention in class. He would compare the experience to pulling his own teeth out with a spoon through his eyes.
Pansy would have to appear to be held back by an enviable force, her health perhaps. This was a dangerous line to toe. Whispers are inevitable, but if people suspect Pansy would follow in the pattern set by her father, then the whispers would become gossip, then rumors.  Her health could not suddenly falter without rumors.
Any ideas are welcomed.
"Yeah," was all he could croak. He took Potter's hands from his shoulders. "You're bleeding," Draco noted, his head felt heavy.
"Astoria," a too familiar voice spoke from behind Draco.
He blinked. The dog grew into a man. The man was wearing a long dark coat. Tattoos lined his chest and neck. Draco couldn't see his arms. Long black hair was tied back into a loose bun. Sirius Black.
Draco couldn't take anymore, he left into the night.
"How long have you been waiting?" Draco greeted.
His parents, probably her parents.
Pansy's face redden, her lips tight. At least Draco had managed to distract her from putting the pieces together.
Draco gently sat next to Potter. "I missed your birthday over the summer."
Their Lord.

Someone in the castle wanted Draco to hurt badly enough that they attacked him. Hurting people is hard, that's what no one had told Draco. That was a lesson he had to learn for himself. Hurting others can hurt you. It gets easier, as time goes on, to numb yourself, to put your heart into a cold place inside yourself for protection.
Daphne pushed his feet off of her lap suddenly, storming off to the girl's dorm. Draco looked up at Pansy for guidance. She gently motioned for him to sit up, she followed Daphne up to their dorm. Draco wished he could follow, repair whatever damage he made, but he couldn't get into the girl's dorm.
"You son of a bitch," Theo finally swallowed the mouth full of toast.
"Thanks for the help," Draco smiled as he grabbed the rest of his things. He didn’t turn around at Pansy's protest as he left the library for dinner.
"Yes," Draco answered.
Draco's hand tightened on the door knob. Maybe if he just runs they wouldn't chase him. Undeniable proof? Who's words would Dumbledore take as truth? Potter. Why would Potter tell Dumbledore and not Draco? Something happened, something bad.
"A boy?" the words are out of his mouth before he could stop them. Fuck. Shit. He needed to sew his mouth shut.
Draco chewed, thinking back. He almost choked. "Ah, shit, just forget about it," he stumbled. His neck hot.
Severus stepped out from the shadows. With a wave of his wand, he cleaned the spilled tea and the over-turned chair. He walked to where Draco to was standing, healing the cut on his cheek, but unable to heal the wounds in Draco's heart. "I can sta-"
"What does that matter?" Draco heard Severus mumble from the corner. Dumbledore kept his gaze on Draco.
Potter stepped out from behind the shadows from the tall trees. Draco’s shoulders slumped. His heart sped up. With one concern look from Potter, he could almost be washed away of this pain of this spring break.
Daphne rolled her eyes as they walked along the path to Hogsmead. "I'm not some beggar, Draco, your family wouldn't let you marry a peasant after all."
Weasley two months ago and Granger in third year. Draco didn't answer, but just shrugged as he leaned against the brick of the manor. Greyback paced as he smoked, the conversation flowing easily between them.
"She just tripped, Professor," Draco stated innocently, before pulling his arm out of the tight grasp that held it.
"It was brilliant, really, except for Umbridge," Potter answered with ease.
"How is your father?" Umbridge asked.
She didn't look good, her hair was in disarray, un-brushed on the top of her head. Her uniform was wrinkled, there was an old, musky smell about her. Draco guessed she hadn't changed for cleaned herself since yesterday, maybe before. Daphne was right, he should have taken her warning more seriously.
There was no policy that prisoners couldn't write letters to their families in Azkaban. No one ever received letters though. At first Draco thought it was because the wardens wouldn't provide owls to the prisoners. In truth, Draco didn't think any of the prisoners could master the energy to write to their love ones while being fed on by Dementors. He had asked Farley for a favor and she provided.
Blaise rolled his eyes, "Don’t make me feel cheap, Malfoy. I got what you needed. It's on your trunk." Draco handed over the money he owed. "Do I want to ask why you couldn't go shopping yourself?"
"I didn't think to, sir," Draco answered. Even if he had gone to Dumbledore, this was a problem only Draco could handle with his own fist.
"No, it's not okay. I shouldn't snap at you," Potter insisted, "I just don't know what to do."
He turned back to Severus, who just motioned for him to continued.
"Really, Malfoy, you're awful. You know I can't share Ministry secrets," Umbridge dismissed, "but I will tell you that if Dumbledore doesn't get his act together soon, someone will be in for a promotion."
"Is my only accomplishment going to be children that I don't want with a man that I don't love?" Daphne had said.
His stomach sunk into his feet when he caught Potter's eye. He stopped walking. Potter stared at him. Draco's  lungs filled with cold air as he took a deep inhale. Potter turned back to his date.
"That prophecy has all the answers-"
His wand. Draco rushed to the table. Pushing the books, papers, and ink to the floor in his search.
Severus pushed himself off, now pacing behind the desk. "You are going to get yourself killed, and for what? A boy that doesn't even care about you enough to realize what danger you are in?" he yelled.
Draco grinned, "Since when do you care what he thinks?"
No one was in the silent Common Room. Leaving the Common Room and slipping into the dark, silent dungeons was easy. The walk to the Room of Hidden Things was an uneventful one, but a chill had taken hold of Draco's bones. Draco was sure his uneasiness had nothing to do with the temperature.
He nearly jumped out of his skin whenever he felt something brush his leg. The hideous cat from before was staring up at him. He hissed at the creature, who licked their lips with a tilt of their head. He tried to shoo the cat away, but the thing just sat down, staring up at him with their beady, ugly eyes.
A bad taste in his mouth was left as he watched the Weasleys say goodbye to each other. Mrs. Weasley patted Potter on the cheek after wrapping him in a tight hug.
Draco sat on a desk, trying not to get defensive. "I've been covering for Potter," he started. He told her everything, how he had been covering for the DA, how Potter confronted him, how the two had met last night. The more Draco talked the more scared Daphne looked. By the end, she had started to smoke, not caring about the smell or the ash. She was pacing when Draco finished, walking back and forth between the desks, the smoke from her cigarette filling the air.
"Why don't you go talk to someone more on your intellect level? Perhaps the first years?" Daphne reprimanded. She still hadn't bothered looking up from her reading, but her voice was deadly.
"Language Draco," Severus corrected.
-the question was how long they could survive.
"Potter-"
He didn't have any time to take out his wand as he was forcefully shot into the air. He almost touched the high ceiling of the halls before he started to plummet. His stomach dropped as gravity yanked him to the ground.
Draco lounged across the couch the Room had supplied him. After finding the two books Mafalda had recommended to him in the library, he had spent a couple of hours finishing his homework before leaving to the Room. The couch was soft, comfy, and an awful shade of orange. Similar to the color of the fur coat of its host.
Wherever Potter went, he was meant to follow.
Draco took the opening, “You do not have to promise me anything, Potter, I trust you.”
Potter gave him a smile with sad eyes. "Draco…." he paused.
Mafalda laughed at his response, "You did read the first two of the volumes?" she supplied.
Potter sighed, "I wish I could keep you safe."
"Exactly what have you lost, Severus?" Draco tilted his head, "What caused you to switch sides? If you ever did, that is." If Severus moved his hands from Draco shoulders to his throat, he wouldn't have been surprised. Draco tilted his head, hot blood ran through his veins at the challenge. "I have my reasons, and you have yours. Let's just keep it at that," he ordered.
"What's going on Draco?"
"I promise," Draco swore.
“What’s your name?” he spoke gently to her, he kept his body language neutral, as to not scare her.
"Language," Severus noted.
Daphne stiffened beside him. The message was as clear to her as it was to him. Really, this was just a confirmation of their suspicions. Their betrothal ceremony would be over the winter break, in a little over a month.
"Alright Potter, what makes you so-" Draco smelt food. "Food," he stated. Potter giggled, "Where's the food, Potter?" he investigated. His stomach jumping at the idea of a meal. A hot meal.
"Mafalda, she's in Slytherin," Draco told Potter. Potter's lips pinched together at the information, his shoulders stiff. He would need some convincing. "She's a muggle born, she's in secound year and no one talks to her," he tried. "She stopped Montague from finding the DA today, she threw a cat at him."
"It's not 'same place, same time,' if we're both early," Potter greeted, he rubbed his hands on his pants. Potter was nervous.
"I know, I know!" he was slipping, he rubbed the back of his head. "That's why I need you," he reasoned.
"I think they want to tell me in person," he brushed off the accusation Daphne was implying. He would always defend his family with a knee jerk response. "Are you okay?" Draco asked stupidly.
---------------------
“I don’t know where we could meet, the Room of Requirement is out of the question.”
Potter shrugged, "Someone has told me recently that I am a very lucky man."
"My date literally was crying over her ex, who I saw being killed."
Daphne rolled her eyes, "You're no fun," she teased. Draco leaned back against the window. He could see out of the corner of his eye Daphne pull out her cigarettes. She locked the door with a quick, silent flick of her wand. Then, she handed Draco one. Draco took the smoke from her slender fingers, she cupped his face as she lit the cig as Draco held it between his lips.
Draco hurriedly collected his ingredients, his hands shaking with what he was about to do.
"The fuck…?" he muttered, hesitantly investigating the toilet.
"I mean, if you are devoted to him he will go through impossible lengths to help you," Sirius walked Draco through is thoughts.
Draco was hurried back to his room as soon as he wasn't actively bleeding. Potter had begged Dumbledore to let him stay in the infirmary. Draco had explained that this was for the best. No one would expect him of treachery if there wasn't anything to suspect.
"Who the fuck-"
Draco stood, walking to the couple of steps that led to the closet, he made sure to step over the doorframe that connected the steps to the door. People had been known to trip.
Murder.
Draco watched as Potter walked away from him. The weight was heavy on Potter's shoulders. What did Potter want from him? What did Draco want from Potter? He wanted Potter to be safe. That was it. Draco wanted Potter to be okay, and Draco knew Potter was safe over the summer.
No one can control death, and slicing someone's throat would kill anyone.
Potter stared at him.
"I'm sure I have no idea what you're talking about," Draco took the teasing, glad Daphne wasn't too angry over his earlier snap.
"I can promise you that I am more that necessarily qualified," Draco stated.
"Here, we can share." Cho sat next to him in Daphne's place.
Zabini stared, shaking. Any feelings Zabini had been pushing away flood to him, shoving their way up and out.
He was avoiding Potter with surprising ease. Potter was keeping himself busy with something that didn't include Draco. Draco was almost grateful.
His father pushed her away roughly, hand raised to strike her. "How dare you, you insolent-"
"Just studying," Draco busied himself with gathering the books on the table. He jumped when Pansy pressed against him from behind, her front flushed against his back.
This doesn’t mean that Draco approved of Potter's actions. Such as throwing a spell back at Snape during the first class of the year.
Draco's heart broke a little bit at the sight of him. "It doesn't make this easier, Potter."
Draco turned his focus to Potter and the problem he proposed. What Draco truly did not understand, was Potter’s undying resilience in the face of tragedy. Perhaps, Draco realized as he resumed his walk to class, that was the reason Draco underestimated Potter. True, Potter’s temper snapped more easily than in the past, but he was more observant than ever.
The rock hit the tree behind him. He should run, or cover his face. He could only stand there as another rock was thrown.
Dumbledore had casted a strong glamor over Draco while Madam Pomphrey cared for him. She had looked at him with such kind pity as she tended to him. How many children of war would she have to care for before this was done?
"You're scared, don't worry about it," Draco forgave instantly.
Fuck. He had to remember that she wasn't her sister. She wouldn't call him out on his shit.
Theo barked out in laugher, gripping his stomach and doubling over. "Oh, oh Merlin. That was bloody brilliant. Fuck," he wiped a stay tear from his eye.
He could feel breath on his lips. Draco watched as Potter's gaze fell onto his mouth before meeting his eyes again. The hand on his check moved to the back of his neck. Draco swallowed, his couldn't move. He didn’t want this to stop.
“Potter, listen to me very carefully, do not say a word,” Draco threateningly hushed. “I will let go of you, you will walk away, am I perfectly clear?” Frustration radiated from him as he clenched his teeth. Potter glared defiantly at the taller boy. Draco could always cause Potter to act on his temper, with his taunts and insults. Draco knew how to push Potter into any situation; with the right taunts, Potter can be malleable through his temper. Draco also knew how far Potter's temper can drive him, because his temper, his anger, drives his determination.
"Threatening a Ministry employee? Do I need to remind you of my reach?"
"And why was she carrying the venom when the ingredient wasn't needed for the potion?" Severus interrogated.
"What are you doing, Montague?" he asked. He had to know why Montague thought he had a base to challenge Draco's authority.
"Don't be daft."
Pansy loosened her grip, her hand slid down Draco's wrist and into his hand. He tightened his grip around her hand, trying to provide comfort in the pain she would soon endure by his doing.
Blink, “...yes?”
"Of course it is, I always enjoy your company," Draco comforted. Potter's eyes widened, the words having an effect on him. Draco should be embarrassed, but he couldn't find the shame within himself. Potter distracted him from himself, these meetings allowed Draco to escape from his own thoughts. Potter stayed silent, but Draco was steady in his honesty. "I don't know what I would do without you," Draco spoke.
He swallowed despite his dry mouth. "Daphne Greengrass. She was my betrothed, I should have seen the signs I'm sure were there."
"Yes Blaise, leave," Pansy sneered, coming up next to Crabbe, crossing her arms.
Potter  grinned, "don't worry, I was surprised too," he teased.
He had gotten lucky. So very lucky, but for how long?
After what the Weasleys had done for Draco, he hope they survived the next stages of a war they knew was coming.
"Malfoy." Draco didn't look up as his Professor stood before him. He couldn't force himself to swallow the pity he would find in his expression.
"Do you know when the burial starts?" a familiar voice asked from behind Draco.
Draco took a shaking breath, he didn't know what to say to her. Daphne simply wrapped her arm in his, locking their arms together as they walked. "I…" he started, but he didn't have anything to say.
He entered his shared dorm room, Crabbe and Goyal were sitting together on Goyal's trunk, talking. Theo was reading on his bed. Blaise had already closed his bedcurtains for the night, he was probably asleep. Draco dressed into his sleepwear. He made sure to pull out the note Potter had slipped to him from his uniform robes. Draco turned his back to his dormmates, slipping the note into his locked bedside table where he keeps all of the notes Potter had given him.
"That was costumes! This was music! They are very different," Draco argued, "now punch me in the stomach and make it look believable."
"Why, yes, Malfoy. It is. Thank you for noticing," Umbridge smiled primly.
"Artistic liberties, Potter. Artistic liberties."
Draco broke eye contact to look down at his meal. He continued eating for a while before excusing himself. Draco walked out of the room and into the hall, praying that Potter waited before following him out.
This was not going to go well. "Or I'll grab your trunk for you," Draco muttered as he cast a levitating spell on Potter's trunk.
Draco's hands tightened until his knuckles were white. "If you are trying to explain the risks of my situation, don't bother, I'm very aware of the dangers."
Montague placed a finger on his chin, appearing thoughtful. "What were their names again…?" he pondered. Draco struck.
"I'm sorry about Daphne," he wasn't looking up anymore.
"So she gets to be jealous about Hermione, out of all people, but she gets to bring up Roger Davies?" Potter vented.
Potter’s eyes widen at the sight of his godfather. He glanced at Draco, who wasn’t surprised at the transformation. “You two have met,” he observed.
"It's just," Draco bit his lip, Potter's face was still close to his, "what Pansy said, in front of everyone-"
"Mr. Malfoy, the fact of the matter is that you fought another student. Now, however regrettable, we are a school for young people, and tempers are sure to run high, resulting in disagreements that may get physical," Dumbledore lectured. "The point that I am most concerned about is the pure level of violence you have shown to be capable of. Violence of this level can be explained only by extreme circumstance, but you managed to channel that darkness for a mild inconvience. If I am being generous."
Draco swallowed, his face blushed as his eyes tickled with tears. This wasn't what he wanted. This wasn't what Pansy had agreed to. He had taken it too far, Pansy could die, the blame was on him. He should have done more research into Doxy venom, the case files in the library just hadn't been enough.
"Well, the medicine you gave me helped my hand a lot, thanks by the way, I was wondering if I could get some more?" asked Potter.
The table disappeared the containments of dinner, suppling a large bowl of warm water and a clean rag. Draco brought his hand up to the table. Potter rummaged through his bag, pulling out bandages and healing salves. "Why haven't you healed your hand yet? It'll take longer now," Potter lectured. Draco swallowed as Potter gently cleaned his hand. Potter's touch was light, as if Draco was made of glass.
He was finally safe. He could finally breath.
"Confringo!"
He did his best to appear somber as he found an empty stretch of wall. His expression was probably one of boredom that he cooled. If he allowed himself to feel his grief for a second, if he allowed himself to touch his own disgust with himself, he would crumble. Instead of digging into himself further, Draco watched the room.
Draco hadn't bothered asking why they were there, he wasn't yet capable of imagining the terror his own mother could inflict on her son. She led him to the basement, and he followed her with ease through the dusty, dark house.
"He informed be that you were making healing potions, some were quite advance," Dumbledore spoke.
Potter’s eyes widen with the easiness of Draco’s trust, not that Draco had a choice, but Potter was not that inclusive. All of that frustration and temperament that Draco had witnessed earlier today was gone, leaving a softer version of the Gryffindor.
Farley proved to be interesting. She wanted to help Draco. She wanted to get him out of this situation they both knew he was in. She didn’t even know him, not really, just a distant cousin of a friend of hers. And yet, she still reached out to him in kindness. Kindness is a discipline, and finding people who take the practice seriously are hard to kind.
"Maybe I am secretly a genius at potions and you never noticed."
He should end this. This wasn't going to end well for either of them. He should do the kind thing, the right thing, and stop seeing Potter.
Draco looked over at her, unsure of what she wanted. Daphne had her hair in a perfect braid down her back, she was wearing her pale blue cloak, the same one she had been wearing the night she showed her true colors to Draco. Daphne look beautiful, the cloak brought out her eyes.
Astoria was the opposite of Daphne in almost every way. Astoria had taken her father's dark brown hair and eyes, instead of their mother's fair blond hair and blue eyes. Draco couldn't remember ever seeing Astoria in a group outside of her sister's usual crowd. She was only seen with the Harper boy, who stayed clear of Draco's social circle. Draco had also seen her with the muggle girl, Mafalda, a few times.
"I won't let him," Draco instantly promised, a promise that he thought to be a lie.
"Cho hasn't really wanted to talk much," Potter allowed.
“Hi,” Potter smiled at him.
"Yes, I've known her since we were children."
He kept walking, not even slamming the door behind him so that Severus would have to shut the door himself. Draco kept walking, blood in his ears, his cheeks red in embarrassment. The boiling anger in his stomach turned into shame that seeped into his spine.
"So…." Blaise spoke into the silent compartment. Theo laid his head on Blaise's shoulder. Theo looked so tired, living under his father, living under his mother's murder, pressure placed on his thin shoulders.
"No one has a suggestion? Mrs. Patil, Madam Trelawney as told me you are quiet adept at Divination. Do you have any suggestions?" Firenze asked as he walked to behind the fire, his hands clasped behind his back. Daphne took her spot by Draco's side.
“I missed you so much,” Draco couldn’t keep his voice from shaking.
"Hey," Potter whispered back.
Potter entered the lavatory shortly after Draco, his footsteps being the only sound echoing against the titles. Silence cloaked the pair after Potter stopped to stand at a distance behind Draco. His spine tightened against the silence, against the awkwardness that was between them. Draco turned to face Potter, Potter's stance was sure, strong, ready for a fight. Draco wasn't going to argue with Potter, no matter how hard the fist that hit him.
Draco turned away from the moonless night sky. He leaned his back against the railing that hugged the edge of the tower. Potter would be here soon. Draco had come early, he wanted to time to think. He needed the time alone before the entered the battle field.
Draco opened his book so he didn't have to make conversation.
As soon as the door to the cart was locked, Potter climbed down from the above storage, removing the invisibility cloak.
Where was his textbook? His spine tickled as he rushed to find his book. When Draco didn't answer after Firenze repeated his name, his Professor just sighed. "Come see me after class," he was ordered.
His hands were bleeding. Blood spilling into his and Potter's clasped hands, but Potter didn't let go of him. Draco shoved Potter out of the way of a spell. Their bodies hitting the ground, only to be yanked up again by a furious woman with pink hair.
"This is above my pay grade," Draco mumbled, too tired to be bothered. He started making himself another plate, working around the distracted students before taking a seat next to Blaise. Blaise was sitting across from Bulstrode, at the far end of the table, separated from the other students. Bulstrode raised her eyebrows at him as he dug into his large pile of food.
"Don't you put that pressure on him, Albus, I won't stand for it," Severus defended Draco.
"He won't even look at me."
Panic settled deep in his spine. Crawling upwards into the base of his skull. He needed to calm down. Pansy would agree with his story, whenever she gets better. If she gets better.
The air had stirred. Movements in the shadows. Glances over wine. Hushed whispers behind closed doors. Draco could see but he wasn't allowed to watch. The Dark Lord had begun to spin his web. How was the question, but everyone knew what the goal was. To catch and devour Potter. Draco would only be able useless to help.
Thanks for all the support!! Hope this chapter breaks your heart ;)
Daphne only smiled at his distressed before turning to lead the way back onto the main street of town. The only sound between them was their footsteps on the cobbled path.
If he showed one flicker of how he truly felt, he would be the next child to die too soon. If he showed how he felt, Potter would be alone in his war to only fight from the outside in. If he gave away how his heart was bleeding onto the floor, Daphne's death would stand for nothing. He would not let any of that happen.
If Potter had a platform, maybe his voice, his story, could carry the call to war.
"Oh." Myrtle stayed next to him as he continued to cry. Who would she tell anyway? She was forgotten. Shoved away as an impossible inconvenience. She was just as lonely as he was.
"Come off it, Draco, answer the question," Potter stressed.
"Um…" Draco couldn't stop laughing, "it's-"
Daphne would be married off to her betrothed when she became of age, probably on her birthday to ensure quick pregnancy to further pure-blooded lineage. She probably wouldn't know who her future husband was to be until the betrothal ceremony. He was probably going to be a much older man, wouldn't be surprising if he already had children.
Potter did not like being ignored.
"Ew, no," Draco covered his ears with his hands. Theo kept talking as he started to push Draco out of the room. "This is my room," he argued.
He walked to sit next to Daphne, who was looking at him over her copy of the paper. Crabbe and Goyle stopped their talking. Draco scanned the room. Everyone was looking at him, their glances ticked his neck.
A deep breath filled Draco's lungs, as if he was trying to breath in the light that seeped from Potter's very essence. "I can't," he choked, his voice raw from the tears he was holding back.
--------------
Potter was sitting in between Longbottom and Weasley. Granger sat across from Weasley, giving Potter the perfect window to see the Slytherin. Potter enjoyed his stew, while Granger talked with Weasley about something or another. Longbottom was reading a large textbook, which, from his distance, Draco could guess the book was over Longbottom’s favorite subject; Herbology. Nobody was paying Potter any mind, nobody was paying Draco any mind, now was the time to make a move.
"Do you have a lot to say?" Draco instigated.
"Just a little longer."
Weasley was already stomping towards Draco, his face was red, but his eyes were confident. He had left his bookbag on the floor next to Granger, who was yelling something Draco wasn't paying attention to. Potter was scampering after his friend, trying to talk him down, but Weasley wasn't listening to sense. Weasley looked pissed. Beyond pissed, he seemed furious, Draco was right now the focus of that furry.
Draco let Daphne hug him for as long as she wanted, he needed her trust. He needed to seem vulnerable, Daphne knows him, he would have to be convincing. Draco smiled gently when she pulled away. She wasn't crying, but her jaw quivered.
A light touch caused Draco's skin to rise. "Sorry, is this ok?" Potter's movement froze when Draco had taken a glance at the feeling.
His heart tightened. "It's like I told the other professors-"
"Do you really expect us to?" Severus answered coolly. "You've proven yourself to be talented in the art of violence. Why wouldn't you want to find your own revenge?"
"Let me help you," he whispered. The words warmed his lips and felt like smooth apple cider  slipping down his throat to warm his ribs, his stomach and toes. He wanted to help Potter, he would allow himself to do this.
“I have a place in mind, can you meet me tonight?” Potter insistence was gentle.
The hurt in her eyes was clear as they widened. She had been under the impression that he would be trusting. He changed the subject, "Who did you come with anyway?"
He woke up a bit past lunch. His body was slow to start moving, his back ached in protest. He ignored the pain, he had work to do.
Potter. He was looking for Potter.
His nails were pulled from his body. His ears were pulsing from the pressure. His skin had millions of needles and thousands of bugs crawling across him.
He couldn't make himself stop. This unique self-torture was what kept him sharp. Not forgetting her was the fire in his soul, but that light was fading fast.
"So…Umm…." Potter swallowed. "If you want to talk about whatever is bothering you, just….talk?"
He looked like shit. The moonlight that shone  through the large windows  reflected against the pale tiles of the lavatory, giving Draco’s pale skin a sickly pallor as he looked in the mirror. There were bags under his eyes already turning  purple, serving only to emphasize  how thin he had gotten. Draco tried to think back to the last night he had gotten more than five hours of sleep, if he was lucky. He couldn't. Panic had taken its grip on him since last summer.
In the quiet of the night, after making sure he wasn't being followed, he would find his way to the Room of Hidden Things. The work on the cabinet was going slower than he was hoping for, but he would make enough progress to give his Lord something. An excuse for his failure.
He hid the Quibbler in his bookbag, not bothering to cast a charm to disguise the text. He would simply say that he had confiscated the banned magazine from another student if he was questioned.
He blinked.
Draco didn't press any further. And he didn't point out that Potter was the one that started talking in the first place, so it was really all his fault. He let the moment pass by as they walked in a familiar silence.
"And I brought new bandages, you need to wrap that tighter. But first use this potion on the wound," he lectured. He took the things out of his bag, but he couldn't dare look at Potter.
This was how most of the conversations had gone with Zabini as of late. Draco did his best to allow him to talk as little as possible, assuming the dark skinned student was trying to handle the rise of the Dark Lord and how this affect him and his mother as best he can. Zabini was in a very unique position, his only friends were children of Death Eaters, however, his mother was only recently introduced to the Malfoy's social circle four years ago by her late husband. The shift in social atmosphere had changed since then, as well as the treatment of the Zabinis by their "friends."
He would be returning to the manor soon. He would return to an angry lord in light of his father's failure. Would he be killed to pay for his father's mistakes? Would he be tortured? The Dark Lord did favor Draco, slightly, there was a slimmer of something similar to hope.
Potter looked up at him, Draco gripped his hand gently. "Really?" Potter investigated.
"You know it's not that simple."
There was so much blood on his hands, and he couldn’t blame no one else but himself.
Draco stared at Potter, Potter wouldn't look away. Draco wished they were closer, wished that he was close enough to see the flecks of hazel in Potter's eyes. Wished they were close enough for Draco to lean in.
Draco tried to stop himself. He could see the ways in which this conversation could go, none of them good. He should try harder, be softer. He wants to be this softer, calmer version of himself for Potter.
He buried his chin into her shoulder. He could smell her hair. The blood dripped over his cheek, down his chest and onto the floor.
"That is the most absurd accusation that I have ever heard in my life," Draco stated.
"What? No!" Draco protested, his eyes wide in shock.
The blast echoed across the room. Reverberating in his bones. Shouts from everyone pierced his ears.
"I'll see you later Harry, be safe," Tonks said her goodbye.
Potter was quiet after. His face uncharacteristically void of emotion. He was masking his feelings. Draco didn't say anything, instead he nibbled on his cookie. He didn't know how to make this easier for Potter.
Draco nodded as he puffed into the air, "Daphne got me into them."
“Potter…not here, anyone can walk by and then we would both be fucked. I’ll contact you later and we can talk then...alone! Okay?” Draco negotiated, softening his tone and his grip. The look in Potter’s eyes flashed with anger, before settling into a resolved, cold understanding. Draco’s only warning was a slight nod from Potter, before he was shoved away.
He was falling and flying at the same time.
"So you can remember my favorite candy but not that my socks have holes?" Potter teased after he opened the small gift, popping one of the chocolates into his mouth.
"Draco," Pansy whispered next to him. He glanced at her. She was pale, her appearance hadn't improved from earlier today. Her hair was still un-brushed, her stink had only worsen has the day had continued. She had been crying, she didn't even bother to try and hide the fact. She was breaking.
There was no possible way Draco could ever confide in a fellow Slytherin student, even if they would be the ones to most understand. No, they had their own families to serve and protect. Draco knew, without a doubt, that their acquaintanceship could only go so far. It was an understanding throughout most of the house. Please, don’t give me any information I can use against you, because then I would have to.
"Yes, exactly," he said bluntly..
Daphne just started at him. Waiting for her point to become apparent.
The worst part was the glances.
“Yes Professor?”
Draco's ribs ached with the laughter. His stomach cramped in a way that wasn't twisting. Potter was laughing just as loudly. Too loud. "Shhh- Shut up, Potter," Draco hushed as he lowered himself into giggles.
"I promise," Potter offered. "Are you looking forward to losing to me in Quidditch? If Montague lets you play," Potter changed the subject.
Draco flinched away from Potter. Draco wouldn’t want him to spoil himself by laying a hand on what Draco had become over just one summer break. There was always something dark in him, he had known, but now there was a twisted mark to brand his shame.
"Maybe you would like a reward for your hard work," Pansy ran her hands along his shoulders.
“Whatever gave you that idea?” quipped the girl. Draco was starting to like her.
"Actually, I'm going to sit here, thanks," he replied nonchalantly, taking out his materials for class.
The wardrobe shrunk to about Draco's height.
"How did you do it?" Draco asked.
"Potter-"
Draco swallowed. Potter's hand slowly turned in Draco's, Draco was about to let go when he felt Potter's hand gently encircling his. Draco stared at the hands, at what they meant.
"Malfoy," was all Pansy could bother.
"My Lord, perhaps Draco should go up to his room. It is running late," Severus suggested. Draco couldn't see Severus's face as he lowered his expression to the grown, a shadow casting over his face.
"Daphne? Are families know each other," Draco excused.
Hundreds of globes attacked the Death Eater has Draco slammed the spell as hard as he could into flesh.
Draco's words caught in his throat, there was nothing he could do.
Blaise turned to his bed and Draco drew back his bed curtains, ready for this night to be over. Just as he was about to put his charm up, Blaise pulled apart his curtains.
"Someone's got an attitude."
"Shit. Fuck. Goddamn it, what the bloody shits are I-"
Draco froze.
Draco's ears turned red. "You have to talk to it," he mumbled.
He swallowed, the bread tasted dry all of a sudden. "The stew is delicious," he commented. His hands felt sweaty, why was he nervous?
"Simple, but effective," was Draco's answer. All of these spells would be helpful in an attack. "Where did you get that?" Draco motioned to Potter's abused hand.
"Hey," Potter removed the invisibility cloak.
Potter sighed, "Look, Malfoy…I shouldn’t have said all those things, I was a jackass. I'm just…" Potter struggled for the words.
Draco hit the floor with a painful thump, he wasn't fast enough to catch his fall, as he had instantly wrapped his hands around the smaller figure to try and steady himself. Their bags strewn everywhere. Draco's forehead throbbed, his hands hurt from cushioning someone's head, he rolled of off the person who he had literally fallen on, looking up at the ceiling, seeing stars.
"Draco, did you just-"
Draco blinked as they stepped into the circular hallway with the twelve doors.
Follow me @carpebellum on tumblr
"Shut up, neanderthal," fumed Blaise.
Daphne followed him as he crossed the almost empty common room towards the door. "Just think about it," she whispered, squeezing his elbow.
Draco breathed in the smell of the Owlery, or, the smell of bird shit. He didn’t want any further unpleasant situations by following the twins down the long steps of the tower, so he would wait until he was sure they had moved along.
"That's a pretty big technicality," Draco couldn't stop the warmth that spread in his chest. Potter saw him for what he was, and he wasn't horrified by him. Potter didn't know he should be.
"Mother, please," he sobbed.
"What do you want?" Astoria interrupted.
"Draco, please," she looked down at her hands, her nails had been bitten to the skin. "I…I can't go back home," her lip quivered.
"This, this bastard of academia?" his inquired.
Draco didn't see Potter the next day.
"That's enough," Draco glared at the seething girl, his wand ready to retaliate.
"That's enough," Draco interrupted Pansy's innuendo. Pansy looked down at her plate after deciding not to give Draco a dirty glance. Draco's fight with Finnigan had a better affect than he had been expecting.
"Shit," he heard. He focused in on Mafalda, she was concerned about something out of Draco's sight. Was someone coming? Students could enter the Room of Hidden Things at any time. Was someone following one of the students, about to discover where the DA was meeting?
His sob was painful against his sore ribs. He was a monster. "My friend's funeral was a few weeks ago," he explained, his voice wet.
Except with Potter.
"Bullshit."
"I'm not even a Professor, and you get the easy pair?" Draco grumbled. He knelt where Pansy and Daphne were still rolling, Pansy had a fist full of Daphne's hair, but Daphne had her by the tie. "Alright-" How was he supposed to handle this? "- I think you've both made your points." He gently touched both girls on the shoulder. Quickly dodging a fist. "Merlin," he backed off.
Severus released him, Draco turned to the voice, his breath caught in his throat as he met Potter's eyes.
The feeling of glass against skull reverberated up Draco's arms. The Dolohov snapped under the force of the globe. Glass cut into his hands as the prophecy was broken.
"With your track record, yes."
Draco turned to see one of the Carrow twins, which one he had no clue. Her uniform perfectly in place, no button undone, her bow tie tight. Her hair straight and smooth down her back, held back by a green ribbon.
Draco hummed in remembrance. "Didn't you two double date with the Carrow twins?" he asked.
If Draco grabbed Potter, maybe they could make it to the door across the room-
He would try to be happy for Potter. Of course, Potter would be under the impression that he was nothing more than happy for his friend. He would have to coil his feelings inside of him to hide them, to shield Potter from them. Potter wasn't at fault for Draco's feelings, Draco would take responsibility.
"Really? I haven't had any classes with him this year," Draco inquired.
Draco tilted his head, daring Montague to make a move against him. He could handle Montague, but he didn't need the scavengers coming for his name. He would rip him to shreds if Montague stepped out of line. Montague noticed the silent threat, he turned around without another word, returning to the Great Hall.
The pair ate their chocolate in silence. Draco eating in pieces, while Potter finished his in one bite. Draco offered Potter a piece of his half, which Potter accepted by finishing the chocolate in one large bite. Draco snorted and laughed. Potter smiled over his full mouth.
The two shared a smile between them before Potter answered, "We've gone over disarming spells, right now we're practicing the reductor curse and the implement hex."
He stood, Pansy's hand falling away as he walked away from the table. There was a hush that fell wherever he went like a shadow of death.
Draco reexplained what happened in the storage closet. Draco had his back turn, he didn't see Pansy grab the venom. When he started to leave the closet, Pansy tripped and fell onto the glass container, introducing the venom into Pansy's blood steam.
"No, but I think the Crabbe line will not continue after the dealings with the youngest Greengrass," Severus whispered before bringing himself to his full, intimidating height. Draco tried not to seem too pleased by Severus's comment. The pair pushed through the crowd.
"I'm not doing anything," Draco defended.
"We got four new members of the DA yesterday," Potter murmured.
Draco raised his eyebrows, resisting the want to rub his shoulder. He tried to remember if he had done anything in recent history to piss the Gryffindor off, but nothing came into mind. Finnigan had his fist clenched at his sides, his chest puffed out in what Draco guessed was meant to be intimidating. Finnigan wanted to fight. Draco adjusted his strategy compared to how he would usually handle a similar situation, Finnigan wasn't worth his time. He relaxed his stature, rubbing his shoulder, keeping his face carefully neutral. "My mistake, mate," he lied. An unhelpful snort came from Draco right, from where Blaise was standing. Theo shifted on his left.
Draco did his version of an apology with, "How was the first day of being one of Potter's minions?"
"How are your studies?" the Dark Lord didn't react to Draco's blessing.
"Merlin, Malfoy, not every conversation is at a war table," Severus pinched the bridge of his nose.
Good to know she was unpleasant to everyone.
Draco could hear the smirk in her voice, "You mean when you tried to tell me that Quidditch wasn't for pretty girls so I kicked your ass?"
Draco held his breath.
"Don't call me that!" Bulstrode screeched from the floor, her face covered in blood from Pansy's abuse.
He was scared. "Listen, I-" he started.
"Is the connection one way?" Draco asked, fear laced his voice, which was badly covered with concern.
Stan Stunpike… whoever he was, he wasn't a Death Eater. The Ministry was getting desperate. They had taken to arresting anyone who so much as smelt like a Death Eater. Their lack of control of the situation was beginning to show, panic was boiling underneath the public. Before anyone noticed, the Dark Lord would be in power if Dumbledore didn't intervene.
"You started screaming in your sleep, you lashed out whenever I tried to wake you up," Blaise explained gently.
The compartment was silent with everyone in their own heavy thoughts.
," Draco casted at Longbottom. Longbottom blinked awake. He gently sat up, he was guided by Potter's gentle hand.
"I tricked your father into giving Dobby a sock," Potter shrugged.
There was an itch in Draco's hands to reach out, to comfort Potter, but he couldn't bring himself to bridge that gap just yet. This conversation had already taken itself into dangerous waters, he was afraid to drown. He did the next best thing, he held out his box of chocolates, offering Potter one silently. A small smile warmed his chest as Potter took one of them, eating the candy in one bite. "How was your date with Daphne?"
Pansy wrapped both of her arms around Astoria's knees, making her trip onto the floor. Daphne wanked Pansy off of her sister by her ankles.
"…you being promoted? Fine, I suppose I can promote Daphne instead…" Draco shrugged. Of course Potter didn’t need a best friend, he already had two.
"Hey," a cloth touched the back of his hand. Draco ducked as Potter covered him with the invisibility cloak.
A rough shoulder against his snapped his thoughts back, he stumbled backwards, but managed to stay upright. Finnigan glared at him from where he had purposely slammed Draco out of the way.
"It's not a problem, I just have to be more careful about how I carry myself. I don't want to make myself an enemy of my own house," Draco explained.
"I'm serious. Daphne's practically a chimney," he explained.
"I didn't give you permission," Severus snapped whenever he released Potter of his mind, his hand resting on the desk next to him, his breathing shallowed.
"Know your place, werewolf," Lucius growled. He didn't want to draw attention to this embarrassing situation.
Draco had to make a decision: what in the fuck was he going to tell Potter? The truth? Could Potter be trusted? He and Potter had always had a relationship of extremes; would Potter feel some odd sort of nostalgia and sympathize with Draco’s cause?
Theo shrugged, "I have my talents."
Beta'd by @erwintellsdadjokes and @hallgallonhomo on tumblr
"Stop."
"Did you cook all of this yourself? You might have some career potential after all," Draco let Potter hold his hand, but he couldn't bring himself to squeeze back.
"I want to fight," she confided. Draco stopped, seeming shock by her words. She had taken the bait. Daphne started at him, her own words sinking in. She opened her mouth, before swallowing her apologies. "I will fight," she proclaimed, she seemed shocked by the fire within her. The fire that Draco stoked.
"She drowned," he lied for her sake as much as his own.
Daphne gave him an annoyed look, "You two have the same class," she explained.
"That may be true Malfoy," Dumbledore spoke as he stepped pass the privacy curtains, "but we need to know if there are students in our halls that could be dangerous to others."
"I've never seen my mother this tense," Draco agreed.
The muscles in Lucius's jaw clenched, his tongue worked over his teeth in an agitated manner. Nothing Draco said was going to make this gap between them any closer.
After a painful amount of silence, Potter asked, "how long have you known?" He had came prepared.
His parents hadn’t written him.
Draco shifted, why did Potter out them like this? Doesn't he know of the dangers?
Daphne had Pansy by her hair, who was screaming at her.
The breath visibly was knocked from Theo's lungs. The sound made Blaise turn, his hand reaching out. Theo stumbled backwards away from the comforting touch.
"How are you spending your break? Family? Or perhaps with better company?" Blaise smiled tensely.
When Draco was sure he had calmed down enough to face his jury, he turned to the large crowd. Mr. Nott had brought a tense looking Theo, whose face was as distant as Draco's heart. A large bruise was blooming across Theo's jaw, his father no longer trying to hide his abuse. Crabbe and Goyle stood with their respected families, not as somber has one would expect for them to look. Perhaps their parents hadn't told them what they would witness tonight in a feeble attempt to protect their sons.
Pansy. Poor Pansy. If she wasn't being pressured into marriage now, she will be soon. Her mother would be aware of the situation soon, the quick shift in roles. This could offer protection, but practically no one would touch the Parkinson name since Pansy's father's death. Pansy was a fertile woman, an attractive one at that, she would be betrothed to anyone who would take her dowry.
Draco couldn't see the point of doing something you have to get used to, but the pair continued to smoke in silence. Draco focused on breathing in the smoke before releasing his breath, he allowed the routine to take hold, calming himself down.
"Don't say anything," Draco stated.
Severus pulled a chair and sat next to his bed while he ate. He was silent, but Draco could see regret clearly on his godfather's face.
"No sir. I asked her on a date for Valentine's Day, I thought she would appreciate the gesture, but otherwise we didn't talk outside of classes," he explained.
Potter cupped his face in both of his hands. "Why? Why can't we have this?"
"What's that?" he stopped the boy.
Merlin, what was he doing here? Potter had his friends. He didn't need Draco. Draco would just be in the way. Potter never needed him.
Wake up. Breakfast. Class. Lunch. Class. Study. Class. Dinner. Study. Sleep.
Standing was a struggle. His head begged him to lay back down, but he made himself start to walk. He was only able to walk a couple of feet before a large black dog made him stop. The hound was blocking his path. His family had never had any pets before. He could be about to get mauled. That was about his luck. Draco started to walk around the dog, but the dog just stepped into his path. The hound looked up at Draco, as if contemplating something. His head hurt too much for him to deal with this.
"Please, we never hang out anymore," Potter pleated. Draco wouldn't say no. Not to the twinkle suddenly in Potter's eye. Not to the easy smile on his lips. Not to the joy in his voice. Draco couldn't say no to Potter, not if what he could give him was within his power. Potter grinned widely as he slowly realized that Draco wasn't going to say no. How could he? "It's not like you're going to say no," Potter leaned in, his nose almost touching Draco's. Draco scoffed. Potter pulled a piece of parchment from his pocket, not bothering with the Invisibility Cloak.
Draco nodded. His mind tucked away new information. In this state, he couldn't analyze. Sirius could have been speaking from a place of bias, but he had no reason to lie.
"But you two did grow up together, yes?"
Potter ate the chocolate, his mouth full as he explained, "Chocolate always makes me feel better."
"Move, Potter," he snapped.
Daphne hit him on the back of his head, reminding him to stand through his shock. He rose to stand in front of Pansy, who looked small in her apology. She still didn't meet his eyes, staying docile.
Draco hadn't felt so light in weeks, death wasn't hanging from his robes. "You don't think about kissing, Potter?" Draco joked. He was buzzing with Potter's very presence.
"Of course I was, you were all my father talked about. I was constantly compared to you by my parents, by myself," Draco let out a dry, bitter, laugh, "but it always seems that you keep raising the standards."
"Draco," Theo called after him. Draco stopped, turning back to his friends, wishing they lived in a world where he could be happy for them. Wishing they lived in a world where this wouldn't get them killed.
When Potter asked him for his penknife back, he wanted to say no.
"Where do you want to go first?" Draco blurted, turning to Daphne to ask.
"Um, sorry. Didn't mean to offend," Goyle back tracked.
"Just friends, huh?" Potter argued.
"Oh, really? And what brings this up?" Pansy asked.
“I…don't want to bother her, Umbridge says there is no lesson if she heals us right after detention,” was the answer.
But he was horribly talented at killing time, one of the benefits of being an only child.
"Potter, you're not in any position to argue," was the dismissal. "Tell me everything, let's see what we can come up with when we put our heads together."
Draco excused himself from the table, leaving the hall. He could use this time to study, or sulk in peace. The halls were mostly empty, his footsteps the only sounds within the halls besides the occasional student.
Blaise entered the room and Draco pulled his curtain back, "Is she-?"
Alfie shrugged, "She hasn't been out of her room. She won't let anyone in."
"Well…" she continued, leaning in closely, "I didn't particularly heard anything, so much as saw something concerning with your fiancé."
"Yeah, his mother was a witch but his dad was a muggle- or has he been telling you lot he's pureblood?" Potter mocked. Draco could hear Potter's chin sticking out.
Daphne moved around Draco, taking Pansy's hands in hers, "You don’t have to let him treat you like that."
Draco didn’t have any idea what he was talking about, “What about me?” he inquired.
He was a coward. He could never stop seeing Potter, not while he was wanted. That was the key, wasn't it? Potter was the one person who wanted him. Wanted to be with him. He wanted to spend time with Draco just to spend time together, not to scheme or manipulate him. And Draco was weak enough to need that. He was pathetic. This wouldn't end well for either of them. This would only lead to heartbreak, and Draco's would shatter.
"I have no say in what I do," he said.
Draco missed his old study partner. Theo was smart, in certain areas. In other areas, Theo was incredibly unhelpful.
"I don't need your-"
Would Potter still like him?
Draco moved his hands from the sink to fold in front of him, continuing to press his back against the sink.
Doxy Venom isn't instantly deadly, not even in large dosages. For a time.
She tossed the lighter onto his lap. "She would want you to have this." She walked pass him to the house.
“You need to go to Madam Pomphrey as soon as possible, she can help with the scarring,” Draco ordered, he continued with, “why didn’t you go see her earlier?”
Draco looked at Daphne, for some reason, he had expected for her to look different on their betrothal day, more regal perhaps. Less like a girl and more like a woman about to be engaged. Graceful, like his mother. He supposed that was the naivety of being a man. She didn't seem any different, she was out of her usual school uniform. Besides that, she was simply herself.
"Tell me, when was the last time anyone was fully honest with you, boy?"
He took a breath, his shoulders relaxed. Daphne's anger had a source, a source which Draco could trace. "Daphne, please, I'm trying my best here," he softened his face, his voice.
Draco winced in sympathy at Potter's screams. His eyes glazed over as Severus entered his memories. Draco stood, stretching his back as Potter's eyes tightened in concentration. His attempts were futile, there is no point of putting up a wall of hay against a dragon. Draco walked behind Potter's seat over to the large bookshelf. Most of these couldn't be found in the library, not even in the Restricted section, he couldn't stop his curiosity.
Madam Pomphrey was very good at her job, and he should be in full health after a night of rest. Which is why he didn't understand why everyone was fretting over him so.
"Yeah, Potter, I'm fine. I just want to be alone," he explained.
"Draco, as my future husband I feel like you should know this about me- I. Love. Cake." she explained clearly.
Draco supposed he was at fault for this. He should have taken better care of her, should have been a better friend, should have been there for her. Instead, he had only pushed her away when she reached out for help.
This was his fault.
The barricade turned into dust under a blasting spell.
"Why would you think something is bothering me?" Draco asked, nibbling the chocolate.
Daphne shook her head, backing away from him, "No. Don't tell me anymore, I less I know the better," she stressed.
"Explain what, sir? I don't know what you want," Draco played, "Pansy tripped over the doorframe like many students before her, I was too far away to catch her. They was also the unfortunate fact that she was holding a bottle of Doxy venom."
Murdered.
The sounds of hurried footsteps around the corner met their ears. Draco made a rushed decision. He shoved Bones towards Cho. "Go," he ordered.
“What a gentleman,” Draco took a seat on the bench. A loud creak caused him to pause, but the bench held his weight.
"Want one?" the man offered him a cigarette between two large fingers with long yellowed nails sharpened into a claw like shape.
Daphne had seen firsthand what his family, what his father, was like. How cruel they could be in their tempers. Draco couldn't even warn her at this point, she knew. She knew what she was marrying into. The distance between them had only grown. Draco hadn't yet been able to comfort her.
He had to distance himself from the torture Potter was going through. If Draco was honest with himself, he knew in his bones that this was what Potter needed. Hearing Potter's painful gasp made his teeth buzz. He clenched his jaw, resisting the urge to put a stop to the lesson. They had been at this for hours. This was the longest session they had have. Severus was determined to make progress after weeks of nothing, but Draco couldn't help but wonder what drove his desperation.
What had him in such a strange mood? Why was Severus being cruel instead of comforting whenever Draco almost lost a friend?
He was gasping when he arrived at the lavatory; thankfully he was alone, his footsteps  the only sounds besides his gasps. Draco wrapped his cloaked tighter around himself over his sleepwear. His sweat had  dried and was now sticky against him, but he still couldn't get warm. Draco pressed his palms against the cool, smooth sink, using the shock of the cold porcelain  to ground himself.
"I have absolutely no idea what you two are talking about," Chang stood stride along the trio. The group stepped into the busy hallway, students chattered around them.
Draco just turned around and left with Potter hurrying after.
Holding each other.
"That's stupid," she dismissed.
Draco sighed, "Anyone, even you," he pointed out to Severus, "would break after six hours of this nonstop."
"With that in mind, we have decided to make arrangements-"
She could be manipulated, she had been in the past. However, she would be more careful around Draco. If he was going to gain control over her, ensure his own safety, she would have to trust him. She would have to feel safe with him. He would be working against the authority he would be given as her betrothed. How? How could she feel safe with him when she was practically his property? She would have to be in control. She would need to rebel from the role she was forced into, one form of rebellion. A cigarette.
Harry Potter was right. The Dark Lord did return that night, and left a wake of misery in his own celebration that continued-
"We'll just… have to make a plan now, won't we?" Draco shrugged.
"I'm just saying," she challenged, though her eyes remained on the book in front of her. .
Maybe this could help Potter in his fight against his Lord.
"To betray me."
"Malfoy, if you are too distracted for my class you are welcome to leave," Severus interrupted his thoughts. Pansy tensed beside him, Blaise snorted on the opposite side.
Draco turned, his heart pounding in his chest, but no one was there. There was no Dark Lord, no Father, and no Potter making more of a tangled mess then there already was.
"I promise."
Zabini stopped, visibly losing the breath from his lungs at the sight, Draco could see the color drain from Zabini's face. Zabini went still, not breathing.
Myrtle kept talking. Maybe she doesn't get to talk to anyone often. Draco couldn't remember the last he had on honest conversation with anyone. "For other ghosts, they had to hang on to something. For me…I just wasn't ready to leave."
Draco shallowed down the tension in his throat, he wasn't used to having his godfather be displeased with him. His hands started to sweat, what did he do wrong now? His cheek itched from the past disappointment from his father, he wasn't sure he could handle having his mentor be frustrated at him as well.
"I know," she breathed. Her forgiveness was something he was going to have to earn, but she understood his situation. Draco turned his face toward the fire, Pansy's hand moved from his face.
"You shouldn't be so obvious with your reasons, Malfoy," Severus called after them. Draco and Potter turned, Severus had his arms crossed, his eyes darting between the pair, seeing what was obvious whenever they could be themselves. "Even Parkinson is starting to notice."
As the bricks turned into a dirt ground, Draco knew where Potter was leading him. The Shrieking Shack.
Daphne sat next to him on the desk, laying her head on his shoulder. She put out her cigarette on the desk, not needing the routine.
Draco just laid there, blood dripping from his head. His body bruised and sore. The sun was dipping into in the sky when he finally sat up. His head pounded at the movement. The blood was dry on his face. He should make his way back to the manor. He would find his parents then they will be on their way.
Draco had decided to count each nail as a pink item for his little game he played in this pink hellhole. "Yes ma'am, this is truly horrible," he swore.
"Why do you even care, Potter? What, are you jealous?" Draco snapped.
"Mr. Finnigan admitted to starting the fight, but you made sure to finish it, didn't you?" Dumbledore gently prompted.
"Shut up, go to bed," Draco teased.
"Severus," Dumbledore interrupted him.
"You made multiple decisions to join the enemy. To help the enemy-"
Draco's neck and face was warmed by his blush that travelled down to his chest. The fire behind Potter created a glow about him. The glow was almost has bright as his soul.
"She-" Pansy started.
They left him alone in his grief.
"Fine," Draco snapped, "I punched him multiple times. Is that what you wanted to hear?"
Draco's brain wasn't in the space to fully comprehend what he was seeing.
"Mother? What-" he started to ask.
"Malfoy, follow me for your detention," Severus approached him before dinner ended.
A warm arm came around Draco's shoulders, embracing him. Draco could smell Daphne's hair as she laid her head against his shoulder, the smoke forgotten.
"We all have an early morning starting in three hours," Draco begged.
He pulled away whenever she reached for him. He just couldn't. He couldn't meet her eyes, he couldn't smile at her, tell her that he missed her. So many things he should do, but he couldn't give this piece of him to her. He couldn't let her think that he was anywhere near being able to face her, to smile at her warmly, with leaving a bile acid in his mouth and throat. He was hurting her, but he was still tenting to his wounds.
"I don't think they're ready to admit they're feelings for each other," Goyal commented.
Mafalda did nothing but watch. She eventually pulled out a notebook to write down a short note. Names, perhaps? She crouched down, petting the feline whenever he brushed against her leg. Draco shifted, he was getting stiff behind the armor. This girl must have incredible patience. He watched her watch the hall. Mafalda rested her chin on her knees. Why didn't she bring a book or something? Wasn't she young? Don't young people get bored? Was she bored? Draco was. Probably because he was young. She was young, he was older than she was. He wasn't going to have less patience than someone younger than himself. He would stand here as long as she sat there. Even longer, just to prove his point.
Montague reddened at the teasing. "I've seen you," he barked, his anger rising, "you walk around like you own the castle-"
"Yes, but… the way you won-"
Just do.
He remembered the charm this time.
"Doing in your lavatory. I heard you the first time," Draco's voice was raw from his panic cries from earlier.
"Well, shit, you may have a point there," Potter laughed.
Obviously I’ve underestimated Potter, that or he is just simply stupid.
Why did he write that? Of course Potter didn't trust him. Draco considered letting Pansy skin him for his stupidity.
The fire warmed their bodies that were lying on the floor. They laid on the blankets and pillows that softened the floor. Draco was on his back, his head supported by pillow. Potter was there. His head was propped by his arm, but he was looking down at Draco. He was so close.
Severus tense, "I think you are dangerously capable if pushed by the right circumstance."
Professor Flitwick moved on to the next student and Draco was left with his thoughts once again. He attempted to seem productive against his hurried thoughts. Draco had to make a decision soon, in order to take action. Potter could, most likely, be trusted. Draco knew Potter, maybe not as friends, but Draco had always observed Potter from afar, he was confident in his knowledge of Potter.
Potter called out to him, Draco crawled faster. Draco kept his face carefully calm as he stood.
"Did you know the girl?" Sirius asked as he blew the smoke from his lungs.
She let go of him whenever they were in sight of their parents. Draco's stomach dropped.
He locked himself into a random stall, his hands were shaking. His first sob surprised him, he quickly place a silencing charm around him. He tried to calm his breathing, but he couldn't. Why? Why? Why wasn't he told before about Daphne? How was he expected to do this? This balancing act of appearing to be in the Dark Lord's service when really he could stomach being around him? The man who was playing the Malfoys as if they were his puppets? Daphne. Daphne knew too much, but she didn't understand, not really. She wasn't there, she wasn't there when-
"Oh, well, perhaps Theodore wouldn't mind helping me study for Professor Snape's test tomorrow," she tilted her head at Theo, a girly smile on her lips.
"Daphne," Draco cooled. Daphne froze, ready to rise and knock Montague on his ass. Her breath in short gasps, trying to claim herself down. The tension in the room was thick, Draco was rising against Montague without even sitting up from his relaxed position. He didn't need to.
The lemon cake was quite excellent actually whenever Draco was calm enough to eat pass the lump that had appeared in his throat. When tears started to spill down his cheeks he stopped eating the desert and pretended to sleep.
"Thanks, Draco, but-"
Draco heart nearly stopped in his chest. "Potter?" he choked to Dumbledore's all too knowing look and Severus's loud sigh that echoed throughout the room. "Oh, no, we're, I mean he's incredible, but we're…" Draco swallowed, thinking of the almost kiss that could have been just last night. "We're just friends," he shuddered, his face turning so red that he was sure everyone in the room could tell that he was lying. Badly. Oh he was lying so badly. Draco closed his eyes for a second, gathering his patience. "Actually, I was hoping I could talk about him with you two."
Every student remained silent as the news soaked in. The new limits placed on their relationships with their mentors. How every move made had started to be watched and now censured. Their every lives, the people they look up to, the people that gave them the tools to help them succeed, were being limited by an outsider looking in.
"My only way of rebellion," she explained, her voice sore, pulling out a cigarette and lighting the tip with a lighter instead of her wand.  Draco could see her delicate features as the small flame caused light to dance across her face. She inhaled, drawing the smoke in into her lungs with a slow, experienced drag before releasing the breath. She looked out at nothing, everything covered by darkness.
That wasn't good enough. "You don't honestly expect me to believe you would risk Potter's sanity on a well-placed argument?" Draco challenged.
Longbottom scooped Granger out of Draco's arms. "Go help Ginny," he was ordered.
The girl shrugged, "the look on her face was worth the detention," was the reply. Draco nodded, understanding the feeling.
Potter blushed. "I'm sorry, this is stupid," he rubbed the back of his head, "Dobby told me that you were yelling for Snape, I just wanted to make sure you were okay," he explained.
The tea was too sweet to Draco's liking, but he drank the light liquid anyway. Daphne nibbled on a biscuit. "He's really stupid, bringing up Granger and all."
Potter crossed his arms dangerously, "I don't see why it matters," he argued.
Goyal just stood there with his mouth open. Crabb attempted to contribute with, "Didn't they meet last year?"
Did he forget his textbook?
"I forgot to put the charm up, stupid," Draco thought out loud,  still numb from panic.
"I would like to sit with my back to the window, if you don't mind," Daphne mentioned.
How pathetic this all was. He was the one that had been hurt. He was the one who spied for the Order. He was the one that had been accepted seamlessly into his Lord's favor. He was also the one who would bury his guilt deep inside him, so deep that he never had to look at all of his twistedness. "Are you finished?" Draco sounded bored.
If only they could be the sort of couple that kisses each other goodnight and whisper sweet nothings to one another, but one of them was tar and the other was a dove.
"Don’t lie to me," a hand gripped Draco's.
"Who?" he asked, keeping his face in shock.
"Put some privacy charms up," Draco whispered, making sure they took his advice before leaving them to whatever. Draco's stomach was not affected at all by the show he was just forced to witnessed, growling loudly. He made his way down the stairs and into the Common Room. Draco could work on homework or more research on Occlumency.
Draco stood as Pansy turned red in her face and returned to their shared table, taking out her wand. He quickly turned to gather the ingredients, ignoring the heat that suddenly encompassed his back and neck as Pansy almost exploded the cauldron in heat from her spell.
Draco sighed, "so… you saw that," he cringed.
Draco brought his attention back to the conversation in the cart. He was letting his guard down. Stupid. "Ah, yes, father is doing well," Draco responded to Crabbe's question.
"The audacity!" Umbridge gasped, her pink nails touching her pink lips as she covered her mouth in shock.
Being a spy for Dumbledore called for precision.
"Detention," Severus punished in a cool voice.
"I'll make you a sleeping potion then," Draco answered.
Draco stood, but his legs wouldn't move more than that. Old fears from angering his father stopped him.
"She keeps everyone in line," Draco agreed. Patting his pockets for a cigarette box. He pulled out a smoke, lighting the tip with his wand.
Draco would normally use magic for such a mess, but he kneeled to pick up his supplies, following her lead. Mafalda handed him the oversize Potions Theory book, "Oh, I've read this, what do you think?" she conversed.
"Eh, sure," Potter shrugged, his nose touching Draco's throat. Draco had to repress a shiver along his spine as Potter's breath brushed against his collar.
Draco stood, needing to break this fight before this got bloody. He wasn't the only one, Astoria dived past him. She grabbed two fist of Pansy's long hair, yanking her over the back of the couch. Pansy hit the floor with a painful thrash.
"Yes, exactly. And he knows it," Draco nuzzled Bentley with his nose.
What was he going to do?
Draco woke with a searing pain from his mark.
"You two are just friends? Why would you say that if it's not true?" he pointed out.
Draco continued his walk around the base of the castle, not meeting anyone else on his lengthy route as he walks down towards Herbology. The world is quiet, even if only for a couple moments.
"So…that’s it then?" Potter face was hard to read.
Draco hurried to the Room of Hidden Things in the blanket of darkness that covered the late hour. What was he thinking? Potter would hate him if he missed their engagement, they had just made up. Potter probably wasn't even in the room anymore, Draco was hours late, but he had to be sure.
"Fine, he is making progress," Draco was purposely vague.
"Let's not forget why we're here. I know exactly what is necessary," Draco pulled out of his father's grasp.
His Mother finally released his mind. Draco curled in on himself as he thought about how last night continued.
"Knock- what? Yes, I knocked. I meant in the toilet!" Draco snapped.
"It's not against the rules to sell candy, Malfoy," Weasley One snapped.
"We have what we need, let's make a break for it," Weaslet ordered.
"What's this for?" Potter asked as he took the present.
Draco opened the map onto his lap. He studied the corridors of the map, there was few footsteps between the halls. The text clumping into an almost unreadable picture in the common rooms. Draco pointed to a hallway he didn't recognize, motioning to Potter. "That’s one of the ways to Hogsmead," Potter answered. Draco asked about another, "That's how you get to the Shrieking Shack," he explained, not moving from his place on Draco's shoulder.
“We should go,” Potter interrupted with a high voice.
He had taken up the habit of keeping Darkness Powder and the Hand of Glory on his person in case the situation got dire and he had to make a quick exit. Paranoia inspired preparedness.
Draco smiled. "None of this is fair, Potter. Don’t beat yourself up about wanting to change that."
Potter had finally cornered him. Convinced him to meet him in the Astronomy Tower.
Severus raised his wand.
She was being stupid.
He killed Daphne, then he stole her body.
There was no celebrations over the winter break with the cold stones of the Malfoy Manor. There was no breakfast in the magically warmed gardens. No reading by the fire. No laughter of guest over glasses of wine and mead.
The girl gripped the wound tighter, still glaring at Draco, she considered his help, she also considered telling him to fuck off. Draco waited, wanting to be an understanding person, but he was only half invested in this situation as is, having shock drive his earlier actions. Draco's knees began to twinge uncomfortably at the position, and Draco thought about leaving the girl to deal with her wound herself. She couldn't be younger than a second year, she could probably heal herself if she stopped crying for five minutes. Draco was about to stand whenever the girl nodded and lifted her right hand for Draco's inspection.
"Ron, Ron stop it! He didn't do anything!" Potter pulled Weasley off of Draco.
"Honestly?" Draco bought himself a few precious seconds. "Astoria is young. I was thinking that she could be saved from her sister's influence. Now that her sister can no long have an effect on her."
“I’m always impressed when you show manners,” Draco lit a smoke with a pale blue zippo lighter. He could feel his left sleeve drag up his arm with the movement, he watched as Potter's eyes fall to his left exposed wrist. "I charmed the sleeve to keep my arm covered," Draco explained to a question Potter wouldn't ask. "After Madam Malkin's, I wanted to make sure I didn't have to worry about being arrested because of a wardrobe malfunction."
"Daphne's waiting for you, I have to meet Milly," Blaise excused himself.
"-it's a question of rather or not you would," Severus shouted, "It's a question of what you decide, because apparently you're the only one that thinks he can!"
The students all followed the same path up to the castle for dinner, the rest of their peers chatting and laughing warmly against the chilled air of dust. The sky had dipped into a deep blue, making the grass look black. Draco walked his usual pace, but, as Zabini began to fall behind, Draco slowed his pace to match his fellow Slytherin’s. Draco walked in step with Zabini up the path, before glancing over, catching Zabini’s eye, asking for permission. Zabini nodded, allowing Draco to give him this small comfort. The two of them fell behind the rest of the students, allowing them a quiet moment in the almost dark.
The class settled into busy silence as everyone worked on the complicated potion. Pansy and Draco broke into their easy routine they had built from working together for so long.
His father didn't answer quickly. Instead, he pinched his lips, his brow furrowed. "Can we sit?" he finally asked, rubbing his forehead.
"Harry Potter," she clarified.
The thought sent a warm blush up Draco's neck.
"Wait, please. I'm not judging you. I'm worried about you. You don't talk to me anymore," Daphne begged, her voice wet. Pansy just shook her head. Draco stopped her retreating to the dorms with a gentle hand on her arm. "Let me help you."
Daphne knew too much, that was the nightmare. She could have Draco killed. He could have her killed, if he wanted. He hoped he wouldn't have to but… if Daphne was cornered, she would lash out, and Draco had no intention of being a consequence of her own insecurities.
"Where did you get all the food?" Draco wouldn't let him finish.
"Really?" Potter grinned.
Dumbledore's smile didn't falter, but his eyes did darken. "I'm sure I have no idea what you're talking about," Dumbledore's voice was cold.
"If you are looking for a thank you-"
"Class dismissed. Mr. Malfoy, would you mind staying after class? Mr. Potter wait outside if you don't mind," Professor Firenze called to him.
"You're in denial about being in denial," she supplied with ease.
"I think he might kill me," she whispered. Her face strangely calm as she said this fact. Daphne's eyes looked into the distance, she could be seeing the very moment she died and she would still be steady handed while she smoked.
Sounds dulled, Draco couldn't be bothered to pay attention. His parent's voices were laced with false happiness. Draco was filled with detached dread.
"Delicious, is it not?" his Lord commented next to him. Draco just nodded before continuing his meal.
He didn't know why he was so upset. Potter's friendship was the most important relationship he had. Why risk the relationship he had, the relationship he cherished, by raising his hopes on a fantasy?
"I remember it differently," was Draco's defense.
"Then why are you keeping information from me?" Draco questioned.
"And I am correct to assume that you know why?"
Dumbledore's Army was supposed to meet soon. Yet, here he was, right in front of the Room of Hidden Things. He walked right by the location of the entrance. When he turned the corner, out of sight, the quick footsteps behind him made him laugh. Merlin, they were so painfully obvious. He was going to have to have a talk with Potter about being more discrete.
Daphne dragged him to Dominic Maestro's Music Shop, a dingy loud space at the end of the block. Daphne investigated what Draco found out to be gramophones, which were placed on shelves lining the back wall. He investigated the shiny instruments lining the aisles while Daphne spoke to the store owner.
"If what?" his Lord prodded.
The class was ruined whenever Umbridge arrived for Hagrid's observation. Draco stepped away from Potter, taking his place next to Theo and Blaise. Umbridge questioned Hagrid on everything. Draco wasn't particularly fond of Hagrid, but Umbridge's criticism was painful to watch.
They were about to be seen.
Severus had arrived in a hurry. Draco could almost promise that he had seen actual worry in his expression. Must have been a trick of the light.
The muscle was tough. The taste of copper filled his mouth.
"How?" he croaked.
She inspected the small, pale blue object. "Why? Am I going to hate what your mother got me?" She opened the blue zippo lighter, the flame coming with a snap.
"My mother," Draco lied. "I have to protect her."
"Just in case of what?" Potter investigated.
"Horrible habit," Draco shrugged off. He took in a deep inhale, blowing the smoke into the air.
Draco glanced at Pansy, who met his gaze. "Yeah," she agreed, "best friends."
Dinner was a lamb stew with bread, delicious, but not a delicacy. Draco allowed the conversation to continue without him, allowed his eyes to drift across the dining hall, past the ornate windows that led to the outdoors, his eyes fell on a dark skinned boy with unruly hair and green eyes.
Pansy's throat strained against the black liquid even as her body remained dangerously still. The dark liquid fell onto her shirt, combined with the red of her blood. Draco just watched, unsure of what to do. Where was Madam Pomphrey? Why wasn't she here already?
He blinked, suddenly to aware of his own body. He licked the lip he had just been biting down on. Pulling his hand away from Potter's ankle where he had suddenly found it. "Sorry," he coughed, "you were saying?"
"Probably not, I just really hate those guys," Draco motioned to the Weasley Twins, who were both tackling Goyle.
"I'm not here to discuss Mrs. Zabini, I'm worried about Blaise," he contradicted.
A steady hand on his back guided him through the corridors. Leading him somewhere private. Potter stopped at the beginning of the moving stairs, pulling him until they were behind one of the only set of stairs in the castle that didn't move. The area was small, too small to stand, but Potter sat next to Draco as he pulled his knees to his chest, wrapping his arms around himself.
"I should get her something, would you arrange for Mother and I to attend to the shopping?" Draco called after his father as the door shut.
He hadn't talked to Potter at all over the summer, too dangerous. He had wanted to. In a way that he could feel in his chest when he allowed himself to think about it, he had wanted to. He had wanted to whisper gentle comforts to Potter. He had wanted to laugh with Potter. He had wanted to be there for Potter. But the world wasn't so kind.
"I told you earlier, I didn't, she found out on her own," he defended.
'Hi Potter, so glad to see you. I very much want to kiss you, but I think it would be best if we never talked again because you will probably end up hating me,' seemed a little long winded and too complicated.
Before any of that could come into place, Draco had to get this fucking cabinet to actually work. Mother always lectured that you cannot learn magic from reading, you must practice. 'A good wizard is the one that can actually cast the spell, my dear boy,' she would say if she was in a talkative mood after a couple glasses of wine. Draco thought back to his childhood, his early summers from Hogwarts, before his life got so twisted. He would always ask his mother to show him spells from her days of competitive dueling. He would love to show his father only when he perfected a spell under his mother's careful instruction. They hadn't done that since he was thirteen.
"My cousins," she allowed Draco to drop the subject.
Granger and Weasley looked at Potter with concerned expressions. They turned to Draco, who shrugged. Pansy glared at him before finding a different seat.
He had left his wand in his room to corner himself into killing Daphne with his hands.
Draco could also admit that Potter was a huge dickhead when he lost his temper, and he had a lot to be angry about.
"That's just hurtful," Potter frowned in mock offence.
Harry was sitting next to him. He was watching Draco eat this horrid meal. Potter out his hand on Draco's arm, "do you think you'll ever be enough?"
Draco walked to the Weaslet, who was leaning heavily on Lovegood. "Here, let me," he whispered to keep his voice unrecognizable.
"Well, you put up quite the argument," Dumbledore clarified.
"Why didn't you?" investigated Dumbledore.
"What is that supposed to mean?" Severus asked, still in the corner.
The bark of laughter Potter let out surprised Draco. Potter had a nice laugh.
"You're right, how dare I doubt you."
Potter's back was warm underneath Draco's hands. He was shaking, trying to bottle his fear as Draco soothed him the best he could. "Just promise me you'll be careful," Potter whispered into his neck.
"Was there something you wanted to discuss?" Draco attempted to settle the tension between them.
He reached out for her, taking her hand in his. "We don't have to do this," he whispered through the milling and chatter of the classroom. Pansy shook her head, her answer was clear. She had no other way.
Draco turned to answer, but he was interrupted by Theo's, "What are you, his wife?"
Hi guys!
What was Draco stepping into?
In theory, if she did join the DA, Draco would have enough control over her to battle any threat she made. Perhaps that would be best, as a precaution. If she was found she would be killed, but Draco would have proof against any words she spoke against him. They would simply be the disparate words spoken by a silly girl. Plus, if his betrothed was killed for being a traitor, Draco would have more say in his next finance.
Draco gave an overdramatic sigh, "I suppose that's acceptable."
Draco felt a chill go down his spine before settling in his chest. He was there when Potter returned with Cedric, he remembers the screams and tears Potter released so publicly over the Hufflepuff. Draco recalled his own cold, paralyzing fear at his first sight of death. The sorrow Potter had shown was so raw, so unconditional, that Draco did not stop shaking until deep into the night.
"You separate Greengrass and Parkinson," Severus ordered, before moving to help a whimpering Goyle.
Everyone knew what his omen was. Death. The word vibrated from the front of everyone's thoughts. The word laced the back of Draco's throat. The word couldn’t be washed like the blood from his hands. The word was his omen that he wore like a brand burned into his skin.
He crossed the doorway of the Great Hall, his head still down. He had to leave. Find a place to breath.
He also took his wand with him into the shower. He wouldn't be without his lifeline again.
"You have got to be fucking kidding me," Draco mumbled to himself.
Potter wanted to see Draco. Why would he suggest that they meet if Potter didn't enjoy, to some degree, Draco's company? Potter suggested that they meet even after the upset over Daphne.
"What-" Draco almost asked.
Blaise just laughed tightly, "Heart attack, unfortunately."
"Is there something I can do to make your morning better?" she asked as she slid into the space next to him, a hand sliding up his arm.
"It's not that simple Draco, and you know it," Pansy hushed him.
"Just in case," Draco answered.
The hours continued as they finalized their essays. Astoria's friends filed to bed after saying good night. Only the three of  them remained until Theo sheepishly took an empty seat. They tackled the atrocity that was Theo's homework together. Draco ignored when Theo suddenly got quiet as Blaise walked in with Bulstrode. For the last couple of weeks, Draco has noticed a lack of sneaking around from those two, but didn't want to say anything. The pair sat at the empty couch by the fireplace, they talked quietly between themselves. The common room was wonderfully quiet for once. The only other students were a couple of second years including Alfie, and Crabbe and Goyle who were playing a game of chess.
"What happened to trust?" Draco questioned, "Let's not play games, we all know that the Dark Lord's connection to Potter goes beyond the bounds of Legilimency."
"Yes, yes there is, actually," Lucius looked down, "something I want to discuss with you, that is."
"Come on, Blaise, let's get out of here," suggested Bulstrode, a gentle hand on his shoulder.
Draco threw himself into his school work with what could be mistaken as determination. The truth was, he wasn't letting himself stop long enough to make a decision. He kept himself busy with whatever Umbridge had the Inquisitorial Squad doing that week.
Draco screamed. He never could imagine this pain was possible. He was on fire, yet he was freezing. He bones were shattering, but were also too heavy for his body.
"But…?" Draco prompted.
"I didn't know you were waiting for me," he mumbled as he rubbed his arm.
“You have always been more capable than you think you are,” Draco finally responded, ignoring his instincts. Carefully being vague, but doing his best to offer what little support he can. He continued with, “My mother always says, ‘You will conquer what you have to,’ Blaise, you will get through this because you have to,” Draco finished.
Draco had slipped out the back door. He had already caused enough pain, his presence wasn't needed. He and Daphne used to play in these woods whenever they could manage to slip away from their parent's watchful gazes. They would return with scrapped knees and dirty clothes.
The corner of her lip turned upward, "You should have seen my mother yelling, red-faced at the healers about making sure I don't scar."
Potter blinked, out of whatever trance he dazed into, before he went around pulling at doors. He yanked one open before they hurried in. Their footsteps soft, but their hearts pounding.
The threads of magic were tangled around the cabinet. The essence of the life of the cabinet was mingled and twisted amongst itself. Pulling at any of the threads could snap the magic with how tight the bonds were.
Draco poked his head into the empty classroom. Professor was at her desk at the front of her classroom. "Yes, Malfoy, come in," she beckoned.
He wasn't destined to look down on earth, he wasn't even destined to look up to the stars. He was only meant to keep his gaze here on the ground.
"Yep," was all Potter could offer lamely, nodding slowly.
"Dear me, is someone upset because they lost to Potter?"
"Draco, thank you for stopping me when I lost my temper, " she began, following the proper social edict, while also trying to flatter Draco in all of his wisdom. Draco thought he was about to puke. "I can see now with your guidance that my actions earlier were childish and immature," she continued, her voice carrying throughout the common room, "I am not only embarrassed for my temper, but also for acting against your direct advice. The shame I have caused you is my biggest regret, I deeply hope you can find it within your mercy to forgive me. I am so sorry for how I have carried myself, and how it has reflected on you," apologized Pansy.
"I… I feel responsible for her betrayal," he admitted, looking down at his feet.
For the first time, Dumbledore actually seemed surprised. "I suppose I will, Mr. Malfoy," he mused. "Thank you for your time." With that farewell, he left.
Oh shit.
Theo froze at the sight of him. He had the same expression that he had whenever he looked at his father. Fear.
Draco tried not to roll his eyes, he wasn't sure if he exceeded. "I wouldn't know, we aren't talking."
Potter pushed himself away so quickly he chair fell as he stood, walking away from him. Draco hurried after him before he could think. He reached out to Potter, grabbing his shoulder only for Potter to turn to face him, hands clenching at the front of his robes. Draco's heart snapped into two as he realized that Potter was crying.
No one had whispered a word of the truth of Daphne's death. Her presence was a void in the students of Hogwarts.
As always @CarpeBellum on tumblr
He paid for his items, requesting for giftwrapped, much to the cashier's annoyance.
"Just pick a damn shop," he brushed off.
Draco nearly chopped his finger off.
"Only the best I'm sure," Parkinson sat on the other side of Draco. Draco's skin crawled as her hand slid up his arm onto his shoulder. She leaned in closer to his space. He could see each of her lashes as she steadied him with eyes that would peak his interest if he was mildly attracted to women.
Draco grabbed Potter's hand, pulling Potter behind him as he ran, following behind Granger and Longbottom.
"Bullshit Malfoy, let me in," Potter called back.
--------------------------
Draco could feel the coil of hatred he had for that man tighten a little bit more. "I'll think about it. I promise."

"You know that if you unzipped your pants- "she tilted her head in Draco's direction- "he would be the first on his knees."
"And you understood it?" he pressed.
"It's not just nightmares! It's-" Potter reached for his scar subconsciously, the movement was stopped as Potter froze. The weight of the scar on his forehead, how this could affect them, sending chills down both of their spines. "He's in my head," Potter whispered. "I've tried to tell Dumbledore, but he won't talk to me. I don't know why. I'm-" Potter gasped painfully, "I'm scared."
Bellatrix walked away to stand next to his father on the other side of the throne. His father wouldn't look Draco in the eyes..
"What are you doing in my lavatory?"
Potter, where was Potter?
The carriage ride to the castle was one of tense silence.
"Oh really? And what gives you the right to lecture me? What exactly gives you the right to tell me what to do? How are you in anyway better than me?"
There was still blood on his sleeve, Draco noted as he examined his hands. Bruises lined his knuckles and the joints of his fingers from some badly aimed punches. The bruises were blue, almost purple in some places against his pale skin. With the amount of blood he had on his hands, Draco had expected for some of his skin to have split against Finnigan's jaw. He flexed his hand, enjoying the soreness, like from a long game of Quidditch.
A gentle hand on Draco's jaw caused him to flinch slightly. "You're bleeding," Potter whispered. Draco licked his bottom lip, he was bleeding from getting punched earlier. Potter's eyes followed the motion, Draco's neck warmed. He brought his hand to his lip, whipping the blood away slowly. Potter's tongue flicked across his lip as he watched the motion before returning Draco's gaze.
Pansy went still, she stared at Draco as if she couldn't begin to understand him.
Draco hurried to his knees, pushing Blaise away, all while Blaise laughed.
"I also want a cat," she added.
He hadn't seen his mother since the day he had arrived. She could probably tell he was angry with her. But his feelings weren't that simple.
"What about a spell?"
Severus's eyes widen in realization at the situation. The panic was clear in his voice now as he ordered someone to get Madam Pomphrey.
"No more, please."
"Of course Potter," Draco confirmed, smiling back at Potter with ease.
"It's unfortunate that Parkinson won't be able to return home this holiday," Daphne spoke beside Draco.
Silence. No one moved.
Severus stepped out from behind Dumbledore to loom over Draco, "We wouldn't be in the mess in the first place if you hadn't-"
Finally, Severus allowed the class to collect the supplies needed for the potion they were brewing. Draco wasn't particularly looking forward to having Severus critic his every tiny step.
Draco turned to face Theo. What Theo was doing…how he is, could get him killed. Probably by his own father, the horrid bastard, he had to know that. Was his life worth risking? Draco had to be sure before he took charge of the situation. "Theo, this place, Hogwarts, provides shelter, but only temporarily. You know that," Draco inquired.
"I'll think of something," he pleaded.
Draco rubbed the back of his neck, "I'm fucked," he admitted. Theo gave him as sympathetic of a look as he could while eating his toast. "Why didn't you sit with Blaise?" Draco investigated.

"I'm quite sure selling magic instruments that get a student out of class for vomiting is not allowed," Draco cooled.
Draco held Pansy's eyes. This was as close as the two would ever get to apologizing to each other. No matter how cruel they were to each other, they would always return to each other without apologies, without words. Instead, the pair always returned to each other with actions that had more meaning than words could ever possibly have between them.
"Relax, I just wanted to meet you. Harry talks about you all the time."
"Bye Tonks," Potter smiled as he waved goodbye.
Potter pulled his hands away, inspecting them before slowly looking up at Draco. "That's your blood, Draco."
Draco didn't have the chance to defend himself before he was thrown across the room. He landed on a desk full of vials and parchment, the table falling onto its side, Draco hitting the floor as the table tilted. His head pounded only harder. He blinked. Spells of all different sorts flew in the air.
"I'm sorry if I misread what… we are…" Potter struggled for the words.
So… naturally Draco did nothing. Allowing Potter to blush and blunder through this awkward experience alone. “Um… sure. Does the, the um, Room of Requirement sound okay? Around midnight?” Potter blundered.
Draco stilled as Pansy weakly sat up, there was a scream not coming from Pansy's lips. Pansy had tears down her face, her head was bleeding, there was crimson bleeding through her white shirt from the shattered glass.
"You're not necessarily specifically qualified," Dumbledore pointed out.
"Talk to my sister again, and I'll sew your mouth shut," Astoria growled. Draco hadn't noticed her from her seat next to her sister, but she was glaring at Crabbe with a look Draco had seen on himself.
The pair continued their gossiping about the teachers at Hogwarts and the news of the Ministry. Draco played a game while Umbridge talked on and on, he counted the objects in the office that were not pink. He counted only the fireplace and the glass of the windows.
"I should have expected this from you, fuck I'm stupid," Potter grabbed his cloak, striding over to the door.
Theo let out a low whistle at the silence that followed. "Well, doesn't this remind me of home," he commented. "Before my mom died, of course."
"Do you remember that time where you pushed me off of my kiddy broom?" Draco asked, not bothering to look over at her.
"Yes. Potter, relationships. I don't have many," Draco snapped back.
"Well, you're absolutely correct, my inferior intellect detects everything," Draco teased, "that, and, I caught you and Blaise snogging in the Astronomy tower after the Yule Ball."
Draco sat in his usual spot in the soft grass. His side felt cold with Daphne's absence. He took his notes and books out of his bag as the other students filed into the classroom. He couldn't find his textbook.
He was debating if he should count the Floo Powder in a pink vase, but he was sure she only had the green powder because she had no choice. Should he count the powder? It wasn't because of lack of trying, if Umbridge wanted pink glass, she would, but there was no such thing as pink Floo Powder.
Draco cursed under his breath before getting up to help Severus stop the fighting. "No one is even bleeding," he mumbled.
Draco slammed his book shut. He started to gather his things.
He didn’t want to go any farther.
The pair looked for an exit.
Was he worth Potter? Was he good enough to be the person Potter goes to when crying?
Potter just stared at him. He shrugged in defense. "Draco," Potter stated.
"Yes?"
Love never came to Draco's mind.
Astoria rolled her eyes, but moved to step beside Draco as he lead them to the Great Hall.
He shouldn't laugh, he really shouldn't. The situation is not one to laugh at. He did anyway. Potter started to laugh gently too.
How ironic that in order to arrive to platform nine and three-quarters, a wizard had to travel through the heart of muggle London.
"What? Someone talked shit about daddy?" Greyback taunted.
"You're in denial," she teased.
"You were awake?"
"I was almost sorted into Slytherin," Potter stated, his knees against his chest.
The pair sat in silence as Draco finished bandaging the abuse.
If only Potter knew why Draco avoided that conversation. "You don’t need to apologize. You're angry, that's all. And you have every right to be."
That was a stupid question, of course he was in danger, he attracted  danger. Half the time he had caused the danger. Was he in any more danger that usual would be a better question.
"You son of a bitch!" George fumed.
The shock on Draco's face was genuine.
"She's an acquaintance, nothing more," Draco explained.
Severus crossed his arms, pinching the bridge of his nose. He ran his hand over his face, his shoulders were tense. Severus was nervous, worried even. Worried about Pansy? No, there was no use of fretting over her, she was in the best hands possible now.
Theo gasped, Draco grinned wickedly before hurrying to breakfast, with Theo following closely, muttering insults under his breath.
"I know that Potter, I wanted to."
"Tomorrow?" Potter gathered his cloak.
Draco sat in History of Magic, dreading the class but looking forward to his nap. Students were already at their tables when he had arrived, having been caught up in the dispute. Each desk was long enough to be accompanied by two seats facing the front of the classroom. He had taken the table in the back with the chair against the wall. This was the best table for gossiping, as he and Pansy had discovered in first year. This was also the perfect table to fall asleep in, the dim light of the back of the room assisting in drowsiness.
He tore away from that path of curiosity. He needed to double check the type of wood that was used before he attempted this particular spell. Anyone could cast a spell, undoing layers of magic took pression and time. If he got sloppy, he could undo months of his work. He didn't have time for that.
Draco sighed, "I think eventually, we would have become friends. That, or we would have hated each other even more and destroyed the common room and cause poor Severus's blood pressure to rise to dangerous levels," he explained.
Their chests were touching. Draco was sure Potter could feel his heartbeat. Potter's thumb gently stroked Draco's cheek.
Their Lord tilted his head, his eyes narrowing, "Blasphemous behavior," he pursed his lips, "what a delicate way to word betrayal." He sentenced her to death with no trouble.
"I accept your apology, Malfoy, I'm sure a young man like yourself would never act unmotivated," she dismissed.
He didn't have that power. He didn’t have the authority to decide who was granted mercy and who was left bleeding on the floor, who lives and who dies. Whose bodies were left to rest and whose final resting place was twisted into a foul tool. His parents greeted the hoist first. The tension between them straightened their spines and stoned their expressions. Draco thanked whatever god was looking down on him that Astoria wasn't there to face her sister's executioner.
"I was being polite, given that situation. Perhaps you should try a more delicate approach yourself Father," Draco quibbled. Lupin pulled Draco behind him as the furry flashed across Lucius's eyes. If only Draco could be saved so easily.
Draco continued his relaxed, casual pose. He was doing his best to make Potter feel at ease. “Potter, I need to know, please don’t make this difficult,” Draco begged, keeping his hands on the sink behind him, gripping the edge in nervousness. He made himself seem more vulnerable that he was, he needed Potter to trust him to some small degree.
Draco hummed in agreement, his head leaning against the window of the train. Outside there was snow, a generous blanket of white along the landscape. The sky was grey with heavy clouds. The glass allowed the harsh chill to seep into the compartment. The cold brushed against Draco's nose. He made no attempt to cast a warming spell. He let the cold grip his bones, maybe he could numb himself from the visit to his empty home.
Draco remained silent, Potter's grip on him tightened. Draco looked down. "Of course she was joking, Potter. Relax."
But why Daphne? Why someone so young? The Greengrass family was pure blooded, but they were never apart of the first war as far as Draco knew. Daphne's father didn't even have the Dark Mark. What could pressure them to auction off their daughter? Perhaps to gain mercy from the Dark Lord? Was the Dark Lord making an example of them? A warning to other families who didn't swear their lives to him?
" The Death Eater on his left hit the floor, frozen. Draco stood as he pulled up his shield. A whip of purple flame sliced through the air from Dolohov's wand.
Potter surprisingly didn't hesitate to allow Draco to see his abuse, the two leaning closer over the arms of their chairs and the small table between them. Draco gently investigated the injury, noting the lines that over lapped each other too much to make out what the words were, he noted how warm Potter was, how strong his hands were.
"If that's alright," Potter continued, his eyes on his feet.
Draco shrugged, "There's not much to talk about, he was arrested. He's in Azkaban."
Bones struggled to get to her feet, but didn't hesitate. He pulled out his Peruvian Darkness Powder out. He threw the powder as far into the hall as possible. If Cho and Bones were careful, this gave them a way to escape without being seen.
"Yeah, he'll be fine, but," Potter face twisted, "I… saw it happen."
Draco obeyed. "Obliviate me, please. Mercy Merlin," he begged.
He was given kindness at the funeral of the friend he had killed. Rocks shot against his arms.
"He might be looking for a young bride, someone to continue his legacy," he shrugged.
Potter, he would probably be disgusted. Draco was. How could he explain this to him? Potter didn't need to know, Draco wasn't even told. The announcement probably wasn't going to be made until after the betrothal ceremony, which was going to be this winter break. Draco didn't have to tell him until then. Perhaps then, the subject of Draco's home life would be mentioned. What was expected of him. What he had to do.
"I noticed that you weren't at dinner, so I grabbed a few things. If you're hungry," Draco didn't let him finish.
"I'm disappointed in you, you should know of my brilliance by now," Draco reminded, laying back on the floor.
"I found this old textbook with a bunch of notes in it, I'll show it to you sometime."
He extended his wand into a whip that wrapped Bones arms to her chest and pulled her to the ground. The spell yanked her across the bricks towards him as the whip retracted.
He wasn't to blame for seeing her in the stones of the castle where they had lived for the last five years. She had been here, warm and breathing, just a little over a week ago.
"Cho cried Draco, in the middle of a tea shop," Potter stated.
Draco remained silent, continuing to flex his hand. He shifted in the hard wooden chair that he had been sitting in for an indescribable time. Severus glared at him from the nice arm chair he had placed himself into. They were in the familiar space of Severus's personal study. Draco usually visited for leisurely tea time, not for blundering another student. Sunlight shown through the two large windows that face the lake, and Hagrid's hut.
"Well," Dumbledore grinned, "that went well."
"Invisibility cloak," Potter whispered.
"Twenty points for language, another fifty points for selling tools to disrupt learning to other students and another thirty points for wasting my time," he barked, "…each," he finished, always one to be petty. "Now, piss off."
'A man I don't love.'
Potter huffed, crossing his arms over his chest. That was never a good sign. "Why do you get to tell your friends about us?"
"Really? Fantastic! We can take our time with the walk then," Potter snapped back, his voice too cheerful.
She had lit the lamps along the wall of the narrow basement with a flick of her wand. The basement was empty, a dirt floor, brick walls. One window near the ceiling, the glass was dirty. The moon light barely shown through.
Umbridge pushed Draco aside. He swallowed his fear. Potter was going to get himself killed. What could Draco do? Nothing. He was useless. He was a coward. He would kill to save himself, but he would never put himself in danger. He met Severus's gaze, who gave him a warning look before leaving the room.
When Umbridge left with Potter and his shadows, Draco excused himself before things got ugly in Umbridge's office.
Draco laid in his bunk.
Draco knew himself to be a charming person.
Draco removed the rag gently, he broke out in a cold sweat as the smell of blood invaded his senses even before he finished unwrapping the bloody rag. He was taken back to a night of blood and screams, his sweat cold on his neck. Draco finished removing the rag with a short gasp. This girl was small, making sixty lines seem like eighty. The lines had repeated over, over, over so many times that the words were indescribable. The wound being a singular, large carved of skin, which blood still easily seeped from. Blood poured out of the large wound, dripping onto the floor. Dripping from a hanging mother's body, onto a screaming child-
"Please," Potter whispered. His gaze heavy on Draco.
"Please say something, Draco," Pansy pulled him from him thoughts.
He didn’t love her.
“Just now,” Draco explained. He should be mad, furious even, that Potter had betrayed his trust, but he couldn’t pass the pure relief he felt at seeing Potter. He also couldn't make himself focus. “He wanted to introduce himself.”
"Well, someone has to make sure the Harry Potter has to follow some of the school rules," Draco teased.
"Snape, glad you're here. I can trust you to escort these boys back to the castle?" Tonks stepped out of the train followed by Potter.
"I'm not a Death Eater," Draco snapped.
Draco returned to his work with Bentley curled on his lap. The gentle purring of the animal warmed his heart as he continued with his research. The task almost soothing with his new company.
Footsteps hurried towards the Great Hall, the pair turned the corner. Upon seeing Draco, both Theo and Blaise stopped, the breath gone from their lungs. Draco swallowed, taking in the disheveled appearance at the two, their shoulders were touching, they were standing so close. They were holding hands.
"Does not count as lucky?" Potter pointed out.
"I can see them," Theo saved him, "my Mom died."
"I'm not thinking about Daphne," Draco blurted.
Draco wasn't sure what he was supposed to say.
Draco's body felt too warm in his uniform. He was too warm his Potter's embraced. Potter was just staring at him, a blush over his cheeks. Draco couldn't take this anymore, he quirked his eyebrows in acknowledgement of Potter's gaze. Potter's eyes widen, before he pushed Draco to the ground.
Dumbledore continued, "This does not seem like a reaction to some name calling, would I be correct?"
The breath Potter released told him he definitely succeeded in dampening the mood.
Draco continued with the conversation despite the awkwardness from the three adults. "I'm glad," Draco's voice was too cheerful for a funeral. He was being too transparent in his politeness. He couldn't make himself care. "And I'm going to assume that you've made a full recovery?"
"Shut up and use the book Malfoy," she hushed him easily.
Potter turned his head as he looked out the window. His hand still on Draco's arm, as if he was reminding Draco that his skin was still his own, even if he was branded.
Draco was out of the manor for a day and he was already thinking about kissing Potter.
Bravery is a terrifying idea.
Draco felt a hand on his arm, his shoulder, "Draco," came a gentle voice.
"But if you feel this strongly about giving Ms. Greengrass a guiding hand, I'm sure your betrothal could be arranged," the Dark Lord allowed.
Draco tensed before he could stop himself. He sighed, trying to relax. Potter has proven that he could be trusted, he shouldn't get so defensive.
He worked on the cabinets almost every night he wasn't with Potter.
"So…you can see them?" Potter asked, he was so close that Draco could feel his breath on his face.
Draco leaned forward in his uncomfortable chair, resting his elbows on his knees, "He shoved me, so I punched him."
"Don't be an idiot. Your shadows, do they know?" Draco snapped, all humor gone.
Draco turned, the crowed parted. He had proven his point to Montague, but he needed to make clear where he stood, what he would do if anyone crosses him. "Oh, Montague," his voice chillingly polite as he turned to face the older boy, "before you get any ideas, do remember that that was my first hit. I could do so much more."
"I'm only theorizing, you must understand this is not an exact reading, but I'm inclined to believe that the omen was in reference to a specific, traumatic event. In my experience, that is what causes the strongest reactions from omen fire."
The whip circled around the air, reeling back before lashing at Draco for a second time. Draco rolled out of the way again. Pain screamed across his arm as he barely escaped the fire.
"Me, how can you be okay with being with me?" Potter rushed, his hand tightening over Draco's.
The silencing spell was for quiet whispers across an enchanted mirror. A mirror to a better world than his, a path to Potter.
How much blood would he have on his hands by the end of this war that he was never meant to be a part of?
He was already close enough that Granger, Weasley and Potter had all turned to him. He should say something, something clever, something that would tell Potter he needed to speak to him in private.
Narcisa released Draco's hand as soon as his feet hit the soft grass. He reached out to steady his father with a firm hand on his arm. Lucius flinched out of Draco's grasp. Draco kept his face neutral as he followed his family up the gravel path. Lucius wasn't leaning so heavily on his knee. Draco supposed his father had taken a potion for the pain so that he could appear to be almost regal.
Draco leaned away whenever Potter tried to bring their lips together, still cupping his face.
Potter, slumped in the weight of the war that hadn't started yet. Unsure of how to comfort a crying girl through his own grief. He had so much resting on his thin shoulders, Draco could release some of the pressure. He owned him that.
"Why am I not surprised that it's you getting into trouble?" Severus's familiar voice questioned Draco. Draco turned towards his godfather, only to be met by one risen eyebrow at the sight of his bleeding nose. "Having fun are we?"
"Pansy," Draco greeted. Pansy only smiled at him, empty. Students continued to file into the class, Potter and his shadows passed by without a glance in Draco's direction. When class started, Pansy opened her book to follow along with the Professor's dreary voice.
Draco could only take a breath when she left him. His breaths coming out in painful gasps. He sank to the floor, leaning against the wall. He curled into himself, wrapping his arms around his knees and letting his head fall against them. Sobs clasped his chest.
"So…I guess Draco's not the only one thinking about a pulsing broomstick," Pansy broke the silence.
When the Dark Lord showed Draco how cruel he could be.
Draco tried to ease his concern with, "Half my team, at the most. I'm still the best Seeker in Hogwarts, so I'm not too worried about their attempts at destruction."
"Weasley, perhaps you will find this situation amusing from detention," Severus snapped at Weasley's continued laughter.
"Do tell."
She made to leave, but Draco couldn't let this further weigh on their relationship. Draco stopped her with a gentle hand on her wrist. "I think you're very brave," he complimented with the truth on his tongue. Daphne took his hand, with a squeeze, she left to the dormitories.
"I hate you so much," Potter walked ahead.
Draco watched as Potter looked down at his lips, heat coiled low in Draco's abdomen and along his spine. A breath escaped his lips. Gentle finger tips brushed against his jaw. He held his breath. Fingers travel from his jaw to his cheek.
"Yeah," Draco explained, "he's going to try to find who did this."
Draco continued his lines, bored as all fuck. His head hurt, his lip hurt, his ass hurt. He wondered if Potter was in any pain. His hand would hurt by now, was probably bleeding. Draco would have to make sure Potter properly applied the healing salve and wrapped the wound correctly, he always wraps the bandage too loose. Draco made sure no one tried to fight Potter whenever the Quidditch teams started to fight. However, Potter did tackle Montague, which earned him a bruise on the jaw. Merlin, Draco was destined to be a worried mother, wasn't he?
Severus stilled.
"Because you are the perfect example of reasonable decision making," Draco sneered.
Draco groaned, he was too lazy to move from the comfortable position that took up the entire couch, but Daphne was always dangerously persistent. In compromise, Draco lifted his legs.
The best place to hide books is a library.
"Hold this," he shoved his bookbag into Theo's arms, who took the bag with wide eyes.
Potter blinked at him. "Shut up." He gave Draco an elbow in his ribs and a warm smile.
“I want to,” Draco squeezed Potter’s hand, “I promise.”
"Why are you helping me?" asked the girl.
"I know."
Potter huffed, walking around the couch to sit next to Draco. Draco pulled his legs to his chest to allow room. "Look who's talking, when did you get here?"
Daphne's head snapped back as Montague knocked her with his fist.
"I did."
“Well, done,” the Professor praised, "you may now begin on reviewing your notes for the next exam."
Why? Out of frustration of Draco's daydreaming? What was the true reason?
"Can I see?" Potter asked.
"Yes, no more jokes about Potter's cock at Draco's expense," Daphne agreed with mock seriousness.
Potter was so kind, saying that Draco was only a Death Eater by technicality. He knew better. He knew that whatever made his father into a Death Eater, was also in him. He was twisted in a way that Potter would recoil, retch at the idea of even touching Draco.
Draco grinned, "Yeah," he nodded, "yeah, okay."
The light in the large room was dim, but gentle. Draco's body was tense, waiting for another attack. Nothing. They hadn't been followed. As Draco steadied his breathing, he turned at the sounds of whispers, his wand raised. Potter jumped next to him, his wand raise as well.
"Assuming we're friends," explained Daphne with evil glee. Draco tried to hide his smirk, when he couldn't, Theo punched his arm for laughing.
Severus challenged with, "And what makes you think you can make such a demand?"
Draco watched him leave. He waited a bit before making his way to lunch.
Draco studied the opened large book. The page showed a table. The date on the left side, on the right, shorthanded notes.
Draco bit his lip, "I don't know what you want me to do about it."
Dumbledore's Army.
He motioned for Pansy to walk in front of him, she held the bottle of venom in glass to her chest. She turned the handle on the door-
Draco could feel his nerves grind against each other, he felt raw, exposed. His jaw tightened as he shifted positions. Potter sighed, rubbing the back of his head, "Malfoy, look, I'm not very good at this sort of stuff. Listen, if you ever want to talk about anything, I'm here for you. Without any judgements, okay?"
He should tell Potter how much he missed him. Tell him how Draco counted the days until he could simply glance at him. Tell him how he has kept all of the notes passed between them. Tell him how he has kept a clipping for Potter from the Daily Profit from the tournament last year that makes him seem handsome. Tell him how scared Draco is for him. Tell him of all the dangers that wait for Potter, damn the consequences. Tell him that Draco hopes more than anything that teaching Potter Occlumency will be enough to help Potter win this war that is coming from all sides.
He could hear Potter breathing next to him. "Just friends?" Potter asked.
"Umm… I'm okay…" Potter answered.
"Really? Was that a… complement? From Draco Malfoy? You make grown men cry and weep for their mothers, yet you share a good word to me? I'm honored," Potter deadpanned.
Their footsteps the only sound in the halls as they stayed closer than needed. Draco let Potter lead him where he may as he took in the sight of his castle. He drunk in the place of where he grew up. Where he had his first kiss. Made his first best friend.
"Obstacles? Who would dare?" Draco gasped.
The walk to the Great Hall was a quiet one. Lights out was in an hour, most students had taken to their Common Rooms. Draco wasn't feeling patient, so he took a less travel routine, taking the west stairs up to the main hall. The west stairs were narrow with no paintings along the way. Few torches supplied little light. He paused whenever he heard a voice, a quiet, girl voice. Draco poked his head around the corner, Mafalda was sitting on the stairs, accompanied by a familiar orange cat.
A dry laugh escaped Draco's lips before he let Potter go. He instantly missed Potter's touch as he pulled away as well. "Potter, you know why."
"Who are you?" Potter demanded.
Daphne laid on her back on the table where his plate should be. Her hair was long, her eyes were bright and she was crying. She wore her pale blue robes. He couldn't move as she held his gaze, tears streaming down her face. She brought her hands up and dug into herself through her sternum. She broke apart her ribcage with a moist crack. Her heart was exposed, the organ beating with a thud that filled his ears. Her heart was ready for him to eat.
Potter held his eyes, Potters eyes were so green, even at a distance, before glancing towards the exit. Draco looked away, knowing what to do. He waited a minute before excusing himself to the lavatory.
"It's not yours either."
Potter was looking at him. An intensity in the gaze made Draco aware of just how close Potter was. How Draco hands were on his back.
"Sit up, I have your dinner ready," Severus spoke as he carried a tray towards the bed.
Crabbe's confusion was almost comical. Pansy looked betrayed within her shock.
"May I make a suggestion?" Draco toed the line while giving his Lord the power.
Draco didn’t blame her.
Everything being considered, Theo probably didn't do his best on Professor McGonagall's exam. He let both Draco and Daphne know exactly how they were responsible while they left the classroom during switch period, lecturing them both on their shameful acts the night before.
He corrected Theo's homework, who was barely paying attention. Eventually, he turned back to his own assignment.
That wouldn't work. The blame would fall on the absent Dumbledore rather than Umbridge or the Ministry, which would be counterproductive. What Potter needed was a platform, he had the name and agency. People had to know that the Dark Lord was back, the Ministry needed to get their heads out of their asses before the Dark Lord gained too much power to fight.
