Draco shook his head. “We can’t. They are our key out of this city. We can use them.”
Only thing, he was afraid. Scared shitless as his eyes widened in realization After all, it was like Theo had always said,
each other!! There is no
Merlin how he wished those flames would actually burn his father to nothing but ash.
"Really? Than how did you know that I've been out past curfew for the past
Pain greets him like a bolt of lightning, spiraling up his arm, and crackling down his spine. Draco had expected it to be painful, but it was a risk he was willing to take.
His kidnapper frowned narrowing his eyes. “Normally we don’t negotiate with thieves, but I’ll make an exception.”
She noticed Malfoy wince, and stop for barely a second, and continued tretching in the snow, pretending he didn't hear her.
Draco glared, and took in another deep breath trying to keep his mind away from the fortunate that were still currently surrounding them. Chained maybe, but Draco still didn’t feel safe. “Fine...but you will not touch my friend, and let him go. You dare lay a hand on him, and I’ll kill all of you.
Draco gulped.
“What are you going to do?” Draco question not daring to break eye contact, and Draco swear what follows next made him almost shit himself.
“My room.” Harry replied after a beat and Draco felt his heart thunder. Rooms?
'. His breath hitched and he softly traced the words with the soft of his thumb. Potter would do this? It had to be. No one else had a writting as sloppy as him.

They were around him, merely an arms length away, and he was an arms length away from them. That’s what terrified him. They were so close.
house.
Malfoy in the process. So why was it that the blonde was only getting more and more wearier. His skin pale, and almost sick looking even through the glamour. Hands were shaking, and his posture less...
And then Draco shot forward, covering his sisters body with his own to protect her from the wind. He shivered, starting to feel his hands go numb already.
“And why not?!”
“Cruci–”
“What?”
"Ron! Are you listening? Did you even hear anything I said??"
That's when Malfoy turned around, and grey met green. Harry flushed and the other boy's lip curved up, nostrils flared and sneered. Harry wipped his head around almost instantly and looked down at his half eaten plate.
Potter snapped his eyes up, meeting his eyes. “What caused those panic attacks? I swear I didn’t know what was going on...so I’m sorry for leaving you alone during them..Mione’ told me and Merlin’s sake...I didn’t know,” Potter rambled, before Draco cut him off.
Potter coughs, blood dribbling from his lips. “No.”
“It’s okay, hero-boy. It’s kinda like the insomnia...I can’t exactly
His food, was a simple plain green apple. Everyone else ate with their plate full. It's not that Draco ate any less, it's just his sleeping habits. They make him uneasy in the stomach causing him to lose his appetite. If it weren't for Pansy and Blaise, he probably wouldn't have eaten anything.
Draco didn’t bother with the stupid foreplay, instead running straight ahead and catching the other by surprise. He pushed the raven, attempting to get him to slip back in the mud pile. However, things don’t always go as planned.
Blaise facepalmed. "It's a muggle saying draco! It's like a short from of asking someone what they are doing..or how things are going."
anymore!”
“Do not resist,” a voice came from one of the masked figures beside him. Draco froze. He’d recognize that voice from anywhere.
Draco imagines the curly black hair, the gloriously tanned skin with he splatter of freckles, and the smell of cheap cologne dripping off from his shirt. The one he seemed to wear every fucking day.
New chapter!! It's kinda sad and depressing, I know, but do not worry....never mind. The next chapter will probably be just as sad and depressing. Anyways, hope you guys like it!! Be sure to review!! Until next time~
Draco paused for a moment, when the realization dawned upon him. Why in Merlin would Potter put his wand away right after Draco had broken the suffocating spell?
Potter!? First with the nonsense with the photos, and now this?! Accusing him for the photos was one thing. But this?!
"Oh,"
“Ok, you
This pain felt endless...was death supposed to be this long? He didn't really want to die, and every growing second was giving him false hope that he would live. The false hope was worse. Were the fates so revolted with him that they wouldn't even give him as much as a peaceful death. He supposed his first theory was right. Someone up there really did fucking hate him. That was all up until, the gold plated door slammed open, a mast of black unruly hair sweeping towards him in an alarmingly fast rate.
Harry took a step closer and Draco scrambled back holding the twisted spring out as a warning.
"Potter!! You let go of me this instant! POTTER!!" Draco yelled as his feet were forced forward away from the table and towards the exit and Potter would've succeeded in his attempt of kidnapping Draco if it weren't for Pansy and Blaise that stood in his way. Oh, lord bless these two heavenly being that have decended from heaven...No...scratch that...They were demons.
Dumbledore smiled yet again. And to the other, it almost looked a little creepy. As if he was finally having a dream come true.
He scrambled backwards, trying to gain any distance between the unfortunate and him, but in no avail. His heart was thumping, words stuck at the tip of his tongue. He wanted to cry out for help, for someone.
Voltron4life.
And this was danger. This...this
Draco frowned looking over to Potter...wait.
Draco wanted to laugh at the obvious lie. It wouldn’t just pinch, it would burn. And burn it did. He screamed. Trashed, and tried to curl up in his own body, snarling when Potter kept him pinned to the bed with his left arm. “LET GO!!! STOP!
“STOP! STOP!!” Draco begs, tuning in with Granger’s own pleas of mercy. His voices left unheard, and Draco swears he’s never seen Weasley this angry before. It was his fault...all Draco’s fault. “...
And he’s so fucking selfish.
“Fine,” he muttered through gritted teeth. He held out his broom to Potter who snatched it away from his gloved hands.
“Lily wants Draco to play too!! Draco plays too!!” the toddler spoke, smile blinding. The others gave a distasteful look, but he paid no heed. His sister was looking at him with hopeful eyes, and if this was her wish, then so be it.
Potter hurt him. Potter...
“What’s got our Blondie all bruised up, Mione’?” Draco shot his head up to look at the owner of the new voice. Black hair, piercing emerald eyes, and the classic 90’s mullet. The raven was standing next to Redhead, looking no less amused than the other.
There were people.
Draco gulped, trying to crawl further back into the chair, but in no avail. The man reached forward grabbing his jaw in a bruising grip forcing Draco to keep his gaze locked with the raven, and he had to bite his lip to keep from crying out in pain. “Name Blondie,” the Raven stated out, no longer a question but a demand.
“You aren’t going to escape.”
Draco grumbled, pushing the broom behind his back. “I was going out for a walk. I am sick of being cocooned in the pighole. Surely you wouldn't have a problem with that, Potter, or are you planning on keeping me locked in this house for the rest of my life.”
"But you need to sleep."
"Sod off, Zabini"
The pressure increased, and Draco gasped, trying to take in any air he could get. He regretted
“It means
The trio remained quiet before him, and Draco raised his head to look at them. “How did you all manage to secure such a place..if you were new here.”
Wrong move.
He let out a small cry, feeling the metallic taste spread like wildfire through his mouth. He spit out a glob of blood, and brought his head back up to give the other a toothy grin. “Feisty.”
Draco furrowed his eyebrows confused, and Harry decided to relieve him of the suspense. “We all started off here, but we’re returning.”
Draco wanted to hit himself for them. Why would he say that? God damnit..his people skills have really hit a rock bottom. The brunette gave him a unamused glower, before turning to carrot top. “Go get the other.”
He felt nothing but pure anger towards Malfoy. Harry knew that the boy infront of him would occasionally mess with his friends. Bully them. But this time, he'd gone to far. To the point of no return.
“By the way, you still owe me that treacle tart you promised...”
put those pictures around the school!
He hugged her and lifted her off the ground. Draco felt a little releaved. His legs weren't injured. Even if they were, it wasn't as if he could feel them. They were numb. From either the pain or the cold. He didn't know nor cared, he could at least get Lilly to the 'safe place'.
Draco is confused, lost, unsure with what he has done. These past two years, he had been telling himself that betraying the Third Eye was for the best. It was the only way to ensure survival for all those outside the walls.
P.S I wrote this at 12 at night, and didn't have the will power to grammar check or read it over twice.
“Harry–stop...we’ll talk to them back at the base.”
When the cup was emptied, he looked and the face of Molly Weasley came before him. Draco gagged and moved away, in horror. Why was he with a Weasley? A..a
Draco stood abruptly from the ground and shoved a finger at Potter's chest. "Oh really, Potter?
,” the blonde whined. “That’s the problem.”
They didn’t let Draco meet Blaise. That was the worst part about this capture. He didn’t know where he was, hell alone how far away from the surface he was. It was dark...and cold.
"Ok...so the stairs started to move, a-and I lost my balance and slipped thus m-making me fall down the stairs," Malfoy said with a shaky voice. Madame Pomfrey on the other sighed and waited in silence, as if expecting more from the injured boy infront of her. Draco groaned. "Ok..so
Draco winced a little with the tone of her harshness. It was true. They really did have no reason to help him or rather keep them here. Not with the way he'd treated them. He felt his anger, that had been peaking it's way up, now drooping.
Draco rolls his eyes, wondering what his next move should be. Should he tell them? Tell them about the mass of black running up the white of his arm. Tell them about the cure...if it even was a cure. Nonetheless, Draco liked to think it was what could save them all. Gave him hope for a future...a
"Why would you come here??"
He remembers snooping in his mother and father’s negotiations with their new boss. He remember betrayal, and pain and heartbreak. He remembers running away that night. How he’d gotten his friends together, how they’d shut down the entire facility, and how he’d stolen the one serum that could decide of the survival of mankind. He remembers feeling like a hero. He wanted to be a hero.
” the raven growls, pulling his back up by the hair, and pulling hard. Tears leaked from Draco’s eyes, pain growing by every waiting moment. “You think I didn’t have a chat with your other friend before I came up here?”
There was a moment of silence before the other replied. “You’re right. Let’s go.”
“Can’t sleep, Blondie?”
Draco let out a small gasp, placing a hand up to his chest. “What’s this, Potter?
Draco shushed up immediately. He looked frightened. Fuck. He was frightened.
"Alright, fine. You can go,
Draco knew that feeling. He grew up with it. Gripped its hand as it would drag him deeper into the depths of the forests, promising a way out, only to get more entangled. Lost. Unsure. Oblivious?
"Yup!"
” Draco whispered, voice cracking after every letter. Fingers trembling like they’d never done before, vision blurring, and collapsing upon itself. The tightness in his chest, so strong, it was as though he was choking, suspended upside down by a single thread. And it
Draco hissed, snarling at his captor. “Listen here, you asshole. This is a
He grins weakly, holding a middle finger to the door, knowing full well the other could not see him. “Fuck you, mullet head!” And with that he sprints down the hall, heading for the second left. He’d mapped out the journey to the little bunker over and over again. Now he only hoped he could somehow find Blaise in all this chaos. If he was lucky, the sun would have long set, but he couldn’t put his faith on luck.
He pulled his own cloak off himself, leaving only his blood soaked shirt to protect himself from the bitter, dry wind. Draco wrapped the little figure with the cloak and kissed her head with cracked lips.
Harry had tried to say otherwise, reason with her, but all his attempts came out futile.
Constructive criticism or i any suggestions for the plot? Let me know down below! Until next time!
Draco was now only functioning on the pure wonder of coffee. This was the 4th day he hadn't slept at all. Not even a blink. The bags around his eyes were prominent and his friends yelling didn't help.
Madame Pomfrey on the other hand beamed with delight and smiled sweetly at Potter. "Oh, I knew I could count on you. When did we ever find such a wonderful student like you?"
Potter frowned at his insult towards their home. “It’s past midnight, Malfoy. Last time I checked, people don’t go on walks in the middle of the night, and especially not with a broom.”
Draco pulled the sleeve up gently. Draco looks closer down at the hand, and sees the words
"Cuz it involves Malfoy. For all you know he might be up to something. After all he's been acting a little strange. You know for the past few days he sneaks out after curfew and he drinks more water than before now!!"
The raven in front of him paused, causing Draco to bump into his back. “Let you go?” The raven questioned, turning around.
Draco grinned, satisfied, and worked back to turn the mattress back over and pushed off to the corner in its original position. He gripped the spring tight in his palm, the edge sticking out from the space between his fingers.
“It’s not the same,” Draco grumbled, thinking back to the time Harry hugged him, holding him close, and refusing to let him go. It wasn’t the best way to get Draco to calm down, but hey! It worked, and now that he thinks about it, it was definitely worth it.
chat. You even started asking questions.”
Harry Potter will help get Draco Malfoy on our side!"
“NO!” Draco blattered out, sounding more frantic than he should have. “Don’t....please..”
He didn’t want to end up like
hesitate to tie you down to this bed if it should
Draco didn’t dare look back, as the probe slowly began to slip past the barrier, the light flaring up against his skin. It was warm...burning. Scalds and hot welts began to form on the tip of his skin, and he let out an anguished cry.
He wonders if he can trust these people, but decides against it. For all he knew, they might just boil them alive, and chew their chopped up pieces down as dinner but something was different about these people.
“Good. Why were you stealing from us?”
Ah...fuck. He really was royally fucked. He was too deep in, and with his father snooping around on his every move, Draco wasn’t sure what to do.
He puffed his chest in a play full manner.
It was all going to leave, and Draco would be alone once again. The body holding him shifted, and Draco braced himself for the cold. Only the cold never came.
"Draco-" Potter growled in warning, and Draco froze again. Right. He probably shouldn't
See a mistake? Tell me! Both criticism, and suggestions for the plot are greatly appreciated.
Potter growled and clenched his open hand into a fist. His jaw tightened and he shook. '
The blonde looked up a little, taking note of the people around him. His expressions softening, and bare of his usual defenses...
"Ok, that's it!" Draco beamed in victory, but it was short-lived. Potter marched towards him, grabbing his arm, and pushing him down on the bed.
“Deal.”
. He didn't want to say anything, and hell he'd do
Draco closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and sends his thanks to whatever gods are still on his side. The monster is a fucking idiot.
Another Sarah.
He leaves no room for argument, and Draco slumps in his arms giving up. It’s a war he can’t win. He takes in Potter’s ridiculous outfit. Pajamas covered in a series of comical owls, and a night-shirt in the most hideous yellow Draco had ever seen.
He heard Potter groan and grinned in victory. "
"What do you mean
," He mocked.
before him wasn’t a person, but a monster hiding in the skin of some man. He knows. Draco knows what it is. He
Both criticism and suggestions for the plot are greatly appreciated!
The soles of his feet were blistered, and his eyes drooped threatening to close and give up on Draco then and there. He hadn’t slept for the last three days. Not since the incident. He’d offered to take up on ‘watch-duty,’ knowing Blaise needed sleep more than he did. But that was before they were captured by this group, and tied up.
"Trouble going back to sleep, Malfoy?"
“Needed food.” Draco kept his answers short, careful not to reveal anything he didn’t want to.
It was a problem. It was a huge problem. Something Draco wouldn’t have even considered if it had been two years ago. He couldn’t fall in love with the son of his father’s blood sworn enemy...but merlin was he hot.
Harry grabbed him by the waist, keeping his up while dragging him around the unfortunates, and towards the door. Just as they reached the door, the raven glazed back, meeting Draco’s eyes. He flashed him a toothy grin, and his eyes gleamed with a shade of green he couldn’t exactly make out. “
“Yeah...” the raven trailed off, pulling at his sleeved once again.
Snarling, the raven dragged him out of the bedroom door, all the while Draco struggled. He twisted, squirmed, kicked, and trashed in the frightening hold. Hell, he ever tried biting. Turning to the ways of the unfortunate. Draco was desperate.
Tears blurred his vision, and threw off his aim. He blinked vigorously, trying to get rid of his temporary disadvantage, as a few tears spilled from his swollen eyes. It was dark, so the other wouldn't be able to see his pathetic breakdown, and somehow that put it him in foolish relief.
he thought, taking another swing of the blade at the boy, this time digging deep in his forearm.
Harry felt himself drop to his knees, and pull the limp body up in his arms, closer to his own self. Cold. So contradicting from his own. He was warm. Too warm, to the point where it burned. And the feeling of Malfoy's body to his felt better. Gave him a sense of the freshness, a break in this scorching heat. This madness. It made him feel almost...
, and he could do nothing about it.
Draco had entended to say more, but he was cut off.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco wasn’t sure exactly how he had failed them, or why. He just knew it was somehow his fault. Maybe if he’d seen the signs before the first outbreak. Maybe, if he’d taken a right instead of a left, then he would've seen them, and maybe he could’ve saved them from turning. Maybe if he’s put his attention to formulating a cure rather than selfishly trying to survive. He didn’t know.
"Big boys don't cry!"
“Let’s talk!” the boy beamed and it made Draco uncomfortable. How was it that Potter could go from angry to happy so easily? He had made sure to use the most painful insults. The ones that always pushed Potter to the edge. So what was so different this time?
"Oh and Harry dear, can you make sure that Draco is actually
“Positive.” the raven stated, his face mostly dark from the lack of light, but the gleam of green in his eyes was unmistakable.
He imagined it’s look like water, but gentle. Flowing softly in wisps through the tips of his fingertips to wrap itself around the pole to the circular end of the probe. Soft ripples turned to violent waves moving across the mass of the barrier all the way around the house. It gave off a soft glow, which was only turning sharper by the second. The area around the probe, turned a neon blue, almost white, but he could still make out the blue tint. He winced slightly, eyes narrowing as the intensity of the barrier glow. It shone bright, no doubt already alerting the residents of the house.
And as for why Draco refers to Harry as "it" in the end of the chapter will be revealed later on in the story, but few free to speculate!
Harry's head dropped and his face darkened. Hair fell like wisps over his face and anger radiated from him.
He gave Pansy a knowing look, and she returned it with a sly smirk. God, he loved slytherins. Sure they were all assholes, but they were some loyal assholes. Something you couldn’t even find in a hufflepuff. Slytherins were one of a kind.
"Don't call me Draco! We are not friends,
“Names,” Harry demanded, and Draco wanted nothing more than to bash that stupid face in against the wall.
Harry!
Harry flops down on his bed, and groans.
Draco gasped, when he felt the unfortunate fall onto his body limp. He could feel its teeth grazing his shoulder, but not biting. Still....and unmoving.
“Why do you even care?” Potter asked after a long pause. “I can clearly recall you saying, she was nothing more than another
The hazy figure of the raven stood up, saying something Draco couldn’t really make out. Or maybe he just didn’t want to hear it. With the way the figure walked out from the room, running a hand through its hair, a habit that Potter had grown quite fond of. Draco doubted Potter had anything good to say. Just more painful words, which were the tiniest bit more agonizing that his father’s cane.
Malfoy could feel his hair standing on his back as Harry became more and more distant. Had he gone to far?
"Please..P-please," the boy moaned.
"ITS NOT A GOOD PLAN!!!!"
“Draco??” a high squealing voice came from beside him, reeling him away from his thoughts. Pansy.
“Please..” she whispered, not sure to whom...
Draco froze.
Draco is terrified.
Tear poured like an unbroken stream from his eyes, his cheeks puffing up, and turning red.
Draco's face brightened instantly and he tried to stand, and moaned a little when he accidently stepped on his bad ankle, but didn't say anything. Maybe Mrs Weasley didn't hate him as much as he suspected after all? Maybe!-
and maybe she had time, she'd make some some coffee cake to go along with
He couldn’t even do something heroic without crying. Why was he this
"I swear if you did
just a few moments ago?!” Draco yells, deranged, heart thumping at the speed of a thousand horses. “Let her go..let her go or else–”
” Draco started as though trying to talk to a child. “We are literally having an interrogation session right now. Not exactly something
Hands trembling, and breath shaky, he gripped glass shard, placing it against the barrier. The touch sending gentle ripples through the surface. It didn’t take long before he pushed the probity probe up against it. The cool metal of the probity probe pressed flat against his hand, as he tried to feel his magic.
Draco cowered on his spot on the other side. He could make out a hazy figure of Granger rushing out of the house, followed by Weasley. They were yelling something at the raven, and oh how he wished he could hear.
That was something they’d learned a long time ago. They weren’t going to repeat their mistake again. Not again.
The branched cut through his skin, like small daggers hanging from the ceiling.
Pansy looked offended. "Of course I know what that is! It's cuffee. We have that stuff all around my manor!" She raised her chin and smirked defiantly.
She could head the nails being dragged weakly down the door, and then a slump. That's when she heard the croaking voice.
“Yes way.”
It was only minutes, but felt as like ages as Draco sat there. Pathetic, and shaking in front of the burnt-out fireplace. He turned his head to look at the clock. He had to go meet Potter soon. Either that, or have Potter drag him from his dorms in front the entire Slytherin population. Oh if only his father knew.
The plate is empty, and Draco feels the slightest bit proud of himself. His stomach feels horribly stuffed threatening to come up, but he gulps it back down. Eyes shifting to the side, he takes in the figure of a curled up shivering elf on the porcelain tiles. Bones prodding from his torn, moldied clothings. Chains clawing into their skin spilling dirty blood all over the white. The elf is quiet.
A joke.
” a soft whisper came from the corner of the dorm room.
It’s empty, and the smell of fresh meat and fruit still busting through his nostrils. He feels full. Every ounce of his stomach stuffed with the contents of his plate. His lips tug up the slightest bit, and Draco looks up at the rest of the members around the table.
...he starts to cry.
Draco glared. “I ain’t tellin’ you shit, Mullet Head!”
. His lips curled upwards, and he smiled the biggest smile he had in a long time. Smiled till it reached the tip of his ears, till his eyes watered, and threatened to spill. Till the guilt poured out from his lungs and his breath no longer felt locked up in this cage he’d made for himself. Till he no longer cared, because the truth was bitter, and he wondered if Potter had figured it out.
Harry frowned. Sure he got this overexposure thing, but a part of what Malfoy was saying seemed to be rather
“Were?”
........
Draco was getting desperate. He pressed the muggle Bell again and again, and rested his head to the door. His legs bucked and he stumbled to the ground, hitting the door in a frantic manner. In any other situation it would've been funny. Seeing the great Slytherin prince hit himself on the head with Weasley's door.
He rose from his seat, and turned to follow his two friends, before a hand clasped onto his wrist and pulled on him to follow. A few gasps gave away around him, and Draco turned around to greet the source of the foreign hand.
“Don’t sound so worried, Weasley. It’s not that bad.” Draco whispers in the shunned silence, almost in disbelief. His father makes a reach for him, but Draco steps back, pressing the blade deeper. “Uh uh...You come anywhere close to me, and I’ll do it. I-I’ll do it.”
Maybe he could just give up now? Just let go for a moment...
He clutched onto Potter’s blankets, his breaths coming out as silent pleas for him. He couldn’t breathe. His lungs filled beyond capacity, and forcing themselves to hold. Feeling the tension build, and the walls begin to collapse. Closing in upon his quivering self.
(See the end of the chapter for
that was even possible. "Now, my dear Malfoy, why would I do that? This is
Draco thought.
Draco blinked at those words. They would send someone alone on look-out? “To send someone alone...isn’t that dangerou–”
Draco wanted to close his eyes, but something kept them open. He didn’t
He looked down at his own plate. Full, and turning cold waiting for him to put it into his mouth. He poked a small piece of meat, pressing it into his mouth, and chewing slowly. Draco savoured the taste. Salt, with the tanginess of the lemon bursting onto his taste buds.
He'd suffered through nightmares, and still does. The death of his loved ones haunting his every dream, but never did he have reaction this bad. Well, not unless he's just witnessed a vision or a scene through the eyes of Voldemort, but Malfoy didn't have to deal with that. So why would Malfoy react in such a way. And that made it all the more less believable. He looked down at the sleeping figure and ran his hand through the other's hair.
That meant...
” skills.
Wasn’t that why Potter, and his family had tried to nurse him back to health. So they could find out all they could about the dark lord? Draco wasn’t a fool. He’d heard them talking. Trying to figure out what to do with his useless existence. He’d heard.
(See the end of the chapter for
Potter let out a gasp and put his hands over his chest mockingly. "Oh my, such vulgur language and that too from a noble pure blood. Tsk. Tsk."
From the corner of his eye, he can see the newcomer scoff and its then she decides she doesn't like this man. She frowns slightly, no longer feeling the same excitement she did when they first caught them. Capturing two lone wolves was a good sign. It meant there was a reason the two were lone wolves and not part of a pack. Maybe their pocket had kicked them out...maybe they’d run. Either way, she knows they have information and knowledge that has long been forgotten and lost.
The rules had kept them alive for this long, and he doubted they would fail him this time. That’s when it hit him. His mistake. It was too easy. Far too easy. Rule number three,
"Oh dear, do you remember that you showed up bleeding on my doorstep."
were after him, for something he didn’t remember doing, but knew he’d done. Something important enough for Draco to erase parts of his own memories.
His thoughts linger back to Sarah. His first patient. And back then, hope was something he had clung to desperately. He’d watched her get better, only to find another soulless creature. She was a necessary sacrifice, he’d convinced himself. For the better of humanity.
He knows escape is futile whether he ran or not, but he couldn't help but feel the fear crawl up to the tip of his fingertips, telling him to run. To run and
Draco woke up cold. Something he had become all too familiar with. His hand had been moved behind his back, legs bound tight together, and he groaned as a piercing pain shot up his spine to the back of his head.
Blood drips to the floor, looking oddlyblack on the floor below. It dripped fast, with no signs of stopping, and Draco trembled, his hand clenched tight on the spring. The spring’s sharp end dug deep into Harry’s palm. The raven wrapped his injured hand wrapped around Draco’s squeezing the spring tighter in his hand.
Draco looked suprised. He had expected a dead for an apology, something in return. Something to make him replay for his
"The more I think I know you, the more baffled I become. What is it with you, Malfoy? Coming into my life, and not making me able to push you away." He mumbled, and dropped down on the other side of the bed. Harry looked up at the ceiling and sighed. He had no idea how he was going to pull through everything. He had no real idea on how to defeat Voldemort, and it's been months since they had started to work on figuring out what the horcruxes were, and with no luck. He turned to his side, pulling the covers over him, careful not to take them away from Malfoy.
Mrs Weasley looked straight into Draco's eyes and glared.
"I-I...I knew you were up to something so-"
From the corner of his eye, he can see his men begin to drag the body out of the warehouse, shooting nay unfortunate that had the misfortune of approaching them.
They were gaining up on him, and he didn’t know how much longer he could carry on. His arms aching with every blow, and swing of his bat. Sweat dripped down from his forehead to his chin. He didn’t dare to lick it. It could’ve been mixed in with unfortunate blood, and no way in hell was he going turn by drinking in his own sweat. No matter how much his throat craved it.
He’s pissed, but nervous. The raven before him is in sense...
“We have to find a way out of here,” Blaise whispered frantically, eyes wide and fearful. Draco raised an eyebrow. Had Blaise found out what they really were? Did he know about the experiments? “We
“Shut up, Potter. I’m only asking you
"She's alright. You can go see her too."
"So...What happened?"
“I can’t like him!!” he groans, feeling a sense of dread wash over him.
Why...
"Open the door," he ordered.

“How’s it going,
"Extremely sorry, but could you repeat that again?"
Pansy and Blaise jumped away, and their hands moved towards their wands.
Draco scrambled to the limp body, and brushed the snow off her face, and layed her head in his lap. He patted her cheek, calling out her name.
"I-I didn't want you to think that I have some sort of problem, which I don't!" Draco exasperated.
“Oh.”
"You mean to tell me..." He started, before pushing Draco through the door, "...that
His lips graze against Draco’s neck, and he could feel the warmth of Potter’s breath along with the wetness of the blood seeping out from the raven’s mouth.

Draco didn't answer to the innocent voice and mounted on the broom, Lilly still in his arms. He rose slowly, adjusting Lilly's weight so she wouldn't fall.

"You're telling me to shut up!! NO ONE TELLS ME TO SHUT UP! My own mother doesn't tell me to shut up!!! YOU CANT TELL ME TO SHUT UP EITHER!!!"
Draco sniffled, taking in another gasp of air, his fingers still shaking, convulsing. He peered up, not bothering to wipe the trails his hot tears had left behind. He only curled up tighter, wrapping his arms around his trembling body.
“Are you...okay?”
The raven frowns. “You have to sleep at least 8 hours a day.”
Hermione had half the mind to stop, and hug her friend, tell him that it wasn’t his fault. He didn’t know, but it was already to late. The raven shot off, sprinting down the hall, and disappearing around the corner before she could as much as take another hasty step forward.
It wasn’t as though it’d matter either way. Draco already knew the outcome. There was no way he would be able to kill a wizard who’s had more than a hundred years of experience ahead of him. Did he mention the old man was also supposedly one of the most powerful wizard aside from the Dark Lord and all those other old grumpy old bearded men that always greeted you with a long warm creepy ass smile that Draco absolutely despised.
He swallowed, feeling gravity inch them closer, the space closing in on them. And the outside world doesn't seem to matter, almost ceasing to exist. They could kiss at this rate, and he was so close...
When Harry retuned to the room, he found the body of Draco Malfoy sleeping softly in his bed. He looked over to the night stand, and found the vial missing. Looking down, he found it shattered to pieces on the ground. Sighing softly, he cast a soft
His parents would've probably been proud. Only
me!" Malfoy cut in. He sneered, and glared at Harry, just like he'd done to him before.
Pain came next. The death of his friends. He remembers them pushing his mother into the hoarding pile of Unfortunates. Remembers her screams as they ripped her apart, bite after bite. Remembers the sadistic cackles that followed. He remembers hiding the serum...running away from the cursed object once and for all. He remembers running, because only he knew. He’d told no one...not even Blaise.
Seemed nice when she was younger, but she was learning. Late maybe, but as her final moments were drawing closer, she was beginning to see the lie. It was an inconvenient truth. Something she, nor anyone else could ever change. There was never any happy ending.
His eyes wandered over Potter's shoulder taking in the surrounding. This was the infirmary, but
"Typical." And Draco felt his heart drop. "Honestly, Malfoy, I knew you were a drama queen, but do you really have to do this?"
Malfoy's movements halted for a moment and he continued. "You, the son of a death eater, and me the savior of the wizarding world, the one who is meant to keep death eaters like
He ran his hand through the other's hair, feeling the blood seep onto his fingers, tainting them in red. Harry's bottom lip quivered, and his hands shook when they brushed away from the blonde.
have to do what we say.”
' he'd told Lilly about. He'd been so desperate that he had gotten on his knees and begged. Draco grimaced at the thought. He'd stooped so..so
"Oh yeah Potter? And what was that?"
"You're smiling," Potter told him.
, like the rest of his body. The thick atmosphere was still there, making it difficult for him to breath even though there was nothing to choke him. So why? Why did it feel like he was sinking. Drowning. His movement slow as if he were moving in water.
Potter sighed. Warm fingers pulled at his bandages, carefully peeling them off, and cringing as they came in contact with the sickening blobs of puss. It was disgusting. It really was.
Draco bit his lip nervously, before noticing the small twitch of the other’s lips. “Wait–” he started, eyeing the large pile of mud and uck in the other’s hands. “Potter...” he warned, taking a step back.
If they were angry then, they sure were now. Draco was being pulled away from them, and maybe that’s what made the unfortunates mad. Or maybe it was the fact that he was the one being freed, when Draco truly didn’t deserve it. He didn’t deserve such treatment. Didn’t deserve to be freed or let go. If anything, he should be left to rot with the unfortunates. The ones who understood him best. The ones who knew how selfish he was. How cruel and sickening he’d become.
” the voice hissed, threatening and violent all the same.
“Who...
Today, Draco uncovered one of nature’s greatest secrets. Someone. It doesn’t exactly matter who...whether it be Merlin, or Christ, or what the muggles seemed to call god.
go through it the previous times, only this time he felt this sort of thrill. A terrible want. It was like an itch underneath his skin and when Harry scratched at it, he felt satisfied.
and he fucking hated it.
"Love? Where did LOVE come into this!!??"
“S-sorry father.” Draco swallowed, coughing a little. “Yes, it is clear. I will not disappoint.”
He had to find a way out. Without...Potter or anyone else finding him.
His name doused with suspicion, and mistrust on their poisoned tongues.
Blaise out of here. He couldn’t leave Blaise behind, couldn’t handle the pressure of being alone. He’d have lost his mind in hours had he been left alone outside.
“Told ya you weren’t going to get away.”
The bed dipped, and Draco bit his lip bracing for the agony that was to follow. “Hold still...this might pinch a little.”
Draco moved swiftly by the old house, Blaise following behind. They had long gotten away from the hoard of unfortunates. They’d rested, drinken the last of their water, and eaten the last can of beans. Neither of them dared to touch the final piece of gum that lay protected in the confinement of his pockets.
Draco gasps slightly, feeling himself being reeled back into reality. Greasy, damp, concrete walls, a winding hallway before him and a psychopath asking him if he was okay.
There was Blaise, struggling in the dark against the hold of another male. Red hair, and pale skin. A blade of held up against Blaise’s throat and it made Draco’s heart drop.
A chuckled emerged from the other boy, ss he crept closer, causing Draco to shift back onto the bed further away from Saint Potter.
nights?"
The raven–Harry closed his eyes out of annoyance or defeat. Draco couldn’t tell. “We are not!” Granger persists, tongue dripping with poison.
only if you promise to meet me by the black lake tomorrow night before curfew ends. Do we have a deal?"
And Draco sobbed. For the first time, his cries loud, and pained. He clenched the shirt in his fists fearing if he didn't hold on tight enough, it might slip out from his fingertips.

Why didn't Potter just understand?
” Potter repeated, once again asking his unspoken questions.

Potter snarled. "I have every right to accuse you! You...foul loathed son of a

"And what if I did? Still doesn't change the fact that you stalked me. Fucking queer."
to do it yourself, so you’re getting the others to do your dirty work?” he mocked.
why I am here!," He gritted. This woman had no right to interfere in his life.
“–She can handle her own,” Harry cut in. “Now, enough about us...”
Harry was confused, so very very confused. Why wasn't Madame Promfrey mad at him, anymore importantly why hadn't Draco said anything about what had happened earlier? This isn't what was supposed to happen. He was supposed to be in St. Mungos, perhaps even Azkaban. They were supposed to be shocked, and disgusted by him...
Draco rolled his eyes. “I-I don’t know,” he confessed.
” he said, whispering to Pansy this time.
Her little hands find her way out of the cloaks and to Draco cheeks.
No. He was
Draco looked away, biting the inside of his cheek. His face was flushed, and now he had even begun to pull at the flash around his nails. He never did that!
He had to warn Blaise, and leave. Now!
was. But knowing his father as the coward he was, he wouldn’t as much as utter a hint about him and it was wiser to do so. He unconsciously rubbed a hand on his trembling wrist, and swallowed his growing nerves. “Y-yes, father.”
Potter gave him a small vary look. “
Draco sits in silence, mind screaming, telling him to do something. Anything. And he trusts it, afterall, it is the only thing that has kept him alive for so long. Not wasting anymore time, he flips the mattress over, tearing at its seams with his fingers. It’s a long painful fight, before the fabric finally gives way, and Draco reaches through the stuffing, pulling out the first metal spring his hands found.
He cries harder, falling in love with the hand running up and down his back softly. It feels so real, and Draco doesn’t know what to make it. Waves are crashing over him, but Potter keeps him afloat. Pulling him back from under the water to the surface, refusing to let him to back under, even if it kills him.
Taking a couple steps forward, he smashed his bat onto one of the unfortunates, that was making its way to Blaise. It snarled, and reached out for his ankles from the ground. He stepped back, bashing at the head. It feeling never got old. The adrenaline rushing through his veins. Pulsing with every hit. With every sickening crunch of the bones. Guts spilling, and blood spilling out like a horror movie murder scene.
“D-Draco please...” Weasley croaks out, voice breaking. He looks terrified, but Draco could hardly care. It wasn’t as though it was their fault. It was his fault. Always his.
caught his father’s attention. His head tilting to the side, but wand refusing to move from Grangers crippled self.
is a she!”
Five years ago, Draco would have foolishly attacked at this man with no reconsideration or second thought, but that was five years ago and now was not back then. Draco was maybe half a meter away from the raven, and right before his bat made contact with those fists, he switched directions, sliding past the other’s feet, and making a charge for the window.
Potter let out a sigh, and looked off to the side. “Yeah...it allows be to see where anyone within the boundaries of this school...”
His captor grinned widely, and Draco swallowed the small lump of anxiety that had found its way up from the queasiness in his stomach. “What do I have to agree to?”
The realization dawned upon Draco like cold water. They needed him alive. If this Horcrux important enough to have them send out a search party for him. Important enough to not kill him on first sight...they needed him, because to them, only Draco knew where the Horcrux was. Ironically, he didn’t remember, but it wasn’t as they had to know.
The raven looked hesitant, hands twitching slightly as he contemplated on the others words. “Anything?” he replied after a while, and Draco nodded frantically. Gods...he was desperate. “What about...quidditch?”
"Wats up?"
“Right! Because who could ever blame everyone’s loving
As soon as Draco heard the door click shut, and the footsteps fade out into the distance, he turned. He pulled his knees closer to his chest, and let out a chocked sob, and the first tear broke through, the rest following along in an unbroken stream. He could feel his heartbeat speeding up, pounding in his ears, threatening to burst right out of his chest. He felt so small, yet so big. Lungs burned as they reached their maximum capacity, and forced themselves to stay there-and the tension hurt. The gagging feeling fills his thought, and Draco just sobs louder, wrapping his arms tighter around his fragile self, whispering and telling himself to stop shaking, only to find him shaking even more.
"No, Potter. I'm afraid it's
Sorry to everyone for taking so long and thank you sing so patient, I appreciate it a lot! I plan to update more frequently, so I won't be disappearing for a year again.
Fuck. There was no window in this room. They knew. They’d known all along that they were being followed. It all made sense now. No one was up on watch-duty. He hadn’t seen anyone. The food had been left unguarded in a room
Draco wouldn’t say he hid...more like run. He’d run. Farther away than any of them, so far they wouldn’t be able to catch up with him. He was running from the top to the bottom, and it was so fucking lonely. So empty.
She was to make chicken lasagna today. For the kids. And it must not turn out wrong. Must be
"Ron!!!!! I know you heard me!"
Blaise huffed. "Oh come off it, Pansy. Who was it? Goyle? Crabbe?"
"You have to take them, Draco!"
Blaise didn’t seem to hear. He seemed almost lost, as though he could not hear what Draco was saying. “BLAISE!”
“You called him...Harry..” Blaise said, face contorted with fake shock.
Warnings: Some descriptions of gore (not much)
Draco looked confused. Was Blaise also going to end up like pansy? "The roof ofcourse...blaise. Why would you ask me that?"
Harry sighed and sat back down on the chair letting the scene unviel before him.
When Draco woke up, he was no longer laying sprawled across the cold floor of the great hall. No, instead he found himself with his head embedded into silk white pillows and tangled between red sheets. Groaning, he threw his head to the other side, closing his eyes again, and curling deeper into the blankets. Draco shut his eyes even tighter and waited.
make a run for it. Avoid getting into detention altogether. Oh who was she kidding? Backing out on Harry like that? No...she couldn't.
stutter!
Don’t fucking step closer. I’ll do it. Did you not hear what fucking said?! B-
On the side, Potter must've stopped his rambling, because he couldn't hear the muffled voices anymore. His vision shook, and an unimpressed face came before him asking him what he was on about now. His body felt numb, knowing that Potter must've thought of this as another act of him. The tingling sensation took over, half putting his body at ease, while his brain screamed. Begging to let him out. His eyes searched around the room the room, desperate to look at something other than the raven's disappointing face. He'd done something wrong again. Messed up this fairytale even more, making everything worse. He felt judged. Felt like a failure...at everything. Like he couldn't do a damn thing right.
bad! Why didn't you tell me? I could've helped!"
And he has never felt more caged. Can’t imagine how the facility could have ever felt so safe and secure. The walls are a dull gray with a strange yellow hue to them, slightly different from the bluish steel in the facility. This was worn out with time, covered with the grime and struggle of those who stay here, and those who have passed.
This is a short chapter, because I wanted to save the rest for the next chapter, which is going to get the lot to move on. I just wanted to add in some happy, sappy cute stuff, and build their relationship up a little, and not just rush in to them being together. You know...gotta build it up.
for Blaise.
I know this chapter is late, but I'm moving and that's taking up a lot of my time, and I haven't been able to write as much. I hope this chapter makes up for it, and I also hope it gives some insight into Draco's past.
Potter was just like the others.
Draco, now with his bare feet pressed flatly on the ground, turned around to walk away, but felt himself being pulled back and landing on the bed.
Something broke within the other boy, and Draco knew he'd gone too far. He knew it was coming. The air had gotten unbearably thicker, making Draco's breathing short and hard. And yet the smiled remained, plastered onto his face.
Draco tries to escape, but in no avail.
" A sneer covered his face and he turned around to insult the boy, but the words never came.
Chapter two!! It's not as long as the first chapter, but I hope you guys like it!
Harry gritted his teeth, and continued ignoring Draco’s little interruption. “Second, we don’t have time to go through the whole
'No, don't think that way. No bad thoughts Molly! None!'
Looking back on it now, he wishes he would have held out a bit longer. These experiments he’d let out, they survived. Survived two years. The creationshis brother had been so keen on making his personal army ended up
Red dribbled out from his swollen lips, pooling up on the floor. Draco let out a small groan, pulling himself back up from the hunched position on the floor. “D-does it really matter?”
Draco squinted when the blinded his eyes as he walked out of the dark and into the light. He shut his eyes again and turned snuggling deeper into what seemed like a pillow. It was an attempt to go back to sleep, but when had sleep ever been easy for him?
"Who are you calling a brat?! And just what the hell are you thinking by calling Pomfrey!? You better let go of me this instant Potter or I'll-!"
Draco looked over to Blaise, who remained quiet. They both understood the unsaid question. This group had told them things about them...now it was their turn to pay back. To tell the three something about them. “What?”
Her eye twitched. What was it with teenagers and trying to do things they can't do when they are injured. First Ron, then Fred, and NOT to mention Harry!
----------------------------
Draco’s heart dropped the tiniest bit. Blaise was right. He’d always been right. They couldn’t
"You might as well just drink the syrup for breakfast." Draco said. Pansy only grinned in response. She frowned when she looked down at the empty plate before him.
A hug?
The raven rolls his eyes, closing the door behind him. “Oh quit being dramatic. We can’t get rid of
Potter?," Draco drawled.
Mrs Weasley almost chuckled. Malfoy acted more like a child now and less like a stuck - up, spoiled prat.
Suddenly it
I-I didn't know...
that I would ever do something so...so
“You little shit,” Draco muttered, eyeing the raven who was doubled over laughing at his pitiful state. He straightened up, cracking his neck to the side, and crunching his hands together as if to feign stretch.
"...I
However, Harry's realization came in a little to late. Malfoy's eyes shut close, the hand inside his cloak closed together into a fist, and his lips moved as a soft quivering voice breathed out.

This was...the

His henchmen scrambled forward, putting a clean bullet through the unfortunate still gnawing its way through the girl’s stomach. In all, it’s disgusting. The girl lay, her parts scrambled across the cold floor, brains splattered across the pillar behind her, with a gaping hole going going through her skull, all the way from underneath her jaw to the tip of her head.
"Geez..children these day." Molly muttered, before stepping out into the cold. Ms Weasley even cursed the moment her bare feet hit the snow. She walked about 10 steps and picked Malfoy up, dragging his limp, cold body into the warmth.
Draco whipped his head around to look at Potter. Potter stood tall, a smirk painting his face and leaning on  the table next to the bed.
And the more and more he gazed at the two before him the more Blaise’s words seemed true. He should never have doubted his friend’s words. This world was cruel. There was no more ‘nice’ people anymore. He knew that, then why did he still doubt it so much?
"Why don't we start easy? Who is that girl?"
....And that was how he met Liddi. He took the coffee from Liddi and almost smiled at her. Almost. There were no need for any exchange of thank you's. Liddi knew he appreciated it.
He motioned to the pages stuck stuck to the walls, to the pictures of the two girls kissing. Holding hands. Touching.
worried about Malfoy. Not at all! Madame Pomfrey had forced him to stay here until Malfoy woke up. Her reasoning,
“Maybe if a

“You’ve already tried this before and might I remind you, it didn’t go so well for you last time.”
“Did you actually drink a potion with Goyle’s essence?”
and turning to look at the clock on the wall, and that's when he remembers he's fucking blind. "Ok ok..wait...ok...it's good now," he says putting his glasses on. "Ok...it's like..2..in the morning. For fuck's sake Malfoy, it's fucking two in the morning, go back to sleep."
Draco was really in shock. He'd almost died. Almost suffocated to death and that too, by none other than the mighty chosen one. And it was miracle that he'd even managed to break the hold of the magic.
Except..this time, it wasn’t him that caused the pain. It was a stinging hex. Draco gasps, feeling the knife fall out from his burning hand, and he looks up to see Potter standing before him, wand raised out in front of him.
” he asked, almost confused to why his father would contact him...through the slytherin fireplace of all places. The snarl that followed made him straighten up, brush a hand through his pants trying to get rid of any wrinkles that may be visible. Giving a slight cough, he took one deep breath, before turning to get a better look at his father’s face. “Father.”
!!! AGHHHH!” Draco begged, sobbing and convulsing violently.
"Errrr...you ok there, Malfoy."
"Will u give it a rest Malfoy!!," She spoke, this time with a louder and more demanding voice.
Draco Malfoy woke up with a gasp. The gasp soon turned into coughing, and then choking.
Draco took a step back and looked at Potter, with alarm.
Malfoy froze and both him and Harry turned to look at the source of the noise.
"Just get to the point harry. Don't act like you're on a manly period."
Harry reached out to Malfoy as he saw the body fall, and land with a thud on the ground. He cringed when he heard the sickening crack of skull to stone. Harry did this. He was about to....
“I-I have this...map.”
His eyes shifted long his tracks surrounding the house in a circle. There were almost gone now, his holes being filled up with the snow, and a part of him wondered if he disappeared, if anyone would care at all. If anyone would notice.
Tears pricked his eyes and he yelped. Lilly skidded out of his arms and lay limp in the snow.
Warmth.
"And how do you suppose I believe you?"
She let out a small chuckle, sounding more like gasps for air, and coughs. Huh, it seemed even when she was going to die and unlike the movies, there would be no last look to the sky. No last bask of sunlight, or a tree...or chocolate or grass or the smiles of her friends or kisses or the last piece of gum she’d saved for later or late-night walks or the night or the moon or stars or....or
Potter gave him an amused look. "And you're
Draco sputtered on his glass of Pumpkin juice. He felt his face heat up, and he scowled at the former raven. “
I'm low-key sleep deprived so i finished this chapter and really didn't have the strength to proof read it, so there might be grammar mistakes, but if you guys notice something that is off or doesn't make sense, feel free to tell me! Criticism and advice for plot is greatly appreciated!
After Potter had left, he proceeded to walk around the barrier, pressing his palms against the invisible wall, and watching as his touch sent ripples through the surface. It was as though he were looking through a thin wall of water.
He tried to kill someone, again!!! And this time he'd almost gone through with it. Not that he didn't
She shook her head.

“You scared?”
Molly had every right to be suspicious. The kids would definetely not come back this fast. It's too early. WAY too early. As she approached the door cautiously, the person on the other side became more impatient. The ringing of the doorbell became more urgent. More desperate.
Tears well up in his eyes, the dam breaking open and streaming down his cheeks and he sobs. Breaking down as all the memories he shared with his friends and family flashed through his mind. He thinks about the last time he saw Pansy smile, thinks about the last piece of gum lying untouched in the back of his pocket, and Draco laughing back at the facility...could feel his parents arms around him. And he’s so selfish, it’s almost disgusting.
With silence, comes fear. And with the fear, comes peace.
"Awwwww...you can feel me talking!!!" Draco groaned and looked at Blaise pleadingly. He sighed and patted Draco on the back.
Oh, father didn’t know what was coming after him.
Blaise and Draco chuckled. "It's ok Pansy...maybe another day."
Not quite a city...or a town. Not normal enough to be a gang, but not religious enough to be a cult. Nothing about them could be associated with the normal human slang for groups, so they stuck with pockets. Pockets...were dangerous.
Draco blinked, his mind reeling back to Potter, standing there with his bloody disgusting emerald eyes, and stupid unruly hair.
Draco snarled as they pushed him up against the bark of a tree. He glared at the masked figure as it raised its wand up to him, mummering a quick spell.
Harry watched now with a staggered grin as Malfoy scratched at his neck with one hand, while the other curled slowly inside his robes.
“Don’t
Don’t tell me you
me!! You locked the damned door!!!!" Draco yelled, twisting and pulling on the knob frantically in an attempt to escape.
The raven ran a hand through his hair, and gave Draco a disappointed look. “Fine, you give me your broom, potions, and wand, and I’ll let you go on a walk...
Draco blinked dumbfounded watching the raven rambling on about shit he couldn’t possible give a damn about at the moment. “How the fuck did yo–”
? What did Madame Pomfrey? Panic slowly crept across Harry's mind, and he unconsciously brought his hand up biting the dead skin and peeling it off slowly.
"Well, from what I see. It seems like you are ready to abandon your sister wherever, as long as you get rid of her."
"Hey mate, why are you all red? Oooh, were you looking at Cho Chang again?" Ron asked, before giving the sly smirk of his and looking eerily towards the table where Cho sat.
Knowing that even if they did not survive, they had a week or two of freedom. Surely, they had deserved that. It was the only thing he could give them after all he’s done wrong. It was his way of repenting.
Signing, he crept through the room, salvaging anything that could be of any use. He found a few clean t-shirts in the closet, along with a few pairs of pants. Too big for either of them, but good to keep them warm during the night. The blankets had been taken away from the bed. The group staying here must’ve taken them. He was ready to leave the room, when he caught the glimpse of a picture frame that lay shattered on the ground.
"Aww, don't look so scared, Malfoy. I'm not going to hurt you."
Draco almost let out a chuckle, but the sharp pointed end of a want found his jaw first. He let out a crackled cry of pain, as it left a sharp cut on his jaw, the skin around it throbbing, and no doubt already bruising. “
His ears ringed as his head came into contact with the ground. Vision now white, and body numb, he choked out a sob. It wasn't a large fall, but with his current condition it hurt like hell.
Draco yelped and jumped away from the voice. He broke out of his trance and looked at the source of the noise only to come face to face with Potter. His cheeks heated up, turning into a light shade of pink. Draco had just yelped.
He knew Potter and Granger were light sleepers. Weasley slept like a rock, but all of them slept with their blinds open. You’d think they’d cover their windows in fear of being seen by outwardly dangers, but they were bloody gryffindors. All mighty, and looking out for danger rather than hiding from them.
. They wanted his secrets.
, on his knees and begging. Ha!
Malfoy glared, and with a final force he pushed at Harry again, managing to throw off the grip. Harry staggered and Malfoy would have gotten away.
Draco bolted. Sprinting past the hall, and back to the room where he first came from. He was close, so close to leaping out from the bedroom window, but something slammed into him, knocking him over. Draco kicked at the body, and swinging his bat wildly at the man. Black hair, and green eyes. Breathtaking and
Crouching, Draco picked it up, wiping the dust from the cracked glass, and taking a good look at the photo. It was of a little girl. No older than eight. She was smiling brightly, a smile he hadn’t seen in years. Her tiny, pudgy arms were wrapped around whom Draco assumed was her little brother. The boy had a scowl on his face, facing away from the camera.
Draco should be scared. He really should. His almost murderer to be was only a couple feet away from him and all he could do was watch with half-lidded eyes as he drifted between the boundaries sleep and awake. Maybe it was the potion. It was keeping him calm and relaxed but deep inside he knew it wasn't. It was different. Something was off. The atmosphere, the air, it all changed whenever Potter was around. It almost put him at
“I’m sorry,” Draco croaked is a hushed whisper. So quiet, that even he himself could hear it. He pressed his head back against the bark of the tree, and peered up at the setting sky before him. Pretty, like always. He wondered how someone as ugly as him could exist in such a beautiful world. It was a funny thing. It really was.
“..But, sir–” one of the boys stammered.
How..How did she know?' Harry thought.
Harry gulped, realizing that the blonde truly had no idea of what a lawn mower was. His cheeks began to heat up slightly, eyeing the angry blonde, fidgeting and grumbling under his breath.
When she was younger, she loved the idea of heroes. Of happy endings. The ones in the movies where the hero kisses the girl, and they live happily ever after. They never did show what happened after that, but it was nice to believe that nothing came after that. That that was it. Where it ended. Where everyone iss happy, and loving. And there is no evil queen to ruin it all.
..Made it."
“I–I can’t..I nee–” Draco let himself stop there. He knew where this was going. There was only one way to get out from the barrier around the house, and that was through flying. The barrier was broken from the top as though it were a room but without a ceiling.
And he continues writing...until the ink fades away from the marker, her name whispering away with the black.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Shut it, Potter! I-I have a..essay due tomorrow..and since I was busy being kidnapped, I couldn't do it! I don't know about you, but I don't plan on failing."
She handed him the vile and Draco cringed with the smell. He looked up hoping that Madame Pomfrey might take a little bit of pit on him, but she stood unshaken. Sighing, he closed his eyes, held his breath and downed the liquid in one gulp. It'd been a big mistake. Draco sputtered and gagged with the taste.
"Why is the door still locked?"
Blaise is sure his heart will rip out from his rib cage, and he wonders if his captors...the one called Hermione...could hear the fear oozing out from his skin. Wonders if they could see his caged soul trashing and begging to be released. Looking for a moment’s worth of peace.
Why else would someone like
A frustrated groan filled the air. “I-
Draco rolled his eyes. “Don’t bother trying to lie, Potter. In you haven’t noticed...

“Guess, we’ll just have to find out won’t we?”
“Map?”
"You'll what?" Harry speaks, venom dripping from his tongue. "You'll tell your daddy? Oh wait..poor
He let his head drop, and stilled. It was a form of respect. A farewell. Draco didn’t know whether she was dead yet or not. Maybe she was still alive, hidden in a far away place that the unfortunates couldn’t reach. Maybe she’s dead. Or maybe she’d waiting...for them. For someone to save her, as her screams would be drowned in the hide of the unfortunates. Barely clinging on to life, as they would rip their teeth through her flesh, and she would scream. Scream and scream, begging for Draco and Blaise. Promising to be better, to never go out late again, to never lie to her parents. To be good, and listen.
if you don’t give some insight on what happened!”
He pressed down on it, pushing another peice into his mouth. The favour the same, but this time Draco wanted to spit out. It was disgusting and
His captor didn’t reply, instead turning around and giving a sharp tug to the rope to get him walking again. All the while, Draco glared at his back, silently hoping it would pierce a hole straight through his back.
Malfoy had already slept, and he himself had made sure of that. Even if he’d supposedly
All mighty looking, cold sweat slipping down his neck, and his eyes.
"Isn't that a....good thing?"
Draco rolled his eyes and reached for the apple and took a bite out of it, chewing slowly, feeling sick as the food slipped down throat.
The sound of weeping cut her off. She looks down and Malfoy now has his head cradled in the bundle that he held. His body shook with violent tremors and sobs. Choking. Not crying, but trying to. As if all that he could produce were dry tears. The boy held the bundle tighter and kissed it?
“I know you better than you think, Malfoy.”
!!" He yelled, trying to defend himself, but the other three ignored him, not even giving him the slightest of glance.
with you people.” It wasn’t much of a comeback, but in Draco’s defense, he hadn’t slept for 74 hours. Fuck him if he wasn’t exactly on par with his sassiness.
Molly had gotten her ingredients and everything out. The over heating at 345 degrees and the cake batter ready and prepared. Her mind was only on the cooking. She pulled out the cutting board ready to cut the chicken into pieces and hummed the tune to an old ballroom dance song. The one to which she had first danced with Arthur. Oh, those days were a delight.

What had Draco gotten himself into?
"You..you damned git. You...
I'll also maybe not write smut, since I've never written it before, and I don't want one character to have to top or bottom because of personality or physique. I used to have this idea of one being more feminine, but that sort of felt wrong after a while, seeing that they are both characters with their own personal characteristic, and it doesn't make sense to make someone the "male" or the "female" of the relationship. I don't know if what I'm saying makes sense, but yeah. It's just me realizing feminizing a character is wrong, and I will might not write any smut because I have no experience in writing it, maybe I'll imply that they did do it, but not write too much of a detailed scene?
Harry snorted and looked down at the sleeping figure with a frown.
“Missing?” Draco asked dumbfoundedly.
Closing his eyes, he breathed. And cried. It felt safe, and so good.
“Pockets...tell me about them,” the raven asked instead, rather than going onto accusing him.
His parents are leaving, and he’s still eating. The painted screeching and silent whimpering playing like music. A melody only he seemed to be able to hear. One made just for him.
When the time came he’d have to betray him...and Harry had fucking trusted him.
After Astoria’s suicide, they’d promised another such incident wouldn’t occur. Not again. Astoria had always been afraid of such a thing. She’d been brought up in a strictly catholic family, much like Draco. Anyone that committed suicide would go to hell. That’s what the two of them had grown being taught. Astoria was terrified of the thought of going to hell, but now that he thinks of it...maybe hell was better than what they were living in now.

” Draco sneered slightly, feeling blood begin to rush up to fill his face. “W-what do I sound like?!”
Draco just can't take it anymore.
The brunette let out a small growl slamming her hand on the back of the chair next to Draco’s head. Draco flinched, jumping slightly. “Listen here Sylas, I don’t want any lies out of you. Which group do you belong to?”
fight Voldemort a multiple times and returned back alive each time, which as a matter of fact, is a great accomplishment, considering the fact that he's only 16. Moreover, he was pretty damn good looking, despite his hair being a birds nest.
You’re insufferable!”
His current situation was not by any means comfortable. He doubted Blaise’s was either. Roped were tied around his wrists. The ones on his ankles giving him little walking room. His captor held the rope attached to his wristed, often giving a small tug if Draco slowed down, or said something out of line.

But nothing good ever lasted.
Draco gave a sharp glare, a grin still dancing on his lips. “As a matter of fact, Carrot top.

“I don’t want to,” Draco groans, pushing away the vile that the raven was shoving towards his face. “I’ve had enough sleep...trust!”

“You know what Malfoy? You’re right,” came a calm voice, and Draco’s heart fluttered with the tiniest bit of hope. “It’s not nine yet. It’s fucking
..," the voice croaked out. Malfoy's lips quivered, mouthing something Harry didn't hear, before closing his eyes again. Malfoy's body sagged a little, and the grip on his arm loosened but didn't let go.
The raven growled behind him, and Draco froze shutting his eyes and letting go of his struggle, but keeping his hold on the knife held tight. He wouldn’t let go of it.
A couple games later, the victor had been decided as Lily. She’d popped the most matching crackers and eaten almost half of them. Draco let out a small laugh, watching her as she gloated, rubbing her victory into Weasley’s brooding face.
“That is not a question you are supposed to answer with another question,”
"Oh, Draco, but you
He could hear Potter grit his teeth from behind him. "Fine," the raven muttered in a small growl. "I'll answer your questions, but the same applies for you."

"Of course he wouldn't Lilly. Of course he wouldn't. You brother looks good in everything."
"What?!"
Draco glared, turning his head away from the raven. A part of him wondered why Potter even cared.

"Uhhh..harry?"
Holding back a small chuckle, he spoke to the door, speaking a some phrase in Parseltongue., smiling when Malfoy shivered. The door opened and Draco bolted out, half running, half walking, and almost stumbling in the process.
"Keep dreaming, princess."
“M-me and B–Layne.”
He remembers being a failure.
His path ahead doesn’t feel like a lot longer. Today...maybe tomorrow, it will be an unlucky raid, and an unfortunate will let its jaw open and clamp shut around his heart. Chewing and gnawing, it’d tear him apart. And Draco has no doubt it will be painful. Maybe it's karma. He deserved it for letting Pansy die so easily. For not trying harder. Maybe...maybe if he hadn’t done what he did five years ago...this all would’ve stopped by now.

"Sorry, perhaps you didn't catch that. Let me dumb it down for you a little.

"Draco..."
Perhaps it was easier for them. To overlook their own evil, with the evil of others, and a part of Draco wanted to laugh. He wanted to laugh, make everything a little bit more maddening. Wanted to rip his hair out, tear at his skin, just to make them understand. To make them feel what he was. Anxiety. Fear. Agony. Pure terror and helplessness. But they'd never understand. Draco had understood that a long time ago. All those sleepless nights were wasted with his thoughts. And even after all that time, Draco had found nothing. No way out. No way in. He was stuck in the middle. Not good enough to be a part of the light side and Not evil enough to snuff the life out of hundreds of innocent souls.
The sound of the door bell startled her. She almost dropped her knife.
Draco swallowed. Five years sounded a lot, and without joining a pocket its near to impossible. “You tell me. You survived didn’t you?”
And as the bodies piled upon one another, he had found it harder to convince himself that it was for the best. That what they were doing was right, and after Jake’s death, he couldn’t take it anymore. He’d let them free.

conversation! Quit snooping in!”
"Of course," He mumbled. "Of course you would have some sort of condition."
Draco crept in from the window, careful not to knock anything over or make any noise. He wanted to go see these people. Wanted to talk to them. Make a bigger group, but that was always a risk. A risk that neither of them were willing to take.
Strike One for Draco.
"No no no...l-lily"
He could already imagine his father's horror. He let out a small chuckle at the thought and Pansy gave him a look. “Can you imagine what father would think?”
Harry put a hand up his mouth, feeling the need to throw up. “
“You don't have to worry about that though. You won’t escape, and I’m not worried about keeping you locked. You’d have no use if you were simply kept locked away.” The boy claims, and for the first time Draco realizes the other isn’t looking at him. He's either looking at the ground or somewhere off to the distance. Never truly meeting Draco’s eyes, and Draco doesn’t know why but it pisses him off. “Besides, not many people can navigate their way down here.”
He wants to say, but bites his tongue. He looked at the ground glaring. “They know the way out of here.”
But now Harry had grown. Become more muscular. He's stronger now. The fraud, skinny, tiny boy no longer existed. The one that stood here was strong, and brave.

he gritts, slowly getting up.
mess up on.
The boy infront of him froze. His skin turned a deadly pale, as the blood rushed away from his face. The moment of shock didn't last lont as a wild look overcomed Potter. His eyes became feral, and the boy snarled, baring his teeth ready to attack and strike.
Draco shot up when he heard the voice. He knew it all to well, and yet it seemed somewhat different. The sheets slipped slights off his shoulders and Draco let out an involuntary shiver.
“Only in one condition.”
For now, he stands, feeling the pain tingle through his broken body, and he the smallest bit alive. The pain a reminder that he is still breathing and feeling.
He took in a deel breath, trying to shake the tiredness out of him, and then started again. "Well then, Potter. I'll just remove myself from your presence. You keep doing what you were doing." He stood, making his way to the door with his bare feet. Right now, there was no use asking question like 'how he got here?' Or rather '
kill Malfoy....so why was he feeling guilty. This was Malfoy. Harry, this is Draco Malfoy. He deserves this. There was no need for him to feel bad or say sorry. This was his long rival right here. His enemy and Harry should be glad. Glad. Like he'd first felt when he was first ordered his magic to hurt Draco.
He wanted to give up...just not care for a moment. Perhaps even get a nice dream...or maybe sleep forever. He didn’t know. But as the darkness crept up upon him, Draco found himself not caring.

"W-what do you need, P-potter?" Damnit. He needed to get a hold of himself. He was stuttering and Malfoys'
The door flings open, and Harry shoves Draco inside. He stumbles, trying to regain his footing. He looks up, feeling suffocated around these gray walls.
Draco gulped. “Dead...they don’t exist anymore. Everyone’s dead. They were all overtaken by the unfortunates. T-those who survived are now scavengers or in pairs. Pockets are g-gone.”

"Yes. About the girl

Potter loosening his hold, and that's when Draco burst into action. He pushed the raven, and sprang out from under Potter. He pushed up from the bed, and had only managed a step from the bed, before a hand grabbed his wrist. He yelped as the hand spun him around, and brought him back into Potter's chest.
“No no no no no NO
“I’d rather not,” he stated, getting straight to the point. The silence that followed after was much like the dark stare that Potter had given him earlier, and it was deafening. The air around him wavered again, and what felt like a bucket of cold water was dumped upon his head. He gasped at the cold leaching through his clothes, wetting the fabric. Anger bubbled up his chest and he turned around to hex whoever it was that had dumped ice cold water on him to next week.
Pansy quirked her eyes up in realization, but it was short lived. The small gap of shock turned to a sinister smile creeping across her face, stretching from ear to ear. Draco deadpanned, as Pansy closed her eyes for a moment, letting out a scoff. “What your father doesn't know, can’t hurt right?”
okay!
Harry pauses, freezing up, and turning to Draco with a sharp snap of the neck. “They?” he asks suspiciously, and Draco wants to be laugh at his pitiful state.
And that is all to think. Nothing more. He feels tired, and even running down to the next turn seems like a chore. He pauses, his steps faltering, and takes a moment to look at the walls around him.
it. Remembers seeing that haunting look everyday through the monitors. He’d helped it so long ago he could hardly recognise it.
Draco looked up at the ceiling, feeling just about as empty as it looked. “I think we both knew that it was an obvious lie.”
“But you admitted we are friends!”
Fear pulsed through his veins as an unfortunate shrieked at his awakening and reached out to him. The unfortunate stopped a little more than a meter away, chained to another pole in this dungeon-like room.
“That?” Hermione asked raising an eyebrow, and Harry gave a small nod.
The feeling of relief when he say that it was her...and not Draco. It was okay to bring worth to one’s life more than another’s...right?
Potter’s smile fell from his lips, a frown replacing it. “Sure.”
tell me to move?!"
His voice full of a thousand expressions and the emerald eyes shining with emotions Draco had thought were long lost through the years. But his words were chilling. Like that of a child that had been kept away from the outside world and was just learning. Calculating.
'DING ...DINGDING...
But Draco was not his father. Not at all. Draco was Draco. Draco Malfoy. And Draco Malfoy would do no such thing.
.what I
Draco waited for Potter to say more, but only silence greeted him. He could feel Potter's gaze boring into him, cold and calculated. Unlike how he had been before. Potter truly wasn't going to repeat himself twice, but Draco wasn't about to go down without a fight.
So yes, he is grateful. Grateful he still has Blaise.
"Right...ofcourse I did, Weas-," he cut himself off. He was about to call her a Weasel, but it would ofcourse be wiser if he didn't. Draco needed to keep to his best behaviour, he needed them to keep Lilly.
didn’t know...at least not anymore. Funny how well an ‘Oblivious’ charm could work when casting towards the mirror. It was a handy spell. One that could erase an entire life with the power of one small hushed word. Permanent when for someone else, but only temporarily when cast towards yourself. Draco had learned that the hard way. After all, he had been the only wizard in history to try..or better yet be
He wants to say goodbye, but knows it’s better if he doesn’t. It’s easier to think that he is only doing this so Draco wouldn’t have to suffer more.
"He's not a prince, and I need him for reasons that do not concern you. Now,
"Here, you'll feel better when you aren't hungry."
He wanted to leave, and
"Quit frowning will you? You'll get wrinkles," he muttered glaring at her a little. Pansy smiled and nodded before leaving Draco to drift back into his own world of thoughts.
"H-hey, Hermi-" Ron tried to say, before a hand came down and smacked him right on top of the head.
Malfoy mentally groaned. There was no changing Harry's mind. So be it.
Muhahahaha! Another cliff hanger.
Draco snorted. “Guess not.”
Draco hugged and kissed his sister goodnight. Her eyes were brighter now, and her speech a little better. He walked out the door with a smile, but it fell as he reached is own room.
“How could you?” Draco hissed, betrayal flushing through his blood. Rage mangled in with unbearable terror filling his lungs. “
"Run away from me! You always run away.
“I’m sorry,” the raven spoke, voice hoarse and rough. “I-I almost...
Of course Potter wouldn’t forget that, and that made Draco bite the inside of his cheek harder in frustration. Without another word, he unbuckled the satchel hidden underneath the safety of his cloak, handing it to the raven, who took it without hesitation. Oh if Poter knew the wand was useless, binded with magic, he had yet to understand.
“I-I don’t know! He just started shaking....and said he was

Draco turned around to the source of the voice and saw a frustrated looking and very much angry Harry Potter coming his way.
"I-I don't know! All I know is that it

Malfoy glared. "Alright, we have a deal."

“Don’t wanna get out of here do you? Into bondage maybe?” Harry mocks, before letting out a small chuckle at his own joke. “C’mon, follow me. Unless of course, you’d rather stay here. Wouldn’t mind seeing you tied up all day.”
That’s all they’ve ever wanted. Was that too much to ask?
“Walk faster,” came a growl from the raven, and another tug on the rope. Draco stumbled forward, close to giving up then, but he forced himself to stay upright. Glaring at the back of his captor’s head, he snarled.
Hehe~ I left it on a cliffhanger. It's not a very big one though. (@-@)
He thought.
It’s like every other night, only this time he’s alone. No Blaise waiting by his side, no Pansy tickling his feet...no
This coffee was what helped him survive the day. The smell plunged his nose, and he sighed with content. He took his first sip, and felt pure bliss. The bitterness was perfect along with the tint of sweetness, and it had this strange aftertaste. The crispness of it made his feel better. More whole. Pure bliss.

He lets out a chuckle, and lets his body drop onto the forest floor, chest rumbling with laughter. His vision blurs as tears began to pour from his eyes, wetting his cheeks, and watering the grass below.
He clenches his eyes, waiting for the brunet to step closer, waiting for the perfect moment to attack. Just one step closer an–

on the other hand," She pauses. "You on the other hand...yo-"
Harry woke up falling off the bed. Dazed, he landed on the floor and groaned a little with the slight throb in his stomach. His attention turned to a shriek coming from atop of the bed.
The lump on the bed shot up, tumbling off the bed and onto the floor. Potter groaned, and looked up scratching his head just a little. Draco took in his form. Hair disheveled, glasses tilted, and eyes groggy. Now this was the Potter he knew.
“You survived 5 years trapped in this city.
His palms started to sweat, and he rubbed his fingers together feeling the dampness. He placed his fingers together mending them. Glued,  stuck, and then he'd pull at them. Ripping them apart and then repeating the process. Like there were two people inside of him, both yelling at him, blaming him for all that was happening. A part of him telling him to confess everything, to give it a try. To try to get the help he needs and desperately wants. That it was his own fault that this was happening, and he best to something about it. The other, telling him doesn't matter. Telling him that nothing he does would change a nothing. No one to believe him, and none to stoop low enough to help a person with the likes of him. Again his own fault. His own actions and behaviour that bought and place him here.
"Why do you
"Really Potter, I always knew you were a little cracked here and there, didn't expect you to be completely broken." Draco grins and looks up at the storming cloud before him. "Such a shame though. It looks like the all so mighty saviour might not be strong enough to protect us all. Let alone himself." Draco paused for a moment, letting himself think of the right words. "How...
Draco snarled, and dropped taking a swipe at the raven’s feet, in hopes of knocking the other out of balance. The boy only responded with a small jump to avoid Draco’s leg, and gave a kick of his own.
“H-How?” Draco finds himself saying, when the raven beside him gave no response. “How did you manage to stay hidden with

"You expect me to trust you?!" Potter let out a cruel chuckle, and it made Draco's intestines twist. He knew what was coming next. He was expecting it, and yet he didn't know why he still let it get to him. "You, a

That year she confined herself inside the curtains of her bed. Nothing that Blaise or him said would bring her out. Her parents had refused to take her back during the summer. And why would they in the first place? To them she was the reason disgrace was bestowed upon the family name.
Please. Get him out of here. Take him away. Wrap him in warmth, and safety that Draco had yet to learn. Just get him out. Draco couldn’t breathe, let alone make sense of the world around him. He was suffocating. Drowning. The waves trashing upon him, taking his under the current, only to pull him back out. If he stayed under, he knew he would eventually find peace, but the waved always pulled him back above. Breaking the surface, and giving him a taste of life, before sending him back under. It was cruel, and he wanted out. Out.

It’s a maze of the worst kind, running up and down and in directions Draco didn't even know were possible. It’d be a feat for any one to find their way around this hell.

And with that Draco pulled the cloaks around Lilly tighter and tied the two ends of the cloaks together so they would keep wrapped around her. This was it. He had no other choice, but the Weasley's. Anywhere else would've been better.
Potter was giving him a hug?
"What the actual
"She's probably trying to talk Ginny into coming here. I'll tell her to give Ginny some space."
A woman appeared out of the darkness from behind the red head, and Blaise. Beautiful. Something he didn’t think existed in this world. Her unruly brown curls were put in a high ponytail, with soft wavy bangs coming to her eyebrows. He could make out a tattered knitted sweater, fit snugly against her body, with a satchel slung around her thin waist. A scarf hanging loosely from her neck.
” he warned...and
To make matters worse it was a Weasley.
At that Malfoy rolled his eyes and scoffed. "My own good, my arse," he muttered underneath his breath.
He wonders if this is what those people he’d helped down in the facility’s basement felt like. Caged and trapped like some wild animal, only Draco was barely wild. More broken and worn out with the never ending wind. And tired.
behaviour towards them. He'd expected a whole presentation on his deeds, on his family name and the evil lurking in his blood. To him, she probably wanted some sort of reassurance that he wouldn't kill them in their sleep, or slip poisoned potions into their food. Oh, how wrong he'd been
She looks over the two, eyes meeting as they stop on a set of steel silver eyes. Silver eyes were rare, but unlike the stories, they did not sparkle, or shine like the diamonds she’d heard so much about. Nor did they run deep within the roots of frozen water. Instead, it was a rather soft green. Faded and worn out from the years of gruelling and pain.
This is when Ron Weasley realizes that Harry was obsessed with Malfoy, wheather he admitted to it or not. Before both him and Hermione had thought that Harry was just being paranoid, and making random assumptions on Malfoy. Now it seemed clear that Harry was obsessed. Not like a stalker obsessed, ok maybe a little bit like stalker but not too much.
The thought alone made Draco’s stomach churn, and twist. “P-please..we need–we need to go,” he stuttered, his words more a crackling whisper. Tears threatened to fall from his burning eyes, but he blinked them away. This was no time to be selfish.
"Shut up!" Potter spoke through gritted teeth, and Draco merely smiled. Draco's fingers reached up to touch Potter's face but never reached. Instead they stopped mockingly when Potter unconciously leaned in to the touch. Draco let out a small chuckle.
“Names Hermione,” she said. “The redhead holding ur friend is Ron, and Mr. Grouchy Pants in front of you is Harry.”
Draco bit the inside of his lip. “Potter.”
"Why...why would we need a celebration??"
It was selfish and for the moment, Draco was more than ok with that.
Draco really needs a better plan, because this dumbass raven wasn’t going to let him do anything but sleep.
He knew it was Malfoy. He'd seen or well rather noticed as Malfoy would sneak out after curfew. The map, it would let him know exactly where someone was with the just words and the touch of a wand.
“Get rid of it,” the man muttered stepping over the dead body, and walking towards the discarded bag on the concrete floor.

. He wished they would just leave and never return. He didn’t want their food or water no more. Blaise and him could find it elsewhere. Tears welled up at the corners of his eyes, but Draco blinked them away refusing to breakdown for this ruthless people.
Out of the corner of his eyes, Madame Pomfrey dragged a chair next to the bed and made Draco lay inside the safety of the covers.
Watching...and not being able to a damn thing.
Malfoy winced at the words and looked down at his lap in what seemed to be shame. Harry almost laughed at the irony. Why was Malfoy ashamed? If anything, Harry should be ashamed, for letting the corners of his lips tug up into a barely noticeable smile. For feeling an overjoyed relief when he figured she didn't know the real answer. For knowing that he won't be caught unless Mafloy decided to open his mouth.
Slowly he made his way to the bed and crawled onto it, keeping a foot off the mattress. "Just so you know, this is kidnapping! This is completely illegal and...I-I'll tell!"
is not your work?"
He takes in a sharp breath, a piercing screech reeling him back to the present. It’s all too familiar. The same screeched he heard every morning come. The same wailing sounds that lulled him to sleep at the brink of night. “Please don’t tell me that was what I think it was.”
” Draco coughed out. “I...I just don’t..know. I don’t know...I..
"Yes,

The raven gave a pleased smile. “Now...why were you stealing from us.”

"No buts Draco, I've already contacted Professor Snape and explained to him your

He took his seat on the ground next to his sister, wincing slightly at the small sting in his stomach. It was a simple game of wizard cracker-pop it. Draco snapped his neck to the side a little, cracking his knuckles, and let out a wide grin.
“Will you stop calling me that?!”
For some reason they seemed louder, and his head throbbed in a dull pain every time Pansy would shreak.
Only in a much more compromising situation. Draco flushed a deep red. Potter had pulled him down on his lap, Draco's back against his chest, and the hold on still very much tight on his wrist. He squirmed a bit, trying to get out of the hold, but Potter held tight, and it wasn't like Draco could bite him this way.

of them. Like why was Draco here? Did Potter bring him here? But why would Potter bring him here? How had he falled asleep? Why did Potter try to kill him? Is he already dead though?? Oh he could go on forever, however, the questions, he decided, could be asked later. If ever.
Potter on the other hand rolled his eyes, and gave them a bored look. "Look, I don't care. I just need to put a few things straight, and do not worry nothing will happen to your precious little prince. I'll return him in one piece.
Ron frowned and nodded. "I swear, when I find who did it, I'll beat em' to a pulp! I'll bring justice to Ginny! I swear I'll make em pay!"
"Don't bloody tell me what to do!! I'll do whatever I want to do!" He snapped, narrowing his eyes and glaring at the raven. Potter on the other hand, only smiled.

Rule number two,
here."
His father huffed, raising his cane slightly, and Draco had to will himself to not flinch. “As I was saying. The Dark Lord has requested your presence.”
“Potter,” Draco croaked, wondering if the raven could possibly understand. Or maybe he already knew. Knew Draco’s dark, ugly secret, but then again...no. There was no real way they would know. Hell even
Harry was, however, glad that Madame Pomfrey didn't ask him how it was that Malfoy came to be in such a pigiment. It seemed as though she already knew.
...impossible...
And there he is. The cold grey eyes staring and judging, looking for something Blaise doesn’t know. He breathes...it’s just one breath in and one breath out, and yet he can’t seem to understand why it is so difficult.
” Blaise snorted, and Draco spared him a weak glare. “Just let us go...we won’t bother your lot again.”
“Shhhh,” came a soothing voice, but Draco could hardly care at this point. It hurt...
Draco was about to spit out a smart remark, but Blaise beat him to it. His voice remaining calm and collected. “And why’s that?”
“Woah woah!” Harry hushed, raising his hands in silent surrender. “Yeah...I mean..Malfoy was
"Well, that wasn't very hero like now was it,
“Lighten up a little, Blondie. It’s just a joke.”

Fuck his
"When will we get to the safe place?"
"I can't though!! I can't wake up using them and they make me feel really groggy afterwards and they taste like absolute filth.
He could hear voices coming from behind him. Yelling out to him. Complaining.
Draco looked around at the bloodbath folding out before him. A body draped in black cloaks lay crumpled before him, blood seeping through the small cracks of their mask. A blade lay tucked in the sole of the body’s show, jutting out, barely an arm lengths away from Draco.
Today was the best fucking day of his life. Fuck his father.
“Awww~” she pinched his cheeks, and he pulled away growling. “Whatever happened to
His father let out a mad cackle, tilting his head back. “You’re too much of coward.”
They were quiet for a moment. Silence filled the whistling air, as they peered to the horizon over the lake. It was nice. Frost was beginning to freeze over the water in crystal. The small gleam of light over the hills gave the waters a orange hue, making it look more like an autumn afternoon rather than winter. Snowfall was late this year, but he still hoped it would snow during Christmas.
Draco tore his gaze away from the gryffindor table, and back to his two friends. “Harry’s been helping me with my...
Draco stood up. His eyes turned dark and the hair fell on his face like wisps.
Anyways, I hope you guys like it and I hope it gives you guys an insite into Draco's mind and why he doesn't want to sleep. Be sure to review and comment!
Going outside without a good pair of shoes was about just as good as trying to commit suicide. One cut to the sole, and that could lead to the deadliest of infections, and in the worst case scenarios turn you into an unfortunate if they come in contact with fresh unfortunate blood or saliva.
Harry groans and runs a hand through his hair. "No."
Harry hated Death Eaters to his very core. He despised the Dark Lord even more, and if Harry knew that Draco was involved, there’s no doubt that he’d hate him as well. And judged by Harry’s strange violent outbursts, Draco feared he might even be killed in that fury.
Harry looked back at the Slytherin table and this time took his time to actually look at the distinct features on the the blonde's face. Malfoy looked rather horrible compared to his usual self. His eyelids drooped, hair unkept bare of it'd usual gel and even though Harry couldn't see the bags underneath his eyes, he could
Draco looked away, mumbling a harsh, “no.”
Draco let his hopeful look turn to a more angry and furious one. “
"Potter."
His control was dancing on a thin line, ready to tip over with one small push, and surprisingly enough, he was almost daring Malfoy to go on.
wouldn’t move.
Yes, Harry knew this was not helping with the assignment that he'd been given, but it seemed impossible to do it at the moment.
“Oh quit being paranoid over everything. They is just my term for people we haven’t met here...or people who are still survivors,” Draco mutters, reeling the conversation off course again. They needed information. Draco needed information. It was only a matter of whom needed it more. “How’d your lot break in.”
His fingers tremble, clinging desperately to the cup of water they had gifted him with, and he didn’t to waste a single drop of the pure nectar. He took another sip, feeling the cool slide down past his crackling throat like honey. It was oddly sweet. He wonders if it’s just his thirst or if they had added something to the water.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dumbledore took his arm of the other and grabbed the bottle of good ol' muggle beer that lay on the shelf.
Everything flashed like wildfire through his eyes. He was hearing but not really listening...feeling but not understanding. Draco felt detached. As though he were watching a movie unfold through his eyes. He wasn’t there...but he was there.
me and few days prior.
Pansy made a face and cringed. "Ewww! gods no! That's disgusting!! That'd be like kissing a frog that got jinxed and was covered with slimy blistered that were oozing with green and yellow puss."
Potter sighed and for the second time this week proceeded to drag Draco out of the great hall. During times like these are when Draco regrets most of the decisions he makes. Like forgetting his wand in his room. Definetly forgetting his wand in his room. That was the biggest mistake out of all.
And with that Potter backed away, and Draco sighed in relief. Although relief didn't last long. Potter's hand squeezed down on his wrist and pulled, making Draco stumble on his feet. He twisted and pulled, but his wrist was held in a wrenching grip. Draco scratched at it, when Potter pulled at it yet again and dragged him along.
“Don’t trust me, Mullet?” Draco asked, catching a glimpse of something above his captor’s right eyebrow. Foundation? No..concealer. What would the raven need concealer for? Maybe a scar or a cut.....
“I asked first!” Hermione complained, placing the feather back down on the table, careful to keep it away from the parchment.
“How big is your hideout?”
“I literally just said we
Hermione.
The raven stopped, turning around slightly, and giving Draco a wide grin that only spoke trouble. “Oh, don’t worry about him. He’ll be joining you here soon enough.”
Draco had been wrong. It wasn’t Potter who was blind and Foolish. It was him. He’d been a fool to think that the one man that he had tormented for years would feel any sort of sympathy for him. That he could possibly even begin to understand him. The more Draco lingered on it, he realized that he, too, didn’t even begin to understand Potter. He had hated Potter for really no reason. He’d bullied his friend every day, called him names, spouted insults that only someone as spiteful as him could say. He was a complete arse, and nothing he could say would change that. Nothing that would justify what he did.
“You called me your friend,” Harry blinks, a small hint of shock mixed in with that same mischievous tendencies he’d seen for the past few years.

"Is - is she ok? She's ok r- right?"
"Oh it's nothing too big," Harry replied, flicking his hair back from his face a little. "I'm sure
” Draco attempted. Potter paused for a moment, looking over to him. “Look..w-we all make mistakes, okay? And it’s not like I haven't been a sore arse to you all these years. I’m not angry.
"Let go of me! POTTER! Unhand me this instant!"
He knew they weren't really going to help Malfoy and neither did they want to. They only wished to get close to Harry. After all, he
to hurry.
Potter boy growled. Actually growled, and seemed to only get closer. Their noses only a few inches apart. Draco only seemed to stare at his eyes. So green
That earned him a knee to the stomach. Draco tried to topple over pain, but the ropes held tight to their promise, rending him immovable. “Shut up! Answer the question, traitor. Where is it? And where have you hidden
The knowledge that he wouldn't fall back asleep didn't matter anymore. As long he could feel this safe, and warm, he doesn't care. For all he knew, he might as well, still be sleeping. Sleeping never really scared him, it was waking up that did, and yet somehow this time was different. And strangely enough, it felt as though the warmth were alive. Breathing, and pumping blood, just like him...wait
The first thing that Draco registers is the noise. And this time it isn’t the deafening silence, but voices and words and music. Laughter echoing across the walls, and Draco gasps. There were...people. Living.
If you see a mistake, tell me! Criticism is appreciated!
Everything about Draco was great except for a few 'tiny' issues.
This could be the last time he’d see it. The last time he would feel the warmth of the sun on his skin, or the bitter rouch of snow. The wind brushing through his hair. The memory of his Lily’s blinding smile. The pair of emerald eyes he’d grown to love all too much. The memory of Molly’s cooking...Mr. Weasley’s old childhood stories, which he was sure were being exaggerated but interesting all the same. Granger scolding the pair. Even Weasley’s fucking hand me down. The ones he was wearing right now. He remembered it all, and he wished he would die remembering them.
Ahh. So here it is! The new update! I tried to write a scene with Draco having a panic attack, and I apologize if that is not how Panic attacks are like. I've never experienced one, so I can never know what they are exactly like. I was simply using accounts of experiences written by other people on the internet, so if you find something that is a little off, or not right, please tell me. I'll try my best to fix it.
So fucking done.
with this." Potter spoke. The words sounding so cruel to Draco's ears. Full of malice.
Harry could now feel the warm blood seeping through his shirt and clinging onto his body. A pang of guilt hit Harry again.
. In all, he didn’t like it. And the look that Poter seemed to give him was very reassuring either.
“Oh C’mon! You know I didn’t mean it like that!” Potter tried.
"Eight."
Draco lay on the floor panting, and gagging when the spell finally broke the hold on his neck. His neck now ached and stung with the scratching. Little bits of blood pooled up and ran down his neck in thick drops. It wasn't a grave wound, but it hurt.
For Molly Weasley, today was going to be a good day. She was going to make lasagna, and cake, and she would think and spend time with her children. Today was definitely going to be a good day.

"Oh please Potter, I'm a man of my words!"

Draco doesn’t want to be alone. The mere thought pushing the breath out of him, sending shivers up his spine. The wall is cold and damp against his back, the air far too humid and dense.
He could hear Potter take in a deep breath, and watched as the raven a hand through his unruly hair in frustration. “Ok Malfoy, I want you to be honest here. I-is...
Another broken body.
"B-But papa said Lill-...Lilliath is a boy. Wouldn't that mean Lilliath is a big boy now?"
this was real. Sooner or later he’d wake up cold with Blaise by his side, all alone. And that would be a real fucking punchline, wouldn’t it?
"I have to make....Malfoy fall in...love with me."
Later, Draco would come to know how wrong he'd been, but for now he was being lulled into the darkness and the last thing Draco saw before he faded away was a smirking Potter, looking as though a predator would to a prey.

is not enough!” His father’s voice raising just a little, before going back to a soft tone. “
Gulping slightly he rang the bell again, this time more urgently.
Maybe, if it wasn't for what had happened to Pansy, he would've been the one to do it, but that wasn't the case. Two years ago, his best friend broke, and glued herself back together colder than ever.
It doesn’t matter, he supposes. He just had to find Draco and the others. They lost someone everyday, and her life would not be in vain and it would not be forgotten.
“They...didn’t like magic much..
"Young master, young master!" Came a high pitched female voice. He turned around and saw Liddy. The house elf he'd grown familiar to. At night, or in the middle of the day, usually the mornings Draco would go to the kitchen, and sit there for a while. He'd sit there waiting for tea. Draco had hoped that the tea would keep him awake, and feel less tired. Ofcourse that wasn't the case. It only made matters worse.
‘Fuck...’ he thinks.
Draco gaped, appalled at the suggestion. “In the

The raven only sobbed louder.
So sorry for this really really late update! I've been busy with other things and it took me a while to write this one. I'll try to update the next chapter soon. Well anyways, how you guys enjoy it! Tell me what you guys think, and feel free to leave any critics. They are highly appreciated. ヽ(*≧ω≦)ﾉ
"We. Are. Not. Friends.
"No. You see, we don't like sharing and besides why should we just hand him over to you? You think us as weak, Potter?"
Ron simply nods his head and sits on the bed.
“Ok...for whom?”
“You shouldn’t be out from your room this late!”
Potter straightened up, and reached out for his wrist, pulling him to the exit of the door. “Hey! Let go of me, Potter!
“Live in a closet?! Don’t kid yourself, Potter!” Draco scoffed disbelieved. “Your the chosen one. You were probably pampered, and spoiled you your entire life. Gods, they must’ve

you?!"
“Why do you think?” Draco lets out a sneer. “You think we want to spend the rest of our lives stuck in this hell hole? Five years has been more than enough, trust me. You broke in through the walls...
Draco thought. It's not as if backing away would stop Potter.
Heyyyy...so it's been a while. New chapter!
Draco sneered. “
Draco places his head in his head and shook. Bloody idiots! Why couldn't they just focus on getting him out and away from Potter's hold? His friends were idiots. They really were. And it was during times like these, he wondered why he'd even become friends with them in the first place. Merlin, give them a brain.
Draco pushed around a piece of lettuce around with his fork, debating on whether he should take the bite. Whether or not he deserved it.
a window. It was too easy.
"Top in potions. Expert in dark magic. Fast learner in spells and magic. And extrodinarilly smart."
He’d never pictured dying with such a pretty sight. He’d always thought he’d be standing at the end of a cursed wand gleaming an electric green. Maybe the fated were being merciful. Feeling pity for his devastated self.
Oh, if only Potter knew, he was
The raven pulled up a stool next to him, sitting down, and leaning a fist on his cheek. Draco slumped his head down in defeat. He’d be honest...for now. If it kept them alive, then so be it.
There are no blankets he notes, shivering, and feeling the cold envelope his body like a second layer of clothing, but he doesn’t ask the other for any. He couldn’t bring himself to let go of his pride. He’s handled the cold before..and this was nothing. Nothing at all.

Harry.
“Sir...what do we put on the marking?”
“And so what? We risk their lives for our own?” Blaise shakes his head, looking at him in disbelief. “They have more of a chance to survive on their own, then with us.”
Potter seemed to be taking up all of them.
Malfoy opened his mouth to speak but paused. His eyes narrowed and he looked at Harry with suspiciously. "Wait...how..how did you know..that
Warnings: Suicide thoughts, Implied/mentioned suicide, violence, some gory descriptions, flashbacks, self-worth, and interrogations.
Draco faked a laugh and scratched his head, only to feel rough cloth rather than soft hair. He had questions.
His voice is softer...almost fragile, and Draco notes his own weakness. Don’t get him wrong. He’s trying. Trying to keep up this facade...and be all hard, unbreakable, stainless steel. “Why do you want to know?” Harry asks, and Draco almost wanted to smack him for asking such a stupid question.
And I'm really sorry at how slow I'm writing this! I'll try to update the next chapter as soon as I can and hopefully make it longer!

Draco was right. They needed him alive after all. He was the only one who knew where this Horcrux was. Had they found out he’d erased his own memory, and he no longer knew, they’d kill him no doubt, and kill the trio along with him. Or maybe they wouldn’t believe him, and torture him until he became like the slobbering man he’d seen in the dungeons. Drool slipping from his mouth, eyes rolled up, body still, but alive. They wouldn’t give the mercy of death.
He let his gaze absently wander to the griffindore's table. His eyes went to the infamous Harry Potter. Normally Draco would have glared at his back, but this time he saw green. Potter was looking at him. Long before he looked at him. Draco sneered. Or at least tried to and turned away. He didn't fail to miss the others flustered look.
Molly Weasley was a young,
“What do I have to agree to?” Draco asked again, when the raven pulled him up by the arm. Draco’s mind dazed for a bit, and he stumbled forward only a moment away from falling into the unfortunate grasp.
His darling young sister. Lilliath Lucius Malfoy. Oh how Draco hated that name. Lucius. Malfoy. And what he would give to be rid of it.
The air around his became heavier and he lifted his head off the ground to look at the very cause of it. Potter. A siege of fear and panic rushed towards him. He'd totally forgotten about Potter!! Who was standing right in front of him.
“How can you be so sure?”
“And you promised to be truthful. I guess we both broke our promises, now didn’t we? So how about we start again, and your friend wouldn’t have to go through that again.”
It wasn’t his fault!
“I prefer the term creative, but I suppose that works too.”
It’s like only like
Honestly...Draco didn’t know where they were. Were they friends? Enemies?
The other obviously creeped out, slowly got out of his chair and started to tiptoe his way back to the door.
No response...it were as though his voice had been drowned out amidst this chaos. Buried six feet under his own skin. No one saw him. “
"Hmm.."
you..and
“No.”
Either way, hope you liked the chapter?
And it was so fucking selfish of him.
He just had to go, get what they needed, and then leave. No diddly-dadling, or as Blaise called it ‘exploring.’ That was food, and water. He had no doubt the group residing here was big. Consisting of at least four people. Two men, and two women. Blaise and Draco had followed them in hopes to perhaps finding their base, or some food to steal, and find their base they did.
He pressed the blade upward to prove his point, crying out in pain. His father lets out a snarl, pulling Granger up by her hair, and shoving her over to the trio. She stumbled for a bit, before falling limp in Weasley’s arms.
Well here it is! New update! Sorry for the delay. I had a lot of stuff going on. Anyways, I hope you like it! Be sure to review!
Draco was suprised at how fluently he said that. He'd expected to stutter a little or pause.
"Where is she!!????," He shrieked in realization and Mrs Weasley chuckled.
"I just did!!! Ok?!"
"Well that's too bad, princess, You're staying here."
And Harry.
Draco paused, not understanding Potter's words.
“Yes,
No reply still.
He chokes out a sob, his hand faltering slightly.
Her friends wouldn’t like that. They liked seeing her smile, even if it was in this hellhole. Shaking, she wobbled up onto the soles of her blistered feet, her legs trembling with every stretch of her bones.
"What the hell are you doing here?"
” he yelled in a hushed whisper, as though trying to tell a secret.
He didn’t want to think anymore. He was done.
“Promise?” he asks, the word slipping from his mouth before he could stop it.
Draco twitched at that, and glared at Pansy who looked at him grinning from ear to ear. She placed a hand on her hip and let her weight go down on one leg, before turning back to Potter with a demanding look.
And I've been having difficulty choosing and writing my next chapter, and my brain started wandering, so I started on other stories. So sorry for not updating, but I'm working on another copy of this chapter and I promise I won't erase it this time. So for anyone wondering, no this story is not being abandoned. I plan to update this month, hopefully by next week. I'm simply taking a break from my drarry stories for a while.
Draco swore he did his best to avoid his ‘mission,’ as much as he could, not wanting to take part of it. Killing Dumbledore?
Potter tell him that it was him? That he'd crush someone's life in such an ill manner?
"NO!" Draco cut in. "I've asked for it multiple times, and I don't want her to think I have some sort of a problem."
"How many hours have you been sleeping?"
Relief spread through his bones, as he came across the face of the brightest witch of her time.
Draco's eyes widened, and his face reddened even more. He swiftly turned his head around, and bit his lip, not daring to move, or even think about what Potter would feel like against him.
“No no no no..please..god now,” he pleaded, a tiny part of his hoping they’d feel sympathy. “No...nO..
Wincing Draco looks up and his eyes glimmer with hope. Molly Weasley. One of the nicest and feistiest woman he'd ever known. His eyes softened and the corner of his lips curved up a little until...
"Almost..Lilly hold on...please.. please.."
"No No NO!
When the bundle in his arms moved and shuffled, he held it tighter, breathing in the little warmth that it provided. Wait. Not it. Her.
“I know! And I have been...but sometimes I just need a break,” Draco tried, flailing his arms around to convey his point, but in no avail. Harry gave him an  unamused look and Draco continued. “C’mon...it’s the holidays, and we have weeks before school starts again. Let's do something for a change. You know...like head to town, have picnic, go grab a butterbeer? Anything!
He let out a small smile, as Lily giggled stuffing her face with a fork-full of chicken, practically mimicking Weasley’s actions from across the table. They were in complete sync, stuffing their faces with as much food as they could, and then gobbling it down with a gulp of pumpkin juice. From the corner of his eye he could see Granger scoldinging them.
Draco almost let out a gasp, but before he could determine what exactly it was underneath the concealer, his captor turned around facing away from him.
” he yelled in a hushed whisper, the fear of alerting such a creature gnawing at his bones. “Are you fucking crazy?!”
Before Malfoy could complete his sentence, Harry placed his hand on top of Malfoy's mouth, muffling any sound that he was making. "Honestly Malfoy. Has anyone ever told you how utterly annoying you are??"
Would Blaise have been willing to die to save everyone outside? To protect the lives of those who had turned their backs on them?
?!" Malfoy gapes. "I want to leave!"
Draco flicked his eyes up, pulling the hidden knife out from the strap under his jeans, and swiped at the raven. The other stepped back in surprise, bringing a hand up to keep the hand from his Blade met flesh, and the other winced, as it sliced his hand, blood spilling out from the wound.
I know this chapter is pretty late. Sorry about that. I had school, and exams and I also had to catch up with my other stories. It's no excuse, but still. Speaking of other stories. I also have another Drarry Story out there, and some other ships. Be sure to check them out!
Thick ropes whipped out from the light at the tip of the wand, wrapping themselves around him. They dug into skin, the twine like the blade of a dull knife.
you get a taste of what would happen to you if you refused. Didn’t feel the need to waste time in asking politely first..so here we are!”
"Last night?"
Draco was dazed. His head had once again, hit something, this time the door, and he stumbled to the ground when the door opened on him. His head was now pounding. As if swelling and then crunching back together again and again. One more hit, and draco didn't think he would make it.
“Shhhh...shhh..it’s ok..” was all that came in return, and it made Draco’s blood boil with rage. Another smear of the paste, and he howled. Wailing, and screeching like a wolf in transformation. “Shhhh..it’s ok.
“Okay?”
She sighed and looked around, not a single soul to be seen or heard in miles. Yes, Molly loved peace and quiet, and yes, she sometimes wished that the children went back to Hogwarts overtime she had to pick up after the mess created, but she also got quite lonely. Especially during times like these, when the usual bickering and laughing that filled the house faded as if it had never existed. And it scared Mrs. Weasley. To the point that her breath would quicken every time she saw someone leave the doors of this house. She was afraid. Scratch that. She was

His lips curved up ever so slightly, at the thought. Maybe they’d make Lily one of those horrid Weasley sweaters. She’d
Another hit, and Draco swore he could hee stars. His jaw rattled slightly, blood dripping out from the corner of his lips. “Try again.”
.it was no different than a ticking time bomb, ready to give out at any moment's time, and Draco needs to find a way out
anytime soon.
The theory didn't prove itself wrong, when what seemed like a strong pair of arms wrapped themselves around his shoulder...Potter.
. He’d been the one who’d done it in the first place.
Draco groaned and tried to pull away again. He could feel the croud growing around them, and every now and then a wave of nausea would hit Draco ceasing all his movement for a few moments.
Pansy tapped his shoulder, and motioned for him to get up. Breakfast was probabaly over. This was the time him, Blaise, and Pansy went out to play quiditch, or rather a modified version of it, consisting of only 3 players. Today was class free. At hogwards, there are 5 days with classes, and 2 without. He thanked merlin for these breaks. Without them Draco wasn't sure he'd survive.
and sat still, trying not to move, or aggravate Potter any further.
after all,
deserves to be treated like that! I can’t believe you left him
"He says he needs Malfoy on our side, so he wants me to make draco fall in love with me so I'd convince him to join DA."
Lilly grinned. "Okie, but...Draco wouldn't look bad in them"
Up close, she can make out the distinct features of the newcomer. Short blonde hair, a few strands brushing the front of his forehead in wisps, and a scar running across the bridge of his nose. He turns to look at Harry, who stood smiling sheepishly, excited to have met someone new.
“There you are!” a panting voice comes chirping in from his left. Draco whips his head to meet a set of emerald eyes, and a smile. Something Draco hadn’t seen in awhile. “Of thank fuck, I was afraid you might have gone down the wrong way or run into some unfortunate. Ah that’d be the worst, I mean, you don't even have a weapon–”
Blaise closes his eyes as the brunette pulls a knife out from under the cuff of her sleeves. He accepts his fate, his heartbeat slowing down. And he waits...for the knife to pierce through his neck...or his skull...maybe they’ll go for his heart. He isn’t sure, but as Hermione steps closer, he begins to relax, letting go.
Draco groaned with his head embedded inbetween his arms. He would close his eyes every now and then hoping to catch even the tiniest glimpse of sleep, only to open them again a few moments later when the fear would come reeling in again and again
“So...what were you doing out there, before we had our meeting together?”
Draco didn’t know what to think...he was
Harry turned around and only managed a step before something stopped him...
was grinning. “
No, Draco didn’t deserve this. He had his heart oozing out the sleeve of his leader jacket.
That is when Mrs Weasley finally understands. In the bundle in his hands, was a small child. A boy. A small boy. Why would Malfoy, of all people save a boy?
The raven jumped back slightly, keeping his guard up, and careful to stay between Draco and the window. They weren’t going to let him escape easily, but then again, Draco hadn’t expected anything else. He had to act quickly, before the raven’s friends joined him.
And Draco knows.

on your shoulders.”
"What do you mean by that!!?" he snarled.
"She's alright, she just has a small fever.
“Thank you, father,” and with that his father threw a handful of floo powder into the fireplace, and stepped in, engulfed by the flames.
But just as the other was about to leave, Dumbledore swings his arm around the others neck and pulls him back in.
Green caught his eyes, and his breath hitched, the hurtful words stopping themselves at the tip of his tongue. Yes, Draco was scared. Cowardly too, but could you really blame him? It seemed that having the dark lord residing in his very bedroom had given him the ability to feel magic. Or well...
The raven stuttered, face heating up the tiniest bit. “That’s not it!! You’re like..two feet away from us. You can’t exactly have a private conversation even if you wanted to!”
The bed is a plain mattress of the ground, pushed up against the corner as far away from the door as possible. He wonders if under all that foolish overconfidence, there was a flicker of fear inside Harry. Small, but still burning, eating up the last bit of oxygen around it.
Only Draco knows where the cure is hidden. He knows he can’t let it fall into the hands of the Third Eye. They’d use it for absolute power, to create a world in shackles.
"YES!!"
. What type of monster wears fucking mustard yellow with neon pink pants?”
See any mistakes? Tell me!
'Quit it Molly!!! Remember,
Potter pressed the vial against his lips, and this time he took it willingly. The raven moved out from under him, placing him back onto the bed, and pulling the sheets up his chin.

And only he knew how painful the process of applying it would be.
The only problem, he is a fool. A stupid foolish boy who’s made far too many mistakes, but he runs nonetheless. The shoe digging against the tips of his toes, and the random snarling of the unfortunates sending him the other way.
he found himself asking, almost craving for the answer to this question he couldn’t even begin to understand. He wasn’t even worth such effort. Wasn’t worth this potion. Fuck him, if he was even worth as much as a sickle. So why? Why put this much in for him. Why not just let him fall into the bliss of endless sleep. He’d be more than happy to sleep forever. Never needing to wake up again. Not having to deal with reality ever again. Not having to put the effort into dreaming...living...or
Draco slumps onto the floor, the walls beginning to cave in. He squeezes his fingers together before feeling them peel apart, and it’s suffocating. His lungs constricting and collapsing on himself, every breath feeling like a struggle.
Fingers trembling he reached for the vile that lay forgotten on the table top. Popping the top open, he tried pouring the potion down his throat. He felt the liquid dribbling down his chin, wetting his shirt, as vile slipped from his fingers a little, missing his mouth. He swallowed the little bit that had found it's way into his mouth, feeling the groggy taste enveloping his tongue.
"I don't care, Draco. You have to do this, else I'll contact your father next."

Now she knew that it was definetely
Draco swallowed the lump of fear, and let out a small mocking whine. “
Harry didn’t let Draco get close to the crowd of people waiting in a circle, instead opting to drag him away, into a deep underground tunnel. He wanted to talk...and touch and laugh together with them all. Wanted to feel what it was like to be close to another human other than Blaise.
Silence. Nobody knows why he should stay alive. No one wants him. No one needs him. Maybe they did, but not for the him...they didn't want
Draco eyes softened, he grabbed Lilly's shoulders and wiped the tears that silently slipped out of her eyes, before the grin spread itself across his face again.
“Yeah, well I wasn’t trying to
Draco winced again. "Blaise? I'm running on 3 cups of coffee and havnt slept in the last 4 days. Now I can feel Pansy talking. Please....kill me."
"Po-Potter," the boy infront of him breathed out and something tugged on Harry. Again. He let it pull him deeper, and smiled when the magic's hold on Malfoy's neck tightened.
No response.
hurt him. And Draco felt safe there, but then reality would come sinking back in. Reminding him that those days were only an illusion. A torture. Showing him the things that he could never have again. Back again, he took his mother's love for granted. Took everything as though it would never leave. His perfect little fairytale.
His head was in a jumble. Potter. Potter of all people had tried to kill him. Intentionally. And where'd he learned such a dark spell? Draco knew it was dark. If it hadn't been so, the spell would've never broken.
leaving your sister here and going off to who knows where. Probably to serve Voldemort."
he whispers the last word. “They deserve to get out of here more than we do.”
take another! It'll lead to overexposure."
Harry didn’t reply, glowering slightly, before getting up, fists clenching slightly. Shit...had Draco gone too far? Had he ruined his progress? Does Potter finally hae him now? Shit shit shit..fuck.

Maybe a little longer. A bit longer on this carousel and then the pain would be reduced to small shimmering tingles growing just under his skin. Spreading slowly like the virus he knows all too well, only it would bring peace. And unlike the virus, the numbness would bring silence.
he could.
Draco rested the front of his body with Lilly on door, and silently congratulated himself. He'd made it. To the safe place. To lily's safe place. To..the...the...
He looked up at Potter and never had he felt so relieved. This raging storm, alive...
He’d never killed a living person before. He wondered if it would be any more different that ending an unfortunate. The thumping of his heart didn’t help calm his nerves. Maybe if he just pretended the green-eyed boy was an unfortunate it would help. If it came down to it, he’d have to do it, or try dying. For Blaise.
"MALFOY! YOU DUMB ARSE!! COME BACK HERE RIGHT THIS INSTANT! !!"
Draco stared wide eyed at the chain of stairs. Was this how they stayed out of sight? Burrowing themselves under a massive underground system. Who had been here before them? What had they done to make this place their home? He followed, curiosity shrouding his instinct to run, and never look back.
Hermione gave a small groan of frustration, and quickly ushered out from the dorm door, heading down to Harry’s room. Harry followed, still confused, and just the tiniest bit worried.
Draco paused and took in a deep breath. He'd forgotten to breathe in that little rant of his. He panted and looked at Mrs Weasley with a flushed face.
as as potions. Slowly, he nodded, showing to her that he'd take them. Not really. He'd put up a front, like he'd done these past weeks, only a better one this time.
Draco cut him off. “Oh spare me the bullshit, Potter. Just answer the fucking question!”
The rage pulled back at his strings once again, trying to pull him back, deeper into his mind. “
didn’t deserve it. He’d failed them, and this was his punishment.
"I...eerr...I have c-classes to get to. Yeah! I-I'm alright now..so I'll get going!"
Another hit. “This is no time for games, Blondie. You either answer the question, or next time, it’ll be your friend that gets it.”
“Potter.”
of you?” Blaise whispered almost awed by the idea. No one had groups that big anymore. They’d all been infiltrated, and taken over. Some separated...others dead. Mauled until all who ceased to be a part of the group were nothing more than piles of guts, and bones.

is. But Draco knew that no matter how much Madame Pomfrey thought he was lying, there is no way she'd send someone who has claimed to almost be killed with the declared killer. "He..He tried to-"
Harry felt himself sink. Into the dark. The void. And strangely enough, he
“Draco–”
“It’s not a bad thing, look.”
“Now leave me alone, Potter.”
Hope you like it!    ヘ(￣ω￣ヘ)
” Draco screamed, trying to push the raven off him. He thrashed around in the cage that Potter’s arms had created. “LET GO!!”
And it was as though Potter couldn’t even hear him.
Harry nodded, letting out a toothy grin, and Draco almost dropped at the beauty of it. “Yeah! That’s what makes it fun!”
” Harry spoke carefully, and Draco went rigid.
The voice of a boy. A young, scared boy, begging for help.
No one knew the answer, and the silence killed him.
"Draco is hurt."
Potter nodded in agreement. They got up, dusting their robes off before trotting their way back to the castle.
Remembers his partners subjecting them to the virus, wondering if this creation would be the one, and each experiment had never lasted more than two weeks.
Draco looked awkwardly up at the raven before him. “
“They don’t seem like bad people.”
“Potions, and wand too.”
"It's time for a celebration!!"
The rain kept washing down upon them, and Draco wondered how it was that life could become one of those cheesy romantic movies he’d see on the muggle boxes. It felt too good to be true, and as one of Harry’s hands landed close to his hip, he felt his heart swoon the slightest, pumping blood filling with adrenaline throughout his entire body.
Harry stayed quiet for a few moments, before running his hand through black unruly hair, and nodding slowly. “Alright...but
Draco looked up confused. Why would Potter care if he didn't take them? And how was it that he knew? Draco was sure he'd put on concealing beauty charms and everything. Was it is body posture, or the lack of excitement that gave it away? He straightened his back and lifted his chin up. Ok Draco, you've got this. Just don't stutter.
Shit.
Malfoy turns around, and lifts his chin up a little in a noble way. "I want to leave."
Dumbledore was in a mess. He had to figure out how to execute his plan without it failing. And the most important fragment of this plan included Draco Malfoy. Lucius Malfoy's son.
Draco didn’t allow the other to finish. Instead, he let his trembling hand go limp, the blade slipping from his fingertips, and clattering onto the hardwood floor.
I'm so sorry!! This chapter is even shorter than the previous one! Anyways, hope you like it, even though it's short.
it. It was like he was surfacing above the water, only to have the tide pull him back down.
During the 4th year, someone had given pictures of Pansy to the press. The pictures had spread like wildfire. They had called her a slut. They'd made video's, taken photos of Pansy in ways they shouldn't have.
The blankets underneath him shifted and Harry raised his head to see Malfoy moving and squirming around in the bed. He took a closer look at the other's face and sighed. Malfoy was waking up.
Draco didn't know. He's lost track of time, and he could feel his consciousness slowly fading away. He could no longer tell if he was cold or warm. A tingling sensation had taken over his body, and with every passing minute his eyelids grew heavier.
“Remember that
Harry gazed down at the figure in worry. He plied the fingers off his wrist, shrugging the hand away and promptly ran out to find Madame Promprey.
The raven tilts his head amused, and Draco finds himself staring at the foundation that had been hidden behind his unruly hair just a moment earlier. It’s no mistake. Draco can make out the faint outline of a lightning shaped scar hidden away by the foundation.
See a mistake? Tell me! Both criticism and suggestions are appreciated!
Draco doesn’t even know why he’s angry. It’s irrational, and he knows he should probably stop, but– “Geez,
I don't know. I'm not opposed to writing sex scenes, but I've never down it before, and don't want to ruin the story in anyway. Let me know what you guys think.
stupid, was beyond him. “My
"Not just last night! The few nights be-." Harry paused abruptly, realizing his mistake. He looked up a little to see a sneer start to cover Malfoy's face. One of disgust and anger.
"Yeah, Potter? What is there to understand? Other than the fact that you've been
” Blaise snapped back, in a more hushed whisper.
Malfoy came not too long after he settled down beside the big whomping willow. He looked rather off, almost like plastic. The glamour was back up, but weaker than before It seemed Malfoy was getting weaker...from what? He didn’t know.
That was right.

Potter!"
Blaise snickered, and his captor gaped in disbelief. “I-I wasn’t snooping in!!”
Harry before him raised an eyebrow. “Care to elaborate?”
Sorry, I have never had a panic attack before, so I can't possibly begin to understand what that would feel like. I researched a bit online, and wrote this chapter based upon what I read. If there is something off, or wrong, please let me know! I'll be more than glad to fix it.
"P-please! I-I won't e-even come in..just...he-help her! I-I-"
“You know too much,” she replied back.
"Draco...you DO have a problem"
Potter holds him, and Draco breaks down. Crying, and sniffling in the other’s shirt. He looks pathetic, and weak, yet Potter holds him, ignoring the calamity unfolding around them.
Taking in a deep breath he turned around to place the lion back on the stand. Only he threw it instead, letting it fall and clatter onto the floor.
"I'll leave! I-I swear!, he abruptly cut in
"...s-tay...m-mother....
"Oh Ron....I'm always hungry."
He shakes his head meekly. “No...we have to–” Blaise pauses, eyes slowly widening in realization.
to look away.
"Better Lilly?," He asked.
It had horrified him to see one of his only friends be so broken. To the point of where even meeting someone would send her into hysteria. So how could he? And how
So..Lilliath or Lilly is an OC character. She practically looks like a younger version of Draco Malfoy, but without the gel. She's also Draco Malfoy's sister. Yeah.
"Hey..look Lilly. ..we're here...we made it girl..
“I have been working on them.”
Instead, he felt rather safe. Warm. Something he hadn't felt in a long while. Not since, Voldemort had moved into the manor. Not since he'd heard the screams of prisoners calling out to him. To help them. Not since all he'd done was watch. Watch as they trashed, shrieked in agony and begged for death.
Draco forced himself to look down at Lilly. She...she wasn't awake. She probably fell asleep...yeah, that was about right...WAIT! what if she wasn't sleeping?What f the cold had taken over her? What if she...she was-
He got closer and closer...lowering his broom more to the ground. His fingers turned unto water, and his grip on the broom broke...

"I see. I suppose you care a lot for this '
"This is kidnapping!! I'll-"
to her, You-know-who will be the last of your worries!" He tried to sound intimidating. Sound scary. Sound like a Malfoy, but how pathetic was this. He couldn't even speak Voldemort's name.
It was rare, but often times than not, Blaise would force his body awake for a while just for another chance to hear his friend’s voice filling the silence around them.
“Yeah?” She glides the knife carefully across the wood, taking pieces off strip by strip. Slow and calculated. “And what’s that?
“Oh! Did you eat that Treacle Tart that they served in breakfast today?” Draco shook his head, he hadn’t eaten anything at all. And now that potter had spoken of it, he could feel his stomach quench at the emptiness. Perhaps he should’ve tried to eat something. Potter seemed to be genuinely surprised by his answer. “YOU DIDN’T?!?!”
defect off the killing curse, however he had not expected wand - less magic.
He could see Mullet head turning around in shock, reaching out for him, while Blaise struggled against the ginger’s hold, while Hermione was yelling something into her coms.
Draco stared blankly at Potter, barely comprehending. His lack of sleep was catching up to him, and Potter's bloody yelling wasn't helping. He swallowed, feeling dry and raised his eyebrows, bringing back the cocky grin.
“Come now, Blondie. You’ll have to try a lot harder than that to kill me.” And there’s that chilling voice again. It’s familiar. The fear. It crawls up Draco’s spine, into the pits of his mind. His hair stands up on the back of his neck, a choked cry forced its way up his throat but stopped half way, fingers shaking.
The raven sniffed, and Draco swore those lips tugged up slightly. “Y-you called me Harry.”
She said the name with disgust and without fear. It seemed to shock Draco. To see how brave she was. If only he could be so, but as much as he admired her bravery, he was beyond pissed. This old, orange headed hag seemed to think that he was abandoning his sister for good! This is why he didn't like Weasleys'. Always thinking that they are the only family that ever has any human emotions.
“Ah...I know you’re awake.”
Malfoy!
Until next time~
When Draco woke up, he found himself cuddled against the soft fabric of the pillow, and rather...warm? No, that wasn't right. Draco wakes up cold. Always cold. The warmth that would engulf him in his dreams always disappeared the moment his eyes opened..so why? Why was the cold not returning? Was he still dreaming?
. But the funny side of things always hit him like the bottom of his father’s cane. Never hard enough to laugh, but hard enough to make him smile. Smile because he didn’t want to give his father the satisfaction of his yelps, but not to mock. It would only be mocking if he
It filled him, overflowing at the tip of his lungs. Smothering him. They shrieked and snarled, and Draco sobbed, curling up as though it would protect him.
Draco had to refrain from rolling his eyes. How was it Potter could be
Another hit to the jaw. Draco winced as another sharp pain bolted through his skull. Ears ringing, and head slightly dazed. “Don’t play games with me, traitor! You know exactly what I am talking about!
Sooner or later Malfoy fell on his face like a flopping penguin, but this time his body didn't rise back up the snow.
“What’s...a panic..attack?”
He regretted
faking it.”
," Blaise cut in. Finally. They were getting somewhere and Draco figured he'd do something to help his situation as well.
Pansy and Blaise chuckled. They dragged Draco to the great hall, and he sat on the edge of the table, Blaise beside him, followed by Pansy.
“Draco,” Blaise speaks again, more softly this time. “I know it’s hard, but we can’t put them at risk.”
“R-run–looking for food and w-water,” Draco stutters correcting himself.
He couldn't blame them for wanting  a piece of him. Not to be cocky, but you can't change the facts, now can you?
"Lets talk."
new. If you weren’t, you would’ve killed us by now,” Draco paused for a moment, his voice going quiet. “.
Draco felt a surge of anger, frustration rush through him. What do they know? What have they ever known?! Sure, they blame him for being prejudice, moving racist views, but how little they realized that they were just the same as him. They were cruel, mean, mocking, like him. Beat him up, just as much as he beat them up, so how dare they? How dare they put all the blame on him, as though it were all his fault.
He’d found a way out.
"Ok ok..just calm down," Harry spoke, voice still muffled with his sleep. He got up again, carefully climbing back into the bed. He raised his hands up in surrender when Malfoy's foot lifted again. "Woahohh Malfoy...calm..no one needs to get hurt here. Ok?"
No windows...just a small light, and it’s all too familiar, dragging Draco farther and farther back to when the virus had first broken out, and he remembers. He remembers everything. His betrayal. The reason for his mother’s death. The reason his friends died...the reason they were still hunting him, and he wants to run...and run...
And Draco attacks, lunging at the other with the spring in hand and aimed straight for the head. His prey stepped out of the way, but Draco didn’t waste any time on a second attempt, instead darts towards the rusty door. By the time Harry realizes what he is about to do, it is already too late. He slips past the door, shutting it behind him and twists the latch shut.
Draco swore he heard Potter laugh, before letting the pleasure of warm fingers running through his hair lull him into fabricated bliss.
They...they were running. Running because they were hiding. A betrayal like that would have killed in a way worse than turning into an unfortunate. Back there, turning was more merciful than being caught. So...they were running. Yes, running...but they’d been running or over 2 years now...maybe even longer. He couldn’t tell for sure. He remembers Theo. The first one of their group to be shredded to pieces. He remember Astoria. Their first kiss.
There was a pair of boots, that lay scattered on the floor before the mattress, which Draco eagerly put on, despite them being a size or two smaller.
Sitting at the end of his table, just watching,
The pain doesn’t come...instead he feels the pressure from is wrist slip as the ropes fall one by one to the ground. He snaps his eyes open, looking up at his captor in shock. He doesn’t understand.
"Malfoy! Malfoy! Yo-you can't tell anyone! Alright...y-you can't!"
(See the end of the chapter for
Instead his eyes widened and he gasped.
He held the probity Probe tight in his hand, careful to not touch it with the shard of glass just yet.
He’d seen their files, knows they aren’t...they don’t feel anything. They are monsters at most. Demons hiding in the body of a child.
"I'll be going, and when I come back you better have all your shit together. It honestly isn't this hard to have to take a stupid damned potion, and go to sleep. I'm starting to think your doing this to just get attention. I'm living the potion by the bedside, so take it. I have better things to do then waste my time,
