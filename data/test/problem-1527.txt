Draco listed all those things, trying to remember them, trying to hold on to the feeling of calm that he was experiencing...
On the corner of the room there was a stereo, that was an specific request from Harry himself. He had asked for the Cd’s to Draco, saying that he wanted to listen to them for a while, and the blond boy gave them to him without complaining.
"Do you know how to produce one?" Draco returned his attention to the boy in front of him. Those green eyes were looking right at him.
Harry slept during the entire train ride. Maybe he was half-sleep/half-listening to the conversation that his friends were having.
The party went by between impressions of the professors, anecdotes from years before and sometimes a game of ‘would you rather’, which entailed Malfoy asking something totally ridiculous and Harry refusing to answer.
“I was just thinking about this afternoon.” He lied with ease. “You are amazing, you know that?” A smirk appeared on Draco’s face.
He entered the house exhausted, wishing that today he would get to sleep in his bed because, honestly, he couldn’t deal with this any longer.
“I think that would actually be worst because maybe I wasn’t suicidal like your lot, but I managed to do my fair amount of dangerous things and my father doesn’t even have a clue. Hanahaki aside of course because, that night at the ministry, was pretty much the only suicidal thing I’ve ever did.”
She snapped her fingers, and Hogwarts house-elf wearing a pale pink tea towel popped into the room. Narcissa requested tea for three, and the house-elf was back in moments, holding a full sterling silver tea service and a small plate of chocolate biscuits.
“Don’t know,” Harry said, marvelling at the way the bond was blossoming as Draco woke. He could feel
Harry laughed. “Right, yeah. Sorry.” He let go to take out his wand, and smiled when the small object obediently grew into a picnic basket. He set it on the sand by the edge of the lake. A large picnic rug floated out to settle beside it, with butterbeer, sandwiches, pork pies, cream cakes, chocolate strawberries and sweet little pastries all piling out on top. He offered his hand to Draco, looking endearingly hopeful. “Join me?”
He had prepared a stone table in the middle of the clearing, carved with Dark runes. It was positioned precisely so that the moon’s rays would fall upon his chosen victim’s face.
that. He wanted his own fingers in Harry, coaxing him open, forcing him to relax and submit. He couldn’t even bear to use the spells, most of the time.
“You have no choice,” Draco said, flatly. “From my perspective, you already have. Which means that you will, whether you want to or not. Anyway, you’ll be out of detention in a couple of hours. You can’t stay with me now. I – my past self – needs you, upstairs.”
be safe, if we present a united front to any Slytherins who might be inclined to punish us for our betrayal. The seventh years, in particular. I think we can get most of the younger years to turn with us. There aren’t that many among them who have parents in the Dark Lord’s inner circle, and even fewer who are so invested in his cause that they won’t take a way out when they see it. Especially once we show them that we have Harry Potter’s loyalty and protection.”
“Wait,” Ron said. He held the Felix Felicis out to his brother. “Felix Felicis. Give everyone a sip first.” He cast a distrustful glare at the Slytherins, but if their defection was sincere, it would be practically criminal not to offer them some Liquid Luck. “Hermione’s gone to get Dumbledore. Leave some for her, if you can. The rest of you catch up. Guys, with me.”
She began to pace down the boundary, and Ron pulled out his mirror. He expected to see Hermione as she had been the last fifty times he’d checked on her; deceptively peaceful, as the curse slowly stripped her of her magic. But there was something wrong. The walls were shaking. Dust covered her hair and blanket.
“Because you’re attracted to me?” Potter offered. Draco just stared at him stonily. “You are,” Potter insisted, with a pointed flick of his eyes downward.
He spent them lying in the grass staring at the sky, or exploring the countryside around the Burrow. The woodlands nearby were filled with meadowsweet and foxglove, and the last of the bluebells. He gathered a small bouquet for Molly, and left them under a preservation charm on the kitchen windowsill.
Draco stared at him. He hated that he wasn’t surprised by that, and hated even more that he’d never known. His own father had never gone that far, of course, but he’d experienced it at the Dark Lord’s hand. Just once; a warning, to make sure he knew failure would not be tolerated. That was enough to last him a lifetime. “I’m sorry,” he said. “It hurts like nothing else. And the Dark Lord uses it on his followers indiscriminately, Greg. Even those he trusts absolutely, like my Aunt Bella. He’s a madman, and he’s going to lose. If you go back, you’ll die, or go to prison for the rest of your life. Our fathers are trapped by the poor choices they made decades ago. We aren’t. We can make our own choices, here and now.”
Goyle was silent for a long moment. He was wearing a Disillusionment Charm today, which Harry found odd. Any professors happening along would be bound to sense his presence and call him out. “He just got here,” Goyle said, sullenly. “But he was here all night, too.”
“It is up to the Wizengamot to determine his guilt or innocence,” Dumbledore said. “However, the judges pass sentence, and their motivations may sometimes be political. I imagine they will bow to public opinion, in this case. Justin will be hailed as a tragic and heroic figure, whose victim was a Death Eater’s son, and they will make him a figurehead for their cause, losing sight of the boy himself in their fever. It is more than likely he will be released without any punishment at all.”
. “I understand,” he said, pushing back desperately, forgetting control, forgetting everything but his overwhelming
out there. You think you’re safe here? Nowhere will be safe if they win Hogwarts! They’ll come for everyone in the end. We have to go back! We have to
“Oh, so not foolish, then, just ignorant?” Potter asked. His eyes were dancing, amused, and the dim light caught them in such a way that the green actually
“I won’t tell anyone,” Seamus promised, shooing Neville urgently away. He moved obediently down the table, a little away from them. “Or, well, just Harry,” Seamus amended, “if you think he needs to know.”
Seamus frowned. “I get why you don’t trust her, but you don’t know her like I do. She’s taking a NEWT in Muggle Studies, for her mam. She’s proud of her pureblood heritage, and she’s a loyal Slytherin; that will never change. But she’s also kind, and sweet, and she hates You-Know-Who as much as we do. And she really,
Ron snorted a laugh, scrubbing a hand over his face. “Yeah, okay, if you put it that way. Fine. Need help setting up, Parkinson?”
“Yeah,” Dean said, miserably. “Thing is, Seam, she’s so popular. She’s got about four boys in her own year who’d snatch her up as soon as I was out of the picture. And that’s just in Gryffindor. House rivalries mean nothing when it comes to Ginny. I’ve even caught
“A poor one, obviously,” she said, laughing. “But I mean it. Most people would hold the professor in contempt, after last night.”
Draco shook his head, a little embarrassed. He’d never told anyone about Elliott; not even Pansy. He might have been only five years old when the dragon first appeared, but even then, he’d known having an imaginary friend was not particularly sane. “He wasn’t really there, of course. I know that. But I missed him, when he went away. He told me I didn’t need him anymore; that I would meet someone at Hogwarts who would become more than friend and protector, more than family. I was angry at him for a long time. I didn’t understand how one person could be
“Yes, indeed,” Umbridge simpered. “But I think you’ll find that Mr Potter does not deny it. After all,” she said, meeting Harry's eyes maliciously, “he knows very well that
. Even being a conduit for such an outpouring of the Wild Magic had almost drained him to the core. “Look, thank you. Really. But Draco gave
Malfoy snarled and shoved his own hand through the gap, grabbing hold of Harry’s shirt and yanking him up against the wards. Harry trembled helplessly as Malfoy scrabbled under his shirt, splaying his hand possessively over Harry's bare stomach. “He’s
He snatched the wand right out of Rowle’s hand. The curse went wild. He dropped Rowle’s wand, snapping it with one quick, hard stamp. Rowle howled in rage, grabbing him around the throat. Fred scrabbled at his hands, forgetting his own wand as they tightened until he couldn’t breathe.
Harry nodded silently, and averted his eyes when Ron squeezed her hand and dropped a consoling kiss in her hair.
at the two, taking them both by surprise. Creevy was thrown backwards, his camera flying into Draco’s outstretched palm. Potter just staggered a little, which didn’t really surprise Draco. Typical Chosen One. Which made the ridiculous title, he supposed, somewhat more believable. If the idea that one sixteen-year-old boy with an over-inflated ego could defeat the most powerful Dark Lord of the modern age was at all believable, of course.
She looked up in time to see Potter’s eyes blink open. He tried to push himself up, and cried out. “Draco?”
He looked up, his expression changing instantly, and Hermione caught her breath. For a moment, just a moment, Harry had looked carefree, unreserved and – yes,
Pansy saw the Chosen One's eyes flutter. His lips moved, and the Dark Lord bent down to hear him. She was too far away to catch any of it, but the Dark Lord jerked backwards. He spun on one heel, face visibly whitening when he saw Draco. “No.” He shifted his grip around Pettigrew's wand. “
It was unforgivable. Far worse than the Unforgivable Draco had used on him. That had been to save Harry’s life. Harry’s intentions had never been that pure, and he wasn’t sure he could forgive himself for that. So how could Draco ever forgive him, for any of it?
He broke their kiss abruptly. “Draco. In the Great Hall. Did you touch me here, on my back, deliberately?”
!” he cast again, not quite daring to look down to see if it was working. For all he knew, he could be making it worse. “Help!” he cried, as he dragged her over the threshold.
. He made me believe in him, made me –” He faltered and stopped, a strangled moan escaping his lips.
. He just couldn't think of a single plausible reason for having spent the night on the bathroom floor. “I’m sorry,” he said, tears gathering in his eyes.
“Walking on that leg could cause permanent damage, Mr Nott,” Madam Pomfrey warned. “It’s splinted, but if you were to injure it again –”
Pansy threw up a shield, instinctively using one Draco could build on. He rolled into a crouch. They worked together, weaving a thick ward between their wands.
“Six Death Eaters,” Draco corrected him, “and one werewolf.” He looked sick. “He wasn’t supposed to be here, Harry. I swear I didn’t know he was coming. I didn’t know.”
“Exactly!” Harry said, in frustration. “He’s eaten every meal for the past two days in the Great Hall. He gets to class early and sits with Parkinson, or Zabini. He disappears into the Room of Requirement during his free periods, or between classes, and won’t open the door to me. And by the time I finish detention with Snape in the evening, he’s already back in Slytherin.”
He could help, Draco realised. If he was very, very careful. If he made sure no one saw him or his spells, and he didn’t change the fate of anyone he knew had already died. Except Harry, he thought. He
“For centuries,” Draco agreed. “But in 1899, a female Hebridean Black stood for thirteen hours against ten wizards, protecting her three young cubs, and roasted all of the wizards alive. Not before sustaining mortal wounds herself, however. The dragons were already on the verge of extinction in Britain, and when the wizarding public heard about it, a grass-roots campaign was formed to pressure the Wizengamot into passing a law to protect the few, remaining dragons. It wasn’t long afterwards that the rest of the world followed, and the reserve in Romania was established. The Hebridean cubs are still there, I believe.”
Scrimgeour held up a hand. “No, let him speak.” He raised an eyebrow at Harry. “Though if we could set aside the personal insults for the time being...?”
Harry felt a familiar wrench behind his bellybutton. The world spun away. The last thing he saw was Draco's grey eyes, widening in shock, his mouth opening in a scream.
“Good boy,” Draco praised him. He pressed his thumbs into Harry’s hole, stretching it out a little. “So wet for me,” he groaned, bending to lick a stripe all the way from Harry’s hole up to his balls.
Harry nodded. He could understand that. Of course, James Potter might have been a bully in school, but he’d outgrown that. He’d certainly never tortured Muggles or killed people for sport, like Draco’s father. “Do you think he’ll defect?”
He found a group under siege, and broke up their attackers. He protected Hannah Abbott and the ward-bubble as she used it to get three wounded to the infirmary. Ran across George Weasley, searching frantically for his twin, and directed him to the kitchens. Caught a fragment of someone’s yell about Slytherin. Went, and found only chaos and bodies. There were still two fighting, but one was cut down before Draco’s eyes. The last, a third-year Slytherin, flung herself under a table. She threw up a shield, but a Death Eater destroyed it almost instantly.
The Eternity Mirror? Infinity? It was powerful, anyway, and it made sense now that Pansy had finally succeeded in her attempts at scrying.
“Yes,” Draco said, firmly. He went to close the book, and his eyes caught on something. His expression lightened. “Except this. It says Earth Mages have the ability to ground lightning.” Harry snorted, and Draco laughed. “Do you think he imagined what we could do with that?”
another way. Justice, not vengeance. I can live with his survival, if it means my conscience is clear.”
“You’re blocked.” Professor Trelawney nodded wisely. “Your Inner Eye is clouded, my dear. I knew it as
“Time to go!” Seamus shouted, dragging him up. Harry stumbled into a run. Seamus and Dean were throwing spells over their shoulders, and the people in the battlements were firing thick and furious over their heads.
Harry squeezed in between the beds. McGonagall was lying next to Nott, who was pale but conscious. There was a soft blue glow around his left leg. Daphne was kneeling next to him, whispering quietly to him. She stopped when Harry perched on the bed next to her.
Draco scowled at the top of his head. “I’m not that powerful. I’m proficient at non-verbal casting, but I’ve never been able to cast wandlessly. Not until we started using the Wild Magic, anyway. And I’m an Earth Mage, remember? Somehow I don’t think that includes summoning spells.”
Neville and Seamus grumbled and shifted at the noise, but Harry was asleep again before the echoes died away.
He had a duty, as the Chosen One, to do what was necessary to stop Voldemort. But becoming the Saviour they called him meant living (if he lived) the rest of his life with the knowledge that he was a murderer. He’d already killed Quirrell when he was just eleven years old. Out of necessity, yes; maybe even self-defence… but surely that did something to a person? Surely he was
“Why?” she said, eyes narrowed. “You have to know I’m going straight to the Auror Department to report you. Using an Unforgivable
Professor Trelawney looked put out. “Of course,” she said, rallying, “I knew that you knew of it. That is why I can risk imparting this knowledge to you. The Infinity Mirror does not show the future, but rather the many, many paths the future might take, branching off from an individual’s decisions and stretching into eternity. It is a truly unique and powerful Artifact.”
He turned to see Draco watching him with those careful grey eyes, his whole body unnaturally still, as if he was waiting for a trap to close in around him. Harry let out a long, silent breath. It hadn’t occurred to him that Draco might be just as nervous as him. But it was too late to change anything now, which meant that whatever Draco’s reaction, he had to make the best of it.
“He’s been staying in the gatekeeper’s cottage at the Manor,” Draco explained. “Mother’s been caring for him. He escorted her here tonight, in fact.”
“Of course not. What I told you before was true. I never intended to allow Mr Malfoy to murder me. Narcissa Malfoy apparently felt the same way. She went to Professor Snape with her sister, Bellatrix, and pleaded with him to save her son. The result being that Severus made an Unbreakable Vow to complete Draco’s task should the boy fail to do so. He did so with my complete approval.”
A small thrill went through Draco. It was only theory, of course. There was no actual proof that a wizard’s core was his soul. But it was undeniable how much it felt like
Like a string snapping, the pull stopped. She almost went head over heels backwards. Steadying herself, panting, she looked down at the now-dormant wand. The Dark Lord was powerful, but surely not even he could produce an effect like that? It was like – like the wand had
She turned. Her eyes widened, looking at something behind him. Draco threw himself to the ground automatically. A jagged rock pierced his side, and he screamed. Spells flashed over him, from both directions.
“Then their souls could be destroyed,” Death warned. “Or, worse, condemned to this limbo forever. It is not a fate I would wish on anyone. I am not unsympathetic to your grief, Pansy Parkinson. But the dead are under my protection. Their journeys are my responsibility. I would be remiss in my duty if I did not warn you against such a reckless endeavour.”
Snape had pulled Harry’s blood-soaked robes away from the wound so he could work, and Harry slipped them on absently, watching as Snape cast
One memorable day, he’d been trying to help his mother restore the Hall of Mirrors, only for his ridiculous magic to grow every mirror in the Manor by three feet, crashing through all the ceilings above them. Another day, he’d tried to light a fire in his room, only to accidentally set all the fireplaces in the Manor blazing.
Harry frowned slightly. He thought perhaps he should try to defend Dumbledore, but that seemed a little too much like defying his Alpha, so he said instead, “I thought the bond couldn’t be broken.”
Harry dug his Invisibility Cloak out of his pocket and enlarged it, flinging it over their heads. They crept back up the hallway to find a group of third year girls already in the common room, laughing and settling into the sofaes by the fire. The portrait door was closed.
Harry returned to the Burrow that night, his heart full to bursting. He didn’t think he’d ever been this happy.
“No!” Draco said, his vision blurring. He gasped as the man twisted again. “There’s a letter; it’s making its way to the Dark Lord right now, with an explanation! I would never betray our lord! Let me go!”
to choose, even before Dumbledore told you about the Horcrux. And I think, if you had survived, you would have done what was expected of you and married Ginny and gone on to become an Auror with a white-picket fence and two-point-five children. You would have been unhappy and lost, your whole life, never admitting that what you
“Wha –?” He blinked around at his friends, and noticed Pansy passing Draco a handkerchief. Draco used it to wipe at the shoulder of his robes, and Harry felt his cheeks heat up. “Fuck,” he said. “I wasn’t –?”
“No true Slytherin would ever allow themselves to be blinded by love,” Pansy countered. “And Draco is, above all, a Slytherin.”
“Maybe I am,” Harry said. He let Draco take his weight; rough cloth against the soft, vulnerable skin of Draco’s inner thighs and groin. Draco whimpered and tried to squirm away, but Harry held him still, kissing up Draco’s jaw to his ear, sucking in a perfectly-formed earlobe. “Maybe it’s – all – my – fault.” He bit down just a little too hard, and Draco yelped, tugging Harry’s head back sharply.
But no matter how good Draco’s false-face was, even he couldn’t conceal the truth of how he felt from the one he loved. Not after the trauma they’d just experienced. Harry had seen it in the infirmary; in his pained grey eyes, his outstretched hand, the helpless tears on his cheeks.
“Well, yes,” Hermione said, matter-of-factly. “But that was just one date, and Justin’s attack was far more interesting at the time, especially since nothing else seemed to happen between you two after that. I suppose people just assumed it was a freak event, and dismissed it as such.”
committed to defecting, he would be free to adjust his plan accordingly. We cannot risk that. We cannot risk his safety, or the safety of the school.”
Harry looked up at him, smiling. “You want to romance me, Draco?” he teased. “Candles and flowers and music?”
Miffy just about beamed, her smile stretching from ear to ear. She bobbed another curtsey, and disappeared with a
“I know,” Draco said, running a hand through his hair. It was an indication of his agitation, Pansy thought, that he didn’t immediately seek out a mirror to smooth it down again. Instead, he paced across the room and stood staring down into the fire. “Madam Rosmerta will deliver the letter by this evening, at the latest. My hope is that it appeases him, at least for now. I just – I have to focus on my task now. I’m running out of time.”
He risked touching Draco’s hand with his little finger, and smiled helplessly when Draco turned his hand over, letting him lace their fingers together.
He was completely engrossed in a particularly complex equation when Dumbledore’s voice boomed out across the Great Hall. He had to control his instinctive reaction to flinch.
Pansy looked up at her, and then around. Her vision was blurred by tears, but she could see Professor Lupin and Beau Robards, unconscious on the floor. They were human again, blood around both of their mouths.
Harry’s eyes darkened instantly. “Yeah?” he said, the tone of his voice quivering just on the edge of danger. Draco saw it in his eyes a split second before he rolled them, pinning Draco to the mattress. “And what if,” he said, forcing Draco’s thighs apart and pulling one leg up and out to tease at his entrance, making Draco jerk and whimper, “what if I want
No one would give him a newspaper, but Luna brought him a Quibbler one evening. “Thanks,” Harry said, doubtfully. The cover was a picture of the pyramids of Egypt, with the words ‘First Contact with Creatures from Space!’ splashed across it.
Crabbe Senior moved forward to take Harry's wand. More and more Death Eaters were coming out of the trees. They were surrounded. Harry started to panic. But Cardosa made a gesture, and they parted, leaving a path. If Draco would just
Harry breathed in. “Okay,” he said, and breathed out. He created the most harmless thing he could think of with such an enormous amount of magic; an illusion of a tiny Welsh Green dragon, no bigger than his finger. He put all that magic into the finest details, crafting tiny, sharp claws, a beating heart, forked tongue, ribbed wings, green scales that shone diamond-bright, and a tiny birthmark on its forehead.
Harry smiled. He remembered thinking, weeks ago, that Ron would probably have an aneurysm before this was all over. Of course, his so-called best friend might actually
It was the work of a few moments to find the lodestones. All Draco had to do was follow the threads. But finding them was the easy part.
Harry glanced at him sideways. “You said that before, when we were in the infirmary. You said you couldn’t ground yourself. That I was killing you.”
. He writhed on the table, hands turning slippery with sweat, his thighs trembling with need. “P-please,” he sobbed, fire shooting up his spine. His toes clenched and tears sprang to his eyes as Draco’s tongue dug deeper, wriggling inside him. “
, Pansy thought. She had no patience for stupidity, and making reckless accusations about Draco Malfoy to a group of his most loyal friends
Harry said a silent goodbye to her, and stood. A stab of pain went through his chest, and his legs trembled. He had to steady himself against a trolley to crouch beside Draco. Ignoring Snape’s glare, he pressed a kiss to his fingers, and touched them to Draco’s lips.
Instead, he used Malfoy’s first hex, from the homework. He couldn’t quite manage it non-verbally, but he said it under his breath, three times. Malfoy caught the first two with the counter-spell, but the third one got through, and he was flung off his feet.
Draco sighed. “Thank you, Harry. But our magical cores don’t control or determine our actions. It is our actions that make a soul ugly. Evil.”
Draco’s face was lined with pain, but he shook his head. “It's the lodestones. They’ve done it already. One down. Six to go.”
. This whole situation had gotten way out of hand, and he had no one to blame but himself. He’d gone too far, given Draco the absolute assurance that his feelings were real, and that had given Draco permission to let himself return those feelings. Only there were no feelings to return. Anything that Harry might have (possibly) begun to think could be between them was over. Events had overtaken him before he could fool himself into thinking a relationship with Draco Malfoy was anything but the height of stupidity, and that was a
They had no choice but to tell her the truth. About the mission to Malfoy Manor, which she’d been excluded from, and the fact that Draco’s team had never made it back out. She insisted not only on joining them herself for the return mission, but bringing along her fellow Slytherins.
“It’s what I saw,” Draco agreed, mildly. Harry shifted, feeling uneasy at the direction the conversation was going. “Which makes me wonder why our esteemed Headmaster
Harry was on him immediately, straddling his waist. He used his weight to force him flat, vaguely disturbed by how easy that was. Malfoy had always been thin, but this was just ridiculous. He bent close, wand digging into Malfoy’s neck. “I can protect you,” he breathed, lips just barely touching the curve of Malfoy’s ear.
, Malfoy,” he snapped, annoyed. More annoyed that he could feel his cock pulsing at the words, smooth and enticing, than at the idea Malfoy might actually believe what he was saying. “You don’t want a kid.”
“Ron,” Harry said, “find as many people who will fight as you can. And grab my Felix Felicis from my trunk. Make sure everyone gets some. Hermione, find Dumbledore.”
He followed the pull of the bond to a nondescript hallway. It was chaos. Bellatrix had Harry pinned to the wall with a Full-Body Bind, next to a picture of a fruit basket. Her inner circle was effectively holding off any potential rescuers; she wasn’t even bothering to cast defensive spells.
“I love you,” he mumbled into the pillow. He didn’t have to say it out loud anymore, of course. Draco knew. But he wanted to, because he could, and because it made Draco smile.
it, not properly! Not even Voldemort can do that, and he’s a Dark Mage! No wonder they used to think White Mages were evil. Maybe we are – maybe
; he couldn’t help it. Draco glanced back at him and rolled his eyes, but there was an undeniable, if small, smile on his face as he walked away.
Shock slammed through the courtroom. Voices rose in a crescendo, people straining their necks to get a look down at the bench where Harry and Draco sat. Justin was scowling, and Umbridge’s face twisted sourly.
She shot to her feet. “Headmaster!” she gasped. Everyone else was close behind, almost stepping on her heels in their eagerness. “What’s happening? Is there news? Where’s Harry?”
“Ah.” Harry bit his lip. “I’ve kind of been down here before. As well. The day after you were attacked by Justin, when you were in the infirmary. You asked me to get Pansy, and she left the common room door open, and I –”
Malfoy shrugged, a dull flush creeping up his neck. “Well, it’s not as if I could have blamed them, is it?” he said. “But I’d wager they’d meet me face-to-face. To attack from behind was cowardly and contemptible.”
There was the sound of someone choking. Weasley; of course Weasley, when were the Golden Trio ever apart? “
“Sorry!” he gasped, tightening his grip on his wand. They had reached the end of the passage, and his father and Kingsley Shacklebolt had their heads together, conferring in urgent whispers.
Trelawney’s face fell. “Oh, my poor child.” She paused, obviously thinking seriously. It was an unusual enough occurrence that Pansy held her tongue and waited. Finally, Trelawney said, “A medium this small will only show you images. Flashes of the future.”
Harry straightened, his eyes flying open, fear and – something else, something darker and hotter and
Harry was offering up Voldemort’s magic to the Wild Magic, Draco realised. A sacrifice, just like the Dark Moon Ritual. And in return, asking something far beyond even the ability of a White Mage. Turning back the clock, but not like the Time-Turner. What Harry wanted, what he was doing, was bringing forward the state of everything from several hours ago, and resetting it to now. That was why Draco’s wounds had vanished.
It wasn’t that he was ashamed of being gay. It was something that was completely out of his control, just like being the Boy Who Lived, or being a Parseltongue, or being a Beta. He’d accepted his dynamic when he turned sixteen; refused to think less of himself for not having a knot, unlike Ron (who had had what amounted to a complete mental breakdown, until he realised Hermione was an Alpha, and then he went oddly reticent about the whole thing).
“Fuck off,” Seamus said, mildly. He didn’t argue with his friend’s assessment; it was true, after all. He sighed. “I just wish it wasn’t something so damned hard. I mean, even I can see Malfoy’s appeal, and I’m not bent, and I’m taken. So that’s a point in our favour. But Harry and Malfoy are sworn enemies. How do we convince him to even listen to Pansy’s proposition, let alone take it seriously?”
He imagined himself touching it, resting his forehead against it. He imagined it was warm, like Draco’s arms. Maybe Pansy was wrong. Draco didn’t need him, or the bond, to stay safe. He could take care of himself. He’d proved that today, again and again. Maybe – maybe it was okay to let go, after all. Harry prayed to all the Founders, to Merlin himself, that he was right, because he didn’t think he had a choice anymore.
– the war, and people dying, and Justin, and poor Harry –” She cut herself off, making a sudden decision. “At least I know my own heart, and the man I love isn’t on the other side of the war. I don’t want to put it off any longer, Ron.”
That the world was not kind to Omegas was an understatement. Severus Snape was living proof of that, and Harry considered himself a close second, even if he had been lucky enough to have been bonded to someone who really loved him, despite their rocky start.
She gave him a wry look. “I know what you’re thinking. And, no. They’re more than welcome to each other. I don’t have any regrets. Other than Blaise, and – and breaking up with you.”
“Because she’s not willing!” Seamus snapped. “And you know it. Your ‘victory’ would turn to ashes in bed with her.”
Down a side hallway, Flitwick was engaged in a battle with Bellatrix Lestrange. The spells were flying so thick and fast that Hermione couldn’t even make them out. But –
Harry’s brow wrinkled. “I don’t understand. Dumbledore’s never said... if he thinks I can’t die, why did he tell me I had to?”
Draco sighed. “Harry hates me for what I did to him, Pans. I know, even if he hasn’t said the words. I can feel it, here.” He tapped his chest, over his heart. “He’ll never forgive me.”
“I think you could learn some respect for your elders from Mr Malfoy here,” Argus told him. “For the rest of this detention, you will call me sir.”
Draco scoffed. “You can’t be serious.” Harry shrugged, and Draco stared at him. “Really, Potter. It’s the
Draco grunted, settling Harry more comfortably against his chest. He could feel his robes sticking to his skin. Harry’s blood. “Thank you,” he said, his throat closing. “Cousin.”
“The… dragons?” Harry said, and Luna nodded serenely. Harry decided it was probably safer not to ask. “I wanted to thank you,” he said, instead. “You gave the Resurrection Stone to Pansy. I don’t know how you knew, but –”
Harry snorted, and Draco’s eyes narrowed. “Sorry,” Harry said. “Just, Hermione’s always going on about that.”
So Harry went to see Kingsley, who made time for him without question. Together, they drafted a petition to the Wizengamot, and took it to Scrimgeour for approval. Three days later, Dean was granted special exemption to have visitors, and Remus and Beau were released into the care of the Creature Maladies ward at St Mungo’s.
Future-him just shook his head again. He pointed to the trees, his lips pressed together, a thin, solemn line.
“All this time,” Harry said, in horrified disbelief. “This whole year, you’ve been lying to me? Why didn't you just tell me? I thought we were honest with each other!” He hugged his arms across his chest. “Our whole relationship –"
Harry caught him. Draco was dead weight in his arms, and his heart skipped a beat as he realised the other boy was unconscious, head lolling back dangerously. Harry crossed quickly over to the couch nearest the fire, laying Draco’s damaged body down carefully. Except it wasn't really his body, was it? It was his soul, or his mind, or some combination of them both.
“The Headmaster has already informed me that you will be speaking on Mr Finch-Fletchley’s behalf,” she said. “He’s arranged it all with the defence. You have permission to be there on the day they call you.”
“All right?” Harry asked. He had no idea about music, except that Mrs Weasley loved Celestina Warbeck, and Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon were adamantly opposed to heavy metal (which, of course, Dudley tended to play very loudly when they were out, and blamed any tapes Petunia discovered on Harry’s ‘rotten influence’).
Hermione pursed her lips. Of course, people slept together all the time without falling in love. Ron and Lavender, for instance. Ron had certainly not been in love with her, even though he’d been all over her trying to get in her pants for months. (Lavender still refused to even acknowledge Hermione’s existence.)
“Her intention was to discredit you,” Draco said, calmly. “Which she very neatly did, I might add. Clearly she wants your reputation tarnished. I wouldn’t be surprised if she was receiving her orders directly from the Dark Lord.”
Ron watched as Harry urged everyone to start moving up the stairs again. His throat closed. Always that bloody saviour complex, always saving everyone else. He wanted to say something, but he didn’t know what. “Watch your step, mate!” he settled on.
She looked tired, and Harry wondered if the Minister and his staff always worked through the weekend, or if the war was taking its toll.
The surge of grief was sudden and unexpected. He remembered the way Dobby had lit his room with magic every night, when his father had first taken away his night-light. The way he’d hidden Draco in the kitchen pantry when his father had been on the warpath, and Elliott had been away. The way he’d snuck Draco cream cakes after his father sent him to bed without supper.
She saw the moment this registered with him; the slow shiver of pleasure that forced his eyes shut, fingers and toes curling against the thick rug. “Salazar’s
to do it again, and now I could just – suck the air right out of his lungs without even saying a word, or lifting my wand! And I don’t
George glanced at his twin. Charlie and his mates were circling behind the Death Eaters to where Umbridge was holding their mother hostage. Bill and a few others were watching helplessly from inside the cage. He couldn’t see Percy or their father.
“Three taps,” he said, unsteadily. “Tap my leg if it stops working. I mean it. Do it now to show me you understand, or I’m pulling out, right now.”
“And which he does not even have a scar from,” Madam Primrose said. “Please, Mr Potter, you are obstructing the course of justice.”
He knocked on the wall, shifting from foot to foot as he waited. This battle of wills with his once-nemesis, the power struggle as each fought to be the one in control of the encounter, was
He opened the door, ignoring Cardosa swearing behind him as they crowded in after him. He crossed the room to Draco’s trunk. There were more wards on that, but Vince had seen him set them often enough. He knew how to remove them.
He spent Tuesday frantically trying to catch up on Herbology and Potions, the two subjects he’d let lapse over the past week, on the theory that in Potions, at least, he had the Half-Blood Prince to help him, and Herbology was the one subject he could usually cruise through fairly easily.
Hermione blinked. “Yes. Of course. But I just assumed… you kissed him awake the next morning, after the battle.”
Ron dashed a hand across his eyes. Okay. Okay. He didn’t like it, but he understood. Knowledge of the past could have devastating effects on the timeline. If he were to use that knowledge when he went back, to save someone, or turn the battle in their favour, then Future-him would never tell him about it. And that would create a paradox. Who knew what would happen then? A new timeline, or perhaps the destruction the universe itself.
“Albus Dumbledore was an arrogant young fool!” Pius snapped, and Harry couldn’t contain a surprised snort of laughter. He’d heard Dumbledore called many, many things, especially since his death, but ‘young’ was not one of them. “Please do not compare yourself to him, Master Malfoy. He was angry, and proud, and he cast his broken Omega aside instead of trying to help him, and then lived his life as if he had learned nothing from the experience. Almost certainly he had great potential, once – as you do – but potential is nothing without a humble heart and an open mind. Remember that.”
to explode, and if he didn’t let it out, it was going to turn inwards on him. That much magic, imploding inside him… it would destroy him, leave him a mindless, gibbering fool, if it didn’t kill him first.
with butter, hash browns, pumpkin juice and a piping hot cup of tea. He was pretty sure he could eat the lot and still have room left over.
,” she said. The door opened. “Stay back,” she warned, crossing over to the door into Pomfrey’s office.
“He’s overreacting, Mother,” Draco said. Her eyes narrowed, and he sighed. “The truth is, fixing the Vanishing Cabinet was more difficult than I’d hoped. I had to give up my place on the Quidditch team, my prefect duties... I could barely maintain a passing grade in the classroom. I had to use several restorative draughts, and other potions, to cope.”
Seamus was, too, really. It just didn’t feel real. He’d been bound in place, screaming, helpless, forced to watch as Dean was ripped apart by werewolves, as Pansy was sucked dry by Dementors. And then, when Harry had
“You mean if it was what you decided I needed!” Harry retorted. “Do you want to know what I really needed, Draco? I needed to know that you
“Let me know if you think of any, yeah?” he said, dryly. “We should probably go. I’ve got detention with McGonagall, two hours ago, and I don’t want to be late.”
Pansy smiled. “That may be, my love, but if he hurts you, it won’t be just his balls I hex off. Potter, don’t keep me waiting. Draco,” she rose up on her toes to kiss his cheek, “sleep well, darling.” She winked at him. “I’m sure you will.”
Pansy glanced over, reluctantly, at Blaise and Ginerva. The two seemed to do nothing but snog and fondle each other in the most nauseatingly public fashion. Still, it was a good strategy. Blaise never involved himself in anything that did not benefit him in some way or another, and as a result, he was almost universally respected, if rarely trusted, by their fellow Slytherins.
“It is how an Alpha places their claim, Mr Potter,” Madam Pomfrey explained. “Your true mate, of course, would consummate your bond by doing so. However, if it was any other Alpha, they would destroy your preliminary bond. Subsequent bites would form the beginning of their own bond with you; a far more difficult process, but still a significant risk. We will not allow that to happen, I assure you.”
Pansy didn’t let herself flinch. “You’re not sorry,” she said, very lightly. Draco looked away. He knew he’d hit a nerve, and he didn’t dispute the move away from the gravity of their conversation. She stood and walked over to him, bending to kiss his cheek goodnight. “You use me shamelessly,” she said, close to his ear. “And I wouldn’t have it any other way.”
Pansy glanced at Potter. He hadn’t moved since Vincent had cast his spell. He looked near-unconscious, moaning, his chest ripped open. His heart, bloody and throbbing, rose into the air. How he wasn’t dead, Pansy didn’t know. Maybe the Wild Magic was keeping him alive.
“Good,” Hermione said, briskly. “Then we need to do something about it. We need to find a way to get that
he’d missed. By midnight, just one look at that sickly blue vial of Invigoration Draught had brought tears to his eyes. He remembered stumbling to the door in blind exhaustion, remembered looking for Vince, and seeing Potter instead.
are the problem, Mr Malfoy. Mr Potter is in heat, and a mated Omega’s heat focuses on his Alpha. You are the one preventing him from fixing on you, but his heat has already begun, and in the lack of a mate, he is reverting to his pre-bond physiological responses. While your presence at least appears to be holding the full heat back for the moment, it will not continue to help for much longer, and you will be unable to soothe your Omega’s need. You will be forced to let him go, and let another claim him.”
Harry rubbed a thumb over his lightning-bolt scar. It didn’t hurt anymore. He wondered if Dumbledore expected him to visit. He didn’t think he would. “And the article?”
“But not unprotected. Draco’s bedroom is safer than a dragon-level vault in Gringotts, believe me. There is not a single person who could get into that room without his permission. Not even me, or you.”
“We’ll discuss that in a moment,” Scrimgeour decided. “Right now, there is a question of Mr Malfoy’s guilt or innocence to be decided, and little time to waste on it. I would like it proved one way or another, without further ado. Can you restore Amycus Carrow or not, boy?”
Draco scoffed weakly. “You would never make a faux pas like that, Severus; not with my parents. I know you too well to be fooled by your bluffs.” Still, he took the stairs two at a time and rang the doorbell, and when he glanced back at Harry, his eyes were shining.
“I believe they had good intentions. They were going to bring him to his father. But it was not at all standard procedure, and they will be formally reprimanded,” Dumbledore agreed. “I have already received an owl from Minister Scrimgeour. He apologises sincerely for the oversight that led to such a tragedy.”
a confession. There was no guarantee he would succeed, and it would almost certainly lose him any chance of persuading Malfoy to trust him.
“It doesn’t make any sense because you were raised as a Muggle,” Draco said. “The Wild Magic is everything, everywhere. The world is full of it, Light and Dark, and it’s ancient and wild and untameable. It exists in every element – in the earth, in fire, in water, and the air. It can be tapped into through rituals, or complex incantations calling upon it to witness and uphold Vows or Bonds. It gives magic to certain species of animals, and to wizards. We don’t question that choice. What we
But Harry wasn’t indulging in a casual seduction. He was actively trying to convince Malfoy that he was in
“Not far now,” Draco breathed. He drew out Harry’s Invisibility Cloak, and threw it over their shoulders. Pansy cast
“I’m not innocent,” Draco said, his voice a rough rasp. “Merlin, Harry! How can you not understand that, after everything I did to you? People have gone to Azkaban for far less! You should have let the Minister put me on trial.”
The lines on Dumbledore’s face deepened, and he looked very sad. “Oh, my dear boy. I am truly sorry, but no. The law gives you a mere two heats to mate before the Ministry is within its rights to force you to choose a claim. An old law, of course, created by the ruling Alphas of the time to further their control over the precious commodity Omegas were. But the Ministry justifies its continued enforcement for your protection, and the good of the community, to prevent heat-frenzies.”
She held up the Marauder’s Map. “I could ask you the same question,” she said. “We went to the infirmary, but Madam Pomfrey said you’d left. And then you didn’t come back to Gryffindor, so we got worried and dug out your map. Ron’s keeping watch outside. He said he’d seen enough of Slytherin house to last him a lifetime.” She peered around him. “What
And that stupid, selfless Gryffindor had given him one, Draco thought. “Do you think we can fix this?” he asked, miserably.
Harry wailed, writhing and jerking wildly; up into his mouth, down into his hand, his hole fluttering madly around Draco’s tongue. Draco jerked him off; rough, quick strokes that had Harry screaming and coming, spurting into the sheets.
Harry sighed. It was a persistent rumour, and no doubt the reason Voldemort wanted the prophecy so badly.
Lucius pushed himself slowly backwards, towards the treeline. His muscles were twitching with the aftershocks of the curse, but the Dark Lord would be occupied with Potter for quite some time. If he could just find Draco again –
“Ah, yes,” Dumbledore said. “The Minister has agreed not to make Auror Rookwood’s disappearance public, for the time being.”
“So he uses people like pawns,” Draco said. “Isn’t that what you said? How do you know you’re not just another pawn?”
“It’s not your fault,” Harry said, twisting to sit up and take Draco into his arms. Draco clung to him fiercely, and Harry knew there was something his Alpha wasn’t telling him; something important. But he wasn't going to push right now. Everything felt too fragile, somehow; like they were on the edge of a precipice, one tiny shift of rock away from falling and shattering into a thousand pieces.
“Hestia, child,” Elphias said, very quietly, eyeing the closest Death Eater. He could see the tips of several confiscated wands poking out of his pocket. “See those wands?”
Trelawney’s smile widened. “I always did have a fondness for charms, but in the end, I could not deny my True Gift. When dear Albus
They both nodded. It had caused quite a stir at the start of the year. Donald Parkinson was the only Death Eater captured by Ministry Aurors over the summer who had agreed to talk, in return for the safety of his wife and daughter. His defection was public knowledge. What had happened afterwards was not.
Harry swallowed. He wanted to believe she was wrong. He wanted to believe he didn’t have as great a hold on Draco’s heart as she believed he did. But he knew exactly how Draco felt. Their bond was growing stronger every day. “I’m sorry,” he said. “You’re right. I’ll tell him. Just... not today, okay? He’s exhausted. I’ll tell him first thing tomorrow.”
Draco shrugged. “The full moon is in two weeks. Perhaps it doesn’t end until he sacrifices his intended victim.”
“Emergency beacon,” Draco explained, grimly. “Designed for only the most terrible of calamities. It records a message, and then sends it to every witch and wizard in the country, all at once. The Minister is supposed to keep it on his person at all times. He must have given it to her.”
Thanks to everyone for your comments and kudos! Just want to say I appreciate everyone who's stuck with it this long, and I hope you continue to enjoy as we approach the climax! xx
That made him pause, and the red haze cleared a little. Draco dying as an indirect result of his magic was not what he wanted. No, what he wanted was to kill Draco himself. Maybe with his hands around his throat.
A soul-bond, fated from birth. A prophecy, binding Potter and the Dark Lord together. A Horcrux clinging to Potter’s soul, which meant that he had to die in order for the Dark Lord to be defeated. Their Mage abilities, raw and untested; impossibly powerful, and impossibly dangerous. The Dark Lord, planning to use Potter’s power in the Dark Moon Ritual to take over the wizarding world. Her own Shakespearean plot, pitting Potter and Draco against each other in order to save Draco’s life… and in the process, allowing them to develop feelings for each other that could only end in disaster.
Hermione smiled at him brightly. “Good. Now, how is your exam preparation going? Are you keeping up with your new study plan? I tried to factor in the time you’re losing at the trial, and I think it
Harry let Draco manhandle him, twisting around to press their lips together, messy and not quite fitting together, but Draco licked into his mouth, running his tongue along the seam of Harry’s lips, and Harry melted, opening his mouth wide to welcome him in, something tense and painful easing inside him. He cried, a little, in relief, and Draco just kissed away the tears and came right back to his mouth, salty and wet and hot, twisting him up again in desperate need.
Harry stared at them all. “No,” he said, at last. “No. It’s my magic, and my choice whether to trust him or not. I gave him my word that I would protect him, and I won’t be able to live with myself if you make me break that. I
Harry scoffed at him. “As if I chose to fall in love with you. I was determined not to see you as anything but an evil git with a Death Eater for a father. And then when I overheard your conversation on the train with Pansy and Zabini, I was hell-bent on proving you’d been recruited for some kind of mission inside Hogwarts.”
He asked Professor McGonagall about it, the next time he saw her. She just smiled, and said, “Oh, you found it, did you?” and refused to say anything else.
Dumbledore looked up in surprise, as if he’d forgotten Harry was there. “Ah, Harry,” he said. “My dear boy. Your capacity for compassion has always astounded me. I have no doubt it will continue to do so, for as long as I live. Unfortunately, I do not think that will be for much longer.”
There were two Death Eaters standing guard outside his mother’s rooms. Draco raised his wand, but his three companions were faster, shooting off spells to stun and disarm. The Death Eaters fell so quickly and silently, they didn’t even have time to cry out.
Her stern gaze softened slightly, and Harry wondered what she saw; two boys clinging desperately to each other in a deserted hallway. “My office, five minutes. Both of you.”
The stag turned, charging at a group of Dementors swarming Seamus. Dean and Zacharias Smith darted in to grab him. Harry focused on getting McGongall in the air again, shielding them as they retreated. He saw Draco running towards them, pulling Luna along by her hand. She had horrible burns to her face. Daphne was already halfway across the lawn with Nott’s body.
Harry closed his eyes. He wanted to be disgusted. Revolted. He knew that, even a mere hour ago, the thought of being
Students turned and stared. Malfoy stiffened, and his two goons cracked their knuckles menacingly. “I thought I told you not to call me that,” he said coldly, his back to Harry.
“Here,” he said. It was a simple request. He asked, and the Wild Magic granted. Four lodestones, at perfect equidistance from each other around the room. It was heady, that power. Intoxicating. Outside, an army streamed over Hogwarts’ grounds, but in here, he could keep everyone safe, with just a thought. “Professor?”
, the door opened, one Harry hadn’t even noticed (or had forgotten, an eternity ago). Dumbledore entered, Snape hovering behind him awkwardly.
Harry turned his head slightly. Draco’s eyes were on his exam paper, quill scrawling industriously across the parchment, but his mouth was curved up on one side. Harry felt his encouraging nudge through the bond.
“I –” Harry looked guilty. “I didn’t think so? Not at the time, but we kind of – I know we weren’t supposed to, and I’m sorry, but it just kind of happened, last night, and – well, nothing happened. It was
Draco did one last, complicated twirl with his wand, and the images solidified. They picked up Harry and Draco’s toothbrushes, and promptly began scrubbing away at the floor.
He could hear their cheers, just faintly, through the vents. The battle had been lost. He knew it, but he refused to die. Not if there was any chance the Fiendfyre hadn’t reached the tenth floor yet. He couldn’t stop it; the Department of Mysteries was gone. But he could save the lives of dozens of innocent Ministry workers, if he could just
Draco looked sombre. “You forgave me, and still I thought you would never be able to love me again. But then you came to me, and kissed me, and I knew, against all odds, against
Pansy watched them go, worry creasing her brow. “They’re going to be trouble, Draco,” she murmured. “Sadie is not someone we should cross without being prepared for the consequences.”
“Exactly,” Draco agreed. “Harry and Severus are war heroes, now. It would be a lot of work, and would require a great deal of both political and financial backing, but I think if you’re really dedicated, really
He looked a little crestfallen, but rallied quickly. “He’s a rotten dancer, you know. Didn’t you see him at the Yule Ball? He was like a demented puppet with half its strings cut.”
“Oh, Hermione.” Harry sighed, hugging her closer. “Don’t you know you’re the glue that holds us together? Without you, our friendship would never have lasted. Not to mention we’d be dead, what – four times over by now?”
similarities,” Hermione argued. “It’s unintentional, it’s wandless, it’s far more powerful than Harry’s usual magic...” She paused, looking uncomfortable. “I just can’t see yet how his, er, physical state fits in.”
In the end, he just snuck in the two additional mock-orange sepals, and pretended not to know why their potion glimmered more than everyone else’s.
of subtle segues, mate.” Dean muttered something about spending too much time with certain Slytherins, and Seamus ignored him with the disdain that kind of comment deserved. “It’s going fine,” he said. “Apart from Zabini cruising my girl, too, of course.”
He slumped in his chains when it was over, his body jerking and twitching spasmodically. The cessation of pain was such a relief that he almost didn’t mind the loss of control over his own body.
Dumbledore stepped forward. “It’s over,” he said, voice raised enough to draw their attention without startling them. There was no twinkle in his blue eyes, and his hands were tucked into the sleeves of his robes. “You are all safe. What you all saw – what you fought – was nothing more than an illusion created by a curse designed to prey on your darkest fears. It was not real. The curse has been broken, and it’s over.” Several students fell to their knees, relief dawning on their faces. A few of the younger students began to sob. Most just looked shell-shocked. “Is anyone hurt?” Dumbledore asked. “Please raise your hands if you are. Madam Pomfrey will see to you as soon as she can.”
Draco looked up at him, smirking. His lips were swollen and red, and Harry’s limp, too-sensitive cock twitched at the sight. “Whoever said I was
Harry wanted to kiss him again, but they were being watched, and the murmurs of the other students were becoming intolerable. They had to move this to a more private venue before they went too far. Again. He stepped back and took Draco’s wrist again, enjoying the feeling of fragile bones under soft skin. “Will you –?”
The world spun backwards, and his father disappeared. Ron disappeared. People came and went, fighting and Disapparating in reverse. It was a familiar feeling, though he usually made sure he was alone when he did this. Even the desperation thrumming through him was familiar. But this time it wasn’t his life on the line. It was Harry’s.
“My mother knows you make me happy,” Draco said, firmly. “Right now, that’s the only thing that matters.”
“I’m taking them to the Room,” Harry said. He was holding Adeline’s hand. “I’ll be back in a minute, yeah?”
He shouted Fred’s name. He couldn’t hear himself. He scrabbled for his twin blindly. A hand met his, and he squeezed quickly in relief. He rolled up onto his knees. The barricade had been blown apart. Charlie was lying unconscious in the debris. Their mother stood over him, eyes bright with rage, shooting furiously back at the enemy through the gap.
. He put himself in mortal danger again and again, suffered more than you can possibly imagine, because it was the right thing to do. If Dumbledore manipulated you, whom he claimed to care for, how much worse do you think it was for Snape? He protected us both. He brought the Cloak back to us. He helped me put the wards up around the infirmary, and care for the patients, and fight in the final battle.”
Seamus looked irritated at being so effortlessly cut out, but he trotted at her other side dutifully, two heavy book-bags slung casually over one shoulder.
?” Dean asked. “I mean, I know you like her and all – you’ve been kind of obsessed with her all year, actually, but –”
Elphias hushed her again. It looked like Voldemort would be taking the majority of his men with him when he left, and soon. All of their wands had been confiscated, but he only needed one to save Arthur’s life. The man was pale and sweating, with the kind of stillness that Elphias recognised as too close to death. If he could just get his hands on a wand, he knew he could stop the bleeding. He had always rather fancied he might have been a good Healer, if his father hadn’t already mapped out his political career before he was out of leading strings.
on the Minister for Magic. You called his bluff. Threatened him! Do you even realise how powerful you could become? How powerful you already are?”
“Why the fuck is he even out there?” Harry demanded. “What, he wanted a butterbeer? What the fuck was he
“Is it?” Harry caught Malfoy’s restless hands in his own, leaning forward to press a gentle kiss against those pale, thin lips. Malfoy didn’t resist; instead, he shivered helplessly, mouth opening under Harry’s.“You’re so lovely,” Harry said, breathing gently against his lips.
A flash of red light. The Dark Lord’s wand ripped out of his hand. It spun through the air, too quick to see. For a moment, there was silence. Then, almost as one, the Death Eaters whirled in the direction the spell had come from.
“So,” Daphne said, as Trelawney crossed the room to talk to her pet Gryffindors, Lavender and Parvarti. “I notice Draco and Potter have become quite cosy recently.”
“Ah, the Room of Hidden Things,” Dumbledore said, peering through the door behind them. “Interesting choice.”
“Oh, very well,” Draco said, irritably. He settled in Harry’s arms, cuddling into him with an utter lack of shame. “Just for an hour, mind. It’s my birthday, and birthday sex is the bare
, she thought. It was over. They would be dead soon enough. She wondered where Harry was. More than anything, she hoped he survived this. But if he didn't, if this was how it ended... she hoped desperately that he wasn't alone.
watching him that closely; close enough to divine his favourite sweet out of all those his mother sent him, and have it ordered especially from Belgium. It made him warm, all the way from his toes to the tips of his ears.
“Sorry, mate,” Harry muttered, grabbing Draco’s hand. He made for the exit, towing Draco behind him.
George kept his shoulder pressed against Fred’s as he pulled out yet another trick. The Atrium was chaos. Spells were useless against the tornado, and it was
“But that’s not where this is going, mate,” Ron said, sympathetically. He was, for once, completely ignoring his breakfast in favour of returning the glares being sent in Harry’s direction. There was even a copy of the paper open in front of him, instead of a filled plate. Harry was half-inclined to borrow Colin’s camera and take a photo for posterity. “Primrose is already jumping on your testimony as evidence for her case. She’s going to argue that Justin’s attack on Malfoy was the opening salvo of the war, and it should be allowed, just like the Aurors were officially sanctioned to use Unforgivables during the first war. She’s going to convince everyone that there’s not enough evidence to show that Malfoy
,” Harry hissed, and his lover broke at last, lunging forward to fit his teeth around Harry’s pulse point and bite down, hard. It was so deep that Harry jerked in pain, but then the hormones took over, flooding through his body and turning pain into pleasure, pleasure into
could not be deflected or shielded against. The counter-spell required three twists of his wand. He managed it, but at the cost of letting the other two hit him. A line of fire opened up across his chest. He fell to one knee. How ironic, that it should be a spell invented by Severus Snape that ultimately killed him.
Harry shook his head helplessly. “It doesn’t matter. He only told me what I already knew. I won’t put you in more danger than I already have, Draco. I
Harry peeked through his fingers to see her colour, obviously pleased. “Oh! Of course. I’d be happy to.”
Harry made a face at him. “I got an E for Potions last year, thanks very much. And not because I was taking extra classes, either. Snape was trying to teach me Occlumency.”
Draco forced himself to shrug. “Fine. Potter believes I’m a victim. He wants to ‘save’ me. An opportunity like this… I would have to be a fool not to cultivate it. If the Dark Lord wishes to use my position to his advantage, I have Potter practically eating out of my hand. If not, I’ll end it as soon as he gives me the word.”
Voldemort chuckled to himself, gesturing at two Death Eaters to stand guard over the Headmaster. He turned to look over his preparations for the ritual. He had chosen a large clearing in the Forbidden Forest. It was technically centaur land, but Voldemort had ensured they wouldn’t be a problem. A simple promise to grant them to liberty to govern themselves once he was in power, and their leaders had leapt at the chance. In return, all they had to do was stay out of his way tonight.
“Healer Ong is very well respected among his peers,” Madam Pomfrey explained, for the rest of them. “He is considered one of the world’s leading experts on the Healing of magical pathways. He agrees with my assessment. There are both uni-directional and bi-directional pathways between your magical cores, the purpose of which I am afraid is as yet unclear. What
.” His breath shuddered out, and he pressed his fingers into his eyes, hard. “Tell me it’s some kind of elaborate, really sick
“I know,” she said, pulling out a Pensieve. She set it twirling in the air between them, and the blue water-mist of memories was reflected in her eyes as she looked at him over it. “Please, love. Your choices, here and now, will shape the future. Not only your own, but the whole
Draco smiled in sharp satisfaction, gripping that finger between his teeth. “So,” he said, softly. “Dumbledore’s pet really
Harry broke the news to Ron, Hermione and Seamus the next morning. It was impossible to get any privacy in Gryffindor before breakfast, so he waved them into an empty classroom on the way to the Great Hall.
Hermione frowned. She had been assisting the mediwitch where she could, so of course she’d already known about the correspondence with Healer Ong, and the conclusions they’d reached. There was nothing else. Was there?
. Umbridge’s wand ripped out of her hand, clattering across the floor. Charlie advanced on her, baring his teeth. Even if she had some wandless magic, he knew he could counter it easily enough.
Especially Harry. The war was a dark stain over all of their lives; their futures, their hopes and dreams. Sometimes Hermione wondered if Harry had any hopes or dreams, or if, in his mind, his future ended with his inevitable final confrontation with Voldemort.
Harry felt his jaw flex, but he managed to keep his expression bland until she turned away with a little frown. “Thanks,” he said, gratefully.
“He wants to pay you, though,” Granger said, after a moment. “He asked me to get the bill from you.”
“It’s an old tradition, Harry,” Ron explained, pushing his plate away. “Polyjuice, illusions, transfigurations – they all fade away after death. But it can take hours, sometimes days, before we know for sure. Until identity has been confirmed by two different Healers, we never,
“It’s okay,” Harry reassured him, taking his left hand. Draco tried to pull away, but Harry lifted his arm to his lips, placing a gentle kiss on the Dark Mark. It was a hideous stain on otherwise flawless skin, and Harry hated it. “Does it hurt?” he asked.
Snape sighed impatiently. “However. You have apologised, so a month’s worth it is. You will begin tomorrow with Mr Filch, at ten o’clock.”
, Draco thought, already barrelling forward. But it was too late. The door opened, and Death Eaters began pouring out of his mother’s room, one after another. Too many to fight.
“Passed down through your family for generations,” Dumbledore agreed. “The legend of the Deathly Hallows is attributed to three brothers of the Peverell family, who are thought to be ancestors of yours. Their purpose, as the tale goes, was to outwit death. To that end, the eldest created a wand powerful enough to defeat any foe. Unfortunately, he boasted to the wrong people, and was murdered for it in the night. The second created the Stone to bring back a lost love, but it was an echo of her, only. He went mad with grief and committed suicide to be with her. The youngest, however, was smarter than his brothers. He created an Invisibility Cloak, and lived a long and happy life out of Death’s sight. At the end of his life, he took off the Cloak, and greeted Death as an old friend.”
After lunch, Draco had his Ancient Runes exam, and Harry used the time to prepare a picnic for two. After Draco’s exam, they had the rest of the day to themselves, and he fully intended to put the time to good use. If he could convince Draco, that was.
“Draco, please,” Pansy begged. Unfortunately, the conclusions he was drawing were very close to being completely right, but in all the worst ways. “Of course I didn’t give him pointers on sex! That was all Potter.”
Dumbledore took his glasses off, pinching the bridge of his nose. “I know you believe that, my dear boy. But there are similarities enough to cause me grave concern. You should think long and hard about how you really feel, and whether it is enough to justify risking everything we’ve worked for. Because we are at war, Harry, and it is not just your life at stake. It is the whole world.”
After all, it wasn’t every day he had an absurd breakdown over killing a bird, outed his illicit relationship with Harry Potter to the entire student body of Hogwarts, Side-Along Apparated through Anti-Apparition wards, discovered potentially fatal cracks in his Occlumency shields, and then had the
Dumbledore nibbled on the toes of a peppermint toad meditatively. “I did not expect to live this long,” he said. “To be entirely truthful, my boy, I didn’t
– a loophole in the law we can exploit. What if – what if his true mate died – would he still be forced to –”
“No. But –” Harry shook his head helplessly, looking between his friends, his teachers. They all looked so serious. “I don’t – this is a joke, right? I’m a Beta, I don’t have a knot. I’ve
Hestia shot off a Stunner automatically. She couldn’t hear anything. She tripped over a body, and fell. A fractured slab of stone sliced through her knee. She cried out in pain, even as movement caught her eye. She looked up in time to see Voldemort’s ugly black statue morph into a dozen giant snakes of stone. They arced high up into the air, the ends forming dangerous thick spikes. Hestia rolled, not a moment too soon. The snakes slammed into the floor, one after another.
That was easier said than done, but after a couple of minutes, he at least felt calmer, his mental barriers stronger. He draped his Invisibility Cloak over Crabbe, and then hopped up on a nearby table to wait for Malfoy.
Ahead, two giants had just smashed through some kind of enormous rock wall. Debris rained down on rows of shining knights. The giants roared. The knights attacked.
“Well,” Harry said, “I appreciate it anyway. Watch your back, yeah? I didn’t like the way Filch was looking at you this afternoon.”
He didn’t struggle. He’d been through this before, in the graveyard. Wormtail was busy painting runes on his chest with a dark, sticky substance. Harry suspected it was blood. He couldn’t bring himself to look too closely at the girl dumped in a heap at the edge of the clearing. But on the other side of the clearing –
Dumbledore inclined his head. “I always believed you were meant to play a larger part in Voldemort’s demise than the presence of your Horcrux implied. But now Mr Malfoy has taken that option from you, and with it, any hope of returning from behind the veil.”
“Excellent,” Dumbledore smiled warmly, the twinkle back in his eyes. “Wonderful, Harry. I cannot tell you what a relief it is to have that settled.” He reached out and snagged a bowl of pale yellow sweets. “Lemon ice-bubble?”
“We have to get him out,” Harry said, digging his knuckles into his chest, wishing he could rid himself of the terrible, hard lump lodged there. “We
of your offer, as if committing treason against our lord could ever be an option. I knew what I had to do, after that. It was almost too easy, manipulating you both to this point.”
But Vince was already standing, stepping outside the concealing charm. Draco and Greg both lunged for him, but they were too late. “Father! Father, we’re here!”
Tears streamed down his face. Someone was pulling at his arm, but there was a heavy blanket of darkness closing in around him. He couldn’t have fought it if he’d tried. The wound was too raw, too fresh, the desolation overwhelming.
The day of the sixth years’ inter-house party dawned bright and clear. Sunshine streamed in through every window, not a single cloud breaking the enormous expanse of blue sky. At breakfast, Dumbledore announced that an army belonging to You-Know-Who had been sighted in the area. He had arranged for a special Hogwarts Express to Longon for those students who wanted to go home.
Daphne shook her head. “That remains to be seen. Draco believes in him wholeheartedly, and you know the majority turned because of the strength of his belief. But if he’s wrong – if he’s been blinded by love –”
“They need him alive,” Elphias assured her. But as fists began to pound into flesh, Scrimgeour’s grunts prompting laughter and catcalls from the other Death Eaters, it was cold comfort.
, Ronald,” she said. “You’re supposed to be a role model. They look up to you. It’s even more important to be responsible at times like this.” Speaking of which, she really ought to find a spell to reduce the alcoholic content of the punch –
“It’s her choice,” Hermione reminded them. “But I imagine she’s pretty miserable right now.” She looked at Harry, and he straightened guiltily. “Harry, I think you need to tell Ginny there’s no way anything can ever happen between you. And, actually,” she said, thoughtfully, “it might help if you tell her you’ve fallen in love with Malfoy.”
is, it’s Malfoy’s opinion that has to matter right now.” She turned to Seamus, sitting across from them with Dean and Neville. “Do you think Pansy would be willing to help us out? His likes and dislikes, that kind of thing?”
“I don’t know, Ron,” he said, helplessly. “It’s just me. You and Hermione, you’re the thinkers, not me. I’m not even a warrior. Just a weapon.”
“I haven’t, Harry, honestly. I just –” Draco looked at Pius, panicked, “just, maybe – what if it was the Horcrux? Your Horcrux? We were fine during your heat, remember, and then for a little while afterwards... but that Horcrux wanted to
When she smiled at Harry, his heart lurched. Ever since Draco had claimed him, Narcissa seemed to have decided that Harry was her second son, and he couldn't bear the idea of his heat changing the way she looked at him. The idea of that motherly love he tried so hard to pretend he didn't crave being twisted, perverted into lust and hormone-driven need... he couldn’t bear it.
against his over-heated, over-sensitive skin, and he closed his eyes, burrowing his forehead into the cool pillows.
“Harry, oh thank Merlin!” she gasped out. She didn’t take her eyes or her wand off Finch-Fletchley. “Help Malfoy!”
. It was joined by dozens of others, flashing out of the trees from all directions. At least half of the spells were aimed at Bellatrix, but they bounced off her shield. Still, two trees bent and twisted themselves together, barring her path. Bellatrix stumbled backwards in surprise. Pansy wondered if that had been McGonagall, anticipating Bellatrix’s shield.
Tears were running freely down Draco's face now. “I did mean it,” he whispered hoarsely. “I meant every word, Harry. I never lied to you. I just wanted what was best for you. I'm your
Pansy controlled her instinct to snap back at him. Instead, she raised a contemptuous eyebrow. “Of Draco? I think not.
He didn't like to think of how far it might have gone if Snape hadn't turned the corner at that moment.
Ron was fiercely loyal, brave and so unexpectedly wise at times that Harry sometimes forgot that he’d grown up a wizard in the wizarding world, listening to stories of the Boy Who Lived. If Hermione was here, she’d give him that disappointed look, snap “
“He’s not blocking me,” he said. Harry wasn’t angry with him, or even upset. He was grieving the fracture in their relationship, but that wasn’t stopping Draco from drawing from the earth. The shield Draco had slammed into place between them, on the other hand… “I’m blocking
Malfoy Manor was a stately country house, built in the Norman style in the early twelfth century. Major remodelling had been carried out throughout the years, which meant it was a rather charming hodgepodge of different styles; the single remaining Norman arch at the entrance to the gardens, the imposing Tudor fireplace in the formal sitting room, the Baroque façade with its classical stone columns and arched windows.
Ron choked. Hermione looked up from the three thick, dusty library books surrounding her, eyes wide. “She’s
His mother had thrown open all the curtains and aired out every room, twice. She was determined to rid the place of every last trace of the Dark Lord and his followers. She’d moved her apartments to the west wing, and transformed the room where Robards and Lupin had been imprisoned into a delightfully airy music room. She hired workers to fill in the dungeons, put fresh flowers on every surface, sold the aggressive white peacocks she’d always hated, and started redesigning the rose garden.
Robards looked incredulous. “That kind of accidental magic is unacceptable from someone your age, Potter. You are hereby banned from this courtroom until the end of the trial –”
“I also said we need to be as prepared as possible,” Draco reminded him. “Instinct won’t be enough to remove your Horcrux.”
“Ironic, isn’t it? But no, I don’t believe he did, when he made it his Horcrux. However, in his quest to discover a wand capable of defeating yours… yes, I believe he knows about them now.”
“I – I broke it,” Potter stammered, and Draco allowed himself to relax again. Inwardly, of course; he wasn’t going to ruin Potter’s little game by showing visible relief. “I’m sorry, sir. I wanted it to make a romantic evening for Draco, but I dropped it on the stairs, and it smashed.” He looked at McGonagall wretchedly. “I had my wand out – I tried – but I didn’t catch it in time. I’m so sorry, professor. I have the shards in my room, I’ll give them to you. I know it was the only one left. I should’ve been more careful. And I lied about it, too… I’m so
“Watch out!” Draco cried, spinning to the side. He slammed his hand down on a panel. With a screech of grinding stone, walls shot up around his team members, trapping them.
“That’s disgusting,” Ginny said, truly appalled. How could this be happening? How could she have misjudged his character so badly? “Why wouldn’t you just help her? Instead of
Pansy almost gasped aloud. She slipped into a nearby alcove, pressing herself up against the cool stone wall. Potter was moving away from her, no doubt making his way up to the Gryffindor dorms. Luckily, she had several eavesdropping spells in her arsenal for just such occasions.
“I don’t know, sir,” Hermione said, helplessly. “It all happened so fast, and he was mostly incoherent. He was crying. It was so horrible.”
He didn’t want to die like this; not with this terrible gulf separating him from the love of his life.
Draco closed his eyes. It made sense. His mother’s quarters were the most secure in the Manor. Sick and injured, without her wand, she had been no threat, and held very little value to the Dark Lord. Whereas a prisoner who could give him leverage against the Head Auror himself… It was no wonder her quarters had been under such close guard, even as she had been relegated to the dungeons.
Ginny, thinking Ron had done it, had slapped him and stormed off in a fury. She and Ron still weren’t speaking, and Zabini seemed positively delighted to be the cause of such a furore.
Harry looked around, and drew a small package out of his pocket. “Hermione shrunk it for me. Do you mind –?”
“At this point I’m about ready to lay siege to Slytherin,” Harry assured him. He wasn’t even entirely joking. “Any and all suggestions are welcome, believe me.”
“And you did it to her face, and you didn’t kick her while she was down,” Hermione continued, oblivious to his thoughts. “Even though, had the situation been reversed, she wouldn’t have hesitated. You were in the middle of a battle, and you were the one at a disadvantage. Justin, on the other hand, cast the Cruciatus Curse at Malfoy’s
Draco’s eyes were closed tightly, his mouth open, red and swollen and wet. “Come on,” he muttered. “Come
“Not at this gods-forsaken hour, I’m not,” Draco grumbled, trying to curl into him. “Why are you up? Come back to bed.”
Harry watched in surprise as Goyle cast a number of fairly advanced detection spells over the food, and then proceeded to taste every item on the plate before Malfoy ate. That was a degree of loyalty Harry had never suspected of Slytherins – even, or perhaps especially of Malfoy’s brutish bodyguards.
He didn’t miss the way her eyes flickered over to where Malfoy sat under the great beech tree with Harry, Ron and Hermione. “Blaise was getting a little too forward,” she said simply, turning her attention back to him. “I’m not in love with him.”
He rounded off a paragraph on the difficulties inherent in Transfiguring the human body, and set his quill down. Only the conclusion to go now, but he was far too tired, and far too preoccupied, to finish it this morning.
Harry took the seat opposite him, studying him with a frown. Dumbledore was well over a hundred years old, but apparently that meant very little for wizards. Even with the white hair and the long beard, Dumbledore had always had a glow of youthful vigour about him. Now, he looked frail and tired, his eyes rheumy, hands trembling as he straightened a sheaf of papers on his desk.
?” he managed, at last, choked with fury. “What the fuck, Draco! You made Madam Pomfrey keep me under, didn’t you? You have to stop doing this! They needed me; you can’t just make a unilateral decision to –”
“You removed that, too,” she said. “Well, in a way. Once I lost all my magic, the curse was done. The Healers think that when you ‘reset’ me back to the moment Ron spun the Time-Turner, you left the curse behind. Of course, I’d already lost some of my magic by then. But I’m still a witch, thanks to you.”
their one-night stand together. Who cares when you fell for Malfoy? Surely what’s important is that it’s true now.”
“He’s going to be fine,” he said, mostly for himself, but also for Pansy and Narcissa, who looked wretched. “I promise. He’s safe now.” The bond was strengthening with each passing moment. He wanted desperately to keep touching Draco, to feel his heartbeat, the blooming of warmth in his cheeks. But he was also miserably certain that his ex-lover would see it as a violation when he woke. “I need to go,” he said reluctantly, pushing himself to a sitting position.
by Portimus Dunn. It was a huge, dusty old book, and Harry watched her affectionately, thinking that he really was fortunate to have such loyal friends. If anyone could figure out what was going on, Hermione would. She wouldn’t stop looking until she had an answer. It was that persistence Harry thought would win them the war, not a vague prophecy about the ‘power of love’.
She didn’t let go of the child until Madam Pomfrey had Fire-called Gregory Biddle, and the man came stumbling through the Floo, dark circles under his eyes and his clothes hanging off him. He started crying when he saw his daughter.
Harry swallowed. Permission – even an order – to speak, but how in Merlin’s name was he supposed to apologise for something like this? “I know,” he said tentatively. “I know, but Draco, I should have been ready for you. You shouldn't have to worry about that. I'm yours, and I was disrespectful, and you should have been able to reassert your claim. It’s your
Draco frowned. “But… I don’t understand. How did you get it here? You can’t have had it with you in the dungeons when they rescued you.”
suspicious that Draco has other motives for letting Potter court him… he’ll kill Narcissa. And it’s all my fault. His mother – oh Merlin, his
WAND!” the Dark Lord screamed. Pansy felt the wand in her pocket tremble, and then still. “FOOLS!” he roared, red with rage. “Don’t just stand there! FIND IT!” His Death Eaters scrambled to obey. Mulciber began to rise, and the Dark Lord seized him by the ear, flinging him back to his knees beside Potter. “Not you, imbecile! Finish it! FINISH HIM!”
“But you didn’t hurt them, either. You didn’t even hurt Rookwood. You just sent him away. And you made me the eye of your storm, so that not even a drop of rain touched me. You’re not dangerous, Harry. Madam Pomfrey was right. Your capacity for love is incredible. It’s just not in you to hurt anyone.” He paused, grief and regret roughening his voice. “Not like me.”
Draco sighed. “Restrain your pyromania, please. Only Ministry-approved spells for now. And for Salazar’s sake don’t hurt them. We must have clean hands when the Aurors arrive.”
a child –” with a brief glance at Miss Granger, “I can only conclude that, yes, it had significant parallels to Harry’s unfortunate episodes, though I was not in the least aroused at the time.” He shrugged. “On the other hand...”
“I want to know everything about you,” Harry said, and he realised he wasn’t lying. The rage was gone, as if it had never existed.
“Did something happen?” He looked around. “Where’s Ron? He’s not throwing up in the bathroom again, is he?”
Ron sighed, dropping his forehead to Harry’s. Harry closed his eyes. “She’s holding on, but I think she’s getting worse.”
“I know it doesn't sound good, mate, but it doesn’t have to be bad,” Ron said, very earnestly. Trying in his own way, Harry thought, to comfort him. “I swear, you’re like a sex god now. You’ll have everything you want, everything you need. Everyone will want you, but you’ll be safe, protected and cared for by your Alpha –”
Hermione nodded, and reached out to touch Harry’s hand. He tried not to flinch, but her eyes filled with tears again, and he knew he hadn’t succeeded.
The tail came back around. Pansy shrieked, digging her heels in as she tried to reverse direction. She fell. The forest exploded. She curled up into a ball, hands over her head.
“No,” Draco said, and Harry flinched, curling in on himself. “No,” Draco said again, “stop it, Harry. You’re mine.
“Malfoy?” he murmured, running a hand tentatively over the white-blond hair. It was soaked with blood, a deep, ugly gash running from his forehead around his ear to the nape of his neck. His face was as pale as death, and he looked strangely twisted; taut and strained with pain, even unconscious. His body twitched convulsively – the unmistakeable after-shocks of the Cruciatus Curse.
Alastor had jerked to his feet before he realised it wasn’t another attack. Instead, a picture swirled into being in the middle of the room. Harry Potter, a smear of blood on his face. His green eyes burned brightly behind his glasses.
Harry rose to his hands and knees above him. Draco was sprawled on his back, naked and flushed, his white-blond hair a halo around his head. He looked stunning. “I love you,” Harry said, honestly. “I love everything about you. Your wit, your beauty, your courage, your heart. And I will spend the rest of my life endeavouring to please you, if you let me.”
She settled opposite him, folding her legs beneath her, tossing her wand aside and taking his hands in hers. “What’s wrong, love?”
all that, not because of it. We’re meant to be together, and it has nothing to do with Voldemort or the prophecy. Our destiny is
Harry stopped by the infirmary that night to visit Malfoy, and was sent summarily on his way by an unusually irate Madam Pomfrey, snapping about
stable, at least for now, which is the only reason I have allowed you in here. Professor Snape is retrieving some potions from his store. If you want to stay, I need you to take his place.”
Classes resumed as normal. It was study week, and Professors McGonagall, Sprout, Vector and Babbling each took turns filling in for Snape and Flitwick. By Friday morning Professor Flitwick had returned to the Charms classroom. His hands trembled, and he took frequent breaks at his desk, but Madam Pomfrey had released him for light duties and seemed pleased with his progress.
“Then we’ve delivered Potter right into the lion’s den,” Moody muttered. “Dammit to the seven hells and back, Albus! I
“Half the stuff in this castle belongs in a museum,” Seamus agreed. He waved a hand between the mirrors, and was astonished to see his hand reflected in the tapestry as well as the actual mirror. “Brilliant,” he breathed.
Flitwick led the way down to the very front, pushing through the crowd to a small space on the front row, opposite the panel of judges. Next to them was a man with curly brown hair and blue eyes. Justin’s father, Harry surmised. Their escorts took up places at either end, and Harry looked up at the panel again.
“I take it there were no hard feelings about the break-up, if you’re speaking as a character witness for the defendant? You volunteered, in fact. You weren’t even invited.”
Harry just waved him off absently. He thought he understood the gist of the play now. Or at least, he’d identified the major characters and their motivations. Anything more complex than that, Hermione would have to explain to him.
“Not protocol,” Ron told him. “People can escape pretty easily in the Floo network. But Justin’s not exactly a hardened criminal. Looks like they’re regretting it, now.”
Draco chuckled, relaxing, but then Harry was pushing up to his hands and knees, rocking back insistently.
. If I thought you really couldn’t ever love me again. I was going to wait until the war ended, until we killed him, but then afterwards - your heat – I couldn’t, I wouldn’t
Madam Pomfrey looked a little taken aback by his reaction. “All right, Potter,” she said, patting his shoulder awkwardly. “Eat up, and give me another smile.”
“Harry,” Hermione said, one afternoon, and he jerked his head up to look at her. “You’ve been staring at that page for over an hour.”
Potter gave him a self-deprecating smile. “The first one, of course not. This one –” He paused, shrugging. “Maybe. I had a chance to end it in first year, and again in fourth. And – and last year. I wasn’t strong enough.” He sighed. “I know, it sounds stupid.”
Malfoy paused, shook his head. His eyes cleared slightly, and he frowned. “You’re right. I’m surprised any of the others could even think in here, much less walk out on their own two feet. Your pheromones are
Still, she couldn’t feel completely comfortable. Not alone, with the most lecherous Slytherin in the school as her sole companion.
“Oh,” Harry said. He could see why that might make it difficult for a bodyguard to do his job. In fact, with Draco constantly in two places at once, disappearing and reappearing at unexpected times… Yeah, Harry thought contritely, he could see how that might be a bit hellish. Not to mention, probably the reason for the Disillusionment Charm. If Crabbe and Goyle were having trouble keeping up with Draco, then keeping track of their Polyjuice counterparts would be surely near impossible. “I’m sorry. I didn’t realise,” he apologised. “I was just trying to help.”
“No,” Harry said, as if he could read his mind. His eyes were closed, head flung back, and Draco desperately wanted to lick up the line of his throat. “I’m going to see this through. I’m going to ride you, and I’m
Harry couldn’t see what was going on. It was tightly-packed around the window, students pushing for a better view, a group of stupid, over-excited third year boys shouting “Fight! Fight!” from the back, and a few adults trying desperately (and uselessly) to disperse them all. Two tiny girls who looked like first years were curled up against a wall, bruised and bloody, their arms over their heads as the crowd surged and roiled around them.
Draco tickled the dragon under its chin. “I’m sure it is,” he said, glancing up at Harry. The affection in his tone made Harry flush. “But it’s right. You’re right. Jeremiah never actually met any White Mages. He had to extrapolate from historical anecdotes, hearsay and rumours. Most of his book is probably rubbish.”
“Along with several different restorative draughts, Girding Potion, Wit-Sharpening Potion, and Pepper Up,” Pansy continued. “Why in Morgana’s name do you need Pepper Up, Draco? Are you sick?”
Ginny sighed. “I was. I am. And I guess I played my part in convincing him to go along with it, so I can hardly complain. It’s just... he was supposed to convince Malfoy he was in love with him. No one said anything about
going on.” He yawned, and suddenly Pansy was looking significantly blurrier. “Sorry,” he said, realising his eyes were closing involuntarily. The half-life of the Invigoration Draught was decreasing at a worryingly rapid rate, the longer he used it. Just twelve minutes, now, even after the adrenaline of the fright Pansy had just given him. “The potion’s wearing off. Do you want –?”
He tried some rudimentary healing spells, but he was painfully aware how inadequate they were. There was no spell that could restore a heart to the human body.
Even with everyone available lending their magic to the wards, Ron suspected they wouldn’t last the day. McGonagall and three Aurors were laying down runes in jagged rows across the lawn, preparing for a full-frontal assault. On the stone bridge, rows upon rows of armoured knights stood waiting to defend the school. Their polished metal gleamed in the sunlight.
A circle of Death Eaters surrounded the table. Harry recognised most of them; the inner circle, or what was left of it. Rodolphus Lestrange. Rookwood. Mulciber. Crabbe Senior. Cardosa. A few others. Pettigrew melted back into the darkness. Clearly he wasn’t one of Voldemort’s favoured few.
Pansy could just see her, back by the broken front gates. The vast bulk of the army was still arrayed behind her, but her frontline troops were in chaos, lost in the smoke, trying to fall back, some succeeding, others getting turned around and going the wrong way. The black ice was a stroke of brilliance. They were screaming, feet slipping out from under them, sending them careening into the second and third row of runes.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Harry said. “Why would a love potion stick when even the Imperius Curse can’t?” Malfoy’s eyes narrowed, and Harry gestured towards the food on the nearby table. It was under a warming charm, thank Merlin, or it would have been stone cold by now. “Just eat, okay? Chicken and ham pie. It’s good, I promise. I’m going to bed. See you tomorrow?”
Harry realised most of the other students were already gone. There were a couple of stragglers snagging the last pieces of toast on their way out, and Neville came in at a dead run, skidding past the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables to grab half a sausage from the skeletal remains of the Gryffindor breakfast table. He paused when he saw them.
“No,” Dumbledore said. “I still intend to offer him a way out. But only once he has exposed himself in the act of completing his task.”
“Pansy reckons he won’t,” Seamus said, leaning forward earnestly. “Not if you make it real. A proper courtship, like in the play. Maybe he’s thought about defection before, but she reckons he hasn’t – not seriously, anyway. He can’t. There’s no one he can trust to protect his mother. But if you convince him you’re really,
“Cast a Feather-weight Charm,” Tonks insisted, in a harsh whisper. “You’re not doing us any good by punishing yourself, Cousin.”
“No,” Hermione said. “The only one who went further than the immediate area outside the Room of Requirement was Gibbon, and he didn’t go after any students. Unfortunately… pretty much everyone still standing at the end got caught by Carrow’s Scorched Earth Curse. It can’t kill people, but it knocked everyone out in range of the spell. Which was small, fortunately, because Carrow cast it wandlessly, and he’s not very powerful. But Madam Pomfrey says it doesn’t just knock people unconscious, it
” Harry flinched, trying to draw back, and Draco glared at him. “Don’t be stupid, Potter. I didn’t mean you.”
“No,” Harry said weakly, but he could feel it beginning, that first, wet trickle down the inside of his thighs, that desperate need to offer his neck for his Alpha's claim. “
“All right. But don’t say I didn’t warn you.” Draco reached over for one of the pastries, and tore off a small piece to feed to Harry. “Snape found his Alpha at a very young age. Their preliminary bond formed long before their bodies were ready to consummate it, and they grew up loving each other like brother and sister. She was older than him, and there was a war brewing, and she formed an attachment to someone else; a Beta. Not a bond, but I suppose it was love enough. Severus was devastated, lost. Easy pickings for my father and the other Death Eaters. By the time he turned sixteen and his body went into heat, it was too late. His Alpha rejected him, and my father took him in. Hid him from the Dark Lord while he mourned, fucked him through his heats until Severus came up with his suppressant. But then he made a deal with the devil.”
real was Pansy’s hand in his, his heart beating double-time as they walked down to the dungeons together. After weeks of uncertainty and doubt, Pansy had
“Harry,” Dumbledore said, and all eyes turned to him. “I believe what you felt was your connection to Voldemort.”
the last one in existence. We have agreed that a month’s worth of Saturday detentions is perhaps too lenient a punishment.”
Harry stopped, and tugged Draco around to face him. They were close enough to the Quidditch pitch to hear the roaring of the crowd as someone scored a goal, but he didn’t care. “I’ve already told you more than I’ve ever told Ron and Hermione,” he said. “Not about the prophecy and the war, and all that. But about me.”
It wasn’t fine, even Harry could see that. But Scrimgeour was shouting for order, and the courtroom quietened. He was forced to squeeze Draco’s hand in apology and hope it would be enough.
“I didn’t know that,” Draco admitted. His eyes were sharp. “Is that how you know you’ll succeed? The prophecy foretells your victory?”
“Read up on age-related charms and hexes,” Pansy advised her. “Like the age barrier Dumbledore used on the Tri-Wizard Goblet.”
“No,” Harry sighed. “She always knew it was a risk. So did I. I wish we hadn’t taken it. I wish none of this had ever happened. I wish I’d never agreed to her
Dumbledore nodded. “Of course. I give you my word, Harry. It is the very least I can do. Draco Malfoy will be safe and provided for after you’re gone, for the rest of his days.”
“You should be in the infirmary,” she said reproachfully, but drew her wand when Harry shook his head.
happy. So if you want to be an Auror, I’ll support you. I think you’d be the first Omega ever, but then, the Ministry needs a good shaking up. I’d take them on with you, if you wanted. After all, they won’t have a leg to stand on if they try the ‘precious Omegas need taking care of’ card. You took
!” as they ran towards her. She stirred, too slow. Harry almost skidded in the mud next to her, pulling her up before she was properly awake. “Let’s go, let’s go!”
He lay enjoying the afterglow for a few minutes, wriggling a little just to feel Draco inside him, and then moaning in loss as he slid out. Draco rolled off him, stretching lazily. “Don’t worry, Potter,” he said, reaching out to pet Harry’s hair idly. “I haven’t knotted you yet. I’ll be able to fuck you again in a minute.”
But Blaise wasn’t finished. “Worried about losing the littlest Weasley to a Slytherin’s corrupting influence, Potter?” he said, a bite to his tone that Draco didn’t fully understand. After all, wasn’t Harry courting a Slytherin this very moment?
She was almost ethereal in her flawless, frail beauty; as pale and perfect as a china doll. Her white-blonde hair was done up with a beautiful gold pin, her slender form draped with the palest of blue robes embroidered with white and silver stitching, and a faux fur cloak in white hugged her shoulders.
She’d given into grief and despair; the hopeless entanglement of a situation beyond even her ability to Slytherin an escape from. But if there was a way to get Draco out of this, any way at all –
“That’s enough,” Hermione said, sharply. “Harry, honey? It might help, that’s all I’m saying. Just think about it, okay?” Her voice was gentle, and he nodded mutely. “As for you, Dean, if you’re still serious about Ginny, try and win her back without treating her like some kind of pet you own, or going nuts on her every time she so much as looks at another guy. All right?”
“Of course!” Hermione said. “That would explain your reaction to their deaths, Malfoy. Earth Magic is not just in the earth, after all. It’s in everything that grows out of it and nests in it; the trees, the animals, the birds. If you really are an Earth Mage, the death of any animal you felt attached to or responsible for in some way, could theoretically take a terrible toll on you.”
Draco sighed and let his forehead rest against Potter’s. “You don’t have to apologise. I’m not getting anywhere on it, anyway.”
Lifting his arm gently from around Draco’s waist, he slipped out of bed. His clothes were in a pile on the floor, and he pulled them on carelessly, shoving his robes under his arm.
Hermione smiled at them, far too fondly in Harry’s opinion. “Take your time. We’re – we're really happy for you both, you know?”
“Harry!” he cried, stumbling forward. Harry was huddled in the opposite corner of the alcove, arms over his head. Draco went to touch his shoulder, but Harry shouted and flinched away. Draco snatched his hand back. “Harry,
Harry struggled to open his eyes just as Draco pinched his nipple again, and then bent his head and lapped at it, saliva-wet and
Draco sighed. “Guilty. Still, there’s teaching, or Healing, or politics, just to name a few. And you could make an enormous difference in any of those fields, not just through the work you do, but by being an
Draco had told him to hurry back after his check-up with Madam Pomfrey. Harry knew he’d still be there, waiting for him.
It worked. It always worked. Because Draco was frightened of losing Harry, but the idea of Draco dying first terrified the hell out of both of them.
He was nervous, despite Kingsley Shacklebolt’s assurances that the wizarding public were firmly in their corner, now. He’d even provided them with an Auror escort; Mad-Eye Moody and Dawlish.
,” he sighed again, as Potter’s eyes lit up and he felt his traitorous cock begin to stir. “Don’t you ever give up?” he said, and was surprised at the flash of hurt in Potter’s eyes.
“Not until my Alpha gives me up,” Harry countered, breathlessly. The hand in his hair, pulling just a little, just enough to
But it was half-eleven, and even the prefects were turning in now. All except Hermione, who was studiously gathering the empty mugs from their hot cocoas onto five large trays. Less work for the house-elves, Ron surmised, watching her.
The stocky siblings were helping Rowle and Yaxley to their feet. Behind them, a final Death Eater was climbing out of the cabinet, wand clenched between his teeth. Greyback changed back into his human form; a tall figure with matted grey hair and filthy, clawed hands, one of which grasped his wand awkwardly as he removed the thorns. His teeth were bared in a dangerous snarl. His yellow eyes never left Draco.
Draco looked shamefaced. “That I could choose what emotions I wanted you to feel from me. It was when we were all sent home, last year. You were so upset about going back to the Dursleys, I didn’t want to burden you with
Draco stooped as they ran, snatching a small rock up from the ground. A moment of concentration, and the ward snapped from their wands to the stone, forming a bubble around them. He thrust it at Pansy. “Keep going!” he said. “I’m going to help!”
Harry was only vaguely aware of the polite goodbyes and thank-yous after that, and then a floating sensation before he settled into something soft and comfortable. He rolled towards Draco instinctively, and Draco’s arms pulled him closer, snuggling him against that strong, warm chest.
Draco sighed. “You know better than that. Harry’s not just a half-blood from the wrong House. He’s a
would be the one allowed to punish him. It was just a pity Malfoy wasn’t joining them; Argus had some lovely punishments especially designed to inflict the maximum emotional and physical agony on star-crossed lovers.
Panicked, he tried to spin away, only to come face-to-face with Terry Boot. Terry’s pupils were blown wide just like Hermione’s, and as Harry stood, dazed, gaze wandering back to Malfoy despite the clear and present danger in front of him, he touched a fingertip to Harry’s lips.
“Oh, really?” she said, brightening. “Oh, Harry, that’s a wonderful idea. I’m afraid people are rather losing interest in common household pests like gerblins when they’re so frightened of Voldemort. It would be good to give them some hope.”
, and for a moment, he was baffled. It was like trying to look through a window, and seeing nothing but his reflection.
, even when it was perfectly clear that Draco was just a scared teenager in an impossible situation, forced to do a madman’s bidding or die at the teeth of a bloodthirsty werewolf.
Harry just wanted to go back to Draco’s room and sleep, safe in his lover’s arms. It would probably be his last opportunity. It felt like the world was crashing down around them. But Dumbledore told them in no uncertain terms that every student must be in their own bed tonight, and he had caught Harry’s eyes very pointedly. The Heads of Houses, he’d said, would be checking in on them at midnight, to make sure each of them was accounted for.
“Some of the parents are taking their – the kids who were injured,” Dean said. “Madam Pomfrey advised against it, but she’s pretty overwhelmed as it is, and Marietta Edgecombe’s great-aunt offered to open her place to them all. She was an emergency Healer, before she retired. Uh… some of the Slytherins, of course. Joining their parents for the fight, I guess. And a lot of the younger years. Finally realised what they’d be getting themselves into, by staying. That, or their parents insisted.”
“I am glad to hear it,” Pius said, looking relieved, and Harry was inexplicably pleased that the only other Omega he knew had someone who cared for him that much. Apart from, apparently, the Malfoys. “Naturally, I assumed he meant himself when his owl mentioned an Omega, but now I see I was wrong.” The elderly wizard turned to Harry suddenly, eyes boring into him as if he was stripping him down to his very soul. “Harry Potter.”
“I’m inclined to agree with you, sir,” Draco said soothingly, taking pity on him. “But trying to repel his advances was counter-productive. Allowing him to court me seemed the best way to learn his intentions.”
“She is viewed by the other characters as ill-tempered and undesirable, and yet she has many admirable qualities. She is a fiercely independent woman – highly intelligent, with a sharp wit and a quick tongue. She is jealous of the way her father favours her sister Bianca, and yet she refuses to submit to societal expectations of her role as obedient daughter or wife, even though the only way to find peace or happiness within the confines of her society is to do just that. It is not difficult, then, to imagine that Katherina’s foul temper stems from the fact that she is desperately unhappy; trapped, with no means of escape. And so she lashes out, becoming still more alienated by the society that she must fit into. Thus her anger grows, a vicious cycle she cannot break alone.”
Thanks to everyone for your comments and kudos!! This may or may not be the one you've all been waiting for ;)
Potter smiled. “I’m glad,” he said, and he at least sounded sincere. Which was the problem, Draco thought. He was just
Harry’s blush deepened, and Draco chuckled. He didn’t think he’d ever grow tired of how endearingly embarrassed Harry got over the most simple things.
Harry met the stormy-grey eyes, feeling that tug low in his belly. The desire to obey, to be good, to please his Alpha. But Draco hadn’t forbidden him to ask, so he ignored the feeling and said, “I do, Draco. Please. Snape’s the only other Omega I know. I need to know what happened to him.”
They were staying temporarily in one of the quarters set aside for visiting professors; a bending of the rules granted by their new Headmistress, McGonagall. The law prevented a mated Alpha and Omega pair from being separated, and McGonagall had decided it would be improper to put them up, together, in one of their old Houses.
Thanks to everyone for your comments and kudos! Warning for canon-typical torture in this chapter (i.e. the cruciatus curse).
Harry had never seen him so embarrassed, and suddenly he was furious. He whirled on Slughorn, raising his wand. How
He could see it in Pansy’s eyes, when he joined them later that evening. She was almost beside herself with worry, and it made a nameless dread rise up in his throat, tightening his chest until he could barely breathe.
Harry reflected that, really, their relationship was doing wonders for the both of them. But thoughts like that inevitably led to thoughts of his own relationship with Draco, and he shut it down quickly. All he’d done this past week was tear himself up inside with guilt and pain and regret, and he was fucking sick of it.
“Pretty well,” Harry said, fighting a blush. Bloody hell, that was just what he needed; the newspapers insinuating
Malfoy glowered at him, using his wand to cast a number of quick grooming spells to smooth down his rumpled robes and that beautiful hair – and, yes, to ease himself of a rather prominent erection. Harry stifled his smile, shielding him instinctively from any passers-by. Somehow he knew that Malfoy might forgive him for messing up that carefully-cultivated image, but exposing the intimate results to the public eye? Never.
Filch glowered at him. “What’s it to you, boy? Snape set your detention, so that’s what you’ll do. He said you’d know what the plants look like, and if you
Pansy looked at Potter, and then up at the dragon. That great head, bowed under the weight of an anguish she knew all too well. “I'll go,” she decided, “but I'm taking Harry Potter with me.”
Someone barrelled into Snape’s back. A diminutive spitfire with dark hair and flashing eyes. Draco’s heart soared.
“Yeah,” Ron said, puzzled. “We knew that already. You know, from back in first year when we looked him up? He’s an Alchemist.”
Tonks was silent for a long moment. “Maybe we’ll come across wherever he’s being held on our way, then,” she said, bracingly.
Pansy ignored their posturing with the ease of long practice. “I have a request,” she began, with no preamble.
Draco shrugged. “Jeremiah was considered somewhat eccentric, admittedly. Still, I believe he had a point. Merlin was the most powerful wizard of his time; powerful and benevolent. And yet he struggled his entire life with the peoples’ fear of his great power. I believe that’s why Jeremiah named us White Mages. His attempt to counter that unmerited reputation.”
Harry blinked, temporarily distracted. “I’m not sure you can call that love,” he said, sceptically. “Not when you were insulting me and my friends, casting slurs on the memory of my parents, selling stories about me to the wizarding press, dressing up as a Dementor to make me throw one of the biggest games of the year –” He broke off with a strangled gasp as his Alpha pushed inside him, clutching at Draco’s shoulders.
He took a deep breath, wondering if he actually wanted to do this. But he’d never backed down from a fight before, and he didn’t even really remember what he was fighting. He needed to know.
Harry frowned. “But I thought accidental magic came from inside us. Like Neville. He says his great-uncle dropped him out of a two-storey window, and that’s when they knew he was a wizard, because he bounced.”
It wasn’t the screams that had woken him, though. His scar was burning, worse than it ever had before. It was so bad that it almost completely overwhelmed the pain from his wounds or his seizing muscles, courtesy of the Cruciatus Curse.
Far from it, she thought. It was perhaps easier to believe that Ginny didn’t know (or understand, perhaps, because Ron had certainly told them all about the bars across Harry’s window, and no one could miss the way his clothes hung on him at the end of each summer holiday) anything about Harry’s childhood, or lack thereof. But anyone with any sense ought to be able to see that Harry had lost his innocence a very long time ago. There was an old soul behind those guarded green eyes.
Voldemort himself stood at the head of the circle. Harry felt paralysed with fear. He wished he’d asked Draco more about what the ritual involved. He was terrified he wouldn’t have the strength to do what he needed to do before the end.
Harry shrieked, scrambling backwards. The dragon was thrashing, roaring fire. Tapestries caught alight. Harry rolled behind a statue of a goblin. He pressed his back to the statue, then peeked out over the top. The dragon almost took his head off.
Harry cut him off with a sharp gesture. “You defected. You saved me, and Tonks. But none of that would have mattered to the Wizengamot, or people like Rookwood. All they’d see is your Dark Mark, and you’d be a target for every single guard and visitor to Azkaban with a grudge against Death Eaters.”
And then his Alpha wrenched himself away, looking down at him hungrily. “I’m going to fuck you now,” he said, “and you’re going to come on my knot.”
“You go get her,” Weasley decided. “You shouldn’t be fighting. There wasn’t enough Felix Felicis for you.” He looked anxious. “Actually, maybe I should come with you, just in case.”
Harry scrubbed his hands over his face. “But then Draco was right. You really were begging Snape to kill you. So how were you going to save him?”
She struggled to rise, but even with Harry’s help, she couldn’t. Her eyes slid past him. “Pomo –” she tried to say, choking on her own blood. Harry swivelled on one knee. Professor Sprout was down. “Go!”
Daphne took his arm, turning her back on Blaise. Her eyes were bright, flinty with triumph and determination. “Let’s go.”
“The Death Eater at the Ministry,” Draco said. “He has a daughter here. A first-year. Half-blood. I didn’t know he was a Death Eater until yesterday; the Cardosa family have a long pureblood pedigree, but the last several generations have married half-bloods and Muggleborns. They were neutral during the last war.”
?” Hermione said, hand over her mouth. Even in the encroaching darkness, Harry could see the tears starting to her eyes. “Oh, Harry. Oh Morgana,
“Oh.” So it was one of those things he didn’t know because he hadn’t grown up in the wizarding world. Then again, with Luna, one never really knew. “So, uh, tomorrow evening?”
He could have been happy with what little he was allowed to have, though. The Infinity Mirror had shown him that. Little flashes of happiness, of
Draco fought the urge to jerk around to see Blaise’s reaction to that. Damn it, so much for his alpha display the first time Potter had visited Slytherin!
“Fernando Cardosa,” a vaguely familiar voice said. Foul breath wafted over his face. “You have some explaining to do, boy.”
wizards and three days to complete. How do you propose to do it in a few minutes, with only Severus to help?”
Harry sighed in relief, and let himself lean on Draco when the other boy wrapped an arm around his waist.
Draco smiled at him. “No,” he said. “You changed both our lives. You acted on feelings you had no idea I would ever return. Granted, at Pansy’s behest, but you can’t possibly understand how much that means to me.”
Harry laughed. “Likewise,” he said, and then had to catch himself as he leaned in for a kiss. “Fuck,” he said, raking his hands through his hair in frustration. “I don’t think I can do this.”
Draco snorted. “You have never been a good, obedient little Omega. You were still trying to challenge me in the middle of your first
Draco skidded down a hallway, catching himself on a corner and flinging himself around it. He had minutes, maybe less, and he raced to follow the tug of magic that would lead him to Harry. He could feel it now; the connection that had always been there. All it had taken was acceptance of who he was. Who they were, together.
“Shh, it’s okay,” Harry soothed him. He stroked Draco’s back gently, remembering how uncomfortable he’d been when Draco had cried in his arms after their Hogsmeade date. What a difference a couple of weeks had made. He
“I’m sorry,” Harry whispered, as they slipped into the kitchen. The house-elves were always in their own quarters by this time of night, and Draco had no fear there would be one lurking about to take them unawares. Malfoy elves were far better trained than that.
After a week’s worth of evening detentions with Professor McGonagall, Harry was unenthusiastic, to say the least, at the thought of his Saturday detention with Filch. His homework was mounting rapidly, and Hermione was hounding him about falling behind with his study plan. He’d been given some extensions on his coursework, but what with the trial, and Draco, and the constant detentions...
If Potter could be prevailed upon to approach Draco, offer him protection, he might be the only person Draco could ever consider such an offer from. And if Potter
“Most people would be wrong,” Seamus said. “He kept Bellatrix busy for who knows how long, during the Invasion. He probably saved all our lives. Even if he never recovers – even if he jumps at shadows for the rest of his life – he’ll always be a hero, and
“No,” Ron said, and Hermione glanced at him in surprise. “Not now. You’re going to wear yourself out like this.”
“I’m in love with her,” Seamus declared. Dean gave him an narrow look, and he sighed. “Yeah, yeah, I know. She’s a Slytherin. A Death Eater. She admitted it, right to my face. I shouldn’t trust her. Just because I slept with her that one time, it shouldn’t mean so much. But it
“I am asking you not to,” Dumbledore said. “When the time comes, I will offer him a choice. Until that day, it would be better for everyone if you were to keep your distance from him.”
Harry shivered and wrapped his arms around his stomach. He could still feel the touch of Cardosa’s wand against his injured back. Taste the salty tears that ran down the back of his mouth and nose as Draco held him under for what seemed like eternity.
They weren’t the only ones, though. Others followed, in twos or threes, like the trickling of sand through an hour-glass.
Daphne’s mouth thinned. “That’s very brave, Oliver. But he wants you safe, and so do I. Go with Potter. I’ll look after Theo as if he were a Greengrass. My word as a Slytherin.”
Draco shrugged. “I have, on occasion, been known to be wrong.” Harry began to smile, and Draco warned, “Don’t be smug. It’s not a bond in the traditional sense.”
She then cited examples of White Mages throughout history. Inexplicably, however, she focused mostly on the great deeds they had accomplished. She ended with Merlin, and speculated that Camelot’s long-awaited Golden Age had never come to pass because the people had never accepted Merlin for who he was.
When it stopped, he was alone, and the hole in the ceiling was gone. He ran back to the alcove, slipping in behind the heavy curtain. He didn’t know how far back he’d come.
,” Voldemort snapped, shading his eyes. “I’m curious, Dumbledore,” he said, his voice not quite a gloat. He wasn’t sure, Dumbledore thought. Still that blustering, scared child at his core, terrified that he wasn’t good enough. “Your duelling technique seems somewhat lacking today.”
He dragged his lover out to the Quidditch shed as soon as he was done. “Come on,” he wheedled. “You haven’t flown in months. I know how that feels. Umbridge took me off the team last year, remember?”
“I believe I mentioned, the last time we spoke, the importance of people’s perceptions,” Scrimgeour said, taking a leisurely sip of his wine. “The wizarding world is turning against you. It will take but a few, shall we say,
Harry reached out to him, brushing his fingers over Draco’s arm. His eyes were dark, in the way Draco knew meant he wanted to kiss him. “You’re everything to me.”

The battle was progressing nicely. He had sent only the first wave of his army into the castle so far, and Bella’s reports indicated a favourable outcome was already within his grasp. And he had yet to unleash his inferi, let alone the second wave of Death Eaters. The dragons, admittedly, he had not anticipated. His losses would be great. But not insupportable. His giants were hard at work, grabbing the dragons out of the sky. It was an impressive sight.
Harry stared at him. The Resolution Potion had made everything so clear, and now it was all a mess again. What could possibly have gone wrong? Why the fuck would Voldemort have passed over him in favour of Draco? He cast
“Cherry trees were often used in ancient wizarding rituals to stabilise and focus the mind, providing insight and increased intuition in order to overcome obstacles,” she said quickly. “They are grounded in extremely strong Earth Magic, and any potion buried between the roots will be imbued with this magic. In addition, the number twenty-seven is a powerful number in Arithmancy. Hence the number of days the phial is buried.”
“– you can kill me now, but I swear by all that’s Magic, you’ll get what’s –” She stopped, and stared at the padlock lying on the ground. She looked up at him.
“Where?” Hermione asked, as Ron helped her to her feet. She pushed soaking, tangled hair out of her face with unsteady hands. “Harry, honey?” she prompted. “Where did you send him?”
“I think it means she may really have had a complete change of heart,” Hermione said. “She didn’t call me a Mudblood once!”
Fawley and Dawlish were assisting the Healer, working to save as many as they could. Arthur Weasley was much improved, but it was taking all their efforts just to keep the Delacour girl breathing.
He couldn't let this happen. Not again. What if it was the straw that broke the camel's back? What if Draco couldn’t forgive him? What if he was so disgusted by Harry’s betrayal that he couldn't even bear to
“She’s in the infirmary,” Pansy said, quickly. “It’s about as deep inside the castle as it’s possible to be.”
“Oh, that,” Ron said. “Coming of age ceremony. Usually political; people toadying up to families with power. Don’t see it much anymore, I guess, but he’s defected in the middle of a war. They’re making it a statement of allegiance. Everyone will be watching carefully to see who steps up, and who doesn’t. The time for sitting on the fence is obviously over.”
been looking, just not with any intent. Now, of course, he had an obligation to look, so he caught and held those guarded grey eyes with his own. “It took me a lot longer to see you than it probably should have. But I see you now, Draco.”
. I won’t help Malfoy, and he’ll realise I’ve cut him off. He’ll be terrified. He’ll do whatever you want.”
“Do I?” Draco bit Harry’s shoulder punishingly. “Didn’t you say you hated me, before I claimed you?”
She cast a Notice-Me-Not Charm on herself. The charm was usually useless against the enemy in the hypervigilance of battle, but with the beserkers causing chaos, no one would be looking for her. She gave them a wide berth, and no one moved to stop her.
Even Ron’s restraining hand couldn’t keep Harry down this time, and he was in Moody’s face before the other man could blink, shrapnel injury be damned. “Draco is
“That I can’t say,” Pius said. “But you should know within the next twenty-four hours. For now, I recommend a good night’s sleep, and for you not to worry. That will only stress your bond, and drive you further apart. There are still options we’ve yet to explore. More difficult, perhaps, but I am confident we will find a way.”
“You should run,” Bill advised. He was standing just inside the cage, fingers pressed white-knuckled against a pillar. There was dried blood on his hands. “Dragon-tamers are quick on their feet, and even quicker with a spell. You’ll never beat him.”
“Which are next to the kitchens,” Tonks added, ushering them through, “where there's a staircase which leads to the hallway behind the infirmary. It’s where most of the professors’ rooms are, including Madam Pomfrey’s. She has a door that links her room to her private office.”
“Greg, free is the last thing you’ll be if you go back to him. Bowing and scraping, fighting for his approval, tortured on a whim... Have you ever been
The road was small, hemmed in by trees. They came three-abreast; hundreds of them, Bellatrix at their head. Pansy realised she was shaking. Something brushed her arm, and she almost dropped her wand, biting down on a scream.
Ravenclaw managed to score another goal, but then Ginny spotted the Snitch, and Seamus was up on his feet like everyone else, roaring encouragement.
“I hope to Merlin and all the Founders not,” Harry joked, wriggling his fingers and letting lightning spark between them.
Draco chuckled, deep and low, and there was mischief in the bond between them. Harry groaned, his head jerking up just a split second before Draco thrust in a little deeper, hitting his prostate. He grunted. “
Draco didn’t look surprised. “There are only vague references to it in even our oldest texts. My family made sure of it. But apparently the Dark Lord has uncovered it again, and he plans to use it on me if I fail. Harry… it sacrifices a child's magic to the Wild Magic. Any number of wizards can participate in the ritual, and from sunrise to sunset the next day, each one of them is gifted with a power greater than you can imagine. A single wizard could breach Hogwarts’ defences with a simple wave of his wand.”
“Harry gave himself up for us!” Ron snapped back. “You can’t just hide while kids fight for you! There’s an

Draco focused almost as if against his will on Harry’s lips. “So I did,” he said, glancing at the curtains surrounding their bed. There was no movement beyond; not a sound. Harry held his breath, wondering if Draco was actually considering it. “Lift up a bit.”
at the injustice. There was an answering echo of hate and rage in his mind, and it shocked him back to himself.
But the branches shifted again. He stood facing Dumbledore on top of the Astronomy Tower, Bellatrix whispering in his ear. The old wizard was unarmed, weak, cowering. Draco pointed his wand at him with trembling fingers.
“Voldemort fears it,” Harry pointed out. He frowned. “Does he know about the Hallows? He had the stone –”

on the bag. It was breakfast; a bacon and egg buttie, three fat sausages, steaming hot, and an Un-Spillable glass of pumpkin juice.
He felt his hands curl into fists. He might not be able to call Harry his anymore, but that didn’t mean he was going to watch from the sidelines as the Chosen One died obediently on Dumbledore’s timetable.
“Fine,” Weasley grunted. “Could’ve been worse. Pretty sure it was meant for my femoral artery. I’ll have a go healing it in a minute. Got to get Rowle and Yaxley secured first.”
of Hogwarts threaten to tamper with his mind, while the one man who had pledged himself to Draco’s aid, time and time again, had been silent, clearly communicating his willingness to turn his back on him if it came down to a choice: Draco or his cover. (Worse, that it wasn’t a cover at all, and Snape had been prepared to sacrifice Draco’s memories for the sake of Dumbledore’s war.)
“I guess he’s not, at that,” Ron said long-sufferingly, and Harry glanced at him suspiciously. But there was no sarcasm in his voice; in fact, Ron had been astonishingly supportive over the past few days. Perhaps
“You want to dance with him,” Pansy realised, only a very little innuendo in her tone. She understood now. Draco wanted to fuck Potter, of course, but what he really wanted was to

“No,” Severus said. “Apparently Bellatrix was convinced by our performance that night. The Dark Lord was inclined to be suspicious, but he seems to have placed the blame squarely on Draco and Miss Parkinson. Still, he’s displeased with my failure. This is my opportunity to ‘redeem’ myself. He knows I know your methods, and he knows I will die unless I finish Draco’s task and kill you. He’s left it up to me how I will save my own life.”
“You were right all along,” she said, looking faintly bewildered. “He was a traitor. He betrayed us all. He Stunned me, and then he tried to kill Dumbledore. Everyone was unconscious, and Dumbledore was unarmed. If Pansy hadn’t come round the corner at exactly the right moment –”
easy. Concealing the damage to their bond, hiding his emotions from him, not even telling him the truth when he failed to go into heat... and worst of all, deciding to
Pius looked deeply disapproving. “An Alpha-Omega bond requires intimacy to connect two people; sexual, physical, and emotional intimacy. Their so-called ‘bond’ was entirely platonic, and terribly rigid and unaffectionate. Dumbledore refused to give Severus what he needed, and kept him tied to him rather than allowing another Alpha to claim him. He bit him, of course, sixteen years ago, but an Alpha-Omega bond will never be more than half-formed without the knotting.”
“Ah,” Dumbledore said. “I am afraid the sword of Gryffindor alone would not have been enough to destroy a Horcrux, even forged by goblins a thousand years ago for one of the finest wizards of the age. What it can and
Pansy glanced at Draco. Draco shook his head. Fuck, no. He wasn’t touching it with a ten-foot pole. Pansy took it for him. “Thank you,” she said, her voice lilting up in a question.
“Mm,” Harry agreed absently, as his Alpha’s hands trailed slow circles over his stomach. His skin was tingling, cock hardening, slick wetness slipping down his thighs, and he opened his eyes. “
Except that time was no longer a luxury they had, Harry thought, miserably. “We haven’t talked about your father,” he said, changing the subject.
He slipped his fingers between Harry’s legs, stroking up his perineum and gently fingering his balls. Harry thrust his arse up with an involuntary moan, giving him the room he needed to pull Harry’s hard, leaking cock down between his legs, close his hand around it and pump slowly as he sucked hard at Harry’s swollen, red hole.
“He doesn’t,” Draco said, simply. “My father said he cast the Killing Curse at you. You don’t kill a ‘ganger. You
But Potter ignored him, backing him up against a rickety chest of drawers and claiming his mouth again, hungry, demanding, his hands everywhere on Draco’s skin, sure and possessive. Draco shivered and surrendered under the assault, bringing shaky, fumbling fingers up to Potter’s belt to reciprocate, only to snarl with frustration as the unfamiliar Muggle clasps failed to yield to him.

Kingsley did not make a speech. Instead, he walked over to where Harry and Draco sat. “Harry,” he said, smiling. “I think we’d all like to hear from you.”

,” Granger said, breathlessly. “Oh, Harry! Is that what this is about? Do you have a crush on Malfoy?”
“Fine,” she replied. “The passage is actually quite wide. It should be fine.” She paused. “You don’t have to come, you know. It’s a long walk, and lunch is only an hour. I have Divination right after.”
“Exactly,” Dumbledore said, smiling slightly. “But it is then that my story becomes still more tragic. Because my brother Aberforth could see the darkness I was descending into, and when Gellert and I proposed moving down to London, where we could begin our plans for Muggle domination, he stood against us. The resulting duel terrified my sister, whose magic surged out of control, worse than ever before. In the chaos, she was killed.” He paused, and then said, “To this day, we do not know whose curse it was that killed her.”
“That was fucking amazing,” he whispered, slipping a hand into Draco’s robes. A hot, hard erection jutted up into his palm, and Draco gasped. “You
Harry roared. It shouldn’t have been possible. The bond was still firmly closed on Draco’s side, and non-verbal magic had never been his forte. But Dolohov screamed as the spell hit him, and kept screaming.
Draco flinched. “I know,” he said. “He’s bound to have heard by now. It’s all over the school. I suppose I should be grateful for the trial; it’s the only reason it’s not plastered over the front page of every bloody paper right now. I should get Madam Rosmerta another letter.”
when your parents died! Dumbledore should have protected you! Instead, he left an infant in the hands of monsters; an act of such deliberate and callous cruelty I’m surprised he didn’t just kill you the night your parents died! But then, he had to make sure you lived, didn’t he? To raise you and mould you to be his sacrifice on the altar of his war –”
“Is he looking at me?” he whispered to Ron, while Hermione diligently tested the pH of the soil of their newly-potted Dittany.
“I didn’t even know that was possible. They’ve never appeared sentient before. They just – ask for the password. In English. And let us in. How did it know you speak Parseltongue?”
“Of course he does,” Hermione said, and Harry looked so dumbfounded at the idea that she realised it had honestly never occurred to him. Really, she didn’t see why not. It was no worse than keeping a giant three-headed killer dog in the school, or sending students into the Forbidden Forest for detention. Magic was dangerous, and it made a certain sort of sense that students should learn that in school before venturing out into the far more dangerous wizarding world as adults.
“Order business,” Bill said, giving him a smile, and Ginny a quick, one-armed hug. His wand remained at half-cock. “You only just caught us. We were heading back to the Ministry when we ran into this lot.” He nodded at the Slytherins. “Can we trust them?”
“Professor McGonagall!” he cried, spinning. “You’re –” She coughed, blood and spit bubbling up from her lips. His heart sank, and he glanced at Ron. “I’ll catch up.”
She cut a diagonal line away from the hut, towards the path. There were less Death Eaters there. The twisted trees barring the path were gone. She couldn’t see Bellatrix, or any of her lieutenants. Dolohov. Mulciber. Rookwood.
Professor Slughorn, who had tried to escape the castle grounds, only to run into two fourth-years. He’d caused a distraction to sneak them past enemy lines, giving his life for theirs.
They went to visit Dumbledore after the exam. Draco asked, on the way out of the classroom, how the ring had been destroyed, and Harry realised he didn’t actually know. He wasn’t sure whether to feel angry or just resigned. After everything they’d been through, Dumbledore was
Harry’s mouth twisted. “Then you’re the only one. Everyone’s scared. And everyone cries. It’s not something to be ashamed of.”
A pawn, Dumbledore had called him. Well. Harry wasn’t going to stand back and let Draco be sacrificed,
The Three Broomsticks was heaving with loud, rowdy students. Draco bypassed the popular pub, leading Potter instead to the Hog’s Head Inn, where it was dark and quiet.
As for Dean, Harry made an effort one day to send him an owl, and got a reply within an hour. It made him feel horribly guilty. Dean was going to be an outcast for the rest of his life. And Remus was even worse off, imprisoned for a crime he’d had no control over.
Draco closed his eyes, and Harry followed suit. He wasn’t sure what they were supposed to do, exactly. Lucius was right. The wards were powerful Dark magic; cruel, and malevolent, and nothing at all like Draco’s. Voldemort.
There wasn’t time to go all the way back to Hogsmeade. Ron took everyone to the little graveyard at the edge of town, where the secret passage from the third floor of Hogwarts came out. They emerged in the castle to find the statue of the humpbacked, one-eyed witch missing its head. Hogwarts was in ruins.
He summoned a fragile-looking book from his desk, and began to flick through the pages. They looked impossibly thin, but they didn’t tear. Some kind of preservation magic, maybe, Harry thought.
The Boy Who Lived would dance his last dance with Death, and there would be no slipping through its fingers, this time.
“Not yet,” Hermione agreed, glancing up at him. The look on his face made her pause. “I just mean, that’s the direction you’re going, right? That’s The Plan.”
“Whatever he intends, Draco is more than a match for him,” Pansy assured her. But her voice faltered despite herself, and she cursed herself inwardly. There was no way Daphne hadn’t caught it.
Draco looked up, smirking. Nott looked revolted; he played the homophobe so well that Draco had often wondered if he might be a closet case himself. But no, Theo was hopelessly smitten with Daphne. It was quite tragic, really, the way he pined hopelessly after her. Draco had opened his mouth to say just that when he registered the way Harry had frozen.
Ministry-approved, whereas Snape had to be very careful what magic he performed inside Hogwarts, to maintain his cover.
Granger disentangled herself from Weasley, stepping towards Draco. “No more debts,” she said, hand outstretched. “Friends?”
Draco’s eyes narrowed. “How do you even know about that?” he said. Harry just smiled, and shrugged. Draco’s brows twitched together. “But you’re right, as usual. Dark magic can be dangerous. And yet the wizarding world couldn’t do without it. Blood magic is the basis of almost every ancestral home’s wards in England, including Light families. Sex magic is used in marriage bonds. Some of the most powerful protective Charms are Dark magic. There are evil uses for Dark magic, just as there are evil uses for Light magic. It’s a
anymore. He was killing himself, slowly but surely; as surely as if he’d stood before the Dark Lord himself and refused to complete his task.
Ron grimaced. “Bloody hell. That’s the gap they squeezed through? I can’t believe even a first-year could have gotten through there.”
“No,” Potter interrupted. “He’s trapped. Death is keeping them all here, in this in-between. But he can't take them. I don't know why. All I know is, if he lets them go, I might be able to resurrect them.”
Draco looked fondly reminiscent. “Banned you from ever playing again, the way I remember it. With good reason.”
“I could only wish,” Pansy said, and then ducked out of the room before he could cast a hex at her. She heard it bounce off the wards, and Draco’s yelp as it ricocheted back at him, and walked away chuckling.
Malfoy snarled at him, biting down hard enough into Harry’s shoulder that he yelped in pain. “Shut up,” he said. “You’re
Harry slipped the Time-Turner over his head as Draco opened the door, tucking it away safely inside his shirt. Crabbe, Goyle and Nott were already in the small den; Crabbe and Goyle yawning and scratching their balls, Nott with his head buried in a book. They all looked up when Draco’s door opened.
“I don’t care,” Ginny said, firmly. “I’ve had it. Tonight was the final straw. I’m not putting up with it anymore.”
“But I don’t know how I got here,” Pansy said. She could feel the spirits pressing forward, just waiting for her to acknowledge them. “Is – is Harry Potter here?”
Harry stared, gaping. Draco was there instantly, ushering him into the house. “Close your mouth, Harry,” he said softly, a hint of an amused smile playing on his lips. “Not even you can make that look sexy.”
As Pansy watched, Draco’s heavy-lidded gaze travelled around the room, landing on her and lingering just a moment. A faint smile crossed his lips. Pansy narrowed her eyes at him, noting the slight disorder to his hair and clothes, and the way he was leaning ever so slightly against Potter. He was
There was just no way to misinterpret that. Not after their conversation in the infirmary. Draco had
know that You-Know-Who... V-Voldemort, I mean,” as Hermione gave him an encouraging smile, “is a Dark Mage? Well, that’s what people reckon, anyway. The missing ten years. Of course, he was probably studying it long before then, from all sorts of sources, but the Dark Arts is one of the forms that requires complete isolation to master, in the end.” He lowered his voice. “Mum says it’s because no Dark Mage will ever consent to teach another, so the only way to learn is by communing with the most malevolent elements of the Wild Magic.”
Harry whirled away. “It doesn’t matter,” he bit out. “Talking about it doesn’t change anything! I have to die, so the world can be rid of Voldemort. I’m prepared to make that sacrifice.”
“Exactly,” Draco agreed. “The bigwigs at the Ministry justify it with their petty equivocations, but the unpalatable truth is that they don’t even formally recognise vampires as living beings. It had nothing to do with ethics, or the actual categories of Light and Dark. They were simply concerned about the potential of the spell in the ‘wrong hands’, so they labelled it Dark to scare people off.”
Harry shrieked and bucked, and Draco laughed, grabbing his hips to still him. “Going to take my time,” he taunted, gently. “Remember, Potter? You didn’t think you’d get off that easily, did you?”
Draco turned away, and retched. There was nothing left in his stomach, but he retched again and again, a cold sweat breaking out over his skin.
He’d always known success was practically impossible. Ironically, he’d only held onto hope this long because of Harry. And now Harry had given up on him.
Harry’s heart slammed hard against his chest. He flung up a shield, then turned on his heel, Disapparating. He was aiming for the spot just behind Dolohov. It was a risk. Apparition wasn’t his strong suit, barring accidental Side-Alongs to the Room of Requirement.
“When I signed up for this, I didn’t know there would be homework,” he said, morosely. “How does Hermione read this stuff for fun?”
“Position where?” Pansy asked. Apart from the army just beyond the wards, there was no one in sight.
“Of course,” Hermione said, in a tone which implied she was just humoring him. Harry’s glower deepened. “We knew this wasn’t going to be easy, Harry,” she said, more sympathetically. “You’ve done remarkably well, really. He went with you to Hogsmeade, and he let you inside the Room where he’s working on his task – both significant accomplishments. You’ve obviously managed to get under his skin, and that’s the first step. You just need to keep working at it.”
Draco hesitated. “Again, I’m only postulating. But do you remember what you said to me, after? That the magic
Hermione had been murmuring something to Ron, but at this she turned. “You don’t think your destiny was to defeat Voldemort?” she asked, curiously. “But you fulfilled the prophecy together –”
!” Travers’ wand went flying. Rosmerta hit Avery with a Full Body-Bind. Then Macnair was there, dried blood on his knuckles, fighting them back. Longbottom went down.
Harry frowned. “Charlie brought reinforcements from the Ministry. If there were more people willing to help, wouldn’t they already be here?”
“The Room of Requirement,” Harry said, letting his eyes flick deliberately to Draco’s Mark. “Your task. Are you –?”
“So do I,” Harry said, and Draco’s eyebrows shot up. “What? Any sort of prejudice is wrong. Whether it’s against Dark wizards, or Muggleborns, or werewolves, or homosexuals. Or anyone.”
“I understand, sir,” Harry said. “And I – I promise to think about it, and to be careful in the meantime. But I can’t promise to stay away from him. I don’t want to lie to you again.”
Voldemort smiled in satisfaction. “Your pitiful mind will not withstand my attacks for long. And when I have broken you beyond repair, you will stand by my side as your creator once did, and kill those who were once your friends without mercy. And when it is all over, you will weep for what you have lost as I
. I can’t pretend to understand your motivations, but you could have had me say anything during your court-case. I’m the owner of this establishment, and an respected member of the community. You could have had me destroy the defence’s case. But you didn’t. You let me tell the truth, even though the truth – that I saw only the aftermath – was less than helpful to you. Whatever your reasons for doing so, it seems clear what your motives are now. So, Mr Malfoy. This is my proposal. You give me your solemn word that you will sit down with me after the war to explain yourself, and we’ll say no more about it now.”
Sadie Atwood stood abruptly, scowling. Her two most staunch followers, Trent and Maria, rose with her, hands on their wands. “This is the Slytherin dorms, Potter,” she said. “Gryffindors are not welcome here.”
She shook her head at him. “I didn’t know that meant he was a Mage; that there was a title for it. I suppose I just thought of it as not so very different from being a Potions Master or something.”
She was an angel, his Pansy. Beautiful, witty, and shrewd, with a practical streak a mile wide, and a tenderness of spirit that would make her an excellent mother, one day. He’d always thought that when he married, it would be to her. But he would rather suffer his father’s lectures a hundred times over than inflict a loveless, asexual marriage on her; not when he knew that she desired a union of love above anything else.
“They go to trial tomorrow,” McGonagall said. “Whether or not they will be convicted is another matter. With corruption rife in the Ministry, I’m afraid there is no guarantee we will recieve anything approaching justice. Now, off you go, Mr Potter. Professor Dumbledore is waiting.”
She raised an eyebrow, looking amused. “Even though we might get reported, and I’ll be late to Divination?” He nodded, giving her his best pleading look. “Very well,” she said, and Seamus could tell she was stifling a smile.
“Better than nothing at all,” Seamus insisted. “I won’t end up like Harry, separated from the one I love by useless fucking
Harry shrugged. “For a while, I thought I was. I thought he saw me as a weapon, and nothing else. But he’s trying to fight an enemy with far greater numbers, and protect hundreds of kids at the same time. Of course he has to prepare me for – for what I have to do, and of course he makes mistakes. But I have never doubted that he would take my burden from me as well, if he could.”
Running footsteps, screams. Shouted spells. A sharp turn that made Draco’s head spin. A curse whizzed by his ear, singeing the top of it. He cried out in pain.
. He glanced over at Hermione, silent and still in a bed among many. He wished she was awake. He needed her, desperately. “What else can I do?” he asked. “I can’t just let those kids die.”
Harry shrugged. “Rookwood used his fists on you. That was wrong, Draco. You were in Auror custody. You should have been protected. You should have had your
Harry smiled, shaking his head. That ability of Draco’s to take his words and throw them back in his face was one of the many reasons he –
The Atrium was a scene of carnage. Bodies everywhere, the floor torn up, and that ugly black statue transformed into some kind of enormous… cage? There were survivors inside, but Mad-Eye Moody was the only one he could see outside, slumped against the far wall, his left arm cradled in his lap. It was broken, judging by the jut of bloody white Elphias could see. Which meant both arms were out of action. He was helpless. They all were.
She looked around, bewildered. There were a few stares from the surrounding tables, but on the whole, everyone was treating the bizarre spectacle as if it was a normal, everyday occurrence. Even the professors looked disinterested.
Which meant Charlie probably worked with them now. “Cool,” Harry said. “You know a lot about dragons, huh.”
. It was one minute after midnight. He grinned, touching the smooth surface of the claw. Merlin, it was huge. And utterly gorgeous. “You remembered,” he said, bouncing happily on his toes. It was his birthday, and he wasn’t at the Dursleys’, and Draco had
Sleep was beckoning in the corners of his mind, and he only opened his eyes when, with the last shreds of consciousness, he realised Harry was gasping for breath, trembling as he tried to stave off his own orgasm.
Theo and Daphne glanced at each other. “We can do that,” Daphne said. “At least, I can’t cast a Patronus, but we’ll find a way.”
“This!” Harry said, waving a hand around at the Great Hall. There were so many eyes on him it felt like second year all over again. Or, Merlin forbid, fourth year. “I thought everyone saw me in Hogsmeade with Draco.”
There was no shriek, this time, but the girl dropped a pile of heavy books. Harry let them fall; he figured Malfoy would be expecting him, anyway. “What are you doing here, Potter?” the girl demanded, her tone oddly antagonistic for someone so slight and bookish. “I heard what you did to Draco today! You’re not getting near him again!”
Vincent dropped his wand. “I’m not sorry!” he said, jaw thrust out. Frightened, but determined. “You can punish me. But Draco’s my friend.”
He flung it over his shoulders, pressing himself back against the wall. He had to take a moment to calm his racing heart. However much time he’d gained, it wouldn’t matter if he was killed between now and when Harry left the infirmary. He had to stay alive, and he had to figure out a way to save Harry. His father had seen Harry die, at Voldemort’s hand. He needed to know what had happened. But the only one who might have known the answer to that was his father, and even he didn’t know; not yet.
Pansy met her blue eyes, pausing deliberately to let Daphne’s words hang in the air between them. “I suppose,” she said finally, “that that is something only time will tell.”
“I believe these pathways may be acting in a similar fashion,” Madam Pomfrey said. “Reaching out to the magic in the elements around us; supplicants, requesting aid when you need it most. When your emotions are most desperate, most powerful.”
“The bond is rooted deep in them both now,” Dumbledore told him, not unsympathetically. “It has been for a very long time. Even if we wanted to separate them, it could not be done. I think it was too late before we even became aware of their connection.”
– a spy in the Dark Lord’s ranks. But my effectiveness in that role has come to an end, and Dumbledore sent me here to help.”
“Well, they didn’t know that,” Hermione said, “but you’re right, of course. I still don’t understand why – no, I understand why he doesn’t want a long, drawn-out death. But why
She smiled at him, that warm, fluttery feeling returning. She leaned up to whisper in his ear. “You took me up against a
“It’s not like that,” the other Harry said, frustrated. “I’m just memories you’ve locked away; nothing else. Yes, the heat buried everything that might have interfered with the bonding, but it was still
He took a deep breath before taking it in his hands. Trying to focalize what he wanted, who he wish to see. He closed his hand around it, closing his eyes.
The boys turned around to look at Draco who was standing beside them. Potter was staring at him, the blond boy could tell that he was nervous, his green eyes looked troubled. The brunette shook his head.
The salty wind caressed his face. The sound of the waves smashing, mixing with the sound of the birds flying above them... His toes burying in the sand, a feeling that seemed like the most relaxing and satisfying thing in the world. The warm on the sun touching his face, even though the chilly temperature felt much worse right by the sea. The smell of the sea. The smell of the daffodils mixing with the beach.
“We didn’t know it was this bad already. We asked, almost daily... He kept telling us that the was only having the coughing fits.” His dad was worried, he could hear it in his voice.
Draco threw some floo powder into the fireplace and pronounced the Granger-Weasley’s address. Soon enough Hermione’s face appeared in the flames.
He told them everything about the party, the astronomy tower, and the train. He even told them his theory about Potter being angry about something else and exploding about this stupid thing. Sirius seemed to agree with Draco, that it was weird for him to react like this. Mr. Potter didn’t, though.
Draco walked to where he was and wrapped his arms around the boy. His shirt started to get wet from his friend’s tears. At some point, Ron gave in and hugged him back.
He spoke the password that professor McGonagall informed him and entered the office. When he got in, the old man was sitting on his desk, drinking a cup of tea.
“No, I found out about it in third year. Or on the summer before fourth year, I don’t remember.” He replied shrugging. “So yeah, pretty badass to have that...” He took a deep breath as he felt the flowers calming down a little bit. “I’m glad that you are not as skinny as you were, but because of your health, Potter. You look healthy now and it suits you... And I always liked your height. When you get sassy you are like this 5’5” bitch and I always kind of liked that...” He said trying to contain his smile at the memories of Harry sassing Severus being the cute little thing that he was.
“We know that you are angry, Draco. We’re just happy to see you-“ Granger started to explain and the blond boy snorted.
“Here, let me help you.” His dad said before kneeling next to him to grab the books and offering them to him.
Most of the time, the twins were a team and Lily tried hard to catch up with them. The age difference was a problem, for the most part she was still a baby while Albus and Leo were already learning to read and spent their time playing Quidditch outside. Lily was just learning how to ride a broom, she was still to little to play with them (as Leo liked to remind her).
The most curious thing is that Draco always believed he would die young, he didn’t know when exactly but he could feel it in the deep of his soul, carved into his bones. When Death asked for his own life he was just glad she hadn't asked him to kill himself right there- Because Draco wasn’t scared of dying, he was just a coward that couldn’t take his own life. This was easier. It would just happen to him. He hesitated to tell them. On the bright side he would be relieved to talk to someone who didn’t  actually cared for him all that much, not like Severus did; on the other side, once they hear what he had to get they
"I'm afraid that Lily and Albus are going to get detentions but probably for something silly like sneaking out to the kitchens, I bet 20 on that. Albus is going to be first in class this year... I put 10 galleons on that because I have my doubts. And nothing is happening this year with Kale and Leo because of Leo and Rose." Draco groaned in frustation as the rest of them looked utterly shocked.
He looked at Sirius as if he had lost his mind; Fixing his glasses. He was going to deny it but his father spoke.
He felt Potter tense beside him.The blond boy cleaned his tears with the back of his hand and looked at him again. Harry had taken off his glasses and he was pressing his eyes with his free hand, the one that wasn’t attached to Draco’s. The boy started to mumble things that he couldn’t quite understand, angry.
Weasley groaned and crossed his arms. He was clearly pissed off and Draco couldn’t blame him. He missed him too, they saw each other all the time at Grimmauld, but now they were on different houses. And there was the fact that he couldn’t see Potter’s stupid face without coughing. If the green-eyed boy didn’t want him around, then he wouldn’t be.
His father tried to ask what was it that Draco had done but his godfather cut him shortly, saying that Harry would talk if he wanted and when he wanted.
He, honestly, didn’t know. Theodore had told him that Draco was good in bed... but he had other persons to compare him with. The blond boy liked sleeping with him, and sometimes it was mind-blowing, but he didn’t know if Theo was a sex god. He supposed that, at the least, he needed someone to compare him with, to really be sure.
Pansy loved the code. She used to recite it in second year when she thought that Draco or Theo were the heirs of Slytherin. She just hugged them a lot, told them that they could trust her, that maybe she didn’t agree with what they were doing but it was irrelevant. She wanted them to be safe and to have someone that they could rely on. Draco and Theo used to laugh until their belly’s hurt in response.
Draco couldn’t find it in him to regret the less cunning decision he made on his life. Thinking that, probably, he would make a whole bunch of un-slytherin decisions if it meant to have the people he loved happy and safe.
Harry heard the conversation from upstairs as soon as he got out of his room. He hated that Ron and Malfoy always talked about stuff when neither Him or Hermione were around.
Padfoot and his dad came to the castle everyday, but they stayed outside of the hospital wing when Harry and the rest of them arrived.
The smile on Harry’s face was quickly replaced by a frown. Of course Malfoy was joking, what was he thinking? He was so stupid, Merlin.
If Draco had to separate them by closeness, he would say that Leo and Rose were one pair, while Albus and Kale were another. Harry always said that the twins would ended up in Slytherin together but Draco had his doubts... He thought that Leo would probably end up in Gryffindor with Rose and Albus most certainly would go to Slytherin with Kale.
, with the stupid curfew it was impossible for them to sneak out. Then, his best friend widened her eyes in realization, she turned to the rest of the group.
Another cool thing was that Nott and Hermione came around all the time, the burrow was like their hang out place, Harry already knew this but he never got to live it, maybe he would stay a week or two at the end of the summer but Nott and Mione were always on trips with their respective families so he never got to see them. Now he saw them all the time, it was awesome.
“Maybe you could spend your summer learning how to actually do an occlumency shield, instead of cracking jokes about how the Dark Lord can get into your mind with such ease, Potty.”
“First: Potter may be unbearable, but he is attractive in a regular kind of way.” What a load of bullshit. Weasley was looking at him like he was crazy. “Second of all: The list is because I don’t have time.” Ron frowned at that.
“I thought you were sleeping...” His shy voice made the flowers move inside of him, trying to state their dislike with the situation.
Harry was aware that this was hurting Draco. The blond boy wouldn’t ever say it, not with Nott acting like a prat on purpose, but it made him feel small, unwanted. He could see it in the way Draco would hug himself as he talked to Hermione, trying to find some kind of protection. And as more days passed, it became his personal goal to make Parkinson feel unwelcome in their group. So whenever they wanted to play monopoly? Parkinson was not invited. Going to the Three Broomsticks? Parkinson was not invited. A friendly quidditch game? Parkinson was not invited.
“Oh, but I’m not even finished.” Then he looked at him up and down and bit his lips. He could swear that Theo blushed a little, before being notoriously uncomfortable. “But if I were to stood in your level... I would kindly remind you that most of the openly homophobic bastards, turn up to be closeted and ashamed themselves.”
. I hate her. I hate that she doesn’t even know him. And I hate him for wanting her.” He said as he cried harder. “I- I know that it’s not a fucking
“I had this idea of Sirius in my head, since forever, that was suddenly corrupted by him doing something cruel. Even if he didn’t realize the consequences of what he was doing, it was still something really cruel.” Harry frowned at that. “On the third full moon, Padfoot got really hurt. I found him trying to clean his wounds alone. I always used to do that for him.” His dad smiled at the memory. “ I offered to help and he asked, very shyly, if we were friends again. I understood then, that I was awfully wrong about ignoring him.”
“Someone from St Mungo’s is coming. They don’t want to move him, and Madam Pomfrey needs help.”  Said the potions professor.
The boy was rather energetic, he walked towards them with a smile on his face. The weasel widened his eyes.
He was already in, though, and he needed that sword. Draco swam, diving into the chilling waters, he was having troubles seeing clearly, so he casted a wordless lumos while he still was underwater. The blond boy attempted to take the sword by the grip, extending his arm to grab it.
“This is a bad idea.” He stated as he walked through the hallways towards the Great hall with the rest of the order. “Last year, when the Death Eaters infiltrated the school, they didn’t
He got up and walked towards their table. Potter was frowning at the article. He heard Granger speak.
“It’s permanent ,Potter. I’m not that awful.” He paused for a moment, thinking about if he should tell them or not, but his narrow piercing green eyes where looking at him, trying to find proof. “I made a deal with Her, it’s  permanent”
The kids were all outside fixing up the tents, this would involve getting all the supplies they needed from the house before dinner because it gave them time to go over everything at least twice. The supplies were the things they needed for pranks mostly, maybe candy that they wanted to hide under the pillow, but mostly the things for the pranks.
Draco felt so happy, he woke up to a reality where Theo still chose him to keep his secrets. He smiled as he looked at the hazel-eyed boy.
“No. I was just thinking about how bloody often he talked about Cedric in fourth year.” Draco rolled his eyes.
Draco put his most guilty face and walked towards him. He raised his wand and casted a silencing charm around them before talking.
It was madness, people were taken away and he could hear the Death Eaters demanding for the guests to hand in Potter.  He found Sirius and Mr. Potter fighting back to back, quite literally, great method to avoid being curse on the back but still, the killing curse couldn't be blocked... They needed to leave.
“I don’t know what that is.” And Draco didn’t like to admit when he didn’t know something. He studied everything, knew all the pureblood customs by heart, he read ancient magic books for
“Can you kiss me?” Is the only thing that Harry could reply after his monologue. He tugged Draco’s hand and guided him close, he needed to feel like everything was real.
“I hate how I act around you.” It’s the only thing he responded. His mind too blurry to think about something else.
He allowed himself to look at her, the fabric of the white transparent dress floating around her, her silky long black hair framing her beautiful features as she drag Draco into the depth of the lake. When he stopped struggling she took his face in her hands and muttered something that he couldn’t understand.
Dumbledore looked more and more thin as the year went by, the blond boy thought that it was not a good look on him. He looked sick.
No talks after midnight, no stolen kisses in the middle of the day, no listening to Queen while Potter run his fingers through his hair, and no-
He didn’t even knock on the door, fearing that the boy wouldn’t let him come in if he gave him the chance.
He still spent time with Nott. Even with different interests, the boy always was there for him. And being with him was as easy as breathing. He used to think that if the world were perfect: Draco and Theodore would be in love with each other. But the world wasn't perfect. And right now, they weren't even talking.
The blond boy tried to fight the blush that was appearing on his face. He offered his hand to greet Weasley’s brother, the redhead took it, shook it kindly and smiled at him.
This is why he understood mother. His only goal for the day was making Potter happy, and it didn’t matter if Draco had coughing fits today because he would make the beautiful boy happy.
The only thing that was good about the fight was that they were fighting back to back. Good for cover. Not good for killing curses.
It wasn't coming out, it was awful. His face was getting red from the suffocation. He inhaled as deeply as he could, the air barely passed through the flower, that was stuck in his chest, to get to his lungs. Draco forced to cough out that same air. A small movement, something went up a little.
He was kissing Draco lazily that morning, he loved to do that. He loved to feel like the mornings were an extension from his dreams, this reality where he got to wake up with the blond boy’s arms around him. For a few minutes, he could pretend that this was permanent, that this was the way that he was going to wake up for the rest of his life.
. 11/10 was enough embarrassment for a life time, imagine saying 100/10. Too much, definitely too much.
“Yes, detention. For the curse, ferret. You were there.” Draco said ‘Oh...’ in a low voice. “Ginny was super pissed, she thought that maybe you suggested it to him, since he is your godfather and-“
