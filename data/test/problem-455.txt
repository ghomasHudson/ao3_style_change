"Err, just a fore warning that I was not expecting anyone tonight and mess would be an understatement." Draco laughs at Harry's concern and promises him that he won't judge too harshly.
It's at that very moment that the entire table turns to look at Harry. Ah, he probably should have been listening.
"I needed money." He starts, "and no one would take me after the war. Especially not with this on my arm," he stops. Harry can feel the regret lacing his words as Draco lifts his sleeve to show a faded and scarred Dark Mark. Harry has an innate reaction to take his arm in his hands. So, he does. Draco's breath hitches as Harry starts tracing the mark and surrounding scars. He takes a moment to breathe before continuing,
"No, no, it's okay. Blame it on the fire whiskey." Draco smirks at Harry and Harry can't help but smile back.
"I'm not the best Auror of our time. They call me that because they want to suck up to me. I'm clumsy and forgetful and I'm awful at paperwork. And being a florist, well it sounds... nice." Harry trails of and thinks he could have picked a better word.
“I’m glad.” Harry thinks of Narcissa, and thinks of how she helped him, “She deserves to be happy.” He pauses for a moment before sharing, “I don’t know if you knew that she helped me. In the war.” Draco shakes his head in response, his eyes meet Harry’s with a curiosity, “She lied to Voldemort, she protected me. She’s a good woman.”
Harry's cooking dinner that evening, glad for his day off, when his mind starts to wonder. He can't believe he saw Malfoy again. Spoke to Malfoy. It feels like it's been years and to just bump into him in a coffee shop, a muggle coffee shop at that. It must have been 2 years? since they'd last spoken and he can't help but wonder what he's doing now. He's barely heard from him, about him, since. What was he doing? Where was he working? Where did he live? Did he have a partner? And could he smell burning?
"I miss quidditch, it was so freeing up there. So much space, no restraints." Draco added. Harry remembers when they used to play and despite the rivalry they had, he must admit that Draco played well. He put up a good fight on the pitch.
It was at breakfast the next morning when harry began to properly consider what Luna had mentioned. In Hogwarts, he'd never had a chance to explore or experiment his sexuality - he'd found he was a little preoccupied. But it wasn't like he'd tried to find time to or even wanted to find time to. The little dating he did do was fine. But it was just fine. Sex was never at the forefront of his mind but he’d never thought that it should be, or should it?
He spends the rest of his evening drifting in and out of his thoughts, mostly filled with his ex-rival. Harry finds himself wanting to know him and talk to him. And what is he thinking? This is Malfoy. He is just some guy and he shouldn't be preoccupied thinking about him and even if Harry did want to see Draco - sorry, Malfoy - the likelihood of bumping into him is so slim that he probably won't see him for another year.
"Oh." Harry huffs out a laugh, "Thank you? I think." He pauses, looks around and realises that they are still standing in the corner of the crossroads, "so where are we going? Or are we departing for tonight?"
"Do you think Lavender's hot?" Ron had once asked. And Harry had thought about it. But why should he know? She was just some girl.
"Well," his gestures continuing, as if to direct Harry's point of view to the statistics of 'hot', "she just is, ya know."
"Although I appreciate your attempts to hook me up with someone, it's not what I want. And I don't just mean this guy. I mean... anyone?" He tries to explain but quickly realises that he's made it sound even more complicated.
"I've met people before who are asexual and sex-repulsed and asexual people who are sex-positive." Luna continues, and Harry feels like his head might explode with all the different terms.
"It would be rude not to get to know my girlfriend's best friend." Luna smiles and takes a sip from her tea, "and besides, he's been helping me do research for the quibbler, it's been so helpful."
"Would you like to join us for coffee?" Luna asks and Harry is about to object as this is not what he signed up for but luckily Malfoy beats him to it.
“Ginny, he has changed. He regrets what he has done he’s actually quite decent now. You know what happened back then you had your apologies. Besides you don’t have to like him. We just get along alright now. You know Hermoine is planning this reu...”
Draco seemed to decide against pressing the matter more. “So Helve, you said it would be ok to take Potter out on a trek with one of the therapy horses?”
Severus and he.. Severus had always entrusted him with everything. He never took much of his advice to heart but he respected the mans wished. The only reason he was hesitant that night, the night Dumbledore died, was because Severus would die in Draco’s place. And at that point, Draco already wanted nothing more than death.
Harry, as dull  and pissed as he was, just smiled and answered. “Oh ya know. The boys. They became friends and Malfoy being a right git thought I wouldn’t like that. It started with a dinner and ya know… he’s an alright git nowadays. I wasn’t obsessed. I was suspicious.”
“That’s a good Potter.” And with that he went to get his well needed shower, only looking back to smirk to himself as he saw potter immediately getting to cleaning his clothes with spells.
“So you’re both little trouble makers, McGonagall must have her hands full keeping you in check.” Draco hummed, Harry nearly jumped out of his skin, the bastard had sneaked up behind him. Scorpius beamed, hugging his dad.
Normally when Draco entered a place of magic, it gave him a little warm chill. Magic had a warm and welcoming feeling over it. It was almost overwhelming now. Constricting him and tightening his chest, squeezing at his heart, uneasy. Potter wasn’t here. Potters magic was close however, it was drawing him like Moths are drawn to lamps. He took a step into that direction, and immediately it made him feel less constricted. Definitely Potter. He took Skadi up. “Lets go love.” He hummed, grabbing the bird and making his way outside. The closer he got to the location, the more dreadful and empty the streets became. Something definitely wasn’t right.
Harry roled his eyes, taking it before moving to stand next to Malfoy, leaning against the wall “They’re so fussy. Did you see Ron looking?  He thinks you’ve got me cursed.”
“I don’t plan on leaving.. it’s all fine by me, being close to you that is. But I am glad you’re willing to sacrifice that. if you change your mind. Let me know. we can work this out.”
When they returned after a small tour they were greeted by the Weasley’s and their kid. As well as Teddy, James and Albus. The kids seemed to get along quite well. Albus and James seemed to be a bit upset with the news their father was divorcing but they understood. Apparently they were willing to give their dad another chance because they stood close to the man. Hugging him goodbye when it was time to leave.
But… here it comes… I got sorted into Slytherin! Like a real Malfoy! I haven’t had to use my scary spell yet. Everyone has been nice to me and Albus. Have I told you about that yet? Me and Albus Potter. Friends! We share rooms and we met in the train, he gave me chocolate frogs. Now I know I’m not allowed to have those because they make me hyped. But this was a special enough occasion right?”
Soon more people filled up the hall, some Draco recognized, some he didn’t anymore. He got quite a few glares but… overall it wasn’t too bad.
“I.. am not allowed or in an exact place to tell you this Draco. But.. she suspects either you or the other guy cared a little more than.. you know.. average friends do…” he started. Seemingly thinking how to correctly word the next part. Malfoy listened intently. “The spell you used has some.. other imple… uses? It is no longer used because of that. It is possible you are.. kind of like. You could have become more than friends, because either of you was wanting that.” Helve said, watching him closely. “But she is not very certain about it. And she is looking for a way to resolve this thing so you know.. you won’t lose your arms. And Draco. I want to say. If you do care about him more. That is ok with me and Momo. We just want you to be happy.” He gave him a gentle hit on the back. Draco just nodded, a bit stunned.
So, the next day, after doing his tasks around the house, he gathered his bag, put on a cloak and apparated to a small alley in Bergen, muttering the old Norse spell to open the gates. You see, where as magic was more based around merlin and is teachings in the UK. Most traditional wizards here believed they had gotten their magic from the great Nordic Gods. They celebrated their feasts differently, they believed in hand labor more than using magic for every task. And believed in living honorably and hopefully one day reaching Valhalla and feasting with the great god Odin himself.
“I don’t think its any ones fault.” Harry mumbled, carefully running his fingers along the bands and hurt skin around them, trailing down but keeping his hand on Draco’s lower arm. “I think you did everything you could to try and get me back safe and sound I.. hope you do not regret doing so. Whatever I am feeling right now is better than death to me.” He said it, dragging out the words as if thinking of what to say while he was saying it.
As they were saying their goodbyes. His eyes caught a familiar face. Hermione, she had become head of the ministry. He’d expected no less. He’d seen her once before. During his hearing when she and Potter made a case to have Draco get away spot free. But that was back when she had cut off all her hair. She now was sporting long hair again. She seemed well off. Weasley must be treating her well. Speaking off… His hair was more blondish red now. Not the Bright fiery red his children had and his used to be. he’d definitely gotten some scars over his years as an auror.
“Its still Malfoy for you.” He grumbled, sitting down regardless. He still didn’t have much of a fight in him.
“Draco watch ou..” too late. Draco dropped to the ground. Screaming in pain. Another spell silencing him.
“Malfoy..” Ginny said softly. “I.. Thank you. You really have changed.. Please find him. For the kids. He won’t have to forgive me. Just for the kids.”
He groaned when the door opened. What did they want now. He didn’t know who was holding him down here. He faintly recognized some voices, but he had no idea whom they belonged too. Something about continuing the dark lords plans. Supposedly in a few months potter would be the big sacrifice. They’d execute him publicly to make a statement. They captured him first chance they got.
After gathering the stuff he needed for his potions, something he still enjoyed thoroughly  even though he had been forced into taking it. He ended up at the bird store. No owls. A common sight here. See. Due to the influences of Norse mythology, they only had Ravens. Based upon Odin’s messengers Huginn and Muninn (thought and memory in old Norse), two great ravens said to deliver messages all over the world. If you got a speaking raven it was a blessing of the gods, and you should only send such a bird to great friends. Malfoy however had learned that ravens were just really smart and picked up certain words over time. But he respected their culture.
“So. You put on the cloth first, like this… then, the saddle, make sure it is off the shoulder a little.. connect the girth and pull it tight. We’ll tighten it more when you get on… that’s the stirrup Harry.” Helve explained it all kindly, Harry found it easy to talk to him. He started to understand what Draco saw in him.
They talked some more. Planning stuff they could do that wouldn’t be to taxing on their friendship but still close enough for them to benefit from being together. Harry would quit his job for now. They would do their shopping together.
{ Found out rose is the same age as Albus and Scorp so she’s at school too, Hugo and lilly are friends and Ginny watches them most of the time.
They spend the rest of the evening and into the early hours, listening to several albums worth. Not talking much. By 3am they were both passed out on the sofa, fast asleep and having peaceful dreams.
“I still feel the same. I would have done it even with this consequence. Your friendship is worth it to me.” Draco whispered almost.. the bands loosened up a little when Harry touched him and he could feel his fingers warming up again. It almost stung when he let go.
“Sounds good, as long as you two try not to get each other killed.” Dean teased, wrapping an arm around Seamus.
Skadi flew in, landing on his shoulder and Draco lunged forward. But instead of aiming for the person that had just threatened, he grabbed Harry’s shoulder. Apperating them away. As far as he could reach and think off.
“I asked on what terms. Do you want me to like.. pay you rent? I’m assuming Grimmauld place would be a better option than my tiny apartment here.” He asked, slightly annoyed.
“They’re kids Malfoy. Its fine. Ginny said it was. Her only problem is with you and to be really honest. She’s a Weasley. They’re just really good t holding long grudges.” Harry shrugged, not taking his eyes of Malfoy, he was already halfway done with his drink. Which, to Harry’s taste was bit of a strong pour.
“We’ve been trying to recruit you  Draco. You’ve become quite illusive these days.” New guy spoke. “but seeing as you broke in so desperately to save Potter. I don’t think we have much use for you as a member. Perhaps we could control you but at this point. You’re better off dead. You’re worth more as a ghost member. Don’t worry. We’ll put some of our actions in the Malfoy name. your family will be great again. We’ll have your boy part of us and…”
Malfoy smirked wide. “Good choice, I would love, absolutely adore for you to give the group your best pickup line and smolder.” He hummed, knowing full well Harry was far to awkward.
Even using the floo had tired him. His magic reaching out yet again and this time reaching Harry. He was panting lightly.
He woke up a day after Draco. Or so they told him he didn’t really know how long he had been gone. He just knew he felt like utter crap and wanted to sleep a lot more than he had. He felt horrible, breathing with broken ribs turned out to be harder than he remembered.
They said there goodbyes. Helve seemed concerned still but decided it would be best to give his friend some alone time to settle down.
“Say Gins. Malfoy invited us to dinner for next Saturday. You wanna go with? Its about Albus and his son.. Scorpius was it being friends?” he asked, coming in without knocking.
By the time Draco came back, Hermoine had already made them all breakfast and she insisted he’d at least stay for that. it was surprising how much she was like Ms. Weasley nowadays. Fussing over everyone. Harry was almost certain she just craved some personal contacts. Her job prevented her from a lot of close contacts so she kept those she knew close.
“I’m still sorry for what I put everyone through… but I am glad you lot found it in you to forgive me. It means a lot.” He said, nodding a soft smile in their direction. His answer seemed to please her and she shook his hand before leaving him and his friends alone again. “well then..” he muttered, looking back. Finding Potters eyes meeting his. He was surrounded by a fan club of people thanking him. He seemed just as uncomfortable as Draco felt
“I told him he’s been a useless father.” She swallowed hard. There was more. She clearly didn’t want to tell him more. He was going to have to push just a little more.
“I..” he rubbed his arms a little. “its not safe Harry. You heard them. They wanted me in.. Or dead. Us hanging out could mean horrible things. Its.. Its better for everyone if we just stop contacting each other so we’re no longer associated. It’s also no good for your reputation to hang out with me. Trust me… the binding spell will lift with time. And..”
Draco sighed shakily tears rolling down his face as he  pulled him close. He eventually let sleep take him over. He should’ve stayed hidden. He shouldn’t have gotten involved.
“Not really asking Potter, it’s bad enough I slept in the same bed as you.” There was a devious little gleam in his eyes.
Draco wasn’t exactly planning on going tonight. He most definitely was not. At least he hadn’t been until Blaise, Pansy and their dates for the night had shown up this morning early with a suit and stern looks. They took his wand and shoved him into the shower to get ready. He had reluctantly drank a calming potion and done as told without to much protest after setting everyone up with drinks.
Once finally in, she silently sat him down in the living. Pouring him some tea without asking, which Draco found rude…. But he let it slide.
“Sod off Potter. Can you grab me some tea. One scoop of…. Open fire, 500 ml of water. Boiling hot. And fast thank you.” He hummed, snuggling up under the blanket.
“And so you slept with him without perhaps, opting to tell potter it might be better you both move on without one another.” Malfoy said, his voice actually kind, soft. The one he only used to talk to Scorpius most of the time and Astoria when he had suggested they’d move on.
After some more conversating and talking about their lives, Harry and Draco decided it was time to Floo home. Landing in his apartment.
He also wouldn’t tell Draco, nor anyone else present at the party, that he looked very peaceful when he slept. Soft and serene. Free of the hash, guarded expression he normally had. How soft he became when he was a sleepy drunk and how he had, without a warning, nestled himself against Harry last night.
“If anyone would have told me I would have to be the one to break to you what technology is. I would’ve called them insane.”
The Love between them was platonic. They cared deeply for each other and he couldn’t imagine life without her by his side, she was his comfort. Even if she just did it for her son at this point. tonight some of that was changing.. a difficult change but... change nonetheless.
By the time he found the street he felt incredibly out of it. It was dark out, the moon was up high and lighting an empty street Draco faintly recognized. Wasn’t this were Voldemort had taken his residence while regaining his strength? Probably. It was a clever spot really. The big abandoned house in the middle of the street.  it gave off creepy vibes from the outside because of all the spells. But the inside was gorgeous, stunning. A rather classic interior, furniture dating back centuries, way back to when the Riddle family had been founded. Draco, thanks to his dark mark could still enter the building easily. Walking through the wards. His wand ready in his hand. Skadi up on his shoulder, scanning her surroundings and ready to get out to find help.
“Of course.” Harry nodded. Somewhere along the lines he had been starting to hope the spell couldn’t be lifted. He had given in. He was bloody gay and he enjoyed it. Every little moment they got to spend together. He hadn’t had a single nightmare recently. He knew he would have to tell Malfoy eventually. But he didn’t feel ready. He wasn’t ready to be pushed away and be distant again. Perhaps when the spell would be lifted one day he could..
“Leaving like that. Putting my son at risk. Making your kids upset. How dare you?!” he barked. Walking up to Potter, wanting to add another bruise to his collection. He walked back off again, it took a lot to do that. “You could have gotten him killed potter. Storming off like a stupid moron.” He yelled at him. “I don’t know what kind of imbecile you are but I am this close to kicking your ass.”
“It’s Harry. And I wouldn’t know. When we we’re kids you seemed like you were still getting your ass wiped.”
“You don’t have to pay rent. We both benefit from it right? Besides the place gets lonely if there’s no one else there.”
“Harry James Potter. May I remind you that not only is it 2AM and I have a shift that starts at 7AM? But I also do not give a rats ass about Malfoy and I care even less about what his son does with my Son as long as he doesn’t blow him up like his father would like to. You go do something for your Children once. Now let me fucking sleep.” Ginny rambled. Looking very close to cursing Harry with every single forbidden curse in the book.
“You were buggered last night. Everyone crashed at Ron and Hermione’s. I tried to get you to your room but you kept telling me “I live at your house. I’m claiming it. So I just took you with” Harry snorted as Draco shot back the potion. Almost gagging at the horrible taste.
“They’re right Draco. The Weasley is right. It could make a difference. Even for your son.” Blaise said, speaking for the first time this morning. Surprising everyone.
And never ever. Would he admit that he had liked it. It was weird. Draco Malfoy making him feel at ease.
He took another sip watching Ginny try to find the words. “I… we had a fight over the headline of last week’s newspaper. “ she muttered. “He left and refuses to contact any of us.”
It was only when the witch silenced them they heard they laughter coming from the two idiots who were apparently having a little brawl over the snitch on the floor. “I most definitely broke some ribs Potter. Its mine. Give it.”
The moment it entered the building he inhaled sharply. he felt like he could explode. His whole body tensed, he opened his eyes wide, as far as he could with two bruised eyes. Ready for it to burst through the door.. to meet whoever it was trying to save him.
They talked for a bit more, harry went to greet his other kids and godchild Teddy, while Draco took his time to meet Albus and Scorpius, letting himself be dragged around the castle. When he got some time apart with Scorpius he sighed softly. Telling him about the divorce, which Scorpius took surprisingly well. Wishing his father whatever would be best for them as long as they didn’t make him choose between either, to which Malfoy had responded he and Astoria would never. They were still friends after all.
Harry knew, he bloody well knew he was gay and in love with none other than the drunk guy curling against him this very moment. He couldn’t place it. What about Draco was charming him. He wasn’t bad looking of course. He was bit of a.. a lot of a prick. He treated Harry like he always had. But always made up for it in his own ways. It was refreshing, to not be treated like either a savior or a broken man that couldn’t fend for himself and was incapable of anything. Draco was just an asshole to him. Despite everything.
Draco caught him but fell back in the process. He tried to think of more insults . none came to mind. He just felt emotion overwhelm him.
“Work? Oh yea. Work has been good. I’m off to Romania in about two weeks. apparently they’ve been dealing with a nasty well spirit in some small town. They think someone tossed a cursed item down and it’s been causing a bunch of failed harvests. I’m going to see what I can do about it.” Harry said, sighing softly.
“Binding spell I found in a book. I hoped it would work.. look. I need to go. I’m not safe here. Nor is he. There’s an uprising. Tell them to double security at Hogwarts… I have to leave.” His breathing speed up. He felt himself panic. “They are trying to finish what the dark lord started.”
As soon as he left. Draco went to setting up an altar. He wasn’t as familiar with the Norse traditions. But he decided he would look into it more as he went along. He had his guidance from Mormor, it interested him and the more he looked into it. Their beliefs seemed to fit a lot of his.
The conversation quickly took on. People brainstorming about the party. Should there be a tour of the castle? Should there be a memoire for those they had lost? Should there be a theme? Which band would they have playing?
And so, but 6pm he had arranged everything. Taking his bird and just some essentials, as well as a spell book focusing on finding spells. Hoping there would be anything to help them find Potter and his stupid antics. Who disappears from home like a moron. Leaving your kids with such worries. What would the press think?
{ sorry not sorry but there’s a dragon prince reference because two of my friends who be reading this have watched that show and got me into it and it just kinda works. Also mentions of physical violence. this is a longer one. I haven't been able to update as soon as I'd like due to working again. Uploads will be less frequent but i will make them longer as i do write everyday when I find the time.}
Harry pulled out his phone, he rarely used it. But there was some music on there. “A phone. You can call people, like a fire call. And play music on it.”
Once in there it was time for a good old game of wizards truth or dare. A game in which you took a shot if you couldn’t do the truth or dare. If the other did do it, you took the shot. First to puke, needed to pee had to suffer a group punishment. Which usually consisted of a horrible Glamour spell. “This is childish. I am not playing this stupid game.”
He sat himself down beside Neville, Malfoy flopped on the chair beside him, getting a stare from Pansy, but she kept her mouth shut. “So… how are the hangovers?” Ron asked, crumbs flying out of his mouth as he spoke.
Harry was most definitely here. His magic felt almost intoxicating to Malfoy. He took a sharp breath. Focus Draco. He heard the first set of footsteps approach him. A red bolt approaching him, which he blocked quietly and shot back. A soft groan indicating he had hit his opponent. Skadi flew up, flying over the candles around the room, dimming the lights before landing on the chandelier.
After Harry the others tuned in. Agreeing, all of them but Draco who seemed to be lost in thought. “I’m unsure.. I know it has been Years. But there are some pretty bad grudges out there. They would have to double down on security and…” he took a deep breath, shutting his mouth again.
Albus’ dad has been missing. Al said he and his mom had a fight about something and he left. No one can find him and I just wanted to know if you maybe know where he is? Is he staying with you? Please let me know. Al is super upset and I can’t help him. I want him to smile again.
Draco was panting heavy, trying to calm down. Grasping his wand under himself. Harry watched him. Feeling his panic, trying to reach out to him to try to calm him down.
He made his way to the inn where he was charged with an extra fee for not returning the key in time and for Skadi attacking anyone trying to clean the room. He silently paid, retrieving his stuff before making his way back home.
“What? Hes grown out of his awkward phase finally. I know a good man when I see one. The Weasley… well he looks like one expects of a Weasley. Overworked and overtired.”
This afternoon the kids had been allowed to visit him, he smiled at them. hugged them carefully. Apologized for disappearing. Told them to do good at school and how much he loved them. Lilly had bawled her eyes out. Even Ginny had been there. They had a short version of the hard conversation they were meant to have. He forgave her. She cried. He kept telling it was all good and she deserved to be happy.
By the end of the night they ended up going to a bar. It had been incredibly long since Draco had had fire whiskey. The hot liquor burned nicely down his throat and before he knew it he was pissed drunk. He managed to find his way to the toilet and by the time he made it back. The trio he’d seen earlier had joined his. Together with Luna Lovegood and Neville Longbottom. Great. Just great. Thank merlin he was drunk. Sober he wouldn't have been able to face this.
“I can tell you two are still morons. I cannot believe you just did that.” Seamus sounded accusing. Walking closer to check them over.
“I… I have another. He’s left me alone for weeks on end. We haven’t slept in the same room since I gave birth to Lily.  He hates me and.. I felt alone and defeated. And then Richard came along and he gave me the actual love I needed and…” she choked on her words.
“Too late Malfoy.” Smirked, pouring himself of what Helve called a sweet berry liquor, which was basically berries from his yard, a red fruity liquor and a fuck tone of vodka. It was strong, sweet and a little sour. Honestly Draco’s favorite after Gin tonic.
They laughed, it was a little ridiculous after all. If you’d have told Draco he’d be sharing drunken smokes with Harry and feel genuinely comfortable around him at Hogwarts he’d have cursed you into the seventh department of hell.
He didn’t speak much after reading the letter. Perhaps it was the binding spell making him this upset. Perhaps it was really his feelings of gratitude and fondness of Malfoy. He didn’t know. All he knew was that he would have to find Draco and make it up to him. He missed him.
The moment scorp was out of sight, Draco leaned in on Astoria. “I cant take it.. I hate seeing him go.. I’m worried. “ he whispered, his expression was calm, he even put up a smile incase his son was looking. “He’ll make it Draco. He’s our son after all. Not a thing in the world can scratch that boy.” Astoria reassured him, squeezing his hand softy. Draco closed his eyes for a moment. Taking a few deep breaths. When he opened them again.. his grey eyes met the green ones of potter.. he was almost on the other side of the station but.. it seemed they were now both aware of each other’s presence. And Potter… my my… potter had the audacity to smile at him.. the vile creature that had bullied him for years. Taken aback Draco managed a half smile before turning his attention to the train that was about to leave the station., finding Scorpius he waved. Seemed his son had found friends already. Chattering about something he only managed to wave for a short second before getting out of sight.
Why. Why did he drink so much. He remembered… did he do a shot race with Longbottom last night? Did Hermoine update him on the latest politics while he leaned on Potter because he was “The only sane one left in this goddamn bar” while he pointed at Pansy and Blaise trying to learn a spell from Luna and giggling like morons…. Everything hurt. He groaned, peaking through his lids. Oh no to bright. Keeping those closed. “Skadi. The potion… Please.. he muttered.” Holding his hands out. Expecting a caw and wing flapping.
Without looking up or even really knowing whom he was going with he let himself be guided to the outside. Taking a deep breath before taking the cigarette handed to him, closing his eyes as he pressed it to his lips. Taking a deep huff.
The process that had taken harry about 30 minutes  to complete, was finished by Malfoy in about 5 minutes.
He stood up, carefully putting a hand on her shoulder, squeezing it softly. “Its alright Ginevra. I don’t blame you. I can’t promise you it will be ok. But Potter is forgiving and it is obvious you care for him.. I’ll do anything to at least make him hear you out properly. Thank you for trusting me.” He said, letting go of her shoulder, getting ready to walk away.
“But because the spell isn’t lifted, and might not lift until we find a counter. It is for the best that I stay here. Close to you. If you plan on leaving town. Please do let me know. I will follow at a safe, not creepy distance. I’m afraid that will be the only way for us to function right now.” He admitted.
“S’fine. Its harder on the kids. I think we shouldn’t have even married to begin with. She gave me comfort and all. But we were never meant to go this far. I can’t love her.”
“Potter, I stole something from Longbottom and flew away with it just to get your attention and impress you with my flying skills. “
Harry snorted. By now he’d learned Malfoys defensiveness was just the way he liked to talk to Harry, supposedly to keep him humble.
“what do you mean Harry. Seriously. You and Malfoy at a friendly dinner? Who poisoned you and why didn’t that poison exist in sixth year.” Ron said raising his brows.
I feel as if my writing for the kids is a bit awkward, I sadly  haven’t had the privilege of reading the cursed child nor have I seen the musical, I tried to read up the best I could but I might just write a filler chapter soonish with some of  the adventures Scorpius and Albus have.
Stupid Potter getting himself into trouble on his nice Friday evening he was supposed to be reading right now. Enjoying a lovely wine after a hot bath. He probably still smelled like the damn horses. The idea of it only pissed him off further.
“Will you be good to him?” he asked turning to harry. “I know you have been nice so far. But I have to ask.. will you be good to him? When he came to Norway he could never smile. I do not know much of the war you fought. but no man should feel broken like that.”
Liked by Harry Potter… Perhaps he did have a little crush on Harry as a kid. I mean was it really that weird? Hate and love weren’t too far off of each other right? Not anymore though. Draco had come to terms with the fact it would be better to not form any deep emotional connections but friendships with people. It was for the best really. He was too unstable. And being gay wasn’t something he would ever really accept him to be. he and his mom were talking again and he didn’t want her to have to deal with that. No. he and potter were friends finally, at least he considered him a friend and he would like to keep it that way. For the years to come.
“either way, I have to go. Albus has a map that shows all the secret roads the castle has build after the war. Were gonna explore some. I love you and take care.
“Fuck off.” He barked. “Stop it. Stop hurting him. Let him go.” Harry’s voice trembled slightly. A soft sigh of relief leaving him when Malfoy’s face calmed again.
“You know. I do not appreciate my husband hanging out with they man that hurt my family.” Ginny started. She was enraged. “You didn’t tell me you and Malfoy are all buddy buddy now.”
He opened the door to Harry’s room. He hadn’t woken up yet. Which was fair enough seeing as he apparently had been awake three days straight unknowingly.
“To be honest no. They’re still the same. Giving me puppy eyes. Acting as if I saved them all. I don’t like it.” The other sighed long, looking out over the woods.
“we did. At the reunion. They’re married now and you commented about how I do not appreciate any kind of cooking.”
“so Harry how has work been?” hemione asked, smiling sweetly as she tilted her head, trying to encourage him to participate more.
I tried my best to portray the relationships and what I know of them but it just doesn’t feel quite right. }
Finding Grimmauld place wasn’t too hard anymore, it looked rather cosy and nice nowadays. Getting into it was more difficult. It took Malfoy fifteen minutes to get Ginny to open her door.
The healer had told him it was natural. It was a strong spell and seeing as he hadn’t known about it and Draco wasn’t experienced in the field. All kind of stuff could have gone wrong. He was told to just, try to relax. Realize he didn’t need the caster to be there and he wasn’t missing anything. They had given him some potion to help him get over some of the worse effects and exercises to help distract him. None of it really worked but.. he managed to keep up the act pretty well. Things would be ok next Saturday. It was all going to be fine right?
Soon Dean joined them. sitting across from them. Making some small talk. The dogs were still at his feet. Malfoy kept eyeing them like they were going to eat him alive. Barely managing to keep a straight face.
“Or she isn’t. If it could end the violence against anyone that’s ever been in Slytherin… Ill talk to him about it but it might take some convincing. He’s still Malfoy after all.” Harry hummed.
“Next topic Blaise or I’m bringing up your past. I’m sure there’s people that would love to hear about Zabini and half the Slytherin team take a shower that gets out of hand.” Draco hissed.
“I can tell.” Potter didn’t move away. You know. His eyes were really lovely. Green deep pools Draco could drown in like he used to in class. When glaring and watching turned into staring and admiring… he took a step back, taking another hit and blowing the smoke in the others face with a grin, shaking his head, attempting to shake the thought of perhaps leaning in a bit closer himself and.. you're drunk Draco.
He had spotted Malfoy at the station the other day when dropping the kids off for school. He’d grown up. He had been lean. But he looked stronger, in a new way. He looked strong when they were kids, mentally mostly. Nothing seemed to break him. The trails had been the first time Harry had seen Malfoy rather broken and distressed. A look that didn’t suit him. At all. It was part of the reason harry pushed so hard to have him and his mother get away easily. Especially since they both saved his life. He seemed better now. Still stoic and cold, the opposite of his son that had been bouncing around the place. He did seem to care for the kid a lot however. The way Harry felt he should be for his kids but couldn’t bring himself too.
“Same here. My fan club is absolutely draining me.” Draco said dramatically, putting a hand to his forehead and pretending to faint a little.
So.. Potter was coming? He’d really have to start preparing now. Perhaps a good time to bring out an actual decent tailored outfit, switch that out for his muggle clothes. He couldn’t let Potter know how far he’d fallen from grace… he should probably tell him this was just his vacation home and.. and… who was he really trying to impress. Potter knew he’d lost everything at the trail..
He had explained he actually thought Buckbeak was quite amazing and how he was just trying to impress everyone, and when it turned on him he had been so shocked he had done everything to make it look worse when it was. He never intended on getting Buckbeak killed. As a matter of fact he had been watching to see if he could spell the creature free when Hermione had so graciously punched him in the nose.
“He left over a headline? What an absolute fuckwit. What did it say. Potter takes a walk outside without his wife. Are they divorcing? “ he asked sarcastically, crossing his arms.
{many POV switches up ahead. Mentions of a panic attack (indicated with *) Also some cursing and descriptions of violence. if this is too much for you, you can skip this chapter. I'll add a small summary to the next one.}
By the time he woke up he wasn’t in the field anymore, instead he was in a soft bed, covered in layers of blankets. He opened his eyes, blinking against the light. Once his eyes had adjusted he realized he was at saint mungo’s, the healers center. And no one other than Granger and Pansy were sat at his bed. He sat up. Groaning softly. By the gods was he sore. He rubbed his arms. The silver bands hadn’t tightened but they weren’t ready to come off either. Not that he really cared right now.
Draco opened his eyes. Looking up at him, “Goodnight Harry..” he uttered, giving him a goofy little smile.
“Though you.. do know today is my day right Potter? We can’t move today. We’re visiting Helve and Mormor and taking the horses out.” Draco smirked.
After some small talk, the keeper came up with a rather large bird. Named Skadi, another goddess. Telling him about how she’d been owned by an older woman who couldn’t keep her any longer. At three years old she still had many years in her. She did have bit of a nipping problem but that was nothing he and Scorpius couldn’t fix. So obviously. He got the bird. She thanked him with a bite to the ear.
Blaise had a grin on his face almost comparable to the one the devil wore. “Hmm, bet he was eager to do so. I remember how he stalked you. Obsessive twat. I bet he’s jerks it to…”
Malfoy turned around, jumping slightly. “P-Potter.” He muttered. “I.. I don’t have more with me. Zabini took em.” He almost whispered looking down at his half smoked bud. “Just take this, I’m done anyway.” He held it out, ready to walk off.
Nodding, I turned to hug Harry, too, before looking back to Teddy. He smiled at me and took my hand, and we raced across the platform together.
His smile faltered, but Dennis nodded, stepping aside and heading toward the group of witches and wizards dressed in porter's uniforms. Harry watched him go, then turned back.
“I heard,” Harry said, ruffling Teddy's hair. “You're quite lucky. As I understand it, Draco is very protective of his son.” Looking up, he locked amused eyes with Draco's, smirking up at him. “Isn't that right, gorgeous?”
Enraged, he turned back to Potter. "You'll soon find out that some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there." And he held out his hand, willing the boy to take it, take his side.
Now, it sounded vile, dripping with sarcasm and disdain. Now, Draco fought not to cringe at the sound of it.
It wasn’t a great shock when Harry was pronounced dead on arrival. It was determined that he’d been poisoned, though none of the usual antidotes had worked, not even a bezoar. Draco wasn’t coping well. He was still numb. He hadn’t cried, hadn’t flinched, not in the week since his wedding day.
Teddy raised his invisible wand, still gigging, then stilled. “I can't remember the countercurse,” he said, looking to Draco for help.
Laughing, Draco combed a hand through his hair. “Nothing, yet. It shouldn't be too long, though. He's a helpful bloke. We were roommates, at uni, and he was constantly helping me with the nuances of Muggle culture.”
“And miss lunch, again?” Draco asked, amusement twinkling in his eyes and twitching around the corner of his mouth.
He tried to stop himself, but the words kept coming, gathering steam until he'd recited his father's rants about the Potters and Weasleys, and even that oaf, Hagrid. He allowed himself to insult and threaten the boy he'd hoped to befriend. Draco wasn't proud of his actions, of egging his friends into picking on Potter and Weasley, of anything that transpired in that train compartment.
Draco softened, the anger that had led him to ordering Jinx to hack off his long, treasured locks smoldering under the pain he'd obviously caused his mother.
Creevey snapped back, as if slapped. “He’s with Colin, now,” he said, an eerie calm coming over him. “He’s safe.”
Hurrying through the train with Vince and Greg hot on his heels, Draco looked briefly into each compartment he passed, checking who was inside. Something told him he knew exactly who he was looking for and, when he found him in a compartment with a freckled redhead, he knew he was right.
I also just want to make clear. English is not my first language. If I make mistakes please let me know. Also suggestions? Yes please!}
“Made you actually work out Potter.” Draco teased, hopping off of Loki with ease, patting him on the neck.
Draco looked at him, seemingly thinking.  “I… you know what.. Sure.” He brought out. “It’s nearing Christmas anyway, the boys wouldn’t mind spending that together I think.” He sounded rather relieved. What had he been expecting to hear?
“Fuck off Potter. Taste it. Pray I didn’t poison you.” Draco smirked. There was no snide behind his comment.
“Ah me and Seamus usually fly and toss quaffles. We gave up on seekers game a while ago because this man keeps losing the snitch.” Dean grinned.
“but of course. What did you expect?” Draco chuckled, taking the lead rope that was on Sigyn from Helve.
“Bugger off yeah.” Draco laughed, finally looking at the other. his eyes widening. Was Potter nake… Oh no he was wearing underwear, thank Merlin. He sighed, stretching his muscles as he got up, thanking god he had had the decency to steal this grubby shirt from wherever he’d gotten it. He had… scars he didn’t feel the need to share about with potter. “Shower?” he asked, lazily looking back.
Harry Potter.. Draco looked up to him you know. When they were kids. Potter had good loyal friends, talent and overall people who loved him. And oh God had Malfoy been jealous. After initially being rejected as a friend Draco had done some moronic things to get his attention. Riling potter up with his badges in fourth year. It was funny to see Potter be an actual person and get pissed off over trivial things. Not the great savoir of the wizards, just a boy getting pissed off at another dumb boy wanting nothing to be liked by him.
“Oh yes. The boys. Look before you go and give me a rant. I’m fine with em being friends. Let them be. they’re not us. Besides after Albus got sorted into Slytherin.. he needs anyone can get.” Harry started. Malfoy seemed a bit taken aback. He.. he hadn’t expected Potter to be willing to let Scorpius be friends with his son. In fact Draco had made a whole list as to why they should be allowed to and to please let his son have that chance.
By the time they got back to London it was quite late. Too late for Draco to go and cook them the meal he promised. “So how about we go for dinner. Diagon Ally has quite the assortment of good restaurants.” Harry opted.
“I suppose you were a tinge less snobbish than I remember. We should speak more Malfoy, really. I mean it.”
“Help?” he sounded so small. He looked small, reaching out his arms to Harry, who almost melted over it, pulling him up, a bit stronger than he meant. Letting Draco fall into his arms. “Merlin Draco. You really cannot handle your drinks.”
Harry never thought of it you know. Perhaps being gay or Bisexual. He wasn’t even sure now how to label his sexuality. He loved whom he loved, he loved them to bits.
“Well behaved. That’s a nice change from you Potter.” Draco smirked. Earning a chuckle from Albus. “Trust me, you should’ve seen your dad at school. A mess truly. Everyone likes to write about him as sophisticated and well behaved. I beg to differ. He looked a mess and the only reason he was ever in time is because grang… your auntie Hermoine kept him in check.”
“It definitely has been. Look at you lot. Actual adults and not the messes I expected you to become.” Draco teased, sitting down with them.
“So, you go up to that guy, Neville Longbottom. Genius with the plant life we’ve got. And the big bulky guy over there, with the beard? That’s Hagrid. Now I personally cannot go up to that man because we never got along, incidents with one of his animals. But I am certain he’ll tell you everything you want and don’t want to know.” Draco hummed, sending Jackson off on his own after feeding him as drunk as he could get him without being beaten by Pansy. Smirking he watched him stumble over.
He’d gathered some parchment, his favorite peacock quill and some of the finest ink. He didn’t allow himself much luxury. But for writing he did. He often wrote poems and short stories. None of them to be published, more so for him to write his mind and thoughts out on paper. It was almost therapeutic…
“Well. Since all of you so graciously stayed, I would love to bring up something I’ve been thinking about for a while now.. A reunion. The year 8 class and spouse. One big gathering. I sent an owl out last night and McGonagall has offered us to gather at Hogwarts the night of the Halloween party as the kids will celebrating in the quidditch field. What are your thoughts.”
He knew Voldemort was looking through Harry’s thoughts a lot. But Voldemort had someone to practice on a lot back then. Draco was good at redirecting his thoughts, only letting the dark lord see what he allowed him too. But it was painful. He could only imagine what Potter felt like, who had probably been even less willing and hadn’t had any practice in redirecting thoughts.
When the headmistress walked in, silence fell over the room. She didn’t look a day older than.. well since the last time Draco had seen her. And she had looked quite ancient back then. It wasn’t too weird, wizards grew older than humans. She had at least a good 30 years before she would go downhill.  McGonagall gracefully made her way up to the teachers table. Looking over them, a small but stern smile on her face. She cleared her throat. “My dearest ex-students.. I am pleased to see all of you back in such good health. I… welcome you back to Hogwarts, tonight the great hall is yours. Please do keep in mind that the students will return to their dorms around 1am and we’d rather you don’t stroll around the halls after that time. Tomorrow you are free to explore the castle while the students are on a field trip, with the exception of those whose parents are amongst you. Your old teachers will join you in shifts.. now please. Enjoy yourselves.”
“You did love her Potter. I know you did. I know its hard to believe. You used to look at her as if she was made of gold. Even back at school. You’ve both just.. been through too much.” He nudged him again, this time softer. “You’re going to be fine. The kids will forgive you, they just need time.”
And with that, he picked up his bag again and apperated to the wizards inn. Getting himself a room, where he got his first look in the mirror. He had horrible helmet hair, wild and all over the place. Sighing he attempted to fix it. A quick spell to clean himself up a little. He put the bird up on a perch. Watching food appear for her. “Rest up my darling. Ill go find Potter and his disappearing twat ass.” He kissed her little head to which she wagged her tail feathers softly before she turned to the food.
Even after all these years, he still had trouble with these things. Falling right on his ass as he landed in front of the cabin. A big, lovely cabin which emitted warm light all over the area. Was that a coop full of chickens? He turned around as he got up. The small lights of the town far below making him take a step back, just a tad further from the edge. Harry was fine with hights… if he had a broom with him.
“Well ofourse.” Draco could almost feel Harry’s brows raise. He most definitely didn’t get what was being hinted at and.. let’s be honest. Draco wouldn’t be the one to break that news to him.
Harry was taken aback. “I.. Of course I will be.. how do you?” Draco came walking in. his eyes were a bit puffy. But he seemed relieved. “You two ready yet?” he asked, gathering his stuff and starting to saddle Loki.
Harry ran upstairs. Deciding black jeans and a dress shirt would have to do. He didn’t have much fancy stuff, he didn’t value it nor did he care for his looks. The only reason his hair was semi cut. Was because Ginny kept chopping it off and trying to fix his “Hogwarts head he should’ve grown out by now.” After a quick shower and trimming his attempt at a beard he was ready.
Draco knew by the time passing silently that he had hit his mark. "Yes. I thought as much. You know, to me you were never The-Boy-Who-Lived."
Suddenly Harry felt the cool, tingling magic of cleansing and protection charms. He felt the press of naked skin against his own as Draco's trousers vanished. He drew in a sharp breath.
The warm wetness disappeared from his aching cock as a soft voice spoke. "We'll have none of that. You will take what I give or have nothing at all."
Harry gasped and Draco brought their lips together. It wasn't like before when the touch had been light and teasing. The blond thrust his tounge into Harry's waiting mouth as he pulled him closer. Slick muscles twisted and curled around eachother hungrily. It was sloppy, teeth clashing, lips slick with spit, and it was perfect. Harry let out a needy moan as Draco sucked his tongue before pulling away.
Draco's gaze seemed to rake over every inch of his body. Harry's cock twitched and began filling past it's already half hard state. Merlin, if Draco could do that with just a look.....
Malfoy chuckled. He deftly undid Harry's belt, trouser button and zip. He pushed trousers and pants to the floor in one swift move before pressing the brunette towards his chair. Harry was reminded of a predator stalking his prey as he walked backwards, never dropping his gaze from Draco's.
Harry groaned in pleasure as Draco teased his head. His tongue swirled around the glans, flicked across the slit before sucking gently. Harry tried to buck his hips up for more, he wanted so much more. Firm hands pushed his hips down into the soft leather of the chair, pinning him.
Harry redoubled his efforts, wanting nothing more than to see the man standing before him completely undone. His mouth began to work at a furious pace, his cheeks hollowing as he sucked on the up stroke.
Draco sneered at the departing secretary. Something in his glare seemed to hurry the woman from the room. He chuckled darkly as he removed his robes and tossed them over the back of the chair. Harry stared at him with slitted eyes. Malfoy was dressed in black trousers, tight in all the right places, that hung low on his hips. His gray button up shirt was equally snug, as if he had poured it over his skin, leaving only the smallest fraction to allow for movement. It was untucked and the tails rested just covering the top of his belt. His attire didn't leave much to the imagination, damn him.
"Well then. I believe locking and silencing charms are in order" Draco flicked his hand and wordlessly and wandlessly cast both charms. "I've waited 15 years and I bloody well better not be interupted."
But how had Malfoy known what nobody else had even guessed at? How was he able to see Harry so clearly? Of course, Harry could never let the other man know how well he was able to read the situation, but he began to think......Maybe Malfoy really could give Harry what he needed. Harry hoped and hated himself for hoping.
"I assume you have come to gloat," Draco drawled. "Or better yet, finish the job. I'm quite defenseless. I'm sure everyone would believe I succumbed to my injuries. The "Chosen One" prevails again."
"Oh. How cute! You think I'm here to negotiate." Malfoy chuckled. "No Potter. I won't be leaving until you fulfill my demands." A sneer twisted Malfoy's lips and his silver eyes flashed in......what was that? Not anger. Desire?
Draco's mouth slowly withdrew and he began to press kisses into Harry's neck. His tounge flitting out to taste and explore, leaving a fiery trail down to the collarbone.
Draco collapsed at Harry's side. Silence surrounded them as both men tried to steady their breathing and return from their blissed out states. Draco reached out a hand and drew Harry to him. Pale fingers carded through dark curls, finger tips brushed lightly against sweat dampened skin. The moment was quiet and content and absolutely perfect.
"Get on the bed, on your back." Draco cut Harry off. For a further distraction, he pulled his shirt off over his head. At the sight of the defined muscles of Malfoy's upper body coupled with his tousled hair, Harry scrambled to comply.
Harry was seething. He stormed toward his desk and the man arrogantly perched upon it. He stopped mere inches from Malfoy's face, his hands balled into fists at his sides, his emerald eyes flashing as bright as the Avada Kedavra. He hoped his robes were positioned in a way that obscured to lower half of his body.
Draco stepped in between Harry's legs. He bent his lithe body forward and claimed Harry's mouth yet again. Breaking away with a gasp, he sank to his knees.
"It's the hour really." Harry continued. "I'm sure your friends would be here if it weren't the middle of the night. But things being as they are....." Harry's voice trailed off. What was he saying? Why had he even snuck out here?
"Everything. I want everything back. The gold, the artifacts. Absolutely everything." Draco said smoothly, his face unreadable.
"Yes, Potter. My demands. The reason that I am here. Do keep up." Draco's voice was breathy and lacked its usual bite, like he too was forcing himself to focus.
"I can do whatever I like, Potter! That's what you......" Draco's voice died in his throat. Did he hear correctly? Did Potter say he needed him? Why would the "Golden boy" need a cowardly Death Eater? Draco was surely losing his mind. St. Mungos wasn't so bad, he thought. He could sleep properly at least, he thought wildly.
“Yes, yes – I just didn’t expect – I thought – Merlin.” Draco laughs and gives up speaking. He kisses Harry again. Harry smiles into the kiss. This is the start of something good, Harry thinks.
“She’s well. Thank you. I try and visit her often; I don’t like the idea of her being alone in the Manor. But she’s as happy as she can be. She’s redecorating actually, which is nice.”
Harry is looking intensely at his fire whisky and isn't sure he can look at Draco again after realising that he is, by Harry's limited understanding of the word, sexy. He can feel his cheeks heating up at the thought and silently thanks the dim lights and flowing conversation for hiding his face.
Harry looks back at Luna with a blank stare as the term goes over his head and a loud bark of laughter is heard from his side as Neville seems amused,
"Ginny'd asked if you'd finally got yourself a shag?" Parkinson gracefully answers and Harry forces a smile that he thinks looks more like a grimace.
"I thought that it made sense, being asexual as I've never felt like someone was sexually attractive. I've never thought of someone as sexy and then. And then..." Harry feels slightly awkward trying to explain this despite how supportive Luna is.
Harry laughs out loud unable to hold it back. Well, he wasn’t far off the mark. He answers Ron and mentally thanks him for unintentionally calming him down. He takes a breath and then reads the next message.
Harry spends his week fairly normally but constantly feels on edge and checks his phone far to often as he waits for Draco's message. He feels like hitting his head against a wall. Why didn't he ask for Draco's number as well? What if Draco was just being polite? Why can't he stop thinking about him and his stupid sexy arse?
"Well we could apparate to mine and chat over a drink?" Harry says on a complete impulse and then worries he's pushing his luck, "or yours? Or neither? Sorry, just an idea."
He's currently sitting in The Leaky Cauldron at a booth in the corner. On his left is Ron with his arm thrown around Hermione followed by Luna who is grinning across the table at Ginny. Between Harry and Ginny is Neville and most surprisingly, with a chair pulled up to the table and a hand over Ginny's is Parkinson. And it still surprises Harry anytime she shows up, arms linked with Ginny or Luna and he always has this reaction to draw his wand, to protect.
That night, Harry’s on the map. Harry’s navigating the map. And Godrick, is it the most beautiful map he’s ever seen. Harry carefully traces and learns every corner, every rip, every turning, and direction on his map. Harry wants to learn his map off my heart. To know all its secret routes, all its hidden gems.
"I guess I do." She thinks for a moment, "I've met a lot of people in the community and when me and Ginny wanted to get with Pansy, we had to learn a lot about sexualities and relationships to make it work."
"Mine it is." Harry agrees and holds his arm out for Draco. He takes his arm and in an instant they're twisted to Harry's front door. This is when Harry realises that he is certainly not prepared for a guest and it might be worth a disclaimer. Harry takes his arm from Draco and starts unlocking the door,
"No! Yes? But no." Harry has really dug himself a hole now. He's starting to regret opening his mouth.
"I'm sorry about the way people treated you for your past, it's not fair, you were only a child. We were all only children. But I'm glad you found that job, it sounds good for you."
"Sorry Luna, I think you've got mixed up, that's like plant and micro-organism stuff and I don't think Harry's a plant."
Harry blinks and shakes his head, he's just another bloke on this Monday morning and Harry tries to ignore the fact that he's finding it remarkably difficult to look away from how the tight denim stretches over his rather lovely arse. But he does and begins staring straight into his coffee. Some small hope that maybe if he doesn't look maybe Malfoy won't notice him. He's starting to lose the staring contest with his macchiato when he's gets interrupted,
He jogs slightly to catch up with Draco and they continue walking. Eventually, they arrive at a crossroads and Harry realises that they have no notion of where they're walking.
The bell chimes as someone enters the coffee shop. He lifts his head expecting to see a stranger or Luna. He's wrong. It's a different blonde and he can't quite believe his eyes. He feels stuck as his eyes follow none other than
In the hours prior to the date (?), Harry has changed outfits at least 5 times; spent almost an hour trying to calm his messy curls; and has drank 3 cups of tea leading to a very urgent toilet break before heading out of his flat. Harry’s not sure he’s felt this nervous in his life – except maybe for the time he had to walk to his own death but that was very unusual circumstances. And, Harry thinks, that he might be walking to his own death depending on how badly he messes up.
"Ah, cool." Harry pauses, unsure of what to say next. He hears shuffling from the other end of the phone and takes it as a chance to think. The sounds quiet and Luna begins to speak.
"’Sure it's not the other way around?" Draco smirks, "although I admit, I'm probably a bit out of practice. I haven't played since," he pauses, "since 5th year."
It seems like the 'if you can't see them, they can't see you' tactic is failing; so, Harry slowly lifts his head to meet stunning silver eyes and he almost slaps himself to remind him that this is Malfoy.
Harry kicks Draco at this and Draco then kicks him back. So, Harry does it again but harder and Draco takes this as a challenge so whacks Harry back again until they are all but wrestling on the sofa, the film forgotten. They tumble back and forth: pushing, kicking, and laughing. Harry uses all his force to push Draco down onto the couch until he’s pinning Draco’s arms above his head and practically straddling his waist.
"How are you?" He goes with, hoping by some miracle that the café gets robbed and then they'd both be saved from this horribly awkward encounter.
"Why thank you Potter, it makes so much sense now." Pansy adds and Harry thinks he can see the sarcasm dripping from her voice. Ginny precedes to whack her on the arm and smiles at Harry,
"There's a cute guy at the bar. If you got any good pickup lines, we could remedy that tonight." Ron holds his hand for a high five over Harry and Neville smirks and claps Ron's hand.
Harry carefully raises his gaze and forces himself to look at anyone but Draco. But he really wants to look at Draco. He really wants to look at that shiny blonde hair and sharp jawbone, flawless skin, perfectly plump lips and those swirling grey eyes that could draw Harry in like a siren.
"I hope it's okay that I invited Draco," Pansy starts, "Luna mentioned that Harry and her had bumped into him and I realised that we never catch up all together."
But he doesn't. Because they're not in danger, there is no confrontation. They’re happy and he doesn't understand how but if Parkinson is making his friends happy then who is he to stop her. It just adds another thing to his list of the incomprehensible. Right under sexual attraction.
It's not like he hasn't seen Malfoy since the war. He has. But only passing glances in the Leaky Cauldron or at Luna's birthday. Not in a quaint cafe in muggle London. And now his glance is much more that passing as he feels like he needs to take in every inch of the man ordering his coffee.
Harry's sitting in his favourite seat in his favourite café with his favourite coffee - a caramel macchiato, for reference - whilst convincing himself that he'd had a late night and that this much caffeine was completely acceptable. It was only his third? coffee of the day.
No, that's not what he meant. He meant that the map showed the route to 'sexy' and he had no idea how to read it.
By the time that Harry had arrived at the café of Draco’s choosing, his hands are literally shaking, and he can’t understand why he’s so nervous, but he is. He can’t see any signs of Draco inside but decides to go in, order a coffee – a caramel macchiato, of course – and sit down. He checks the time on his phone and as if like clockwork, Draco walked into the café - right on the hour. Harry watches Draco as he scans the room, presumably looking for Harry. When he notices him, Draco smiles lightly and waves awkwardly before gesturing to the small queue in front of him.
“I don’t believe you.” Harry smiles, “I bet your soul matches my coffee, sweet and addictive.” Harry’s not sure where the confidence came from, but he then decides to wink at Draco.
"Draco makes a killer veggie carbonara." Draco pulls his eyes away after hearing his name and begins talking to Pansy.
“Okay, okay, you win! Potter.” Draco replies, and sticks his tongue out and pulls a face at Harry. Their breathing is heavy, and Harry realises just how close he is to Draco. Harry thinks Draco notices too as a blush covers his cheeks and he looks away from Harry. Harry goes to release his arms and move away before he does something he regrets, before he ruins his new-found friendship, but is stopped as Draco tugs on Harry’s shirt and pulls him down into a kiss. Harry freezes for a moment and then relaxes. It’s soft and gentle at first but quickly becomes needy and heavy. Harry pulls away to breathe.
It’s filled with subtle glances and sitting close enough for knees to tough It's filled with laughs and smiles and hands grazing as they walk side by side. Hugs before they say their goodbyes. It’s more that Harry expected. It’s better than he expected.
Harry hums absently, pretending that he knows what a Nundu is. He slowly draws his attention back to the table, Luna smiles at him and puts her bag down,
"No, you're both right." Hermione adds, "Asexual reproduction is what you're talking about Neville but I think Luna's talking about the sexuality."
"I- thank you." Draco says but can't seem to form any words so turns away from Harry and continues to walk in the direction they were going.
He remembers those conversations. He remembers that situation because he remembers feeling lost. He felt like Ron and Neville, Dean and Seamus, and everyone it seemed; they were following a map when Harry had never been even taught to read a map. Harry was just following their lead and as soon as he was by himself, he was completely lost.
He thanks the heavens that most of his work this week has been admin as his mind is not on task and he's not sure he would have been the most helpful on the field. It gets to lunch time and Harry realises that he's completed less than half of what he should have. It's at this point he gives in, pulls out his phone and calls for help. Again.
Enough. There’s no point panicking about a message when it’s probably just Ron asking a bizarre question about the logistics of a fruit lasagne.
"Oh, did I say that out loud?" Harry laughs awkwardly and looks at the floor, he brings his arm up and scratches his neck, almost attempting to cover his face. Draco nods slightly and Harry's not sure if he's blinked since his slip up.
"Don't laugh," he pauses and takes a breath, "I'm a florist." And Harry doesn't laugh because the image of him working somewhere so quaint shocks him, he almost thinks it's a joke.
But the first thing Harry does when he gets back to his office is turn on his phone. He squeaks and drops it back on the table as it vibrates in his hand. A message. It could be from anyone. It’s unlikely that it’s Draco, but it could be. And what if it is? What then? Harry is staring at his phone that is face down on his desk; it vibrates again, and Harry almost stands as he jumps in reaction.
The next few weeks are filled with walks in the park, intriguing restaurants, and trips to the cinema – “Yes, I have seen a film before Potter, I’m not that naïve.” They even manage to play a game of quidditch - "Ha! I told you I'd win!"
"Well... I -" Harry had not prepared for this, he felt like he was rapidly losing the debate, "Why do you find her hot?"
"No, no, no, no, no, no." Harry pleas as his friends start to pull him up by him arms. Before anyone can move to let them scramble out from behind the table, Ginny stops them,
"Oh no," and for a brief moment Harry believes he is saved, "if anyone's going to be his wingman, I think I'm far more suited to the job."
It's an awkward angle but he thinks that this is what they both need. Draco shifts away to put his glass down and for a moment Harry thinks he's going to leave; that he's gone too far, pushed their boundaries. But he doesn't. He wraps his arms around Harry and rests his head in the crook of Harry's neck. They sit there and hold each other for what feels like hours. Silence but for the quiet sobs.
“And after everything, she does it anyway. Merlin, I wouldn’t trust this woman with a pair of scissors.”
"Might make it easier to contact each other? Instead of waiting until we accidentally cross paths again." Draco suggests when Harry looks slightly confused at his action.
He likes this seat because it is right in the corner and has the perfect view if the entire café. Ideal for people watching. It's quiet today, which makes sense as Monday morning isn't really prime business time, but it means there are not many people to watch. He scans the room to see a couple of teenagers at one table by the window pointing with excitement at the small dog sitting outside. The only other person in the cafe is the barista behind the counter, who is taking a chance to clean the coffee machine in the quiet. He checks his phone to see if Luna has messaged him but alas, no notifications. She's probably got stuck on the tube or the bus, Harry thinks, he did ask her to meet at short notice. Then he begins to feel guilty for taking up her time, this isn't worth her going out of her way. It seems so minor, maybe he should cancel and work it out by himself?
Harry is sure he's fucked up, now Draco is going to walk away, and Harry will never see him again because he forgot to shut his mouth. Just when he thought that they might even start being friends. That he was actually learning something. Draco's a few meters ahead when he stops and looks over his shoulder at Harry which had just been staring at Draco's back at a loss of what to do.
“How dramatic..” Draco couldn’t hide he was taken aback a bit. He knew his past would follow him.. but this much? Even the media was following him as soon as he got there? He shook his head.
“Dad, do we look like we would cause trouble?” Albus started, shooting a little glare at Scorpius, whom ignored it.
*But he shook his head. “There will be something. Something will go wrong.” His chest was tight. He felt like he was dying, breathing fast and unsteady. Losing track of reality. His eyes began to unfocus, darting around the room out of his control. he heard the faint beeping of an alarm and.. a nurse came in. handing him a tablet. He swallowed it after she convinced him she was really there and trying to help him. His hands were shaking, they felt weird… it took about half an hour before the pill did its work. He calmed down. Hermione stayed with him. Looking at him with sad and regretful eyes that made Draco’s stomach twist.*
He felt a little less tense when he reached the great hall. They seemed to be early. Others had gone to explore the empty halls first. See their old dorms. Draco figured he’d do that tomorrow with Scorpius and the others.. well they didn’t have kids/ their kids didn’t know their dad was Blaise Zabini.
He added the other ingredients. Looking into his spell book every once in a while, adding incantations to the potions. And three hours later, he held up a small vail full of a bright Yellow liquid.  He sighed, taking up the ritual bands, silver bracelets with wolf heads on the ends. These would bind him to finish the promise he made, or hed loose his limbs, it was an old spell, made by long dead Norse warriors, it would make him stronger during his search at night, one hell of a lot stronger and something told him. He might need that. Shaking his head and pinching his nose he drank the potion. Praying he  hadn’t messed up and would drop dead right after he swallowed the last of it.
“We did kind off I suppose. How are you holding up Jackson?” Draco changed the subject. Listening to Jackson ramble on about the ceiling and the floating candles. “You should take him to the greenhouse tomorrow, and to the ground keepers hut. I saw a whole lot of pens out. Hagrid must’ve gotten more animals.” He mused, watching Jacksons eyes light up more.
“Weasley, whatever it is you’ve done, do I look like I have the ability to tell some tabloid about it? I would be cursed before I even set one foot in  the direction of the papers. It’s safe with me. I just need to know what happened in order to find him and convince him its not something you leave your wife and children in distress over. So, by all means. Do tell me.” He hissed it. She had tears rolling down her face. It was clearly bad.. really bad.
A few hours later he was looking fresh after a shower. His hair back up, it was dark out anyway, no one would notice him. He put on his cloak, it was nice to be actually able to wear wizards clothing again. Muggle stuff was comfortable. But it held no nostalgia, it had no familiar feeling and it made Malfoy feel uncomfortably normal. He had been humbled a lot. But he wasn’t a bloody peasant fully yet.
{ Did some thinking. Hermoine from now is a main assistant of the head minister because sister deserves a break sometimes. Also, chapter is a little shorter, I unexpectedly got back to work yesterday and I just really wanted to update the story for you guys. I'm still trying to write everyday even if its just short bits, i wont go below 2000 words promise.
{ a short authors note, this is bit of an introductory chapter, explain what has happened in short. I’ve decided to rewrite my previous work from December. I wasn’t happy with the style and I wasn’t in a good space to write. So this is me redeeming that and making some changes.
When preparing to leave he grabbed Skadi. Daisy was on her way to Scorpius with some presents from him and Astoria and he figured he might want to send his mother a letter too. Once he figured out what to write to her. How to apologize for the lost years.
They walked outside, where Draco let out a soft sigh, untensing his shoulders a little by stretching out. “Surely there has to be another way. I really know I don’t think I can stand a full night of 1. Having to walk around with you. 2. Having people feed into that horrible ego of yours and then 3, the worst of them all, make you come across like a half decent person and not an utter moron.” He grumbled.
“Don’t worry about it. I am a clingy drunk.” Draco muttered. “I’m sorry for you know.. probably making you stay. You don’t have to.”
Draco sighed audibly. He felt stupid doing this but it had to be done. His bands wouldn’t tighten if he was near Potter. In fact when they hung out they got a little looser. The binding spell was horrible for his mental state, his magic and his overall wellbeing. He was unable to function most of the day. Getting no sleep at night. His magic was trying to reach out to Harry constantly. Making any spell he did weak and unpredictable. Last night he had been unable to even pull up a Lumos to get to the bathroom properly. And that’s where he drew the line. He had to move. Even if it was just temporary.
Hermoine seemed lost in thought. “You know what.. this is good. This is great actually. If harry potter and Draco Malfoy can be friends. So can others be with ex death eaters. There’s been a rising amount of attacks on ex members again recently, perhaps this could help. Could you discuss this with him.. its been 20 years. A reunion wouldn’t be a bad idea.”
He shook it off when an old lady stumbled into the living room. She was walking with a cane, her white hair was long and put up in a ponytail. She seemed to be wearing rather traditional clothing. Something you’d see an olden time witch doctor wear in movies.
“Didn’t know you could cook Malfoy, this looks lovely.” Harry smirked tossing back the last of his Gin tonic when Malfoy wasn’t looking.
“How… how about I take care of dinner for you then? We can spend the day apart incase you want to work. But we eat together and sleep somewhat close?” he offered.
Knocking on the door of a single standing, adorable house in some middle class neighborhood. The knocks awoke what sounded like two big dogs. Their barks loud and clear as they came up to the door. Being shushed by Dean, whom opened the door with a young girl on his arms. “Oh you two are early! I was just about to put Jenny to bed, come on in!” he smiled kindly. Jenny seemed to shy away, making her father chuckle as he let the others in. “She’s a bit shy, Seamus is in the kitchen over there, but you can take a seat in the living.” He pointed them to the room, walking upstairs with Jenny. Two old English bulldogs following him.
“If they want to find us. They’ll find us. I don’t care. If you’re gonna die. I am sure as hell not gonna let you die alone.” He reached out, Draco let hem put a hand on his arm. “will you trust me? I won’t let either of us get hurt. But you need to let me prove that to you.” He said, his voice was so gentle.
She gave them another smile, before waving her wand, a bar appearing behind her. As well as the live band Hermione had been bragging about.
“Good to meet you Scorpius, I heard you and Albus have been great friends so far. Not getting into too much trouble I hope?” he tried.
“We’re fine… well at least for the most part.” A sigh of relief fell over the other players. Followed by laughter over the whole ordeal. No major injuries apart from the ribs. Which Dean healed because Draco was in no state to do that himself.
“You know… we should talk.” Harry started, making Draco freeze as he was bout to take a bite of his toast.
Draco snorted. “I’m gonna grab a drink, Have you tried Firewhiskey yet Jackson?” he asked, walking to the bar with them. snorting at the literal flame the other spit out after his first tip. “Swallow faster. I promise its good once you get a hang of it.”
“No I… Why don’t you sit down. I’ll explain what I know.” He tried to not look phased. But he was quite surprised Harry had found him this soon. He didn’t really want to tell him they had to practically stay together as much as possible to avoid getting sicker.
“I didn’t hate him Ron. I suspected him and found him a stuck up prick. And turns out I was right up until I wasn’t.” Harry sounded amused.
Harry snorted. “that ain’t true. I had dinner with him a few weeks ago. He lives up a mountain in Norway I think?  He’s been doing quite well really.” He nodded at Malfoy, raising his glass at him. Malfoy returned it with the same gesture, just smaller before he got pulled back to the conversation, Parkinson seemed to be questioning him now.
“Sod off.” Draco grabbed the phone out of his hands, looking like a grandfather as he attempted to tap the replay button. Listening to it again. Closing his eyes. “I like this song.” He muttered under his breath. Harry stayed silent, watching him, only taking his phone back to play him another one.
“Not asking.” Harry muttered, stumbling to his feet. “Sleep on me all you want but the floor is where I draw the damn line.”
He looked back at the letter. Realizing he should probably read more than just who send it and get distracted by that. “Dinner huh.. fair nuff. I don’t see why we should break the kids up. They’re kids..” he mumbled to the bird, who tilted her head before cawing as if she agreed, making harry let out a soft chuckle. “lemme ask the wife if she’s aight with going so you can get this back ya mean bird.” He said, stumbling to his feed and walking up to Ginny’s bedroom.. They didn’t even sleep together anymore..
While Astoria knows he’s gay, most people do not. He’s not fully come to terms with it and he’s ashamed, feeling like he’s disappointing his family yet again. There will be a line of how mental abuse affects ones life and how it can impact someone. How hard it can be to keep seeking help. If anything like this triggers you, please find another fic. I want this to be a slowburn and a writing practice. I want to add some harsh reality to a normally magical story.
Draco walked on, hearing the next set of footsteps approach. He was definitely in the right spot. Grumbling softly he waited for spells to come his way, which they did. From several angles. He managed to block several, a stinging curse hitting his arm. He swallowed through the pain as he shot his own spells back. He heard rumbling above him. The sound of tables crashing and people screaming.
Draco had long left the wizards district, not that he could quite tell. His mind felt more and more clouded the closer he got. How many trains had he taken? No idea… skadi had hidden herself under his cloak, sitting by his side on his back. He absentmindedly patted her.
When the conversation seemed to come to an end, Harry decided it might be time to ask. “What did Mormor tell you? you seemed quite upset earlier..” He asked it soft enough for Draco to ignore it if he didn’t feel like answering.
So here he was. Taking a big step, moving back to London in secret. He was almost certain Potter suspected at least something was up. He wasn’t looking all to well himself.
No years of muggle therapy could fix what his father had put him though. Draco still tried to blame himself.. but he didn’t have a choice in the matter. It hadn’t been his fault… his father forced him, threatened and manipulated him into doing the most horrible things. He’d been a toy without any identity for his entire childhood. he was only now discovering who he was, his interests and how.. extremely little he and his dad had actually had in common.
“I still can’t believe you never went into the professionals league Harry. You have the natural talent for it. Weren’t you asked to join the leagues?”
They talked for a while once things were a bit more settled. Eventually Ron came in to take his statement on the events. Draco had some food and another nap and had himself discharged right after. Not like they really wanted to keep him.
Harry looked at the ground. Barely registering anything Malfoy was yelling at him. He was free. He took a deep breath, inhaling the cold evening air. Much better than the stuffy room he had been in for however long it had been.
That would have to do. Casual yet formal and to the point. Looking at daisy he sighed. Maybe he should invest in another bird. Daisy was small, and truth be told, she was getting old. She wouldn’t be able to handle another flight to England so soon again. Especially to deliver two letters. And to be really honest… having a buddy around wouldn’t be too bad. He had the space. Plus he was in dire need of a trip to the Norwegian  version of the diagonally  anyway.
It had only been a day or two when Harry got a paper dropped onto his desk. Ginny stood behind him, fuming.
Everything was different here. Some used magic without a wand. Despite using it sparingly they were so powerful and controlled. Draco by now had notes upon notes about the community, their magic and ways of life. It was one of the reasons he stayed where he was located now.
How long had it been? Why had no one come looking? He lifted his gaze. His eyes by now had gotten used to the blurry dark around him. His captors had taken and crushed his glasses a while ago. Not that Harry really cared. He just wanted to go home. Apologize to Ginny for leaving her like that. to his kids for being a shit, selfish dad… fuck they must be worried right? Or maybe Ginny had told them the truth he had left yet again because something wasn’t the way he planned it to be.
Once he was done with setting up the altar at a north facing window he set up his other stuff. Before crashing down on the sofa, taking a two hour nap. He only woke up when Daisy was tapping his window. Holding a letter. Scorpius probably. He had told his son about the move.
Ill be there. The bird did indeed bite. S gonna leave a scar. Thanks for that. Ginny won’t attend. She’s… angry enough you asked.
“And of course Harry Potter has to be talented at everything he does. Sod off you arse.” Draco snickered, sitting back ever so slightly and going into a gallop. “Lean back a little, follow the horse. He called back, watching as Sigyn, who seemed to have fate Harry would stay on speed after him. He chuckled, watching him struggle ever so slightly before getting a hang of it.
“I erm.. I think it might be smart for us to just move in together? Grimmauld is big enough, you could take your own floor. It’s just. We both know we feel better when we sleep closer together. At least until we find out what went wrong with the binding spell.” He could feel the blush spread from his cheeks to his ears. Come on Harry you’re not 16 anymore. Its for the best right.
So about an hour and arguing over the shower later. The used the floo to get to Helve’s barn. Where Draco was met by a big hug from Helve. “I missed you my friend!” the guy whom Harry deemed was Helve said, scrunching up his nose and eyes as he smiled brightly. He was far from ugly and Harry couldn’t help but feel a sharp sting of jealousy. Draco didn’t let most people touch him. They must be close.
He wrote a letter back. As well as a potion recipe Scorpius was unable to find but wanted to try out.  Just as he send out the bird, there was a knock on his door.
“I understand you may get along for our sons sake. Do not get close to that man. If it weren’t for the healing spells I would still have the scars of what he and his buddies did.” She hissed, oh god she really was pissed off now.
“M’ fine.” Was the reply as Draco snaked his hands around Harry’s waste. Squeezing weakly. “Stay with me please.” Harry chuckled. “You are fine, I’ll look out for you.” He whispered, fixing up the mess he’d made of Malfoys hair somewhat before dragging him to bed. Not bothering with sleeping clothes as he let himself get pulled down.
Harry looked at the front line. “the Golden boy involved with ex death eater Malfoy?” was the big headline, a picture under it of him and Malfoy having a smoke standing quite close, smiling.
They got up. Both seemingly a lot happier than before. Draco lifted the silencing spell as they walked back. He left Harry’s side at the entrance, heading back to Pansy and Jackson. Blaise and his partner were missing, probably in a broom closet. The pair gave him a knowing look. “I take you made up?” Pansy asked softly.
“You won’t have to do better Harry. I’m sick of it. This really was the last straw.. I can’t take this any longer. You don’t love me. I’m not even sure I love you anymore.. and…” She was sobbing at this point. There was no calming her anymore. She was too far gone. It took her a few minutes to find the right words and when she did… “I..it… There’s another man. I would say im sorry but I am not. I felt alone, betrayed. And then Ron told me about you and Malfoy out of all people being buds and speaking of forgiveness..”
Harry laughed. “Can you please leave potter with me for a bit. I’d like to have a word.” Draco hummed, some guy opened his mouth but Potter Quickly shot him a “But of course, we do have all evening to catch up with everyone else.” He looked quite ashamed to even ask it from the others. But they seemed to take it.
Of course he knew Draco wouldn’t feel the same. He didn’t even know if he was gay. He just needed someone to be there for him. To accept him and care. Harry would enjoy and provide for that job until it ended. He would dread the day it would end and hoped that day wouldn’t come soon.
“So you’re actually taking his side now Harry?! What’s wrong with you!  You know I put up with everything you do. You’re never here, and when you are you’re up here. Filing those damn rapports!” she was screaming at this point, her face as red as her hair. Harry really fucked up this time.
It hadn’t been easy, life after the war. Lawsuits, families falling apart, families being hunted down and murdered… it had been heartbreaking to watch.
“I don’t care you are telling me what is up so I can return him like a lost dog Weasley. Its not just your Kids upset. Its mine too.” Malfoy hissed, that was the final straw for her to just let him in.
Harry wouldn’t be the one to tell Draco that he had agreed and rudely invited himself and the others to Ron’s because “They were close and no one was in a state to apperate home safe”. And how Hermoine paired them anyway because that would look right and trustworthy.
So that’s what he was looking forward too. he had picked a lovely dark blue suit. It was in just a week and he was really looking forward to it. Hermione told him not to be as excited and to not expect too much. But Harry couldn’t help it. The binding spell hadn’t been lifted, that’s what a healer had told him when he went to see them. he had been feeling miserable, horrible and dreadful, like a piece of him was missing.
Blaise, for once seemed to be caring too. Not the “I could care less, I was forced to go”  Blaise he normally was. He actually seemed excited to go.. He had taken a young witch with him, the bastard, she clung to his side like he was god himself.
"Walk with me?" Draco asks quietly, looking back to Harry for an answer. And he finds that he can't say no. That he doesn't want to say no.
Draco laughs, hard. His breathing begins to slow, and he smiles brightly at Harry. Yes, Harry thinks. Yes, that's a sight to behold.
"I'm sorry." Draco says almost a whisper, still looking away from Harry. And Harry thinks he sees a tear fall down his cheek.
It’s a Saturday evening and they are both slouched on Harry’s couch with a nonsensical film gracing the television screen. Harry is smiling and trying to hold back his laughter as Draco has a running commentary throughout the poorly constructed film.
"I think," Ron began, sounding like he was adding an important argument in this discussion, "she's really hot."
There's a significant pause before anyone speaks as Harry is unsure how to converse with his ex-rival-come-acquaintance. What do you ask someone who you haven't spoken to for literal years?
Oh Merlin, this was getting awfully confusing, and now his tea was cold. He gets up and goes to the sink, tips out his tea and decides to up the caffeine intake as he boils the kettle. He makes a coffee and checks through his phone. Maybe it was time to call in for some help.
Harry glances around the group, cheeks burning now, but no ones eyes are on him and it seems their moment had gone unnoticed. But Harry noticed.
"Because you're "The Boy Who Lived", "The Chosen One", you're the best Auror of our time. And I'm a - flower boy."
It's exactly one week later and Harry is back at the Leaky Cauldron with everyone but Neville, who had got caught up at work late and might not be able to make it. Somehow, they were discussing the best food they had used as ammunition in their years at Hogwarts and all is normal. Harry starts making his argument for profiteroles working as mini cream cannon balls when that blonde that Harry has been trying to push out of his thoughts saunters right up to their table and smiles that stupidly perfect smile, acting as if it is totally normal for him to be there.
"It's alright, I think I've cried the alcohol out of my system." Draco crooks out and smiles wearily.
Ron paused, looked at Harry, opened his mouth, closed it again and then looked away. Harry remembered it so clearly as Ron had looked at him with a face of utter bemusement. That face represented everything Harry felt when he tried to comprehend 'Sexy'. Ron had begun to gesture vaguely in front of him as if he had a graph that he was using as a reference.
"And then I saw Draco again. And I've never reacted like this with someone. Like, I'm physically attracted to him. I want to fuck him? I've never actively wanted a person. I'm just, I was so happy that I finally had an explanation and now I've gone and mixed it up again." Harry breathes, he had spoken so quickly and forgotten to pause properly, "sorry, that was probably too much information."
Harry is taken aback for a second because he honestly blanks on his own hobbies, what does he do? He cooks, works, drinks coffee and oh,
“I – I didn’t know. But you’re right. She is good. She’s the best mother I could ask for.” Draco adds and Harry notices his eyes glisten slightly with a sheen of water.
"I think what I'm trying to say is, I don't find people 'sexy'. I've never found anyone 'sexy'. I feel like I don't know what it even means sometimes." Harry manages to finally form the words and then the table falls into silence and he feels like he's made such a fool of himself. What a stupid thing to say, he should have stayed quiet, he's not even making any sense. Or at least that's what he thinks until Luna breaks the quiet.
They return to telling stories, about nights at the Leaky gone wrong and their most embarrassing Hogwarts tales and even what they had for lunch in the week. They talk about anything and everything and before they know it, they’ve been sitting in the café for hours.
But that didn't matter. He didn't need a map. He didn't need to know the route because he had spent most of his teenage years trying not to die. And Harry would have rather had a map to the horcruxes than to sexual appeal. Now that Harry isn't running into life threatening circumstances at every corner, he's starting to wonder if he'll ever learn to read that map because now, he doesn't feel lost. Harry feels like he's not even on the map and its almost more confusing than before.
When exactly, Harry thought, had he lost control of the situation? At what moment had he allowed Malfoy to take the upper hand? At which point had he abandoned the plans he had laid, the desire to put Malfoy off balance? But most importantly, when had Harry started to really, REALLY, like Malfoy being in control.
He crossed his arms and turned his face from the other man's. Harry was well aware that he was pouting but he didn't care. He had felt wrong footed by Malfoy all day. Wrong footed and aroused. It was all becoming too much.
The waves of pleasure flooding through Harry's body were nothing short of delicious. He couldn't decide what he wanted more, to thrust up into Draco's hand or to push back onto his fingers. When Draco lightly stroked his prostate, a wild noise of approval was torn from Harry.
Harry finally tore his eyes from the blonde's. Draco was fully hard. His cock was perfect. Not too long, not too thick but almost so and with a tantalizing drop of precum leaking from the tip. Harry's mouth watered, it actually watered! at the sight before him. He leaned forward and licked tentatively at the tip, gathering the bit of moisture on his tounge. The taste was electric, like something Harry had longed for without even knowing he wanted.
But whatever Harry meant to say was lost as Draco pressed forward. His thick cock stretched Harry's opening as he pressed forward in one slow, smooth stroke. The burn was delicious. It was pain and pleasure all rolled into one and Harry exhaled a long breath as Draco bottomed out.
It was 7:59, 7:59 and 3 seconds to be exact. Harry knew that because he had being casting a tempus charm about every 7 seconds for the past 5 minutes. He ran a hand through this already hopelessly messy hair. He was the head of the Auror department for Merlin's sake! He had looked evil in the eyes without flinching. There was absolutely no reason for his palms to be sweating and his leg to be bouncing nervously as he waited for 8pm.
Harry's voice was so sincere. Draco could hear the hope and pain in it. The brunette's use of his given name jarred Draco at the same as it soothed him. That one simple word, those two glorious syllables, meant more to Draco than the entire contents of the Malfoy Gringott's vault. They spoke of redemption, of the love of someone he believed to be beyond his grasp.
Draco pushed roughly with both hands and Harry fell back onto his chair. The blond stood above him, fully clothed, the very picture of composure. Harry was in complete opposition. He was sprawled inelegantly on supple leather, his nakedness leaving him exposed, on display. He let out a whimper, arousal evident in his eyes.
Draco chuckled before answering in a low voice that went straight to Harry's cock. "Now where would be the fun in that?"
"Oh fuck yes!" Draco panted as he thrust forward and spent himself as deep within Harry as he could get.
"What do you want, Malfoy?" Harry ground out as he ripped his eyes away from the lean, muscled body in front of him.
"You like that? You like when I fuck your mouth?" Draco panted. Harry hummed again, drawing  a ragged moan from the slytherin's throat.
"Or maybe......" Draco took a shaky breath before leaning in continuing in a whisper in his ear. "Maybe you know I'm not afraid of you. That I'm just the right kind of dangerous to give you what you need."
Their lips crashed together, more desperate this time, tongues swirling together. Harry's hands flew over Draco's body taking in the contours of his shoulder blades, the small dip of his back above his buttocks.
When Draco was spent, Harry pulled back slowly, a thin thread of spit and cum connecting his mouth to the tip of the slowly deflating cock in front of him.
Harry laid back and did just that. His whole body relaxed, he opened himself to whatever was being offered. Draco pulled his fingers back and added a third. The burn of the intrusion was lessened by the hand now slowly stroking his prick.
"I won't ever beg you for anything." Harry said trying and failing to sound firm and strong. He knew his words held little power, the needy tone in his voice evident to both men.
Harry growled and resisted the urge to point his wand at the git's face. "We were never chums, Malfoy. And I can't imagine what we could possibly have to say to eachother."
Harry's eyes snapped to Draco's face. The other man was licking his lips in anticipation. Harry's gaze moved higher and locked in on Draco's eyes.
"On your knees, Potter" Draco slowly started rubbing himself from base to tip as he gently pushed on Harry's shoulder.
"I think, Potter, my further demands might be better facilitated outside of The Ministry" Draco's voice was quiet as he ran his thumb down  Harry's jawbone.
"Never you mind, Your Scariness." Draco was cold, so very cold. It had nothing to do with the temperature. He had tried so hard to do as The Dark Lord had commanded. He knew that his "mission" was nothing but punishment for his father's failures. The disgusting mark on his arm was nothing but buying time for himself and his mother. He would die, Voldemort would murder him for nothing more than being who he was. Death at Potter's hand would have been preferable to this drawn out fear. "Just get out."
The floo chimed and turned green. Harry turned to face it, a look of shock on his face. A perfectly composed Draco Malfoy stepped into his study. He looked around the room, silver eyes scanning over the entire place. Finally, he turned to gaze at Harry. He took in the rumpled clothing, the disheveled hair, the hands flexing at the other man's sides. The side of Draco's mouth curved up in what might have been an attempt at his trademark smirk but was softened somehow.
Draco chuckled in the back of his throat. "Climb in." He said as he lifted the thin infirmary blanket and shuffled to the other side of the bed. "I do believe we have wasted enough time already, Harry."
"No." Draco cut him off. "I am not worthy of you, but I intend to become so." Draco raised his eyes and looked at Harry through his lashes, "with your help."
"You aren't an auror. You wouldn't understand." Harry said. He hoped the angry tone of his voice would cover for the lame retort.
Harry didn't hesitate. He wholeheartedly agreed with the sentiment. He climbed into bed with Draco and thin, pale arms enveloped him immediately. He tilted his his head up and brought his lips to the the other boy's. As Draco tilted his head and deepened the kiss, Harry hummed in contentment. It was a kiss six years in the making.
"Oh when I'm good" Malfoy said stalking towards the other man. "I'm extraordinarily good." He grabbed Harry's chin and turned his head. When gray eyes met green, he continued. "But when I'm bad, I'm even better."
"I...." Draco swallowed and pressed on with a courage he never knew he had. "What do you want.....Harry?" The name felt foreign on his tonge, but tasted like forever.
Draco began to nip at Harry's bottom lip as he slid his hand slowly up and down the length of his cock. As he slid his thumb over the weeping head, Harry moaned into his mouth.
"I hardly think they will be of any assistance now." Draco said before opening his mouth wide and taking Harry's hard prick into his mouth.
Harry realized his jaw was hanging open and snapped it shut. He pursed his lips and Malfoy, the git, tilted his head to the side in mock innocence.
Draco pulled Harry to his feet, his breaths coming in short pants. He grasped the brunette's weeping prick in a long fingered hand and began stroking furiously. Harry let out a needy moan as he rested his forehead against the other man's.
Draco laughed. The simple action seemed to transform him. His rigid posture relaxed. The hard angles of his face seemed to soften. He was handsome before, sexy. But now he was.......
Draco pulled off Harry's cock with a wet popping sound. "Oh no you dont, Potter." His voice was gravelly and Harry shuddered knowing exactly why. "You will not come until I'm inside you, until I'm deep inside that perfect arse of yours. I'll have you begging me for release before the night is through."
"Well, well" the blond in front of him spoke "it would appear we have far more interesting subjects to discuss than gold and artifacts afterall" Malfoy's gaze flicked to Harry's crotch as he sucked in his bottom lip. The robes did nothing to obscure the growing bulge between his legs. "See something you like, Potter?"
"Fine. What is it you want?" As Head Auror he had some negotiating power and he did believe Draco's family got a raw deal.
"We shall see. You know I have never backed down from a challenge.  At least not from you." Draco drawled. He stood and extended his arm to Harry. "Take me to your bedroom."
Harry grasped the offered hand and rose. He walked towards his bedroom, all too aware that Draco still had his fingers threaded through his own. He could feel the blond's eyes raking over his naked form, the arousal coming off him in waves.
"It has been a while, hasn't it?" Draco's voice purred. "You're so tight. You're almost dragging me in. I can't wait to get my cock inside you. I'm gonna make you feel so good."
Harry had been thinking about it for a while now. He had always been drawn to Malfoy. The blond had always known exactly what to say and do to get under his skin. Harry had spent the better part of the year following the other boy, telling everyone he was only doing it because he knew he was up to something. But in reality, Harry wanted to help him, to protect him. There was just something about Malfoy. He knew Harry on a level nobody else did. And so Harry gathered every ounce of his Gryffindor courage and spoke.
Not thinking, Harry slid his arms around Malfoy's back. He pulled the other man closer as he tilted his head to the side, deepening the kiss. Draco's lips felt like velvet on his and he tasted of rain. Before he could help himself he let out a soft moan as he felt Malfoy press his erection into his hip.
Draco looked into Harry's eyes. They looked bright and full of life in the pale moonlight. For a moment he allowed himself to believe. But then he threw his head back to his pillow in mirthless laugh.
"It's alright, Flo. It seems Mr. Malfoy has something important to discuss. Please hold my owls until further notice." Harry's voice remained calm, although he was anything but.
Harry's brain seemed to short out as he was pulled towards the blond.  He couldn't even think of moving as he felt lips brush against his own. The scent that was Draco was making him dizzy.....and hungry. And oh fuck, harder.
"For Merlin's sake, Potter!" Draco said losing his composure. "You almost killed me! You should have let me die. I want to die!"
