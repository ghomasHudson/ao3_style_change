“Fleur DeLacour, daughter of the known Death Eaters, Apolline and Pierre DeLacour?” Draco interrupted her calmly, folding his arms across his chest as he met her gaze and held it. Her mouth dropped open in shock as the
“Why should ‘e complain?” Madame Maxime scoffed loudly, folding her arms across her broad chest as she fixed a glare on the subject of their discussion. Draco couldn’t blame him for flinching. “’E ‘as been given ze chance to compete, ‘as the ‘e? My students ‘ave all been ‘oping to be chosen for weeks and this…this little boy usurps them like zis? It is completely unfair! I demand,

Draco’s eyes flew open as he climaxed with a shocked grunt, only just catching himself in time to stop a loud cry bursting forth from his mouth and revealing what he had been doing.
It was the boys who led the way, armed with staff’s which sparked upon impact with the ground as they performed a manly display of testosterone which left quite a few people, Draco included, a little bit hot under the colour. They finished by blowing magical flames up into the air, shaped like dragons and snakes, just as their female counterparts entered the room, striding calmly through the flames looking both mysterious, glamourous and aloof.
There was no sign of the storm from the night before, in fact the sky was unusually bright and clear for the time of year, so Harry was perfectly comfortable until the breakfast bell rang. He could easily picture Ron snorting in his sleep, disturbed by the familiar noise bug unwillingness to wake up as happened every single morning. He imagined that Hermione would have been up almost as long as he himself had been, probably visiting the library.
It was one such dream which had left him wide awake at four o'clock that morning, unable to return to sleep with the sensations thrumming through his body and a telltale dampness inside his pyjamas. He'd dealt with the mess, using a simple cleaning charm to remove any and all evidence, but there had been nothing he could do to calm his body down enough to get a couple more hours sleep; hence his already exhausted state during their first lesson.
Putting it from his mind until he had more time to ponder on what his subconscious had done he set about getting himself ready for the evening meal and the ceremony which would follow as quickly as possible. He selected a fresh uniform, unaired that his hair was completely dry with a quick flick of his wand and styled to hang artfully around his face.
He wanted to become a Healer, a difficult task in of itself, but as he wanted to specialise in Mind Healing he needed to achieve top grades in order to get onto the courses he needed.
He can hear Potter striding after him, his trainers slapping against the flagstones.
'Oh yes, thankyou dear...Well. He's certainly polite.'
Still. It's a bit of a shock when the other boy comes in his hand, gasping against Harry's mouth, his fingers tight in the back of Harry's hair. Harry catches his lip between his teeth, bites down, kisses him hard and it's very satisfying that for a long moment Draco doesn't have the coordination to kiss him back.
''S your name isn't it?'
'Merry Christmas.' He says quietly, into his pyjama t-shirt. And Draco glances at the floor but Harry feels him squeeze his fingers back, tightly. He doesn't let go for a long minute.
He'd expected Potter to hex the shit out of him, if he's honest, that day in the changing rooms. He has dreamt, waking and sleeping, of having Potter's mouth on his, his hands in his hair, his cock a hard solid promise against his thigh, for such a long time now that it felt like the last thing to resolve between them, the absolute last thing Draco had to lose. And Potter's eyes had been on him since they first stepped back into the Great Hall on the first of September, Draco wasn't wrong about that, and finally being alone with him and having that inscrutable gaze on him was too much. Potter had never been inscrutable to him before, never. He wanted to break him. Wanted Potter to return the favour.
'Why would I be staring at you?'
'Dobby. That's brilliant, I can't wait to see it.' He says warmly and Dobby grins his brightest grin yet:
'Dobby. Could you
They slip inside. Draco drops his bag on the floor more dramatically than he needs to and tries not to react when Potter gestures vaguely around the room and a handful of candles in the creaking chandelier above them twist and shimmer into life. Just enough light to make out the plane of Potter's jaw in the dark; his glasses. The soft-looking jumper he's zipped over his t-shirt.
Definitely a shower.
'Good thing you're not a Chaser.' Harry notes dryly, and the other boy narrows his eyes at him.
in their house? With their
Harry swallows, heavily:
'Renewed my Quidditch Monthly subscription.' Harry lies, shoving the gloves quickly into his bag before Hermione can get a good look at them. 'I needed new ones.'
Harry stifles his grin at Hermione's eye-roll. She's been tremendous through all of this, considering. He wonders if Draco remembers how good her aim is and is behaving himself accordingly.
'...Right.' Potter says, again in that unfamiliar voice. Then, Draco watches as he comes back over to him. Careful, even steps across the stained and blackened flagstones.
Harry feels his heart thump against his ribcage.
Harry ducks a flapping arm: 'Draco! What the h
rings dully in the sudden, gaping silence.
'Oh. Same.' Harry returns, and doesn't even know if he's lying. He presses his fingertips to Draco's warm face. Draco closes his eyes.
For some bizarre reason, Harry's face is hot. He blames the dormitory fire, which (he now notices) has been freshly stoked and the mantlepiece garlanded in holly.
.' Harry hears Draco exhale and lifts his head, fitting his hand around the other boy's jaw and kissing his mouth again.
Potter shrugs.
'—You think I don't know that?' Draco snaps, with painful irony. He tugs at his clothes, trying to straighten them up a bit.
calling me that.' Draco snaps, and his voice snaps too, like rotted elastic. So much for nonchalance. Potter raises his eyebrows. Waves his fingers one more time to give them a little more light then drops his arm to his side.
, Dobby?' Draco echoes. 'Bit invasive
' despite everything, he can feel himself flushing. It's weird explaining his love-life to Dobby. 'He's- he's my boyfriend. We were. We were...Asleep together.'
Potter doesn't begin with kissing him this time. He closes the last inches between them and reaches across and puts his fingertips to Draco's stomach. Draco can feel the heat of his skin through the thin fabric of his school shirt. He stares at Potter's face, but Potter's watching his own hands like he isn't quite in control of them, drawing them down to push behind the waistband of Draco's trousers and curl around his belt. He tightens his grip and pulls him closer and Draco closes his eyes without meaning to: at the scent of the other boy in his nostrils again; the smell of him that is now always poisoned with smoke and scorched flesh and blood that tastes like gold under his tongue. He exhales and feels how close Potter's mouth is. His knuckles lodged against Draco's hipbones. He drops his head and maybe their noses brush.
. But: no. Instead, he sets off obediently towards the next staircase. He makes it down the spiral and along another corridor and is only two corners away from the entrance to the common room when he slows abruptly at the sudden, impossible touch of fingers at his arm.
But he's just tugging awkwardly at the clasp of his cloak, still fastened around his neck. He gets it in a moment; chucks it towards the benches where it lands in a pile then slithers to the floor.
'Everybody knows this. Shut up Dobby.'
'I. I have no idea. Half past two, but...'
'Oh, sweetheart.' She says. 'No need for that. No need for that...' And she pulls him into a hug, which Harry returns helplessly, wrapping his arms around her. He's got a good four inches on her now and has to stoop a bit.
Dobby is glad he arrived before Harry Potter suffered some deathly injury
He stands, swiping uselessly at his knee, and jumps as the changing room door thumps against the wall again.
'A wonder McGonnagall hasn't apparated down here—'
Draco stares at him. He's vaguely aware the other students
'But Dobby.' He says, pushing a hand back through his hair. Now the drama's over and everyone has their feet back on a solid surface, he notices how dark it still is outside, snow glittering at the window. 'Why are you in my dormitory in the middle of the night, anyway?'
Could you let him down?'
'Dobby, come on!
'Don't worry. I'm just going.' He assures him pointedly, and returns to tugging at his bootlaces.
'Nice gloves.' Ron says through a mouthful of toast a few days later, nodding at them.
Harry thinks he's almost giving himself a hernia trying not to laugh.
I'm-I'm glad to hear it
His skin looks so warm in the flick-snapping glow of the torch-light.
It doesn't take very long. Draco's very efficient.
'Think he's a bit scared of you all.' He says wryly and catches Mrs Weasley's incredulous eye as she passes him the final plate. 'Oh, I
'I...I mean, he drives me up the wall--'
'Don't you dare—' Draco manages and rolls his eyes when Harry ignores him and wipes his hand off on the thigh of his no-doubt-expensive trousers.
'Mr Malfoy.' Slughorn's voice rumbles behind him, and he doesn't even sound angry. Just bored. But he gives Draco a detention anyway, sorting out the potions supplies for the second year's swelling solution.
. But every now and again Draco glances up and catches the old bastard looking at him, something tight pulled across his fleshy forehead. Draco wishes he had the nerve to stare back at him when he does this, but he doesn't. Not anymore. He never thought he'd be sick of attention.
'Not to you.' Draco glowers.
and without Bellatrix's dagger embedded in his chest, which has got to be a bonus. He's still wearing a bizarre assortment of clothes and kitchen fabrics but, it's fair to say, he seems to be getting a better grip on the co-ordination thing. The shiny, embroidered waistcoat he has draped around his shoulders very nearly matches one of the six (Harry counts) socks he's wearing on his shoe-less feet.
'Quiet boy.' Mrs Weasley says, frowning at her reflection in the newly squeaky-clean plate. Harry catches it out of the air and dries it on his tea-towel, adding it to the pile on his other side.
'God I hate you.' Draco says eventually, so quietly.

Harry blinks at her. Chews the inside of his lip.
although Harry thinks he sees his eye twitch, like it pains him a little.
'--Oh, and you imagine being married to Arthur is very relaxing?' Mrs Weasley returns and Harry laughs. 'But..?'

of terror and a sudden blast of wintery air as his bed covers are catapulted across the room to flump dejectedly against the Gryffindor tower window.
'Dobby is sorry Harry Potter!' The house-elf's plaintive voices carries, and Harry casts wildly around till he finds Dobby again, now standing on the armchair crammed into the corner beside the door. He looks wretched. 'Dobby would never hurt Harry Potter on purpose
'No, he is that.' Harry agrees with a straight face and ducks as Draco flails a foot at him:

'Young Master Malfoy has a long history with Harry Potter.' He declaims darkly, eventually, narrowing his eyes. Harry glances at Draco, who is rubbing his elbow and attempting to hold the house-elf's accusatory glare.
'Oh have yourself a souvenir Potter. Go on.' He snaps. The spite comes easier than it ever has, which is saying something, and Potter rolls his eyes and drops his arm and Draco turns on his heel and storms away. He'll have missed the rotation on the second floor staircase and he'll definitely be late for Arithmancy now, but of course it doesn't matter. None of it
There are two slips of paper attached to the leg of the owl that's landed next to his breakfast. One has Harry's own writing on it, a note he regretted almost as soon as he sent it:
'Can you take those off?' He nods at Harry's face and Harry realises he means his glasses. He thinks, yeah: kissing is probably alot more comfortable without a bit of metal digging into his nose. Without them, he has to step a little bit closer to see how oddly Draco's looking at him.
. This is all dragon shit anyway.
'...When's your team coming down?'
'Thanks for all this Molly.' He says quietly. 'I know it's. I know it's...' Unexpectedly, he feels his throat start to tighten and presses his lips together, looks away. Of course, Mrs Weasley notices immediately and comes across and takes him by his shoulders, staring concernedly into his face, which just makes it worse. Harry pulls his glasses off and pushes his hand across his eyes.
What he didn't say to Hermione, however, was that the emotions he'd attached to Malfoy had never really made sense. Even now.
Hermione said that it was to be expected, after all they'd been through. Difficult emotions attached to trauma—Hogwarts was no longer just school to them; the other pupils were no longer just their classmates. Harry could see the sense in that.
He lets go of Harry's wrist and doesn't look away as Harry finishes unbuttoning him and pushes his hand inside his underwear.
'...What?' Potter sighs. He sounds knackered.
They stare at each other, chests heaving.
'Merry Christmas Harry.'
God, the last tournament they played feels like decades ago.
'...Do you want...?' His eyes tick downwards, and before Harry can reply his right palm presses against Harry's aching groin and Harry wants very badly to say no and doesn't.
“No,” Narcissa countered. She glanced down at her son before answering softly. “I visited my parents today, to let them know about our leaving the country. And then I fell over.”
Whatever else the portrait might have said was drowned out by a wall of noise.

Fabian, it seemed, was being comforted by his boyfriend. He didn’t look angry or jealous, like the girls, but he was obviously disappointed. On the other JJ, his boyfriend, looked more relieved than anything else. Whether that was for himself or for his boyfriend remained to be seen. Nina offered Draco a blinding smile, truly pleased for him, even as her arm was wrapped around Adelaide who somehow managed to look pleased for Draco but sad for herself. Jan actually crossed the room to shake Draco’s hand, congratulating him whilst simultaneously offering him a flirtatious smile which was acknowledged but not returned.

“Have you heard from Andromeda at all?  I… we were talking about my family the other day, we wondered if she’d like to come visit my parent’s graves.  They’re buried in the distant back corner of the yard.  This was their house. I suppose she might still be upset with me, for choosing Bella over her in this whole fiasco.”  Narcissa shook her head looking somewhat distant. “I can’t excuse my actions, being so shortsighted, but Bellatrix was so young you know, I felt responsible for her.  Though, I’m not sure what that says about me given how she turned out.”  Narcissa stated and looked truly worn.  She sipped her tea quietly lost in thought.
The trio apparated just around the corner from Dragon Heart, and when the entrance came into view, they were surprised to see just how many people were lined up to enter, excitedly chattering while waiting for their turn to gain entrance.
“Listen to this Ron. Mr. Potter, we are very sorry to hear about the unfortunate split with your school sweetheart. Please accept these passes to our grand reopening of Dragon Heart, the all inclusive club with the new alphabet mafia vip club upstairs. Now expanded to include all of the letters in the lgbtq. In these times of confusion and division, all of us in the alphabet mafia, be they l or g or t or any of the other letters, should stick together and pave the way to a better, more unified wizarding world. Don’t you agree? Please bring whoever you like and enjoy a fun night out and meet some new interesting people, and enjoy yourself and our services.” Harry read off the note. He flashed three vip passes to the trendy new club.
"I know dinner isn't finished this fast," he said.
Draco’s shoulders lifted in a gallic shrug and he simply nodded.  “If you insist on it Potter.  If you insist.  Don’t forget though, that I’ve seen it before, or is your memory that short?”  Draco volleyed back enjoying the game.
“Yeah, this isn’t too bad.  I can heal this no problem.”  Draco went to his desk and pulled out his wand from a lock box in the top drawer.  Hermione stood to the side as Draco scanned and diagnosed, then healed Ron and Harry.
Slowly and deliberately, Harry reached up with both hands and skimmed just his thumbs over Draco's beautifully pink cheekbones. He stopped just before Draco's ears, his fingers buried in silky blond hair.
“I think that I have a crush on Harry Potter.”  Draco frowned severely, hacking at the skin of the potato trying to work out his nerves.
“Oh Draco, who bloody cares what other people have to say about it?”  Narcissa shook her head.  “I’d say that if you're falling in love with that boy then tell him about it.  He’s been through a lot, the poor thing.  It’s tragic really.  So if he gives you any notion that he returns your feelings then bloody well grab the bull by the horns and go for it.”  She shrugged, giving in and laughing at his absurd uncomfort at the idea of being gay.
Harry, not really paying attention, reached out and barely skimmed his fingertip over Sirius' name. Suddenly their names began to glow.  A white light filled the room and Harry, Draco, & Severus closed their eyes to the brightness.   When the light cleared there was a door in the middle of the tapestry.   Draco blinked at the Sight and looked to his former teacher for wisdom.   Before anyone could do anything,  the door opened up and There stood Sirius Black.
"Of course," Harry said. "Kreacher?"
“I had actually considered this already. I sent Blaise some statistics to crunch and see if it would be a safe risk. I’m waiting to hear on how much of a risk it is and what all would be involved in opening the back part up to all the letters of the alphabet.”
“Don’t play innocent darling, you're terrible at it.” Pansy intoned dryly sipping her tea.
Harry drew in a sharp breath as Draco found what he was reaching for and started teasing lightly with a fingertip.
"Although," Harry mumbled only for Draco to hear, "after what I saw this morning, I would be the one choking."
Harry stood transfixed, torn between wanting to stare and wanting to look away. He had to make sure his mouth wasn’t hanging open.
“I'm not sure, but I think it means that I’m definitely in love with you.”  Draco stated as he brought his lips to meet Harry’s.
“Well why did you then?” Ron asked, wiping tears of laughter out of his eyes.
“No, it was on fancy paper with your club’s logo.  I just assumed it was the manager wanting to capitalize on my fame, but you certainly didn’t need that.  There was plenty of press out front.”  Harry shrugged.
"Please, Harry," Draco begged. "I need your cock inside me."
“I’m really proud of you Draco.  You’ve really come a long way since Hogwarts.”  Hermione said warmly.  “Thank you for saving these two for me.”  She added.
“We’re fine mate, it’s not like that. She just thought it might be fun if we explored a little with other people, but not individually. Together. Like a third wheel or whatever. She explains it better. Sounds like fun though so I’m all for it. If it happens just once in a while after all. Hermione loves me, and I trust her. So, if she says this will be good for us, then it probably will.” Ron got back to his feet.
We don't own any of these characters. They belong to J.K. Rowling.
"Come on, Harry," he said. "Fuck me now."
They hurriedly dressed and headed down to eat the meal knowing there was no way out of it.  Snape had a few questions about Sirius’s records and the tapestry.  He’d found several references to it in the books.  Grudgingly the two men followed Snape into Sirius' old den and starred at the Black family tapestry.

"I don’t fall into such patterns and I don’t encourage them either.  I would have thought you of all people would get that.  How much have you hated being shoved into a certain box your entire life? How often were the expectations people had of you based on their assumptions of those same stereotypes harmful and completely inaccurate?”  He countered with a pointed expression.  Ron was sufficiently chagrined and held up his hands in surrender.
At first, his friends couldn’t understand why he’d want to mark himself, but he explained to them how each one held meaning and helped him to heal. Then they understood.  Ron had even gone and gotten a magical portrait of Fred.  The tattoo Fred ever as mischievous as the real Fred had been was often seen peeking out of the collar of Ron’s shirts, pinching his brother in the neck whenever he had something to say, or whispering in his ear.
Gasping, Harry shook his head. "I know you're not innocent." He pushed his fingers into Draco's hair. "But I don't want her in our bed."
"Fine," Harry grinned, following the blond.
They’d been right of course, and just like that, Pansy had weaseled her way into every muggle high fashion magazine. Simply by dressing Draco for his private functions.  That 9 out of 10 times,  Blaise arranged, organized and catered.  Paving the way for them to build their bar.
When Draco was spent, he reached down, wiped up the mess with his finger, and sucked it clean. Harry's eyes widened at the sight and before he could do anything, Draco pulled away and got on all fours, waiting.
Thank you for reading! See ya next time!
“No pants Potter?  Hoping to get lucky were we?  You naughty boy.”  Draco murmured huskily as he bit the soft skin behind Harry’s ear.
Hermione and Ron got to their feet as Pansy herself appeared in the doorway to Draco’s office.  She tossed a jacket to Draco who caught it with one hand.
“I could have gone my whole life without seeing that!” he mumbled, embarrassed.
"Definitely," Harry agreed with Draco then gave Hermione a brief hug. "Thanks again for this," he said.
“What do I intend to do about what?” Draco feigned innocence.
"No," Ginny pouted. "I'm afraid to. What if she laughs in my face or something?" She seemed oblivious to Draco's activities.
"Yes, now that you three have opened it up, it will remain open until the high king closes it.  Come on, there's much to discuss."  Sirius reiterated.   Draco shared a look with Harry and Severus.

Draco sat in his study reading through his father's old logs until he was bleary eyed.  He hadn’t seen anything unusual or useful yet.  He was determined to get to the bottom of it.  Something in his gut told him that he absolutely had to protect Harry Potter.  The blonde couldn’t make sense of it, but if it put an end to all this, he’d do anything.  Just then the floo flared and his mother stepped out.
“How do you mean?”  Draco asked in response, furrowing his eyebrows in uncharacteristic confusion.  He relaxed back in his desk chair kicking his feet up onto the desk and stretching out.  “I find them very enjoyable.  You must mean your relatives don’t you?  I take it they weren’t very nice people.  You don’t need to tell me unless you want to.  Second, you really don’t mind being around me?  It’s not the least bit awkward for you considering we hated each other growing up?”    The blonde asked with a raised eyebrow and a slight grin of disbelief.

Unfortunately the same could not be said about the rest of them so when Javier himself was the one upset or in a foul mood it took them a little longer to pinpoint the reason and find a solution. “Honestly, if they're as brainwashed as your parents think they are then they probably won't want to talk to you anyway.

No, it wasn’t the first time his subconscious had decided who he would picture whilst pleasuring himself but it was the first time it had decided upon the as yet unidentified Hogwarts student whose crush was becoming so obvious to him.

It was vastly different to the milk and cereals, toast or “full English breakfasts” that the Hogwarts students were devouring.

It was also the first room they had entered when boarding, the exterior door admitting them into the room which could have been plucked out of their school with the intricate wall mouldings, the cavernous painted ceiling, the lush carpet and delicate looking sofas, chairs and even a chaise lounge.

A quick glance towards the Slytherin table as they entered the Great Hall unfortunately proved otherwise, the glamorous fourteen year old checking her makeup on a compact mirror. It didn't look like she'd gotten wet at all, not even when she was outside in the rain.
Unable to hold it back he let out a single, choked off sob.
Draco rolled his eyes towards her fondly, knowing full well that she wasn't implying that they'd miss him, rather that she was implying that he would need them and as much as it pained him to do so even just to himself she was probably right. As much as his parents had done their best to raise him to be good and honourable, something they had never been encouraged to be, he had still suffered from an alarming amount of jealousy and arrogance, particularly after he'd hit puberty. His mind had been conflicted, torn between the behaviour he'd been taught growing up and the unpleasantness growing within him but neither of his parents had been upset with him. When he'd gone to them, confused, they'd explained that unfortunately both jealousy and arrogance were traits of both their families.

“Fancy not even getting his name right, Weasley,” she crowed, smirking over her shoulders at her loyal followers and cronies. “It’s almost as though he’s a complete nonentity, isn’t it?”
“Oh, shut up…” Claude muttered, moving over to Draco's mirror so that he could sort his hair out properly until it could be described as stylishly messy rather than just a mess. It was similar to how Draco worse his own hair only Claude added more volume. “There? Better?”
and who sadly had no children to inherit the shop when the time came. Lucius had quickly proven his worth, Draco having inherited his natural talent in Potions from his father, and had taken over the business when Marcel had retired when Draco was thirteen.
Champions…”

“Technically, it's a ferret…”
“Oi!” Vincent protested, both at the ferret and the hand down his trousers. “Leave off!”
“It’s no one’s fault but Potter’s, Karkaroff,” Snape positively delighted in placing the blame exactly where he thought it should go. Typical. “Don’t go blaming Dumbledore for Potter’s determination to break rules. He has been crossing lines ever since he arrived here –”
was buzzing with the usual amount of activity for the time of day although the presence of the
As her voice trailed off the flames inside the Goblet of Fire suddenly turned a vivid red colour, spitting and writhing as though it had suddenly been turned into the gates of hell.
Dumbledore caught it, turning it over in his hands before announcing grandly,
McGonagall practically screeched in response to his attempt at justification,
“What?”
“My mother wasn’t best pleased with our decision,” she mumbled in response, reaching down to scoop her now weeping son up onto her lap. She couldn’t hide the wince of pain. “I wasn’t expecting quite this sort of a reaction but I knew it wasn’t going to be pleasant…”
“Yes. Your scar is magical as well. It can’t just be removed.”
“You would never do that! We’re too close to each other!” Pansy shook her head.
“Potter!” Kevin threw his hands into the air. “I remember someone doing his normal job anyway with Kurt and how he found the love of his life through us, though he only wanted to have one meaningful date in his life. Are you going to tell me you’re chickening out, just because it’s Malfoy?” Kevin scoffed, though clearly trying to convince him to spend some time with his former nemesis. “I never would have thought.”
“That is not pureblood behavior, little Slytherin Prince!” she called after them, once Draco and Harry had already entered the hallway, laughing loudly.
You better come look for me right this second and tell me what our future will look like, because it looks freaking dark from my end.
“I don’t like these stories” Harry admitted and they walked down the final flight of stairs, where Harry once again, concentrated on all the portraits along the walls. All of these people were looking old and almost tired.
Pansy nodded. “Maybe he’s playing with Dag. I’ll check the owlery!” She followed him quickly, while Millicent walked after them as well.
Actually Granger had let go of him, but glared intensely. Draco had suddenly understood why Weasley and Potter had believed her to be the strongest (and best) witch. It wasn’t wise to anger her.
“Mr. Potter, are you leaving us already? I guess the meeting didn’t go as well as you wanted it to?” he asked and had once again his nice pitying smile on his lips.
Draco pressed a kiss on Harry’s cheek and smiled with so much love in his eyes, Harry felt butterflies in his stomach. “This whole thing made me see that we’re strong. So much stronger than I thought. I was afraid that a child would pull us apart…”
As soon as the doorbell rang, Harry sighed. Draco smiled weakly and got up from the kitchen chair. They had just gone through a list of symptoms of the sudden death curse, even though Draco had been somewhat sure that this hadn’t been the curse. He had of course been right. They had just finished discussing this curse and Harry was sure that Draco was about to say something else. Had it not been for Ginny and Luna appearing right now.
Draco snorted and kissed him softly. “I’m the best influence on you, according to Andromeda.”
“I wouldn’t have said it, if I had wanted to change it.” Harry nodded. “Go! Enjoy the evening!”
Grinning, his husband climbed over the small rim, before he fell into the water, creating a wave and completely wetting Harry. He looked down at his soaked shirt and then at Draco who appeared a little further away from him, smirking. Harry barked out a laugh and shook his head, making the water fly everywhere from his wet hair.
Draco raised his eyes questioning. He didn’t really want to ask more questions, but he was intrigued. In fact, he had always thought that Potter was straight and now it turned out he had an ex-
This time it seemed that only the bushy haired girl was unaffected by what was going on as she let out a deep, dramatic sigh, closed her book as loudly as she could and announced,
And, yes, there had been kissing….lots of kissing…
“Will we help him, he asks,” Javier chuckled loudly. “Who else if not us, I ask you. Honestly.”
Reclining against the headboard of his ridiculously large bed Draco couldn't help but wonder what he'd done to deserve friends like the ones currently surrounding him. He also couldn't decide whether or not he meant that to be a happy, relieved thought or an exasperate one.
“Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, ghosts and – most particularly – guests,” Dumbledore called out, offering the sea of faces a smile. “I have great pleasure in welcoming you all to

Now that he had been gone for almost a year, supposedly vanquished by an infant whose parents had sacrificed their lives in a desperate attempt to save his, she and her husband had come to an agreement. It was time for them to begin anew, without the pressures and expectations put on them not only by their family but by the Wizarding Community at large.
“Narcissa, I feel I must ask how you came about these injuries…?” Penelope murmured once she had finished dealing with the wounds to her face and had begun cleaning up the scrapes to her hands and forearms. She glanced discretely towards Lucius. “You know can tell me…”
That was, as the saying went, easier said than done.
he greeted them politely, reaching out to open the door of the carriage before stepping out of the way so that they could enter first. “After you.”
“If I agree to go will you stop behaving like toddlers?” Draco enquired, unable to fight the smile blossoming on his face. If there was one thing his friends could always do it was make him smile, more often than not at the most inappropriate moments. “You've convinced me, I'll go. Now would you please stop elbowing my in the ribs and rubbing your breasts against me? They're very lovely breasts, don't get me wrong, but I am pretty comfortable with my homosexuality and as such would rather not have them rubbed all over my upper body…”
He'd spent the summer following their break-up, if it could be called that, grieving for his lost love and his lost pride and then had spent the next year of school with a wall around his heart. He didn't date. He didn't flirt. Claude, Javier and Ramona were the only ones allowed to get close to him and that was only because they wouldn't leave him alone. This past summer he'd finally begun to heal, flirting with a couple of boys he'd met when her and his parents had gone on holiday to New Zealand but he'd never let it go any further than that.
Claude, along with all of the other students of
The words died in his throat before he could even open his mouth, almost choking him, and he was almost grateful when Ludo Bagman all but tumbled down the stairs in his haste to reach him, taking him by the arm and physically drawing him over to stand with the others.
Testing the cascade of water with his left hand he smiled, finding it just shy of unbearably hot as he liked it, and moved so that his entire body was underneath the powerful spray. For a moment he simply stood there, face tilted up into the cascading water, and allowed the heat to relax his muscles and joints until his fingers actually began to tingle with numbness.
, Harry thought to himself as she moved away to take her seat with her favourite students gathered close around her, Lavender and Parvati taking the pouffes on either side of her chair. Padma, Parvati’s twin sister who had been sorted into Ravenclaw, sat as far away as she could get as did Harry and Ron. Throughout his
During the rise of the Dark Lord both she and her then fiancé had been pressured into joining his cause by their families, Lucius taking the Dark Mark alongside his father whilst she had escaped being branded due to the fact that both of her parents as well as two of her older sisters had leapt at the chance to become fully fledged members of the evil cause. Thus she had been allowed to slip into the shadows, spouting his rhetoric when it was required of her but never once taking any sort of vow to remain faithful to the Dark Lord.

It was at this point that Ron gave up, pushing his textbook away and joined his fellow students in folding his arms on his desk and going to sleep, his movements almost perfectly synchronised with those of Justin Finch-Fletchley who had also decided to give up on the lesson. Hermione shot him a predictable glare, her hand moving quickly as she took notes despite the fact that Binns was literally just reading from the textbook just as he always did.
Fleur DeLacour in particular, sat in her usual spot on the Slytherin table with her cronies surrounding her, looked ready to spit out nails as Harry stumbled up onto the raised dais.

swung open to admit them they were surrounded by a gaggles of students, all of them giggling and gossiping and pointing out various members of the group. Whilst it was predominantly the younger students, the ones who wouldn't have entered even if they hadn't introduced the age restriction, Draco spotted a few of the older students amongst the group. Their expressions were different, more calculating, as they attempted to figure out which one of the

Hermione sighed.

Draco ran a brush through his medium length blonde locks, He ran just a touch of mouse into it, enough to keep it out of his eyes but not enough to keep it solid and crunchy or make it look greasy.  He pulled on the sleek black suit coat that pansy had sent over to him that morning.  It had a bow on it that read ‘for you darling.  The owner must look his best at his grand reopening.’  He’d rolled his eyes but had set it out on his dressing rack to be pressed and steamed and made ready for the evening.
"I know you're wondering why Draco and I are so amiable. He apologized for his wrongdoings in school and I've forgiven him."
“I don’t intend to do anything about it.” Pansy just gaped at him.
Just about the time Draco was finally starting to focus on weighing and counting Potions Master Piston showed up.
"You're the only one for me, Draco Malfoy," he said then smiled. "There will be no need to go anywhere near New Mexico. I'd hate to have to curse Diggory so badly no one in the Ministry could fix him." He leaned down and brushed a soft kiss against Draco's mouth.
"Okay. Thank you. See you later." Harry ended the call and went to relay Hermione's message.
“The style, the portraits, the atmosphere, Pansy engineered nearly all of it.  She urged me to become a model while we were attending college and here we are.  Pansy and Blaise are the secret to my success.”  The two smiled and nodded.
“Praise Merlin!  I didn't think you'd ever touch this tapestry Harry!  Come with me.  We have much to discuss us three."  Sirius said wrapping Harry in a brief hug.  He then turned back to the door in the tapestry.
“Draco darling!”  She exclaimed, surprised.  “What are you doing?  You should be asleep.”  She said. Draco just nodded and pinched the bridge of his nose.
“Pansy.  It had to be Pansy.  I told her not to meddle.”  Draco rolled his eyes but smiled softly.  Harry was transfixed.
“Now,” he continued, “as for being around you?  I never hated you in school.  I constantly followed you around because I was fascinated by you.   Each year that went by,  you became more and more handsome and desirable.  I was jealous of Pansy because I just knew you were shagging her.”
“If I might interject?”  Draco lazily yawned, reminding Harry of a cat as he stretched languorously.  He felt Ginny glancing at him as he continued to tease his lover.  “Lovegood lives in her own world half the time.  She picks up the most obscure details, things none of us notice.  Yet the obvious escapes her.  So my advice is that simply walk up to her, plant one on her and tell her that you can’t think of anything else.”  The blonde bent his leg and let the sheet slide lower still revealing a light blonde happy trail of hair to his lower bits.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry's breath hitched at the sight and he quickly looked away. When he dared a glance out of the corner of his eye, his cheeks heated. Draco was walking toward him with a satisfied smirk.
*****
He reached over to cover Draco's naked ass with the blankets and the blond man raised his head.
Now that his mind was free to wander, Harry watched Draco washing up at the sink in the back of the room. The taller man dropped something and when he bent to pick it up, Harry couldn't help but notice the stretch of Draco's trousers across a very toned arse.
“Nothing I can’t handle Harry.  You just enjoy yourself.” Draco called out.   “I know what it’s like being afraid for your life every minute.  It gets old.” He added still moving about the smaller square kitchen.  They could see him moving around through the large archway between the two rooms.
The brunette was surprised to actually be perfectly content there, chatting with Draco.  He never thought in a million years anything like that would be happening.  He chuckled.
The two men bid goodbye to Piston and headed upstairs. After Harry knocked on the door and heard Hermione tell them to go in, Harry opened the door and was absolutely gobsmacked to see none other than Severus Snape standing next to his friend.
Hey y'all! There's a couple more chapters ready to post, so I'll be quicker. Hope you're enjoying our little fic :)
Unable to contain his smile, Harry pulled back slowly and opened his eyes.
Harry, freshly showered and dressed in an old Gryffindor tee with well worn jeans, smiled at his friend.
“Mmm.” Draco pulled his mouth off of Harry with a little pop sound.  “I know this is all new and exciting and wonderful to you right now, but Harry.  You’re bisexual.  At some point, you’ll miss burying yourself in a woman, playing with their soft bits.  I’m just letting you know that it’s fine with me if you want to add a woman every once in a while.  I don’t mind it myself though, I obviously prefer roosters to hens.”  He explained as he resumed his attention to the stiff prick in his face.
Even though they were friendly toward each other, Harry was somewhat surprised at Draco's willingness to help. Grateful nonetheless, he described everything he saw in the greatest detail he could. When he was finished, he felt a little calmer, but still worried.
Draco standing next to Harry put a hand on his shoulder in a quiet and nonverbal show of support.  He removed it quickly though and looked at Harry.
Seating himself in a rather comfortable chair at the kitchen table, Harry waited for the rest of the house to rise.  Narcissa came downstairs and smiled warmly at Harry.
"Yeah," Harry agreed. "If we're late Hermione won't be happy."
“I’m fine, I'm fine mum really.”  Draco mumbled coughing.  He glowered at Harry silently.
"Hm. You do have a point, Draco. Maybe I should do what you suggested," Ginny said thoughtfully.
“We’ve never needed the obliviators yet.”  Draco shrugged.  He didn’t comment on the packed schedule.  He was used to it.  Blaise knew that and took full advantage.  Blaise had an excellent head for business and Draco couldn’t have picked a better manager and business partner.
“You’re right.  This was not your fault.  This was them, and their bigotry, taking a cheap shot at an easy target.  We’re trying to educate people.  I started to do interviews and the activist stuff,  just trying to let people see that we’re just like them.  We’re not any different.  I mean, we all bleed red and piss yellow.”  Draco shrugged.  Hermione smiled.
“Yes, quite right.  I’ve been keeping tabs on you young man and I can honestly say that I am both pleasantly surprised and impressed.  However did you manage this level of success?”
"Draco!  Don't be rude.  You haven't greeted our guest!"  Narcissa stated sharply feigning irritation at her son.   Draco stuck his head out of the kitchen.
“Yeah will do bro. See you tonight.” Ron called before disappearing into the green flames.
Thank you to Drarry Black and bookworm92 for their superior prereading and beta skills.
“Didn’t you have a boyfriend to protect you?  I mean, you’re a good looking bloke, gotta have been bending over for someone who would’ve helped you.”  Ron said.  He didn’t mean any harm by it.  It was a backhanded compliment Draco understood his line of thinking but his eyes still flashed and narrowed.
“I knew you’d come around when I suggested it last month.” She laughed getting to her feet. “Ta darling. I’ll see you there.” She grinned and disappeared into the fireplace to her office. Draco shook his head and called Blaise to go over business.
Harry didn't need to be told twice. He moved behind his lover, took his prick in hand, and tapped it against the hole already stretched and waiting for him.
Doing what he did best, Harry steeled his nerves and got out of bed. He really wanted a shower but had nothing to change into. Figuring he'd ask Draco about it, he pulled on his shoes and tiptoed across the hall. Draco's door was open and the sight that greeted Harry surprised him. He knew he needed to look away and knock but he couldn't.
"Yep," Harry thought to himself. "Definitely gay. That explains Ginny."
Hermione just waved him off with a smile. "Goodnight. I'll see you in the morning," she replied.
“Look,” Harry tried to placate the others, “I’m sure whatever this is can be worked out.  Let’s have a chat...”
“This sounds like a high level death eater, one that can get around wards or transform completely enough to fool them.  Either way, the person is powerful.  I feel like it’s a bad idea for you to be alone.  Harry, I think you should come to my place for tonight at least.  Mother will be at the hospital until late.  I have a spare room.  Until we can get a lock on exactly who this is, you shouldn’t be in the same place for too long and we need to refrain from having you anywhere near your normal routines.  I know it’s going to be a huge pain in the ass, but if it keeps you alive..”  Draco shrugged trailing off as he realized that he just invited Potter over to his house.  He swallowed expecting an instant repulsed reaction.
“So wait, someone just sent you vip passes for tonight?  Did it say who?”  Draco asked looking at Harry as the wheels clicked in his head.
Help comes from the most unlikely of places for Harry and Ron.
“It wasn’t your fault mum.  Aunt Bella was always a little off, and her choices in partner’s certainly didn’t help any.  Lestrange was extremely controlling and generally the worst sort of person.  I mean, I can’t imagine how that family has suffered.”  Draco shrugged and bit into his toast, still avoiding looking at Harry.
Draco shined his shoes and buttoned his cufflinks and floo’d to his office, he opened his door and walked across the hall to Blaise’s office.  Opening the door he poked his head in.  Blaise waved him in, but held up a hand for quiet as he was on the phone with the press arranging for the last minute publicity of tonight's event.
“So the muggles don’t really like bent blokes much either huh?”  Ron asked from his chair.  Draco shrugged.
“For one,” Harry said, “there’s no need for you to apologize. I don’t mind seeing you at all.  However I do appreciate the concern you have for my privacy.  Two, as far as muggles are concerned, the ones I’ve dealt with weren’t so fun.”  Of course, he was referring to his aunt, uncle, and cousin.
“Draco.  You’re looking sharp.  I see Pansy dressed you for tonight as well.  Good. Good.  I need you to meet the photographers on level two by the large windows for a shoot.”  Blaise said as he hung up the phone.
Noise from the kitchen along with a rather nice smell alerted Harry that Draco was still there. Knowing he was still embarrassed, he couldn't help but tease him a bit.
“That’s it,” Hermione told him. “That envelope was not a prank, and now you need to be protected, whether you like it or not.”  Hermione was saying to Harry.
Harry opened his eyes to the sight of an unfamiliar room. His first thought was he slept in his glasses. Then the events of the night before rushed back to him in a huge, almost overwhelming wave.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m a bit shocked to hear you admit it, I must say.  However it is a very pleasant realization.  Giving credit to others is something your father never would have done.”  Helga said with a nod of approval.
"She won't, I'm sure," he managed, trying to discreetly move his lover's hand.
“We’d best head up to see the minister, she said she wanted to see us earlier right?”  Draco asked Harry, blinking to clear his thoughts that had strayed.  Mechant had gone and Piston was cleaning her coffee pot.
“I’m no preacher's son, my love.  You should know that.  There’s not much I wouldn’t do if it would make you happy.  Besides, she’s pretty damn cute for a female and far less annoying than the rest of her family.”  Draco stated as his mouth descended onto Harry’s rock hard cock.
><>45 minutes prior<><
When he got that first tat, he found that the sound of the gun and the dull ache of the needles were somewhat...soothing to him. They allowed him to completely block out all of the horrors he had endured so far in his short life. So, Harry continued to get inked.
“Yup. Trainee’s don’t get to do field work, and Sundays no one works and we get all the paperwork to file on Mondays from the weekends undercover ops. A learning experience they call it. Can you believe it? Grunt work is what it is.” Ron grumbled.
Once the three men were safely inside the sitting room of Grimmauld Place, Narcissa bustled in from the kitchen with Kreacher following behind.
“Yeah, I see your point.  We can be friends now can't we?  I mean, you just literally saved our arse’s.  I think that at the least puts us on a first name basis.  I’m gonna get so ragged about this at auror training on monday.  We didn’t bring our wands cuz it’s a party you know?  Even in a fair fight, there was no way I could have taken down even one of those guys.  Did you see those guys?  How is that aerodynamic?”  Ron grumbled.  Draco laughed.  Harry laughed even.
“Draco Malfoy, as I live and breathe.”  Helga stated extending her hand.
"Are you serious?" Harry asked, genuinely curious. He couldn't tell if Draco was taking the piss or not.
“I like this side of you, the jealous possessive gryffindor.  Will you spank me if I proposition your ex wife again?”  Draco asked coyly wiggling his arse against Harry in their tight embrace.
“And I promise never to tell what that is.”  She winked.  “Draco this is Helga Hawthorn from Witch Weekly.  This is Sylvester Penoir who owns the Daily Prophet.”  Draco shook hands with them.
“Now, now prince.  Don’t be ungrateful.  Blaise sent me to fetch these two, says the coast is clear.  You and Harry can catch up a bit more.  I’m sure you two have a lot to talk about.  You know where to find me when you want me.”  Pansy said, levitating the tumblers back to the small sidebar.  “Come on Hermione, Weasley.  I think you’ll enjoy the red lounge best for starters.”  She led the two out of the office, Hermione casting an apologetic smile at Harry but eagerly following Parkinson.

The afternoon crowd was a different sort than the late night crowd.  The people who came for the food and atmosphere weren’t interested in the kinky members only floors on the second and third levels of the club.  The ground floor was mostly muggle and mainly the typical pub style bar and restaurant, though with a more upscale feeling.  There was a huge dance floor and stage, the dance floor had all the lights and lasers and smoke machines that any muggle club would have, along with a killer sound system.  It had taken Draco and Blaise nearly a month to figure out how to make the electricity work harmoniously with the magic.  In the end, they’d worked it out and had made a small fortune just from selling the secret to the ministry.
Draco particularly enjoyed the multitude of tattoos from what he could tell both muggle and wizarding ink decorated the savior.  He secretly hoped he might someday be able to examine each and every one up close.  When the three of them had gone back to the wizarding world as graduates, working together to figure out what they could do to help repair the damage their idiot parents had done.  Pansy had been the first to suggest a club and a clothing line to blend muggle ways and technology and fashions into the wizarding world.
“Thanks, actually that’s not the problem.”  Draco sighed.  Narcissa fixed a gaze on her son that said she was practically reading his soul.  It was a look only a mother could level you with.
“So basically I gather that this means that should anything happen to Master Piston that I am to take over her duties.  Is that correct?”  Draco asked Hermione to be sure he had it right.
“I learned Karate while I was getting my business degree at oxford.  Blaise couldn’t be with me twenty four hours a day.  After a couple months of getting beat up fairly regularly in the muggle world, I started taking karate classes to protect myself.  The mediwitch course was initially Pansy’s idea.  She took it with me as it was after her design classes finished for the day.  We’re both licensed in Medi Witchery.  We can do all the basic healing, diagnostics, etc.  My face is my living.  I can’t exactly let it get all busted up regularly now can I?”  Draco fought the urge to roll his eyes and instead tossed his longer hair over his shoulder to get it out of his face.
Lunch wasn't nearly as awkward as Harry thought it would be. Draco had his public mask on perfectly, which helped. They talked of random things while they ate then walked back to the Potions room in companionable silence.
Turning around so their faces were mere inches from each other, Harry reverted back to the second year dueling club.
He was interrupted by a hard punch to the stomach which put him on his knees, gasping for breath and coughing.
Toeing off his shoes, Harry laid back into the wonderful softness of the bed. He felt like he would never sleep again but in the end, exhaustion won out and he fell into a fitful sleep.
He remembered the funny feeling in the pit of his stomach at seeing Draco's morning erection. It made him wonder what the man would have looked like if there were no clothes covering him. Just thinking about it now had Harry feeling rather warm.
"Not that I know of," Hermione said. "If I think of anything I'll be sure to let you know"
“What interest do you have in the mens club?” He snipped looking down his pointy nose at her.
“You may be the only friend who counts darling but I do have a plethora of contacts. I’m trying to make a good impression on the editor of witch weekly so she’ll feature my clothing line in her magazine and I have a few other elbows to grease. Your club would be the exact right place for it.” She shrugged. The blonde grinned then pulled an envelope out of the breast pocket of his suit coat and handed it to her. She squealed with delight then kissed him on the cheek.
“Stop it.  People will get the wrong idea.”  She giggled.
Thank y'all for reading! Until next time...
“I know mother but something has happened.”  Draco sighed deeply.
Draco headed down to the potions lab and showed Harry around.  He began to help Merchant weigh out ingredients for the day’s potions while they waited for Piston to show.
“How did you learn all that?”  Harry blurted rather boldly.
“Potions is a delicate art that requires much patience.  You were a receptive student.”  Snape shrugged stating what he believed was an obvious fact and sounding bored at having to point out the obvious.
Hey y'all! Many thanks to our wonderful prereader and beta, Drarry Black! We're so thankful she puts up with us :)
“She’ll be back.”  Draco laughed.  He shoved the covers away and knelt between Harry’s legs licking his lips.
Harry tucked a finger under Draco's chin and lifted his face so he could see his eyes.
The dark haired man slowly lowered himself to his knees, never taking his eyes off of Draco’s.  He slowly opened the trousers and revealed Draco’s rather impressive bulge, encased in silver silk bikini briefs.  He pressed his mouth to the warm fabric.
He unbuttoned the vest and let it flutter to the ground next as his mouth returned to capture Harry’s.  Draco’s hand deftly worked open the leather belt and black slacks the other man was wearing.  He grinned when he realized Harry wasn’t wearing any pants.
“Ah that’s an easy one.  I owe it mostly to a desire to understand the things that had been kept from me by my father, and the two best friends a bloke could ask for.   Pansy is beautiful, that much is without question but don't let her pretty face fool you.  She's a shrewd business woman.  Anyone would be lucky to find her in their corner.”  Draco gestured around to the club and the elevator that led to the upper floors.
Seeing Harry's sadness, Draco took one of his hands in his, squeezing lightly. Severus, who had been looking at names of the Brotherhood, placed his hand on Harry's shoulder while leaning in to see some of the smaller names.
“Mr.  Potter.  Mr.  Malfoy.”  Snape greeted them nonchalantly.  Draco simply gapped.  For a moment he thought that he’d gone completely round the bend.
. The other has four words in a sharp, looping scrawl he recognises too well, and he glances at it one more time before he folds it and pushes it into his pocket, a weird feeling in his stomach he decides to ignore for now.
He kisses him again, and Potter kisses him back; pushes at him until Draco's spine thumps against the edge of the sideboard that runs along the length of the far wall, crammed with years' worth of scrolls and textbooks. Awkwardly, slipping on the rolls of parchment that spill out onto the floor, Draco shoves Potter away for a second and jams one heel into the lip of the bottom shelf and half-levers himself up, making space for the other boy to cram right up against him, press between his knees, yank Draco's shirt tails out of his trousers and get his palms against his skin and his mouth against his neck.
He takes a step back and feels something soft give way under his boot. Realises Malfoy's left his gloves behind.
He kisses him, hard and awkward and Harry doesn't even know if he moves at all before the other boy lets him go again, leaving Harry's hands hanging in mid-air.
' Harry tries again, as he does his best Keeper impression to try and deflect some of the socks. 'I-I wanted him here. We're...Friends now. It's
Maybe Potter's gaze slips a bit: to Draco's mouth, to the sliver of neck visible above the collar of his robes.
'Those...His parents, allowed
'...He- Yeah.' Harry says, looks at his trainers. 'Yeah. He does.'
Suddenly self-conscious, Harry takes a few steps backwards, towards his Quidditch stuff, still spread out over the benches. He adjusts his own clothes, scrubs a pointless hand through his hair. All at once he's very grateful for Peeves as an excuse for the staining on the front of his trousers. He can hear Draco's boots on the vinyl floor, the soft noise of him pulling his cloak on again. And the rain, still pattering against the roof.
True to his word, Draco had clothes waiting for Harry when he returned to the borrowed room. Dressing quickly, Harry slipped his shoes on and wandered downstairs. All of the rooms had only the furniture necessary to be functional, nothing like Harry thought there would be. However, it looked homey to him.
“Ah that’s cool mate.” Ron finished his breakfast and stood to head to the floo when an unfamiliar brown owl flew in the window. Ron paused after putting on his red auror training robes and came to see what it was about. Harry took the thick envelope from the bird who pecked his finger as he dropped some treats for it.
"Yeah," Harry whispered. "What is it?"
Howdy! We're back again! Hope ya'll liked the first chapter. I'm gonna do my best to post every day :)
“Well I just think it’s sexist is all. If you’re going to have a members only sex club you could at least open it up to women as well. Lesbians like to party too you know. We deserve a place to play just like the boys do. With the bigger portion of the wizarding world thinking like the weaselette, we ought to stick together, hold each other up. Otherwise we’ll all go down.” Pansy shrugged. Draco was silent mulling it over. He’d been thinking about it himself recently.
“Well then you’d better tell me all about it so we can figure it out together.”  She smiled and continued chopping veggies.
He rather liked this Narcissa. Before the trials she was standoffish and borderline rude. Now, however, without Lucius around, Harry could see she was rather kind and generous. It was a pleasant change.
Thank y'all for reading! See ya next time!
A few days passed quietly as Harry spent his free time writing whenever he wasn’t at work in the potions lab with Draco.  Draco and Harry had moved Draco’s stuff into Harry’s room as the two had no interest in sleeping separately.
“You alright there Potter?”  Draco asked nonchalantly with a knowing grin as he headed into the cafeteria.
“Muggle or Wizard?”  He asked getting to his feet.

Hey y'all! Huge thanks go to Drarry Black and bookworm92 for their prereading and beta skills.
“Who hasn’t?” He laughed as she took the offered cup of tea and sat herself down kicking her shoes off and stretching her feet up onto the footstool near her favorite chair.
Draco tossed the paper in the bin. The golden boy had broken up with the weaslette. She wasn’t taking it well either. She was on the cover of the last three issues ranting about homosexuals and their perversions corrupting people. So the lgbtq community in the wizarding world had clapped back at her hard. She lost her position on the holyhead harpies as lead chaser and had been relegated to warming the bench. She was seen silently fuming at every game this season.
“Course I did.  You don’t really think it was voldemort and my father’s abuse that had me crying to Myrtle do you?”  Draco snuggled into Harry’s embrace.
“This isn’t any of your concern.  We don’t have any quarrel with you yah fancy ponce!  I’d hate to mess up that pretty face of yours.”
“My first time was with Cedric Diggory, I was young and convinced myself that it was just a fluke.  I tried like hell to be straight for the next two years, for my father’s approval, then when I gave up pretending I had a choice in the matter, I began to see Michael Corner around the time you and Ginevra were hooking up.  We used to study all night sometimes because I couldn’t sleep from nightmares. He was a quiet bloke, never judged me for taking the mark.  He was a good first romance.   We grew apart though, and wanted different things.  I still hear from him from time to time.  He’s happily married now, to that bloke Terry Boot.”  Draco fell silent as a faint flush graced his cheeks.  He never thought he’d ever be sharing intimate details of his sex life with Harry Potter of all people.  For as long as he could remember, the only people he’d ever had to talk to and rely on were Pansy and Blaise.  So having a very handsome and very interested Harry Potter in front of him was odd.  He licked his lips to wet them.  He wondered if he ought to pinch himself to make sure he wasn’t dreaming.
“Honestly, Ronald!  Grow up.”  Hermione said rolling her eyes and pulling Ron’s hand away from his face.  “Look around.  Don’t you see what’s going on?  The photos of Draco, the pride flags and civil service awards on the wall?  It’s obvious Draco Malfoy is popular with the muggles.  It’s also clear he owns this place.”
Harry was shocked beyond belief to see his godfather standing there alive and well. After all the years...he missed him so much.
"Wouldn't you like to know, Malfoy," Harry retorted with a smirk.
Admitting defeat to himself, Harry lowered his head so his nose was touching Draco's neck.
“Yes, you’ll find that I am not my father.  Not in any way that counts.”  Draco shrugged.
Plus, if they could help to bring some unity to the community, by way of trying to make up for the division and devastation that their fathers had caused, then all the better.  Draco privately had donated a large portion of his earnings to several charities, two muggle organizations for at risk youth, and one for lgbtq rights and litigation that worked both in muggle and the wizarding world.  Then he donated to two more wizarding charities to make up his own peace of mind about the dark mark.  Even though he hadn’t really done anything as a death eater.  He'd only taken the mark months before the end, thanks to the lose-lose situation that Potter had created for him by getting his father arrested at the ministry of magic over that whole prophecy fiasco.  It hadn’t taken the dark lord long to want Draco to suffer in his fathers place.
“I had no idea that you were so fond of sausage Potter.”  Draco muttered quietly as his mother returned to her seat and they finished their breakfast.
"Gonna come, Harry?" Draco panted. He was answered with a loud groan.
Thank you for reading! See y'all next time!

“Yeah,  she’s been keeping up with the papers, always has been on top of all the gossip, and who’s who, and who their doing what with.  Mind you, usually it’s because she’s trying to get her brand noticed on important people.   She started seeing the interviews with Ginevra and has convinced herself that you and I would make a great gay powercouple.  I told her to mind her own business and leave you alone, as I’m likely the last person you’d want to see right now.  Obviously she didn’t listen and went behind my back, sending you tickets for tonight.  I’m sorry, I know how you value your privacy.  Or rather, I would if I’d been in your shoes as a kid.  As it is, I quite enjoy the attention my fame brings me.  At least in the muggle world.  Muggles are fun.  Why did no one ever tell me?”  Draco explained taking a sip of his water and then adding some ice to it wandless and wordlessly.
