She was waiting for Severus to come to the classroom, but he was late. He missed the first two periods with the Slytherins and right now it was going to be class time with the Gryffindors. Violet was getting more worried about Severus as each minute ticked away on the clock. Hadrian said that the professor was going to come back today, but it looked like he wasn’t coming. She hoped that her favorite teacher would have come back today, yet it seemed like wishful thinking. “I hope the professor has gotten over his illness. I’ll go check on him at the hospital wing later on,” she thought to herself. Bringing her mind back to the present, she focused on the class in front of her. The Gryffindors were being rowdy today. Dean and Seamus were playing with their cauldrons, Lavender was gossiping to other girls who cared to listen to her stories, and her brother Neville was for sure saying nasty things about her behind her back to his tablemates. The one who did seem to partly listen was Alira, the familiar face she met earlier. The Gryffindor girl was doodling on her parchment. From her vantage in the room, Violet could see it was of Hadrian’s weapon. The day that Tom had taken out her heart, she tended to Alira’s wounds as Hadrian and Valorie took Severus to the hospital wing. The two got to talking when they left. Although nearly everyone else distrusted that girl, she seemed ok. However, Violet became a little uneasy when Alira began to talk smack about the professor. “Professor Snape is a good man. He has done nice things for people. The only reason he is mean to you Gryffindors is because you are mean to him. If you say another bad thing about him, I won’t hold back my instinct to hurt you,” she remembered threatening her. The shouting from the Gryffindors became louder. She was getting annoyed with them real quick. Violet spotted a small knife near the edge of the desk. Taking it in hand, she threw it at the door. “QUIET!” she screamed. The students immediately stopped talking, watching the blade travel across the room. It was aimed to hit the center of the door and splinter its wood. What she did not know or expect was for Severus to open that door. A hush fell across the room as the blade was about to pierce his face. Inches from his nose, Severus caught the blade with two fingers. The Gryffindors gasped at the spectacle, wondering if this was Violet’s last time at the school before she would be expelled. Moving the blade away from his face, Severus looked at the knife, then at Violet who was heaving with anger. He was impressed at how tough she was becoming and her excellence in knife throwing. Severus gave her a smile. “Nice throw,” he said, smiling at Violet. “Nice catch, Professor,” Violet quipped. Severus flipped the blade into the air and caught it by its hilt. As soon as he got a grip of the knife, he threw it back at Violet. The knife flew in the air, soaring through Neville’s cauldron and shattering it into a million pieces. It then arrowed towards Violet, who caught the knife by the edge of its hilt. The class gasped in unison at the scene. Neville looked at her sister in anger. Violet gave her brother a sideways glare as she clutched the blade. His face no longer showed anger, but now taken aback with surprise. He was looking at a sister he didn’t even know anymore. He and the rest of the class turned to see Severus slowly gliding his way towards the other side of the room. Violet moved over so Severus could take his place. “Don’t think I am going to ignore how rude you were being to Ms. Longbottom. As punishment, I am taking 70 points from Gryffindor for being unruly and undisciplined ingrates. I trust this won’t happen again?” The Gryffindors began to argue for how unfair it was, but they silenced themselves when the professor looked like he was about to subtract more points from their house. “Now, we will get started. I’ll be teaching from here on out and Ms. Longbottom will help me survey you all. Today, we are going to be making a Confusing Concoction. You should already know its ingredients and how to make it by now. Whoever makes the potion with the most accuracy will get top marks. Go get your ingredients.” The Gryffindors scurried to grab what they needed. While they mixed their potions, Violet turned to Severus, her face in a full glow. “I’m so glad you are ok, Professor. Are you feeling better now that you are over your illness?” Ruffling his robes, he gave a small nod. “Yes. I am better, thank you. Violet, I am truly grateful for what you have done for me. Tom and Hadrian told me what a wonderful job you have done when I was gone.” Violet filled with pride at the compliment. “Thanks, professor. But, it was really not a big deal. You helped me. It is only fair that I help you.” Master and apprentice watched the class make the potions, criticizing everyone for their mistakes. Violet caught him up on what the classes did when he was away. They watched the class from the desk. Violet just noticed that he didn’t have Amelia with him. “Where’s your adorable baby? I would have thought you kept her around at all times,” Violet asked him. “She is with Tom. I would have brought her to class if I came earlier today. Tom insisted that he watch her as I slowly get back into teaching.” Violet looked at the empty cradle near his desk. Amelia did make helping the classes all the more tolerable. Her cute face made people forget about their troubles. About half an hour past when the Gryffindors began to finish up. As each student called out that they were finished, Severus and Violet went over to their tables to grade them. “Horrible. Disgraceful. An utter waste of time,” they told Gryffindors as they tested their mixtures. Most of the class got Ds and Fs. “Professor Snape? I’m done with my potion,” Alira called to him. The two headed over to her workstation and tested out her potion. “Not bad. Not good either, but close. I give you a B.” She frowned at the professor. She knew she did everything right. “Professor, I followed the recipe exactly. I checked my results many times. Why am I getting a B?” Severus turned back to face her. He leaned in a little closer, whispering to where only she could hear. “You know, you are right. I could have given you a full grade. However, on top of shouting out my name in class, questioning me and my helper’s recipes and methods, insulting my family, and may I add your terrible lie that you had saved yourself a few days earlier with, I simply do not like you. That is why you are getting a B. Now sit back down and do your work.” Alira looked away, submitting to his insults and did as he said. She returned to sketching out the weapons. Severus walked away while Violet lingered for a moment. “I would have given you an A-. Not everyone can make pretty accurate potions.” she said. “Alira, I think you are a nice person. Just, just don’t try and hurt the professor. He and the others might lighten up once you do.” Violet followed Severus to the next student. To her disgust, it was her brother. “P-p-professor. I-I’m done.” He held out his replacement cauldron out to the both of them. Violet was the one who looked into the cauldron first. It looked nasty. The liquid looked like it was curdling into lumps and it smelled unpleasant. Violet had to fight her reflex to gag. “What is this?” she asked her brother. “It’s the Confusing Concoction,” he sniped at her. Grabbing the ladle, she scooped up the contents. It looked more like a dubious mush than a potion. “The only good thing that might come out of this potion is that if they were dumb enough to drink it, it might kill them. Unfortunately, that is the only use this useless blob has. So, brother, F!” Neville fumed. He knew that he was not the best at potions and that was mostly Professor Snape’s fault for terrifying him in class. He wasn’t scared of him right now, but raging that his sister is the one who is failing him in class. “No. I don’t get an F. Violet, you may have impressed the faculty with your ‘amazing’ potion skills, but I am not falling for it. You just suck up to them so you can have people by your side. That is not how the world works, sister. I’m writing to Gran about this. And I bet she will send you an embarrassing Howler for you being who you are: lousy and horrible and a suck up!” Violet had enough. Her brother had no right to treat her this way when she was helping to teach a class. She slammed her hands on his desk, rattling the remaining contents on it. “Enough! I’m not the same scared girl I was earlier, Neville. I’ve changed, for the better. You’re petty insults held me back. I’ve made so many mistakes and because of it, including into thinking I could make you proud. But now, now I realized that I am much stronger than you wanted me to believe. You never knew me, the real me, at all.” Neville could swear that her eyes flickered grey for a moment, grey like a Malfoy’s. It was only for a quick second, her eyes then shimmering back to their normal fuchsia. Neville stood there dumbstruck, watching his sister glare at him until she and the professor moved on to the next table. The class went by quite quick. Violet and Severus were quite unimpressed with them, but what else can you expect from Gryffindors? After shooing them out, Severus got to talking with Violet. “Violet, do you know why I was absent for the past few days?” he inquired. “Wasn’t it because you were sick? Hadrian told me. Is there something else that I don’t know?” Taking a deep breath, Severus told her the truth. Violet handled the news quite better than Severus expected; although, she was confused on some parts. “I am so happy for you Severus, but I’m worried that you won’t be ok. Maybe you should have me as a substitute from now on whenever you don’t feel good. And even if you do feel good, I can teach the classes. You saw today. I’m capable enough of doing so,” she emphasized. Severus smiled. “I know you are capable. But, Dumbledore will get suspicious if you keep taking my place. Um...so how’s this? Only when my pregnancy is an extreme emergency, you can teach. I trust that you can do this.” Violet nodded with vigor. “I will.” She got up from her spot and began to stuff her bag. “Where are you heading, Vi?” he asked. “The training room. We decided to meet there at lunch sometimes. And I also promised to bring a few potions,” she asserted as she opened her bag to reveal the tiny pockets made for each individual vial. “When you have the time, come visit us. Valorie told me that she’s been dying to show you around. You’d be surprised how well we cleaned it up. Bye, Severus. I’ll see you then.” Violet slung her giant mushroom beanie over her ears and left to join the others.
“Please stay here till I get your parents Hadrian.” Hadrian nodded his head and stayed in his place. Then he heard the voices of his parents. Once they saw him they froze in shock.  Hadrian smiled and walked over and faced his mother. “Mother I missed you.”  Once Severus realized who the boy was he started to cry and hugged the boy.
Near the dying embers of the hearth, Narcissa woke up. Looking around, she realized that she was the first one up that morning. Her husband was still asleep and Elaina and Sirius were not downstairs boisterously talking as they usually do. Remembering what happened last night, she looked to her side and found the girl still sleeping. She looked quite better than before. Most of her injuries were healed and color returned to her face. Narcissa was glad. She got up and stretched the sleepiness out of her. Heading to the kitchen, she began to make breakfast for herself and the others. She even made soup just for the newcomer. Eating her own breakfast in silence, Narcissa readjusted her schedule for the day. Before the girl came, she had plans to finish brewing other necessary potions for situations. Now that she had to take care of the girl, she had to move her time around to be efficient. “I think I have to hold off on making other potions except for healing ones today. The girl needs to be looked after. I also have to make sure that no one bothers her. The others are going to be asking questions like crazy. May need to get them to back off if that happens,” Narcissa thought, organizing her ideas. Around the time she finished breakfast, the girl woke up again. The girl began to sit up just as she did last night, but forgot she was in pain and fell back on the pillow. “Ow! Ugh….Huh?” the girl grunted. Narcissa hurried over to the girl’s spot to greet her with a cup of water in her hands. “Here. Drink this. It’ll soothe your throat.” The girl took the cup gratefully and drank it. In a few seconds, it was gone. “You must have been thirsty. I’m Narcissa Malfoy. Over on the other couch sleeping is my husband, Lucius. What’s your name?” The girl cleared her throat a few times, trying to find her voice. “...I...I...I’m Za...Z...Zara,” she stammered. “It’s nice to meet you, Zara. I can see that you go to Hogwarts. You know, I was a Slytherin too,” Narcissa said, pointing at the girl’s dirt-stained emblem on her chest. “Do you know someone named Hadrian Riddle there?” Narcissa asked her. Zara shook her head, some of her hair sticking to her forehead. She brushed it away, but realized that her arm was no longer covered in wounds. Now curious, she inspected her other arm and ran her fingers across her face. There wasn’t a single trace or scar that had previously marred her body, save for the one on her abdomen that has been hurting her. “How...are they...g-gone?” Narcissa pointed to the jumble of empty vials. “I used some potions and healing magic to patch you up. I am a professional healer.” Grateful for Narcissa’s kindness, Zara tried to prop her body up to give the lady a hug. Seeing that Zara was struggling, Narcissa came closer to fill the gap. “Thank-thank you s-so much,” she rasped. Pulling away from the hug, Narcissa noticed her husband waking up. Elaina and Sirius also descended down the stairs. “Ah! Look who’s awake,” Sirius remarked. Zara shifted a little uncomfortably, wondering what the other strangers were going to do. “Don’t worry. They aren’t going to do you any harm,” Narcissa tried to ease her. Zara relaxed slightly, still a little wary of the other people. Narcissa introduced them for her. “This is Sirius. And the woman standing next to him is Elaina. They are my friends.” The two shook hands with Zara. “It’s nice to meet you,” she said quietly. Lucius woke up and greeted her too. As the three of them settled down on the adjacent couch, Narcissa began to ask Zara questions. “Zara, I’m glad you are awake. I need to ask you a few things, though. My husband and I, we are the ones who found you when you collapsed. Do you remember that?” Zara shook her head. “No. The only thing I remember was the feeling that I had to run. Run as far and fast as I could.” Trying to probe lightly on the information, Narcissa asked her next question. “Who were you running from? Was it a bully from school?” The wounded girl hesitated, unsure whether or not she should tell them who. “I shouldn’t say. You won’t believe me. I don’t think you want to know.” Narcissa placed a hand on Zara’s shoulder. “We’ll believe you,” she reaffirmed the girl. “We have seen our fair share of odd things. And if you want us to keep it a secret, we won’t tell anyone.” Looking at Narcissa, Zara felt a little more comfortable. The woman who saved her life wants to help her. She decided to tell them the truth. “I am running...from Dumbledore…,” she told them. They were shocked to hear that. Narcissa wondered what that girl did make Dumbledore so angry that he decided to hunt her down like she was meek prey. “Dumbledore? Why are you running from him, child?” Narcissa asked her. “I found out something about Dumbledore. Something awful. At first, I couldn’t believe it. I didn’t want to believe it. But after I learned what I did, I began to see him in a different light. I realized that I had to stop him. So, I confronted Dumbledore about it. What I did not know was that he already had others on his side. He and a man named Kingsley Shacklebolt cornered me and attacked. I fought them off as best as I could, but they were way stronger. They overpowered me. I tried to flee, to run and tell someone, anyone the truth about Dumbledore. But, they shot me with a spell. And that was the last thing I remembered before being knocked out.” The four adults grimaced at her story. They knew that Dumbledore was ruthless, willing to defend his image by harming one of his own students. “After being knocked out for quite a long while, I woke up in what looked like an abandoned dungeon. I was confused on how I got there, but I then remembered what Dumbledore had done to me. I tried to get out of the room, but he walked in when I headed for the exit. He was surprised that I was awake, said that I should not have woken up at all. Then, he took out his wand and attacked me. I tried to defend myself again, but found that I was exhausted. He hurled spells and injured me. He then took this hook-like dagger that dripped with some sort of green ooze and stabbed me with it, right here,” Zara said, pointing to her abdomen. Narcissa began to speculate what the green ooze in question was, for it blocked magic from healing Zara. “That ooze must be some sort of poison,” Naricssa thought out loud. “If I could figure out how to counteract it, I will be able to heal your wound.” She let Zara continue her story. “When he stabbed me with that dagger, I was sure that I was going to die. Luckily, I was able to grab my wand and cast a light spell to momentarily blind him. He was really mad when I escaped, so he sent that Kingsley Shacklebolt after me. I used all my strength to run as far away as I could from him, not stopping to rest until I was safe. I ended up running as far as the forest and now I am here.” The Malfoys looked at the girl. She began spinning the water cup in her hands. Unsure of what she found out and what she knew, Narcissa asked her. “What did you find out that made Dumbledore so...angry?” Zara paused. “I found out...that Dumbledore wants to take over the magical community, eradicating all Slytherins, former and current, and any of his other enemies along with it. I learned about it when I was about to visit his office. I overheard him talking about it to Shacklebolt. I was so, so scared. I didn’t want to die at Dumbledore’s hands, and wasn’t going to let him hurt my friends either.” Zara clenched her fists together. She looked ready to punch something. “I can’t let my efforts be in vain. I have to fight him to the very last. That’s really...all I can do.” Narcissa placed a hand on Zara’s. “Listen to me, Zara. We are fighting against Dumbledore as well. He has hurt our friends and family one too many times. There is a team at Hogwarts right now, trying to take him down from the inside. You probably even know Severus, I mean, Professor Snape. He is also against Dumbledore too. You’re not alone, Zara. I ask that you lend us your strength. We could use another member on our team.” Zara looked at the four adults. They looked like they needed her help, and she needed theirs. She watched as Narcissa hugged Lucius and Elaina and Sirius joined them from behind. Compelled to act, Zara decided to join them. “I’ll help. You had me ready when you said the professor is fighting. He’s a kind man and a great teacher. Besides, I want to help out my classmates.” Looking at Narcissa and Lucius, she was reminded of a long-forgotten memory. “Now that I look at you two, I remembered something. I’ve...met you before. You were that nice couple that I saw at Hogwarts not that long ago. When you arrived, you had a child with you. A son. I think his name...was Draco. Yeah, I remember now! Draco Malfoy. I showed you all around the school. Professor Snape appointed me to be your guide. You said that you wanted to enroll your son for next year.” Narcissa and Lucius looked back on that day. They vaguely remembered a friendly Slytherin guide that toured them and Draco around Hogwarts. Taking a good look at Zara’s face, they began to remember her as their guide. “I hope that you do enroll your son here at Hogwarts. It’s the best magic school there is. And I have a feeling that he’ll be one of the greatest students ever,” they remembered her saying. “Wait. You were that upper class person who showed us around?! But that’s…!” Lucius started, but Zara cut him off. She looked happy that they remembered her, reminiscing about that time herself. “Yep! That was me. I know I must look like any of the other Slytherins that you saw walking around that day, but I am so glad you remember me. Well, I thank you for helping me. That was kind of you. I am going to help you, but I have to go take care of something first. So, if you can give me the potions you gave me earlier and some spare bandages, I’ll be on my way.” Narcissa knew that the girl was in no condition to leave. Even with those supplies, someone had to keep an eye on her injury just to make sure it does not get worse. “Zara, you’re hurt. You are definitely not ready to travel. Where are you going anyway?” Zara set down her water glass, pulling the blanket off herself. Multiple times, she tried to get up. After a few tries, she was strained and sat back down for a minute to recover. “...Well, I am going back to Hogwarts. I am not letting Dumbledore chase me away this time. Just because he is a bully does not mean he gets to take away my graduation day. All my friends and professors know that I’m a good student. They can vouch for me if Dumbledore complains that I’m back.” The adults were confused. It was the start of a new year and a new term. It wasn’t anywhere near graduation time. Something did not add up. “What do you mean ‘graduation day’?” Narcissa asked her. “It’s September, which is the start of the school year, not the end.” Zara stopped herself from getting up again. Sitting back down, she tried to set them straight. “No-no, it’s not. It’s still June. I don’t know how you are out of the loop, but you are very out of the loop if you can’t remember what month it is. If I’m going to Hogwarts, I better leave now. I would apparate, but I don’t want to accidentally splinch myself in the condition I’m in,” Zara chuckled. Narcissa began to piece an unexpected thought together: Zara thinking that them meeting was a few days ago. Her remembering Draco as a child instead of a fourth year. Her not seeing Draco, or Hadrian, or Valorie, or any of the other kids in class. Her being knocked out for a long while and not knowing for how long. Her still being in seventh year when she should have graduated by now. It didn’t make sense, but it did. “Zara,” Narcissa started shakily. “What year do you think it is?” Zara was caught off guard. Surprised by her question, she scoffed at the silliness of the idea. “What kind of question is that?” Looking at Narcissa's stern face, she realized that she wasn’t kidding. “Ok, you are kind of scaring me now. I thought you were making a joke.” Narcissa repeated the question. “Zara, what year do you think it is?” Zara didn’t know why they were asking her this. Elaina began to see what Narcissa saw. “Oh no,” she whispered, freaking her out even further. She looked around, trying to find what to say. “It’s the same year as it has been for a while now. It’s 1990,” Zara said with very little confidence. Lucius, Elaina, Sirius, and Narcissa gave her a pained look. It felt like a long while that they remained in silence. They couldn’t look at her in the eyes. “What is it?” Zara asked, breaking the unsteady silence. Narcissa met her gaze, reluctant to break the news, not wanting to hurt her. “Zara, it’s 1994. That spell that Dumbledore and Shacklebolt hit you with, must have been something that put you in a stasis-like sleep. You were under that spell for four years.” Zara was in disbelief. Speechless, she tried to fight against their assumption. “It can’t be...it isn’t...why would...no,” she stammered. Realization hit her hard. Zara felt awful. Her wound hurt a lot more than did a few seconds ago. Gravity weighed her down ten times more than it should. It didn’t make sense to her. Trapped in time for four years. The thought felt like a joke, a trick. All her plans once she graduated were done for. Her friends were already grown up, probably living the dream without her. Covering her wound with one hand and her eyes with the other, Zara curled up into a little ball and cried. “Why...how could this happen? How could it have come to this? It’s not right, right?” She looked at her hands and her body. “I’m...trapped-trapped in a 17 year old body, and I’m not even 17 anymore! Even though it was four years, I feel so out of place.” Clutching the blanket, she began to ball it up in anger. Once it was scrunched up, she began hitting it over and over again. Each time she hit the balled-up blanket, she let out a furious cry. The adults watched her, saddened that she missed growing up with the people she knew. They didn’t try to stop her, for they all knew what it was like to be hurt by Dumbledore. Taking her anger out on the blanket and a few of the pillows left her tired. Still just as furious, but tired. Her body heaved with exhaustion, trembling from the adrenaline rush. Narcissa realized that she not only needed medical care, she also needed an emotional one. She settled down next to Zara and pulled her into a hug. Zara settled into her arms, letting her tears stream. “I swear, I don’t care about any other pain that comes my way. Dumbledore will pay for what he did to me,” she vowed to herself and the others. “And I will make sure that he won’t harm you either. Once I’m fully healed, I will help you in the fight. You saved me. It’ll be my pleasure to help you.” Wiping away her tears, she gathered herself back together. Once Zara calmed herself, she began feeling the pain she blocked out when she punched the blanket. “I think I took it out a little too much on the blanket,” she joked. Narcissa lightly chuckled, trying to get the girl to smile. “I’ll go grab another potion for you. It’s time for another dose of it anyway.” Narcissa retreated to the kitchen. Looking behind, she saw that her husband and the others were making a light conversation with Zara. It looked like Zara didn’t mind talking about what happened. She didn’t seem uncomfortable; although, she kept balling her hands into tight fists. Narcissa grabbed a vial and filled it with the potion. She pocketed that and went over to the stove to pour some of the soup she made for Zara into a bowl. With the hot soup in hand, she balanced it over to her. “-my friends and I were at the top of the class. In Slytherin anyways. We were so happy that we were going to graduate with one of the highest honors. We planned to go celebrate our graduation at Hogsmeade, spending the entire night there celebrating….I bet they had a lot of fun without me,” Zara trailed off from her story. “Don’t be sad. Once Dumbledore is stopped, you’ll be able to graduate,” Narcissa said, setting down Zara’s food and handing her the medicine. “Take this before you eat. Besides, even though you are physically 17, at least you’ll look younger than usual since you are technically 21.” Zara laughed at her comment. “Yeah, that’s true!” Lucius, Elaina, and Sirius joined in. Zara sighed, hoping that what Narcissa said would come true. She quickly drained the vial of its contents, the bitterness of it rolling in her mouth. The bitter flavor disappeared once she took a small sip of her soup. Zara looked up at her rescuers. She had mixed feelings about her situation. Happy and relieved that she was alive, but angry that Dumbledore messed up her life. “Thank you. For all that you have done. I promise I will give it my all and will not mess up my second chance.”
The sun had already set from the horizon, dusk turning quickly into night. Being that it was already very dark in the forest, the traces of sunlight now gone made everything pitch black. After Lucius and Elaina slid down from the tree, Lucius lit the lantern he brought with a quick and wordless fire spell. “We have wands, you know,” Elaina reminded him, twirling hers around in her fingers. “I know. That’s exactly the reason why I’m not using it. If there really are other witches or wizards marching around here at night, I don’t want them tracing our magical light back to us. Our wands and weapons are going to be used for emergencies. Now, come on. Let’s go find those opals.” Lucius trekked forth, lighting the way for the both of them. They headed towards the middle of the thicket where the trees were denser. Elaina told him that the opals were most likely in an area where no one would go. That’s how rare they are. The two mostly focused on the ground, trying to find the opals among rocks. There wasn’t any glow coming from them, or from the piles littered next to them around that one. They found rocks, stones, pebbles, minerals, and gemstones of all kinds except for the opals they were searching for. Convinced they were looking for a needle in a haystack, Elaina rested against a tree for a minute to relax. “If you're tired of looking, we can stop. I’m pretty tired myself. There’s always tomorrow night to look for them. We can head back and I can ask Sirius to deploy that protective barrier. It’s not as strong with the stones, but it has kept us safe since we arrived.” As tempted Lucius was to head back to the cozy manor and sleep off his weariness until their next venture, he pushed himself to keep going. He didn’t want his wife to face another restless night shift. “I’m not that tired,” he lied. “We have to keep looking. They must be around her somewhere.” He began walking again, albeit much slower and with a tiny limp. They searched around, even going as far as retracing their steps and checking those areas again. They left no stone unchecked, no tree unshaken. Halfway through their second search, the lamp ran out of oil and the sparks dampened to mere smoke. Lucius filled it up with an extra bottle of lantern oil. Just as he was about to relight it, Elaina tapped his shoulder. “I’m almost done with the lantern. Give me a second,” Lucius said. “But, Lucius, there is…” she began. “Give me second. I have to light it. Stop being so impatient. It gets annoying ver…” She then shushed him. Lucius snapped. “Oh! So you can see better if I’m quiet?!” Elaina sighed. “Hang on a moment. Let your eyes adjust.” Although he wanted to keep telling her off, he listened and let his eyes adjust to the darkness. His view of the forest became brighter. Not as bright as with the lantern, but brighter to where he could see the trees in front of him. Looking at his surroundings, he noticed a part of the woods brighter than the rest. Elaina noticed he was looking in the same direction. “Look! There! You see it too? I think that’s it.” She ran after the light, invigorated by the discovery. Not wanting to get left behind and lost in the woods, he ran. If it wasn't for them chasing the light source, Lucius would have been twisted and turned around in these woods in seconds. “I hear water! We must be near one of the streams,” she yelled to him. Getting closer and closer to the source, they ran faster, hoping Elaina’s suspicions were correct. When they stopped, both of them were left in awe. A beautiful little stream ran through the forest, seemingly splitting it in half. Scattered in the bottom of the stream and the surrounding trees were the Opals of Protection. A huge break in trees allowed moonlight to shine through, its rays striking the gems to glow a luminous pale blue. Elaina squealed at the breathtaking scenery. Rolling up her sleeves, she ran to the edge of the water and began piling the gems in her arms like a child collecting seashells from the sand. Immersed in his own thoughts, Lucius grabbed an opal nestled near some overgrown roots and flowers. Inspecting it, he saw that it sparkled blue. He placed it in his pocket and grabbed a few strays and placed them in a jar. Turning to Elaina, he saw that her arms were full with the opalescent stones. Some of them fell from her grasp and she had to pick it back up, only to have three more fall as a result. Elaina had to crawl with them in order to be closer to the ground to easily pick up the fallen opals. “We have plenty of opals, Elaina. I don’t think you need that much,” he chuckled as he watched her shuffle on her knees and grab an opal. “I only need, humph, a few for, ugh, the spell. The rest, mmm, are extras in case we need them. Come on you little ones. Stay! I’m also going to make jewelry...there we go...out of a few.” Making it to the jar, she dumped them in, clinking together as they fell in. Holding out one of the opals, she held it out to Lucius. “With gems as gorgeous as these, how can you not pass up on making jewelry?” Smiling, she pocketed that one and let Lucius seal up the rest and put them in the bag. “We have all we need. Let’s head back to the manor and start the spell. That way, Narcissa can sleep for the remainder of the night,” Lucius said. Elaina stood up, brushing off the dirt and grass that stuck to her robe. “To head back, we should probably follow that stream. It looks like the one that’s near the manor. If it is, we’ll know the shortcut back to grab some more.” The pair then made their way down the stream, an occasional splash hitting their feet. Exhausted and relieved that they found the stones, Lucius looked up the sky, his eyes catching the bright moon. It was the first quarter that night. Half of the moon shone brightly, while the other was barely visible against the night sky. Lucius and Elaina made their way back to the Riddle manor. As the manor came into view, Elaina got the bag from Lucius. “I’ll enact the spell. It’s only fair since I'm the one who took you on this trip anyway. Go to Narcissa. Tell that she no longer has to worry about night patrol. She’ll be happy to see you.” Lucius looked up at the second-story windows of the manor. From there, he could see Narcissa standing at the bedroom windowsill. Like a queen surveying her kingdom, she looked out at the vast forest he and Elaina stood at the edge of. The two went their separate ways. Elaina began to place the opals around for the spell. Lucius headed inside, a wave of warmth washing over him from the fireplace. He saw Sirius passed out by the fireplace, looking quite comfy while Narcissa was keeping an eye on everything. Rolling his eyes, he quietly went up the stairs, careful not to make any of them creak under his weight. He went to the bedroom and saw his wife staring out the window, trying to stay awake. When Lucius entered the room, Narcissa heard him and she turned around. Her tired face lit up with a big smile. “Luci…you’re back. I’m so glad you’re...ok,” she yawned. Setting down his cloak, he went to the windowsill and hugged Narcissa. “I’m glad you are ok. You’ve worried me the past few days.” Narcissa gave him a sleepy mad face. “Staying on guard for the entire night without a shift change is tiring, Luci, but I chose to do this. I knew what I was getting myself into when I volunteered for that.” “I know, but you no longer have to worry about that anymore.” Narcissa did not know what he meant. “How do I not have to worry about that anymore? Are you going to take over?” Lucius shook his head. “No, no. Elaina and I found something that’ll end it. Something that will protect us while we sleep.” He took out the Opal of Protection that he pocketed earlier and held it out for Narcissa to see. She gasped at the glittering beauty, its soft glow brightening her face. “This...is called the Opal of Protection. Used alongside magical barrier spells, it enhances its protective properties and will hide the manor under an illusion. If anyone were to pass by, they would only see an empty field of grass and the defensive spells would keep them out. We would be living here and no one would know, safe from the outside world.” Narcissa looked to Lucius, then to the opal, and back to Lucius again. She then began fiddling with the braid in her hair. “You are the sweetest husband anyone can hope for. Thank you so much!” Standing on her toes, she gently pulled his face towards hers and kissed him. They kissed passionately in the moonlight that overlooked them. Breathless, they broke apart, Lucius turning to the side and blushing furiously. “You know, Luci, I was thinking about telling you off for missing the entire day with me. You also haven’t given me details about what is going on with Tom, Severus, and the rest of them. However, this present definitely makes up for that. So, tell me: how are they?” Lucius paused. “Uh, well…,” trying to find a way to break the news without sending her in a fit. “What is it? Is Tom going soft?” she asked sarcastically, laughing at her joke. “Actually, ...yes. Well, that’s what I think anyways,” Lucius said. She stopped laughing. “Wait...are you serious? What happened?” “Around the time that Tom contacted me in the fireplace, Hadrian and the others walked in, interrupting his meeting. From what I know, Hadrian took a Gryffindor prisoner after she attacked him and the other children.” Narcissa gasped. She panicked, worrying about Draco. “Is our son ok? Is he hurt?” To calm her down, Lucius placed her hands in his. He lightly squeezed their fingers together, his touch comforting her. “Draco’s fine. He was a little shaken up, but wasn’t injured in the fight. When they took that girl as prisoner, Valorie came to her defense and tried to prevent Tom from sentencing her to death. He actually listened and made a deal with the Gryffindor. To live, she had to prove her worth. She said that she can enchant weapons. I didn’t believe a word of it. An utterly ridiculous excuse if you ask me. I told Tom that it was all a lie and that he should dispose of her while he still had the upper hand. After a long debate, he decided to completely ignore my warnings and let the girl live.” His wife lifted an eyebrow. “Why in the world would he do that? The Tom we fought alongside would have killed her without a second glance. You are right. He has gone soft. Why did the others not try and convince him otherwise?” Lucius tried to break the other part of the bad news to her.  “Severus was about to after containing the girl’s heart in a box, but he collapsed. Hadrian and Tom took him to the hospital wing at once, so there wasn’t much time for debate afterwards.” Narcissa’s healer instincts took over. Pacing back and forth, she tried to guess what made Severus collapse. “...he must not be eating right again. Ugh! I told him not to be shy in asking Tom for more blood. Or, or, maybe he is stressed out. Those students outside of Slytherin already have it out for him. He doesn’t need to be worrying about…” Lucius stopped her in her tracks. She was already on the far side of the room, opposite of the window they looked out. “The reason that he collapsed was because of that glamour spell you told him to use. There were some unknown side effects that we were not aware of. That spell not only hides what you want unseen, but transforms it completely for full effect. It was preventing his unborn child from growing properly, thus affecting his health too. Luckily, he is ok and recovering nicely.”  Frowning, Narcissa went over to her spell books. Flipping from page to page, she worried about her mistake and began to second guess her other decisions she made for her friend. “How, how, how could I have been so careless?! None of these say that the glamour spell has this effect. Look!” she said, shoving the pages in his face. He only had a second to look at them before she took it back and flipped through it. “Narcissa. Narcissa!” Lucius tried to get her attention. She ignored him, focusing on doing a double-take on the pages she checked. To get her to stop, he swiped the book from her hands and held it away from her. “Give back the book, Luci!” Holding the book behind his back, he tried once again to calm her. “I will give it back. But you need to realize that what happened was an honest mistake. An accident. Don’t blame yourself. You are one of the finest healers in the magic community. Others would probably make the same mistakes multiple times and not even know what they did wrong. You fix your mistakes, and you shouldn’t let this one bring you down.” She looked up at her husband. “Luci, accident or not, Severus is my friend. Our friend. I don’t want something bad to happen because of one little mistake.” On the verge of tears, Lucius hugged her close to his chest. He smoothed out a few loose strands of hair that fell out of her braid. “Cissy, your skills are amazing. Please don’t be sad. Severus is ok, and you're still the greatest healer. Ok?” Narcissa sniffed, wiping a rogue tear that fell down her cheek. “Ok….If something does happen though, I hold you responsible for jinxing it,” she half-playfully pouted. The two smiled at each other. Returning to the window, they looked out at the scenery in front of them, the half moon almost at its peak in the sky. Lucius and Narcissa held each other in a loving embrace, watching the blue light from Elaina’s protection spell cover them and the entire manor.

After the incident with Hadrian, Draco, and Severus, Tom just wanted to sleep, but he noticed Severus was acting weird. “Severus, love, are you ok?” Tom turned his head to look behind him at his husband. “Yes, why do you ask?” “You look tired.”  Severus didn’t answer. Tom fully turned to face his husband. “Severus, have you eaten today?” Severus gave Tom a guilty look. “Severus!” “What?! I wasn’t hungry earlier!” “Before we go to bed, I’ll let you feed. Ok?” “Fine.” Tom placed his hand on his lover's stomach. “You wouldn’t want to harm our unborn child, now would you?” Severus’s face turned bright red as he pushed Tom’s hand away from his stomach. “I know! Calm down!”  “You’re so overprotective.” “For good reasons Severus.” Severus just looked at Tom. Not a look of hate, but a look of hunger. “You’re that hungry, aren’t you? Alright. Let’s go.”  Tom picked up Severus and took him to the upstairs guest bedroom. He closed the door and they walked over to the bed. Severus had laid down comfortably while Tom took off his coat. “Severus,” he said as he walked toward his mate. “This is the last time you starve yourself.” Severus slyly smiled at him in response. “You said that the last time it happened. And the time before that.” Tom shook his head. He was never going to get through to his husband. “I know. However, you need to keep in mind that we are going to have a third child. You need to be more careful. I want you both in good health,” he sighed exasperatedly. He placed his hand on Severus’ stomach and stroked it. “Last time, you were not pregnant, Severus. You could fatally hurt yourself and the baby if proper precautions are not taken. That nearly happened with our Hadrian and Valorie. Do you not remember how you nearly died giving birth to them because you did not feed that day?” he warned. Severus was starting to get annoyed with Tom now. “How could I remember?! I was in so much pain!” he yelled. Severus rolled to his side of the bed, away from Tom. He didn’t like it when Tom pointed out his flaws and past mistakes. It made him feel inferior. Tom realized what he said had hurt Severus’ feelings. He had a tendency to speak without thinking. Tom followed him and cradled Severus in his arms. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to hurt you. You scare me whenever you put yourself in harm's way. When I say these things, I only say them for your wellbeing. And our little one.” Severus turned to face Tom, caressing his face. They kissed tenderly for a few minutes and pulled away, gasping for air. “Would you like to feed, my dark angel?” Tom whispered. Severus gazed at him with hunger and love in his eyes, saying the word that would allow him to satisfy his desires. “Yes,” he breathed. He grasped Tom’s shoulder with one hand and firmly held him down. His other hand pressed against his mate’s cheek, facing him away from what was going to be a bloody sight. Severus lowered his head to Tom’s neck, inhaling his scent. It smelled sweeter than before, driving him crazy. His vampire teeth flashed in the moonlight as he bit into his mate’s neck. The blood seeped into Severus’ mouth, its unnaturally sugary sweet taste filling his hunger. It was warm and comforting; he loved his husband’s blood. Tom gasped quietly at the bite, trying to hold in the pain he felt. Whenever Severus was starving, he bit harder than usual. As long as he kept in mind that his blood fed his husband, the pain didn’t exist to him. Severus took another bite, his tongue lapping up the blood. He felt the red liquid drench his throat, making him want more of it. He slowly took more bites, taking in as much blood as he could. Tom felt some of it dribble down his neck, creeping slowly to his shoulders. This was the most awkward part of the feeding. Even though he had been feeding Severus for a long time, it still made chills roll down his spine. Severus took his last bite, at last satisfying his hunger. His mind was more clear and his stomach much more full. He wiped away the blood from his lips, finishing his last step of his meal. Tom looked at him, breathing wildy. “Satisfied?” Tom asked. Severus smiled in response, feeling as if he was the luckiest person in the world. The dark lord held out his arms to his husband, calling him to his side. Severus laid down on Tom’s chest, his heart a lullaby. The two embraced each other in the dark of night, their love and hunger filled once more.
Remy was close to tears. Not from sadness, but from anger and betrayal. She couldn’t believe she had been lied to all of her life. “I have to get these spells and blocks off right away and contact my family,” she thought. “I want all these blocks off now, please.” Stoneheart nodded to the girl and led her to the same room where Hadrian removed his blocks and spells. Stoneheart gave Remy a vile of a potion to rid her of all spells and blocks. Once she finished, she looked into a mirror that the goblin had handed her. Remy almost dropped it from shock. She looked so much like her mother. Same grayish blue eyes and brown hair, but she had black mixed in. She was also fairly tall, going from 5’5 to 5’7. Her ears and tail were still in place, not receding into wherever they’re supposed to go. Remy looked at her new self. Her true self. “So this is what I really look like,” she thought as she examined her face. Remy snapped out of her trance, refocusing on the task at hand. She turned to the Stoneheart and asked her to contact her real parents. Remy waited for an hour, wondering endlessly about her parents. Her thoughts spun around, thinking about what they would think of her, contemplating on how they would react to who she was, pondering ceaselessly of what is going to happen to her life and most importantly, her education. Remy was so lost in thought, she didn’t hear her parents walk in. “Little Remy, is that you?” Remus asked. Remy looked up, no longer lost in thought. She gazed at her parents; everything she thought about this reunion was better than what she prepared for. The girl thought that her real parents were going to disown her when they first laid eyes on her. Yet, they looked at her with love and warmth. Remy got up and ran to them, hugging them with all the love she had. “I always felt there was a gaping hole in my heart. That I was missing a piece of myself. A piece of my family. Now I know why,” she sobbed. Remus handed her to Sirius and held her closer, cradling his lost daughter in his arms. “You’re safe now, pup. You’re home.” The three of them hugged for what seemed like an eternity. Stoneheart interrupted them, clearly not reading the room. “I know you are having a moment, but can you get out?” she grunted. Sirius straightened himself, remembering there were others in the room. “Right,” he cleared his throat. “We’ve been in this room long enough. Stoneheart, can you please take us to our vault?” “Of course, Lord Black,” Stoneheart grumbled. They headed to the vault to grab their money. When the goblin opened up their vault, Remy looked at all the Galleons and Sickles. There were stacks upon stacks of money, piled to the ceiling. “This is a lot of money. Much more than I had in my own vault,” she commented. “Well, this is yours now. Being a part of our family means inheriting all this too,” Remus told her. The stumpy goblin handed Remy a small satchel, urging the young lady to fill her wallet. Remy reached out for the money, stuffing in many Galleons and a few Sickles here and there. After her wallet was full, she realized that she needed to complete a favor for her friend. “ Before I go, I would like to return my money to Harry Potter,” she said. Stoneheart cocked her head in confusion. “Harry Potter? Don’t you mean Hadrian Riddle?” It was Remy’s turn to look at Stoneheart with a confused look. “Hadrian Riddle? Who is Hadrian Riddle?” Remy asked. “Hadrian Riddle is the son of the Dark Lord and the Potions Master. Like you, he was put under a fake name, which was Harry Potter,” the female goblin answered. Remy was in shock. First, she found out that she wasn’t a Granger, but a Lupin-Black. Now, she found out that Harry Potter is really Hadrian Riddle, the son of Tom Riddle and Severus Snape. “Remy, are you ok?” Remus looked at his daughter with a worried look. “I’m fine. Just a lot to process.” Remus just smiled at the shaken girl. “If you want, we can go meet his family.” Remy smiled at the thought. She longed to see her old friend, except he was now different, and so was she. “I think I’d like that,” she responded. After they retrieved their money and other belongings, the three set off to see Hadrian. On the way, she was thinking if Harry, Hadrian had changed, just like she did. “Maybe he took the same potion I did and his appearance changed. I wonder if he is the same Harry I knew not so long ago. He might be handling this better than I am,” she thought. The walk to their destination was not long. Remy was surprised to see that they ended up at Malfoy Manor. “Are you crazy? Why are we going to the Malfoy Manor? I hate the Malfoys if you don’t mind me saying. They were insulting to me and Draco was such a git during three years of school,” she shouted. Remus tried to explain to her why they were there. “Look, I know you two haven’t gotten along. But today, I need you to be civil. Hadrian is staying temporarily at the Malfoy Manor while his own is being rebuilt. Please, I just need you to tolerate them for our visit. But, if that Malfoy kid insults you, we are out the door. Ok?” he compromised. Remy thought this through with her usual logic and reason. Draco could have changed too, so maybe he wasn’t as bad as before. “I suppose I could give him a second chance,” she pouted. Remus and Sirius smiled at their daughter, proud that she made the right choice. “Thank you, Remy,” her mother said. The family walked up to the door with smiles on their faces. Remy was the one who knocked on the door, taking initiative on her “second chance promise”. When the door opened, she didn’t expect a girl to answer. The girl had long and dark hair, pitch black eyes, and a fierce but warm smile. “She looks stunning,” the wolf girl thought. Remy’s ears and tail popped out twitching, along with her jaw hanging wide open. She was practically drooling. Remy snapped out of her trance, realizing what she was doing. “I-I’m sorry. I don’t know what came over me. M-m-my name is Remy, and this is my mother and father,” she stammered. Valorie looked around, trying to find the right words to say. She, too, was acting very goofy. “It’s amazing to meet you Remy. And it is nice to meet your parents too. Uhhh… welcome to the Malfoy Manor. I’m Valorie Riddle.” The two stared at each other for a while, until Sirius interrupted them. “Ahem. I know you two might be engaged in a staring contest right now, but can we come in?” he prompted. Valorie remembered what she was doing: opening the door for her guests. She let the family in, averting her eyes when Remy walked through. Val led them to the living room where Hadrian was standing. “This is my brother, Hadrian Riddle. Hades, this is…” She didn’t finish her sentence, for her twin brother ran to hug Sirius and Remus. When he turned to the girl next to them, he was speechless. The girl in front of him looked just like Hermione, except she had different colored hair and wolf ears and a tail. “Hermione, is that you?” he asked. The girl nodded her head. “It’s me. But, my name is Remy now.” Hadrian couldn’t believe that this was his best friend. He hugged her tight, making up for the months he didn’t see her. “I missed you so much Harry, I mean Hadrian,” she whispered. The two hugged for a while, old friends made new. The two broke the hug, tears in both of their eyes. Remy’s mother and father were talking to Hadrian in the dining room, snacking on food that was left out. Valorie led Remy to a free couch that was not taken up by the wildly sleeping girl. Remy never saw anyone sleep so crazily. The Riddle girl caught her staring at her aunt. “Don’t mind her. That’s my Aunt Elaina. She’s a bit of a wild card, both in and out of sleep,” Valorie explained. Rem giggled in response. She never giggled before today. She thought it was odd that her behavior was out of control today. And it was all because of Valorie. When that girl was around, her heart pounded like crazy, she felt giddy and out of breath, and she couldn’t stop smiling. “What’s happening to me? Stop it Remy! You are making a fool of yourself,” she scolded. Valorie walked up to Remy with an evaluating look on her face. An awkward silence filled the room, making the two girls blush. Remy’s tail wagged in response to the weird gesture. She had to ask the girl the question that had been nagging in the back of her mind. “You’re my mate, aren’t you?” she asked the peculiar girl. “Ummm...maybe?” Valorie questioned. It finally made sense. That wonderful feeling she had was because they were mates. When Remy took the inheritance test, she saw Valorie’s name appear under “mate” on the parchment. Everything made sense now. Remy heard footsteps coming from the stairs. She turned around to see a tired looking Draco walking down. Draco noticed the girl. “Hello, I’m Draco Malfoy. You?” Remy was about to say something rude, when she realized that Draco didn’t recognize her. “Oh, sorry. I’m Remy. Remy Lupin-Black.” Draco nodded his head and walked over to Hadrian putting his arms around the boy’s waist. Remy thought this was a weird gesture. Then, it clicked in her head: they are mates. “Ooookay...This is a little weird. Not going to get involved in whatever this is,” she said. At that moment, Elaina woke up. She saw the two holding each other. Elaina skipped up to them, getting them roped in a group hug. “Hello you two lovebirds. It’s nice to see you again tonight,”she yawned. “Or that…” Remy said quietly. Elaina turned to the girl, ecstatic that she was making many new friends in one day. “Hi there. I’m Elaina, Hadrian and Valorie’s aunt. I have been meeting lots of new people today. This is the best day ever. Get in here.” Elaina pulled the young woman into a bear hug, squeezing the life out of her. “It’s nice to meet you too…” she rasped. Elaina let Remy go, leaving her shaken up. “I’m surprised you’re able to endure her hugs,” Draco told her. “Those hugs are nothing but a nuisance and unbelievably nauseating,” he drawled. Elaina turned on him, changing from sweet to scary. “Let me tell you something, Malfoy. Those hugs are a part of who I am. I am brave, strong, loyal, and give great hugs. If you insult my hugs again, I will tie you to a tree and dangle you over a lake of piranhas,” she threatened. Draco hid behind Remy, making her even more confused than she already was. “Move it, Malfoy. Go hide behind your boyfriend. It’s what you do best,” she hissed as she pushed him off of her. Draco thought it was weird that his guest was now insulting him. “How dare you say that to me!” he snapped. “You know, you have been acting very odd. You act like you know me, even though we just met. Who are you really, Ms. Lupin-Black?” Remy had to tell him. He had to know, plus she had to get the rage out of her system. “I am Remy Lupin-Black, formerly known as Hermione Granger. And for some sick, twisted reason, we are family. I don’t know why or how, but I do know this Malfoy. You are not my family!” Hadrian stepped in, determined to protect his mate. His black wings sprouted from his back, causing Remy to freeze in fear. “Don’t speak to him that way! No one hurts my mate, got it?!” he yelled, his red eyes glowing brightly. Remy looked at her friend with shock. Her ears drooped as she backed away from the angered veela. “S-sorry Hadrian.” Hadrian calmed down and accepted her apologies. Just then, a very annoyed Tom walked down the stairs.
Severus was sitting on the bed, feeding Amelia from a bottle. He heard the door open and he saw Tom walk in. “I’m so dead” was all Severus thought as Tom approached him. “May I see her?” Severus looked up in shock. He nodded his head quickly as he handed the newborn to the taller male. “She’s so tiny.” Tom couldn’t believe that someone could just abandon a child, no less a newborn. “She’s only a few hours old.” Severus looked at the child with a sad look in his eyes. Tom noticed the sad look in his mate’s eyes. He handed Amelia back to Severus. “We should go to Diagon Alley today so the kids can get their supplies for Hogwarts.” Severus got up holding Amelia and walked out with Tom to get kids. After gathering everyone, they were on their way to Diagon Alley. The first place they went to was Ollivanders for Hadrian, Remy and Valorie’s wands. After getting their wands, they ran into the Weasleys. “Who’s your little slut, Malfoy?” Ron teased meanly as Draco’s eyes flared red for a moment. Ginny on the other hand, was staring at baby Amelia, who was being held by Severus. Severus noticed the girl staring at Amelia. “What’s the matter Ms.Weasley? Never seen such a beautiful child?” Severus’s voice was laced with venom and he looked at the youngest Weasley. “N-no sir.” Severus swiftly moved next to her whispering: “You shouldn’t have abandoned her Ms.Weasley. I will torment you ‘til you learn not to abandon children like Ameila here.” Ginny noticeably paled as he walked away. “Gin, are you ok?” Mrs. Weasley noticed her daughter’s face, worried about what the potions teacher had told her. “It’s fine, Mum. He was just reminding me to study for his class.” Severus gave her a cold smile before looking at the little girl, his eyes full of love. Amelia giggled at her adoptive mother. “Mother, can we go now? I can’t stand staying with these traitors anymore,” Hadrian whined. Severus looked at his son and agreed, leaving the Weasleys in shock. Hadrian, Draco, and Severus met the others and at the Three Broomsticks for dinner. When Hadrian, Draco, and Severus arrived at the restaurant, they saw that the others got a table. Elaina flagged them over and gave them each a hug, with Draco trying to squirm his way out of it. After a few minutes of sitting, the owner of the Tavern, Madam Rosmerta, saw Severus and walked over to him. “Severus, darling!” she trilled. The man turned to see her flouncing over to their table, her apron spotted with flour and mead stains. “Rosmerta, how are you doing this fine evening?” he politely asked her. She gave him a big smile, her joy glowing brighter. “Great, old friend! After last year's Dementor “infestation”, the bar has been much more cheerful than usual. You never really know how much happiness is given until you have Dementors take it all away.” Severus nodded in agreement, knowing how much pain the Dementors brought him last year. Rosmerta noticed him looking down in the dumps when she mentioned the Dementors, so she changed the subject to something else. “It’s nice to see that you brought some familiar faces. Malfoys, Lupin-Blacks, and Elaina, it’s wonderful to see you all again,” she greeted them. As she turned to the teens, she realized she has never seen them before. “Who are these adorable children? Are they students at Hogwarts?” Severus turned to the teens, forgetting that he didn’t introduce them. “Well, the kids are going to become official students as of tomorrow. This is Valorie and Hadrian Riddle, and that is Remy Lupin-Black. The children returned to us after all these years, Rosmerta. We found them a month ago and we have been living happily ever since.” Rosmerta clasped his hands in hers, happy their family is reunited. “I’m so glad they came. It’s always a heartwarming sight to see a family reunited once more,” she squealed. “I’ll be right back. I’m just gonna go and grab your food. Once again, so wonderful to see you.” The lady bobbed away, her hair bouncing in the wake. After her retreat to the kitchen, her arms were piled with delicious spreads: potato soups, garden salads, rotisserie smoked chicken, corn on the cob, shepherd's pies, beef pasties, and a giant platter of cinnamon honey cake. Everyone eyed the food with big grins as she set the plates, intent on devouring the delightful meal. They grabbed what they desired and piled it on. “Enjoy, everyone. This food was created with love in our hearts.” Rosmerta innocently leaned towards Severus, trying not to draw attention. “You can head to the back and eat, Severus,” she whispered. He nodded slightly, glad that she remembered his ‘eating habits’. Severus handed Amelia to Hadrian, who held her in the crook of his arms. Tom and Severus then headed to the back of the pub so Severus could finally feed. The feeding lasted a few minutes, Tom’s blood satisfying his mate’s hunger. After Severus ate, they waited a few minutes, letting Tom’s neck stop dripping blood. Severus wiped the blood from Tom’s neck and from his own face. “I’m glad that we are a normal family again,” Severus said to Tom. “I agree,” Tom spoke. “With our family by our side, we can stop Dumbledore and live out our life in peace.” The two pressed their foreheads together, which brought them to kiss each other. A minute passed, the two mates out of breath. “Come on,” Severus called out to Tom. “We should head back.” Tom got up and brushed off his cloak. Tom and Severus walked back to their table, past all the rambunctious customers. When the table was within view, they saw an additional person sitting at the table: Alastor Moody. They realized that he was interrogating their family. They silently creeped toward him, trying to listen to what he was saying. “Don’t try to deny it. I know you are hiding something. With the track record of you lot,” he grumbled as he gestured to the Malfoys. “...and no track record of yours,” he pointed to their children. “I know something is off.” Moody stopped talking abruptly, as if he heard something deplorable. “Tom. Severus. Trying to sneak up on me, are ya?” he questioned without turning around. The two of them straightened in surprise, trying to compose themselves quickly. Moody swivelled around in his chair, his good eye glaring at the both of them and his magic one twitching wildly. “Always thought I would see you both again. Not under these circumstances, though. Hoped to see you both bound in chains and rotting in Azkaban. Sadly, we can’t all get what we want,” he barked. Tom pushed Severus behind him and pulled out his wand, not wanting anything bad to happen to his husband or unborn child. “Like that’s ever going to happen.” Tom’s voice was laced with venom as he glared at the one eyed man. Moody grinned maniacally at Tom, trying to look as innocent as possible, but clearly failing. “I came into the pub and I heard that this was your table. When I saw who was there, I was trying to strike up a conversation with your buddies. Not much of talkers, they were,” the auror growled. “I thought it was odd that the Malfoys were at your table, the Lupin-Blacks too. From the many stories I heard, things have been pretty rocky between you all. It’s not likely that you would invite such people to dinner as if they have done no harm. Then, I spotted the youngsters here. I was trying to ask them who their parents were and if they are students at Hogwarts. Apparently, they are children of few words,” he sneered. “I was trying to ask them how they know you, but they don’t seem friendly to talking.” Tom gave Moody a death glare, trying to convey that he was not one to be messed with. “Your reputation is well known throughout the magical community, Alastor,” Tom said in a smooth voice. “The fearsome auror who has imprisoned even the fiercest witches and wizards. But was known to have turned mad one night, not being able to recognize who was friend and who was foe. If anything, these children are smart to not have spoken to you. One little word from their mouths could have killed them with your madness running around.” Moody scoffed at him, knowing that his words would not faze him. Alastor stood up, face-to-face with Tom. They glared at each other for what seemed like forever, until Alastor cracked a small smile. “Why hasn’t your little housewife spoken? Is he too scared?” Moody mocked as Severus unconsciously placed his arms over his stomach, as if trying to protect his unborn child. “How dare you say such a thing?!” Tom growled ferociously, a feral beast awakening inside of him. He wanted to blast Mad-Eye Moody with the killing curse, but that would just provoke chaos. Tom fell silent, unable to say more without revealing his secrets. He put his wand back in his cloak, but still remained his defense stance in front of his mate. Moody smiled like he won this little battle. The auror grabbed his staff from the ground and glared at the family sitting around the table. He then turned to Tom and Severus, the fury in his eyes burning bright. “I’ll let you and your friends go for now, but I’ll find the truth sooner or later. I don’t care what it takes. I’m going to drag your twisted secrets out of you, even if I have to pluck it from your dead body.” Moody hobbled away from them and headed out of the Three Broomsticks, slamming the door behind him. Tom and Severus turned to their family, seeing the scared looks on their faces. “Is everyone ok?” Tom asked them. They nodded stiffly, still stricken from their encounter with that man. Narcissa got up from her chair, heading over to Severus. She noticed that he was pale and was panicking again. “Deep breaths, Severus. Focus on your breathing,” she commanded. Tom held Severus close to his chest, trying to calm him down. After Severus calmed down, they sat down in their chairs. Tom asked his family if Moody tried to do anything to harm them. “No. He was instigating us, trying to pry out information. I hid Amelia in the folds of my cloak when I saw him coming toward us. Luckily, she was asleep.” Hadrian brought out little Amelia who was sleeping soundly in his arms. Severus breathed a sigh of relief that she was ok. “Father, who was that man? Why was he asking about us? How do you know him?” Tom turned to look at his children, his eyes full of pain. “His name is Alastor Moody. He’s the one who hunted us down and nearly killed you Hades.” Hadrian was in shock. “That man tried to kill me and he’s the one who found my family. HE tore us apart.” Severus could see the enraged look on his son’s face. “Hades, he’ll get what he deserves. Trust me.” The family ate the rest of their meal in silence, not wanting to provoke anyone else in the tavern. After their meal, they walked home. They were cautious during their return to the Malfoy Manor, keeping an eye out for anyone that might ambush them. Exhausted from their long walk to the manor, they flocked to the living room and rested their tired feet. “Ugh, I never thought a family dinner would be so exhausting. If it wasn’t for that Moody weirdo, it would have been a nice outing,” Valorie complained. She plopped down on the couch, lifting her legs to the armrest and slapped a pillow over her face. She screamed a high-pitched scream into the cushion, but some of it was muffled. “Don’t mind me. I’m just going to scream into this for a little while.” Val resumed her screaming and everyone looked at Tom and Severus for a plan. “Sev, what are we going to do? We need a plan to stop Dumbledore. The train to Hogwarts leaves tomorrow and we don’t know our tasks yet,” Elaina pouted. Severus and Tom looked around at their family, who were anxious to hear their roles for the war. “I hate having to assign these tasks to you. I care about you all too much to see any of you hurt. But, this is a war. With your help, the scales of justice will tip in our favor,” Severus told them. He first looked to Lucius, Narcissa, Sirius, and his sister for their help. “I need you to stay here and hold down our base. I don’t want you to get caught by Dumb-as-a-Door and his chickens. The Riddle Manor should be done with the rebuilding. If anything were to happen, you’ll be summoned by your Dark Marks. The four of them looked down to their arms and rolled up their sleeves. The Dark Mark was tattooed on their forearms, smoking with magic. Narcissa looked up at Severus with concern. “I’ll keep contact with you using a two-way mirror. Just to make sure that you and the baby are well.” Lucius put his arm around his wife and pulled her into his arms. “I’ll cast the protection spells around the Riddle Manor. No one will be able to infiltrate or find it,” he vowed. Severus nodded his approval, glad that this planning session was going well. He turned to Hadrian, Valorie, Draco, and Remy next. “You four will go to Hogwarts as normal, but you need to keep an eye out for a few things. Hadrian and Remy, you two will be transfer students under your new names. Your past selves will disappear soon. And when I say ‘disappear’, I mean that you two will have your former identities killed.” Remy and Hadrian looked at each other in confusion. “What do you mean by ‘killed’?” Remy asked nervously. Severus gave her a weird look, as if she should have already figured it out. “I will tell everyone at Hogwarts that you are dead.” Hadrian and Remy sat there in shock, letting that plan sink into their heads. When it processed, they snapped up in surprise. “WHAT?!” they yelled in unison. “Why would you say that Harry and Hermione had died?! Can’t you say that we transferred to another school or something?” Hadrian yelled. Severus shook his head, knowing that plan would not work. “Dumbledore will ask the other schools’ headmasters if you are there at that school. If he finds out that it is a lie, our plan will be ruined and I might be killed. He will pursue ‘Harry’ and ‘Hermione’ endlessly until he finds them. You will not be safe if that were to happen. But, if I were to say that the Dark Lord killed them, Dumbledore will end his watch over your former selves. Sure, your classmates will be sad, but this is for the good of our family and everyone in the magic community,” he explained. Remy and Hadrian nodded solemnly. Remy’s mother walked up to her, placing a hand on her shoulder. “Don’t worry, pup. I’ll be there at Hogwarts with you. With me there, you don’t have to worry about being alone. Remy smiled a little and hugged her mother. “Thanks, mother. For everything,” she said. Severus talked to Valorie next, taking away the pillow that was covering her face. “Val, you will also be under as a transfer student. You are to keep a close eye on Dumbledore’s movements and make sure he is not planning anything against us. You have the most experience in hiding and planning counter attacks against others, so that is why this job is for you.” Valorie hung her head back, thinking about how that was going to work. “It sounds like a good enough plan,” she said. “It sounds even better because I am in charge.” Draco groaned in response, not wanting to deal with Valorie’s boastings. His grumblings had made Severus turn to him and he was also given orders. “Draco, I want you to protect Hadrian. After the story you heard, you know that he holds tremendous power. If Dumbledore were to find that out, he would try to take it for himself. Please, keep him safe,” he pleaded. Draco straightened in his seat, ready to help. If anything was about Hadrian, he would be there by his side. “I promise I will keep him safe. No one will harm him with me around,” he said as he hugged his mate. “I need all of you to keep up your covers,” he addressed them. “No one is supposed to find out anything. If anyone were to learn the truth, we would have to hide you and regroup.” Tom stepped in and held his mate close. “I’m going to go to Hogwarts with Hadrian as his familiar. If you see black mamba slithering around the corridors, don’t kick the snake. I despise that people do that to snakes. Especially me,” he quipped. “I will be watching the students and making sure they are not plotting anything against you. If anyone were to harm you, I will bite them. Don’t be surprised if you find a student dead the next morning. But, act surprised for the sake of keeping face.” The kids nodded to his plan, a little uneasy about finding dead students. Severus cuddled next to Tom, comforted by his touch. He lifted his head from Tom’s shoulders, addressing everyone. “As for me, I will return to my position as Hogwarts’s Potions Teacher. I’ll try to get as close as I can to Dumbledore and…” he started. Tom interrupted him, a jealous look on his face. “Not too close, I hope.” Severus glared at him for interrupting his thoughts. “Shut up!” he scolded him. “You know what I am talking about.” Severus took a breath and resumed what he was saying before. “I’ll try to get as close as I can to Dumbledore and find out if he has any plans against us. And if I have the opportunity, I will kill him.” Tom shot out of his chair, not letting Severus go along with that idea. “No! Absolutely not. Without any of us to support you, you are not going to kill him.”   Severus just pouted at Tom before looking away.  “We should go to our manor and start packing. Hadrian, Valorie I have something to show you both.” Severus said as he and Tom walked to the front door with Hadrian and Valorie.
When Hadrian woke up, he slightly panicked. Once he looked around, he saw Draco asleep next to him. Hadrian smiled a little as he got up. He wanted to ask his father about what happened to his mother. As Hadrian walked down the stairs, he saw his father and mother sitting on the couch. His father was scolding his mother for last night. “Severus, you shouldn’t have done that last night. You could have seriously hurt yourself.” “Father, what happened last night?” Both his parents turned to look at their son. “Your mother here decided to shadow travel,” Severus pouted as Tom glared at him. “I said I was sorry!” “Father, what's wrong with Mother and why isn’t he allowed to shadow travel? Please, tell me.” Tom looked at Hadrian before saying: “Alright, but you should sit down.” Hadrian obeyed and sat down in the chair in front of his parents. “Well, what is it?” Tom glanced at Severus before looking at Hadrian. “Your mother is pregnant, Hades.” Hadrian wasn’t expecting that. “A new sibling. Wow. I wonder why they didn’t tell me sooner.” “Why didn’t you two tell me this earlier?” Hadrian looked at his parents with a somewhat disappointed look on his face. “We only found out a week ago. The day before we found you to be accurate.” This time it was his mother who spoke, his hand unconsciously moving toward his stomach. “Will you be able to teach at Hogwarts, Mother? With what happens in Potions most of the time, it's risky.” Hadrian gave his mother a worried look. “I’ll be teaching, but I'll have to use protection charms and a glamor to hide my stomach there. Also, your father has promised to be in his animagus form this year” Severus gave his son a look. “Ok, and Father can stay with me as my familiar. If that's ok with you Mother.” Hadrian glanced at both of his parents. “If you want to, Hades.” Severus looked at the teen and gave him a small smile. That just weirded Hadrian out. He’s never seen his mother smile before. “Hades are you ok?” Tom saw the weirded out look that his son had on his face. “Yeah....Just never seen Mother smile or laugh before.” That caused his mother to giggle slightly. “Mother, stop. You’re creeping me out.”  After Severus calmed down, he apologized to Hadrian. “Anyways, when are we going back to school?” “About a month from now. Why?” “Just wondering.” Hadrian smiled at his parents. “Also, when’s training Mother?” “Starting after breakfast,” Severus replied to his son.
Sleeping on a couch near the dying fire, Lucius woke up from a good night’s rest. He craned his head to look at the fire grate. Just yesterday, he was informed by Tom that Karkaroff was rejoining the Death Eater’s ranks. Also yesterday, he witnessed the capture and torture of Hadrian’s prisoner. Lucius usually was not one to question Tom’s decisions, but his choice seemed lenient, even for his standards. Lucius guessed it was because Valorie tried to change his mind. Fatherhood changed Tom in more than one way it seemed. Lucius got up, stretching from his position, and got up to greet the others. He walked past almost-finished hallways, the furnishings still being placed around. Lucius and his team lived in the Riddle manor for a couple of days now. It was larger than his own home, but it had a familiar feel as if it were his own. Heading into the kitchen, he greeted the others. “Good morning, Lucius!” Elaina and Sirius gave him a hug as he made his way to the table. “Narcissa is still sleeping upstairs. She was very tired from keeping watch,” Elaina said sleepily. Lucius sighed contently. “Of course. She must be exhausted. The double shift was tough for her, since it was in the middle of the night. Luckily, the investigation for intruders kept the manor safe.” He poured himself tea and served himself breakfast. As he ate, Elaina slid next to him with her chair. “Luci, I need a favor from you.” she piped in a sing-song voice. “It must be a big one, or you wouldn’t have called me by my nickname. If it’s about adding a house ghost to the manor, I’m not helping you there.” Sirius overheard them and laughed. “A house ghost? Elaina, you know how hard it is to get a house ghost, right? By the second week, you want it gone. House ghosts aren’t worth the hassle, and I don’t think that Tom and Severus would like an extra resident here.” Elaina rolled her eyes at the two of them. “Ha ha. Laugh it up while you can. I can convince them to take in a house ghost. But, that’s not what I was talking about,” she said dryly and then returned her attention to Lucius. “What I need help with is a lot harder than getting a house ghost. That’s why I am asking you. In the forest surrounding the manor, is something that can make our intruder problems go away like that,” snapping her fingers for emphasis. Instantly, Lucius was intrigued. Many Muggles and other wanderers kept stumbling awfully close to the manor. Luckily, none of them were harmful or any of Dumbledore’s allies. “You have my attention now. Anything to keep Narcissa from having night patrol. What is it?” Elaina leaned in like she was trying to prevent others from listening in. “They are called the Opals of Protection. I heard that there are many scattered around this area. Thing is, it’s hard to find them in the daytime; well, hard to find them overall. You have to search real closely to find them. They blend in well with all the other stones in the forest. I heard that in the night, they faintly glow under the moon. With these stones, I can enhance the protection spells you cast over the manor and hide it under an illusion. So, can you help me find some?” Lucius paused. Elaina told him that the mission was going to be harder than convincing Tom and Severus to take in a house ghost. All they were doing was harvesting stones from the ground. How hard was that? He raised an eyebrow, hesitant to get caught up in her lofty antics. “What’s the catch?” he asked her. “No catch. I just need help getting these stones,” she smiled. He believed her for a second. There weren’t any strings attached when there were favors with Elaina. However, there usually was something extra, unintended or not. Lucius gave in. “Alright. I will help.” Elaina squealed in excitement. “Yay! We leave in one hour. You better go pack anything you need for the trip. We are going to be out there for a while. Oh, and also dress warm. It gets pretty cold at night.” Elaina leapt up from the chair. She started to make her way towards her brother’s room, humming as she went. Lucius got up and caught her arm before she left the room. “Wait, wait, wait. You said it’d be the easiest to find the opals when they are glowing at night. Why are we leaving in an hour?” Elaina lightly brushed his hand off her arm. “Well, that’s because we are going to patrol the forest to make sure there isn’t anyone there. Also, we need to stock up on herbs for potions. We’re kind of running low and I would like your help carrying them as we go along. So, go eat your breakfast, you snail.” Elaina left Lucius with Sirius, who snickered at the sight. “She’s got you wrapped up in some predicament, didn’t she?” he laughed. Returning to his breakfast, Lucius ate quickly, ignoring Sirius’s comments. He went upstairs to the bedroom that he and his wife were occupying. He entered the room quietly so as to not wake her, shuffling to the closet to get his supplies. Slowly opening the door, he changed into long, thick robe and comfortable hiking shoes. To carry the supplies in, he grabbed a satchel charmed with undetectable extension. Lucius then grabbed his enchanted cane that held his wand. He spinned the cane using a small motion to get it in a comfortable position in his hands. Although he still had some essentials to pack downstairs and a little less than an hour before he had to leave, Lucius gave his wife a kiss good-bye, who was soundly asleep in bed. He headed down the stairs to grab the rest of his supplies. Lucius grabbed some empty vials and bottles to hold the supplies, a small lunch, and a lantern. Once his supplies were packed up and ready, he walked out to the front of the manor. Elaina was already there waiting for him, fiddling with the sleeves of her robe. “Ah. There you are. I was wondering when you were going to come. Here…,” she said as she handed him a small dagger. “For a situation when you don’t have your wand. I know that we do, but I like to keep other weapons handy.” Lucius took the dagger and placed it in the satchel. “Thanks, Elaina. Here’s to hoping that we don’t have to use it tonight.” The pair set out for the edge of the forest, a gentle breeze refreshing their spirits. As they walked through the pathway, the manor became smaller and smaller behind them. “Go to the forest. Pick the herbs. Find the stones. Then, we’ll be out of the forest,” Lucius told himself when they entered the tumble of trees. There wasn’t much sunlight when they entered, the only recesses of it peeking through the treetop openings. It was filled with noise. Squirrels chattered and birds chirped. Many other animals spoke to each other, running and jumping around the trees. “Now this feels familiar.” Elaina spooked Lucius out of his thoughts, speaking out to no one in particular. “I love it out here in the forest. It’s quiet and peaceful, as long as there isn’t anyone chasing after you. I’ve lived in society for a lot longer, but the woods feel like home, no matter if it's familiar or not. Oooh! Nettles!” Elaina stopped herself and knelt down on the ground. She picked a few handfuls of nettles she spotted. She bundled them up with a small ribbon and placed the herbs in Lucius’s bag. “That’s one thing off our list. Now let’s go find some more.” Elaina took the lead. Lucius followed behind her, lagging a bit. The girl took this adventure with a lot more enthusiasm than Lucius anticipated. Each time she spotted a specific animal or plant, she would point it out and tell him about the times she encountered it and the ‘funny’ parts that came along with her stories. With the objective to get out of the forest as quickly as he could, Lucius looked around for any plants and herbs that were useful in potion-making. They found aconite, alihotsy, daisies, dittany, fluxweed, knotgrass, mint, lavender, roses, lunablooms, and many other flora scattered around the forest floor. Their search for the ingredients went quite quick. After a few hours, all their bottles and vials were stuffed with their specimens. Lucius insisted that they stop and rest, so they found a nice patch of fluffy grass and ate their lunch in silence. By the time they finished eating, it was already afternoon and they still had to look for the opals. “Lucius, let’s make our way into the tree branches. That way we’ll have a better vantage point and be safer from anything walking.” Lucius looked up, the tall trees towering over him. The canopy was tens of feet away. “How far up there are we going to climb?” he asked her. “I’m not really fond of climbing, much less muscularly built for it.” Elaina chuckled lightly. “We’re not going that far, silly. Only up a few feet. That’s where the most comfortable branches are. They’re big enough to hold us and are quite spacious. One thing though: you’re a veela. Can’t you just fly up there?” A little embarrassed, he mumbled the reason. “My wings are too big and there are a lot of trees. I’d hit a branch by the time I take off.” Elaina got up from her spot and began to climb one of the low-hanging branches. “Don’t worry. I’ll help you up here,” she said, holding out a hand to Lucius. A bit scared of falling and of Elaina’s boundless optimism on him climbing that tree, he took her hand and climbed up together. Once they were high enough from the ground, they settled themselves into the tree branches, Elaina comfortably laying down while Lucius took a more ‘in the middle of the tree so I don’t fall’ position. “We have a few hours until nightfall,” Lucius observed as he looked up towards a break in the canopy. “We’ll just have to wait it out until then so we can search for those stones.”
I'm so so sorry for not posting in a while please forgive me. Anyways please enjoy this chapter my Lovelies.
“I’m heading out the door for a minute. I’ll be right back.” Hadrian stepped out into the hallway. When he closed the door, he heaved a giant sigh. He was plotting Ron’s death most of the day, trying to get rid of him as quickly as possible. It was hard to make and even harder to not tell the others. Hadrian got away from the rest of them so he can think alone without the guilty feeling of not telling them. Not telling Draco was burning a hole through him. “I must kill Ron tonight. He will not live to see another sunrise.” Finally alone, Hadrian closed his eyes and leaned against the wall, scheming away. “Hadrian?” He looked around when he heard his name. In front of him, a bright, fiery haired girl stood in his path. “Hello, Hadrian,” Ginny greeted. Hadrian frowned when he saw her face. Despise for abadonning Amelia filled his mind. He was already planning the death of one Weasley and he was too busy to plan hers. Getting closer to Hadrian, she tried to appear as delicate and graceful as possible. “I was looking for you.” Hadrian thought that was suspicious. Ginny never went looking for him as Harry Potter, and they ‘barely knew each other’ now that he was Hadrian. “You were?” he asked her. She smiled slyly, like a fox waiting in the brush. “Yeah, I was. In the common room when you were helping Violet move out, I saw how you faced the others in the room. How you demanded respect and drew power from all around you. I like guys like that.” Hadrian was disgusted. He already had Draco as a mate, and if he found out, he would go ballistic. “Not interested.” He tried to walk away, but Ginny was faster and blocked his path again. “But, Hadrian, give this some thought. We are both strong in ways that rival many. You and me, we can find our destiny together.” “Didn’t you just have a child with Dean Thomas? A child that my mother found?” Hadrian tried to remind her. Ginny simply scoffed. “Well, yes. But Dean was just a one night fling. I never actually expected for him to fill my womb with a child.” She sashayed closer to Hadrian, closing the gap between them. Hadrian looked away, but Ginny forced him to look at her, their eyes burning with a different goal. “Ginny, even if you were done with Dean, aren’t you in love with Harry Potter? Rumors have spread that you two have quite a history. That curtain of his history is certainly still open.” She shook her head, her fiery red locks blinding Hadrian. “Curtain closed. Harry is dead. Sure, I was broken when I heard the news, but when I saw you, I was whole again. I felt that we belonged together. Now, it is time for you to feel that too.” Hadrian realized that he was now pinned against the wall, Ginny entrapping him. She was so close now that Hadrian could smell her sickeningly sweet scent. “Hadrian…” Ginny whispered. With her free hand, she placed it on Hadrian’s chest, feeling his heart throb out of control. She leaned in closer, a breath away from his lips. “No.” Hadrian pushed her away. She reached for him again and Hadrian shoved her away. Hadrian couldn’t believe it. “She doesn’t get the hint that I’m not interested.” He just stared at her, wanting this to end. “When are you going to get it through that thick head of yours that I’m not interested?! Which part of the word ‘no’ did you not understand? I am not your soulmate and I never was.” Ginny stepped back in confusion. Hadrian was mad at her just for trying to win his heart? “But, Hadrian, give me a chance. If you’d like, I can prove to you that we belong with one another,” she tried again, keeping her anger down in the depths. Hadrian shook his head and regained his composure. “No. Don’t prove anything. I want nothing to do with you. Now, I have one request for you: stay out of my business and out of my way. Your brother already has something coming for him tonight. I will see to it that he gets the full force of my wrath. And soon, it will be your turn. Don’t press your luck any further by messing with me, Ginny, or you might end up with a fate worse than death.” Hadrian made his eyes flash for emphasis. Ginny was now terrified by Hadrian. She unconsciously backed away from the Riddle boy and ran out of the corridor. When Hadrian could no longer hear her footsteps, he relaxed. As soon as he turned around, Draco was standing in the doorway. His face gleaned with sadness and disappointment. “I heard everything...Are you really going after Ron tonight?” Hadrian nodded, not wanting to hide anything anymore. Draco fumed at Hadrian who did not even try to say anything to him. Draco could not look at him in the eyes. “So, you are keeping secrets from me? I thought we told each other everything.” Hadrian could not lie to his mate anymore and decided to tell him the truth. “I’m sorry, Draco. I really wanted to tell you. It was tearing me apart that I couldn’t. And then you found out on your own…” Draco couldn’t bear his excuses. “Save it, Hadrian. I thought we were mates. I’m supposed to protect you. It’s one promise that I intend to uphold. I can’t do it with you sneaking behind my back. What would my role be then? Draco Malfoy: the guy who’s always left in the dark?” Hadrian did not want his mate to feel like that. “I never wanted you to be angry. I was trying to get my point across to Ginny who was flirting with me. Please don’t be angry with me about that.” “I’m not angry about that. In fact, I’m glad that you resisted her. But, I just don’t get why you had to hide your plans from me. We’re a team, you know,” Draco reminded him. “I had to. The plans to take down Ron are too important. If anyone else were to find out, it could damage our cover. Dumbledore and the Order would find out if he decided to drag the information out of you.” Draco did not know what to say. His mate had cared about his own wellbeing. “Thank you, Hades. That's very sweet of you. Now that I know of the plan, let me help you. You don’t know if you are going to need backup,” Draco offered. Hadrian told him no. “If any of you were to help me, it would compromise your safety. This is something I need to do on my own.” Despite Hadrian’s noble efforts, Draco’s trust in him decreased. “How can I trust you with your plan if you can’t even trust me with it?” Draco asked him. Hadrian did not know how to answer that. “You don’t. Just trust that I can handle myself. Like you said, we’re mates. And mates have a way of knowing how the other feels.” The two were silent for what felt like days. Draco opened the door for the both of them and they headed back inside the Potions classroom. They parted and sat at opposite sides of the classroom. Hadrian covered his head with his arms, shielding himself from the world. Valorie noticed that her brother looked more down in the dumps than ever. She headed over to him and gave him a sisterly hug. “Hey, you ok?” she asked. “No.”
Tom pulled a chair next to the stressed male and sat down. “What happened?” Tom was itching to tell Severus about what Dumbledore was planning to do. “The 4th years weren’t paying attention. I started out by raising my voice, but they didn’t listen. So, I threw that knife into the wall and shattered the vials on the back shelf in the process.” “You were that mad? Let me guess. Your eyes turned blood red.” Severus looked at Tom. “Yes.” “After dinner, you’re going to drink the Calming Draught Narcissa gave you and relax. No arguments, Severus.” “Fine, but there was one student that caught my attention. I believe she is a Longbottom. She worked alone and succeeded in making today’s potion. I asked her to stop by the classroom after lunch.” Right when Severus said that, there was a small knock on the door. “You may enter.” Tom turned to the door to see a small girl walk in. The girl was around 4’9 and looked much like her supposed brother. She froze in fear once she saw Tom. “Y-you’re Tom Riddle, the Dark Lord.” Despite the girl’s fear of him, Tom could sense that she was much like him. “I won’t hurt you. What’s your name, young one?” She seemed to relax at his voice. “Violet Longbottom.” Tom looked at Severus. “When is Hadrian and the others coming?” “About…”  Just then, Hadrian, Draco, Remy, and Valorie walked in. “...now,” Severus finished. When the group of four walked in, they noticed a few things wrong with the room: shattered vials cluttered a shelf and the surrounding floor, a knife was stuck in the wall where the vials were, a person not in the family was present in the room, and Tom was still in his human form when said person was still in the room.  With her hands on her hips, Valorie surveyed the mess. “Whoa, who let a troll in here?” Severus turned his gaze to his daughter, not wanting to deal with her snarkiness. “Gryffindor happened, that’s what.” Valorie went to clean up the mess, leaving the other three to deal with the unwanted elephant in the room. “Mother. Who is this?” Hadrian said, motioning towards the small girl. Severus gestured for her to come over. “Come here, child.” Slowly, she walked past them, her magenta eyes downcast. “This is Violet Longbottom. In my last class, she was by far the best potion maker. She made a Wisdom Potion without any help and she modified it to make it better.” Everyone turned to the talented witch, who was shyly pulling her mushroom beanie over her eyes. This made her already slim appearance turn slimer. “I thought that adding the crimson crown toadstool would make the concoction more potent,” Violet said in a near whisper. Tom looked at the girl in astonishment. The only known person in the magical community that could successfully modify potions was Severus. This Violet must be a prodigy if she was able to do that. Draco was not convinced of the girl’s talent. He looked her over, evaluating every aspect he thought was weak. “You say that you can modify potions? You don’t look fit to even make one. How do we know that you are who you say you are, Violet Longbottom? After all, you Gryffindors are notorious for your lies.” Violet shrank further into the recesses of her gargantuan robes, right on the brink of tears. Hadrian noticed and scolded his mate. “Draco! You’re scaring her. Don’t pester her like that just because she is a Gryffindor. Besides, I can tell that she is telling the truth.” When Violet heard that, she peeked out like a turtle does from its shell. No one has ever defended her, ever. “You-you believe me? Really?” The room became relaxed with everyone at peace, even Draco who was bothering her moments ago. Violet shifted her robes back to how they were before and lifted the beanie that hooded her eyes. “I believe that you have a gift, Miss Longbottom. The reason that I called you here is that I would like to offer you a proposition,” Severus told her. The young lady shuffled a few steps away, suspicious of the offer. “What is it?” Severus smiled at her. “After what you displayed in class today, I was wondering if you wanted to be my assistant. You don’t have to make your choice right now, but you should know your knowledge surpasses many of the other students here. Under my tutelage, you can become one of the best potion masters in history.” Violet’s eyes sparked with curiosity. The offer was tempting. To be one of the best potion masters, maybe greater than Professor Snape. “I’ll do it, Professor. I want to become a great potion master like you.” Seveus was glad that she did not need much convincing. “Wonderful. You’ll start tomorrow. You will watch and help the students with their potions. Once classes are over, I can teach you anything you would like to know. By the time the year is over, you will have more knowledge about potions than any graduating student here.” Violet was so excited to get started. “Thank you, Professor. I won’t let you down.” “And Violet. Please, call me Severus when alone.” Violet couldn’t help herself and hugged her teacher, surprising him. “If it’s alright, may I stay in the Slytherin dorms? No one in the Gryffindor dorms really like me. They say I belong in Slytherin. They always make me sleep in the common room.” Severus’s eyes widened when he heard that. No one should be forced out of their dorms just because they don’t like that person. “Of course, Violet. Our dorms shall be your new home. I’ll have these four help you move your belongings to the Slytherin dorms.” Severus nodded to Hadrian, Valorie, Draco, and Remy. They followed Violet out of the room to help her move into her new dorm. Once the children were out of the room, Tom focused his attention back on his mate. “Now that they are out helping that Violet, I want to tell you something important.” Before Tom could explain what he saw, Amelia woke up from her nap and started crying. Severus rushed to Amelia so he could comfort her, leaving Tom on the lurch. “I can’t seem to get out one word.” Severus came back with Amelia cradled in his arms, who was starting to calm down. Severus held his hands out to his husband, urging him to hold her. Tom took Amelia, cushioning her with the crook of his arm. “Isn’t she adorable? Aren’t you adorable, Milly?” Severus cooed. Tom was very antsy, so he tried to press the issue further. “Yes Severus, she is adorable, but I need to tell you something very important.” Severus got as comfortable as he could, knowing that Tom did not dismiss cute things unless something serious was going on. “What happened, Tom? Did you overhear something from Dumbledore or his cronies?” Tom nodded, knowing that what he was about to tell his mate was not going to be easy. “After I had escorted the children to their class, I decided to go spy on Dumbledore. I thought that he would have the most plots right now since he is suspicious of what happened. When I snuck into his office, I found that he was talking with Kingsley Shacklebolt. They were talking about how they want to convince our children to join his side.” Severus’s eyes widened. “He-he wants our children...to join his...his side?!” He started to pace back and forth, hyperventilating at the thought. “This cannot be true. They won’t do it. But, not of their own free will. What-what if he tries to cast the Imperius Curse on them, and they actually do his bidding and we aren’t able to free them? What if he tries to harm them and use them as leverage? I will not let that happen. I have to try and change and change his mind. No, that might not work. I have to stop him, right here, right now!” Severus charged for the door, but Tom stopped him in his tracks. “Severus, no! I told you that you are in no condition to take on Dumbledore. Besides, you have no plan. You will not rush in. I won’t lose you or anyone else.” Severus backed down, knowing that Tom was right. He returned to his seat, a look of embarrassment across his face. “Sorry. I know that we are barely getting started, but I want to take Dumbledore down. He has hurt our family too much.” Tom used his free hand to grasp Severus’s chin. He leveled his mate’s eyes with his own, trying to convey his thoughts. “Look, we will stop Dumbledore. I will personally make sure that Dumbledore does not lay a finger on our children. We will be safe.” Severus smiled at him and pressed his forehead against Tom’s. “I’ll try not to freak out as much, since it seems to worry both you and me. Is there anything else that Dumbledore said?” Tom explained to him that the Weasley twins are actually Bellatrix’s children. By the time he was done, Severus was overloaded with shock. “We really...need to space out how much surprise can be given in one day. With how much surprise we had over the last month, it is...a lot.” They nodded at the same time. “So, how do you think we can convince the Weasley Wonder twins that they are actually Bellatrix’s children?” Tom asked. Severus thought of all the possible ways they can, but most of the plans would probably end in failure. “Well, if we were to tell them, they would probably not believe anything and prank us. However, if we were to let Hadrian and the others convince them to take an inheritance test, they might be more susceptible to the idea.” Tom thought about it. The Weasleys might actually go along with the plan if the children were to explain the situation to them. “It sounds like a great idea. See? I told you that you are still plenty of help when you stay back and make reasonable plans.” The two talked for a while, letting the seriousness roll off their shoulders.
Hermione was in her bedroom when a pain flared in her head and lower back. “What the…?”  When she looked into her mirror, she saw she had wolf ears and a tail. Then, an owl tapped on her window and she opened it. The owl gave her a letter from Griphook, telling her that she needed to come right away. “That’s weird they called me Ms. Lupin-Black’’. Hermione left at once. When she arrived, she was met by a female goblin named Stoneheart. “Miss Granger, I see that you have come into your inheritance. Would you like to take a test?” Hermione was in shock. How could this happen? She wasn’t even a pureblood. “I guess,” she said nervously. Stoneheart led her to a room. “Please drop some blood on the paper.” Hermione did as she was told. Words then appeared.
“Sirius! Come on! Don’t be like that. Get in the picture,”  Remus said, tugging on Sirius’ robes to get him in the photo. “Moony, you know that I don’t like getting my picture taken. It’s a waste of time. Do cows and pigs pose in front of the camera just to stare at how vain they are later? I’d rather stay out.” Bellatrix skipped over to Sirius to give him a small jab in his arm. “Stop being a letdown and get in the picture, cousin. It’s our last year at Hogwarts. We only have a couple more weeks until we leave the castle.” She turned around in huff, fluffing her hair and posing like a model. Narcissa and Remus laughed. “Sister, if you are going to help with the photo, convince Sirius to get in the picture,” Narcissa told Bellatrix while she hugged Lucius. Bellatrix groaned at her sibling. “Ugh. That’s exactly what I’m doing. It’s not like your being better help, Cissy. You are snuggling with your boyfriend.” Lucius hugged his girlfriend close as if the words would physically harm her. “Don’t talk to her like that,” Lucius scolded. “Besides, I know that deep down, you approve of us being together.” Bellatrix rolled her eyes, knowing that she would be ganged up two against one if she argued with her sister. Remus gave each of them a stern look because none of them seemed to take this seriously. Turning back to his mate, Remus pleaded to Sirius again. “Please, Padfoot, just come and take the picture. I can even stand next to you.” Sirius gave him a puzzled look. “You are already standing next to me. We can do that anytime.” “Well, now is a good of a time as any,” Remus declared. “Look, the reason that I want you in the picture is because I love you. Years from now, I want to look back at this picture knowing that you will stand by me through anything.” Sirius contemplated the thought in his head. After a few moments, he looked at Remus deep in his eyes. “You’re really thinking about our future? You see us together?” Remus nodded with a spark in his eyes. “Ok. I’ll do it. But only because you’ll be in the picture Moony,” Sirius said, winking at him. In anticipation, Remus and the others walked over to the middle of the courtyard. Bellatrix herded them into the camera’s view. “Alright? Now put on your best face. This picture should be the best one,” she trilled. Sirius grabbed Remus’s hand, squeezing it lightly. “I’ll always be by your side.”
The baby basilisk popped its head out of Hadrian’s pocket, looking around for any danger. “Is it over?” the serpent hissed. Hadrian gave the basilisk a warm smile. “Yes. You can relax now.” The basilisk slithered out of his pocket and hung loosely from his neck like a boa. Hadrian returned to look at the head with indifference. “Pitiful. You foolish, arrogant boy,” Hadrian remarked. He looked at his hand where Ron’s heart was. The heart stopped beating. Its glow dimmed until the last bit of light was snuffed out, like a mirage that has disappeared from view. Hadrian smiled at the still heart. He put his scythe down and summoned a box into his now free hand. It was a small black box gilded with gold. An elegant golden heart charm was set in the center of the lid. Hadrian carefully placed Ron’s heart in the box to make sure his mother’s dinner will not ruin. With the box in one hand and his scythe in the other, he shadow traveled out of the Chamber and into the common room. The place was empty, the only noise coming from the crackling fireplace that usually danced in the night. The young man headed toward his mother’s room and found his mother wrapping his father’s wings. The two looked up at their son to find him with his hands full of presents. “Hades, did you do it?” Severus asked his son. Tom didn’t know what they were talking about, so he looked at their faces for clues. He saw Hadrian and his scythe was covered in blood. “Hadrian….Did you kill someone?” Hadrian turned to his father and told him about his plan about killing Ron and how successful he was. “Sounds like you did an amazing job. I’m proud of you Hadrian,” his father beamed. Severus started to tear up. “I’m so proud of you too. I knew the training would pay off.” Severus and Tom gave their son a hug. When they broke away, Severus became interested in the presents. One of them smelled strongly of blood. “What did you bring?” Hadrian handed him the box. Severus opened it and found a heart. He took a sharp fingernail and sliced into the muscle, withdrawing blood. The vampire lapped it up like it was the most delectable treat in the world. “Thank you, Hades. This is the best present ever. Besides, who’s heart is this?” Hadrian knew that his mother would be happy to hear who the heart belonged to. “It’s Ron’s. I ripped his heart out before I cut off his head.” His mother took another taste, savoring the Weasley's boy’s blood. “Pure wizard blood. One of the sweetest of them all. Next to your father’s of course. I’m going to have a feast tonight. Oh, I almost forgot to ask. Who is your little friend that is dangling around your neck?” Hadrian unwrapped the baby basilisk from his shoulders and held her out to his parents. “I found her when I entered the center of the Chamber. She was hiding in her eggshells. I thought she looked lonely, so I took her with me and decided to keep her.” The basilisk looked at his parents and deemed them friendly. “Hi. It’s nice to meet you,” she hissed at them. “It’s nice to meet you too, little one,” Tom hissed back. The basilisk looked up at Hadrian with big eyes. “That man can speak my language too?” Hadrian pointed to his father. “That man right there is my father, Tom Riddle. Like the both of us, he can speak Parseltongue.” She looked back up at Tom and waved at Tom with her stubby tail. “Hi,” she said in a cute voice. Tom chuckled at her cuteness and Hadrian had wrapped her around his neck again. “I’m going to bed. Also, I have to give Draco his present.” Severus grabbed his son’s arm and pulled him back before he could rush out the door. “Wait. Let me clean the blood of your robes. You don’t want to head to class looking like a mess.” “I can do it myself, mother. Thank you for the offer, though. Besides, I don’t want to get rid of all the blood just yet. I have a plan in store for the Gryffindors tomorrow.” Hadrian stepped out of the room with his serpent friend and headed up to the dorms. Everyone was sound asleep in their beds. Everyone except Draco. Draco was sitting in his bed curled up like a cat, looking out an arm-sized window. He heard Hadrian walk in and sat up straight. His feelings from earlier reminded him that he was mad at his mate, so he turned away and curled back into a little ball. Hadrian walked over to Draco who still turned his back on him. Hadrian knew he had to make up big time for what he did, so he softly spoke his apology to Draco. “Draco, I’m sorry. I didn’t even think that you would take what I did that seriously.” Draco drew a heavy sigh. “Well, I did. I hope you are happy.” Silence filled the room. Hadrian decided to sit down on the side of Draco’s bed, trying to get a little closer. “Come on, Draco. This plan...was what I have been waiting for a long time. To take him out so we can finally be at peace. For the past three years, Ron was bullying you. I was hoping that you would be, I don’t know, happy that he is gone forever. Happy that I took him out, for you.” Draco slightly looked from the spot he was focusing on, and sighed “Ugh, why do you have to be so adorable? I try to stay mad at you, but I can’t. It’s not every day that your boyfriend kills someone for you in the middle of the night.” Draco buried himself in Hadrian’s arms. “I missed you, Hades,” Draco admitted to him. The two hugged for what seemed like an eternity, the night still forever and the moon to remain high in the sky. When they broke apart, Draco noticed Hadrian’s new scaly friend. “Who’s the little guy?” Draco held out his hand so the basilisk could slither onto it. “I found her in the Chamber of Secrets. That is where I led Ron so I could kill him. She was hiding in her eggshells. I was thinking that you should be the one to keep her company. Draco looked at his new familiar who was slithering happily in his arms. “It seems she likes you. What do you want to name her?” Hadrian asked him. “How about Bassi? Bassi, our baby basilisk.” Hadrian facepalmed his forehead. The name was ridiculous. A name such as Bassi for that cute little thing. Bassi, the one who will grow up to be the next fearsome resident in the Chamber of Secrets.``I like the name Bassi!” she hissed. Hadrian groaned at the thought. “Fine. Bassi it is then,” he sighed. Draco led Bassi to the edge of the bed, where she curled up in the blankets and fell asleep. “You must have quite a story to tell, Hadrian, but you must be exhausted. You can tell me in the morning. Right now, I think it’s time for bed. Draco let Hadrian sleep in his bed. They cuddled up together and drifted off to sleep, the burden of guilt lifted off their shoulders.
Remy heard the door open. She put down the photo and turned around. She saw her mother, tired yet triumphant. Now that they were alone, they could be the family they could not show. Remy ran to her mother and gave him a hug. “I was so worried that they would have been suspicious. First day back on the job, and an incident occurs. I thought they were going to pin the blame on you.” Remus stroked her hair. “I’m fine. Pup, it’s ok. I’m fine,” he said soothingly while brushing his hand through his daughter’s hair. “None of the professors saw me and Madam Pomfrey didn’t raise questions. She is close friends with Severus and Tom, so don’t worry.” Remy sighed in relief. “Ok. Good. So, what did you want to talk about mother? When you told me to meet you here, you seemed worried. Did someone find us out?” Remus held out his hand to stop her. “No, nothing of the sort. I want to talk with you and see how you are doing, but I need to tell you something first. Do you recall last month?” Remy looked back at her that time. A lot happened during those days. “I think you need to be more specific, mother. Many things occurred last month. I could list them all if you’d like.” He chuckled at her intelligence. “I’m sure you could, but not the moment I am referring to. Do you remember the day you blacked out and woke up in the middle of the woods?” Unconsciously, her ears and tail sprouted out as if they knew what he was talking about more than her. “Wh-wh-what about that time?” Remus saw his daughter’s unease. “There is something that you need to know. As you have already seen, you are part wolf. However, it seems that you have also inherited my werewolf side. I told you about how I could not control the werewolf inside of me. You even saw it firsthand when you met your father. Last month on the night of the full moon, it seems that you could not control the wolf either.” Remy gasped. It now made sense. That night, she felt powerful, strong, free; a euphoric feeling that she never felt in her life. She could not recall how or why, but it seems that she could not recall it at all. Fearing that she did something she regretted, she mustered her courage to ask her mother. “Did I hurt anyone? Did I hurt you?” “No, Pup. No. You did nothing wrong. You were very lucky that night. However, you might not be so lucky next time. The werewolf inside will only get stronger. There is a way to control it. But, you need to want to learn it.” Remy was determined to learn. Anything to keep her and her friends safe. “I want to learn to control it. More than anything,” she spoke. Remus kept his expression grim. “We shall see. You may be willing to take the risk, willing to learn to control the wolf, but the wolf may not. I dismissed the Gryffindors early since Hadrian attacked one of them, and your friends are still in the classroom, probably bored mad by now. We have time and no one to bother us. Lay down on my bed and relax.” Remy walked over to the bed sitting in the corner in the room. She climbed on the bed, resting her head on the plush pillows. Remus sat at the bedside and brushed the hair from his daughter’s face. “Ok. This is what I’m going to do: I am going to send you on a vision quest to see if we can tame your wolf side.” Remy wasn’t scared. She read how they worked during her time in Divination class, but she thought it was a little odd. Remy lifted her head to look at her mother clearly. “A vision quest? I thought that was only used to help a person seek answers,” she questioned him. He nodded. “It is to help you seek the answer of if you will be able to control the wolf. Now, I need you to relax. If you are going to go on a vision quest, your mind needs to be calm.” Remy closed her eyes and took a deep breath. When Remy began to feel much more relaxed, Remus began the spell. “Horoma Viventem.” Remus chanted slowly and traced the spell around his daughter.
With a little encouragement from ThePhoenixandTheDragon I'll try to post as much as I can even when I don't feel like it.
“You found him after all these years.” Severus looked up at Lucius and Narcissa and gave a small smile. “Yes we did.” Hadrian then pulled away from the hug that he had trapped Draco in.  Both of the teens had pulled their wings back in. Draco, being dominant pulled the smaller boy into his chest before picking him up and walking to the couch sitting down with Hadrian in his lap. Their parents just cooed at the cute scene before them causing both boys' faces to go blood red.  “Could you guys not? It’s embarrassing as is to have everyone stare at us.” Hadrian said, his face still blood red.  All the adults laughed as Hadrian hid his face in Draco’s chest.  “Why don’t you two go to Draco’s room while us adults can catch up on the events.”  Lucius told the boys. Draco got up with Hadrian in his arms and carried him to his room, placing him on the bed and closing the door. “So what happened to you?” Draco said, sitting next to his mate.  Hadrian made a bitter face as if he had eaten a spoonful of salt. “ I was…Harry Potter.” Hadrian looked down expecting his mate to yell at him. Instead of yelling at the smaller boy, Draco just took his head and placed it in his lap. “I don’t care who you were  before as long as you’re here now is all that matters.” Draco smiled at the smaller boy. Hadrian was in shock but he hid it well. Draco couldn’t help himself so he picked up Hadrian’s head and kissed him.  Hadrian was hesitant at first but soon started to kiss Draco back. Both boys didn’t notice that figure approaching them till they heard the snap of a camera. The boys quickly pull away to see Severus holding a camera. “Mother!” Hadrian whined. “Hadrian” his mother mocked his son’s whining voice. “Really Severus?” was all Draco said to his mate’s mother. “Yes.” “Mother you better not show anyone.” Hadrian gave his mother a look that only his father could give.  “Hmm how about no!” Severus darted out of the room to the other adults smiling like a madman.
Walking up to the Gryffindor common room was so annoying for Valorie. The staircases kept changing constantly, even when they had just made a decision. She even tripped on a staircase with a missing stair, nearly getting her leg stuck in the crevice. Most students who passed her gave her questioning looks, so she returned it with a disgusted one. When the group had finally made it to the entrance, Valorie looked like she was a bomb ready to blow. “Why do the staircases change?” she whined. “It is so annoying. This is why I like the dungeons better. No staircases that bug you with their wishy-washy decisions on where to go.” She stomped her way up the last few stairs, emphasizing her hatred for the stairs. Arriving at the entrance, they were stopped by the portrait of the fat lady who guarded the door. “Hello, not-Gryffindor,” she greeted Violet in a revulsive manner. “Have you forgotten something again? Honestly, you act like the exact opposite of a Gryffindor. I normally do not question the Sorting Hat’s choices, but you certainly are not giving him or yourself any credit.” Hadrian had enough of the bullying. He stepped in front of Violet, shielding her from the painting. He concentrated on what he wanted in front of him and conjured his scythe into his hand. Raising it to the fat lady, he threatened her. “Go ahead and say something else. I dare you.” Hadrian’s eyes glowed blood red when he said that. The fat lady became frightened from the boy. “W-who are you?” Hadrian smirked at the lady, glad that she does not recognize him as Harry Potter. “Does the last name ‘Riddle’ ring a bell?” he snapped. The fat lady stumbled back in realization: she was looking at the son of Tom Riddle. “No... it can’t be…” she whispered. “Oh, but it can be and it is (Steven Universe anyone? No just me?). You better open up, or I’ll cut your face off in half a second.” The portrait complied and opened the door without asking for the password, fearing that she might get shredded by the crazed boy. Being the gentleman that he is, Hadrian let Violet and the others through the door. He followed at the rear, his eyes still glowing and his hand tightly gripped around the scythe. As they entered the room, all the Gryffindors had their eyes on the group, for they never had Slytherins enter their common room before. Hadrian stepped up to the front with Violet, who shrunk down into her robes from the unwanted attention. “Go grab your stuff. I'll keep an eye on the room,” he told her. She nodded meekly and sprinted up to her dorm, eager to get out of there. The room was silent for a few moments, speechless. Ron had noticed that Hadrian and the others had come into the room and slunk back, trying to hide from their gaze. Hadrian’s gaze fell on Neville Longbottom. His eyes still glowing, Hadrian approached the cowardly boy. “Well, well isn’t in Neville Longbottom. It’s such a shame that your sweet little sister is tormented by you.” Hadrian placed his scythe blade close to the frightened boy's face. “H-hey back off.” Hadrian turned his attention to Dean Thomas who was trying to defend the older boy. “How did you even get in here?” Hadrian started to smile psychotically at the Gryffindors. “Isn’t it Dean Thomas, father to Ginny’s abandoned child who my mother found, and my head of house Severus Snape told me to come here and help Violet Longbottom collect her items from this hideous room you call a dorm.” No one said anything to counteract Hadrian’s words, for they did not want to be targeted or struck down on the spot. After a few minutes, Violet came downstairs with her trunk full of her belongings. The Gryffindor looked at Violet heading towards the Slytherins. No Gryffindor has ever willingly left their house for another. “I always knew you were trouble, Violet Longbottom! Now, you can finally stop tarnishing the Gryffindor name and head with the Slytherins to where you really belong!” Lavender yelled after her. Violet winced at the insult. Hadrian threw his scythe towards Lavender and hit the wall behind her. She shrieked in terror from her near murder. “Do you mind saying that again?” Hadrian asked her threateningly. He called his weapon back to him and it neatly flung out of the wall and into his hand. Draco circled around the room, sneering at the Gryffindors. “Know that this is only the beginning, Gryffindor scum. Your punishment will come at another time.” Hadrian, Draco and the others left the room. When the door closed, Violet spoke. “I can’t believe this is happening. I’m free from my brother, free from Gryffindor.” Valorie walked up to her and gave her a pat on the back. “Well, believe it. You don’t have to deal with those obnoxious try-hards anymore. You’re with us now. I’m Valorie Riddle, by the way.” Violet smiled at the Valorie. “Nice to meet you, Valorie,” she said in a soft voice. “I don’t think that we have introduced ourselves. Of course, I’m Valorie. The boy with the scythe is my brother, Hadrian. The blonde ninny over there is his mate, Draco. And here is my mate, Remy,” she said as she pulled Remy into her embrace. “It’s nice to meet you all,” Violet shyly said. Draco fumed that Valorie was still insulting him.“Hey!” he yelled. “I am not a ninny! Take that back right now!” Valorie hung her head and sighed. “You’re right. You’re not a ninny. More like a dumbface,” she smirked. Hadrian was not in the mood to deal with the two of them arguing, so he interfered. “Will you two knock it off?!” The two stop arguing after they saw how Hadrian looked. His eyes were still glowing bright red, a few black feathers swirled around his back not fully forming his wings, and he growled so loud that it echoed in the hallway. Violet didn’t notice this earlier, so she backed away and hid behind Remy and Valorie. “Is he usually like this?” she said fearfully. Valorie shook her head. “No, this does not happen often. Just only when he gets angry. He’s part veela, so that also adds to the factor that he gets angered easily. We just let him phase it out.” After a few moments, Hadrian returned to normal. “Sorry about that. I don’t like it when people are mean to each other.” Violet smiled. She knew that this group was going to be great friends. The group of four and Violet had to split up because of their different classes. The classes went by fairly slow, making Valorie want to ditch and spy on Dumbledore. As much as she liked learning magic, it was a painfully slow process, especially when the teachers were explaining it in a round-about way. By the time their last class was over, Valorie had darted out the door, glad to be out and away from boredom. “Freeeeeedom!” she screamed. “We are done. Hopefully, tomorrow’s classes will be better because today gave it a bad first impression. Hey, where did the other go?” A few seconds later, Hadrian, Remy, and Draco came out, clumped together like sardines in the crowd. Valorie waved them over, the others walking at a turtle-slow pace. “Slowpokes! Seriously, can you walk any slower?” Remy gave her a light dig in the arm for leaving fast. “Well, with you speeding out the door like it is the end of the world, of course we appear slower to you. Don’t leave without us again, especially me.” Valorie knew she had to make up for it, so she lightly kissed her mate all over her forehead. “Am I forgiven, Rem?” Remy brushed the piece of hair that had fallen in her face, using that as a cover-up to hide her blush. “You are now,” she concluded. Valorie and the others headed to the Potions Room to see her parents. By the time they arrived, Severus and Violet were whipping up potions together. “Hello, everyone,” Severus said to them when they entered. “Violet is showing me how she makes Wolfsbane Potion.” Violet was still stirring the pot, concentrated so much that she did not hear her new friends arrive. “Then, I add pulverized giant moonwort. And then infuse it with the essence of a maitake mushroom….Oh, hey everyone! How was class?” Valorie plopped down on the chair, delighted to relax. “It was so boring!” she complained. “Seriously, I thought class was going to be more action-packed and hands-on learning. Today was mostly reading about it. I wanted to run out of there!” A familiar voice called out to her, trying to comfort her. “Don’t worry, my daughter. It will get better. It always starts out this slow.” Tom morphed into his human form, the last shimmers of his snake form dissipating away. He walked over to give his children and gave them each a hug. “I know you may think that magic classes are supposed to be fun and exciting, but you need to learn the bookwork to be able to understand the scenarios.” Valorie sprawled out even more. “Yeah, yeah, but how can I learn when they are boring me to death?” Tom couldn't argue with that one. Most of the teachers there were boring. “Just, try to learn as much as you can, ok?” he imparted to her. She just waved as if it were nothing and resumed relaxing. Valorie looked around. Her mother had passed Amelia to their father. Remy and Draco were watching Violet make her potion. Hadrian was sitting alone, staring into space. “He’s probably daydreaming about Blondie,” she thought to herself. After closing her eyes for a few minutes, she heard Hadrian leave. “I’m heading out the door for a minute,” he told them. “I’ll be right back.”
