Eventually Harry felt as if he was the correct temperature again. He could put his coat on. No one else came in to use the toilet.
“Sweat,” Malfoy said, and then his cheeks went pink. He darted a guilty glance at Harry, then looked away. Wetting his lips, he closed his eyes. His brow knit as he began to speak again. “Grease—from the pub, lager. Petrol, from the—automobiles. Leaves. Autumnal decay.”
“What if Moaning Myrtle was the life of the party, before she died?” Ron asked. “Where else can you really be alone, anyhow?”
Harry drew further back, trying not to let his lip curl. The person before him didn’t deserve his disdain, not now. “You tried to be an Auror so I would
Kavika’s dark eyes were already so large, but they could grow bigger when she looked sympathetic, as she did now. “What were you going to say?”
“Yes,” Draco said, somewhat hesitantly.  “But it’s not just that it’s illegal, Harry.  It’s—disrespectful.”
“I want to fuck you on your hands and knees,” Draco said. “I want to see the cunt I’m fucking while I fuck it.”
“We knew you would be sceptical,” said Parkinson, “so tonight we’ve prepared a demonstration. Rodolphus?”
“Maybe,” Harry said.  “But you don’t disappoint me.  Remember that, when you grow up.  You far surpass every expectation I ever had of you.”
“Right,” Draco said.  “Only—if a ten-year-old Harry Potter was seen going through his desk, it might . . . provoke inquiry.”
“I wasn’t showing off. This is my natural state.” Malfoy must have looked back up to gauge his surroundings, because the view in the IC:WUT/UC showed two of the Aurors putting the remaining NDEs in Body-Binds and a third Auror checking the room for any other hidden dangers. Ron, who had just finished collecting the wand of an unconscious witch, looked around, and, seeing Malfoy, came closer in the IC:WUT/UC view.
“This drink? Of course.” Tipping it back, Malfoy poured the entire misty concoction down his throat, then made a face. “Ugh. That was vile.” He handed the empty glass back to Parkinson, whose amusement had disappeared entirely.
“It’s not okay!”  Draco flapped some more.  “What would Mother say?  And you want to kiss me!”  Abruptly, he deflated.  “Oh, what’s the point.  Mother’s dead anyway; you said she was.  Rohit’s probably dead too, considering my luck.  And you’re—well.  Well, you’re not dead, and you like me.  So—whatever.  We can shag, if you like.”
“I understand,” said Harry. “I just mean—what if your way isn’t the only way? What if his way could work? You never know; he could surprise you. You never know what people are capable of.”
“Harry?” Immediately looking alarmed, Dudley looked over his shoulder into the flat, then back at Harry.  “Is everything all right?”
Harry was a month into the new year and no clearer on answers. At the start of the new term, he had done the Boggart exercise with the Level Ones, just as he did every year. Many of the trainees’ Boggarts had been some form of Reveal, which at this point was understandable. Reveal as Hermione had always proposed it was a gradual, years’ long process, but under the current Fudge administration, Reveal was looking more and more like a looming threat. Without a Deal, Reveal would happen suddenly, without warning, endangering the non-magical and non-magical-born people it sought to liberate from the secrecy of the Statute.
Harry could not believe what he was hearing, except he could. Of course, he could. This explained exactly why the Ministry had become what it had, so many of them neo-purist isolationists skirting the edge of blood supremacy. To think Harry had been worried about Bennet, who—while insulting towards non-mags—ostensibly had their better interests at heart. “You want Malfoy to be an Auror so he’ll support a purist agenda,” Harry said, just to be sure.
Harry wasn’t sure what to say, since he didn’t really cry that often in general.  He’d barely even cried when Dumbledore died, but then again, he hadn’t got much of a chance to.  “Probably,” Harry said belatedly, because Draco made it seem as though this might convince him to be happy staying here.  “I’d . . . be sad I never . . .”  Harry swallowed.  “I never told you how much you meant to me.”
“I want to make sure you’re okay,” Harry said.  “And you said you’d help me look at more of those memories in the Pensieve.”
“Sorry,” Harry whispered, then applied the rest of the salve.  “Can I . . . ?” he began.  “I want to bandage you.”
Malfoy just kept looking at it, not saying anything else.  “Okay,” Harry said slowly.  “Are we going to do it?”
“Does that kind of tree live a long time?” Malfoy tilted his head. “Oh, wait, you don’t know, do you, because what kind of tree is it? A Timothy Tree isn’t a species of tree, Potter, colloquially or magically or even non-magically scientifically. I checked.”
After several tries, Harry got it.  Then they did a spell to pour more cocoa, turn on the sink, make the trivet float, and stop the other spells.  Mister Malfoy had to take out his wand to show Harry how to make the chair dance, and Harry tried it himself on the other chair.  After twenty minutes both the chairs were dancing, the curtains were floating, and the hot chocolate was pouring itself into itself over and over.  Harry pointed at the table with the wand, shouting, “
“Excellent,” said Greengrass. “Go on and dance with him, if you’re so interested, Potter. Smear your name with his.”
“Stop it!”  Pushing aside Harry’s hand, Draco grabbed the ledger out of Harry’s lap, slammed it closed, then threw it at the hearth.
“Well.  It better not taste gross.”  Then without further ceremony, Draco tipped his head back and started drinking.  “It’s not that bad,” he added, after a long draught.
“Yes.  I know about a lot of things, Harry.”  Draco checked Harry’s expression, as though to make sure Harry believed him, then he looked back into the fire.  “Have I told you about my dance instructor?  Father hexed her.”
“You have it?” When Malfoy nodded, Harry said, “Now think about that moment. Allow it to wash over you.”
“Oh, do you mean Travers?” Harry asked. “That wasn’t destruction of property; that was blood supremacist bigotry. Glad I’m here to clean this up for you.”
Malfoy’s lips parted slightly, mouth hanging open as he watched the phials reorder themselves and settle back on the racks, now in order by colour.  When the phials went still, Malfoy’s mouth snapped shut.  Snatching the bottle in Harry’s hand, he strode away.
“You’ve asked more of me before,” Harry pointed out, then wished he hadn’t. Malfoy looked distinctly uncomfortable, as though he would rather forget any sort of embarrassing confession he had ever made. Perhaps he just didn’t like to talk about it, but perhaps, with the change of his Boggart, he was finally learning to grow beyond it. “Anyway,” Harry added, in a bit of a rush to change the subject, “I never asked for the coffees or Notice Me Nots or sandwiches, but you do them anyway. Let me do this for you.”
Sometimes Harry had to take a breath, just looking at him.  Harry still thought it unfair that Malfoy had been fit in school and that he’d somehow managed to become so again.  There should be more wrong with him.  He’d served the Dark Lord, after all.
Harry had found it odd. Malfoy wasn’t available to witches. Fleur hadn’t been there to talk about Malfoy being well-made.
There shouldn’t be a world in which Fudge was a powerful person—never, in the first place, but especially after what Fudge had done. How did anyone get to lie, and cheat, and pretend that massacre and military coup and the rise of a murderous psychopathic demagogue were not even happening—and then still go on? With his money and his power and his position on the fucking Board of Regents? How could anyone so ignorant, so petty, so small-minded ever rise to a position of such power?
They each put down cards, but neither of them was snap cards so they kept going.  When Draco played a snap card he said, “You would like a wife in the future, I suppose.”  Possibly he was asking to be distracting, since if there was a double-snap you could say “Snap,” and when the cards exploded, you got to keep them.
A suspect had given it to Harry two days ago, before her illegal faeries had burst out of a cupboard and Harry had arrested her.  In spite of the faeries, Harry had thought nothing of the tea, but he’d felt strange since that evening.  Over the past day, he’d developed a weird cough and random chills, and Harry had nothing better to do than pursue the tea lead to uncover possible further wrongdoing.
Kavika let the silence hold, a waiting thing that prowled about the room as Harry chased his thoughts, but then seemed at last to turn a circle on the floor between them and settle down to sleep. As if sensing the fact that Harry had mentally repeated their argument about it several times and had at last accepted once more the fact that he was allowed, indeed, to be anxious, Kavika said, “Bennet really worries you?”
“So are we talking or not talking?” Teddy asked. “See, I’m sort of thinking about picking up my guitar, but given the past experience, I might have to put it down again. Don’t get me wrong; I hear the Combat class is brutal. Guitar-lifting will probably help my build muscle mass.”
“Because I haven’t got to fly in a long time,” Draco said in this perfectly friendly, reasonable voice.  “You remind me of the times we were in school, and we flew so often then.  I’ve realized I miss it.”
The restrictions were the reason illegal potions trade was booming.  Potions could be brewed with little to no magic, and their effects could be quite magical indeed.  Thus, in order to wield the power to which they had once been accustomed, some of those placed under magic restriction turned to brewing.  Draco Malfoy had got ten years of restrictions.  He still had six years to go.
“I know it looks like a dream,” Dumbledore said sadly, “but just because you dream it often doesn’t mean it won’t come true.”
“I’ve just said, haven’t I? Maybe he doesn’t care if I’m qualified. Maybe the job he wants me to do isn’t something you need to be qualified for.”
Though Harry had bundled up for his morning flying, the October morning was not as chilly as he had expected. When he finally landed, he’d broken a sweat, and it didn’t help that the halls of Bickford-Buckley were magically heated. By the time he reached south end, he’d Banished his hat, coat, scarf, shirt, even socks and trainers. He needed to be able to move for his next class, so he transfigured his jeans, leaving him only in tracksuit bottoms, vest, and silver locket—the one Ron and Hermione had given him after he had quit the Aurors.
Draco was lying.  Harry knew Draco was lying, but Harry couldn’t figure out why he would—particularly after he’d just told him a truth he’d been hiding half his life, apparently.  Then again, Draco had said he hadn’t wanted to kiss him directly after he’d kissed him, during that incident with the siren tongue powder.
“That makes no sense. Besides, you still owe me a knit scarf.” When Malfoy looked at him in confusion, Harry explained, “Last year. When we first spoke about removing your Mark.”
“No.  The spell changes form according to who you are or what’s most important to you at the time.  Mine hasn’t always been a fox.”
Harry swallowed hard, and with that motion felt as though sudden tension sluiced out of him, leaving relief in its wake. “Oh, thank Merlin.”
Draco gave him a small but definite smile.  “The food is not going to disappear,” he said.  “You can chew.”
Malfoy looked open and so honest. “I don’t know where she goes anymore,” Malfoy went on. “We used to tell each other everything, and now . . . since Fudge. She’s angry, and it’s my fault. After what happened. And it happened to me! I was the one her father cast out.”
Magic flowed through Harry.  It poured out from Harry’s heart, filling up his fingertips as though they were sizzling.  The heat behind his eyes let him know what was happening.  He wasn’t angry.  He was going to cry.  “Draco,” he said, and even his voice sounded wet.
“I can forgive you. That’s not why I don’t love you.” Harry felt strangely calm. “You were my bully, Draco.”
“I usually do eight, but these old worn bones, you know.” Sibanyoni munched on a biscuit. “And how are you today?”
Adebayo made some reply, and Harry could feel him to his left, Teddy in a chair to his right, either side pressing in on him. Even if Harry asked Teddy to move his chair so Harry could get out, there was the pile of cloaks to be got through—the booth had a hook, but the number of cloaks had proven too much for it, and they had all fallen to the floor. People kept passing, so even if Harry got out past the cloaks, people would bump into him, and then he would be outside of the sound bubble; everything was too—
“Can you,” he said. “I need to—” Draco didn’t finish, but with the way he was twisting his head, Harry knew what Draco needed; he wanted to see. He wanted to look at their cocks together, touching, the way he’d been unable to take his eyes off of his hand on Harry’s cock for more than a few seconds.
“Not . . . exactly,” Draco said, hesitating.  His eyes were barely red at all.  He didn’t even look like he’d cried, but colour had come back into his face, and his chin trembled a little.
“Saving the world and puppies,” Harry said, but Malfoy just looked confused, and Harry realized Malfoy hadn’t remembered that conversation from the alley outside Mr. Mulpepper’s.  Of course he hadn’t; it hadn’t been a special conversation, and Harry only remembered it because—“I’m sorry anyway,” Harry said, just to make himself stop thinking.  “You should eat more.”
Harry looked down.  The picture in the frame was of Sirius, the picture that Harry had liked the best when he’d been eleven, the one in which Sirius was smiling rakishly, with Regulus behind him, unhappily waving his arms.  “You remember,” Harry said, voice catching.
—that he would stay in a cupboard, and Harry didn’t know how he had got to the bed, but he had definitely slept in it.
“Draco,” Harry said, catching Malfoy’s hand by the wrist.  He pulled Malfoy’s hand away.  “You know your mum loves you, don’t you?”
“Yeah. That’s exactly what I said.” Harry turned back to the wall, because breathing and listening and smelling had at last brought his heart back into the correct place, which wasn’t exactly helpful. He felt distant, now, instead of present, which he had learned wasn’t good for your
Finally it was down. “Harry,” Draco breathed. Then he reached inside, and Harry could feel the brush of Draco’s fingers—his beautiful fingers, brushing over Harry’s cock through the material of his briefs. Harry jerked a little against his hand. “Harry,” Draco said again, like a prayer. “Sweetheart.”
“Because they weren’t paying attention,” Malfoy said immediately. “Are you going to watch it, or are we going to talk about bravery and sexually explicit memory-viewing all morning?”
Usually the Pallas Arch, the lawn outside it, and Crowley Stott were illusioned to look like one of Cambridge’s hundreds of academic buildings; everyone who passed it mistook it for one college or another, and no one paid it any mind. Meanwhile, the buildings of the Academy within the Arch were inside a pocket, much like Number Twelve. If a non-magical person passed through the Arch, they simply found themselves on the other side of the Academy, never knowing they had skipped past acres of buildings, lawns, and lands.
Thinking he would talk to Teddy when Teddy was a little freer, Harry looked around for Ron, who appeared to be trapped in a conversation with Gardenia Greengrass. “He and I have very important business to discuss,” Harry told Greengrass, pulling Ron’s arm.
“Right.”  Malfoy’s shoulders went down a bit, and Harry hadn’t noticed that until then, they’d been tensed up.  But Malfoy didn’t look like he was relaxing—he looked defeated, and Harry didn’t think about why.
Imagining Malfoy’s foot tapping inside the big shoe, Harry’s smile deepened.  Oh God.  “Harry,” he said, taking pity on Malfoy’s poor foot.
“I know,” Harry said heavily. “It’s just—this is why I left the Aurors. Shite like this. You go to the people who are
“I’m . . .”  Harry swallowed again.  There seemed to be a lump in his throat.  “Are you really homeless?”
Harry had no doubt, as Draco’s hand was already cupping the front of Harry’s trousers, massaging slightly, and Draco's tongue was doing things in Harry’s mouth Harry had previously considered filthy.
Clumsily, Harry stood, heading for the door. He could think outside, with the coolness, the fresh air.
Draco looked even more like a girl, like this, the sharp features of his face softer somehow, more feminine.  Harry thought he was definitely sexist, and that Draco was the most beautiful person he’d ever seen.
“That’s just it, Harry.”  Draco was playing with the placemat again, his wand making the fringe at the edges dance.  “The only person who would reasonably be going through your desk is you.”
Harry had never snapped at a child before—not Teddy, certainly not Rose or Hugo.  Even when they frustrated him, he could always keep in mind that they were children and did not deserve harsh words.  But precisely because Draco was only a child, Harry felt strung tight inside, because Draco didn’t realize he was perfect.  Tailored Tinctures was perfect; his potions consulting was perfect; Draco Malfoy was one of the best men that Harry knew, and Draco didn’t even realize it.
Malfoy shook his head again. “There were too many people who wanted them. It was the only way to get any sort of crowd control—promise to show them some magic, answer their questions. A lot of them are still upset, frightened, but they know if they stay patient outside, then they can come into the classrooms—”
After that, Mister Malfoy stopped touching him, and Harry became intensely aware that they were kneeling on the floor of the loo.  “Sorry,” Harry said, for lack of anything better to say.
“I mean a different therapist.” Sibanyoni’s eyes twinkled, and he picked up his Coke again, finally taking another sip.
Harry took his hand away. If he went as slow and took as long as Draco seemed to want, Draco was going to end up chafed. “Accio lube,” Harry said, throwing his other hand out to catch the tube.
“Oh.”  Harry tried to think of something to make Draco feel better but couldn’t come up with anything.  “But he still loved you,” he thought to say at last.  “And your mum.”
Draco cast the first spell, then after a moment said, “Excellent, Harry,” Draco said, even though Harry hadn’t done anything yet.  “I’m just going to cast some spells—I won’t touch you.  Let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.”  Then Draco pointed his wand, saying an incantation.
For a moment, Harry was caught off guard, and then a sudden silence fell. The eyes of the other trainees turned to them—Harry could always feel it, the way he could always feel when the tension in the room became about him being Harry Potter instead of an instructor, the way everyone watched to see what he would do in a way they watched no one else. He remembered what Malfoy had said:
When Harry first instructed members of Dumbledore’s Army, and later for the brief time he had taught at Hogwarts, he used to tell students that casting a Patronus would eventually click. Most applicants accepted to the Academy were already fairly adept with the spell, but a few people sometimes struggled. Those trainees, Harry usually helped individually, until they found their way to make it click.
“Things like that,” Malfoy said, gaze swinging back to pin him, to bore straight through him like the round heads of hammers. “It’s not fair.”
Harry didn’t know.  Most former Death Eaters were in Azkaban, but a portion of them had been involved in crimes that could not be proven.  Only their association with Death Eaters was verifiable fact, and while that association was enough to implicate them, it was not enough to convict—especially not in the case of Draco Malfoy, for whom Harry had testified.  Death Eaters who weren’t sent to Azkaban were sentenced to restrictions on their magic, limited to a number of years that suited the crimes with which they could reasonably be associated.
For a moment, Travers looked longingly at the lights, but at last he shook his head. “No. I still haven’t yet. Like you, I need to prove myself.”
“I’ve longed to meet you for a while,” said Rune Photsi, and he was even better-looking up close. About Harry’s age, he was lean, with a thick set of shoulders on him. His mobile lips were pulled into a smile that lit his whole face, below bright dark eyes and messy dark hair. No wonder half the wizarding world was obsessed with him.
Shaking his head, Harry turned away, dismissing Malfoy with a hand. “I don’t care what your boggart is. I don’t care what your Patronus is; don’t disrupt my class again.”
that aspect of who I am. I didn’t choose it, so it didn’t feel like—it didn’t feel like that didn’t make him ‘the one.’”
“Potter,” Mister Malfoy said, sounding amused.  He was standing by a stool that was next to a table, so Harry went to sit on the stool.
“Potter, it’s okay,” Mister Malfoy said.  “It’s okay.  Shhh—you’re okay.”  Then Mister Malfoy was touching him, a warm hand on his shoulder, and Harry wasn’t sure why.  Maybe it was so he could stop shaking enough to drink the orange liquid in the phial, so Harry drank it.  The shaking stopped, and Harry could breathe again, the pressure on his lungs easing.  The hand stayed on him anyway, touching his hair, smoothing down against his neck, over his shoulder, then starting up in his hair again.  It felt very nice.
Harry put his leg over the broomstick, and Lee leaned in toward him urgently. “We’ve got to expose the corruption within the institution, Harry.”
, apparently, and that stung somehow, a weird sort of hurt in the leaden fog that had entered Harry’s chest.
Harry flicked his wand again, freezing Alby’s vocal cords.  “Listen to me carefully.  Do you know who that is?” Nodding over toward Draco, Harry went on, “You know what he can do with potions.  He engineered an indicator solution for Wood-Eye Lye, so I’ll know if you’ve taken it.  If you have, he, you, and I can wait together until it wears off and I can administer Veritaserum.  Or you could just answer my questions right now, and we can get this over with.”  Harry released Alby’s vocal cords.
Malfoy had been looking at the bottle, but his head jerked up at this. He still didn’t say anything, but his eyes had melted into a soft misty morning grey.
Draco just looked at him, and Harry didn’t understand why what he had said would make Draco look so sad.  “Harry.”  Draco stood, and then Harry couldn’t see.  His glasses were being pressed up against something soft and hard, and Draco’s hands were on his back.  Warmth surrounded Harry, but he sort of felt like he was suffocating too, and then he realized Draco was hugging him.  Draco murmured something, and Harry heard the word “brave.”
“Malfoy.” Harry kept his voice steady. “You literally moved back in line every time it was even close to your turn.”
“Hello, Hermione.” Harry finished the water he had cooled, then turned back to Teddy. “What about you?”
“Do it, Harry.”  Mister Malfoy laughed some more, and it was such a nice sound, nicer than anything Harry had ever heard before.  Way better than Take That.
“I don’t know if the wards will admit me on my own,” Draco said, “but it should recognize you, even if you’re not the right age.”
“Well, that’s bloody fine!” Tears sprang into Malfoy’s eyes, and Harry resisted going to him once again, still uncertain, still unsure. “That’s bloody fine for you!”
“What?  Oh.”  Hermione turned around to look at the picture.  “Yes, she’s becoming quite the little artist.”
“Well, I . . .” Harry ran his fingers over the crystals. “Er, Malfoy, he gave me . . . some remedies? And those have been helping.”
“Oh,” Draco said, looking as though hunger was an entirely new concept to him, but interesting nevertheless.  “I suppose—yes, I could eat.”
Harry stepped forward, reaching out for Draco’s waist, wrapping his arm around it, pulling Draco to him.  “Draco,” Harry whispered, his other hand on the nape of Draco’s neck so that he could pull Draco’s head into the crook of his own neck, so he could feel Draco’s forehead against the side of his throat.  Draco shuddered against him, and Harry slid the hand at Draco’s neck into his hair, pulling Draco closer with the arm around his waist, then stroking the small of Draco’s back.  Harry pulled back to kiss Draco’s forehead.
“I’ll have to, won’t I?  They can’t make friends on their own.  And Vince can barely read.  Who else is going to help them?”
The icebox lily cucumber sandwich, whatever that was, was sat down in front of Harry, and when he looked up from it, Malfoy’s silver eyes were on his. Then he turned away.
“Not a trick question,” Yin said, and the very real quality of their voice as well as the light trace of humour in it snapped Harry back into the present. “Maybe you can tell me about the dream. If you want, I can tell you about mine with Nearly Headless Nick—but you might have to get a few extra therapy sessions after hearing about it, sorry.”
Malfoy’s expression hardened up, like melted water instantly freezing over.  “It’s my life’s ambition.  Working in a shop.”
Harry’s heart rose into his throat. The blank space where it used to be hollowed into a cavern inside him.
“Obviously. I throw the best parties,” Malfoy said, then proceeded to adjust the noise around her, just in case it was too loud.
“He won’t follow you around any more like a lovesick puppy,” Hermione pointed out. “That’s something, isn’t it?”
“Malfoy,” Harry said again, feeling a bit exasperated, “it’s authorized. The Academy authorized it. You think I’m toting about illegal Dementors?”
“I remember.”  Draco’s fingers stroked Harry’s hair.  “I remember you, Harry.  I’m sorry I said you were perfect.  You’re just as fucked as I am, aren’t you?  The bright side is, you have me, and I’ll take care of you.  I’m very good at taking care of people, Harry.  You’ll see.”
Harry finished cleaning his glasses. “You know what I’m going to say.” He put his glasses back on, meeting Malfoy’s stare.
confused,” Draco said disdainfully.  “When do you even start to want me?  After that potion accident turned you into an eleven-year-old?”
Harry felt relieved when the song ended, and Malfoy abruptly dropped his arms, taking his hands away from Harry’s body.
This sounded wise, now that they had said it. Previously, Harry wouldn’t have supposed that thinking about leaving the Academy could have anything to do with Draco Malfoy.
“I—sometimes,” Harry said.  “Sometimes I don’t—it’s like I don’t know.  What I feel.  It’s like I can’t—I can’t feel anything.  But sometimes I do—feel things, and I can’t—I just can’t—it doesn’t come out.  I don’t know how to . . . make it come out.”
“Potter, you fool,” Malfoy muttered. “My body doesn’t know how to make a cell that doesn’t love you.”
Draco’s eyes slid over to him, then went back to the papers.  “An Auror is . . .”  Setting down the file, he picked up another one.  Harry put the one Draco had already looked at back in the box.  “Police,” Draco said abruptly, turning back to Harry.  “It’s like a Muggle policeman, except for wizards.  They find wizards and witches who are breaking the law, and they incarcerate them.”
Harry was making supper when Draco woke up at the age of thirty.  Harry heard a moan from the sitting-room and hurried in, trying not to look too anxious.  Draco had gone through ten iterations of waking a year older from unconsciousness without him there; he could handle it fine.
Harry looked at the potion again.  It almost seemed to shimmer in the light, like a pearly sort of cloud.  “Am I going to drink it?”
Fuck, Draco was backing him up against Luna’s painting, and a part of Harry felt like he’d not even been kissed at all.  He hadn’t got enough kissing; Draco had been
Kavika had come out of retirement to treat Harry, which was why her office was a room in her house. This might have felt awkward, except Kavika and Kingsley currently lived in the Minister residence, which was in London, so the place Harry went to visit them as friends was not the same as the place where he had therapy. Something would have to change when Kingsley stopped being Minister, but Harry hoped that wouldn’t be for a good long while. If the Deal happened, they would need him.
“You did.”  Draco took the papers, but he didn’t seem to care about them at all.  He set them on the floor and took Harry’s hands again.  “But you mustn’t—you mustn’t put yourself in danger.  Do you understand?”
“It’s got double wards in case there are accidents,” Harry explained. Opening the door, he walked into the room. “You should take off your robe.”
and the wizard wireless, with only a few resurgences of interest here and there. The last time Harry had seen reporters gathered here had been Draco Malfoy’s first day at Academy. Hopefully, whatever the reporters were here for, it had nothing to do with Malfoy’s Patronus. Or Malfoy in general. Or Harry.
“It feels so selfish.” Draco looked miserable, and Harry wanted to hold him again.  He wanted to kiss him again, and Draco had just told him he had a boyfriend.
“What if I put my mouth on it right now?” Harry said, then licked Draco’s lips. “What if I put it in my mouth, took the hairband off, and you just—came inside? Right inside my mouth.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes.  “Honestly, Potter, I was six.  Do you always bring up things I said when I was drunk?”  His cheeks went pink again.  “Don’t answer that.”  He tapped his wand on his thigh.  “Do you—do you think a Fiendfyre fighter
Malfoy brightened, as he always did with praise, his eyes gleaming just a bit, a smirk playing at the corner of his thin lips. “I know,” he said, and went back to his seat.
“I promised I’d protect you,” Harry said, feeling panic slowly clawing its way into his chest. He’d made a promise. He’d made a
As he disappeared, the tree itself rotted, leaves wilting, branches dwindling away into wet, limp things that folded into the trunk. The trunk itself went dark brown, sagging, then singed to black, shrivelling in on itself like something from within had made it into sludge to suck through a straw. Then the point that had been sucking disappeared with a pop, leaving nothing but a black, gaping maw in the ground. After a moment, even that filled, the dirt around the edges falling in to fill the space. Grass rushed like a crowd to fill it up, growing so fast that it looked like green paint putting the final touches on the last bit of a brown canvas.
“What do you mean, he’s good?” Harry asked, not distracted by the explosion.  The cards had already done that five times.
“All right, well.”  Dropping Harry’s hand, Draco sat up, moving away so that he could turn and face Harry.  “First of all—”  Draco squared his shoulders.  “First of all, I’ve always wanted you to touch me.  Always.  My whole life.  Both lives—the one from these past three weeks and the other one, ever since I was eleven.  Sometimes I wanted to make you angry enough to hit me, Potter.  Just so I could have you touch me.”
Another commotion filled the entrance, the sound of the heavy outside door, the swish of robes, the murmur as people began to comment on the new arrival. Harry’s head whipped around. There, just as beautiful, with his slim hips, bright eyes, and messy hair, stood Rune Photsi, and Harry’s heart jumped into his throat. Someone must have invited him. Had Malfoy known Rune would be here?
“From whom?” asked Harry, who wanted to hex anyone who even looked at Teddy in a way that was suspect, but generally refrained.
Rolling out of the hearth at Number Twelve, Harry tried to keep silent as he brushed the dust and soot off of his clothes and Draco’s nice leather satchel.  Coming here was dangerous; Cecil Vance might be long gone, but that didn’t mean he wouldn’t come back or that other bad people working with him wouldn’t try to rob old-Harry’s house.  Meanwhile, the fawn trotted out of the Floo looking perfectly clean.  Harry guessed being incorporeal had its perks.
Malfoy’s primary concentration was for the crowd, and this aside was the light, flippant tone he used when he either didn’t care or wanted to pretend he didn’t care, or maybe was annoyed.
“Thanks,” Malfoy said again. “‘Not expecting anything in return.’ That’s a load of bollocks. I said forever, didn’t I? Did you think I was exaggerating?”
“I bet you could be in magazines as well,” Harry said.  “I know what you look like when you’re older.”
The crisp October turned over into a soggy November. The only bright side of Fudge being Minister was that it left his seat on the Board of Regents for the Academy vacant. Since the seat could only be filled by a vote from a plurality of the alumni, however, and the vote took a while to organize, a new board member would likely not be appointed until the end of spring term.
Everything about it should have reminded Harry of Malfoy and his potions, but to Harry it seemed nothing like.  This place was cool and clinical, whereas—despite how distant Malfoy had grown—Tailored Tinctures always seemed warm, inviting, a cheery place where magical things happened.  Here, the mixing and stirring and sifting seemed somehow sinister, the white tile floor gleaming with harsh light, the high ceilings lined with sterile glass cabinets filled with potion after potion.  Equipment for brewing—cauldrons, Pensieves, ladles, beakers, spoons, were lined up along the counters.
Fortunately, Malfoy shone on all the portions of the course that dealt with theory or procedure. If assigned to write essays on a curse, or delineate the process by which an Auror would break one, Malfoy surpassed the rest of the class, which meant that so far he was doing well enough to be near the top.
“Yes, Malfoy, come in, sorry,” Harry said, turning back to Gareth. “It’s a flat white, with an extra shot, and then a small sprinkle of cinnamon.”
“I’m not going to say anything.” Kavika sat up again. “You ask these questions yourself. And then I drink coffee. It’s a very good little habit we have, don’t you think?”
Draco clung to the front of Harry’s robe.  “Does, um—” Draco licked his lips—“confronting criminals really get you that turned on?”
The image in the IC:WUT/UC moved along the corridor to a grand marble staircase, then swung left down another corridor, past a few doors and a large mirror along the hall, beyond which stood a set of ornate double-doors. Travers opened one of these, admitting them both to what seemed to be a library, with over a dozen people seated around a table. One of the figures rose upon their entrance, and as they walked toward Malfoy and Travers, Malfoy dropped a white marble on the floor, looking down at it so that the view on the IC:WUT/UC showed the full view of it, resting on an emerald rug.
Meanwhile, the Auror party was in Cambridge, at the Academy, in the Grand Foyer at Bickford-Buckley, where the ancient chandelier hung by its charmed chains overhead, and the walls hummed with soft music for those that wanted to dance. The party was smaller and more exclusive than the Ministry gala, restricted only to Aurors, former Aurors, those attached to the Academy, as well as the guests of all of these. Harry knew just about everyone, having served as an Auror for nine years before quitting—retiring, the force still called it. That was fine. Harry was still friends with a few of them, even if Robards and his crowd were absolute tossers.
“Maybe you should take someone with you after all,” Draco said abruptly, looking from the fox back up at Harry.  “Maybe you should take—aren’t there other Aurors?  You have to take care of me, after all.  Or—my father could go with you.  He’s very good at magic.  And with dark magic.  Perhaps we could—”
“No need to stand,” Malfoy said airily. “In fact, you’ll probably want to sit. I’m here about my marks.”
“All right,” Harry said softly. “Consider that Dirk Spragg wants to help people. And he thinks he’s better  doing what he does right now.”
“Fuck,” Harry said. “You’re so good. You’re so good. You’re so—goddamn—good—” And he thrust inside Draco’s mouth; he couldn’t help it, and Draco moaned for it, eager on the floor like some kind of—well, like some kind of eager whore. “I’m going to,” Harry warned. “I’m gonna—I’m gonna—”
Her question triggered memory, and Harry found himself blurting, “Malfoy brought me coffee.” Looking up to see her reaction, Harry saw an expression of sympathy, which was all wrong. “There were reporters,” Harry went on, rubbing the scar again, “at the Pallas Arch, and Teddy had to disguise himself from them. Then inside—Penelope wanted to commiserate again, about Malfoy, I mean, and then Spragg wanted to put his two Knuts in about Reveal, and Gareth wanted to tell me how terrible all the press is, and the coffee was just waiting there, on my desk. Malfoy didn’t say anything; I didn’t see him. He just left it.”
“Surely you’re not calling the Board of Regents Death Eaters.” In his hearth on the opposite wall in the Chamber of Fires, Bickford bristled. “The Auror Department is a time-honoured institution dedicated to the protection of witch and wizard culture, since the very foundation of—”
In answer, Draco went over to the shelves.  Harry considered concealing the bottom shelf that had some of Draco’s notebooks and the photo album.  Since Draco had made it clear he didn’t think much of the shop or the flat, finding out that it belonged to him would be another conversation, and Harry wasn’t sure his battered heart could take it.  In the end, however, he could not bring himself to so blatantly conceal the truth, even from a child.  Especially from a child.
Teddy looked out toward the dance floor, finding Malfoy dancing with the hot one. “I suppose he was always fit as well.”
“I didn’t say—”  His voice too loud, Harry cut himself off.  “I didn’t say I liked you better, just in a different way.”
Over the next six months, Malfoy’s flat became fuller and fuller with potions ingredients and brewing equipment, crowding out any other sort of comfortable furniture, except for a floral-print chair Malfoy had shoved into a corner and never seemed to sit on.  At first only the table tops appeared crowded, but gradually the spaces under the tables began to be filled with boxes, sacks, and stacks of jars.  Meanwhile the shelves around the perimeter of the sitting room were becoming stuffed with books, and all of these things seemed to be advancing faster than the amount of meat on Malfoy’s bones or the quality of Malfoy’s clothes.
“Mother says I need to try to be more gracious.  And Father thinks I’m too . . . disagreeable.  He says you have to be agreeable, so—so other people agree with you.”
“Because you didn’t sleep.” Harry heard his own voice rise and wasn’t even sure why.  “You stayed up all night working on some dumb potion to try and fix me!”
“Right,” Harry said.  “But by the time I understood that that meant that what I felt was—just me, you were already talking about your Death Eater lips and my horrible Gryffindor skin.”
“No, they don’t. Seven,” Harry added, turning away. He would need time to contact Ron, arrange the necessary people to be at the Department, and when they arrived, Harry didn’t want to run into anyone who might just be there during normal working hours.
Harry didn’t see Heloise, so he went to look at the photo album again, the one with Sirius Black in it.  The best photo of Sirius was one in which he was turning to smile rakishly at the camera, while the smaller boy Draco had said was Sirius’s brother waved his arms in the background.  The arm waving and something about the smile made it seem as though Sirius was about to do something devious.  The album also had Andromeda when she was young, but Harry wasn’t very fond of her, so he skipped over those to look at more pictures of Draco’s mum instead.
“There’s history,” Harry heard himself say. “Of course there’s history, but there’s important history, and then there’s . . . Draco Malfoy was nothing. In the scheme of things. He was wasn’t an enemy. He wasn’t strong enough, or important enough. He wasn’t a rival or a friend or a traitor or a murderer. He was just . . . he was—Dudley. He was Dudley, only thinner and more posh.”
“Sure,” Teddy said it coolly, but Teddy was always cool. He was the coolest. Sometimes he was too cool for Harry, and Harry didn’t know how to break through that barrier, how to get close, to touch him. He’d never talked to Kavika about it. Maybe he’d never realized it until now.
“Malfoy,” Harry said after the class, as the trainees were heading out of the room. “Stay here a moment.”
read the note, and Harry was surprised that the surname stung.  He’d been a child when he’d demanded Draco call him Harry.  Apparently, Draco hadn’t believed Harry could possibly feel the same way when he grew back up.
“Hm?” Draco said, hanging from his broom by one hand.  By then they were close enough to the ground so that when Draco let go, he dropped the remaining meter easily, landing on his feet.
“That wasn’t what I was thinking.  Draco,” Harry said, still not quite over the shock of it.  “You said, ‘Jesus’.”
Harry closed his eyes. He should occupy himself. He needed an occupation. Something to fill his brain. Something that wouldn’t allow him to think freely, but would force him to think
“No.” Malfoy shook his head. “Someone will see us. It puts the information at risk. I’m already taking a chance by being here with you just now, especially during examinations.”
“I remember the Ministry.” Spragg sneered. “Half under Imperius, half complicit, bending to the world of a Dark Lord.”
“I saw you with Vinicius,” Ron said. “I was going to come over, but then it looked like you were getting along.”
“Let me finish,” Harry said quietly, and Malfoy stopped immediately. “You were a part of a hate group that massacred a lot of people.”
“Did you ever do it?” Harry asked, not because he thought Draco was foolish, but because Draco was often saying bad things about himself, and Harry thought maybe this was perhaps another bad thing in disguise.
For the infraction of breaking Robards’ asinine policy against communicating with Death Eaters, Harry was desked for a month.  For the further infraction of threatening an innocent (“Innocent, my arse,” said Savage) shopkeeper, Harry was desked a second month.
Malfoy was crying again, but then he was coming closer, and Harry was sure Malfoy wanted to hit him.  He even thought Malfoy might have done it, because Malfoy’s hand sort of made a fist and then sort of—brushed against Harry’s chest, but the blow was so weak and pathetic Harry didn’t know what it was.  Then Malfoy just stood there, inches from him, crying, and Harry still didn’t know what to do.
“Yes, I think that would qualify as tyrannical.”  Draco’s voice was distant, as though he was thinking of something else, and when he spoke again the tone was abrupt.  “This book is quite heavy.  I’m not sure I want it on my lap this whole time.  Would you help, Harry?”
“There was a point where I thought I wasn’t going to have a family again.” Malfoy’s words came in a tumble. “To hear her say that—for her to call me that, her nephew—this whole night—it was just—it was a lot for me.”
Since last year, Malfoy hadn’t been terribly obvious about his feelings, and no one seemed to have guessed the reason for the shape his boggart took. Still, that didn’t mean that Malfoy had stopped wanting him. He had said he would love him forever, and Harry was getting more and more nervous about what the memory in the vial might contain.
But no. If Voldemort had bound a human to a Dark Mark, then killed the human, the life magic of the human could be channelled to reinforce the permanence of the Mark, but Harry didn’t see Voldemort doing that. The power created by death—the release of life magic—was strong enough to defy death. It had raised armies. It could even raise the dead; by some accounts, Inferii could be raised through human sacrifice. One could use human sacrifice to seal a ward or sigil, but to use it for Dark Marks would be inefficient, and Voldemort was someone who loved pageantry and ritual. Salazar had first sealed the Chamber of Secrets with human sacrifice; Voldemort wouldn’t waste it on a Death Mark.
“New leaf.” Doctor Yin took a sip. “Leaves. He’s like a tree. How did he make trainees asking you questions feel different?”
“It’s worth it.” Harry came closer to Teddy. “It’s worth it to try. I know I said it’s rotten, but I didn’t mean it was rotten to the core. For every person like Robards or Bernard Bickford, there are people like Kingsley and Ron.”
“Zidwidley collected my indicator solution a few months ago,” Harry said.  “You know how Robards always wants any unauthorized brews under lock and key.”  Dammit.  Harry was going to have to go to Malfoy for more.
“His mum does modelling,” Draco went on and, for the next fifteen minutes, proceeded to wax eloquent on the merits of Blaise Zabini.
Harry was beginning to recognize that look—that very strange look, with Malfoy’s nose in the air.  Malfoy was preening, just like he used to do.  For all that Harry had hated that expression in school, it looked much better than Malfoy scowling and being sullen, and Harry wanted to look away.  He didn’t want to think that Malfoy looked
Harry looked down at the potion.  “Because distilling potions takes weeks?” he asked, thinking this particular potion must be more difficult than the other ones he’d brought to Malfoy.  Perhaps this meant Harry might use the potions master at Hogwarts for consulting after all.
Yin shrugged. “I just don’t see it. What you’re meant to see. For me, there are like . . . maybe twenty faces. I sort people into face categories—that person’s blah with brown hair, that person’s blah with wide features, that person’s blah in a dainty delicate way; that’s all. But then you get to know them and it’s like—the corner of that person’s eye turns in such a way that it inspires the sun to rise in the horizon of their face.”
“Make me,” Harry said again, now more interested than teasing, but Draco obeyed, pushing him, hard. Then Draco was there, pushing Harry down, over him on the bed. Harry moved where Draco pushed, moving himself up on the bed so that Draco could get on top of him, fully clothed over Harry’s naked body.
He should have paid more attention to Boggarts in Malfoy’s first year. Travers’s Boggart had been a non-mag, but Harry hadn’t recognized it, rather distracted by Malfoy cutting to the back of the queue over and over. Malfoy hadn’t done that last year. He’d just faced his Boggart, cast Riddikulus, turned around without waiting to see what it did, and walked away.
Harry felt a little chagrined. “This is the part where I say I died, and I watched my friends get tortured, and I tracked criminals for years, and more than once witnessed a non-mag sacrifice because fringe-purists still think blood magic is a thing.”
If Malfoy’s face had been a house with a door and a window open, it looked now as though another window was opening. “Tell me about them.”
Harry made a strangled sound, wanting to laugh but sort of afraid he might burst into tears.  Draco was still covered in blood.  Harry could smell it on both of them, that pungent animal smell with the trace of metal underneath, like a butcher’s shop.
“You can hit me,” Harry said finally, because it was something he understood, even though it didn’t seem like Malfoy really wanted to.
“You think that’s funny, do you?” Draco said, feigning offence but in such a preposterously high voice that Harry smiled even more.  Pointing his wand at his nose, Draco said an incantation that made his nose hairs begin growing out in ringlets.  “No laughing!”  Draco said, his high voice making the ringlets jiggle.
,” but despite the fact that the situation was superbly terrifying there was still no effect, which made the man’s next stick-swish and words more moderately terrifying.  “
!” Spragg said. “If there wasn’t a permission structure in the Auror Force that allows the persecution of a portion of our population that is weak and helpless and ignorant—”
“We learned about dark sigils early in the term.” Harry turned back to Malfoy. “You’ve taken that part twice now.”
“I’m not her kid,” Harry explained, deciding Mister Malfoy looked confused.  “I’ve got to earn my keep, so I had to do the washing up before I got any.  But by the time I got them done, it was all gone.”
“No,” Draco agreed, tilting his head.  “You’re right.  I’d probably kill those poor Muggles, wouldn’t I?  Or at least I’d torture and maim them.  Maybe I would rape their children—who knows the kind of monster I am.  A boy-loving bigot; how’s that for a bogey-man?”
“He let Death Eaters into Hogwarts, tried to kill Dumbledore, and poisoned Ron,” Harry reminded her.  “So yeah, I’d say he did something.”
“Right.” Malfoy sniffed again. “Maybe I’ll go ask the Board.” Jaw hardening, he turned and walked away, leaving Harry behind to think about what it felt like to be used—even after all this time.
“Yeah.” Ron gave him a rueful smile. “You defeated Voldemort. Not blood supremacy. We all have our part to do.” Looking down, Ron jabbed a finger at the tiny rectangle in Harry’s hand. “Even him.”
“Maybe you could have got it when we were looking at the bookshelves,” Harry said, trying not to sound annoyed at him.
Luckily, Draco appeared distracted by the ledger, wandering over to the window to read.  Taking out one of Draco’s graduated cylinders, Harry began getting ready to add the final ingredient to Draco’s cure—and his own.
“I don’t mean anything he’s done is okay,” Harry said, realizing too late that he’d jumped in rather media res.
“Draco is doing what he thinks best,” Andromeda said.  “It’s okay if you’re angry, but it isn’t fair to blame him.”
“Malfoy said to give it to you when you were done,” Lee said, pressing the broom handle into Harry’s hand.
The problem with some people being magical and some people not being magical was that it was a hard divide that was always going to exist, always going to separate people. The point of Reveal was to lessen that divide, but while it was happening everything felt so much worse. The Timothy Tree felt so far removed, something that couldn’t and would never care, and Harry wanted to be underneath it more than ever.
“I meant,” Malfoy began, then stopped.  He didn’t look snobbish any longer, just miserable all over.
“But you’ll be facing down such dark terrors!  And saving the blood of innocents!  And puppies!” Mrs. Mulpepper called, as Harry finally made his way out of the door.
“You wish what?” Harry asked, hoping maybe Draco would say something about not being cruel or not being a bigot.
“Sure.” Malfoy’s voice was clipped as he swung his knapsack over his shoulder. He picked up the coffee cup that had been sitting beside his pile of things on the floor. Making as if to exit, he stopped by Harry, thrusting out the cup without quite looking at him. “This is for you.”
“Er,” Harry said, because Sibanyoni was kind of saying a lot of things that didn’t really make sense to him. Were they supposed to make sense? Was Sibanyoni going to tell him, or were they meant to resonate immediately? Was this esoteric mind healer jargon, or was Harry being close-minded? He should be open-minded, if he was going to let himself be helped.
“Probably nothing so severe,” Draco said.  “If worse comes to worst, we can use those hairs I found.  That would grow you to the age of the hairs, which is at most a few days and at least a few hours before the potion fell on you.”
“That’s because we’re such good friends.  I imagine I tell you everything.  You didn’t have a dance instructor, did you?  I bet you wouldn’t, having been raised by Muggles.  What was that like?  Terrible, I expect.  You must love coming to our house in the summer.  Have we played Quidditch on the greens?”
“You are a normal person,” Harry said, his aggravation so reflexive that he didn’t even notice he was calling Malfoy normal.  “Vance is just a ponce.”
Kavika was silent for a moment, in her still, steady way, and Harry found himself wanting reassurance, wanting someone who was not a friend from Hogwarts, not someone who had known Malfoy, to agree that this situation was unfair, that it was ridiculous. “I think that you have a kind heart,” Kavika said at last, “for pitying one who was so cruel to you.”
“Here,” Malfoy breathed, his finger on Harry’s lips.  His eyes had gone so dark.  “What’s it doing to you?”
“In my mouth,” Harry said, the answer feeling like it’d been on the tip of his tongue, his mouth garbled with a little too much spit. “Fucking—fucking my mouth.”
“He’s my godfather,” Teddy told Andromeda.  “Not a poor boy.  It’s all right, Harry.”  Turning back to Harry, Teddy walked up and put his arms around him.  “Pay no attention to Gran.  She loves you, too.”
“Voldemort wasn’t a political opponent,” Harry said.  “He was a megalomaniac who staged a coup and killed a lot of people in the process.”
“No. Yes.” Harry came away from the window, sitting down in front of Kavika. “I want to believe he can change. That people can change. That something, somewhere, makes them care enough about other people who aren’t like them. I want to believe it’s possible—otherwise, what’s the point?”
The view on the IC:WUT/UC swung to the door, to the trail of four marbles. “Now?” Malfoy said softly.
Kavika’s voice was the gentlest thing, in all its rough casing. “When we began, we said it would be temporary.”
Harry let go, but he still tried to move closer to Malfoy.  Meanwhile, Malfoy backed away, all the way up to the cabinets against the wall, the open glass cabinet above him.  “I never made you a slave,” Harry said, still not understanding why Malfoy was the one acting angry, why Malfoy was the one acting hurt.
gay?  At eleven?  The older version of Draco had made it pretty clear that his father was against it—but then, maybe that was why.  If Malfoy knew he was, had always known it, the way he knew that he was a boy and he was a wizard and he liked Quidditch, and there was Lucius Malfoy actively informing him he
“Here,” Harry said, conjuring a handkerchief.  “Blow your nose.  It’s okay to be worried about school, Draco.  My godson was terrified of it.”
“It isn’t a burden, Harry,” Mister Malfoy said abruptly.  “No one should act like it’s a burden, taking care of you.  Do they . . . ?”
he reads.  I’ll bet he’s the one I become best friends with, since you turned out a pillock.”  Draco glanced at him.  “No offence.”
Inside the package was a note, five galleons, a bottle of burgundy liquid, a packet of pink powder, and a tube labelled
“This really would be so much simpler if either of you had paid any attention at all in History of Magic.” Hermione looked so Hermione in that moment that Harry found himself smiling, even though he should have felt guilty.
“You can sleep wherever you wish,” Draco said, standing up.  Once Harry had stood up as well, Draco pointed his wand at the sofa to shrink it.  Instead of flying back in the window—which Draco said was not the safest thing on a transfigured, shrunken sofa—they did the disappearing thing, squeezing into blackness to appear again in the sitting room.  Dropping off the sofa, they went downstairs, through the shop, and back to Draco’s bedroom, where Draco set about transfiguring the bed.
After an hour, however, news of Diagon Alley had begun to spread on non-magical media, and the cars began to swerve at the sight of the houses, then stop. People began to get out of their cars, and the Order of the Phoenix went to work.
“But it’s easier,” Harry said. “It’s easier to be with someone if they’ve been through—if they know about it. The wizarding world.”
“They won’t keep going on that way.” Ron’s voice was warm. He reached out to touch Hermione’s wrist. “The Deal will help protect people.”
Gradually, however, the scent of bacon and the sounds of something happening on the other side of the door lured him, and as there was nothing else to do in the bathroom, Harry finally opened the door and walked out of it.
When the magic Voldemort had buried in the Mark at last began to spool out, it took the form of snakes made of green light, writhing in a mass on Malfoy’s arm. Seeing the swarming ugliness of them broke Harry’s heart, knowing that Malfoy had carried this seething hatred in him so long. “Don’t look,” Harry murmured again, still pressing Malfoy’s head away.
Draco was already leaving the kitchen, so Harry finished his breakfast in a flash, Scourgifying his plate so fast it left streaks of syrup still on it.  Putting it away anyway, Harry rushed out of the kitchen, through the sitting room, and clambered down the stairs.
“I—well, yes.”  Mister Malfoy looked startled, then started to look pleased.  “It takes a bit of practice, but I can do a number of small spells without it.”
Malfoy wasn’t looking at him any longer.  He also wasn’t looking sullen any more, his face a blank mask.  His eyes grey eyes looked brighter with his skin so clear.  Hastily, Harry turned back to Mrs. Mulpepper.  “That’s right,” he added intelligently.
politics. You. Here. In this room.” He turned to look at each of them. “You don’t want to pass Draco Malfoy because he busted a blood supremacist soiree, and some of them were your friends.”
Fuck.  Harry didn’t understand what Malfoy’s problem was, and Harry didn’t want to deal with it.  He didn’t want to deal with Malfoy’s ridiculous mood swings and his tetchy defensiveness and his horrible sensitivity, because the pain in Harry’s chest still ached and he didn’t like it.  He didn’t like dealing with this sort of thing.  Swiping the bottle off the table, Harry put it in his pocket.  “I have to go take care of this,” he said.  “If there’s more of it out there, it will cause problems.”
In the kitchen, eggs were flipping themselves in a pan on the cooker, while oranges squeezed themselves into a pitcher.  Bacon sizzled on another pan beside the eggs, and pieces of bread floated just over the flames, toasting.  Milk and jam sat on the table, with sun was streaming in on them through the blue curtains.  Harry thought he’d never seen anything look so nice.
As Harry went upstairs, however, Draco followed him, his voice accusatory the whole way.  “Where are you going?” he asked again.  “Why are you keeping me here?  I’ve half a mind to go back to Mother and Father; I don’t care if I’m thirty-two.  What are you doing?”
A wall went down, swiftly, schooling Malfoy’s face to blankness, as though being trusted was a graver insult than falling under suspicion for something heinous.
The smile went away completely.  “Merlin’s toadstools.”  Mister Malfoy’s expression was now deepening into a scowl.  Perhaps he didn’t like questions after all.  “Obviously, you’re not a Muggle.  You should know this already.  Your aunt and uncle should have told you.
A hard shudder wracked through Harry at these words. No one had ever talked to him like this before, and the arousal in his groin throbbed without the magic of Draco’s wand, thick and pulsing in his hot cock, making him too aware of the wet emptiness of his arse. Draco was going to fuck it again. He’d just fucked it, and he was going to fuck it again. “Yeah,” Harry said. “Okay,” and he got on his hands and knees.
I’d still like to be friends with you.”  Harry looked down at the pictures.  “Does this make us related?  Because you have Blacks in your family?”
“Or Dorthea. Gavin?” Malfoy sipped his coffee. “Let’s bathe our school grounds in Bertha’s blood and call it Timothy.”
Harry could feel that old feeling—a feeling he’d all but forgot about in the week he’d spent with Draco, but he’d felt it for so much of his life he wondered how he could have forgot.  It was that feeling like he might not be there at all, like he might not even exist.  Most of the time it was just as well; Harry didn’t much like when Uncle Vernon noticed he existed.  Sometimes, though, it felt like a dream—surreal, frightening almost.  Like he was in the middle of a room screaming, but no one could hear.
Putting the letter from Malfoy away, Harry took out a parchment, a quill. The educational facilities had only been mentioned in passing. They would need faculty, staff. They would need actual facilities. They would need classes, or at least some kind of structure—something like the Academy.
Malfoy jumped, whirling. “Merlin, Potter, you scared the bezoars out of me!” His eyes swept over Harry. “Are you following me?”
They went on like that for several hours—Draco showing Harry spells that chopped and stirred and scooped, brewing the potions until well into supper-time.
Mister Malfoy was still casting spells at the wobbly bread.  It was looking more like a cake, in fact, with two round layers and something jam-like in-between.  A soft white paste was coming from the tip of Mister Malfoy’s wand, and he was spreading it over the cake.  Harry very much hoped it was icing.
“Good job.” Robards was facing Harry, holding out his hand, but as Harry reached to take it, Robards deliberately turned to Malfoy, making it clear the congratulations was for Malfoy, not Harry.
!  The Truhart edition!”  Snatching another book from the shelves, Draco opened it up.  The pages of the book cast light into the room, making glowing shapes like a projection on the ceiling.  “Oh, wow,” Draco breathed.  “It’s Cartesian geometry for mandala runes.”
“Not if I don’t first.” Malfoy turned to Harry. “That’s how I found the Teddy—I put a tracking spell on her.”
“‘Our way of life.’” Harry understood all too well the cold feeling that came over him upon hearing that phrase; he did not understand the disappointment he felt. It was all he could have expected, from Malfoy. “You mean a way of life in which non-magicals are inferior, and they shouldn’t enter our lives or touch us at all, and those who associate with them are also inferior. That way of life?”
