Draco gets more than what he bargained for. WARNING: SMUT.
Before I knew it Draco was rushing me out, apparently having just finished. He gave me my paperwork and I smiled, at least he was nice about the names. For himself he went with Drake Pond, and for me he gave me Hadrian. My last name was Albott? I looked at him in question, but when he refused to look at me I was forced to keep quiet until we were out of sight. Turns out that over the next few months he refused to answer any questions regarding the last name. We ended up moving into an Inn and got several jobs to pay for rent. A few weeks before the Hogwarts term started we got our letters.
I just wanted to make an announcement about the direction of this story in the future. By this point, it's obvious that I intend this fanfiction to be quite smutty. However, I also do not want smut to be the main focus of this story. Each character has issues that need to be resolved, and I also know that them changing the timeline so obviously can result in unknown consequences for the future. In fact, this could completely erase this timeline entirely. But don't worry! I will explain this eventually when it becomes relevant in the story. I also am having a bit of trouble getting this written out since school has started up, so please note that updates will be more spread out.
I woke up with a start, sweat dripping off my body. Shit. It had been over two months and I hadn’t cum at all. I was trying to wait for them, but I just couldn’t wait anymore!
He dragged in air heavily as he spoke, "This sucks so bad Harry! What are we going to do?" I shrugged, putting my hand over his. He calmed down enough to continue walking. We tried to avoid Riddle as much as possible, but that soon turned out to be futile. We ended up running into him, literally. While Riddle and I managed to stay standing, Draco fell to the ground hard. His lithe, small frame seemed to take the sudden impact hard. I panicked and started to help him up, only to get beat to the punch by Riddle.
I groaned, my dick leaking precum making it easier to move my hand. I remembered how docile Draco had been, so cute when he cried and even cuter when he blushed. Harry had been tame, but still had a fight to him. It made me want to just fuck him so hard he couldn’t even think enough to fight. Oh, would he fight it, refusing to tell me how good it felt. Draco would just hide his face, whining as he rode me. Oh, him riding me would feel like a dream. He’d look so pretty, his back arched and his head thrown back. His pretty porcelain skin bright pink and sweaty.
Harry and Draco set ground rules.
I felt shocked and yet I understood where he was coming from, "Are you sure I can't just get different glasses?"
While Riddle is well, Riddle, Harry has been looking too much into that incident for my taste. He's been going on and on about how weird that was and how he seemed too friendly to me or whatever. Ugh. It wasn't like it should matter so much to him, not this much at least. That was besides the point I suppose, although it wasn't like there was much else to think about or do. In a few hours we were supposed to head over to Hogwarts, showing up the morning of the feast when everyone would arrive later that night. I guess I could be sleeping, but my mind wouldn't shut off. It happens from time to time, if time to time meant every night for the past 2 years. Ever since Who-Know-Who's return I've been on edge. Since my family was one of the most involved Death Eaters our house has been used for meetings. As much as I've tried to hide myself away from them, they kept finding ways to draw me downstairs and into their meetings.
I chuckled in embarrassment and turned my head away, "Merlin I can't believe I said that. How distasteful, huh?"
I began to see changes in Harry since we arrived here. Little ones at first, I barely even noticed, until I noticed him begin to act like a different person. Or at least more cautious, more aware. It was alarming to say the very least. Harry Potter finally acting as though he wasn't clueless? I almost couldn't believe my own eyes at times.
"And maybe change how we look so we don't resemble our grandparents that go there," I nodded in agreement as he sighed, "I can make my hair blonde, well darker I mean, and you can keep yours but maybe change your eye color?"
As we walked around I spotted a boy who I felt that I knew from somewhere. As he drew closer I began to realize where. It was him, Tom Riddle! He looked the same as when I last saw him, the same curly black hair, dark brown eyes, strong jaw, and fierce features. Looks even more handsome then I remember...I shook the thought off and dragged Draco into a side alley.
Harry smiled again, "Really? Well I really like it. I forgot to tell you, but you look more like who you really are underneath all those Malfoy traits you had. You look pretty." I looked at him wide eyed in silence until Riddle walked out.
Tom begins to think about the past, and decides on the future.
I've relived that moment over and over again in my head since it happened. Almost to the point of fantasizing. Being stuck in this time just means that I get to spend more time with Harry without having to share him like before.
He stiffened up slightly, "Albott did his fair share of provoking," I waved the comment off, "Besides, I never meant to insult you. I'll start off with something easy. Are you romantically involved?"
I righted myself. "What do you mean?"
Potter laughed and practically shoved his extended hand in my face, "Well I at least gave you answer, care to return the favor?"
Was he hitting on me? The gleam in his eye told me he was joking, but the tone made me pause. I blushed and answered quickly, "N-Not really. Why would you ask that?" That stupid voice really did something to me.
Harry rolled his eyes in annoyance, "Hard to be upset when your parents are horrible people." I knew in that moment he was thinking of his Aunt and Uncle, not of his real parents. I was sad to think his statement was all too true. At least for me, would I truly be upset of my parents died? My mother, yes, but my father? I wasn't too sure.
The sudden voice shocked me, "You look better here." I spun around only to see Harry, standing with a fond smile on his face.
I spoke before Harry could ruin everything, "Possibly, there was an attack on our village and our families didn't survive. Our parents were best friends, so they sent us here together."
The sudden thought of him becoming more and more like that hit me hard. Might be better not to think for a while. I sat up slowly and stood up, walking out of my room and into the kitchen. A quick glance at the clock made me realize just what time it was, nearly 5:00. Since we needed to be there in two hours I should start getting ready. Harry never really spent much time getting ready in the morning, he was more the roll out of bed and maybe even take a shower type. I was much more complicated with my morning routine. The first step was a shower, both shampoo as well as conditioner. After washing my body I get out, brush my hair, part it almost in the center but slightly off to the left side, and the put some product in. When I finished the next step was an outfit. Fairly easy, but I added a necklace to the school uniform. Harry had some money left over so he bought me a silver necklace. It was breathtaking, but simple. The chain was simple, and the pendant was of a heart shaped locket. Inside there was nothing, he had no pictures and told me he figured it would be good for any new memories that I may want to remember when we got back home.
It was a shame the wizarding world didn't place much value in muggles. Their literature and their inventions were truly splendid. Once I actually took a look, Mr. Weasley's obsession with the muggles was understandable. If more wizards and witches took a longer look Mr. Weasley's obsession would become an epidemic. If only they would open their eyes and see the truth. Alas, that would never happen.
I almost cried out when I came, and just panted into my fist. That didn’t feel as good as when Harry had replaced my hand, but at the moment it was all I could hope for.
Harry grinned, "I cooked breakfast for my Aunt and Uncle all the time, so I should be at least ok at it, right?" I nodded and gave my appreciation as he handed me a plate.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Better be...SLYTHERIN!" I watched as Harry gave a grim expression and I knew what he had done. He asked the hat to be placed there. All for me...
When I thought back on when we ran into Riddle(more like he knocked me over but whatever) the more I realized a few unfortunate things about myself. 1: I seem to be little too much into guys. 2:I have a things for ravens. 3: I want to strangle both Riddle and Harry.
Draco looked at me in shock, “Of course why wouldn’t we?”
Oh wow, dove right into that one huh? Hopefully, this explains why Tom wasn't really nice before.
Draco began to protect before I slammed my hand over his mouth, "Shhh! Remember how I told you about Riddle from our second year? Not only are we the same age as our grandparents, but the same age as Tom Riddle!" Draco's eyes widened, fear gripping them, "We'll be fine, he's not Voldemort yet, and he hasn't killed anyone as far as I know. He's just a student. But we need to be careful" I let him go and stepped back.
Only Harry seemed to understand, everyone else was too suspicious of me. Well the Twins aren't, but nobody listened to them. It's been nice, having three friends that actually care about me, Crabbe and Goyle never did and proved that time and time again. Sure I wasn't nice to them often, but who would be if they report everything to their fathers who report back to my own? Pansey didn't count either, her presence was a true annoyance. Always hanging around me, attempting to get my attention at every opportunity. I think she might like me, in a romantic sense that is. What a disgusting notion.
“Do we want to go home?”
He looked impeccable, far better than Harry. He must have used a spell, unlike Harry who looked like he had just brushed himself off, "Well, I do apologize for my lack of thought. How do I look now?" He spread his arms at his sides to show himself off.
"I already ate, don't want to be late. I know you'd hate that." My mouth felt dry as I watched him close the door, the shower turning on. Get yourself together...
Warning!- Drarry, Tomarry, my own personal ship Tomaco Bashing on Dumbledor and Snape, maybe others. This is also an AU where Draco Malfoy actually managed to befriend Harry and helps him in the Department of mysteries. Look, I think Draco deserves better so sue me. This takes place during harry's fifth year.
"You're here too? Anyone else?" He shook his head, "Well this is the worst. Any ideas on what to do?" I shared my previous thoughts on our predicament, detailing more issues with any other plans I had come up with. Draco looked thoughtful the entire time I spoke, only making small comments here and there. I expected him to freak out at some point, but he must have while I was gone. He had tear streaks on his face and red-rimmed eyes.
Harry had the idea to get a picture of us, and Draco had been in charge of taking it. I never knew they were trying to take pictures, so it caught me off guard when they had given it to me. It was all three of us, Draco laying in the grass with his head on my lap and Harry with his arm slung over my shoulder. We looked peaceful and content, it truly was a fantastic photo. I set it inside my trunk only to find a note.
Harry just wore a pair of red panties and a silk bathrobe to match. He looked down at the ground, his cheeks bright red.
I smiled fondly to myself, staring at the gift Harry and Draco gave me. It had been several weeks now since we had gotten together and we hadn't done anything other than kissing. Well, they kissed me, I had lost all control and yet I was surprised by how much it didn’t bother me. I did wish that we could do more, but if I wanted them to stay I had to listen to them as much as I hated it. Draco was just too cute not to fuck and Harry was too much of a brat not to punish! It was a little maddening that I couldn't do anything. We had already set up ground rules and I had proved myself trustworthy. They were only torturing me at this point.
Oh Merlin, that escalated quickly!
When we arrived the headmaster, who looked like a downright fool mind you, welcomed us with open arms. Since the first years were doing their sorting that night, we'd do ours in the office and it would be announced that night. As Harry and I both looked at each other we realized, we never thought about what house we would be in. Slight panic and nausea hit me as harry sat on the chair first. I watched in anticipation, ready to hear the word Griffindor echo in the room. I wasn't fir for any house but Slytherin, the other houses would never truly be a place where I could belong. Harry and I would be separated, and it would be all my fault.
"Isn't she always in that Library?" I spun around and grinned despite the grim look on Draco's face. He looked ragged, with messy hair and torn clothes. Made me think about how bad I looked.
The headmaster grinned, "Yes yes, of course of course. You're here now and that's what matters, eh? Now, please show the boys around the school and answer any questions they may have. I'll see you this evening!" We followed Riddle down the steps and then down the hall. We remained quiet, not wanting to break the silence.
I didn't even glance up, "I happen to enjoy the author. So far I am not disappointed." I left it at that, as did Riddle. Hermione had been the one to introduce me to muggle books, including this one. She had said I needed to be exposed to something other than "all that pureblood nonsense". She was right, this allowed me the chance to get to know muggles better than I had before. This book was one I especially enjoyed.
Riddle cleared his throat after a second, "So, that was the headmasters office. I show you the library and then the dining hall, those should be first," I smiled gratefully at him, smiling wider when he gave an amused look back, "So why are you transferring to Hogwarts? We've had some others in the past few years, ever since the war started, and I can only assume it's the same reasons?"
When I reached the corridor I couldn’t help but be shocked. In the place of what was supposed to be nothing stood a tall door. This had to have been it, but why was this here? I stepped through with my wand out, ready for anything. What I wasn’t expecting was a small bedroom, almost overtaken by a large round bed. The sheets were silk and a beautiful shade of green. Sitting on top of the bed were Draco and Harry. I salivated at the sight of them.
I stared at the date in disbelief: 1944...How did this happen?
"H-Harry..."
While I thought he looked hot I couldn't say that, "Like you just snogged the floor. Let's go." I turned on my heel to walk down the hall. Both boys followed me in silence. It felt good, stunning Riddle into silence. Even better Harry was finally not trying to pick a fight with him. I went back into the library, intent on reading before the feast started. I sat down on one of the recliners and pulled out my book. It was a muggle book, Ender's Game. (I know it didn't come out till later but I love the book so sue me)
"Well," Harry shrugged, "You've been on edge since we got here, this is the first time I've seen you as ease. Why, if you're ok with telling me, did you decide on that look? The longer hair, the freckles, the eyes?"
Draco's POV:
I desperately felt the need to roll my eyes. The absolute absurdity of the scene happening before me was almost too much to handle. Harry, after being antagonized by Riddle, had suddenly punched him. Before long both boys were on the ground, Harry with pure fury in his eyes and Riddle with a little too much glee in his. After a few moments with some frankly childish remarks from both I had had enough, "Levicorpus." Harry and Riddle were suspended in the air by their ankles, "You both should be utterly ashamed of yourselves. What a very muggle-like display," I let the spell go, dropping them without warning, "Now, go clean yourselves up. If I hear one sly comment or if you even look at each other wrong I will send you to the hospital wing, the both of you."
I know this went a little fast but ah well. I want to introduce more characters and am willing to add some OC's. Just say what they look like (weight, height, eye color, and all that) and their personality. Include their ideal friend group, love interests, and house. Oh! And the age of course! Can't wait to see what you guys come up with.
Thank you for all the comments and kudos! They really help and kept me going as I wrote the story. I even changed my delivery of one chapter based on a comment I received on the previous chapter, and because of that my new version of the chapter did very well! I love and appreciate each and every comment, Kudo, bookmark, and hit! Thank you, everyone, I love you all!
Riddle and Harry sat at a table nearby. Riddle gave me a strange look when he read the title, "Why are you reading a muggle book?"
I nodded, "Yes, he's correct. He had his own reasons. Mine are a bit more complicated. You see they practiced dark magic and were very interested in blood purity. They're descendants of a very old branch of pure bloods. They were cast out, but managed to retain their blood purity. I have no idea what family or if that family even still exists. Long story short they were never very nice people. My mother was kind enough, but went along with my father. And him, well he loved to show me just how much of a disappointment I was to him. There's more, but that is the gist of it." I smiled bitterly. Sure the story about blood purity was fake, but everything else was not. It still hurt to remember.

Morning:
Sorry, it's so short! Although I figure that this little cliffhanger of mine will be even worse than the chapter being short.
I smiled and took his hand, "I would love the help, Potter."
I had been dreading this question, "Um well, mostly I've just always liked the look. Plus I, well I had always liked the Weasleys. Their hair was just a physical representation of who they are. Hard working and caring people. A little wild, but beautiful all the same."
I smiled at him, "We'll need a back story."
Riddle grinned, "Just messing around. Was Albott right? That you both hated your parents? Why is that, hard to believe someone could hate their own parents." I remembered something that Harry had told me. When he first met Riddle he had called his father a stupid muggle. Or something akin to that. What was truly hard to believe was how Riddle was acting almost normal. He's not even 17 yet, so I supposed even young dark lords have the right to be a kid.
"Harry."
After I was sorted, into Slytherin of course, we were given our robes, "Now boys, I had the prefects ready for when you were sorted. That way you could be shown around and taught the ropes, if you will. Since Slytherin was the unanimous house given by the hat, the Slytherin Prefect will be arriving shortly. His name is," The flame of the large fireplace shot up to reveal the one boy both were dreading to see again, "Ah yes, Tom Riddle, there you are. I was wondering if you had not gotten my message." The headmaster clapped him on the back and chortled.
Borgin had warned Draco that the potion could cost him his sanity. That was why Draco had been reluctant to use it right till this moment. But, at this point, he didn’t have much sanity left anyways. So why the hell not?
Draco doesn’t know where he’s headed. Everyone is still in the Great Hall and the corridors he’s passing through are all empty except for the babbling portraits on the walls. He makes a turn into a particularly quiet, deserted corridor when he hears the sound of footsteps from a few paces behind himself. He reaches into the pocket of his trousers – heart beating a little faster now – and slowly pulls out his wand. The sound of the footsteps seems closer now. He takes a deep breath and turns around at once, aiming his wand threateningly at the person in front of him who hurriedly raises both his hands, palm-up, in a peaceful gesture.

already.”
The group of girls exchanged a few nervous looks with each other before they turned around and quietly, walked away.
“So, as you can see, the Quidditch locker rooms are still being repaired, and the Hufflepuff locker room is the only one with functioning showers,” Boot was saying.
“It’s not… I’m not…” Draco mumbles, his face heating slightly.
“Wow, how charming, Potter,” Draco cocked his head to one side, giving him an unimpressed look. “Except, you can’t give this away because it’s actually a school property,”
“No!” Draco cried, fisting one hand around the base of his cock to stop it from obliging Harry’s words. “I want you to fuck me. Please.”
Draco was panting heavily, his legs spread on either side of Harry body and his cock already leaking with precome. He watched, hungrily, as Harry pulled off his blue jumper and then his toga. He leaned in for another kiss and Draco – allowing himself the pleasure of tangling his fingers in that unruly mess of black hair – impatiently removed the crown of green laurel leaves from Harry’s head, tossing it aside.
“Alright, love?” Harry paused, concerned.
“Me too,” Draco brushed a finger across the soft petals of the roses absentmindedly.
“What happened?” Draco asked in lieu of an answer. His voice sounded hoarse to his own ears.
, Draco. I’m not going anywhere. Go to sleep, love. I promise I’ll be right here when you wake up.” Harry whispered into his ear, stroking Draco’s hair.
“Today I wished you were there with me more than I’d ever done before,” Harry told him. “I was at the verge of a mental breakdown and I could’ve really used my anchor.”

“That’s because

one day.
“I wish your father could be here to see this,” His mother sighed.
The sleeves of Potter’s white shirt are folded up to his elbows and his red-and-gold gryffindor tie is loose around his neck with the two top buttons of his shirt undone. And to torture Draco even more, Potter’s shirt tail is riding up in one side to reveal a taut flank and a sharp hipbone that Draco suddenly feels an urgent need to run his tongue along and taste.
Pansy lets out an impatient sigh. “The outfit I was telling you about? The one I’m gonna wear to Hogsmeade tomorrow. Where you even listening?”
“I suppose so,” Harry’s voice came out almost as a whisper, and when Draco looked up at him, he saw that Harry’s green gaze was firmly pinned to his lips. Draco’s breath caught.
The past few weeks had been … eventful, to say the least. Draco had told his friends about the truce he had made with Potter, and asked them if they wanted to join him in it. Blaise had said yes right away – ever the political one – but Pansy had hesitated. She hadn’t held him back, but she hadn’t joined him either. She still liked to steer clear of the Gryffindors, especially Potter and his two best friends, as much as possible, but Draco was positive that she would come around eventually. He had proof, after all.
“What is going on here?” a too-familiar, deep voice interrupted; Draco turned his head to find Har-
Potter is finally kissing him.
. Never mind,” he put the basket on a top shelf and walked away to the other side of the room.
As Slughorn goes on and on and on about how interesting he finds Draco’s idea for reducing the negative effects of some of the healing potions he has been teaching them about, Draco nods politely but he doesn’t catch a damn detail. The only thing he can think about is the shape of an angular jaw he had caught sight of at the eighth years’ breakfast table that morning and that ringing of a deep, delighted laughter he’d heard last night that had touched him right on the fucking heart.
A huff of surprised laughter escaped Draco’s lips. He felt strangely

Draco stood under the pleasant, steaming shower for several minutes, letting the hot water soothe his taut muscles and wash away the ache in his bones. When he finally stepped out of the shower stall – his dark green turtleneck tucked neatly into his black trousers and patting at his damp hair with a soft, baby blue towel – Potter, Weasley and Justin Finch-Fletchley had already showered and each stood by a locker, caught up in a heated conversation about the game.
satisfying to see us weak and struggling?”
“Don’t touch my stuff.” The girl slapped his hand away, disgusted. “Just move along.”
“How did you know I was going to say that?” Potter said, confused.
“Who do you mean? I …”
This fic is finally finished!
The second chapter is here!
“Yeah, think I’d like that,” Harry murmured. Draco could feel his long erection pressed against the small of his back.
Potter turned his attention to somewhere behind Draco’s ear, gritting his teeth. “That fucking bastard,” he spat.
Draco – feeling extremely uncomfortable – tried to subtly slide out of Potter’s hold and somehow take himself – without drawing any more attention to himself – to the Slytherin table where he could quietly have the nervous breakdown he had fairly earned.
And on top of the picture the headline read, bold and harsh:
Don't forget to leave me some positive feedback if you did so ;)
“Fuck, Draco, get up,” Harry said after Draco looked up at his downturned face as he took him all in, and Draco obliged, pulling
“Oh?” Potter swallowed, visibly taken aback.
And Draco was

Granger sighed with defeat. “It’s the Prophet. You’re on the front page again.”
getting himself into this situation? Cleaning that shithole of a Potions’ supply room would take hours! There were a thousand different potion ingredients in there and some of them were seriously dangerous. Besides, Draco had never even cleaned his own room in his entire life!
Draco shook his head, trying to get Potter out of his mind for now. He readied his cauldron and sat about chopping the gillyweed into symmetrical pieces. For several minutes, the class was mostly quiet except for the clattering of ladles in cauldrons and knives slicing ingredients; so Draco was startled out of concentration when he heard a pretty loud snort.
!” Draco pushed him away half-heartedly, his face turning pink and his mouth twitching into a tiny smile.
“Is this okay?” Harry murmured, his lips brushing Draco’s cheekbone.
“Just go with him, Draco,” Blaise urged.
“I think we’ll survive,” Draco sniffed, looking down at Harry’s snow-covered brown boots.
“If you’re quite done, gentlemen,” Professor Frensby –their DADA teacher – is standing in the doorway with her arms crossed over her chest. “It’s time to begin today’s lesson.”
and it totally matches the mood of that scene. So I thought maybe you guys wanted to listen to it as well! (
Draco had just kept his head down and took all the hits, one after the other. And now he was here, in the Hospital Wing. Severely injured by one of the many people who hated him. And Draco already knew that once he got discharged, he would continue to keep his head down, to not fight back and to let them hurt him and call him by all the foul names they could think of.
“Okay, Ron, just leave it,” Potter told Weasley before putting on his grey shirt and taking a couple of steps closer to stand in front of Draco. “Malfoy, when you go crazy at people like that, you have no idea how much you remind me of…”
“You’ll see.” Harry threw back a glance at him, grinning.

, Draco stepped out of the Slytherin common room, absentmindedly curling a piece of long blonde hair around his forefinger in order to calm his nerves. When he had gone back to the dormitories that afternoon after Transfiguration and found his costume neatly laid out on his bed – washed and ironed by the house-elves – he hadn’t been able to help the warmth he’d felt spreading in his chest.
? Malfoy you’re his cousin! You two are family, I have no right to keep you away from him,” Potter said, and then in a gentler tone, “And I have no desire to do so either.”
“But you seemed alright,” Harry frowned.

“Hey!” Draco crossed his arms. “A man’s mascara is like his toothbrush. I can’t let you rub my mascara all over your dirty eyelashes!”
“Narcissa!” Harry called, coming up to stand beside Draco and wrapping an arm around his waist.
walking towards them. He gulped, his fingertips suddenly prickling with nerves.
“Haven’t you heard the story? Anthony lost a bet to Neville about some magical plant and he had to sign up for Keeper position. And there was no competition, so he got it!” Weasley sniggered, face red with mirth.
… don’t stop,” Draco babbled, tightening his grip on Harry’s toned shoulders and – as Harry started thrusting into him with brutal force – biting down on the flesh of his flexing shoulder to muffle his cries.
“Okay.” Harry smiled and let go of Draco’s hand to stand in front of the hidden entrance of the room. He closed his eyes – frowning in concentration – and paced past the section of blank wall three times until a plain white door appeared on the wall.
Draco swallowed hard, looking away. He wasn’t able to find a reason for the sudden jolt of hurt and embarrassment he felt in his chest.
-Slytherin’s Chamber of

found it, after all.
“That’s my old wand,” Draco looked at Potter with disbelief. “You kept it?”

Suddenly, everything clicks into place and Draco has to stop himself from breaking into a feat of hysterical laughter. Of course. Of-fucking-course Pansy would do that. That evil genius! How could he not have guessed already?!
What if Draco wouldn’t have the strength to hold back and tried to kiss Potter or anything equally as horrible? This was stupid.
Secrets! He’d always wanted to see that place. “Nothing. I’m just a little preoccupied.”
Draco is tapping his fingers impatiently on the wooden surface of his desk and glancing at his watch every ten seconds, waiting for the last five minutes of Transfiguration to pass so he can go outside and somehow distract himself from counting every remaining second for the next twenty-five minutes until 10:55.
“I just wanted to say that …” Draco swallowed, cradling Harry’s cheek with his hand. “Thank you for having my back when I had forsaken myself,” he murmured, tilting his chin up to peck at Harry’s surprised mouth.
“So fucking delicious,” Potter groaned when he finally pulled away, brushing the tip of his nose against Draco’s.
She walks out of the common room towards the girls’ dormitory and leaves Draco slightly aghast. He looks at the potions book on his lap and tries to think of all the ways that Pansy could make Potter want to kiss Draco that wouldn’t be an utter disaster and comes up empty handed.
“It was an accident,” Draco grunted at him, very pointedly avoiding eye contact. He didn’t know what he would do now that he was alone with Potter and he very much did
He had Harry, and that was enough. It was more than enough.
“I don’t know what you want me to say, Headmistress,” Draco said, frustrated. “I already told you, I didn’t see the attacker’s face.” He was in McGonagall’s office. He’d been told to go there straight from the Hospital Wing.
,” Draco looked away, his face red. “Well, you can keep it,”
“It’s fine, Potter. I’m fine. No need to sweat it,” he said, gently tugging his robes out of Potter’s strong grip.
“Hey, you did this to yourself on purpose!” Potter protested beside him. “Now stop complaining and get to work.”
Harry liked him back. This Harry, his own real Harry actually
“Harry, dear,” she surpassed a delighted chuckle as Harry took her delicate hand in his own and brought it to his mouth, kissing it lightly. “Congratulations on your graduation.”
He only responded to Weasley’s
“Look, I’ll just get straight to it.” Potter said; a determined but somehow annoyed look in his bright green eyes. “I saw you yesterday; with Ernie. And I know you could have countered that spell with your eyes closed. I’ve seen you duel before and I know that you could have fought back, but you didn’t. Why didn’t you fight back, Malfoy?”
“Has it?” Draco gritted his teeth as his Dark Mark started to itch uncomfortably. He hated this place with his entire being.
The unexpected friendship that had sprung between the two of them in the past month was still young and fragile, and it was one of the best things to ever happen to Draco in his entire life. He couldn’t afford to lose it over an emotion that couldn’t be reciprocated. This wasn’t the sweet and beautiful alternate reality; this was Draco’s own ugly, messed up life.
Draco was walking out of the classroom with his head down, completely lost in his thoughts – as he had been for the entire length of the class – when a strong hand grabbed him by the back of his robes and before he could even let out a yelp of surprise; dragged him inside the nearest closet.
“An Auror mission. Classified. The whole team was there. Minor injuries mostly, but still, it was utter chaos.”
“Really?” A huge grin cracked up Potter’s face. “Okay! Brilliant!” He took a glance at his watch. “Oh, crap, I’m late for DADA. See you at lunch!” Potter pecked Draco on the lips and zipped his trousers back up before opening the door and walking out.
“Fuck,” Harry swore at the touch. “But you’ve been avoiding me so much lately, I thought-
And in that moment, Draco had realized what a great mistake he had made. The consequences of drinking the Sweet Agony were just as grave and destructive as promised. Draco had taken the leap in hopes of a lethal crash, but now it felt like he was floating in the dark abyss in a never-ending fall. The sweetness was long gone, but the agony was like a solid, heavy weight on his chest, mercilessly crushing his heart underneath.
Harry had promised to be there when he woke up. He’d swore that he’d never let Draco go. But the next morning, Draco had woken up in his own bed, shaking and miserable and all alone.
“Shut up Weasley.” Pansy rolls her gleaming eyes. (Why are her eyes gleaming?”)
“Yes you
“I’ve thought about that a lot, actually,” Harry replied. “I wasn’t sure about it at first, that’s why I came back here for Eighth Year; to give myself time to consider it. But fighting is what I do best, and I don’t mind it, as long as it’s done for the right cause. There are still a lot of things that need to change about our world. The War might be over, but the fight continues, I want to be a part of it.”
“Don’t worry Draco. It’s like you don’t know me at all, I would never put you in that position.” Pansy rolls her eyes dramatically and Draco’s heartbeat slows down a fraction, she’s right. “Trust me, I’m gonna make
“And another score for Gryffinpuff!” Ginny Weasley announced, making the crowd go wild once again.
McGonagall took her delicate square-shaped spectacles off, massaging the bridge of her nose with her forefinger and thumb. “Mr. Malfoy, I just want you to know that regardless of your actions in the past, you’re still a student in this school and as headmistress, the last thing I want is for any harm to come to my students. So I’ll politely ask you once again to tell me if you have any suspicions regarding the identity of your attacker.”
Gasping, Harry fisted a hand in Draco’s hair, guiding his head, and Draco let him, swallowing around Harry’s cock and making him tighten his grip on Draco’s hair with pleasure.

??? Weasley, you uncultured
“No mate, not with Rita.” Weasley shook his head. “Do an interview with
,” Draco ran a wet tongue across his bottom lip, tasting the sweet flavor of treacle tart on it. “What was that?” He tilted his head, looking back at Harry with his pupils blown wide.
“Sorry,” Draco said, and let go. The jar fell to the ground, smashing into a thousand pieces.
Draco stopped, turning his head to see Ernie MacMillan standing at the foot of the steps, his jaw set and wand readied.
!” Draco protested, trying to sound threatening, but the proximity of Potter’s body and the scent of him filling Draco’s lungs smoothed out the sharp edges of his tone, so it came out as a weak mumble. He rested his cheek on Potter’s shoulder and quietly breathed him in; they stayed like that for several minutes.
“I couldn’t give up. My life’s never really been just mine; so I didn’t have a choice but to move on. But in order to do so, I needed forgiveness, and I didn’t feel like I deserved it. So, I think I kind of… tried to earn it?” Potter frowned, looking back up at Draco. “I tried to become the godson Sirius would want me to be, and do things that he’d be proud of me for. It took time, but I slowly began to heal. I’m sure you can too, if you want to. Or maybe you’d find your own way of earning forgiveness, but you should give yourself a chance, Malfoy. You deserve it.”
“Oh God!” Draco held on to Harry’s shoulders for dear life, his head spinning at the feel of Harry’s cock stretching him open.
Potter led him to the middle of the dancing crowd, wrapping his bare arms loosely around Draco’s waist and burying his nose in Draco’s hair. “You know you look cute as
“Is it …? Can I …?” He stumbled over his words.
“Ummm…
“Of course, you do,” Harry said, brushing Draco’s hair out of his eyes. “You are a fighter, Draco. A survivor, just like me. You have your own battle scars just like me,” he took Draco’s tattooed wrist in his hand and brought it up to his mouth, kissing it softly. “And I love you for it.”
“Yeah, Gin, you did a great job,” Harry grinned, putting a hand on the small of her back.
Draco leaned into the touch and let Harry’s warm breaths spread across his cheeks, drinking in the sheer contentment that being this close to Harry seemed to always bring for him.
Harry had told him that night, as he held Draco and pressed their foreheads together, the cool scent of his body like a protective bubble all around Draco, keeping him safe.
He looked up to see Potter gesturing for him to open it. Draco rolled his eyes. A crumpled ball? Seriously? Potter couldn’t even be bothered to fold the parchment into something decent? Even back in the days that they used to be enemies and Draco liked to send Potter mean, hateful notes, he’d still shown more class than
Better to let the man think you’re planning to kill him or something rather than to have him find out you’ve been harboring feelings for him for the past four years, right?
pity me or I’ll gouge your eyes out with my bare hands,”
“Don’t worry. I don’t think a little bit of rolling would be so bad for him,” Potter said, having the audacity to fucking
“So, Draco tells me you want to be an Auror,” she remarked with interest, and Draco’s face instantly burned with embarrassment.
A flurry of images rushed through Draco’s mind.
“… and win the war so you and your pureblood friends would be the only ones left in this school. Isn’t that what you wanted to happen when you offered to hand over Harry Potter to the Dark Lord, Parkinson?” one of the girls was saying, crossing her arms and looking at Pansy with disgust.
“So you know everything about me, do you?” Potter clenched his fists, his voice rising. “Yeah, you’re fucking right, Malfoy. My life’s been all fun and games. I never made mistakes; I just snapped my bloody fingers and
“Don’t underestimate me, Potter,” Draco managed, holding on to Harry’s bicep with a white-knuckled grip. “I can take more.”
“Please.” Draco closed his eyes and clenched his jaw.
“Okay, let me go get some for you,” Draco said, starting to get up when Harry put a hand on his shoulder and stopped him.
The person’s other hand shut the door behind them and Draco was, unceremoniously , shoved face-first into it, his cheek squashed against the hard wood. The person let go of Draco’s robes to push his long fingers into Draco’s hair and Draco let out a half-startled, half-aroused gasp as the man pressed his body against every part of Draco’s back, from head to toe.
. Just leave it to me.” Pansy gives him a wicked wink and turns to leave, her too-short skirt swirling around her thighs. “Sleep well, darling. Tomorrow’s a big day!”
All through the night, as he sat and listened to Granger’s speech with his fingers interlocked with Harry’s, or when they all threw their caps in the air in union, or after that, when they crossed the Black Lake on the enchanted boats like they had done all those years ago when they were First Years; Draco was strangely, unbelievably, and heartwarmingly happy.
As Draco gets a closer look at her, he realises that it’s the same healer who first diagnosed him with the wasting curse that’s slowly been killing him.
“Could we take them to Malfoy Manor first?" He gives a minute shrug. “It should be more than large enough to house all of those people, and unless I'm mistaken it's heavily warded?”
“Harry!” Ron’s voice echoes to the room, filled with relief.
"What the bloody hell is going on in that compartment?" he mutters to himself.
"Lucius Malfoy said that?" Ron's voice is twisted in a grimace.
Maybe he's just here to laugh at Draco, laugh at him for being a pathetic mess?
“Let me go get the desserts from the kitchen,” he says and gets to his feet.
Harry realises with a small start that Draco probably thinks that Harry is really disappointed about losing out on the desserts. He has no idea what the whole plan actually was.
Armed with this knowledge, come to him from the love of a mother, and burning with righteous anger over the loss of his lover, the God of the Sun struck down the God Wisher and turned his weapon upon himself.
His friends are quiet, and he wonders what they’re thinking.
There's a bit of shuffling as no one seems to know what to say anymore. Draco bites his lip; he wants to talk to Harry alone, but he doesn't want to ask for it. Especially since his mother still hasn't let him go—at this point he's fairly sure that she's just doing it to embarrass him.

at all.
“You did tell me that, yeah.” Harry feels oddly breathless as he stares at Draco, who is now positively beaming with pride. It's a really good look on him. most things look really good on him, if Harry is being honest.
Especially since it’s now clear to him and everyone that he hasn’t learned Occlumency... But he still absolutely refuses to let Snape back in his mind.
He sold himself to the greatest monster the wizarding world has ever seen to save his parents… Perhaps that’s what cost him his Other? Perhaps they realised who he was and couldn’t bear to be his. Perhaps they went through a Core Severing to unbind themselves from Draco.

before they summarily banished me from the Manor.”
Before long, Draco is left alone in the lounge with Harry.
He stares at the letters uncomprehending. He has no idea what that means. He assumes that Jean is Hermione, since he knows that her full name is Hermione Jean Granger. It would be a simple way for her to use a code but not risk someone else having found Harry's coin he supposes. But what does the rest of it mean?
"I wonder what made them swarm us like that," Harry mutters as he chews on a granola bar. "It was like they knew we would be there."
“Come on now, you cow. I can call for one of them when we’re out there. It’s time for us to
He could get a well-regarded French potions master to take him on as an apprentice and get a secondary degree in medicinal potions in France… But he knows he’ll never be able to work with the likes of St. Mungo’s.
The photo beneath the headline depicts an almost-destroyed room Harry doesn’t recognise, and several people he recognises from the graveyard are being led out of the shot by people wearing Auror uniforms.
Of course, it seems the universe truly does hate Draco, because Harry and Ginny Weasley step inside the shop.
Well…
Pansy pushes him down into a booth and heads off to the bar, leaving Draco to sit by the table alone.
A small cough interrupts them.
They sneak into Malfoy Manor under the cover of night, even though Draco reassures Harry that there is no chance that any Death Eaters are squatting there. In the end, he agrees with Harry that it's for the best that they're as careful as they possibly can be.
Draco's eyesight is going, so Harry has taken to reading for him. Always in the garden, even if it's raining—there are charms for that, after all.
“Harry? Who’s safe?” A voice comes from whatever Potter is holding. Older, definitely an adult. Likely to be Sirius Black, then.
Draco lays the stick,
a reason to talk to us! Of course not!"
And then the man's eyes start to
Still, Draco thinks, as Potter bustles around the room cursing up a blue streak every time he hits his foot on something, maybe things are getting a bit better. Maybe Potter
And another.
Draco shakes his head. “The Black and the Lestranges, for example, are among the most extreme, Harry. That’s why they intermarried so much not just among each other, but also within their own families.” He shrugs again. “No one’s as extreme as the Gaunts, though. They intermarried with siblings and first cousins until they inbred themselves into their entire family line going extinct.”
. People are coming up to him to apologise for not believing him and being mean and gossiping… And Harry can’t pay attention because he’s too busy thinking about Draco Sodding Malfoy.
He wishes he had another glass to throw.
"Does... What is the Spoken Name of the God of the Sun?" Draco says, voice barely above a whisper.
He can’t believe that Potter would go this far. Would… would come after Draco like this.

He feels restless, uncertain, and like he doesn't fit inside his own skin.
His loud call causes Ron and Hermione to look over while Sirius laughs and disappears from the mirror.
in his letter to Harry. Say it just… came up and he needs to get away for awhile?
He’d thought he’d gotten better about that whole “spoiled” thing, but it seems his entitlement still runs so strong he was blind to the fact that Potter deceived him. And here he is, heartbroken and embarrassed.
Suddenly, there’s loud screaming and chaos, and Harry watches in horror as the servers suddenly start yelling at everyone to leave the restaurant
An unseen force punching him in the nose.
Draco. He's... He's... He's Draco... Draco...
Smiling and humming to himself, Draco takes his empty cup over to the sink. It’s time to get ready for bed. Draco’s job as an independent potions master and researcher may allow him to set his own hours, but he enjoys having a routine so he’s up at a decent time every day anyway.
He loves the flowers though, and the wonderful birdsong he can hear whenever they go outside.
Harry takes a moment to gather himself, but then he does what he needs to.
“Just as I told you it would,” Draco says, his voice now holding far more of his customary smugness and self-assuredness. It's a relief to hear him sound more like himself again. Harry wonders if maybe he just doesn't like to hear Draco be scared. Harry wouldn't like to hear Ron or Hermione be scared either, so it makes sense.
Like the God of Logic and Knowledge before him, he went seeking for the Truth and Knowledge he needed to transcend his mortal form.
“He's just saying that, you know. He doesn't like you as much as he likes us, never will. You will never mean the same thing to him, as we do.”

“No!” Draco yells the words before he can stop himself. Kreacher needs to stay with his mother, he
Draco feels like a petulant child, but it's the truth. Potter decided that Draco wasn't any of his business anymore, so he shouldn't be here and trying to make it his business.
If he would have had any chance of taking his N.E.W.T.s, he probably would be a bit more put out about it, but as it is… Well, he’s got nothing that he
“Other? What’s that?” Granger sounds confused.
“Oh good, you’re… you’re still alive,” Ron blurts, and then he’s ushering the healer forward.
How do you even admit something like this to someone? Even people who are your best friends? Who stuck with you even as you made the kind of mistakes that generally end with prison or death?
Still… There are important topics for them to discuss, and Draco can’t hide them away. Not now, not when they came so close to losing everything…
Even after Draco has finally put on some proper clothes—it really was more about getting some actual physical distance and walls between him and Harry than the clothing, he could use magic for that after all—he still doesn’t want to leave his room. He doesn’t want to face Blaise and Pansy, and he has little hope that Potter has actually done as Draco asked and left.
He can’t let himself cry, not in front of them, no matter how much he wants to. Not yet, not until he’s far weaker than he is now. Perhaps he will allow himself some tears when they reach May, when any hope of rescue has been properly vanquished from his heart.
to marry Draco, so of course he doesn’t want Draco to turn his marriage proposal down. However, he doesn’t want to botch another proposal either. It’s become almost silly, and it’s actually starting to get painful.
He pulls it out and looks at the edge of it. Instead of being numbers, there are letters. He has never seen it do that before.
He blinks. And blinks again.

what it is. Death is a word he recognises, but… somehow it barely feels real. Death means no longer living… But what does it mean to no longer live? If his parents stopped living, if Death took them… What would happen then?
“Thank you, mother.” He smiles at them. “I’ll be heading over to Pansy and Blaise shortly, but perhaps we can do Saturday brunch tomorrow? I know I’ve missed out on it quite a bit, lately…”
Her extreme refusal to teach them anything practical just seemed like overcompensating, like she was in truth insecure and frightened. Of course, it’s also entirely possible that she’s just one of those people who will suck up to the powers-that-be regardless of policies and ideals simply because she’s power-hungry. Not to mention sadistic.

“Does it say anything else?” Hermione’s trying to see the paper over Ginny’s head while Ginny’s practically hanging over Neville’s shoulder, trying to see for herself.
Potter—!
And… it is. Now that he’s thinking about it, that actually sounds quite lovely. His family certainly have more than enough money to get through all the red-tape regarding private international floos, and Draco knows his parents would metaphorically jump at the chance to spoil him in such a way. He’s been very strict regarding wanting to work on his potions business and living in his own apartment—even though of course he’s always had his full Gringotts vault to fall back on—so to give them a chance to spend money on him…
“Well, it’s not written by Skeeter,” he says. “It’s actually written by the Editor-in-chief herself, so
Harry climbs out of bed as Draco keeps himself seated under his own power. He can hardly believe how quickly he’s regained strength!
He frowns and looks around the Room, trying to see who could have conjured a room like this, when suddenly a door to Harry's right opens and out steps...
“Probably because Harry said he saw him at the graveyard…” Neville says as he continues to read. “Well, huh. I guess he must have frightened them into actually printing what he said verbatim.”
“What?” Harry looks genuinely gobsmacked, which makes Draco smile a bit.
“Mr Malfoy,” she says, and suddenly she’s holding a vial with disgusting looking red liquid in it. “I must ask that you drink this potion immediately, the sooner, the better your chances.”
Harry yanks Malfoy forward and slams him back into the wall, taking pleasure in the way his head bounces off the wall and the squeak of pain he lets out.
"You have nothing to fear from me, certainly not for hiding and shielding him. I've been searching for a century, and I'd much rather he be safe due to people like you, than having found him earlier hurt and abused."

“One single drop in each of these windows should do it, I think.”
“As long as he doesn’t ingest it or get it on his mouth area, he’ll be fine. We also checked for any other allergies, but it’s just grapefruit, so that’s lucky. It could have been worse if it were a common potion ingredient.”
Malfoy’s face pales and his eyes grow wide just as Harry’s magic slams out from his body, forcing the hex to disperse and pushing Malfoy backwards, sending him stumbling. Quick as a striking snake, Harry catches Malfoy by the wrist and reverses their positions.
“Why are you even doing this?” Draco just cannot understand why. What does Potter hope to gain from this, beyond the return of colour vision in both of his eyes? It’s not like he wants anything to do with Draco at the best of times…
Draco is silent for a long time, and Harry almost repeats his question when Draco rolls over to his side and pulls something out of his bag.
“We have it in a cupboard in your father’s study. I’ll go get it immediately, my darling.”
Magical houses tend to take on and reflect the magic that happens inside them, and the people who live there. The Dark Lord and his dark and corrupt nature warped the Manor quickly… Though Draco would also wager that some of the dark artefacts Father used to keep have been destroyed, and some of the cursed heirlooms have at
Harry shakes his head. “You didn’t see your father’s face when I told them. I’m quite certain he was contemplating strangling me with his bare hands, not even using magic for it.” He tilts his head to the side and looks pensive. “Though I think the look your mother gave me might have been worse, like she could stare into my soul and found me lacking. It took me a few days to convince them to at least let me
He had always imagined that revenge would have come during those first years when he sooner expected Aurors to hex him than help him. He imagined that someone would simply follow behind him, drag him into a back alley and use Diffindo or something to slit his throat or lop his head off. He expected that the Aurors would be extremely unhelpful to his parents and his murder would have gone unsolved forever.
Adriana nods swiftly. "That's very likely! You would have to be from very far away, I cannot even imagine how far, if you hadn't heard the stories of the gods. Perhaps there are places where they don't believe, but... I think they're rare."
She rolled her eyes at him, but Ron's more than used to that by now so it doesn't affect him at all. It's just one of those things they do at this point, that always makes Harry roll his eyes at them.
for your son, Lucius. Night after he night he dreams of him, naked and spread out beneath him." The Dark Lord chuckles again. "I have no doubt that if Draco put his mind to it, he could seduce Potter in a heartbeat. Seduce him, and have him too busy thinking with his nether regions to consider just what it may be Draco's asking of him."

"So you're not having any luck finding an apartment, then?" Dean says with a sigh.
Harry just stares at him, unable to process what he's hearing. He can't believe this.
Again Adriana feels as if something is
However, Harry has learned from his mistakes. This time… this time there will not be any kitchen fires, no allergies, no food dropped on the ground,

. It’s the kind of thing he grew up watching his parents doing, and something he’s always wanted for himself. Someone to live with and raise kids with and just... Have a life with. Whatever that life entails.
“Harry! I was beginning to think you’d never use the mirror!” Sirius laughs and then tilts the mirror. “Say hi to Buckbeak, why don’t you!”
It’s a nice fantasy to have, Draco thinks, though he knows that his father likely considers saving his life far more important than saving his reputation. Which, considering how important the Malfoy reputation has always been to Father, is very gratifying, and Draco feels a sort of calming warmth in his chest, despite it all.
Though Harry has his suspicions about Ron and Hermione, if they can just get their act together. So far, they're both to blind to see it. Well, if they ever get married, at least Harry will have some amazing and embarrassing stories to tell during the wedding. That's something to look forward to!
“I'll go talk to my parents.”
Draco feels stunned. He would never have guessed that his attack had so many other crimes hidden behind it.

He has deliberately not thought about Potter and his side. Why should he be thinking about them

As predicted, Adriana's mother agrees to take Draco in. He gets a small room on the tavern's second floor and a small salary in exchange for helping her in the kitchen and Hana behind the bar.
"I—!" Potter stumbles over his words and Draco snorts loudly.
did Harry just say? He cannot
The green glow is visible from far away, and Harry thinks it's some form of faery fire until they get close enough that Draco gasps and stops. The green light comes from a large green crystal that is hovering in the air above some sort of altar. Around it all is a large circle of runes and sigils that reminds Harry of nothing so much as an alchemy circle he's flipped by in a few of his textbooks back at Hogwarts or a "Black Magic" circle from Muggle telly.
"Of course," Draco whispers, and suddenly turns around, reaching his hand out for Harry.
It doesn't stop with the weavers either, the other craftsmen and artisans wants to test him as well... and  just as with the weaving, every pot, every painting, every sculpture... All of it is magnificent.
Potter is insignificant.
Draco has no illusions regarding the fact that his potions business would likely be more profitable and have more clients if he didn’t use his own name and pretended to be someone else. Draco is not, however, willing to make that change and he can get away with not doing it because he doesn’t need to. He’s privileged enough to not need to rely on his business to survive, it’s more of a hobby for him than anything else.
"Draco," she whispers, followed by a string of words and noises he cannot understand.
They cannot be dead and gone, he couldn’t stand it.
at ‘for the rest of our lives’, in which case we really should go into it with similar expectations regarding children, shouldn’t we?”
Draco always did love it when Mother made fun of Father like that… He does so now more than ever, due to the grim turn their lives have taken since the Dark Lord decided to make everyone’s lives much worse by coming back.
The man… the inhuman man is gone? Should be gone.
“Everyone else…?”

“I'll grab some clothes for you from the... from your closet.” Potter says, his voice choked and unnatural.
Draco takes a long sip of his drink and closes his eyes, soaking in the sun. He’s going to make the most of this absolutely
At least they got Teddy out before she joined them. He still can't really believe that she did, despite everything. She lost her husband and daughter and even her son-in-law last time, and Harry wonders if that somehow affected her decision. He wonders if she thinks joining the NMO is somehow going to make sure she doesn't lose anyone this time. Though, arguably, she's already lost everyone, because the rest of her family are part of the Rebellion.
He stops in his tracks, and turns around instantly, letting Draco run into him, even as it tangles their arms together uncomfortably.
he wanted to see: Harry and Ginny Weasley walking arm in arm.
about not telling them the whole truth though.
As Umbridge continues to sputter, Malfoy sends a smirk that’s clearly aimed Harry’s way before he turns back to his breakfast. Harry keeps on staring. Keeps remembering the feeling of Malfoy’s body pressed up against his, and the way he smelled of lavender.
And so the God of the Sun lay the burden of ruling the Heavens on the shoulders of his two friends temporarily and descended down to earth in mortal form, to find his lover and bring him back to the heavens.
Darkness overwhelms him, and Draco disappears into the void. He knows no more.
"Oh, Draco." Harry's voice breaks, and his grip on Draco's hands as he bends over them, tears overflowing, is so hard it nearly hurts.
"Do you know any more stories about the gods? I... I feel so curious, as if there's a part of me that's desperate to know more."
So Malfoy really wasn’t lying. His parents really… Harry almost feels a little bit bad.
“Good thing,” Draco pants in between kisses, “That we have a bed we will be staying in tonight.”
He wishes he’d been wrong. That the truth really had been innocent and he’d just misunderstood that first conversation. He’d wanted to talk to Potter about it, sort it out. But then Potter had cancelled without telling him what it was about and Draco had overheard that second conversation too…
“Because I'm brilliant,” Draco continues, his face looking far more sly now. Harry gets the feeling that Draco is taking the piss out of him, but even so…
Harry takes fierce enjoyment in feeling Draco's fingers dig into his shoulder blades as they cling to each other—desperate to prove to themselves that they're both safe, both unharmed.
Of course, in typical Draco fashion, he lives to subvert Harry's expectations. Just a few minutes later, he comes storming back into the tent carrying something in his hand, his face still thunderous.
a different Harry? Though that does seem unlikely but... Maybe it's someone who's polyjuicing themselves into Harry to trick his friends? But that seems... ludicrous at best. A plan doomed to fail as all it would take is a single conversation between actual Harry and his friends to clear it up...
They have no idea what will happen now, they have no idea how the upcoming fight will go or even what will happen to them, their friends, or the Inferi.
Especially not since that would ultimately be a weak point in his defences if Potter decides to get nasty. Anyone could easily fall victim to the Boy Who Lived’s charms. Draco would really rather not have someone help him break into his apartment. However unwittingly, of course.
Draco smiles and leans in closer, squeezing Harry’s hand. “Were you trying to spoil me?”
Adriana hesitates. That...
. Or his bloody girlfriend. He’ll get
Ron and Hermione are gone, and he's going to have to live with that. But at least he still has Draco with him, right here on the front lines. Right here in the midst of the insanity that is teenagers trying to stop adults who are trying to murder all Muggles, and all muggle-borns, and most half-bloods.
Harry stares at him, not sure what to think about this. Why on Earth is Draco acting as if this is news?
“Okay, good. That fits. That evens the numbers.” Draco nods.
is very obsessed with Hogwarts. And especially the idea that he is related to Slytherin, as one of the Founders. I mean, he is, I think, but he's obsessed with the idea of it.”
He forces his eyes open to find his vision swimming. He can barely make out the face of someone with pale skin and hair before he involuntarily closes them again. Fuck.
Of course, he’s actually quite glad they did all of it, because it seems their turn against the Dark Lord during the final battle and the very real positive effects that had for Potter’s side seems to have helped them quite substantially to go free with only minimum of damages.
It… It doesn’t make sense.
Draco immediately takes that back. Bloody Lovegood and her made-up creatures.
“So what?” Draco turns his face away. “I don’t care what you
“Draco, please…”
Draco snort. “Well there’s an idea.”
He doesn’t have much hope for the last one, it’s not like he’s taken any N.E.W.T.s and he doubts anyone is in any hurry to offer him a job or a place in society anytime soon.
“Should we destroy it entirely, or do you think there's some other way we can do this?”
"How is that even possible?" Pansy demands.
Malfoy has a few pale smattering of freckles across his nose—like stars.
The thought of looking into a mirror, the thought of looking at
He hadn’t realised how bad it had gotten until now that the oppressive feeling of the darkness is gone. Now that he feels like he can
“You're lying.”
“Do you think so? It would be very helpful for us if there were more of us than just the two of us, right?”
“When Allison came back, gravely injured... I was so worried, Harry. I hate that you have to leave, but even more than that, I hate that I'm not there to watch your back.” Draco's voice trembles, just slightly, and Harry knows how deeply affected his husband is by all of it. It's not safe for Draco to leave, even less so than it is for most people—both due to his status as a healer and as Harry Potter's husband.
how much effort it’s take to keep their stupid little heads out of trouble.
But the threat—for the secret of the God Killer was hidden away from everyone but the God Wisher himself—still led to a full scale war in the heavens. A war that threatened to destroy all the gods and the earth as well.
wanted to tell everyone about us yet, so I... I wanted to keep it secret."
He cannot speak, neither can the small furry creature... But he understands it anyway.
boys. It's... it's true, after all, even if it's not what's actually causing his distress.
Draco’s friends and family immediately jump into action.
He turns over on his side, ignores his straining erection and tries desperately to think about something else. Tries desperately to fall back asleep.
Even though Malfoy is a bloody jerk with a Death Eater father.
He has no memory of taking the ring out from under that pillow.
Blaise sighs.
that this is the truth of it all.

“No chance of that, you git,” Harry says and shakes his head, before he presses another soft kiss to Draco’s lips.
Harry shakes his head. "It's not
The feeling of Draco’s long fingers digging into his shoulders is grounding, and just what he needs as a gust of wind blows the smoke away just enough for Harry to see the grotesque visages of the Inferi haunting their steps.
He turns his head to find his parents sitting in two armchairs nearby. He wonders if they're crying.
It’s just too much to deal with. Too much to accept that he will have to live with for the rest of his life.
When he curls up in his armchair, or on the sofa, or in the grass, or in the bed, the small furry creature curls up with him. He wonders what it is, he wonders why it follows him...
By the time they’re out of tea, their program is over and Harry is stretching his arms over his head.
Some days, they herd him out on the grounds. Sometimes, his father sits him down by the pond and curls around him, talking and talking.
The French Villa on the Riviera is, as always, spectacular.
"What do we need to do to... To change things? To fix it, I mean."
smell like lavender, right? It must have been a lotion or something.
He wants to leave something behind for these people, for all of them who love him so much and suffer so much in the face of his pain and untimely demise.
"Seeing Malfoy sneer would scare anyone out of their dream with that pointy face of his." Ron's grin is wicked, and Harry quickly joins him in laughing.
Draco nods. “If you're worrying about what the horcrux tried to scare me with... Don't. I don't want to be the same sort of friend to you that Ron and Hermione are anyway. Unless you want to kiss them too.”
“Of course…” he murmurs, running his fingers down Harry’s arm. Oh Merlin, Draco is so gone on this man. Truly, it’s ludicrous.
dark magic which is difficult to cast and even harder to control, so we really shouldn't be messing with it.
He knows they worry, and they deserve better than that. Especially his mother.
Besides, does it matter if they lose it? Is not like they can destroy it anyway.
“Well, actually, before we do
And then…
He doesn't think he can survive it a second time.
Of course, they’re labouring under the impression that Draco hasn’t had any sex for months, and as he’s still not ready to explain his whole failed relationship with Potter, he can’t disabuse them of the notion.
didn’t make Draco terribly allergic to grapefruits. The geese… okay, that was kind of on Harry.
A soft knock on the door startles Draco out of his downwards spiralling thoughts. He stares at the door, waiting and saying nothing. Trying to keep his strained breathing so low whoever is on the other side of the door might even think he’s not even inside.
“Yeah, like
“But it’s a shame that no one listened to you, isn’t it, Parkinson? Because with all of us gone, maybe you could finally feel competent for once in your life,” another one added with a sneer.
“But the real question is,” Pansy’s tone turns serious. “If the two of you kiss, and you realize that he doesn’t like you like that, would you be okay? Would you be able to take that outcome and move on with your life?”
“Draco…?”
into detention now?”
But something wasn’t right. This wasn’t him. Draco took in a deep breath and pressed his lips together in concentration, trying to recall his memories from the day before. What was the last thing he remembered?
, for once. And I knew that I’d found the person I’d always hoped to find.”
, Potter,” Draco gritted his teeth. “Savage much?”
Potter turns his attention to him then, a questioning look in his bright eyes, as if
A green light shone at the back of Draco’s eyelids as the flames in the fireplace flared to life, dragging him out of his sweet sleepy haze. And a moment later, in a quiet whisper came Harry’s voice.
Suddenly, Draco can’t take it anymore. He grits his teeth, stands up and throws his backpack over his shoulder. “I’m fine, Pansy. I don’t need a distraction.”
Draco shrugged. “It wasn’t hard to guess that you probably wouldn’t want someone like me anywhere near your godson,”
, Draco had
Potter takes a step forward. He’s so close now that the cool scent of him is wrapping itself around Draco, filling his lungs and making the thin hairs on his arms stand up in a light shiver. “Do I look like I’m joking?” He deadpans, looking down at Draco.
. How could Draco have forgotten that? “
He blinked his eyes open and sat up, opening his mouth to tell the person off, only to come face to face with… “Potter?”
The fingers of Potter’s right hand are running through his hair now, and his tongue is roaming around in Draco’s mouth, wrapping around Draco’s own and exploring his teeth. Potter kisses like he flies. Like he brings down dark lords and like he duels Death-Eaters. He is determined and graceful and from the very first moment, you know that he was born for this. Draco isn’t surprised.
He was in quite a lot of pain. His chest was on fire and every breath felt like a challenge.
“Welcome to Eighth-Year exclusive game of Quidditch, Gryffinpuff versus Slytherclaw!” said Ginny Weasley who was providing commentary. “Hey, I’m the one holding the megaphone, so I get to choose the names. It’s a dictatorship!” she added in response to the surge of “boos” and protests rising from the audience.
“I should have been there for you, Pans,” Draco said, trying to blink away his tears so he could look her in the eyes properly when he said it. “I’m sorry.”
“Please, Harry. Just…
And Draco knew that life was going to have its ups and downs for him, it wasn’t going to stay like this forever. He knew that there were going to be moments, hours, or days in the future that the happiness would fade away, or even completely vanish. But he had Harry by his side, his presence a sure and steady weight holding Draco in place as the storm passed, and they would survive those days together.
“What?” Draco fought not to show his surprise. “But I’m supposed to wait with the rest of my team,”
“It wouldn’t have,” Draco said in a soothing voice. “Do you think I’d have married you if you’d decided to become an Auror? I’d have made you choose, Potter. I’d’ve made it cost you.”
He had been a selfish bastard in the past months (and maybe long before that, if he was being honest with himself) and a horrible friend. Draco had let himself be carried away from everyone and everything by the force of his guilt and sorrow. He had let himself sink further and further in the ocean of his regrets and self-pity, and become a soulless corporality of all the negative emotions in the universe.
“Malfoy.” Potter was frowning now, looking even more annoyed.
“I don’t care.” Draco squirmed, trying to free his hands from Potter’s unyielding grip.
“She didn’t deserve to die like that. She was
“He’ll be fine. No, just stay right where you are.” Harry answered, tightening his arms around Draco’s waist. His voice was muffled by Draco’s fluffy lilac hoodie.
“Malfoy, are you hurt?” he asked, green eyes searching Draco’s face in concern.
Draco let out a breath that he felt like he’d been holding for eleven days – or maybe a lot longer, he wasn’t sure – and took Potters warm, steady hand into his own cold, trembling one.
“No, no it’s…” Draco ran a hand across his face in frustration. So he was still a war criminal, and the son of a war criminal,
And he also very much likes to kiss Potter at least once. Who cares if Potter doesn’t want that? Not everything is about that handsome prick. It’s just one kiss.
Goyle’s tiny eyes light up with glee. “Pans said she’d get me a whole apple pie from the kitchens if I stay here and wait for you. Get in, then. Don’t leave her hangin’.”
“I didn’t…” Potter snapped, frustrated. “Malfoy, I didn’t assume you were up to something evil, okay? I was just bloody
, to complement his family tradition of naming the children after constellations. Harry had almost given up – his argument of
“So …” Harry cleared his throat. “You just vanished yesterday,”
Draco felt a pang of stinging pain at the sight, like a small knife stabbing him right through the heart. He bit the inside of his cheek hard and kept quiet. He had been so caught up in his own petty world, building thick walls of guilt and self-pity around himself and shutting everyone else out, that he hadn’t even realized that Pansy – his best friend who had always been there for him no matter what – might be struggling with the same things. How could he have been so ignorant? So oblivious?
Draco shook his head with disappointment, reminding himself that this was clearly the same girl who’d named her brother’s poor owl
Draco had wanted to say.
Draco could do that. He was brave enough, he had to be. He …
,” Pansy said, rolling her own glassy eyes at him. “Besides, as someone who’s known you my entire life, my expectations were pretty low to begin with!”
“The Slytherclaw Chaser, Theodore Nott, is now holding the Quaffle which he literally picked up from the ground. I’m not sure how I feel about that but let’s go easy on these people. He’s heading for the Gryffinpuff goalposts – yeah, good luck with that! – sorry! – and we have Susan Bones and Justin Finch-Fletchley right at his tail – he AIMS, SHOOTS, and … well, Ronald Weasley easily catches the Quaffle with one hand which was … predictable.”
“About what?” Draco asked, busying himself with pulling a black jacket out of his duffle bag.
Potter had asked him that morning.
“I think I know why you never stand up to Ernie or any of your other bullies,” Potter crossed his long arms over his chest. “It’s because you feel like you don’t deserve to fight back. Isn’t it, Malfoy?”
“Just tell me how he is doing. Where is he? Where’s my mother?” Draco asked desperately.
“Fine, you’re right; I did it on purpose,” Draco made himself admit. “I needed to talk to you and I thought this would be a good opportunity.” He felt his cheeks heat slightly as he looked down at the floor.
, Malfoy?”
Draco opened his mouth to say something, anything; but he was absolutely speechless. He gave up at last, returning Potter’s smile with one of his own that he was surprised to find genuine.
!” Pansy phonated a few seconds later in an attempt to lighten the mood. Draco finally looked away from where his empty gaze was sewn to the spot Potter had been standing on, back to her. Pansy quickly bushed away a tear from her left cheek, but Draco had already seen it.
Pansy rolls her eyes at him, clearly giving up on the subject. “Are you sure you don’t wanna come? You can tag along with us if you want to. Or you can hang out with Blaise and the others.”
The gryffindor crowd is, per usual, seated by the hearth in the eighth year common room. Granger and Weasely are sharing a couch, grossly entwined with her head on his shoulder and his arms around her slight figure. Finnigan is on the floor, gesturing wildly as he tells some story about his father as a child. Longbottom is leaning against a wall, cradling a pot of plant in his hands and Thomas is talking to one of the Patil twins; the one that Potter took to the Yule Ball back in their fourth year and annoyed the
“Don’t you think I might have liked it more if you’d let me catch it myself, Potter?”
“Catch,” Potter said, and threw him something that flashed gold in the air before Draco closed his pale fingers around it. “I caught it for you, it’s yours.”
“You say that every day,” Draco rolled his eyes good-naturedly.
So it was up to Draco to help with these kinds of things while he still could. In two days, Draco too would leave that ghost house behind.
When he turns back his head, every pair of eyes in the classroom is on him, including Potter’s. There aren’t many people inside – most of the eighth year students still haven’t made it there somehow – but considering what he’s expecting, even that much attention is more than enough to give him a rising sense of internal panic.
“I swear to
Draco had thought about that too, but he couldn’t bring himself to actually ask Harry about it.
Walking out of the Great Hall with Blaise and Pansy that night after dinner, Draco’s eyes slid to a head of messy black locks still sitting at the Gryffindor table with an arm around the Weasley-girl’s shoulders.
. What are you talking about? You’re not going to lose me.” He chanted as he held Draco – now visibly shaking with the force of his panic – in a tight embrace. “I’m never walking away, Draco. I promise. You’re not gonna lose me.”
Draco nodded, swaying on his feet.
“Well, I wasn’t,” Draco snapped, not able to stop himself. “And I didn’t think you’d notice anyway, since you were so busy making gross little public displays of affection with your

? Draco hurriedly picked up the copy and stared – with utter mortification – at the picture of the two of them on the front page.
“How brave of you,” She smiled. “But aren’t you tired of having to risk your life for other people? Don’t you think you’re being unfair to yourself by choosing it yet again?” she said, her voice laced with concern.
Something about the ring caught Draco’s attention and when he took a closer look, he saw that instead of a gem, the bezel was holding a single drop of a shining purple liquid – one that Draco had never seen before – inside the glazed solitaire.
, Draco looked
“Please, Harry,” Draco pulled his mouth away, throwing his head back. “Just fuck me already,”
Draco frowns at that. “Yeah, I guess that would be good. Hypothetically.”
“Nothing,” the first girl answered, sending Potter a smug look and brushing her long hair behind one ear suggestively. “We’re just teaching these two a lesson.”
“For Merlin’s sake.” Draco mutters under his breath as he rereads the same line of his potions book for the nth time, desperately trying – and failing – to keep his attention on those simple words written on the pages in front of him and not on the stupid, awful, utterly ridiculous, absolutely fucking gorgeous dark-haired man comfortably sprawled on a couch just a few paces away from him.

him knowing that he wants to do it. Potter and his ridiculous sense of honor and integrity. Now Draco has no choice but to say no and ruin the whole thing.
The group of students let out a scornful laugh.

Draco’s eyes widened. He must have heard Granger wrong. Surely she couldn’t mean
The two of them ran back to the castle and then up the stairs all the way to the seventh floor, not slowing down for a second. When they got to the seventh floor, Harry finally came to a stop in front of the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy – now snoring loudly in his sleep.
Later that night, they danced to the rhythm of the Wicked Sisters’ latest song with all of their friends, cheered and sang along with Pansy as she performed one of Celestina Warbeck’s most famous songs on the stage near the Slytherin’s statue, and shared lingering kisses laced with the taste of Firewhiskey in one dark corner of the room, and
“Oh, Draco,” she said endearingly, putting a hand over her heart “You look amazing,”

Draco hadn’t realized that he’d stopped breathing while Borgin was talking. There was no other option, Draco
no,” Potter scratched the back of his neck sheepishly. “Actually, I’d hoped you’d come visit him. It’s just… I want Teddy to have a big family and grow up around people who’d love and care for him,” he looked away from Draco, swallowing. “Since… I know how it feels to be lonely as a kid and I don’t want that for Teddy.”
“Alright everyone, listen up,” Terry Boot started as the rest of the team settled down inside the Ravenclaw locker room. “Since Captain Goyle doesn’t like giving speeches, it’s up to me to give you people some motivational talk,”
Draco didn’t know.
“A single drop of the Sweet Agony gives the person who consumes it the ability to live a single day of their life in an alternate reality. A reality in which they’d made different choices and took a different path. One they’d be the happiest version of themselves in.” Borgin’s eyes had an evil spark in them, making him look even more sneaky than usual. “That’s a very tempting concept, isn’t it? But the thing is, the consequences of this potion can also be grave. The few people who’d ever had the chance to try it are all believed to have gone insane. Most of them would commit suicide shortly after they’d come back, claiming they couldn’t bear to continue on living their real lives any longer. That is why the creator decided to destroy the recipe once and for all.”
“Oh, good morning Harry!” Granger looked up from her copy of the Daily Prophet with a nervous-looking smile. “Malfoy.” She acknowledged Draco politely.
“It’s none of your business, Potter,” Draco turned away, heart hammering in his chest, and picked up the first thing he could find – which was a large bottle of dragon blood – and busied himself with dusting it so he’d have something else to look at instead of Potter’s face.
“What is it, Mione?” Potter asked, seeing right through Grangers futile efforts to look nonchalant.
Draco had always been good in suppressing his emotions and denying essential parts of himself; that was why he’d mastered Occlumency so easily. But now that he had let himself love and be loved for the first time in maybe ever, it was like seeing a ray of sunlight after living a lifetime in stark darkness. And the emptiness it left Draco with when it was snatched back from his grip was a permanent ache.
” Draco swallowed, trying to process this unexpected piece of information and what it could mean for Draco.
let into this school in the first place,” he jabbed the tip of his wand in Draco’s cheek. “I watched her die. I loved her, and I didn’t even get to tell her that before I lost her for good,” he hissed through gritted teeth, a teardrop escaping the corner of his eye. “Do you have any idea what that’s like? And now I have to sit and watch as you walk around the school like nothing’s ever happened, when she’s lying under six feet of cold dirt and I’ll never get to see her again.”
“Draco,” Harry groaned, and he too, climaxed inside him with Draco’s name on his lips.
???” Draco shouted, eyes wide with horror and head steaming with sudden anger. “Fucking
where it rightfully belongs.”
“See, I told you,” Potter grinned, putting on his own jumper.
Sitting at the eighth years’ table inside the Great Hall, as Draco slowly forces sip after sip of orange juice down his throat, he is looking anywhere but at Potter – just like he’s managed to do for the entirety of the past week since they so unprofessionally sucked faces in front of the whole eighth year student body.
“Draco,”
Draco exhaled sharply.
,” said Draco, much to Weasley’s further delight. “And absolutely unfair! Our keeper kept running away from the Quaffle instead of trying to catch it,”
And some other places.
It’s 10:55.
“It always feels better when we talk,” he said. “Like all the misery gets sucked out of my body.”
out of Draco.
?” He rolled up his sleeve and ripped his leather wristband off, exposing the faded Dark Mark on his left arm.
They were quiet again. Harry’s clothes smelled like Healing Potions and hand sanitizers and a long day spent in a hospital attending to patients.
Draco had joined the team more than a month later than the others, and by then, the captain had already been chosen. And since he and Greg were the only ones on the team who had actually played Quidditch before, Greg was now their captain.
“But I keep failing them, Draco,” Harry closed his eyes and drew his eyebrows together. “Some of them die and there’s nothing I can do for them.”

So apparently, there had been a mistake in the timeline and according to the original story, Eighth Year would have happened in 1998 not '97, so I fixed the timeline.  (sorry about that and many thanks to
, Potter!” Draco broke the kiss. “Give me a minute to recover, will you?”
“She’s not alone,” Draco said, coming forward to stand beside Pansy with his wand in his hand.
Potter’s green gaze caught Draco’s for a moment – an abstruse look in his eyes – before he broke the eye contact and turned around, leaving the two perplexed Slytherins behind without another word.
. Although how did I know about the door? Was it even real? Looking back it was the only part of the dream that seemed real. I’m sure it didn’t exist, but I decided to look tomorrow anyway just to be sure. I couldn’t have that room be real and not use it.
Draco managed to speak first, "Buying book for Hogwarts..." Riddles eyes widened slightly before he composed himself.
When I finished he nodded, "I know a place through my father in Knockturn Alley that can give us fake identities, that way we might be able to get into Hogwarts and use their library and Room of Requirement. I'm sure the room can give us more books should we need them or, at the very least, give up a quiet place to study and read."
"Yeah, we just got our letter a few days ago. Any tips?" Although I didn't mean to, my words came out more hostile then I wanted. With a look from Draco I knew it was noticeable.
I grinned, “Yeah, how ‘bout it?”
Unless I find a way home myself? I'm Harry Potter, I've done worse, even though I have no idea where to look, "Wait. What does Hermione do?"
I remembered running through the Department of Mysteries...magical objects falling from shelves around us...a glint of gold...and an explosion. Then nothing. I don't remember how I got here, I just woke up and wandered around the Department before finding my way out. I used the invisibility cloak so I wouldn't be spotted after finding everything different then how I remember the Department and the Ministry itself being. Only after stumbling across The Daily Prophet did I realize what happen. That glint of gold must have been a time turner, and extremely powerful one if it took me back this far...But how to get back? I couldn't just go to the Ministry, they'll think I'm crazy...I made my way back to the Department of Mysteries in case I could find anything that could help.
Now that Harry has gotten more involved, how will he fair?
I shrugged, “What’s there to go back to really? No parents and an abusive family? Friends who don’t listen? Dumbledor trying to shove this whole ‘chosen one’ thing down my throat? What about you? Do you really want to go back to a family who loves someone so evil and vile over their son? None of my friends, except the twins, accept you. I hate that it’s true but it is. Plus we have a chance to change the future. I mean I didn’t mean to fall in love with Tom Riddle, but if we manage to keep him away from the dark arts then Voldemort never becomes real!”
I felt confused, "Why not change my hair?"
I slid into the bathroom and locked the door, not caring if anyone else had to use it. I needed to cum so bad it hurt. As expected when I pulled my dick out it was an angry red. I sighed in relief when I felt some friction. I usually wouldn’t do this, too unseemly, but I really couldn’t help it. All of the kisses drove me crazy. Draco was so sweet when he kissed, pouring his affection into each touch and swipe of the tongue. Harry was a little rougher and had even bit my lip more than a few times, and yet he managed to remain gentle.
Draco walked in early one morning and grinned at me, his face lit up and the letters in his hands, "We got them! Our letters!"
So, first chapter what did you think?
I pretended to think over his question, "Then ask away, although I don't know what you are trying to accomplish here. You appear to want to 'get to know me' and yet you have insulted me and keep getting into fights with my friend." Not the best way to phrase it, but I digress.
Draco flushed, "I just don't think you could pull off blonde hair." I laughed as he look away in embarrassment. After a few minutes of planning we got to work. Draco did most of the work, since he was better at transfiguration then I was. He lengthened his hair till it reached past him ears and darkened the color to a dirty blonde. Ultimately we decided to lighten up my hair and give it a hue of light browns throughout, while doing the same to his only instead giving it a reddish tint. When we were finished Draco had strawberry dirty blonde hair and I had very dark dirty blonde hair, and he changed his eyes to a light brown. With the added freckles to Draco's face we finished. At first I was worried about our underage age magic being detected until Draco told me of the magical wards protecting this Department. We couldn't do magic outside of here, but inside we could.
And we're back again, hello nice to see ya'll whether it be again or just now. I hope you guys like this, I worked really hard to make sure that their first day is the absolute best!
"Well," He had a raspy voice, "What can you offer?" Draco muttered and passed him a magical object we stole from a women a few doors down. The object itself made the air cold at its reveal. The man inspected it and his smile began to grow, "I'll accept. Now, do you have wands? Good, good. You have any specifics you want to include? Speak now." I let Draco handle the story, he was better at this then I was. As they worked I looked around the shop in nervous wonder. The place was filled with strange objects, some seemed innocent while others made me wish to never come back. I hoped we never will.
“I know. Me too, but we can be happy here. Why not stay?” Draco nodded stiffly and started putting books in stacks. I followed suit, holding them out when he was ready to float them to their shelves.
WARNING: VERY INSENSE SMUT. PLEASE BE WARNED.
I licked my lips, “Am I finally allowed to do something more than look?” I prayed to Merlin that the answer was yes.
to be angry about it.
“Are you alright? You didn’t get hurt, did you?” Draco’s voice is soft, the way it only ever is when Harry’s upset and what he’s upset about
He feels better when he finally settles on that. There's no point in feeling weird and guilty about it, because they're just dreams.
He curls over on his side just as the tears finally break free from behind his closed eyelids, sliding down the side of his face, over the bridge of his nose, down into the pillow his head rests on. He wants to fall back asleep immediately, completely fade away, and only wake again when the people he loves are back with him.
Harry least of all.
hurt like a slicing hex to the spine. He’s not used to be so easily used and discarded… Only one person has ever treated him or his parents like that before, and considering that was the literal self-professed Dark Lord…
It's unfair, so very unfair.
“You what?” His throat feels tight, and anger is starting to swell besides the hurt. What gives Potter the right to come here and do whatever he feels like? Draco promised to keep quiet, didn’t he?
Going away for a trip with his friends is
She has looked up at the night sky since childhood, stared at the empty black void above them and wondered what it must have been like when the stars lit up the sky with their gentle glow.
But they too are faded, like a photograph that has lost its magic and is slowly starting to erase itself off its parchment.
Or the delusional.
That his friends are being so supportive just makes him feel
Harry chokes. He pats down his pocket, and then his other pocket and then the shirt pocket at his breast.

Especially not since he’s got no doubt that there’s more to Snape than he knows, and he’s not sure he wants to know those hidden depths. Because if it turns out that he never cared for Draco at all, that he only ever did everything on Dumbledore’s orders or something like that…
If he forgets that the little furry creature's name is Cassiopeia, will that veil fall over the world again? Will it all grow even hazier? If he loses a name he's gained, what will happen? Perhaps he'll stop functioning entirely.
“Draco!” Potter hurries after Draco, but he’s not stopping. He needs to change, because he cannot handle being so exposed, both literally and figuratively, in front of Potter right now.
Next time

Merlin, is Potter crying? In front of all of them?

The next time Harry wakes up it's to Ron shaking his shoulder.

“Oh Merlin, you told my parents…”
was the one to teach him Occlumency in the first place. Did Bellatrix deliberately teach him something incorrectly to cause him harm?
“How?” Sometimes Harry really doesn't understand Draco's relationship with his parents. Or really Draco's parents’ take on childcare and magic in general. They seem very blasé about the kind of shit Draco gets into—as long as he doesn't get hurt that is.
“What the fuck?” Rabastan Lestrange calls out, and then…
"Too many people invite Nargles, and there's no chance of a good discussion then."
notice that something is wrong.
Ron shakes his head. "Nah, but we managed to trace it to an apothecary where it had been sold just around the time of the attack. Except, uh, it had been reported as stolen, which is why we checked it out first."
“An Other is like…” Weasley stumbles over the explanation.
Mother becomes a sort of go-between, though more of the management type than the messenger one. She flits in and out between the healers at St. Mungo's, Father and Hermione in whatever library they're currently holed up in, and the Auror Department and DMLE. She also ensures that she spends most of her days with Draco—she neither wants him to be lonely, nor miss any precious little time they have left.
Harry groans and returns both his glasses and his wand to the nightstand.
Travel at sea has become much more treacherous since the stars were lost, Old Tobias would say. They used to be a seaman's guide at night, one of the most easy and clear tools for navigation on the ocean.
"Potter," he sneers as he moves past Harry without looking back. Instead he moves to the large bed and...

The man smiles. "I can tell you recognise that description. I'm not surprised, he stands out. And he's so very hard to forget."
“Darling...” Mother’s voice is soft as she speaks, and Draco only barely suppressed the flinch. He can tell that she wants him to do it, to take this leap of faith.
As they stand there chest to chest, Draco rubs his nose against Harry's, a silly little sign of affection he enjoys.
If Voldemort had just been gone, dead and dust, no one would be happier than Harry. He's lost enough people to that maniac to even want to consider another war. Especially since Voldemort seems to be
The fact that he's on the same side as Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy, and on the opposite side from Andromeda Tonks, is probably among the worst and weirdest things about this whole thing. He still can't believe that Andromeda sided with the New Magic Order.

Weasley mutters something, but Granger just elbows him in the side. If there’s something Draco hasn’t looked forward to regarding the idea of coming clean, it’s spending time with Weasley as a consequence.

All in all, Harry's feeling really good about it (especially since he knows that he won't get turned down; Draco and Pansy had a long conversation regarding weddings and their intendeds just last week that Harry luckily happened to overhear).
His memories shattering like a dropped mirror.
Draco sighs in contentment as Harry wraps his arm around his shoulder and pulls him even closer on the sofa. It’s simply… lovely.
Neville actually laughs. “Yeah. His statement literally calls them out for printing Ministry sponsored propaganda against Harry, who he reminds everyone
When Sirius’s face appears in the mirror, unharmed and smiling, Harry nearly cries.
Actually, he should probably check in with his parents about using the Villa first. If
“Did you lot really think that the Demoiselle Crane Patronus that warned you about Umbridge and the Inquisitorial Squad coming for your little group manifested out of nowhere?” He raises an eyebrow at them. “Or perhaps you thought Edgecomb sent it as an apology for ratting you out in the first place?”
The lush gardens surrounding it and the large pool truly is a sight to behold. This is where Draco first learned how to swim, as the Manor held no such opportunities. Wiltshire is landlocked, and there are no
“So no Death Eaters, then?”
"I can't... I don't... I don't
"Harry..." Draco repeats the name, and his expression suddenly seems far away, as if he's entirely lost in thought at the mere sound of the name.
It’s all just too convenient.
But if they haven’t… If they wouldn’t…
When he finally finds the mirror, he nearly drops it in his haste, but catches it at the last second.
“I thought… Your moods were getting worse.” There’s a scratching sound, as if Potter is dragging his nails against those terrible Muggle trousers he always insisted on wearing. “You seemed less and less happy, more and more lethargic… And it was always worse after you’d seen my friends, or I’d seen yours. And we fought and got into silly and petty arguments so often.”
He clutches his wand even tighter and focuses on keeping his breathing even, focuses on not allowing himself to hyperventilate.
With their plan of attack finished, their next step is to sneak back onto the walkways so Draco can get a better look at the Rune and glyph placements. After all, it's not like Draco is going to be able to reverse the whole thing on the fly. they're going to need to plan it just a bit, take some time to do it before they set the whole thing in motion.
Most of all he hates the Ministry for actively covering things up and painting him as a liar.
He feels the warm brush of the Villa’s magic rush over him—contentment, pleasure. It’s
Flowers in a vase, lit candles…
He compartmentalised everything, hid away pieces of himself behind ever more complex Occlumency just to make sure he managed to survive. He divided himself into bits inside his own head, numbed himself to the trauma, fear, and agony, even as the war ramped up.

This man is looking for Draco! Why is he... Is he someone Draco knows?
will be able to cherish it, and place Draco’s among all the other Malfoy weddings across the centuries—despite… Despite.
Harry they’re talking about. Harry
The sooner Draco's finished, the sooner Harry will have backup for when the Herders come back. They're both under disillusion spells, and Harry has made Draco wear the Invisibility Cloak this time. Considering how much Draco needs to move to change the magic circle, a disillusion spell might not be able to hold up if the Herders come back and look for them.
"Because he couldn't tell anyone what they'd been used in… though usually he would just have reported it as
“Yes… He refused to leave, said he needs to tell you some things he should have told you before… We stopped him before he could explain any more than that, though.”
Cassiopeia is instantly alert, caterwauling loudly as it jumps off the bed and starts moving around his legs.
“Quite,” Draco says, keeping his eyes firmly shut. “I happened to hear your voices as I neared the door.” He continues into the room, counting the steps slowly and carefully until he makes it to one of the sofas, where he carefully takes a seat—relieved that he hasn’t accidentally sat down in someone’s lap.
"Really?" Harry gapes, hardly able to believe it. It sounds absolutely too good to be true, even though Grimmauld Place is far from a nice place to stay overall.
The last few weeks are terrible.
"Do you think we could set up Apparation points and call for backup?"
And then he wanders again.
have unless we try?”
"I assume the crystal's doing it."
The world fluctuates, sharpens and fades in turn.
He loves these people so much, and even though this whole thing has been awful and terrible in so many ways… he's been reminded of why he loves them, and he's felt their love for him in turn. He doesn't think that he would want to have these months undone. Dying had been awful, depressing, and terrible… but it's also taught him things he'll never forget.
He places both of them on a tray to carry it out into the dining room with a bit of flair…
So… So his parents were here? They… They haven’t abandoned him?
“Draco… I’m sorry. But it’s all a misunderstanding, love.”
cried, so
Oh by everything in the cosmos.
And Draco had thought Harry wasn’t the spoiling type. Clearly he’s been wrong about a lot of things lately. All the more fool is he.
Adriana's mother freezes and her eyes turn suspicious.
“Excellent,” he says, without really thinking it’s especially excellent at all. “If I come back at… 6pm, could you have prepared your most comfortable armchairs? You don’t need to take the price into consideration.”
For the briefest of moments, Harry considers just blurting the words out. Considers just asking Draco right here and now—surrounded by scared strangers, people trying to put out a fire, and standing in front of the scene of their favourite restaurant going up in flames—damn all the plans and how special he wanted to make the proposal. But Draco shivers in his arms, and Harry remembers that he still doesn’t do well with uncontrolled fires… and the end of the war—the Fiendfyre—is the last thing he wants Draco to be thinking about when he proposes.
Strangers come and go, even as he slowly moves through the rooms. Some of them ignore him, too focused on what they are doing—he does not know what it is—but some of them try to talk to him. They make him sit down in the lounge, they talk and talk and talk... They brandish their wands, and he feels their magic wash over his skin like razors.
“Umbridge nearly busted us there, we only got away because of that Patronus warning us… but I don’t think we should have this conversation in the middle of the common room either…” Ron mutters.
And the God Wisher fell, never to properly become a god in his own right, his domains shattered and never formed, and his memory destroyed and tarnished. Unmade by his own weapon as if he had never been.
No wand. No way to protect himself.
But pride and self-preservation demanded he cut his losses and leave. How could he ever hope to find someone and have a future, have
Possibly... But Adriana has no way of knowing if that is a good or a bad thing. After all, Draco has amnesia... and no idea
Even now, months after he first arrived, Adriana hasn't seen him smile even once.
As good as the sex is—and the sex is amazing—a lot of the time, he enjoys just listening to wireless dramas and drinking tea together
Harry shrugs. “I don’t know any of that stuff though, I think you’d need to explain it better for me before I could really… say anything about it.”
He doesn’t want to believe that his parents would do such a thing,
“It’s good to see you awake, Mr Malfoy. I’m Nurse Malbrook. Can you understand me?”
regardless of his sexuality. Ron just looks confused and asks him if that's a big thing with muggles.
The words still make Draco slightly nauseous. He’s been putting off Saturday brunches with his parents for Potter, claiming work engagements, he's moved them to Sunday on occasion but... He's spent some Sundays with Potter too, having wanted to wake up with him too.
Perhaps it was all just payback for how shitty Draco was when they were children. Perhaps the way he and Harry hashed it out was all just a lie, and Potter's been thinking he's the dumbest shit in the world for ever imagining that he or any of his friends would ever forgive Draco for his past. Perhaps this has all just been a long complicated lark at Draco's expense.

killed a Basilisk with it from what you've told me, it should imbued with Basilisk venom and thus—sort of—the capabilities of a Basilisk fang even now, years later. I have no doubt that we would be able to use the Sword of Gryffindor to destroy these horcruxes, if Basilisk venom works. Which I'm sure it does.”
Draco feels very thin as Harry holds him, but the arms that wrap themselves around Harry's neck seem strong at least.
He thought there could be… Perhaps even if Draco hadn’t been deceived, even if Harry’s interest and their relationship had been genuine, they would have ended up breaking over the question of children.
He curls in on himself and tries to sleep again, knowing that he's surrounded by his parents and Cassiopeia. He doesn't want them to leave, he hopes that they never will.
A strong Scourgify hits him, taking the strongly smelling viscous liquid away. It's followed by a vanishing spell so strong but sloppy that it doesn't just take the glass, it also vanishes some of his hair and part of his robes around the neckline and shoulder.

“Nothing seems to be disturbed here, which is a good thing. There's a lot of dust though, and that's likely going to drive the house elves
“Him?”
Nothing.
Ron chokes on air. Or maybe it's spit.
“I think I know exactly how I want to spend that time,” he murmurs against the thin, soft skin of Draco's hand.
Draco finally turns his head and just briefly catches sight of a man who would be handsome if not for the horrific grimace on his face. The man disapparates with a crack, leaving Draco standing still in the middle of the street, still bleeding, clothes and hair ruined, and with the sinking feeling that whatever potion the man threw at him, it only needed that first touch to work, and he vanished it to keep Draco from analysing it to find an antidote.
"Oh!" Hermione's loud squeak catches Ron's attention and he looks up to find her and Parkinson looking into a compartment. They push the door closed and lean against it, glancing at each other.
Adriana has always loved to hear her elders tell stories about the Ancients, about the gods who roam the lands and uphold the natural order of the world.
. Ginny’s been eyeing him weirdly lately, but he doesn’t want to admit to her the complete hash he’s managed to make out of all of this.
“So? How’s the house hunting going, Ginny?” someone says loudly just behind Draco’s head, must be someone in the adjacent booth. The voice seems somewhat familiar, and Draco finds himself listening in. There’s also the fact that… well... Isn’t ‘Ginny’ the name of the female Weasley who also happens to be Harry’s ex-girlfriend? Draco can admit to himself that he can be a bit of a snoop.
There's more to his name than just Draco. He's not

The room is silent except for their harsh breathing, and Harry takes the time to breathe in the scent of Draco's hair, even as it's mostly obscured by the smell of ash and soot. He wishes that things could be better than this.
The nurse laughs and shakes her head.
Perhaps it's some sort of salesman, trying to sell some amazing, new magical item that will revolutionise cleaning or something. Draco doesn't really know what Floo salesmen sell. None of them would ever dare to contact Malfoy Manor with that kind of spiel, after all.
Okay, he probably could be

He just curls in on himself further, not caring that whoever that was didn’t expect him to be awake. Not that he
He wonders what food used to taste like. He knows, in his clearer moments when everything is less fuzzy around the edges, that he used to like certain tastes. He wonders what they were... He wonders what they tasted like.
Harry used to think he wanted and needed someone like Ginny, but they’d realised fairly quickly after the war that they made better friends and siblings than they did a romantic couple. He doesn’t regret the relationship they had, though, because Harry loves Ginny and they both learned a lot about themselves through it—like the fact that Ginny doesn’t want children, but Harry absolutely does. If they’d stayed together, one of them would have needed to compromise. Harry sometimes wonders how well that would have worked out for them.
He won’t live long enough to turn 23.
The man regards her for a long moment, a smile ever present on his lips, before he continues talking. "I'm looking for someone. If I describe them to you, would you tell me if you have seen them?" He glances away then, and a sad expression flits across his face. "I've been looking for them for a long time."
The nature around them is amazing, and Draco is watching it with avid interest, barely able to take his eyes off it. They’re only on a short vacation, so they definitely have to find as much enjoyment as they possibly can in just the few days they have… and Harry is
He pats the sofa next to him and watches as Harry lights up like a small child on Christmas before he makes his way over and sits down. They're pressed together all along their sides—Harry has never cared much for personal space—and Draco can smell him. It’s as if they’re right back to where they were on Thursday evening, pressed together and listening to their wireless drama.
He looks up from his plate and his parents are... He thinks they're both smiling and crying. He doesn't know why anyone would smile and cry at the same time... But he thinks his parents are doing that anyway.
He has no idea if this is common for people who suffer the loss of their Other, he only remembers hearing about them losing colour vision not… not whatever was going on with him.
Voldemort won't even know what hit him.
In the middle of the room is a large four-poster bed, with a tester decked out with gold and posh looking green curtains hanging from it. It's the most expensive looking bed Harry has ever seen in his life.
They rebuffed him, pleased with the power and domains they already ruled—unwilling to bend down before this new god who clearly would make far more demands of them than the God of the Sun ever had.
"Somehow I remember him as being smarter than this," Weasley mutters, probably in an attempted whisper.
Harry doesn't think he cares about Malfoy's parents. He's hated Lucius Malfoy for years after all, but... They saved Harry and his friends now, didn't they? Of course, Sirius might contact Harry through the mirror tomorrow and tell him that it was all a ruse, but that seems unlikely.

Harry wakes up again.
And then, one day almost a year after the day Draco arrived, a stranger enters the village boundaries.

idea, and Draco’s sure they’re hard at work to get that political red tape all sorted.
“Don't say it! We don't know if he's managed to place a taboo on his name so he knows when people say it. There are spells like that, they're old and not easy to pull off but... He has enough people on his side but he probably can do it. Let's not invite trouble, Harry.” Draco looks pale, and he doesn't move his hand from Harry’s face.
“He lied?” Harry can feel traitorous hope build in his chest. If Kreacher lied, then… “I don’t believe you.”
Kreacher lied.

“Point me Harry Potter,” he whispers, and watches as his wand spins in his hand. Noting the direction, he sets off again.

They seem to be alone, and there doesn't seem to be any Inferi nearby... So there's a chance that they can deal with this without getting caught.
He's being dramatic and he knows it, but he can't help himself.
"Adriana!"
Harry laughs softly. “I am not letting you go near one from now on.” He pauses, and glances away. “As much as I love you, I’m still making you explain things to Mipsy. She’s going to be distraught.”
Harry nods his head slowly. Going to Malfoy Manor is probably a bad idea, but at this point... what else can they do?
the only one to return walking on his own two legs.
Harry knows he can get this whole thing together, knows he can make Draco the happiest man alive—Harry will even agree to some of the more outlandish wedding ideas Draco will no doubt come up with just to make him happy—he just needs to manage to finally propose.

A white paw bats against the ring box so suddenly Harry nearly drops it.

with Draco Malfoy, his childhood enemy. Draco’s going to be sick, he’s going to throw up and scream and cry…
He collapses on one of the sofas in the main lounge, fearful and trembling. Cassiopeia puts itself on his chest, yowling loudly, but Draco’s hands shake too much to pet it, his arms are too weak for him to hold them aloft for long.
He stops right at the side of the bed, looking down at the entirely naked Malfoy, suddenly acutely aware that he's fully dressed himself.
It’s as if he’s missing something.

Speaking to him is Draco's mother, and Draco's father just came into the room... Because
Turning to her, Draco sees her push her sunglasses up on her forehead as she sits up properly swinging her legs over the side of the reclining chair. Blaise suddenly gets up from his own chair on her other side and takes a seat next to her.
Seeing their tears and pain is almost enough for him to want to die alone, without anyone else there to watch. Without anyone else there to be sad.
He knows a name, the name of the small furry creature that is his constant companion. Cassiopeia.
without needing to look. No, this stare is definitely something else.
Ron and Harry go Aurors on the whole thing—Harry may not be allowed to work the investigation due to a too close personal connection to it, but he still oversees things and function as someone to help Ron think—and immediately go back to the scene of the attack to see if there was anything they missed the first time.
This time, Harry is the more vulnerable one. As he should be.
As they step outside, Ron catches sight of Malfoy's posse of Slytherins standing in a group and seemingly arguing. He doesn't see Malfoy's blond head among them though.
“Because the house elf can’t suspect anything! Mother is distracting him, but I don’t know how much longer she can! Any longer and he might go to bloody
Harry presses Malfoy into the bed, covering him with his own body as much as he can, rubs their bodies together and kisses him over and over.
For the first time since Adriana met him, Draco smiles.
"Is it true that Potter is hung like a Hippogriff?"
Draco is still asleep, face relaxed and lips slightly parted. He's very quiet, calm, in sleep, in a way that he never is when they're awake. Awake Draco is full of manic energy and is actually kind of hard to keep up with a lot of the time. Especially when he gets going on a tangent. Not that Harry minds, really; sometimes it’s actually very nice to listen to Draco when he gets going. A lot of the time even.
The amulet gleams in the candle light—fae fire, Draco had called it when they set up this safe-house—and Harry cannot squash the small feeling of hope that blooms in his chest. It's treacherous, and bound to hurt unimaginably if things go wrong, but he cannot help it. This amulet is the first lead they've found in
“Harry! Stop being mean to Cassiopeia!” Draco’s voice echoes down the hall again.
"Well, first of all we would need a distraction. Something we need to draw all of the orders and any new theory that is in the building away from here. Just for long enough that I can sabotage the room circle and switch up the necessary runes and glyphs to reverse the effects of it." Draco bites his lip. "And then we would need to keep it safe for long enough to have an effect. I don't think we can trust that any Herders who realise what is going on wouldn't come running back to stop us. So we need to be ready to fight and protect the reverse effect from the crystal."
As Healer Binns’s magic washes over Draco, he relaxes into the bed and tries not to think of anything at all.
He huffs slightly. “I can only hope and pray to Circe that my parents chose their secret keeper better than yours did. There are enough orphans in this room.” He looks away then, because he
“Loulou!” Draco says, delighted. It’s been quite some time since he’s seen her, since she’s tasked with taking care of the Riviera Villa and only rarely comes to the Manor.

a very common name after all. Relief washes over like a wave and he relaxes a bit.
“All right, we're counting the ones we have... There was the diary, the ring, and Slytherin's locket. Those three we have already destroyed. If we count the snake, the cup and the diadem and assume that they are also horcruxes, that means Thomas made six horcruxes total.” That doesn't sound so bad to Harry, that means that they're halfway already.
Still, having Ginny’s seal of approval on the ring and the proposal itself is a relief. Pansy had Opinions too, but Harry tuned her out. She’s been Draco’s friend longer than anyone, but for some reason she just doesn’t understand his taste and refuses to accept that she doesn’t. It’s a standing joke among the rest of them at this point, and Draco doesn’t mind getting gifts that are very much Not To His Taste… but only if they’re from Pansy. No one else gets any sort of leeway.
“I'd rather not have to get anywhere near that snake. That would certainly be a horcrux that is capable of defending itself.” Draco shudders.

“Draco," he whispers. “I just felt something. It might be Voldemort, he might have set up a trap for us here.”
It's still kind of the only thing that makes sense here. Potter is the one who came here and started talking about how he misses Draco, and how he'd noticed that Draco was getting worse and he'd broken up with Draco because of that, and he’s here saying that he thinks Draco probably has depression. So clearly that means he broke up with Draco because he'd thought Draco had depression.
“What? Why?” Ron says through a mouthful of sausage.

go to Potter than anything else. Draco is sure of it. Who would want to be anywhere near Draco and his depressive moods and over-dramatic yelling when they could be near Potter who is just... a genuinely nice person?
“Well,” Draco says. “If we think that Helga Hufflepuff's cup might be one, then I'm going to say that we should also count Rowena Ravenclaw's missing diadem. It may be missing, but who’s more likely to find it than someone as obsessed as Thomas? Do you think the Sword of Gryffindor…?”
"Right," Father says. "Because it told us that there was no help to be found in the libraries. We did everything we could until we realised that it was futile…"
“I love you too.” Harry presses his forehead gently against Draco’s. “Before I get them, I should warn you that your mother took our finished wedding album and all the plans and has started to make the necessary bookings and appointments. She started the moment the healer said that she and Ron had made it in time and that you

When he wanders, the small furry creature wanders with him. Until it wants him to carry it, then it lets out loud angry noises.
“If it's from Hermione, and it ends in ‘are you’...” Draco trails off, holding his chin. “Do you think maybe she's asking where you are? Maybe she and Ron came back to the forest... they're your friends, so maybe they changed their minds about leaving?”
No doubt would that just end up scaring someone and make him look like a lunatic. There
He’s grown up around portraits, he knows how they work and how they’re a way to capture a bit of someone you love to remain in the world after they're gone without them becoming something as terrible as a ghost. And while portraits are an accurate reflection of them, and capable of learning and growing, in many ways as real as the person themselves…
my friend and not just because Ron and Hermione aren't here!” Harry's heart beats so loudly in his ears that he can barely hear anything besides it. He just hopes that Draco will believe him.
This is all just… A farce. They’re just mocking him.
“Ugh,
But maybe Harry’s just really bitter.
shall we say, over the years.” Father sounds proud, and Draco can imagine him straightening in his seat as he speaks. “Is there anything particular you’re looking for?”

Your shields ran rampant inside your head, and you locked it all away so tightly you essentially… gave yourself amnesia to a severe degree to protect yourself from the trauma.”

He's got permission from the parents, no matter how weird and archaic that feels (and wasn’t that just about one of the most uncomfortable conversations he's ever had with Narcissa and
“Why the hell should we go to Malfoy Manor?” Harry almost wants to strangle Draco. He talks so much and says so little.
It’s too much. He’s sure Potter can spin some fucking bullshit explanation if Draco were to ask, probably something about the lease or maybe being tired of living with a couple who probably has loud sex—oh Merlin, why did he have to have that thought? That’s disgusting, he doesn’t want to think about what Weasley and Granger get up to at all.
“Draco! Are you alright? How did it go? Did you manage to stop the damn boy from doing something foolish?” Father’s voice comes through strong, but Draco can see the worry on his face.
long and nice stick.
He swallows the urge and as soon as Potter and Ginny Weasley round a corner at the back of the shop, he closes the newspaper and staggers to his feet.
He spends his day with the small furry creature at his side, in his arms, on his shoulders.
like Malfoy to be underhanded and hex someone in the back like this.
"How about it, my darling? Do you want some time alone with Mr. Potter?"
He gasps.
He's got the date, time, and place all planned and ready (Draco's favourite restaurant, tomorrow, right after dinner but before dessert).
"Not you, Lucius. Your son. Young Draco." The Dark Lord nearly
Well, whatever, at least she's being a voice of reason and logic. Right now, anyway.
The sides of the man's mouth twitches, almost as if he were about to smile. "I would be much obliged."
It's pretty clear to him that he's the problem. He's the one who's been dumped in every single relationship, so clearly, he's the one who's just not worth it. It must just be something incredibly off-putting about him that no one can stand for long.
Draco grins at him, and Harry smiles back. It's not all bleak; they don't know a lot but they know more than they knew before. They're not as helpless as they used to be.
"I do! I know a lot more. For example, though they became lovers, the God of the Sun and the God of the Stars were originally rivals." Adriana puts some glasses away as Draco takes a seat at the bar.
It’s Malfoy’s own fault they’re in this situation anyway!

how powerful they are, which is also why all the gods also have Spoken Names. Names that can invoke them, but hold no power in and of themselves."
And Disapparates just before the closest Inferi manages to snag Draco’s pale hair.
He’s starting to feel like he’s going insane. Like he’s over-thinking and analysing everything to try and find some way his shitty boyfriend isn’t actually shitty and he
Harry starts to sputter in surprise. They've been agonizing about this for weeks, and somehow Draco hasn't noticed? He hasn't been listening to them at all?
“I’m sorry, Neville.”
Draco isn't depressed. That's not what is happening here. But he does know that his parents are worried, that his friends probably think he's being weird and embarrassing. Maybe they're worrying too.
He's quite sure that they wouldn't stay for him. Potter has always been the one people prefer, the one who is so charismatic that he just draws people to him. At least, he's always drawn Draco to him.
He wonders if he has himself to blame, for wondering if Potter’s return would help his creative output. He wonders if he somehow summoned Potter through all of his ridiculous longing and all the letters he wrote.
This is it, Harry thinks. This is the moment.
“I've had it!" Draco suddenly yells and gets to his feet. He stomps off into the forest and Harry watches him, afraid that he's leaving too. That just like Ron and Hermione, he won't come back.
Which isn't really something Harry likes to think about too much. He just tries to ignore it most of the time. He sometimes feels kind of bad for even thinking the thought; shouldn't he be thinking about Ginny? Of course, he
Well, the thing with Cho was also uncomfortable for
But really, either Draco’s Other died, or they went through that ritual, found out who he is, and decided that it was worth a Core Severing to break any connection between them.
“You are so bloody lucky Kreacher went running to my mother to tell her all about how he tricked you, rather than to my very-much-insane aunt.” Malfoy’s face twists into a deeper sneer. “If you go to the Ministry, you’ll play right into You-Know-Who’s hands.”

If they live that long.
Oh… Oh. Well. Draco nearly sags with relief. Harry and Draco have a date on Saturday, just as they do almost every week, and Harry hasn’t cancelled it. So… Surely this must be some
Harry hasn’t cancelled Saturday, and he’d hardly just not show up. That… That would be very out of character of him. Every time either one of them has needed to cancel so far, they've sent an owl or Floo called beforehand. So clearly he's got nothing to worry about and this is all just a silly misunderstanding that Draco's under because he's being a snoop and listening in on someone else's conversation.
Still, it kind of weirds Draco out; no matter how well he knows Potter and what makes him tick, he currently has no idea what he's even thinking. It's not the usual angry stare; that one Draco can basically
“I have an enchanted mirror, alright!” Malfoy yells, twisting in Harry’s grasp. “As if my parents would send me off here when You-Know-Who is loose without the ability to contact them instantly!”
He doesn't actually expect to ever see Potter and his friends again, in some ways he'd almost

Harry shares a look with Draco, they nod at each other, and then Harry sets the bombs off.

it’s not the same bone-deep weariness that has been weighing him down.
“Pansy’s just peeved that it’s taking longer than she’d like for her to be able to plant her tush in a chair in the sun for some tanning.” Blaise smiles slyly. “Pay her no mind. As soon as she gets a drink in her hand she’ll be just dandy again.”
He's not sure he can really survive going through all of it again. He doesn't know if he's capable of fighting for the rest of his life. Draco's presence is quite possibly the only thing that makes it bearable. He loves his friends, he loves his family... But this time they're not enough.
He wonders if it’s his Malfoy pride that doesn’t want to entertain the idea of being wrong. If it’s the shameful thought of having cried himself to sleep night after night over something that wasn’t real. If his friends saw through him—the embarrassment threatens to set his face aflame even as he wants to simply crawl into a hole—then no doubt his parents did too.

make the sort of mistakes and horrible choices Draco did.
Someone takes him away from there, takes him back to what he thinks was once his room. And he goes to bed.
Everything else just seems too heavy to deal with at times; only the simple pleasure of lying in bed with his husband helps Harry get through the days. All the fighting, all the bleeding, all of it is worth it just to get to come back to hold his husband.
"Not so fast!" Weasley grabs Draco by the bicep again, yanking him backwards. "Still got questions for you, Malfoy."
"I... What were they rivals about?" Draco tilts his head to the side, a bemused expression on his face.
, the criminal can still get away with terrible things. And as long as the people who need help since the war ended don't get it, there will be desperate people willing to do terrible things to survive. After all, Draco should know better than anyone what desperation can make someone do.

He looks back at her face and his mouth opens.
And then, with a shiver, he realises his mistake.
Headmaster Dumbledore’s occasionally lax hiring practices. No offence, Professor Dumbledore.”
“A cure,” Draco breathes, suddenly feeling out of breath.
“What… What happened?” Draco isn’t sure he’s ready to hear the answer to the question at all, it’s no doubt going to be something terrible and dark and awful and he’d rather not relive it at all.
The food is delicious, and as soon as he’s full, Harry’s going to do it. He’s going to do it when they’re eating dessert this time.
It’s bad enough that Blaise and Pansy will never come back, his memories of… Of however long it’s been since the war is fuzzy at best, but he remembers them vaguely. Remembers not remembering them. Remembers wondering if he knew them at all, remembers concluding that they were strangers after they stopped coming.
before he gets treatment. He knows it’s nothing life-threatening, so it can wait.
He can even feel the spark of his own magic.
Draco can’t stop the happy laugh he huffs out against Harry’s lips. In fact, he doesn’t
Merlin, he wants to marry this man.
And he’s quite sure his own eleven year-old self would scream if anyone had told him that would happen. It’s a funny enough thought that Draco lets out a small laugh.
He follows after her at a small distance; he doesn’t want Draco to see him, but he wants to see Draco’s reaction.
Old Tobias and Estelle are the only ones old enough to remember the times before the stars were lost, and when they speak of them, when they paint pictures with words... The whole village listens. They all take comfort in the knowledge that once there was something in the sky besides the moon, something more that lit up the night.
