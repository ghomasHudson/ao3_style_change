‘What you did was not your fault. He made you do this, he tortured you into obeying him.’ Harry cupped Draco’s face in his hands, looking directly into those steel eyes. ‘You can’t be blamed for that.’
‘I have no idea.’ Ron was standing over them.
casted by Ron and Neville, but it looked like there was smoke rising from the burns.
- I think I do, but how do I achieve that?
‘I see. And you came here to check if I’m a part of that.’
Suddenly, Draco’s hand was gone. Harry tried to sit up and protest, but he was pushed back down.
- You need to be welcoming. Like nothing matters in the world besides their good time. You can set boundaries, refuse to do certain things if you’re not comfortable, but that limits your client scope, so you have to make the decision for yourself.
- “Take care”? – Harry desperately hoped Draco meant the better one of to things that just popped into his head. The solo version.
‘I’ll tell you if you tell me about your non-existent kinks.’ Harry smirked.
- Why would you even do that? – Hermione stopped yelling, but still looked thoroughly scandalized.
‘Not to mention none of us knew parseltongue, so we wouldn’t be able to anyway.’
‘I don’t know, never dwelled on that. I mean, I did have sex with several women, so if I’m not straight, I’d be bi. Why are we dissecting my orientation right now anyway? We were talking about your kink.’
- Oh, I thought you were going to work with Draco now that… - Neville didn’t finish that thought obviously abashed.
‘We have good and bad news…’ Ron started.
‘Well, that much I know actually, I’m not completely oblivious, but why are they going so fast? How do they know where to go and how not to hit the others? And how on Earth are we getting to the other side?!’ It was clear she was starting to panic. Draco, on the other hand, seemed intrigued by the moving cars.
- Oh, so that was where the infamous Black residence went! Bellatrix was livid when she found out she’s not getting it, but nobody told her who really got it. Turned out for the best, I suppose.
popped into his head that he had a sudden moment of clarity – it was 4
‘I don’t know how to tell you this…’ Harry was looking at the floor. ‘Well, to put it simply, you scared me.’
- What does it say it does?
‘Minister, with all due respect, this is an asinine idea.’ Harry looked determined. ‘You cannot force him to do this! Besides, Lucius will figure out something is off! He’ll never talk and if he does, it would be only to implicate Draco – it’s not exactly a secret he’s still angry at him about the refusal to testify!’
, for it to be someone else’s.’
‘Please… Anything… Whatever you want…’
On the second piece of parchment, there was a list of additional documentation they needed:
Yes, twice. He got excited over the case and he didn’t think about what he was doing.
‘What was that? And why is your lip bleeding?’
Potter was lying there, on his bed, staring at the ceiling, his face the epitome of indifference towards the world. He barely even registered Draco’s dramatic entrance. On his bedside table there were four or five different half-empty potion bottles. On the floor beside Potter’s bed there was a knocked-over empty goblet. Right in front of Draco, on the floor, there was a piece of parchment with barely readable writing on it. Draco picked it up and tried to decipher what was written – “draught of peace, draught of living death, forget-all potion…”. He couldn’t understand anything else written, but what he deciphered gave him goosebumps.
‘Exactly. So I’m assuming Voldemort just used that old spell, not thinking about what happens when someone branded with dark magic comes to contact with it.’
‘It sure sounded like you’re into guys, Potter.’ Malfoy smirked and raised his eyebrow. Was he somehow sober right now?
Both Ron and Kingsley were already there – Ron looked like he was already regretting his decision to let Harry switch the order of the interrogations at the last minute, but the Minister was seemingly just happy to put the case to a close finally. He cleared his throat sitting behind Harry’s desk (now uncharacteristically clean, since all the paperwork was currently cluttering every surface in Harry’s apartment) and gestured them to sit down.
‘Minister…’ his voice was still hoarse from crying ‘I’m sorry, but I can’t go back there… I can’t face all that happened. I know… I know that what you saw is not enough, but… but I can’t see the rest with you. It gets worse… I…’ he clung to Harry again, hiding his face from the other men ‘I killed that man. They made me.’ The tears came back and Harry instinctively pulled him closer.
‘Oh, so you’re on first-name basis now? This is getting interesting…’ Ron had way too much of a sly expression for his face now for Harry’s taste. He felt the sudden urge to punch him.
- That doesn’t matter. – Harry said determinately. – I still have Grimmauld Place, so we’ll have a place to live. And even if there was some agreement that made the money joined, I have some of my own, we’ll manage.
‘Oh my God, I never thought about that! It must take so much time!’
It was only when the room was completely empty and the door was shut behind him, that Harry snapped back. He found himself clutching the last vial of some potion in his fist, standing face to face with Draco, who was still staring ahead with an empty gaze and bleeding something black. Harry realized just then how much he was shaking – he felt sick and cold, his whole body was trembling and the fist surrounding the vial was getting tighter and tighter. He could only manage to get out ‘Get him help!’ before he felt a sharp pain cutting through his skin – the glass broke and whatever was inside was now seeping into his bloodstream. He had no idea how long it took before the whole world around him went completely dark and he felt his body collapsing on the floor.
‘He knew everything?’
‘I think I best owl Arthur and Hermione’ Draco said. ‘You know, to thank them for their recommendations. I couldn’t have done it without their help.’
‘Never said I was.’ He took another swig of whisky.
- Oh, really? Is that all? It’s pretty convenient he “understood” – Ron’s air quotes infuriated Harry – how you feel. Funny he’s the only one while none of your real friends picked up on it, isn’t it?
- MALFOY?! What the fuck?! – Harry bellowed. Draco suddenly felt a wave of cold brush over him. His glamour and self-transfiguration have been lifted.
‘Oh, hello, Weasley. Looking for someone?’ The man said politely, clearly not fazed by Ron suddenly appearing in his doorway. Ron was starting to suspect that the thing the man was smoking must not be a cigarette.
‘If there was no objection to allow Mr. Potter to question the remaining suspects in the case, we will have to check what the bylaws state on the matter of questioning prosecution’s representative.’ Shacklebolt said hesitantly. ‘This is a highly unusual situation and I am not completely sure if Mr. Potter’s appearance in this case as a witness would not prohibit him from acting as a prosecutor.’
After the war has ended, Harry had nowhere to go. Ironically, he was the hero everyone cherished and he knew that if he was to ask anybody, they would welcome him in their home with open arms. But he didn’t want to be cherished and looked up to. He knew what staying with any of the people he knew meant – he would end up solving disputes and making decisions when others couldn’t agree on a particular issue. They would wait for his opinion like he was some sort of authority on all subjects possible all of a sudden. He had a taste of it right after the final battle – people were asking for his input on the best way to repair the castle (like he knew anything about ancient architecture!), he was asked for “expertise” during the Death Eater trials (since when was he a lawyer?!) – hell, even Ron and Hermione wanted to know if the thought they should go look for Hermione’s parents together, as if he ever held more than a 5-minute conversation with them or was an expert on post-obliviation procedures (was there even such a thing?). No, it was way too much to handle. He had been making decisions for a whole year, his friends told him point blank he was the “boss” – and look where his decision-making has led him? Of course, Voldemort was defeated, but at what cost? Lupin and Tonks were dead, two Wesley twins became one, countless other people lost their lives. Of course he knew this was what war comes with, he wasn’t stupid enough to believe nobody would get hurt. He knew he couldn’t possibly have prevented what happened. But what if he could’ve done something to spare even one more life? Hell, if he had figured out where the diadem is sooner maybe Malfoy and his minions wouldn’t have caught them in the Room of Requirement and Crabbe would still be alive today? He never really hated the guy on his own, it was just the residual hatred he felt towards Malfoy that radiated off to the other two. His death was not needed, it didn’t accomplish anything or help restore peace. With the others, he could at least try to convince himself that it was for the greater good (he shuddered realizing he’s using Grindelwald’s motto), but with Crabbe it was not the case – it was the same thing as it has been with Sirius – it was his fault and his fault only and it served no purpose.
‘It does. Imagine having to wipe everything down when you just have a cloth, and then you have to clean all your windows manually, vacuum the floors, wash the dishes, scrub the toilets…’
- I needed it. I thought that after what I did to Harry it was the only way I should be treated. That it was the only way to even things out and try to move forward. That’s why I ended up in his bedroom in the first place. This whole thing, me hurting you – he looked at Harry – and loosing you was just like what happened before.
‘Once again: I have no kink. And your sexual preferences are much more interesting than my non-existent fetishes anyway.’
- I… I can explain… - there was nothing Draco could do besides cover himself up. His wand was shoved into the bottom of his locker downstairs, they weren’t allowed to bring personal belongings to their rooms.
‘You’re spiralling again.’
- Can… can we come too? I still don’t understand all of it fully. – Hermione was hesitant.
- Ron, stop! – Hermione looked terrified.
- I’m pretty sure it has been the same thing Draco has been lost in since Herbology on Thursday… - Pansy drew all the syllables in an annoying manner. – He has a thing for Potter and now he knows Potter has a thing for someone, so Draco is hoping there is a future there!
- What do you mean “you couldn’t get through the door”? – Hermione sat up.
year, my first. You don’t know him probably, he was from abroad. Then I had a brief fling with Davies’ older brother, it lasted about 2 months somewhere in the 6
- What are you saying? – Harry looked up.
- I am, thank you Neville. – Harry decided not to ask what Neville really meant on the off chance that he was interpreting Neville’s speech wrong. – You’re a good friend, you know?
‘Jesus, Malfoy, I never thought you’re in that deep…’ Potter looked lost.
‘No need. It just comes out and you’re ready to eat it. And no need to clean anything afterwards. Actually, a lot of Muggle food comes in a can – some of it you don’t spray, like soups for example, you just open the can, plop the soup into a pot and heat it up. Muggles are really big on making food quick to prepare. Take microwave dishes for example…’
- Don’t call him a wanker, please. It makes me uncomfortable. Besides, I don’t know if I’m falling for him. It’s not that simple.
‘Oh, my father had nothing to do with this.’ Malfoy smiled wickedly. ‘I volunteered to be on the case. Besides, nobody else seemed willing to go against their precious Chosen One, so the Chief gladly gave this case to me. You see, I never liked you, and now at least nobody can accuse me of holding on to old grudges – after all, once you’re found guilty of murdering your own friend, you won’t be so cherished anymore…’
‘If I may, Minister…’ Ron looked furious ‘…you claim, Potter, that you’re not friends with Malfoy. So how exactly did the subject of this case come up in your, supposedly nearly non-existent, conversations?’
‘I don’t know, it doesn’t matter! I need to go see Harry!’
- So last night we talked. For a long time. – He swiftly omitted the “nearly killing himself and being saved by Draco Malfoy” part. There would be time for that later. – And Draco made me realize some things about myself.
- Well, ok… - Harry decided that a different perspective might help him. After all, Ron didn’t need to know the whole story. – Sit down, it’s a long one. You know how Malfoy disappeared after his parents’ trial?
- Slow down, let’s take this one by one. As for where you go, you have two options – you either find a spot on the street or knock on doors asking if they’ll take you in. They take a cut of what you earn, but it’s safer and usually you get better clients there.
‘Well, that night, before Ron showed up…’ Harry was suddenly feeling embarrassed – what if Draco rejected him? ‘I thought we were going further with this. I mean, not ahead of time, it wasn’t planned, but in that moment... you know.’
- I am. I wanted this for quite some time now.
Harry spent his days battling the question what the bloody hell to do with Draco. As his shock and disgust cooled down, he realized Malfoy was in a rather pitiful situation and outing him right now wouldn’t be a good thing to do, but he still didn’t know if he should help him get out of Muggle London and back into the wizarding world. He was staring through his office window trying to decide what to do, when Ron’s voice brought him back to reality.
‘Could you stop embarrassing me for a second? And please, refrain from calling me that in front of my fiancée!’ Draco was clearly uncomfortable with the sudden outburst of motherly emotions.
Harry got up and turned around. Draco was standing behind him, looking scared, tears still glistening in his eyes.
- God… Draco… yes… please… I can’t… without you…
left they might use against you?’
- Did you just say something about me? – Harry stood up. He’d been trying to ignore this kind of thing for too long now, he had enough.
Harry sighed. There was logic behind what McGonagall did, but it didn’t mean he was happy about it.
‘Your fault? How exactly?’
‘Well, well, well…’ Dean had a mixture of amusement and disgust painted on his face.
- Well, that went south rather quickly… - Harry muttered, looking at the parchment.
- Ron, please, stop this… - Hermione was all but crying.
‘Well, if you can’t sleep, which you caused with your stupid hunch, you have to do something, don’t you?’
- But… - Draco didn’t know what to say. He never thought of the skull that branded him for the rest of his life that way.
Draco whispered another lubrication spell and bowed down to kiss Harry again. This time it was more forceful, more lustful. When their tongues collided, Draco pushed forward, breaking the barrier. Harry threw his head back and groaned. Draco froze, looking at him worriedly. “So… Good…” Harry moaned, meeting Draco’s gaze. Slowly, hesitantly, Draco pushed on, burying himself deeper. Harry’s breathing was irregular and loud, to the point Draco could barely distinguish the words that came between them: “Fuck… Just… Like… That… Fuck… Yes… You’re a god…”. The sight of his boyfriend biting his lower lip and screwing his eyes shut was sending Draco’s head into a tailspin as he thrusted into Harry faster and faster. When tentative pushes and hesitant whimpers turned into slams and unapologetic moans, he knew he wouldn’t last. He braced himself on the wall behind the headboard of the bed, looking down on Harry – he saw the Gryffindor nearing his own finish and all he could manage while holding off his own release was to drawl “Come for me, baby” through clenched teeth. That was all both of them needed. Harry came in long, white arcs, all over them both – the sight sent Draco over the edge and he collapsed under the weight of his own orgasm mere seconds later.
- What do you mean?
‘Well, not for us, because we can just cast a cleaning spell. Muggles have to do everything themselves.’
- Harry, I’ve been here for fifteen minutes! What got you so wrapped up?
‘You will never guess who just got hired in the Office!’ Ron was visibly angry – he treated his job at the Auror Office
are you talking about, Minister?’
‘Wow, I seem to have misjudged you, Potter. I never thought you had it in you. I thought you hated me enough to use this.’ Why was he saying this? Draco was already mentally reprimanding himself for this sudden outburst of sincerity.
- You clearly weren’t thinking when you took it all either!
Draco’s letter, however, was much less promising.
‘Malfoy, don’t!’ Ron shouted, but it was too late. The second Draco uttered the first spell, a thin rope of fire shot out of the gate and wrapped itself around his wrist. It was all too quick for Harry to see – all he registered was Draco’s scream and then falling onto his back, something heavy on top of him. It took a second to realize what happened – Draco must have been pulled through the gate by the rope of fire, like a prisoner being escorted into their cell. That analogy proved to be problematic, however, because Harry had no idea if they were going to be able to get out of the Manor at all, now that is was apparently serving as a prison for its ‘invader’. Harry groaned in frustration getting up – it was like the Ministry didn’t trust Draco even after they’ve offered him a job, at least not enough to actually do anything about the enchantments they’ve set in place to keep the ex-Death Eaters out. And the fact that nobody bothered to warn them was even worse. However, when he looked at Draco, his thoughts came to a screeching halt.
- It’s not like that. He changed, I know this. No, scratch that, he never was a bad person, it was just what he has been forced into. He was just trying to protect me back there.
‘I’m not sure I understand.’
‘Oh, so it’s about me?’ Draco’s curiosity was rising. ‘Spit it out, then.’
Draco knew he couldn’t slip completely into his dominant self just yet, Harry wasn’t ready. But the thought of wrapping his lips around his boyfriend’s erection and looking at him writhing around begging for it was too much for him to fight it. He’d been starved for months now, all he had to go off of was his fantasies of Harry cumming down his throat that he only let himself let in the shower, he couldn’t resist any longer. He pulled Harry’s pants down. Good God, that cock was big. One of the biggest ones he had in his life. He briefly wondered what would feel better – having Harry inside of him or the other way around. He smiled to himself – he was quite lucky he liked being the bottom as much as the top. It let him experiment with all different kinds of partners. He ran his tongue along the Gryffindor’s erection before flicking it across the head. Harry groaned.
‘Are you questioning your own wife’s judgement of her abilities, Mr. Weasley?’ Kingsley was clearly expecting this reaction from Ron. ‘I would’ve thought you’d be a more supportive husband than that… And I didn’t hear you protest when I placed Mr. Malfoy in Mr. Potter’s apartment. Are you trying to tell me that not only does Mrs. Granger overestimate her own capabilities of defending herself, against a person who, as far as I know, has no wand, but also that said capabilities of hers are that much below Mr. Potter’s level of expertise in your opinion? Well, if I were you, I would expect a stern talking to from your wife tonight – she’s not going to be happy when I tell her we’re going a different route with this whole affair, because her own husband protested violently.’
- So what Malfoy, now you’re an expert on all things Gryffindor? – Ron clearly wasn’t having any of it. – I swear to Merlin, if you badmouth one of my friends one more time…
‘Out of the blue? Unlikely…’
- Yea-Yeah, I did. – Harry was desperately trying to go back to his original train of thought after those revelations. – It just never occurred to me that you should know that… - He swallowed. – That you’re my first boyfriend. First serious relationship in fact.
- No buts. If I wasn’t ok with it, I wouldn’t think of all the things I want you to do to me right now, you know? – Harry smiled. Draco loosened instantly. So his boyfriend really didn’t mind the mark.
‘Well… I don’t really know what to start with, it’s a complicated story…’ Harry was stuttering. How much did he actually have to tell them? He sighed. ‘I’m sorry, I’m nervous. I wasn’t really expecting to be questioned today. Ok, so a little before I told everyone Dr- Malfoy was dead, we actually met in Muggle London. Not on purpose, we just ran into each other. We talked, it wasn’t entirely pleasant, to say the least, and about 2 weeks later I got an owl from him that said ‘I decided to go’ or something like that. I knew he wasn’t really doing that good there and that he felt like there was no place for him here, so my conclusion was that he killed himself.’
, when they were leaving Grimmauld Place), Harry was tasked with finding a conductor and purchasing the tickets. He ordered Draco and his mother to stay put in their seats and went on to look for the conductor. When he returned, he found Narcissa looking mesmerized by her surroundings, while Draco was sitting on the edge of his seat, utterly uncomfortable.
- I don’t know. All I know is I shouldn’t even be at Hogwarts right now after what I did.
‘Did you see that?’ Draco’s voice was rough, almost broken.
He felt Harry’s breath on his cock and knew it was only a matter of seconds before he came. He could hold off longer if he really tried, but somehow (most likely instinctively, because all of his ability to use logic and reasoning was gone the moment his boyfriend touched him) he knew it was better not to. He felt Harry’s tongue on him, running up his length mimicking what Draco himself did earlier, and moaned. This seemed to encourage the Gryffindor, because Draco felt his whole cock being swallowed. Harry chocked the moment Draco felt his erection hit the back of his throat. He wouldn’t admit it out loud, but this was precisely what got Draco off. He loved the sensation of choking his partners with his dick. He felt his orgasm getting closer and closer and when he saw Harry’s head go back down for more, all he could do was succumb to the waves of pleasure that overtook him. It was the best orgasm he had in months, certainly way better than anything he could ever achieve on his own. His brain went into overdrive, he was hypersensitive to every touch, every sound, every sensation. He pulled Harry back up towards him, looking in his eyes. Potter seemed content with himself, and justly so – after all, he just gave Draco the finish of the year.
‘What’s gotten into you first thing in the morning?’ Ron looked taken aback, but it did nothing to ease Harry’s anger at him.
- You’re right. I’m just so sick of my life sometimes.
(See the end of the chapter for
- What feelings? What are you rambling about?!
- Harry? Harry?
- Yeah, I figured as much. Hermione once said he has an emotional range of a teaspoon…
‘We are. What’s it to you anyway?’ Draco sprung back to life.
- Well, well, well… I must say, I’m surprised. – The man smacked his lips. – You didn’t strike me as the type to be able to clean at all. I thought you were one of those twigs that get by using innocent men. But a deal is a deal. Get yourself a loaf of bread and a glass of milk. You can eat here but get out afterwards, I still don’t trust you enough to keep you here all day. – The man left, leaving Draco alone with the girl. There was a minute of silence before she spoke.
‘I don’t what, Potter? I don’t know?’
- Easy for you to say, you didn’t just loose the love of your life. – Draco was slurring. They were both drunk, it was already their third bottle of alcohol that night.
‘I told you.’ Harry’s expression was gone in an instant and Draco felt a slight tinge of regret. ‘If you’re still up for it, I can talk to my boss and maybe try to get you a job there. I could use an assistant and you made a good impression on the Minister himself, so this might work out.’
‘I wish. In some newer trains there is sort of a tank underneath, but in older ones that’s just how it works’ Harry shrugged.
‘Granger? What are you doing here?’ She jumped up.
- I am, no problem. – Draco loosened. – Although, in the spirit of honesty, you probably need to know that Parkinson, Nott and Zabini know who I am and how I approach relationships. I’ve been down that road before you see, and they’ve witnessed that. But they know better than to go around and blab about it to everyone, so you don’t need to worry about anything getting out as long as Weasel keeps his mouth shut.
- I’m not sure I do actually… - Harry was now just as abashed now as Nott was. – You mean you’re not gay?
- Me? Cleaning? With my delicate hands? Do you want me to stop being so beautiful?
And yet, not even a week later, Potter was back in room 20, biting Draco’s nipples and fucking him senseless, while Draco was doing his best to imagine that he’s having sex with somebody, anybody else. He became quite good in faking pleasure and orgasms, so he usually wasn’t worried he would disappoint his clients, but with Potter it was different. Yasmine was a master in moaning encouragements - Draco wasn’t. And as soon as Potter came through the door, Yasmine was nowhere to be found and Draco had to face another night being Potter’s toy completely alone. He felt the man getting close to orgasm, so he decided it was time to put on his best show. Arching his back and holding his breath he entangled his hand in Potters hair and pulled him up, forcing him to look at Draco’s face.
‘Ok, so as far as we know, they travel all over the country convincing elderly witches and wizards the Death Eaters are coming back. From what Ron gathered, there was at least one instance when they pointed someone –
– they are really good at hiding their tracks. Why do you think the case ended up in the Auror Office anyway?’
- Yeah, I guess so. I think I owe Theo an explanation for my actions tonight. – He turned around to go into the bedroom and all of them gasped. There was a long, red gash along Draco’s spine. It would’ve looked like he was sliced with a knife if not for the fact that the edges seemed burned.
‘For your information, I did NOT sleep with Malfoy.’
‘Lard? That’s lard? I thought it was cream!’ Draco had such a comically horrified expression on his face that Harry nearly fell of the table laughing.
In the common room, Draco was battling similar thoughts. By now he was completely sure that he was to blame not only for how Harry’s first time ended, but for the two of them even going there in the first place. He should’ve said no when Harry told him he wanted to go all the way tonight. Neither of them was ready for it, it was clear to Draco – Harry’s motivation for moving further was shaky, he could see that now clearly, and Draco let himself use it to get what he wanted for months now, even though he should’ve known better than that. It was a scary realisation that he let lust and greed overtake him like that even when he thought he was still able to control himself. Somehow, it was even worse than what he did at the end – he was well aware that he wasn’t thinking then, but those minutes earlier he was so sure he still had a cool head on his shoulders. And now it became apparent that he wasn’t thinking at all and he didn’t even realise it. He didn’t deserve Harry. He was supposed to protect him, not hurt him. And if he was the one to cause him so much pain that Harry was reduced to crying from it, there was no hope for the two of them. No, he needed to take a step back – however much he wanted Harry close to him, above all he wanted his boyfriend to be safe and happy, and he wasn’t the one to make that happen. Harry has already had enough monsters in his life, he didn’t need another one. Draco threw his head back, trying to control the tears. The thought he was better than that, he thought he would be able to break out of the circle of violence he’s been a part of ever since he could remember. And now it was obvious that he couldn’t do it even for the one person he loved above everyone else, the only one he would kill for. He smirked bitterly. “Kill for” – yeah, he should’ve known weeks ago, when he attacked Thomas. That was when he should’ve stepped away. He should’ve realised that his actions then proved he really was what everyone around him took him for, and backed out then. He would’ve had his heart broken, but Harry wouldn’t have been hurt like that. But no, he was too much of a self-absorbed coward to do that. Once again, he put his needs above Harry’s when he should’ve done the exact opposite.
- Yeah, Ron, knock it off. Just leave us alone. – Harry said.
- I dare you, you fucking scum, say one more word and you’ll regret the day you were born. – Not using any of the Unforgivable Curses right then and there was the most difficult task Draco faced in his life. Over the wrath he didn’t even notice that nobody moved a muscle, everyone was too shocked to break the fight apart. – I fucking dare you, say something else… SAY IT! – He was screaming, but it didn’t matter.
If there’s time, save Draco first.’ Harry was deliberately not looking at him to not give him a chance to object. ‘I have a bigger chance of surviving whatever might attack us than he does, I have more experience with dealing with things like these.’ Without waiting for another word from the rest of the group, Harry turned to face the wall and hissed the command.
‘There is nothing you can do, all I have is your word and to me it’s worthless.’
why I can’t do this! All I can think of right now is the trials after the war!’
‘Well, that last one is kind of logical, there was no need for a… how did you call it? Trigger? …if you were there.’
- Well, actually a change of pace might do me some good. Let me just use the restroom real quick and I’ll be right back.
‘Nothing, it’s just… I’m kind of freaking out right now.’
‘Nothing.’
‘No, no, it makes sense!’ Potter was back on his barstool again and Draco felt cold all of a sudden. ‘They must have been there at least for a couple of days, right? Observing their potential victim, you said so yourself. They spotted you and decided that was proof enough.’
- No, you fucking can’t! Jesus, this is sick! You mean to tell me I’ve fucked you TWICE?!
‘That’s because so far you’ve been essentially a bounty hunter, Potter. Your job description was to find people with arrest warrants over their heads, the cases themselves were already made. Now that most of those are gone, you’ll have to figure out how to build cases on your own. If I were you, I’d get myself an assistant for that – you’re way too limited with your logic skills to manage this sort of thing on your own.’
- Nothing, work stuff.
‘So they’re really getting on with this crap?’ Harry shook his head.
- The armadillo bile. If you dump it inside right now it’ll react with the murtlap tentacles and it’ll blow the whole classroom up. I swear, you’re either somewhere else right now or you spend way to much time with Finnigan and picked up some of his love for pyrotechnics…
‘I don’t know. I’m just saying, don’t be surprised if this sort of thing goes on for a while. People have been wondering where you are and now they have a story to latch on to.’
- I don’t have a clue. I thought I just feel sorry for him…
For the next week each day looked the same – Draco fully awake for the whole night, going to sleep in Potter’s bed as soon as the other man entered the kitchen. Or at least that’s how Draco hoped Potter would see it. He didn’t know why exactly Potter would let him sleep in his bed every day but it didn’t even matter – it was the only way he could find some peace and serenity now, since each night was getting progressively worse than the previous one with, what Draco concluded to be withdrawal symptoms, getting stronger and stronger. Thursday Draco has spent eight hours pacing nervously around Potter’s living room shaking like a leaf and by Friday night he thought he was going to die from pain and nervousness. It was like he was trapped there, Voldemort and all his cohorts lurking outside the windows, while he was lying on the floor in a fetal position crying, because his whole skin was simultaneously being burned with a million cigarette buds and pricked with even more needles. Come morning, he thought he never felt so bad in his life. It proved to be very naïve of him though, because the next night he was just straight up being
- And is that good or bad?
‘It wasn’t about that…’ Potter’s voice dropped to a whisper. ‘It wasn’t that I thought you were dead, it was what happened before.’
- And now, the knight in the shining armour appears! All bow down to Sir Malfoy of The Slime-y Gitness! The damsel is no longer in distress, all is well in the kingdom! – Ron was practically radiating mockery. Draco seemed to regain some composure.
‘No, it’s nothing, just my…’ He hesitated – he didn’t want to tell Draco what hurt him, but he knew it could be important for the job. ‘the scar burned for a second when I touched the wall. But it’s really nothing, it wasn’t even that painful.’
‘I… I don’t understand…’ Harry’s voice sounded shaky.
a Slytherin, so he wouldn’t just settle for not knowing. ‘Nobody who runs a scheme like that operates without a plan for this long and manages to not be captured.’
‘Pace yourself, Draco, or you’ll want to stay here forever. We can get more later, it’s no good when it’s warm. Besides, I didn’t know if you’ll enjoy this. Now, are we ready to continue?’
- I… I don’t know what to tell you, Draco… I don’t even know what I’m thinking right now…
All Draco could focus on was the sensation of Harry licking stripes across his chest and stomach. When he felt his jeans and underwear being pulled off, he groaned and fell back. Once again, Harry was on top of him.
‘That won’t change any of their charges though. So they can’t gain anything and the risk is not worth it. No, I doubt they would do it. But if it makes you feel any better, I’ll be there during the questioning.’
- Pass me a quill, I’ll write a testimony that I took it by myself.
- You remember how you asked me last night if I had feelings for you? – Harry was visibly scared.
‘Keep an eye on him, ok? I think this is just the beginning…’
‘I need to know your idea, Mr. Malfoy. This is privileged information and I cannot divulge it freely.’ The Minister’s suspicion was slowly morphing into curiosity.
- Thanks Pansy. – Hermione sent her a small smile and walked out. Ron shook his head and followed her.
It was nearly a month into his forced cohabitation with Potter and Draco was growing increasingly tired of the situation, especially now that the bloody Chosen One insisted on keeping his eye on him to ‘make sure he wouldn’t do anything stupid’. Someone might think he started caring for the blonde all of a sudden, but Draco wasn’t an idiot – he knew all Potter was doing was ensuring that he didn’t land in hot water if a suspect in a case he was working on, the very same one he was supposed to watch over, turned up dead in his own apartment. Regardless, Potter’s incessant need to hover over Draco 24/7 was quickly getting on his last nerve.
whore.’
‘Oh, so you’re moving in together? Fantastic!’ Ginny seemed genuinely happy for them. ‘Where will you be living? I’m expecting a house warming bash and if there’s no invitation for me we’re going to have a serious problem, boys…’
Malfoy’s ploy to get information out of his father was a success, but Ron wasn’t entirely happy – the conversation they had back in Harry’s living room was still weighing on him, and now that there were no distractions in the form of suspecting Malfoy of doing anything shady (because even Ron had to admit he had been wrong multiple times about him by this point), or just purely hating the git, he realized he had to do some self-reflecting if his friendship with Harry was to survive – and he was very much set on making sure it would. So he sat there, in the office he shared with Neville, waiting for Malfoy to return from Azkaban, and started analysing why was it that he actually had that much of a problem with Harry’s new partner. Days ago, the answer would’ve been easy – he hated him and he didn’t trust him. But now, that the suspicions have been eased and Ron actually saw where Malfoy’s behaviour came from, neither of those seemed like viable options: for one, there was no reason not to trust him, and for the other, it was hard to hate him as much as Ron used to when you knew what kind of household he grew up in. Ron really didn’t like the thought, but he had to admit that if his parents were like Malfoy’s, he too would most likely turn out a miserable, bullying arsehole. And to see his reaction to what they’ve all witnessed in the pensive made Ron believe that there were in fact some human instincts and emotions inside Malfoy, it was just that they were buried by a mountain of insufferable coping mechanisms.
- I’m sorry.
kind of relationship.
not nearly as catatonic as he was all this time. In fact, he was the complete opposite. So maybe his ‘healing process’ went a little too far? He sighed. He really needed to talk this over with Hermione, she was the only one that had a chance of solving this one. He sent a quick patronus message to the office saying he’ll be at home and to get him if he was needed and apparated to Oxford.
‘Oh, we’re feeling adventurous I see…’ But he lost his train of thought the moment Harry’s tongue touched his skin. ‘Jesus,
‘…a virgin.’ Potter whispered, red-faced, looking at his lap.
‘That means a lot, actually. Thanks.’
‘Oh, you little…’ Draco didn’t finish, because his train of thought suddenly got lost in the sensation of Harry’s lips on his own and being wedged between his boyfriend’s body and the table. ‘Mmmmh, as sweet as you are, I really need to get back to this pie. If we are ever to be let out of here, we need to show my mother that we’re not going to starve to death. Otherwise, it’s living at the Manor for the rest of our lives.’ A couple of minutes and a few loud, clattering noises later Draco emerged from the pantry looking very proud of himself, holding a jar of something white. ‘I think I managed to obtain some cream!’ He exclaimed victoriously. Harry couldn’t help but laugh.
- Yeah, sure, come in. What’s going on?
‘No, no, that’s not what I’m talking about. I just need to know if Yaxley and Rowle cracking was because of the Veritaserum or if they talked on their own – my father will probably know which one was it, and I have an idea to use that, but I can’t risk blowing the whole story over this.’
- No I wouldn’t! If you told me from the start, I would’ve never touched you! I would’ve just left! What the fuck am I supposed to do now, huh?
- Well, what about me and Theo? – Draco was tensing up again.
‘Not necessarily, Malfoy. It would be fishy that you turn up out of nowhere and immediately afterwards there’s a group of people offering protection against, well, you. People are not stupid enough to not connect the dots.’
‘But you said so yourself, once he starts bleeding normally, it means the dark magic is gone, right? So there would be no interaction.’
- So you think I’m a pushover?
‘You said it, not me.’
‘God, Draco… I never knew…’
- Doors?
‘This is pointless…’ Draco sighed with resignation. ‘I have no idea what I’m doing wrong.’
‘So what, Weasley, you think me seeing a case file open is more of a problem than seeing Harry naked?’
‘What did you tell him?’
‘Literally nothing. There were incidents of performing magic in the presence of a Muggle, although we can’t track what that magic was or who performed it, the wands were either unregistered or they belonged to dead people.’
‘Can you stop saying ‘nothing’, please? Talk to me like an adult.’ Potter sat next to him.
‘You got the job! Of course, you’re not an Auror, so all the paperwork and court duties are on my head, but other than that, we work together!’
‘No, it has a paper bag inside where the dirt collects. When the bag is full you take it out, throw it out and put a fresh one.’
‘And what would they gain from implicating you? They have no interest in this.’
Oh, and also, I have no idea if using Diffindo on a human being really is that dangerous, but it seems like it might be, so it fit, so I decided to borrow this one from the HP universe rather than invent something of my own (I was briefly debating Sectumsempra, but that one was waaaaaaay too likely to just kill Draco in this scenario).
‘Sod off.’
), when the water stopped and the bathroom door opened. Draco didn’t want to look up, he really didn’t, but there he was, looking at Potter standing there, wrapped in only a towel, water still dripping from his hair. Was he always this handsome? No, he used to be a scrawny teenager for far longer than it was normal (how did Draco even notice this?). So how did he become so… manly, all of a sudden? Being an Auror would force you to get some muscles, sure, but that much? Was this just an undisclosed job perk or was Potter actually doing something to get this ripped?
‘Mr. Malfoy, I am not treating you as a suspect.’
‘You’re in a hospital, you’ve been attacked by whatever was guarding the room back at the Manor – we don’t know what happened, Ron and Neville only said that you opened the door using your blood and that it looked like something possessed you – you were completely out of it, trying to go into the room. Neville had to hold you back the entire time.’
- Draco, please… please…
When Draco opened his eyes for the second time, it was already dark outside. He sat up and noticed someone was sleeping in a chair next to his bed. Even in a half-lit room he recognized Hermione.
‘On the contrary, my dear Draco, on the contrary.’
The universe for once sent him a small smile the next day, when he found a roll of parchment on the kitchen counter in the morning.
‘Nothing. Not like I would’ve answered you anyway, you called me a twink, so now I’m pouting.’ He jokingly crossed his arms at is chest. ‘Who were you into? You never answered.’
‘You know how they used Veritaserum on Rowle and Yaxley?’ He asked.
‘Maybe, but…’ Harry didn’t know how to finish this sentence. He knew if he said what he really wanted to say, this conversation and all what they’ve built with both Draco and Narcissa, would come crumbling down.
‘So that’s what the force was…’ Draco muttered to himself. ‘But how’s Harry? What happened to him?’
- Well, if the house is your fathers and he really does throw her out, she can stay at Grimmauld Place with us. Or we can rent something small and let her keep that one. We’ll figure something out. – Harry smiled. – And besides, Hermione said there might be something that forbids this sort of thing.
‘Well, that much is evident now.’ Draco grinned and pinned Harry to the floor and laughed.
‘Harry, relax.’ To his surprise, Narcissa smiled. ‘I know what we did, I’ve made my peace with it. It doesn’t mean I don’t regret it, I probably will for the rest of my life, but I don’t want you to concern yourself with this. This is not about you, it’s about our mistakes. You’re right, neither me nor Draco ever wanted to stand by Voldemort, we just wanted a peaceful life and we just followed what Lucius believed in. If it makes sense, I stood by my husband, not by who he followed. And I know you’ve forgiven us – if you didn’t, you wouldn’t be here with Draco. And for this, I’ll be eternally grateful. Don’t even think about the press, dear – I can’t be any more hated than I already am, and if anything, if I was cynical enough to try and use you like this, I’d say that you standing by us and continuing your mission at the same time, would only be beneficial.’
‘And what did they do to you?’
- Me? Why me? Who says I’ll be the one cooking? – Harry pretended to be offended.
‘Doesn’t have to. As long as we both know what we’re getting into we should be fine.’
- I… - He couldn’t find the words. – I wanted to ask you about your work.
- Oh my God, where do you even come from? – She was laughing. – You poor thing, have you been living under a rock?
Oh, and side note: That book I was refrencing I just came up with, although Draught of Peace actually exists within the HP universe in case you wondered.
‘I think we might all benefit from a 10-minute recess. The case will be recalled.’
- You… you think about me? – He couldn’t help the redness rising to his cheeks.
‘I told you, you’re coming with me. We need your testimony.’
- That bloody fucking… - Draco was fuming. He was seeing white and all he could feel at that moment was pure rage. If anyone would approach him hight now, there would be Unforgivable Curses flying in the air. Suddenly he caught a glimpse of Harry’s frightened expression and came back. He softened instantly. – Harry, listen to me. I told you that last night and I will tell you this over and over, until I get through to you. You are normal. We are normal. There is nothing perverted about what you’re feeling. And if you need some time to figure out if this is really what you’re feeling or if I planted all of this in your head, I will give you as much space as you need, regardless of what comes out of it. Do you understand me?
‘Sure, and what I saw the other night was what? Strip poker?’
‘What does the house have to do with anything?’ Draco was starting to panic, it looked like Lucius was much more wary than he expected.
- I did. I don’t care.
‘No. For once I’m thinking clearly.’ No matter how much Draco threw up, he was still drunk, so he was in no state to stop himself from talking to Potter right now. ‘Tell me, Potter, what do I have to live for? I have nothing, I’ve been completely disgraced by what my parents did and then I took it further myself, becoming a Muggle whore…’
‘What are you getting at? You’re trying to tell me I slept with a suspect on the case?!’ Harry was losing all his composure right now.
- Don’t worry about it. The night is young. You can repay me after you’ve composed yourself. – He pulled the Gryffindor close to him. They kissed for what felt like an eternity before Harry pulled back and looked at Draco hesitantly.
The first page displayed a large, rather off-putting picture of Lucius Malfoy, under the headline:
‘That’s where the tricky part starts.’ Hermione sighed. ‘Since this is ancient dark magic, it’s based on blood. So, if everything worked as it should, you should’ve bled until all that’s left in you was your worst qualities and memories and then it should’ve closed up…’
‘No. Don’t do it. I love you, I’m not ashamed of this and I will not run because someone sees us together.’ He said calmly, quiet enough that only the Malfoys heard him. ‘We’re doing this and if someone has a problem with it, it’s theirs to deal with. I am not, and will not, be apologizing for who I’m with.’
‘What are they doing?’
- Draco, we know you have a crush on him. It’s all over your face whenever he enters the room.
‘You know what, go get some of that Muggle whisky of yours, I need a drink.’
, looking for any blurb, but there was nothing. This alone was more than enough to put him in a crappy mood, but what he found in the Sunday edition made him want to smash something in anger.
‘I don’t know. I just don’t. I have been doing things like that all my life, it just comes natural to me. With my family you learn this before you even talk.’ Draco sighed and looked at Kingsley. ‘Minister, did you find anything in there?’
‘Oh, yes, indeed I have! Three rather charming young boys came by last Friday. They told me You-Know-Who’s followers were rallying again and they were naturally up to no good, so they’ve taken it upon themselves to help out the elderly, since the Ministry is so far away from here.’ She told Ron excitedly. ‘But they demanded a little too much money for my taste so I declined. After all, I’m old anyway, I might die any moment now, so what use would it be to me?’
Deciding he needed to pace himself with the alcohol, he groaned and stood up to return to his bottle. But as soon as he turned around to leave the bathroom, he was suddenly face to face with Potter.
It was two hours later when Ron entered Harry’s office only to find his best friend crying, clutching a piece of paper. Without a word, Harry handed him the note. There was only one sentence on the card: “I decided to go for good. D.L.M.”. The world slowed down. Like through a thick, concrete wall, Ron heard Harry say “Malfoy is dead. And it’s my fault”.
‘It’s not what it looks like!’ Draco knew it was an instinct, it was cliché really, but Harry’s words burned. He was really being stupid if he thought this would mean something, wasn’t he? Not that he did, at least not consciously, but through all the amazing sensations he was going through minutes before he hoped, somewhere deep inside, that maybe, just maybe, something could come out of it. Now he knew there was never even a shred of chance for it, ever, and he was falling again, although this time it had nothing to do with pleasure – this time it was like he was pushed off a roof of one of those tall, Muggle buildings, and at the end of the fall there would be a solid, flat, unforgiving concrete. He heard the door shutting when Weasley left and stood up to go take a shower. He didn’t even want to look at Harry right now, it was too painful.
‘Well, you don’t need to use it by yourself. You can have a cleaning person and they would use it in your house.’
‘Well, not the result I hoped we would achieve…’
‘Lucius?’
Harry couldn’t sleep. At 3 a.m. he just laid there, after hours of tossing and turning, listening to Malfoy’s breathing and the sounds of owl wings swooshing behind the window. He tried to empty his mind, but it was no use, the persistent thoughts he was battling ever since the dust of the final battle has collected were back stronger than before. He never wanted this. He never wanted to be the icon, the Boy Who Lived, the Chosen One, the (he thought he heard that one somewhere, but he couldn’t place where) Two Time Survivor. He never wanted to have people gather around him, look at him as a leader. Hell, Hermione was a much better leader than he was! The only reason he was unceremoniously shoved into the role was this stupid scar on his forehead. And worse of all, he knew full well he couldn’t tell any of his friends how he felt. Ron’s assumption back in 4
‘Well, I think this plan might work. I’m impressed, Mr. Malfoy, I really am.’ Kingsley was nodding. ‘Just for the sake of the case, I am going to tell you that we did, in fact, use Veritaserum during the trials, both on Yaxley and Rowle – but it was according to all procedures.’
‘Harry found me and I thought he was going to tell everyone. I couldn’t take it, so I ran.’ Draco was just hoping that this would be enough, that Veritaserum wouldn’t make him say anything else.
‘When?’ Ron had a knowing smirk on his face.
It was two days later when Weasley showed up in Potter’s apartment. Both of them were now sitting in the kitchen arguing in hushed voices, glancing over at Draco, who was sitting on the couch going over Potter’s paperwork for the tenth time. Even though the two ex-Gryffindors were trying to be as quiet as possible, he overheard their conversation.
‘I don’t know! He popped in from time to time to check on me. Maybe he just wanted to talk or something.’
‘Nothing.’ He needed to come up with some believable excuse
- Baby, how could I? It’s all evidence of how amazing you are. And now you’re mine, all mine, and I get to be the only one to cherish these marks? – Suddenly, at the mention of marks, he looked down. His Dark Mark was clearly visible against his pale forearm, the only thing he hated about his own body. He thought he’d gladly let himself be slashed multiple times, ruining the perfection of the rest of his skin he appreciated so much, if only that would erase this hideous testament of his past. He bowed his head and tried to hide his left arm behind his back. There was no need for Harry to have to look at it, he was enough that Draco had to each morning, when he carefully wrapped his forearm in a muggle bandage to hide it.
‘I’ll do it.’ Harry sat up suddenly.
‘Bloody fucking brilliant…’ Ron muttered under his breath ‘now we have gone through all that crap in the pensive for nothing…’ Harry had a sudden inkling that, despite his choice of words, Ron meant something different than them prodding around in some of Draco’s darkest memories being a waste of time. He smiled at his best friend and raised his wand again.
- I don’t know. Point is, it was nothing compared to how I was feeling mentally and I wanted to match it. – Draco was determined to look at his feet on the bed while he spoke. Harry wrapped his arms around him and pulled him closer.
As such, Monday morning Harry decided he had to muster enough courage to talk to Ron. He got ready as quickly as possible and knocked on his ex-best friend’s bedroom door before he even got a chance to say hello to Draco. Neville opened the door.
- Harry, I love you. This last year was the happiest I’ve ever been in my entire life and it’s because of you. I don’t know how I would manage without you. The only regret I have is that I didn’t admit how I felt about you sooner. But I hope we have the whole rest of our lives to make up for it. And I hope you want to spend that rest of our lives together as much as I do. – He dropped to one knee in front of Harry, still holding his hand. – Harry James Potter, love of my life, would you do me the honour of being with you forever? Will you marry me?
- Get… off… me… - Thomas was struggling to catch air.
‘Sure. I can manage on my own for a couple of hours. Pick up some Firewhisky on the way back? Regardless of the outcome, I’ll be needing a drink.’
- Honestly, I don’t care what people think. Plus, I doubt I’ll become public enemy anyway, I’ve done enough good for the community to cut me some slack.
- If that was it, why was there light coming from under your door all night? – Nott raised his eyebrows. – Some trying-to-keep-you-alive shagging perhaps?
, but that’s how it was now – he couldn’t help it, the knowledge that Potter was in the bathroom,
‘Conspiring? Jesus…’ Draco felt like he was going to faint.
‘When I was there last time, Harry has recruited Malfoy to help him with the case. They seemed to be, I don’t know, friendly? And now he’s pissed at me for having to live with him, and from what I can tell he’s equally pissed at Malfoy…’
‘Oh, don’t be so dramatic, mother, it was…’ But suddenly Draco fell silent, whitening while looking at the cobblestone street. Harry followed his gaze.
- Come in, it’s open.
(he might be gay, he might get off on mental images of Potter, but Draco was firm on refusing to admit, even to himself, that looking at the bloody Chosen One gave him a boner – not even when all he could think of right now was his arse…
I'm sorry it took so long - I've been out of social isolation and back to working from the office instead from my own couch for the past week, so I'm having much less time to write and update than I used to. I'll try my best to update more regularly (although, in all fairness, that depends on how quickly the absolute tons of paperwork on my desk dissappear - and they seem to be sentient and grow on their own accord). I hope you forgive me!
The inside of room 20 was dimly lit and very different to the rest of the parlour. Where other girls preferred to decorate their quarters in red or pink, Yasmine opted for a rich, moss green with silver accents. Both the matron and Jeanelle found it a little out of the ordinary, but the clients seemed to like it and it somehow weirdly suited the thin blonde. It made her look like a forest fairy or a nymph, Jeanelle thought, if forest fairies or nymphs were real.
- Chill out. If we let it slip it’s you, Slughorn would know Pansy lied to him. And we can’t have that. – Yes, this was the argument he was going to present to his friends. There was no need for them to know the true reason.
‘What are you talking about?’ Harry was confused as to what on Earth Lucius’ letter from a month ago had to do with anything.
There was a sudden rumble and everyone stood up. Draco realized that the verdict was going to be announced.
, waiting to disappear completely.
‘I like you in black, but you definitely look way hotter naked…’ Harry climbed up, whispering in his ear. Draco felt the weight of the other body pressing him down and thought briefly that he could stay like this forever, just lying there, feeling Harry on him. ‘You want this?’
- I’m not. I’m merely trying to provide you with the opportunity to speak your peace once and for all, without the danger of getting attacked, however justly, by my fellow Slytherins. – For the first time since they came back Malfoy seemed like his old self.
‘Fine, Malfoy, let’s start easy. Were you a part of that snatcher gang?’
‘WHAT?!’ Ron looked utterly shocked and Neville almost fell over. Harry’s face was a mixture of fury and horror.
The ex-Slytherins were sitting by the Great Lake in the last rays of end-of-the-summer sunshine before autumn would inevitably take over. They were supposed to study together, but somehow all of their books laid discarded on the grass and the students were deep in conversation.
‘Well, to be honest, it
‘Thank you, Mr. Shush.’ Kingsley said. ‘If that’s the case, which of the distinguished judges are in favour of granting the motion?’ Several hands were now raised in the air. Harry couldn’t count if it was over half or not, but Kingsley was already tallying up the vote. ‘The motion passes. Mr. Potter, will you please take the witness stand? And Mr. Malfoy, you will be escorted out for the time being.’
- You’ll what? Curse me? As I recall you tried to do that once before and I didn’t end well. For you obviously. Feeling in the mood for some slugs again I see? – Harry wasn’t sure how he felt about Draco’s attitude when he said those words. On one hand, Ron deserved this for all the shit he’s been giving them lately, but seeing Draco so easily snap back to his old self was unsettling.
And that something, for better or worse, came a week after their love confessions.
Somehow, all the emotions Draco thought he’d left behind him in recent days, came back. He was sitting there, on Potter’s windowsill, at 2 in the morning, smoking a Muggle cigarette (how exactly did it happen? He used to be a proud Slytherin and now he somehow managed to go through all the vices he could think of in a span of a month…), wearing some abominable creation he’s been supplied with (‘sweatpants’, was it?), battling a string of confusing thoughts and images that had no place to even be in his brain, let alone resurface like that.
‘Oh, hi, good evening.’ Draco couldn’t decipher what her expression was. ‘How are you feeling? Does it still hurt?’
‘I need to see him!’
They all laughed. When they finally arrived at Waterloo station some 90 minutes later, Narcissa was looking a bit apprehensive.
‘Yeah, me too. This doesn’t make any sense.’
‘Don’t get any ideas. I may think you’re innocent and just trying to help, but Ron doesn’t trust you. Now, are we doing this?’
So there he was. On Potter’s couch somewhere in London, wishing he was dead. He has never gone that far in his spiral. In the Muggle world, he was determined to do whatever it took to survive, to build himself a new life – even after he thought everyone knew what he had become, there was still a chance to hide somewhere and avoid the judgement of the community. And once he did run, he found solace in the drugs – they kept his own mind dulled down, making it impossible to dwell on what his whole life turned into, even if he wanted to (not that he did, he wasn’t a masochist). But now he was forced to resurface from his exile, stripped not only of any dignity that might have lingered somewhere adjacent to him (because it for sure didn’t feel like it was in him), but also from the only thing that somehow help him just exist out there in the world (after all, what he had out there, in the middle of nowhere in Scotland, could hardly be classified as ‘life’). There was nothing left for him here – even if he was to disregard his most current state and not count the pathetic Draco Malfoy-shaped vessel he’d been reduced to, his future didn’t exactly seem that much more optimistic. He was either going to be found guilty of being a part of some scheme he had nothing to do with and sentenced to Azkaban, or he was going to be declared innocent and let go – but to where exactly? Once again, he had no place to live and nothing to his name. Scotland was out of the question, now that Weasley knew where to find him, and going back to the Muggle world didn’t seem like much of an option either – his encounter with Potter taught him it was far too easy to be found there. Once again, he was treated to a memory of what Weasley said the other day: last year Potter apparently wanted to help him. He scoffed – like that would be a viable option! No, there was no chance. He refused to sink any further and accept charity (
‘So, you take this en-something-or-other in school and you’re qualified to make a giant metal contraption and send it to the skies wit people inside? Are all Muggles suicidal?’
Harry nodded and left, and Draco was suddenly feeling weird about how that conversation ended, like there was something
- How do you even know it’s Draco? – Harry was desperately hoping everyone would just stop being so sure they know what they’ve heard.
- God… more… - Harry was quickly losing his composure.
- Oh, I think I know what you mean! I read about it in a Muggle psychology book! – Hermione exclaimed excitedly.
look to Draco and was happy to see him loosening up considerably.
‘I hope you’re right…’ Ron seemed sceptical.
Malfoy has been dead for over a year now and – regardless of the efforts both Ron and Hermione put into yanking Harry out of a trance-like state he’s been in ever since reading the letter from Draco – Harry was still absent-minded most days, like the mourning he’s been going through coated him with a thick, greasy layer of tar, rendering him completely separated from the outside world and irresponsive to anything around him. In fact, the biggest display of still being alive they’ve got from him came on the anniversary of Malfoy’s death (or what Ron considered as such, since they didn’t really have any sort of indication when it exactly happened), when all three of them were sitting in the kitchen of Ron and Hermione’s house on the outskirts of Oxford.
‘There is nothing to tell! I got it, I saw Ginny is getting married, I haven’t even bothered to check who her fiancé is, I got upset and went out. When I came back, you were there.’
‘WHAT? Draco, no! You can’t do this!’ Harry was mortified. He knew Ron and he knew this was the worst idea ever.
- No.
‘I’m still not convinced it’s better than having a house elf…’
- Maybe you’re right… How bad is he?
- I know. But he has had it rough enough. It’s not like he’d be coming back to the life he had, that one’s long gone and nobody can do anything about it. But I was thinking, maybe if someone helped him out, he could rebuild himself, you know? Everyone deserves a second chance. I’m not talking about becoming friends with him all of a sudden, just giving him a place here and letting him get back on his feet on his own.
‘Ginny, I didn’t do it! Please, you have to believe me! I wasn’t even there!’
- Honestly, it’s like you two never read anything besides school books… - Hermione sighed. – What I mean is, if your parents haven’t signed any agreement when they got married, whatever each of them had then, and acquired later, remains theirs and theirs only. For example, if your mother had some gold to her name the day of the wedding, that gold doesn’t belong to your father and he has no say over this. Then, if she, let’s say, inherited…
Malfoy, on the other hand, was as far from things not mattering and being ok as you could possibly get. He just couldn’t believe how dense his friends were being ever since his last confrontation with Potter.
- Oh, I see. And you thing that 10 minutes of stacking shelves warrants a loaf of bread, boy? – The man laughed. – Look, I haven’t a clue where you come from, but here you work for what you eat. Tell you what, you sweep my store and clean the back room and I’ll think about it.
It took Draco nearly a minute to come back to his senses. The high of the orgasm was so intense that he didn’t see or hear anything until it subsided. But once it did and Draco started registering his surroundings again, his heart sank. He knew in an instant he went too far. Harry was still facing away from him, but by now his arms were dropped to his sides and his head was resting on the tiled wall. He was shaking. Draco knew all too well that it wasn’t a good sign. He tried wrapping his boyfriend in his arms, whispering “Oh God, baby, I’m so sorry, I never should’ve… Oh God, please, baby, forgive me… Please…” but Harry only tensed at the contact. Draco felt like a monster. He knew he fucked it all up.
‘It fits, Draco, it does! Look here, at the bottom!’ Suddenly, Potter’s side was on top of Draco’s thigh, pressing firmly in as Potter leaned forward to show him something. It took all of Draco’s willpower to focus on what Potter was saying. ‘The woman said she has seen you several times in that field, right? We know what you were doing there, but the only reason she would be there at the same time would be that she was doing the same thing!’
- How are you feeling, sweetheart? – Draco asked, slowly drifting back down to Earth.
‘But he wants all his influence back. He used to be a very powerful person, don’t forget that. And after the war he lost most of that influence. My guess is he wants to go back to where he was before, and a big job in the Ministry would be a good way to do that.’
- It sounds like it’s a lot to handle for you. I know how it feels. I’ve went through the same process since Thursday. But… - He hesitated. He really shouldn’t say anything else. Admitting how he truly felt right then and there wouldn’t do any good.
- I never want you to feel that way again, Draco. I can’t even imagine it. I love you, you love me, we’re supposed to be happy, not hurt like that. And we will be. – It was the cue everyone else needed to leave. After they’ve shut the door behind them, Harry and Draco were left in the darkness, falling asleep holding each other like their lives depended on it. To both of them, they actually did.
- No, it’s not that. It’s what you said about them knowing who you are. I just never realized until now that we hadn’t talked about past relationships…
– Do you know what exactly he took? – Draco handed her Potter’s list with a blank expression. The longer Pansy’s eyes followed the note, the more it seemed like they were going to pop out of their sockets. It would be a comical sight if not for the gravity of the situation. – Holy bloody fuck! Is he suicidal?!
- I’m a dom, yes.
- Yeah, sure, you tell yourself that. And the Dark Mark is just a neat tattoo idea, right?
‘Nothing in particular. Just saw some obnoxious couple at the bus stop.’
‘I think we best stick to canned cream for now, Draco…’ He said when he managed to compose himself. ‘That way we at least know what we’re eating.’
- You’re hogging the bathroom again! – Sweet merciful Merlin, this whining was infuriating.
year when everyone thought he was the Heir of Slytherin), and Gryffindors were flat out accusing him of being a traitor. Saturday evening Harry overheard Ron loudly complaining to Seamus.
Harry and Draco didn’t talk for the next couple of days, each one lost in their own thoughts. Draco was too afraid to tell Harry what conclusion he reached sitting in the common room (once again, behaving like a bloody coward, he thought glumly) and Harry was too busy trying to figure out what it was he was thinking really. He didn’t accomplish much by Tuesday evening, when Draco stood in the doorway looking at him worriedly.
For the remainder of the lesson everyone was working in silence. Hermione was white as a ghost and seemed so panicked that her potion ended up looking like concrete at the bottom of her cauldron. Harry abandoned his completely – he couldn’t concentrate anyway. By the time Slughorn came back to inspect their work only Draco and Pansy have achieved a satisfying result.
- You’ve been there for half an hour already! When am I supposed to wake up, at bloody 3 a.m.?!
‘See? It’s not so terrifying, people are warming up to us!’ Harry ruffled Draco’s hair laughing.
‘I wouldn’t call it ‘living together’, honestly. We’re just stuck in my apartment for the time being. But anyway, we talked a couple of times, but nothing extensive or deep.’
‘Maybe…’ Harry laughed. ‘And I never said I wasn’t gay, you just assumed it because you know I’ve slept with women.’
‘Really? Because it sure seems like a very
It didn’t take long for Ron to bring him the first piece of news. It was Wednesday evening when he Floo’d over to Harry’s living room.
‘You don’t actually believe this, do you? For one, it’s Lucius bloody Malfoy – he’s scheming, he’s conniving, he’s…’ Ron waved his arms ‘a
‘You’re crossing the line here, mate…’ Ron’s voice sounded a little threatening. ‘Anyway, I wanted to come here and tell you we took the ‘magic in front of a Muggle’ cases from the police and we’re monitoring this ourselves, and now that I’ve done it, I’m leaving.’
- Say what, why don’t you take me the same way I took you and then we’ll think about having some more fun if you’re up for it? – Draco had to concentrate all his energy on not shoving his boyfriend’s face into the pillow and fucking him into the mattress.
Draco wanted to tell him that he won’t, that he could never leave him alone ever again, but a knock on the door stopped him.
- Is it bad that I haven’t?
‘We found traces of undisturbed dark magic, but we couldn’t exactly go looking for the source without assistance, could we?’ Ron was getting annoyed.
Harry was sitting in his office, burying himself in paperwork, when a small ‘pop’ of apparition, followed by a string of curse words, shot him upright. Ron has appeared in the middle of the room, his hand firmly holding the wrist of some unknown man. The man was trying to get out of Ron’s grip muttering derogatory terms under his breath. The whole scene looked rather surreal – in Harry’s experience, if someone didn’t want to be taken along by apparition, they would usually try and hex the person kidnapping them immediately upon landing, but this particular man looked more subdued – his movements were slow, like there was a thick layer of invisible jelly surrounding him, and even his constant verbal attack towards Ron seemed strangely calm, like he knew that was what he was supposed to be doing but wasn’t really in the mood for it. Ron had no trouble forcing the man into a chair at Harry’s desk. As soon as he was forced to sit, the man calmed down, like even pretending to try and run away drained him, and looked at him with a confusingly amused expression. Just as their eyes locked, Harry’s blood turned to ice.
- “Someone” like me? – Malfoy interrupted, raising his brows
stupid, Potter. There has to be something else.’ Suddenly, an idea sprung to his mind. ‘Do you have any reports on what happened in those locations days before they showed up? They might just travel around the country following events they didn’t cause and using them.’
‘This is my main concern right now.’ Hermione shook her head. ‘If there is nothing to replenish, because there is no loss, I’m not sure what good that will do.’
- Good… I think…
‘Ron’s right.’ Harry said bitterly. ‘Lucius Malfoy is the new Chief of Aurors, even if this is not his official title, and it will stay that way.’
‘You can do this, and you will. You have to. Besides, at least you know how this things go, you’ve seen it first-hand.’
‘I don’t know. Desperation? Pain? You being into me?’
‘Why you tasted like cherries the other day.’ He said quietly.
I was only two nights later when Ron spotted a tall, slender figure at the edge of the field. The woman was right – whoever this was, they certainly looked like they were alarmingly malnourished and sick. Observing the person, Ron determined that there was next to impossible for it to be Malfoy – there was no way he would look this bad, not even after almost two years in exile. Malfoy was a wizard, after all, and a pretty good one at that, no matter how much Ron didn’t like to admit it, so with his skillset he would surely figure out a way to at least obtain some food in survivable quantities. No, this person looked like they’ve been living off of the bare minimum and it showed – their skin had a nasty, ashy-green tinge and their chest and stomach (starkly visible in the moonlight, because the person was wearing only torn-up Muggle jeans that were clearly several sizes too big) were so wasted Ron could practically see the heartbeat through. When the person turned around and faced Ron (still invisible under his Disillusionment Charm) his (Ron has determined that the person was a male) face was sunken in, like the skin was stretched over the bode directly, without any muscles or fat in between. His eyes appeared bigger than they should, with heavy, dark bags underneath that looked almost black in contrast to the impossibly pale complexion. The only indication that the person was a living human being and not an Inferius were the lips – still full and red, slightly parted as he muttered something unintelligible under his breath, picking some herbs, arms elbow-deep in the tall grass.
‘I figured there would have to be some protection against lifting the spells from the outside. Or by people they’re designed to keep out. I just didn’t know what protection exactly. This one, I haven’t seen it before.’
- Told you, you can’t know. Point is, I behaved like a monster and I had to step back not to do it again, because I’m apparently completely unable co control myself. And now I’m here with you, Harry is alone for all I know, and I don’t know how to go on from here.
‘No, she was there collecting ingredients!’ Potter was all hyped up now, he didn’t even seem to notice how close he was to Draco. ‘I mean, what Muggle would run around in a field in the middle of the night picking up herbs? The snatchers had to have seen it and they had to make the same conclusion!’
‘An Auror, here? It must be serious! Come follow me, I’ll make you a cup of tea and we’ll talk, you look half-frozen, dear!’ When they reached the house, Ron sat down in an armchair and looked intently at the woman. He cleared his throat and spoke.
‘Chief of Aurors, Holland, is retiring. And guess who secured himself a position to oversee the Office until a new Chief is found?’
‘I just know.’
- He’s un-fucking-believable! – Draco burst. – Does he really think that I want to have any connection to him whatsoever? Is he really so deluded that he still thinks that being a Malfoy would get me ahead anywhere? – Their friends fell silent at the outburst, looking at the pair worriedly. – I don’t give a shit what he thinks of me, he’s been convicted to life, he can’t do anything to me! Can he even make any decisions about the money from inside Azkaban?
- What is it? – He asked. There was nothing in his voice that would indicate any sort of emotion.
‘Why?’
‘So… so you’re both ok with this?’
‘How did you know about Veritaserum in the office? Only a few people knew.’
He groaned, resting his head on his desk. If he was prepared to be honest with himself, he would conclude that it was simply because anything was better than going back to his cold and empty apartment (he bought a small studio near the Waterloo East train station about a year prior). Ever since the war ended, he felt alone. Ron was happily married to a very pregnant Hermione, while he and Ginny had a falling out – the demons of war were too much for her to handle so they split and by now she was engaged to Dean Thomas and Harry was all alone.  He tried to find someone, following Hermione’s advice, but every woman he met seemed to only be interested in being Mrs. Potter, not actually Harry’s wife. It was frustrating and discouraging, so a few months ago Harry turned to fulfilling his carnal desires with Muggle prostitutes – that way, he could be whoever he wanted to be, without the burden of being The Chosen One, and he didn’t even need to change his appearance that much – he only needed to conceal his scar, which was tricky at first, but with time he became quite proficient at it. Harry sighed and packed up his things. It was no use sitting there at his desk anymore. He knew he had a lot of work to do the following day, so he decided to apparate straight into his bedroom and go to sleep.
- Yeah, she’s in our room snogging Wesley. I had to get out of there. – She made a disgusted face. – Draco, what are you still doing lying down? Up with you!
- I said don’t talk to me. – Harry stopped yelling, but his voice became as cold as Malfoy’s. – But since you’re so clearly desperate to know what I really think of you, here we go: you’re a pathetic excuse of a human being…
- Oh God, you’re both insufferable! – Pansy groaned. – Not even a year together and you’re arguing like a married couple!
He rolled his eyes and began analysing everything that happened since he was marked by Voldemort. He had done it countless times before, but this time it was from a different perspective, so it took some time and effort. By the time he heard Pansy’s knocking on the door 20 minutes later, he reached the conclusion that he did, in fact, have feelings for Harry (somehow, just like a couple of days before, he couldn’t bring himself to refer to the ex-Gryffindor as “Potter”, not even in his own head). But what was he going to do about it? That would have to wait, for now there were more important matters at hand.
- I said don’t lie. If you don’t tell me what’s going on by yourself, I can make you do that. – Potter was furious by now. – Oh, but I suppose you already know that, don’t you?
‘Why are you going on about this? I don’t know what happened! I wasn’t there! And why does it have to be you investigating this case anyway, aren’t there more Aurors? Or is your father still hellbent on making me as miserable as possible after all the shit he’s already pulled telling everyone something happened during the war?’
‘Ginny…’ Harry whispered, standing up. He looked at her in the pale moonlight seeping through the window: she looked seriously ill – pale and thin, with heavy bags under her eyes. ‘Ginny, I’m so sorry…’
‘You have to be seventeen to drive if I remember correctly. Why are you asking? You want to learn?’ Harry was intrigued by his boyfriend’s sudden interest in driving.
And so, following his best friend’s request to be left alone, a month later Ron was by himself on an assignment somewhere in the middle of nothing in northern Scotland. He was tracking a particularly tricky band of snatchers that seemed to specialize in convincing elderly wizards that they needed their (obviously paid) protection because Death Eaters were on the rise again – ridiculous idea, Ron concluded, given that most of them were either in Azkaban or dead, but nevertheless it was a matter to be dealt with, and since it proved to be too difficult for the ordinary magical police force, the task fell to the Auror Office, no matter how much beneath his skillset and job description Ron found it.
His eyes fell to the nightstand beside Malfoy’s bed. In the pale moonlight he could just about decipher what was written on the cover of a book Malfoy’s been reading lately – “Practical use of advance medical potions”. He decided that anything would be better than staring at the ceiling, so he grabbed the book, whispered “Lumos” and began skimming it. He was almost halfway through the book when he discovered a chapter entitled “Anxiety and Insomnia Relief”. It peaked his interest. He read through the list of Potions carefully, although if he was honest with himself he didn’t really understand much. The only name he recognized was Draught of Peace, although he didn’t quite remember where he heard about it.
‘To die. Well, not quite, it was beyond dying, it was like I was supposed to go there to make it like I never existed at all. And then I thought that the room sort of came to me and I was vanishing away…’
It took them at least 30 minutes to achieve something even remotely similar to what the picture in the book showed. And by that point, hey had what they estimated roughly to be enough dough for at least four pies. Nevertheless, Draco found a pie tin, lined it with their (rather abysmal, he concluded) creation and threw it into the oven. He was determined to make this work, even if it meant running out of all the necessary ingredients. His determination quickly received a swift blow, however, when he turned his attention to what was supposed to be whipped cream by now. It turned out the white substance hasn’t changed whatsoever.
- No, I like working with you. I was just scared I won’t have anybody to work with. Pansy scares me, I’d rather avoid her.
‘And you want me to order Mr. Malfoy to be sent to Azkaban for an indefinite amount of time until you find this band of snatchers and manage to confirm Mr. Malfoy’s involvement?’
- Oh, judging by the conversation we all heard, there might just be something there. – Pansy proclaimed in a sing-song voice.
How in Merlin’s name was Harry going stir crazy (and drinking!) his fault anyway? Contrary to what his best friend said, there was no logic behind this particular chain of events. The fact that Malfoy was stuck there by Shacklebolt was in no way caused by Ron. He even suggested sending the git into Azkaban! And it’s not his fault that Shacklebolt chose Harry over him – he does have a wife and a kid at home, so keeping a drug-addicted ex-Death Eater there would be entirely irresponsible. Even Hermione agreed with him when he told her the story. And she said that maybe living with Malfoy for a while would give Harry a chance to shake off whatever happened last year between the two of them. And it seemed like it worked, all right, because Harry was
Pansy sighed.
‘Harry, you really need to try and go back to normal.’ Hermione was (yet again) trying to convince Harry to go see a therapist.
‘It’s not about drinking. I just realized that everyone is moving on and I’m stuck at home, so I started thinking that maybe it’s time to get back out into the world again…’
It was all a haze. Draco wasn’t even sure he really heard what he thought he heard. He was trying to compose himself enough for any sort of reaction, when a sheepish voice brought him out of his trance: “Draco, can you hug me?”. He wrapped his arms tightly around Harry resting his chin on top of the Gryffindor’s head. All was good in the world. There might, after all, be a chance for some happiness.
- As a matter of fact, I was trying to save your sorry ass. You don’t remember lying here for almost 3 hours now, barely conscious?
Things happen, elf wine is involved and well... smut ensues.
- Well, ok. – Harry sighed, searching for the right words. – You know how I was hiding all summer?
‘There is. That’s why I said we need Muggle technology. Muggles do this thing called transfusion where they put someone else’s blood in you. Of course, it’s complicated, you need to take blood types into account…’ She hesitated. ‘And we don’t know what type of outcome this would have on wizard blood since there is also magical abilities to be considered… Plus, the physiology is different, so I’m not sure if the blood type issue still applies there… And you haven’t lost any blood…’
over a cup of coffee.
if he tried hard enough to forget about all the other stuff.
On his end, Draco was equally as shocked, although he quickly composed himself to hide it. There was absolutely no reason to antagonise Harry right now with snarky questions. He smiled unsurely and waited for a reaction. To his relief Harry smiled back. Draco pulled back and sat, once again, at the foot of the bed, facing Harry.
- Yes, I’m aware. But why are you thinking about Malfoy all of a sudden?
‘I’m not having a problem with you and him! Do whatever you want, you can shag in the office for all I care.’ Ron shrugged. ‘What I do have a problem with is you somehow convincing everyone around you that him working here is a good idea.’
‘Like my hunches ever bothered you before! What’s gotten into you all of a sudden?!’
There was complete silence at the table. Harry was stroking Draco’s hair, while the Weasleys and Hermione were looking at their own hands. After a while, Draco wiped his tears and spoke again.
‘It does sound reasonable, Mr. Potter. Now, I shouldn’t really be even asking this, since it’s going to be an order, but – Mr. Malfoy, are you willing to comply by this arrangement?’
- Don’t speak on things of which you don’t know anything, I’m warning you. – Draco was snarling by now. For a brief second Harry was scared of him.
- Sure, no problem. I’ll go tell Yasmine to get ready. Meet me outside no. 20 in 10 minutes and I’ll introduce you two. – Jeanelle smiled and rushed off.
‘I told you, I don’t know.’ Harry sighed. ‘I just have this feeling that something is off. Will you tell me if anything weird starts popping up?’
- Oh God, how do I explain it if you haven’t realized this by yourself already…? – Draco was talking more to himself now than he did to Harry. – Ok, I’m just going to say this, but you have to promise me that you will not freak out and you will allow me to explain this as well as I can before you come to any rash conclusions, ok? Can you do that for me?
- Are you sure? You can stop me any time. I will not force you to do anything that doesn’t feel good to you.
- For the love of God, don’t tell me you took it all at once…
‘I don’t know. We’re not a couple, but there is something, at least when we’re drunk. So it doesn’t seem like we’re exactly just friends either.’
Draco pulled himself together.
- Well, I… - Harry wasn’t sure just how much he wanted to tell his friends about the previous night. If it was just Hermione he might be able to spill everything, but with Ron there it wasn’t as easy. – I kind of have a problem.
‘No idea. Probably standard Ministry seals.’ Neville shrugged. Harry started lifting the enchantments.
‘You. What would happen to you if they convicted me. I realized that if I’m found guilty, there was no way you would have no problems because of that.’
- Oh, you mean your outburst at Weasel? For what it’s worth, we found it exceptionally amusing. – Pansy grinned at him. – Who knew a couple of days with Draco would turn you into a Slytherin?
It was almost midday when Harry, after getting a reluctant ‘go ahead’ from Ron and a considerably more enthusiastic one from the Minister himself, finally forced Draco to get off the couch and put on some mostly-appropriate clothes – they’ve both been living in sweatpants almost the entire time they were quarantined off in Harry’s apartment, and Draco didn’t exactly bring any luggage with him, so, having to improvise, they landed on an all-black (‘because what other colour would Draco Malfoy wear?’ Harry thought and chuckled) outfit comprising of jeans, a t-shirt and a leather jacket. Draco tried to protest, saying this was entirely inappropriate for the situation, but Harry knew he was just stalling. He fixed the size of the clothes (since they were his own, they were way too short and way too wide on their own), grabbed the blonde’s wrist and apparated them straight into his office.
- Your feelings towards Potter. – Pansy looked like she wanted to hide.
‘…but you’re afraid how would it look? You being with Draco, while is father is in Azkaban and I’ve been accused, and hunting down what was considered our side?’ Harry had to admit it, Narcissa was really a marvellous psychologist.
‘And I told you I’m not coming.’ Malfoy tried to reach for his wand, but he wasn’t quick enough. Ron jumped forward, grabbed his wrist and apparated them both straight into the office he shared with Harry.
If he was able to in his current state, Harry would cry. The thought of Draco dying terrified him more than his own prospects of death. Selfishly, Harry thought that this might be the worst possible time for that to happen – he still wasn’t fully able to convince the blonde he wasn’t lying when he told him he loved him, but there were a few moments back during the assignment that made him hope that maybe his declarations were somehow going through. After all, Draco did let him take his hand at the gate – he wouldn’t do that is he at least partially didn’t believe him.
…’ He didn’t even think it was possible, but that last word sent Harry even further into a high. He was moaning, head thrown back onto Draco’s shoulder as he thrusted repeatedly sucking Harry’s neck.
‘I don’t know, you needed to justify why you’re still operating after the war?’ Draco laughed.
‘You mean
- Wait, can you explain this like a normal human being please? – Draco was irritated, but intrigued. – What’s “joined ownership of assets” and what about the house?
‘Identification spells.’ Neville answered.
‘Fantastic!’ Harry was really happy for Draco. ‘Know what department you want to go into yet?’
‘So you’re…’ He still wasn’t looking up at Draco ‘…gay?’
He knew he was screwed the moment he opened the bathroom door and saw Potter standing there (fully clothed, thank God!) looking rather worried.
‘Not nearly.’ Ron looked like he regretted saying this. But he too drank the potion, so there was nothing he could do about it.
This was definitely not going to be an easy year.
- But… but why? What happened? – Pansy was stunned. Draco sighed and looked at Harry. It was clear there was an incredible pain in his eyes.
‘Yeah, and your state right now is certainly
- Are you BLIND?! It’s obvious! Malfoy’s a bloody pervert! He clearly messed with your head trying to get you to sleep with him! He wants to tie you up or whatever his degenerate brain came up with and fuck you!
Harry knew that Ginny wasn’t going to wait for him forever, but it stung nonetheless. He thought that after almost five years the news of her and someone else getting married (he didn’t even bother reading her fiancé’s name on the wedding invitation, it wasn’t important) would be bearable, but it still hurt to know she, like everyone else, has moved on, while he was stuck inside his home. He sighed and stood up – maybe it was time to slowly come back out again? In any case, he decided that he needed a drink and that this time, he was going out. By himself, because he still didn’t feel like being around other people, but out nonetheless. He got dressed, locked the door, and decided to apparate into Hog’s Head.
‘And that is exactly why we’re taking you under our wing, dear!’ Molly exclaimed. ‘You seem like you could use some warmth, if you’ll forgive my expression. Now, I don’t know what you’ve been fed with so far, but you’re starting to look thinner than Harry and we cannot let you go on like that!’ Everyone laughed. Harry sent an
‘So the rumours are true, then? You and… him? You really are getting married?’
- I have not caused anything. As you know, since you were apparently the expert on everything during my trial, I was cleared of all charges. I haven’t done anything that would warrant punishment last year and before that I was not an adult. And besides, repairing a cabinet is not a crime.
‘No!’ Neville shrieked. ‘What about you? We’ll need to save you!’
‘They did?’ Draco felt strangely proud of himself.
- Because I live with him, everyone but us is asleep, and if he’s found stone cold in our room, it’s going to look like I poisoned him! – His patience was running low. There was a literal life-and-death situation and his bloody supposed friends were more keen on discussing possible criminal repercussions than helping! – Guys, can either of you go now? Please? I’ll stay with Potter just to monitor what’s going on.
, in part), keeping Draco close to him was somehow a better option than distancing himself from him completely. Sure, it hurt to know they would never be as close as Harry would like - some days it seemed like an unbearably painful burden in fact - but Harry knew that if they were to never see each other again, he would feel the same as when he thought Draco was dead, and he wasn’t willing to go through that again. So he chose this particular version of suffering, just because of those rare moments the two of them smiled at each other or joked, because it felt like he could just about pretend that they were
- I didn’t want to be. – Harry sounded frustrated and exhausted by the idea itself. – Everyone wanted something form me, wanted opinions, wanted input. You know, like at the trials, when they asked me if you and your mother should be exonerated. I’m not a lawyer for fuck’s sake! How should I know? I told them so, I told them I can only speak of what I saw, that you weren’t willing to kill Dumbledore, you were forced into it, and that your mother was the one that lied to him to get me back to the castle.
– his brain reminded him of what Potter said. Yeah, like he was ever going to have sex again after what being Yasmine put him through. No, this was the last thing he wanted. He shook his head. It was no use opening that particular can of worms, he was feeling bad enough already. He was feeling strangely proud of his ability to compartmentalize his struggles – if he wasn’t able to put everything he ever went through into neat little boxes and shove them to the very bottom of his brain, he wouldn’t have survived this long. Especially since all he could do otherwise was to dwell on them over and over again, because there wasn’t anybody to even talk it all through with. Like a boomerang, the word
- Can I talk to you? – His heart was pounding, his throat was dry and his head was spinning, but he knew what he had to do.
They cuddled for a while and then got up to take a shower together. To both of them it seemed more intimate than just casting a cleaning spell. No, a cleaning spell sounded like something you would do after a one night stand, in a relationship a shower seemed more appropriate.
‘Why would you want to work there then? If you suspected that’s what we did.’
- Ron, please, don’t. Slughorn will return any minute, you’ll get detention for challenging someone in the middle of class… - Hermione was a little too practical in this situation for Harry’s taste.
‘What?’ By the expression on his face, Ron was afraid.
‘I think this will do! Although, I’m not sure I’m quite ready for making the knife cut by itself, I think it’s safer if I do this by hand…’ It took only a couple of seconds before he cursed loudly enough to alarm half the town. ‘Fuck, I’ve cut myself! How do Muggles even do this and still have all of their fingers?!’
‘But who? You?’ Ron looked up from the paper. ‘You’ve been off the grid for three years now, you’re not bothering anyone and you’re not a threat to Malfoy.’
we have sex though? I mean, have you thought about it? Ever?’ Was that hope or fear? Harry couldn’t decipher.
‘Why do you remember, anyway?’
– there was that voice again, the very same one that pointed out that Yasmine didn’t exist –
- Oh, I’ll fight you all right. Good practice for when I’ll be hunting down your friends. And as an added bonus, one less Death Eater to worry about later. – Ron was as tall as Draco, so when they were standing face to face with only a narrow table between them, neither was intimidating the other.
‘Which was…?’ Draco wasn’t sure he really wanted an answer to that, but he went too far to backtrack from the conversation now.
‘And what would it take for you to believe us?’
‘Something must have happened. But what?’
‘He is not my boyfriend. There is nothing between us.’
That was not what Harry just got worried about. Somehow the whole topic of past relationships slipped out of his mind completely until now. Of course Draco has had boyfriends before, that was obvious, but up until that point, the thought hadn’t registered with Harry. He was rapidly approaching panic mode. What now? Did Draco suspect that he was his first serious partner, let alone boyfriend? How would Harry tell him that? Will he back out if he knows? And what about sex? It was safe to assume that Draco’s first time was long gone, but Harry was still a virgin and he wasn’t even sure how sex between two guys was supposed to look like. That last thought caused a bitter chuckle. He was 18, by all means an adult, and his whole sexual education were crude jokes tossed around the Gryffindor dorm and some magazines he found in the cupboard under the stairs back at Dursleys when he was moving out – all of that obviously very heterosexual. He was screwed. It was Draco’s worried voice that snapped him back to reality.
‘And why would the timing of Mr. Malfoy’s questioning change anything? Not that I object to the idea, frankly, it makes no difference to me, but I’m just curious as to what motivates you right now.’
‘Ok, fine, I’m sorry. I’ll go slower.’ Harry smiled reassuringly. ‘Where did you get lost?’
- Hey, just because I’ve now poured my heart out to you doesn’t mean you’re free to insult my friends! – He didn’t really look that angry. Draco registered that Harry agreed with him, even though he didn’t want to admit it flat out.
‘Actually, Minister…’ Ron cleared his throat. ‘I do still have my suspicions about them, and this is, after all, our case, so I think it would be better if I did it.’ Harry was quickly getting angry. What was Ron playing at?
‘Harry, relax.’ Draco stood next to him and placed his hand on Harry’s shoulder. ‘It’s normal they wouldn’t trust me with this, it is… well, was… my house. Minister,’ he looked Kingsley directly in the eyes ‘I’m prepared to do whatever you need me to. Legilimency, Veritaserum, I’m open to anything.’
. Once again, he has single-handedly managed to fuck things up for Harry. Why did he have to come tonight? It was past midnight already and he has a wife and a child, why would he decide it was a good time to fill Shacklebolt’s instruction? Harry never counted on anything happening between him and Draco, he wasn’t stupid, but if Ron hadn’t decided he needed to bring the wand back tonight, maybe Harry would have a chance to at least make those images, that were coming to his head any time he looked at Draco, a reality, just for one night. But now it was over – Draco was in the shower, clearly already regretting what had happened between them, and Harry knew there would be no other chance. They weren’t going to be living together for much longer, and once Draco was out of his apartment, no matter if he decided to take Harry up on his offer to give him keys to Grimmauld Place, it wasn’t like they were close enough to justify doing anything ever again.
Harry sighed. All his hope for a safe and quiet Friday afternoon went out the window. He reached for a Transfiguration book to get started on his homework, but it was no use. It was already almost midnight and his mind was racing yet again, so he knew he would accomplish nothing. He’d have to copy off of Hermione’s (obviously already done) essay tomorrow. He sighed again, shook his head, and left his friends without a word to go to bed.
- That’s not pathetic. – Draco’s expression was unreadable. – You’re not a freak.
‘Yeah, I do.’ There was something in his voice that Harry couldn’t understand.
‘Certainly, dear! I see him very often in the field by the forest – if you follow the same road we met on you’ll find the correct one, it’s around a mile from here. If you want to catch him, you best camp out there around midnight – sometimes he comes out then and sometimes I notice him at dawn, so you might to spend the night there. He’s tall, very thin, like he’s hardly eating anything, and pale – very, very pale. Oh, and he has blonde hair, almost white, but a little more silverish. Really, he would be quite handsome if he didn’t look like he was halfway to death…’ She continued on, but Ron’s mind was spinning. No, it wasn’t possible, Malfoy was dead. And even if he wasn’t, what would he be doing in some God forsaken end-of-the-world village in Scotland that seemed to have been forgotten by the whole world?
- It’s about yesterday…
for all he did in his life, was to take three small steps forward and shut the door behind him. Then, it would be all over. But he couldn’t do it – he didn’t know what was keeping him in place, it was like a force from behind him that was relentlessly pulling him back any time he tried to take a step, but he had no idea where the force came from. In fact, he didn’t know where he was or how he got there, he didn’t register anything happening around him at all – there was just impenetrable darkness, deafening silence, and that one, small, barely visible point of light that was calling for him. So he tried, again and again and again, to walk towards it, to vanish into nothingness, but something was stopping him every time.
This rejection proved to him once and for all that there was nobody that would be there for him. The lust wasn’t masking the loneliness anymore, Potter single-handedly managed to make morph them into a tiny little sadistic tandem festering inside Draco’s brain, waiting for a chance to strike again and again and again when he was starting to feel down on himself.
‘Oh, I see…’ Arthur’s expression was unreadable. ‘And have you visited…’ He paused, just like Draco did.
Draco returned to his room and collapsed on the bed. His thoughts were all over the place. He knew he didn’t have much of a choice if he didn’t want to starve to death, but the thought of Draco Malfoy, the heir of what was once one of the most powerful families in the wizarding community, selling himself just to get by, made him nauseous. He laid there, going over his options again and again, until he finally fell asleep. He didn’t even hear Mina shutting the front door behind her.
They all walked through the quiet street while people were turning their heads behind them. Narcissa was slowly regaining her composure, but Draco seemed like he was shaken to his very core. Harry never let go of him, gently pulling him closer for support from time to time. Harry and Draco left Narcissa at Flourish and Blotts to look for some new herbology books and continued on alone.
‘I have nothing. Absolutely nothing.’ Harry sighed, throwing the last piece of parchment onto the pile. ‘I need coffee.’
- No, it’s not like when you’re not feeling well and someone is bringing you cookies and tea, if that’s what you understood. It goes further than that. Some days I just want someone else to take full control of my life and just look out for me while I do what I’m told. Draco says it’s a whole thing and it’s supposedly called “being a submissive”. – His face was red, he could hardly look at his friends in embarrassment.
He sighed and turned onto his back, staring at the ceiling. Why was he suddenly calm and collected? The thought that Yasmine didn’t exist should’ve been enough for him to be throwing up by now – after all, once you accept (or even think) that, the only logical conclusion would be that he, in fact, had sex with Draco Malfoy. And that some part of his masochistic brain registered that as the best sex of his life. But he didn’t
- Are you having second thoughts? – Draco looked worried.
Shacklebolt cleared his throat, breaking the moment. ‘Mr. Weasley, Mr. Longbottom, regardless of what we’ve seen so far, I do feel we need to go back and investigate Mr. Malfoy’s history further. I’m sorry to say, but however eye-opening what we’ve witnessed so far has been, it doesn’t aid our case – I hope you don’t take this against you, Mr. Malfoy…’ he addressed Draco hesitantly.
, an owl flew through the window while they were having breakfast, holding a thick, very official-looking envelope. Draco opened it with shaky hands and read out loud.
