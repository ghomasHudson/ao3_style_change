“He’s been getting death threats for months, then he was sent a parcel with a cursed object in.” Sirius jabbed his wand a little harder into the man’s chest, “Was it you? Your friends?”
It was another six days before the message came,
It was a low blow but it worked and Sirius found himself feeling guilty for being so hard on his godson, “We just worry about you.”
Thank you so much to everyone who has bookmarked, commented and left kudos on this.
“Are you still practicing dark magic?”
-*-*-
“Well I learnt from the best teacher.” Neville grinned once Tom had left and Harry smiled, knowing how close he was to Professor Sprout, then Neville added; “All those months in the DA…” and Harry blinked at him.
Sirius shook his head, wrinkling his nose, trying to push away the waves of self loathing, forcing himself to open up, "No. Never could, kid. It's just… you two are so close, when I see you joking together I always end up thinking that… that you'll run off together I suppose." He tried to sound as though he was joking but he knew he failed.
Draco smiled at that, his mind automatically going to all the different ways that could happen,
The man looked up then and Sirius noticed just how broken he looked, “I uh… I flooed in and he was just on the floor screaming.” Malfoy said, his voice low, “I tried to get it off him but it was stuck, so I flooed the hospital.” His hand twitched towards Harry, and Sirius saw thin dressings on all his fingers.
“We don’t doubt that.” Remus said quietly, placing a bowl of apple crumble in front of the man; Draco glanced up at him before turning back to Sirius, clearly waiting for his response.
Draco nodded knowingly, stroking his hand over Harry’s own before pulling back and rummaging in the pocket of his robes, taking something out and tapping his wand against it until it enlarged enough for Harry to see that it was a cardboard box decorated with stars and moons. “Here.” Draco said, placing it in Harry’s lap.
Hermione nodded, smiling guiltily, “Just don’t tell Ron how much I bought!” She said and Harry laughed, looping his arm through hers and nodding down the street towards Gringotts.
Harry sighed loudly, pouring out the boiling water into the two mugs and handing one to Sirius before adding milk to his own, “It’s been about a month.” He said quietly and Sirius felt something tighten in his chest that his godson had kept it quiet for so long, “I was going to tell you but with Moony being sick and you guys going away… and I knew you’d be like this.” Harry added, a hint of anger creeping through.
Draco laughed breathily at that, dropping to his knees and sucking another mark into Potter's stomach, letting the man deal with his trousers and pants himself. He kissed a trail down from the man's stomach to his pubic hair before dipping and sucking at his, now freed, dick, "Fuck!"
The healer gave a small shrug, “Each patient is different but from the amount of sedation we gave I’d say we should start seeing signs of him being more awake within the next hour but it could be much longer than that before he actually wakes up and speaks to you.”
“But you have to tell Remus.” Sirius added and Harry nodded with no concern, “Including where you met up.”
Sirius felt a lump rise in his throat at that and he rose from his chair, moving around the table to give the boy a hug, "Harry there is nothing you can do that would make me hate you. This love is utterly unconditional." He said, "Sometimes your actions or choices might surprise me, and we might disagree on things but I will always have so much love for you."
Harry, however, was sat at the kitchen table when Sirius walked in, watching as Remus pottered about tidying up dishes from the night before. "Morning." Sirius said and they both looked over to him, Remus smiling his own greeting, Harry ducking his head back down.
He felt Remus shift behind him as Tonks left and a few moments later the man moved and followed her; Sirius swallowed back his irritation, focusing instead on Harry, and on Draco whose eyes were filled with tears he was furiously blinking back. “He’ll be alright. He’s tough.”
Thanks so much for all your comments, kudos and bookmarks. It means a lot!
“Shame about that with me teaching.” Neville said, lightening the air a little and they all laughed, Dennis and his friend reassuring Neville that they were looking forward to his classes. “Right, we should get the the bank.” Neville added, his eyes never leaving Harry who nodded, forcing himself to focus.
“I’m just tired.” Harry said, which wasn’t exactly a lie and also saved him from having to talk about anything else as Sirius leapt up and fussed about sorting out his pillows and dimming the lights, reassuring Harry that the healers and Tonks could wait until he felt more awake.
“Crime thriller, He read a review in the prophet and it’s supposed to be good. Said it was more my kind of thing than his though. Some kid gets abducted in scotland and the aurors have like ten hours to get him back before he dies or something,”
Remus gave a low groan at that, leaning against the corridor wall, “He was upset on tuesday, really upset. I thought it was just because of our argument but…” He trailed off, his hand coming up ro run through his hair.
“So?” Hermione said, “Did everything go okay last night.”
"Me too." Draco agreed, also sitting up and picking Potter's trousers up from the floor and handing them to him.
“I’m gonna take Draco to the pub as planned. Let you guys talk.” He told Harry, his eyes only briefly flickering towards Sirius. “Otherwise Zabini’ll come looking for us.”
Hermione smiled tightly, “That’s good.” She said, though she didn’t sound convinced and Harry resisted rolling his eyes. Hermione had responded pretty much exactly as he had expected; a quiet acceptance of his relationship with Draco alongside an unspoken uneasiness that Harry was sure was going to bubble to the surface eventually.
Sirius frowned, wondering if Draco had told him about their conversation, speaking of Draco…
Maybe they had, on occasion, taken it a little far but… Well Snape had definitely deserved it; whereas Harry hadn’t deserved anything Malfoy had done. His chest hurt suddenly and he let out a grunt in response to his godson’s words; ignoring the look that passed between Harry and Remus.
Harry looked between them for a moment before shrugging his shoulders and smiling uncomfortably “Got any biscuits? I’m starved.”
Sirius swallowed; he wanted to ask what had happened, when and why and whether Harry knew but he knew it wasn’t his place, wasn’t his business, so instead he nodded, “If they let him out tomorrow then I want Harry to come and stay at ours for a bit. You’re more than welcome to come over.”
“Will you come over?”
“No! I… You don’t have to apologise.” Remus said quickly and when Harry looked back up at him the man was watching him with concern. Harry tried to smile again but it didn’t seem to help and Remus moved towards him placing a hand on his shoulder and pushing him into a chair at the table, “Harry.” His voice was soft, “It’s okay.”
“No! Merlin, no.” Draco gave a vehement shake of his head, turning to press a quick, apologetic kiss to Harry’s lips, “I’m not.”
"He said he was going to hex you first?" Sirius asked.
Sirius turned from the fireplace to find Remus watching him, a fond smile on the man’s face, “I love you.”
He watched as Tonks pursed her lips for a second before replying, “We have extra people on the case and we’re doing everything we can.” She looked at Harry as she spoke and he gave a small nod even as Sirius scoffed, Tonks ignored the man. “You need to tell us about any other letters you get though, we’re making progress in tracing them and we have a psychologist looking at them to see of there are any clues. They’re our best lead so far.”
“I’m fine!” Remus said, “Stop staring at me!” He added, cuffing Harry’s shoulder and making him laugh. “Cup of tea?” He offered and Harry nodded, sliding into one of the seats at the table. “I hope you didn’t have plans today? I told Sirius not to pester you…”
“Hello Mr Black.” Draco said quietly, looking surprisingly timid; then again the last time they had met Sirius had been holding a wand to his chest so he couldn't really blame him.
He wondered what else to say but Potter had messaged before he could add to his own.
“I’m only upset because you are.” Remus said softly and Harry felt something untwist in his gut, “I know I haven’t been a very good guardian to you, or even a friend to be honest. But it was never about defeating Voldemort over keeping you safe. Never.” He continued when Harry tried to interrupt, to say that Remus had been great. “I don’t know what I did to make you think -”
“No, he came home with me… we were really drunk, we said it would be a one time thing.” Harry admitted, grimacing as he spoke and Sirius rolled his eyes, out of everyone Harry could have taken home for a one night stand…“We talked the next day and then just carried on from there.”
Sirius felt the familiar tightening in his chest, the way it always did when he thought of what had happened, "So why did you?" He asked quietly, wondering even as he spoke why he had never asked before. He had spent so long, too long, thinking about Remus' motivations that he hadn't even cared about his cousin's, just assumed that she hadn't even cared about how Sirius would feel.
When Harry next woke it was to the sound Sirius’ voice and the feeling of a hand in his own, “Did you get any sleep?” Sirius asked and Harry was just about to open his eyes and say that he was trying to thank you very much when he heard Draco reply.
“Only until ward round in the morning I would imagine.” The healer smiled, “Would you like a drink?”
Tonks swiped her hand across her eyes, taking a deep breath and looking out across the garden, "I was drunk." She said simply and Sirius felt his jaw clench, "And lonely and I just wanted to feel something other than fucking terrified. It was selfish and I'm so, so sorry for hurting you." She wiped her eyes again and Sirius hated himself even more.
-*.*.*-
Harry gave a sniffle at that and Sirius pressed a kiss to the man's head, "I'm sorry."
“So?” Harry asked as soon as Draco had flooed away.
Harry gave a small nod, feeling guilty that Draco had to feel that and wanting to fix it, “Tonks gave me this floo code.” He said, not looking at the man, “For people to talk to… Like therapy.”
“Tha - Thanks.” Sirius said, his voice catching, “I… What happened?” He asked as he moved closer to the bed, he went to take Harry’s right hand only to find it bandaged.
“I actually had no idea what to put in a box for adults.” Draco laughed, “Whisky maybe?”
“Can you blame me?” Sirius snapped, “He’s a death eater, he took that mark and -”
Sirius nodded, giving him a small smile in a silent promise to be nice; Harry smiled back, resting his hand on Draco’s on top of the table and squeezing it gently before leaving the room. The kitchen was silent for a moment and Sirius rested back in his chair, listening to Remus moving around behind him, “I… I know you’re not happy about Harry and I.” Draco said suddenly, his eyes fixed on Sirius. “Understandably given my history, but I truly do care for him a lot.”
“Drinks?” Remus asked, turning now to look at Harry, his eyebrows furrowed. “Don’t have too many, you need to keep your wits about you.”
“Last full moon was a lot less taxing.” Sirius nodded, “So we’re hopeful.” He said distractedly, tilting his head towards the door and trying to make out what was being said.
“We will do.” Remus replied and the woman gave a small nod before leaving through the large double doors, letting them swing closed behind her. “Sirius…”
“So what? You still don’t know who it is?” Sirius asked, he sounded irritated and Harry felt his stomach churn, hating himself for putting Sirius through all this.
He hesitated before pressing send, wondering if it was too much but the reply was quick.
“He did what he had to.” Harry shrugged and saw a flash of pain cross Remus’ face.
Harry grinned at his godfather's words, “Thanks Sirius.”
Draco gave a shrug, “The feathers stuck but they came off in my hand.” He muttered, not sounding concerned, “I don’t understand how… Harry checks all his mail.”
He was deflecting and Harry could hear the tension in his voice but he let it go, laughing instead and making a mental note to thank Hermione. “I can squeeze up?”
“It’s not a big deal.”
Sirius hummed, not sure how to put what he was feeling into words, “I just wish James were here.” He said finally, his voice catching in his throat and making him cough.
“Uh no… she uh.” Harry paused, scratching his head in that way James always used to when backed into a corner, “She walked in on us… in the dining room.” He admitted, scowling when Sirius failed to hold back his laughter. “I was going to tell you Sirius, but it was really new when you guys left and I didn't know how to word it over the floo…”
They’d not discussed this before, not properly anyway - it was rare that Draco spoke about his self-harm in anything more than guarded language and self-deprecating humour and this was new, slightly terrifying territory. “I’m not -”
The man swallowed, “Harry’s right.” He said quietly, his voice hard, “James did change.”
“Just with Ron, Blaise and… and Draco.” Harry continued and Remus’ expression switched from one of parental disapproval to one of surprise. “We umm… We’re kind of seeing each other, Draco and I.” Hardy added quietly, turning his gaze back to the table and playing with the small pepper pot. “I really like him.” He added, feeling childish as he said the words.
Sirius opened his mouth to reply but Malfoy got there first, “Why the hell did you not tell me about the threats?” He asked, his voice low and tense, his eyes firmly on Harry now, ignoring the fact that Sirius was still stood in front of him.
Draco turned his phone, taking a picture of his crotch, his dick half hard and bulging against his pyjama bottoms.
“You’re going to be an amazing teacher.” Hermione told him.
Remus smiled at them as they passed him in the kitchen, offering out a packet of biscuits which Harry declined but Tonks took the entirety of, ducking out of the door before he could tell her off.
“I think I’m probably going to Sirius’ when I get discharged. You can come over after work, if you want?” He said knowing that there was no way Sirius would let him go back to his own flat, not that he was sure he wanted to anyway.
“My father has never hurt me!” Draco insisted, a flush covering his chest now, “I swear!” He sounded so certain that Sirius felt himself pause, realising the man was telling the truth. “Sorry you thought… Sorry you…” Draco trailed off, his arms folding across his chest awkwardly, “You thought we were the same.” He finished finally, ducking his head and it took Sirius a second to realise that he was apologising for Sirius opening up to him.
.-*-*-*-.
Draco opened his eyes slowly, the expression on his face one of pure distress. “I… I was going to go earlier but I… I didn’t know if I should because we’ve seen each other every day this week and I thought he might want space. I… This is my fault, I should have got there sooner!”
“We’ll be there.” Sirius promised, pulling Harry into a hug before he could escape through the floo. “I’m glad you’re happy.” He murmured as they parted and Harry smiled softly before saying his goodbyes and flooing away.
“That’s what the Auror’s will figure out.” Remus said softly and Draco scoffed making Sirius wonder what it was they had been asking him about.
“I’m not overjoyed but the kid’s happy… I said he has to come to dinner, so we can get to know him properly. Make sure he’s changed.” Sirius’ voice was tense but he smiled and Harry felt a warm glow in his chest at the realisation of how much his godfather was trying; he hid a grin as Remus squeezed Sirius’ shoulder and murmured something in his ear making the man roll his eyes.
“I should get off. I’ll be at work if the aurors want me… Though I’d rather wait.” He told Harry who nodded his understanding.
Draco groaned again, throwing himself down on the bed and hiding his face into the pillow. Harry failed to stop his laughter, sitting down beside the man and stroking his hand up his back, “Do you want me to redecorate?”
-*.*.*.-
“He said he was getting lunch in Diagon Alley with Hermione and Neville.” Remus said quietly.
"Thanks but…" he gave a shrug, sitting up and looking around at the discarded clothes, "Busy day tomorrow."
Draco gave his own grin as he pulled off, shifting himself on the floor and pulling at Potter until he rolled over, spreading his legs to give Draco more space between them. Draco groaned at the sight "Spread it for me baby, let me see that hole." Potter whimpered, reaching back to pull his cheeks apart further and giving Draco the most perfect view of his hole.
Harry rolled his eyes, feeling a wave of calm wash over him as Remus grinned back, “We were hardly in the throes of passion! Draco answered the door.” He told the man.
“Wonderful.” Hermione said, her lip curling and Harry laughed. He had always loved crime books, both muggle and wizarding, which was a bit of a joke really considering how much he disliked the job in real life.
"He's just left." Remus' voice surprised them both and Sirius turned, wondering how long his husband had been stood there, "He said he was late to a meeting and he'd catch you later." Tonks nodded in reply, turning back to the garden and murmuring a few charms until long white streaks came out of her wand and flew down to the wards, sparking off until the house was surrounded in a soft white glow that quickly faded.
“It was Harry wasn't it?” He asked with a sickening realisation as Draco moved to walk past him.
“It’s Tonks, she’s a dreadful influence.” Harry said, lying back with his head on the man’s shoulder.
“What? I -”
“If I’m alive.” Harry muttered and Sirius heard Ron snort in response as he squeezed his friend’s shoulder.
The pain was instant and burning, spreading through his body and causing him to drop to the floor with the intensity of it as he called out, opening his palm automatically to drop whatever it was that had caused it. He barely registered that it hadn't worked, the pain consuming him and stopping any rational thought as he writhed on the floor, his mouth letting out a constant scream.
Draco paused but then Potter was lifting his hips and pushing against him, begging for more in that soft, desperate, tone that went straight to his dick. Draco groaned, squeezed out some more lube and added a third finger, driving them in and out of Potter's arse and panting at the sight of his hole closing around them, "Fucking gorgeous." He said, twisting his fingers inside Potter and making him cry out, "Such a good boy."
Draco didn't seem to notice Harry’s scowl, instead he just raised an eyebrow, his eyes never leaving Harry’s and Harry let out a slow breath, feeling some of the tension leave his body; “Maybe don’t mention that at dinner.” He muttered as he dropped his head onto the table.
Sirius let out a huff, “Stupid kid.” He muttered and Remus laughed.
It took a few minutes a quick google to make sense of that and Draco rolled his eyes as he replied.
“Yes. But as I’m sure you can tell they’re a bit slow.” Tonks gave a small smile which wasn’t returned, “I just want to speak to you both together, when Harry’s a bit better.” Draco continued to frown but Sirius could see where his cousin was coming from. The boy who lived being in a relationship with an ex death eater was significant. “I need to talk to Hermione and Neville, in case they saw anything in Diagon Alley. Let me know when he wakes enough to talk.” Tonks told the healer who nodded, “and I’ll catch up with you guys tomorrow.” She added, nodding to Sirius who attempted a smile.
“Fine, he’s asleep. Think the international flooing was a bit much for him.” Sirius said casually, sitting down at the small dining table, “Harry…”
“You just had lunch!” Remus laughed, glancing over at Sirius again who forced himself to smile.
Draco’s eyes drew together, “You want me to leave?” His voice was cold, angry, like Harry had heard it many times years ago; he was hurt, Harry realised and he felt a pain in his lower chest at the realisation.
"Magic."
"So big." Potter gasped out, pushing back against him. Draco grabbed the lube and squeezed some more out onto his dick as he slid in further, not wanting to hurt the man though Potter didn't seem to mind much as he carried on rocking backwards "Harder daddy please. It feels so good."
Draco scrolls through the list of episodes until he find his favorite,
“Potter,” he said in his most neutral voice. “Just
So, I'm going on a temporary hiatus because I have lots of exams coming up, and I need to study really well :(
“What do you want?” Harry asked, cutting straight to the case. He wasn’t in the mood to talk do anybody at the moment, especially not his meddling brother.
The mention of the beast dampened Draco’s mood a bit. However, he didn’t let it show. He was grateful to Pansy, and he didn’t want her to see him sad.
, Granger. My boyfriend, Blaise Zabini.”
let him have his own session with Potter.
“Busy doing what?” She rose an eyebrow accusingly. Harry scowled.
One fateful day, while the Prince was taking a stroll of the land around his palace, he came upon an old woman dressed in rags sitting on the cobbled streets.
“Hm.” Draco thought for a moment.
I put some asterisks next to some parts that may seem confusing. The explanations are in the notes at the end of this chapter. Also, Kouroi is the male version of Kore, which is Persephone's original name.
‘OMG! Tell me this is
Harry had stared at him for one moment before hastily making his way over to him, knocking over the camera stand as he ran.
Draco wordlessly took them off; he knew that there was no point of fighting Harry.
“And then Potter broke out of his cell one day, and we were all put into lockdown. I was in a room with Draco, and I don’t know how, but
He was
As Terry and Theo led Blaise to the airlock room, Blaise looked at them with a straight face.
. He pushed the tip of his tongue right in the middle, flicking it softly and making Draco thrash and whine.
“You’ve done so well for me, my love.” Harry smiled. Draco trembled.
Harry adjusted himself so he was directly in front of Draco’s pink hole.
“Nice car.” He said in awe. Even though he had a Porsche (his father had refrained from buying him a Lamborghini) it wasn’t nearly as nice as Harry’s car.
Harry nodded. The two of them remained silent, simply enjoying the other’s company.
When Draco woke up, he realized that something was off. For one, he wasn't in the Manor in his mother, but in a strange room that had only a bed, a dresser and a mirror in it. It was large, but sparsely furnished. There were two doors, one of which was open, and Draco could see the toilet and the sink inside it.
Draco sighed. “Cormac.” Harry made a face but didn’t say anything.
“Come on, let’s go do our other tasks.”
Draco nodded, swallowing his drink. “And you’re nineteen?”
Harry laughs nervously and covers up his grin with one hand. “Um, yes?”
” Draco’s voice wasn’t even prideful anymore; he was
"You're not allowed to do that, love." Harry sighed. Draco sniffed.
When Harry Potter barged into his shop again, Draco knew that it had been a bad day again.
He hastily grabbed his cloudberry wreath as the wind spirits helped him put on his sandals and braided his hair into a messy plait that stopped at his waist. When they finished, he bade them farewell as he sped out of the house and towards the tall grass fields and the marble streets that would lead him to the market square.
“Harry!” He turned to see Hermione standing some feet behind him. He was about to make a face when he noticed the incredibly
“Oh, Father.” His voice cracked. He reached into the pack he had brought with him and brought out a small canister of water and some clean bandages.
Harry spent the rest of his afternoon watching his -Draco’s; what a strange name- videos and soon gathered that the blond was rich, snobbish in a funny way and very,
“Destroy me, I know,” Harry smirked. “Follow me. The dining room is this way.”
"Sounds interesting." Draco murmurs, absentmindedly playing with the rope of his bathrobe.
“Hey Draco?” Draco looks up from the bed. Harry is standing at the doorway of his room, the one that leads to the hallway.
Seamus chuckles again. “That’s a good one! So, what’s your answer, Harry?”
Harry used his free hand to stroke Draco’s cock lazily, making Draco arch upwards into the touch.
The apartment itself is pretty. It has two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a kitchen and a nice living room. It is small enough to feel cozy but big enough to be spacious. Plus, it isn't too far from his new college, Hogwarts Institution.
Had she been anybody else (besides Ron, or his annoying siblings) Harry would have smote them where they stood for the sheer nerve of not cowering beneath him, although every once in a while, he would leave them for the lost spirits to haunt their minds and drive them mad. It was always entertaining.
“Really? My parents, huh? Do parents leave their kids for
“Shut up.”
“Harry! Aren’t you going to introduce your roommate to us?” One of the strangers asked. She had short black hair, and she wore a black tube top with black ripped jeans and Doc Martens. She had heavy eyeliner on, and matte black lipstick. All in all, she looked like a very intimidating gothic kind or person.
To be fair, Apollo
“No, just certain things.” The wardrobe -
Once he washed it down with a cup of fresh orange juice, he sighed happily and leaned back into his chair.
The nymphs were wise enough to bow down and stay out of his path. He was sure that they still remembered the time when one of their own, a willow nymph, had dared to stand in his way. She had the
“The beast.”
“Hello Kore,” he nodded, He was about to continue on his way when Kore stepped in front of him, glaring. It was a bit of a shock that the two of them were nose to nose, exactly the same height. Harry has naturally assumed that he would be taller than him, but this new development was the opposite of disconcerting. In fact, it was actually quite…
Draco sneered and used his most convincing tone yet. “And if you ever paid attention to when I was talking, you would have known that I have a
Apparently, the ‘coronavirus’ was more serious than they anticipated. It took less than a year and a half to wipe them out completely.
Cedric waved his hand dismissively. “Don’t worry about him; we’re friends. He’s just like that sometimes.”
Draco moaned and tried to push back, but Harry smacked his arse again.
“You’re

Draco was wearing a skirt. A fucking
Draco hadn’t talked to Blaise in years, but Granger didn’t need to know that.
“Draco.” He smiled. Before he could react, his arms were full of quivering and crying blond.
His brother looked a bit older than when Harry had last seen him, although to be fair, the last time they had met was over a century ago. His salt-and-pepper hair was in a bun at the back of his head, and his beard was as bushy as ever.
“Fine. But don’t bother me all the time.”
“Draco? Is that you?” The man asked, his voice deep and strong.
At that moment, with the beast laughing softly at him and everybody watching on happily, he felt… content.
Zeus’ grin widened. “His mother. I can’t believe you’re so behind, Harry.”
“Dray, I…” He trailed off as he took in what his husband was wearing, his mouth hanging open in shock.
pay you for this.” Harry argued.
He whined and arched his back as Harry pulled it out almost all the way, then slammed back into him, hitting his prostate on the first thrust.
“Harry… so close.” Draco gasped.
Draco pulled out his phone and dialed the number.
“Mother.” He smiled, putting a mask of innocence on his face. If he was going to pretend, he needed to do it well. His mother was scarily good as smelling out lies.
Draco was stunned. This hideous beast was trying to
So he waited.
“Say it back.
“Yes yes yes yes I can,” Draco said, his words garbled.
to find the one that was right for him (that is, if they even existed). All he wanted was someone who would love him for who he was, not because he was just a beautiful virgin. He wanted someone who would actually be
“We’re almost done with the mission. Just a few more weeks and we get to go back to Xenon.”
“It’s alright.” Harry shrugged. “I don’t talk about them much in my videos.”
.” Draco gaped. Even the air was pure, and Draco wondered how he had lived with the stale Earth air for twenty-four years of his life.
They marched and marched until Cedric spotted the castle turrets poking through the tops of the trees.
“When the Prince was 17, his parents were murdered by an assassin sent to kill them from the neighboring kingdom, Slytherin. As young as he was, the Prince set out to kill the King of Slytherin, Tom Riddle, which he did, even at his young age. He spared the people, although, and allowed them to run away to Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff kingdoms.”
The pain was a dull, constant ache as Harry woke and he whined, blinking his eyes open as he heard someone rushing across the room towards him, seeing a young woman in healer’s uniform, “What happened?” Harry asked; he remembered getting home from Hogsmeade and then being in a lot of pain but he couldn’t quite make a connection between the two.
“I’ve missed you too. How are you?” Harry asked, drawing back to look at Remus properly. He looked exhausted but no less than he had done before they had left for the medical trial in Rome, he’d also managed to put on some weight and now just looked underweight rather than malnourished which could only be a good sign.
“It’s stupid really.” Draco muttered as Harry pulled out a book of crossword puzzles, “It’s a poorly box. When I was little my dad used to make them for me so when I was sick and had to stay in bed I had stuff to keep me occupied.” His cheeks coloured as he explained and Harry smiled, imagining a young Draco. That was easy enough but imagining Lucius putting together something like this was harder. “Always had like little toys and books and some snacks, my favourite music and… Well he always made sure it was in a nice box too, then I would use the boxes to store my toys at home.”
And there is was; proof that it hadn't just been a random one off conversation, that Potter wanted this to continue as much as he did.
“Sorry.” Harry swallowed, his eyes still not meeting Sirius’.
His godfather smiled then, “Yeah, yeah come through.” He said quickly, as though worried Harry would change his mind. “He’s making lunch.” He added as Harry stepped into the hallway, closing the door behind himself. Harry turned back to follow his godfather to the kitchen and was surprised to find himself pulled into a tight hug, “I bloody love you kid, don’t ever think otherwise.” Sirius said gruffly into his hair, pulling back and moving down the hallway before Harry could respond. The tightening in his chest worsened as he followed the man to the kitchen, suddenly acutely aware of just how much his words must have hurt not only Remus, the letter from that morning flashed into his mind and he shivered. “Rem, look who’s here.”
Tonks laughed softly, "Family habit I think."
They ate in silence for a while, enjoying the food, before Neville asked after Ron and Hermione launched into a complaint about his auror hours and how she seemed to barely see him now. Harry sighed and reminded her that it was only for another six months and then Ron would have more control over his shifts and be able to work them around Hermione’s law mastery hours. “I know, it’s just frustrating that we’ve got less time together since moving in.” She said.
Harry gave a small nod, “Thanks Ron. I’ll just…” he trailed off, rising from the table and sliding past his friend; Sirius could hear him talking to Draco but he couldn't quite make out the words and he sighed, wondering what the fuck he was meant to do now.
"Dunno why, he hates that job." Sirius muttered and she laughed softly, "Any news?"
“What?” Draco’s eyebrows furrowed together, “It wasn’t my dad.” He said and Sirius sighed.
"Well since you asked so nicely." Draco said, sliding his fingers out of the man and murmuring a protection charm before patting at his arse to get him to pull his knees onto the bed and get on all fours. Potter was whimpering out pleas again as he got into position, trying to push back against Draco's dick as he slid it across the swollen hole. Draco slapped his dick against the man before slowly pushing in, groaning at how tight he still felt.
“How’s it going?” He asked, pushing his plate away.
"Could be worse, could have taken after your auntie Bella." He pointed out making her snort.
Harry’s head ached when he woke the next morning and he cursed Zabini and his stupid whisky. After the muggle pub they had gone back to the man’s flat where they had managed to get through a large bottle of his firewhiskey before he had finally kicked them out at around one in the morning when Harry and Draco got a little too handsy for his liking. Harry pulled himself upwards, finding a hangover potion and a glass of water on his bedside table and he smiled, realising that his boyfriend must have left them there before going to work; god bless Draco Malfoy.
“Sounds like a good idea.” Draco said, his voice soft and Harry looked up at him, seeing only understanding in his face.
"Yes daddy." Draco groaned, feeling sweat trickling down his neck and knowing he wasn't going to last long. He pulled out, patting at Potter's thigh until the man rolled over, drawing his legs up instantly and holding them there with his hands so that Draco could shove back inside him, the new angle making Potter yelp, his dick leaking precum on his stomach.
Tonks pursed her lips for a second before she sighed, “It said ‘you should have died’.” She murmured and Sirius sucked in a sharp breath, turning away and trying to push back the wave of nausea. “We will catch whoever’s doing this.” Tonks said quietly, her hand coming to rest on Sirius’ forearm.
.-*-*-*-.
“Fuck off.” She said indignantly, making him laugh, “When you back at work?” Tonks asked, watching as Harry tried, and failed, to make a smoke ring.
Harry lay in the hospital bed, his eyes closed and it took a heart stopping second for Sirius to register that the man’s chest was moving. “Oh thank god.” He hadn’t even realised he had spoken until a healer appeared at his side.
Harry sat next to him on the bed, wrapping a comforting arm around his shoulders.
"Well, you
“Hello.” Draco smiled as he sat down next to him on the booth in the middle. Harry sat next to him on his right side, opposite Hermione.
“Harry. Let’s practice our breathing exercises, alright? Let’s inhale on 3 and exhale on 8, hm?”
He looked at his smartwatch (despite how old it was, Draco still loved it; it was the only remnant of his childhood left) and checked the coordinates for the meet up.
was the one who got us into this in the first place, and now-” Harry’s voice cut off as a choked sob wracked through his body. He put his head in his hands, trying to fight back the tears.
Harry tsked and continued to apply the base coat.
He must have taken too long to respond, because Harry flushes and says “It’s okay if you don’t want to. I mean, we’ve only just met…”
look nice. He was wearing a short yellow-orange chiton that glowed softly, which made Draco guess that it was sewn from sunrise beams. His brown leather sandals ran up to his knees, and there was a bit of yellow glitter on his face. It was a simple outfit, but a very good looking one. Not that Draco would ever admit that, Apollo’s ego was already big enough, as it was.
An hour later, he was no closer to finding his way than he was before. As he was about to turn away, he spotted something in the corner of his eye. When he turned to look at it properly, he gasped. It was a palace. And if he was not mistaken about the look, this was the former home of the Crown Prince himself.
Thankfully, the gold-paved streets were mostly empty since it was still quite early. There were some stragglers, most likely a few minor deities trying to get to marketplace early enough.
“Good morning Kouroi! What would you like today?” Phillina, one of Draco’s few nymph friends, was behind the stand. Draco smiled and walked up to her.
Soon, the shouts of the city police force filled the air, and Rufus sighed in temporary relief. Temporary, however, because Potter was loading his revolver and pointing it carelessly at Rufus’ head. His gloved finger rested loosely on the trigger.
He glanced over at his cousin, giving a small smile at the new lilac hairstyle before realising just how exhausted she seemed; her complexion was, as always, perfect and there was no trace of bags under her eyes yet her shoulders were slumped and she had a pained look on her face. “Is it bad for you? Someone else looking at the case.” He asked, wondering if that was what was bothering her.
Tonks gave a little nod, “He flooed in from the Leaky Cauldron about fifteen minutes before you flooed in.” She told Draco who gave a little whine and closed his eyes.
For a moment Sirius contemplated waking him properly, telling him about his conversation with Draco and trying to untangle the mess of emotions in his head; but then Remus’ head dropped against him, his breathing evening out with soft snores and he looked so peaceful that Sirius’ couldn’t bear the thought of disturbing him.
They lay on the bed for a long time afterwards, still naked, Potter's head resting on Draco's stomach and Draco found himself running his fingers through the man's hair with a surprising tenderness. He felt almost bereft when Potter finally shifted and sat up, "I should get home."
“Remus is concerned that Harry’s not safe here.” Tonks said quietly, “I’m happy to leave one of the newbies here overnight if you’d like, but I’m not convinced there’s a risk.”
“I trust him.” Draco murmured, “I… He means a lot to me.” The flush across his cheeks was back now and he was looking ahead, past Sirius, refusing to meet his eyes.
.-*-*-*-.
The bathroom door was open as Sirius walked past and he stopped short on seeing Draco stood in front of the sink, washing his face. The man was dressed in a pair of Harry’s, too short, pyjama bottoms but what had caught Sirius’ attention was his bare back, or more specifically the several thin scars that criss crossed it. He felt a wave of nausea at the realisation of what spell must have caused them and that they, unlike the ones on Draco’s arms, were unlikely to be self inflicted. “Did he do that?” Draco spun around to look at Sirius, his face paling and his lips drooping down as he stared at the man who suddenly felt as though he had overstepped the mark, “Sorry I -”
Sirius grunted in reply, “You’re telling me.”
As if on cue three little dots appeared at the bottom of his screen indicating that Potter was typing and Draco held his breath but then just as quickly they were gone and he exhaled, frowning again. This happened several times over the next minute and Draco huffed out a breath, wondering what it was Potter was trying to say; he decided he couldn't be bothered waiting and so wrote his own message.
“So should you.” Remus countered; Sirius chose to ignore that and instead walked back into Harry’s room.
“Sorry, no I… I didn’t mean… I’m probably just projecting.” Draco said hurriedly, assuming the end of Harry’s sentence had been a denial rather than the statement that therapy wasn’t for him that it had been.
“Said I would.” Draco said, leaning to give Harry a quick kiss, “I finish about five. Please try and avoid any dramatics until then.” He teased and Harry gave an exaggerated huff of irritation as Sirius chuckled.
Draco shook his head quickly, “No sir.” He said.
There was a silence for a moment and then a soft, “Oh.” Harry couldn’t bring himself to look up but then he heard a soft laugh, “Well that’s… nice. That’s good.” Remus said and when Harry did finally look at him the man was smiling and turning to Sirius, “Why are you not yelling? Did you already - Oh dear did you walk in on them?!”
“Mr Black? Harry is going to be fine, we sedated him because of the amount of pain he was experiencing.” The man said and Sirius turned to him; merlin he didn't look much older than Harry was, “But we have the pain under control now, and he should start to wake soon.”
“Barely.” He lied and Remus turned finally to look at him, raising an eyebrow but not speaking which, to be honest, felt worse than if he was yelling. “Okay maybe a bit but I was fine! There were loads of people around!” Even as he spoke he knew that his words were wrong.
“You love a rebel.” He retorted, laughing as Draco reached into the pocket of his robes and pulled out a tube of mints.
“He is! Well sometimes he can be a bit of a stuck up dick, but mostly he’s nice.” Harry said, frowning at Sirius. “But you like him right? I mean you’re not still mad about us being together?”
“What’s the deal with her and Black? Why all the anger?” Draco asked and Harry pulled a face.
Sirius laughed at that, having been victim to Harry’s ability to use people as pillows many times, “I was still awake.” He reassured the man, “Caught up in a book.” Sirius turned to leave but then found himself pausing a few steps down the hallway. “I know we didn’t get off to the best start Draco, but I am glad he has you.” He said quietly, feeling a surprising softness at the smile that crossed the young man’s face at his words, “Goodnight.”
"I wanted to hurt him though." Harry cut across.
“I didn’t… I didn’t know what it did I swear!” Harry burst out, finally looking up, his eyes wide as he pleaded with Sirius, “I didn’t know it would…”
“Who else knows?” He asked, wondering if he sounded as tired as he felt.
“Liar.” Harry muttered, squeezing Draco’s hand as Draco looked at him in surprise.
“And?” Sirius asked from the doorway, having heard the fire start up.
“I know.” Sirius said, reaching across the table and lightly touching Harry’s arm, “I know you and I know you would never have -”
I’m having to edit on my phone so please let me know if there’s any major issues.
“I love you too Moony. Forever and always.” Sirius whispered.
“What does Draco do?” Remus asked, managing to sound genuinely curious rather than accusatory like Sirius knew he would have done.
There was no way Draco could resist a request like that and he snapped his hips forwards, grabbing at Potter's hips and fucking into him hard and fast until the man was keening and moaning underneath him, his hands clasped in the bedsheets, "Fuck baby you take it so good." Draco groaned, the sight of Potter on his hands and knees, arse in the air taking everything Draco gave him was almost too much and Draco found himself wondering why the fuck they had never done this before. His thighs were starting to ache and Potter's keens of pleasure were starting to get tinged with whimpers so Draco pulled out slowly, ignoring the man's whine in favour of slapping his dick across his, now gaping, hole. "So fucking hot." Draco said, pushing just his head back in and holding Potter in place as the man desperately tried to push back against him, "Patience baby."
“Thanks.” He muttered, shoving it in his pocket and away from Remus’ curious gaze.
Draco gave a soft groan, leaning forward and kissing the man, he tasted like vodka and muggle cigarettes and it would have usually made Draco recoil and offer a mint but somehow it suited Potter, fitted the idea Draco had of him needing to be put in his place, be taken care of.  Potter kissed almost desperately, his tongue fighting for a dominance he was never going to get, and Draco moved his hands to clutch at the man's hips, steadying him. Potter's own hands slid down into Draco's loose bottoms, resting against his arse before squeezing gently, almost asking for permission and Draco rolled his hips against him, drawing back from the kiss to nip at his lower lip; he felt the shaky intake if breath that caused and smiled to himself, doing it again as Potter continued to grope his arse.
“There’s no reason to think so.” The woman said quietly, “He was semi lucid when he came in; managing to speak through the pain.”
“Malfoy’s not so bad really.” Ron said, swigging the last of his water. “And he’s been good for Harry whilst you guys were gone.” He added.
"Hi." Potter murmured, he looked unsure of himself, his eyes flickering over Draco's bare chest and a small flush reaching his cheeks.
“Maybe he has a point.” Draco muttered, holding his hands up in mock surrender as Harry scowled at him, “If someone’s threatening you…”
“I love it.” Harry told him quietly, “Thank you.” Draco’s cheeks flushed and he busied himself with opening the chocolate as Harry pulled out a pack of beautifully illustrated playing cards.
-.*.*.-
A quick cleanliness charm and a fresh pair of boxers later and Harry was quickly coming to the conclusion that he really needed to do some laundry; the pile of clothes in the corner of the room needing a good wash was far outweighing the limited amount left in his drawers. Knowing he was out of time he dragged on a pair of jeans from the bedroom floor, casting a quick freshening charm on them first, lest Hermione complain, and pulled on the new tee-shirt Remus had bought him from Rome. It would have to do he decided, looking in the mirror and flattening his hair down as best he could.
“No! No I… I just thought you might not want to stay… I… I want you here. With me.” Harry said, feeling his cheeks redden slightly at the admission.
-*.*.*.-
“Draco?” Remus asked, his voice soft and his eyes full of concern as he looked at the boy.
"Fuck you're gorgeous." Draco said, taking in the smooth caramel skin and the smattering of dark hairs, he had known that Potter's abs in the pictures must have been tensed in some way but actually looking at them now they hadn't been far off. The man clearly spent a decent amount of time working out and Draco's dick twitched again as he imagined how hot and sweaty that must make him.
“Why would you?” Draco asked, leaning over to pull a bar of chocolate out of the box, “Want some? Lupin’s making tea.”
“Umm yes, it was rather.” Draco said, accepting the plate of chicken Remus put before him with a murmured thanks and nodding when the man told him to help himself to the vegetables on the table.
“That is so unhygienic.” Zabini said as Ron grumbled something about too much information.
“Why isn’t he awake? He was awake when we got here!” Draco said loudly as soon as he walked in, looking around for the healers, the youngest of whom walked over and explained about the sedation. Draco nodded silently in response, his eyes focused on Harry as he moved closer to the bed.
Draco moved his own hands, pulling on Potter's hair to tug him forward, fucking into the man's mouth desperately, loving how sloppy it was and how easily Potter submitted to him. Draco pushed forward, making the man take as much into his mouth as he could and revelling in the choking noise he made as it hit the back of his throat again. "So fucking beautiful." Draco told him, pulling out and laughing as Potter's mouth automatically chased his dick, "You love this don't you baby? Love choking on my dick."
Sirius wrinkled his nose in response, "Harry didn't say, just that he had an appointment."
Tonks shook her head, pulling a face, "Sorry." She said, "We are trying; we've traced the owl that sent the last letter, it's postal but we're getting there with new information. And we're getting Tom Pilson to look at the case as well; see if he can find a new angle." Sirius nodded, not sure what else they could be doing but still feeling angry that they hadn't caught the bastard doing this to Harry, he pushed away the urge to yell about it, knowing it wouldn't make a difference anyway.
“I thought we’d agreed you weren’t going to go out drinking until we’d figured out who was threatening you.” Sirius said quietly, his irritation returning as Harry rolled his eyes, “Harry someone wants you dead!”
She was already raising an eyebrow at him as he stepped out of the floo in the leaky cauldron and walked towards the small table they were sat at, trying to look apologetic as he did so. “You’re late.” She said.
“What did the note say?” Sirius asked, not sure he wanted to know.
“Well yes, rather surprised you don’t to be honest.” Draco said with a casual shrug and Harry wrinkled his nose; of course therapy had been offered to him after the war but he hadn’t wanted to talk to anyone about it, hadn’t seen the point, he’d just got on with it. “Then again I didn’t go willingly.” Draco admitted quietly and Harry frowned but the man just shrugged again, scratching at the bottom of his arm under his robes and Harry felt a shot of guilt.
Tonks watched them until they were up the corridor before turning back to Sirius, “A while after the first attack then.” She said, talking more to herself, “I’m not sure it’s related at all, but obviously we’ll double check. In case them being together has upset anyone.”
“To be fair you’d only argue if you were together all the time.” Neville pointed out with a wicked grin and Harry laughed loudly as Hermione gave him a filthy look, “So what’s the plan this afternoon?” Neville asked quickly, clearly looking to change the subject.
Remus barked out a laugh at that, putting more bowls down on the table, “You know I taught this boy for ten months and I don’t think I ever heard him call me sir.” He said, his voice teasing, “Mind you respecting teachers wasn’t something we were exceptional at either.” He added as Draco flushed a deep red and mumbled an apology.
Harry gave a half shrug, draining the last of his coffee. “‘Mione, Pansy and Blaise.” He said before a flush crept up his cheeks, “And Narcissa.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“He’d be right up there with you in the overprotective parenting.” Remus joked, “But he’d be so proud… Of you both.” Sirius put the last mug into the draining rack; he wondered if Remus’ words were true before deciding he didn’t want to question them, he just wanted to believe them and he gave a weak smile, moving to hug his husband and smiling as he felt the man’s lips against his head.  “Love you so much.”
.-***-.
They were quiet for a while, watching Harry as he slept; Sirius focused on the rise and fall of his godson’s chest, looking expectantly at the healer as he came to the foot of the bed and cast a few charms, causing numbers to hover in the air above the man. “All okay.” The healer soothed, “he’s doing really well.”
“Harry dragged us to a match when we were in Rome.” Remus was telling Draco, “For his birthday present, it was surprisingly good actually. And I’ve never been a big fan.” Sirius smiled at the memory, the one time Harry had been able to come out and visit them during the potions trial had, thankfully, coincided with the few days when Remus had felt his best and been able to go out and do things.
Harry caught his eye as Remus rose and began to clear up the plates and get dessert ready, waving off Draco’s offer of help, “I’m just going to the loo.” Harry said quietly, raising an eyebrow at his godfather that was clearly telling him to behave.
“Ooh who bought chocolate?” He asked, placing the mugs down on coasters in front of them.
The small nod of her head said it all, “The cursed quill was also charmed to stick to Harry’s hand. It’s burnt the flesh where we had to remove it but that should be healed within the next hour.”
**The Horae are the guards to the gates of Olympus and the goddesses of the seasons: Autumn (Carpo), Spring (Thallo) and Summer (Auxo). I tried to incorporate their seasons into their outfits and personalities.
Posting the second chapter now!
He frowned and picked it up. Was this some sort of gift? Maybe Hermione had gotten one for him. He made a mental note to thank her the next day. Perhaps she wasn’t so bad after all.
“Oh, yes he is.” Harry’s father growled. “How long have you been sleeping with that
They all stared in horror at each other for a second, before Harry quickly pulled out of Draco and wrapped him up with the blanket they had put on the cold sofa.
Harry is totally fucked.
The villagers yelled in agreement, and the ones on horses galloped faster to the palace.
Before he could move, Harry pinned him down to the bed.
“You’re very detached.”
“Gods, Harry, I love you too.” Draco sobbed, clutching Harry’s hand tighter. Harry smiled softly, and his eyes started to close.
Draco was mad. No, he was furious, fuming,
“Draco,” she whispered in horror. Draco turned around and gasped.
“So? What about it?”
“Come on, hurry up and fuck me. I know you want to,” Draco said lowly. He gyrated his hips, snapping Harry’s attention to his bulging erection that lifted the thin material of the skirt.
Draco shot up from his seat and helped her block the door entrance, all the while wondering what was going to happen to Harry. Harry had talked vaguely about breaking out of the asylum (although Draco recalled little from their sessions anymore; they mainly spent it having sex now) but Draco didn’t think that he would actually
Draco nodded, and tentatively tried a sip. He gasped. It tasted like soda flavored with butterscotch and whipped cream, only stronger.
When the smoke finally cleared up, the two of them were nowhere to be seen.
“Lie down.” He said quietly. Draco let out a breath and lay down on the bed, his head falling softly into the pillows.
“What’s it like there?”
Greyback groaned. However, when the beast brought out something from its pockets, Greyback shrieked. It looked like a few leaves tied around a silver rod.
Draco sighed as Harry moved his mouth lower to nip softly at his neck.
As Blaise was ejected, Harry kissed Draco’s temple.
“Greyback’s a werewolf.” It had said. “It was just a sprig of wolfsbane tied to a silver rod. Nothing better than that to repel werewolves.”
“Hush, okay? I want to do it.” Harry started gently rubbing the cream onto his hole, patting it with the soft cloth. When he pushed his finger inside, Draco clenched his teeth. He slowly twisted it around, making sure that the cream touched all the tears.
“Don’t peek.” He warned the commenters, turning the phone face-down as he changed.
Harry was going to need to think
“I’ll go change in the bathroom. You can change here, alright?” Harry whispered into his ear. Draco blushed and nodded. As the bathroom door clicked shut, he walked up to the bed and sat on it, admiring the soft satin sheets.
,” he growled. “But if you don’t, I’ll- “
He brushed off his lab coat and walked out of the room in a fake rage, making sure to slam the door behind him.
“Father!” He screamed, urging the voice to where the voice had come from. Soon, he got to a clearing and gasped.
“Here you go, and make sure you get back before your mother finds you. You spend an awful amount of time down there.”
“Thank you.” Draco whispered. The air between them had changed; there was a new tension in the air.
She narrowed her eyes but conceded, inclining her head slightly. “Yes, my Lord.”
“Wait! I- I’ll do it.”
He almost missed the small, folded piece of paper lying on his desk, just a few inches away from the vase, until he brushed up against it as he made to put the flower aside. He unfolded it, not knowing what to expect. Maybe it was a welcome note?
Soon, he arrived at the sweets shop. He walked inside, moaning from relief as the delightfully warm air hit him. He looked around and noticed that the shop was a bit empty, with only a few people present. Cormac wasn’t there. He checked his watch. It was five minutes to eight, so he supposed that he was a bit early.
“He’s pretty interesting. And hot.”
The cobbled streets of Hogsmeade were empty, making him shiver involuntarily.
The cronies began to drag Draco away, ignoring his screaming and kicking. The townspeople gasped and whispered behind their hands but didn’t even bother to help him out.
Draco shrugged. “Do you have a guest room or something? Because I’m not expected until tomorrow.”
Draco sneered at him. “Hurry up and leave, Potter! It’s closing time!”
“He’s the suit of armor.”
He stood up and stretched his arms out. If he was attending any party, then he had to find something presentable to wear. It wasn’t every day the Lord of the Underworld came out of his realm, and if he absolutely

A loud sigh cut through Malfoy’s rant, which made Malfoy instantly perk up, but Rufus immediately braced himself for the worst.

Harry started thrusting into Draco slowly but deeply, making Draco writhe and moan.
This is the absolutely lovely fanart that Fae made for this fic!!! I hope you guys love it as much as I do!
He sat down in front of Mr. Dumbledore’s desk.
Draco knew that things were not perfect. The world could end anytime from then. There could be a giant war that wiped out the human race. Harry’s parents were still wary of them. He would never see his parents again. Robots could take over the world. Fuck, aliens could come and destroy the planet.
“How’s this?”
As Scrimgeour’s blood (and some of his brains) splattered against the chair, Draco looked back up at Harry.
about it.
They whispered sweet nothings to each other until they fell asleep, with blaring laptop and a toppled over jar of Nutella pouring on their clean bed sheets.
. Draco snorted quietly to himself. As if. It was known everywhere that he was a recluse, and Draco could bet his whole wardrobe that it was just a stupid rumor and nothing more. The day he ever saw the Lord of the Dead was the day that he would eat his own robes.
“I just remembered you’re not from here. We can introduce you to everyone tonight.” He smiled.
Then Potter looked up at him, meeting his gaze head on. All Draco could think of was how his eyes really were the same shade of green of his hair. He had never believed whenever anyone had said so, passing it off as ‘sentimental garbage.’ Turns out he was wrong.
“What do you want?” Draco snarled. He really wasn’t in the mood to chat.
“And come back before curfew!” Carpo called out.
His mother was sitting on the bed, looking a bit healthier than she did when Draco had left her. Mr. Dumbledore was sitting next to her on a chair, talking to her, and feeding her spoonfuls of soup. He could see their lips move, but he could hear no sound.
, and didn’t even seem to care that he was covered in snot, sweat and tears. For some reason, it turned Harry on. He would have felt disgusted with himself, but he had passed that stage long ago.
Then he noticed the gleaming green eyes and the tarnished crown upon its head.
“Your son?” Harry asked, cocking an eyebrow. The only person he had been looking at was-
One of the damned things bit clean through the horse’s front leg, leading it to buck wildly and toss Lucius onto the ground. The wolves abandoned it as it ran away and started to attack Lucius instead.
The guards dragged in a woman who was holding her head high, for some reason. If Harry was in a sour mood, he would have instantly blasted her to the Asphodel Meadows for her insolence. But seeing that he was bored out of his mind, he allowed her to stay. For now.
“But won’t you be cold?”
She smiled and led him through the large hallways at a slow pace, allowing him to look around and gape shamelessly at the prisoners stuck behind their clear, fortified barriers. Some of them ignored the two of them outright, while others pulled faces at them and even muttered angrily about them. It was quite fascinating, and Draco found himself even more interested in his internship than he already was.
Mrs. Weasley proceeded to introduce him to everyone. Ginny was the chipped teacup, Hermione was the feather duster, Ronald was the candelabra, Fred and George were the saucepans, Crookshanks the cat was the throw pillow, Mr. Weasley was the clock, and much more people that Draco tried to remember.

Draco wanders over to the dining table, moaning slightly at the scent of the stew. He ladles a generous amount into his bowl and grabs two slices of the flat bread. He goes to the couch and sits next to Harry, putting his feet up on Harry's legs.
Before he could lose his nerve, Harry DM’ed him.
“A wardrobe, obviously. But if you’re asking for my name, it’s Pansy.” The wardrobe replied disdainfully. Draco wondered how a
“Fuck, Harry.” He groaned. He reached down to stroke his cock and mewled when Harry slapped his hand away.

“Fine then! You won't get any food until you come down!” It bellowed. Draco heard it stomp off angrily.
“I heard that his ickle mummy’s sick. Is it true, little boy?” Thomas taunted.
at a time and got to Harry’s room.
“Excuse me?”
“Does my arse look good?” he asked nervously, turning around. Most of the comments seemed to agree.
“A surprise? Oh, Harry, you know I love surprises! What is it?”
Harry grinned widely at his fiancé, who looked absolutely delectable in his formal robes. “I do.”
“Would you sign it again if you could? Or maybe… other behinds?”
He quickly brushed his platinum hair back and plaited it into a Dutch braid. It was long enough to brush his shoulders now, and his mother had taught him how to braid a few months so he could keep it out of the way.
Draco sprung to his feet and didn’t hesitate to slap the smirk off his face.
“Eh. It’s not really a big deal anymore.” He brought the cup to his lips and took a small sip. It was hot and tasted like chamomile. It was just what he needed.
“Yes,” Draco replied, biting his lower lip nervously. Harry stepped out of the bathroom and Draco barely stifled a gasp. The flimsy cotton was stretched against Harry’s broad chest, and he noticed with red cheeks that there was a tenting in the lower part of it.
“Merlin I hate this.” He muttered, “I just feel so useless!” He moved across the corridor, leaning his head against the wall on front of him and banging it lightly in frustration.
“Fine. Tired.” Draco said shortly and Harry nodded, not wanting to push him, “Besides I should be the one fussing over you.” Draco added, raising an eyebrow as he watched Harry shrug his shoulders.
An older healer, who Sirius recognised from last time they had been in, turned from where she had been scribbling in some notes, “Sirius, hello. The curse was the same as last time but stronger, the aurors seem to think that that’s only due to the object having not been infused with it for as long so less of it had worn off. We’ll be more sure once they’ve run some analysis.”
He pushed open the door to his room, smiling as Draco groaned, “Sirius decorated it.” He explained, the look of distaste on Draco’s face at all the red and gold furnishings making him laugh.
Sirius crept into his own room, shucking his clothes as quietly as possible and sliding in between the bedsheets, curling up against Remus who wrapped an arm around him and pulled him closer. “You ‘kay?” He was barely awake as he spoke but his lips still found Sirius’ shoulder, pressing a soft kiss to the bare skin.
Harry lay in bed for about thirty minutes trying to avoid having to get up before he had the sudden realisation that he had agreed to meet Hermione and Nev in Diagon Alley for lunch and he was running out of time to get ready. He’d flooed back to his at about eight, as Draco got ready for work, all full of intentions to do something productive with his morning, but had ended up crawling back into bed and waking up five hours later, leaving him in the panic he was in now. As he leapt out of bed he stubbed his toe on the bedside table and swore loudly, hopping across the room to his chest of drawers.
“I was born pretty early so my immune system and my lungs were a bit shit as a kid.” Draco shrugged, “My parents… I had two older siblings who didn’t survive to birth so they were overly protective anyway and the slightest hint of a cold had me confined to bed for a week.” He rolled his eyes.
Sirius chipped in to the conversation occasionally but mostly he just watched the two men; the way Harry deliberately brushed their hands together as he reached for his wine glass and the way Draco was leaning ever so slightly to his left and closer to Harry reminded Sirius, once again, of how James and Lily had been together.  They bounced off each other, Sirius thought, gentle teasing thrown in with small smiles and casual glances that seemed to be checking they weren’t going too far; when the topic moved to school quidditch matches Harry steered it back to international sport, a small crease above his eyebrow.
He saw that Potter had read the message almost insantly but ten minutes later there was still no reply and Draco scowled down at the screen, trying to figure out what he had done to upset the man. It took another five minutes for Potter to reply and Draco quickly realised that he wasn't the problem.
Harry scowled but didn’t respond and Remus let out an audible sigh, “Which you and James would have found hilarious when we were in school.” He said quietly and Sirius sucked in a sharp breath because the man was right, and he knew that.
Draco's eyes found Potter's and he felt a warmth in his stomach as the man flushed and ducked his head, he had been so worried that this would be too awkward or too weird but somehow it felt just as right as those messages had, Draco thought, tossing back the last of his whisky and placing his glass down, looking back at Potter and trying not to focus too much on the way his throat moved as he swallowed. Potter drank too quickly, spilling droplets down his chin as he did so, when he put the glass down he went to wipe them away, grinning ruefully, and Draco stepped forward, grabbing his wrist to stop him, raising his own hand to clean the man up; he heard Potter's sharp intake of breath at the touch and realised, a tad belatedly, that this was the first physical contact they had had. Draco slid his thumb up from Potter's chin, across the man's lips and almost closing his eyes in pleasure at the way Potter automatically parted them willingly, his tongue flicking out against Draco's thumb.
He wondered how James would react to Harry dating Malfoy and found a flicker of comfort in the knowledge that he would likely have responded in the same way as Sirius and made absolutely certain that his intentions were good; though knowing James he would have managed to go about it in a much more subtle way and not upset Harry like Sirius had. He felt the usual tug of grief and took a moment to just close his eyes and breathe, he wondered if it was normal for it still to hurt so much, all these years later.
“Someone has wanted me dead since I was born!” Harry snapped, “I can’t keep hiding away being scared Sirius; I can’t live my life like that. I thought you of all people would understand.”
“Or Draco does.” She continued which cut off Harry’s protestations, he hadn’t even considered that, “I have a number you can have.” Tonks started rooting through her pockets, pulling out all sorts of junk as she did so; piling bits of receipts, coins and an almost empty packet of gum on the step beside her.
“And you realised he was a lovely boy now?” Sirius asked sarcastically, hating himself for it as a shadow of hurt crossed his godson’s face.
They wandered down the garden, heading towards the trees and the steps which led down to the beach. The house wards stretched down to the third step which Tonks took advantage of, sitting down on the first and glancing back towards the cottage which was barely visible through the trees; Harry sat down beside her, taking the packet of biscuits she thrust into his hands. “How you really doing ratbag?”
“Since when do you smoke?” Came a voice from behind them and Harry winced at the inevitable lecture that was about to occur; kicking himself for not having heard Remus approaching.
“I’m fine.”
“I’ll uh… let you say goodbye.” Sirius said, moving away and out of the room.
They heard footsteps in the corridor and Draco pulled back regretfully, “I have to go to work soon.” He said quietly as they heard the steps carry on past the room and Harry nodded, turning his head to press his lips to Draco’s palm which was still resting against his cheek.
Remus nodded, “And when can he go home?”
“Draco, I know what it’s like. My father used to curse and hex me all the time when I was -”
Harry and Sirius were always hugging and play fighting but Remus was a lot less tactile and so they didn’t hug often, not like this anyway, yesterday had probably been the first time since Harry was cursed, and it felt nice; like coming home. “I’ll be more careful, I promise.” Harry said quietly, knowing it was what Remus needed to hear.
Harry nodded again, not really wanting to get in to why he hadn’t handed in the letter, he’d already been lectured by both Sirius and Hermione about it today and no doubt Draco would have his own opinion on the matter.  “Want to go for a wander?” Tonks said suddenly, breaking through his thoughts, “Bit of fresh air? We’ll stay within the wards.” She added as Sirius opened his mouth.
Harry choked out a laugh, “They were mine actually.” He admitted and watched with amusement as Sirius’ jaw dropped in horror and Remus burst into laughter.
“I had school.” Dennis said shortly, “My parents need me to do well.” The fact that he was the only child they had left who could was left unsaid and Harry felt a tightening in his chest at the thought, an image of Colin sat in the gryffindor common room revising for his OWL’s flashing through his mind.
"As long as you're happy." Sirius said, finding that he really meant it. He couldn't understand Harry and Draco, couldn't understand how they could put all that history behind them, but he was starting to realise that they were probably the only two who ever would, and maybe that was all that mattered.
“It was an accident!” Draco spluttered, “He didn’t mean to, he just… he didn’t know what spell…”
Remus chuckled, “I did the cooking so I’m pretty sure it’s your turn anyway.” Sirius made a show of pouting but he moved over to the pile of dishes, casting a cleaning charm on each one seperately, knowing that something always got missed if he did them all together.  His mind zoned out on the task, returning to Harry and Draco and how happy Harry seemed with the other boy; the besotted expression on his face a mirror image of his father’s whenever Lily was around.  “You okay?” Remus asked quietly after a moment.
Draco’s shoulders dropped slightly as he gave up his defensive stance, a hint of a smile creeping across his lips, “Good.” He said, “Potter I did not suffer through ridiculous questions from the aurors just to walk out now.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“He had an appointment.” Harry mumbled, not looking up.
“Should get back to Harry.” He said and Remus nodded, pulling himself up from the chair with what looked like considerable difficulty. “And you should get home to rest.”
“It’ll be fine.” Ron said quietly, his eyes meeting Sirius’ for a second before he left; the front door slamming a few seconds later.
“Your safety comes first to Sirius and I… and I know I’m a little over the top sometimes.” Remus said, “I just, I feel like I let you down. Seeing you there in Hagrid's arms…” His voice broke and Harry shivered, “I never want to have to go through that again.” Harry moved off his seat to hug the man, “You and Sirius. You’re all I have.” Remus finished, hugging Harry back tightly.
"You are his world." Tonks murmured, "Sirius he loves you so, so much." Sirius nodded, not knowing what to say to that.
“Look you promised him you’d try yeah?” Remus said quietly and when Sirius looked up the irritation was gone from the man’s face, replaced with only exhaustion and Sirius hated himself for that, Remus deserved better. “Just keep your comments on Malfoy until Harry’s gone home?” The man suggested and Sirius nodded silently as he heard Harry come back down the stairs.
“No-one’s saying you have to hide.” Draco said in response to Harry’s comment, choosing to ignore Zabini’s. “Just be careful, and stay sober enough to protect yourself.” He added, looking for all the world like the self righteous little prince he had been at school.
"No!" Sirius said quickly, "No, you guys are friends and I shouldn't be fucking with that." His cousin didn't look convinced, "It's just hard… He deserves the world." Sirius added.
“You can probably take a bit longer.”
Merlin, his typing really was atrocious, Draco thought, grimacing at his phone as he replied,
Draco drew back from the kiss, panting softly and almost laughing at the way the man's mouth tried to chase his own; he ducked his head and nuzzled into Potter's neck, sucking at the skin there as an apology, making the man moan and buck against him, rubbing their clothed dicks together and sending shots of pleasure through Draco. Potter took a small step back, putting just enough distance between them to let him slide his hand around to the front of Draco's pants and hold his dick. Potter only stroked him a couple of times before he suddenly let go and withdrew his hand making Draco tense, wondering if this was where the man came to his senses and left. But then… but then Potter was dropping to his knees, looking up at Draco through hooded eyes and reaching out a finger to stroke along his dick through the pyjamas, "Can I?" He asked quietly, "Please."
Remus turned from where he had been cutting salad, a brief smile crossing his face as he saw Harry, “Harry!”
“Bye.” Draco left, closing the door quietly behind himself and Harry frowned after him, forcing a smile when Sirius nudged at his arm.
He watched silently as Draco’s fingers stroked across Harry’s arm above the bandage; the man’s sleeve had slid up and Sirius could make out the black ink of the dark mark against his pale skin and felt his breath catch in his throat as he saw the scars that marred him; the largest and thickest ran vertically down his arm and through the mark, ending at Draco’s palm and Sirius felt a sickening realisation that it, along with the thinner horizontal marks, were deliberate. As if noticing his gaze Draco looked up at him before his eyes flickered down to his arm and he pulled it back from Harry’s hand, shrugging his robe sleeve down and closing his eyes briefly before he looked up, his eyes avoiding Sirius’ own, “It’s getting late, I should go.” He said quietly, “I’ll come back in the morning before work.”
“I’m fine.” Draco murmured, giving him a soft smile in response and Harry smiled back, leading him out of the room and up the stairs. The cottage was fairly small, compared to Malfoy Manor or Grimmauld Place at least, but Harry loved it. Sirius and Remus had moved in during his sixth year, after Sirius had woken from his coma, and Harry had only managed to visit a few times before he had gone travelling with Ron and Hermione but after that, after the war, the cottage had become his safe haven for months.
“Don’t know.” He said, “Don’t want to know.” He added as Draco looked at him incredulously; he had some idea of course but, well, he really didn’t want to think about it. He crunched and swallowed the rest of the mint before sitting up and kissing Draco, “Better?”
"Sure, water works." The man replied, giving him a lopsided smile, accepting the glass Draco handed him with a small thanks, raising an eyebrow at Draco's own whisky glass. Draco ignored the eyebrow, instead focusing on the man in front of him, drinking in every detail, he was skinnier than he seemed in the pictures but there was also clear muscle definition under that tight tee shirt he was wearing, and his hair was as much of a disaster it had ever been at school and Draco found himself smiling at that, despite everything somethings clearly never changed.
"Where's Harry?" Sirius asked as his cousin continued her checks.
Very brief mentions of self harm and suicide attempt.
“Yes.” He said, “She’ll be in touch if anything comes up.” Remus sat down on the other two seater, smiling as Sirius entered the room with two more mugs and handed him one, “How are you feeling?” He asked Harry.
He had added a ridiculous image of a sad face and Draco rolled his eyes again.
Harry laughed, “You can call him Sirius.”
“Of course.” Remus promised and Draco gave a small nod of thanks before turning to leave.
“Harry!” Ron called out as he spotted him and Harry gave a weak smile, walking over and sliding into the booth beside Draco. “That bad huh?” Ron asked as Harry stole his glass and drained the last of the beer.
"For what?" Sirius laughed softly, "Sounds like you were in a tough situation and did what most people would have done. Hell I've definitely done worse." He said, thinking of Snape and the willow, of cornering Peter on that street. "I have to ask though… Is that why… Well Draco said you felt worse than he did about it? Is that why you're…?"
“I’m fine.” He said shortly, sounding anything but and the healer frowned at him for a moment before giving a small nod and moving back over to where his superior was scrawling in Harry's notes. Draco’s shoulders slumped, his jaw clenching as he stared down at Harry and Sirius wondered if he should say something, offer some words of support maybe, but before he had the chance the door opened and Tonks stepped inside.
Harry blinked at him for a second, “Uh… Okay, thanks Sirius.”
“I cannot believe you are risking your safety. After everything we have done to keep you alive!” Remus said angrily and Harry felt himself snap; the anger he had bottled up pouring out now.
Harry frowned at that “Were you often sick?” He asked, trying to sound casual as he rummaged around the box.
“See what a sweetheart he is to me.” Tonks said, grinning at Remus as Harry ignored her and bent to pick up the stolen biscuits before he started walking towards the house, “Although I could have done with those coins!” She called after him and he felt himself smile in response as he heard them follow him up the path.
“That’s great!” Harry said, “It’s really… fun. You’ll have to survive a year with Nev first though!” He joked and Dennis laughed. “I’m glad you’re doing well.” Harry added quietly, “I was looking out for you at the memorial -”
He looked up as Ron cleared his throat and the younger man grinned at him, taking a glass from the cupboard and filling it with water. “Alright Sirius? How’s Remus? Harry said the potion trial seemed positive.”
Draco rolled his eyes, “Well Granger flooed Blaise last night so my plan of an early night was scuppered by his arrival with a bottle of whisky.” He said, “So actually I probably feel worse than you, do you think they have a spare bed?”
He looked up, finding Zabini leaning back in his chair regarding him cooly. “About the only decent thing the muggles sell.” He said with a shrug, completely blanking Harry’s filthy look.
The shouts of Aurors started to break through the eerie silence, making Harry grin even wider.
“Put him in the asylum. He’s clearly formed some sort of attachment to it, the poor boy.”
Harry sighed and put down his quill on the desk that was currently littered with paperwork. They were all the documents from his last Auror cases.
. He would go save Draco by himself if nobody else was going to.
“I’ll see you on Thursday, Draco.”
Draco couldn’t see Harry’s expression from how he was positioned, but he wondered how he looked.
you.” Pansy demanded. Once he did, Pansy snatched it back with the knob of the dresser door.
“No! Give it back! Harry didn’t do anything to you!”
Malfoy scowled and slapped the back of his head.
“What?” Draco asked, confused.
“Are you alright, love?” Harry asked, kissing the top of his head.
“Sure. You can take care of the plants if you want. I’m sure Neville can help you out. He loves plants.”
ones who were involved with his kidnapping. The thought of it made him angry again.
Cedric walked up to Draco and tilted his chin up, his grin cruel. His hand slipped into Draco’s pocket and brought out the mirror.
He looked into the mirror, ready to see what it had in store for him. The mist started to swirl, and he braced himself for what he was about to see.
Draco sat down on the fluffy bed, marveling at the downy fabric. Back in the circus, he only had an old model of a technobed, but this one was probably the latest. The temperature and texture of the sheets changed fluidly beneath his fingertips as he stroked them absently.
“Who’s Neville again?” Draco asked sheepishly.
Draco blanched. His mother actually

area, but his name is rather short. It usually takes him a few seconds to write it on a normal day, but as the end of a long minute approaches, Harry knows that he’s dragging it out. Why? Well, he doesn’t know the answer to that.
like to show-off a quite a bit). It was just that… none of them were
“You’re feisty.” It commented with a raised eyebrow. Draco scowled and sat up in his bed, wincing as his middle protested. The beast hissed and got up from its chair to adjust Draco back into a lying position. For once, Draco didn’t talk.
Harry laughed. “You’re a riot, Draco.”
“Well, now that that’s over, may we eat?” The beast said. It sounded vaguely amused.
They talked for over two hours before they realized how late it was. Harry was a genuinely friendly and funny person, and Draco really enjoyed talking to him.
Harry had noticed that Draco looked uncomfortable with the man he was serving, who was trying to hold his waist. Without even thinking, Harry had walked up to them.
As they walk down the stairs to the garage, Draco takes a moment to look at Harry properly. Harry’s hair is like a rat’s nest, but he somehow pulls off the look. He’s only wearing a green sweater with a big ‘H’ on it and jeans with some black Vans. All in all, a rather simple getup, compared to Draco’s outfit.
“Are you sure this isn’t role-play?”
darkness.
The man watched as the butterfly flew into the sky with a peaceful, yet wonderous expression on his face. His hands fell gracefully to his sides, adjusting the flowing white chiton he was wearing. Even more of his satiny skin was revealed, making Harry take a step closer to him..
“The harbor is not far away, and it is just midday. I should be back by nightfall.”
Draco tuned her out as she continued to lecture him, instead looking around at all the people staring at the two of them. They ignored him and the Granger lady, which made him wonder if-
skull), nothing in this room whatsoever reminded him of Olympus, and especially not his mother’s palace.
Draco gaped at it. He was used to eating watery porridge and maybe some leftover fish with fruits for breakfast. Fresh meat was a luxury, and there was enough here to feed his family several times over.
I'm really sorry but I think I'm probably going to drop this story :(
Draco had to admit that it was smarter than he gave credit for.
Draco raised an eyebrow but said nothing and Harry took advantage of his silence to kiss him again, “You taste like an ashtray.” Draco mumbled against his lips and Harry snorted, realising what the raised eyebrow earlier had been about.
Harry held back a laugh at how impatient his friend was and nodded in response to her question, “Yeah, surprisingly okay actually. Everyone behaved.” He said, looking around to make sure that nobody was listening, “I think Sirius might actually be coming around, for real this time.”
Harry shook his head, feeling a wave of exhaustion as he leant back against the pillow, he tried to remember last night but all that came back to him was the pain and Draco’s pleading voice, “Draco! What happened to Draco?” He asked, sitting upright quickly.
“Dennis! How are you? How’s the family?”
Harry took another deep breath, willing himself to stay calm and pushing down the burning anger he could feel creeping up on him, “I was hardly dancing on tables.” He said through gritted teeth, remembering a moment later that that wasn't technically true, “Besides I can’t hide away forever. I just want to have some fun Rem!”
Draco let out a soft moan, palming at himself over his pyjama bottoms, Potter had gained confidence since last time and Draco wondered absently if that was alcohol related, although he had got the feeling that the man was a little out of it then too.
“What happened?”
“He probably didn’t want to worry us. You know how he is - always trying to keep us safe.” Remus murmured, his hand moving in soothing circles on Sirius’ back as the man blew his nose.
“Lupin.” Harry grumbled, “He just went off on one about how I shouldn’t have been out drinking and it wasn’t safe.”
“I need to go to Flourish and Blotts.” Harry said, humouring his friend and getting Hermione’s attention at the name of the book shop, “Remus recommended a couple of books and there’s one I have to get for work.” He pulled a face and Neville frowned slightly.
Remus had been his first, and his only, love in every way, their break up during the first war had broken Sirius and he hadn't even tried to move on. He had cried the first time Remus had kissed him after he had left Azkaban, had spent so many nights dreaming of the moment that he could scarcely believe it was really happening. He knew there'd been others whilst he was in prison, men and women that Remus had probably loved, and he tried not to think about it too much, knew it was more complicated than he made it in his head and yet the idea that he was replaceable was always there, and the man shagging his younger and far less emotionally damaged cousin really hadn't helped with that.
"Please fuck me daddy. Need your dick in me." Potter stuttered and Draco groaned, hearing Potter call him that out loud was something else and as much as he wanted to tease the man further he knew he wouldn't last doing so.
"I should really get back and get on with some work." Tonks said, pulling a face, "I wanted to catch Draco again really, any idea if he's coming back later?"
“I wasn't that drunk!” Harry said automatically, folding his arms across his chest defensively.
“Uch.” Draco flipped, turing to face Harry, “I suppose I’ll survive. Sooner we get back to your flat the better.”
“I’m staying.” Sirius repeated, cutting across his husband and scowling as he and Tonks shared a look. “I won’t leave him here. Why don’t you think it’s a risk?” He asked his cousin.
“Sorry.” Draco said and Sirius frowned, “If I woke you… He fell asleep on my arm, it’s the first chance I’ve had to move.”
“I thought you only smoked when you were incredibly drunk?” Draco asked, leaning back against the pillows.
“Here you are.” He said, handing one to Draco who mumbled a thanks, avoiding looking at the man.
“No thank you.” Draco said, a tension in his voice that made Harry frown.
“Nice of her but I’m seeing my own therapist tomorrow anyway so…” Harry looked up in surprise.
Harry came bounding down the stairs then, taking them two at a time by the sounds of it, and flopped down into his chair, grinning first at Draco and then at the food in front of him. “This smells amazing Moony!”
“You alright kiddo? Sorry, stupid question.”  The man said, pulling a face.
“I do trust you!” Sirius protested, letting out a huff of air as Harry shook his head.
“Much.” Draco grinned as Harry straddled him and kissed him again.
“Didn’t know if you were allowed. Healer’s on her way down though, and Tonks is too.” Sirius replied, dropping back into the chair on the far side of Harry’s bed and watching as Draco stood up.
They were quiet for a moment, listening to the sounds of Malfoy moving around in the bedroom, and Sirius contemplated Harry’s words; his mind returning to Regulus causing the usual guilt to sit heavier on his chest. He swigged from his coffee using the burn on his tongue to distract himself from those thoughts “How did it even start?”
Potter nodded desperately and Draco surged in to kiss him, stepping out of his pyjamas as he pushed Potter backwards, leading him out of the kitchen and up to the bedroom, only stopping the kiss to manoeuvre through doorways and up steps. Draco's hands found Potter's zipper, dragging it down and laughing gently at the sigh of relief, "Bit tight were they?" He teased, tugging on the waistband and pulling them down as Potter toed off his shoes. The jeans were as tight as Draco had expected and he struggled to pull them down to even thigh level and ended up groaning in frustration as he pushed Potter down onto the bed.
“Yeah.” Malfoy breathed after a moment as he moved backwards and Sirius stepped into the flat, listening to the sound of Harry swearing and stumbling around his bedroom, presumably getting dressed. Sirius didn’t have long. He closed the front door and within a split second he had his wand pressed into Malfoy's chest.
“No!” Malfoy choked out, he looked terrified but then a strange look crossed his face, a combination of concern and irritation, “They’re threatening him? He didn’t say…”
“There are Wrackspurts around your head.” The girl called Luna said. Her voice was serene and oddly entrancing.
“Hello, Dr. Granger. Hello
“It’s ok, Harry. It’s not your fault,” Draco said in a soothing tone. He knew it wasn’t Harry’s fault, unlike what everybody said. It

She sighed in exasperation. “Let me go get him before he does anything he’ll regret later on.”
Tbh this is turning out to be more like a collection of inter-related (is that a word?) drabbles than an actual storyline lol
“Nice to meet you too, Harry.” He replies smoothly. Harry adores the way he makes an ordinary name like
!” Harry yelled; he thrust deep into Draco’s arse as he came, shooting his load deep inside of Draco. Draco let out a high pitched scream, but somehow still managed to hold himself together.
, you feel so good around me, love,” he growled, spanking Draco’s pink arse again. Draco keened loudly, and Harry was sure that there were tears in his eyes.
Draco had literally run away from his parents to join a circus when he was sixteen, three years prior to now. Even though he was rich and well off, his parents had more or less forced him to get a job or be kicked out. There was no room for mercy in a cold world. And Malfoys were notoriously ruthless, even to their own kind. The loss of their only son wouldn’t mean much to them; they could always find somebody else to take his place in a heartbeat.
For some reason, this didn’t terrify Draco nearly as much as it should have. He didn’t care much for extinction now; he had the brothel to focus on.
while eating the leftovers of Harry’s abghoost, which Draco was now obsessed with.
He sighed to himself and placed the glass back on the table. He was already getting tired of staying in the spotlight, even though it had barely been a few hours since he arrived.
As he breathed in the chemical air, he sighed. Ever since trees had gone nearly into extinction, people had found other ways of sustaining the atmosphere and climate change. Now, the air everybody breathed was made in labs before being pumped out into the world. The icebergs had been restored, the ozone layer had been fixed and even greenhouse gases had been converted into eco-friendly fuel.
Then, the events of the previous night came rushing down to him.
Harry slung an arm around Draco’s shoulder and led him out of the bookstore.
“You like that, don’t you?” Harry asked mockingly. Draco nodded eagerly. His flushed pink cock was already leaking precum and staining his skirt. Harry bit back a moan at the sight.
“Not this again.” Ron groaned.
Blaise rolled his eyes and said nothing.
Also, just in case you're curious, Persephone did have several suitors, including Ares, Hephaestus, Hermes, Apollo and even Zeus himself. However, I removed Zeus because that would make the story even weirder than it already is :p
Harry led Draco up the elevator (it was very fast, compared the ones Draco had been in; it only took a second to get up three floors) and into a spacious room. It had a big white technobed, with white tables and wardrobes and basically white everything.
“Hey. Wanna team up?” Draco looked up from the Rubik’s Cube he was trying to solve to see Harry Potter standing there, looking  slightly sheepish.

.” Draco hissed.
“I think we should make him suffer for a while, love,” Malfoy grinned. “He’s been annoying me ever since he came in.”
Draco knew that he couldn’t follow them inside, and sat outside of the hospital on the stone floor, panting and finally resting his strained muscles.

Harry was lounging on the chaise in his room, reading a large novel. He looked up and smiled.
He shook his head. “No.”
There was a loud silence for a few minutes until it was broken by a cart full of teacups and crockery and miscellaneous household items speeding into the room.
“No, I won’t,
"Nice face mask." Harry snickers.
The look on Kore’s face would have scared the hell out of a lesser man.
Draco is already arranging (cramming, actually) his hair care products on the tiny sink in their shared bathroom when Harry walks in on him. He gapes at the sink.
“What’s wrong?’ Harry kept asking.
“This is…” He trailed off, unable to continue.
He stabbed and hacked and swung ferociously, but they still managed to bite his side, making him scream in agony.
“What?” Draco asked, disoriented.
There were a
"What are you watching, love?"
Draco was very, very worried. It had been two days since his father had gone, and he still wasn’t back.
Harry laughed. “Come on, let’s get you home.”
“Draco!” He turned to see Cormac stumble in, out of breath. Draco crossed his arms and raised an eyebrow.
