Draco found himself genuinely surprised. He’d thought this might be a solution to the tension that accumulated in Potter’s shoulders that morning at Gringotts. “May I inquire as to your reasons for refusal? Only Heads of Houses are required to remain on the grounds overnight, and they’ve added a day nursery for the children of faculty.”
“Acrobats, jugglers, and performers, like my aunt, and seers and booths where you can buy things or win prizes—”
“Better.”
’d Clark’s wand back over to them.
Hiram finally left, peering over his shoulder at Harry for so long that he nearly walked himself into the door frame. Harry sighed.
“Oh, and all them are just so good at standing up to bullies, like it’s easy as that?" Clark questioned, "Especially if that bully has a gun? Or a wand or whatever? Because it’s not. There were loads of times at my old school where I probably should have said something, you know, when some poor kid was getting shoved around, but I didn’t, just because I didn’t want the arseholes hassling me, instead. And I feel shitty about it now, and I like to think I would stick up for them now, too. I mean, I would definitely stick up for Hiram if he needed it, but then I was too scared."
Harry read the note over Draco’s shoulder. “Your mum didn’t know either?” Harry asked, feeling mildly comforted by the fact.
“You’ve got to pay the galleons to be added to the list,” Draco explained. “Once you’re on the list, it will appear for you.”
He was pleasantly surprised. He’d sort of expected her skills not quite match her proclamation from the weekend, but sketched onto the parchment was a coiled Wyvern around two crossed brooms, a golden snitch hovering nearby. The scales were detailed and the creature had a fierce, determined expression.
Draco’s mouth flattened into a rigid line. “No,” he said coldly. “I went to the kitchens and had Winky fix me a snack. But glad to see your trust in me is as robust as ever.”
Harry watched as the little Slytherin sunk forward, still shaking, his face a blotchy mess which he hid in Draco’s chest.
“And getting to know one another.”
“It’s a valid question. I would look at the results, personally,” Draco offered. “If what you’re doing is actively helping propel you forward and you have things that you can point to as proof of your growth, then splendid. If it’s making you feel like shit all the time, it may be time for a new approach.”
CW: alcohol use
“No,” he yawned cavalierly.
“You can identify however you want, Harry, you know that,” Hermione offered, kindly.
Headmistress McGonagall invited the guests to partake. Harry descended the steps from the makeshift platform and was immediately enveloped by a teary-eyed Molly Weasley.
This chapter contains the first smut of the sequel if you wish to skip it, I might recommend scrolling past the portion between the first and second /// ///. More detailed CWs will be given in the end notes if you want specifics!
“Can we teach Goyle some Occlumency?” Harry asked.
Before Hermione could say another word, Harry was off like a shot.
Also my next post might be a Clark and Karanjeet coda for the last couple of chapters. Likely 3rd person Clark POV. I won't include it in this story since it obviously doesn't fit with the POV and so that folks who don't like OCs can skip it, but I will probably link it to this story as a like part of the series. I don't think it will include any spoilers or critical information, I just can't get it out of my head! So yeah, if you're interested, keep your eyes out for that! (Or I might change my mind and not bother after all, I just wanted to give people a head's up to explain why there would be a new story in the series when this story isn't complete).
“James!” Harry interrupted the tirade, pressing a hand to the boy’s chest to keep him from physically going for his brother. Harry kept his temper, but only barely. “That is enough. Look around, this room looks as though it’s been torn through by a whole tizzy of fairies. No one could find a single thing in here. I’m certain Al would have no reason to take your things.”
Hermione’s chin tilted up, “He had that coming. As I was saying, Malfoy and I could have a bit of a duel, but with you two stepping in to demonstrate protective maneuvers throughout. It’s informative, it’s useful, it shows we trust him.”
“Can we wake him up?” Harry asked, “Now that he won’t be in as much pain? I just used a stunning spell—he asked me to—I tried to keep it gentle.”
Draco felt ashamed for ever dismissing Potter as a man without depth. “I’m sorry,” he said softly. “It was ludicrous of me not to have considered all this. I can sympathise with those feelings, truly. I should have seen them at once.”
“I was,” Draco confessed. “I had no right.”
“Sure thing,” Jamie said amiably. This work wasn’t exactly thrilling, but it was methodical and he liked the way Professor Malfoy talked to him, like he was interesting in his own right, and not just because he was the son of Harry Potter. That was all some of Jamie’s others teachers seemed to see, and Jamie was sick of it. “How about you? What did you want to be when you were my age?”
"They've forced your hand. If they'd treat you with decency and allow you your privacy, you wouldn't have to do this song and dance. But they don't, so you do. Hopefully just in the short term, though, Harry. They'll surely find juicier gossip on someone else at some point."
“I wet the goddamn bed, Jesus!” Clark cursed, crossing his skinny arms over his equally skinny chest and looking, if possible, even more miserable. “And I said I didn’t want to talk about it.”
“Hm,” Draco intoned noncommittally. “Perhaps.” A thought came to him. “Albus, the spells’ accompanying gestures—how did you determine what would be successful?” Draco thought he had a book somewhere with the significance of rate, shape and direction, but it was a relatively rare tome, and not one he’d expect the child to have been able to find at Flourish and Blotts. “How did you decide upon the movement for
“Not a moonlighter as a cwalus-hunter, are you?” Harry asked, sipping his tea.
“Al?” Harry prompted.
Harry had shrugged, “I’m going to miss it.”
“Oh, would you just come here, already?” Harry grumbled.
“A bit funny, isn’t it?” Harry commented, “The things that matter when you’re a kid.”
Draco shrugged, “I never gave my father the go ahead for his plan. I wanted the results but I didn’t particularly care for the process. When it came down to it, I panicked,  tried to escape, and even managed it a few times, but he’d put a body bind curse on me when I wasn’t looking, and it was all over from there. I told myself it would be worth it, though, if it worked out.” Harry felt sick. “And it did,” Draco continued, “Work out, I mean. You suddenly had a reason to spend time with me, and I managed to be likable enough to get to have you.” He paused, holding tight to Harry’s hand, linking their fingers as those Harry might try to pull away. “When Mother let it slip to my father that we were friends, he wrote that he was proud of me for the first time. That was...difficult.”
Fife scowled.
“Nice work, you three,” Harry said, “circle up.” With pockets full of stones, the three students soared over to Harry, “Looking good out there,” he continued, “Clayburne, remember: you’re headed to where you think the rock is heading, not where it is. Not a perfect facsimile of course, because the snitch can always veer off course—so you have to remember to watch it carefully while also being aware of your periphery, so you don't get taken down by a well-aimed bludger. Good work, though, all of you, showing lots of improvement. Sitthi, I think you’ll seek for us tomorrow, what do you think?”
“Oh, er, yeah, sure,” Harry said, summoning a glass dish from the cupboard and doing as he was bid. He fumbled the thing as he passed it to Malfoy, too focused on the slight flush on those usually pale cheeks. Harry had incited that and now he craved further evidence. He was eager to see what other such responses he could summon up in the man. Malfoy gave him a reproachful look, steadying the dish. He added oil and rosemary and placed it in the oven.
," Clark informed him.
Draco didn’t hesitate. Harry felt his arm being lifted in the dark, Malfoy wriggling under it to burrow into Harry’s chest, one lean arm around his waist.
“Muggle what? Cauldrons?” Draco asked nonplussed. That didn’t sound quite right. What on earth would a Muggle do with a cauldron?
“It’s not that I don’t want to, Gin, I’m dying to tell you, it’s that I can’t!” Harry insisted.
Harry chuckled, and together, they leaned back against the pillows stacked up in front of the headboard, Harry’s arm still steady and comforting around him. Clark felt better, just being here.
“They won't understand! And it’s all my fault. I was the one who suggested the experiments in the first place!”
"That's nice, isn't it?" Harry said as he climbed under the covers of Draco's bed, feeling heavy and near sleep and a ways past tipsy. He'd ditched his shirt and pants, and flopped down on the mattress nude, too far gone to bother digging out something clean to wear to bed.
“Yes, yes, the new cot and things will be delivered to the cottage. And don’t worry about the boys. It’s just the end of summer anxiety, I know. They always quarrel like this when things are changing and these past few months have brought nothing but change.” Harry agreed. “I’ll talk to them.”
This is all smut, y'all. Note the increased rating and please skip if you think it is not for you! You won't miss any plot, promise.
Draco gave a grim gesture of acquiescence. He looked so drawn, so stunned. Harry could hardly stand it. He resolved to fix this as best as he could.
Harry felt a desperate, knee-jerk of defensiveness over his precious. He knew he could trust McGonagall, but the thought of losing it again...
“You haven’t?”
“Perhaps I’ll talk to Ginny; the seventh years deserve a speaker from their own year, after all. Feels a bit like we're stealing their day.”
idea appealed to him whatsoever.
As if summoned by his words, Clark and Jared appeared looking only slightly disconcerted on the drawing room hearth. Clark’s school trunk and Bird Hiram’s empty cage were beside him, as he’d be leaving for Hogwarts from Number 12 at the end of the summer. Jared had a little wheeled suitcase sporting some muggle cartoon character Harry couldn’t name.
Oh boo hoo, he snapped at himself, impatient. So things had been difficult, but that didn't mean he hadn't been loved, hadn't been safe, that wasn't the truth, he knew it wasn't. Because what he had, well and truly had, was Molly Weasley’s kitchen, surrounded by that big, bustling family who loved him, protected him, stood by him without question. Molly and Arthur. Bill and Fleur. Charlie, George, Ron, Ginny. Harry hadn't be an orphan, not in the meaningful sense of the word, for years. That thought seeded guilt, thick as tar, in the chambers of his heart, pumping sinister black ichor throughout his veins: ingrate, ingrate, his traitor heart condemned him with every pulse. Hermione was right. He hadn’t done right by Ron, he wasn’t doing right by him, still, and he had to, Merlin he
Harry shuddered, the bitter dread of a month prior stirring in his chest. “You weren’t there, you didn’t see him, the smoke, his lifeless fucking body. Merlin, Draco, I thought he was dead, he very nearly was.”
Harry nodded slowly. So, Malfoy wanted to throw his weight around a bit, feel in control. Perhaps Harry couldn’t blame him.
Dudley was loitering outside the agreed upon pub. His hair was cut close to his scalp, and Merlin, he no longer looked like a boy, but a great towering wall of a man. There was an extremely thin girl in a lot of make-up with a nervous expression hovering at his elbow.
Seamus clapped Malfoy on the back, jovially and the four made their way back towards the common room. "Oh, definitely. Just one of the perks of shagging a Gryffindor!"
“Yours?” Draco twitched an aristocratic eyebrow.
It didn’t go away after that, either.
Harry gave him a lopsided grin. “Planning on coming round to cook for us often then?” He’d meant it as a tease, but Malfoy’s customary drawl was more like a challenge when he responded:
“Fine,” Harry said, willing himself to stay still, even though everything in him was telling him to break free of Draco’s hold and
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry paused for a moment, enjoying the feeling of the Draco’s body trapped beneath his own, examining the picture before him. Malfoy’s eyes intent on his, rounded lips parted with desire. He looked small like this, almost fragile, and Harry found that he liked that. It gave him a heady rush of power. That Malfoy wanted it, wanted
“Yeah?”  Clark forgot sometimes that Harry ever got scared, even though he’d seen it first-hand.
“Great,” Neville spoke up, “so those are the main spells we want you to hone tonight,
“No,” Ron admitted, “but, after checking out the pitch and stands and the equipment shed and finding nothing, I had the brilliant idea of checking the kitchens.”
He didn’t particularly, but he wasn’t about to let Weasley know that, not with the ginger looking so outraged at the exclusion. A childish man, Draco determined disdainfully, with childish jealousies. He carefully ignored thinking about the ways in which he was currently securing Harry’s company for himself.
Before Scorpius could reassure Lily that he did not, in fact, require blood, she was gone.
“We’d know quickly enough. Harry tends to be alerted of such things.”
“Is that so?” Harry asked, trying to mask his befuddlement.
“Stop it,” Harry whispered desperately at it, “Please, just stop it.”
“Professor Malfoy!” she said, surprise evident in her voice. She at once regained her composure, however, approaching him to shake his hand neatly before greeting her nephews. “You must be Scorpius,” she said to the boy, as though she were just another schoolmate’s mum, and not a war hero well-recognised by all of wizarding Britain. “My daughter, Rose, is in your year at Hogwarts. I went to school with your father.”
“What’s got you in such a helpful mood?” Ron asked the elf, flabbergasted.
Draco was a careful wizard. He was precise and effective. His magic was tidy, but potent. He knew he was skilled. Potter’s was another beast entirely. It was reactive and coarse and raw. Hence his miserable attempts at potions, Draco supposed, remembering all of Severus Snape’s biting remarks. Potions were finicky; they required specificity in a way that defense magic rarely did. Potter never had the makings of a potions master, but that hardly mattered. Between them, he was by far the more powerful.
“Have there been any difficulties? No one’s tried anything, have they?”
“Shut up, would you?” Scorpius pleaded, wringing his serviette in his lap.
. Like he dresses smart and even though everyone hates him, he doesn’t give a fuck. He shuts people down and I bet nobody gives him any shit.”
Hermione blushed. “I intend for you and your mother to make good on this,” she insisted.
The three’s friendship was an unlikely one, considering that Fort and Jamie had been well-liked since the day they’d arrived, whereas Ri hadn’t deigned to make a single friend during his first few months in the castle. Jamie hadn’t even known the Ravenclaw existed until halfway through first year. At the time, Fort had been complaining about Professor Malfoy’s essay requirements in the library. Her whinging had been so loud and obnoxious, that a tiny strawberry blonde girl (or, it turned out, a tiny strawberry blond boy, only Jamie hadn’t known that at the time) had stomped over and said: “I’ll write the damn thing, if that will convince you to shut it for half a bloody minute!”
“Can I see your scar?” demanded another.
“Yeah, well wasn’t Mum supposed to feel the same way? She wasn’t supposed to leave either, but she bloody well did!”
“That all sounds quite nice, really,” Harry reflected.
“Sometimes,” Harry confessed. “I don’t understand it.”
“See?” Clark motioned at Harry with his fork, “Harry doesn’t care. And if you don’t do it, why should I?”
Harry was surprised to feel Draco tense beneath his touch.
. Of course he did, Draco chided himself. This was Harry Potter after all. Helping was the supposed cornerstone of the man’ s entire personality, if the gossip columns were to be believed. While Potter’s presence in the public eye had lessened over the years, he continued to pop up from time to time, lending support to various foundations and charities. Draco had seen Potter’s wooden smile and congenial handshakes with ministers splashed across a hundred
Apparently, he didn’t have anything more to add.
For a moment, Harry stood there, frozen, hearing the murmurs begin almost at once: the stares and the hurried whispers, the press of so many eyes. And yet, the only eyes Harry cared about, he realised, were the haughty, familiar grey ones right in front of him.
She steepled her fingers and tilted her head, “Speaking of, how’s your legilimency, Harry?”
Clark set his jaw. “That’s not what I meant.”
without lifting a hand.
“Sorry,” Pansy said, sincerely enough. “I’m just having a bit of trouble picturing you and Potter
“Your Valentine’s plans. It’s coming up next week.”
“Pudding’s here!” Jamie announced from the drawing room. “Let’s eat it in the garden, it’s stuffy in here with the damn fire going.”
“Probably let me die, the way things have been going,” Harry muttered darkly, he had that uncomfortable, brittle feeling he always did after a bit of cry. “He’s none too pleased with me.” Nevertheless, he conceded her point. Harry didn’t like to think about Jamie being as distraught and miserable as Malfoy had been that fateful day in the lavatory. He didn’t want any of his kids to face any decisions more difficult than what they might like to do after Hogwarts. He’d give anything to shield them from the atrocities of his youth.
“It’s not fine,” Harry corrected her, “as much as I do appreciate your help, I suspect I also take you for granted. If you could show me the ward later, I’d like to take responsibility for it.”
“Yeah,” he agreed, trying to sound more friendly than curt.
screamed the headline.
Clark looked delighted. “What did you think of Harry?” He directed his question at Draco.
He leveled his wand at her, “
When Harry’s wand lit up and started chirping early Saturday morning, he was surprised to find himself alone. He quickly silenced the alarm and groped around for his glasses, then listened for signs of life outside the canopy of Malfoy’s bed. Hearing only snoring, he hazarded parting the curtains and looking around the still-dark room. No one.
“I only know
“Portal to Scor’s house,” Al replied lazily.
“I’m sorry, Harry. No child should feel like that.” Zerk’s eye contact was steady and open. Harry couldn’t remember the last time he’d really felt like a child. He felt incompetent all the bloody time, but childlike?
“What for?”
It was all Harry could do to keep his jaw from falling open. His neck and ears burned with pleasure.
“I didn’t want to,” Draco breathed, “I didn’t, he—he said he would—”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You’ll not like it if I say,” Pansy pouted.
"Harry," Draco's voice was stern and tinged with concern, "Wake up." There was a smart tap to his cheek and Harry flicked the hand away. The second his eyes fluttered open, Malfoy popped a toffee between his teeth and Harry almost choked on it. He sat up.
Clark passed it over. “Take a sip, then. Just be careful.”
Clark did not turn up for breakfast. Harry felt his heart rate go from moderately concerned to utterly terrified as the minutes marched along.
spells' efficacy in extinguishing fiendfyre, please make your way to the new Slytherin dormitory immediately to aid the professors. Those with full moon buddies, please remain here. Everyone else: spectators are not permitted! I must ask you all to remain in the great hall until we have further instructions from the faculty! Ginny, if you would be so kind as to use the Slytherin class list to take attendance?”
“Yeah,” Harry answered, grateful for some semblance of normalcy. “Hogwarts has secured the three of us a cottage in Hogsmeade. Lily’s a bit nervous about starting somewhere new, but the village school offers after school care, and she’s a social little thing. I’m hopeful she’ll make friends before long.”
“I’d say that all sounds rather lovely, except the speeches. Merlin, I would love to never have to give another speech again.” Harry planted his face in the crook of the other boy's neck. Draco's hand slid over the back of his head, smoothing down unruly locks.
“Yes, Harry,” breathed Malfoy, eyes not leaving his. His cloak folder over the stone table, Draco next removed his jumper. He was about to toss it to the floor when Harry interrupted him.
Harry folded himself along the lines of Draco’s back like he had done so many nights before. He buried his nose in the hair above his ear and inhaled.
“Merlin, Malfoy! I’m just trying to keep you and your friends and kids like Hiram from having the stuffing knocked out of them for no good reason. If you have a better idea, I’m all ears!”
“I told him about Scorpius’
“Well, hullo, then,” Harry murmured.
"I see," the Headmistress folded her hands upon the top of her desk, "Let me make some discreet inquiries, see if anyone has noticed anything else about Wilma Brown's behaviour or whereabouts that would give us cause to suspect. I commend you all for bringing this to me. I will be sure to keep you apprised of the situation as it unfolds."
“What if she doesn’t?” Clark breathed, “What if she is just gone?”
, Tiering was thinking,
McGonagall held up a hand, “I understand and appreciate your anger, Mr. Potter, and Mr. Malfoy, my deepest regrets for what you went through.”
takes the risk out of the deflection that occurs with a regular
“Our Lavender always spoke so highly of you, Harry, love,” a pale, round-faced woman was saying. Oh Merlin, Harry wasn’t sure he could do this, “I still remember that letter she wrote home from school, telling us she’d been sorted into the same house as
He followed the idea of the day’s breakfast farther back, through the boiling of the water and the toasting of the bread, and decided to eliminate anything that would give the truth away. He imagined himself entering the kitchen and thinking ‘What shall it be today?’. That would be his starting place, the healthy branch from which he would prune away this unneeded scrap of time. His end point would be leaving the kitchen after tidying up the breakfast dishes. The bookends so identified, he turned his attention to motive: ‘I wish to forget this’. And, he found, he wasn’t lying. He was very determined to see if the spell carried any weight or if Albus and Scorpius were just choosing to believe something that brought them a bit of comfort. Draco raised his wand, traced the pattern in the air, and spoke the words: “
“That’s not true!” Jamie argued fiercely. “He’s a nice kid. I like him, okay? For once in my life, I’m not trying to piss you off, alright? I’m not going to do anything to mess with him. Honestly, Al, you really think I’m that much of an arsehole?”
“It’s fine, Potter, truly,” Draco reiterated.
Harry felt himself flush stupidly. “You wouldn’t, I guess?”
“Do I look upset?” Draco asked.
He tapped his forehead sleepily so Draco would know it was alright to give him a goodnight kiss.
“Er, sorry, no,” Scorpius admitted. “He’s not exactly direct. And I, well, had a bit of a long day, you know how it is.” He didn’t want to whinge about the effects of his potion, and he couldn’t let on in front of Boone, anyway, but Merlin, he really was so very tired. “But I ought to call it a night. What time is it?”
the door before allowing himself to be consumed by Draco’s enthusiastic lips pressing against his own.
Harry knew he shouldn’t push, should accept Draco’s verdict, leave his tea half drunk and be on his way. Then again, backing down from a challenge had never really been one of Harry’s strengths.
“Merlin,” Hermione breathed, “That’s lovely and I’m genuinely very happy for you both, but please consider investing in an actual publicist? I’m sure I’m not equipped to deal with the fallout from
Draco shivered, apparently liking the idea despite himself. “Merlin, you really are such a self-righteous bastard.”
Despite his nerves, it felt wonderful to be on his broom again, after sitting for so long. Harry found himself enjoying the challenge, zipping along the track, zigging and veering and zagging at a moment’s notice, never knowing what direction he would be expected to go in until the very last second. He could vaguely see the colours of the pitch—the blue and black blur of the stands and the bright green of the grass below—but it was as if his vision was obscured by a wrinkled film of cellophane. He didn’t focus on that, though, just the sudden dips and whorls of the yellow light spurring him forward.
. Trying to do right by him, by the children, and, also by myself, I’ll not deny that." Granger’s expression was neutral, but non-judgmental, and it somehow invited such confidences, and so he continued. "And yet my selfishness, which I would suspect is present in anyone in such matters—we don’t pursue people for purely altruistic purposes—is the only aspect of all this your husband can appreciate. He is convinced I’m pursuing some mad schemes to corrupt and abuse Harry. And it seemed so ludicrous that I played into his foolishness, for a lark. He cast me so easily in the role of villain that I thought, why not have a bit of fun? Why show him courtesy if he wasn’t willing to do the same? But it’s nothing insidious, Granger. I almost wish it was.” He gave a dry laugh. “Then at least I’d be treading familiar ground.”
Scorpius was lovingly tucking some dead dung beetles into the soil for his fungi to feed upon when he felt something small smack against his temple and fall into the dirt in front of him. It was a balled up bit of parchment. He didn’t need to look across the aisle of the greenhouse to know who it was from.
Malfoy pulled away, only to trace a path with his mouth down to the collar of Harry’s T-shirt. The final kiss was replaced with the gentle pressure of Malfoy’s forehead against Harry’s clavicle.
Spells, we can put them into action,” Harry—Professor Potter, Scorpius really needed to remember to call him that—was saying. They were out on the Quidditch pitch again. Most Defence classes seemed to occur on the clipped lawn, and Scorpius couldn’t say he minded. It was a nice break from classrooms, and the September days were still plenty warm.
“What’s wrong with you?” Mulligan demanded. “Is it serious?”
The next week was spent in a haze of homework and research. Harry was struggling to focus on N.E.W.T.s when the cwalus question loomed so large, despite Draco and Hermione’s urgings that both areas warranted his attention. It felt like a fruitless and exhausting effort. When cwalu were mentioned at all, it was mostly to insist they didn’t exist or to preach avoidance. Hermione was also compiling notes on trapping and destroying banshees and Glaistig.
“I do,” Harry acknowledged.
Before Draco could interject, Scorpius piped in, his delicate features twisted in dubious contemplation. “I don’t know, Al,” he began. “Is life really supposed to be that easy? Like what if then people forget the lessons they learn or just cut out years of their life? Then they won’t know what they’re forgetting, even! Or who!”
Harry tore into it eagerly, as Seamus and Dean resumed the festivities, pantomiming a rather obscene bit of narrative to the whoops of the easily amused audience.
Al looked conflicted for a moment before darting down the hall.
“It’s perfectly alright,” Draco replied, politely, examining the wallpaper.
Lily’s bright blue eyes shifted. “Is that true? Is it safe?”
The banter felt casual but the air between them felt crisp and brittle, like it could break apart at any second. Harry hated the feeling of forced normalcy. Draco must have sensed it, too, because his tone was muted and unsure when he asked, "You really think a publicist can help?”
“Mm,” Draco murmured, linking his fingers with Harry’s, “good thing you’ve got me to keep you humble.”
“The first time I took it, it was taking me away from everything, it was promising something new. I still get just a hint of that now, like scent memory.”
“Shit,” Clark breathed. “I’m so sorry, Harry, I didn’t think. I just thought you’d be pissed, maybe, or annoyed, or maybe you'd not find out at all. I didn't expect...that. I didn’t mean for it to affect you so.”
reaction. He felt heat rise to his face. He supposed backing out now would be ever more suspect, so he grabbed his wand and cast a quick
“It was a gamble," Malfoy continued, "but once one student acted on it, it was like a floodgate and a mob mentality situation broke out with the other Slytherins firing off any curse they could think of. Bad luck for you, Awling doesn’t mess around, and she knows what she’s doing. She feels terribly, for the record.”
“You can’t be serious,” Draco knew he was gaping like a damn codfish but Potter couldn’t truly be this thick, could he?
“Well spotted, Miss Granger,” the headmistress smiled over the lens of her eyeglasses, “Yes, it would seem this spell lacks an
“Not likely, mate,” Dean gave him an easy smile, “Believe me, no one will take me when there’s you two up for grabs. Anyway, that’s not what has Weasley and I scheming.“
“Your glasses?”
Harry knew he was just being protective, but still it rankled. “Leave it,” he muttered, “I don’t just dissolve into madness every time I walk by the grand staircase.”
Extra special thanks to my fantabulous beta,
Clark watches Draco fix him tea, the pretty silver tongs dropping two cubes into a teacup. Everything here is pretty and useful and stinks of wealth. It’s the opposite of mum’s shabby flat with its third-hand wares and Clark hates himself for preferring such indulgent luxuries like sugar tongs and matching teacups and not having to organise every little thing himself because Mum's having a rough patch. It must make him lazy to prefer having a house-elf make the meals and do the shopping, and having Draco and Harry make sure he and Jared are fed and clothed and have all their school supplies and see Healers when they need them.
“She always had the option of telling you," Teddy pointed out. "I grew up here; I never felt I couldn’t admit things to you, even when I knew I’d made a mess of something.”
“Harry, you didn’t!” Hermione hissed.
“What’s happened?” he asked blearily.
“Ha,” Malfoy replied, straightening his jumper as if hugging put undue wrinkles into it, “I meant generally speaking.”
“I think that’s enough for tonight,” Harry interrupted. “Everyone’s tired, let’s leave it. Thank you for taking care of Scorpius tonight, Jamie. He’s lucky to have two good friends. Get some sleep, now.”
“He didn’t have much choice,” Harry informed his son. “He’d have been tortured or worse if he’d said a word against Voldemort.”
“I don’t believe so, no. A little nauseous is all.”
Clark shook his head, as if irritated, but he didn’t reject it outright.
“Family is not about joy, child! It is about responsibility, honour, duty!”
Scorpius fumbled in his cloak pocket for his silver pocket watch. He tapped the crown, and the engraved case swung outward. Scorpius made sure to take note of the position of the second hand, lest he fail his first task as timekeeper.
“Yes, well, I don’t suspect Anthea will keep her down for long, considering Lily can already rattle off a list of new friends as long as your arm,” Harry chuckled.
“What are you doing?” Lavender screeched, “What the hell do you think you are doing?”
“James, Albus,” Malfoy gave the boys each a nod, before his eyes returned to Harry, who was attempting to shush Remy, still squalling in his arms. “Have I mistaken the date?”
“‘What’s going on with her,’ pah! You and Hermione are both the same, and I won’t hear it. I don’t care if Ginny’s suddenly decided she needs to find herself, or whatever excuse she’s using to justify her betrayal. She could be leading an aid effort in the Congo or ensuring intergalactic peace and it wouldn’t change my mind about her a fig. You don’t walk out on your family without a word. You don’t abandon your children.”
Harry swatted him while Ron bloomed red from his neck to the tips of ears. Hermione gave a small, pleased smile as she watched the three of them.
He remembered that evening: tidying up the mess of colourful paper and tags, Ginny asking him if he’d made a list of the gifts so she could send off thank-you notes, his reply that he had. It felt very much like all their days: affectionate smiles and ease and the comfort of routine. She had been tired, certainly, but that was hardly unusual with pregnancy, but there must have been something else there. Harry thought about Hermione’s words from the kitchen, her chiding him for his obliviousness. What signals had he missed? And what’s more, how could he stop himself from missing them again?
“Oh yeah, and what’s that?”
“You’re brilliant, Pie,” Harry told him. Meat Pie nipped his finger with a bit more force than necessary, and took off into the dark summer sky.
Harry was in a group with Neville, Mandy Brocklehurst, and Goyle, and they were sent off towards the greenhouses.
Draco stared at the house key in his hand, and Harry felt his heart race. Fuck, it had been too soon. He’d thought it would be alright, especially after what Draco had said this afternoon...but maybe he’d misread it. He just...
, he was so much stronger and Draco couldn’t stop him and
Harry thought about Voldemort’s power rushing through him, those shared memories, interrogations, he’d seen it done, felt it done, something whispered he could do it, if he wanted.
“I think it’s rather surviving a war and losing loads of people you love that’s made you melancholy,” Malfoy said, voice uncharacteristically gentle.
, it was suddenly so clear and he didn’t know why he hadn’t realised it before, hadn't realised it a hundred times over, every day they spent together. He raised his head and found those pale grey eyes.
“Mr. Potter,” Professor Longbottom sighed. “I’ve ignored not one, but three instances of note passing, and I simply cannot allow a fourth. Ten points from Slytherin, and I’m terribly sorry, but I’m afraid you’ll have to spend your evening here replanting your Gremlin Pods.”
“Well,” Ri began, “while ignoring Professor Binns in class today—I read a complete history of the Goblin wars when I was eight and prefer intersectional perspectives to Binns’ antiquated—”
“It might not,” Harry tells him. “We can encourage her to take her meds again tomorrow. No harm, no foul, and all that.”
Harry cast a Disillusionment Charm, then took the Floo from Hogwarts to the Leaky Cauldron. He checked his watch. Remy would still be napping for another hour. Teddy could keep an eye on the other three until then. Harry leant against a wall, debating his next steps. If he’d not been at risk of being overheard, he might have gone straight to Malfoy Manor, to admit to Draco that he’d bollocksed everything up tremendously. Even now, he wanted to. But who was to say the Malfoy wards would even grant him access? He knew Malfoy wouldn’t approve of his simply stopping by. But Teddy was leaving to travel with friends tomorrow before returning to uni, and Harry wouldn’t have anyone to watch the children, and then it would be Friday and Draco may or may not be showing up at Harry’s house, and he’d be furious to learn alongside Ron and Hermione of Harry’s complete reversal of plans.
“It’s not that,” Jamie protested. “I don’t care what he says, he just likes to try and get to me. What bothers me is that it turns out Scorpius also likes the books, and we’ve chatted about it a handful of times, and now, all the sudden, Al likes it, too? I think he just wants Scor to like him. Which he already does, but he’s so weird about it, like he doesn’t want anyone else to be friends with Scorpius, only him. It’s stupid and it’s...hypocritical, isn’t it?”
“How come?” Draco inquired.
For a moment, Draco didn’t know to whom she was referring. Then her teasing about his adventures in Brazil surfaced. Merlin, his time in the rainforest felt like a lifetime ago. He’d not thought of Rudá since his return.
“Feeling lucky, Potter?” he asked.
“It’s alright,” Potter said, lightly, letting the tightness around his mouth lapse. He shot Draco what might have been a grateful expression.
“No flies on you, eh, Harry?”
“And give her proof that not only am I a failure as a husband, but I’m a failure as a father as well?” Harry asked darkly.
“I think he will. Just have a little patience. Jamie’s having a tough go of it.”
“Do they seem to be upset?” asked Hermione.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Nice to meet you, Harry, dear,” said the aunt, “It is my honour, truly. We owe you a debt we can never repay, I fear.”
“Draco,” he said with soft concern, “I forgave you the moment I saw you. This was never about me, I told you that. It wasn't something I needed so much as something you needed to give. What I am is hideously proud and tremendously impressed and utterly besotted.”
The words hit Harry harder than he expected, but of course, that made sense, they needed to be careful. “Right, of course, I’ll–”
boys, not in the way people talked about. It seemed to him like a waste of time when there was so much else to do. Granny always loved to tease him and say it was only a matter of time. It was irritating.  “And none of your business.”
Harry rolled on his side, returning his mouth to Draco’s, one hand on the other boy’s jaw, and the other on himself.
“It’s all settled now, Friar. We’ll get it fixed up, I’m certain of it.” He turned back to the panting, exhilarated students crowded behind him. "Good work, everyone. Back to the great hall, let's see what's next."
Harry's heart hadn't been prepared for that. Half of him wanted to just sink to the ground and snog Draco silly and say it wasn't true, in fact is was rather the reverse, that he, actually, was entirely Draco's, despite himself and everything. The rest of him somehow knew better. He knew it was easier for Malfoy to say the things he needed to when they were like this, when Harry was drawing them out of him, when he could pretend he didn't have a choice.
“James,” Harry said, voice deathly serious. The rest of the table fell silent. “Drawing room. Now.”
“Because they can’t be unsaid!” Draco bristled. “Now that I've told you I like those things, it’s out there. I can’t take these frankly
Draco and Harry arrived back at the eighth year common room to the usual evening milling-about. Small groups of students were gathered to chat or to study. Neville was near the fire with Millie's black cat curled up in his lap, and Harry couldn't say exactly who was looking more content. Hermione and Pansy were intent on their arithmancy texts, quills flying, matching determined expressions.
"No...mean names," Draco muttered. "Please."
Harry ran a thumb along the path Draco’s tongue had just traced before sliding it between his teeth. Draco sucked obediently while Harry considered the question.
“The last day of school, just before I left.”
“Everyone says Draco was a Death Eater,” Clark whispered.
CW: vague discussion of past trauma
? Harry, you robbed a bank? Why aren’t you in prison? Does the minister know he just handed me off to a criminal?”
“No,” Neville said automatically, then inhaled. “Wait, is that smoke?”
“Like my arsehole, Harry,” he clipped, “Merlin, if you can’t say it, I suppose I don’t have much hope of you wanting to do it.”
“I don’t know,” Draco replied, doing his best to seem cavalier. “The courts, of course, were told some version of the truth and as such awarded me custody. After that, I made her forget about Scorpius’ illness: I plucked every last tendril of it from her memory myself. Of course, now she thinks I’m keeping him from her out of a sense of my own superiority and the resulting judgmental spite. I’ve told her she is welcome to see him should she leave off on her dependence to potions, but she declares she cannot so long as I am keeping her child from her.”
The beautiful bird only looked at him, then seemed to settle into a relaxed roost. With his presence came a sense of certain peace, and Harry allowed himself to drift off into darkness.
“Do you do much travelling for your work?” Draco asked her.
She looked at him, alarmed. He sprung up from the sofa and went to her. “Will you come get me? How do I get back to school? Can I get post here? My post goes to Hogsmeade and I can’t fix that just now and…”
behind.
“Let’s see it, then,” Harry said, resigned. It was morning and he’d been escorted to the same room he had met Zerk in the evening prior by a very stony-faced administrator. Even Zerk’s expression lacked the calm of the night before.
“So obedient. What else do you need to atone for?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Master is not required to keep Kreacher informed of his comings and goings,” the old elf informed him dourly, “Kreacher knows when children come home from school.”
George left the evening of Boxing Day. Everyone told Harry that he needed to get back to the shop to give his assistants some relief. Harry knew they were just being kind. He offered to be the one to leave several times. He was almost willing to spend the remainder of the holiday alone at Grimmauld Place if it meant a reprieve from the endless tension, but Mrs. Weasley wouldn’t hear of it. He hid in the living room with Constance while everyone said their goodbyes. He held out some fancy owl treats that Draco’s eagle owl had delivered that morning with a note:
“My apologies for the dark,” she said, “an accident left me unable to abide the light. It nearly took my voice, too, so I will ask for your continued silence when I am speaking.”
“Yeah,” Harry agreed. “Yeah, me too.”
“You were there?” he hissed.
“Making friends?” Harry could help but remark, “That’s excellent, really excellent.”
“What else.”
“Oh, I don’t just think I’m clever, I
“As do we all, and I’ve no doubt, with time, we will.”
“Not like this,” he said. His voice was clear and firm and for that he was grateful. “I’ve no interest in hurting you if you’ve no wish to be hurt. And I certainly won’t punish you for whatever your perceived failure is, especially not without you telling me what’s happened in the first place. Is that understood?”
"I know," Clark replied. "It was just a dream."
“Certainly you’d not turn to making your own tea?” Draco challenged.
“Did you know about them?” Harry asked Malfoy, trying to keep his tone casual.
“Yeah, Molly’s coming over first thing, so I can run things back and forth from Hogsmeade all day.”
“Don’t suppose you know how to stop them?”
Okay, I decided to make it 3 parts and Draco POV instead? Idk, thanks for reading, though <3
“Hm,” Lily considered this, briefly scanning Draco’s face, “Am I pestering you, Professor Malfoy?”
“Of course you do,” Draco agreed at once. “I’d never ask you to do otherwise.”
Harry had barely seen his children all afternoon. Al was sprawled in the back garden staring into the sky. When Harry had asked the boy what he was up to, Al had said only 'Meditation,' and refused to offer any further explanation. Lily was deep into some make-believe, he could hear her little voice chirping away behind her closed door. The boys had grown out of that stage quite a bit earlier, but Lily seemed less in a hurry to let it go. Her stuffed toys were a captivated audience, clearly. Jamie hadn’t emerged from his lair at all.
Harry returned his lips to the white scars splashed across Malfoy’s chest as he unhooked the button atop the trousers, and unfastened the flies. He stripped Malfoy of those along with his pants and socks, until the man was naked, still poised carefully on his bare toes. Harry palmed Malfoy’s impatient cock.
“What do you mean?”
Hermione didn’t look pleased but she didn’t press.
“Everyone else seems to bear up okay,” Harry observed, feeling embarrassed. Why did he have to get like this?
He was sneering at the floral cuffs of Draco’s shirt and Draco felt a thrill of cold fury run through him at the accusation.
Jamie’s mumbled words caught Harry so off guard that he smacked his head on the top of the cupboard. But even that throbbing pain couldn’t take away from the buoyant hope bobbing about in his chest.
Harry slapped his ass and Draco screamed.
After a few more pats to Constance, Jared padded back into the drawing room to stand beside Clark.
“I don’t suppose she’d be amenable to a conversation,” Ron supposed, shoving another obscure text across the library table in defeat.
“I’d trust Hermione before either of you,” he declared.
“Watch his face as you go,” the matron directed, “Mr. Malfoy fancies himself a tough little soldier and won’t always admit to the pain.”
“I am. I want to take it. Tell me. What were you going to do next?”
“I...you’re...that’s not what I...” Harry slumped, hiding his face in Draco’s cotton vest. “I didn’t mean to...fuck. I don’t know. I’m sorry. Fuck...I. Sorry. Just, sorry.”
“And then you saved my life,” Draco continued.
“Right. I don’t see what that has to do with me?” Harry replied obstinately, leaning back against the kitchen counter, arms crossed. He could feel a headache pricking at his temples. Lovely.
“No,” Potter agreed. “And here I am moping again. Sorry. My problem is that it’s only ever one branch of the Weasley family or another here for a visit. I’m not used to actual guests. Merlin’s teeth, I really am pants at this whole hostessing thing.” He gave Draco an abashed little half grin.
“It’s hardly tea time conversation, darling, I don’t wish to spoil Harry’s afternoon.”
“Yes, of course. Anything else I can do for you?”
“You can make it up to me by spilling all the details of your intimate encounter with Harry Potter! Who I didn’t know was into blokes, by the way, is this a new development?”
“And things went poorly between us...” Draco answered, picking up the thread. “I wouldn’t want to bring that into the workplace.”
“Breathe,” Harry commanded.
“I assumed,” Malfoy replied. “There’s a tawse in the kitchen, tucked in one of the grocery bags.”
“He likes that,” Lily affirmed, and commenced her reading.
Draco did.
“Oh, he’s seduced me alright, just look at him." Professor McGonagall made a strangled noise from behind him that she attempted to cover with a cough.  Harry ignored her, ploughing onwards. "No magical means were required to get me into Draco's bed. And you’re welcome to take that back to your supervisor. We’re done here. Don’t bother us again.”
"Can you tell him?" Al asked, eyes nervously downcast.
Harry awoke early that last morning in Grimmauld Place, curled close to Draco. Pale winter light seeped in through the cracks around curtains in the ugly little room, illuminating the overwrought furniture and musty carpet. He tightened the arm he had slung over Draco’s waist and nuzzled his face into the pale skin of his neck, inhaling the sweet smell of his shampoo.
“What would you like to do, Harry?” Hermione spoke again.
“Thank you, Jamie,” Harry said. “I really do appreciate it.”
“Tell me,” Draco commanded.
Hermione examined Malfoy over the rim of her tumbler. “How did you know everyone would fall into line, like that. I’m surprised no one fired off a curse when you approached.”
Draco was still on his knees, his hands extended. Harry felt deep revulsion as he discerned the damage done. It was as though every bone from Draco's fingers to his shoulders had been snapped. Each digit was crimped like a crinkle-cut chips, his arms were bent in awful, disturbing angles. They looked more like gnarled branches of a tree than anything human. He was shaking.
Harry sleepwalked through the rest of his day, flanked by Ron and Hermione as much as possible. Dean, Seamus and Neville shot him concerned looks. Ginny offered to knock out Malfoy’s perfect teeth, and Pansy made him promise to give Draco the benefit of the doubt, at least for now. Harry responded as succinctly as possible, with the same tired smile.
“You’re right,” Harry murmured, “I didn’t think, I’m sorry.”
He checked his pocket watch. Potter had left ninety minutes ago, and he ought to be home by now. Merlin, if something had happened to Remy, Draco would have Weasley’s head, so help him. But no, more likely it was just a busy evening in St. Mungo’s A&E, and a baby in no apparent distress was unlikely to jump the queue, even if it was Harry Potter’s baby. Although, Draco thought, knowing Harry, he’d likely cast a disguise of sorts, not wanting special treatment or some rot. The man really was nauseatingly noble.
Malfoy sneered: “My son has exactly one friend, Potter. If he were to run away, where do you think he would go?”
“You ought to get out in the sun once in a while,” he murmured, giving into his urge to suck a love bite into Malfoy’s waiting flesh.
it, turned a bright scarlet, muttered something about Hermione, and scurried off.
“That was really well done,” Harry encouraged him, “You were off to a strong start there, truly. You were able to direct your thoughts—”
“Come along, darling,” Draco said, taking Harry’s hand. “Let’s get back.”
The Burrow was all bustle and baked goods. Everyone was home for the holidays, and the house was full of voices. Arthur Weasley had magicked some precarious-looking bunkbeds in the bedrooms—no one had a room to themselves—and Hermione and her parents had pitched Perkins’ tent in the yard and were sharing it with Bill and Fleur. Despite all the holiday biscuits and good cheer, nothing could quite mask the wound that was Fred’s absence. More than once, Harry had walked in to the kitchen to find Mrs. Weasley dabbing her eyes and staring out the window. He’d try to console her only to get an affectionate pat to his cheek and the reassurance that she was fine, and that she better check on the mincemeat tarts, or shortbread, or whatever her most recent offering was.
“It’s no trouble to keep him here for the night,” Harry blurted out. “You can Apparate home and Floo back in the morning. Or I can make up one of the guest rooms if you’d rather stay close. With a family as big as Gin’s, we have several.”
As usual, an incredibly heartfelt thank you to Mimbelwimbel, my super fantastic beta for her endless hours of work, her patience, and her invaluable insight. This was truly a better piece of writing because of her.
’? It was likely, he supposed, because she’d not given him a sliver of an opportunity.
CWs: mentions of canon-compliant violence and ableist language.
“What do you mean?” Harry inquired, puzzled.
“Poor chap, he’s in sore need of that. I hope he’ll sleep through the night at last.”
Draco didn’t hesitate, the soothing thrum of surrender taking hold of him. He sank down, then spun, kneeling between Harry and the end of the large, neatly made bed.
Thrilled with the desire lacing Malfoy’s voice, Harry obliged, scraping his teeth over the bared jugular, the ropey muscles, the swell of his trapezius. There, he bit down harder, imagining the neat row of indents he would leave in Malfoy’s skin. A wild, reckless part of him wished he could mark him like that forever. Draco shuddered, crying out.
Shout-out to my intrepid beta, Mimbelwimbel for facing down my rough drafts and also for writing the final chapter of her first ever story, Storm Chasers!!
“Yes,” Harry agreed. “He really does.”
“Yes. And then, if you are happy with my work, which you absolutely will be, a retainer for all the inevitable little fires that pop up around someone of Harry’s renown.”
“My word, don’t tell me I’ve finally managed to say something that stuck?” Pansy beamed.
“Did you ever encounter any Glaistig?”
“Certainly,” Draco agreed. “There’s a few weeks left of summer and it’s no fun for him to wander the Manor all day while I work. We’ll sort something out.”
“Didn’t you, though?” Scorpius asked.
Harry had been; bloody hell, it had been something to behold. He resolved to bring that Harry to the surface once again.
“Nothing does, is the thing,” Harry replied, thoughtfully, “his past is never going to go away. But so far as I can tell, we have two choices. We say he is who he was and that’s who he’ll always be, or we say he was who he was and now he’s trying to be something better and we give him a chance to fucking change. Because I just don’t see how making people pay for their crimes indefinitely does anything but breed more resentment and make them more settled in their hatred. What did I save his damn life for if we're then not going to give him a chance to live it?”
He rolled off the other boy, breathing laboured.
“A gathering,” Hermione corrected primly, “a friendly gathering of legal-aged witches and wizards having a few drinks and cataloging some mail. And Harry, you do need to get to Hogsmead tomorrow to sort this all out.”
“Hm,” Scorpius assented, leaning in to get a better look at the spine of the books the two older students had stacked in front of them. He read:
She patted his arm, “Thanks for telling me, Harry, that takes courage.”
“None to speak of,” she assured him.
“It’s the fires,” Hermione replied.  Her voice was high with tension. “No sooner does one get extinguished than another one gets ignited. We’re sending bloody children to face it; it’s only a matter of time before something goes wrong. Hell, Harry, this wasn’t supposed to happen. After Voldemort, kids were just supposed to get to be kids. It isn’t right!”
“Harry, it worries and saddens me that this is your idea of trivial. That was quite a major event. Anyone would want to unpack it.”
“Do you find a great deal of women attractive?” Draco asked simply.
“Harry, these are Hiram’s brothers: Ben, Adam, Caleb and Aron.” He touched the heads of the small boys one at a time. “Boys, this is Harry Potter. Ben, can you go find your brother, please?” One of the kids scampered off.
I’ll let you in on it.”
A vision of Lavender began to solidify before his eyes, across from him in the real world. She was silver and ephemeral as a ghost, but as he watched, her abdomen bloomed with brilliant red blood. As deep red as it had been that day, soaking out of her clothes on to the stone floor.
Harry cupped the back of Draco’s neck and gave a gentle squeeze. Draco shut his eyes.
“Enough,” Harry said and Draco withdrew with a cry. He pulled his arm out from under him, gripping the sides of the desk and panting. Harry watched the rapid rise and fall of his scarred chest, leaving Draco suspended, unfulfilled.
“Good to see their journalistic integrity has not wavered,” Harry quipped, dryly, “It remains as its typical baseline of utter and absolute rubbish.”
"You tell me."
“Before we get into all that,” Harry said, “can we deal with the short term? As in the very short term?”
“I know he’s not,” Harry said. “I’m under no delusions that our whole relationship has been managed from a distance by Draco’s dad; that’s ridiculous.”
“What’s an Unspeakable?” Inquired Clark, perking up with interest.
A few minutes after entering Twilfitt and Tattings, Draco was forced to admit that he’d acted a titch too hastily. His focus, he realised, had been on putting that relieved, grateful expression on Potter’s face, and not, as it should have been, on reality. For now he was in a clothing store with his son and two of his students and he had no worldly idea what the latter required, what budget he should allow, or what Potter’s expectations might be in regards to purchases.
“Better,” Draco grumbled into his chest.
to check his watch. Only 4 am, Harry saw, relieved. The last thing he needed was to be spotted climbing out of Draco Malfoy’s bed in the morning.
“Merlin, you’re faded,” was Malfoy’s disdainful reply, but, after a quick scan of the room, he still hazarded pressing a brief kiss to Harry’s temple. It pleased Harry a great deal. “So, Weasley, I have your blessing, do I?” Malfoy asked, without much sincerity. He had a hand on Harry’s shoulder and was stroking his neck with his thumb. The comfortable, casual affection of it made Harry want to burst.
“Alright, Malfoy?” Ron said, clapping him on the back with what seemed like genuine concern.
“Breathe, darling, remember? Keep breathing. You’ll get through this, I know you will.” Harry’s attention returned to Draco’s arse. “You need some help? You want me to make you feel good, would that help?”
Another blow fell and Draco was ready for it this time, savouring the sharp burst that faded far too quickly. Draco nodded fervently into his arms, relief blooming because Harry really did understand just what he was after. Unfortunately, Harry seemed intent on taking his damn time, adding too much of this teasing nonsense in between and Draco wished he wouldn’t. It gave him too much time to think. He wanted hard and fast, wanted to blot it all out with noise and searing pain. He wiggled his hips encouragingly.
Ron stretched back with a laugh, “Nah, I think I’ll call it a day. End on a victory, you know how it is.”
Harry  gave Draco an amused look and Draco's eyes rolled skyward in exasperation. Together the rounded the corner to find Clark gazing up at a tawny barn owl with a black ringed face.
Harry forced a grin, “Afraid not, Professor. I’ve got transfiguration this morning. Speaking of, I’d better be off! Cheers.” Cheers? Merlin. Harry kicked himself. Subtle as falling bricks.
“What now, Potter,” Malfoy said, exasperated, “you look like a Neanderthal trying to solve a maths problem.”
It was Bill who reacted first, but before the
The evening was not going well. Al was yo-yoing between eagerly intent and oddly evasive, distracted even. After thirty minutes of offering helpful suggestions, Al now had his chin propped up on his palm and was eyeing the narrow window in Draco’s office as though wondering if he could use it to make a mad escape.
“I think she’s Pearl Lum’s kid sister, Ava or Ada or something like that,” Malfoy commented. “Pearl’s a Ravenclaw beater, a sixth year. Blaise dated her for a while a couple years back, so she was around the Slytherin common room fairly often. Don’t know what her little sister would have against me, though, besides the usual.”
Nearby were Uncle Neville, Aunt Hannah, and their kids—looking similarly restrained. While they were all younger than Al, he’d known the lot of them since birth, and viewed them as just another set of cousins. Al had an awful lot of cousins, Scor had commented once, and Al had been shocked to realise that Scorpius had none to speak of. Al had replied glibly that Scorpius was welcome to any of his. There were a few, like Rose, who he could do without, really.
The room inside was dark, lit only by the flames behind him. Oppressive smoke clung to the air, and there was silence. The boys were all unconscious, Harry realised, the smoke having gotten to them. Unconscious, or worse, his thoughts threatened. He swallowed hard, moving from child to child, and encasing each with a bubble of clean oxygen. Some were in bed, some on the floor as if crawling to escape. Hiram was there, a small lump in a bed near the door, passed out with the covers up over his head, and huddled into a tiny ball. His breathing was raspy and shallow but seemed to get a bit better with the charm. Merlin, where was Clark? Harry whirled round, casting another couple smothering spells at the flames that approached the entrance. He heard coughing and shouts from down the hall.
Draco smiled, not correcting the familiarity. “That will have to be an off the record revelation, I’m afraid.”
Ginny ladled some into a delicate glass, and handed it to him. Draco politely took a sip.
Harry grinned so bloody hard he thought his cheeks might split open. Their food arrived just then, breaking the odd, exhilarated tension. Harry barely remembered to thank the server this time, let alone admire his physique.
Draco know that? He couldn’t make his mind work.
“It’s hardly fair for you to expect me to act rationally when I’m now a creature of pure emotion, Harry,” she said, sounding hurt.
Thanks so much to everyone still with me and still commenting, I can't believe your thoughtfulness and generosity!
“How ghastly, and yet strangely familiar,” Draco remarked, his lips quirking. Having been a professor for a decade had left him far too aware of  the politics at play between 11 year olds. He therefore had some notion as to what Lily was going through, seeing as she was only a year younger than the latest crop of first-years. Daily Draco watched them showboat and slander, always grappling for a spot at the top of the social heap. He’d been so relieved when Scorpius hadn’t seemed bothered with all that, although he’d wondered if he ought to have considered encouraging his son to make more than one friend.
Ron rolled his eyes, “Well, what all did you hear?”
“Are you bisexual?” Hermione asked.
Hiram who Harry was addressing.
“I do,” Draco whispered. “I fucking do, Harry, please.”
“Why did Daddy think Professor Malfoy was going to hurt me?” Rose asked.
“I’m joking, Harry, no need to look so forlorn. Why would I want to sit alone listening to parents and their offspring fret over robes, parchment, and quills?”
“You told
Harry decided to rescue him. “What are you doing here?” He asked Draco, “I thought you weren’t coming back until tomorrow. Were you eavesdropping, too? Merlin, we're
“Are you...thinking about accepting it?” Jamie questioned carefully. He was biting his lip again, his dark eyebrows furrowed.
“That sounds lovely, thank you!”
“‘Course,” Ron agreed. “I’ll stick to his being a rich git and his pitiful attempts at chess.”
Harry chuckled at Ron’s assessment, understanding why Ron would have come up with the interpretation he did. “I don’t know,” he answered honestly. “I thought the same thing when he first showed up. But with time, I’ve found that he’s actually sort of, like, secretly generous although he’d never admit it, and he gives a fuck about his job and the kids, and we can just...talk. Neither of us had a good time of things growing up, so I think we understand each other on that level, and there’s shared history, in a way, with school and the war, and all. Probably helps that he’s divorced, too, so, you know, it’s nice to have someone who’s been through it and come out the other side.”
“It’s not,” Harry agreed, relieved. “Thank you.”
“You’d think you would watch your mouth with your arse at my mercy,” Harry mused with a lazy half-smile.
“He alright?” Dean asked Malfoy, “You need a hand?”
“Yes, of course. Just a silly nightmare.”
Halfway to the other boy, Harry hazarded a quick glance back at them. Draco's hand was on Clark's shoulder and the two seemed to be chatting. The heightened concern that had occupied Draco's features earlier had disippated into his usual unflappable conceit.  His gaze, however, hinted at a disguised tenderness that Harry suspected only he could recognise.
“Alright in there, Potter?” Draco called out.
“Which one?” Franklin Ojo demanded.
“Um, you go ahead, Al,” Scorpius said. “I’ll be there in a minute.”
Harry joined in with the others combatting the flames, stamping out a tunnel for him to race through.
Harry shrugged helplessly, the memories threatening to corrode the calloused layers of detachment which kept him sane and functional. He reached for his mug.
“Mr. Potter,” she exclaimed, opting for ignoring Draco, “Oh, dear, how lovely to see you.” To Harry’s embarrassment, the stout little witch stood up on her tiptoes to kiss his cheek. “We merchants are all so grateful for all you have done. You’ve saved our livelihoods, and for many of us, our lives.”
“Not great?” Ron gulped. “I guess that’s one way to put a purposeful injury used to manipulate you into caring for him.”
“What’s that?”
“Yes,” Drace whispered in exasperation. “Go!”
“It is a bit, isn’t it?” Fort replied, sounding pleased.
He hovered in the dark atrium of the tunnel for a suspended moment, when the astute, bright voice of Shanna sounded, “This first section of our seeker course measures your ability to keep a tight turning radius. Please follow the yellow line.”
“Yeah,” Harry said stupidly, knowing all the warmth and vulnerability and fondness he felt was undoubtedly radiating off him.
A collective gasp rose and whispers echoed the conversation down the long lines of the nearby tables, like a flame chasing spilled petrol.
“Kind thought it would be you two, honestly,” Seamus admitted, taking another sip of Dean’s tea and grimacing, “Always at each other’s throats. Figured all that intensity had to go somewhere.”
“Right then,” Draco said, checking his watch and gripping the handle of his and Harry’s trunk to ensure it made the journey also. “On three.”
“I see,” Granger said, stirring a bit of sugar into her tea.
Harry pondered the question. “Just...don’t keep things like that from me again, alright? You manipulated the crowd, but you manipulated me, too. I didn’t like it.”
“Yeah, but it makes
“Why should I?” challenged Malfoy.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes, what is it?” Draco replied, sleepy but obliging. Potter wasn’t always the best at asking for what he wanted.
“The bank,” Harry said, “I should get some spending money for Christmas gifts, and I’ll maybe get some more cab fare as well.”
“Another clever protection spell,” Ginny picked up the thread, as Harry cast a jelly legs jinx, “is—”
Merlin, this was positively painful. “I’m attracted to you, Potter, yes. And I know you’re magnificently straight, and I'm keenly aware that my behaviour towards you in the study was abhorrent for a number of reasons, and I assure you, it won’t be repeated.”
"Probably," Harry agreed, his lips brushing  against Draco's forehead.  He wanted to stop and dwell here, in this moment of levity, with Draco pressed close: warm and tangible. Their easy banter made it too easy to forget the sorrow seeping through him. He knew he had to press on, “And that day in the great entrance? When I kissed you?”
changed. But they don’t all get to have occlumency lessons or lunches or days watching quidditch with him. So we have to find other ways to convince them he’s trying.
Curious, Harry followed her through the doorway.
Clark made an unintelligible sound, since his lips were still spread wide, but he nodded encouragingly. Draco stepped in close, peering into the boy’s mouth from beside the healer’s shoulder.
Clark was standing on a fitting block wearing a wool-lined bomber jacket. Draco had approved the choice and was now poking around the little shop.
“It’s part of it,” he said, “Generally speaking, I don’t like being lied to, I doubt anyone does. But people have the right to keep things to themselves, I guess. Or at least I use that to justify my own behaviour. I wasn’t open with Ron when Draco and I got together. I didn’t tell Ron's family until Christmas.”
CWs: some sexual content (foreplay) prior to the first ***; violence (in a dream/memory), gore, nightmares, PTSD-like response, drug (potion) use and altered mental state, ableist language.
“A concoction that can be applied to the skin. It makes the wearer impermeable to spells and assault for a brief period of time.”
. Draco’s head fell back with a cry, neck exposed, pelvis rocking upwards.
“Hm,” Malfoy said, “Maybe a bit.” He bit his lip as Harry deepened the bend.
?) was not wrong.
gave you an opportunity to put down some unexpected roots in Harry’s life.”
For a moment, Harry felt as though the floor had been yanked out from under him, and he was in free fall. With a stifled gasp, his heart sputtered back into rhythm. He knew Draco was attracted to him, knew Draco fancied him, in that supercilious way of his, but he was rarely affectionate, not with words and certainly not with endearments, and Merlin’s teeth, but Harry
missing class, so Harry knew it had to be serious.
Harry’s heart sputtered as another thought came to him. “And...Merlin. The first day we kissed. I saw him being attacked by a group of students from across the great entrance. He wasn’t hurt, I got to him just in time. What if they were an illusion? What if he orchestrated all this just as he orchestrated the rescue on Valentine’s? I’d like to say I know he wouldn’t, but...I don’t know that. In fact, it is exactly the sort of thing he would do.”
“What I don’t want is to talk about it any more,” Harry growled.
“Yeah,” Harry said, trying to swallow down some of his self-reproach. “Thanks.”
“I don’t believe it,” Clark marveled, “Well, what did you find? The rhyme on the door said you would find something other than treasure? I thought they just meant death, but apparently not.”
Harry stared, “You’re not going to have to, er, whatsit, section me?”
“Exactly,” Al said with a firm nod.
“I didn’t find it on my own,” Harry offered, and to fill the time, he told Draco about Fred and George Weasley and the Marauders and the Map things he’d not thought about in ages. Draco seemed content to listen, occasionally slicing at overgrown roots that barred the tunnel. He was unusually quiet and Harry didn’t like it one bit.
kill you," Malfoy growled, irritated, "Prat is fine, it's...it's context dependent, alright? Infuriating bastard, just let me suck your cock some more, would you?"
PS. if you are a British English speaker and would like to be pestered with Brit picking questions from time to time, please let me know?? Google sometimes is so unsatisfying. (My discord is umbrellaless#0352)
“Yeah,” Harry decided, “interdependence. I like that. I want him involved in most parts of my life; that appeals to me. You’re not angry, about it being him? I’m scared to death to tell everyone.”
“Consider it done.”
Harry retorted before pulling himself back. Matching Draco's bad mood was hardly going to do either of them any good.
Harry gave a final squeeze to Draco’s desperate prick, then dropped it. Leaning in, Harry took Draco’s chin in one hand, forcing him to meet his gaze.
“I’m coming with you,” Hermione insisted, “I leave you two alone for one meal and your communication goes to the dogs.”
“Want to tell me what’s going on with you today, love?” Harry offered.
“Well, it is a little bit, though, isn’t it?” asked Claire, “It was fun to win.”
Draco scowled and tucked the parchment in his pocket. “I suppose she is more clueless than malicious, but I’m hardly pleased with her for doing the bare minimum.”
“Don’t mind Draco,” Harry explained, conspiratorially, “only child, never learned to share.”
But Clark refused to show his face.
“There must be some sort of cooperation when it comes to child welfare," Hermione mused, "He can’t be the first young person in this situation. Let me go ask the Weasleys.”
“Will you get an update on Hiram, please, too, Harry?” Clark requested, making an effort to sit up. Draco quickly kiboshed that idea with a firm hand to the boy’s chest and a gentle shove.
“Merlin, Rosie, you’re such a suck up,” Al rolled his eyes.
“That’s barbarism, Harry,” Clark urged. “It’s not right.”
***CW: brief description of childhood neglect, poverty
“Toffees from Honeydukes. Some almond, some plain, and some butter rum.”
Harry just nodded and was relieved to feel Draco kiss him, strong, unfaltering, and sure.
recently which leveled some rather dire accusations against my partner, Draco Malfoy.” Ilka had insisted on that term. She’d said ‘partner’ would hold more weight, especially with younger students, as it connoted a sort of permanence.  “In case you missed it,” Harry continued, “the gist was that, spurred on by his father, Lucius Malfoy, Draco had manipulated me in an attempt to seek freedom and redemption for his father, who currently is imprisoned in Azkaban on account of his support of Lord Voldemort during the war.”
Draco looked for a moment as though he might protest, but didn’t, allowing Harry to take the small boy in his arms.
Draco ended the pretense of keeping his distance, instead closing the gap between their bodies and pressing his chest against Potter’s back. The man shuddered as Draco kissed his neck and wrapped a steady arm around his middle. A moment later, Potter eased tentatively backwards into the embrace. Gingerly, Potter let his own arm rest atop Draco’s own. Then, in a gesture which seemed to require a desperate surge of courage, Potter impetuously grasped Draco’s hand.
Harry finished the last metacarpal and stood back to let the matron work through Draco’s wrist. She then showed him the ulna, the radius, the epicondyles and the humerus. And then they were done. Draco was healed.
“Yeah, I am. It was a bit not great, I know.”
“Hm?” Draco responded, schooling his features into neutral.
—and completely counter to his chilly personality.

"You really believe that?" Draco challenged. "That I could be those things you said?"
“Fucking hell, Harry,” he whispered with something that sounded like awe.
“Why aren’t we just using magic?” Clark demanded.
“But it didn’t feel like you were in a dream?”
“Wait, you’re in the DA?” He wondered allowed.
Malfoy was on his knees, face contorted but Harry couldn’t look at him, couldn’t focus on that, nor the whimpers of the children or the fact that poor Hiram was standing in a puddle of his own wee. Instead, he crept along the wall, keeping his eyes on the small, round-faced figure of Wilma Brown.
Malfoy whirled sharply, his expression a confusing blend of guilt and relief as he strode over to Harry’s side, eyes intent on...someone to Harry’s other side.
“Domineering little fuck,” Harry commented, pressing his lips against the back of Malfoy’s neck, then again under his ear.
“Keep your bubble heads on until we’re clear of the smoke,” Harry instructed. “But they come off with a
“I fell,” Malfoy replied daintily, “silly me.”
Draco turned slowly, fixing cold, despising eyes on her. “Look around you, Jones. You may have been on the right side of the war, but where are you now? Have you got any friends left, I wonder? Besides that Pushbottom beast over at
Harry was initially confused when he re-entered the living room. Draco was standing between Ron and Hermione. Draco seemed to be wearing Ron’s overlarge jumper, a golden R knitted proudly across his chest. His pale skinny legs and bare feet shone in the light from the tree and he was holding Hermione's mug of cocoa.
“Look,” Potter was behind him. Draco jumped, spinning in place. “Here’s how it is. Until two days ago it never crossed my mind that I might be into blokes, and I’m not saying I am for sure, but I can’t stop thinking about what it might be like to kiss you and I don’t fucking know what to do with that.”
“Oh, you know,” Draco made a vague gesture in the air. “You fall into most things, don’t you? Just bursting with talent. It used to make me mad with jealousy. The youngest Seeker in a century? I nearly bruised my arse, I spent so many hours flying the summer after first year, and where did it land me? Decent on a broom, at best. It was always that way with you. Duelling, Defence, sheer heroism. Everything came shockingly easy to you, it was infuriating.”
first thing tomorrow.
“Enough, son.” It was Arthur Weasley’s quiet, clear voice. He was watching them sadly from the foot of the stairs.
“Please,” was all he said.
“Manners, Draco,” He warned.
“Fuck,” Potter whispered, dropping his forehead upon Draco’s shoulder. “Bloody hell, Malfoy, what are we doing?”
"Why Harry, you sound just like Dean." Seamus laughed, winking at Draco, "Only kidding, Malfoy, no need for jealousy."
Draco only raised his eyebrows and took a sip of tea.
“Not the only one who can cast a superb disillusionment charm, Potter,” Draco pointed out.
“Don’t.” He shoved back his chair, stood, and fled.
The article went on, spinning more and more malicious plots, but none of them quoted Lucius and were outlandish bullocks, so Harry ignored them.
“Fat lot of snogging you did at sixteen. Too busy trying to murder our Headmaster and swimming in your own personal angst.”
Hermione and Harry swiveled to look at him, mouths gaped.
"Potter..." The word was an irritated warning that Harry thought it best to heed.
“Yeah?” Draco prodded, biting back a blossoming smile.
Malfoy’s eyes fluttered open, his mouth bright pink and his face flushed.
“Right. Okay. Well, er, sleep well?” Harry said at a loss for words. He’d only wanted to reassure his son, but it hadn’t worked and Harry didn’t know what other comfort to offer, and Jamie seemed no longer receptive. “Night, love,” he murmured helplessly.
was rather less evident. From where Harry stood, Malfoy’s life had looked clearly more desirable: parents, money, a firm sense of belonging and an ease with the magical world that had taken Harry years to cultivate.
Harry kind of wanted to give the boy a hug. He looked so lost and overwhelmed and terrified.
“Come along, Sparrow,” Draco insisted, giving Harry one final kiss, and tucking his shirt back in, “Those jumpers aren’t going to try on themselves.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry snorted at that, then shook his head. “I suppose it’s too much to ask that people just...get along?”
“Yes,” Harry said firmly. He hadn’t purposefully kept it from his friends, it just hadn’t exactly come up.
Harry grinned. “What was that for?”
“Yes,” Draco replied, steady and unabashed. “Is this the identity crisis you swore you’d not have?”
“Give him here, Harry,” Malfoy demanded, when he reached him, “You need to see to yourself.”
It was hardly a rigorous practice, but by the end everyone seemed happy enough, red-cheeked, and smiling—save for Slytherin Marcia Awling, who, it seemed, didn’t do happy. Harry was pleased, he figured after another practice they would be ready enough for a friendly game. He flew up beside Tiering as they made their way back to the quidditch shed, to transfer over gear to the next team.
“Of course, I don’t presume to have all the answers,” the professor continued, “and there also comes a time, as you know, when words and appeasement and patience feel inadequate.”
“It’s...frustrating. I want to be able to just do it for him but I can’t.”
The shop was dim and quiet, a fluttery sound like hundreds of pages being turned sounding as the trio entered. A brown-skinned one-eyed man greeted them with a grunt when they entered, but Clark was bursting with so much excitement he didn’t even acknowledge the attendant.
"Together," Harry repeated, stupidly,  "That you're my..." Merlin, sometimes he was so awkward he wanted to dissolve into nothingness.
“Suck,” he ordered.
So. Thanks! l just am feeling lucky to have you showing up and saying nice things.
“You’re not odd, Al,” Scorpius argued, reaching out to squeeze Al’s arm.
“Er, right,” Harry replied, not sure how he felt about being spoken to in such a way in his own damn home. Then again, he wasn’t serving beans on toast, and Jamie wasn’t whinging endlessly and
“And does it sound the same on both sides?”
“It’s alright,” Draco cut the boy off before he could dissolve into utter mortification. “You sort of are, in plenty of ways. His. And mine, too. Surely you know that.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I thought—I thought he was going to kill you,” Scorpius stuttered pitifully.
“Alright,” Potter conceded. “Well. Er. What now?”
“Oh please,” Draco remarked. “Any attorney would pay
Harry could hardly believe he was doing this. He climbed out of the awkward portal that was the entry to the eighth year common room and started begrudgingly down Hogwarts hallways towards the infirmary. It was early yet. According to the Marauders' Map, Malfoy was still there and Madam Pomfrey could probably be convinced to allow visitors. If Malfoy didn’t forbade his entry right from the start. Merlin, this was a terrible idea.
Draco looked slightly stricken, uncertain. He gave an imperceptible nod.
Potter finally un-burrowed himself from Draco’s neck, a shaky smile on his face. “Point taken.”
This time, when Harry took him in his arms, Draco allowed it.
“Perhaps,” Draco shrugged. “And perhaps that would have only served to push her further away.”
Harry went to the room he was sharing with Ron, George, and Percy and threw his few things into his duffel. He grabbed Constance’s cumbersome cage as well as his toothbrush from the bathroom, and headed for the stairs. Halfway down and he ran into George, who slammed him against the banister. He grabbed the neck of his jumper, and Harry expected a fist to connect with his head any moment.
“Nice names only. Except context dependent. Understood. Mostly. Thank you for telling me," Harry stood up again, feeling a bit awkward, but apparently it would take more than that to quell his raging fucking hard-on, "Well, get back to it."
“Leave off, would you? Repeating everything I say is hardly helpful.”
Jamie pinked at the jab and squared his shoulders. “Well, I’ll find everything, now that we’re here,” he assured his professor.
“Not a one.” Draco wriggled in Harry’s arms, turning over so they were slotted together, and allowed his hand to slide over Harry’s in the darkness, the pad of his thumb skating along the raised scar he’d seen in the dining room. “What’s this? I noticed it earlier, but it didn’t seem the right time to ask.”
“Fine,” was the only reply.
“Thank you for tea, Mother,” Draco said, rising abruptly, “I think Harry and I will be going now.”
Harry felt his panic morph into something more akin to despair.
“You’d better not,” Harry instructed, withdrawing completely. “I’d be severely disappointed.” He eased Draco’s leg off his shoulder and placed a kiss low on his belly. Harry rose and stood back to appreciate the rise and fall of Draco’s chest, the whipcord muscles in his outstretched arms. Harry reached forward to once again wrap his hand around Draco’s cock.
Harry felt that still tender part of his pride chafe with guilt. “In time,” he promised hollowly.
“I wanted to tell them all to fuck off,” Draco asserted, squeezing Harry’s shoulders before sliding his hands up his neck to his face. He stroked Harry’s cheeks with his thumbs, so sweetly, “Couldn’t they see what they were doing to you? Devouring you like a swarm of hungry jackels. You’re not
“Fucking hell,” Harry sighed.
“What’s it doing?” Malfoy demanded.
“Uh, Clark, a word?” Harry asked, not sure how much the boy had shared with Hiram.
Footsteps sounded on the floor behind them, and Draco turned. Harry stood in the doorway, looking exhausted but happy, with Jared holding him firmly by one hand and Mother beside the pair of them.
Before him arose a dark tunnel, about his height.
And so his mind went around and around in this manner, drifting from one devastating possible conclusion to the next, and, when he had been through them all, starting over again.
“Break Bone Bewitchment works directionally, from distal—that’s farthest away from the centre of the body—to proximal, making a neat fracture in every bone as it goes. Start with his littlest finger there, Harry. The tip of it, that’s called the distal phalanx. Hold it between your thumb and for forefinger and place your wand along his skin and send your magic out, it might help to close your eyes at the beginning. See if you can find the crease, it feels darker, out of place.”
Hermione’s words were a thunderclap of revelation. Vignettes played through Harry’s head. Putting on Draco’s socks and shoes, serving his meals, carrying his bag, fetching his things, making his tea. All the myriad little errands that Harry rolled his eyes over. He liked them. Because by doing them he was...
“I also wanted to say that I don’t think I want to try for seeker anymore,” Claire said, “not my strength.”
“I somehow doubt snitching will win me any popularity contests,” Malfoy replied, “ Now if you’re not going to help me, please shove off so the next lonely tosser can find me.”
“Well, so did she!” Clark mutters darkly.
Thanks for reading and double thanks for commenting!
Draco blinked, nonplussed. “Sorry? Like what?”
“Pst, Scor, hey, wake up,” Al hissed quietly, because Scorpius, like Dad, didn’t like to be startled when he was sleeping.
“If all this makes you at all uncomfortable, Clark, we won’t do it,” Harry assured him, “We’ll come up with something else, it’s not a problem, I mean that.”
"Benefit of dating a bloke known for his unwavering integrity," Draco drawled, "He'll never give me cause for concern on that front."
“Oh yes, love,” Harry assured him. “Should I give you a distraction? Would you like that? Something to focus on besides the pain?”
Draco swallowed again, nodded slowly, hand still wrapped in Harry’s, “Good,” he said.
Ron stared at her like she’d grown three heads.
“That’s because I’m not. Next year, when this has blown over, another team will snap you up and The Appleby Arrows will bemoan their stupidity for a decade. What's all this about, hm? You've hardly needed reassurance about quidditch in the past.”
Draco harrumphed and turned over, capturing Harry’s mouth to shut him up. Harry grinned into the kiss, before gently pulling away, a hand stealing up to curl around Draco’s cheek.
The door opened and Zerk came in. He was more casually dressed than usual, like the first night they met.
“Really? Because I love being kidnapped, and was hoping to make it an annual occurrence,”  Scorpius drawled.
“Just trying and failing to keep common tea thieves at bay,” Dean remarked, turning his face up for a kiss, which was granted.
? Scorpius had seen homages to the love story of Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley splashed across magazine covers for as long as he could remember. Surely Al would have said something if he suspected his dad also fancied blokes.
“What is it?” Harry prompted.
“It’s alright,” Draco soothed, pressing into the tense muscles at the base of Harry’s skull. “It’s hardly something you can help. And I don’t mind if you want to be terribly ordinary around me. Save for when you’re stringing me up with your magic and all that.”
“Oh,” she said, finally, looking up from where she had the back half of the magazine folded over the front, hiding the cover for Ron and Harry’s sakes. Her face was pink and her eyes a little dewy, “Oh, Harry, it’s really lovely.”
Harry snorted and yanked on the little bun gathered at Draco’s nape.
“Merlin, Malfoy,” Harry grumbled, although he couldn’t fault the other boy’s logic.
“I’m sorry it didn’t work,” Potter pressed on. “Not everyone was willing to be forgiving.”
“Sorry.” Harry couldn’t help but feel like he was bollocksing this all up. “I just realised I wasn’t totally sure. Gay, then? Just blokes?”
Draco grimaced. “You’ve been talking to your mind healer.”
“I’ll leave you two to talk,” the headmistress said, and suddenly Harry didn’t want her to go.
“I guess not.”
spread open on the table before him, and was feeding Remy a bottle. Scorpius had to admit that it was a bit strange to see his dad with a baby. He’d never given much thought to his own infancy, or what it had been like for Father to find himself a parent. He certainly looked at ease now, but surely he’d found Scorpius more cumbersome. His dad hadn’t grown up with younger siblings, or even cousins, so it wasn’t as though he’d had any practice before Scorpius had come along, but then again, he tended to be terribly good at everything—at least so far as Scorpius could tell.
“Tiering didn’t seem fussed,” Draco considered. “I didn’t notice any real change in him last week.”
“On the contrary,” Draco assured him. “You’re making perfect sense.”
“That’s the thing, I don’t think it would? I’ve thought about it and I don’t much care. I want to be with you, that’s the thing that matters. It’s just...other people
He should have known it had all been too easy.
“Do they all check out?”
“Hullo, Harry,” Dean said, “We’ve all just organised a little escort for you and Malfoy, just for the next few days, until things settle down.”
“Very well, that will do,” Draco said finally, stepping back. He motioned to the fireplace. “After you, Al, if you would?”
Harry looked to Malfoy for confirmation, but felt his heart stutter in place at what he saw. The careful, reserved tension usually apparent in Malfoy’s shoulders was curved into something more tender. There was a slight upward tug of his lips as he gazed at Remy, who had one hand curled round Malfoy’s littlest finger.
“For hell’s sake, Potter, stop staring,” Draco muttered, being suddenly and painfully reminded of his childhood house-elf. Dobby had treated Draco with more kindness than his parents ever had, and still Draco had scorned and mistreated him.
“Slow down you little slag,” Harry teased.
“‘Course not” Harry hurried to reassure him, propping himself up on his elbows so he could look Draco in the eyes. “It’s just an extension of a fantasy, yeah?”
The last few sentences had been all but meaningless to Harry, so he’d chanced a glance at Draco, who had been nodding seriously, in apparent agreement.
“Hey,” Harry echoed stupidly. His hands were wet so he shrugged his shoulders one at a time in an effort to wipe his face with his sleeves.
“Just popped back early. Nice speech, by the way.”
Harry glanced to Draco, you gave him a confirmatory nod. “Alright,” he began slowly, trying to figure out what might be useful. “As you know, when we couldn't find you, I was upset. Truthfully, I was more than upset; I was terrified. I was afraid I had lost you. And then, when we did find you, I was angry that you behaved so recklessly and kept secrets and went about it all so very poorly. It was thoughtless of you, and somewhat cruel. But I understand why you did it, and Merlin knows I’ve done similar. I get that it’s an adjustment to have people suddenly be arsed and suddenly care. But I do care, Clark,” he looked to Draco, “We both do. A great deal. So please just...remember that next time.”
Hermione eased his hands out of his pockets to hold them in her own, “I know, Harry, I’m sorry. I can’t imagine what it is like to be bursting in love and not allowed to show it. I know this hasn’t been easy on you.”
“It’s certainly not a solution,” Harry recognised, “but hopefully it’s bought us a bit of time.”
Al closed his lips and swallowed. “Sorry, Professor,” Al said automatically, wiping his mouth with his forearm.
Harry paused, biting back the 'of course' that manifested on the tip of his tongue. Three weeks ago, he might have wanted to believe that dream. Then, he would have taken Ginny back the moment she walked through the door with nothing but tearful apologies. Something had shifted recently, however, and Harry realised that that certainty had wavered.
“Then what
“Nice to know you care, though,” Draco commented, and Harry knew it was a tease, simply a tease, a way to break the tension, but he felt too scraped open for it, he couldn’t just take the wisecrack for what is was and all the sudden more words were spilling out all over again:
“Because of what happened tonight?”
Merlin, he hated how cynical and analytical he had to be.
at the ready should Clark take a spill. He'd enchanted some quaffles and bludgers to follow along behind him to the makeshift pitch, and they bobbed merrily in his wake. Thankfully, everyone arrived at the meeting place in one piece. Introductions were made and Harry explained his plans.
Sorry I missed a day! I was trying really hard not to! Also sorry if this has just so many mistakes, it is super late but I wanted to get it posted. I will give it an edit tomorrow!
The corner of Clark’s mouth twitched mischievously. "You okay?" he asked.
Atwal passed Clark the ball almost immediately, and, to Harry’s surprise, as well as to Clark’s, apparently, he caught it. He looked at the ball in his hands with disbelief.
“Are you sure?”
He collapsed into Harry, then, his face tucking under Harry’s chin, his fingers gripping a handful of Harry’s jumper. Harry let his arm fall across Draco’s shoulders, despite himself.
he told Draco.
The cover of

“I thought the magical world didn’t even have an aristocracy any more.”
“Tomorrow,” Harry conceded, “how’s that? Jamie might want to hear such things, too, and I wouldn’t want to leave him out.”
"What..." Harry started then stopped, and cleared his throat, "Did you mean what you said earlier? About your genes?"
“Employed.” Malfoy stated, grimly.
. He scrambled to a sitting position, clasping Harry’s hand in his lap, scrutinising it. The faded script below Harry’s knuckles was cramped and difficult to make out in the low light. The skin there was thickened with tiny lumps.
“You eavesdropped?” Harry countered.
Draco pressed a steadying hand to his back. “I know. But you
for the beta read and thoughtful input!
Harry didn’t know how to respond to that, Hermione’s voice sounding in his head about the wrongness of indentured servitude and it wasn't as though Harry disagreed with her, but it also wasn’t like he could just ask Kreacher to retire, either. He didn't think Kreacher would ever forgive him for that.
“Are you going to stop looking at me like that, now?” Draco whispered. “Like I’m yours?”
Harry paused, and eased his knee off Draco so he was straddling him. “Want what?”
He nodded to the Slytherin girl who gaped at him, looking ready to tell him all the reasons she shouldn’t be selected, not least of which was that time she’d been mind-controlled into cursing him with
“Merlin,” Harry said, “What a fucking mess.”
“I’ve got to run out and get another cot,” Harry admitted with a weary sigh. “I think it will just be easier than moving the one we have back and forth, and he’ll still need it for a while yet. So I might head out to see what I can find.”
“Well?” Januarius prompted. “Shove over, Jamie, and you two can fill me in on whatever you’re plotting.”
“I went flying,” Scor offered.
“I’m wild and untamed,” Pansy corrected, her dark eyes sparkling. “Now, tell me! Was Paulo everything you were hoping and more? Are you leaving the continent to wed?”
“Careful, Malfoy, he might rub off on you,” Ron ribbed.
“Well, I’ve got all afternoon. Come on.”
“I obviously don’t know her well either,” Harry said, “but she always struck me as a self-preservationist. Unless prison changed her, I doubt she’d do anything to upset any balance you would establish.”
“Nevermind,” Harry amended, feeling awash with guilt. He was trying to be better than this. “Forget I said anything, it was petty. She needs money to live on, I know that. It’s not like she cleared me out.”
“Please don’t tell Draco I said that,” Clark said, “He’s already mad at me.”
perform with that kind of carnival, I’m sure of it.”
Malfoy sidestepped Harry, turning towards the stove, the venison turning in the pan with a tap of his wand.
“Piss off.”
“Few hours,” Draco responded, voice thick and muffled, “Hit your head on the corner of the shed as you went down.”
“Come here, then,” he urged.
He wrote out. He realised the truth of the words like thunderclap. He was so fucking relieved Draco was there; that their home was where he’d gone to be safe. The thought of Draco leaving it, leaving him, made him dizzy with an untenable hurt. He kept writing.
“Don’t touch me,” Malfoy ordered. Harry dropped the other boy’s arm and held up his palms.
“Milk and sugar, please.”
*Update*: there are some small little slice-of-life snippets that come after this. They are not written in chronological order, but if you would like to read them in chronological order, this is it:
“Took you long enough,” Malfoy chided, the corners of his mouth twitching upwards.
Malfoy closed the door behind him with a soft snick of the latch.
“I know my talents, darling, as do you, I should think,” Draco sniffed, unapologetic. “Boys on their way?”
Harry stared at her, “Come again?”
Draco turned his attention to a brushed platinum cufflink, cursing Potter inwardly. What had he expected though, really? Potter was about as inconspicuous as a boulder on a railway track. “He shouldn’t have told you that,” he said finally. “It’s our business.”
“How long?”
Clark was blushing miserably and his voice sounded like he was close to tears again.
(See the end of the chapter for
The stag pranced off and Goyle whistled, “Not half bad, Potter. Never did manage a Patronus myself.”
“Like I tried to get out of his mind, but for a moment I couldn’t, he kept me there.”
Ignoring that particular ethical dilemma, at least temporarily, Clark excitedly pulled a dog-eared flyer out of his trunk. “Well, I’ve looked them over, but I really want your input, Harry. You went through trials. What are most people riding these days? What's all show and what's actually decent?”
Harry put a hand on his shoulder, “I wouldn’t worry,” he said, “I’ve cried in front of Draco loads of times, and we still get on.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Hermione and Ron looked nonplussed.

Harry exhaled. “Alright. Not hurt. That’s good. But you’re...upset?”
“I’m glad your parents are dead. This way, they didn’t have to live to see your disgusting betrayal!” wailed a witch near the front of the pack. She said it with such vitriol that spittle burst from her lips alongside her words. Harry almost flinched. He schooled his features into a neutral expression.
“And would you like it if it were done to you?” Clark demanded.
“Of course,” Harry agreed.
“Manners,” Harry insisted.
“The bulk of it, but not all of it. And of course I do. You think I enjoy getting myself in this sorry state?”
Jamie had never seen Scorpius so angry before.
“Look," Harry continued, attempting to persuade Clark, "it’s either us digging about in your head, and teaching you to stop it, or else it could be that woman in there again and you, helpless to do anything."
Draco gave a dismissive shake of his head.
Clark was stretched out on his belly, ankles crossed in the air, a massive tome resting on his pillow. One hand was under his chin and the other was knuckling Bird Hiram’s neck affectionately.
“You insufferable, infuriating, deplorable tease,” Harry hissed, grinding into Draco to make his point, “Do you have any idea what you do to me?”
Once the tea was steeped, Harry poured it. He splashed milk into all three cups and joined the other boys at the table. “Have I, now?”
Draco only waved a hand. “No one has to know, at least not right away. What with Floo and apparition, exposure is avoidable.”
“The M word?” Tanya said, giving him a strange, friendly sort of grimace, “We prefer the term ‘normal’ or ‘non-magical’”
Despite the strain on Malfoy’s muscles from his perilous position, he seemed to relax infinitesimally, as though relieved that Harry hadn’t mocked his desires. It would seem a cruel turn, Harry thought, to disparage secrets so rawly given. He kissed the underside of Malfoy’s jaw, and stepped back, admiring the view.
“Well, I won’t harp on it, but everyone’s a bit worried, as I’m sure you well know.”
“I didn’t make you, did I?” Harry responded, feeling a little bad.
“We were just about to crack into them,” Jamie explained. “Care to join?”
“Merlin, you’re charitable,” Draco said, finally putting his book down.
Well, the Potter boys were two reasonably intelligent children, so they ought to know these things for themselves. Albus announced he was in need of shoes that didn’t pinch, and so marched off towards the rear of the store, Scorpius at his heels.
“Shit,” Harry exclaimed, feeling flushed and very much wishing that they were somewhere private just now. “I mean, thank you?”
“What’s everyone else up to?” Hermione inquired.
“Not until we’re clear that you’re not to blame for earlier,” Harry insisted. His magic flared in gentle waves, settling over Draco’s back, securing him in place.
“Now is not the time for romance, man!” Draco's lone surviving knight shouted up at him.
“Clark’s called his dumb owl after me, Daddy,” Hiram whinged. “He thinks he’s awfully funny.”
“I might not know him, but I know what it’s like to be betrayed by someone you love,” Draco contended, quiet and sympathetic, “he needs a minute. Probably more.”
“Of course, when it is of social or economic benefit to them. Different people have varying tolerances for standing apart from the crowd. Shame can be a great evil or a powerful influencer, or both.”
“The thing I was teaching him. It’s a trick I learned when Mum left.”
“We’ll have to talk optics,” Hermione continued, “If Harry foots the bill it might look as though you’re taking advantage of him, Draco. Whereas if you pay, it might be interpreted as trying to buy him off. But if you split it...well, that doesn’t seem cohesive.”
“Obviously,” he spat.
“You absolute
Jamie made a disgusted noise.
“Draco…” he warned.
Hermione nodded, “Yeah, you might be right.”
“Draco, did you neglect to offer Constance your breakfast leavings?”
“And if magic were to disappear one day, you’d need to know how to manually clear a table,” Harry countered.
The kiss was a manic, uncontrolled thing, the first sip of water following an afternoon of flying. The moment when you realise you’re parched, actually, and a sip will never be enough.
“Just remember to change it back afterwards,” James had made him promise. “Otherwise none of us will have anything that fits, and Dad’ll stress about it.”
“I can’t help but notice you have a new companion. I’ve never seen a phoenix before. He’s striking.”
The spat left things a bit off between Harry and Draco. They didn’t say much to each other as they met up with Clark that evening. They’d relocated to a classroom away from the dungeons, since the smoke and debris still lingered there. Malfoy ran them through a meditation and then Harry cast the spell.
“You’re blitzed off your nut, sweetheart,” Draco informed him. “Come on, let’s get you cleaned up.”
“I’m very impressed with you now, if that helps.”
“You wouldn’t have. Not in front of your children.”
“Did it hurt? Did you feel dizzy at all, unwell?”
“He’s all of those things,” Harry agreed, “but unfortunately, he’s also been a bully, and he’s been cruel. People got hurt, people died. Not at his hands, maybe, but he was there, he didn’t stop it.”
“Mm, but you can’t now, can you?” Drawled Draco, “because you're dead.”
“Alright, Potter?” Draco murmured.
Draco shrugged, lifting his face to sip at the Firewhisky Seamus passed him.
The Lachesis was indeed a sailing vessel: a sleek navy blue ordeal with a stained ash deck, polished to perfection. Harry checked his watch. It was just three now.
“I think that’s an excellent idea, you two,” Harry said cheerily, “And hey, maybe we can rope Tiering in, and who's that other little Slytherin first year—Hiram! Those kids need friends, and this will make it easier for them. And I’m sure Draco here would love to help out. ”
“Wait, if Dad was its master, how did Voldemort get it in the first place?” was Al’s contribution.
“Really?” Said Clark.
“I don’t know,” was the hushed reply, “Probably if you tell me I won’t come at all otherwise, it’ll do the trick.”
“You know that’s all we care about, mate,” Ron said. “We like Malfoy alright. If you’re happy, we’re happy, you know that.”
“Uh, sorry,” Harry said, “did you want to look at the falcon quills?”
“Certainly not,” Draco replied, horrified. "What a perfectly daft idea."
A whistle sounded. The crowd disappeared. Shanna stood below him, motioning him to join her. He felt the snitch in his hand evaporate with a pop. He circled down towards the director, still smiling.
Draco stilled. He struggled giving praise; he’d far rather receive it. His mouth felt dry.
Draco’s face drew a shade paler.
he asked instead.
“I think it’s shit. I know fakes, blokes who treat someone nice because they want something—usually booze and a place to sleep. My mum’s had a whole line of them. Draco’s no fake.”
“I know,” Harry agreed, “you’ve got a right to be.”
“Would you like to take a breath, maybe?” Zerk asked.
They cycled through the list twice more. Harry watched raptly as Draco struggled through an intense jumble of emotions. At first defiant and irritated, then angry, Draco grunting and wriggling with every additional strike. His legs quivered both from the position and from restraint as he tried to keep himself from kicking out or fighting Harry off.
Draco was taking deep breaths, and Harry thought it might be veering towards too much. He stroked down Draco’s arm, over his flank.
Harry didn’t miss the edge in Draco’s tone.
The bathroom was suspiciously quiet. None of the sniffles or whimpers that Harry had heard in the past were echoing from the grimy stone walls.
“Er, I’m not sure I follow, entirely,” Jamie admitted.
“Oh,” Tiering cleared his throat, “Uh, alright then.”
“Well, she clearly was the caster,” McGonagall concluded, “or at least her wand was responsible.”
“The Dursleys never took me anywhere,” he shrugged. “They’d leave me with a neighbour if they went for holidays.”
“You look very fit all geared up,” Draco observed, “I rather like the idea of you in blue and black. How are you feeling?”
“Hey,” Harry corrected him firmly, “Don’t be so hard on yourself. It is totally normal to think about what you most
“Oh!” said the second Ravenclaw, obviously catching his less than favourable reaction, “We know that! It’s just, you're Harry Potter,” her voice lowered, “and he's a Death Eater.”
“I don’t know,” Harry groaned. “I want a day without being pestered about my fucking tragic past. I want it all to go away.”
was able to affect his son’s behaviour, as Harry’s own attempts fell pitifully short. It did, however, sting a bit that Malfoy knew Jamie well enough to do so. But why shouldn’t he? Malfoy spent more of the year with the boy than Harry did. As a child, Hogwarts had felt like the most natural place in the world to Harry; and yet, as a parent, he couldn’t help but resent it a little. He felt more distance grow between him and James with every passing term.
The morning was the typical chaos of caring for the baby and ensuring that Lily and Al got some breakfast. After that, Al returned to his room to sulk, presumably in hopes that his bad mood would return Scorpius to Eiderdown End more quickly. Harry set about dealing with the dishes and makin a grocery list.
“Pansy, you
Harry braved a wide, soaring loop, changing his perspective, keeping the other seeker in his periphery, looking for tells.
Harry reached out for his glasses and put them on, searching between the serious expressions of his friends.
“That way, I didn’t have to tell you,” Draco explained.
“For what?” Draco wondered. He knew his voice sounded plaintive and he hated that, but there was a bubbling worry inside him that he’d disobeyed somehow, that he’d let Harry down, and that was the last thing he wanted to do. He liked when he did this right: when he was attentive, and disciplined, and

Finally, she returned to the main room, posing for a moment in front of a full length mirror. “Merlin’s teeth, I am a divine creature!” she proclaimed. Pansy pulled an exorbitant aubergine housecoat off a hook and swirled it around herself,  motioning Draco towards the armchair that sat beside an ornate little coffee table.
“You haven’t,” Draco lied.
The two walked towards the great hall for some supper while Harry told Malfoy what Breety had said about Clark Tiering.
“Maybe fingers are enough,” Harry mused, cruelly, “I bet I could bring you off just like this.”
a fab teacher, Jamie,” Fort added. “Even I like him, and that’s rare as hens’ teeth. That obstacle course he made for us was nothing short of wicked. I might not be entirely dependent on Ri to pass a class for once!”
“Which school?” Draco demanded, fastening on to what was the least important part of Tanya's words, in Harry's view.
“Thank you,” Harry replied, “Truly.”
“Of course you don’t, this is on the publicity agents at Appleby headquarters, not me. I’m the pinnacle of decency, for once in my life.”
“Why should I mind?” Draco drawled. Potter shifted awkwardly. They both knew why.
“You’ll get in touch if they're not,” Draco decided, “Be sure to address any communication to me, not Harry, he never checks his post.”
“So if I go off the deep end…” he said, with a hint of levity.
“I can make my own decisions, you know. I don't just copy you! Besides, you’re not even going to be here next year, so you’re going to have to learn to trust me!” Clark reproached them. Harry could tell he was overtired from the whinging note in his voice.
“How come you never told me that?” Al asked Harry. “You only told me about his being a double agent and a hero and all that.”
“I think it is definitely worth asking,” Zerk amended.
“Leave off. I can do it,” he asserted.
“I died for you, Harry,” she said and while Harry still couldn’t see her materialising in the room, he could picture the pretty pout she’d thrown at Ron endless times during their brief relationship. “And not a quick death, either. A slow, drawn-out painful one. I was disemboweled.” She elongated the word meaningfully. “Do you have any idea what that feels like?”
The witch pursed her lips, “Difficult to say. The ones who aren't awake are at least breathing on their own, which is a good sign. Depends how long they were unconscious for, really. It’s the brain we worry about in situations like this.”
“What about loyalty, kindness, and affection?” Zerk asked, “Do you think those might be important to a boy whose father showed none?”
Oh Merlin, what was this utter codswallop, Harry wondered, miserably.
There was a pause before Draco responded and Harry could picture his contemplative pale face, deciding just how much he was going to let Harry in on. The full story would come out eventually, though, so Harry let the silence expand between them.
“Vates,” Draco repeated, slowing the syllables down. “They are seers of sorts, but far more rare, and they foretell futures more readily than they will converse over the breakfast table. When Scorpius first came into it, he spoke in nothing but riddles for days. I drove myself mad trying to divine it all.”
Harry sputtered adorably and Draco smirked, sweeping down the hallway in long strides. Behind him, Harry had to do an awkward little jog to catch up and Draco had to bite back a grin. He wasn’t quite sure how Harry managed to be so alluring and so endearing all at once; it was fascinating.
“I’m rather sure your little sister already maimed that part of him long before I came around,” Draco pointed out.
Everyone jumped to their feet, in uproarious applause.
“I do,” Hermione agreed, hugging him back. “And I’ll work on Ron. He’ll come round.”
“Oh,” Malfoy said, and Harry thought he’d punch him if the next words out of his mouth were an apology. “I see,” he said instead. “Well, it seems you have your hands full, perhaps we could arrange for Scorpius and Albus to visit another time.” Malfoy put an elegant hand on his son’s shoulder, turning towards the fireplace.
Scorpius felt a pang of envy. He understood why Harry had sidelined him, but the way the other Slytherins and Ravenclaws had raved about the adventure course the rest of the day left Scorpius with that unsettled ache of having missed out.
absorbs and disperses the energy of the spell. There reverse of
“I’m sorry, darling,” Mother said with genuine concern. “I certainly didn’t mean to upset him. I honestly believed he might be keen on the idea.”
Still unsettled with the ideas he was unbottling, Harry propped his feet up on the squat coffee table between them and sighed.  “It’s like this: When I was a kid, Molly Weasley read some nonsense piece in a magazine about Hermione jilting me in love or some rubbish and instead of just asking us about it, she was really rather horrid to Hermione. Jamie’s a bit like that now, too. He’ll spend days chewing on something I’ve done or some throwaway comment I’ve made, gathering self-righteous anger around him like a great billowing cloak, interpreting everything I do as a mark against me, and further evidence of injustice for him to hurl at me later. It’s about as charming as it sounds. You know what I mean?”
“I tried the spell Granger taught us,” the boy who must have been Marvin explained over Hiram's fretting, “The one that treats fiendfyre? And it worked a bit but I couldn't manage on my own.”
“Goblins?” Clark asked, sidetracked. Harry opened the door and they entered. “Oh. Goblins.”
The answer surprised Draco; he’d almost been expecting a lecture. Then again, he supposed it likely that Potter had grappled with moral complexities in the intervening decades. He was right, of course, but for one reckless moment, Draco wanted Potter to make the decision for him. He wanted Potter’s insight and his innate goodness in place of his own selfishness and bitter wrath.
“I don’t,” Harry agreed, “but I know you’re aching for me, and I like that very much.”
“You misunderstand me,” Malfoy continued.
“I’m glad you’re alright. I know I can be somewhat...reserved. All this doesn’t come as easily to me as it does to Harry. He cares for you a great deal, loves you really. And, well, so do I. Just so you’re aware.”
“What’s that dear?” Madam Malkin said, as Draco circled back holding two longer woolen coats.
"You sure? You're not too sore?" Harry murmured, peppering kisses across Draco's back and shoulder.
you doing?” Draco yawned, turning his head so he could be heard more clearly.
“Professor Malfoy knows about things,” Jamie told him. “It’s like he teaches all the time. Which I would think should be boring or infuriating, but it somehow isn’t. It’s like...he’s really hard to impress, but sometimes you get the answer right and he’s quite pleased with you, and that feels good, you know?”
. Harry swiveled, letting his lips meet Draco’s once, twice, “You are going to pay for this later,” he promised.
“There, that feels good, sweetheart, doesn’t it?”
“Well, if anyone gives you shit again, you can tell me, or Draco. We’ll sort it out.”
This was the first Harry had ever heard of Dudley loving a magic user.
“Yeah?” Clark sniffled.
hit his chest. Harry laughed good-naturedly as his wand flew out of his hand. Despite giggling madly from the tickling hex, Ron leaped forward, keeper’s reflexes well intact, to nab Harry’s wand before it clattered to the floor.
“Yes, love,” Harry said. “Even then.”
“I think you should just talk to him,” Ron said, “get some answers, sort this out. Whatever happens, we’re on your side, Harry. I want to believe the best, but if you were duped, I’ll make the fucker pay.”
“So bloody eager,” Harry noted, amused. “Well, if you must. Not like you can control yourself, can you?”
. Draco wanted to laugh. Potter really had no idea how expertly he’d taken Draco apart.
’ doesn’t work with you, Potter.”
Everything was dark and green and rushing when Jared awoke. He was frightened and someone was holding him. He was about to scream when they lurched forward into the drawing room of Number 12, Grimmauld Place. They had traveled by fire. Jared hated when they traveled by fire. The first time he’d cried for ages and Harry had said he’d not have to do it again.
McGonagall silenced the protests with a stern gaze, “I appreciate all of your efforts in this new, more inclusive direction.” She said, firmly, dismissing the students back to their conversations.
“Oh, he was just all worried that you don’t think he’s cool.”
Harry turned. “You had a nightmare,” he explained. “Screamed a bit and I think you spooked him. Are you alright now?” Harry again moved as if to cross the room. Scorpius flinched, and Harry froze, then stepped back. He didn't like the implications of that gesture.
CW: panic attack, flashbacks, PTSD-like response.
“Anyone related to anyone killed or hurt in the war,” Harry sighed, "It's not a short list. Do you think the physical attacks earlier in the year were part of this, Draco?”
Scorpius didn’t know what to say to that. He wasn’t used to people wanting to spend time with him—besides his father and Al, at least. Scorpius didn’t usually mind not having masses of friends. He knew he could be quiet, and he’d got on Al that first day and felt set after that. He’d thought that so long as he had
“It just used to make me so mad, growing up,” Ginny continued, when Harry didn’t say anything, “It was always “Ginevra, help your mother in the kitchen,” and then Hermione showed up, and Mum expected the same of her, and she was a guest! Oh, the boys had to help with cleaning up, but I can count the number of times I’ve seen Ron help cook on one hand. It was an unspoken rule, witches in the kitchen, wizards waiting to be served. I don’t want that for myself.”
Harry
“Master,” croaked Kreacher, giving a slow sort of bow, so far as his ancient body would let him.
For a moment, Draco didn’t respond and Harry wondered if he’d gone too far. He heard Draco take a ragged, uneasy breath.
,” Malfoy replied coldly. “Snape told me what he’d written in that damn book. He was able to close the wounds, but he couldn’t take the pain away, not entirely.”
Meekly, the little blond boy dug a satchel out from under the cot and walked to his father’s side. Malfoy’s hand shot out to wrap around the boy’s bicep, jerking him towards the door.
“No.”
Charlie laughed and took a sip of ale. “Well, what’s this game, then?” He asked George, who had recruited the lot of them to test out his most recent prototype.
“Professor Malfoy is a guest, Lils,” Al pointed out. “You’re supposed to be polite to guests and let them have your chair and such.”
especially if you like incredible creativity (a H/D plot like no other I have ever read, and I have read a LOT) and fascinating folklore.
“Understood,” Draco replied, as though Lily were being terribly reasonable. “And no offence taken. It is prudent to know one’s own priorities.”
Draco swallowed, thoughts pulled towards Potter’s broad shoulders, the solidity of his body against Draco’s. “Yeah,” he muttered gruffly.
Once they were seated, Draco flagged down a server, who brought Harry a pint and Draco some tea. He then motioned to the bar where a menu was painted on wooden slats and hurried off to greet some other patrons.
"And how well do you think my pointing a wand at you in the middle of Diagon Alley would have gone, exactly? People's memories are long around here, and I can't say that my wandless magic is as well-honed as your own."
“You’re forgiven,” Harry said magnanimously, kissing Draco on the mouth. He took his time with it, his tongue against Draco’s slow and indulgent and completely at odds with the frantic need Draco felt coming to a boil. He made a little noise of exasperation. Harry pulled back, looking irritatingly smug. “What’s wrong, babe?”
It wasn’t often Harry got to catch Draco off guard. He found he rather liked it. He crossed the bedroom in two determined strides, hand circling around the back of Draco’s neck and pulling him in for a hungry kiss.
” asked Clark, incredulously.
“Oh, Merlin!” Potter sprang over to check on the boy before Draco could do the same. Potter had a hand on Scorpius’ shoulder, shaking him gently as he crouched and said the boy’s name.
“Young Master Clark has already eaten, and read his strange newspaper over tea,” Kreacher informed him, "cursed muggle thing. The pictures don't move at all."
“I’m just thinking it must be quite the challenge to be as remarkable as you are, Harry.”
“Your brother’s just had a nightmare, love,” Harry told the boy. “He needed a little reminder that everything's alright.”
“Let us through, please,” asserted Dean, standing tall alongside Seamus. The crowd didn’t move, instead pressing forward.
“'Course. Poached eggs with rye.”
Harry grimaced, “Is it too much, do you think? Merlin, I never know with all this. Maybe I am just pure, exorbitant ego.”
“Malfoy’s just being lewd, he thinks he’s clever,” Harry explained.
Jamie held up his hand in evidence. Sure enough, there were little inflamed indentations across his knuckles. Harry made a sympathetic tutting noise, but Jamie was clearly more proud than upset.
leave your Slytherin buddy behind.”
“Happy Christmas, Draco,” she said.
“Not sure I could ever get my fill of you,” he observed as he felt Draco’s body respond. He pushed his leg in closer.
“It comes out in bursts,” Lavender replied haughtily.
Harry licked his lips. “Sorry, I’m not sure if I’m making sense.”
“I am a bit, though,” Harry retorted, uncomfortably, “Crisis seems to have passed.”
There was a shift in tone, to something softer, more vulnerable.
between you. Or is it not like that any more?”
Harry thought about it. “Well,” he said, “no. But—”
Harry was about to offer some bolstering words when Draco stepped forward with a broad sweep of his cloak.
“What do you hope to do when you leave here?” Harry inquired, genuinely curious.
“There’s nothing wrong with Scorpius,” Al insisted. “He’s not delicate like everyone thinks.”
“Still ten reps to go,” Harry insisted.
"Pansy is fine. Unfortunately, earlier today she found Greg wandering the hallways and he was rather beside himself. He said there was a woman in his head trying to convince him to leap off some the spectator stands at the quidditch pitch.”
Constance hooted mournfully as Harry passed by, pausing to pat her massive, fluffy head.
“Surely you know there is not. And yet, I still seek it.” She waved a fluid arm towards the desk and the parchment thereupon.
“Oh! Yeah of course! Well, that’s great, then. They’re nice kids, if I remember correctly. Well, nicer than mine,” Harry groused. “Not that that is difficult.”
“Gibbens,” he called out after her, “Have you seen Clark?”
"Well, what do I tell him then?"
“Dire need to know the time?” Ron questioned, “You got something planned?”
Ron inhaled and then sighed, heavily, “Harry, mate, about what I said…”
“Not tonight, Al,” Potter interjected. “It’s past your bedtime. Teeth, alright? And then bed.”
It was a lie. Draco wanted exactly that.
“James told us you fell asleep; that is hardly your fault, my love. I’m not angry with you, only with myself. I ought not to have been so preoccupied. As for your returning to Hogwarts, I don’t see an alternative,” Father sighed. “You may resume your studies—with some caveats. Where is your pocket watch?”
disillusionment spell?” demanded Draco.
Harry returned to the kitchen. “Are you literally always tidying?” he teased, surveying the neatened room.
“The optics are poor, me living alone here, like Clark pointed out: all this space, the antiques, the artefacts. There’s been some talk, well, more than talk, really, we’ve taken steps—with your permission of course, Draco, darling, since the property naturally falls to you—but we’d like to turn the place into a memorial museum. For a fee, people could come explore the house and grounds. Proceeds not going to upkeep would then go to the foundation. The family quarters would be closed to the public, mind you, and nothing is set in stone, but I’d like to hear what you think. I would set up parcels of land for you and Harry and the boys to hold in trust, it goes without saying. I want you each to have a bit of a nest egg.”
“Of fucking course,” Potter cursed, pulling away.
“Hey!”
Harry couldn’t think of words to respond, so he pressed a kiss to the corner of Draco’s mouth, sliding his forehead against the other boy's temple.
“Which one?” Draco replied crisply.
Molly beamed at him. “You’ll be alright, Harry, love. This was a good move for you, I can tell. You look so much better already.”
“We started with just a few steps,” Harry protested. “No one was leaping off the
.” The box shone purple for a brief moment, the seal between the two halves disappearing entirely. “Should misfortune come to your belongings, the Appleby Arrows takes responsibility for the replacement or recuperation of said items,” she explained.
“I have, yeah,” Harry said.
“Yeah,” Clark agreed, “pretty sure he’d do any damn thing you wanted.”
“Yeah,” Clark said. “I think so. I’ll, er, thanks. I’ll get to bed.”
It didn’t take long for the first ax to fall. Claire Gibbens descended on Harry at dinner that evening with her usual posse.
Harry’s attempts at potion-making were obviously straining the bounds of Malfoy’s commitment to their agreement. Harry could almost hear Malfoy’s molars grinding, in between barked orders and various corrections, “Clockwise, Potter, for Merlin’s sake, are you completely illiterate?” and “Sweet grass seeds are not the same as buffalo grass seeds, honestly!”
"And you
Clark pointed to the handle coming from the roof. “My mom sometimes holds that,” he offered helpfully.
“Is there anyone you wouldn’t say that about?” Draco argued, “Your penchant for forgiveness is the most treacherous of habits.”
Harry shook his head, affection welling in him for the great bossy housecat of a boy, “Oh am I?”
“I’m fine,” Clark muttered.
Mrs. Weasley seemed to make up her mind about something, and all of the sudden was stepping in with her arms outstretched. Harry was half-afraid Malfoy would do something terrible like recoil, but Draco simply returned the embrace, only a little stiffly.
A wave of well deserved chagrin washed over Jamie. He found he didn’t at all like upsetting Scorpius, who was usually so mild and sweet. “It’s not about you, Scor,” he explained ruefully. “That’s just how Al and I get. We don’t mean anything by it.” He gave Scorpius a gentle, companionable nudge. “Why’s it matter so much?”
“I don’t want to talk,” Draco’s voice sounded hoarse and hollow. “Because once I talk, you’ll know, and once you know, you’ll leave.”
Scorpius always tried to be obliging, but he couldn’t help but feel a bit of a sting at this. Surely Harry didn’t really need a student just to keep time. Had Scorpius’ fear been that evident? How embarrassing.
“If you like, Harry,” Hermione smiled. “And it’s pretty simple. The ward is just set for the airspace near Hogwarts. When you’re not at Hogwarts, you’re easy enough to find, especially if an owl knows you. Most people who don’t know you send their owls to Hogwarts, and those owls get redirected to your post-box in Hogsmeade.”
. I really am quite a cad, you know.”
The threat to Scorpius’ safety was a blow and Draco had to hold back from flinching. “Merlin’s tits, Weasley, this obsessive grudge is pathetic. I’ve apologised. I’ve admitted my wrong-doings. I’m contributing to society. I teach your daughter, for Merlin’s sake. I can’t imagine what it is you want, truly.”
“I did not—” Malfoy choked, but the creeping flush high on his cheeks gave him away.
there. And you sorted out the full moon business, and Granger and Weasley and the rest took that and ran with it, and now there’s a very solid plan in place. We’re not going to lose anyone today. Least of all, Clark.”
“Where are you two headed anyway?” Jamie asked.
“Ginny, dear, come help me with the punch,” Mrs. Weasley said.
Merlin, would it never end? Remy’s cries grew more pressing. He would need feeding soon, and then burping and changing. They had to at least attempt to get back in time for Remy’s afternoon nap, but the rest of the kids would be hungry before then, so they’d have to splurge for a lunch out, and James needed new clothes, and Al would refuse to wear Jamie’s cast-offs, and the owls would inevitably need more treats. The chores felt endless, and attempting to complete them all that while being stopped every thirty seconds to be gawked at felt less than ideal.
It seemed to be the wrong thing to say, because Father only looked more distraught.
Dudley held up both palms. “I had no idea she was going to say that. I understand that you’re angry and you’ve every right to be. She means well, but that stuff is Harry’s to carry, and mine—”
“Thanks, love, I’ll be sure to make a note of that,” Harry replied, dryly.
“I’ll need to speak with him some more,” Draco insisted. “And I must know if he's collected any prophecies. If he has, they ought to be destroyed.
“Corrupted me?” Draco laughed, kissing Harry again, licking his way between his lips, filthy and demanding. “He saved me.”
Suddenly, Harry realised how close they were standing. Draco didn’t back off, and instead appraised him in that cool, detached way of his that always made Harry feel like he’d forgotten to put on trousers.
Harry gave his godson a wink in an effort to disguise the tender feelings coursing through him. He took the porkchops off the stove. They didn’t smell half bad, really.
“Alright,” Harry replied easily, reaching out to cradle Draco’s cheek. Draco refused to let himself lean into the touch. “We can do that. What would work?”
“I’d like to hold you,” Harry said quietly. “Would that be alright?”
“My point is that Harry wants to protect you, because that is what Harry does,” Harry opened his mouth to object, but Hermione cut him off. “Don’t argue, Harry, you know it’s the truth.” Her gaze returned to Malfoy’s, “It’s going to become a lot harder for Harry to look out for you if this goes public. There will be allegations of coercion, manipulation,
“Hm?” Draco asked absently, petting Crookshanks who had slipped inside the canopy a few minutes prior and was currently settled beside Draco’s attentive fingers.
Albus screwed up his mouth and uttered an apology: “Sorry, Professor. And sorry, Rosie. I know you can be clever enough. I didn’t mean it.”
“Yeah, as many eighth years as we have potions for,” Dean replied, “we’re not allowed on the quidditch teams so we might as well have some fun!”
“Can we get a butterbeer before we go home, Dad, please?” It was rare for Scorpius to ask for treats, but Draco supposed his son wanted to impress the Potter boys.
Lavender gave a tiny nod, and then Harry found himself once more in the bathroom. Draco was at his side and before him stood Lavender: still here, but changed. She was the shimmering silver-grey of a ghost, devoid of all that blossoming red blood. She was crying still, but also smiling. She reached out for Harry, but her hands went through his and she gave a startled little laugh.
“Everyone’s fed and clothed and has all their limbs, Potter,” Draco reminded him. “You’re getting by.”
“Hm,” Draco agreed, as if he were incapable of selecting any item that would be less than ideal. Without warning, Draco leant in, close enough to make Harry’s breath hitch. He then grinned like he knew just the effect he’d had, pulled something down from a hook, and stepped back. He smacked the item against Harry’s chest. “You’ll need this.”
“I’m a bloody catastrophe.” Malfoy spat bitterly.
“Not Lavender, exactly,” Ron shrugged, “but maybe some sort of corrupted echo of her. Maybe she can enter students' heads at any time, but she can really only channel magic when she’s at her most powerful, around the full moon.”
Remy gave a mucousy little snort from his crib and Harry startled backwards.
“Oh?” he managed, aiming for nonchalant.
"Some new world order you're ushering in," Draco sniffed, unimpressed, then scrunched his delicate features in distaste. “There are some smells I just could have lived my whole life without smelling, Potter, and this undulating milieu of the unwashed was high on that list.”
“Was it your fault?” Scorpius whispered.
Scorpius only managed to get down one slice of toast before dozing off again at the table, his cheek in his hand. He really must be exhausted, Draco mused, as usually the boy would never prop an elbow up on the dinner table.
“Of course not,” Draco replied haughtily, “I don’t leave my homework for the weekend before it’s due.”
“Very well,” Narcissa agreed. She took a sip of tea. “This war made many things apparent. I was a young woman when I married your father. I had a sheltered life. I believed what my parents believed and then what my husband believed after that. That is not an excuse, however, and I also must take responsibility for my own actions. I had ample opportunity to leave and plenty of exposure to other less hateful ideas. I opted to ignore them. In truth, I suspect I liked feeling special. I liked the privilege and status afforded to me as a pureblood, and as a Malfoy. I liked my creature comforts, the pedigree, and being able to raise you in wealth. I was willing to turn a blind eye to ensure those things continued.
“I’m not!” Jamie protested, bringing Harry back to the present moment, far from the oppressive terror of the war.
“And how do you propose that?” Draco asked, sounding incredibly tired.
“No,” Harry replied bleakly, offering no further information, “she doesn’t.”
“Cheers,” he muttered.
, and I will be by shortly with a sea mussel soup for you both. We suggest a pairing of the 1989
“If I did something to upset you, yes, of course I’d want to know.”
Ron snorted, “Harry, stay pleasant and calm where Malfoy is concerned? Fat bloody chance.”
“Don’t apologise, answer the question,” Draco insisted.
“Yes,” Draco breathed.
“Come here,” he instructed. Clark rose, shoulders squared and defiant, glaring up at Draco, as if in challenge. Draco gave the boy a little half-smile, and put a hand on his shoulder, coaxing him forward. Clark’s resolve went to pieces and fell against Draco with a quiet little half sob, like he’d been waiting for comfort he wasn’t sure he’d ever receive.
“What is this nonsense,” Fife hissed, his feline eyes looking down his nose at Scorpius . “Malfoy, bring your rabid pet to heel or the Professor will be hearing about this. How am I expected to concentrate with Potter’s love notes whizzing about?”
! Oh, she was ever so proud.”
“Mm, I’m sure you do,” Harry placidly acknowledged. “But I’m also sure this isn’t at all about what you want.”
Instead, he said nothing at all.
“Besides,” Harry added, “you might want your own memories back one day.”
“I guess I could give it a try,” the kid was aiming for nonchalance, but it sounded more like disguised panic. Merlin, Draco could play people. Harry wasn’t sure if he should be concerned or impressed.
Draco’s eyes snapped open. “Please may I suck your cock?” he whispered, voice husky, gaze fixated on what he wanted.
“Well, lovely job, the both of you, then,” she conceded, hugging Hermione next, “and so good to see you, dear.”
“I know it’s not ideal,” his father acknowledged gently. He looked pained, and Scorpius hated that.
“Have you even tried?”
“No!” Clark growled. “Jesus, no, nothing like that. I just...I get stressed, I guess. That’s when it happens.”
“There, Rosie darling, all better?” she asked, forcing some sweetness into her voice. Rose shot a worried look towards her father. “He’ll be fine,” Hermione promised.
“Molly,” he coaxed, “we’re alright. We’re going to be alright. And Ginny, well, I don't know the full story, but she must have been in a bad way to have taken such drastic action. I can't know what's going on with her."
“It’s alright, love, I’ve got you. Does it hurt anywhere else?”
“Oh, come off it,” Harry chided, good naturedly, “I don’t think you actually mind teaching half as much as you whinge about it.”
“Dull.”
“There is no dealing with that blasted portrait,” Harry explained, “We’ve tried every possible spell. It’s immune to fire, to ice, to sharp objects.”
“You just have to focus on the memory or the current moment really hard, but at the same time, you have to imagine it being pruned away like a bit of dead tree, yeah?” Scorpius illustrated. Albus’ enthusiasm was obviously catching, because Scorpius was equally eager, as though he were telling Draco about his favourite novel or a classmate’s misbehaviour which would be detailed over tea in a scandalised whisper.
“There’s a lot to think about,” Draco responded. He ached a bit, wishing there was more he could offer than the admittance that the world was horribly complicated. Would it be easier, he wondered, to parent a child with a tendency towards blind faith, like he'd had at at the age? He oddly missed the bright, clear, certainty of his younger self, who never thought to doubt until it was entirely too late. It had been a crystalline confidence that he would never have again. He stood, crossed the floor and put his hand on Clark’s shoulder. “You’re terribly clever, love. It can be a burden at times, to have such insight into the way things work. I would have preferred to shield you from all that for longer.”
“You’re right,” Harry said simply. “You didn’t deserve this. You didn’t deserve to die for a cause. You had so much life and it was taken from you, and in part that was because of me, and I’m sorry. I’m so very sorry. It isn’t just, and it isn’t alright, and there’s no explaining why it had to be you and not someone else, or no one at all. You’ve a right to be angry.”
“Eloquent,” Draco quipped, using sarcasm as an easy defense to re-establish their standard footing: chiding Potter and extracting the expected counterattack.
“I need to study,” Draco replied.
“I had myself just as convinced,” Harry explained. “But since coming back from Molly’s... Well. Jamie’s been struggling.”
“It sounds like you have some good friends,” Zerk observed and Harry looked up.
“They hid everything from me, about my past, about who I am. They treated me like a house elf or worse, locked me up, starved me, never even called me by my name.”
Draco blinked, “It’s a cat,” he told her, like maybe she didn’t know. He went to shove the aforementioned cat off the map but Hermione let out a pitiful little yelp.
Draco and Clark and Mum appeared beside them, then, and while Not-Gran went over to greet them—hugging Draco and Clark, and shaking Mum’s hand—Jared hid his face in Harry’s neck.
“Thank you,” Harry said, kissing him properly. Draco leant into the touch, the now-familiar—yet curiously still novel—taste of Harry’s mouth. It was over far too soon. “Merlin, I’ve missed you.”
McGonagall’s mouth pursed for what must have been the third or fourth time already this meeting.
“There,” Harry announced, all but throwing his quill down one torturous hour later, “done. Perhaps we can have that conversation now?”
Jared was curious enough to peel his face away from Harry’s cosy jumper. “What do you mean?” he demanded of his brother, but Clark only sighed.
suggested the voice in his head,
“I mean it’s okay if it’s not, we can, like, talk about it—”
Harry sighed then stepped in and pressed a kiss to the red blush of anger forming on Draco’s cheekbone. “I’m sorry, sweetheart,” he said. “It was wrong of me to jump to that. And,” he said, turning to Clark, “I’m sorry for scaring you, too. Understand that Draco and I are going to fight, though, that’s just how these things go. But when we do, it's just between him and I, and has nothing to do with you, or what we’ve promised you, got it?”
“Scor here was at ours a lot this summer; he’s a good friend of Al’s,” Jamie explained.
“Will I?” Draco questioned, a bare breath away from Harry’s mouth. “Let me assure you that nothing you can say or do will alter my actions.”
Al gave an exasperated huff, but finally agreed. “I will if Jamie will.”

“There you go, taking his side again!” the teenager exploded.
Draco sputtered desperately, coughing as Harry withdrew, crouching back on his heels.
“What? Draco’s what’s—”
Pansy was right, her words rankled. “Just because you don’t understand what I do doesn’t mean you need to ascribe fantastical meaning to it,” Draco refuted.
“Oh, we’ve loads!” Exclaimed Longbottom, “It being a sentinel plant, Professor Sprout and I harvested an abundant crop of it last year, thought it might come in handy in the war effort. It’s used in all sorts of protective potions.”
Draco didn’t say anything. He replayed the last conversation he’d had with Pansy, trying to determine if there was any vague allusion he could make to Potter without her simply connecting the dots. She knew Potter was the father of one of Scorpius’ mates. She knew Potter had been doing poorly, and she knew Draco had seen the man recently. He poured them both some tea, still not knowing how to answer the question still suspended between them.
Clark’s face was determined and grave, and it made Draco want to wrap him up and take him home and keep him safe and protected forever, but even as he thought it, he knew such treatment would only be a cruelty for a boy as bright and independent as the one before him.
Malfoy’s gentle mockery continued throughout the meal preparation, but Harry found he didn’t much mind. It was a bit ludicrous that at 38 Harry still wasn’t entirely comfortable in his own kitchen. Having Malfoy there helped distract him from that anxious knot of hypervigilance that occupied the hollow of Harry’s spine whenever he worked in the kitchen, as though Vernon’s palm were to connect with his skull at any moment, or Petunia’s criticisms were to start up in earnest.
“The way you indulge that elf,” Malfoy shook his head, squeezing Harry's hand and glancing down to where their palms met around the key. His expression changed to one Harry couldn't quite interpret. "Potter, your watch."
Draco shook in place, “I...I don’t know, I’m sorry. Merlin, Harry, my legs.”
mags.”
“Too much?” He asked at one point.
“Apparently not,” Draco remarked dryly, wondering what on earth Potter should have mentioned about laundry, of all things.
“I don't know, Harry, figure it out,” Hermione snapped, her patience for this issue obviously at an end, “I’m tired of secrets and I’m tired of lies. The longer this goes on, the more hurt he’ll be when he finds out you kept it from him. And he'll be even more hurt if he finds I've kept it from him, too. He is trying extremely hard, Harry, despite his not insignificant grief, to give Draco a chance. You're his best friend; the least you can do is to give him a chance, as well.”
That got Ron’s attention. His head snapped up, as though Draco was being facetious, but stopped short at the sincerity present in every aspect of Draco’s expression.
Harry heard himself chuckle, “Better luck next time, Malfoy!” before sprinting down the steps to congratulate his team.
“Mm?”
“This weekend?” Harry asked.
“No one can keep up with Fitz,” Harry, “he’s like our very own whomping willow. Just play your best and don’t worry about that.”
Draco crossed his legs and continued. He tried to be objective in his telling, to suppress the anger and frustration that he knew came across less than admirable. “Astoria’s anxiety grew. To cope, she turned to potions promising euphoria. It was her life, I told myself. That was the agreement, it was hardly my business. So long as I didn’t feel it was affecting her ability to care for my son, I stayed out of it. In retrospect, this was likely the wrong decision. Had I reached out, had we forged more of a connection, even one of friendship, it might have helped—or it might have hurt. Astoria is a very proud woman. She never took kindly to being told what to do, and any comments on my part were met with derision and scorn.
you going to talk about it?" Zerk asked.
“Oi, Jamie!” Fort called out, launching a grape over Ri’s head into Jamie’s temple. It didn’t hurt, but Jamie rubbed the spot all the same and glowered at her.
“Um,” Harry started, still not quite able to comprehend all that had just happened. “I’m afraid I didn’t.”
“Yeah,” Harry replied, adrenaline finally ebbing and something that felt a bit like shame taking its place, “sorry, I don’t know what that was, it just doused me in worry. All I could think was that I had to find you.”
“The washing...machine?” Draco echoed carefully.
Harry laughed, “Hardly. I thought he was a conceited arse with a face like a weasel.”
“Hm,” was Malfoy’s non-response, his face drawn and focused as Harry deepened the bend, keeping his eyes on Malfoy’s face for signs of pain. To Harry’s frustration, however, the other boy’s features remained disciplined and stoic, impossible to read.
George cackled while Ron muttered, “Harry, then, since he’s the only one here not a blood relative. Though I suspect laying one on him might get me killed.”
The oxygen in the room seemed to disappear entirely. Harry was pinned in place beneath that determined stare. Draco spoke the truth, it was unmistakable.

“Yes, well, you have your good points. Even when you’re bickering.”
“Look,” Harry started,  “I...I didn’t like seeing you like that this morning.”
“What the fuck—”
“What I can’t make out,” she considered, “is the variety. At first it was Draco specific, with the Lum girl, then just a random message with Tiering, then back to Draco, and then trying to manipulate Goyle so cruelly. It’s so sporadic.”
“I don’t want to lose you,” Harry admitted.
“What do you think Draco sees in you?”
“I’ll extract you before you get beyond the superficial,” she assured him with a dry smile.
Clark threw his arms around Draco’s waist, pressing his face into his chest.
. There were no teasers of recipes or 'Spring Hair Solutions' marking up the margins. The title was simply printed across the top in a classic, sans serif font. At the bottom were a few more words, in a flowing, delicate script:
“Huh," Harry remarked, more to himself than to anybody, "No rant about unnatural behaviour? That's...unexpected."

Harry felt the body bind end and sprung up into the air to tag Ernie who dropped the stick as his limbs locked up. Harry grabbed the stick from the grass next to the Hufflepuff, and bounded it back towards their own goals, where Neville was bouncing around aimlessly.
“You’re not wearing your—”
Scorpius pulled away, looking up at him, brows knitting together seriously. “But you said when you got home from Brazil, I could maybe ask him here for a visit.”

Harry laughed, “All about the status with you.”
“I’ve taught at that school for nearly a decade, Potter, yes. No one gossips more than school children with no source of outside entertainment!”
“Yeah, well, I think she handles it better than me. She says I get mopey but it’s in her name to bear up,” Jamie explained with a little smile, as if he was picturing his friend just then.
Draco didn’t know what he had been expecting, but it certainly wasn’t that. There had been a bitter edge to the last sentence that Draco didn’t like. It planted a seed of apprehension just below his sternum. “Umbridge?” he repeated. “That awful Defence woman?”
“Useless,” Draco declared.
“And we’re off!” Cried Ron, excitedly, “The quaffle has been seised by McCracken—”
“You’re fucking brilliant,” he muttered, between frantic, ravenous kisses.
“What is it?” Al hissed.
“Where’s your winter cloak?” Harry demanded.
“You must be Hermione’s parents,” he said, “I’m afraid we didn’t get properly introduced the other night. My apologies for my poorly timed, and even more poorly appareled, appearance,” He indulged in a self-deprecating smile, “Pleasure to meet you both. I’m Harry’s boyfriend, obviously. Draco.”
“I presumed.”
“Happy Christmas,” Harry said to Clark’s mum, and then they left, footfalls creaking against the old floors.
“Superb,” Ilka said. “Now, let’s start scheming.”
“Draco, wait—” Harry cried out, disappointment and frustration clanging noisily in his head. He clutched at Draco’s sleeve to keep him from leaving. “Ron’s...being an arse.”
“I’m sorry, Al, but the baby needs to sleep, or he’ll keep us all up!”
“I’m aware.”
Harry sighed deeply, not sure he was feeling any better. He was pretty sure giving everyone a seat at the table was what Clark would refer to as bootlicking.
The dark haired lady led Mum into another room.
“Not a compliment,” Clark assured him.
“Al…” Harry croaked, still sending desperate signals with his eyes for Draco to undig this particular hole.
“Didn’t feel that way to me when I was fucking choking to death!” The redhead snarled.
Harry ran a fingertip along the border of Draco’s hole, “Is it sensitive?”
“How do you handle the…” Harry trailed off, scrubbing a hand over his face, then letting it fall to his chest, where that
“This was not how I wanted our first night to go. Or our first morning,” Harry grumbled. He felt the loss more acutely than he wanted.
They lay together for another long moment, just drifting. They would have to get up soon, have to see to the shopping and then head back to the chaos of Eiderdown End, and prepare for the start of term, but for now...surely they had five more minutes.
“That’s not a bad way of describing it,” Harry agreed, “My dad, Lupin, Sirius Black, and Peter Pettigrew made it back when they were in school.”
“No,” Harry agreed, “I mean, I know that it is a thing blokes do, well and other people, too, and they probably wouldn’t do it if they didn’t like it.”
Draco nodded again, “Thanks.”
“We’ll never get anywhere with all your myriad admirers,” Malfoy informed him, briskly. “This will make anyone who approaches you suddenly remember a terribly important errand they have elsewhere, unless you engage with them first.”
“What is The Three Quays?” Harry repeated.
Draco rolled over onto his side, staring at the plain, coarse wall of the cottage. Hell, what was he going to do? This wasn’t like him. He wasn’t a ditherer. He
