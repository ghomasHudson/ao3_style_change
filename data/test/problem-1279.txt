“Kreacher. He uh - fuck. He died, Draco. Two winters ago,” Harry tightens his grip on Draco, nervously biting his lip.
Draco is speechless. He stands there, mouth still hanging open as he stares at the ring in Kade’s hand, trying and failing to come up with an adequate response. This is the last thing he ever expected.
It’s not long before people start arriving. Everyone seems happy to see Harry and it settles his nerves some to know that Draco’s friends have accepted him, at least on some level. Slytherin’s are complicated, after all.
Honestly, if someone had told him he’d ring in the new year pleasantly drunk with Potter at his side, he’d have laughed in their face and had them carted off to St. Mungo’s to have their head examined.
As unbelievable as it is, Draco can’t remember the last time he laughed so much or when he’s been this relaxed. He can’t deny that being in England has been good for him. But the same irritating thought keeps crawling back to the front of his mind.
He shoos Kreacher away from the stove and starts pulling out ingredients, lining them up on the counter, and flicks his wand to start the coffee. Before long he has a pile of French toast and bacon sizzling away in a pan.
“Meet me in the greenhouse in ten minutes,” Harry whispers in Draco’s ear, just as the last of the guests head for the Floo.
don’t look at each other like that,” Astoria replies, shaking her head like she can’t believe she has to spell it out for him, “I was giving him until the end of the week and then I was taking matters into my own hands. But here you are.”
Harry watches as an array of emotions play over those sharp features. Draco’s face finally lands on shock, which quickly morphs to anger.
A moan does escape him at that, lips parted and eyes squeezed shut as Harry finally swallows him down. It feels too good to fight, and Draco surrenders, lets everything else drift from his mind, focusing only on the tight warmth of Harry’s mouth as he sucks. The slight graze of stubble against the sensitive skin of his balls sends a jolt of pleasure up his spine. His mouth falls open further, a whine escaping as he buries his hands in Harry’s hair and holds on.
When Harry pulls his fingers free, Draco gives a displeased whimper. Harry hushes him and kisses his forehead while he slicks himself up. He presses the head of his cock against Draco’s hole, the muscle loose and ready.
“I know but I thought it would be a bad idea to bring coffee through the Floo,” Malfoy replies, offering the Starbucks cup, decorated with little snowmen and reindeer, to Harry.
And with a flick, Draco’s clothes are gone. He yelps as the chilly air of the kitchen settles over his exposed skin.
“Not the same but similar, especially when they’re cut at the beginning of the flowering stage. If they weren’t so rare they would probably be used a lot more commonly,” Neville answers easily, happy to indulge Hermione’s never ending questions.
And then Harry pulls off with a loud, wet pop, nuzzling his face into the crease of Draco’s thigh and clamps a hand around the base of his cock.
“Mind if I side along you?” he asks, tilting his head a little as he looks at Draco, “Are you alright?” Potter questions with genuine concern.
Potter lifts his head, something dangerous glittering in his eyes, and Draco feels Potter’s magic flare around them, feels his own reaching out towards it.
Draco’s heart is full of love and gratitude as he looks around, completely in awe, at the strange and unique little family they have all somehow made for themselves.
But in every store front that he walks past, there are bright pink and red decorations strung up in the window displays. Hearts and tiny cupids following him as he walks towards his destination. It’s honestly a bit unnerving.
“I told you before, I trust your judgement. If you see enough good in him that you went and fell in love with the git, then he must not be all bad.”  Ron smiles at him a little sadly then. “I saw the paper yesterday. Can’t say I was surprised when you showed up last night.”
His feelings towards Malfoy are still jumbled up, a mess of confusion, contradicting everything Harry thought he knew about the other man. Yeah, he can admit now that he possibly finds Malfoy attractive. But what he’s supposed to do with that, Harry doesn’t know. He finds a lot of people attractive, both men and women, and Harry is finally starting to accept that about himself.
And then there were the bloody magnets. Because of all the Muggle things Draco could become obsessed with, it just had to be something completely ridiculous like refrigerator magnets. And so, when Draco decided Harry, and their marriage, were no longer worth it, he walked out in the middle of the night, leaving behind all these stupid things, these little reminders of himself. Things like magnets.
Draco’s hands are in his hair now, carding through it and tugging, maneuvering Harry’s head to just where he wants it, allowing him to deepen the kiss. Draco’s tongue moves in his mouth, almost filthy in the way it rolls against his own, and all Harry can do is try to give as good as he gets.
“Oh. Uh well. I was wondering if you might want to grab some coffee?” Potter asks, his cheeks flushing a little as he shuffles in place.
“But then I realized that going back to New York, back to you, wasn’t what I really wanted,” Draco swallows the lump that forms in his throat as he watches hurt and betrayal flash in Kade’s eyes, “I’m sorry,” Draco takes the engagement ring from the pocket of his trousers and slides it across the table. The clink caused by the ring as it bumps against the glass is tinged with finality, “I can’t marry you. You deserve someone who is completely and unconditionally in love with you. I can’t be that person.”
Draco doesn’t know why he keeps coming back here, holding on to the hope that he could have a normal relationship with his father. He should have learned his lesson by now. It always ends the same.
Malfoy looks startled for just a moment before his face smoothes out and Harry’s treated to another genuine smile.
Harry reaches down and takes Draco’s cock into his hand, stroking firmly, reducing Draco to stuttered words and loud moans, little uh, uhs, that Harry hopes are only for him.
Lost in his thoughts, Draco doesn’t notice right away when Harry stops dancing. He stands tense in Draco’s arms, a sad look in his green eyes.
There’s always a moment, when he’s buried so deep inside Draco’s body, and everything just becomes so overwhelming, that Harry loses it. He gives himself over to all the emotions that this irritating, beautiful bastard stirs up in him, and lets the rush of possessiveness overcome him.
Everyone had noticed the distinct differences in Draco Malfoy after the war. The way he kept to himself, sitting quietly at the back of their classes, never saying a bad word about anyone. But Harry was the only one that was bothered by the change in his former enemy. He had done everything he could think of to get under Draco’s skin, feeling accomplished when after months, he finally got a reaction.
“Hmm. I think you do know. You’re just very good at being stubborn,” she says, smiling kindly, “You get that from your mother.”
“You alright?” Kade asks, his voice groggy with sleep. He rubs his fingers over his eyes before squinting through the darkness to look at Draco.
A moment later, Draco feels the wards tingle against his skin and his nerves amplify. He looks over at Astoria helplessly and she rolls her eyes.
He and Draco had woken up the morning after their first official date to find a picture of themselves on the front page of the Prophet, accompanied by a three page article, their relationship a spectacle for everyone to see.
Draco expects more prep, Potter is nothing if not thorough, but he simply rubs a hand across his mouth and pulls Draco forward and into his lap.
Draco’s stomach flips uncertainly as his gaze catches on the smashed Muggle soda can sitting on the table. In a few short hours it’ll whisk him away back to New York. Back to a life without Harry Potter.
is whispered, barely audible, but it goes straight to Harry’s cock. He tightens his hold on Malfoy’s throat, his free hand reaching down to lace their fingers together, and then they’re spinning away.
Draco could have ignored this duty. He almost did. But in the end, marrying Astoria seemed like the right thing to do. And while it was in line with his parents wishes, Draco knows that it was his decision. His choice.
In an instant, everyone begins talking over one another, loudly drowning out Draco’s demand to be told exactly what the fuck is going on.
And that makes Harry want to crawl under the table and hide. Because while Ron might be alright with Harry befriending Draco Malfoy, he suspects his best friend would feel differently if he knew what was really going on between the two of them.
With his mind waging war on itself, Draco doesn’t even realize where he’s Disapparated to until he lands on familiar steps in front of a shabby townhouse.
When Potter’s hands sneak up underneath his shirt, fingers finding a nipple and twisting it meanly, Draco realises his own hands have been released and are hanging limply at his sides. He takes advantage of the momentary freedom and grabs at Potter’s hair, his fingers pulling roughly at the unruly curls.
“See I’d believe that, except I already asked Ginny about it and she didn’t invite him.” Harry opens his mouth but Ron barrels on before he can get a word out. “She said Pansy didn’t either.”
Kissing Harry Potter is like standing in a pit of fire—all consuming, and Draco’s happily burning with it.
Draco stands alone in the kitchen struggling to control his breathing. He’s seen Harry angry plenty of times, been on the receiving end of it more often than not, but this was different. A shiver runs down Draco’s spine as he thinks about what might have happened had he referred to Kade as his fiancé instead of his boyfriend.
“You alright?” Harry asks, the words muffled against the back of Draco’s neck, “I know it can be a lot.”
“Alright. If he makes you happy, then I’m happy,” she finally says as she rests her head on his shoulder, her hair tickling his neck.
After a full minute of stunned silence, Draco finally asks, “Why on Earth would you want me to do that?”
Or at least that’s what he keeps telling himself every time the thought of Harry Potter pops into his head.
“I.. okay I’m just going to say it..” Harry continues before trailing off again. He looks more nervous than Draco ever remembers seeing him. Angry dragons in the Tri-Wizard tournament and a racist madman trying to murder him were apparently easier for Harry to face down than whatever it was he was trying to say.
What does he want? It shouldn’t be such a hard question to answer. This - whatever it is that happened, between himself and Draco is something Harry has fixated on, playing out different scenario’s in his head over and over. He expected to be more prepared if he ever saw Draco again.
Later that afternoon, Draco looks at himself in the large mirror in the hotel loo, fussing over his appearance. He’s wearing dark wash Muggle jeans paired with a grey long sleeved shirt and he looks perfectly fine he tells himself. Not that he’s trying to look good for Harry’s sake. No. He’s always been particular about his appearance, the fact that he’s seeing Harry today makes absolutely no difference.
They’ve discussed how to handle going public with their relationship, and decided not to make a statement, rather going about their business as usual. Neither of them want to hide or sneak around but Draco’s still not sure how he feels about being seen with Harry. People will undoubtedly talk, and he knows the majority will disapprove.
Harry is still hard, it’s almost painful at this point, but he can’t seem to break the kiss, just keeps licking into Draco’s mouth as he tries to remember when exactly kissing Draco stopped feeling like a fight and started feeling like
is all Draco can get out, already completely gone, every molecule in his body focused on the feeling of Harry against him.
“Fuck you. Yes, I left but that doesn’t mean I’m not allowed to be upset about this. I had a right to fucking know!” Draco yells at a stunned Harry, “I left. And I don’t know why I thought coming back would be a good idea.”
Draco wants to ask about the ‘childhood’ comment, but he’s shocked silent by the admission, at learning yet another complicated piece of the puzzle that makes up Harry Potter.
Astoria walks over, smiling, “Yes, I can see that Draco,” she says, prying the bottle from his hands and asking Fipsy to fill some glasses.
“I’m sure. I want to show you off. Want everyone to know you’re mine,” Harry says and Draco practically melts. The possessive tone doing funny things to his heart.
“Yes, I want it. I want it. Please,” Malfoy mumbles into Harry’s mouth. Harry swallows the words with a moan and then he's finally pulling back, just enough to start getting them out of their clothes.
“No, hey. I have no problem with, er that. At all. I swear,” Harry says quickly, “You just surprised me.”
“I drank more than you. You should probably Apparate us,” Harry mumbles against his jaw, a playful nip following his words.
“You don’t mean that. This really isn’t funny,” Draco snaps. Harry sees the fear in Draco’s eyes, but he also sees something that just might be hope too.
“You’re a good person. Have you made mistakes? Yes. But you deserve to be happy, Draco. At some point, you have to stop punishing yourself for the past.”
“Draco,” he breathes, and Draco looks up him with glazed eyes, “I want you to remember something for me. Can you do that?”
“Your precious Auror duties and hero complex not keeping you busy enough?” Draco asks snidely, causing Harry to look at him sharply.
And it’s his name leaving Potter’s lips that does it. Those two syllables something substantial that sink into his very bones. His orgasm crashes through him, white-hot and violent, pulse after pulse of come hitting the floor in front of him.
Something that feels a lot like hope is spreading through his body, a million questions on the tip of his tongue. But before he can get any of them out, Hermione goes on, “Regardless, Harry will sign the divorce papers if that’s what you’re worried about. He’ll sign them because he’s still just as stupidly in love with you as he’s ever been. He would still do anything for you. And just so we’re clear, you don’t fucking deserve it.”
,” Draco snaps, turning back to the worktable. His hands clench into fists, he can feel the soil under his fingernails.
And who knew a Weasley would warm up to Draco so fast. The alcohol is probably a large contributor but Draco’s choosing to ignore that fact. He directs the line of shot glasses bobbing behind him to the table before sliding back into his seat next to Harry.
“Y-Yes,” Draco clears his throat and rubs both hands over his face, ignoring the way they shake, “I’m fine. The storm woke me up,” Draco says and finally looks over at his boyfriend, giving what he hopes is a reassuring smile, “Go back to sleep, love.”
Harry doesn’t care either way, he just wants Malfoy to make him come. And then he wants to return the favor. He wants Malfoy beneath him, wants to taste him, worship him. Wants to learn his body as intimately as he can.
Draco tenses, letting out a wrecked sob and holding Harry impossibly closer as he comes between them. His muscles contract, squeezing Harry tight and pulling him deeper, and Harry let’s himself fall. He comes hard, his orgasm going on and on, pulse after pulse making him tremble as he fills Draco up.
He breathes out, struggling to focus his mind and slow his heartbeat. Harry waits patiently, his hands resting against the brick on each side of Draco’s shoulders, head tipped forward as he too tries to regain control of himself.
“Oh don’t forget, we’re meeting Aaron for drinks tonight,” Kade reminds him, the words mumbled against the skin of his forehead.
Feeling a bit better, Harry let’s himself relax and closes his eyes. He’s almost back asleep when the door opens quietly and Hermione pokes her head in the room. “Harry, are you awake?” she asks.
Astoria waits until he has finished and cleaned his hands before saying, “I have something for you,” her tone cautious.
Kade doesn’t know that Draco had been on the wrong side of the war. He doesn’t know about the Mark that was branded on Draco’s arm. He has no idea that Draco was stupid enough to listen to his father and pledge his allegiance to a madman. He doesn’t know how many people had been killed because of the stupid decisions of Draco’s adolescent self.
“Why now, seriously? I’ve been trying to get you to sign them for five fucking years! But maybe you don’t know that. Have you actually read any of the letters I sent? Merlin knows you never bothered to reply,” Draco shuffles the thick packet of papers in his hands, the papers that will dissolve their bond once they both sign them, “That’s why I assumed coming in person might get the point across better,” Draco says, letting anger bleed into his voice, trying to cover up just how very unhinged he’s feeling.
Malfoy’s pulse flutters wildly against the place where Harry’s fingers rest on the side of his neck. Harry waits a beat, then relaxes his grip, smiling when Malfoy blinks up at him with wide eyes.
Stomach flipping, Draco quietly sets his fork down on his almost empty plate and walks over to the sink where Kade stands, waving his wand to send the clean dishes to their rightful places. Draco wraps his arms around Kade’s waist from behind, kissing the soft skin of his neck. Kade covers Draco’s hands with his own, lacing their fingers together where they rest against his stomach and laughs fondly at the open and unprompted display of affection.
Harry takes a deep breath and closes the distance between them. He reaches slowly for Draco’s hands, cradling them in his own. “I love you. I’m in love with you.
Harry feels like he’s burning, like his skin is going to burst into flames and reduce him to ash. And Draco is the only thing able to soothe the scorching fire.
Ginny takes the boys for the remainder of their winter break and Harry is suddenly left with a lot of free time on his hands. He spends nearly everyday with Malfoy, following him around the Manor, helping in the greenhouse and getting lectured on the fine art of potion brewing.
“I have hot chocolate,” Harry offers with a smirk. He squeezes Malfoy’s shoulder once and then drops his hand, the small touch does nothing to satisfy the urge burning through him. But it’s all he has so he savors it.
Dream Malfoy must understand because in the next moment he takes Harry’s wrists in each of his hands, pinning them to the back of the sofa, pushing them down until Harry can feel the strength of grip. Until he can feel the magic crackling right beneath those pale fingers.
Finally, Draco feels confident he won’t leave any body parts behind and twists them away from the alley, Harry’s bedroom pictured firmly in his mind.
Harry tries desperately to come up with a plan that will result in the end of this ridiculous situation. Because if Harry knows anything, it’s that he is not equipped to deal with polite Malfoy’s so early on a Monday morning.
His mother brought a hand up to her chest as she inhaled sharply. “I will not have you speaking to me that way, Draco.”
When he steps out Fipsy is waiting, just like they planned. The elf helps Harry sneak out to the greenhouse, leaving the gift there to give to Draco later, after the party. A few other house elves are scurrying around, working hard to get the rest of Draco’s surprise ready.
Draco shrugs. “No one in England wants to hire an ex-death eater.” He looks up at Harry and smiles. “Maybe I’ll have better luck somewhere else.”
He should turn around and Apparate home. Astoria is good at dealing with him when he gets like this. Yes, Draco knows how he can be. Snappish, vindictive. He says things he doesn’t mean. Tries to make someone else hurt the way he is.
“There’s nothing to talk about,” Draco says, his voice is cutting and sharp, but his eyes give him away, “We were friends and now we’re not. There’s nothing to discuss and I really don’t appreciate you showing up here uninvited.”
If someone doesn’t touch his cock soon, he’s going to lose his mind. He doesn’t care if it’s Malfoy or his own hand, he just needs more. He’s been teetering on the edge since Malfoy straddled him and he can’t wait any longer. Harry’s ready to jump off the cliff and fall to the sea of pleasure below.
“His name’s Kade and he’s a photographer. He’s so talented Hermione. Honestly, he’s brilliant. I- I’m happy. I love him.”
“I left to protect myself too. I didn’t think I was enough for you, I thought you would resent me. So I walked away before you could,” Draco admits quietly.
Summer seems to fly by, the days passing in a blur of sunshine and laughter. July has come and almost gone, and even though Draco knew it was approaching, he still can’t quite believe it’s Harry’s birthday already.
Still, he’s made a reservation at a Muggle hotel and he thinks it was a good decision. It isn’t as if he can just walk into the Leaky and get a room without fielding a thousand questions, not to mention the fact that his return to England would be all through Diagon by the end of the day.
Everything slows then, the world narrowing down to the point where they’re connected. Draco folds his body over Harry’s back, their skin meeting in sweat-slick perfection. Words of praise fall from Draco’s lips, softly whispered in broken syllables against the shell of Harry’s ear.
“Yes, do try to contain yourself, you brute,” Draco says in mock seriousness, his eyes wet but dancing with humor.
Malfoy just scoffs and steps further into the house. He helps Scorpius out of his coat and before he can say another word, the little boy is off, running in search of Al and James.
It’s been nearly eight months since the last time he spent a truly awful afternoon with his father, and Draco doesn’t expect this time to go any better than the last.
“Of course—but we were talking hypothetically back then,” Draco points out, clutching the heavy parchment like a life line.
“I’m supposed to meet him for tea today,” Hermione says uncertain and Harry hates that she’s stuck in the middle of this. Her and Draco had been close, striking up an unlikely friendship in eighth year that flourished when Harry and Draco began dating. She was almost as devastated as Harry was when Draco disappeared.
Potter meets his eyes, searching for something there, before he picks up his wand and twirls it in his fingers. “Maybe. But you won’t tell me no.”
“Harry, please. You’re hurting me,” Draco says quietly, trying to twist his wrists free from Harry’s grip.
Whether drawn by the racket he’s making or the smell of breakfast cooking, the boys come barreling into the room only a few minutes later, all talking over one another asking what he’s making and how soon it will be done.
The service is impeccable, as if it would be any thing less with Blaise running things, and the food is amazing. The conversation flows easy between them, it’s almost like they’re in their own little world, sitting under the stars and bright full moon. Draco’s not sure what he expected out of a date with Harry but this surpasses anything he could have dreamed up.
“Yes. Yes, I’ll marry you,” Draco says and Kade beams at him as he slides the ring onto Draco’s finger.
“Harry,” Draco grinds out as his cock throbs, aching for release, “Please, you have to let me come.”
Harry feels like he just fell asleep when his wand buzzes to wake him later that morning. He groans, ending the wake-up charm, and then pulls the pillow over his head to block out the sunlight streaming in the window. His head is throbbing and he feels like death, and there is no way he’s getting out of bed.
Malfoy looks at Harry’s hand first then at his face, hesitating slightly before gripping Harry’s hand hard and pumping his arm a few times.
“Well,” Molly glances between them with a knowing look in her eye, “I have more desserts to bring out, but I better see a plate in your hand when I come back, Harry,” she says, pointing a finger at him.
He’s still hard. Painfully, so. But Harry looks completely out of it. Draco pulls back his arousal and patiently waits for Harry to come back down. It’s excruciating. Mostly because Harry Potter post orgasm is a thing of beauty. He looks wrecked, lips bitten red and tan skin flushed. Draco thinks he could come from the visual alone.
Harry snorts. “Yeah, be grateful we were able to remove her portrait.” And then he’s raising his hand and knocking.
When Harry just continues to stare, Draco raises his eyebrows, a smile playing at the corners of mouth.
“Fine. I’ll go say hello to Harry. But you better be down in five minutes, or else you’re not going to like what I do,” she threatens, kissing his cheek and disappearing out the door.
Although, that’s all mostly due to the fact that nobody here knows who Draco really is. He’s been using the surname Black since he first came to the States and his Dark Mark is mostly unrecognizable after being tattooed over. Now a fox, his Patronus, lays curled sleeping on his forearm. Above the sleeping fox he has a beautifully done night sky, showcasing the constellation that’s his namesake, continuing up onto his bicep.
Guilt floods his stomach when he thinks about Harry here alone, waiting and hoping for him to come home, an entire ocean between them.
“I should just make a statement, do an interview and be done with it,” Harry says. He’s been thinking that might be the best solution at this point but Hermione keeps advising him against it, pointing out that Skeeter will just twist his words and only make things worse. He hates that she's right.
“I’m making no promises,” Harry says with a small smile, curling one hand around Draco’s and placing the other at his waist.
Forty minutes later, Harry tumbles out of the Floo with Albus held tightly against his hip. They’re only ten minutes late which Harry counts as a win.
“Will do mate,” Ron gives him a hard slap to the back, “And listen Harry, everything with Draco will work itself out. And if it doesn’t, I’ll have Gin Bat-Bogey Hex him.”
She turns and immediately pulls him into a tight hug, her familiar scent enveloping him. Vanilla and apple butter and warm sun on fallen pine needles.
Or Draco’s strange fascination with Muggle souvenirs. Harry still has an entire shelf full of shot glasses he’ll never use.
He slowly makes his way upstairs and into the bedroom, going straight into the en suite to open the warded cabinet above the sink. He glares at the rows of potions bottles before grabbing one. He carries it back into the bedroom where he sits on the edge of his bed and stares down at it with true hatred.
On Wednesday he has dinner with Pansy, Blaise, and Greg. They eat too much food and drink too much wine. It’s wonderful.
“The boy needs positive male influences in his life, Draco,” Lucius insists. Draco ignores the slight and snorts at the fact that his father thinks
“We’re making chili,” Harry answers, because what else can he say? The truth is too complicated and is definitely not something Harry can talk about with Malfoy standing right there.
Of course, even something as simple as getting ice cream can’t be easy. James throws a fit when Harry refuses to order him multiple flavors so he mix them together. And Al cries because they have run out of mint chocolate chip.
He feels the pressure start to build, coiling tightly at the base of his spine as his balls draw close to his body. “I’m here. I’ve got you, Draco,” he whispers, dropping down to one elbow while his other hand drifts lower to wrap around Draco’s cock, “Come on, let go.”
“If I get a hole in one…” Harry says before trailing off, eyes flitting around to look everywhere except Draco’s face.
One hand grabs his thigh, holding tight, and the other wraps around Harry’s cock, those elegant fingers quickly collecting the precome and using it to ease the glide. Harry’s vision whites out for a second, overwhelmed by the dual sensations of Draco’s hand stroking him and Draco’s cock hitting his prostate with perfect accuracy.
“It’s pretty simple actually,” Harry says, taking one more step closer. He can feel Draco’s magic buzzing around them, his own magic reaching out towards it, “I miss you. I’ve been going crazy without you—and I want you back.”
“So instead of sitting here trying to murder him with your eyes, why don’t you go and talk to him?” Ron’s words drag Harry back to the present, the chattering voices of the pub rushing back in and making his head throb.
was, to the list of ‘things we don’t talk about’. By unspoken agreement, they keep a friendly distance between themselves for the rest of the day.
Malfoy’s mouth closes around his fingers, and he immediately starts to suck. Harry’s not sure when he developed this oral fixation, but he's sure Malfoy is to blame. It’s that mouth, always so pretty and wet and warm. Soft full lips that start off pale pink but always end up abused and red. That mouth, spitting scathing insults and sharp bitter words, but can just as easily release quiet pleas and broken whimpers. Harry is addicted to that mouth. Can’t ever seem to get enough of it.
“Malfoy, hey. How’s it going?” Potter asks, and if it seems like he holds onto Draco a little longer than usual, Draco figures it’s just wishful thinking on his part.
“Ah Astoria is hosting her friends this afternoon, some sort of book club or something,” Malfoy says with a flap of his hand.
, did you just say you love me?” Draco asks, frozen to the spot, struggling to get the words unstuck and briefly considering the possibility that his hearing was somehow damaged from all the spinning in circles.
“Harry, Harry, please. So close, please,” Draco starts to ramble, and Harry groans, snapping his hips harder.
But when Harry steps inside and sees the girls at the counter wearing headbands with sparkly hearts on them, he almost wishes that he’d owled Malfoy and cancelled.
She makes a face like she just swallowed something sour and replies, “Merlin, you can call me Ginny, you overly formal prat.”
was always there, simmering just below the surface, waiting for the chance to explode and consume them both.
“You buy me coffee every morning, Potter. Say thank you, shut up, and drink it,” Malfoy orders with an eye roll.
As if he’s in charge of the narrative of the dream and somehow able to read Harry’s mind, Malfoy turns to him with a smirk as he swings one long leg over Harry’s lap, straddling him. It’s instinct, natural, that his hands should be gripping Malfoy’s sharp hip bones, pressing and squeezing, keeping Malfoy right where he wants him. Right where he belongs.
“It’s German chocolate cake,” Potter says slowly, looking at Draco like he’s the one being unreasonable, “It’s your favourite, isn’t it?”
Well that was…thoughtful. What’s Potter playing at here? Surely if he asked Draco along so he can tell him that this tentative friendship is over, he wouldn’t be buying Draco not only coffee but a muffin too. But Potter is Potter and he’s a Gryffindor, so that’s probably exactly what he’d do.
The snow glitters brightly in the sunshine, laying in a soft blanket over everything, making the tree branches sag under its weight. While the Manor isn’t always Draco’s favorite place, the sight of it in the winter is something that he never grows tired of.
, Harry knows. Knows with every molecule and cell in his body that he won’t ever love anyone the way he loves Draco Malfoy. Harry loves Draco so much he doesn’t even know how to say it, there aren’t words for the way he feels.
“Fine,” Malfoy agrees, watching Harry for a moment before copying his motions, “You’re one of those people who think cooking and potions are the same. They’re vaguely similar at most. Plus, if they were exactly the same you’d have been better at potions.”
Harry just shakes his head, stealing a quick kiss before he turns Draco and manhandles him to where he wants. Harry is standing behind him, his arms wound around Draco, hands coming to rest over top of his on the golf stick—or whatever it’s called. Draco doesn’t know and he can’t really be arsed to care at the moment with Harry standing flush against his back.
To say his mother was not pleased when she found out Draco had been speaking to his aunt, would be an understatement. He found her sitting at his kitchen table with a letter from Andromeda clutched in her hand, her face pinched and angry. She’d been snooping, which really shouldn’t have surprised Draco so much. Draco had snatched the letter away from her, but the damage was done.
“Right. Well I suppose it isn’t any of my business. So if you would just sign these papers, I’ll be out of your hair,” Draco pulls the shrunken divorce papers out of his pocket, tapping them with his wand to restore them to normal size.
Harry has to believe that there had been magic at work that day, something beyond their control, invisible threads pulling them into each other’s orbit. Maybe it was love, even then.
Eventually, though, Harry gasps for air and breaks the kiss, letting his lips trail down Draco’s neck, sucking and biting gently as he goes. Draco moans and arches against him.
“Mr. Potter,” Astoria’s assistant says and Harry stands, nervous energy thrumming through his shaky legs, “Mrs. Malfoy will see you now. Just go on back.”
It’s a scary thing—love. The most powerful magic of them all. It has the ability to make you forsake all logic and rational thought. It can break down all your walls, strip every ounce of your composure away and make you lose control.
“No, you’ve seen me reheat things. There’s a difference,” Malfoy says but he moves closer, definitely interested in what Harry’s doing.
The only way that it could be better is if there wasn’t a barrier of clothing in the way. Draco’s tempted to Vanish the infuriating fabric, but somewhere in the back of his lust hazy mind is the knowledge that Harry’s never done this before. Not with a bloke anyway.
What Draco doesn’t know, is that Potter leaves for home with Draco’s scarf stuffed in his pocket. He doesn’t know that later that night, Potter sits in his bed, holding the scarf with care, his eyes closed as he inhales Draco’s scent.
The tension in the room is heavy and Harry has no idea what to say. He doesn’t want the night to be ruined but really, all things considered, that could have gone much worse than it did.
“Go on then, Potter. Do it,” Draco goads. His sneer firmly in place, lips tilted cruelly, “You know you want to.”
Malfoy is smart and kind and a good dad. He matches Harry’s quick wit and sarcasm with his own brand of snarky comebacks. He challenges Harry, bringing out his competitive nature, but it’s nothing like the rivalry they had in the past. They’re friends now.
“Draco. Draco baby, that’s good, so good,” he rambles, hands tightening in Draco’s hair. Draco only moans in reply, the vibration pulling a whimper from Harry.
He tumbles out into the drawing room seconds later, quickly straightening his clothes and dusting himself off. Before he even has a chance to glance around and get his bearings, Harry hears footsteps approaching from down the hall.
“Stay,” Draco says impulsively. Harry gives him a questioning look so he clarifies, “The night. We don’t have to—I mean nothing else has to happen but I, I’ve missed you.”
It’s still a bit strange to think of his mother and Andromeda spending time together, but he’s glad they could reconcile. At first, he was sure it would end with nothing but more animosity between the two of them.
“I doubt that, Potter.” Draco tries to move out of Harry’s reach, intending to gather his things and leave, but a hand on his arm stops him.
“Yes, I’ve thought about it. I’m staying here, with you. I’ll try to make you breakfast in the mornings and I’ll burn the toast. We’ll argue over Quidditch teams and a million other meaningless things. I’ll make fun of your dreadful fashion sense and you’ll get annoyed when I use all the hot water in the shower,” Draco smiles, his entire face lighting up in a way Harry has missed so much, “We’ll be together. That’s what it means.”
“Er. Right then. That’s how this is gonna go,” Harry says looking defeated, “What can I do for you?”
It takes longer than he would like to push his way through the crowd and down the hallway leading to the bathrooms. By the time Harry swings the door open and steps inside, Draco is already at the sink washing his hands.
“Yeah looks that way,” Harry says, offering a small smile back. He glances down at the two boys in front of him. They’re whispering, both their faces lit up with smiles. And that, only that, can be the reason why the next words fly out of Harry’s mouth unchecked, “We should get them together for a play date sometime.”
Potter keeps his eyes on Draco throughout his entire speech and Draco, well, he’s transfixed. He’s used to Potter stuttering and stammering through conversation but
Nothing seems to change between them, while at the same time everything changes. They still meet at Starbucks most mornings, but now they trade kisses that taste like coffee and sit with their ankles hooked together beneath the table. They still talk and tease and snark at one another, but there’s an intimacy between them that wasn’t there before.
“Technically, yes. But you know we haven’t been properly together for a long time now. That’s why I’m back actually. Once Harry signs the papers, if he does, I’ll be..” Draco lets his words trail off when he sees the hurt flash in Hermione’s eyes.
Before he has time to become concerned about the sappy direction his thoughts have taken, the door swings open and Draco almost falls off his chair.
Malfoy considers him for a moment, his eyes raking over Harry’s body, taking in the sight of him breathless and begging, and then he nods.
Draco steals a truly filthy kiss, slotting his thigh between Harry’s legs and letting him feel just how much Draco likes that idea.
Draco throws his hands up in frustration. “Yes. No, I know what it is, you moron. I’m asking what it means? Why do you keep doing this?”
Harry has, irritatingly, been going on about taking him out, even though Draco argues that most of what they do together could be counted as dates already. But Harry, stubborn as ever, insists that a first date is important and Draco's resolve has finally broke. Which is why he’s currently letting Astoria dress him up like a life size doll, straightening the collar of his shirt and fiddling with his hair until it’s just right.
“Yes, everything’s fine,” she answers with a small smile. Draco sees it for what it is, a thank you for his concern. He returns the smile and nods for her to continue, “Just the case I’m working on. Apparently new evidence came in overnight and now we have to rework our entire defense. It’ll be fine. Anyways, I’m leaving now so you’ll have to get Scorp his breakfast.”
He doesn’t expect Harry to, once again, manhandle him around, laying Draco back against the pillows and quickly dragging his pants down, discarding them at the foot of the bed.
Draco stumbles backwards reaching for his wand. But before he can even aim, Ron and Neville appear out of nowhere and grab Harry by the arms.
Harry stays for breakfast, but after the table is cleared he says he needs to get home. Ron and Hermione send him off with hugs and kind words, and Harry doesn’t know what he did to deserve such amazing friends.
“That was clever, Malfoy,” Potter says, grabbing his own sled, this one wooden and large enough to hold an adult.
Draco tries to convince himself that the moment from earlier is nothing. It doesn’t mean anything. Potter was probably just uncomfortable with Draco being so close. No other explanation makes sense and he decides to stop thinking about it before he goes mad.
A few hours later, a knock sounds at the front door and Harry waves Kreacher off, going to open the door himself.
It isn’t long before Harry’s pulling Draco off. “Fucking hell. Too close,” Harry pants, his hands shaking as he pushes his sweaty hair back from his forehead, “
He leans back in and captures Draco's lips again. Gives himself over to it fully, and feels—maybe for the first time in his life—that he’s exactly where he’s meant to be.
But saying them would just make it hurt worse in the end, so he swallows them down and kisses Draco with everything he has instead.
Draco hesitated before answering truthfully. “Harry. He invited me to go with him to visit Andromeda, and I went.” Draco shrugged, then pulled a chair out and sat across from his mother. “I’ve been back a few times since.”
“This year has been full of the unexpected,” Draco says, his voice slurred and soft, eyelids starting to droop.
But they’re just that, daydreams, meaningless fantasies unlikely to come to fruition. And no matter how badly Harry wishes they could become reality, he’s pretty sure they never will.
One second Draco’s yelling at Harry and the next he finds himself shoved forcibly against the wall, breath knocked out of his lungs and Harry’s rough palms pinning his hands above his head.
They stay pressed close afterwards, allowing their breathing to slow and their heart beats to settle. Harry closes his eyes and tucks his face into Draco’s neck, just hiding there, safe.
“Don’t then.” Draco runs a hand down Harry’s chest, long fingers dancing over Harry’s ribs, “You can kiss me for as long as you want.”
“Ouch, stop! I think it’s adorable,” Harry says as he slides his hand around the back of Draco’s neck, gently tugging him into a soft kiss.
Harry takes his time opening Draco up, his fingers moving with relentless precision while he sucks Draco into his mouth, the pleasure almost too intense. When Draco is reduced to a babbling mess, Harry finally pushes inside him; his hard cock throbbing in time with Draco’s heartbeat.
“Harry James,” Hermione sighs, coming to a stop and facing him, “We talked about this. It’s a bad idea.”
“Don’t worry your pretty little head, Potter. I have a plan,” Draco answers with a grin, pulling his wand from his pocket.
They’ve done this enough times now that Potter knows he’s close, and he pulls off Draco’s cock, stilling his fingers. He ignores Draco’s complaints, leaving him hanging, squirming and twisting as he tries to find friction.
He finally pulls back beaming. “We should probably get dressed. The only person who comes through the Floo without calling first is Hermione and I’m guessing we have about a minute before she’s coming in that door.”
Harry quickly grows impatient with the slow pace and bucks his own hips up desperately, a whine escaping his mouth. Malfoy releases one of his wrists and his free hand goes to Harry’s hair, tugging and pulling, tilting Harry’s head just so, and then Malfoy’s mouth descends on his neck. It leaves a trail of buzzing and burning in its wake. Harry feels the nip of teeth, a caress of tongue and his mind blanks out for a second.
Malfoy’s calculating gaze sweeps over Harry’s face, looking for something. Whatever it is he must find it there because slowly his posture relaxes and his face smoothes.
“I was in sixth year,” Harry replies. He realizes what he’s said a moment later and wants to bite off his tongue.
He knows Ron’s right. Harry loves the party the Weasley’s throw every summer. The tradition had started after the war. When the dead were buried and everyone had spent many trying weeks grieving in their own ways, Molly insisted a get together to celebrate the living was just what everybody needed. So the bonfire became an annual event and Harry has never missed one, “Plus mum’ll lose the plot if you don’t show up,” Ron says with a pleading look.
Harry turns around with two plates piled high, but Draco’s not at the table. He was there, just a minute ago. “Draco?”
But every time he looks at Draco, he sees forever. Knowing that Draco sees a future for them too—years and years of more holidays and birthdays spent together stretching out before them—makes Harry damn well want to try.
They’ve been playing this ‘game of questions’ to get to know one another better, and though at first Draco was concerned, he quickly realized that Potter wasn’t going to ask invasive personal questions. Instead, he seems to be working from some list of ridiculous inquiries, their answers obviously not meant to be taken seriously.
Draco comes into view a minute later and Harry’s breath catches in his throat. Merlin, Harry’s missed him. Draco looks so soft; dressed in black jeans and a too big jumper, his hair curling around his ears the way it does when he’s been standing over a cauldron all day.
Hermione picks up the thread of their conversation easily, as if she hasn’t just interrupted it to wandlessly cast a spell she invented. Draco wonders if she realizes just how brilliant she is.
“Please,” Harry says, and the heat in those green eyes makes something in Draco’s chest clench in a painfully good way.
“You uh, don’t have to go yet,” Harry says hurriedly, the thought of being without Malfoy’s presence almost sending him into a panic, “It’s not really that late. We could watch another movie?”
The next morning, Draco is back in the greenhouse. He finished his work a while ago but stays sitting at his work table, enveloped in warmth, letting his thoughts drift.
His friends were concerned, but they didn’t push for an explanation, just telling him they would be there when he was ready to talk and that he could stay as long as he needed.
He lands, stumbling only a little, in a copse of trees just down the street from Number 12. Draco looks up at the shabby exterior as he approaches the house and lets the memories wash over him.
Draco’s mask slips, just for a second, at the look of pure relief on Harry’s face but he quickly slams his defenses back down.
It hits him, full force in the chest. Because the details don’t matter. He can imagine it a thousand different ways, and it doesn’t matter what job he has, or where he lives. The only constant in that happy future is Harry. It’s all
“Oh don’t even try to play dumb, Harry. You’ve been dancing around each other for months. I’ve seen the way you two look at one another,
“Draco, tell me you have not gone and done something as utterly stupid as falling for that idiot Potter,” Lucius demands, his fists straining against the Incarcerous. If his hands were free, Draco bets he’d be on the receiving end of a slap right now.
Potter spins them away from the wall and into an unused classroom before Draco can even register what’s happening. The movement so smooth and fast he’d think Potter Apparated them if he didn’t know better.
“I am not,” Harry insists, stepping forward to take his turn and getting the little orange ball into the hole on the first try. Draco kind of hates him.
Ron snorts, “It’s not a permanent thing, right? You said Robards would make his final decision once you’re done with training.”
“I would never do something so undignified,” Draco answers with a sniff, “And I don’t snore either.”
Draco swallows loudly, closing his eyes and leaning against Harry before answering, “I’m fine. As long as you’re here, I’ll be fine.”
The whole idea of it is just absurd. Yes, there might be a small part of Draco that wants more than just stupidly good sex with Potter, but he knows it could never work out between them. He would rather just enjoy what they have, for as long as it lasts. Because Draco isn’t stupid, he knows this will eventually end.
in the appropriate places, all the while keeping an eye on Draco, willing him to look over and meet Harry’s gaze.
They stand together, sharing ragged breaths and Harry presses soft kisses to Draco’s face. His eyelids, his nose, both cheeks, his forehead. And then Harry finally kisses his lips, his tongue slipping easily into Draco’s mouth.
“Fipsy is welcoming you, Harry Potter sir. If you follow me, Master and his guests is being in the sitting room,” the elf says.
Draco looks up at him through his lashes and he’s so damn beautiful, Harry has to squeeze his eyes shut. Which means he doesn’t see Draco move forward, his tongue dragging over the head of Harry’s cock and dipping into the slit. His eyes snap open, just in time to watch Draco’s mouth sink down, not stopping until Harry feels his nose brush against the hair at the base. He stays there, his tongue swirling and lips clamped down tight. Draco swallows, his throat constricting around the head, and Harry loses all ability to breathe for a second.
Harry’s brain whites out and for a second he can’t comprehend Draco’s words, but then it all rushes in, like ocean waves crashing over him and pulling him under.
“Regardless,” Draco says, waving his hand, “We aren’t nice to each other, Potter. We never have been.”
“Shh,” Harry whispers, “You’re alright, god, you’re perfect. I won’t let anyone see us.” And he won’t. Because this is
One quickly becomes two and Draco removes his mouth, stretching Harry with just his fingers. He kisses all the skin within his reach, and when Draco grazes his prostate, Harry feels like his nerve endings are sizzling—sparking and igniting. It’s all
The boys stay with Harry on Christmas Eve and Ginny is there, bright and early the next morning, along with Ron, Hermione, and baby Rose. They all watch happily as the boys tear into package after package, the living room soon filled with colorful paper and more toys than Harry knows what to do with.
Harry’s in too deep now. There’s no going back. Somehow, when Harry wasn’t looking, this small crush, the harmless attraction, took on a life of its own. Growing into something more solid day after day.
Harry doesn’t think he could form actual words if he tried, so he just nods, hoping Draco can see it. He must, because after another few seconds he starts to move.
“I know I should let him go. I’m no good for him now and I won’t be able to live with myself if I hurt him. He’s happy, he’s moved on. I should sign the papers and let him go.”
“I’ll wear that ghastly Gryffindor scarf,” Draco answers, trying to seem disgusted by the idea, when really, he can’t think of anything better than wrapping himself up in that scarf, warmed from Potter’s skin and smelling spicy, sweet just like the man himself does.
“I got you,” Harry mumbles into Draco’s chest, still licking and sucking as he comes to a standstill in the middle of the room.
Draco has a ridiculous, possessive thought that no one else should ever be allowed to witness this Just Kissed Potter. It should be for Draco’s eyes only.
“Harry,” Draco urges, hoping to encourage him into action. The teasing touches slowly driving him mad.
Harry picks up his pace, one hand stroking Draco’s cock fast, the other squeezing his throat hard, and it isn’t long before Draco is gasping, a shudder shaking his body as he spills over Harry’s fingers.
“Yeah, I reckon it did,” Harry answers, reaching across the table to thread his fingers through Draco’s, “Sort of nice wasn’t it?”
Going to the movies seems very date-like to Draco but with the kids there it might be alright. And Scorpius has never been to a Muggle movie theater before, Draco’s sure he’ll love it.
Outwardly Draco nods, while internally his panic spirals out of control. What are they going to talk about? The long list of topics they can’t discuss, leave little that they could safely converse about. Are they going to a Muggle coffee shop? Surely Potter won’t want to be seen in public with him where someone might recognize them. And what’s the point of this anyway? Is this when Potter politely tells Draco that they can’t be friends? Is that what’s happening?
They finish making the chili and when it has simmered for long enough, they take bowls into the living room to eat while they watch a movie. It strikes Harry how domestic this all is. Cooking together, eating together in front of the telly. These are things couples do. Harry supposes friends do so too, and maybe it’s just his stupid brain that keeps making the connection between Malfoy and romance.
With the Muggles attention diverted, he moves quickly over to the owl and unties the note from its outstretched leg. Without waiting for a treat, or a reply, the owl flaps its wings and takes off into the darkening sky.
Draco can tell that Harry’s getting close. His movements grow even more desperate and filthy nonsense starts escaping his mouth. Draco focuses all his attention on Harry then, completely forgetting about his own aching dick for a minute. He quickly pops the button on Harry’s jeans, lowers the zipper, and slowly works his hand inside the parted denim.
It’s the cruelest kind of lie. Because what Harry wants is to keep Draco forever, he wants to be the one to take care of him, always. And the words are right there, on the tip of Harry’s tongue;
After the war Harry had happily paid to have portraits of Remus and Tonks commissioned, knowing that it would one day be a comfort to Teddy. Over the years, Harry has visited often, both here at Hogwarts and at Andromeda’s cottage, Remus and Tonks being able to go back and forth as they please.
“Scorp!” Albus yells, peeking around Harry’s legs before rushing forward and colliding with the blonde boy. High pitched laughter fills the formerly quiet corridor, the sound echoing off the walls and making Harry wince.
“Unless you’re planning to kick me out,” Astoria says with a laugh, and relief rushes through him, “Once the boys are older and off at Hogwarts for most of the year, I assume the living arrangements will change. But for now I’m quite happy with the way things are.”
His hotel actually isn’t far from the Leaky Cauldron though and Draco can’t stop himself from shooting paranoid glances over his shoulder. The last thing he needs is for someone else to tell Harry he’s back. No, it will be better coming from him and he also can’t deny that he wants the element of surprise on his side to give him the upper hand.
“Seeing that I’ve not been an Auror for three years, no. They’re not,” Harry says flatly as he turns away suddenly, hiding his expression from Draco.
“You have no idea what I need,” Draco snaps. Everything is crashing down around him, conflicting emotions running rampant through his body. This whole idea that he could be Potter’s friend, that they could be more, that Draco could actually be happy—was so
Harry swallows down the emotion suddenly clogging his throat, his eyes burning, “Yeah, anything you want, Draco. Anything.”
“It’s not any of your business,” Draco says through gritted teeth, his own face flushing with anger. He decides to get the fuck out of there before the homophobic slurs start spewing from his fathers mouth, “I think that’s been enough of a visit for today,” Draco sneers as he roughly shoves his chair back from the table.
“Yeah?” Potter says, and it’s a question. Like he needs verbal confirmation that Draco wants this. As if Draco would ever deny him.
Draco is aware that he needs to say something, but every word he knows seems to have evaporated from his mind.
Harry rolls them over, hovering above Draco long enough to steal a kiss, then he drops down and ruts his cock against Draco’s hip. “I have a few ideas.” And he does. He knows exactly what he wants, but doesn’t know how to ask for it, can’t seem to find the words.
It’s later, after he’s gone home for the night, that the full weight of everything that happened today finally hits him.
It’s true, Harry has been going back and forth with Neville for months, long before his and Draco’s relationship progressed past friendship. Harry wanted to do something special for Draco, wanted to show him how much he means to Harry.
“Harry, it’s lovely to see you, dear,” Andromeda greets, “And you must be Draco,” she says warmly, waving them both inside.
The spark of arousal Draco feels at Harry’s words is quickly quelled by thoughts of an irate Narcissa. Harry brings their lips together in a soft kiss, “This doesn’t change anything right?” he asks, his eyes searching Draco’s face, “It just complicates things but it’ll be fine. Right?”
He doesn’t expect a fast response. To be honest, he doesn’t expect a response at all. So when Hootie flies back in the window only a half hour later, Harry jumps, lunging across the room to snatch the letter up.
Harry doesn’t pause to give Draco time to adjust, just pulls back out until only the head of his cock remains inside, and then he’s thrusting forward, again and again. Draco’s nails dig into Harry’s back, and Harry just clutches him closer, gripping Draco’s thighs hard enough to bruise. It feels like Harry is trying to crawl into Draco’s skin, his hands and mouth never breaking the contact as he keeps pounding into Draco.
His orgasm starts to build, a knot of wonderful tension in his stomach. His fingers tighten in Harry’s hair, his hips starting to roll forward. “Harry,” he gasps, “Yes, fuck, I’m close.”
Draco stares at his father, completely blindsided by this reaction. Really though, he should have expected his father to think that he was using Potter, playing a game in which he had the advantage.
I have had a blast writing this and I can’t believe it’s over!! Many, many thanks to everyone who subscribed, commented, or left kudos <3 I appreciate it more than you know!
Astoria introduces Harry to the few guests in attendance, almost all of them former Slytherin’s. They seem a bit weary of Harry but are friendly all the same. Out of everyone, Blaise Zabini seems to be the most welcoming, immediately dragging Harry into an armchair and engaging him in conversation, his loud booming laugh eclipsing everything else in the room.
But Draco can’t help but let himself, for just a brief moment, wonder what it would be like to tell Potter the truth, how it would feel to melt in Potter’s arms and stay there forever.
“You’ll what Draco? Be gone for good this time?” Hermione demands fuming. Her outburst catches the attention of the other diners and the waitress, who is leaning on the counter watching them intently.
He’ll admit that the last few weeks have been hard. Most nights he barely sleeps, his bed too empty without Draco there. At first, Draco’s excuses seemed valid, so Harry didn’t worry. But the more time that passed, the further Draco seemed to push him away. He didn’t understand it, couldn’t figure out where everything had gone so wrong.
“I don’t doubt it, but I’m guessing that’s not the only thing bothering you.” She’s suddenly serious, her eyes searching his face.
When he’s finally seated completely, Draco pants out a breath and looks at Potter. He’s so beautiful like this. And Draco can’t resist, leaning forward to crash their mouths together, whimpering when he tastes himself on Potter’s tongue.
,” Harry says in a rush, before he surges forward, grabbing Draco by the back of the head and crashing their lips together. If the moan that escapes him is any indication, Draco thinks Harry quite likes the taste of himself in Draco’s mouth.
Saliva floods Draco’s mouth as his eyes drink in the sight of Harry standing in the doorway. He’s dressed, of course, in Muggle clothes. The faded jeans hug his muscular legs in just the right places and the black Led Zeppelin t-shirt is stretched tightly across his broad chest and shoulders. His hair is a mess as usual, sticking out in different directions, looking like he just rolled out of bed. Or has just been well fucked, Draco’s traitor mind supplies unhelpfully.
“Fuck me,” Draco practically screams, when without warning Harry slams his fingers, not two but three, hard into Draco, crooking them up and rubbing them over that little nub of nerves that makes him light up like a bloody Christmas tree.
Harry almost wishes that they had gotten over themselves and became friends sooner. It seems like so much time has been wasted. But, Harry thinks, maybe if they had become friends sooner, things wouldn’t be the way they are now. And Harry likes the way things are now, probably more than he should.
He slides his fingers out gently, then slicks his cock, watching as Draco pulls his knees up and back. He leans over Draco and kisses him urgently—tongues twisting and teeth clashing together —as he lines up and pushes forward, barely meeting any resistance before his cock breaches Draco’s body.
Harry knew that Draco had become a big part of his life. But Draco’s absence has made Harry realize just how important he’s really become. Harry feels lost without him. Drifting along through the days without any sense of purpose or direction. Like a broken compass, needle spinning in endless circles.
“Excuse me? What the fuck do you mean you haven’t been an Auror for three years!” Draco exclaims shocked. He quickly crosses the room, coming to a stop only a foot from where Harry stands with his back turned.
open to you. So Harry never changed the wards. For the last five years he’s left the house open to Draco.
—” Harry gasps out, when the movement causes Draco’s cock to brush against his prostate and send electric shocks across his skin.
Draco looks stunned silent and the boys haven’t even bothered to look up from their ice cream, so Harry answers, “What exactly are you thanking us for..?”
The boys are upstairs, already asleep and Ginny just called to tell him she got a huge break on her story about the Keeper for Puddlemere United and will be extending her trip for a few more days.
Draco ignores the sick jolt his feels at the words and goes to pull the door open. Just as his fingers touch the handle, his father slams his fists down onto the table, the sound echoing around the small room.
But just as he suspected, Harry pulls off Draco’s cock and slides his fingers free, leaving Draco’s hole wet and fluttering at the emptiness. Harry gets to his feet, cupping Draco’s face in both hands as he devours his mouth.
“It’s fine ‘Mione. Go and have tea with the git. Really. It’s only fair he gets a lecture too,” Harry teases with a smile, letting her know he won’t be upset if she wants to make up with Draco.
When Potter finally pulls away the visual is even better, his lips are red and shiny, face flushed and green eyes dark.
Time creeps by slowly in the seconds before their lips meet, the tension between them building higher and higher. Then suddenly, all the choices that led here, to this moment, finally converge and explode.
“You have such a big heart, Harry, and so much love to give. And that means you hurt more than most when that love is rejected,” she says, pressing a kiss to his cheek, “It’ll get better, I promise.”
But with Draco, well, he’s always the exception isn’t he? It’s almost primal, the way Harry feels about him, some hindbrain instinct urging him to stake a claim. He wants all of Draco’s attention, wants to be the center of his universe. And maybe that’s wrong. Unhealthy. But Harry’s in too deep now to care. Draco Malfoy is
Harry expects to be laughed at, or maybe looked at like he’s insane. What he doesn’t expect is the smile that spreads across Astoria’s face.
“What? No - no, we should definitely not do that,” Draco says, panic rising in his chest as he sits up and turns to Kade with wide eyes. He’s much more awake suddenly.
“Yes,” Draco says, his eyes are almost completely black now, only a thin ring of blue-grey remaining, “Feels so good.”
And yes, they both expected something like this to happen but they didn’t want to hide, and neither of them regret making that choice. Harry absolutely refuses to keep Draco as some dirty secret. A little bad publicity isn't going to change that.
Draco works one more finger in before he finally relents. Harry vaguely hears the slick sound of Draco stroking himself, feels the blunt pressure of Draco’s cock against him, and then finally,
Draco registers the tingle of a cleaning charm and then nothing but the feeling of Harry’s warm tongue dragging roughly back and forth across his opening. Harry alternates between fast, probing licks and slow, gentle caresses. After a few minutes, Draco’s loose enough for Harry to work his tongue past the tight ring of muscle and inside. A slick finger joins Harry’s tongue and Draco moans, writhing on the bed as he rolls his arse back against Harry, needing more.
Potter doesn’t seem to have anything else to say though, as he grabs Draco by the ankles and hooks them over his shoulders. Then his thumbs are spreading Draco open.
Yeah, it’s true that Harry doesn’t hate Malfoy anymore, he hasn’t for a long time now and he’s way too old for juvenile rivalries. Harry had even spoken on the Malfoy’s behalf at the trials after the war. Well, two of the Malfoy’s. Lucius is rotting away in Azkaban and that’s just fine in Harry’s opinion.
When Harry’s nose brushes against the patch of blond curls at his groin and he swallows around Draco’s cock, his throat constricting tightly around the head, Draco arches off the bed so hard his back twinges. Draco cries out, begging and moaning shamelessly, not giving a single fuck about how needy and wrecked he probably looks. Desire burns in Harry’s eyes as he looks up, gaze locked on Draco, head still bobbing slowly. All the air evaporates from Draco’s lungs, leaving him gasping for breath.
Harry’s mind is racing and his stomach flips as he thinks about what just happened. He’s paying little attention to where he’s actually going but that’s alright. Harry has walked this path through the castle many times since the war and he reckons he could probably do so blindfolded at this point.
But still, that doesn’t make them friends. It doesn’t make them anything. There were never apologies exchanged, not a handshake, not a single nice word. Nothing.
Harry shoves into him relentlessly, still sucking and licking at Draco’s cock, and Draco chokes out a warning even though he knows it’ll make Harry stop and pull back. “Harry, ‘m gonna come, please—don’t s-stop.”
Of course, then Draco started going out of his way to rile Harry up in return, and they were right back to hurling insults at each other, fighting in the halls, and earning their fair share of disapproving looks from Professor McGonagall. But it wasn’t quite as satisfying as it had once been, at least not until Harry figured out that kissing Draco was a more efficient way to shut him up than punching him was.
Harry glances around as well, wondering how it looks to Draco. It’s a plain room, clean and decorated in neutral colors. The bed’s nice, not huge but big enough for Harry.
“You’re a spoiled brat, you know that? Can’t say no to you.” Draco pushes back against him in reply.
The sky above is dark and gloomy, the way it always seems to be here regardless of the season, and Draco can already feel the despair seeping out from the walls of the fortress that stands tall and foreboding in front of him.
Just as Harry is instructing Malfoy on the next step, the Floo flares green and Hermione and Ron step out a second later.
“It’s fine,” Harry says easily, and he wonders if getting these simple apologies from Malfoy will ever stop being shocking.
It’s so good, every touch sends a jolt of pleasure up Harry’s spine, but he can’t help thinking that this might be the last time. His last chance to have Draco, naked and on his back beneath him, to be cradled in the v of Draco’s long legs. So he tries to savour it, to be here, present, for every single second.
Draco turns to Harry, a million things he wants to say on the tip of his tongue, but he’s unable to find the words. Instead, he swallows nervously and hands the gift over to Harry.
“The point, Potter, is that I don’t want to be married to you anymore,” Draco says through gritted teeth, “The point is moving on with my life.”
“Alright, I can finish this later,” Draco says easily, “Go on and take care of your work crisis, we’ll be fine here.”
Harry pushes Draco back onto the bed, hovering above him. He kisses Draco hard, pulling Draco’s bottom lip into his mouth as he grinds their hips together. Harry breaks the kiss and Draco could cry with how good it feels to have Harry’s lips and teeth marking his skin.
Harry laughs and finally pulls back. Draco feels a cleaning charm wash over him and watches as Harry rubs a hand over his mouth as he shakes his head. Draco shivers as he loses the heat of Harry’s body, the space between them leaving him chilled.
Malfoy just continues to stare for a few very long seconds before he dissolves into laughter, his eyes crinkling at the corners and his face softening.
He envied the easy friendship the Golden Trio had. Draco had friends of course. He was popular and could easily draw a crowd of his peers. At least, he could before all the shit with Voldemort hit the fan. But he never had a friendship like that. Not while at school anyways. He has it now, with Astoria, but that’s different.
Their bodies arch together, moving in perfect synchronization, like they’re one being instead of two. Fused together in the most intimate way. Harry comes first, and the way he clutches Draco close and brokenly moans
“Why does my wife participate in a book club?” Malfoy replies, an eyebrow raised and a playful smirk on his face.
Narcissa insisted on an entire remodel after the trials. The once cold, stately house now looks warm and inviting. But no matter how much new paint is rolled onto the walls or how many furnishing and fixtures are replaced, nothing can completely remove the memories of the acts that took place here.
He’s salty sweet and delicious, and Draco lets his mouth slide wetly, all the way down. When he pulls back up he drags his tongue across the slit, savoring the way Harry twitches in his mouth.
Harry stands at the sink, his hands submerged in soapy water as he scrubs. Draco’s eyes catch on the rivulets of water that run down Harry’s toned forearms as he passes the clean dishes to Draco for drying. It all could be done much faster with magic, but Draco finds Harry’s insistence on doing chores like this the muggle way strangely endearing, so he doesn’t object.
Harry obeys quickly, yanking the shirt off and not caring that the movement knocks his glasses from his face. He moans quietly as the cold air hits his chest, making his nipples pebble.
Tonight is no exception, the Leaky is packed full of witches and wizards celebrating the end of another work week. But for some reason, it seems even louder than usual to Harry, the noise grating on his already strained nerves.
When the owl is just a dot on the horizon, Draco’s heart clenches and he knows, with startling clarity, what he wants to do. What he has to do. Because if he's learned anything, it's that real love doesn’t walk away, feelings don’t either. People do. And Draco is done walking away.
Draco sits back down in his seat and stares at the table. The only time he was ever that close, physically, to Potter was when they were fighting—and of course, there was that one terrifying broom ride when he'd almost died—neither instance really gave him a chance to appreciate being in close proximity to Potter. Back then his brain had been focused on other things, on the fists flying and the insults being thrown back and forth. He hadn’t had the opportunity to take in the way Potter smelled or how warm his hands were or how good it felt to have those arms around him.
Draco whines at the praise, then licks his lips and starts to move, raising up and dropping back down on Harry’s cock. He throws his head back, mouth hanging open as he works up a rhythm that has his cock slapping against his stomach and leaving a sticky trail behind. “Can’t—gonna, fuck, fuck,
“I um.. I had something that I wanted to say. Well um I mean… I’ve been thinking it for a while but the timing never seemed right, but now..”
The week passes quickly and without incident. Draco doesn’t see Harry again and he feels more comfortable than he thought possible at Ron and Hermione’s house.
So maybe his current plan is overstepping, crossing a line he shouldn’t cross. But as he sits in the uncomfortable chair outside of Astoria’s office he doesn’t regret his decision. Harry’s done waiting for Draco to come to him, he needs to act, to do something. And to be honest, Harry has missed Astoria too.
Malfoy just narrows his eyes and continues his failing attempts to get the offending glitter off himself. But after a few moments, their eyes meet and Malfoy cracks too, a soft laugh escaping his lips.
He’s just picking up his wand to light the burner and start browning the ground turkey when the Floo roars to life. Malfoy steps through, dusting himself off and offering Harry a smile.
Draco pulls his winter cloak tighter around himself, the soft fur lining not doing much to warm him as he makes his way across the grounds of the Manor. The frost covering the grass crunches under his feet and his breath puffs out in front of him, like little white clouds dancing in the chilly morning air. He should have cast a warming charm before he ventured outside, but he hadn’t expected it to be this cold. His fingers are already starting to go numb, so there’s no sense trying to cast one now.
Draco lets out the breath he was holding and nods. Before he can speak, Harry is addressing Hermione, his tone pleading. “Can you please get ahold of Narcissa and tell her we’ll be there soon?”
“Hey Ron. I was just about to eat, you hungry?” Harry smirks, watching Ron sniff the air before he takes a seat at the table with a smile.
“Teddy should be up from his nap soon. I thought we could have some tea and chat, before he’s awake and stealing all the attention,” she says, starting down a narrow staircase, which Draco realises a moment later leads to a basement kitchen.
Draco’s led down a hall and into a room, designated by a small sign as Visitation Room 4. He goes in and takes a seat at the table, the only piece of furniture inside. The paint is peeling from the walls, little flakes chipping off and falling to the floor, which doesn’t look like it’s been cleaned in decades.
Potter grunts in reply, his hips stuttering and losing rhythm. Draco knows he’s close, and he has to see. Needs to.
“Yeah, I guess you’re right,” Kade sighs, his shoulders dropping in defeat. But the sullen look only stays on his face for a moment before he flashes Draco a bright smile, “When are we going to England then?”
Harry nods and murmurs his thanks. They both watch Hermione turn and cross the room. She pauses with her hand on the doorknob, “I’m really happy for you, both of you. I’m only a call away if you need me,” she gives them a satisfied smile and in a twirl of green Healer robes, she disappears through the door.
Malfoy steps forward then, holding out a hand, a tight smile on his face. Ron looks ready to pull his wand but Hermione, bless her, accepts the handshake, returning Malfoy’s smile with a small one of her own.
Draco starts on the task of getting his son prepared for an afternoon spent outside in the snow. Finally, twenty minutes and one tantrum later, they all step out into the winter wonderland that covers the grounds of the Manor.
, and Harry does, feet flat against the mattress, his body arching up into it, Draco’s name on his lips.
But in that moment, when Fiendfyre raged around them, as sweat gathered on Harry’s forehead and his thighs gripped the broom as tightly as he could, the only thought he had was
This...choking thing, is still new. Harry hasn’t quite been able to wrap his mind around why he likes it so much. Or why Malfoy does too.
“Harry,” Draco says, high and breathy. A bead of sweat rolls down his temple, and Harry leans forward to catch it with his tongue. “Love you, too.”
“Harry, please,” Draco says through gritted teeth, his body still moving against Harry’s fingers and mouth.
“I’m going to kill her,” Harry snaps out as he walks with Hermione through the crowded streets of London.
“I assumed it was obvious,” Draco says with an eye roll, “I meant, as you well know, that you had to pick a professor who taught at Hogwarts while we were there. And the fact that you cheated your way out of it and chose Longbottom, of all people, is disturbing. Honestly, Potter, I’d have more respect for you if you’d said, I don’t know, Flitwick or something.”
Draco lets his eyes drift around the room, taking in the details he missed yesterday. Everything Draco left behind is there.
But his legs won’t corporate. Something keeps him standing there, frozen, probably the part of him that knows beyond that door lies comfort. Refuge from the anger and regret. Potter can make all of it fade away to nothing. Like the sun chasing rain clouds out of the sky.
Harry laughs, leaning in to kiss Astoria’s cheek, “It’s fine. I am allowed to pick on him about this later though, right?”
“Sorry,” Harry apologizes with a grin, “That’s what Hermione always calls it,” he explains. He does not, however, explain that he had definitely waited for Malfoy to take a drink before saying it.
Hermione storms into the room, her lips pressed together, but as she takes in the scene, a smile breaks across her face. “While I’m very happy that you two idiots have apparently reconciled your differences, I need to speak to Draco. Alone,” Hermione says, the smile slipping.
While he has his friends and plenty of people who love and care about him, things are different now. They all seldom get together anymore. Pub nights and pick-up Quidditch games are rare these days.
Draco Malfoy has just barreled out of the Floo and into Harry, which is presumably Harry’s own fault, and Malfoy is the one apologizing.
His fingers tremble as he pops the button on Potter’s jeans. His breath stutters out of him as he lowers the zipper.
But Draco’s not thinking about all that right now, instead, he lets his eyes hungrily take in the details of the picture he’s holding in his hands, and he wonders at how, a year ago, he never would have imagined that he’d be friends—best friends, possibly—with Harry Potter.
“A good one?” Draco asks nervously. Suddenly he’s terrified that this is moving too fast, that he pushed Harry too far. That he messed this up before it ever even started.
Draco’s hands twitch beneath Harry’s grip, his eyes flitting from Harry’s face to his cock—dripping and smacking against his stomach. “Go on,” Harry gasps, freeing Draco’s hands, “Touch – ah fuck – touch me, Draco.”
It stings, the stretch just this side of painful but the pleasure, the feeling of Draco hard and throbbing, held so tightly inside Harry’s body, is earth shattering. Harry feels full and whole, in a way he never has before.
“Didn’t sleep well?” Kade asks cautiously, knowing from experience to tread lightly when Draco’s in this sort of mood, “Have some coffee, you’ll feel better.”
“It’s not your fault, dear.” Andromeda pats his hand, before continuing. “The point is, the only regret I have, is that we didn’t have more time together,” she says, looking away again and clearing her throat, “Now I know I’m just a silly old woman, but I hope you’ll take some advice.”
“No. I wanted to cover the Mark with something…” Draco swallows loudly, “From the artist to the ink it’s completely Muggle,” he finally says quietly, grey eyes fixed on his forearm.
When Harry wakes up the next morning he feels like he’s been run over by the Knight Bus. His head is throbbing in time with his heartbeat and his whole body aches. He gingerly rolls to his side to reach his wand and casts a quick a Tempus. It’s almost noon. Harry knows he’ll feel better once he takes a pain potion and has something to eat but he can’t make himself get up. Instead, he lays there, in his bed that has way too much extra space, and gives into thoughts of blond hair and grey eyes.
Ron doesn’t seem shocked by the admission, simply humming quietly and knocking his shoulder against Harry’s. “How long?” he asks, and Harry doesn’t know if he means how long they’ve been fucking or how long Harry’s been in love with him. Either way the answer is the same.
With a wave of Potter’s wand they’re both naked, their clothes reappearing in a neat pile on a dusty chair by the door. He shoves at Draco, making him stumble backwards until his legs bump against a desk.
It isn’t long before Draco’s movements stutter and then speed up. He reaches a hand between them and grips Harry’s cock in his tight fist, and it’s too much. Harry feels his muscles clench and ripple around Draco’s cock as he comes, stripes of white coating his stomach and chest.
“Fine. I’m fine. A little stressed maybe, but having my mother taking up residence in my guest room will do that,” Draco answers, making Andromeda laugh.
With the smallest effort, Harry hoists Draco up, those long legs wrapping around his waist. Draco rolls his hips, rutting his half-hard cock against Harry’s and it’s so,
Once again, as if reading his thoughts, Malfoy shimmies backwards off the sofa, kneeling in between Harry’s spread legs, his hands running gently against Harry’s thighs, the muscles tensing under his hands.
“I love you,” Harry breathes against his mouth when they finally part, and Draco feels like his skin is suddenly on fire.
“Present later, sex now,” Harry retorts, his nimble fingers reaching for the button on Draco’s jeans.
Harry must sense he needs something more to tip him over the edge. His hips stop and he pulls out. Before Draco can complain, he flips him back over, roughly pulling him up to his hands and knees. Harry thrusts back in hard, the angle perfect, his cock hitting Draco’s prostate with every pump of his hips.
When Draco’s legs bump against the edge of the bed, Harry grabs roughly at his belt with one hand while the other palms Draco’s hard cock.
Harry finally releases the death grip he has on Draco and sits up, rubbing both hands over his face, “Well it looks like we’ll be dealing with everything sooner rather than later. Pity too, I was planning on keeping you in bed all day,” he says calmly, his mouth twitching at the corners.
“I missed you,” Draco says, as Harry goes about covering every inch of skin available in bites and open-mouthed kisses, “I missed you so fucking much. God, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.”
In the end, the choice is made for him when Potter opens the door, the smile on his face melting away when he gets a good look at Draco.
“Don’t you dare lie to me Harry James. Honestly, you’re twenty-seven, a grown man. You should know how to take care of yourself by now,” she says, her voice much too loud.
The simple truth of it is, Harry loves Draco, and there’s no one else in the world he would rather go through all the ups and downs of life with.
“Ivan,” the boy says quickly, thrusting out a hand, “Ivan Kishmann. It’s great to meet you sir. I-I read the interview that you and Mr. Malfoy did, and it—well it really helped me. So, thank you.”
The swings look like broomsticks and not only swing forward and backward but dip up and down too. A green dragon lowers its scaly tail to the ground, allowing the children to climb up easily and slide down off its snout. The sandbox is piled high with multicolored enchanted sand that sparkles in the afternoon sun and easily moulds into whatever shape the children desire.
“Yes,” Astoria says, pinning him with a look, “and now it’s not so hypothetical. It doesn’t change anything. I just want you to be happy, Draco.”
“No I mean—“ Harry blows out a breath. He knows it’s unlikely that Malfoy has an ulterior motive but old habits die hard and fuck it, he has to know, “Why did you say yes when I suggested getting the kids together? Why are you being nice to me? Just—why?”
Harry smiles for the first time in the last 24 hours and falls back against the bed with a hysterical laugh, because holy shit he really just did that.
“I haven’t signed. I mean, it would be amazing, but the training schedule is brutal. I’d probably have to move and…” Harry trails off with a shrug.
This chapter kind of ran away from me a bit, so this update is longer than usual! It picks up right where the last chapter ended. Enjoy <3
Right as Draco is washing the knife off in the sink, Fipsy pops into the room, alerting him to Potter’s arrival. Draco instructs the elf to show them in and lifts Scorp off the counter, setting him down on his feet and smiling in amusement as his son takes off out of the kitchen, excited to see his friends.
“Draco,” Malfoy offers with a nod, and this time when he smiles at Hermione it’s a little less manic. He offers his hand to Ron next, who just stares at it with wide eyes. Malfoy eventually lowers his hand and steps back closer to Harry.
“See, already better right?” Kade smirks, flicking his wand to send his dirty plate and mug to the sink to start washing.
“Hmm,” Draco hums, his hands already starting to tug at Harry’s hair. Merlin, Harry loves that, “I like how you think.”
“I’m going to get a drink,” Harry states, narrowing his tired eyes, “Try not to knock the tree over, please.”
Draco can’t believe his fingers are wrapped around Harry’s hard cock. He can’t believe that he’s the one that has Harry slowly shaking apart. Can’t believe the ease with which their lips keep meeting in urgent kisses, the way Harry grips his shoulder so hard his pale skin is sure to bruise.
It’s a real hug. Warm and calming, and even though Draco’s a good few inches taller, Potter seems to completely surround him. His arms are tight around Draco’s body, one hand firmly gripping the back of his head to guide it closer.
“Do you know how hard it was to keep my hands off you all day?” Harry growls against his throat, his teeth nipping at the skin there. “It was torture, watching you walk around in
Kudos and comments are very much appreciated! I’ll have chapter 4 up next week. Thanks so much for reading <3
Draco squeezes his eyes shut, but he can feel Potter’s body pressing into him gently, can feel his warm breath on his face, the calluses on his hands, his magic buzzing against the flushed skin of Draco’s cheeks.
She’s still staring at him, face pale, eyes wide and Draco thinks the best course of action is for him to try and explain.
“Can I?” Draco’s voice sounds raw and fucked out. He pulled off just far enough to speak, his breath ghosting over spit-slick skin and making Harry shiver. His mouth is red, face flushed, and Harry can’t resist running his knuckles over a cheekbone, smiling when Draco leans into the touch.
Draco’s mouth is devastatingly hot as it moves against him and Harry lets himself sink into the feeling. His body soon relaxes enough to allow Draco’s tongue to push past the tight ring of muscle. And isn’t that just a whole new sensation; Draco’s tongue working further in, licking against sensitive tissues and nerves, lighting Harry up from the inside out.
Their eyes meet in the mirror, and the jealousy that’s been building all night flares bright in Harry’s chest. Draco opens his mouth but Harry shakes his head. “Don’t.”
Draco inhales sharply. Harry’s words light a fire burning through his blood, which is all very quickly heading south.
The next afternoon Harry goes to the Manor, thankful that Neville okay-ed taking Draco’s present through the Floo.
Andromeda smiles at him again but there’s a sadness in her voice when she speaks. “Yes, really. It’s your eyes, they’re exactly the same shade as Cissy’s.”
They carry the boys upstairs, all of them breathing softly with eyes closed as the blankets are tucked around them. Harry lingers in the room, the sight the boys make keeping him rooted to the spot. Seeing three boys instead of two isn’t so uncommon considering Teddy sleeps over regularly, but the blonde head alongside his two boys
The thought of lying to Potter, even over something so insignificant, makes Draco’s stomach flip uncomfortably. He wants Potter’s trust and he wants to deserve it.
Draco gratefully accepts the mug that’s offered to him. He takes a sip and groans, his mood already improving as the sweet hazelnut coffee warms his belly.
“Good morning,” Kade says, glancing up with a smile as Draco enters the room. He’s tapping away at that blasted Muggle phone that he insists on carrying around everywhere.
Draco does, making Harry groan loudly, his hips fucking into Draco’s mouth erratically, before they stutter and Harry is gasping out a sound that’s really more of a sob than a moan.
“You’re welcome.” Potter nudges his glasses up his nose, there’s a smudge across the bottom of the left lens, and Draco’s fingers itch to snatch the glasses from Potter's face and clean them. “If you’re not busy tonight, I’m making curry for dinner. You could...come over. If you want.”
Potter uses both hands now, holding Draco firmly in place as he pulls Potter’s jeans down, just enough to free his cock.
“Harry, listen,” Astoria says with a sigh. She’s sitting in the chair beside him, her small hands folded primly in her lap, “If you’re here to ask me to talk to Draco, you should know I’ve already tried. He’s being ridiculously stubborn about the whole thing.”
“Well I think we should talk about it. So, what’s the deal with you two?” Astoria asks, and Draco knows he isn’t going to get out of it. She’s let him avoid the subject for long enough.
They’re silent for a few moments before Harry speaks again, failing to fight the urge to ask the question he’s been pondering for a week.
She walks into the bathroom still muttering under her breath and when she returns a minute later she’s carrying a potion vial in one hand and a glass of cold water in the other.
“You’re not bad yourself, Potter,” Draco replies and Harry pinches his side in retaliation to the surname.
Harry’s mouth drops open and his heart beat picks up speed. The meaning of Malfoy’s words ring loud and clear in his ears.
“Oh come on, Potter! You keep giving me the hard questions,” Draco whines playfully. He’s on his second cup of coffee and is actually quite comfortable sitting in Starbucks with Potter.
Potter grips his own cock tightly around the base and Draco lifts up without needing to be told, silently waiting for Potter to conjure lube and line himself up. And then he sinks down, savoring every single second of the delicious burn.
Harry fists his hands in Draco’s shirt as they stand together sharing shaky breaths. Magic crackles in the air around them.
Waking up in Harry’s arms isn’t something Draco ever thought he would experience again, but now that he is, he can’t imagine waking up any other way.
Harry nods and gestures for him to elaborate. He silently prays that this has nothing to do with a certain blond haired git.
They stumble against Harry’s kitchen table, breathless and laughing. Draco doesn’t want to allow the feeling pulsing between them to fade, so mumbling a cushioning charm, he drops quickly to his knees. His deft fingers make fast work of Harry’s flies, then Draco is tugging down Harry’s jeans and pants, letting them pool around his ankles.
“You’re still married,” Hermione states matter of factly, her eyes narrowed and her lips pressed tightly together, smudging her pink lipstick.
Draco just nods. He understands. There’s no way he would’ve been able to go back and live at the Manor, even if the Ministry hadn’t taken it for reparations. “I was here once, when I was little. Mother brought me to visit Aunt Walburga.” Draco grimaces at the memory. “She was terrifying.”
Harry’s forgetting that this is a dream, that knowledge slipping further and further away the more Malfoy touches him. It feels real. Could his brain really think this up? Maybe Malfoy never left, maybe this is really happening.
It’s like a switch is suddenly flipped in his head and it all becomes clear in that moment. He has feelings for Harry. Deep, overwhelming feelings. Like, wants to be with him every second of the day, wants to wake up next to him every morning and fall asleep in his arms every night, wants to make him happy and be the reason he smiles,
When Draco had asked why Harry wanted to do something as pedestrian as going to a Muggle carnival, Harry had simply answered that he had never got to go as a kid and he’d always wanted to. Draco’s heart had clenched in his chest at Harry’s answer and now, here they were.
Which is why Harry’s thankful it’s Ron who finds him there only a few minutes later. The front door creaks open before closing softly, and then his best friend is dropping down beside him, blanket wrapped around his shoulders and eyes tired.
Draco’s hand tightens, twists on the upstroke, and Harry bucks into it. He’s so, so close, can feel it building, taking him impossibly higher. And then—
He’d never been more grateful to Ginny for giving him the access code to the Harpies stadium. The pitch was empty, as he knew it would be, and he breathed deeply before kicking off and shooting into the cloudless sky. Harry flew for hours, until his hands ached from gripping his broom and his eyes started to sting from the wind whipping around him.
“Oh stop,” Astoria chides, coming to stand behind him, hooking her chin over his shoulder, “You look gorgeous, darling. Harry’s not going to be able to keep his eyes, or his hands, off you,” she says with a smirk.
“Good, good,” Draco answers, finally pulling back and smoothing his shirt down, “You ready to head out?”
“Oh, you’re one of those people,” Malfoy drawls, his tone teasing. He’s migrated even closer to Harry now, looking over his shoulder. Harry tries to focus on what he’s doing and not on the way his body lights up, tingly and hyperaware of Malfoy’s close proximity, “I should have known you’d be one of
“If you call getting attacked by a werewolf drastic, then yeah. You could say that,” Harry replies simply, shrugging one shoulder as if it means nothing.
Harry sucks in a shuddering breath and pulls Draco down onto his chest, clutching at him and whispering nonsense words in his ear. Harry doesn’t know how long they stay there like that, wrapped around each other, bodies still connected, but he’d be happy staying right here, in this moment forever.
Harry removes Draco’s clothes slowly, committing every inch of skin he exposes to memory. He traces his fingers over every perfect imperfection, over each freckle and every scar. He kisses Draco, from his bony ankles, up toned legs, to his flat stomach. The his mouth moves higher, over Draco’s collarbones, lips brushing against the pulse point in his neck. Finally, he reaches Draco’s mouth, nipping gently at soft lips, dipping his tongue inside again and again.
Just when coherent thought is becoming a difficult feat, Potter pulls back. His lips are shiny-red and wet. He’s beautiful. The flushed face and bright eyes make him look like a painting. Like something men used to pay money to stand around in back rooms and gaze at.
As he and Hermione make their way back to Harry’s—their walk a lot longer on the way home since he’s unable to Apparate with the plant—Harry senses her eyes on him.
Suddenly, the need to see Draco, to look into those blue-grey eyes and watch as he comes, flares bright behind Harry’s ribs.
“It’s nice to see you Granger,” Malfoy says, friendly enough, but Harry can hear the tension underneath the light tone.
He doesn’t think about what will happen after this, doesn’t think about the pain and the heartbreak he knows he’ll suffer. Instead, he thinks about how whole and complete he feels, buried deep inside Draco. He thinks about how much he loves him, how much better and brighter his life has become since Draco came along and filled in all the empty spaces.
“My aunt,” Potter answers, his voice tight, and it’s clear that more questions will not be welcomed.
Malfoy is standing ram rod straight, his shoulders almost to his ears and Harry has to fight the urge to run a soothing hand down his back.
Malfoy does, and Harry can feel Malfoy’s heart speed up from where their chests are pressed together. Harry slips two fingers inside, resting them on Malfoy’s tongue.
Draco breathes in deeply, tries to calm his racing heart, and affects a cool tone, “Charming as that is, Potter, I’d like to get cleaned up and go back to the dorms.”
Draco’s mouth parts and his eyes widen, the angry flush that stains his cheeks starts to darken and spread down his neck. Harry wants to know how far down it goes. But he’s not thinking about that right now.
Harry snorts, not quite sure what to do with the man sitting beside him. Blaise snaps a few shots of Malfoy before calling out to him.
Draco pushes Harry down on his bed, still not over the sight of Harry stretched out on his sheets, no matter how many times he’s seen it over the last few weeks.
“It’s perfect, thank you,” Draco says, audibly swallowing, his adams apple bobbing, “No one’s ever—“ Draco breaks off, shaking his head and struggling for words.
“Harry dear! Oh I’m so glad you came,” Molly exclaims, stepping around Draco to pull Harry into a hug. Draco can’t help but watch as Harry’s tense shoulders relax and the furrow between his brows disappears as his surrogate mother hugs him tightly.
Draco feels a cleaning charm wash over him and the sheets a moment later. He’s content to just lay there and never move again but Harry maneuvers theirs bodies, pulling Draco against his chest tightly, their legs tangled together.
Harry has slept in his bed a handful of times now, something definitely new, and Draco doesn’t think he’ll ever get used to waking up in Harry’s arms. Still baffled at the idea that he gets to have this.
Something is wrong here. Malfoy is meant to mock Harry, to call him uncultured and mannerless, he should be pointing out Harry’s lack of parents or calling someone a Mudblood or something. Anything but this stiff politeness.
Most of the time Draco’s able to overlook the fact that his life here is based on lies and half truths. He’s used to hiding parts of himself from others. But tonight he aches with longing, wanting to be with someone who really knows him. Someone who knows his past and still chooses to love him anyway.
Without waiting for Draco to reply, Harry brings their lips together. Tentative at first, a question. But then Draco opens his mouth, a whimper escaping, the sound vibrating against Harry’s lips. And suddenly everything is fire. Draco’s hands find their way into Harry’s hair, pulling hard. Harry growls and nips at Draco’s bottom lip, only too soothe what he’s just bitten with a soft kiss. Draco rolls his hips, arching up as Harry grinds down, their tongues sliding together in the most delicious way.
“So,” Harry says, after they’ve soaked in silence for a while. He knows they need to talk, but he’s not sure where to start.
Potter laughs and then they’re twisting away from the sidewalk, landing in a secluded alley somewhere in London a moment later. Potter leads him out of the alley and down the street, their shoulders brushing as they walk.
They all sip their tea in silence for a moment, and then Harry is asking after Teddy. Andromeda lights up as she talks about her grandson and Draco is happy that the boy seems to have so many people who love him in his life.
Draco forces his eyes open, meeting Harry’s gaze, and he can’t hold back the sob that claws its way out of his throat at the look of unguarded emotion shining in Harry’s eyes.
“I wanted to remind you about the bonfire tomorrow. Mum was fretting that she hasn’t heard from you in a few days and wanted to make sure you were still coming.”
“Fuck you, Malfoy. Merlin, give a guy a minute,” Potter complains, still out of breath, but he moves away instantly.
Draco’s brain stutters and stops for a moment, every part of his body coming to a standstill as he struggles to comprehend Harry’s words.
“I’ve got you,” Harry says. And this time it doesn’t send Draco into a panic—instead it settles some broken part inside his chest. Makes him feel safe and cared for. Special.
“Go on,” Draco says with a wave of his hand, resigned to the fact that this may well be the strangest conversation he’s ever been apart of.
After everyone has been fed and Draco has gotten his payback by charming Harry’s silverware Slytherin green, they send the boys off to get dressed while they start cleaning up.
Draco had no idea cooking was one of the many talents Harry Potter possessed. Makes sense really, the prat is good at everything.
Draco knees his way onto the bed, running his hands up Harry’s legs as he goes. When he’s settled comfortably, he leans forward and places kisses and bites across Harry’s stomach, exposed where his shirt has ridden up. He kisses the trail of dark hair that leads down, ignoring Harry’s dick completely and moving lower. Draco kisses at the inside of his thighs, letting his nose drag up the crease of Harry’s leg before biting at a hip bone.
Yeah, Harry likes Malfoy. Who is very much married. Why is everything in Harry’s life so complicated?
He stands up, knocking the chair over and not bothering to right it. He ignores his mother and Astoria’s concerned looks and walks to the hall closet, gathering his shoes. He pockets his wand, runs a hand through his hair to smooth it down.
Feel free to scream at me in the comments but I promise there will be a happy ending for our boys <3
His mother had given him the silent treatment for exactly two days before she agreed to meet with her sister. They’ve had lunch together nearly everyday since. It’s good. And the fact that his father is irate makes the whole thing even better in Draco’s opinion.
