cheated? You’re the one who changed route.”
people, not ten. That could be important.
Draco glances at Harry, hoping to find something like disbelief. Harry’s face gives nothing away though, and Draco’s reminded of the meticulous training Aurors have to go through before they can even become Juniors. No doubt that includes hours of facial expression training.
“Of course I do, Mr Malfoy,”Audrey reasons. “I’m your MediWitch. I saw them when I was checking you for physical harm, and my charms picked up pretty quickly.”
“As if Malfoy. You’ve probably never kissed anyone before!” Harry knows it’s weak, but his brain is mostly offline thanks to the Firewhiskey and the idea of what’s about to happen. Because of course he’s going to kiss Malfoy.
“Time out!” Harry’s voice fills the room an hour later, and I turn the lights up so everyone can see normally.
“Mother?”
a child.”
Malfoy to join. With an exaggerated sigh, Malfoy makes his way to the circle, sitting down between Theo and Blaise.
walked into a cupboard, the handle should be on the door behind him. Except the door behind him has closed up, leaving no exit. He feels his breaths quicken and his heartbeat spike. Harry is transported back to when he was ten years old and living in a cupboard. He remembers Dudley jumping on the stairs just to make dust fall from the ceiling. He remembers pounding on the small door, shouting on the other side loud and frightening. Suddenly becoming jumpy, Harry turns around and starts prodding the walls with his wand. There has to be a way out, he tells himself. And if there isn’t, you can just create one. You’re a wizard, he tells himself. And if you fail, Malfoy could probably do it better than you anyway. Except Malfoy doesn’t seem at all affected by the confined space, or the proximity to Harry, or the dust and cobwebs. If anything, he seems quite comfortable.
Draco sighs as he picks up his canvases and sets his materials floating behind him. He’s being ridiculous. They haven’t even fucked yet, so Harry isn’t keeping him around for that. It’s pure emotion, not sex. He needs to remind himself, this is not like his short lived relationships of the past years. This isn’t based on fucking, on pushing aside emotions. This will last. It burns like a candle, relaxing him and keeping him steady. He needs to indulge in it, and learn that it’s okay to want it.
Malfoy scowls at him. He opens his mouth to reply—more likely snap, if his expression is anything to go by—but seems to think better as it clicks shut. Malfoy broods for a second longer before schooling his features. “Wanna play chess?”
Draco sneers. A perfect reason to refuse any of them. Surely they can’t be that good anyway. Right?
It’s hard to balance life and work with his past. It always has been, and he knew it would be especially so if he chose to become an Unspeakable. Yet here he is. He’s gone through so much to get to where he is, and despite everything he’s done since he was 17, he’s going to die like this. Panic seeps in further than the mud ever could, reaching his heart and gripping it with a fist colder than the winter air. He shakes, his body exhausted and freezing. There’s nothing he can do. Nothing. He’s forced to sit in a dirt trap, in a forest, near a deserted village, miles from home.
I scoff. “They stopped caring about blood. Mine, at least. And my
pale.”
Draco hums, tearing his gaze from Harry’s face. “They probably have some time modifying spells in their kitchen.”
“Wha- What are you doing Potter?” Draco demands, a slight shaking in his voice which he desperately tries to hide. Potter can not know how affected he is.
“How does she have so much energy?” Ron groans. I look at him, and for the first time I notice the beads of sweat rolling down his forehead and neck. When I flick my attention to Harry, I see him flushed and sweaty too, his normal mop of hair somehow worse than normal.
“Let’s make a toast,” I announce, raising my wine glass.
looks like is a bunch of curves, but they are so graceful and purposeful, that Harry—who knows absolutely nothing about art—can just tell it will be amazing. There’s no doubt in his mind that Malfoy’s painted them, and if this second one is anywhere near as good as the flowers he’s already finished, it will deserve to be in a museum.
. Draco laughs, his eyes so dark and his pale skin flushed, but he moves over to the untouched nipple. It’s hard and tight, and as Draco bends to lick at it, Harry’s head falls back onto the pillows yet again. Draco swirls his tongue around it and sucks, his mouth warm and sure. He’s confident, something Harry is immensely grateful for. It’s incredibly hot.
you-”
“Hmph. It’s Chapter 8.” I draw out the response unnecessarily.
Draco’s hand goes flying from where it was just resting under his pillow, hitting his wand, randomly hoping to shut off the alarm. He grumbles curses under his breath as he rolls over onto his back. His eyes blink a couple of times as they open, adjusting to the light. Or rather, the lack of light. He immediately sits up, exhaustion forgotten as adrenaline rushes through his veins. If he’s being woken up at this ungodly hour, it can’t be good. Actually, it’s guaranteed to be an emergency. With no time to shower or eat, Draco leaps out of bed and digs around for his work robes. Monday is usually his day off, and while he
Potter doesn’t seem the least bit deterred. “Brilliant!” He leans forward and traces the small cut with the tip of his finger. He hooks his short nails into it, and tries to pull. A compartment slides easily out, a small drawer. Inside sits a piece of leather, dyed purple and silver.
Harry’s thoughts flick to Malfoy, and he wonders if he’s just as cold as Harry is. He imagines Malfoy shivering under his blankets, but instead of just being curious, Harry feels a streak of concern shift through him. No one should be this cold, and Harry feels awful for even thinking about it in a humorous way. He shakes his head; he needs to be nicer to Malfoy. To Draco.
“You can have the bed back tomorrow night.”
His words break through the remaining fog in Harry’s mind, finally clearing away the cover of anger.
“Where did you get that
Now though, he knows it’s much deeper than that. Potter—while he does have a thing for saving people—is really just trying to make sure no one feels the way he did as a child. He knows first hand how hatred can cling to one’s heart and slowly pull it to shreds, and will do anything to prevent others experiencing it. It was too late for Draco by then, having lived with a barely-human man bent on genocide for a year, but that hadn’t stopped Potter trying.
Draco keeps his head down, not wanting to think any more about the people who would have lived here. If he spends any other second wondering, he’ll spiral. When he sees a person, or even a sign of a person, he automatically jumps to what he doesn’t know about them. Their friends and their experiences with them. Their dreams and ambitions, their memories, their family life, their nightmares and worries. It makes him feel unbalanced, to know basically nothing about the people around him. He thought being an Unspeakable might help somewhat, but it hasn’t really.
“Oh, wow,” Potter muses under his breath. Draco had forgotten about him, following as he was in absolute silence. “It’s gorgeous.” Draco can only nod numbly.
Harry nods, transfixed on what Draco is saying.
The village is bustling today as always, the Sunday warmth calling out the crowds. The sky is clear, a pale blue matching Draco’s trousers. Harry holds his hand as they approach the courtyard, the water fountain bright and clean. People sit on the edge, milling around and talking. As they come closer, Draco can see people in every shop. Most of them are carrying bags lined up and down their arms, straining to hold them all.
Draco shakes his head. “It’s really not though.” He stands up and swaps places with him. “The charm work required to move things across to the other Cabinet is missing. That’s why we can touch it without being dragged Merlin-knows-where.”
Malfoy shrugs. “Not my problem.”
“So you wrapped—what’s that, three?—blankets around yourself?” He raises a delicate eyebrow at Harry, and hums around his next spoonful.
With all eyes turned to watch who it lands on, Harry takes a moment to scan the room again. There’s the circle of gay girls also playing spin the bottle, another group of people playing a drinking game of some sort, and not much else happening. The flash of blond hair he’s looking for is nowhere to be found, and he sighs under his breath. Bloody Malfoy must be invisible.
Draco turns his attention to Potter, only to find him dangling Draco’s wand from his fingers. Draco growls at him and lunges for the wood, snatching it into his hand and backing out of reach instantly. Magic thrums up his arm through the contact, and he feels his body relax again.
Malfoy actually does pout now, and Harry has to turn away. “Ok then,” Malfoy reluctantly says. “I’m going to make myself a tea, do you want one?”
The bottle spins and spins and spins. Harry nearly goes dizzy from watching it move, trying to predict where it will end up. Eventually it begins to slow down. Harry tracks its movements, his eyes flitting from Terry to Anthony to Dean to Seamus to…
Potter scoops the four bottles up as he passes the coins over. Parsons carefully counts them all out, smiling when he’s done. “Have a nice day,” he calls out as I’m being dragged out of the little shop. The day has quickly come to a close, the sun setting and streaking the sky with reds and pinks.
“Well?” He asks, prodding Harry in the ribs. “Anything to say to that?”
Harry scowls at him but drops it, knowing he isn’t going to win. “What does this one do then?”
I stare, wide-eyed, at the definition. My hand throbs as I take it in and I rub at it in frustration. Harry grabs my attention by tugging on my arm. As I watch, he lifts it up to inspect it.
Harry nuzzles Draco’s entire cock through the fabric, stopping when he finds his balls. He sucks on them through the cloth and Draco rocks upwards, trying to get as much of that warmth onto him as possible. Harry moves his mouth to the head of Draco’s cock, and Draco cries out.
“Sorry, I just didn’t know if I’d see you again,” she whispers into his neck.
“Words.”
He slides a book over to me, and I wince at the size of it. “Harry, this will take all night.” I’m not really in the mood to read after having my back torn apart and magically stitched back together in the same night.
Draco drops his eyes, not able to look at Harry. In a small voice, he mumbles, “My father paid tens of thousands of galleons to charities. He helped people too.”
“Is there anything different about it? I always thought that if an angel Fell, the chance of them Rising again was quite slim.”

I forgot all about her theory. But I can’t tell her that. “Not quite,” I carefully confess. “There is too much criteria to match perfectly.” It's not exactly a lie, it’s a long list.
“You bet your sweet arse I would,” Draco shoots back.
“Do you think he’s through?” She asks me.
[Colourful Christmas lights on the floor]
*~*~*~
I drawn out of the depths of my mind by sunlight hitting my face. The warmth and glow of it puts a smile on my face, and I meander over to Honeydukes. Before entering, I steal a glance through the window and happily sigh as I see the shelves of sweets. Wrapping my hand around the brass door knob, I push the door in and step inside the shop.
of the house, not further into it. He decides that his search has to go ahead regardless. He
“How come?” My voice is steady with a hint of judgemental.
Harry nods. “That’s not all though.”
here, they live in the forest. It’s a perfectly safe place for a wizard to be.
Draco isn’t sure what they’re going to talk about. It’s obvious that there’s still no way to leave. They haven’t made any connections, just gathered enough information that they should be
After a while of pushing through branches and trudging through snow that somehow managed to get beyond the thick canopy, Draco finally sees an end to the trees. He scrambles to get there as quickly as possible, nearly tripping over roots and small bushes multiple times. There’s a little pocket where the tree line dips in, but the trees never start back up again. Instead, Draco finds that he has a clear view of a little village. He smiles faintly to himself, glad to have found some form of other people. Potter must have been wrong when he said there wasn’t anything nearby. That, or the less pleasurable thought that he hid information like this from Draco. He hopes for Potter’s sake it’s the former.
The walk to the courtyard seems to take forever. Despite the grey sky, it doesn’t rain. Draco turns to Potter, watches as he hops over a fallen log. He shakes his head, amused at how childlike Potter can be sometimes.
This whole time, I have been growing steadily closer to Harry. Developing feelings I’ve never felt before, and here he goes saying it’s ‘nothing personal’. I take a step away and nod rapidly.
Sorry that this was a little late... I got caught up in real life😅 Anyway, I made myself a tumblr! It’s just “devilrising” so come follow me!
“Well I
Even in my tired stupor, I still find the energy to slap him. “Do not repeat that ever again.”
“Not that! I thought you were supposed to be clever Malfoy…” The last is mumbled, but I heard it none the less. “He has been spending all his free time with you! Turning us down because he has to ‘go study for DADA’ or ‘help Malfoy with the party’. I’m sick of it! I’m sick of you wasting his time!”
“Great idea,” Potter agrees, already drawing up a twelfth bubble.
I should’ve stayed at his house. I am not used to being out in public, people swarming everywhere. If it was muggle London again it probably would’ve been fine, but no. We are in Diagon fucking Alley. I curse under my breath as soon as I recognise the cobbled streets and exotic displays in the windows.
“Everyone, organise yourselves into your ranks! We will be leaving shortly!” Harry’s amplified voice rings out over the crowd, and everyone stares for a second. Then they start moving all at once. People gather their belongings and cross the ground, arranging themselves into an order I don’t understand. Realising that I have to move at some point as well, I charm the tray to float above my head and make my way over to Harry.
“Any pain?”
Harry scowls. “There
,” Draco whines. “Come on!”
“Hello. I’m Draco Malfoy, pleased to meet you. And you are…?”
Draco grins at him in thanks, pours himself another cup of coffee, and instantly tucks into his breakfast. He hears Harry tut to himself and leave the kitchen, no doubt to flop back onto the sofa.
“Bed,” he repeats, grabbing Harry’s hand and hauling him along. Harry’s heart races as they run down the corridor, jogging into the bedroom and slamming the door shut. He hears Draco lock it automatically, before he’s being pushed to the mattress.
even. No. We are crashing the Unspeakables’ department.
“I’m lucky it’s still there, according to my MediWitches,” Harry says. “But I can’t feel it right now, so… okay?” He laughs softly.
The man smiles, white teeth making an appearance between dark lips. “About?”
friends too, did this! There’s no way he should look so happy. Yet he does, and Harry doesn’t know which reaction is right. He struggles with anger he hadn’t even realised he felt at the people he’s called friends for half his life. He’s been through a war with them! He thought they had his back!
Harry’s eyes bulge out of his head. “That’s ridiculous! No way that’s true Malfoy.”
Once they finish their food—which doesn’t take long, considering they’ve both been busy all afternoon and have worked up a large appetite—the bowls are sent to the kitchen to be dealt with later, and they relax back on the sofa. Harry rests against him, making no pretence in his affection. Draco thinks he might go to sleep there, using him as a cushion. He wouldn’t complain too much, Harry isn’t exactly
I force myself not to chuckle at how easy it was. It won’t be that easy soon. Grim, I decide to play it safe. Focus on not being caught, instead of on showcasing my new abilities. A footstep sounds to my right and, without thinking, I turn the lighting up. I am instantly blinded, and only then remember my focus.
She narrows her eyes. “I’m not quite sure I believe that, Harry.” There’s a look on her face, a look that doesn’t bode well for Harry at all. Thankfully, Ron chooses this moment to join them, pressing a loud kiss to the side of Hermione’s head. Harry grimaces slightly, simultaneously wishing he had someone to do that with him and that the couple in front of him would get a room.
He feels a pang of sadness, erasing the evidence he was ever there, but knows it’s the right thing to do. Harry doesn’t want to walk around with Draco’s mouth evident across his skin. The bruises were bright red, standing out against his dark skin, and Draco wants to mark him up again immediately after he’s removed them. But he won’t. He’s in his right mind now, he knows what he did was wrong, and he only wants to do it again if Harry does too.
Potter. Harry Potter is sleeping next to him, their chests touching and legs entwined on the sofa. Draco’s heart stops, his breathing pausing as he takes it in. Potter’s hair is a mess, draped over his forehead and sticking up in odd angles. His face is relaxed though, features smooth and breaths even in sleep. He lets out a soft sound as Draco pulls further away, fully intending to slip away and tiptoe into the bed.
Draco sighs, pushing the cup away so he can’t use it to ignore Harry. “The day I fell into the hole? I left you a note on some weird, yellow, square paper. It’s just… really similar to what our waitress just used. That’s all.”
next to a false accusation? How did he end up sharing his bed with Harry fucking Potter last night, when they were always bitter enemies? That’s when it hits him.
“I hate you!” Draco says with a huff as he catches up. He bends forward, hands on his knees, and catches his breath.
“Are you in trouble?”
“Enough boys. If you two can’t get along then I’ll just make you do more things together until you can!” Falco’s voice cuts through our quick fight, leaving me staring exasperatedly at her and Potter.
I swallow hard, wondering where on earth to start. Eventually I settle on unwrapping the glamours around my wings. I didn’t even know they were in place until I had to remove them. Harry must have set them up, so as not to bombard Mother when she has just woken again. I wait, my nerves digging into my heart and clawing at me. As I feel the first brush of air against my feathers, Mother gasps. Unfortunately, I also hear the sound of fabric ripping open.
Harry hums his response and walks over to the kitchen. He isn’t sure what he wants for breakfast, just that he wants it quickly. His eyes rove over the contents of the fridge and pantry. There’s not much there, and Harry finds himself wishing for Molly’s cooking. He craves something homemade by someone other than him, and even though Draco is cooking too, it’s not quite the same as a Weasley meal.
Harry dips his tongue into the slit, lifting up the precome. Draco keens as he does, the tip of his cock extremely sensitive. Harry moans around it and slides down further, sucking as much of his cock into his mouth as he can. He relaxes his throat and wraps his tongue around it, before slowly pulling up. Harry sets a steady pace, his hands on Draco’s hips to stop him thrusting into it. It feels amazing, his cock the perfect weight against his tongue. Harry groans, making Draco’s breath catch in his throat.
Harry laughs, his heart flying each time Draco uses his given name. He wants to, he really does. He’d love to wake up pressed against Draco, slotted together. But it’s… it’s a bit early. They’ve only just confessed their feelings, and yes they’ve spent all day snogging, but Harry wants to separate things just a little bit. “Not tonight Draco,” he says, explaining his reasoning.
Harry wants to curse Filch to a million shreds for putting him with
“Salazar Slytherin,” Potter cuts in. I shoot him a glare. That wasn’t at all what I thought we were doing here.
“At all?!”
Harry walks closer and holds my upper arms to my body. “I like you, you absolute prick.” He stares right into my eyes, and I feel like the earth is going to swallow me.
, but his brain short circuits before he can get there.
,” she pointedly explains. Harry rushes to accept and let’s her into the house, ignoring her comment. She swiftly sits down in one of the vacant arm chairs, pulling out a notepad and muggle quill from who-knows-where. A look is sent to Harry, and I follow her gaze. He hurries to turn from my view, but I see a spot of red on his cheeks. I don’t know why, but it makes me slightly dizzy.
“I don’t know,” Harry pants, shaking his head.
Harry feels his eyes widen at the honest answer, and he avoids Malfoy’s gaze. “That’s, lovely.”
“Hmm?”
Draco bites back a moan. He loves having his hair played with, and the pressure on his head is just perfect. “What happened?” His voice is scratchy and sore as he speaks.
Harry hums, and they walk in comfortable silence.
Potter smiles, a gentle lift of the corners of his soft-looking mouth. “Well, goodnight then. If you need potions to sleep there should be some in the bathroom.”
As Harry reaches the kitchen, he settles on pumpkin. It’s what his friends would have made him if he was with them, and he needs anything he can get to remind him of them. So he pulls out bowls and pots, and begins chopping things up as best he can without dislodging the blankets around his shoulders.
“A bookstore.”
He aims spell after spell at it, but they all come back negative. It is obvious that nothing has been changed on the cabinet itself, so it must be the actual magic that is different and not the wood. Hmm. That takes quite a bit of skill. The more diagnostic spells return and say that nothing’s wrong, the more Draco starts thinking that it’s bullshit. The person who lost their hair must have been hexed or something at the same time. But… Potter found it. He probably saw the victim’s hair fall out. He has to ask.
I smile to myself at her casual approval of Harry, and redress quickly. After spelling the clothes to fit over my wings without tearing them—any more than they already are—I sit back down in the armchair and look at my mother.
“How come?” His forehead creases and his eyes go muddy.
Harry chuckles, shaking his head with a soft smile. “If you say so.”
The walk to wherever it is we are going is draining. Having not left the house in a while, I blink a couple of times at the street in front of me. Somehow, I forgot where we are. I forgot that I am staying with Harry Potter, in a dingy street in muggle London. I worry about my appearance. But not in the way I would’ve used to. It’s not the vain, arrogant concern I had earlier this year, but rather being terrified of standing out. If someone caught a glimpse of my white-blond hair, or the distasteful and regretful tattoo inked across my arm, I would be in trouble. But as we pass an abandoned house with the windows still in tact, I glimpse my reflection. Somehow, I had managed to forget that I am covered head to toe in Glamours. Forgot that my platinum hair is now strawberry blonde, and that my tattoo is invisible underneath red skin.
When there is no reply, he turns to face Potter. His eyebrows have risen into his fringe. He really needs a haircut. He also needs to dry the drips of water trailing down his neck and below his collar. Potter shakes his head and runs a hand through his too-long hair. “I’ve already tried, there isn’t anything.”
“Oh fuck,” Draco sighs as a shiver runs through him. Potter’s hand is warm and confident as he holds them both and sharply jerks them.
‘Mr. Malfoy has been relocated to another ward for his recovery. Do not follow up on his injuries, and mention him to no one.’
“And if he knows I
A bowl of nice, warm soup flashes behind his eyelids, and Harry could jump for joy. Soup! Why hadn’t he thought of that sooner? He slowly shifts his weight, unwilling to lose his blanket cocoon. He tightens his grip around it, knuckles going white and then red from the cold. Harry suppresses another shiver and stands up, feet hitting the floor. Pins and needles fill them, and Harry wants to scream at the fact his
Harry swallows, his Adam’s apple bobbing. Draco tears his eyes away, pulling them back up to Harry’s face. He nods slowly, gaze intent on Draco. His eyes drop slightly, landing on Draco’s mouth. Draco licks his lips subconsciously, and then realises the gravity of the action. He looks away.
“Har-”
“Draco,” Harry says from the front, gathering our attention once again. “That was really good!” He leaves time for the other two to cheer and whoop, and I feel my blush deepening. “However,” his voice cuts through the room, “you have raised a lot of questions that I would like to have an answer for before Saturday.”
He sits Draco down tells him everything. About their friends’ abuse of their combined power; Ron, Hermione, Seamus, Dean, Luna, Neville, Zabini, Parkinson, Nott, Robards, and Draco’s work partner all have jobs and skills that make them an indestructible force.
“What do you want, Potter?”
Granger is gobsmacked. “That’s amazing. I’ll need you to tell me about that spell later.” She makes a scribble at the bottom of her page. “So you’re saying, that if we hypothetically shrunk someone down, and somehow got them through the wards, that there’d be a direct route into your bedroom?”
“Okay, thanks!”
“No. Ron, Hermione, and I are all out.” He pauses, and a devilish grin covers his face. “And to save the world, of course.”
PS: My tumblr is “devilrising” if you want to see exclusive fics. I post Drarry OneShots on there weekly!
Draco’s eyes open a crack and he looks at the canvas. His breathing starts again, picking back up into a normal rhythm. His heart begins beating again and he releases a relieved breath.
Draco pulls away, head tilting to the side. “I had it last night.”
“Don’t be,” Potter says. “We weren’t right for each other. She’s also bi, by the way. So the relationship could have been salvaged but neither of us wanted to. We both kind of realised that she was there for the wrong reason, and we both preferred trying to find actual love than staying unhappy.”
“Fine, I’ll stop,” Harry gives in. He could never stand seeing Malfoy so visibly upset or temperamental. Not that he’d tell anyone; or that he really understands why himself.
to shock Harry just as much. Harry is evidently caught off guard, having to think on his answer for a while. Draco feels like he shouldn’t have asked, and should of just let them sleep, when Harry finishes chewing his cheek and responds.
“Of course! I’ve worked with you for what, three years? All that time, you’ve been trying to become a better person, to let your past remain there.” Harry allows himself to think. “You aren’t a bad person Malfoy.”
“Sure there was,” Potter mutters so quietly Draco isn’t sure that he didn’t imagine it. “Do you want me to brief you?”
I blush furiously for absolutely no reason at all. “It’s
It’s bitterly cold outside, a gentle breeze carrying snow and ice. Harry is rugged up in his coat, hands shoved deep inside his pockets. Beneath the navy coat he
Harry bites back a chuckle. “We’re in the front together, just stay close to me and that’s all you need to know.”
*~*~*~
“Oh! I forgot! I was going to tell you something,” Potter rushes, evidently trying to distract Draco from himself. “There’s a Vanishing Cabinet in a town on the other side of the forest. I was going to bring it up a few days ago but I kept forgetting.”
Draco licks his lips, tongue swiping along them subconsciously. Harry grunts at the sight, dragging Draco in and pressing their mouths together. He kisses him slowly, his lips gentle on Draco’s. His hands slide into Draco’s hair, tugging it gently to angle his head. Draco moans into the kiss, and Harry takes advantage of it, nudging his tongue into the opening. Draco groans, his tongue meeting Harry’s. He sucks on it, sliding them together. His mouth is warm and soft, addictive in every way. It tastes like him, Draco’s own flavour standing out even among the coffee.
“Why did you choose Salazar of all things?”
a while back.”
“Oh, and Malfoy?”
Harry pulls Draco to him, murmurs nonsense into his ear and runs his hand through silky blond hair. Draco is gorgeous, it’s a pity he doesn’t really see it himself.
Potter still lives with that awful group of lowly Weasley’s, he has brand new robes and equipment just like every year, and his life is still splattered across all the magazines and papers. Whereas for me, not a thing has stayed the same. My father is in Azkaban for his crimes, and my mother is destined to spend the rest of her sad life locked up in St Mungos, battling a whole range of weird things. I am the only one living at Malfoy Manor, not that I spend much time there as it is. I can’t stand the deafening silence of the rooms, how it drowns you in your own loneliness. The ever present cold that drifts in from the walls chills me to the bones, giving me a gnawing feeling of abandonment.
“If I knew at some point I don’t remember now. It’s definitely in the first week though.” I recall something about it being planned for April, but having to be moved. I think. Replaying that to Granger, I watch as Potter stands and stretches. His muggle shirt lifts and a sliver of stomach is revealed above his jean’s waist. I tear my eyes away, but not before he notices. Fuck. I’ve become slightly addicted to seeing things like that in this past week. Just accidental clothing movement, each time revealing a little bit more skin than is usually visible. And he’s become quite good at catching me. At least he never brings it up.
is that now he can
Harry pulls away, moving back to kiss Draco fiercely. He immediately slides his tongue into Draco’s mouth, between his lips. Draco moans, sucking it.
Draco harrumphs at him.
Ron pumps a fist in silent applause. “If that means I don’t have to read a bunch of shit I don’t understand, then yes!”
Harry’s lips move up and down his jaw, nibble at his ear. He swirls his tongue over the spot between his ear and jaw, nosing into his hair. His tongue drags down his neck, licking over his throat. Draco’s hands twitch, desperately wanting to hold onto Harry’s head. Harry kisses his Adam’s apple, lips moving over it as he swallows. He licks down the side, teeth scraping gently over bruises left from yesterday. Draco can’t bite back his moan.
The list of offenders is now complete: Blaise, Pansy, Theodore, Weasley, Granger, Thomas, Finnigan, Lovegood, Longbottom, Robards, and Alex. Alex is, of course, Draco’s work partner. They’ll need to be having some serious words when he gets back to London.
“Says the man who was literally just kissing my arse,” Draco retorts, clearly beyond caring about Harry’s ‘rules’.
“Not the time, Blaise,” Ron murmurs from where he’s standing with Hermione next to the fireplace. Ron may be bisexual, and therefore meets the criteria to join the game, but there’s no way he’d look at anyone else now he’s with Hermione. The two are nausea inducing, and Harry loves them.
“Well…?”
“Ron!” Hermione scolds her boyfriend. For what, Harry isn’t quite sure. Realising that he’s been zoned out for who-knows-how-long, he focuses back into the conversation.
“Well, no—”
Malfoy seems to recover himself and realises Harry’s struggle, grabbing for the bags. He juggles them all for a second before straightening up. Harry groans in relief and slides the remainder of the bags down to his hands and off his forearms. Thick coat or not, that hurt.
Draco’s eyes widen and he looks down at himself, blushing furiously when he realises he
as he enters the warmth of the cottage. Draco shuts the door and sighs, glad to not be facing the cold and snow anymore. Without anything more than a grunt to Draco, Potter shrugs his coat off and makes for the bathroom. It seems like they’ve both bathed twice today. It’s funny how the world works. Sometimes, Draco feels like his and Potter’s lives are parallel to each other. The war makes up a big stretch of it, but then it’s little things like having the same alteration in a daily routine. They both normally shower in the morning, but today they’ve both also had a bath in the evening—if the sound of water hitting porcelain is accurate, at least.
"Of course I do. Did you really think that me relinquishing him was really an option in the debate?" He dragged out the 'really' to make his point. Sam laughed again. Since he was doing it so often, it started to unnerve Draco. "Anyway, when am I being allowed the liberty to leave? It really is fucking awful here."
They walked in utter silence, the type that was appreciated but awkward. Grey trotted alongside them, glaring at anything and everything that moved, most of which seemed to enchanted paintings who remarked rudely upon the appearance of such a creature in muttered tones. Draco hoped Lupin didn't hear, and by the look of him, he didn't.
I'm also writing my 36 questions fic, which means that I'm jumping between each fic, (this is actually funny because I have like two chapters that date back to the seventeenth, lmao)
"You're both unbelievable. I had to learn that you got out through the prophet. The fucking
"Harry?" His dad asked
"Yes that would be fine, thank you." Sam nodded, and with a crack, he disapperated. Draco let out a large sigh and rubbed his face with a hand wearily. He wanted to take a long bath and sleep in his own bed for twenty hours. Grey kindly reminded him that, no, that was not going to happen.
Also - Thank you all so much for 480 hits! WOW! I just wrote this because the au was in my head for far to long and my brother told me to just 'quit being a pussy and post it' so thank you all so much for the support! This is my favourite drarry au, and will probably be the longest, but I will be posting other drarry stories when I can, because I have a few in the works. There will also, at some point, be a marauders era wolfstar fic, because it's a commission for my wonderful friend! Again, THANK YOU SO MUCH!!
"I'm quite fine, mother." he managed between choking fits of laughter, though he didn't quite feel out of breath. He didn't know what he felt.
"How do you know he didn't eat much?" It was the velvety voice and sounded perplexed. Draco couldn't focus on anything, on who these people were, and, with deep rooted panic, who he was.
"Draco-" Blaise's voice said, urgent and loud in his ear, so loud. Wasn't he hungover?
The door opened to his dad wearing a dressing gown and bleary look, his mum behind him accompanied by his Godfather's.
Draco had been many things for many people, too many things to list. But now, now as his world shattered around him, he was allowed to be selfish. He took a single glass out of the top cupboard an hurled it with all his might at the wall, screaming. He then felt his knees buckle, and he screamed and cried into his hoodie to the sound of raining glass.
At the end of the week, just as he had promised, Lucius took Draco to go and meet Narcissa for the first time. Draco had been living of the highs of joy, as if nothing could dull the shine in his eyes. Only Lucius called him Draco so far, though he had told them his name was going to change from Nikolai. Lucius had shown up, immaculate as ever, and Draco had put on the new clothes that had been bought for him and were 'more fitting  for a Malfoy'.
Draco had only seen chaos like this in the war. He found it hard to breathe. Its just, there were so many people, they were all fighting, there were people screaming, and there were children here, because how were they supposed to know any better?
Grey's muzzle was warm and matted under his long fingers, and Draco could feel the warm puffs of breath down his arms. There was muttering behind him, scandalised yelling, but all he could allow himself to focus on was Grey. He would prove his worth yet. Sam started laughing behind him.
"Naturally. His mother was, but I do believe it will work in our favour; he's even more powerful, incredibly rare and quite the asset." Narcissa snapped. It was the angriest Draco had ever seen her. In fact, he thought, it was probably the only time he had seen her angry, truly. She grabbed Draco's shoulder an thrust him roughly to the side, striding up to Lucius with a fire blazing in her eyes. She began to scream at him. Being a child of six, Draco found the whole scene, quite frankly, upsetting. He wasn't that sensitive anymore. He covered his ears and shrank himself on the floor where he had been thrown and cried as Narcissa screamed at Lucius. Lucius, however did not scream back. Draco wasn't that unknowledgeable, he had seen people scream at each other before, but it was always at each other. Lucius returned angrily, but he maintained his cool the best Draco had ever seen.
"Well go on." Draco prompted, pointing at the bath. Grey muttered something under his breath that might have been 'twat', but got in anyhow. Draco moved to perch on the tiles at the side of bath. The green window let through dim September sunlight that dappled both of their features in a pretty way, the kind that people took photos of. Grey sat obediently in the water, straight backed an still, hands waving through the green and bubbles, flicking up droplets of warmth.
"I'm sorry!" he screamed to the rain, steady English script. "I didn't want them to die!" He paused for heaving breaths that didn't match the pace of his heart. "Я бы хотел умереть вместо этого!"
"Ask if you may have someone over, mother." He said at the door, with his bags packed and Grey waiting a little further down for him. Narcissa smiled graciously. She did that a lot nowadays.
"Well then. I've an hour before lunch, so would it be agreeable for me to be allowed to unpack in my dorm?" Draco drawled, posh and without a trace of the fact he had just told someone something he was never supposed to say, not to anyone under 'pain of death'. Fat chance he'd be offed though with Lucius in Azkaban. Looked like offing himself was something he had to himself, not that he particularly minded. Things happen. He had an image of the dorm room he would be in; he was aware that the eight years got their own common room and dorms. He supposed it would be quite nice, just him and Blaise in a small room at the top of some tower. The jokes they could make.
He ignored the knock. He seated himself in kitchen, becuase in the inexplicable way that all drugs seemed to work for him, he wanted to see the damage. To see the blood. Any blood, really. He wasn't particularly fussed. Unwrapping the bandages seemed only to satisfy himself, because with the peeling of the white came the dripping of the red.
I'm so sorry that this took so long to come out, I've been really busy (hating my life) and have also just posted a new fic called 'wine bottles and smashed glasses' based on the musical 36 questions, so please do go check that out if you're interested!
"They said they were looking for someone by the name of Draco Malfoy, and they had a photo of you." He was glaring menacingly at Aidan now, in the feeble hopes that that would make him face Harry.
"So, what did you think of the common room and dorms?" Blaise asked as they walked on up the staircases.
"The one where a lot of accompanying personals ended up dead? The... Mystery striker was it?"
"Ah." Draco said again. His hands shook. Grey looked terrified, and stuck its head through the gap in the bars, throwing it around. Draco took its head in his hands and stroked it gently. He hummed, more to himself than anything really, a song he remembered from Russia, a haunting melody that accompanied his dreams at night.
It was around three o'clock in the afternoon when Harry's letter (and parcel) arrived at the manor. Both Grey and Draco had managed to finish all of their tasks early, making lunch an easy affair that was this time hosted in Draco's parlour in front of a young fire. Upon seeing the owl, Draco had set down his plate and excused himself to the privacy of his own bedroom to read the letter.
But living humans didn't move like that. Nor did the veelas.
"Fine. You'll have to side-along me though, because I don't have a wand." He said it as pointedly as he possibly could manage, and luckily, Sam got the hint.
His head disappeared beneath the water.
Ok, SO
A little more organised this time, and happy new years! I have to say, after the shit show of 2020, I don't know how much worse it can get, but I'm hoping for a brighter year. (despite this, I have really stepped up my funeral wear game, so I'm prepared in any scenario.)
"Oh honey," She said rubbing his back as he looked wistfully at the ground. "He just feels betrayed. Listen, I can tell you where he is, if you want to make up with him." She offered, turning to face him with a smile. Draco couldn't stop himself. He wrapped his arms around her a held tightly. It wasn't for a while that he realised he was crying. She murmered quiet words of comfort into his ears as he sobbed. "You know," She laughed. "This is the second twenty two year old I've had crying in my arms in two weeks." For a brief, stupid second, Draco was absolutely stumped.
"No, it's nicer black, though if you were to get green highlights I wouldn't stop you." Draco said, taking another sip of red wine. "Anyway, dorm management. How's it going for you, Pansy darling? Heard you got thrown in with Granger." Pansy sighed dramatically, takin her turn to sip the wine.
"You haven't answered my question." Lupin said, measured and cool, not  a hint of annoyance.
"You all just have no appreciation for humour. Right, then, are we leaving this alone, or am I going to have to wipe some memories?" Ron blanches, as if he really would do it, and Harry rolls his eyes.
"I don't know who they were, darling! I promise!" He sounded like he was begging. He walked forwards more, and that was when Harry realised what was making the crunching sound. Aidan hadn't picked up the chattered champagne and he wasn't wearing socks. Blood was sweeping over the tiled floor. Harry hadn't the energy or the mental capacity to deal with it.
Everything still seemed slow and heavy, like waking up after sleeping for too long. The type where you only just manage to drag yourself out of the bed, even though you want to stay in the warm embrace of the bed longer. Draco looked upon death with fond admiration; he had no reason to fear it, and left the cold skeletal fingers that held him. It was easier the second time, he realised somewhere in his psyche.
"Please take me there."
"Don't you have a lake?" Grey asked. He turned his head so that his body was facing Draco. He had been made to sit on a foot stool (a comfortable one) because Draco was not sitting on his bed and braiding hair like eleven year old girls.
"Really?" Grey raised an eyebrow.
Suddenly it was a week earlier and he was holding himself steady in the shards of glass. His feet hurt. He moaned and wept, but no one heard him. He fancied no one ever properly would.
Serenity: The goal of meditation, where you reach perfect peace and calmness of the mind. He was eight when he tied this word to something. Serenity looked white to him, fresh fallen snow that glinted in the weak sunlight and blinded him in its purity. The stark contrast between the plumage of a peacock and the deep white. He wanted to sink into it, to let it consume him.
Ah, he thought to himself as the previous night's events came back to him in a haze of alcohol. Drunk sex was something he knew very well, despite his insistence that it would not happen again. He always got to this point, but it was fine. He hated himself enough to let it happen, so it didn't matter all that much.
"You sure I can't say anything stupid?" Harry whispered into Draco's lips. Draco pushed into him gently with long delicate fingers that wove themselves through Harry's thick hair, the other hand against the hard of his chest.
He was, of course, welcomed gracefully, because he was not loud or drunk, nor was he far to old, and, in fact, many of the girls there didn't mind fancying him. The large sums of money also helped him get through, letting his name only be muttered in the quieter corners of the room.
"The first time?" Lupin asked.
"Don't be so dramatic," Blaise snarked whilst watching a small trickle of people leaving the halls, mainly just the second and third years. "Right then, are we leaving and getting our shit together?" Of course, Draco had barely eaten, but he made sure that it was known he was finished. Pansy and Blaise were nearly done once he had arrived so fashionably late, so it worked.
And so the path of action had been paved. All the papers, the internet, would know is that the incredibly rich carriers of the Malfoy name had found their son crying in a small flat in London, upon seeing which, they had immediately taken him home, comforting him whilst he cried into their arms. If Draco weren't as fearful for torture or had more foresight whilst not being high, he probably would have made himself be dragged, kicking and screaming.
Grey, he had also decided, needed a room and clothes, but he was so far unable to obtain either. He left the bathroom with a sigh and his own clothes to let Grey dry himself and change. There were so far plenty of drying charms, but Draco was sure that Grey would weasel his way put of it and beg for Draco to dry his hair. Well, beg was a strong word, but Draco was sure he would end up seated somewhere in his own parlour combing through Grey's long hair.
"As the only male Slytherins, I had the idea me and Blaise would be sharing." He said, not liking where this was going. He doubted he could get through the year without Blaise being in the same room.
"Not mine, I'm afraid. You know how to use a portkey, I'm assuming?" Draco gave him a clear look, but otherwise did not answer. The silence was short but awkward. Draco looked at Grey who effectively told him that it was his fault. Draco did not disagree with this assessment.
They did, of course win after about a fifteen minute chase. They were aurors, after all, and these people were only smugglers and vendors. Not skilled, not against them. They were all arrested, tied and bound with magic cords that held them in place.
"Draco, I'll need to borrow you for a bit, just for a chat, so I'm afraid you'll have to wait till lunch to see your friends." Lupin said, moving round to the back of his desk and seating himself, gesturing for Draco to do the same. He let his bags drop to the floor and walked to one of the chairs in front of the desk. It was clean and comfortable, somewhat reminisce of a Victorian style of fashion.
Grey strode over the surface to where the body lay, thrust up by the current. Draco, he realised, was beautiful. Even in this state, his skin glowed akin to the moon, lighting the fragile water that lapped around him and illuminating his features in eerily alluring ways. The sharp jut of his cheek bones seemed sharper, his cheeks gaunter than they ought to be, but even this underweight seemed to suit him well in a morbid beauty.
"I recon he ought to be able to keep the kelpie." He said. Of course Sam was high up, but Draco really doubted it was 'forgive the death eater his murders and past ailments; instead we'll give him a muggle eating creature, because why shouldn't he have one?' It retrospect, it had been a shitty idea. Hindsight, his father had said, is the worst sight. An uproar went out behind them and it was loud. Draco wanted to cover his ears. He glamoured his eyes again, letting them slip to the grey of the steel bars.
"Mother." He returned, inclining her head. The cell door was opened so that they might be allowed to touch each other. Draco walked over to where Narcissa sat and set himself down  beside her. She was shaking. He put an arm around her shoulders and she lay her head across his own shoulder, one arm on his back.
He probably would have cried, but he was high and ignorant to the feelings of depression. That's why he loved it, see.
"If we had to re-locate every time this happened, I'm sure we'd be forever on the run." He muttered into the soft skin, and Pansy made a non-committal sound of agreement.
"He's a half breed." Narcissa said, voice still somehow even.
"Even if I was into guys, I have
"Draco." Grey said again, rougher this time. He knew people weren't really supposed to be out in cold rain for long periods of time, especially when floating in lakes. He touched Draco's skin. It was ice cold beneath his fingers. Somewhere, he thought if this was what the humans were like before he killed them. His loose morals slipped away.
Draco did not write back to Harry that evening.
"Draco." She said. Her voice was even as ever, and she met his gaze steadily. There was no waver in her voice, but he could tell she was deeply disturbed.
"It's Narcissa." The voice called. Draco let his eyes close again. At least he was lying the right way on the bed this time.
He strode down the elegant pathways, and it felt like he was being funnelled down toward his doom by the high bushes. A grey cat emerged from one of the bushes and trotted alongside him, a cat Draco recognised as a Russian blue, purely because of a cat obsession that Pansy had gone through in forth year. His stomach dropped as he left the grounds of Malfoy manor, becuase standing there at the designated collection point was no other than Remus Lupin.
"Time to go. We're told you can find it, so you're going to accompany us." His voice was rough and gravely, but not cruel sounding. Draco hoped that his mother had been treated well under him. There was no real space for the 'I love yous' that were exchanged under quiet confidentiality, but they were said anyway. He was pleased to see that the dementors made no move to grab and drag his mother, and that she walked with an air of grace and dignity that none of the other prisoners had.
"Who else is in the room?" He asked after a moment of deliberation and calculations. He really didn't like where they were getting him.
The world span. Draco curled in on himself, clutching at his throat and gasping. His head hurt. His mouth tasted metallic, it tasted like blood. The rain poured on, and so did his stream of conscious. He switched from a feverish murmuring of English to the rambling, screaming syllables of Russian, but the meaning was always the same.
"You would be correct in thinking so. All taken by Hogwarts for the kitchens, I belive." He responded, inspecting a nail bed. "Would you like to run a bath and get clean? I can cook." Narcissa smiled with warm politeness, the closest to a real smile she could get.
He had been seated on a bench, letting the sun and warm breeze tickle his face, letting the other noises fade into the background. It was a warm July, the proper kind of summer that one would fantasize about.
Angst! Just when you thought you were safe! Tw for panic attacks and suicide - please don't read if you are uncomfortable with either of those. This chapter is quite short, but that's because there is more to come tonight!
He stared with dead eyes at the wall in front of him. He really wished he had had the foresight to throw himself off the bridge in the battle, lest he be left to rot here. (he was being dramatic. He had only been in Azkaban for a week.) He was sure he had lost more weight than was healthy for someone of seventeen, but he really couldn’t bring himself to care. In the miserable cell he was in, he really couldn’t bring himself to do much at all, really.
"You know you can't tell people you have a pet kelpie." He said. Draco raised an eyebrow.
The room to was nicer than he expected. It was spacious and tall, high ceilings sheltering the four poster beds which were arranged in a sort of square, on in each corner. The two on the right side had been taken, clearly by Weasley and Harry with the amount of red and gold that hung off them. The one in left corner with the window view was the only one that had yet to be claimed, by the looks of it, though the curtains were drawn. Grey was taking in the sights of the room, wandering about it before setting down the luggage next to the vacant bed.
Quite how he found himself in his next dilemma, he was unsure of. He was dressed hurriedly but well, a long cloak fastened at the base of his neck, the large jewel sitting there comfortably and cold, as the feel of metal against skin often is. He was standing at the top of the stairs, that he knew, but how he got there feigned mystery, for he could not think through the panic. Someone was screaming. He clutched his ears hoping to block out the sound, but instead it grew louder, shriller. He ran to escape the sound, but poor judgment and the dizzying fear that gripped him clouded his vision, and he fell before he was barely halfway down.
Draco Malfoy had not always been Draco Malfoy. He had once been someone very different. He had once been a boy named Nikolai Lebedev, son to a Russian whore and raised in a brothel. Some may argue that it would not have been the proper way to bring up a child, but Draco would argue that they were the happiest years of his life.
"Draco, darling," Blaise said, in the tone he used when he wanted something, wanted something specific. Overly posh in the way he always talked, with the trace of a slight whine that Pansy often used. "I want something."
"Yes. Just tap your wand a few times and away you go." He muttered sarcastically, loud enough so that they all could hear.
"My other wand?" He asked expectantly. Sam just stared at him. "Oh for fucks- If I were allowed a wand, would you give it to me?" Sam nodded dubiously. "Perfect." Draco seethed. "Now, I don't particularly want to spend another second here, so if you would be so kind as to let me home, I'm sure that I would be positively amicable." Grey also seemed rather unhappy at the prospect of being called a pet, but kept his anger in check. Draco felt very fortunate, or rather, lucky that his own stupidity was not leading to drastic consequences. He also feared that it would soon let up.
It was pretty down here, a serene escape that he had often utilised in times of need and desperate longing to get away from the house, though, he had nothing to shield himself with down here, only the huge expanse of a black lake. The grass kept crunching, getting louder and louder until somewhere in his mind he realised that there was someone walking towards him.
treating you well, then." Draco joked. Blaise smirked at him and shook his head.
"Oh, you know me so well." Draco reached through the curtains, drawing them back slowly, slipping out and not even wincing when the cold stone met his feet. On Blaise's desk was only one roll of parchment, so Draco took that to be it and nabbed it. "Alright, want me to read this to you?" He asked once back inside the safety and warmth of the bed's curtains.
And so he did, in every details other than the gory ones. He told Lupin of his triumphs, not of his downfalls, the glory an beauty that came with being a veela, not the kidnapping and selling of a few organs. (He hadn't really lost any, but they were more than glad to hand them off.) And after it all, he had shocked Lupin to silence and meandered on for so long that he had almost used up all of his time. (He kept getting distracted by Grey who would occasional wander round and break things, much to Lupin's dismay. )
"If I were still allowed to be the high witch, they'd have a lot more to talk about." She professed to them, looking at the books as though she was trying to discern which ones would be actually interesting. Blaise and Draco exchanged a smirking look, Blaise's hand knocking gently against the side of her head as she gazed half heartedly at the books, causing her to look up at the pair of them, an 'I-know-something' cat look on her face.
Sorry that I've been really busy this week, I honestly wasn't expecting it, which led to the late release of this!
"Come along, Draco." He called without turning around, like he knew Draco would follow him. As Draco began to uncurl himself, Lucius left the room through a large door angled at the back of the large entrance hall. He could still hear Narcissa's quiet sobs from where she lay, draped gracefully across the floor, face buried into the crook of her elbow. Draco's cheeks were wet with frightened tears, but he wiped them away and ran as gracefully as he could towards his father's disappearing footsteps.
"Of course." Draco responded.
"Well, I know that he's in Slytherin." She said, a knowing smile on the reaction that this would provoke. Blaise looked even more intrigued and ruffled her hair.
They had side-a-longed to the outside of an expensive looking manor, and it had been the first time Draco had really seen the extent of his new wealth. Lucius had taken his hand and led them to the grand oak door, which Draco remembered purely because it was the largest door he had ever seen at that point in his life. It no longer seemed very big to him. He had let Lucius go ahead in front of him, for he was scared of what may lie on the other side of the door. He was right to be.
The first time he had died, he had been painfully aware of it, but he hadn't panicked, and he hadn't been panicking. It wasn't quite calm, either. This time, nothing came to him. It was too cold to think. He didn't remember closing his eyes, but after all, he hadn't. They were still open and faced to the sky, pure gems in the tragedy of youth.
"Blaise, are you around?" It was a stupid question, because he had heard Blaise laugh earlier, but politeness was a valued trait. The curtain drew back to reveal a yawning Blaise, rubbing his eye with his free hand.
"Mr. Malfoy." An older auror said, walking up to him from the group that was preparing. There were at least fifty, Draco noted. He nodded back at the man. "Your services, I'm sure, Will be invaluable." It was said with withheld rage. Draco was sure the man would very much like to slap him.
"How far now?" He asked as Draco sidestepped a holly bush. Draco nodded at a tree in front of them, forcing Sam's eyes to flicker away.
"Mother, welcome back." He said graciously, meeting her at the front door and embracing her gracefully.
There was someone standing over him, he realised, but he was much to wrapped up in the melodrama of dying that he payed them no heed. That was, until, he realised he was in a fucking bath. Who the fuck put someone who was drowning in a bath? There were a few things he was only just presently aware of, and the fact that it had been a lake and not a bath he had almost drowned in was, bizarrely, one of them.
Attached, bizarrely, was a picture of Draco from the prophet. It showed Sam walking Draco out of Azkaban, the single moment of unsheathed emotion, and he had no idea how they had gotten it. It was him looking out across the sea with something that looked like tortured pain in his eyes. It was signed on the back.
A rippling murmur tore through the students like a wildfire as he strode through the hall, feigning nonchalance, a hushed cheer from many of the Slytherins. He did not make eye contact with anyone, instead keeping them forward facing and glinting through the artificial sky and candle glow. Echoing steps reverberated around the walls as his shoes hit the stone, coat almost billowing around him. He kept the smirk on his face. Image was power, and power was divine.
"Yes, I thought so too." She said, running her hands along the rough stone of the bannister. "Quite unnecessary how they have to mix the rooms like this, though. I'd much rather be stuck in a room with both of you." They had never really shared a room properly, only the room of requirements, but Draco could imagine just how it would go. It would be great, he thought, to share a room that smelt like cinnamon, French perfume and expensive alcohol.
"Ought I put you under a fidelius charm first?" Draco asked, raising an eyebrow.
The breakfast he made was basic but nice, and he had told Grey that if he wanted to stick the illusion of a normal diet, he could go and hunt for a stag or something. He refused, and watched Draco eat instead, which was weird in an of itself, but Draco decided he could let that one go. He doubted he could have kept it together in the dining room without someone constantly there. Grey's presence, though he would deny it, was a balm to his inevitable loneliness and misgivings. Grey kept him steady.
Lucius Malfoy, however, always got his way, and Draco wasn't going to stand in the way of that, lest he become an obstacle himself.
"Oh, fuck." He swore quietly. Harry noted that his voice was shaking almost as much as his hands. He finished rounding the corner and came into Aidan's view. His face snapped to Harry's, slightly manic, panicked, though it was clear he was trying to keep up a façade. "Oh Harry, darling, sorry about this, just dropped one of the glasses," His speech was rushed, and his smile was pulling to tightly at the corners of his lips. Harry was aware that his own expression was pulled into a sad frown, eyes narrowed in anger. "I'll clean it up, no need to be upset, see-"
"How bad has it gotten? Was- was it worse growing up? Has it gotten worse recently? I seem to recall Hermione telling me something about you in sixth year, about the pain you were in." This did shock Draco.
"I'll get it." Harry had said, taking a sip out of Aidan's glass.
Harry, upon hiding in their joint bedroom had done really the only thing he could have done. He made a decision and cried about, silent choked sobs hidden to the world by a pillow upon which he pressed his face. It was around two twenty am, and he felt ridiculous and stupid, because how-how had he fallen for it? No-one perfect just arrives on a silver fucking platter, there's always a catch.
"Draco," It was his mother's voice. She looked like she was halfway through the stages of grief and shock.
"You don't have to be so loud about wanting to fuck him." Pansy said haughtily, looking at them with a not quite glare that got across the message of displeasure whilst also telling them how much she loved them to let her behave like that.
"What the fuck is it." But his voice came out weird, not flat, like the laugh was, broken but still playing. The two men who were inevitably stood outside it side stepped. Despite the fact that he was high off his ass, this thought alone was enough to almost sober him. The syringe shattered at his feet.
"What
They ran the bath again, pleasingly hot, Draco was sure, but he spent it in agony, writhing on in the thin puddles of the water where the shock of the warmth felt like the white hot metal of branding. Grey held his hand, an unsaid gesture.
Nikolai had been sitting is room when Marie had came to fetch him. He was reading a somewhat torn book on the origins of magical creatures, shivering under his blankets against the cold of the Russian winter. He looked up when the girl breached his doorway, looking nervously feverish. He had been six and not particularly self aware, so he followed her without any better thoughts. Looking back, he really ought not to have.
"Judging from moaning Myrtle, I think we're quite safe." Draco responded, doing the same and then reaching down to help Blaise up. "Merlin, what are you, eighty?" Blaise shot him a glare in turn of a reply and was the first to stroll down the small corridor of books, casting a glance over his shoulder to see if the pair of them were following. Pansy kissed Draco's cheek as they walked.
good." Draco snorted and batted Blaise's hand away, leaning awkwardly and removing his hand from his shoulders so that he could plait Pansy's hair, who immediately turned round obediently, using her hands to throw her hair up so that Draco could reach it easier. Such as there friendship, they moved from the topic completely and began a new one.
"Mm, very much not. I'm quite alright, though the offer was nice enough. Perhaps you could avoid altercations like this if you kept your mouth shut and eyes to yourself." He drawled the first part out almost lazily, like he would have a few years ago, but he made sure his insult had enough bite to be an underlying threat, outline that he was not one to cross without saying it. Great many English teachers give the singular advice of 'show, not tell', and this is exactly how Draco deployed his speech. Make sure you're a known threat without going around and beating people up. The Weasel seemed to have no viable response and so muttered something that sounded a lot like 'Slytherin scum' and turned around again.
"I'm very sorry sir, she is no longer among the living." She had replied through a thick accent. Lucius frowned. Another girl had then come up behind the one that he was talking to and whispered something in her ear, stealing occasional glances at Lucius. Then she had left, and it was just the original girl sitting opposite him again. He smiled in a way that would prompt one to eloquently display what the topic of interest was about, but the girl just sat there, looking occasionally at the door in disbelief.
Serenity. He felt it here again, the cold of the water that was lapping at his neck. He hadn't even realised that he had gotten so deep. But the black water held promise to him, promise to make it stop. He reached for his serenity.
He wandered through the empty field to the outlines of the trees and stepped gracefully into the undergrowth. He heard muttering and slurs being thrown at him from behind, but they weren't meant to be audible and so he let it slide. Sam walked beside him and it occurred to Draco that he might be trying to get along with him.
"Alright then, I'll need to sort you out room wise next." He reiterated. He had told Grey that he was going to need somewhere to sleep, but he had been bitterly ignoring it since then.
The common room was nice enough; large and comfortable, decorated with regalia's from all of the houses, colours intertwined with crests. It appeared to have elements of all houses in there, the large fireplace surrounded by comfy sofas, a small library dedicated area with writing desks, instalments of many magical and non-magical plants and flowers and the grand high ceilings and tall windows he recognised from Slytherin. Grey looked up at him, cocking his head.
"I'm sure." He muttered. Harry didn't seem to mind so much, pushing harder into Draco, one hand on his waist, the other on his neck, tracing glimpses of his collar bone with his thumb steadily.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yes, I'm sure anything is better than what you could cook. God forbid I have to visit without the graced presence of house elves." Blaise snarked, posh and clipped with an amused tone.
"Rumour has it that it was because of Pansy that this rule was created, because they didn't want to give her an entire bathroom whilst the others had to share." Blaise snarked, just loud enough to be heard by Pansy who hit him.
"Nikolai," Lucius had said on the fifth day. They were still using translation spells, and so it came out in perfect Russian so that Nikolai was able to understand. He angled his small head up to look at Lucius as best he could whilst they were walking down a snowy pavement. He nodded. "I belive that at the end of this week, you should meet your new mother." Nikolai had marvelled at that, too.
It looked like the kind of cold that seeped into your bones, coiled around you core. It felt like dying in the calm of the undisturbed.
He gave Grey the only hoodie he had to wear, because as much as Draco appreciated Grey's build, he wasn't sure he was entirely up for seeing it all the time. This left him to wear more sophisticated wear, namely a cream knit jumper and dark trousers. The jumper, he decided, was comfortable enough, but he really could do without the trousers. Grey had also managed to weasel himself the only pair of jeans that Draco owned, deciding that they would be more comfortable than trousers. He was wrong.
"I'd prefer both, if you didn't mind." Draco lowered his eyebrow till it was more of a vaguely amused frown. Lupin didn't know how he did it.
Slipping back into the flat was an awkward affair, because he panicked on the doorstep and couldn't quite get the door open, couldn't figure out the key. He slid down the back of door once he was inside, dry heaving sobs wracking his body. He shook himself off and stood up, entering the bathroom and making eye contact with the man in the mirror. He looked like shit.
A spluttering choke. Grey withdrew quickly. Draco's eyes were opened wide, pupils dilated, and he seemed to be panicking, clutching  at his throat with an arm that shouldn't work. He was shivering violently, and Grey had the uncomfortable feeling that it wasn't because he had been found at midnight in a lake, in the bleak midst of September.
"Dick." Pansy said, glowering in the Gryffindor direction. "Still, it's not worth risking it for your honour Draco, we know you lost it the day you slept with Blaise for the first time." Draco at that point was halfway between throttling her and laughing, and Blaise seemed to be having a similar dilemma. "Oh, come on boys, don't loose your tongues, it's just an insult." And then her smirk matched Draco's previous one, and she looked very smug, proud of herself.
"Sure." He said, and his voice was the most perfect, most beautiful thing Harry had heard to this day.
And the truth was, they had both fallen in love with each other, inexpiably and perilously, without a second thought about it. There had been no need for a second date, a third or even a fourth one, because they were delaying the inevitable; they had both made up their minds. Harry was in an inescapable unlabelled abundance of emotions, emotions that could be called, despite their forms by one word: love. Aidan had fallen deep into a mess that grew deeper with each growing moment they spent together, but for him, it was like heroine. He couldn't bring himself to quit, because it was so happy, so perfect in those moments.

"Can I?" He asked. Draco nodded, inspecting the room. The window opened, and suddenly a large eagle owl was flying out of it, disappearing slowly into the distance. Draco watched the speck of black get smaller and smaller till it was barely visible through the haze of trees. It smelt fresh in the room to his great surprise. (Living with Blaise for a while often gave rooms the smell of French perfume, and he was sure living with a pair of untidy Gryffindors would make the room smell pretty bad.) Plants decorated this room as well, making the air crisp. Draco found himself liking the added greenery. He swiftly shut the window and unwrapped the curtains that seemed to be made of green silk, embroidered with silver, giving it a rippling effect that was more than pleasing. He found himself laughing at it and shaking the fabric to make it seem like pools of water against clean rock pools, amused at how pretty the colours looked. If only Blaise could see him now.
"You're crying." He told Draco, who then, stupidly, felt for tears on his face. "No." Lucius said sharply, looking very much like he could shoot Draco in the ribs and be a happier man. "Cry. Narcissa, won't you be a good mother and comfort him?"
The dementors weren’t anything new; hell knows, he had lived with them for over a year, but the cell was. It was cold, wet, and damp, and he was almost certain it was one of the worst cells that they had. When the waves crashed and broke to harshly, they sounded like the cracking of a whip which was always sure to send a spike of adrenaline through Draco, and because of all the unfortunate acts he had committed, the location of his cell meant he could feel the salty spray of those waves.
"May we dismiss you, or shall you be joining us for dinner?" Draco asked them as he and Narcissa detached gracefully. Neither of them were Sam, and Draco bitterly wished he was there. It was a sour looking woman who looked to be in her mid forties with a high ponytail hairstyle that did not suit her at all, and what appeared to be a fledgling auror boy, and Draco supposed he was only around twenty.
"What, is my body not to be washed?" He asked, cocking his head in genuine enquiry.
He could not forget him in the way that he revelled around his own heart, the kind of way that seemed to light his body on fire, send ghosts of shivers down his skin. He knew everything about Draco Malfoy, and that included the uncomfortable truth that Draco did not love him back, not in the way that Harry wished he would.
"Leave me alone." He muttered, but it sounded slurred and lazy.
"You can't sleep in the lake." He finally uttered. He was completely for Grey having a normal habitat for a kelpie, but if they were to spend any time together, Grey could not be in the lake. It was one of the reasons he had dragged Grey along. He, in turn, received a glare.
"You mean it?" He asked, long arms wrapping around Draco's chest. He put his head back to let it rest on Grey's shoulder, closing his eyes.
"Grey." He said imperiously, loud enough so that it might wake the kelpie. It worked. Grey blinked slowly  at Draco with his amber eyes, sleep blurring their angles.
Lupin, safe to say, really had no idea what to say to it all. He just stared at Draco in sad, perplexed silence, looking like he very much wanted to say 'Draco, I'm so sorry', but had the clarity to keep his mouth shut, because he knew full well what would happen if he did say it.
After a while, he gathered his fragile pieces together in a somewhat put together image, and strode up to the door, ringing the bell once he was within range. From one of the bedrooms he heard movement and noise, which was mainly his dad asking who the fuck was going to call in at four in the morning. There was also stirring from one of the spare rooms, mingled voices that he knew to be Remus and Sirius also announcing their annoyances loudly.
"I don't know how to do it." Draco look astounded.
"He's breathing." Another said. "What the fuck happened?" This voice was nice and homely, and Draco was sure it loved him to. How did people love him? He wasn't sure.
He counted his lucky stars and prayed it not be his father.
"It's literally soap and fucking water, how could you possibly not know?" He drawled. Grey started sinking further into the water, a kelpie instinct, Draco was sure. "Fine, fine, whatever you want. But you have to do something for me." he turned back and let his feet sink once again into the soapy water.
"Tell me what?"
"Yes, thank you darling." Blaise said rather loudly, cutting her off. Pansy grinned lecherously whilst Draco laughed at them. He had missed this, the stupid quarrels that didn't matter or last, the dynamic of love. It was getting dark outside.
"Yes." He said quietly.
"I once met a rare vampire sub-species who were in a cult." As if that were all the explanation needed. Draco didn't even respond; he saw no valid reason or reply.
"The ministry requires your services for a raid." Draco stilled, inhumanly stiff. He wanted to be released. Narcissa must have sensed this because her grip on his back grew stronger.
I am aware this is mostly the Slytherin trio again, but I really do love them. We kick off a bit at the end of this chapter (Open the gates fellas! Here comes the Drarry!)
Happy New Years!! I know I'm a little late, but here we are. Here's to hoping 2021 goes better that 2020, and that you've all had a better start to the year than me (yikes.)
Thank you so much for reading! If you liked it, please feel free to leave a comment or kudos, it really means a lot to me!
"I suppose it'll have to do. What did you think?" She gave him a cat like look, and Draco knew she wasn't on about Azkaban or the food.
"About everything. His name isn't Aidan it's-it's Draco, I think. Draco Malfoy."
"Yes, well, I thought you'd like them. I hope Blaise made the bed for you properly as well, that was supposed to be an extension on it." She said, examining her nails whilst she all but clung to him in a random show of affection the three of them had seemed to have adopted.
"I love you." Draco whispered last, and they watched the sun set against the horizon through a haze of happiness.
He looked back at Draco and screamed for his help. This the dementors did stop at, turning to look at Draco as if they expected a rise, a fight, anything. Draco just watched Greyback with his sullen grey eyes, getting across the single point: I don't care. Greyback howled and Draco turned away from the cell door, hit with anther chilling wave. He steadied his breathing and sank to the floor again, pressing a hand to head where he had hit it. No permanent damage, which was good if he wanted to live. He was a bit indifferent over that now, to be honest.
An image came to him, a stormy day and a dead face. He didn't even know whose face it was. His footing was even less sure of itself now, and he slipped on hard stone, falling to the earth in a loud snap.
I'm really torn between quite a few fashion choices for Draco, and it shows in my indecision, and shall probably change throughout the fic. Right now in this chapter, it has elected to be dark academia, though I'm quite confident it's not wholly his style. He will be wearing everything from ‘hooker outfits’ to cable knit jumpers in these chapters, please forgive me.
"I can take you to Malfoy manor, if you want. I'm going to be your parole auror anyway." Draco wanted to ring his eyeballs out of his skull. A fucking parole auror. He wondered how eager they were to get rid of him. He disguised his disgust with a mildly disinterested glance at Sam's robes.
"Well, when you put it like that..."
was, but I don't think it's something you just forget." Weasley didn't sound all that impressed with him, and to be fair, Draco got that. He didn't want to go there again. It was waiting for him.
"Why not?" Draco rolled his eyes glacially, not even looking at Grey.
They walked in vague silence through the high bushes that lined the path to the front door, through the big wooden doors that led to the entrance hall. Draco had to supress the repulsion in his chest and another panic. Weakness, his father had said, should be shown to no-one, they will use it against you. He led Grey up the grand staircase. He remembered running up and down them as a child whilst his mother still clung to her own chambers, when Lucius still seemed to be the father who loved him unconditionally. Once, he thought, he had tripped and fell down the entirety of the stairs and broken a rib and one of his legs. Lucius had ran out of his study to find him, and Draco was sure that was the last time he had seen pure affection on his face, as Draco tried to stand on a broken leg with no complaint and no tears.
"Yes. I don't suppose you would remember Lucius Malfoy visiting Russia with Narcissa Malfoy around eleven years ago?" Lupin nodded. He did remember, it was quite a  big news story.
"No. I suppose you'll be a little unhappy that you won't receive a lovely corpse, but here I am." It was a long winding sentence for post-drowned Draco, but he got through it with minimal stuttering. He was good at this. He had had practice.
"About what, sweetie?" She took his shoulders in her hands so he was looking into her eyes. Harry would have thought this almost comical had he not just dumped his fiance a couple hours earlier, because the three men had stuck their heads so that they were craning to see him from behind Lily's.#
"This here, is the entrance to my quarters." He said, gesturing to an ornate door near the end of the corridor at the top of the stairs. Grey nodded. Kelpies were normally well kept up to a point, so Draco could only assume that it was the market making him this filthy. He opened the door which led into a large living room combined with a study, two doors on opposing sides of the rooms. "Wait. I'll go fetch you a towel and something to wear." Grey gave him a look that was not quite appreciative or a glare. It was quite a bland expectant look, and Draco took it to say 'yes of course kind sir, I will wait here patiently, you have been so good to me'. Of course, that's not what it meant, and Draco knew it, but there was always the glimmer of imagination that daunted the corners of his vision.
"What's his name?" Lupin asked, rubbing his fingers together in an attempt to make Grey approach him, a soft smile on his face.
"I can assure you professor that I'm not going to manipulate other students." He said, smiling tightly. Lupin smiled back, less tight lipped, more pitying and soft. Draco hated that look. He turned away.
"Draco darling, you could at least tuck my shirt back in again." He said haughtily as the large wooden door swung open to reveal the rest of the year strewn around the room, all of them looking up as they entered. Draco raised an eyebrow at them and continued into the library with Blaise and Pansy at his side.
"Very sorry sir, but I have just been made aware of something. I belive you visited her six years ago?" Lucius nodded, with not quite eagerness. The girl nodded back. "We believe that you have a son. Nikolai." And that was the moment that Draco Malfoy's life went to hell.
Malfoy manor looked as imposing and eerily beautiful as it had the first time he had seen it when Sam apparated them back. Grey stood perfectly still, but he was trembling, and it was not, as far as Draco could tell, from fear.
"I'm going for a walk." Draco said suddenly, shutting his new 'Crime and Punishment' with a gentle slam. Blaise looked up from the desk with intrigue, a questioning look on his face.
Could it be? A comfort character who was supposed to be edited out has returned from the depths of creative hell? Apparently so. This is more plot coming together (hopefully) and more action for your benefit!
"Well, also, thank you darling." She stroked his hair as tough it were the most interesting thing in the world, as if it could save her from the aurors behind her.
Thank you so much for reading, and I'll see you next time!
Serenity. It had taken a while for Draco to learn that word, really, because he learnt words when they were tied to certain emotions, events. He had to spend a long time searching for serenity in that way that children wonder and ask questions that they are far too young to fathom. Was he ever that young? He didn't think so.
The banging noise increased. Increased? Draco hadn't realised they had been continuously knocking. Fucking rude. He strode over to the door leaving bloody footprints in his wake and threw open the door.
After a while, Draco kicked himself up with the second bottle and ran into the small tide of the lake that lapped at his ankles, trousers rolled up and coat forgotten, laughing to the black of the water. Blaise joined him, wrestled him into the water for the whiskey and let laughter be their words of choice. Then Pansy joined it, giggling and stumbling kicking water up at them till they were all soaked and freezing, sitting in the shallow waters with only the burn of alcohol to keep them warm against the October weather and the harrowing thoughts. And then, into the wind and cold they all whispered the same three words through their giggles and drunken thoughts.
I really hope you like this despite how late it's coming out!
"We're looking for someone." He said. His voice was rough and gravelly, he meant buisness. Harry was close to either slamming the door in their face, or running into the flat's kitchen to tell Aidan about what was going on.
"No- but-" Grey said, clearly at a loss for comprehensible words. "You can't be, they're dead-" Draco rolled his eyes.
Ok, I'll admit it, most of this is basically just fluffy banter between the three Slytherins and I'm not at all sorry. I really wanted to convey their dynamic in the right way, and this is as close as I could get, so I hope you enjoy it and get a feel for their group!
"Draco." He said, for, what else was there to say? It would be demeaning for him to ask of Draco's wellbeing, he was  sure, and he couldn't say nothing and watch him choke. Draco swallowed, but it didn't seem to do much good as his lips pulled back in a grimace.
A loud shout rang out behind him. It was another kelpie, huge and black with a straggled mane rearing and shrieking within a group of aurors who appeared to be berating a new recruit for letting it out. Grey pressed against the far end of the bars and seethed. It fell, great a huge with a resounding slap against the cold stone.
"If you bite me, I will kill you." He said, holding the bridle just outside of the bars. Both could see the fragments of truth, and Grey knew it would be a death sentence if it bit Draco.
Then the doorbell had rung. Both of them stopped mid spin, laughing, and slowing down.
"Well, I'm sure you wanted to see him, you looked so upset leaving the flat, and when Lucius smashed the picture." Draco sighed, miserably melancholic.
His heart had almost stopped at how gorgeous the man was, and then, with a rather quick realisation, saw that it was a man who appeared very close in age to Harry himself. He was wearing a white shirt with the first few buttons undone, showing the edges of his pale shoulder blades, and revealing a rather large 'v' of his chest. He looked oblivious to Harry's staring, gently fussing Padfoot and occasionally sweeping back his silky blond hair that fell around his face. Harry decided that something must be done about this, and so, he broke the silence.
And so Draco explained as eloquently as he could on the edge of a panic. He told her about the two men visiting them in the middle of the night as they celebrated, told her about how when he woke up, Harry had already packed and left. How he spent the next week barely existing in the flat. He told her, eventually, about getting high and watching his blood pour. About being taken by his parents. The more modest version, of course. She didn't need to know that Lucius Malfoy was that vile. Only the basics.
"That
He lay his head down on Draco's chest so that his forehead rested atop his ribs, moving his hands to Draco's lovely face. He had never seen anyone he liked die. He had only killed indifferently. He wondered idly if this was what the crying figures on the shore felt when they came to visit the watery graves.
"Do you recon he's too stunned by your devilishly good looks to answer?" Pansy said sideways to him after a moment of s sort of staring contest.
"I've missed you." She whispered.
"Of course. You really ought to get down to the collection point."
"You've always loved the manor and the grounds." Narcissa said quietly, as if she were doubting her entire view on Draco.
"Well, I suppose it's not so bad. Most of the time they pretend I don't exist, but it doesn't bother me." She sighed, pouting slightly. Only someone who actually knew Pansy would have seen how upset she really was. Draco put  an arm around her shoulder and squeezed.
"Wouldn't touch a peacock. No meat." The speech patterns seemed rough and unused, and Draco had to remind himself that kelpies spent most of the time in a horse form. "Why am I here? Why help? I don't understand." The tone was vaguely distressed, but not overly so. Draco stopped and turned around slowly. Grey had taken on a stance that was both offering and dominative, a show of gentle submission in the most regal way. Draco knew it well. He let out another sigh.
"Sirius!" Lily scolded, seeing Harry's distress. "Watch your mouth. Oh come in, love, I'll make you hot chocolate."
"Morning. How's that hangover treating you, Blaise darling?" Pansy asked, examining her nails with supreme curiosity from one of the leather armchairs that decorated the common room.
"One of my low points, I must admit. Tell her to forget about it."
"I suppose I'll go and pay him a visit, then."
"Am I going to get somewhere to sleep?" Grey asked haughtily as Draco inspected the signs for the doors.
"I'm fine, thank you mother. How are you?" He wasn't fine. They both knew that. He was quite frankly surprised she was even touching him, given the state of himself.
"We have a winner." Blaise called louder than neccessary, the alcohol removing any noise barriers of polite society that he previously had. Draco's right hand roamed up Blaise's back beneath the shirt he was wearing, fingers brushing lightly and pleasingly over soft skin and hard muscles.
“Harry Potter.” The goblin blinked slowly, his eyes roaming over Harry's face until he glimpsed the infamous lightning bolt scar hiding under his bangs. Severus stepped forward, deciding it was time for him to take control of the situation.
They walked for an indecipherable amount of time. It could have been minutes since they entered the hallway, but it was impossible to tell since there was no change in scenery. Occasionally a door would swing open and another goblin would appear, head buried in whatever parchment was in their hands. Just as Harry was about to ask if it was going to take much longer, the goblin abruptly stopped. He gestured to a door on the left, and Snape squared his shoulders before knocking. A moment passed, then another. No one moved. Then, a gruff voice called out. “Enter.” Severus swung the door open, and he and Harry stepped into the office. Like the hallway, it was dimly lit. Parchment covered most surfaces, as did various jewel-encrusted daggers, goblets, and necklaces. Sitting behind a large desk was a fat goblin, a small pair of glasses balancing precariously on the edge of his nose. He motioned for Snape and Harry to take a seat before steepling his fingers. “So this is the young Mister Potter,” said Vladshik, his beady eyes locked with Harry's. The young boy nodded, but otherwise remained perfectly still. This goblin was an unknown factor, and Harry wasn’t sure how he would react to any of Harry's cheek. Severus leaned forward, face blank.
“Vladshik is the manager of the account in question. He asks that you come with me to his office.” Pressing something on his side, a portion of the counter swung inwards, and he gestured for them to follow him. Harry paused only a moment, letting Severus take the lead. It was a moment of weakness he detested, but he figured that given all that had happened that day, he was allowed one or two. The goblin led Harry and Snape back through the doorway he had first gone through, which ushered them into a long hallway. Bronze lanterns lined the hallway every few feet, dimly illuminating what appeared to be an endless number of doors in both directions. Harry strained his eyes as far as he could see, but there didn’t seem to an end to the hallway. The goblin didn’t even stop as the wizards paused to take in their new surroundings, continuing his brisk pace. Both Harry and Snape had to quicken their steps to catch up, although only Severus managed to look as though he was not running.
Can I just say, to all the people who read and leave comments and kudos, this chapter is for you. Thank you for keeping me going. <3
Severus had stopped, patiently waiting for the young boy to finish taking in his surroundings. It was refreshing to see him rattled by something, as so far his face was almost as emotionless as his own. Harry was currently spinning in a slow circle, and Severus was once again thankful he had cast the disillusionment charm. He would need to take it off before approaching a counter, but for now, Harry could act as young as he wanted, and no one would know any better. Glancing around him, he saw they were starting to gather a few curious glances. The goblins might not be able to see through his magic, but they could tell someone was using a spell to hide from them, and murmurs were beginning to spread. He cleared his throat, and Harry's attention was immediately on him. Even after a few hours around the boy, he still wasn't used to the intensity behind the stare. With a quick
Hello hello! Enjoy, my lovelies
Thank you all so much for your comments and kudos! They mean so much and help keep me motivated to update more frequently. Lots of love, and enjoy this next chapter!
Ulkus and Kolrgirg continued to chant, heads bowed as they fought to contain some small part of Harry's magic. Their fingers flew as they wrote down name after name on the scrolls floating in front of them, and Snape's awe was slowly replaced by rage. Albus had sworn up and down no other relatives lived beside the Durselys, yet here was proof he had been lying. Just as soon as it appeared, it was gone. The magic that had filled the room flowed back into Harry, who sat forward with a gasp. No one said anything, the heavy panting of the two goblins filling the room. The scrolls dropped to the floors, and the goblins stumbled back in an unprecedented show of weakness in front of wizards.
“We would like to have an inheritance test done, as well as a familial locator ritual. Harry would also like to bond with his snake.” Vladshiks face remained impassive as he summoned a piece of parchment and a quill.
“Yes,” Vladshik replied, a hint of anger in his voice at being questioned. Harry shrank back slightly before straightening his back and making a quick slice to his outer forearm. This caused both Vladshik and Snape to raise an eyebrow. Most witches and wizards made cuts to their inner palm, which almost always required a healing spell to make sure no damage was caused. All three watched as four, five, six, drops of blood landed on the paper. Harry pulled his arm back, running his finger over the small cut almost absentmindedly. Snape stood up to offer to heal his arm but sat back down in shock when he saw that Harry had already healed it. Even a small spell like that, at Harry's age, with a wand, should have been incredibly difficult. His mind whirred furiously as he realized just how powerful Harry truly was. With a sinking feeling in his chest, he couldn't help but feel that Dumbledore already knew this, which meant nothing good to come in the near future.
“No,” replied Vladshik, who now had multiple parchments floating around his head. “We will, of course, require your blood, but the ritual is painless for the animal.” Harry sat back, clearly relieved. Snape frowned. He wasn't pleased with the amount of concern Harry showed his pet, but not himself. He expected it of course but made him unhappy. With a wave of his hand, three forms slipped out from under a closed door behind Vladshik. “It will be just a moment to prepare the rituals, but the inheritance test is quite simple.” He gestured for Harry to come forward, a blank parchment and small dagger appearing on the desk in front of him. “You need to make a small cut and land six drops of blood on the paper.”
“Let's do it,” said Harry, green eyes blazing with determination. The two goblins stepped forward, the one Vladshik had called Ulkus gripping a familiar silver knife in his hand. He handed it to Harry, who with just as little hesitation as last time made a slightly larger cut on his inner forearm. Kolrgrig held out a small bottle and Harry carefully held his arm over the opening. Once the bottle was about half full, he pulled away. Harry healed the small cut on his arm as Ulkus and Kolrgrig began to chant in low voices. Harry leaned his head against the back of the chair as the room suddenly filled with a brilliant explosion of greens, purples, reds, and blues. The light danced around the room, filling every crevice. Severus gaped. It was one of the strongest displays of magic he had ever seen, especially from one so young. Beside him, Vladshik also stood frozen. He had seen many rituals, hundreds, but never one so powerful, so pure and full of hope.
As Harry followed Snape up the stairs to the entrance, he contemplated how much everything had changed. Not only did he now know his birthday, but he was apparently a wizard, and no longer had to stay with the Dursleys. He couldn't quite wrap his head around it, and he was sure that if Quartzel’s reassuring weight hadn’t been on his shoulders, he would have been freaking out. Realizing they were nearly at the doors, Harry snapped his mind back to the present. He didn't want to miss a single thing. Snape slowed, glancing back at Harry as if to check he was still there. It gave him an odd feeling in his chest - he wasn't used to people caring if he was there or not. Standing before the large bronze doors were two squat figures donned in scarlet and gold robes. They looked most odd to Harry, who couldn't help but stare. They had long fingers and noses, round heads, and were almost as pale as the white stairs Harry and Snape had just climbed. Harry, assuming these were goblins, nodded to them stiffly. He wasn't offended when they didn't give any indication of having seen him - it was a response he was quite used to. Snape didn't even bother to acknowledge them, and instead walked straight past them. The large doors swung inwards, revealing a narrow hallway that led to another set of doors, also flanked by two goblin guards. Here Snape slowed, and subtly drew Harry's attention to the words engraved on the silver doors before him.
Harry stumbled as they landed, his stomach twisting uncomfortably as he adjusted to his new surroundings. He checked his neck to make sure Quarztel was still there and quickly asked her if she was alright. It wasn't until she had hissed back a confirmation that he truly looked around him for the first time. His breath caught, his mask shattering. He slowly spun in a circle, taking it all in. He and Snape stood before a large staircase which witches and wizards hurried up and down. It led to a large stone building, the word ‘Gringotts’ looming prominently. Across the cobblestone street stood an assortment of buildings, each proudly displaying their wares. Harry could see a candy shop, a large wizard handing out free sweets to the gaggle of small children surrounding him. Owls swooped through the air, and throngs of magical folk crowded the streets. There were no sidewalks, which confused Harry until he realized with a start that there were no cars. A group of teenagers stood outside what looked like a broom shop, ooing at the display in the window. A cauldron shop was nestled next to Gambol and Japes, the posters in the windows displaying the latest prank quill. He studied the attire of those surrounding him, robes, hats, and wand holsters standing out the most.
Draco makes his way over to the village. He wouldn’t lay a finger on Potter. Not only would he be sent to Azkaban for harming the Saviour, but he’d also be risking their working relationship. Draco actually quite likes him, as much as he tries to deny it to everyone. The village looks gorgeous, right out of a photograph. Smiling softly, he walks up to the nearest building and finds a path down the middle of a strip of shops. They look like little local stores, people depending on them to survive. Something feels slightly off though, and he can’t put his finger on it. He can’t see any form of signage anywhere on the exterior of the building, but it is made out of red bricks and has a black roof. The black seems to come from dirt though, so what it was before is anyone’s guess.
Managing to arrive at the Great Hall only three minutes late, he bangs the doors open and races to the front of the room. Filch is looking at him with a peculiar glint in his eye that has Harry instantly paranoid. Why is he so happy?
“Had no idea you were such a
With a gentle hand on Draco's shoulder and side, Harry shakes him awake. Draco blinks his eyes open slowly and smiles softly when he sees Harry waking him. His hair is sleep tousled and his skin is glowing from an hour spent in the sun. Harry thinks that Draco looks wonderful like this, all sleepy, sated, and beautiful. It doesn’t last long though.
He reaches for my wrist and tugs me forward. His long, grey beard tickles at the back of my head and neck as he spins me around. Potter watches on, hand in his right pocket. The elderly man starts to feel up my back, searching for something. I’m sure he’s found it when he digs hard into the skin and finds bone beneath his fingers. He slips them up further, reaching where I know the wings should stick out of my back. Parsons sighs behind me.
The last six years have been hard, tormenting, almost. Draco had joined Hermione’s harping for Harry to see someone, and Harry had eventually given in. He’d been incredibly nervous when he stepped into his therapist’s office that first time, but he hasn’t ever been more grateful for anything in his life. Thanks to Hermione and Draco’s persistence, Harry is doing so much better. He doesn’t break down anywhere near as often, and he’s able to walk through an unfamiliar forest without his heart pounding out of his chest.

The castle is dead silent, just as it should be at this kind of hour. I contemplate going through the secret passageway into Hogsmeade, but ultimately decide against it. Too cold. Instead, I slowly make my way down to the library. I pass empty classrooms, extinguished candles, sleeping portraits, and a couple of books thrown about haphazardly in the corridors. The students are quite clearly a mess, throwing school supplies around in anger, or fear… Even though we’ve only been back at Hogwarts for little over a week, we all feel it. The sheer number of curses left behind from the Battle leave us tired and irritable. People that are normally calm and quiet seem to want to shout and cry at the same time. I can feel, lying next to these curses, a trace of enchantments. As if the professors can tell the students are suffering and are trying to reverse the effects. It’s not working well, of course - no magic is strong enough to wash away thousands of deadly spells - but they are slowly doing something. I reckon by the end of the year the effects will be mostly gone.
