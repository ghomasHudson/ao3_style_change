It was a short week after the Dark Lord gave Harry the task, a week after the mirror, and a week since classes started. Harry was exhausted, it seemed like the nightmare had returned 10-fold, and between reading information for the Dark Lord and classes there was no sleep in sight. This not only made Draco worried, but everyone in his year, as well as Gemma who had taken Harry under her wing at the first of the year. To everyone who saw him saw how close he was to breaking, and were trying their best to help; but Harry the way he was, didn’t like to accept the help, not wanting anyone to worry about him. It was at this point they turned to Severus, giving small hints to the professor so that he could step in and help the poor child out. Severus noticed the change in Harry, but was unsure of what he should do since the boy had not approached him. He grew even more alarmed when his snakes started to drop non-subtle hints on what was going on. He had to step in before all progress he had made with the child was wasted on him driving himself into madness with no sleep; he was going to get Harry a mind-healer, and his first appointment was this weekend. He was unsure of what Harry would do to him once he figured out what he had done, Harry did say that he wanted to see one but more on his terms then what was, in the nature of his health; but he would rather have the boy hate him then continue with what was happening.
"Harry you know that you have to talk to someone about what happened to you when you lived those muggles. We are very concerned about you, we don't want to see you hurt anymore. We want to help you feel better." The older wizard said spying at his young charger, limp in his arms, concern was written in his eyes.
“Now Mr. Potter, we welcome you,” said a whispering voice, which wasn’t his Professor’s. Harry turned and looked at the Professor eyes wide.
“Regret! I will have no regrets in what I plan to do to those animals!” Hissed Severus, not raising his voice for fear of disturbing his son's restful sleep. “they will get what they deserve.”
Harry nodded to indicate to Severus that he heard him loud and clear, “Alright then go get on the train before it leaves, and I will see you soon.”
I hoped you liked the chapter! :D I would really love it if you guys leave comments and kudos for me it makes me all soft and warm to read what you guys think of the story! If you are shy email me! :) and I would get back to you as soon as I can, demondog136@yahoo.com
But there was something off with him, he wasn’t acting like the man he had come to know. No, this was one he knew before meeting the Dark Lord, this man had a different glint in his eye, and the way he talked was just as different. It was as if he was a copy of the man.
Levi was not happy with what his young hatchling was doing tonight, but of course he knew this had to happen if he was going to prove himself. Levi was silently making his way to the only other speaker in this school, listening all the while for anything that might make this night even worse. When Levi reached the door to the DADA office it was slightly ajar, Levi took this chance and slithered in to find something that had his scales rattle in fear for his young hatchling. His hatchling was in trouble, Levi quickly fled the office racing back down to the rooms where one dungeon bat was asleep not knowing what was going on.
The snake gave a nod at the younger wizard, the cast a glance at the older before slithering back out into the darkness of the castle. It had seemed that the castle has welcomed Levi with her magic, and was allowing him free roam of the castle as long as he didn’t try to harm any of the people that where in her walls, at the same time creating pathways for him to move about.
I couldn’t stop the blush of embarrassment that flooded my face, I would literally be falling into his arms much like those romcoms my aunt used to watch on the weekends when Dudley and Uncle Vernon were out of the house.
McGonagall made an appearance once again, “The Sorting Ceremony’s about to start. Please form a line and follow me.”
“Now Harry, this is where I leave you, I must go on ahead to Hogwarts. Draco and the others will help you on the train, and if possible help you this school year. I know you want to be in the same house as Draco, but there is a possibility that you won’t, so please be prepared for that outcome, please.”
“I-I-I’m sorry,” Harry said with a sniffle, “I-I-I d-didn’t mean for what happened last night to happen.” Tears now flowing down his face, he was such a disappointment. It didn’t help that he couldn’t recall the dreams that plagued him last night; they had been locked once again in his mind.
Both boys nodded at the advice, before taking their schedules for their first year at Hogwarts. All the first years had the exact same classes and days since they didn’t have the choices of electives just yet; so they said that they would work together as often as they could. Both the boys and the girls in their first year had already grown a strong bond with one another, and would help one another no matter what. Harry couldn’t wait for his first week of school, and was looking forward to certain classes. Also the aspect of having people there looking after him was something new to him, and something that he would never change for the world.
“Please Alec, we need to know what we need to do to help Harry.” Tom said looking calmly at the healer as if the news he was about to hear was not all that important. Of course, he was hiding how truly anxious he was. Severus had enough on his plate; and one of them had to be level headed in this situation.
“That is no excuse Ronald, now you two,” Percy said, looking at the twins, “I want no trouble from you two this year, if I so much as hear of a prank from you two, I will personally, as a prefect and as your brother, take care of you.” Percy said, fixing his glare upon the twins.
Harry and Hermione did rent an apartment together since they both new each other routine and way of life thanks to the year on the run. That of course did not help with the media issue, but for them they knew secrets of each other that the media nor the Weasley family knew.
ever did to him, how could no one see that he was weak; but with the calming draught in his system he didn’t go into a panic attack.
Ayo guys gals and non binary pals! Are you a fic writer that would like to join a group that can use your talents in a fun way? Are you someone who enjoys reading fanfics and would love to beta read for aspiring writers and help them with writers block? Do you need a little push to start writing yourself? Well a friend and I have started such a group on Discord called #WritersDen where we help one another write and learn to push our boundaries within our fandoms! link down below if you are interested.
Harry jumped at the sudden voice in his head, the voice that he hasn’t heard since the Zoo. He turned his head a little and saw in the bushes pale glowing yellow eyes. He took a quick look around and saw that there was no at the park anymore before making his way over to the snake.
Harry, already knowing that even though they might be choosing a side, they could turn the whole world on end with just a few moments. Severus sighed, but nodded, seeing no other option that was before them. He pulled his son into a tight hug not wanting to let go. He thought he could save him from this war for a couple more years, but it looked like he was wrong. Harry returned his father’s hug, just content at the moment, nothing more was being asked of either of them. Severus removed himself from the hug and stood up to write an important letter. He took his time to write, then sent the letter out immediately.
"Harry, you do not need to talk to me if you do not wish, we can find someone to help you, even Mrs. Malfoy is willing to help you. Can you please let us help you?" Severus asked the small boy, his heart hurt for the boy knowing that he could give him help, but only if the child would accept the help. Severus sighed in relief when Harry nodded, he knew that the child was scared that people would think less of him because off what he has been through; but this had to happen to make sure there are no lingering effects from those awful muggles. He kissed the top of Harry's head and mumbled into his unruly hair, "Thank you Harry, thank you for allowing me to help."
Thank you for reading all that, I know I know it was a lot, but I think you should know what is up with everything and why I haven't been answering comments or seemed distance compared to when I usually do answer I do hope you stick with me through all this and will continue to read even though there might be VERY long breaks between updates. Well know for now I will let you go read this chapter.
and inform that we have made it here and will try to return as soon as possible?” Levi hissed a yes and slithered on his way, two small ‘thank you’s followed him out from the other two Slytherin’s. With a gulp, Harry, Draco and Gemma pushed the heavy door open; soft snoring could already be heard from inside.
With that, Snape turned and left the common room, his robe billowing as he stalked away. The first years were a little terrified, with the exception of Draco and Harry already knowing what he was like. They all quickly made their way to the boy’s dormitories. Their stuff was already set in front of their bed. Harry smiled when he saw Neit already curled up on his bed fast asleep. Harry quickly changed and joined her pulling her underneath the covers so he could cuddle her. Harry couldn’t wait for the classes to start, and the expectations of making new friends high in his head as he drifted off to dream land.
So again if you are intrested in helping me writes these email me, or if not then leave a number down in the comments in what you really want to read in the future. Hope to hear from you guys!
To those reading this new and old readers, I am sorry for the long wait. I've had ups and downs in RL, but know I have been slowly working on this story, I recently finished the looking of the story fixing where I could. I have to give a good friend and Beta CeeCee a tip of my hat for reading all the old chapters and helping with the corrections. I will slowly start re-uploading chapters as I slowly work on new chapters. But I should have new chapters slowly coming out again.
“You’ll never guess what happened, my Christmas was good, a lot of things have happened,” Harry said excitedly, then launched into the adventures of the adoption and how they ran into his old family, everything. Well, of course, leaving out Severus’s present; that was something that was going to stay between the two of them for now.
“Vernon this is awful! There is no one to watch the boy!” His Aunt sighed dramatically as she grabbed the said boy by the ear and led him to stand in front of his uncle, “What ever shall we do with him?!”
“Yeah, that’s the only reason I am up so early, you git.” Mumbled Draco, before standing up, “Let’s go wake up mum, dad, and Severus so that we can go open presents!”
“Harry, it’s too early for this,” Draco yawned, ruffling his bedhead even more than it was. Harry just smiled at his friends reflection, Draco who always had his hair done and everything of his outfit was perfect now stood behind him in pajamas that where rumpled and bedhead worse than Harry’s hair on a good day.
The Dark Lord hissed at the boy, he didn’t want his fool of a vessel to hear his plans, just in case that a certain Headmaster decided to snoop through his mind. The Dark Lord could only protect his mind, and a little of what he said to his vessel, away from him, but not enough to fool the old man.
Draco took a seat on the same couch Harry was occupying, listening to the silent hissing that came from his friend and the snake, as they carried on a conversation. Draco felt a little left out, not knowing what he could say or do. This boy was such a mystery to him, much like the day he had met him. So he sat their studying the young wizard they was he moved and talk, the way he reacted to everything around him. He had been doing this since the school year started and noticed a few things that were different here and there; for starters Harry never allowed anyone to touch him, if someone tried he would flinch away and mumble an apology. He would always have his eyes cast downward never looking anyone in the eye, the closest he had ever come to looking someone in the eye was his Uncle, and when Harry noticed what he was doing, quickly looked back down to the ground. Harry also never really talked to anyone save for a few words here or there, and that was only to the student, it seemed that Harry mostly talked to Draco, Theo, and the Girls’ Prefect Gemma the most out of everyone. In class Harry never raised his hand, but always mumbled the corrected answer under his breath. Draco was puzzled, of course he respected his privacy, and didn’t bring it up even though it bothered him deeply. He knew from what his mother told him and his father the night she came home after treating Harry that the young boy was not very trusting of people, and that he had a rough past, but she never said anything beyond that. Draco thought it would be better to let Harry talk to him when he was ready, rather than forcing it from him or someone else. Draco really wished he had a way to help his friend, but for now all he could do was sit and wait. Draco started to pull out his textbooks out of his school bag, setting a couple of books upon the small coffee table in the parlor area, ready to start the assigned reading; all the while stealing glance back at Harry.
, the Wireless Network’s Chosen production, and if they don’t make me say that again, I might continue to show up for this gig.” Harry grimaced, reading the notes on his cue card for another promotion.
“Merlin, yell it louder, I don’t think they heard you in Hogsmeade,” Malfoy snarled, but his feet stilled. He paused, before cocking his head to the right. “You know about Alders, though.”
“Practice has been a little...tense.” Draco swallowed, and his stare drifted to the ground. “He barely lets me practice, and the others on my team think...well, I can’t imagine what they think. Most won’t even look me in the eye.”
“Not so loud,” Draco said sternly, before situating himself next to the couple. “He— I mean I think—well...”
“What would the Wizarding World think if they knew, hmm Potter? That you were filthy, spending your nights in a kinky, kinky club.” He stared into the soft glint of Potter’s eyes, noting the same far-away expression he had seen in Pansy just that afternoon.
Draco would return from the shower, fully dressed and none-the-wiser, and Harry would have a half-hard cock and a stupid grin on his face, before kissing his husband goodbye and watching him floo off to work.
Once Neville left, Pansy patted the space next to her on the couch. “Now, what’s your Scarhead problem?” she asked with a grin.
“I think our audience would listen to you talk about your latest poo, if I’m being honest,” Lee had chuckled. “They haven’t heard from you since the war. Everyone’s curious what you’ve been up to.”
Draco stood stunned, as he watched Potter walk away. He couldn’t help but notice the cling of his wet shirt to the ridges of his back, the hard angles of his sides. How the water pelted against his arse, accentuating each plump mound as his hips swayed back and forth.
“I can read very well, thanks,” Potter said. “Your handwriting is not as delicate as I remember, though. Guessing you were drunk when you wrote it.”
Authors notes: We really delve into Draco's anxiety in this chapter. Advanced warning of a pretty bad anxiety attack, so please only read if you're in the right headspace. It gets better by the end, because Neville is...Neville.
Harry focused on the smallest of sounds, the slight shuffle of leather boots against the concrete, the heaviness of his own breath as the anticipation built. He waited, unmoving, until he was told exactly what to do.
Sometimes he’d pull himself off right there, watching the flames dissipate, or he’d wait until he was in the shower, hot water coursing down his skin while his hand pumped along his length. He’d dress, head to work and try not to think of those stockings again.
Great success required great determination, though, and Draco was grateful for his station, no matter how simple the task. A former Death Eater couldn’t laugh in the face of opportunity, not when the evidence was still so clearly stained on his forearm.
“That’s it, baby,” Neville murmured as Theo rode up and down on his cock. His hands were still gripping Theo’s hips, helping him grind. “Make yourself feel good, I’ve got you.”
Pansy cocked her head. “Same thing as you, darling. That he could live up to everyone’s expectations.”
He whispered something then, and whatever it was had Theo gasping as he stood and turned in between Neville’s thighs. They brought their lips together again as Neville worked off the remainder of Theo’s shirt from his shoulders.
But in the end, Draco knew the real reason he gravitated towards the stall nearest his biggest nemesis. He’d never say it aloud, though. A Slytherin can hold a secret, even from himself.
“Please, Sir, please spank me with your belt,” Harry said in a rush, rolling his hips in his eagerness. He wished he could see it, see his Master’s suspenders and trousers, and his thin black belt with the gold buckle as he folded it in half for Harry’s punishment.
Harry found them in the back of the drawer. It’s not like he was snooping, but his Gryffindor tie was missing again, and Draco had a habit of taking it with him when he went away on long trips.
“That’s it. Class is over.” Neville closed his eyes and cleared his throat. “Draco, my office. Harry, please sit down and wait for me. As for the rest of you, class is dismissed. I’ll owl you with your individual schedules tomorrow.”
that he barely ended a show without it. Now, every Friday, like clockwork, Harry would finish his two-hour block listening to Malfoy whine. It fueled him for the rest of the weekend, and almost made him look forward to heading back into the studio.
“Is that the spot?” Neville groaned after slipping two fingers inside and hearing Theo’s guttural moan around his cock. Theo couldn’t make any more noise as Neville slid his entire length deep into Theo’s throat and held. And held.
“And then he just hung up,” Harry said, telling Ron about his most recent show over a plate of biryani. Harry had cooked it, which made it rather more edible than Ginny’s curry.
“Good, so far. I’ve been able to choose for the first time in my life. What I do, who I room with…” he paused, giving Draco a quick wink. “Who I kiss.”
he exhaled and listened. The wind blowing against the door, his mother’s heel as she tapped her foot, the whir of his refrigerator.
Except, when he finally opened his eyes, he didn’t feel great. In fact, he felt quite disgusting, bloated, and sore from sleeping all night pressed against the straight back of what used to be his favorite chair. His head was pounding, his window was open, and his peacock, Talulah, was missing from her perch, probably out to get the Saturday issue of the Daily Prophet. As he picked up his glass from the hardwood floor, Draco noticed his fingers were covered in smudged ink; a quick Scorgify removed the black stain as well as cleaned the glass before he Accioed it carefully to the shelf. A shower would do, Draco thought to himself. Yes, a shower would make him right as rain.
“That’s all our time today!” Harry quickly interjected. “Thank you for listening, and until next week, Potter on!”
“Well it’s not—” Draco started to defend himself, but paused. “Fine, it is Potter, but not for the reasons you think.”
“Impact Play is a large part of this lifestyle for a reason,” Neville began to explain, picking up the tiniest sphere and holding it out in his palm. “It’s utilized as a stimulator for your body to produce endorphins.”
Just as he walked through the threshold of steam from the bathroom into his hallway, Draco heard a hard knock at his front door. His towel was secure but his head was still pounding. It was probably just the post dropping off the paper if his bird didn’t do her morning duty, though, so instead of pulling on a shirt, or at least a set of pants, Draco strutted confidently to the door and swung it wide open, expecting no more than a knotted Prophet in his entry.
“Your excuses are about as weak as your participation was today, Malfoy.” Harry grinned, leaning back in his chair. “Do ring us again when you’ve decided to get your head out of your arse and into the game, alright?”
But that feeling was dissipating fast, too fast. Every rise and fall of his chest seemed to release that feeling, and Draco wished he could hold his breath, hold it in forever.
“I wanted to buy you a drink,” Harry said, trying to sound nonchalant, as if his heart wasn’t racing at the sight of his old nemesis.
Harry breathed a sigh of relief when he heard the Floo crackle and simmer, and immediately ripped the drawer from its pulls and emptied it on the floor.
Pansy was right. They knew so much about each other; if there was anyone in the world he could ask, that he knew would give him an honest answer, it was Pansy.
Play didn’t necessarily mean sex. That’s what Pansy and Neville had both told him on numerous occasions. But if they were going to play, and that play involved sex, well… Draco wasn’t sure if he wanted to watch. After all, he knew the people in that room. It wasn’t the same as flipping through Quidditch Monthly or delving into his fantasies. This was live, in front of him, and with people he’d have to look in the eyes afterwards.
“I do actually,” he started, cocking his head slightly to the left. He was surprised no one had stopped him yet, especially Longbottom who was surely brooding right over his shoulder.
“You may come,” his Sir commanded, and Harry finally let himself tip over the mountain he had been climbing for the past half-hour, for the past week. His orgasm overcame him, and Harry could feel his body convulse in pleasure.
He certainly wasn’t trying to imagine how all of that spunk got there in the first place. Whether Potter had wanked himself raw, coating his chest multiple times with his own pleasure. Or whether it was someone else’s, holding him still as they painted his muscled chest with their own seed.
He thought he saw the slightest tilt, the almost nod of Potter’s head, his hair frazzled as if he had already been fucked, as if it had already been gripped and twisted and
“Good boy,” Neville said, and Draco watched with anticipation as once again Theo shuddered at those words. “Now, Theo is my Submissive. He is also my boyfriend, my partner, and has graciously volunteered to show the class how good of a Submissive he can be.”
It only took him five brisk steps to reach the scarheaded git. “Didn’t think you were a quitter,” he snarled. He had to scream the last word over the crowd of singers.
Draco didn’t want to count. He wanted to leave, tear up his list, and never look back. But a part of him, the cold underneath the fire, reminded himself of how much he’d already overcome. So he closed his eyes and counted.
I started this story as a challenge to myself, to see if I could write 50k. I now know I can (whew) but I also know that it's not my preference. I get burned out around the 15k mark. This is all to say, most of the next parts of this fic will be shorter ficlets, mostly PWP w feelings. Thank you for reading along, and I hope you continue to do so.
Draco gulped as he took in Neville’s fully exposed form. Those cardigans really hid the bulk of Neville’s shoulders, and the muscles on his forearms were bigger than any Draco had seen, even in some of his favourite Quidditch magazines. He watched as Neville’s hand dipped under the hem of Theo’s pants, rubbing the bulge that hid under the thin fabric.
Neville shook his head. “Not without my permission.” Neville tapped Draco’s sheet on the wall, pointing at
“Hold yourself up, Potter.” His voice filled Harry’s ears as his thigh was lifted and his knee was bent. He walked his hands in front of the chair as his legs were spread to each side of his Master’s hips.
“I dunno.” Potter shrugged, his cheeks darkening into a deep garnet. “Something like...I want to fuck you so hard.”
“You’ll see,” Potter grinned mischievously, holding out his hand again. This time Draco took it, not worrying about the blush rising across his cheeks as he followed Potter down a winding dirt path.
“Ungghh,” Harry moaned, fully aware that he was panting, his palms slick with sweat as he held his contorted body at his Master’s mercy. Sir inserted another finger, and Harry keened, no longer able to stop his hips from rutting against the silk trousers of Sir’s thigh.
“Would you feel pretty in a skirt?” Harry asked, practically breathless. He knew he was pushing his luck; Draco had only mentioned the corset, no other items of feminine clothing, but Harry had to know.
Draco squinted into the tree and subsequently into the magicked sun that beat down on the exhibit. He thought he saw, but no. It couldn’t be.
He opened his eyes, feeling calmer and more sure of himself than he had in so long. With a steady voice, Draco looked at his parents.
He figured Potter would have grabbed a towel as well, but instead he just cocked his head and gave Draco an approving nod before saying, “Looking good, Malfoy.”
“Which leads us into the final element of power play. I will admit, this is going to be a large focus of our sessions here.”
He took the moment of reprieve to perform a quick cleansing spell and tuck himself back into his trousers. The group around him dissipated, some finding their own spaces, others heading back to the bar, until Draco was the only one who remained.
Draco nodded, but that feeling of flying kept creeping into his mind. “And if my flower needs something I’m not sure I can provide?”
Deep down, he knew he’d made his amends and that there would always be those that hated him, or blamed him, or didn’t want to know the new Draco. He just really hoped that his aunt, or even his cousin, wouldn’t be one of those people.
Draco nodded numbly, glancing down at their joined hands. “I’m sure she sends her best, Aunt Andromeda.”
Theo was one of the few Slytherins Draco thought he’d keep in touch with. They gave it a real shot for a bit, meeting at taverns and the occasional party they would be dragged to attend. However, when Draco began his apprenticeship, they lost touch. His time was stretched thin between classes and practicums and required dinners with his parents that Draco just hadn’t had time for much else. Perhaps that was how he also missed Pansy’s breakdown. He really needed to thank Ginny one day for helping her through that.
“Your stockings.” His mind filled with images of the fabric, the lace, the bows. “I know you were hiding them, love, and I’m sorry for snooping, but I was looking for my tie.”
Draco’s eyes snapped open and they flitted over to the closest window. There, a large barn owl hovered, peering through the frosted glass.
“The third practice is all about insight. Knowing your partner in play. Where they come from, what they want to achieve.
Draco could only describe his first week back at Hogwarts as a living hell. While the castle looked perfectly fine, every one of his classrooms was in a different spot. He had somehow brought the wrong textbook to Herbology, and he couldn’t even find the strength to enter his Potions classrooms.
Instead of sharing an ale with his best friend, Draco settled into his leather chair at home, poured himself two fingers of scotch, and drank until he forgot what he saw. Tomorrow he’d be great again.
How Potter would look, chest broad and hair sticking to the nape of his neck as he rode Draco’s own cock, his eyes closed and eyelashes fluttering with a green and black collar knotted around his own neck. How Draco would reach up, and pull Potter down by his collar and kiss him, breathe him in as Potter wriggled on top of him.
He went by Pansy’s room and found a similar note pinned to the frame. Zabini’s room was also empty, and while there was no note, Draco had a suspicion that the entirety of his dormitory was in the same place.
“No one is going to have the exact same list.” Neville reached into his own pocket and pulled out his own checklist, as tattered as he had described. It was covered in scribbles and dirt, and a leaf had somehow clung to it
“Petrificus,” Neville yells, his voice bounding around the room. The safe word instantly made the walls glow red, and Draco blinked rapidly into the light.
“We were!” Pansy grinned. “Got there about 10, after Gin’s Quidditch practice. She had quite a bit of energy left, surprisingly.”
, as you like to describe it, has only brought me pain. Suffering, stress and guilt. You can’t tell me you don’t feel the crippling pressure that being in our families brings us? My mother expected me to be beautiful, thin, perfect. Marry rich, whether I was in love or not. That’s what I was reduced to, a size and a proposal.
“Your owl was clear, your intentions are not.” Malfoy said with a sneer, before turning to order a drink from the bartender.
“Now, now, no need to cringe. I told you I’d be calling you out, and I know you can handle this.” Neville smiled softly, his eyes locked on Potter while his hand shifted to grip Theo’s neck. “Keep in mind, class, this is a safe space. I don’t need to remind you that what we discuss here doesn’t leave the club unless both parties consent.”
Harry had shrugged noncommittally, but after Hermione had badgered him for another evening about him moping around the house and collecting dust, Harry had agreed. Henceforth,
“So, you’re my godfather's cousin,” Potter responded, flashing a smile. Draco trained his eyes away from that gorgeous grin and instead focused on the shock of blue being chased by a swarm of red-heads.
“I said you’re homophobic, Potter. Going around and calling out others based on their sexual preference, on public Wireless no less.”
That night he had wanked himself raw, thinking of wrapping Potter’s wrists around his wrought iron bed posts, knotting his ankles as well so all his body could do was twist and beg, crying for Draco’s touch, his hand, his mouth, his cock.
, properly. Never dad, and certainly not daddy. Yet, when he uttered the word, instead of tightening as Draco surely would have done, Theo seemed to relax further into the floor, his fingers splayed across his skin in an easy fashion.
Potter placed his finger to his lips, motioning for Draco to be quiet, as he studied the limbs of the trees. After a moment, Potter raised his hand to point towards one of the uppermost branches.
Safeword discussion, as well as past relationships, and a scene involving a dom caning a sub (not any HP characters). Draco has a bit of panic, and a discussion about needs.
Of course it wasn’t about Potter. He just hadn’t seen the arsehat since that day when everything crumbled apart, towers falling and curses flying and Potter wilted and cold in Hagrid’s arms. He had fled with his parents, not knowing and no longer caring how the war would end. So much had already been lost; so many.
“Not Krum, you daft prick.” Malfoy sighed, and Harry could practically feel the pain through the phone. “You don’t give a shite; why am I even talking to you about this?”
“I think that’s why I kept it so long,” Potter responded, disregarding Draco’s plea. “It was like holding onto a part of you.” He pushed off of the corner of Draco’s bed and headed to his trunk. Draco recognized his wand instantly, taking a moment to acknowledge how well it had been taken care of. His hawthorn wand was polished to a state where it looked practically new.
Neville moved one hand back to Theo’s shoulders, the other one resting securely on his belt as he surveyed the room.
Neville nodded at Theo. “My teddy bear here can find structure in knowing his place. It is on his knees, waiting for his next instruction. This allows him to relax, to let go, to focus on me as opposed to what could be happening outside that door, out in the real world.
“Leave?” Draco’s father barked. “This is the fourth Sunday, Draco Malfoy, and we are your parents! As such, we demand—”
“Well,” Malfoy started, “a lot of practice with a very accomplished Quidditch player, and quite a bit of cardio workouts.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “You Gryffindors and your blatant joy. Yes, he invited me to spend time with my own cousin, if you must know.”
Thanks again, y'all, for reading along, for warming my heart with your kind words, for keeping me motivated and supporting me when I lagged behind on my posting schedule. It means so much to me. I hope you all enjoyed.
Convincing yourself of things is truly an art, much like mixing the finest potions; one must be confident in one's ability to track the moon and pierce the skin and dice the ingredients into the exact proportions as precisely as one must be to create such a grand tale that they don’t question their own thought process.
The slaps of his Master’s belt kept raining down on him, one after the other, until pain flared across Harry’s backside, heating his skin until every touch felt like exquisite fire.
And now he’d have to stare at them every time before he fell asleep. McGonagall looked especially pleased, pairing Draco and Potter in a room together. Not even a Hufflepuff would be sacrificed to keep them from fighting. No, they were in the only two-bedroom room in the new eighth-year dormitory.
“Does…” Draco’s mind rushed with thoughts. He cleared his throat and tried again. “Does that mean, if our greens don’t match up, we should not…” Draco hated that he was questioning this. He hated that he didn’t just know the answer to everything.
He could feel the class turn on him, all eyes focused like he had just been scratched by a Hippogriff. Ignoring Longbottom’s death glare, Draco sneered towards the other end of the line.
“For instance, Theo here wants to be good.” Neville leaned down and planted a kiss on the top of Theo’s head, his hand still rubbing into his skin. “His father was not a good man, and his mother died too young to truly look after him.”
Theo moaned before eagerly nodding, and Draco clenched his own fist around his needy cock. Neville pulled Theo off of the bed and laid down himself, back to the mattress and feet planted firmly to the floor.
“You wouldn’t even care if it was just my finger, would you?” his Sir teased, pushing one in just to pull it right back out. “You’d be grateful for anything I give you.”
He half-expected his heart to race, his magic to flair. He closed his eyes, anticipating that he’d have to start counting down. The sound of his shoes, angrily tapping on the hardwood floor. A door slamming shut in the next flat over. Tap, tap, tap of an owl’s beak against his window.
Draco wanted to press the issue, especially because of Longbottom’s horrendous diversion, but was thwarted by birthday wishes.
Draco cast a Tempus and growled inadvertently at his cursed wand with its cursed time. He was late. And he hadn’t prepared a single thing for his parents’ monthly dinner.
Pansy threw up her hands. “No Weasleys, got it! Because of their lack of vagina? Gin excluded, of course, but her snatch is well tended to.”
“And Bondage.” Neville smiled softly. “I’m glad to see that one. I think it will help you to know when someone can or cannot touch you.”
Draco let his own hands, slick with lubricant, caress his throat. He imagined it was Harry’s hand there, pressing into his neck, holding him still as he stared deep into his eyes. How that hand, his hand, would feel. If it would be constricting, or the opposite; controlled, strong, possessive.
is that Theodore keeps his eyes trained to the floor. This helps in twofold. The first is that he is more focused on my commands, therefore falling a bit easier into his role during play. The second is that his eyes are too captivating for me to stare at for too long, and keep my composure. You have the most gorgeous eyes, don’t you, love?”
“Aren’t you going to follow?” Draco asked. His drink was almost empty, and he wondered if he should order another one.
If you don't want to read it, I totally understand. It's 100% okay to skip it, you will not miss any of the plot going forward. Take care of yourself first and foremost.
“What the fuck, Potter?” Draco yelled, before tucking into his broom and flying the short distance to his enemy.
“Maybe,” Potter shrugged, before folding the parchment into a tight square and tucking it into his pocket. “Or maybe I just know you.”
After work, Draco headed to Hawes & Curtis right outside of Diagon Alley. Pansy had recommended it when he owled, even giving him the name of someone to ask for.
He didn’t go back to the Manor, though. Instead, he checked into the Leaky, shut the curtains and shut out the world.
“Oh,” she chuckled, “please, call me Andy. Everyone does.” She gave him one more squeeze before releasing his hands from her gentle grasp. She wiped a tear away from her eye before giving him a grin. “Now, it’s almost time for cake! Would you both gather everyone together, and I’ll round up the birthday boy?”
Draco tried holding his breath as well, wondering how Theo was keeping such control as Neville stoppered his air. Just when Draco was growing concerned, and having to release his own breath, Neville pulled out, giving Theo a brief reprieve before delving his cock back into the warm, wet heat of Theo’s mouth.
He dropped his towel from around his waist, hanging it on the closest hook, and with the barest of whispers he conjured lube into the palm of his hand. He was already hard, his morning erection only increased by the current circumstances.
Honestly, I thought about not posting today. There's just so much going on around the world that an emotional chapter like this just didn't seem helpful. But I reread it, and reminded myself of the tools Neville teaches Draco, and thought maybe someone else could use that reminder this week.
“Pain, maybe, but it’s not the same as a cut or a bruise. It makes everything more sensitive; your body focuses on that one source.”
“You’ve got me so hard,” Theo moaned as Neville leaned forward and playfully bit on his lip. Neville only hummed in response as he dragged his tongue downward, mouthing at Theo’s throat, before latching on to the drop of his ear.
His body tingled as he heard Potter’s gasp of awareness right before Draco swallowed it, bringing their lips together into a breathtaking kiss.
Like his hearing. He was positioned on the floor, his knees pressed uncomfortably against the hard concrete as he waited for the barely audible turn of the doorknob and the very distinct tap of his Master’s shoes as he walked toward his prey.
“Sure you don’t want to play tonight?” Pansy asked, peering over at Ginny like she was the only one in the room.
“Nervous about your date?” Pansy asked, taking a sip of her own drink. “Ginny won’t be back for an hour or so, but I can owl her?”
Okay. I want to preface the next few chapters. There's a lot of hot steaminess, and there's a lot of unsafe practices. Moreso in the next chapter, but please note that chap 22-23 are full of things Daddy Dom Neville Longbottom would not be thrilled with. If you want to find those items out before reading, please skip to the end notes. If not, read ahead.
“Training your Submissive can be a play in itself.” Neville added. “Just make sure that you’re clear with your objectives. Otherwise, you could end up having to inflict a punishment where you may or may not have wanted to.”
I will say, that 25 chaps is a lot to write, but is not simply long enough for me. That being said, I went ahead and created a Series for this, so if you want to find out this groups next round of adventures, please subscribe to the Series (or if you're feeling frisky, to me as an author!)
With that, he turned and headed down the hallway, his walk bright and springy, his head bopping from side to side as if he were listening to some funky beat.
They weren’t in his desk drawer at work (why would they be?) nor were they in the twines of his broomstick that he took to the Auror vs. Ignis pickup Quidditch game.
“Do let Alexsander know,” he said as he crossed the threshold. “Poor fellow was in a tizzy with worry.”
“I bet your mouth would look so pretty wrapped around my cock, Potter,” Draco continued, ignoring Neville’s now audible warnings from across the room. “You talk all day, but you never get to use that throat of yours, do you? Every word you say is for them, but every noise you make is for me, isn’t it?”
“Less than a foot?” Malfoy growled out of the phone and directly into the speaker where all of Harry’s listeners could clearly hear him. “More like a yard, and you failed to mention the sheets of rain that kept falling out of the sky.”
Draco followed Ginny and Pansy down the hall, until they turned left towards the front desk. Definitely not wanting to see their playtime, Draco turned in the opposite direction and found himself in front of a clear glass wall etched with a two.
Harry couldn’t wait any longer. He grabbed one of Draco’s hands, forcing him to drop a butter knife he was clinging to, and pushed his long fingers against the front of his trousers. He needed Draco to see, to understand just how the thought of him in those stockings affected him.
“Know him well?” Draco asked as they started wandering around the grounds. He wished he didn’t sound so damn curious about his own cousin, but he couldn’t help it. This was a side of his family he had never known, a side of the family that had somehow escaped the hard path of being a Pure-Blood.
Draco tilted his head to the right. “Still knotted to the bedpost from when we played ‘naughty boys in detention’.”
“Everyone is different, like all the plants at my shop, and we tend to them differently as well.” Neville held the vibrator between his finger and thumb. “Since Theo doesn’t like my hand, I use one of these instead.”
He was also surprised that even though they had clearly reached their destination, Potter did not let go of his hand. Instead, he threaded his fingers through Draco’s as he led him to the closest black walnut.
Most of the time, he spent his days uninterrupted. He’d hear murmuring outside his door when it was lunchtime, the other apprentices heading out for some crisps and a bap, but Draco stayed. He’d much rather eat while keeping a firm eye on his potions than make awkward conversations with his colleagues.
Hello! So this chapter is v. dark and can be quite triggering. Please protect yourself first and foremost. I'm going to put the triggers in the end notes so you don't have to read if you don't want to. The next chap will have a brief summary of this one, so if you don't want to read it, I'll catch you up next time so you can keep reading along!
Draco reminded himself. He was still having a bit of trouble wrapping his head around cardigan-wearing, plant loving Neville Longbottom in leather chaps.
“Now, every Dom is different. Some might want their Subs to stand, others might want a combination where they knot their wrists above their head. Whatever it is, basic positions can be varied and helpful.”
“I seem to remember a match during Third Year where I was in a storm AND faced Dementors.” He cracked his knuckles. “Don’t remember you cutting me any slack.”
Malfoy shifted so his thighs were on either side of Harry’s own before settling in Harry’s lap. “I can do a lot of things very, very fast,” he said with a smirk, before leaning close to Harry’s ear, “or I can do one thing very,
Pansy took a breath. “The first few smacks always hurt. Sometimes, they’re quick, louder than you expect, but it always has a sting.” She paused, looking at Draco for confirmation he was following.
to a dirty post in the middle of Diagon Alley. When he walked through reception, the same kind wixen directed him ‘down the hall, first door on the left, love’.”
Draco felt his fingers curl into a fist. He hated having to be so raw and so open, especially when they had just shared such a tender moment. “It’s not just a club to me, Potter. It’s a lifestyle that makes me happy, and I can’t force someone to be a part of it if they don’t want to be.”
He glanced towards the bathroom door and was satisfied to see it still shut and the water still running. With deft fingers, he yanked out several of the old ratty shirts, winter jumpers, and discarded ties in a fury, searching desperately for the stockings he knew lived there.
Harry looked at the phones, delight running across his skin as he saw the little light signalling a waiting call. “It looks like we might have some Malfoy fans calling in, so let’s go to the phones!” He pressed the little button, opening the connection. “You’re on with Potter, how are you Pottering on today?”
On a side note, OMG I was so tickled to see the reaction from everyone on the last chap! I thought I put SO MANY SPOILERS in there about it, and to see everyone so surprised was AMAZING!!! Thank you ALL for reading along, your comments get me through the week, and I really appreciate your patience while I post these last few chaps. They're all written, so it should be a smooth posting going forward, every two weeks on Monday.
“She loves when I let go,” Pansy said confidently. “She loves that she’s helping me, and I love that she’s strong enough for the both of us when I need her to be.”
He could barely crawl out of bed in the morning, and when he went to take a shower, he found every single one except the last stall occupied. He slid the curtain back, focusing on releasing his robes when he discovered he was indeed wrong. As his robe dropped, his gaze rose until it met with one Harry James Potter, glistening wet and as stark as the day he was born.
Draco felt the urge to flee again, but kept himself rooted to the spot. The safety measures and elements he had learned throughout the week flooded his mind, and he steadied himself in Neville’s steady gaze.
“Which is basically foreplay for you two,” Ron said with a sly grin. “The least you can do is ask him for a drink, or a cigarette after.”
Potter bending over to pick up a quill, or a book, or one of Draco’s origami cranes that had drifted to the floor. That smile he wore when he saw his friends; the smile he flashed when he asked Draco to the zoo. That fucking smile that warmed something up inside of him.
Before sitting, Draco pulled a neatly folded parchment from his pocket. “I filled this out, but if I could get a fresh one, I’d like to clean it up.”
It wasn’t that Malfoy was bad; in fact, if Harry was being honest, he was a fantastic seeker. Lithe on a broom, incredibly fast, and laser-focused. Last season, he had crushed the competition, and Harry had been delighted to watch him catch the Snitch week after week. But something seemed to be holding him back lately, and it showed in his matches.
“Draco, so nice of you to join us!” Pansy gave him a warm smile before facing the rest of the room once more. “Everyone in a circle, let’s play!”
“An Occamy! It was as big as a dragon, but then Mr Rolf made it shrink into a tea kettle! You’ve got to come and see it!” Teddy tugged at the sleeve of Potter’s shirt, and finally, he tore his eyes away from Draco.
“Trust me, you don’t.” Malfoy paused, and Harry was hopeful for a minute that he’d continue. Instead, he just said, “Goodnight, Potter.”
“Well, do tune in next week, where I’m sure we’ll be discussing your magnificent fail against the Harpies.”
The room was dark. To Harry, at least. He knew, somewhere in the back of his mind, that the room was dimly lit with flickering candles, but the blindfold across his eyes blocked out any remnant of light.
Potter hadn’t failed though. He did what he was supposed to do, and unlike cowering Draco, he succeeded.
It became a habit. Draco would head into the shower, and Harry would head to the drawer, reaching his hands in deep until they touched the stockings. His heart would race, and he’d want to yank them out and pull them over Draco’s creamy thighs, make him twirl and strut, and then return to Harry’s lap for a good fucking.
He wondered how long it had been since they’d seen each other. Years, decades even. His heart hurt just thinking about it, his mother giving up her own flesh and blood to appease the sacred family lines. How much time had been wasted over something so frivolous as pure blood.
Not that Draco mentioned any of this to anyone, including Pansy. Especially how much Potter being queer had awoken something deep inside him. Something, after weeks of wanking, he couldn’t quite admit, but he couldn’t quite ignore.
“No,” Pansy chuckled. “Got Mum to write a note for Hooch during mandatory lessons. But I would imagine, the first few feet off the ground can be scary.”
Admitting what he wanted was always hard for Harry. In the cupboard, his desires were discarded like yesterday’s breakfast, and during the war, well, thinking about his needs had just seemed... selfish. Now, however, he had someone that cared if he was happy and would move mountains to make it so.
“We can’t do this,” he said, his eyes on the grass at his feet. So green. He wanted to see green again but shook his head instead.
Draco gave a small chuckle at what I said. “No worries, there are people who can’t make the floo trip, it has something to do with the inner ear, and balance. It mostly affects those who have or are prone to ear infections. Same can be said about apparition, those two ways of travel affect the inner ear way more than a broom ride. It just seems strange with how you ride a broom that it doesn’t affect you while up in the air,” Draco said, giving me a peck on the cheek. “I will make sure next time to have a potion on hand that helps with this sort of thing.”
Levi grumbled, looking at the little black furball that was purring away on top of him, as if there wasn’t a giant snake that could eat her.
Harry quickly peered around the man to see a boy his age being pushed forward by his mother. Much like Narcissa, the boy had almost white blonde hair, and his eyes were steel gray, his skin was a sickly pale white that seemed to have never have met the outside sun. Harry gave a small wave at the young boy, very uncomfortable in this new and strange environment.
“No, NO!” I fought off the hands trying to get back into the room with Harry before one healer stepped in front of me and stopped me.
“Hmmm,” The voice whispered in his head, slipping deeper and deeper into his mind, “You’re a difficult Mr. Potter, such an interesting mind you have. Yes, ahh you have plenty of courage, and a thirst to prove yourself, but also a thirst for knowledge I see, yes. Ahh what is this, a snake inside your mind very interesting; the question is where to put you.” The hat whispered in his mind, thinking of the best house. “I believe this house will be the best for you pulling out all your potential you have hidden up here.” The hat spoke one last time before the rip opened up and shouted, “SLYTHERIN!”
At that, the Giant looked a little hurt, knowing that the headmaster promised all those years ago that he could take Harry.
Of course tonight was a lucky night for Harry who was able to escape this night without a single hand raised in his direction. His Uncle led the boy to his cupboard and locked him up for the night. Unbeknown to him of what Harry had hidden from them all. Harry knew that he couldn’t open it here no, he had to be sneaky to make sure that that never figured it out.
“You’re saying it wrong Ronald,” Hermione snapped, taking his wand hand and lowering it gingerly. “It is Wing-ger-dium Levi-o-sa, make the ‘gar’ sound nice and long.” Hermione instructed the red head.
Harry quickly scrambled to his feet just in time to see Severus climbing out of the fire place behind him. He turned his head and saw three different set of eyes all staring at him.
His Uncle Vernon and Harry Left the zoo quickly leave this Aunt Petunia to gather Dudley and have a talk to the zoo staff about what happened today. Vernon was to hide the boy way from the world and punish him before his wife ever made it home, as she didn’t like to handle or see his punishments.

“Exactly you belong to me!” The Alpha said voice rough knowing at this pace he wouldn’t last long, but it looked like his omega won’t either. Draco claimed Harry again biting down on the mark on his neck with a growl slamming one last time with such force Harry saw stars in his vison as he came hard throw his head back in as he screamed.
His Aunt quickly slammed the phone back into the receiver and glared at the boy like it was his fault.
I do hope you liked the chapter, please leave comments and kudos they really help me with writing. If you are shy or just want to talk send me an email at demondog136@yahoo.com
“What do you mean you can’t take him?” His aunt said over the phone, talking to one of their neighbors that looked after him when they didn’t want to him in the house alone.
Draco ran into the room from wherever he was looking at me scared, “what is it love?” He asked walking over to me lower himself to knelt right in front of me.
“Whatever Harry,” was Draco’s reply, before turning to his own breakfast scowling at his friend, still peeved that he had such a rude awakening. Of course it was just morning and he had all day to forgive Harry, but Draco would be getting him back for making a Malfoy act like such a fool in front of so many others.
“S-Severus, Draco was telling me about going shopping for school supplies,” Harry said taking a seat at the fancy table, looking in shock at all the food that just appeared on their plates, “I-is it okay if I join him and his father when they go shopping?”
I was sitting in the living room reading a baby book, to prepare myself for when we had a little one living under this roof, so I can be the best parent I could. Of course I will give this little one more of a childhood then I ever had, but to make sure that I did I read these books. The floo all the sudden came to life, “Hello, Harry?” I heard someone call out, I smiled realizing who it was.
“Hello Luna, welcome back home, how was South America?” I asked smiling at my old friend as she dusted off the soot that accumulated for the step through.
“Hush you foolish imp, I would rather be here for you then let you suffer alone.” Severus answered smoothly his baritone voice melting away the rest of Harry’s fear of this being the dream, and the other being reality.
“The Sorting Ceremony will be begin shortly, I suggest that you straighten yourselves up,” She said glancing around at certain students, hoping that they would get the hint. She then turned and left them standing there in anticipation, waiting for the glorious moment they would learn their houses.
Draco was wandering the halls of Hogwarts. It was tough staying in the Slytherin dorms by himself, thoughts of Crabbe who lost his life due to the war along with his Godfather plagued him. He wished - to whatever gods he could think of - not to be alone, but here he was… Alone and wandering one of the many halls within Hogwarts. That is, when he sees a warm glowing light coming from inside a room, smells of treats wafting into the hall. He thought he might as well look inside to see what was going on.
Time seems to by flying by everyone, after meeting with the Dark Lord, they settled down into a routine; the test, homework, and classes day in and day out. Harry and Draco let the stone slide to their back of their thoughts for the time being, enjoying being first years. They spent their time either studying with Hermione and Neville in the library or underneath the tree near the lake. The twins wouldn’t be left out when their Kitten was with the other lion cubs, so they joined in, if only to come up with pranks for their brother; Ron when he was sprouting nonsense about the Slytherin house targeting Harry specifically, or Percy who just had a stick up his arse, the twins enjoyed plotting with their small Kitten. Harry was enjoying the time with his friends, even sessions with Alec where mostly about his close group of friends and what they are doing around the school. Since talking about the muggles was still hard for Harry, but he was getting there. Some sessions where better than others, sometimes they would talk about his old guardians, others were strictly about what had happened lately. Harry thought by this summer he might be able to fully open up to Alec and tell him what happened there, or at least that is what he was hoping.
Harry shivered at what Ollivander said, not sure on how he felt, that the murderer of his family, carried the brother of his wand. He thanked Ollivander and payed for the wand before stepping out of the shop, lost in the dark thoughts that now entered his mind because of what Ollivander had said. It was late now, and Severus and Lucius had joined back up with the group, it was then that they called it a day. With goodbyes said, they departed Diagon Alley, and returned home to see the treasures the trip had produced.
Narcissa cleared her throat to get Severus attention before speaking, “Severus I want you and young Harry to come over to the Manor tomorrow at dinner.” Severus open his mouth to protest.
Severus was unhappy, and worried, his charge was out past the curfew that they had set. Harry had not once missed the dead line, there had been some close calls, but he was always back into their quarters right on the dot. So, when Severus heard the door slamming closed, he stalked to the door to give the child a stern talking to, but when he stepped into the living area of the quarters, something was wrong. The raven-haired child was not right there stammering out an apology, those bright green eyes begging Severus to let him go this one time. No, instead that child was slumped on the floor in a heap, those eyes hidden behind a black curtain of hair. Severus face turned from sneer of annoyance, to an expression of worry and fear; it has been awhile since the last time he saw Harry like this, and it scared him to no end. He quickly made his way over to the boy, scooping the small child into his arms and taking him to the black leather couch that sat in front of the fire. He held the child close, pressing one of Harry’s ears to his chest.
Mr. Malfoy (I still could not bring myself to call him his given name just yet) said we would wait and see since we have no idea how long it would take to talk to the goblins.
Soon rough hands where spreading Harry’s arse cheeks apart allowing Draco to gaze upon the pucker hole that is just shimmering in slick as his omega gasp and press his arse back towards the alpha. Draco just chuckled and inserted two fingers into the twitching hole grinning when heard Harry moan and Harry to clench greedy around the two digits wanting the to go deeper to fill him. Draco twisted and spread his small omega open as Harry tried to rock back but his other hand pressed into his lower back preventing him to move as the Alpha prepped the Omega. At least during heat preparation wasn’t need but Draco loved to watch Harry squirm below him as he grew close to his orgasm on his fingers alone. Draco add a third finger and brush against Harry’s prostate causing a strangle moan to erupted and his hips to stutter in the little movement he had.
They entered the classroom, the door slamming shut behind them, making Harry flinch, his eyes darting everywhere, looking for a way out.
“What the hell?! Malfoy what the fuck are you doing here and where the fuck is the door?!” Harry said, looking wildly around for an escape. He knew Malfoy was innocent in everything, because he was just a kid stuck on a side (much like himself)… It’s just he couldn’t be in the same room as him.
Draco was confused to say in the least, it was very impolite of people to hide behind others like the dark raven haired boy was doing. Draco stopped at for a moment evaluating the younger boy, who was hiding behind his uncle Sev. The boy had longish raven hair that seemed to stick up in random spots, his eyes were a gemstone green, but other than that, Draco couldn’t tell much about the boy since his baggy clothes seemed to just hang off his person. One thing he knew for sure was the boy was very small, he didn’t really look to be about Draco’s age at all, but resembled an eight or nine year old.
“Please wait a few moments Sirs, the goblin in charge should be here shortly.” Ironfist said, leaving the three wizards to talk amongst themselves while they waited.
Harry just clung tighter to the man, his soon to be father, afraid that if he let go, the man would vanish and leave him behind. Severus slowly stood with Harry in his arms, then laid on the hospital bed, letting the boy relax after his scare. "Harry I need to leave to get ready for class, if I leave would you be alright." Severus asked the small child after about an hour of lying there. Harry just shrugged, he didn't want to be left alone, but he knew Severus need to go back to his job. "How about Levi comes down here and joins you? Would you be alright then?" Harry thought about it for a moment, then nodded his head, yes. If Levi was down here, he could fight off the bad men that wanted to harm Harry.
The Dark Lord was pacing around in the quarters that belong to the DADA teacher, deep in thought; thought of how he should deal with the young Potter boy. From what he had seen in both person and inside the young boy’s mind made even his dark heart shiver. It brought back so many memoires from when he was a young lad; ones that he tried to bury deep down in his mind but, one look from that boy brought them all back into the light. Much like the boy, Tom was a “happy” little boy growing up in the orphanage, or at least that is what Albus always thought of when the boy, Tom, came to him and begged not to be sent back. Tom had been a sad boy growing up, he made no friends what so ever in the orphanage, even though most were in the same boat as him, he was always the outcast, and Tom could never figure out why. Why was Tom the one being picked on? Why was all the work left for Tom to do? When something was done wrong why was Tom always to blame? Why could other kids find happiness when Darkness surrounded Tom? Why was Tom a freak?! Those questions where always running around young Tom’s mind in his younger years; when he was doing all the work at the orphanage, when all the other kids played and Tom was once again left on the sidelines, when Tom was the only one to be thrown into the basement when something “freaky” happened. It was not his fault, he did not chose to be here, he didn’t chose to go back their either. That is why he ended up where he was today, if one person took the time to get to know Tom, he would have been a happy kid. He would have never turned to the darkness in such haste as she opened up her arms and embraced her child. The one thing that was always around him was Lady Darkness always offering power, all he had to do was accept the hand and defeat those who had wronged him.
Harry understood what his friends where doing; fighting everything in their bodies, just to help him out. He couldn’t have asked for better friends, they were showing the bravery of a lion, the loyalty of a badger, but the intelligence of the raven by knowing the danger they were walking into. This is what made a snake, what made them so cunning was that they would stick close to one another, looking out for every little snake as possible and striking when the times was right. This is why they are feared, for they were smart enough to wait, they were brave when the time was right, they would loyal as one could be to each other, always in the dark waiting to see what is to come. Harry returned Gemma’s smile, hoping that it would give her some strength for what was to come.
Harry took a couple steps back from the professor, he no longer knew what to think, nor what to believe. His head was killing him, all he wanted to do was escape from here. ” I-I-I d-d-don’t know!” His hands came to his head his fingers tugging at his hair, “I-I-I can’t!” Tears were still streaming down young Harry’s face and he was all but heaving in his breaths, “What’s real anymore? G-g-give me time sir! P-Please!”
year when I entered Hogwarts, and he took me under his wing showing me about and even helped me out a lot with school work. We lost contact for a while after, and then he resurfaced asking me for some help later on, rekindling the friendship we had.” Alec smiled at Harry, “I understand that you don’t know me that much, but how about this we play a small game to get to know each other I answer one question about me and you another.” Harry thought this over,
Severus made it to the first door to find the three-headed mutt awake and growling; he couldn’t hold back the sneer that made its way to his face at the sight of the hound before him. He couldn’t have this mutt stop him from getting to his son, he was in big trouble already for even thinking about putting his life in danger without telling him. However, if what Levi showed him was true, then he would be in even more trouble. Why did people feel the need to have so many useable pawns?
Draco just pouted at his mates teasing and once he was free trapped Harry within his arms loving the gasp that the action pulled from Harry, “So rude to think it’s my fault it’s all the tensile, I swear it’s worse than the fairy lights.” Draco said with an exaggerated scoff, he enjoyed the small giggle that it pulled from Harry. He felt Harry’s hand dust glitter out of his hair causing a snow of glitter fall, Draco scowled as the glitter left his hair, but he knew that there was still a lot left, the stuff never left.

“How can I help you love,” he said wrapping his arms around my waist and giving me a kiss on my cheek.
“I-I’m S-sorry s-sir I didn’t m-mean to be,” Harry said, tears once again in his eyes, but now for a different reason. He had scared his Father, and now he might not love him anymore. Severus pulled Harry into another hug keeping the young wizard close, reminding him that he was now Severus’ son and nothing was ever going to change that for. He whispered sweet insurance into the young boy’s hair, which has become less rurally since he took the potion, reminding him of this.
“It is fine Harry, as long as you are back to talking. It gave me a fright when you weren’t talking.” Severus said, concern written on his face.
“We are sorry sir,” Harry spoke first, before the adults had a chance to speak up, “We would have been here on time, but one of us was hold up making admins to a certain Headmaster.” The young heir then bowed to the Goblin, “Please excuse our lateness, and may your gold flow freely.” The goblins that were working all looked at the group in awe, there has not been a wizard bowing before a goblin in years. Yes, this was a wizard they would continue to deal with, Harry Potter in the goblins eyes was someone who they would always help.

“B-But there is no way!” Harry said looking at the snake shaking, out of fear or nerves he wasn’t sure.
Draco moved closer to Harry a little unsure if the other wizard would allow it, “I understand what is happening, you lost your sister to a man and I lost my brother to a woman. We both feel a little misplaced.” Harry snorted raised his glass up as to toast and took a sip.
Severus was brought away from his thoughts when the very boy he was thinking about began squirming around on the bed.
Tom's reaction was more internal. Seething, thinking of ways to use his power and tools to hurt those muggles in many different ways, without them dying. Living about 11 years in the same conditions as his pseudo son.
Harry just gave a weak smile back, to show that he heard what the goblin had said, the small panic attack he had made him a little tired. “Alright let’s start with the inheritance test, to see what Family Vaults that Heir Potter will be able to have accuses to once he is of age.” The goblin placed a blank parchment down on the table along with a golden knife. “Now Heir Potter I would like for you to cut one of your fingers and drop three drops of blood on the parchment.” The goblin explained when the boy gave him a strange look unsure of what was being asked. Harry just nodded and leaned forward in Severus’s lap, taking the knife and making a small cut on his pointer finger. A small hiss escaping his lips as the blood made its way on to the parchment. Harry placed the finger in his mouth sucking away the extra blood while Severus cleaned the blade, before handing it back to the goblin.

He came sliding in on his ladder spying who just walked into his shop. “Ahh look who we have here a young Mr. Malfoy, and ahh yes young Mr. Potter. I was wondering when I would see you two in this shop, let me see ahh yes let’s start with you Mr. Malfoy. I think I got just the thing.” Ollivander muttered and he sorted through box after box of wands before choosing the one he wanted. “Here we are, try this out!” He exclaimed, handing one to Draco.
I sighed, “sadly no, I want to continue on with the Black tradition and naming them after the stars, but sadly Draco doesn’t want to do that we have talk about it a numerous of times, but so far there hasn’t been any name that has fit just yet.”
“Say Draco, how do they figure out what house you belong in?” That had been bugging Harry since figuring out that they would be sorted into house, just how did they do that? Would the professors look at you and decided what house you looked like you belong to or what?
It had been an interesting week for Harry, telling Snape only some of the things about what happened seemed to talk a huge weight off his chest. It had felt good to tell someone about all the things that took place in that house; and it also seemed to tighten the bond between the now Father and Son bonding. After everything was said and done that day, Harry had taken the potion which made Harry Severus’s son in every way. The changes that potion made would slowly change his appearance over a course of a week. So far the most noticeable thing to Harry was that his hair was no longer unruly, and was growing at a faster rate, and his tan skin seemed to pale a bit; other than that nothing else seemed to be changing.
