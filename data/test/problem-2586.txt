“Harry?”
no answer. He knocked a final time, the loudest of the three.
Harry had taken down their wedding photographs.
Draco cast his eyes around the room. What he had mistaken for a fleecy blanket was actually Harry’s robe. He felt a gentle nudge on his cheek. A teacup and saucer floated next to him, the scent of Earl Grey on the air. Tears sprung to his eyes as it dawned on him: The robe. The tea. Draco had trespassed, illegally entered Harry’s home—
“Yes, and then you spent the whole bill-reading eye-fucking across the courtroom.”
“It’ll get easier, Draco. They’ll get used to you. And you’ll get used to them again.” Embarrassed, Draco nodded jerkily, still staring resolutely at the water below. “Turn around, Draco,” said Harry. “Let me see you.”

It had taken until the end of the first match, every gust of wind causing the old wooden beams to creak and groan alarmingly, for Draco to realise exactly why Harry had chosen seats all the way up here. He pressed his point, needing Harry to
“Oh Potter, that’s not even the half of it,” smirked Malfoy, quirking an eyebrow. “Learned plenty of other things on my travels that I can teach you too, if you’re interested.”
“I told her about you, you know. When we were – near the end.”
Harry nodded, thinking of Malfoy at work – always nipping in and out of Harry’s office, spinning around on Lofts’ chair, rifling through paperwork with no regard for closed drawers – or locks, for that matter. He pictured the way Malfoy would hop onto a table in the canteen to act out some dramatic chase, or stride through the Atrium, gesturing emphatically as he talked.
Neither of them spoke. The world around them narrowed. Potter’s shallow, shuddering breathing was very loud in Draco’s ears, and he leant forward, pressing closer, testing Potter’s reaction. Potter shifted in his seat, letting out a quiet sigh. The sound jolted Draco uncomfortably out of his reverie, as he remembered that his ointment should find healing tissue and sink in automatically to help bind it together. Nothing he’d read or seen before had implied that it would work better if rubbed in; the massage was entirely a
Harry’s voice was dangerously quiet. Draco was suddenly reminded of the day he’d discovered the Occamy eggs, all those years ago, when the attic wall had collapsed from underneath him and he’d tumbled forwards into darkness. He found himself at a loss, completely unable to synchronise brain with voice.
“Yes, I was taking

had been a productive one. The future felt bright, and buoyed by his initial success he’d used his second Occamy egg and begun brewing another batch.
“Lee…?”
Afterwards, they throw the covers off and lay pressed tightly together. Harry’s thumb absently rubs over Draco’s where their hands lay on his chest. It’s what Harry does – what they’ve always done – this silly game; play-acting intimacy, as though they didn’t belong to two entirely different worlds. It’s always like this: awful and wonderful both together, and sometimes it’s too much for Draco to bear, but he gets so little human contact these days he can’t bring himself to stop.
skills weren’t all they were cracked up to be. In lieu of embarrassing himself further by saying something stupid, he wiped his arm across his glasses, smearing them horribly, and looked down at the surface of the pitch.

set out to ruin my already non-existent love life. Of course, that hasn’t stopped them. After lunch today, I expect Neville will be my boyfriend in the papers tomorrow.” He picked up one of Draco’s tiny paring knives and casually flicked it at the chopping board, scowling when it landed on its side.
“I do reckon you’re a bit mental, though,” Neville continued. “Potions is the worst part of my bloody apprenticeship. I know it sounds stupid, but I didn’t realise how much would be involved. Obviously, I knew I’d have to mix all the basic first aid stuff for the Infirmary, but Pomona brews loads of other potions too. I suppose I’d rather hoped that Snape was being a vicious bastard and I wasn’t actually all that bad.”
A bolt of orange light emerges violently from his wand with a cracking noise loud enough to wake the entire street; the wand clatters to the floor. Driven by hunger and frustration, he realises – satisfied smile faltering – that he’s probably cast just a
Surprised, Draco quickly complied. Harry swung his legs over to settle on top of the duvet, leaning back against the headboard with a deep groan, closing his eyes.
“Probably true,” agreed Draco, rubbing his belly lazily, ridges of muscles rippling beneath his shirt. It was crazy, really: the past few weeks it felt like he’d done nothing but gorge himself on Potter’s delicious cooking – gourmet-style dinners, enormous continental breakfasts and even neatly organised packed lunches filled with all Draco’s favourite goodies – but somehow the more Draco seemed to eat, the fitter he got. Why, every time he glanced in the mirror, his body seemed a little less ‘anaemic, sallow-skinned Ministry shift worker’, and a little more ‘Quidditch Weekly centrefold’. Draco had dimly wondered if Potter actually
“I know, but…”
Despite his growing anger, Draco could feel himself blushing. He clenched his fists under the table. “Sorry, how badly I
“Fair enough,” said Harry, getting to his feet. He looked around absently for his clothes, bending lazily to collect a sock from under the bed before giving up and Summoning the rest. Draco watched him, trying desperately to ignore the growing feeling that he was letting something precious slip away. As though the weekend had been some kind of wonderful illusion; as though Harry might go back to his normal life – surrounded by people who loved him, and doted on him, and didn’t hurt him like Draco had – and come to see this whole thing as one big mistake.

As it turned out, Potter’s endorsement could not have worked better for Draco; almost every single patron that first week mentioned the photograph in the paper. On top of that, the
, somehow. Draco had gotten so used to his own company over the years that, by rights, suddenly having a teenage extrovert hovering around should have been extremely irritating, but strangely he, too, found her charming. He loved to hear her chatting away to the customers, or singing as she stacked shelves, or shouting out the new orders she brought over from the Owlery. Some mornings she’d arrive looking unhappy, and brew in silence, or be snappy and sarcastic to Draco until eventually he’d convince her to put her iPod on

Back in reality, Malfoy was looking at him like he was insane. “Calm down, Potter. A cowboy,
The estate agent steps forwards, breaking Harry’s line of sight as he wipes a sweaty hand on his polyester trousers before thrusting it forwards. Draco makes his way slowly up the steps towards them; uncurling those familiar long, pale fingers. Harry can’t stop staring.
“I used to come down here. During the war.” Draco’s voice was so quiet, the whole idea so incongruous, that at first Harry wondered if he’d heard him correctly.
knew that something would come up.
“Darling, no. I loved helping you. I’m so proud of your business – you know full well you were sending me far more money than you needed to – and besides, for a long time it was all that got me out bed. It’s only that – well, these past few months, it’s all become a bit much. I’ve been… lonely, I suppose you could call it, for quite some time. I’d rather like to
’s latest theories about my love life.”
Not knowing quite how to bring it up, Draco hadn’t mentioned that Neville would be visiting. But his mother – ever the skilful hostess – greeted Neville warmly and without batting an eyelid, as though Gryffindors wandering across the Manor lawns and enquiring about the strengthening charms in her pruning shears was an everyday occurrence. His mother asked politely after Neville’s grandmother and listened patiently to his long explanation of his work at Hogwarts. When he asked whether she would mind showing him the gardens, she explained apologetically that she’d be happy to, if he would kindly bear in mind that she’d only just resumed tending the gardens – after, well, all that most
“Sorry, sorry!” Harry held his hands up. “I’ll tell you what
they even been kisses? Surely they couldn’t count – so far were they from this, this dizzyingly, maddeningly slow exploration of each other, heavy breaths mingling, Harry’s soft noises of delight as Draco gently nipped at his bottom lip. The difference, Draco realised, as Harry’s back finally hit the wall, was that tonight, for the first time, he wasn’t merely chasing his own release. No: tonight, he thought – taking advantage of Harry’s position to nudge his chin back, scraping his teeth over the stubble of Harry’s jaw – what he wanted above all tonight was to give

as a side effect.”
“We were best friends, Draco. We grew up together, lived through a
He waved his wand abruptly at Harry, who squeaked in dismay as the towel around his waist flew high into the air, settling on the floor as an ornate Persian rug.
And then, mercifully, the fire is out; fragments of charred potatoes grinning up at Harry, Formica counter-top warped and still liquid in places, and little flecks of ash dancing in the air. The smoke clears to reveal Draco, standing in the doorway, coughing.
Draco played along, clapping Ron heartily on the back. “I don’t know, Weasel, let me think. Susan, Pansy, hmm… Millie gave me a good backhander once – put me right on the floor, that did. Oh, and how could I forget your
“Me neither.” Harry swallows, blinks hard again. He knows the answer, saw it in the pain behind Draco’s eyes, felt it in every tender sweep of his fingers, but asks anyway. “Is there no chance? Nothing I can do – nothing we can try to change?”
“Fair enough,” said Malfoy, shrugging. “Shall we try and get some sleep then?”
“It’s not that I don’t
He was out buying lunch when he felt its familiar tug. He let it lead him down Diagon – past the beautiful new Firebolt Supremes gleaming in the windows of Quality Quidditch Supplies – until, to his surprise, he found himself standing outside Ollivanders, staring at its freshly painted façade.
“I… I don’t know quite how to put it.” She laughed, a high-pitched, false thing, which died quickly in the dusty room. The silence was deafening, and then she leant forwards.

Death in the prime of his life by potions misadventure did have a touch of the romantic about it, after all.

tolerable.
“So he came out of the party, and…?”
Draco nodded.
“Look,” Draco continued, “I don’t know what to say. I know nothing I say can take away what – what happened here. But my Mind Healer is always saying that avoidance never solves anything. That everything important that happens to us leaves its mark, somewhere. Sometimes it’s physical―” Draco held out his forearm, brought their joined hands to rest over the ugly, puckered skin “―and sometimes it’s all up here―” he let go of Harry’s hand, bringing his own to the side of his head “―but if you want to move forward you first have to acknowledge its presence. Make peace with your past.”
Perfect.
“As you can see, the living room’s a good size, with plenty of space for entertaining…” the agent drones on. Harry can’t help but wince slightly at his choice of words; after all, there had been no entertaining, not when they’d lived there. Harry had been so thrilled to finally be free of the press, he hadn’t wanted to take any chances of his location getting out. Draco, to his relief, had understood and hadn’t pushed him, not after the first couple of times he’d mentioned inviting over coursemates, when Harry’s discomfort had been apparent.
He’s in Apulia when they catch up with him, renting a dusty trullo from an ancient Italian woman a half mile down the track. The timing couldn’t have been worse, with the neighbours’ sideways looks finally giving way to tentative nods; even the occasional chuckle at the posh accent cutting through his rough, colloquial Italian. His delicate skin is no longer blistered scarlet, beginning to darken at last under the dry sun, and his hair curls around his nape, long enough these days to tie out of his eyes when he has to bend forward to feed the chickens. And then there’s this place, surrounded by olive trees – nowhere near the furthest he’s run, although it feels as though it might be – his little hut on the edge of the world.
She smiled at him, ruefully, tears shining in her eyes.
“I―” Harry began, but before he could finish his thought, both teams came clattering through the bushes, forcing them to spring apart even further.
Harry Potter was walking towards him, alone, wearing that same intense, inscrutable expression he’d worn all evening. Right on cue, that irritating voice in the back of Draco’s mind which had been nagging at him all night tried to start up again, telling him that it wasn’t a good idea. Exasperated, he pushed it aside. Hadn’t tonight proved it? Draco was as worthy as anyone. He could do
reverberated through the park, cutting through the birdsong and the soft murmurs of the players below, and the distinct charred-earth smell of strong magic reached Harry’s nostrils, taking him – as always – straight back to the war. He looked down to where Kingsley, Robards and Hermione had appeared in the centre of the pitch, with more Ministry officials popping up around them by the second. Startled by the sudden noise, Ron shot about a foot into the air, clinging to the hoop for support like a koala to a tree. Shah fumbled the Quaffle, shrieking and diving desperately, managing to retrieve it mere inches from the ground. The old Ministry wizard overbalanced on his deckchair, tumbling onto the damp grass in a tangle of blankets and striped pyjamas.
“So,” Draco begins, shakily, “when do you – I mean, we could go and get some food now, or –”
“No! I’ll tell the truth. I swear I’ll tell the truth, and if you don’t think I am, then…” he took a deep breath in, “then I’ll take it. But I promise you, I’ll tell the truth. Think about it – what do I have to lose?” He rubbed a hand across his aching eyes, before looking up at Harry, desperation surely written all over his face.
“Here again?”

“That’s only three more months.”
“Wish I hadn’t, now,” said Draco, honestly, taking a step closer. Harry’s eyes flicked to Draco’s still-smarting cheek, and he nodded stiffly, nostrils flaring.
“Not at school,” said Draco, slowly, although that wasn’t the whole truth, not really.
It didn’t take long for that feeling to fade. After the final comfort break, Harry and the others returned to their brooms, their moans and groans louder than ever before. Lofts was crying – loud, choking tears borne of both exhaustion and rage – as she wobbled back up into the sky. She wasn’t the only one, either – Ron’s face was suspiciously blotchy, and even Harry found himself suppressing a scream as the clock resumed its inexorable countdown: 05:59, 05:58, 05:57…
wondered, after all of Malfoy’s melodramatic warnings before the match, but any minor concerns he might have harboured had faded almost as soon as they’d taken to the skies. He was fit now, after all, much fitter than he had been back at Hogwarts. He ran each morning, spent most afternoons in the Ministry gym, was a formidable opponent on the sparring mats and still flew every week. He’d even attended training camp with the Falcons a few years back – yet another charity venture – and he was proud to say that he’d more than held his own amongst the professional athletes. If anyone could fly for an entire day and a night, it should be him, right?
Draco hadn’t been wrong about Gryffindors running in packs. Word must have gotten out that he was on good terms with Neville and Potter, because it felt like every time he turned around there was another Gryffindor in his shop. The
“When he told me that we were both as bad as each…” Draco stopped, abruptly, horribly embarrassed. “You know what, never mind.” He felt Harry’s toes curling against his under the table and looked down, uselessly, his face now almost certainly bright scarlet.
“I know.”
smile, inciting the feelings of anger and jealousy it usually did?
Maybe there
“Well, I only know what Harry said, but it sounded pretty permanent. Harry says they seized almost all of the stock. Besides, once it becomes public, their reputation will be shot.”
Draco got to his feet, rotating his aching shoulders with a sigh. He was exhausted and quite overwhelmed by the events of the day – not to mention more than a little heart-sick to have missed Harry. The room was still uncomfortably busy, so he headed off towards the door, where he found, to his irritation, that an enormous mound of coats had accumulated on top of his cloak. As he began half-heartedly sorting through it, an arm reached close around him. He stepped back, startled. Before he could turn around, a low voice murmured next to his ear.
“Any chance either of you has an idea how I can start to un-fuck-up this situation? Should I let Harry know that I don’t just want… I mean, that I want… Or maybe… is it too late?

Without another moment’s hesitation, he grabbed a handful of his robes, and in one smooth motion, pulled Harry against him. He felt the small, surprised “oh!” against his lips, and then they were kissing. Harry’s mouth opened sweetly underneath his, as Draco’s fingers curled around the nape of his neck, combing through soft black curls.

“Look,” said Harry, still staring straight ahead, dropping Draco’s arm as quickly as he’d taken it. “I didn’t say you had to leave. If you wanted to stay and watch the match – well, I mean, you bought a ticket, right? I can’t stop you.”
Now it’s Draco’s turn to look away, embarrassed, as Harry grins, a mixture of disbelief and genuine pleasure at the thought.
rather strange just how often Potter mumbled. But it was rude to point things like that out, wasn’t it? No, thought Draco, smiling indulgently at Potter, he would just have to find out Potter’s favourites some other way – maybe Weasley would tell him, or Granger?
“Did you? Merlin, Harry, how on earth did he keep it up?” came yet another familiar voice. This one sounded like long summer days in the Manor gardens. Summer days, and a gentle breeze, and the sweet smell of Moly flowers. He smiled at the thought, turning his face to try and catch some sun. The sound of his mother’s singing was drifting through his mind; the refrain of an old lullaby, maybe, over and over…
, Draco wanted to reply, but he knew where that conversation would end up, so he didn’t. “Uh, thanks? I really can’t. It looks good though,” he choked out instead.
Draco opened his mouth to protest, but Potter waved it away. “No, no, don’t get offended, I know you’re good at all this, it’s just… I’ve had a lot of experience with regenerating potions and spells, not to mention Polyjuice, and it’s mostly been… well, fucking painful, honestly. And

as ‘Death Eater Draco Malfoy’. But this – no one could see this as anything other than a horrendous invasion of privacy, a story embellished to the point of absurdity for the sole purpose of selling papers. No matter which way Draco looked at the photographs, he couldn’t see anything remotely titillating in them. Harry was out on a double date with his mate, his mate’s girlfriend, and a fairly attractive (although, in Draco’s opinion, rather dull looking) man. The photograph on the front page was the only one of them next to each other; otherwise it was just smiles and shy glances across a table.
Despite the awkward position, Draco slept much more deeply than usual. When he woke, it was to aching joints, the sound of plates being laid at the table, and the smell of slightly burnt toast. The curtains were open wide, sunlight spilling into the room, and the whole thing felt so surreal – so damned
“Sorry, I didn’t quite catch that. Want to say it a bit louder, Death Eater?”
“And how are the wards holding up?” Potter waved his hand lazily and a beam of red light shot towards Draco, striking the ward and shattering into glittering sparks, mere inches from Draco’s face.

him he enjoyed it? Had they even discussed it before? Half-formed thoughts swam in and out of his mind; little snatches of conversation, too vague for him to grasp. When he spoke again, it was less certain. “I… I’m not sure, really. I guess I just assumed he must enjoy it? He’s the youngest Deputy Head Auror ever, right? Although,” he frowned, “last night he mentioned something about being frustrated with – what did he call it? Political posturing?”
He looked around, leaning in towards Harry. “For fuck’s sake.

’s notoriously unreliable ‘scoops’, but the way Potter’s cheeks were turning red, his mouth curving up into a dopey smile, made Draco come over suddenly queasy. He packaged and handed over the salamander blood mechanically, before making blatant excuses and retreating to his lab.
Malfoy finally had the good grace to look a bit sheepish. “Listen, just because I make light of it doesn’t mean I’ve forgotten. I travelled halfway around the world to get away from being Draco Malfoy. Can you blame me for trying to make the best of things?”

Draco nodded, grimly, shivering as they wandered across the frost-covered lawn. As they approached the greenhouses, though, the air suddenly grew warm and humid, and he looked around in surprise. He was surrounded by unusual looking vegetation: an imposing silver tree laden with furry fruit, a cluster of small bushes whose branches bore bright flames instead of leaves, a seething mass of vines speckled with tiny round holes. As he watched, fascinated, a sweet-smelling viscous substance began to seep from deep within, pooling on the ground by his feet. Hannah tugged him away. “You want to be careful with that one.” She indicated the space around them. “This is Nev’s tropical bubble. I heard you brought one of those mood trees he’s always on about? Thought I’d show you where it’ll go, when it’s ready.”
They set off, Lee hanging back nervously the whole way. Draco had never known her be this quiet, and it was most disorientating. The place itself was gloomy and claustrophobic; little clusters of offices separated by endless, dimly lit, magnolia-painted corridors containing the occasional fogged-over window. It was also eerily quiet for a working day; the echo of their footsteps and the crinkle of memos zooming overhead the only thing to be heard.

Draco’s heart began to pound against his ribcage, and his breath caught in his chest. “Whatever do you mean?” he got out, in a voice which aimed for nonchalant, but came out instead as a panicked whisper.
“Radiant. Absolutely divine. A vision of perfection.”
Harry’s eyes fell on Draco – still sitting quietly on the sofa – and he chuckled. “Don’t look at me like that! I do have to go home at some point, you know?”

, letting its golden light ground him, imbue him with confidence once more, and guide his next move. And it worked. Before he knew it, Draco found himself ducking into the closest bar. To his relief, it was a bright, friendly establishment – the music emanating from within loud enough to drown out any real attempts at conversation. Caught up in a flow of bodies pushing him closer and closer to the bar, he was just wondering what he’d order, when he realised that he hadn’t thought to bring any Muggle money with him. He frowned, considering, when a hand landed gently on his arm. Draco turned his head and almost sighed with relief to find that it belonged to a handsome older man – brown hair, well-dressed, mischievous smile and sparkling green eyes. Completely non-threatening, and exactly his type.
Draco wanted to scream. This was beyond his wildest dreams. Potter still actually seemed to like him, still wanted to date him,
Harry winced. He was beginning to think that perhaps he really shouldn’t have bothered Ron with the whole Malfoy thing.

“Merlin, how awful for him,” agreed Draco. “You’re right, they’ll be writing about this for weeks. I’m sure he won’t blame you, though,” he added, spotting the hangdog look on his friend’s face.

“I know.”

“Just – there was something about the way he was looking at me. Seemed a bit… off.”
“And then – and only then, I
He sounds uncertain, unprepared, and Harry strokes his thumb reassuringly. “I can’t, not today.” He wants to – probably could, really – but something’s telling him to wait, to take his time. He’s already messed this up once, after all. “Look – why don’t you find a flat first? Get yourself sorted; get settled at work. There’s no rush. I’m not going anywhere.”
His eyelids drooped.
“Lee, will you excuse me for just a moment…?”
“And you’re a right selfish prick sometimes,” Draco snaps, turning on his heel and padding softly back to the bedroom. Harry – ankle deep in water – sways a little, gaping in his wake.
Draco fell silent as a loud clattering noise sounded from within, followed by – wait, was that a
Draco glanced around the flat quickly, pulling off his shoes and spelling them away. He hastily dimmed the wall lights and smoothed down his robes, suddenly grateful that he’d spent the afternoon tidying. A whoosh sounded behind him, his heart leaping into his throat as the Floo activated. Acting on instinct, he whirled around, pulling Harry smoothly straight from the flames into another searing kiss, his lips cutting off Harry’s gasp of surprise. Hand fisted in Harry’s robes, Draco walked him slowly backwards, pausing for a minute while Harry kicked off his shoes, laughing and cursing, before fitting their mouths back together once more.
Barely a week later, Draco found himself standing behind his cauldron, holding a tiny glistening vial up to the light. He checked it thoroughly, turning it over and over in his hand. Was the consistency perfect? Was that sediment in the bottom? But no – however hard Draco looked, he could find nothing to suggest that the potion would lead him to a sticky end. His
Draco exhaled, his breath long and slow. It couldn’t be anything other than an invitation, and Draco felt lightheaded with how badly he wanted it. With how badly

“Call me Pomona, please. I understand that Charity’s daughter – that little firecracker – she’s working with you now?” Draco nodded. “Merlin, she was wonderful today. Known her since she was a wee thing. Her parents used to bring her round for dinner sometimes. I always knew she was a special one.”

– as he presses fevered kisses against Draco’s cheeks, trying desperately to soothe him, maybe even make him forget. As if, if Harry only holds him close enough – kisses him hard enough – Draco might change his mind, call it all a horrible mistake. Even as he’s thinking it, though, Harry understands the futility. Somewhere deep inside, he realises, a part of him agrees with Draco.

Red cord winds around your hands. Weasley glares daggers as his sister wails, prostrate on the floor. Harry's spiteful nails score your palm. He drags you forward, too rough.
“I had to tell you this. I watched you, that day, and I realised…”
“Oh. Sorry.” Draco moved to withdraw. “I’ll call back later. Not a problem”
His words hang in the air, and Harry – only half-listening, once again – looks up, embarrassed. “Were you asking me a question, sorry?”

Harry doesn’t really feel like asking, not right now. He looks over at the door to the building: he’s almost there, just has to sidle past a bicycle and a pile of unopened post. The air is thin here, his throat is tight, and all he wants is to get back outside, to walk far, far away and never return.
His hand keeps going, meeting only the cool sea breeze, as Draco neatly slips out from under him, grabbing his broom and soaring back up into the evening sky. His expression is fond, though, a gentle tease, and Harry still

But the head shaving – look, let’s just say that some people get a bit shirty if they’ve shelled out a load of money and it all grows back the next day.”

is still gaping like a fish –he’s once again the picture of cool composure, all the way from his shining silver hair to the pointy tips of his oxfords. Harry’s hands instinctively fly up to his head in a pointless, belated effort to smooth down his damp, flyaway mop of curls. Draco’s eyes follow him, and Harry swears one corner of his mouth curls up into the barest hint of a bemused smile.
“I don’t know, really. I don’t think… I don’t think wanting came into it. I didn’t think about whether I wanted it, it was just something that I knew would be expected of me, when the time came. I didn’t look forward to it, if that’s what you mean. I had seen other people take it, I knew it would hurt, and―”
Suddenly dizzy, Draco leant sideways, resting his cheek against the wall tiles and closing his eyes.
He looked over at Potter, whose eyes were transfixed on the bead of ointment as it rolled around Draco’s palm. “Trousers down,” Draco said, with a smirk.
The food is terrible. He pokes miserably at his beetroot burger, charred pink on a bed of green stalks. “Not one word,” mutters Harry. Draco huffs past the reluctant forkful of kale hovering before his lips.
Their cocks slid together easily, deliciously, as Harry pressed his face into Draco’s shoulder, and Draco curled an arm around his back, holding him close. He reached down, dipping one finger in between Harry’s cheeks, listening closely for the hitches in his breath – all the little tells he’d learned – and basking in Harry’s whispered encouragement –
Harry could hear the smile in Malfoy’s voice. “You’re on.”
Potter snorted. “If it works, I should get a share of the profits.”
“I really, truly don’t.”
Harry let out a long-suffering sigh, reaching for the door handle. “Wait,” said Hermione, stopping him with a firm hand to the shoulder. “You’re going straight in? Don’t you want to go over to the Manor, have a look around the lab first?”
Harry hummed cheerfully as he tugged his old Hogwarts robes over his head. He tied the familiar scarlet and gold fabric around his neck, and snatched up the Spellotaped glasses from his bedside drawer. He combed a little gel through his hair with his fingers – less authentic, perhaps, but it drove Draco mad – and grinned as he looked in the mirror. Perfect. He grabbed a handful of Floo powder before pausing, one foot in the flames.

“A-and you take it at night too?”
“I – uh –”
“Why not, though?” Lee’s voice was muffled through several layers of wool, as they hurried carefully down the freezing cobblestones of Diagon Alley. Draco was wearing his thickest winter cloak and Lee was bundled up in an endless blue knit scarf, her golden curls pinned high on the top of her head. He had cast a warming charm over the both of them, but it was struggling to hold in the sub-zero temperatures. Lee was clinging onto his arm like her life depended on it as she tottered precariously along the ice in strappy heels.
“Fuck, Draco, you look so―”
Draco leant forward and moved away from the pillar. A smile stole across his face as he stood at full height, facing Potter.
“Was it?” Potter asked, his eyes following Draco’s fingers as they stroked lightly over his wrist.
which Neville had left lying around, and had even vaguely considered trying his hand at baking.
“Oh, I’m sure. It’s not―” He took a deep breath, which hissed past his clenched teeth as he chose his next words “―not something I ever thought I’d have to relive.”
-augmented anticipation that he could hardly listen to a word Potter was saying. Instead, he found himself standing just a little too close, laughing a smidge too loud, even inventing orders which would require him to lean over Potter for ingredients – so desperate was he for a repeat of Sunday evening.
Neville’s party was an unmitigated disaster. In hindsight, Draco realised, he had been an idiot not to see it coming. The first problem was the stupid gift: desperate for something – anything – to distract his mind from its fruitless ruminations, Draco spent weeks looking for the perfect engagement present. After hours studying herbology books and long discussions with Lee, he finally settled on buying them a mana-tree, a sturdy thing whose appearance and produce changed depending on the mood of those around it. But of course, the reason Neville didn’t already own one was because they were ancient, and rare, and only grew in the Pacific Islands. So getting hold of it was a total nightmare, and he’d almost exhausted all his sources – and the little spare money he’d managed to accumulate – before he found someone willing to help. And somehow, between that and the nervous anticipation of seeing Harry again, Draco somehow managed to overlook the little fact that he’d deliberately avoided any social situations like this since he came off the
Lee blushed and looked away. “Thank you.” She always appeared slightly starstruck by Hermione, and perhaps a tad scared, as well. Not without reason, Draco mused, recalling a stinging blow to the cheek all those years ago.
Unable to hear any more, Draco ducked his head back inside, turning to Harry desperately.
Harry grabbed his free hand, squeezing it tightly. “I remember, Draco, of course I do. But I still don’t understand why―”
kind of thing.
other…”
Draco shrugged, unable to speak. He felt as though he’d taken a Bludger to the chest, his mood plummeting from elated to shattered in just a few seconds. Harry must have noticed his expression, because he patted him on the arm, brow furrowed, eyes – to Draco’s horror – filled with sympathy.
Draco had always had an aptitude for Potions. He was sure that the other houses thought that Snape was biased in his treatment of the Slytherins – and maybe that was true – but Draco was certain that his own high marks had nothing to do with nepotism. The final confirmation in that regard had been his N.E.W.T.s, which he had taken remotely earlier in the year. He’d brewed his final exam potion in the tiny lab he’d set up next to the wine cellar while the examiner from the Ministry watched his every move, face screwed up as though Draco smelled of Crup shit. If Draco had made a single wrong move, he knew that bastard would have delighted in marking him down, and it was with a great deal of satisfaction that, when the two hours were up, he’d been able to hand in his vial of Dreamless Sleep, shimmering violet and faultless in appearance.
seemed to give him a preternatural instinct for how to best serve each customer, and not one person left empty-handed. Witches and wizards who might have been visiting just to gawp at the Death Eater suddenly remembered that they were all out of Sleeping Draught or Doxycide, and exited the shop with a paper bag in their hand and a smile on their face. Almost as surprising to Draco was the fact that none of the patients had hexed, cursed or even raised their voice to him. In fact, people had been downright complimentary, praising him for his tenacity, his hard work and his good business sense.

A young man, short and of solid build, turned from where he was chatting with the bartender. He hopped off the stool, a wide grin on his face as he loped over. “All right, guys?”
Potter set the chopping board down, looking thoroughly unconvinced. Draco swallowed. “How’s… er,  Will, wasn’t it? How’s he coping?”
“Well,” replied Harry, “I guess that’s up to us.”
“Well, he is! You are, aren’t you?”
“Really, it’s no trouble. It’s no good for my head right now though, bending down like this.” He stepped back, waving Draco through. “Apologies for the state of the place,” he said cheerily.
“Draco?”
– down Draco’s shaft. Draco screwed his eyes shut, toes curling involuntarily as he struggled with every fibre in his being to stay still. And then, just as he was certain he couldn’t bear another second, Harry let out a long, shaky breath, planting his hands firmly over the scars on Draco’s chest, and began to move.

He immediately renewed his own numbing charm, and Harry sighed loudly, his eyes pleading, but Malfoy shook his head. “For that six out of ten, Potter, your aching arse can suffer a little while longer. Anyway, next one’s yours. Let’s see if you can do better.”
that night―”
Draco recalled that, once upon a time, there had been a reason why he didn’t want to get involved with Potter. Right now, he couldn’t have named it if his life had been at stake. He’d turned Potter down, over and over, and somehow the man still wanted him. And he looked like
Cradling it against his stomach, Draco stumbled out to the bedroom. The tapping was so loud and abrasive it felt like it was actually inside his head, and he looked around for the source. It was Megaera, her long talons scraping against the glass. Draco sighed: of course, he’d missed lunch with Mother. He opened the window, the wind blowing warm rain against his face, and hopped aside to avoid an impatient peck to his shoulder. As expected, his mother sounded very worried, asking him to Floo-call as soon as possible. Instead he scribbled a short, messy note mentioning a Quidditch accident – not to worry, a very minor bump, but he needed his rest, of course he’d call her when he could – tied it to Megaera’s leg and watched with relief as she flew off, buffeted side to side by the growing wind.
Harry laughed. “Actually, no. Never thought of doing it before. Didn’t even know I could. Lucky for you I got the pressure right, huh?”
to smooth the edges, it was raw and messy, with a little too much tooth and not enough finesse. But Harry didn’t seem to mind – in fact, he gave as much as he got, eyes crinkling affectionately when Draco’s overenthusiasm eventually forced him to pull away, clumsily gasping for air. As Harry leant in, chasing Draco’s lips once more, he grabbed at the sofa for balance, accidentally pulling off the covering sheet. A thick cloud of dust rose from beneath it, and they broke apart once more, coughing.
As was Draco, come to think of it.

beady eyes. More than once she caught Draco’s gaze as he dragged his eyes away from Potter, and raised her eyebrows suggestively, or looked back and forth between the two of them with an exaggerated wink.

Harry, on the other hand, apparently oblivious to Draco’s discomfort, seemed engrossed by the action. He shook his head in disgust at the Wasps’ Beater’s cheating, jumped to his feet and grabbed his Omnioculars to track the Seekers as they dropped into a spectacular dive, and shouted encouragement to the hapless Chasers. It was confusing, for Draco, being so close to Harry after so long but unable to reach out, to speak to him – even to look at him, really. He felt discombobulated, agitated, shaky from all the unspent adrenaline still fizzing through his body, unsure what might happen next.
“Yes. I… I have to go home.”
He still didn’t move.
His face must have reflected his distress, as she hastily tried to retract her words. “Oh, Draco, no! Of course I shan’t leave, not if it’s going to be difficult for you.”

and Draco
A frustrating week, so, come five o’clock, when Draco catches up to Harry in the endless queue for the Floo, puts his hand on Harry’s shoulder, and speaks – the longest sentence either of them has said all week, no less – Harry wastes no time in swivelling on his heel and making straight for the stairs.
You saw Scorpius off this morning: sixteen and almost your height already, a tangle of long limbs and smiling blue eyes. He has your colouring, of course, your bone structure; but as he scrambled onto the train, face shining bright with joy, it’s clearer than ever where the similarities end. Six times now you’ve watched Scorpius pull the carriage door open, slump down in the seat next to Albus Potter. Six times you’ve stood just metres away from his father. Just six occasions of forced proximity over twenty long years, and it never gets easier. Today was worse than usual.
After dancing for what felt like hours, Draco finally managed to escape the floor, where he was instantly grabbed by Hermione Granger and corralled into a discussion about the rights of Wizarding-Adjacents. After that, he was pulled aside by an old friend of the family, asking after his mother. While walking to the bar, he was accosted by one of the senior Healers from St Mungo’s, who started loudly extolling the virtues of Draco’s salve to his colleagues and everyone around them.
“No. You shouldn’t.”
As afternoon faded into evening though, Draco had to sadly concede that – ridiculous fake dates aside – Neville had been right. In a lot of the memories he’d accessed, Harry had seemed troubled, even downright miserable, with Draco and Lee doing their level best to help cheer him up.
“It’s just―” Malfoy shifted slightly, leaning forward and looking at the ground below as he spoke, “―well, I can’t help but notice that while I’m kicking arse as Head of our Field Division, and your mate Weasley’s in line for Head Auror – not to mention Little Miss Smarty-Pants in her lovely new Deputy Minister’s robes, you’re – well, Potter, you’re… not. You’re still sent out on the beat, sharing an office, doing all the grunt work, right?”
Draco drew his knees up to his chest defensively, dropping his head forward onto them and wrapping his arms around himself, trying to ignore the shudders running through his body. It was the very question he’d been asking himself since the second the bathroom door had closed behind Harry last night.

they’d done plenty of. Draco, still wary of Muggles and, well, anything he didn’t understand, had strongly protested when Harry had suggested buying a telly, moaning the whole way around John Lewis and refusing to help him carry the box. Within weeks, though, he had the TV guide memorised, and after that they spent many an evening on the sofa, Draco keeping up a running commentary over London’s Burning, or Heartbeat, or – his absolute favourite – Casualty. Each Saturday night they’d eat takeaway off their laps, trying to guess who’d get injured and how. Draco would sit up straight, eyes wide, laughing loudly at the Muggles and their primitive attempts at Healing. They’d dozed off together afterwards like that, countless times; Draco tactile as always, body curling instinctively around Harry’s.
, he never managed to ask.
“Went straight down the toilet,” said Harry, ignoring Draco’s bitten-off squeak of rage. “I can’t say I’m exactly sorry about disposing of it, although I expect I’ve lost you some money.” A strong hand landed on his shoulder, guiding him to the rim of the bath. He sat, and Harry squatted down in front of him. “Are you going to be sick again, do you think?”
“Ah.” It made sense. He’d had a Glamour on for travel; hadn’t known whether removing it as the Portkey activated would work. It had been his only option at the time.

It was rather hard to tell if Malfoy’s nose was completely straight again, she found, watching him spin past her giddily once more, but at least there were no longer droplets of blood flying around the room. A quick diagnostic revealed a cracked rib – easily mended – alongside a litany of older injuries, most of which bore signs of rushed or inexpert attempts at healing.
Draco shrugged. “Whatever.”

In that moment, he could have cheerfully
It was getting late now, past bedtime really, though neither of them dared to say it. The remains of the takeaway Harry had picked up from Chinatown had been banished to the kitchen, and so they sat, bodies curled together, deep amongst the squishy leather cushions of what used to be Draco’s antique armchair. Harry traced the whorl of velvety hair at Draco’s crown with a finger, as Draco tried desperately not to yawn.
“Exactly. It’s really not fair to blame him for something he doesn’t remember.” She turned back to Draco. “Listen to me. Harry spent years talking to you,
Malfoy’s eyebrows had risen so high that Harry could no longer see them underneath his fringe. “Yep,
“I need to see how it interacts with the skin, obviously. Remember, you’re my – what did you call it? Giddy pig?”
He instinctively took a step back, heart hammering in his chest. Wiping the dust from his eyes, he checked, and checked, and checked again. For sitting right in the middle of the imposing wooden cabinet, silver and shining and as beautiful as anything he’d ever seen, were five large Occamy eggs.
“I know. I knew I reacted badly. This is all new for me too, and I’m trying. I want so much to be good for you, Harry. God, I want it to be perfect, but I know… I know that it can’t be. You’ve seen the worst parts of me, Harry. Every time I remember what I did, I feel unworthy of… of this kind of thing.”
“I have what? Nothing?”
“First off, this lovely flat’s
Getting down to the front door was easier said than done, when one had consumed half a bottle of Firewhisky, had only one working arm, and lived in a flat with the world’s steepest staircase. Draco glanced warily at the stone floor at the bottom and began shuffling down on his bum, wand tucked into his trousers. It was only then that he realised he hadn’t even looked in a mirror since he’d woken up. He was barefoot and still wearing his Quidditch outfit, complete with bloodstains up one side. Brilliant.
Lost for words, Harry indicated the leaf pile beside them.
“What things?”
was better,
As time went on, Draco found himself buying in pastries or sweets to share, or storing up anecdotes he knew Potter would find amusing. Sometimes he still caught Potter looking at him strangely, as if something about him was out of place. But altogether he found himself enjoying Potter’s company – and if he was being honest with himself, it didn’t hurt that the company came in such a pleasing package, either.
“You know,” drawled Malfoy, “I have to disagree. It’s the
“Great. I’ll need your address, though.”
“Cheers. I’ll see you,” said Potter, too quickly, already halfway out of the store. He left, striding quickly off down the alley, without looking back.
The small blue door comes into view: tucked between a grocery store and a boulangerie, it opens, as always to reveal a dark stairwell. Fourth floor, the man told them, and you watch as they climb silently together, hands brushing as they pass each floor. Young Draco glances quickly over at Harry, and you recall how you were back then: lightheaded with anticipation, unsure if you’d even make it to the top. Harry must feel the same, because he has his wand out before they reach the landing. With a bang the apartment door is open, and he’s dragging young Draco inside, hands fumbling with fastenings, teeth dragging lightly over his neck. You follow, sliding in just before the door slams shut, eyes on your younger self as he falls easily to his knees.
Draco’s chest rises and falls, calm and steady, against Harry’s side. But Harry – suspended between land and sea, between nothing and

It was ironic, he thought, how intrinsic the Weasleys were to his business success. George and Ron had finally opened their Hogsmeade branch, and their ingredient requirements were increasing exponentially. They were so short on time that they even asked Draco to help refine some of their newest products. That was how, in a turn of events almost too bizarre to be believed, Draco found himself putting the finishing touches to George’s ‘Heroes of Hogwarts’ range: bright, fruit-flavoured potions which gave the drinker a temporary – and deliberately crude – resemblance to school-age Potter (messy hair, glasses, scar), Granger (bushy hair, high-pitched voice), Weasley (orange hair, freckles) or Neville (blond hair, chubby face, buck teeth).
, you said.”
Draco’s cock was so hard it was almost painful, the friction as he leant forwards nearly too much to bear. He glanced down for just a second, intending to adjust his underwear, but stopped, fascinated, at the sight of his hand pressing against the straining black fabric of Harry’s pants. Tentatively, he ran a finger along Harry’s stomach, just above his waistband. Harry let out a loud, wanton moan, his hips beginning to buck faster. Emboldened, Draco slipped his hand beneath the elastic, curling his fingers around Harry’s firm length, adjusting his grip and giving a couple of hesitant strokes. To his surprise, Harry swore loudly. His prick twitched against Draco’s palm, and he fisted his hands tightly in Draco’s shirt.
The night was eerily quiet by the time they landed for the next comfort break, with no spectators left and only the grunts and groans of the players – mostly sprawled out face down on the grass – and the rustling of foliage, to be heard. The creaky old Ministry receptionist had transfigured his stool into a deckchair and his hat into a nightcap, and was ignoring everyone else completely, taking small sips of what appeared to be a tiny snifter of sherry.
“I do,” Lee said. “Fuck knows why, but I do believe you. I know you’re not like that. Or – I think I know? It’s just – it was
The boy’s voice – already nasal and grating – increased steadily in volume. Heads were starting to turn, and Draco winced, raising his hands in surrender. “No, I―”

ran an ‘expose’ on Draco’s friendships, accusing him of using potions to dupe Neville, Ron and company into associating with him. Of course, that hit very close to home, and Draco wallowed in misery for days before Neville himself told Draco that if he didn’t pull his head out of his arse, the
Unbidden, his treacherous brain brought forth a memory he’d long managed to suppress. He tried to push it away, but he didn’t have the willpower.
She raised her eyebrows. “I won’t pretend that it was all your father, Draco – I was exactly the same, growing up. Maybe I didn’t have your father’s lust for power, or my sister’s vicious streak. Maybe I wouldn’t have let myself become quite so entangled in the Dark Lord’s schemes, but my views on blood purity, on Muggles…” She pressed her lips together, knuckles white around the stem of her glass. Draco knew what she meant. They’d been his views too, once, after all. Before Lee. Before Harry.

’s reassuring touch. This was the biggest crowd he’d seen for a very long time, and he’d certainly never walked amongst so many Muggles. His family’s loudly professed prejudice, he knew, sprang mostly from a deeply rooted fear of the unknown. What if these Muggles saw straight through his disguise, knew him instantly to be an imposter? What would they do to him then?
“No, no,” he said, quickly, “Hermione will be fine.”
Despite himself, despite all his reservations – despite his own rejection of Potter – Draco found himself breathlessly awaiting the man’s next visit to his shop. Potter might have agreed to let things lie, but he’d followed that straight up with a tease that said he would do anything but. To Draco’s immense frustration, the alcohol had left his memory of their almost-kiss a blur; he even considered spending Galleons he didn’t have on a Pensieve so he could relive it. It wasn’t that Draco had changed his mind exactly, but Merlin, he couldn’t remember wanting anything so badly before in his entire life. A little bit of flirting with danger couldn’t hurt, could it? So long as he could keep his head.
and let Theo push him down against his pillows. Draco rolled his hips as Theo straddled him and began biting his way up Draco’s neck. He licked the shell of Draco’s ear, letting out a soft moan.
“Of course.”
“I do.”
Neville, for his part, had passed his apprenticeship, chosen to stay on at Hogwarts, and now shared all Herbology teaching responsibilities. His Potions abilities had definitely improved, he told Draco, but he was very happy to leave the more complicated stuff to Professor Sprout, preferring to spend his free time working on novel techniques for grafting and budding together different species. Several times, he’d offered to show Draco his work if he wanted to Floo over on a weekend, but Draco always declined.
“Of course he is. Would you be able to pass on a message for me, do you think?”
Squashed on a hard bench in the cold, unsettling atmosphere of the courtroom, Hermione’s introductory speech – which Draco had heard at least five times already – seemed to drag on endlessly, as Lee grew ever more tense beside him. It was fairly excruciating for Draco too, as he tried with all his might to avoid sneaking glances over at the benches opposite where Harry was sat. Well, no more than every couple of minutes, anyway.
feelings, you know. About Squibs,” he finished, lamely.
“Yeah. Thank you.”
“Right.”
“Morning.”
“Word on the grapevine is that she’s becoming quite the catch. Dean says half the boys on Diagon are fighting over her.”
Neville looked confused. “Doesn’t remember what?”
His mother’s face was piteous, her words too earnest for Draco’s ears. As she spoke, her wedding band reflected the soft light of the sconces; a shimmering golden line, dancing in front of his eyes. His own shame sprang painfully into his chest. He bent down once more, gathering her in his arms.
As Professor Sprout patted Bryn proudly on the shoulder, an abrupt realisation dawned on Draco, and he beamed at the pair of them.
The first thing Draco saw was a mop of blonde curls gathered up into a messy bun at the back of her head. The second was a stern face, pointy chin held high and thin lips pressed into such a tight line that she could have been a long-lost Malfoy, were it not for her outfit, which was a scruffy Muggle thing – like jeans, but coming up to her chest, with straps over the shoulders. Her hands were in her pockets, and she was scuffing her feet back and forth on the floor, her haughty look belied by this obvious sign of nerves.
He walked a short distance, letting
“No worries. Good luck with the shop, Malfoy. See you soon, hopefully.” He left the lab, and a few seconds later Draco heard the door to the store chime again. He turned to Neville.
“Yeah.”
The hissing was getting louder now. In fact, it sounded like it was coming from underneath the bed itself. It couldn’t be anything good, whatever it was, thought Draco, abstractly. Had he left something unstable brewing down in the lab? He should really go and sort it out. Now, if only he wasn’t stuck to this damn bed.
… literally the entire time I’ve known you. How you made fools of all of us. And it’s not just the lying, Draco. That
all the nerves, and…”
Lee’s reply was indignant; Draco could practically hear her hands settling on her hips as she responded. “Who are you?”
– and that could never happen. Pansy was as sharp as a tack when it came to uncovering secrets, and she knew Draco as well as anyone – it would be a disaster. That left the weekends, then. Yes, better to arrange a weekend meet up – play things down and wait for her to get bored with his lack of gossip.
The agent finally produces the keys, but – of course – the door doesn’t just
with him? It sounded like it, but he couldn’t be certain. It had been a long time since anyone had, after all. Should he brazen it out and flirt back? Ignore it completely? He had absolutely no idea, and could only hope that
If Draco had been hoping that drinks at the Leaky might be a quiet affair, he was quickly dispelled of the notion as they approached the pub. Plenty of people were milling about outside in the heated courtyard area, and there was raucous laughter from within. His chest instantly grew tight, and he clenched his jaw, footsteps slowing as he glanced around, looking for a way out. Before he could make his excuses, Lee took hold of his arm and forcefully dragged him through the doors.
“So, the Dark Mark, yeah? Bet you were really proud the day you got that done, eh? Something you’d wanted for a while?”
“What Neville meant?”
“Harry…”

“Oh, sure. Of course.” Harry flicks his wrist to turn the wireless back up, his fingers moving to resume combing through the fine white silk of Draco’s hair. “How’s it all going, anyway?”
“Is it? I knew you weren’t well. I knew things weren’t right, that you were ill, and getting worse, especially over those last few weeks. You looked awful, Draco. You were losing weight, talking too fast, clearly not yourself. And even knowing all that, I still let you… well, you know.” Harry bit his lip, staring intently at the floor.
Lacking the focus that the N.E.W.T.s had provided, Draco drifted through the days aimlessly. He’d briefly reflected on his other talents and come up with only two. His childhood dream of playing professional Quidditch had already seemed laughable given the disaster of his Potions applications, and was even more ridiculous now after a year of lounging around the Manor stuffing his face with comfort food. And then there was Occlumency, which he had briefly considered as a foundation for a career in the Unspeakables, but which on further thought just reminded him of his Aunt Bella and made him want to vomit.

The most pressing issue was that of supply. Many of his regular suppliers no longer wished to be associated with the Malfoy name, while others wrote to inform him of a sudden inability to obtain ingredients. Of the few who remained, almost all had increased their prices, with some explicitly accusing Draco of duping them into keeping rates low. All in all, the only full deliveries he’d received during his absence were from his mother at the Manor, and the Dragon Sanctuary in Romania, who, to Draco’s surprise, had continued sending their regular parcels without comment.
He thinks Draco will land there – on the beach, maybe – but he doesn’t. Instead he takes them far out over the waves, balancing precariously as he removes and shrinks his shoes and socks, rolls his trousers up – Harry follows suit – and swoops down towards the foamy surface. The sea is a dirty teal colour, but the spray is pleasant enough, and they take turns flying low as they dare, skimming their feet through the surf, following the larger waves as they roll slowly in, darting upwards just before they break. Feeling cocky, Harry hangs upside down, aiming to wet his hair but ending up with a faceful of the freezing North Sea. Draco drags him out, eyes dark with concern until the second Harry’s stopped spluttering, when he cuffs him on the back, drawls
For a split second, Draco wondered how on earth he was going to answer, but before he could even begin to formulate an appropriate response, he found himself speaking.
,” he hissed.
“What? Potter, you already…”
But, in the next instant, Potter sat down in the chair, expression neutral. Draco looked at him carefully, but couldn’t see even the barest flicker of suspicion in his eyes. He breathed a sigh of relief as he moved to stand between Potter and the Disillusioned
As Harry cast a wandless warming charm, apparently in lieu of bothering with a cloak, Draco went to find Lee. She was less than thrilled to see him, interrupting his, “Are you sure you’ll be okay to―” with a quick “
“Yeah,” said Theo, running the back of a shaky hand across his lips. His wavy hair was sticking out at the sides, and his cheeks were flushed. It was a weirdly familiar picture, as though Draco had blinked and found himself in 1997 again, and he had to fight down a slightly hysterical urge to laugh. Theo continued, speaking slowly, a bewildered expression on his face. “Yeah. It wasn’t – I was just coming in to buy some dittany, I swear. I don’t know… I don’t know what happened. I got your letter; I knew that you weren’t…” He shook his head. “I’m sorry. I guess it must have just been old habits or something.”
“What?”
“I don’t know,” counters Draco, eyebrow raised. “You’ve had fifteen years of chasing me – what about you?”
Potter cut in quickly. “Oh, please, I don’t need to hear all that rubbish again. I mean, not that your letter was rubbish, I just―” he broke off with a sigh. “Just don’t, all right.”
“…and then they asked if I already had a source of Graphorn horn as they used to work in the Alps, and…” Draco’s voice petered out as he noticed the glazed-over look on Neville’s face. “Neville? Hello?” He waved his hand in front of Neville’s face, causing him to drop the forkful of cake which he had seemingly forgotten halfway to his mouth. It clattered against the china, making Neville jump.
Draco frowned. “Of course he likes his job.”
“No sign of that hole you made in the bedroom wall, either…” he throws back recklessly. To his embarrassment he feels his cheeks grow warm. But if Draco notices, he doesn’t react.
“All right, so maybe Transfiguration isn’t my greatest strength.”
. The shade too was changing shape: rounding out, stretching, twisting hideously from side to side.
“Right,” agreed Harry distractedly as Malfoy bent forwards to adjust his kneepads. He swayed from left to right, the fabric of his leggings pulling tight over his arse as he moved. Fortunately, the slow creep of Malfoy’s overenthusiastic numbing charm meant Harry hardly felt Ron’s sharp elbow to the ribs.
three months.”
It was purely the shock of finding out Potter was interested in men, Draco decided. It wasn’t that he had never thought about Potter in that way before – in fact, Potter had featured prominently in his wanking fantasies since their days at Hogwarts. But he’d been chock full of self-loathing back then, and the theme of those little daydreams had always been more ‘fuck his stupid speccy face’ than ‘gaze at him lovingly across a dinner table’. Draco was quite used to the former; he wasn’t sure he was at all comfortable with the latter. It must have been all this time spent with only his right hand for company, turning his brain all weird and sappy.
Draco relaxed slightly as she settled into the tirade. Stroppy, demanding Lee felt like familiar territory and – from what Draco could remember – was usually easily soothed. That other Lee, the scared, wounded child, was a different matter entirely. He sincerely hoped he never saw that Lee again.
Draco smiled, fondly. “Oh, she’s good. She keeps me on the straight and narrow, trust me. Told me she’d cut my balls off if she even suspected me of using again. I don’t doubt it either.”
The nights remained a struggle. Hannah removed the tube from his arm, explaining that she wouldn’t be giving him any more sedatives or hypnotics, because his body needed to get used to sleeping without the aid of potions. As a consequence, Draco’s sleep was restless and light; years’ worth of suppressed nightmares spilling out of his damaged brain, and he frequently woke up screaming. From what Draco could make out, Neville and Hannah were staying in his spare bedroom. He wondered occasionally, guiltily, what commitments they’d had to rearrange.

whispered a poisonous voice in the back of his mind.
Frustrated, Draco waved his arm. “Go ahead.”
The funeral took place in the Manor grounds, just the two of them and the Ministry wizard who conducted the ceremony. Draco and his mother stood side-by-side, not quite touching. There was no eulogy and no crying. Draco watched as raindrops gradually darkened the stone of the newly transfigured tomb and wondered if his mother was thinking the same as him: how much his father, ever infatuated with displays of pomp and circumstance, would have loathed it all.
Draco shook his head. “I can’t. I need to stay. For Lee.”

Harder to deceive would be Collins, Draco’s probation officer, who visited once a month and inspected the house from top to bottom, running his finger along the top of portraits and peering under tables in a blatant attempt to drag out an easy job as long as possible. After hours spent traipsing sullenly around the estate, he would stand over Draco and check his wand to ensure everything cast was Ministry approved, shooting him threatening looks throughout as though he expected to find an Unforgivable hidden amongst the household spells. The man was a jobsworth, and a pain in the arse, and was bound to stick his nose in any business Draco had. So how on earth would Draco explain his tiny N.E.W.T.-level lab being in constant use? And what if Collins recognised the

“You go ahead, I just want to check something in this book. Cheers for lunch.”
Draco didn’t stick around to hear her answer. With his head down to avoid attracting attention, he rounded the corner in the opposite direction to the holding cells, taking long, purposeful strides until the hubbub from outside the courtroom had faded to a distant hum. Off to Draco’s right led a narrow corridor with a single closed door at its end. He gratefully turned down it and pressed his back against the cool wall, blood thrumming fast through his veins.
Determined to avoid asking about the conversation with Lee, he racked his brain for a good alternative. “How’s work?”
He took them behind the counter into his lab, where he had a couple of potions brewing. The

He sat up instinctively, groaning as every joint in his body protested against the movement. He cracked his eyes open, blinking hard against the daylight, relieved when the familiar sight of his bedroom began to swim into view. Through blurry eyes, he could see an outline in the armchair beginning to stir. He tried to swallow against the gritty sensation in his throat, but he couldn’t, instead taking a rasping in-breath before coughing ineffectually. When he opened his eyes again, Hannah Abbott was perched on the side of his bed, holding a glass up to his lips.

had printed Harry’s own statement, which Draco realised, to his dismay, was far too sensible and measured to counter the hideously prejudiced hyperbole surrounding it. He sighed. For the first time in his life, he actually felt sympathy for Potter. He’d always assumed that – despite his numerous and oh-so-virtuous protestations – Potter secretly enjoyed his celebrity reputation. The coverage of him had always been so overwhelmingly positive that Draco could only look on with jealousy as article after article continued to refer to
The countdown ends, and the walls drop away, and you’re struggling to catch up as Harry takes long strides across the promenade, early evening sun glinting off the pavement.

They look completely ridiculous, the pair of them, marching along side-by-side: he still in Auror uniform, you –

“I… I didn’t want you to think I’d just left, you know?”
“Mmm.” Harry lazily rested his forehead against Draco’s with a contented sigh, closing his eyes in a post-orgasmic haze. Draco did the same, inhaling deeply. He could almost have stayed there for ever, except that… well, Harry’s chest was growing uncomfortably sticky against him. And there was a lovely soft bed just across the room.
Harry’s words rang through his head once more.
“It wasn’t a fling,” he says, Draco’s breath against his lips.

As he prattles on, Harry stares up at the gold number nine – hung slightly lopsided – and begins to feel rather queasy. It had been a stupid idea from the very start; anyone with any sense could see that. After all, he couldn’t even say why he’d turned down the street in the first place, nor why he’d bothered glancing over at the old stone steps. And when he’d seen the For Sale sign with a handwritten ‘Top Floor Flat’ note pinned to the post, he didn’t know why he hadn’t just shrugged and kept walking. But he hadn’t: instead, he’d got out his phone and tapped out the number right that very minute, wiping fat drops of rain off the screen, before ducking under a bus shelter to make the call.
“Also, let’s face it, you didn’t exactly use the

Harry stares, and stares some more, and for a few uneasy seconds wonders if he’s somehow misremembered and ended up in completely the wrong flat. There’s no threadbare blue carpet anymore, only a grubby-looking beige number. The curtains are an insipid lemon yellow and a couple of nondescript landscape paintings line the once-bare walls. But then the estate agent leads him over to the balcony doors, throwing them open with a flourish so that Harry can step outside. And that very instant, with cold November drizzle freezing his face, he gazes out over familiar rooftops and
“What?” Draco almost shouts, brow wrinkled in concentration as he twists around from his spot at the base of the armchair. Harry gestures to him to end the silencing charm, which he does with a frown. “Sorry, what were you saying?”
Harry looked suddenly troubled. “Lee… Yes. Lee knows everything. We had to tell her. She―” he paused, choosing his words carefully. “She didn’t take it that well at first, unsurprisingly. But you know Lee, she’s a good sort, and she’s carried on working anyway. Neville’s been helping her with the ingredients and they’ve done what they can to keep everything ticking over.” He looked over at Draco, expression solemn. “I’m not going to sugarcoat it, Draco, things have been a bit of a mess downstairs over the past few weeks. Which is another reason I think it’s best that, if you’re able, you get back to helping her out. As soon as you can.”
Harry’s bitter chuckle as he dusted the Floo powder off his shoulders snapped Draco straight out of his reverie. “Well, at least you look like crap too.”
Harry paused. “I assume you’re here for the bill reading? And the panic attack? That was… because of your trial?” Encouraged by Draco’s nods, he continued, carefully. “You didn’t realise it would be here.”
“I want – I’ve thought about―” He looked away, embarrassed.
“Maybe we don’t tell my father about the gift shop, though.”
“That…”
things, for once. He felt a surge of affection, of companionship, as though he and Malfoy were the only two people in the sky – in the world, perhaps. Like this, he could tell Malfoy anything, and so it made total sense that the next words which passed those parted lips were, “So while we’re sharing, Potter, will you humour me?”
“What? No,” said Harry, quickly. “Course not. No idea. Anyway, Malfoy caught the Snitch.”
“I suppose,” Harry began, carefully, “that what I’m worried about is that what happened between us might have… confused things. Confused your feelings.”
Well, almost.
“How often do you take it?”

“If you haven’t forgotten, the Acromantula breeder’s coming in this morning, and I’m afraid I don’t feel like getting my arm bitten off today, so if you could pop down and bring that lovely wand of yours, I’d be ever so grateful.”
Draco hasn’t turned back around, but Harry feels his body stiffen; notices the way his voice has turned quiet and strained. “Ah, no. I wasn’t going to.” Harry huffs in disappointment, and Draco throws his hands up. “It’s just that I’ve got so much on, and –”
Harry feels scooped out, laid bare; caught by surprise when at his most vulnerable. Viewing the flat had been a mistake; had forced him to revisit memories he’d long repressed, called into question every truth he’d told himself over the years. He knows he needs to rein in his emotions now, to hold some of himself back, at least until he knows what Draco wants.  But Harry wears his heart on his sleeve, always has, and he fears that Draco will have read his reaction plain as day in their brief meeting on the doorstep.
He knew what Harry was referring to. Of everything he had been forced to relive, that had been the worst. Watching from the grounds next to the Dark Lord as his mother, under Imperius, climbed slowly up onto the stone balustrade of the Manor’s third floor balcony. There she’d stood, shivering in the wind, blue nightgown flapping around her legs, occasionally offering a glimpse of her silk underwear. Some of the spectators had cheered and shouted crude remarks, while the Dark Lord waved his wand and made her dance a little jig.
The two of them watched in silence, pressed into a corner, as Malfoy continued to dance his macabre jig around the room. Several times he spun into the walls, bouncing off the shimmering cushioning charms with a chuckle. Occasionally he mumbled under his breath.

“So come see her.” The effect was immediate – Harry’s eyes darkened, his face hardening. But emboldened by the setting, by the soft crackling of the fire-bush and the lush, tropical greenery around them – not to mention Harry’s sudden, unexpected proximity – Draco pressed on, ignoring the warning signs. “No, listen, I don’t understand why you can’t stop by the shop once in a while. I know Lee would love to see you, and I―”

He swallowed his disappointment. “Oh, no, I don’t – that’s nice of you, but―”
The Manor had two enormous attics. Although Draco hadn’t been up there in years, he remembered them well from childhood as huge rooms filled with treasure, everything half-concealed by sackcloth. He’d dragged his friends up there any moment he could for games of hide-and-seek amongst the old furniture, or to rifle through boxes filled with papers, searching for hidden gems. His parents were less keen, always trying to dissuade him from exploring the chests and drawers for fear of uncovering hidden Dark items. He felt a sudden jolt of nostalgia as he remembered huddling with Pansy in an old wardrobe, the two of them giggling madly as all his mother’s house-elves searched for them outside.

“Well?”

Thomas shrugged. “I work here now. Finished my apprenticeship a couple of years ago, got my wand-maker’s licence and everything. Garrick works in the back these days, and he’s off at the moment.”

she wondered, forgetting the Legilimency link in her horror.

The mirror protested loudly, shrieking in horror as a swish of Draco’s wand sent it sailing through the air. Another flick of Harry’s wrist, and the clinical white tiles became a cool blue, followed by the towels, which also seemed to fluff themselves up under Harry’s expert hand. Finally, Harry turned back to the bath. With a commanding little click of his fingers the edges of the tub rolled themselves down neatly, and the vicious-looking talons softened and retracted, ever so slightly. The bath was once again plain white inside, its outside slowly darkening to a deep navy.
A loud hissing noise, disorienting yet strangely familiar, shocked Draco violently awake again, and he sat bolt upright, looking around in vain for its source. The old thumping headache was back and he was burning up once more, sweat beading on his forehead and chest, bed sheets soaked through. God, if only he had a drink of water.
“So, Longbottom, what is it you’re doing these days?”
“Malfoy, I… I need to know. Why did you really come back?”
“You were saying you needed a dragon keeper? Charlie Weasley works at the Romanian Dragon Sanctuary – have you contacted him?”
“Professor Sprout.” Draco stepped forwards, arm extended. Her hooded eyes searched his face for a fraction of a second before she grasped his hand firmly, shaking it as though she were unearthing a stubborn Mandrake.
The Chief Warlock rose from his seat, adjusting his papers on the lectern, and the steady murmur of the crowd increased in volume. All the remaining onlookers hastened to find their places, and the young girl’s mother finally managed to pull her away from the railing and down onto a bench.
Although Draco’s fears stalled him for a minute, he knew he was going to enter regardless. Potter aside – and let’s face it, Potter had always been the exception to every rule – he hardly ever disobeyed

hadn’t been dating – well, not in Draco’s mind, anyway. He had long suspected that under different circumstances Theo might have wanted to take it further. Sometimes afterwards, both of them spent and panting for breath, Theo would kiss Draco in a way that bordered on tender, or hold onto him for just a little too long. Draco hadn’t cared at the time – he’d hardly expected to live past the year, after all – but now, as he read the contents of Theo’s letter, he could see he would have to tread very carefully.
Merlin, though, the last time he’d seen her. He’d almost forgotten that disaster.
“Ha.” Harry turned away, wandering towards the glow of the bushes. He passed his fingers in front of the tiny flames, watching as their tips followed the movement. “New York was… very cold. Too much political posturing, too little actual training, as expected.” One of the flames darted out to lick against his skin, and he pulled his hand away with a hiss. “The food was great, though. Saw a bit of the nightlife. And I did manage to catch a Quidditch match.”
The words spilled out, a little too loud, a little too fast. “You got a job going?”
“I’ve been called stubborn,” replied Draco. Harry just nodded, eyeing Draco’s pretzel curiously, before turning back to the game. But Draco noticed the way that Harry’s coffee cup, Omnioculars and programme were resting on the bench the other side of him, leaving a space for Draco that couldn’t be coincidence.
Draco took pity on him. “Lee, isn’t that Pepper-Up on the brew? Best keep an eye, hmm?” She reluctantly retreated to the lab, grumbling under her breath.
Draco pulls him through to the living room and presses him up against the wall, stormy grey eyes shot through with lust and a sort of fierce possessiveness that feels new and thrilling and makes Harry’s chest constrict. They make out for a while, Draco’s hands all over him, his moans loud and wanton. It’s exhilarating, this lack of inhibition, Draco making noises Harry’s never heard before; nothing like the soft groans he’d stifle behind the bedcurtains in the dorms, or his hushed giggles in the Prefects’ Bathroom at midnight. Harry lets himself go, too, dizzy and heady from lust and booze and fucking
As the initial commotion died down, a hush settled over the room. Draco glanced up, hopefully, expecting the offer of a helping hand to get back up. None was forthcoming, although plenty of interested partygoers had gathered around, sneering amusement on their faces. The tree trunk was twisting on his lap, warping and shifting into a gnarled, unpleasant looking thing. With an enormous shove, Draco managed to right the pot. As he clambered to his feet, dusting himself off, he could feel dozens of pairs of eyes on him, but he couldn’t detect a single friendly face. The mana-tree was shivering now, its buds shrivelling and darkening, a few dropping to the floor as Draco levitated it quickly over to the corner. Hostile murmurings (

He thought of Harry. Harry: always his weakness, now his total undoing. He tried to remember Harry’s face at the end of the night, but it remained a blur. He could well imagine it though: disappointed. Disgusted. Once again, he heard those parting words echo through his brain:
“I…” Harry choked out, sounding dazed. “I –

Not so anymore, of course. He needed those memories, as soon as possible. He had no idea whether he had a chance of making anything work with Harry, but if he did, he’d need to do better than he had last time. Even if Draco decided to give up entirely – to try and move on – he needed the closure that those memories would provide.

It was Potter’s turn to laugh. “Look at you. You don’t come dressed like that if you want to end the night alone.”
It was strange, thought Draco, lying like this, after everything. Close enough that every shift of Harry’s body moved the quilt against Draco’s side; that when Draco inhaled deeply, he could just catch the edge of Harry’s scent: sandalwood, sweat, and spring rain together. It could only have been a couple of weeks since the last time the two of them had lain atop the bed, not an inch between them, mouths and hands so hungry for each other. There was more than just the quilt dividing them now, thought Draco, ruefully. Harry’s breathing was steady and even, his eyes almost closed, but Draco felt strangely wary, sneaking glances at him every few seconds. Just as he’d begun to wonder if Harry had fallen asleep, Harry turned his head towards Draco.
“Draco? What’s – what’s going on?”

“But,” Draco added, “you know what you have to do first, right?”
Draco nodded, dumbly.
The matches were played in the wizarding area at the Mayfair end of Hyde Park, and Draco was relieved when, on arriving at the Apparition point, he immediately caught sight of Thomas, stretching and chatting to a crowd of other witches and wizards, all wearing blue and yellow jerseys. He wandered over slowly. Thomas nodded at him, expression more wary than before. The group fell silent.

Getting laid, as it turned out, proved much easier than Draco had anticipated.
What the hell was
They were in the library, the two of them: his mother sat in an old blue reading chair, watching silently as Draco Summoned various magical law books down from the shelves and grew more irritated by the minute. The entire section on Muggle relations had been blasted into a useless cavern of charred pages, splintered wood and broken bindings; many of the other books were missing chapters, too. He was mid-sentence, ranting about this senseless destruction, when he noticed that something seemed… strange, about his mother. For starters, she was holding her body taut and deliberately upright, as though afraid that if she relaxed, she might crumple to the floor. Next to her chair stood a lamp, and the fringes on the shade jerked to and fro as her foot tapped a frantic rhythm against the base.
angry. It made me want to
Everyone loved Lee, but Potter, in particular, rapidly developed a fondness for her – both war orphans, abandoned to the care of distant relatives, Draco supposed – and consequently his visits increased until he was stopping by two or three times a week. Of course, watching Potter with Lee – whether he was transfiguring Draco’s quills into beautiful golden hummingbirds for her amusement, or laughing as he helped her recapture an escaped family of bouncing spiders, or bent over with her in the lab, having a hushed, serious discussion – only served to magnify Draco’s burgeoning crush on the man, which he feared was becoming laughably obvious.

There were only a handful of spectators up here, and the screams and shouts of the crowd below were barely audible over the howling of the wind as it rushed past the wooden structure. Even standing in the centre, Draco had to constantly adjust his gait as the stand swayed from side to side, and there was a good-size heap of debris – programmes, drinks, a pair of glasses – sliding to and fro underneath the front bench.
“Yes, yes, congratulations Unspeakables,” said Kingsley over the hubbub. “And well done everybody for this fantastic show of sportsmanship. I’m delighted to announce that your efforts here today have raised over a thousand Galleons!” There was a smattering of polite applause, and a few camera lenses reluctantly turned away from the celebrating Unspeakables, as Kingsley continued. “Such a fantastic total, and I’m absolutely
Draco rolls over, pressing his lips to that infuriating mouth, hating him just a little: the way he thinks nothing of barging straight into Draco’s careful, uncomplicated life, kindling hope in his chest where it doesn’t deserve to be. He does it every time.
As Draco watched helplessly, the bathroom door clicked shut.
They stand up, somehow, fall onto the bed, still tangled in a fierce embrace. Harry’s heart is sore; grief and love mixing together. Words form, now; words Harry never thought to say, and he whispers them against the stubble on Draco’s jaw, eyes squeezed tightly shut. Eventually, they break apart. Draco’s eyes are puffy, full of anguish, as Harry rests their foreheads together.

“Shouldn’t be a problem. When can you start?”
Hannah brought him a big bowl of chicken soup. Driven by hunger pains stronger than any he’d felt in his life, Draco ignored her warnings to take it slowly, and regretted it very shortly afterwards. Hannah helped him to the bathroom; Draco was initially alarmed when she disconnected a tube from a very Muggle-looking plastic device sticking out of his arm, but quickly forgot as once again he found himself kneeling over his toilet. The lilting cadence of Hannah’s voice washed pleasantly over him as she stroked the back of his head.
I might come back to this and add another chapter, who knows~
He had a thousand questions, but tonight wasn't the place for them. And he didn't really want to admit to himself that he already knew the answers. Draco Malfoy wasn't someone you could just "sleep with". No. He would fuck you, own you for a night, whisper sweet things in your ear, and be gone before the sun dawned.
"Isn't it a little past your bedtime Harry?" He startled and whipped his head up, leaning back into the cushiony seat a moment later. Draco's face was much too close to his and Harry had way too many memories clouding his mind at the reminder of those grey eyes, and narrow nose, and… and… pink lips closing in… Harry's lips parted and met Draco's, so very soft. He felt a slick tongue slip into his mouth and he moaned around it quietly, running his own tongue over the intrusion.
Draco hissed at the slight pain and swiveled his hips, then ground down hard into Harry's ass.
"How much do you want it sweetheart," Harry said, his voice raspy. Draco's thighs trembled around Harry's shoulders and Harry watched a bead of precum gather at the slit of Draco's cockhead.
let me, my dick is going to start hurting, do you want me to hurt?"
Harry cried out with every push, trying to move his hips back to meet Draco's cock harder, or maybe pull away, not sure which anymore.
The inside of Draco's mouth was hot and slick and tasted too good for any normal person's mouth. Harry absentmindedly thought that it must be a rich person thing.
"Yes, I've been such a good boy for you, please let me come, please Harry," he said in a rush, voice raspy and eyes watering. Harry smiled and leaned over, picking up the packet of lube he'd tossed there earlier. He poured a good amount in his hands and rubbed them together, coating them thoroughly. He wrapped both of his hands around their lengths, finally able to get a good grip.
Harry'd warned Draco that if hands came anywhere near his head, he'd be gone quicker than a Snitch.
Perhaps he really had and he wasn't a filthy liar.
"You don't know what, Draco?" Harry asked, letting go of the cock, hands tracing to Draco's hips before gripping them tightly, guiding him up and down now.
"Y-you're sure? If you're doing this to, I dunno, please me or something, you really don't have to," Harry said emphatically, placing a hand carefully on Draco's head. He twined his fingers through the other's hair, rubbing his scalp gently. Draco looked up at him, a small smile on his mouth. He reached up and enveloped Harry's hand with his own, covering it entirely.
When does porn no longer qualify as pwp?
Harry looked up at Draco through his lashes, the heavy weight of the other's cock on his tongue. The skin was as soft as velvet and Harry ran his tongue across it slowly.
He looked up and mapped out Draco's face, his aristocratic features frustrated as he teetered on the edge of satisfaction and a mouth so good it hurt.
Harry started rolling his hips every so often, secretly delighted at the whines Draco would make. Harry started rocking his hips, faster and faster, one hand coming up to intertwine fingers in Draco's hair, and the other reaching between them to let Draco fuck into his fist.
Harry's own cock hung heavy between his thighs, untouched this entire time. He glanced down and hummed at the string of precome that dripped from his cock, the head of it red, practically one graze from bursting. He tongued at the dick in his mouth, looking up to meet grey eyes glazed over with lust; pupils blown wide and giving the appearance that his eyes were black.
"Okay," he smiled, a warm feeling filling him up.
He contemplated letting Draco cum as he moved his head back and suckled at the cockhead. Draco's thighs tightened around his head and Harry let the cock slip out of his mouth, turning to nip at the pretty pale thigh.
Harry almost choked.
"That's ace Draco, how was it?"
Harry gulped, and reached for his half filled drink quickly, tipping it back and feeling it burn down his throat.
He slid further and further, until finally, he'd dropped down to the base. Harry held his breath at the feeling, so tight and hot around his length. He tried not to so much as twitch, wanting Draco to be in control.
"I'm sure, Harry. Just don't fuck it up, yeah? Other than me of course."
Harry swallowed down a lump in his throat and he reached over to switch off the lamp. He didn't bother cleaning up.
Draco smiled and a laugh slipped out, accidentally, Harry was sure, because a moment later Draco's face was wiped blank. The only evidence that he was ruffled was the blush across his neck.
"Please Harry, I want it so, so badly," he said, barely keeping his voice from breaking.
He fisted the sheets beside his head, trying to get any sort of leverage, but Draco kept on moving and Harry couldn't get any grip.
Harry would rather die again than admit that that was the best sex he'd ever had in his entire life.
"Of course! You were wonderful," he said, and he meant it with all his heart. He looked over his shoulder and he caught a glimpse of the tiny smile Draco had on his lips before it disappeared.
Harry'd always found Draco pretty, even back in school.
Okay, bye now:)
Harry grinned, "I'm glad." He paused for a moment before coming to a decision.
Scroll down to the second tilda, aka ( ~ ) to skip the background paragraph and straight to the... yeah😶
Harry nodded weakly, too busy watching Draco's cock bob with the movement of his body. Draco rolled his hips again, very gradually picking up speed, before eventually, he had his head tipped back, hands on Harry's thighs, and body sliding up and down Harry's length so very quickly. Draco moaned out at every drop downwards, Harry's name slipped in here and there.
"Nn, please, please Draco, let me cum," Harry whined out, breathless.
Draco pulled out slowly, watching his cum dribble out of Harry's winking hole.
"Harry, I don't want more hickies, I want kisses," Draco whimpered, and when Harry looked up he was met with huge watery eyes, a bottom lip pouted out. He felt a pang in his chest. He caved easily and got up on his elbows, leaning close to the other's face.
"Fuck Harry, you feel so good," Draco moaned out between heavy breaths.
Harry nodded his head desperately, pushing himself back on Draco's length.
"Go out with me for dinner tomorrow?"
The other hummed, "I see. Would you like to go for a round two? Perhaps I could change your mind?"
Draco pounded into him almost violently, again and again, the overstimulation teetering between the edges of painful and delicious.
He collapsed back into the bed seconds later, Harry sprawled over him still. Harry's face was in Draco's neck now, lips pressing gently against the skin there, not kissing, just resting. The tip of his nose was in the dip where Draco's shoulder met neck, and he smelled faintly of lavender and sweat.
"How much longer," he said breathily, "I can take thi- oh fuck!" He whined as Harry thrusted his hips up, holding him down as he grinded his length up into the other.
Draco fucked into him one last time, grinding his hips into Harry's ass as he pumped him full of his hot cum.
"You should meet me and Hermione tonight at Finnigan's
Draco fucked hard into his little hole, and Harry could feel the stretch every time he pushed in and out.
Draco's tongue peeked out, sliding along his bottom lip, searching for the lingering taste of Harry.
His brows furrowed and the corners of his mouth pulled down as he looked closer, his eyes narrowing.
"As you wish," Draco growled, and Harry felt his cock twitch.
Draco nodded, "Yeah, just… just give me a second."
the new bar Seamus' brother opened up. It'll be fun."
Draco's back arched up a moment later and he rolled his hips on Harry's cock, still buried deep inside him. He trembled on the length, his legs tightening around Harry even further. Harry moaned softly at the feeling of Draco's hole tightening around him.
Harry panted harshly, keening at the sharp feeling as Draco sucked hard, no doubt leaving a bruise.
"Awe, baby wants to come?" Draco asked, his tone rough with arousal.
Draco's neck was covered in small purple and red bruises, evidence of Harry's ministrations. Harry's ass was sore from the night before and when he woke up that morning to Draco's morning wood poking at his thigh, he'd decided to take matters into his own hands- literally.
"Harry please, I," he paused, swallowing hard at the feeling of Harry's fingertips on his cock, a whisper of a touch. He'd been torturing Draco like this for at least an hour and his knees would have a mean carpet burn the next day. But it was worth it to see the other man quivering in front of him, his cheeks and chest flushed a pretty red. His bottom lip was bitten almost to the point of breaking skin.
And he regretted it instantly.
Draco's grin disappeared and he gasped out, "
He'd never admitted it to anyone, let alone himself, but sometimes he'd have dreams of hair so blonde it was white and a pink mouth on his own, blinding white teeth tugging at his bottom lip, sucking it into a mouth that tasted like nectar. When he'd woken up from dreams like those, it was always to wet underpants and a limp dick, sweat dripping off of his body.
"H--Harry fuck," Draco moaned above him, head thrown back on the bed, his hands at his sides, slender fingers gripping the sheets.
Draco sat up carefully, his knees slightly bent and his hands clasped in his lap. He had a contemplative look on his face and Harry swallowed down a question. He laid down on his front and set his head on his folded arms.
"Hey! I was trying to-" Harry fucked into him, just once, and Draco cut himself off, his eyelids closing tightly. Harry pushed the other's thighs up until he was folded in half, his calves over Harry's shoulders.
"Is it okay? Does it hurt?" Harry asked, biting at his bottom lip, his eyes wide with worry.
"Okay, I'll do it," Draco said a good chunk of time later. Harry startled out of his half dose, slightly annoyed. He'd thought he was about to get a good night's sleep but Draco was suddenly going on abo- about…
"Alright," he said softly, sliding down a bit further. The tips of his fingers pressed into Harry's stomach, and a moment later they relaxed again.
(See the end of the chapter for
"A-ah, Dr-Draco please, oh Merlin," he gasped out, arching his back further as Draco changed his angle, going even deeper inside of him.
He cried out, his eyes rolling back, fresh tears running down his face as his orgasm embodied him, pulling his muscles tight before loosening, his legs shaking with the force of it.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry groaned loudly at the view, stuttering to a stop and tightening his hands around their lengths almost to the point of pain. He rolled his hips once more before his balls tightened and his back arched, mouth dropping open in ecstasy. His release joined Draco's on the pale canvas of his stomach.
He smiled softly and leaned down to brush his lips against the other's, featherlight but still so good.
"Alright my sweet boy, I'll give you a kiss," he leaned down, lips meeting a soft mouth. Draco whined and his tongue immediately darted out, trying to push between Harry's lips. Harry let him take control of the kiss, the feeling of Draco's tongue in his mouth absolutely delicious. Their tongues twined and Draco leaned back to suck at the tip of Harry's. Harry panted at the sensation, arousal running through his body like a tidal wave; Draco leaned up to swallow down his gasps, greedy for any sound Harry would give.
He had managed to keep the sex God at his flat until the next morning, and had even reduced him to tears. And everyone knew that Draco didn't bottom, it just wasn't him. Something about not wanting a man to have that kind of power over him. So he considered himself lucky to even have had the privilege of being on top of Draco that morning, without a dick inside of him.
Draco's brow furrowed and he laid down on his front, resting his head on Harry's soft stomach. He wrapped his arms around one of Harry's thighs and just laid there for a bit, his eyes unfocused. Harry wrinkled his nose in confusion at the very abrupt change of mood, but decided not to question it and laid back, sinking into his pillows.
He slid one hand down Draco's stomach and between their bodies, wrapping it around their cocks. His hand was too small to wrap around them both so he tore himself from the other's mouth, sitting up and leaning back on his heels. Draco moved as if to follow him, eyes glued to Harry's mouth, lips red, a pink tongue running over them, but Harry pushed him down, wrapping one hand around Draco's wrists and bringing them up over his head.
a good top, all my sexual partners have said so," Harry said petulantly, annoyed that his honor was being questioned this way.
"Harry, Harry, oh Merlin it feels so, so," Draco trailed off, his eyes rolling up into the back of his skull. His hands darted forward from their position above his head and gripped at Harry's thin hips. Draco bucked up and rolled his hips hard, cock twitching and back arching. Cum spurted out of his cock and ropes of his release landed on his stomach. He slumped down a moment later, gasping for breath, hands loosening their grip around his hips.
His eyes flicked up to Draco's face and he swallowed down a moan at the sight of his face.
Harry laid back on the bed, his legs parted around Draco's hips, one hand at his own cock, the other gripping the sheets beside his head. Draco fucked into him quickly, hips a blur. Harry gasped out every breath, and his hand worked at his cock quickly, the double sensations working through his body.
"Was it… good?" Draco whispered eventually and Harry's brows furrowed at the question.
"Now, I'm going to get us both off because you've been such a good boy. Do you agree Draco?" Draco nodded his head desperately, his hips bucking up.
It'd been a month since Draco had rejected him and Harry still felt the sting in his chest.
He let his head fall back on the other's shoulder, his fingers interlacing with the ones at his hips.
it's so good, I-I don't know," he groaned at a particularly hard drop, his hips rolling at the feeling.
"Yeah, I just moved back last week. My mother's been missing me, and my program in France finished a few weeks ago."
He let his body fall and meet Draco's, their cocks brushing together. Draco whimpered into Harry's mouth and Harry smiled, biting down on the other's bottom lip. He bit hard, almost enough to draw blood and he loved the shiver that ran through the body below him.
Anywaysss, the obligatory, "I hope you enjoyed!!!!" And I mean it:) I really hope you did. bye!
Finally, oh finally, Draco reached down and enveloped Harry's length, running his hand down and up once, twice, three times, and when he pressed down on the leaking slit with his thumb, Harry was gone.
He cried out into his pillow as Draco pounded roughly into him, not giving him even a moment's respite.
Draco's brow arched and Harry was struck by the posh nature of it.
Draco had surely broken his back.
"Yeah, alright."
He was smaller than the other, had been teased about it for years, even after they had forgiven and forgotten. Perhaps it was the past teasing that made bringing Draco practically to tears so good. Harry felt drunk on power- or drunk on the taste of Draco- either way he was drunk.
His gasps slowed until he could breathe evenly again, heart slowing to a normal beat.
Scroll to first tilda (~) to skip small background.
And Harry knew all this. He knew it before he invited him out that night. He knew when he was tearing off his shirt, he even knew it when he was lubing himself up. He'd heard the rumors, heard the whispers but- here's where Harry was different.
Harry's eyelids drooped at the feeling, his length giving one last twitch.
He collapsed face down beside Harry, who was still idly stroking his own dick, now covered with Draco's cum along with his own.
Draco slowed his pounding, leaning down and tilting Harry's face towards his, kissing him open mouthed, their tongues intertwining and Harry panting into the others mouth. He bit at Harry's bottom lip and he whined; the pain felt so good.
Draco tasted like an odd mix of mint and bitterness, with a flavor underneath that was all his own, very subtle but Harry still tried his best to reach it. He was slid back into his seat as Draco slipped into the booth, pressing Harry farther in. One hand cupped around the front of Harry's narrow neck, fingers pressing into the sides. Harry groaned at the feeling and began to feel light headed, his arms wrapping around Draco's waist to pull him closer.
"Okay. Okay," he said.
He rocked his hips back and forth, sliding his cock slowly against Draco's. Harry moved his hands along Draco's sides, the skin soft beneath his palms.
As weak as Draco was, as fuzzy as his mind was, he understood that this was a point of no return. He had clearly underestimated
“It’s normal, you know, the speaking thing,” Harry said, perching next to Draco, and running the flannel over his back. The water was lukewarm but left cool trails behind it as air hit Draco’s damp skin, making him shiver. “Hannah’s been reading up on it. The
Draco nodded. The story of that fourth-year Defence lesson had spread around Hogwarts like wildfire. And even if it hadn’t, Draco had heard enough nervous whispering between the Death Eaters who’d been present on the night of the Dark Lord’s return to know there was at least some truth to the rumour.
thing – although Draco knew from the ache in his chest that he did miss her, and although he could list the things he liked about her – her sense of humour, the way she got along with all the customers, her strange Muggle habits – the bizarre thing was, whenever he tried to picture her face, he just couldn’t bring it to mind. Likewise, when he tried to recall conversations they’d had, he found that there were specifics he couldn’t quite place. Everything was fragmented, piecemeal, with no clear timeline.

“Draco –
“Er, no, you’re alright mate,” Harry replied, mind running over plans for
Draco paused, unsure what to say. Fortunately for him, Lee stepped in. “Oh, for goodness’ sakes, Draco,” she said, in mock exasperation, “you might as well tell her.” She turned to Pansy. “Draco had a drinking problem after his house arrest. He kept it a secret, Harry found out and was upset, and Draco hasn’t seen him since. Unless you count obsessing over pictures of Harry in the paper, or stalking him at his place of work.”
“Mmm?”
“No offence, Granger, but d’you really think I’d have called you if I hadn’t?”
Honestly, picking up was so easy that it had lost most of its initial thrill. Draco knew he could just walk into any bar and within minutes he’d have his choice of several men. Frankly, he might as well be at home, having a wank. He needed

“Well, last time we really talked, at Neville’s, you said―” He broke off, glancing up at the windows above; his voice when he spoke again low and urgent. “You said you still wanted me.”
“Thanks, Thomas.” Draco cleared his throat, looking at the ground. He was also fast becoming an expert at delivering sincere (if, perhaps, embellished) apologies. “I meant what I said in the letter. I’m so sorry for the way you were treated; that I didn’t do anything to help. I should have done something… I…”

They turned right; a heavy door shut with a
and some other healing charms. They both watched as it turned from livid purple back to its normal milky white.
The words tumbled out, clumsily, tripping off Draco’s tongue as though he’d taken the Veritaserum after all. It was almost a relief to finally voice his biggest secret after so long, and while part of him wondered if Harry would be putting the memory of his admission straight into a Pensieve, he mostly found it hard to care. Draco still didn’t have a clear plan for what he’d do after Harry left, but it certainly wouldn’t involve sticking around to wait for a bunch of Aurors to show up.
Her frown deepened. “That term’s offensive, you know. But yes, I am Wizarding-Adjacent.”
Well, if you say so, Draco. If you say so,” she said, waggling her eyebrows at him. Pansy’s apparent jesting had always been disconcertingly accurate – everything she said designed to provoke maximum reaction. The best thing Draco could do would be to play it down – hard when there was an Erumpent thundering around in his head. Draco schooled his features and tried to keep calm. Pansy wasn’t fooled.
“Of course I know that,” Draco snapped, irritated.
“I’m sure you’re not. You just didn’t bother to correct them, is all.”
The curse hit home, giving Draco bare seconds to school his thoughts. Of course,
sparkle behind his eyelids, riding a wave of pleasure. Saliva ran out of the sides of his mouth and his jaw ached sweetly as Harry continued to fuck his face. He could feel his own cock leaking through his underwear, and he slid his fingers under his waistband, finally taking himself in hand.
“All right,” said Draco to Hermione and Lee. “All right!” he shouted up to the gallery.
He continued to walk the Crups with his mother each morning, went flying every afternoon, and he’d even managed to get ahead on the work for his Diploma. He’d applied to the Ministry for permission for Longbottom’s visit, which was speedily granted – probably, Draco thought, because they were crossing their fingers that Longbottom would hex him on sight.

, Draco thought, as his eyes drifted shut.
“Oh yes, there he goes alright. Mmmm. I must say, Draco, I was sceptical at first, but you’re absolutely right. I’ve never seen anyone toss a gnome with quite that much –”
He sighed. “No, it’s… it’s more complicated than that, Pans. It was me, I messed things up.”
he’d find this new Malfoy, with his bizarre American-hybrid accent, his terrible sweet tooth, and his soft, floppy hair. Harry had always pictured the Unspeakables as sort of human Nundus, stalking around the place silently until they were ready to move in for the kill. Malfoy, on the other hand, felt more like a de-clawed Kneazle. He flirted shamelessly with anyone who moved, referred openly to Kingsley as ‘Old Shackles’, and staged loud and dramatic retellings of his MACUSA exploits in the cafeteria, which always seemed to end with “…and you’re not gonna believe what happened next! He
Draco gripped the back of his chair for support. His headache was reaching truly epic proportions, and he’d just about had enough. He had seen Pansy’s venom directed at others in school, and laughed along with her as she’d cut them down to size. But having it aimed at him?  Now that was an unpleasant development, and one he needed like a hex to the head.
To Draco’s delight, Neville, who swung by whenever he was down from Hogwarts, made the mistake of visiting during the testing phase, catching Draco as he emerged from the lab, half morphed into Ron Weasley. His eyes had gone so wide that Draco had wondered if they were going to pop right out of his head, and when Lee came out seconds later, an approximation of Neville himself, he’d spluttered wildly and turned an alarming shade of purple before the three of them fell about laughing. They’d then spent a hilarious afternoon messing around with the formula – Neville ending up with Snape’s nose, Lee a hirsute Hagrid-a-like and Draco hobbling about, long hair and bulging eyes, calling for Mrs Norris.

was here, protecting him like it always had. Nagini was gone, and all he needed was a nice, cool drink to slake his thirst so here it was – his very own lake to sip from.
not by the way he kept running his hands through his hair, making Harry ache to turn around and lick a rough stripe up his underarm. No, thank you very much; when the illegal breeding ring had turned up, Harry had actually been very successfully distracting himself from all of the above by tossing bits of crispy duck to a mangy-looking cat. Fortunately, Draco was ignoring the both of them, and he fired off hexes sweet and easy, so that within ten minutes they were done and dusted, uniforms tugged back on to sweat-sticky bodies and all transported to the Ministry just in time for lunch. Not that there's time for lunch, of course: just five hours of paperwork and a lot more swearing.
He froze. It
Harry laughs, shuffles forwards, and feels himself falling.

about Draco’s new shop, that he was pleased Draco was doing well. Theo himself was training to be an Obliviator, he was doing fine, but he wondered if Draco ever thought about him or would be interested in meeting up, for old times’ sake.
“Potter, I need someone who can provide a reliable long-term supply of dragon-derived ingredients. It’s a big ask. I hardly think a Weasley is likely to do me any favours after everything I – everything that happened. Imagine he’d delight in telling me where to get off if I even tried.”
, a bit.
“Harry? What’s going on? What… what are you doing here?” The words felt tangled, heavy in Draco’s mouth.
“It’s just… look, he’s so…” She trailed off, swallowing uncomfortably as she spotted Malfoy: sprawled out on his back, gazing lovingly up at the ceiling, legs spread indecently wide.
“Oh, it’s Draco again now, is it?” he muttered, perching gingerly on the edge of his armchair, his whole body feeling prickly, irritated. “Tell me,
Out of the corner of one eye he saw a chink of light penetrate the darkness, heard the sounds of the door softly opening.
. Then Dumbledore’s body had fallen limp from the tower, and hot tears of shame had stained his cheeks as Snape tugged him through the corridors, muttering angrily:
Two weeks, then – he’d have to find a way to distract himself in the meantime. A trip to the Manor might do it. He’d promised Hermione that he would check the library anyway – she was struggling to source some old legal books on Squib rights. He worried about his mother too, all alone in the big empty house.

Reluctantly, he allows Draco to tug him up to standing, adjusts his jeans sulkily. “Why, again?”
“Much,” says Harry, holding back a smile.
Draco found himself quickly absorbed into the crowd. He re-introduced himself to people he’d once known. He was introduced to people he’d never met before. A matronly old witch in a traditional pointed hat swept him up onto the dance floor, where he steered her gracefully around, spinning and dipping until she could no longer keep up, and another witch rushed to take her place. Draco had never been the best dancer at Mme Orlova’s Wizarding School of Dance, but that evening,

Draco was quite aware that this whole thing was ridiculous; who in their right mind would hire a Squib? But
Draco didn’t miss a beat, moving in towards Potter and raising his eyebrows. “Oh? And who says I’m planning to go home with anyone?”
, Harry thinks, even with ample evidence to the contrary staring him in the face. Draco’s gained a little weight, his angular face gentling at the edges, and his hair’s longer than Harry’s ever seen it: down to his shoulder-blades, or thereabouts. There’s more than a hint of Lucius in him these days, but the soft crinkles at the edges of his eyes speak of easy laughter, of kindness. His whole demeanour is one of self-assurance: he’s no longer the nervy, war-damaged boy Harry had known, so desperate to prove himself, but someone else completely; a man who’s happy in his own skin, whole and free and at peace with the choices he’s made.
“Me?” croaked Harry, voice still sleep-sore but so full of

And still his fingers rested on Potter’s thigh.
The excited anticipation with which he used to await his Sunday Quidditch matches was also fading fast. He still loved flying, of course, but with
“Better hope his ghost’s not hanging around, listening.” They grinned at each other, before Neville looked away. “This is weird, right?”
“Mmm.” Potter picked up Draco’s chopping board, turning it over in his hands. “Anyway, Malfoy, Neville told me at lunch that it was actually you who came up with the idea of me writing a – well, you know. Statement. Thing. For the
“No.” Draco sat up, insistent. “That’s not the point. This isn’t… it isn’t supposed to be about me. It’s like you said, the other night. I’ve always been so selfish, and…”
“Duh! Well, to be honest, Pansy did. Got it shipped over to New York the Muggle way and everything. I thought it’d be a bit unfair, making some poor owl haul your naked arse across the entire Atlantic.”
“Just leave me alone, please.”

“Hmm. D’you know,” said Neville, through a mouthful of salmon sandwich, “it almost sounded like you were complimenting me then.”
“Great.”
“Great,” said Harry. “So it’s settled then, yeah?”
And he was gone, a blur of orange joining all the others hurrying down the stairs, before Draco could even consider his reply.
to see you again, after so long. And under much happier circumstances, too!” Luna looked around the crowd, whispering conspiratorially. “The last time Draco and I got the chance to catch up, I was being kept a prisoner in his cellar, would you believe?” The arrangement of brightly coloured feathers in her hair bobbed up and down as she laughed, oblivious to the way every pair of eyes in the circle immediately narrowed and swivelled towards Draco.
Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck.
to get through to anyone on the Floo, and then she basically told me that they didn’t deal with Squibs, they didn’t have any records of me anyway, didn’t I know there was a war on, and I’d be best to contact any Muggle relatives I had.”
As expected, Thomas cut in. “Malfoy. It’s been what, nearly four years now? You’ve served your time, haven’t you? I think we should let bygones be bygones. Even Ron seems to have forgiven you – no idea how you managed that one, by the way – but if you have changed, I don’t see why you shouldn’t deserve a fresh start. I mean, it’s not exactly your fault that your family were… well, you know.”
“Well, you won’t believe it, but he’s actually…” she paused, inhaling deeply. She looked up at Draco from beneath long, silver lashes. “Well, he’s a Muggleborn. He came to the Manor a few months ago… I don’t know if you remember, the wards had started playing up? Well, David owns the company who fixed them, and we began talking and… well, it was just a surprise, really, how well we got on. I told him I couldn’t… that I’d have to wait until I’d spoken to you, of course, but we’ve been Owling and – well. It’s made me realise, more than anything, just how… regressive some of your father’s… and my family’s… and, I suppose,
Warnings: In this chapter, a very minor instance of what could be considered infidelity occurs (not between Harry and Draco).
Draco allowed himself to be tugged to his feet, admiring the way Potter’s delicious arse shifted under the fabric of his expensive suit trousers as he followed him out into the ballroom.
“They were definitely over here, I saw them!” The voice echoing between the trees was indisputably Ron’s, and Harry groaned in frustration as they pulled apart. Harry rolled off the pile of leaves, scrabbling desperately to get to his feet. He pulled Malfoy up alongside him, the both of them frantically brushing down their uniforms and running shaking fingers through their hair. As the voices drew closer, Harry shifted to stand behind a small bush, noting with amusement the way Malfoy – cheeks still flushed scarlet – was attempting to position his broom in front of his own crotch.
The Snitch had disappeared completely, leaving Harry staring at his empty palm in confusion. There was a loud snort from behind him, and he turned to find Malfoy, cheeks deliciously flushed, looking at him with barely-disguised glee.

“You already have it. I’m back at Grimmauld now.” Harry says, grinning wryly at the look on Draco’s face.

, for that matter. There’s no rush.
“Oahu, Hawaii.”
“Okay. Okay, great.” Harry sat down at the small table, chair creaking as he leant heavily against the back. He rolled his neck from side to side with a deep groan.
Malfoy’s brow furrowed, his warm smile losing a little of its lustre. “There’s not much to tell, really,” he said, carefully, but his heavy sigh belied him. “It’s… it’s not a big deal. I just… I hadn’t been home in years, y’know? I worked so, so hard to… to reinvent myself, to come up with this whole new persona, and I

“Hi, Draco. I’m glad you’re awake. How do you feel?” Hannah’s smile was gentle but tired, as she helped him to tip his head back. The cool liquid stung his throat as Draco tried, with difficulty, to formulate an answer. His brain was sluggish, and he couldn’t seem to shape the words with his mouth.

later, they managed to find a semi-comfortable position resting back-to-back, propping each other up. Malfoy tilted his head to rest it against Harry’s shoulder, and Harry did likewise, willing himself not to give in to his sleep-addled instincts and bury his nose in Malfoy’s neck. Harry wrapped his hands tightly around his broom on either side, concentrating on the comforting weight of Malfoy’s warm body against his own, and let his eyelids drift shut, hoping with all his worth that their sticking charms would hold.
He hung his head in horror. His terrible secret, his greatest shame – it was hard to even comprehend that he’d finally uttered it aloud. Draco heard the door close. He sighed, half sure that when he looked up, he’d find Harry gone, Draco’s admission too much to stomach.
or booze; anything, really, which might help him forget. It required every last shred of self-control that he possessed not to head straight down to Knockturn, Galleons in hand. But he paced, and he breathed, and he counted down the hours until slowly the darkness began to pass, and it was only when the deep black of the night sky finally lightened into a murky slate grey that he collapsed, exhausted, by the fire.
“He’s not my buddy―”
Irritated, Harry clears his throat.

he makes when his back hits the floor, straddling him and interlacing their fingers. It still feels a little bit forbidden, and Harry can’t help the wicked grin which spreads across his face as he leans in to fit their lips together. The kiss is open-mouthed and hungry, sweet from the Frappuccino they shared on the way over, and he lets his hips roll lazily against Draco’s as static crackles in the carpet below. Draco allows it for a moment, sucking eagerly at his lower lip, moaning softly when Harry moves to bite down the side of his jaw. But when Harry snakes a hand down between them, fingers toying with the button on his trousers, Draco makes a soft noise of protest and pushes him away.

The Ministry witch on reception raised an eyebrow at Leonie’s attire, ushering them haughtily through the golden gates and into one of the lifts. Fortunately for her, Lee’s mind was clearly occupied; she spent so long peering at two loudly-arguing goblins that Draco had to pull her back quickly to avoid decapitation as the doors snapped shut. The Ministry witch sniffed and picked at her nails. A heavy, ominous sort of fog drifted past the false windows on either side as the lift rushed downwards – a shame, thought Draco, for Lee’s breathing was shallow and nervy, and she was in desperate need of a distraction.

been a long time, after all – but there had to be a limit. As Harry’s grinding motions continued, Draco managed to work a hand down between them, fumbling at his own trousers. He bit his lip, managing somehow to undo first his flies, then Harry’s too, exhaling as the buttons finally gave way.
To Draco’s irritation, while he was inching down the stairs and trying very hard not to fall to the floor in a drunken mess, Potter – not a patient man at the best of times – had clearly decided he was being ignored, and resumed his daft shouting.
But he hadn’t.
Too skinny?
When it eventually happened, Harry had, of course, been distracted. Not by the way Draco’s heavy breathing echoed off the bricks, not by the way his cheeks were stained just-shagged scarlet, and
In the days that followed, Draco devised a system for his

how to treat the fatigue, or what they’re even looking for. It’s all to do with latent magic, you see…” she continued, as Lee blatantly scanned the room with the obvious aim of catching anyone’s eye.
Yet again, an incongruous gleam in the corner of Harry’s eye made him turn his head quickly to the right. It was indeed the Snitch, suspended several feet below them, directly over the canopy of trees. Malfoy had spotted it too, judging by his intake of breath.
Draco sighed and rubbed his eyes. His head was spinning. He was no fool; he was well aware that long-term
Draco said nothing, but raised his right hand, the shiny globule of ointment still sitting in the middle of his palm. He shifted a little closer to Potter, which brought his left arm to rest against Potter’s clothed lower leg. Potter inhaled, sharply. Compelled by
“Huh. I assumed you were looking for me. Didn’t Draco mention I was de-gnoming the rockery today?”
. That one’s her favourite.”
” He too went silent, his eyes widening as he stared at the pair.
Things had ended here, finally, on a long, lonely night spent watching Draco sleep, Harry committing every second to memory: the steady rise and fall of his chest, the occasional twitching of his fingers, the way his rhythmic breathing disturbed the fine strands of hair on his forehead. But things had started here, too: important things, life-changing things; things he could never have dreamed of at the time. He thinks of that night: the two of them lying in bed, drowsy and silly in a post-coital haze, Draco holding Harry’s hand up above his face, kissing each of his fingers.
“Believe me, don’t believe me. Doesn’t matter. If nothing else, I’m pretty sure they wouldn’t have accepted you if they thought you were underqualified. Imagine if you’d defeated the Dark Lord only to get yourself killed on a training exercise. Some PR

“No, I –” Draco interrupts, eyes boring into Harry’s.
Potter sighed, scrubbing a hand through his hair. “I just can’t believe he did that to you. How’s it feeling now?” He squinted at Draco’s arm, frowning. “It still looks a bit of a mess – I thought Mungo’s would have fixed it up better than that…”
