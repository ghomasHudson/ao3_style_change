Robards regarded him in silence for a moment, taking in the sweaty hair, ratty trainers, the joggers and t-shirt and grunted. ‘Malfoy tricked you then.’
But Ginny is Ginny and she’s not about to become the damsel in distress (not again at least) and so she rides out her emotional outburst, sucks it back in and says, ‘I’ll sign the divorce papers. Give you the baby but fuck you both. Get out of my house.’
been explained in a way that satisfied them all but not her.
The process of stripping the two Death Eaters (confirmed when he slid their robes up to check for the presence of the Dark Mark) of their wands and any other dangerous objects was tedious. He couldn’t have anyone accusing him of improperly handling the suspects while in custody because, while they wouldn’t release two Death Eaters Harry Potter had witnessed committing a crime, there were still plenty of people within the MLE who would be happy to put him away too on even the smallest of infractions.
. It didn’t seem to matter that almost all the Weasleys were friendly and supportive, watching Harry turn away from Granger cemented his belief that Harry would choose him, no matter what the circumstances.
‘Close enough.’ But Harry pushed to his feet and held his hands out to help them both up. ‘Better not risk it though. Kingsley and Robards won’t care but it won’t look good to the rest of them if you’re getting special treatment.’
There’d been a moment after Harry’s tears had finally subsided when Draco thought about sneaking away and cursing Weasley with something horrible (perhaps one of Ginny’s more vicious hexes?) but he’d known Harry wouldn’t want that and frankly, he didn’t want to risk leaving Harry alone.
‘That’s not really how house elf magic works,’ he replied. ‘In any case, he’s happy.’ Draco shrugged and pointedly started to eat before Hermione could start talking about SPEW and things she didn’t understand and had never tried to.
‘This is sick,’ Harry muttered. ‘Twenty years? How the hell has no one noticed? How have we not noticed?’
Luna laughed. ‘You do get special treatment,’ she pointed out, ‘for the right reasons, Draco.’
They’d spoken with Ginny and Luna before slipping through McGonagall’s floo, heard briefly from Longbottom of the words Ron had thrown at him after Harry had left and received a letter from Hermione about her change in holiday plans. All the while Harry had been quiet and a little distant, but he had still been able to talk with them all. He’d still been able to smile, even if it didn’t quite reach his eyes. None of them had asked him how he was, not needing him to put on a brave face or find the words to express his pain.
Harry stared at him for a moment before he shrugged and reached out a very tentative hand to the arch of metal clamped around Draco’s ankle. Draco tried not to flinch, expecting the beastly object to release him only to take off Harry’s mostly unprotected hand.
Hermione could spend her own time delving into the spells that brought the memories to life.
There was definitely more at play there. Those runes on anyone else wouldn’t have withstood something nearly so powerful as the ward coming down. They’d have to talk about that later, finally have a proper conversation with someone who might be able to give them answers. Someone who could explain why he and Harry could exchange wands without trouble, why their magic blended so seamlessly. Why a couple of crude and basic ward runes painted in blood should have such lasting protection when by all rights they should have burned away the moment the ward came crashing down on top of them.
‘Tragically so,’ Draco agreed, opening his eyes at this just so he could give Weasley a look that spoke volumes.
That set Hermione off. She rounded on him and looked all set to tear into him for just how horrible Umbridge truly was, what with her muggle registration act and all of her war crimes which was why she was sitting in a cell in Azkaban right now, but McGonagall cut her off.
She nodded. ‘Did you contact his mother?’
It was a perfect example of why Harry went with Draco now when the Ministry called on him. He doubted any of the aurors, even Winthrop (who was properly softening up to Draco now), would have done the same – jumping in to save Draco from the full onslaught of slime while he struggled to stop another curse, as easily as Harry had.
‘Didn’t I just say I don’t know?’ Draco frowned at him, this time with genuine annoyance. ‘Are you actually listening to me?’
‘I expect a proper marriage and grandchildren,’ his father had informed them crisply. ‘From both of you,’ he’d added, sharp look tossed to Harry to make sure they understood exactly what he meant. He looked back to Draco, eyes shining with a fierceness, Draco hadn’t expected. ‘Have your mother start looking into appropriate surrogates, there’ll need to be a proper contract.’
‘I’d noticed.’ This did give Harry the excuse to ask, ‘How do you know she spoke to Ron then?’
There didn’t seem to be any pattern to the spells and curses they came across as they swept their way across the fields. Sometimes there’d be as little as three steps between trapped land and others there’d be as many as ten. They came across witch bottles, spelled iron, plants that tried to eat them – Harry quite literally tripped over a grumpy old mandrake at one point, dislodging him enough to have his mouth peaking above the earth and melting snow. He didn’t have enough clearance for a proper cry, but Draco wasn’t taking any chances, using a spell that Professor Sprout certainly wouldn’t approved of to stitch the old plant’s lips together.
wouldn’t do more than mend one or two of Draco’s broken fingers. Draco needed help, he needed a healer, but Harry had been too afraid to leave, too afraid to move him.
Draco snorted then shrugged. He was a little thrown by her words because he certainly hadn’t been expecting them. ‘You’re welcome, Granger.’
‘There hasn’t been much need to use the sixth or seventh floors,’ Harry observed. ‘I think the only ones who go up there are the Gryffindors.’
The problem was, she didn’t understand either. She didn’t know how to explain that to Ron without giving him support in hating Draco because she didn’t want to fuel that. She didn’t like Draco, but she did. Because he was building a school for magical children – all magical children – so that what happened to Harry (and to a lesser extent to her) didn’t happen again. He was working with his mother to turn his home into an inclusive and welcoming place where anyone could learn, and he was doing it for Harry and for all the kids his younger self would have ridiculed. He was working with muggleborn students to help them catch up and he was so patient with Luna.
Only, the tiny little girl (who looked far too young to possibly be at Hogwarts) wasn’t after Harry. She twisted her dark hair around her finger nervously and had to take a deep breath to steel herself before she said, ‘Erm, Mister Malfoy?’
Harry shifted uncomfortably, face a brilliant shade of red, but he was looking especially pleased as he reached to take the ring from Draco’s hand. He took Draco’s hand – the right, for now – in his and gently slid the ring up his finger. Draco had almost forgotten that his mother and aunt were there until the both of them let out soft gasps. He admired the way the ring (which automatically resized to fit his finger) looked on his long finger before he took the other ring from the box and slid it onto Harry’s finger, admiring the way the ring, once sized to fit, looked against Harry’s tanned skin.
‘Fuck, Ginny, it doesn’t have to be now!’
‘No. I chose my best friend, the one who needed to be reassured that I would never leave him just because he liked men too.’
(And wouldn’t Granger have a field day with that.)
Hermione gripped his arm tightly, preparing to side-along him. ‘He does,’ she confirmed.
Harry laughed. ‘You wish.’
‘First week back Malfoy got attacked by three seventh years. Hermione and I took him to the Hospital Wing. He’s got some pretty wicked art,’ Ron admitted grudgingly.
They’d traded a few more words back and forth but since Harry was effectively arguing with his boss, McGonagall had stepped in before Harry did something stupid that got him fired and booted from the auror program before he’d even gotten a proper start.
‘I see.’
Harry wasn’t all that clear on why they needed in now nor why they’d had to arrive at arse o’clock in the morning. They’d been there for hours, and it had only just started to get light. Harry wasn’t even sure where he was, but he was sure that it was cold and miserable and that despite multiple layers, warming charms, and the piping hot tea he was sipping, it was fucking freeze-your-bollocks-off cold and he’d much rather be elsewhere if it was all the same.
Small steps.
. He’d been so wrapped up in the unfortunate idea that he fancied Draco Malfoy of all people, that he found the stupid arrogant git attractive and fantasised about him with alarming frequency, that he’d not actually considered the fact that Draco was another boy.
Music started to issue from across the table and Malfoy pulled a face. ‘Salazar, we’ve been here not ten minutes.’ And he slid out of the booth pulling a muggle phone from his pocket as he did so.
They’d both slumped down on her fancy (though suspiciously comfortable) sofa – as far away from each other as it was possible to sit, for once Harry hadn’t wanted to be touching Draco – and offered her twin glares.
Harry jabbed him with an elbow. ‘I didn’t feel like an idiot.’
‘What does that mean?’ Ginny demanded.
But it was the moments when she did see the boy he used to be, that the sinking feeling started. The one that said he really had grown and changed and was trying so hard to be better. He faltered sometimes, small stumbles that spoke to how he was raised but not to what he believed now, and it was so hard to keep hating him. It was so hard to pretend that her smiles were fake, that her conversations with him about anything and everything and the school he was building, were just her attempts to keep close for when he hurt Harry.
‘It’s honestly not so bad now,’ Harry assured him.
Exasperated, Draco asked, ‘Why didn’t you wait and use the floo this morning?’
‘A primary school for magical children,’ Draco repeated. ‘And I do mean
Draco hadn’t been offended like he once would have been. There really hadn’t been any pining then. Plenty of other things but he wouldn’t characterise it as pining. He’d been too much of a selfish prick to pine over Harry – romantically at least. He’d been a right sod over the whole scorned friendship thing, he would freely admit that. He
Draco hadn’t been offended, rather he’d felt warm at the idea that Longbottom really was as accepting as he’d seemed of his relationship with Harry.
It didn’t erase seventeen years of pureblood upbringing that had made Draco’s first words to Harry that morning a snide remark. It didn’t erase the way he couldn’t just say thank you or the way Harry’s temper got the better of him and he’d stomped out before Draco could find a way around his own pride to apologise. Sheer stubbornness (and a little gentle shoving from Luna) had driven Harry back.
Harry gave a startled laugh and hoped like hell he wasn’t blushing.
‘I know,’ Ron acknowledged. It was weird, how subdued he sounded. He’d been so hopeful when he’d approached her and asked if they could talk, if he could take her on a date and try and explain. If he could try and make it up to her.
‘I don’t know what’s causing them,’ Harry had insisted stubbornly.
‘Spell fragments,’ he murmured after listening for a while. ‘It’s all just spell fragments and not one but lots of different spells.’
Harry loved him anyway.
Harry shrugged. ‘Fifth year, maybe?’ Harry studied the corridor. ‘There haven’t been any classes held up here in the entire time we’ve been at Hogwarts.’
Okay. That might have been a lie. Maybe he was enjoying the power display a little, but no one was around to judge him for it and that meant no one was about to roll their eyes at him for enjoying Harry’s display of magic and power in his defence. He did so love the way Harry got all possessive and protective – even when it wasn’t actually necessary.
‘About the library?’ Draco asked, confused. He’d have thought Granger, of all people, would appreciate just how serious a library was.
He would not waste his time thinking about someone who had pulled on homophobia like he pulled on his protective quidditch gear, just to inflict pain in his best friend.
But she couldn’t think about it now because she and Ron had things to talk about.
‘I’m not,’ Harry told her, somewhat bewildered. ‘And, of course I’m serious about Draco, if that’s what you meant.’
Draco watched his gaze roam around the room with troubled eyes until he spotted Draco and Harry curled together on the couch. His eyebrows shot up and his mouth fell open in surprise, but he kept quiet as he made his way across the room and slipped into the armchair across from the couch.
He nods, because that’s fair, he is. She’s just told him what should be fantastic, exciting news, and he’s choosing to ignore it because he can’t deal with that right now. He needs her to understand he’s serious, that what he’s saying isn’t just tossed out on a whim because work is hard or because the
Still, sometimes it was fun to –
Longbottom snorted. ‘I can’t really argue with that.’
‘That’s got to be hard for Ron to see,’ Hannah said, unrepentant and without further explanation – just a casual shrug. Rather shrewdly, she added, ‘I think it’s hard for you to see too.’
The crowd had thinned out completely now, only those muggles too injured to escape were still in the square. Draco caught the flash of spellfire out of the corner of his eye.
‘I’ve been there,’ Harry told him, making a soft sound of triumph when he finally located the book. ‘The night I got bitten by Nagini. There’s a memorial there now, it’s kind of nice.’
and he got his hands on the originals.’
The closer he got to the cabinet the faster the rattling until the cabinet fairly vibrated. Draco reached out a hand, hesitated and then reached that little bit further until he could press his palm flat against the cabinet door.
‘Well, I mean, it’s never been confirmed,’ Draco hastened to add. Which it hadn’t. No one had ever managed to find evidence that Blaise’s mother killed her husbands, but rumours did abound, and Merlin knew the DMLE had been looking.
‘Sir,’ she started, ‘each and every one of us fought in the war against Voldemort. We do know a lot of these spells but we’re missing the theory behind them.’
‘I want a divorce,’ Harry says, instead of the platitudes and retraction he should say. That people would expect him to say.
The beef, as predicted, was delicious and Draco picked up the list of courses he’d been looking through before Kreacher arrived and studied it while he ate. When Harry came out of the bathroom in a cloud of steam with only a towel wrapped around his waist for Hermione’s sake, Draco paused his reading to enjoy the view.
‘There’s not a garden out there.’
‘Headmistress?’ he questioned, already turning to follow her even as his heart sank and what little good feeling he’d managed to cobble together evaporated.
‘Merlin, you’re serious.’ Ron stared at his old friend and played the conversation back in his mind. ‘You and Malfoy are married. You’ve got four kids. Your son set your house – and your pet snake – on fire.’
He wasn’t and he thought she’d known that, but she’d never tried for more, never tried to reach him. Not that he’d have let her.
Malfoy looked at her and smirked and that smirk was every bit the Malfoy she remembered. ‘She really is that Hermione,’ Malfoy assured his daughter. To Hermione, Malfoy said, ‘Do you have time for tea? My husband would really like to see you.’
‘Okay, but how long have we been stuck in it without noticing? Because, Draco, I can’t tell where the boundary line of the property is, and my watch isn’t keeping time anymore.’
Draco didn’t mention any of that, he just said, ‘You know we originally planned to sell off the Manor to muggles – given the history of the place I’m not sure any wizarding family would want to buy it.’
Draco grimaced distastefully but said nothing. He wasn’t sure there was anything he could say to that. They’d been preparing for this mission for days. Charlie, Marigold and Winthrop had been behind the wards for eight full days before Bill had finally found the last of the curses and it had taken another two days on top of that for them to prepare to make the breach. Draco had spent most of those two days working tirelessly with Harry and Bill to get the harmony of casting in English and Parseltongue perfect and what time they’d had outside of that had been spent lecturing the aurors and Ministry curse breakers on what to expect from the Carrows’ farmhouse of horrors.
Given Harry actually liked that Draco could be a right git, he had to agree with Hermione on this one. That didn’t stop him from observing, ‘And I suppose you let Hermione do all of your thinking.’
She’d told him she didn’t forgive him for his part in what happened to her because there was nothing to forgive. He’d been a victim of Voldemort just as she had, though certainly not to the same extent. She’d simply wanted to clear the air between them and to thank him for his part in the capture and sentencing of Rowle.
worked with Draco clearing the Manor, but he was one of many. The offer of lessons had almost certainly come about because Bill knew how deeply Harry loved Draco and he’d seen an opportunity for the man he was coming to know and respect to drag himself out from under the stigma of being a Malfoy and a Death Eater.
‘It’s nice to meet you, Carter,’ Harry grinned. He leaned in closer, like he was just about to share a secret and asked, ‘What’s your sister’s name?’
Draco sniggered. ‘Do you think he meant to talk about that or did Luna interrupt one of his boring discussions to ask?’
‘It’s alright,’ he spoke up, glancing at Harry before he looked at Granger. ‘I can talk about it.’
Loathe though he was admitting it (Harry could tell by the pained expression), Ron said, ‘Yeah, mate, I think Malfoy’s got a point.’
Given both he and Harry had chosen to dress in the heavily warded and protected clothing they wore when out in the field, Draco wondered if Weasley would feel underdressed – assuming he even noticed. He might just think Harry was showing off some more of his new wardrobe in the black cargo pants, boots and leather jacket he was wearing. Similarly, Draco was wearing the jeans Harry had asked Molly to heavily spell and the boots and dragonhide jacket he was wearing were heavily layered in more than just the Ministry standard spells all curse breakers were required to place on their clothing.
‘She hasn’t looked before.’
I would love to hear your thoughts on Harry's isolation and what it meant for him that he had close relationships with two kids and couldn't trust or rely on adults. I've been thinking a lot lately about the boy who was fascinated by all his school books and the whole wizarding world and the one who abhorred bullying and how Ron's unintended influence changed him into someone who tolerated it (poor Hermione) and someone who hated studying and getting his homework done.
Her words spent, Hermione seemed to deflate. She looked at Harry with a distressed expression, her shoulders tight with tension as she implored him to help her make sense of it all.
‘Harry didn’t have friends,’ he stated bluntly. ‘He didn’t have a single adult in his life that loved him. You need to understand that he was isolated, that he was the only person he could trust or rely on and then – first thing he does on the train to Hogwarts and a new life – he meets a boy his own age who finds him interesting and wants to talk to him and be his friend.’
Harry gave a rather dramatic full body shudder. ‘That makes me feel so dirty.’
Draco makes a sound as though he wants to speak but doesn’t actually know what he’s supposed to say in response. Ginny tips her head forward and looks at him expectantly.
No, he and his mother wouldn’t be doing things that way. In a quiet and frank discussion (perhaps the first they’d ever really had) they’d decided to simply live. His mother’s first step had been to reach out to the Ministry for assistance clearing the Manor. She’d followed it up by reaching out to her sister. Draco really was just trying to live his life, no matter how much he struggled not to drown in the guilt and let his past win. That new way of accepting his fate had brought Harry into his life, had given him the chance to know his aunt and his cousin, it was all for the better. He was all the happier for it. His mother was certainly flourishing. Despite being on house arrest Draco was sure he’d never known his mother to be so simply
‘Isn’t that a bit harsh?’ Hermione asked. She had her desperately amused face on and she didn’t seem confused. Why didn’t she seem confused?
But he didn’t stay there. He went missing for sixty-eight hours.
‘Pomfrey is regrowing his lung,’ Harry answered, walking right by his horrified friends to take the chair Luna had left empty. He kept his eyes on Draco, watching the stuttering rise and fall of his chest as Pomfrey’s spells and Draco’s own magic worked tirelessly to repair the damage. ‘She thinks he managed to slow the spread of the curse and that’s why it only took one of his lungs.’
It was quite the opposite of harm, Madam Pomfrey in fact discovered, after dragging them both back in for some more tests. After she’d left McGonagall’s office, Pomfrey had gone off and done as much research into spells that identified magical bonds as she could and whatever those news spells had told her they’d left her well satisfied neither he nor Harry were about to drop dead. In fact, she’d used words like “thriving” and “restorative” – in one memorable yet alarming moment she’d gotten misty eyed and called it “beautiful”.
He felt Harry shake his head. ‘No,’ he slowly replied, thinking his words over carefully, ‘I still don’t really know what to think about
At the mention of the Vanishing Cabinet Hermione’s expression became strained. Draco hadn’t mentioned it to drive her away, though he wasn’t opposed to taking advantage of the way her expression closed off and she stiffened in her seat.
Not that the woman he’d encased in ice was likely to do much, the fine layer that had clung close to her skin reached bone deep and she was well and truly hypothermic now. Her friend was putting up a good fight against the chains, but Draco wasn’t worried. He gave him an unimpressed looked and with a twist of his wand sent the chain slithering up his body like a snake until one end had wrapped around the wizard’s mouth acting like a gag. He pulled it as tight as he could, making sure the man was uncomfortable but unlikely to die.
Moments that stretched back further to a broken nose on the Hogwarts express, words whispered to a beetle or the arrogant behaviour in third year that could have ruined Hagrid. What if he went all the way back? What if he thought about that moment in Madam Malkins’ with a young boy in ill-fitting clothes?
Harry made an annoyed sound and gestured at Draco with a sausage. ‘I hate when you’re right.’ This statement seemed to confuse Weasley and Granger, but Harry wasn’t done, he focused back on Luna and asked, ‘Did you learn anything new this past fortnight?’
how much he’s loved and wanted – not just needed to end a war. Without you and Weasley to hide away with, Harry could finally start to make proper meaningful connections with other people.
Harry made a disbelieving noise but went on anyway. ‘What if in third year I’d realised how badly you were actually hurt?’
‘The treatment didn’t work,’ she whispered brokenly. ‘Every time it looks like they’re making progress and starting to remember, the memories start to slip away.’
Which he supposed it had.
‘Down.’
Face turning serious, Harry asked, ‘You sure?’
What was so absurd about that statement was how wrong it was. Harry had lost his temper plenty of times before, let his anger and rage boil inside him until he broke things (although usually that was with his hands) there was nothing out of the ordinary about Harry, tired and cranky – and so full of worry and fear for Draco after a fortnight spent defiantly ignoring the Ministry for putting him in danger – blowing things up. He’d done it to Aunt Marge once before, after all.
‘I don’t know anything about time magic.’ It was a testament to just how much they’d both been through in the last few years that Draco’s words were a mere observation rather than an hysterical reaction to the problem at hand.
‘We’re set to do the entire fifth and sixth floors,’ Harry answered.
His words were misinterpreted by everyone but Draco and Hermione. Hermione’s eyes widened as she realised he’d been the one to curse the Ravenclaw’s back, Draco’s impassive expression had morphed into a smirk, as though he was going to enjoy what was about to happen.
Harry, rather predictably, rolled his eyes. ‘I didn’t even say anything!’
Harry did. ‘Right. She doesn’t know because if she did, she’d have marched on the Ministry and camped
An old friend? Just who was Malfoy married to. She hesitated, eyes searching his face for some sort of clue. She saw the moment his smile wilted, saw the moment the amusement faded into seriousness.
‘Do I want to know what that was?’ Harry asked, trying to keep his tone conversational when he just wanted to grab Draco and leg it.
She nodded. Reaching for the firewhiskey, she unscrewed the cap and poured a healthy splash into the second tumbler. ‘Are we really doing this, Draco?’ Despite the confidence she’d displayed since the moment she sat down, at her words she seemed to sink in on herself.
It set Winky at ease too, he swore it was half the reason she’d asked to serve his mother at the Manor when she’d gotten wind they were looking for an elf.
‘It is,’ Draco continued. ‘About the only thing that changed about my relationship with Pansy in fifth year was we started having sex.’
‘What, even with the secret Slytherin chamber and a dirty great Basilisk?’ Weasley had muttered when Hermione had brought it up.
‘Standard detection spells and follow it up with a painstaking walk through?’ he suggested.
Finally, after giving Ron’s fears times to filter through his automatic rejection, Harry replied softly, ‘I think that’s a risk you have to take.’ He nudged Ron with his foot, making his friends knee twitch. ‘Worrying about what-ifs will make them come about,’ he offered. ‘This thing between you two has been building for years and I can sort of understand why you’re worried but if you don’t take this step then you’re letting that worry and fear rule your relationship. And
‘You were dreaming of Azkaban again,’ the words were soft, almost a whisper, against the shell of his ear. Harry dropped a soft kiss to the nape of Draco’s neck and pulled him, if possible, tighter back against his chest.
Harry never would understand just why he’d gone down to the holding cells. He would never really know what it was about the conversation he’d overheard that had him moving before he’d really decided that’s what needed to be done. But he would never regret that decision. He’d never regret that the decision saved Draco’s life.
‘There’s no Dark Mark ward,’ he murmured to Harry. ‘There must just be a path or a spell that’ll get you clear.’
‘Oh Merlin,’ Draco giggled – and it was a giggle because this was just hilarious. ‘Luna! Luna taught you all the proper spells!’
Someone had pulled a rope across the corridor cutting off further passage onto the fifth floor. Before they crossed the barrier, Draco cast a series of spells to detect any protective charms that might have been placed on the rope. Hogwarts was full of curious and stupid teenagers. Harry had dragged him into enough dark corners and cosy alcoves to know that teenagers would ignore a rope for some healthy snogging.
‘Something else Burbage Hall will change.’
But she couldn’t help taking notice of him now because he wasn’t acting like Malfoy. He was quiet and polite and the one time she’d seen him laugh had been in the eighth-year common room after Luna had said something he apparently found funny. Because he was friends with Luna. He smiled at her and talked with her in a soft voice, and he touched her constantly with gentle affection and it was so completely baffling that she found herself watching the two of them together whenever they appeared in the common room (Luna had a complete disregard for the rules and turned up as she pleased) or when Luna managed to convince him to join her for dinner.
Harry pulled one of his hands out from under his pillow and snaked it around Draco’s hips. He slouched down further onto the bed to make it easier for Harry.
‘Oh.’ Ron frowned down into his bottle. ‘I guess he did like Ginny then,’ he sounded thoughtful. Actually, he sounded relieved.
(See the end of the chapter for
for you was mostly Ron in the beginning,’ Harry said, his words coloured with the surprise at the realisation. Not all of it obviously, because Draco used to be a horrible brat of a child, but thinking on it, Harry remembered an apathy he felt toward Draco that Ron’s defence of him managed to insight into anger and loathing on more than one occasion.
‘Ex-Death Eater,’ Harry said automatically, ‘and he didn’t want to be.’ At least he hadn’t, not in the end.
Harry shrugged helplessly. If he had any idea what had driven him to seek out Draco in the first place, he probably could have saved himself a lot of trouble. Not to mention confusion, exasperation, annoyance and a whole host of other things Draco seemed particularly skilled at bringing out of him. There were still days where Harry was just as inclined to hex him as he was to kiss him. He knew Draco felt the same. Although, Draco had a tendency to want to be around Harry while still being deeply annoyed at him. That had resulted in quite a few hours spent in angry silence when all Harry wanted to do was rage and be annoyed but it was really hard to do when it was clear that no matter how annoyed Draco was, he still liked being around Harry.
Draco pushed him to be selfish sometimes, showed him that it was okay to do the little things – taught him how to do the little things. And he never made a big deal of it. Sure, he’d caused a fuss over the wardrobe thing, but he’d made it about him. Of all the people in his life, Draco should have been the one to make him feel ridiculous for not knowing how to do basic things. The boy who’d reached out and used those things to torment him in the past should have made Harry feel small and ridiculous for not knowing what size jeans he would need. But he never felt like that with Draco.
Not like he’d done every other time they’d fought.
Weasley shifted awkwardly in his seat before he said, ‘Hermione didn’t want to miss class and Harry really needed to take a shower.’
Given that it had only just gone seven (what Ron was doing up so early, even on a Monday, Harry didn’t know, though were he to hazard a guess he thought it might have something to do with him not spending the night in his bed and Hermione’s own alarm), the Great Hall was mostly empty, barring some studious fifth years and an odd spattering of other students. Harry and Draco were the only two not wearing their school robes and perhaps sitting at the Hufflepuff table had made them seem more approachable because Harry couldn’t imagine any other time a nervous looking first year – even a Slytherin – would come up to him while Draco was around.
‘It means, Weasley,’ announced Draco as he sailed into the room looking flushed and sweaty, still in his quidditch gear and a plastic bag full of takeaway in his hand, ‘that Harry needed clothes that were his and not rejects from his hideous cousin who was approximately the size of one of Hagrid’s Halloween pumpkins.’
Into the silence, there came the soft slithering of a snake. Nagini glided into the room just moments before her Master.
Harry was quiet for a long time before finally he said, not taking the out Draco had offered, ‘I’ve dreamt about you regularly since we met. There’s a good chance a few of those dreams where I only remember a flash of blonde were more than just wondering what evil thing you were getting up to next.’
Sometimes, he thought Hermione and Ron were the same. Unchanged from the kids they were during the war, slowly piecing themselves back into the people they’d once been without all the damage and the hard choices. Sometimes, glancing over at them in the common room, it seemed like they were back before the war really kicked off, when they were just struggling to grasp the realities of what a war might mean but still not quite knowing. It was like being fifteen all over again.
‘I’m the best choice for everything, Potter.’
‘True,’ he agreed easily enough. He might have regrets and guilt and a whole host of feelings about his choices, but he wasn’t about to show weakness to a bunch of seventh years who knew nothing about what had really happened. ‘But I still fought.’
The man in the portrait said softly, ‘You’ve grown quite a bit, since I last saw you crawling about with your father.’
If Hermione noticed the look, she might actually enjoy the lecture and as much as Draco would probably get a kick out of it too – dinner.
‘Right, meet you there.’ He turned on the spot and was gone with a soft pop.
The grimace of distaste that crossed both Mendenhall and Mustafa’s faces once Harry had translated his words told Draco they knew exactly what that said about the Carrows and the sort of spells, traps and curses they were likely to stumble across. Quick and nasty, with a foundation in blood and bodily fluids that would make them stronger despite their crude creation. Witch bottles did not take great skill to create and as longs as they remained sealed and spelled, they could last centuries buried beneath the earth. That didn’t even touch on the madness a broken witch bottle could create.
The man he saw in the mirror was loved and loved in equal measure. He was strong and healthy, and he had a bright future. That bright future didn’t need someone like Ron Weasley who was so jealous and hurt and angry and only knew one way to deal with that. Why should he include someone who hurt the people he cared about just because they had things he wanted? Or because they chose to love someone he didn’t like?
‘Yeah?’
‘Merlin,’ he’d breathed, stunned by the revelation. ‘I fancy a
‘A day school,’ Harry answered.
‘What time is it?’ he grumped, flopping back onto his pillows to frown at the ceiling.
Harry pulled a face that Ron couldn’t see. He’d prefer not to think about that awkward week after Fred’s funeral, all things considered. He and Ginny had tried so hard to bury their grief in each other which had culminated in (thankfully only) the one terrible sexual encounter between them that had had them both going their separate ways. If the war hadn’t come between them maybe they would have stayed together but Harry didn’t think it would have lasted.
‘Ginny would like something more active to help with her quidditch,’ Harry pointed out.
As much as he ignored it all, he couldn’t escape the whispers entirely. They’d been back at Hogwarts just four days and already the other students were gaining confidence, calling him a Death Eater and commenting on how he’d nearly killed three seventh years in an unprovoked attack. He had expected it to go like that, but it still stung that Granger – who’d witnessed the entire attack – never spoke a word to suggest it had been anything other than what the rumours speculated. He didn’t expect anything from Weasley, but he found, to his chagrin, that he’d expected a little more from Granger.
(See the end of the chapter for
It wasn’t, it turned out, but that somehow made it worse.
Granger glanced between the two of them and then said, in a watery voice that was so quiet Draco almost didn’t hear it over the sound of the elves preparing breakfast, ‘You really don’t, do you?’
‘They’re ready to let you back into Gringotts,’ Draco informed him.
Draco wondered if she was thinking all the way back to first year and a Harry who was kind, who abhorred bullying (hadn’t he disliked Draco for exactly that?), but never said one word to Weasley about his treatment of a young and friendless Hermione. What if she was thinking about third year, when he tried so hard to stay neutral in the almost year-long fight between them when it wouldn’t have cost him anything to properly stand up to Weasley about treating Hermione so poorly. Did she think about fourth year and the way Harry so easily forgave the boy who had been so quick to believe he’d put his name in the goblet for the fame and glory? Because that wasn’t Harry and even fourth-year Draco had known that. Bloody hell, anyone with eyes who even looked at Harry during that announcement would have known.
). His life went on perfectly fine (in some cases better, and he could ignore the twinge of regret that thought gave him) now that Ron wasn’t part of it and while that in itself hurt, Harry was happy and comfortable in the choices he’d made.
Harry, pressed as close to him as he was, felt his flinch. He didn’t acknowledge it, though he did ask, ‘Can it wait?’
Harry started to grin. ‘Really?’
and promptly choked on her juice.
Harry might have been burnt and covered in sludge, but his sludge wasn’t smoking and smouldering. He almost wished it was when he sat on the loo to try and tug his jeans off and took what felt like half an inch of skin with them. He thought the smouldering might have been the potion slime itself burning away. There were tears then, Harry was not ashamed to admit it. He had a momentary burst of sympathy for Petunia and the one time she’d tried an at-home wax kit, but it was only momentary because mostly he thought she deserved that pain and because this had to be a hundred times worse.
‘Fourth year,’ Harry replied, ‘Triwizard Tournament.’ He probably could have left it at that but because he was Harry and Joseph had annoyed him, he added, ‘I taught it to my DA students in Fifth year.’ He motioned vaguely at the rest of the students.
‘Pomfrey had to regrow one of your lungs.’
Well, his hair was different now and he didn’t feel much like the sharp and angular child he’d been thanks to Madam Pomfrey and her constant hounding of his eating habits and exercise regimen. He was still easily recognisable now to the wizarding world at large because in the last nine months he’d graced the cover of the
‘This is new for both of you,’ Harry hesitantly tried to explain. ‘It’s going to be awkward and it’s going to take practice,’ he waggled his eyebrows suggestively in an attempt to lighten the moment, ‘before you really get to experience how good and fun sex can be.’
Draco
for his wellbeing because it directly related to Draco’s own happiness. ‘I love you, so yes, yes he would fight for you.’
Sick with the threat of memories, Hermione turned her back on Malfoy and her friend and strode toward the train, not even noticing Hannah Abbot calling out to her in greeting. She just needed to find Ron. She needed to see him and hold him and try to gain back the feeling of peace she’d had looking around the platform before her gaze had landed on a war criminal stood beside someone she considered a friend.
Anger flared within Harry, sharp and bitter, but it didn’t last long, he didn’t know how to hold onto it anymore when everything in him had been hollowed out. ‘
Harry snorts a laugh. ‘Oh my god, Gin, nothing about me and Draco is probably healthy.’
‘I’ve got you, you’re safe.’
Draco thought he might have laughed but it was all a bit of a dreamy haze after that. He didn’t remember Luna leaving the room or the way she’d quietly shut the door behind her. He’d been aware of nothing but Harry. The feel of him, the taste of him.
Instead, Harry had spoken for him. Luna had spoken for him. Both of them talking about things that had happened during the year Voldemort occupied his ancestral home. In a way, he’d expected the kind words from Luna. The time she’d spent as a prisoner in the dungeon had forced Draco to make decisions he never thought he’d be able to make. He was a coward, after all. But during Luna’s captivity he’d made decisions that he would have to live with for the rest of his life, some he was sure he’d never be able to reconcile. Draco Malfoy was a coward. He wasn’t a killer. Dumbledore had said as much on the Astronomy Tower.
Draco snorted. ‘I’m not sure he cared if Harry lived either.’
‘Good,’ Harry replied and knowing that, he was a little amused by the way Ron’s ears had turned a vibrant red. Harry found himself grinning at Ron’s obvious discomfort.
‘What do you mean, sir?’ Longbottom asked.
Ginny’s fury was palpable but underneath it was an obvious undercurrent of hurt. She didn’t need to say anything, Draco understood that she simply couldn’t reconcile the brother she’d always sort of looked up to with the man who was viciously hurling slurs at his best friend. Draco could relate, he had never imagined Weasley would turn on Harry quite this way. It was one thing to be angry and disgusted that Harry was choosing a Death Eater but to intentionally hurt Harry with such unexpected bigotry was something else entirely.
‘I think the
Draco smiled ruefully. ‘He did.’ He snorted. ‘Back then, I almost wished he had.’
Harry set the portrait on the mantle above the fire in their sitting room and continued to talk as he changed into the clothes Draco handed him, hardly seeming aware of what he was doing as it took him twice as long to dress as normal. His reluctance to part from the portrait created something soft and gooey inside Draco but he was used to Harry making him feel all soft and squishy by now and was therefore excellent at ignoring it.
‘This is not why we’re here,’ McGonagall reminded them all, shooting a sharp look at Snape’s portrait before turning back to face Draco and Hermione. ‘I take it you have informed Miss Granger of the contents of the letter I sent you.’
‘Show me.’
‘Hermione cornered me about our bond again,’ explained Draco. ‘Somehow the conversation circled around to the Vanishing Cabinets and sixth year.’
‘I didn’t even know you could sit for your OWLs in some of those subjects!’
She wanted to know what on Earth he’d done and said that left Andromeda feeling like she could leave Teddy alone in his care.
‘Maybe?’ Ron didn’t sound too sure, but Hermione didn’t push him on it. She didn’t need to; he went on without prompting. ‘I don’t think so. Even if he had, I don’t think he’d have been trying to hurt her.’ He gave her a sheepish look. ‘Me and Harry, we’re not all that great with feelings.’
It was nice that Longbottom moved on, accepted his relationship with Harry and that was it. ‘Harry had a nightmare.’
It didn’t take long for Harry to finish and it was only a few moments after he set the bottle aside that Draco gave up entirely on finding anything useful in the book without getting in some sleep. ‘This language is beyond archaic,’ he grumbled, rubbing at his tired eyes.
Draco grinned smugly.
This time Harry laughed. ‘I think I’m just going to see how long it takes him to figure it out.’
With what was possibly the worst timing, Weasley walked in just as Hermione crumbled – Draco was sure it was a stress reaction more so than anything because Hermione was not, by nature, a crier. Draco didn’t even see him coming, he was too busy trying to comfort Hermione (which he was terrible at but he was trying) when a large shape loomed in the corner of his eye and he spun about just in time to take Weasley’s clenched fist to his jaw.
Hermione managed to compose herself long enough to say, ‘I think you took up plenty of his time too.’
In the end, Draco’s only real complaint (which had gone completely ignored) was that his arse was freezing sitting on the ground without the decency of a warming charm – or even a cushioning charm. Still, he had a good view of the square from his position and as long as they didn’t whisk him away to the holding cells as they’d done with the two captured Death Eaters (the third needed medical attention and would be spending the night on the secure ward at St Mungo’s – Draco was still wholly unapologetic), then he could enjoy watching the DMLE attempt to interview and obliviate so many muggles.
She gave him this wide, happy smile then and Harry thought there might have been tears threatening to build but rather than saying something emotional or about how she loved him and wanted him to be happy again, she just sighed and said, ‘Oh, Harry, you’re such a sap.’
The colour drained out of Granger’s face and her eyes welled up again, but she managed not to tumble into another full-blown sob which Draco was grateful for, there was only so much sympathy he could fake and although Harry wouldn’t judge him for what might seem like cold words and indifference, Granger certainly would.
Draco shrugged. ‘I don’t know,’ he admitted. ‘It just struck me that Hermione was the first person to ask me if it’s what I really want to do and not just something the Ministry is forcing.’
Hermione frowned. ‘Did you think he didn’t?’
Whoever the hand belonged to was alive and didn’t seem to be badly hurt, which was lucky. Much luckier than whoever belonged to the mangled foot he could see sticking out from beneath the debris on the other side of the corridor. Draco could do nothing for them, he had no way of reaching them, no way of stabilising them as he had done for Harriet.
He would not let that go for Ron Weasley. He was very firm on that. He would not let Draco think for even a second that Harry didn’t see the hard work he’d put into changing himself. He would not let him think for even a heartbeat that he was losing Harry because Draco needed Harry in the same way Harry needed Draco. He wouldn’t destroy that, wouldn’t set that aside for his old friend.
Draco started to pull his hand from Harry’s, but Harry tightened his grip. ‘Can I have my hand back?’
‘That’s not a lot of students,’ he observed, sipping at his own cider. It was crisp but sweet, he wasn’t a huge fan, but it certainly wasn’t the worst thing he’d drunk recently. Just a few weeks ago he’d had to drink a dose of Skele-Gro, the cider was infinitely better than that.
Draco didn’t know the exact reason Harry had asked that question, had phrased in that way but he didn’t need to in order to pick up his line of thinking. ‘How many times did you lie to them about the things you got up to? How much did you really tell your parents about what Hogwarts was really like? Did they understand second year when you botched a Polyjuice transformation? Did you talk to them about being petrified for months?’ He looked at her steadily. ‘Did you even tell them about Voldemort?’
Teddy wasn’t the only one to receive a package from the Weasley matriarch. His mother and aunt both opened packages containing tea and homemade tarts. Teddy’s package contained a child-friendly Wheeze and a knitted hat and cardigan, while both Draco and Harry received the much vaunted Weasley jumpers. Harry put his on immediately and nudged Draco into doing the same before he came over all fidgety and handed Draco one final present in the form of a small box.
Harry’s fury vanished and in its place was a deep confusion. ‘I don’t understand.’
Not that Harry will tell her that, she doesn’t need more power over the two of them, she currently wields enough. Whether this was how he saw the night going or not, Ginny is literally cradling their future inside her right now and it is honestly terrifying.
Harry grunted, ‘Already got a workout in this morning.’
He’d fed every part of himself to Harry and formed a bond that was so pure and raw that
‘Oh my god,’ Hermione breathed, she thought she might have been in shock. ‘Harry!’
Ugh. He was too young to be thinking about this. As far as he knew, his mother hadn’t found any poor pureblood witch happy to donate some eggs and her womb, but he supposed it was only a matter of time. Hopefully, Burbage Hall and all the campaigning
That might have been the alcohol, talking.
‘I am strangely turned on right now,’ Harry admitted.
He didn’t say any of this to her, of course, he didn’t want to be dragged into a long-winded conversation about the need to restructure the entire Wizengamot over breakfast. He wasn’t sure there was ever any time of day he wanted to be dragged into that discussion. He was just happy that for once, wizarding law had worked in his favour.
A lot had happened in those four months and Harry wasn’t the same person he’d been. How could he be? How could he stay the same after a war that had seen him hunted and killed? How could he be the same boy he’d been before all that? Why shouldn’t he change and grow and become a man shaped by war and a shit childhood? He was different and that was okay, that was what it meant to grow and change with the experiences you gained in life.
‘They kept that quiet,’ Ron murmured, eyebrows shooting up.
She was no-nonsense, treated Kingsley like he was still the fresh-faced eighteen-year-old who’d turned up for his first day at the Auror academy, and had proven time and time again that, despite being on the wrong side of eighty, she could still tackle Dark Wizards (and Chosen Ones) in her sleep.
This had Hermione smiling and she turned to start toward McGonagall’s office but paused and looked back at Draco to ask, ‘Did you break his nose?’
Harry shrugged. ‘I didn’t. Luna did.’
‘Can Kreacher get her out?’
When the bell rang and they’d put away the last of their things and collected up their bags, Harry twisted on his chair until his knees pressed against Draco’s thigh and rested his elbow on the work bench, his other hand reaching up to cover a sudden yawn as he stared at Draco.
Draco smirked but Harry just looked up at his friends and smiled. He didn’t wave them over as Luna had, giving them the opportunity to make the decision for themselves. Draco didn’t know what Harry was expecting, there was only one possible way this could go.
Slick blood was sliding down the side of his face and he just knew he was going to have one hell of a headache in the morning, but he couldn’t worry about that now. Not when there were other – younger – students crying out in pain and fear. Both of his arms seemed unharmed, for which he was grateful, and it didn’t seem like he was stuck under anything too heavy or damaging. It was easy enough to shove the lighter debris clear so that he could sit up and flick his wand free of its holster.
Once she’d consented to being stretched across both of their feet, Draco was asleep within moments.
Harry raised his hands in defence. ‘Hey,’ he said softly, ‘I’m agreeing with Draco here. Hannah’s great.’
If she said all that to Ron, though, she feared it would give him even more reason to continue hating Draco and she didn’t want to push him either way. She didn’t want to tell him how much he’d changed or how much he’d stayed the same. Ron needed to see that for himself, needed to see it more than he already had, and only then would he be able to decide if he wanted to forgive Draco – or if he even should. Because it wasn’t up to her and it wasn’t up to Harry.
‘They’re not moving, are they?’
Draco blinked, still not understanding. But Hermione sat up straight her eyes wide. ‘Can we do that?’ she asked, and the question was directed at a still clueless Draco.
But that was an hour ago. Since then Harry had paced some more, angrily snapped at a group of giggling fifth years and jinxed two Ravenclaw fourth years more harshly than he’d intended when he’d overheard them gossiping about seeing Draco Malfoy in chains being arrested by the aurors and dragged back to Azkaban.
How funny to think that even then, he’d hoped that Granger’s desire to know everything would have led to her stepping in when everyone else laughed and mocked him behind his back. Because he’d never told anyone the truth of what had happened when Buckbeak had slashed his arm. His mother had been informed, of course, and was it any wonder his father had gone out of his way to have the creature killed? He hadn’t realised it at the time, but permanent injury and any sort of disfigurement that came with it would have lessened his prospects for a good marriage contract. It had likely been on his father’s mind at the time, though Draco had healed as well as Pomfrey had promised and so the topic had not come up.
But they weren’t.
Then he started to hum.
Ginny snorted. ‘It’s probably about not dragging Harry’s name through the mud.’
conversation with Ron, was it any wonder he’d failed (spectacularly) to bring up the other? By the beginning of December he’d realised he’d been putting it off for so long that it had become a thing and then a week after that it had sort of become a game because, honestly, Harry wasn’t doing a thing to hide his relationship – he hadn’t been the entire time they’d been at Hogwarts – and yet Ron had still stubbornly not noticed that maybe the relationship his best mate had with their childhood rival was (a lot) more than friendship.
‘Dumbledore?’ Pansy looked confused. He didn’t blame her. All the reports about Dumbledore were positive – glowing even. Merlin, Rita Skeeter was the only person who didn’t paint Dumbledore to be a saint and nobody liked having to give Rita Skeeter any credit. He’d actually gotten Harry to agree with him after some of the more ridiculous biographies and tall tales of Dumbledore’s life had surfaced. Skeeter might have been way off the mark with some of her details, but she hadn’t been afraid to paint Dumbledore as a human man who made mistakes.
Having sex with Ginny had nothing to do with the right time. They’d both been lost in grief and trying to gain back something Harry wasn’t sure they’d ever really had. He’d been perfectly happy to go along with Ginny when she started putting the moves on him because he liked Ginny and she was beautiful – and he was desperate to feel something other than grief.
He couldn’t hide away from it – he wouldn’t – so he walked with Luna down to the Great Hall and let her lead the way to the Ravenclaw table without comment. It wasn’t the first time he’d sat there with her, but it was the first time he did so without comment. He could feel a lot of eyes on him as he walked the short distance to the table. He didn’t need to hear the words to know that the sudden hush and then explosion of whispers were about him. He didn’t think there was much of a chance those whispers were still surprise over his choice of table or friend. Although, once the excitement of the duel wore off, he imagined people would start talking about his new friendship with Luna again.
looked in the new clothes.
‘Luna?’ Harry asked, confused.
Telling Ron and Hermione was something else altogether.
‘It wasn’t left by Death Eaters during the war,’ Draco murmured, Harry’s explanation of Fleur’s spellwork making that clear to Draco.
‘I don’t think you would have,’ Harry murmured, once he’d shared this strange and horrible idea. ‘I don’t think you give yourself nearly enough credit.’
Thank you for all the lovely kudos and comments and just the genuine support you've all shown me, it has made posting each new chapter an honest to god delight.
He breathed slowly and steadily, counting heartbeats and breaths until slowly but surely Draco’s breathing evened out. When Harry was twelve he’d spent a night here regrowing all the bones in his arm. He’d stayed for falls during quidditch, recovered from dementor attacks and hidden here after Voldemort had whisked him away via portkey and reclaimed a body. He’d watched Ron and Hermione heal after the Ministry debacle that got Sirius killed, visited the twins more than once after one of their experiments went wrong. He knew Madam Pomfrey was good, had seen her heal plenty of injuries from ordinary maladies to the weird and wonderful accidents that happened when kids were learning magic.
Draco rolled his eyes. ‘If sex counted, we’d never have to run.’
Luna shook her head.
One of the things I've come to love about reading (and writing) Drarry is the use of an unreliable narrator. I think this really shows in Draco's attitude toward Ron but also how dismissive he is of Professor Joseph. I also enjoyed playing with the idea of how these kids would feel and respond in such a situation given the things they've been through during the war.
He didn’t know how to tell them he’d died.
He should have fought harder, argued longer. Demanded to know where Draco had been taken and gone along anyway. He’d known the moment McGonagall had come for Draco that it would end badly. Draco was having a bad day, trapped in the aftermath of nightmares made from memories and he’d been dragged into something right out of one.
Madam Pomfrey gave no warning this time either, a wave of her wand vanished the glass and Draco swore emphatically as a fresh flow of hot blood welled out of the wound and started to trail down his chest. He clenched his jaw tightly and turned his head away, locking eyes with Luna, he maintained the stare while Madam Pomfrey poked and probed at the wound with spells and fingers until she seemed satisfied.
Harry snorted but he did as he was told, declaring, ‘I love you more than anything,’ as he shut his eyes and wriggled down into a more comfortable position, taking Draco with him.
‘You’re really very good at that,’ Hermione observed.
And on that note, please leave me your thoughts on the continuing development of Draco and Harry's bond and how I'm torturing poor Hogwarts.
Pansy’s tumbler hit the table with a crack, and she stared at him, hoping he’d elaborate. He wasn’t sure he knew how. How did he explain how it had all gone so completely wrong for Goyle? How did he make her understand the lengths he’d gone to just to be able to live without people spitting on him or sneering at him?
Luna, not wanting him to be alone, locked herself away with him. She wandered into his dormitory as though she had every right to be there first thing after breakfast Saturday morning, with an armful of her own textbooks and homework, her bag packed with everything she’d need to lock herself away with him, including a ridiculous Butterbeer necklace and an enormous hippogriff feather she’d brought for Harry’s kneazle kitten, Athena, to play with.
‘I’m going to cast a simple jelly legs jinx, Mister Potter,’ Joseph informed him, then to the class he said, ‘If cast correctly this spell will deflect the jinx back at the caster.’ He turned back to Harry. ‘Ready, Mister Potter?’
Harry looked back at him, his brow wrinkled in concern. ‘I don’t think I even know how old she is,’ he admitted. ‘I just remember thinking she was old when she took all those stunners to the chest back in fifth year.’
They didn’t go far; they didn’t need to. Draco felt the thrum just a heartbeat before Harry did and they both froze. Harry started to raise a shield around them while Draco cast a series of quick (and not at all Ministry approved) detection spells.
Harry shrugged and, amused, replied, ‘Me and Gin are great on parchment.’
‘I think he was probably bigger,’ Harry admitted, taking the bag from Draco as he slid down onto the floor with them. ‘What did you do with Ginny?’ The smell from the bag was amazing and seemed to completely derail any thought Ron had of further questioning Draco’s role in Harry’s new wardrobe.
‘I know he’s got me something really good too, because when I was asking Pansy for advice, she told me nothing I could get him was going to beat what he got me so I shouldn’t be aiming too high.’
This time Draco wrinkled his nose, ‘Well better that than cursing your entire family for six generations to always die slowly and painfully once they reach the delightful age of seventeen.’
‘Like what?’ Harry asked, smoothing a bit of pancake around his plate to soak up some extra syrup.
‘Oh, I know they have,’ Harry laughed. ‘George mentioned he’d gotten into it with Arthur over some of the laws he introduced when he was Head of Misuse of Muggle Artefacts.’
He managed not to start crying again and when he emerged from the bathroom, a mere five minutes after he went in, it was to find Luna had gone for her own shower and been replaced by Ron and Hermione who only looked confused as to why Ginny was seated beside Draco with her wand drawn.
But Ron had once rescued him from a room with bars on the windows and multiple locks on the door. They’d both spent a summer (or two) sending him care packages because he wasn’t being fed – as though Dudley being on a diet suddenly changed things when he’d never been properly fed before. How did he bring that up now when they’d never wanted to know before?
Hermione seemed intrigued but Harry was already heading to the bathroom for a quick wash and the shutting of the door effectively cut off any comment.
(They’d once judged him for a variety of things but never that.)
Draco couldn’t help but scoff at the wild understatement. ‘They
It had honestly been the closest Ron had gotten to finding out. After the incident with the blood curse, Ron had started to ask, rather awkwardly, ‘Is it just me or was Malfoy flirting with you while he was high on those pain potions?’
Draco, Harry had realised, enjoyed buying people things and now he did it because he liked the people he was buying for not because he enjoyed flaunting his wealth – although he did still enjoy that. He was allowed to be happy and proud of his money without tying it to blood purity. He was, after all, still a posh git.
With more enthusiasm than was warranted, Joseph had all the students stand up and with a wave of his wand he moved the desks and chairs into a neat stack at the back of the classroom, the students themselves pressed back against the stack. They weren’t keeping quiet either, booing him and calling out encouragements to Harry.
‘I – yes, okay, let’s do that.’
‘You had one girlfriend and a disaster of a crush,’ Draco corrected, dismissively. ‘Maybe if you’d just taken my hand all those years ago, we could have skipped both of those and gone straight to the finish.’
It made Harry sad. And so damn tired of it all.
freely admitted that and more than once since he and Harry had gotten together. Pansy just liked to rub it in, making out as though she’d known this would happen all along – not entirely out of the realm of possibility but Draco didn’t like to give her more credit than necessary.
‘Did you really kill a basilisk with a sword?’ Carter demanded to know.
‘I thought it would take you at least another year to work through all this childish tugging of pigtails with Potter. Now I owe your mother a villa in Tuscany.’
Draco had given Harry someone to talk to, someone who understood he was Harry and not just the Chosen One or the Saviour. When Harry walked down Diagon Alley people wanted to touch him, to talk to him and thank him. When they saw him, they saw the teenage boy who ended Voldemort’s reign of terror.
‘Jeez, what’s with the face?’
‘How did you even know that would work?’ she asked him. He could only assume it was the magic itself and his knowledge of the cabinets rather than the Death Eater aspect she was questioning. Which she confirmed when she added, ‘How did you even know they were there?’
Astara was already running up the front path and she burst through the front door with Malfoy just behind her. He glanced at her over his shoulder and arched a brow and she found herself hurrying to catch up.
Not like Malfoy apparently did.
The way Granger was looking at him, curious but kind, suggested he’d been so very wrong about her.
They talked about little things, Hogwarts and homework and how Longbottom was returning to Hogwarts early to help Sprout with the final replanting of one of her greenhouses. When their food arrived, Draco was explaining about the sentient plant at Grimmauld Place he was thinking of having Longbottom look at. They fell quiet after that, the three of them content to eat in silence, watching the swelling crowds as they munched away thoughtfully.
Harry knew, of course, about the missing antler tip; he’d seen the evidence and kind of liked Draco’s view on it. He liked the idea that the stag had been through and won a fight. Again, he didn’t say that, what he did say was, ‘He got tired of other people marking him -  Voldemort with the Dark Mark, Gladys at prisoner intake in Azkaban (that one’s on his hip in case you were wondering) – he wanted something of his own. He chooses things and people that have meaning for him.’
‘It’s news to me,’ he replied, somewhat petulantly and perhaps it was the tone of his own voice that shook him out of it – because he refused to sound like a simpering fool in front of anyone – and made him say, ‘It’s possible I have a concussion.’
According to Pansy, Blaise had spent a good five minutes laughing hysterically when she told him (via international floo) about his relationship with Harry. Daphne, by all accounts, had gotten a good giggle out of it and honestly, Draco didn’t mind that his old housemates were finding amusement in his relationship. It had given Pansy a reason to reach out to them and for that, Draco was more than happy to be the butt of a few jokes. He didn’t like thinking she was isolating herself in the muggle world. Oh, he knew she was friendly with the people she worked with and that she’d struck up some sort of friendship with a woman at the kebab place around the corner, but he didn’t like thinking he was the only one she could talk to about magic.
‘It wasn’t one of the three we captured?’ Harry asked, later when they were in bed and Draco let him in on his thoughts.
‘Who else would it happen to?’ Draco mused. ‘You barely talked to anyone.’
‘Right, then,’ he said, and stood up before either of his minders could stop him.
‘What were you expecting?’ Draco wondered. He and Harry had talked about all the little signs they’d seen that suggested Granger suspected more between them, but the fact they were in a relationship seemed to have taken her completely by surprise.
Harry did wonder if she’d mentioned to any of her friends who she was asking before she’d approached Draco because he didn’t imagine they’d have thought that a good idea, let alone a good idea to do alone.
Kingsley and Robards had agreed to a condensed training program so Harry could join the corps straight after completing his NEWTs (assuming he got the results he needed – Draco had complete confidence he would) which would give Harry the chance to prove he had earned his place just like any other Auror but gave the Ministry their Chosen One and Voldemort Slayer to hold up and show the people of the wizarding world they were going to do better and that things were changing in the right ways.
‘I’m sorry, what the fuck are you saying?’
He would not let Ron’s pathetic mopey look as he stood on the outside of Harry’s life looking in affect him at all. He would not give Ron that power over him. He wouldn’t. He couldn’t.
But Ron was going to notice eventually, even if Hermione didn’t point it out to him, and he’d like to be able to control just how the story got out rather than have it be public and messy like so many other things in his life. He just wasn’t sure where to begin. Did he start from the very beginning when he’d snuck down to the holding cells and found Draco beaten and unconscious on the verge of death? Did he start with the trials? Or Azkaban? Or, Merlin, did he start with a boy in a robe shop on Diagon Alley and how that had turned into lazy days at the Manor and long mornings in bed?
‘He deserves to be in Azkaban!’ one of the friends chimed in. They were starting to draw a crowd now, all the students who had turned back to their breakfast earlier when a fight hadn’t broken out between him and Weasley were turning to look again. Some of them were standing up to get a better view.
His father raised both eyebrows. ‘Maybe I do have a chance,’ he murmured. ‘Why are you here?’
The spell carried on despite the shouts and cries and Harry calmly turned around in the circle before he reached up and tugged the cloak free from Draco. It was becoming harder and harder to breath with the weight of the magic building around them and Draco felt it like a hot lick of flames on his skin.
Draco gave Harry a look that suggested he think on those words.
True, but also didn’t answer the question. There were other people he’d rather wake to find by his bed, Ron Weasley was so far down the list he may as well not even be on it. The fact he probably was on the list of people Draco would trust to watch over him in the hospital, frankly, came down to stubborn Gryffindor loyalty. Draco might like to suggest Weasley was unintelligent, but he’d have to be a complete and utter moron not to realise Harry cared for him and that hurting Draco would hurt Harry. So, while waking up to the horrible sight of Weasley was a bit of a letdown, it didn’t come with the mind-numbing moment of terror of not knowing where he was and if he was safe.
‘You agree with me!’ Draco reminded her. ‘I know you do, not about all that anti-muggleborn propaganda, she deserves all she got for that, but about the teaching staff at Hogwarts. What did you have to do to qualify for your position?’ he asked.
Draco saw every side of Harry because Harry found it so easy to share them with him. But being honest with Hermione and Ron, sharing that open and easy honesty, was so much harder than it should be, than he’d even realised it was. There was still that underlying fear that something he said or did could lose him his only friends and now that it had, now that something had made him lose Ron it was startling – and freeing – to realise that it wasn’t the end. That he had other people in his life now that he loved and treasured and who hadn’t left him because of something as simple and complicated as who he loved.
‘Malfoy?’ she was aware how shrill her tone was, how incredulous she sounded but honestly that was just not something she’d been expecting.
The two kids, Harry took them to be about five and six, seemed frozen, unable to say anything until the older one screwed up her courage and said a very quiet, ‘Hi,’ which was more mumbled into her scarf than aimed at Harry.
‘They didn’t arrest him,’ he explained softly, gaze still firmly locked on the Hogwarts grounds and not his friends behind him so he didn’t have to look at Hermione’s shrewd and possibly knowing look.
Didn’t want to think what, because Malfoy was standing on the platform as if he had every right to be there, as if he hadn’t almost killed two students before he’d fled after the death of Dumbledore, like he hadn’t still been fighting alongside Death Eaters in the final battle. He stood there, hand in Luna’s, as though he hadn’t spent the last year torturing students on the orders of the Carrows, as though he hadn’t stood by and watched as countless muggles were tortured and killed. As though he hadn’t had a front row seat for some of Voldemort’s worst atrocities.
Mostly he kept his eyes on Harry. Catching sight of him initially, talking to the auror-in-charge, he’d watched as Harry slowly made his way through giving his statement (twice) and then watched as he joined the other aurors to interview the muggles that had been cleared by the healers. Every now and then he’d get roped into talking with a few of the senior aurors who had been roused out of bed but as none of them were Robards, Draco stayed quietly on the fringe, just watching the mixture of competence and inadequacy that passed for the Department of Law Enforcement in a post-war world.
Hermione looked bewildered by their exchange, not because it had taken place half in Parseltongue but because she didn’t seem to understand what she was asking of Draco and all that it had brought up. Not that he’d expect her to know. How could she? How could she know all the fears and the anxieties her questions would prompt?
‘How am I supposed to know? She’s avoiding me too, you realise.’
‘The other half liked to read Skeeter,’ the man offered by way of explanation, looking confused and a little sheepish. ‘She has been following you two in
‘Not one that made the paper, no,’ Ginny smirked. ‘Dean’s been seeing one of the photographers at the
‘It’s the sleep deprivation,’ Harry assured him. ‘It won’t last.’
Harry sighed. ‘Right, let’s get this over with.’
‘Will Master be needing anything else?’
The sappy exchange Granger had only just witnessed was a prime example. Although, to be fair, it was also probably the first one that was so startlingly demonstrative. Everything else so far had been soft touches and a constant invasion of personal space. But Draco quite liked getting up close and inside Harry’s personal space and frankly, Harry had never once considered how close he got or that personal space existed when it came to Draco.
you, right?’
Harry doesn’t roll his eyes because up until about an hour ago he’d honestly thought that was a possibility. ‘No, she really won’t. The three of us have a lot to talk about.’
They did notice when he snapped, ‘Mister Malfoy, what is it you find so much more interesting than my class?’
He wished it had been a lie.
‘She’s weirdly likeable,’ Harry replied before the whole conversation caught up with him and he turned to Ron with a confused, ‘Wait, what?’ and promptly had his hand swallowed buy a teapot that had grown fangs and a sandpapery tongue when he took his attention off it.
But the threat was there. To his mother who should have been safe at home with her (twisted) sister and the Dark Lord holding court. It was there in words spoken of his father locked away in an Azkaban that hadn’t been Ministry controlled in months and was serving as punishment, not for breaking the law, but for failing Voldemort. It was there in the growing belief that the Dark Lord was a madman, one that his father had been so foolishly set on following. It was there in the way Voldemort began to waste so much proper magical blood all in the name of punishment and failure.
She’d clasped his hand tightly, squeezing just once before smiling, nodding her head in thanks to Luna and drifting out of the classroom they’d slipped into for privacy.
Molly made him jumpers at Christmas and she’d always made sure he had new robes that fit for the upcoming school year but he was the one who’d kept wearing Dudley’s old clothes, he was the one who, even with weeks spent on his own in Diagon Alley before third year, had never bothered to look for better fitting things. He’d never bought something for himself because he could, nothing big or even small, just because he wanted it. As far as Harry could remember, the Quidditch World Cup, when he’d bought them all omnioculars was the first time he’d ever just purchased something that wasn’t a necessity – and he’d gotten some for his friends too.
Hermione, unexpectedly giggled. ‘Oh Harry.’
had been making sweeping changes, much like the Ministry had, according to Granger’s analysis and Luna’s comments. New reporters, a new promise to report accurate and unbiased truth. Apparently, the owner and editors had decided that in the wake of the war, what the wizarding world needed, was a reliable newspaper.
‘Miss Granger, I need you to supervise the third year Arithmancy students next period.’
‘We would have like to be there for you, Harry,’ she told him, still sounding wounded.
‘Tomorrow?’
‘I’ve actually had an idea about that.’ Draco folded the letter and tucked it into the breast pocket of his coat which was draped across the bench beside him. ‘Remember how I planned for us to live with Mother for a year to finish the renovations to the Manor?’
‘Bloody hell,’ he snapped. ‘A little warning might have been nice.’ Deeply grateful he’d chosen not to wear his robes to breakfast (and that he’d put on his dragon hide boots and not his muggle ones), Draco flicked his wand into his hand, snapped out a shield charm and assessed the scene they’d just portkeyed into.
Both Mendenhall and Winthrop took hold of an arm with a firm grip and he placed a hand on the short length of rope presented to him. The familiar pull behind his navel deposited him, rather unexpectedly, in the middle of a battle. He reacted faster than both aurors, twisting in their grips and yanking them down as three separate spells shot overheard from two different directions.
Looking around, Hermione thought she recognised a few faces, but it had been so long, and she didn’t trust herself putting names to them. Instead she gave polite smiles and guided Rose through the crowd until she found herself not too far away from a tall slender man with pastel pink hair and the kind of muggle clothing that made it look as though he’d stepped right out of somebody’s fashion blog. (There was a distinct possibility she’d taken to scrolling through her mother’s Instagram account when nobody was looking.)
‘Harry,’ he said, a bit of urgency colouring his voice, ‘what do you see?’
better supply the man with grandchildren. Never mind the fact he’d likely never see any children Draco might have. ‘My son has done nothing but talk about you for seven years and by all accounts, you’ve been no better. It is safe to say, Narcissa and I saw this coming.’
And then, in the Hospital Wing, she’d seen the scars on his chest. The long-faded scars that were evidence he’d once nearly died in a bathroom at the end of Harry’s wand, and it had been such a horrifying realisation of what her friend was capable of that she almost hadn’t seen the tattoos. Almost. Because it was hard to miss the
‘Charlie.’
‘Don’t say that!’ Ron moaned. ‘I’ve barely eaten any chocolate frogs this week and it’s killing me.’
He could also see a bloody hand hanging over the edge of the hole.
‘I don’t recognise four of these,’ Bill replied.
It was enough though, her words finally forced meaning into her husband’s and with a short sharp snap of his wand he released the protections he’d put up without thought. It was just unfortunate they were apparently what had been keeping him upright. He hadn’t even realised he was holding them in place, he’d done it instinctually. Now that he’d cut the burden of holding them in place from his own magic all of his injuries were making themselves known in vibrant technicolour and some of them came with blinding agony.
‘Probably,’ Draco agreed. ‘Pretty sure my time limit away from the castle must be almost up.’
‘I was told he was Swiss,’ McGonagall frowned. ‘Perhaps I am wrong.’
Longbottom turned a brilliant shade of red and fidgeted, apparently deeply regretting banging on their door and possibly seeking them out in the first place. That didn’t stop him from scurrying awkwardly inside with a quick, nervous look over his shoulder.
Ron’s expression softened and he looked relieved. Had he really believed that she had forgotten the things Draco had done just as easily as Harry had?
‘Come on,’ he coaxed softly. He scooped up the same jumper he’d slipped on for his trip to the owlery and found another for Harry and some warm socks for both of them. He helped Harry into the jumper and the socks and took his hand, lacing their fingers together and squeezing tightly before he led the way out of the room and down to the deserted common room.
that had Harry raising his brows and looking at his friend expectantly.
Hermione was crying, Ron was shouting. Draco looked as terrified as he had last time around. At least, if you didn’t know what to look for. They locked eyes and Harry saw the soft edge in those grey eyes.
‘That’s true,’ Harry agreed. ‘You are the only Death Eater free and willing to work with the Ministry.’
The glare did nothing to Draco who took the letter, still tucked in its envelope and slipped it into his bag without bothering to read it. He didn’t need to. Harry’s look told him everything he needed to know about just what the goblins at Gringotts had to say. They were hardly a forgiving lot and Harry wasn’t going to get anywhere with them by getting annoyed. He’d tried that once already and it had gotten him exactly nowhere. Draco felt he had a much better chance of wearing the goblins down than Harry did. They certainly had no issue with him accessing Harry’s vaults or even his own. They’d been perfectly accommodating when it came to taking control over the contents of the Lestrange vaults and had been all too happy allowing him to oversee the move of Sirius Black’s property to Harry’s control.
‘Gemma…the Slytherin prefect?’
‘You snogged me in the bushes and then ditched me for that bloke from Durmstrang.’
Draco swore – creatively because parseltongue had a wonderous extent of profanity that likely said a lot about snakes.
‘I forgave you,’ Pansy informed him archly, ‘because Daphne got dumped for a Gryffindor and was up for some revenge exploration. That girl may have decided she was straight, but we sure had some fun while she figured it out.’
Harry raised his head and looked at Hermione, although his words were mostly for Draco when he said, ‘What if I’d taken Ancient Runes or Arithmancy?’
Hermione had been willing to get to know Draco because Harry was friends with him, she’d been willing to give one of her biggest tormenters a chance just because Harry loved and trusted him and that meant the world to Harry. And if showing her that meant suffering through too tight hugs and the occasional loaded look, then Harry was perfectly willing. He would not lose Hermione because – and this was a mind-blowing realisation to be having – Hermione didn’t have a family anymore much the same way Harry didn’t. Harry was her family. The Weasleys were her family and he hoped that she knew that, that she saw it in the way George had willingly offered up Fred’s room in the flat above the shop when she’d been facing down a lonely Christmas at Hogwarts.
‘What. The. Fuck. Harry?!’
They’d fought a fucking war, a little thing like getting married young didn’t really seem big in comparison.
Also, the effect was somewhat ruined by the nasally sound of her voice and the tears still making her eyes shimmer. And the weeks she’d spent fuming over it while Harry had avoided any kind of serious conversation with her. He’d gotten spectacularly good at avoiding talking to Granger and Weasley about anything of importance, although he hadn’t bothered to conceal any actions of importance. It was hardly Harry’s fault (or Draco’s) that the two Gryffindors had been stubbornly ignoring all the signs Harry had made no effort to conceal that they were in a relationship.
Hermione sputtered, taken aback. ‘I’m sorry – what?!’
‘You’re good for him,’ she told Draco. ‘I’m sorry I didn’t see it before, but I just thought he was repressing all of his feelings and pretending they didn’t exist.’ She frowned at Harry. ‘And I thought this was some weird saviour thing.’
The suggestion of (a second) breakfast had clearly been on Ginny’s mind long before she’d voiced it because she had a café already in mind when she led them through the floo to the Leaky and out into the wintry chill of a snow covered Diagon Alley. A bleary-eyed Tom offered them a half-hearted wave and then a raised eyebrow as they passed through and he clocked who he was actually waving at. He wasn’t the only one. Draco hadn’t been back to Diagon Alley since the summer before school started and that time he’d been with Harry. There was a lot of protection to be taken from just standing beside Harry Potter and Draco was surprised to learn that walking with Hermione Granger and a Weasley had much the same affect.
Of course, Weasley couldn’t just leave it at that. ‘You’re a right git, you know that?’
Draco’s annoyed, ‘Am I smoking?’ sounded muffled by the shirt Harry hastily yanked over his head, bemoaning the fact that whatever ingredient had gone into the slime didn’t react well with magic – how much simpler would it have been just to vanish Draco’s clothes?
Ron Weasley was his friend because he’d never had friends before and he’d been kind and eager and stood up for him. He’d been Harry’s first real exposure to a kid his own age because Draco had reminded him of Dudley and made him feel stupid and inadequate and immediately set him on a defensive edge. But Harry was Ron’s first real friend too and the implications of that were a lot to deal with when he was still hurt and feeling betrayed but also something that, when he could acknowledge it, he thought sort of reiterated the need for Burbage Hall and students to mix before Hogwarts.
And now there will be angst and some self-reflection and some growth. Also, a lot of talking about things that were glossed over in the war.
Harry swallowed hard; he didn’t know how she thought anything could be normal after all she’d been through but that wasn’t his call to make. Only Astoria and her family got to decide what was best for her and if she wanted back in the crush of Hogwarts then who was he to say otherwise?
Harry, who had made a disappointed keening sound when Draco pulled away, had to shake his head to put himself back in the kitchen and seated with his friend rather than, as Draco glimpsed in his glazed eyes, take Draco by the hand and drag him all the way back up to their bed.
Whatever he’d said to her, Draco could only assume it must have been awful and he very much doubted it had anything to do with him. Hermione might be softening towards Draco, but she loved the Weasel and only another horribly bigoted rant would have driven her to take such action.
Athena landed on the bed with a hefty thump, stalking up the bed until she could drape herself across them both. Harry ended up with a mouthful of fur and Draco fell asleep with an amused grin and laughter on his lips.
To Ron, he said, ‘We tried. It was terrible. We’re much better off as friends.’
the way she was just always
Harry nodded, not even remotely offended by Draco’s scepticism. ‘Of course, I have,’ he said, and it was true. ‘I even told her how I’m not really angry anymore – just hurt that he could actually say those things just because he knew they’d hurt.’
‘What’s up, Nev?’ Harry asked much more kindly, rolling his eyes at Draco.
‘Zabini’s a close second,’ Harry acknowledged, which made Draco laugh again.
Harry didn’t know what it was, but it was cheesy and warm and that was enough for him. it was clearly enough for Ron too, because he gave up checking on his sister to circle back to sit down again and take the container Harry offered to him. He had a mouth full of meat sauce before any of the others had even managed to open their containers properly.
‘Ginny,’ Harry answered, flushing red which was an absolute delight for Draco to witness. Given how adventurous Harry could be when it came to sex, watching him get all flustered just talking about learning the basic protections was adorable.
‘It’s one of my better qualities,’ Draco replied without missing a beat or bothering to open his eyes. It was very bright in the Hospital Wing anyway, all that horrible stark white.
‘Consolidate your vaults?’ Ron asked. ‘What do you mean?’
Ron had matured since the war broke out, but he was still the same boy who had run when things got tough and he’d realised that war wasn’t going to be pretty or easy. His friend had grown a little in the time since he’d returned to them, he’d certainly changed since he’d started a relationship with Hermione – as though he was surer of himself now that they’d sorted themselves out. But he was still Ron, there were still moments of jealousy and moments where he got funny about the amount of money or celebrity Harry had.
It hadn’t been a smooth start, just because Harry had stood guard over him didn’t erase the six years of antagonism. It didn’t erase the things that either had been through in the year that followed. It didn’t erase the harsh words, the bullying or the fact that Harry had once hit Draco with a Dark curse that had almost killed him.
For two days, the outside world didn’t exist, and it almost felt like those first days after his release from Azkaban, when they’d sit out in the garden soaking up the sun (or at least the fresh air) and not even really talking.
Apparently, he’d had more faith in Weasley than he realised, more faith that he loved his friend and was a genuinely good person.
Harry’s Killing Curse hit Voldemort from behind. He hadn’t been expecting it. He spun trying to evade it, but it was the Killing Curse and it hit his side with the same finality as if it had hit him square in the back as Harry had intended.
Hermione nodded, still staring at Harry but not really seeing him as he finished dressing and moved to the bed and his dinner. He was careful not to sit on Athena who was still hidden beneath the duvet.
It hadn’t happened that way, but it could have. Just like he might have failed Ginny in second year because he was a stupid kid who thought he could handle the world. Or all the ways he’d failed to understand Sirius, to just be with him while they had the chance. The way he could have killed Draco, or simply not saved him, they were all things that could have happened, that he’d feared would happen and his brain kept throwing them at him when all he wanted to do was sleep.
He couldn’t even remember how the conversation had come about, it hadn’t felt like one of those conversations that usually ended in snapped words and sharp apologies, but the more he talked to Draco the more he realised the guilt that he carried around over Dumbledore’s death. It had cost Harry nothing to ease that guilt for Draco, to tell him in whispers, as they huddled together for warmth and comfort beneath the calming light of his patronus, about horcruxes and the curse that Voldemort had used to protect the Gaunt ring.
‘You can’t blame Dumbledore for everything, you know.’
Hermione caught him by surprise in the library and had already erected enough privacy charms to wipe the distant corner of the library off any map of Hogwarts before he’d even had a chance to glance up from the book he was studying. A book on Dark curses Draco had found lurking in the depths of one of the Lestrange vaults and which Harry seemed only to be able to hold because of the strange connection he and Draco shared.
She did understand that it was likely Harry’s desire to save people. That finding him in the Ministry had likely sparked something in a Harry who was lost after the war with no Voldemort left to fight and he’d latched onto Malfoy as someone who needed saving.
He gave Ginny a look, but she merely smiled winningly and said, ‘You owe us for scaring us yesterday.’
Harry very purposefully didn’t look at Ron as he explained. ‘We don’t need half a dozen vaults between us.’ He looked further into the depths of the heirloom vault, squinting into shadowy corners that probably held things waiting to chew on him. ‘We could probably put all the jewellery and art into a single vault and we’re both of age now, so we have access to our family vaults not just the trust ones anymore. Honestly, it would be nice to have one vault just so I don’t have to keep reading through all the paperwork the goblins send me.’
Teddy was rolling about under the tree playing with Athena and a dislodged ornament.
Draco shot an anchor charm at the felled Death Eater (possibly not-so-innocent bystander) to keep him from escaping should one of the others get past them and try to grab him and charged forward into the thinning crowd after Harry. The witch on the left spotted them making their way through the crowd and her gleeful laugh echoed hauntingly over the crowed. It reminded him of Bella – not a fond memory and probably why the spell he fired at her was so vicious. She didn’t try to avoid the spell, throwing up a shield charm when any sensible person would have ducked, and the spell tore through her shield and slammed into her. She slammed into the ground, limbs flailing as crystals of ice swept up her legs and the length of her body encasing her in a thick layer of ice before she even had the chance to prevent it.
Honestly, if he weren’t lying on the bed with his right thigh shredded, blood soaking what remained of his jeans, and a shard of stained glass embedded (rather painfully) in his left shoulder, he might have found the looks on Granger and Weasley’s faces hilarious. As it was, his thigh was shredded, his shoulder had been stabbed and it was taking everything he had not to break down and sob.
Draco swept past Weasley, pausing to plant a kiss on Hermione’s cheek and wish her luck stuck with her idiotic boyfriend all day. Harry strolled after him, chuckling at Weasley who was left sputtering in their wake.
Draco looked around the empty conservatory, one of the many rooms that had only unsealed itself in Grimmauld Place when Draco stepped foot inside. It had mostly been full of dead plants and rotting furniture when Draco had first seen it but since then Kreacher had removed all the dead and rotting things and swept the place somewhat clean. Through the glass ceiling they had a spectacular view of the clear night sky. Draco assumed it was some sort of enchantment because he’d never known the sky to be so clear in London. Also, because the rest of the glass walls and windows were nothing close to sparkling clean.
. He would spend the rest of his life attempting – however futile – to make amends. Amends for moments he’d been too late (Astoria) and lives he’d tortured and taken (he would never regret the one he’d taken – his first – to save Luna). He had words he’d like to swallow back and actions he wished he could erase. He was built of regrets and wrongdoings and a desperate love for Harry and to live and be worthy of that love.
‘McGonagall was worried I’d be attacked in my sleep,’ he explained as she looked around the room with interest.
, would help explain how they’d become friends. He wasn’t interested in giving them all the details. He didn’t want to have to tell them that Draco had changed, he wanted them to see it. See it in the way he treated people, in the small changes to his mannerism and the choices he made. He didn’t want them to just tolerate Draco because he loved him, he wanted them to see the man he’d fallen in love with.
‘We need Malfoy,’ Robards explained, leaning back in his chair and watching Harry closely. ‘I read the reports of his work. He’ll only be going with Mendenhall and Winthrop from here on out. I can trust those two not to get him killed – if they can help it.’
Draco made a split-second decision. ‘Take me there.’
‘Just this one,’ he told her, after checking over the list twice. ‘I’ve read all the rest.’ No need to explain he’d read most of them long before he’d needed answers to this particular bond. He spun the parchment around and pointed to a text two thirds of the way down the list. ‘I don’t even know what this says. Is it Gobbledegook?’
Harry went on as if Draco hadn’t spoken, ‘I just think it’s something we should think about.’
Draco looked out across the field toward the sparks hovering high in the air and calculated just how much spelled ground they still had to cover. He wasn’t going to be able to simply lead them into this. Finding a safe pathway would take too long and the risk of someone at the end of their group missing a step was a near certainty. He’d be leading at least one of these people to their deaths and he had enough on his conscience, thank you very much.
Draco placed a hand on Harry’s elbow and murmured a soft litany of calming words in his ear which did nothing to improve the suspicions of the class but at least served to calm Harry enough to get a lid on all that power leaking out of him.
Draco winced. He debated the wisdom of it for a moment before he decided that this had been a morning for revelations and Granger really was likely to be of some help, so he simply leant against Harry and licked a quick stripe up the side of his neck. There was a beat of silence in which Granger made a startled noise and Harry shivered pleasantly against him before the runes rose again to the surface of Harry’s skin.
Granger’s expression was stricken, she was looking at him like she’d never seen him before. Which he thought was probably quite accurate. She didn’t know him, not really, neither did Weasley, but judging by the look she was giving him, he thought he might have just done something that was forcing her to consider he was more than just the arrogant pureblood she’d still sometimes assumed he was. He hoped forcing her to view him differently might make her understand what Harry saw in him, might give her a chance to see that he wasn’t that kid anymore and that Harry was right to see more in him.
‘You can go,’ he told them. They hadn’t come for Draco; they’d come to check on Harry and it grated on him. Luna was here for Draco, Merlin so was Ginny, but Ron and Hermione had only come for Harry and he didn’t want to deal with their questions or watch them trying to build up more than a passing concern for someone they still hated and didn’t trust.
Draco blew out a breath. ‘I honestly have no idea.’
Draco snorted. ‘Believe it or not, that was not something I was worried about. Next one.’
Granger’s mouth twisted in another frown of disapproval. ‘I know I don’t know what went on during the summer to have you and Malfoy so friendly – but Harry that was incredibly dangerous.’ She locked her eyes on Harry’s willing him to understand. ‘Blood magic is dangerous. There are so many things about it we don’t understand.’
And so Harry held him tightly and whispered words of love and vowed that he’d never let the Ministry use Draco like this again.
Harry would actually have to tell Hermione that he’d
‘I think I’d like to know some of the traditions of my ancestors,’ Harry said thoughtfully, then he sharpened his gaze and gave Draco a look. ‘You definitely needed some Muggle Studies.’
Alright, so that's a thing that is happening. I am definitely changing Hogwarts. Thoughts?
‘You don’t need to sound so surprised,’ Harry grouched.
She didn’t let thoughts like that take hold though because it wasn’t enough. A few polite talks before school went back were not enough to erase all that he’d done. And yet Harry wasn’t the only one who seemed to think it was. Luna had been held prisoner by him and his family, but she was firm that he had changed and that these changes were genuine.
‘Of course, I do,’ she snapped but it wasn’t harsh, and by the time she finished speaking she sounded less sure.
Granger flapped her hands dismissively, in response to Harry’s steady gaze and soft words. ‘Nightmare. I’m just being silly.’
They’d been playing for about thirty minutes when Hermione looked up from her homework with a frown. ‘I’ve been meaning to ask Harry, did you get contacts?’ It was such a simple question for her to ask and not one that he’d been expecting. He’d expected any other question about his summer, about his friendship with Draco, pretty much anything but an ordinary question about his sudden lack of glasses.
‘No.’ Draco pointed a sharp finger at Harry. ‘Sweet Salazar, you keep your mouth shut,’ Draco cautioned him. He gave his full attention to Longbottom. ‘Are you looking for advice?’ Draco thought Harry should be proud he’d asked that without biting sarcasm or any sort of derision.
Harry wanted to point out that maybe that was why she’d ended up breaking up with Ron, why she’d been taken so completely by surprise by his vehement reaction to Harry and Draco’s relationship, but he wisely kept his mouth shut. There wasn’t really anything wrong with not going out, with not doing the kinds of things he and Draco did, but it seemed to Harry that perhaps Hermione and Ron should have made a point to do some of those things together, just to mark out the change in their relationship.
‘You’ll not interfere,’ he instructed her.
It had been easier with Harry in many ways, harder in others. He and Luna had history, but it was nothing compared to what he had with Harry. Six years of rivalry, of fights and duels, insults traded back and forth and an unfortunate case of stalking (Harry) and choosing the wrong side (Draco) weren’t something they could just ignore. They’d saved each other’s lives, though, and that counted for something. What counted for more was the fact that they understood each other in a way no one else could never hope to understand him. In a way most times even Luna couldn’t understand.
‘Yeah,’ Harry agreed. ‘It was always just us three, but with them gone, I started talking to other people. You know I talked with Luna – Ginny too, when she was home. I started talking to all the Weasley’s really – more than I’ve ever done and I just don’t know why I never did before. Why didn’t I see all these people who have been in my life that were on the fringes? Everything was always about the three of us – even when I was dating Ginny it was always me, Ron and Hermione.’
Harry stared at him blankly.
him and not
‘Felicia,’ she stammered, ‘Felicia Appleby.’
‘We’d have ended up here, anyway,’ Harry mused, unintentionally responding to Draco’s thoughts. There was a lightness in the observation, an assurance, that warmed Draco, that told him Harry was losing the last grips the nightmare had on him. ‘What if I’d taken your hand on the train? What if I’d hugged you instead of cutting you open?’ Harry’s fingers traced lower, dipping under the elastic waistband of his pyjama pants. ‘Every what-if I think of always leads me right back here to you.’
Hermione snorted and Draco wasn’t the only one to take note of the ferocious blush that flooded her cheeks, telling them both exactly why Weasley hadn’t noticed, but her tone was serious when she said, ‘I won’t tell anyone until your ready.’
‘I’m not going to the Burrow over the break,’ he told Ron.
Which was not the point, the point was that Harry had some of the same titles Draco did (plus a few more he’d prefer not to), had just as much money (although not quite) as Draco did invested in the bank and yet the goblins were still treating him like public enemy number one all because he (rightfully) freed a dragon. It wasn’t like he was the first person to break into Gringotts – Quirrell of all people had managed just fine back in July of ’91. He’d even apologised – formally and in writing! – and yet here he was, just wanting to visit one of the Black vaults and they were treating Ron like his bloody handler.
‘Yes, it does!’ she cries, and the part of him that has a death wish very nearly questions if her sudden tears and swing in mood is because of hormones. ‘I can’t – I need this to be now, Harry, I need to…I need to have a plan. I need to be able to – I don’t know, I just need to know. Floo him.’
There’d been orders and instructions and more spellwork than Harry really understood, and he could freely admit that most of that night was a blur – he was happy to keep it that way. He’d fallen asleep on the floor, propped up against the side of Draco’s bed, wand clutched tightly in his hand, guarding his childhood nemesis from people who were supposed to be good, who were supposed to be better.
pining (she could admit it, deep down, sometimes) after Ron, watching him be jealous and oblivious and downright rude when he struggled with his own feelings. She’d watched him be warm and supportive and so strong for her when she needed him, but it was all tangled up in guilt and fear and hope and…
But it wasn’t okay because he didn’t find Ron or Hermione and so he sat alone in the compartment and waited, wondering if they were running late, if they’d come looking for him and he kept wondering that for hours and hours until he’d have welcomed even a confrontation with Malfoy but even he didn’t show his face and the deep gaping hole in Harry’s chest that had started in those first few weeks of summer, yawned bigger and bleaker than ever as he realised that last year was a lie and that he didn’t have friends who were worried about him or looking forward to seeing him again.
‘Now you’ve just got a piece of Draco in there instead,’ Hermione remarked, though not as unkindly as her words might have sounded because she seemed to be pondering what it might mean to have a piece of revolting broken soul removed from your own.
But he did know someone who could give advice. Not that Ron would like hearing it, although Neville seemed to appreciate whatever Draco told him.
For some reason, he imagined whatever relationship they had would have crumbled the next time he bumped into Draco. He knew himself well enough to know that he’d have spent the next week ranting and grumbling about the arrogant git until Ginny had enough of him and told him to just go and talk to Draco and he knew that would be the start of something they couldn’t come back from.
don’t understand,’ he told Granger. ‘I knew exactly what I was doing. Those runes did exactly what I expected of them.’
Which was why, after bringing down the wards with Bill’s help, he’d been handed an energy booster and a wide-awake potion just as Bill had, rather than the scorn he’d have once received and the expectation he could do without – too bad if it got him killed.
‘We have seekers matches,’ Harry said instead. ‘We’re pretty evenly matched to be honest.’ That might be a bit of an understatement if Harry were being honest. They’d both taken to using the latest Cleansweep for their one-on-one games and it was painting all of Harry’s previous matches against the Slytherin team in a new light. Draco had never been able to match Harry’s speed, a Nimbus 2001 was no competition for a Firebolt, but he’d had the skill to put up a more than decent fight and that said a lot more about Draco’s skills on the pitch than anyone seemed to realise.
Harry didn’t question the instruction. He turned slowly, careful not to set his feet down anywhere they hadn’t cleared and looked behind him. Draco had no way of knowing what he was looking at but something about the silence suggested he wasn’t going to like it.
‘Oh,’ Luna exclaimed suddenly, breaking off her story to gaze in bemusement at the doors. She waved at someone and Draco looked over to see who had caught her attention. Weasley had come to a startled halt in the doorway, blocking the flow of students as he gaped in horror at the sight of Harry seated at the Slytherin table with
‘Yeah, well it sounded like it.’ Draco listened as Harry changed the subject before he ended up arguing with Hermione about something that was hard to think about let alone talk about with someone who still didn’t – and if it remained up to Harry, would never – know the true extent of how Dumbledore wronged Harry.
Harry had only been able to shrug and admit he wasn’t sure, but he’d apologised for disrespecting Joseph and they’d parted on a more even footing.
Surprised, the man nodded awkwardly and informed them, ‘No one in my family has been to Hogwarts in about six centuries. Its tradition to teach our children at home.’
Peering down at his foot and trying to keep as still as possible, Draco watched as Harry waved his wand over the bear trap – which growled at him and dug its metal teeth in further.
Somewhat bemused – how was this his life now? – Draco shut the door behind him and then scuttled back to bed because he, unlike Harry, was not wearing socks and the stone floor was positively icy. Huddled in the blankets, perched on his bed, Draco raised an expectant eyebrow at Longbottom while Harry finally managed to get his joggers up passed his knees and started digging through the wardrobe for a jumper.
Sinistra took off at a run – Draco’s mind, slippery as it currently was, couldn’t help but admire her speed. McGonagall offered one last sharp look and the suggestion that Hermione and Weasley return to their common rooms (pointlessly, of course) before she hurried away to meet the staff and start issuing orders to keep the rest of the school safe.
It wasn’t. It was never going to be.
‘No,’ Draco answered softly. He still didn’t understand that either, but he would forever be grateful. ‘She wants to be a healer, but her Potions grade isn’t all that great. I used to help her – before the war. I think…I think she looks at me and tries to see the boy she knew before the war.’ He gave a Harry a wry look. ‘It really was mostly Gryffindors who hated Slytherins. At least at first.’
Although, it turned out they were things he needed to say.
‘A what?’
‘We were so young, Ginny, we got swept up in this fantasy of what life should be, but that’s not life Gin, it’s not the one I want or deserve and it’s not the one you deserve either. Can you honestly look back over the last couple of years and tell me you’re happy? That it’s all exactly what you wanted?’
‘Stop!’ Draco snapped the order while Harry moved to block Mendenhall from stepping into the house, making sure the movement took him outside as well. The old auror paused sharply, one foot raised to drop onto the doormat.
‘Ugh. Fine.’ He pointed his fork sharply in Draco’s direction. ‘But I want it noted I’m not happy about this.’
‘Owlery,’ he mouthed and she nodded but he felt her gaze on him the whole way out of the common room and when he glanced back at her over his shoulder right before he slipped out the door, she was wearing a soft expression on her face as she looked down at Weasley. It was such an unguarded look from her, one she clearly didn’t mind him seeing, that he was only saved from stumbling out the door by years and years of training and instruction from his mother in etiquette and grace.
Draco hummed, he had a few of those of his own. There were a lot of things he thought he could have done differently but how many of them would have landed him here in the common room with Harry Potter in his arms?
She turned away from him. ‘Good.’
‘Draco,’ she tried to speak, eyes darting from the body of her dead sister to her husband.
She didn’t understand until Ron found out and broke her heart and Harry’s.
‘There isn’t really any sort of standard for magical education before you come to Hogwarts and – honestly Harry, our education here at Hogwarts has been a complete mess and that was before the war even started.’
‘I just want to understand,’ Hermione said softly, trying not to let the pain of his words linger. ‘You hated Draco for years, Harry, and then we were away for four months and suddenly your friends? More than friends?’
He appeared to genuinely like Luna and the fact that Luna, in turn, seemed to adore Malfoy was more than a little unsettling. Hermione looked at him and felt nothing but loathing. A sharp disgust that someone with his history had even been let back into the school. Oh, she’d heard the rumours, there was talk that he’d been in Azkaban, that his return was part of his probation and Ginny – Ginny of all people! – had confirmed it.
And for what? Harry’s own stupidity? Because Harry had thought he could do this on his own? Because he’d gone to a teacher he knew was useless instead of tracking down McGonagall? So many stupid mistakes and it would get him killed, would get all of them killed. Even stupid Malfoy with his sharp pointy face and that stupid snarl because Riddle was Voldemort but Harry wasn’t stupid enough to believe that meant people were safe just because of their blood status and now Harry had failed to save Ginny and he’d likely gotten Malfoy killed, Malfoy who could have been his…Harry didn’t know how to finish that thought because here in this moment he was twelve and he was dying and what did he know about the future and the love and hope and happiness that would come from knowing Draco Malfoy? What did he care to know (what did he care to dream?) about a future he would never –
‘I felt that,’ Harry murmured, low enough that only Draco would hear.
He hadn’t even been thinking about sex, that had been all Ginny, he’d just wanted somewhere warm and safe to ride out the day. But he hadn’t been able to get away and he’d felt guilty enough about Fred without adding Ginny to it and so he’d followed her upstairs to the tub and they’d had sex while everyone downstairs steadily got drunker.
‘You’re sick,’ Ron snarled. ‘I can’t believe I’ve been friends with you all these years and you’ve just been this disgusting fag, gagging for Death Eater cock.’
, though, and all the articles the
Which was not a pleasant thought at all but there wasn’t much they could do about those people for now. They’d have to put their focus on finding the Death Eater who had put wand to Mark and managed to summon them all. As far as Draco knew, the Marks didn’t work that way. Voldemort had been the only one who could summon his Death Eaters, for the rest of them, putting wand to Mark would just summon Voldemort.
Harry stood abruptly, sending his chair skittering away to crash into the wall behind him. The idea that Malfoy was gone, that he’d been alone and defenceless and the people who were supposed to be the good guys had hurt him and hurt him until he was gone was just sick and wrong and Harry’s stomach was churning, and it was all he could do to turn and stride out of the room. There wasn’t a bathroom close enough but there was a stupid ugly fern and Harry retched into the pot, emptying the contents of his stomach because Malfoy couldn’t be dead, he couldn’t, he was supposed to live a long time and be a constant thorn in Harry’s side with all of his snide comments and that stupid smirk and he was…he was…
‘Sometimes I don’t think I like you.’
‘Fuck,’ he hissed.
‘Draco!’ Harry shouted his name again, this time he sounded alarmed. ‘Shit, fuck, damnit! I can’t get to you.’
He and Harry kissed both women on their cheeks in greeting before Harry flopped onto the floor to play with Teddy and Draco slid down beside the two, though he chose to reach for the tea laid out on the low coffee table rather than roll about on the floor. It seemed breakfast would be informal this year and Draco was thrilled not to bother with proper clothes so early in the day.
Harry could only shrug helplessly. How else could he explain it? Some days, this thing between them felt so inevitable that it didn’t need explaining. He was exactly where he was supposed to be, it was just a pity they hadn’t found their way to each other sooner.
Harry sighed heavily. ‘Go deal with McGonagall and Hermione, I’ll go and make sure our house isn’t eating itself.’
The fact his stomach rumbled loud enough for Hermione to hear in the quiet of the library gave him an excellent excuse to gather his things and make a quick exit before she could threaten to join him. It was why he urged Harry to turn around and hurried him back to the Entrance Hall when they met coming down the corridor. The last thing he needed was for Hermione to start asking Harry questions, they’d definitely never get to dinner. Or worse, she’d join them and then the entire evening would become about answering her questions rather than just spending time with Harry and Luna.
‘I can’t believe that fucking worked.’
Draco studied the naked skin of Harry’s neck and then, on a whim, leant down and traced a line up the side of it with his tongue. Harry shivered pleasantly but Draco hardly noticed. He was too fascinated with the way the runes seemed to bleed back up to the surface of Harry’s skin.
‘I’m confused,’ Hermione admitted. ‘What happened over the summer? I feel like we’ve missed so much,’ she confessed.
Harry still didn’t turn around. He didn’t stop scowling either. ‘That’s not who he is anymore,’ he pushed. ‘Not who he ever really was.’
Huffing indignantly, he changed his mind, ‘And now I’ll be eating in the kitchens, thank you very much.’
‘I made the effort to get to know Pansy because she is Draco’s oldest friend,’ he conceded. ‘But now that I know her better, she is someone worth knowing and I would say we’re friends.’
‘He makes you happy,’ she eventually said, repeating words she’d told him just days before in the kitchens. ‘Harry, he makes you
‘I think I have for a long time,’ he’d admitted quietly. Then he’d laughed nervously, ‘At least that’s what Luna says.’ He’d darted a look up at the two of them and then back down to the table. They still hadn’t said anything more and he’d felt the urge to fill the silence building and building and then, just when he was sure he was going to explode out of his chair and run, Molly had finally broken her silence.
Weasley followed this up with a croaked, ‘Bloody hell, Harry, where’d you learn to fight like that?’
Although Harry supposed he shouldn’t really have been all that surprised, given the wizarding world had people like Fleur who was part veela or Teddy, who’s dad had been a werewolf. What was two humans compared to that?
They’d been there for all of it and yet none of it and Harry didn’t know how to bring it up now when he could have brought it up then.
Draco looked over at him with a smirk, ‘They haven’t made me yet.’
Draco grinned. ‘Weirdly enough, Ginny got involved and there were so many things Ginny as a blood-traitor Weasley took for granted that I managed to get out of there before anyone remembered I was a Death Eater.’
Draco had come out of it with only the one, thankfully, and Harry carefully washed it clear of any more slime before he turned and let Draco give attention to his burns. It took longer for Draco to clean away the slime from Harry, his only comment that perhaps next time Harry would erect the shield
Draco had known of Harry’s possessive streak long before the incident and took a great deal of pleasure in knowing that this time around there would be no Ginny between them. This time, Harry had made the right choice from the beginning.
Out on the lawn there was no sign of any muggle neighbours. New wards had been set up by MLE anti-muggle officers and a small crowd of magical onlookers had gathered at the edge of the new wards. They seemed to be debating with one of the MLE officers and it didn’t take much to figure out they were reporters.
But that tiny window was the only reminder he had that there was a world outside Azkaban. It was his only reminder that this would end, that if he was strong, if he just held on, he would be free of this place.
He remembered that first morning when he’d still been in the Ministry holding cells. He’d woken up to find Harry sitting on the floor beside what passed for a bed, knees drawn up to his chest, wand clenched tightly in his fist. He hadn’t been looking at Draco, his eyes were held fiercely on the slight shimmer of the powerful ward that formed the door to Draco’s cell. It had taken him far longer than it should have to realise the agony he’d been feeling for days had been eased to a dull ache. He hadn’t understood then, honestly some days he still didn’t understand, what had driven Harry to help him.
‘It’s terrifying,’ Bill had acknowledged. ‘But, yeah, it’s a good thing.’
‘Third question,’ he added, feeling a rather pressing need to voice this one, ‘how do we break it if we don’t know what caused it?’
The wizened old wizard hadn’t batted an eye to find himself talking to Draco Malfoy and he hadn’t seemed to even notice Harry was snuggled up behind him trying to fend of the chill (and the smell), he was so intent on the conversation with Draco. That would make him one of the few. They’d gotten so many looks and quite a few doubletakes as they strolled through the market, hands joined together in one of Draco’s pockets as he dragged Harry from stall to stall. It was somewhat of a novelty to Harry, the looks they were getting, because they were getting attention for being Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy and not because they were two men obviously together.
‘It wasn’t as bad as I expected, honestly,’ Pansy muttered. ‘I just couldn’t be around for it. Mother was trying to smooth things over with all her friends, clinging to that edge of respectability and I couldn’t take it anymore.’
Someone had told Harry he’d landed in the Hospital Wing. Draco rolled his eyes, he was lucky Harry hadn’t stormed the castle, wand in hand looking for justice. With a soft chuckle to himself at the image, he collected his bag and made for his first class of the day. He was hexed three times, jinxed once and tripped twice but he barely even noticed amid the warm glow that was rising within him.
It was one of the reasons he loved him so much. They could talk about these things without having to try and explain feelings and thoughts and extenuating circumstances. He’d told Harry rather sharply, while still in that Ministry holding cell, that everything he’d done in sixth year had been to protect his parents. That he’d been terrified of failure and knowing he was the reason Voldemort killed his family. Harry had taken that knowledge – knowledge he’d already suspected – and put it together with everything else he’d known about sixth year from his not-at-all-subtle stalking and he’d understood. Made connections between the little things he’d noticed, and he’d understood.
Just because he could, Draco traced lazy fingers over Harry’s chest, taking the time to trace lines between the points of the constellation tattooed across his heart. Anyone who didn’t know them might think them to be horribly cheesy and romantic, tattooed as they were, with designs specific to each other. Anyone who did know them might think the same, but they’d also understand how much more those tattoos meant. How much this relationship – the antagonism between them, especially – had shaped them both over the years. There would be no Harry and Draco without all the years of Potter and Malfoy, without all the years of name calling and picked fights. Who would they be without all the pain and hurt and the chance to heal?
It was just after two when Draco finally came back. He walked unsteadily into the common room, pale and shaky and didn’t even seem to notice there were people in the room until Hermione’s horrified gasp drew his attention. Then his dazed eyes managed to focus on her face and he spoke her name in confusion.
He still remembered Luna’s tear stained face as she panted heavily, eyes looking up at him wide and terrified as she whispered out, ‘Thank you.’
‘That I’m bi?’ Harry frowned.
‘Even if that boy is a Malfoy,’ Arthur had added.
‘Well,’ Harry said slowly, with a sparkle in his eye Ron didn’t trust one bit. ‘We needed a night out.’
and its post war coverage. He sincerely doubted anyone had paid attention to the single photograph that had appeared in the
It’s possible we’re doing this all wrong. It didn’t start in the summer of ’97, nor in the Winter of ’03. Maybe it started in the bathroom in ’97 but it’s more likely to have been the Autumn of ’98.
Harry grinned, he closed the distance between them with slow languid steps and reached out to hook a finger through the belt loops of Draco’s jeans, tugging him close to shed the last bit of space between them. Draco’s own hands went to Harry’s chest, sliding up smooth skin until they reached his neck and slid into his hair. He leant in close until his breath ghosted over Harry’s lips, he could feel the way Harry’s breath hitched in anticipation and then he grinned. He dropped one hand back to Harry’s chest and shoved.
‘Bugger,’ Ron muttered, removing the pouch of wizarding money from his pocket. ‘I don’t have any muggle money.’
She didn’t question his decision, just stood up to straighten out her own clothes, picked up her bag and then held out his own. That surprised him because last he’d seen it, his bag had been lying on the floor of the charms corridor covered in his blood.
But Draco had.
‘It’s really not,’ Weasley grumbled. After a moment of what Draco considered deep thought for Weasley, he added, ‘Harry’s very loyal to his friends. He’d do anything for them.’
Ward successfully dismantled, Draco had looked up at the eldest Weasley and frowned. ‘And this is a good thing? My mother and yours taking tea?’
It had taken becoming friends with Harry and more than a few sessions with a mind healer to realise that he’d had those opportunities in his own early life but hadn’t been able to recognise them or act on them because of the way his father had taught him to treat the people around him.
‘It’s a muggle place,’ Hermione informed him. ‘Somewhere in London. Harry sent the address.’
This chapter marks a change in my posting schedule. I thought I'd come out of this pandemic mostly unscathed but Lockdowns 5 & 6 have just... I haven't written anything new in two months, I'm just sitting here with a half dozen half finished chapters and only three complete ones so as of now I'll be posting every four weeks instead of every two in the hopes I never run out of things to post.
It all left Hermione feeling as though she was missing something very important. There had to be a reason Luna had forgiven Draco, that Ginny put up with him and professors were worrying over him. There had to be something she didn’t know because she couldn’t think of any other reason people should be worrying over Draco Malfoy. He deserved what he got for all that he’d done.
Harry looked as though he wanted to protest but Draco nodded easily and turned to walk out of the house. Harry hesitated a moment before he turned to follow. ‘We could stick around and help.’
He had been wrong – of course, he’d been wrong. He’d been more wrong than he could have ever imagined in those little moments hidden away in his room or his dormitory bed. More than any of them had been when they boasted about the Dark Lord and the changes he would bring once he and his followers had taken control of the Ministry and the wizarding world. He’d been wrong all those times he’d boasted of speaking in person to the Dark Lord, of gloating about how the Dark Lord had seen fit to choose the Manor as his home until he took his rightful place.
‘Yes.’
‘Look, I’m not saying it’s a good idea – ’
Bloody hell, was the slime starting to smoke? It definitely looked like smoke was coming off Draco’s ruined shirt.
He could almost feel Harry roll his eyes. ‘Shut up, prat, listen.’
snitch?’
Draco studied him for a brief moment and then nodded. He let Harry lead the way out of the classroom and Harry didn’t miss the way people moved out of their way or the fact that Slughorn didn’t try to stop them. Once they were out in the corridor, Harry reached back a hand and glanced over his shoulder expectantly at Draco. Draco smiled softly, any tension remaining slithered away as he slid his hand into Harry’s.
The Winter Potions Market
Harry hadn’t known where to look, he’d just known that he couldn’t look at either of them. He hadn’t liked the heavy silence, though, and he wasn’t normally one for babbling but he could feel the urge to talk climbing up his throat and he’d known if neither of them managed to say anything more, then he was going to start telling them things he didn’t think he was ready to say.
It had cost a small fortune to engage the restorer but it had been well worth it when the spells animating Fleamont Potter had come to life and Draco had been able to explain to the memory of the man who he was and what he’d been doing. It was probably the first time in history Fleamont Potter had looked approvingly at a Malfoy – or any Black other than Sirius – and it settled something within Draco to know that one of Harry’s blood relatives approved of him.
Longbottom shook his head, the surprise finally leaving his face. For a moment he looked thoughtful and then he smiled akwardly. ‘How long?’
For the most part, the house held nothing of interest, nothing that should require such a deadly ward. Winthrop and Mendenhall were about ready to call it safe and call in the other aurors when Harry found the house’s secret.
Draco considered it but shook his head. When he’d been going over everything he knew about the Carrows (and welcoming the occasional input from aurors who had gone up against them), he’d made a point to stress how pathologically cruel they were. He’d emphasised their passion for pain over quick deaths and he’d cautioned multiple times that they’d taken great pleasure in the unexpected nature of their spells and curses.
‘You’ve my snitch on your shoulder,’ he said.
Now we can talk about the bathroom.
‘How did this even happen?’ Granger wondered, sipping at her tea and studying them over the rim of her cup. Draco couldn’t decide whether he liked her look or if he should fear it. It was shrewd and curious and if given enough time and incentive he thought she might learn to read his soul, if only so she could burn it. She still didn’t have a reason to like him. Just because Harry loved him didn’t mean Granger had to like him. Or even tolerate him.
He wondered what this one was about, the mess of his thigh now revealed to them or the scorching flames of the fiendfyre dragon that wound its way from calf to hip? Although, he supposed the dragon had likely taken refuge in a tight coil around his calf. He hoped so, he wasn’t game to brave a proper look at his right leg just then, but he dearly hoped the expensive and elaborate artwork had escaped the cutting curse that slashed his thigh open.
‘Just get us through,’ Winthrop ordered. ‘We’ll take what precautions we can.’
Harry gave this more consideration than Draco thought it warranted. ‘I suppose.’ He shot Draco a sharp look. ‘I don’t make you feel that way, do I?’
‘We can stay,’ Hermione offered. She meant it, Harry knew, but it was an offer to keep him company while he waited and making conversation with his friends who didn’t understand why he cared so much would require more energy than he had.
Draco gave Harry a moment to think on that. Wondered if he’d end up trying to explain his early years learning from a governess or how Molly taught all her children the basics but that there were serious gaps in all wizarding children’s learning. Harry probably knew more about history as it pertained to the world as a whole – not to mention maths and muggle science (some of which was relevant even to wizards) – than most magical children. Draco had been rather lucky in that his governess had been very thorough, some wizarding children weren’t so lucky.
‘Mister Carrel, I suggest you return to the Hufflepuff table immediately,’ McGonagall ordered. ‘You can retrieve your wand from me after you serve your detention. Perhaps by then you will have learned not to curse your fellow students.’
No one spoke to him during Herbology. They spoke plenty about him in whispers under their breath, acting as though he couldn’t possibly hear them, but no one was brave enough to speak up in front of Sprout. The murmurs and whispers increased throughout the day and he diligently ignored them. He even ignored the way Granger kept looking up and over at him during Ancient Runes and Arithmancy.
Harry pinched his side, not bothering to translate his words for Hermione and smiled when Draco yelped. ‘I saw a mind healer,’ Harry explained to Hermione, not for the first time and certainly it wouldn’t be the last because it definitely bore repeating and truly was a fantastic explanation for so many things. ‘And I think not having a piece of Voldemort lodged inside me sort of helps.’
McGonagall looked tired in a way she hadn’t since the war ended. Draco wouldn’t be telling her that, of course, but he made the observation in a quiet whisper to Harry who gave her a quick (not at all subtle) look and nodded his agreement. It wasn’t just McGonagall though, all the teachers seated at the long table behind her were looking tired and a touch defeated. The war was supposed to be over, their expressions said. He could read it in the tightness of shoulders, the sagging smiles, the way they’d each hoped the terror of Voldemort had been placed firmly behind them.
Harry shrugged and got to his feet. ‘It’s not my favourite, but sure.’
And there was just something truly terrifying about those two working together.
Ginny grinned but it faded a moment later as she recalled the incident. ‘He said some really awful things, about Harry too, when he realised we weren’t giving his concerns about you enough attention. I’ve never seen Charlie so mad, he threatened to go stay above George’s shop with Hermione – Ron couldn’t even figure out why he was mad! And then Percy suggested Ron thought he knew better than the curse breakers at the Ministry who check all the Ministry employees for enchantments every week, like we haven’t learned anything from Voldemort!
Draco sniggered. ‘You’re practically a Malfoy now.’
Hadn’t he once tried to explain something like it to Hermione – and with Ginny’s help? But here in this moment it was something silly, something that was completely removed from the ridiculous pureblood ideology that had driven so many witches and wizards to join Voldemort. There was a very large somewhat sentient plant on the other side of the conservatory door and Draco and Luna took it as expected but Harry was caught off guard.
There would be plenty of people who objected to her plans and ideals and would be more than willing to take action to prevent her making those sweeping changes that threatened their way of life. Her parents would always be an easy way to threaten her and keep her in line. Just like any family she did have would be. The difference, of course, being that any magical family she had would be protected by wards and magic. She couldn’t give her parents that. As muggles, they relied on their own technology and that wouldn’t work with magic. Granger couldn’t give them the same magical protections she and Weasley would have, she couldn’t protect them.
‘Good.’
‘Would you still have kissed Ginny?’ Draco wondered.
‘Is that the window from the fifth floor charms corridor?’ she asked, studying the glass in his shoulder curiously.
Harry laughed and warmth flared anew in Draco’s chest. He’d had so many fears for things to come once he’d returned to Hogwarts. He’d feared Harry changing his mind and turning his back on everything they’d built over the summer. He’d feared Granger and Weasley driving a wedge between them and forcing Harry to choose between his friends and his boyfriend. Draco didn’t know if Granger was recognising that choice, if she was seeing it standing there and had made a conscious effort not to put Harry through that. Or maybe there was no effort needed, maybe she was seeing what Andromeda saw in the way Harry’s shoulders were lighter, the weight of grief slowly lifting off his shoulders. The way somehow, despite history saying it should be otherwise, Draco managed to bring the light out in Harry. That despite the war and the losses, that Draco could make Harry smile and laugh. That maybe he really was the one to give Harry the love he deserved.
Not that anything she saw right there on the platform did.

How different would things have been if he hadn’t been forced back into that house after third year? How different would things have been if only Dumbledore had explained the reason he’d wanted Harry to learn Occlumency? If, if, if, so many different variables, so many different ways in which Dumbledore could have acted that would have saved Harry so much pain and loss. So many different conversations that could have led to the war ending sooner, that could have led to Harry understanding his role and being better prepared. How many months had they wasted traipsing across Britain and hiding from Voldemort because they didn’t know enough?
Harry glanced at him and Draco winked at him over the rim of his mug. Harry might have taken his hand, but Draco had both firmly wrapped around his tea, allowing the hot contents to warm his hands. Draco’s mother would have been horrified to know both of his elbows rested on the table (Kreacher had already given him a disapproving glare). Harry had to settle for wrapping an arm around Draco’s waist and drawing him tight against his side.
‘Don’ feel o-okay.’
‘Great.’ Harry waited a beat and then said, ‘We really need to talk to Bill about this.’
‘It was,’ Harry disagreed anyway. Before Draco could argue further, he added, ‘But it shouldn’t have been.’
‘Well,’ she laughed. ‘Can’t say I didn’t see that coming.’ She patted him on the shoulder and wandered away.
‘Potter,’ his father had sneered. The sneering had helped Draco get a grip back on the reality where he was standing in his father’s cell being told he must marry Harry and they
‘What?’ he tilted his head back against her mattress to look at her with a laugh. ‘What do you mean?’
Harry winced at his words, but Draco didn’t think he was wrong and clearly Harry had thoughts about this as well. He just didn’t seem willing to voice them to his upset friend.
‘Huh.’
the threshold of the ward. He could feel its push and pull just a half step inside the open front gate. He assumed the others could only feel the push, the gentle shove to move away, to avoid trespassing. It was subtler than Draco had come to expect from Voldemort’s protected houses, he didn’t think this one was going to be concealing anything too exciting.
‘With what?’ he asked, trying not to make his relief at the distraction obvious.
If Harry was awake, some part of him was touching and holding onto Draco. He held his hand, sat pressed against him or curled against him, or looped an arm around his waist or his neck. At tables he hooked his foot around Draco’s ankle, rested a hand on his thigh, desperate for the reminder that Draco was there, that he wasn’t dead or gone or any of the things that his nightmares would have him believe.
‘You hadn’t slept in two days,’ he murmured into the side of Harry’s neck, remembering the way he’d gingerly wrapped arms around Harry in that cell and the way Harry had stiffened before he couldn’t hold himself together anymore and the last threads had let go before he’d buried his face in Draco’s shoulder and sobbed.
‘We probably should tell McGonagall.’
Hermione blinked. ‘Harry?!’
was sure to require would distract her few a few years yet. Hopefully, they had a good five years before children became a topic to worry about.
He wasn’t even sure what triggered this one. He’d been visiting Draco for a month, talking with him for an hour (or more if he got a sympathetic guard – Draco’s concept of time in Azkaban truly was woeful) every day and although it had been about clearing the air between them at first (the confrontations over their past had not been pleasant at all – his temper had gotten the better of him more than once), now they could talk about other things as well.
The point of this conversation had been to lighten Harry’s mood after his nightmare about Sirius and so Draco changed the subject to a what-if that was lighter, funnier. ‘What if Granger and Weasley had realised how much time you spent watching me
Draco sighed; Harry knew why he’d asked. A first year muggleborn would only have heard stories about Draco, she wouldn’t have seen anything herself to suggest she should be properly afraid of him. She wouldn’t know anything about the war and Death Eaters other than stories and whispers of her fellow students, most of which, Harry bet, sounded ridiculous and heavily embellished to a kid who’d been living obliviously in the muggle world. When McGonagall had told her to ask Draco for help, that had been enough to trust that she could approach him.
‘Why?’ Harry seemed genuinely taken aback by his suggestion.
‘It’s quite something, isn’t it?’ Luna mused. ‘Watching them duel?’
Draco smirked as he started to unlace his bracers. ‘I killed her.’
Although Harry had never really thought about it before, there really hadn’t been all that many students in their year. There hadn’t been many in the ones above either. In fact, he thought Dennis Creevey’s year might have been the largest and he didn’t think by many. But he supposed that made sense in a way, it gave wizarding couples long enough to be secure in Voldemort’s fall before they decided it was safe to have children. He imagined there’d been a lot of people afraid to bring a child into a world full of Voldemort and that Harry’s temporarily putting a stop to his reign would ignite a desire to have those children in couples now free of that fear.
Hermione darted a look to Harry for translation before she took a moment to seemingly consider Draco’s words. Harry took the opportunity to help himself to some bread to dip in his soup. It was on the later side to be having lunch in the Great Hall, most of the other students were already dashing off to their afternoon lessons but he didn’t have any more classes for the day and Draco and Hermione had an extra hour free because Professor Vector had been struck down with the flu. He imagined Draco had plans to spend more time researching the last curse on the Carrow property.
‘They’re your family because they love you not because you’re the Weasel’s friend.’
He wondered what she saw when she looked at it. The room she shared with Lisa Turpin was quite small in comparison, with the two beds reasonably close and a bathroom that was perhaps a touch too small to easily share. The room Longbottom was once again sharing with Weasley, looked about the same, though it might be a bit more spacious now, given it no longer had a third bed crammed in. Having been inside the room Hannah shared with Susan Bones, Draco knew that the rooms were all the same, beds and just enough floor space to move about and a bathroom to share.
Minutes later McGonagall’s fury was palpable as her magically enhanced voice boomed throughout the castle, calling back all of the teams spread throughout the castle and the grounds.
‘Harry, my boy, are you alright? What’s this about a spell?’
When they arrived in the Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom, Granger and Weasley were sharing a table toward the back by the windows. Harry made straight for the table behind them, leaving Draco little choice but to follow. Weasley stiffened when Draco settled on the chair beside Harry but didn’t turn around to say anything. They sat in weighted silence as the rest of the eighth year and seventh year Gryffindors and Slytherins filed in.
‘Yes, and Snape acted like a five-year-old and threw a temper tantrum until he resigned.’
‘Become a famous quidditch player so I can shamelessly take advantage of your love for Harry and make you come and run some quidditch lessons in the off season.’
Draco laughed, standing out of his crouch. ‘He definitely will not be marrying, Ginny,’ he informed Carter, to their dad he said, ‘The
‘I did.’ They lay in silence for a while before Harry continued, ‘I told you everything.’
‘I’m going to send a letter to Pansy,’ he decided, changing the subject. ‘I’d like her to hear it from me, not the papers. Although,’ he grinned, ‘the look on her face might be worth the surprise.’
‘Mate,’ Harry said with a shake of his head, ‘shut it before she curses you.’
I quite frankly adore this chapter. So full of fluff and those glorious soft moment you may just die. Try to hold off long enough to leave me a comment please!
He’d missed them, but he was glad they’d not been around.
‘Of course,’ Granger nodded. Surprisingly, she looked just as worried as Sprout. ‘Be careful.’
Some days he did remember. He wasn’t sure which was worse.
‘Because it’s a bloody stupid idea,’
‘I still love you.’
Weasley wasn’t helping.
This time Draco snorted and delighted in offering, ‘If I sleep bound with Harry, I can be up in one.’
Harry smiled at him but turned back to Granger to gently inquire, ‘Why did you choose to erase their memories?’
But he would not be telling Ron or Hermione, that, not yet at least.
Harry had to laugh at the astonished look on Hermione’s face. He could admit, he’d been just as surprised by the news as she was when Draco had explained what fifth year had been like for him and the other Slytherins. Luna had not been surprised at all, nor had Ginny. Although, in retrospect, that year Ginny had gone through quite a few boyfriends – and Fred and George had hardly been surprised by that – so perhaps Harry shouldn’t have been so surprised.
‘You two made the front page,’ she told them and there was something in her tone of voice, something in the way she looked between the two of them that had Draco looking down sharply, alarm tightening his mouth.
. He didn’t want someone in his life who was just going to leave him over something that made him happy. He hoped Ron had come far enough since the war to see that, but it didn’t matter, not in the end.
‘Of course, he has,’ Harry agreed. ‘We all have.’
Ginny slumps in her chair, throws her head back to glare at the ceiling but he doesn’t think she’s actually seeing it. ‘I never really hated you until then,’ she murmurs, her words obviously meant for Draco. ‘You were always a git but you’d never really done anything to me personally – aside from the occasional insult – until you took all of Harry’s attention when we were finally dating.’
Longbottom’s eyes went wide. ‘Wedding?’ he asked incredulously.
While Harry had been just as inclined to cool detachment and snarky disinterest (even if Draco had been dead set on teasing him and demanded his attention with his actions and remarks). It was Ron’s hatred and perhaps his own fears and insecurities that had turned Harry from merely disliking Draco and then ignoring him into something more. He’d wanted to keep Ron’s friendship and it was startling to realise that even in the beginning when he’d not liked Draco and thought he was a bully, he’d still not been especially quick to assign blame and hate on him.
‘Get dressed, Potter, before your Weasel comes looking for you.’
Things had been so easy in those last weeks of the summer before Hogwarts and the outside world intruded. He wished he could go back, could have that easy feeling again where no one questioned what he was doing or feeling. Where he’d felt like he could finally breathe with the weight of the horcrux hunt no longer on his shoulders. With Voldemort finally, truly, dead and gone. It had been the first summer he could remember where he could just
‘Yes, yes, I was a horrible person,’ Draco waved a hand dismissively. ‘That was mostly to Gryffindors, though,’ he conceded. ‘I had no problem with Hannah and the rest of the Hufflepuffs.’ He glared at Weasley. ‘She
‘Love of your life, right?’ Hermione smiled widely.
Taken aback by his question, Hermione answered more honestly than she perhaps might have another day. Though maybe not. She, after all, was trying to support his relationship with Harry – although some days he didn’t know why and he wasn’t sure she did either. ‘I know they didn’t like him very much.’
The Hospital Wing always had a distinct smell. Harry had spent enough time there as a patient to recognise it anywhere. In those first moments of waking, head shrouded in fog and eyes cloudy because he wasn’t wearing his glasses, he would never call the smell comforting, but it was recognisable. He smelt it and he knew that even if he didn’t know how or why, he was safe and there was someone looking out for him. He’d woken slowly, he’d woken abruptly, he’d been shaken and jerked awake in the Hospital Wing, but each and every one of those memories had included a feeling of safety and the knowledge that, stern though she was, Madam Pomfrey was doing everything she could to help him.
Unfortunately, now that he’d seen Ron looking to talk to him – and looking like a kicked crup – Harry was stuck thinking about him. He’d done a decent job of avoiding Ron, not an easy thing given they shared all their classes and a common room, but he’d not been as successful in avoiding thinking about him. He’d tried to make it abundantly clear that he didn’t want anything to do with the man and, although the sad wistful looks Ron had been shooting at him (and Hermione) were starting to border on pathetic (Harry was stubbornly agreeing with Draco here even if Hermione wasn’t), Harry still felt no desire to smile and accept apologies as though he was perfectly willing to let everything go back to how it had been before.
And he could give her that.
‘You didn’t want to see it,’ Draco answered. ‘And honestly, you didn’t need to then. You needed Weasley but you don’t now and as fun as playing with what-ifs is when it’s you and me, this is only going to make things worse.’ He pinched Harry’s side none to gently. ‘You can’t change the past Harry, but you can make sure you don’t make those same mistakes again.’
‘Ginny,’ he says her name on a sigh, warily and with enough awareness to know that his words are going to be painful (for her) but he needs to say them. ‘I’m in love with Draco.’
Harry scrubbed a hand over his face, shoulders slumping. ‘I can’t do this right now,’ he muttered. ‘There’s no fucking spell.’ He turned to Draco. ‘Let’s go.’
‘I love magic. And I’m not about to let them win. Why should I be ashamed of being a Slytherin? Why should I be ashamed that I made a choice to save myself and my friends?’ Pansy shrugged. ‘I might regret it, but I wouldn’t take it back. I can’t take it back.’
‘No,’ he’d agreed, ‘but you can put a stop to them for a night – just one – so that we can deal with what’s causing them.’
There’d certainly been enough of them who were likely even now settling into their own beds and thinking they’d gotten away with murder.
Startled at being addressed so politely (and formally), Draco’s eyebrows shot up and he looked at the girl with his usual cold expression until Harry kicked him under the table.
‘It took her two years to warm up to the idea of me and Fleur enough to meet with her parents – four months is an improvement.’
‘And you’ve got a great arse,’ Harry informed him, as he trailed after him.
‘I’m sorry – WHAT?’ Harry squeaked. ‘Draco what the fuck are you talking about?’
Harry had just enough time to exchange an amused look with Hermione before their dinner (and conversation) was interrupted by a patronus from Robards and he’d had to leave the first proper opportunity he’d had to talk to Ron without having to pull him aside and start out with the whole not quite straight bit and lead on from there. Anytime since then, he would admit, had just been him avoiding the conversation in the hopes that Ron would do the hard part and bring it up. Because Harry was beginning to feel like talking to Ron was going to be a big deal when it hadn’t been for anyone else.
The man stared at her in surprise, green eyes just as vibrant as she remembered, although they weren’t hidden behind glasses anymore. ‘Hermione?’
In the end, telling Molly and Arthur had been easy and all the other Weasley’s after that had just sort of happened. Bill, because he’d been at the Manor working on a tricky curse they’d unearthed in the dungeon and had walked in on Harry and Draco snogging in the kitchen. George had found out when Harry and Luna had dragged Draco into the joke shop and something about their interaction had twigged for George and rather than be angry or hurt – or, fuck, even betrayed because Draco had done some terrible things with people who had gotten Fred killed – he’d laughed himself silly for a solid three minutes.
Draco locked eyes with Harry across the table as the Gryffindor winced. Knowing exactly what was now running through the man’s head Draco pointed his fork rather aggressively at Harry and snapped, ‘No.’
He might have been dressed warmly, the beanie on his head covered the tip of his scar, and he didn’t need his glasses anymore, but he was still easily recognisable as Harry Potter. While it wasn’t always a comfortable thing, being so easily recognised, the worshipful adoration had died down a bit in the last month or so and people had stopped rushing up to him asking for a handshake or (embarrassingly) his autograph. Draco likely helped with that. People were strangely hesitant to approach him when Draco was around, they’d smile and wave but wandering about with a convicted Death Eater made people second guess their approach. As though Harry was busy working or doing something they didn’t want to interfere with, thanks to the articles in the
He’d had to come back from Romania just to ask what the hell his mother was talking about and there’d been a spectacular row between them that Harry (thankfully) had not been around for, but from what he understood it had involved a lot of shouting, a lot complaints about being very happy being single (‘Thank you, very much Mum!’) and one last shouted complaint about how he’d be perfectly happy waiting a bit longer for the right guy if it was all the same, he wasn’t in any hurry to settle down.
Ron didn’t know who Scorp was. He didn’t know why Hermione seemed to and he didn’t know why Draco Malfoy was apparently joining them for dinner.
He didn’t see how he could avoid it now, especially when Hermione had to take him by the arm and steer him away from the not-at-all repentant looking fourth years and back toward the relative safety of the eighth-year common room. Thankfully, as it was actually quite a nice day outside and, as the eighth years had the freedom to go into Hogsmeade whenever they felt the need, the common room was deserted. He stomped over to the large curved window seat and climbed up to rest his back against the wall, knees drawn up so that he could gaze moodily down at the forest.
‘Not all of us, Granger,’ one of the seventh year Slytherins contradicted with a dark look.
Draco shrugged, unconcerned. ‘I’m not really in the mood now.’
He wasn’t nervous when he stepped out of his office and called attention with the quick and efficient use of
‘So instead you live in between both?’
Draco had a mouthful of toothpaste and shot him a look in the mirror.
Speaking of lists. ‘Do you have a course list for all OWL and NEWT subjects?’ he asked McGonagall before he turned to Hermione and asked, ‘Can you make a list of subjects muggles are taught in school that we really should be learning here as well?’
to follow Voldemort and listen to my parents long after I learned to think for myself.
And he was just really fucking grateful Ginny hadn’t been home and that neither Molly nor Arthur had found the time to mention that little outburst to Draco. He’d never – NEVER – live that down.
Thank you for the continued support you have shown me and this fic. For the first time, I'm posting a chapter that I'm not 100% sure about. But I've rewritten this multiple times and even added more when I did the final edit yesterday and it's going live whether I like it or not.
‘Thank you.’
‘No,’ Ginny reassured him, bringing him back to the topic at hand. ‘This is about Ron – and maybe a little bit about Harry.’
‘Oh Harry,’ his mother whispered, ‘wherever did you find them?’
‘Ginny.’ Draco turned a page with a gentle glare aimed at the book (not Harry). ‘Also, Bill,’ he added.
Hermione, who was risking life and limb by staying over the shop with George for the holidays, had visited the Manor more than once. She’d braved her own memories of the war and her torture at Bella’s hands to show her support for Harry. Ginny, who didn’t have any memories of the war regarding Malfoy Manor, had easily followed Luna through the floo every morning with the reasoning that she couldn’t stand looking at her brother’s mopey face every day.
‘Mister Potter,’ he snapped, ‘am I to understand you find something funny in our discussion on duels.’
Draco held back his grin.
‘He never chose Draco over us,’ Hermione said, and it was true. He hadn’t, not until Ron had made him and even then, even then it hadn’t been choosing Draco over Ron it had been choosing someone who loved and cherished him over the friend who hurled slurs designed to hurt just because he’d learned something he didn’t like.
Draco’s lips quirked sardonically. ‘Certainly not. I was a pathetic excuse for a Death Eater, they never told me anything.’
Harry frowned. ‘I buy Hermione books sometimes.’ He looked over at Ron, waited for his friend to catch his eye and then said softly, ‘You’ve always been a bit weird about money, mate. I didn’t want to make things uncomfortable.’
Ron didn’t know any of that, didn’t know what had really happened to Draco during the war and so he took the evidence of Draco’s words and his taunts and the Mark on his arm and he called him Death Eater still. Oh, he might have some suspicions, he’d been just as horrified by some of the things the Ministry had done to Draco, but he’d never quite settled on feeling as though Draco didn’t somehow deserve it.
‘I want to hate him so much, Pansy, but he loves me and I don’t even know what to do with that.’ He looked at her beseechingly. ‘What am I supposed to do with that?’
The look on Slughorn’s face was priceless and the moment his back was turned he and Harry glanced at each other and shared a laugh.
Draco hadn’t been offended. Neither had Harry.
Amusement sparked in her eyes and with a mischievous grin she said, ‘You can go have sex now.’
‘Fucking hell,’ the man, who was definitely Harry, swore. He dropped the potion phial he’d been cleaning back into the sink with a clunk and after hastily wiping his hands on a tea towel, barrelled across the kitchen and swept her up into a crushing hug.
Now it was different. Now they thought they knew what he was capable of and it scared them. Now, he was a true Death Eater in their eyes and not just the son of one. Where before there’d been anger and righteousness, now there was true fear. Now they looked at him and they didn’t sneer and remember the boy who threatened to tell his father. The boy who played up an injury to get exactly what he wanted. They didn’t see the rich and arrogant git with the father who could buy anything he wanted, even the Minister for Magic.
had been publishing recently. It was light on embellishment, contained only basic details that the public should know and – and this is what truly impressed Draco – was stunningly accurate in detail and the conclusions drawn.
of July in a robe shop in Diagon Alley.
Ron and Hermione sputtered, outraged, but Harry just rolled his eyes. ‘Draco isn’t stealing my money,’ he told them, reaching for more bacon. Which was true, he wasn’t stealing Harry’s money, he just wasn’t going to tell them that Draco was free to access his gold and not just because the goblins did like a Malfoy and were still mad at Harry about the whole dragon thing.
Ginny crinkles her nose. ‘That’s not healthy,’ she observes.
‘You don’t.’ This time Draco’s words were snapped, and Harry could feel the same argument they’d been having for days returning for round four.
Draco smiled winningly. ‘Probably a good thing you love me so much.’
He wasn’t wrong though. Draco hadn’t been there when the Hogwarts matron ran the first proper diagnostic on Harry, but he’d seen the aftermath. Madam Pomfrey had been adamant about dosing Harry with potions to treat the malnutrition of not only the year he’d been camping on the run but the many years of his childhood when he hadn’t had access to food or any kind of nurturing and healthy (emotional and otherwise) environment. Salazar, Draco wished he could curse those muggles Harry was forced to call family.
Her brother, slightly bolder now, blurted out, ‘Are you Harry Potter?’
‘Why was she giving you exercises back in third year?’ Ron asked over the top of Hermione who was voicing interest in Madam Pomfrey’s knowledge because, and Harry was well aware of this, the quidditch training at Hogwarts didn’t follow any sort of physical strength training like you’d expect from sports in the muggle world.
and he’d done it all in what probably looked like a blink to Ron and Hermione but it hadn’t been fast and it had been at times painful (bone density potions made Skele-Gro feel like a picnic) but now when he looked in the mirror he could see the man he should have been all along if only there’d been no Voldemort – or he’d had a loving family.
is always publishing serials in the back that talk about soul bonds and it’s all terribly romantic, but they always make out like it’s a choice, an actual binding spell or ritual that people commit to and that I guess can be undone. None of us had ever even heard about it happening naturally before.’
He swore.
With a glance at the front of the room to check that Joseph was still engaged in the same boring topic, Draco slid his chair closer to Harry’s and bent his head down to his ear to speak softly. ‘Do you think you’ve missed anything?’
Harry nudged Ron again. ‘Have you talked to Hermione about this?’
in a way I’ve never seen before. I’ve seen you laugh and smile and when you were with Ginny you seemed lighter, but when you’re with Draco – Harry the way you look at him, the way you look just being around him. You never looked like that before and I – I don’t know what to think. I missed this great big moment in your life! When you fell in love! I don’t even know how it happened. I missed those little moments, with the small smiles and the way you act like a complete idiot and I wasn’t here for you when you realised you liked a boy,’ she blurted out this last bit with exasperation and a twinge of something that might have been jealousy.
‘I hate your father,’ Harry assured him. ‘I’m never going to like him, but Draco, he loves you more than anything.’
Granger hesitated, eyes darting between Draco and Harry before she said, ‘It can. But Harry, everyone is already talking about that duel yesterday, people are going to start asking questions.’
Draco had stared at her agog. He’d floundered. His mother had trained him to always know how to react in any social setting but none of her training could have prepared him for that. In her own way, Ginny Weasley had both given them her blessing and likened what they had to some sort of epic romance from one of those novels his mother pretended not to like. Or a tragedy, it was a little hard to tell.
Terrified, Harry was momentarily frozen but then Ron was there, gently taking Draco’s other side and prompting Harry into action. Together they turned around, moving as quickly as they could to get Draco to the hospital wing.
Molly had come over for her weekly tea with his mother and Andromeda (still such an uncomfortable arrangement for Draco) and Draco and Harry had sat them down and explained all that Bill had found. Eyes had welled up with soft tears and smiles so wide as all three witches expressed their feelings on the beauty of such raw and powerful magic. Draco thought this, more than anything, had been the final piece needed for Molly and Arthur to truly accept him in Harry’s life. How could anyone raised on magic not find beauty in two souls binding together in such a natural and gradual way? Although nothing had so far been said, there was something in the way Molly looked at him now, a softening in her eyes and her touch, that suggested she’d come to fully accept his place in Harry’s life – as a soon-to-be member of her family.
Of all the things they’d spoken of throughout the afternoon, this was the thing that had Pansy choking on a mouthful of whiskey. She coughed and sputtered trying to clear her throat as she gaped at him with wide, disbelieving eyes. He nodded, agreeing wholeheartedly with her sentiment.
Harry cut him off. He didn’t need Ron going off on a worried rant thinking he’d offended him and that was why he was staying away. ‘I’m going home with Draco.’
‘Yes,’ Draco replied shortly.
He’d looked at the both of them helplessly, not knowing how to interpret the expressions on their faces.
Draco freezes, his eyes flicking in alarm between Harry and Ginny.
Astara’s eyes brightened and she smiled. ‘Can we?’
Not that she didn’t have enough on her plate to be bothering her already. Draco did feel guilty for adding one more thing but there was no way they could have kept this from her, and Draco knew (without Harry having to tell him) that Hermione would want to be a part of Burbage Hall and any changes that were made to Hogwarts now. She would want to know that all those muggleborns who weren’t as lucky as her, would get the chance to learn about their magic in the future.
(See the end of the chapter for
They went down to breakfast together, Harry keeping close without touching him. He was too emotionally wrung out to be annoyed about the worried looks Harry kept shooting him. He knew he looked awful, he was pale, paler than normal, his eyes puffy in a way that thankfully suggested a late night and lack of sleep rather than tears (that had been about all his spell work could achieve). It helped that he had dark circles under his eyes.
‘You chose to yell at him for something he has no control over,’ Hermione pointed out quietly.
Harry snorted. But her words were softening him up, making him realise that most of his annoyance and frustration with her was stupid and misplaced because she wasn’t asking him all those tough questions – she was mourning the moments of his life she’d missed out on. She was his best friend and she was sad and upset and hurt because she hadn’t been there for him when he’d been feeling all of this. She was hurting because she was worried that he hadn’t had the support he needed while he was going through all of this.
He was disappointed but not unsurprised that there was only a single sentence scribbled on the page.
Amused but understanding the seriousness of her words, Draco smiled softly at her in return, grateful of the change in topic. ‘We’re good for each other. This isn’t just about sex, Gr-Hermione.’ Her name felt weird on his tongue, but he pushed on, ‘We were friends before he decided he wanted to get me naked. For months all we did was talk. This isn’t something we’ve jumped into and it isn’t something that’s going to end any time soon. I do love him, very much, even if I don’t always show it.’
Harry looked around again, viewing the room with new – sad – eyes. ‘I don’t know if you’ve ever realised this, Draco Malfoy – pureblood that you are – but magic is fucking ridiculous sometimes.’
‘Don’t ever think you don’t deserve to be loved,’ he said fiercely.
It changed some things. It didn’t change others. Now that she knew the truth, Harry was more open with her and Malfoy tried harder. She hated it. Hated that he could speak to her openly, genuinely, and have thoughts and ideas that she could get behind. He made her feel better about losing her parents and he did it in a way that tied back to feelings Harry had once had and it was baffling watching them be close and tender and hearing them talk about marriage and moving in together and building a future together.
‘Do you mean to tell me, those half a dozen flying lessons in first year weren’t enough?’ Draco teased.
So they’d made the move. There’d been shouts and fights and all sorts of tantrums about leaving friends behind and Nan and Pop, too but there’d been excitement as well. She and Ron had told the kids so many stories growing up and probably made Hogwarts out to be more of an adventure than it really was, but she still wanted that for her children.
‘Well I don’t know why else you’d be spending time with her.’
They must have thought they were getting real friendship, must have been so worried and afraid for him and hurt and confused when he dropped them as though they meant nothing. Because they had meant nothing. He’d watched Crabbe die in the fiendfyre and while he was sad, he didn’t mourn. Not like he should have been mourning, not like he’d lost a friend, someone he loved and treasured. Because he hadn’t, hadn’t been capable of it.
‘I think my
‘I don’t like you, I don’t think I’m ever going to like you, but Harry does and Hermione seems to be coming around and – bloody hell, you’re friendly with Bill and Ginny and Luna adores you…’ he trailed off seeming confused by his own words. ‘You let Greyback into the castle and nearly got Bill killed but he thinks you’re alright. Fleur can hold a grudge like the best of them and she doesn’t hate you for what you did to Bill. I guess what I’m saying is – what I mean is – ugh why do you have to be such a slimy Slytherin?!’
