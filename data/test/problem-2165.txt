Today, they’d started early with a review of the penitentiary documents and interviews, going back over the mish mash of wild rumors and eerie silence that surrounded the whole case. Nothing productive had turned up in almost a week. Word of mouth testimony from prisoners, which couldn’t be trusted, claimed that a man named Harry Black had started it all, but there wasn’t a shred of paperwork left on the mystery man who supposedly provoked the riot. The computers had nothing on him. Only a couple of guards had anything worthwhile to say, and one of them turned out to be a raging lush. Everyone else agreed that it was a war between rival gangs, which broke out because of agreements that had been dishonored and because of threats that couldn’t be ignored. Again, rumor placed the blame on a new arrival, and the only lead they had on that man’s whereabouts was a flimsy story about his being transferred to the SuperMax facility a day after the riot. No prisoner ever arrived at the SuperMax facility matching any description they had available, and the paperwork for the transfer seemed to have been lost in the shuffle of post-riot cleanup.
“I forget sometimes what it must be like to have a life different than mine. First it was training and war zones, then it was this. After sleeping in a tent while mortars go off and laying down covering fire while pulling wounded guys out of some hellhole, everything seems pretty blasé to me. It’s okay to be a little scared, but obviously you weren’t so frightened that you wouldn’t volunteer to throw yourself into the mix.”
“Oy! Harry, love! You daydreaming again?” Nymphadora Tonks-Lupin pulled Harry from his musings and back to reality. He’d been holding the same pen and staring at paper for who knew how long.
Draco had made his peace with wanting Potter over the summer, and, being no one's fool, he knew Potter wanted him. The stubborn, arse-stupid, bespectacled prat just wouldn't cave and admit it. Drastic measures were called for!
He knew it was insipid and childish to pine for Draco despite having seen him several times that day, but that knowledge didn’t lessen the restless hunger inside him in the slightest.
I signed up for basic training a week before graduation, and since I was an emancipated minor at seventeen, they let me in. I specialized and took additional training, and I was visiting every hot spot in the world between the ages of nineteen and twenty-two. Then I came back and asked for the job I really wanted.”
Draco the Younger, Lord Malfoy, knew nothing in his mesmerized stupor. He cradled the book in reverent hands, and did not know that he stood with it so held. His mouth moved as he read the words like a litany, half known from memory and half as his eyes flicked across the surface of the page. What moved him was no part of himself, but another will entirely. He could not recall the door opening or closing behind him, nor was he conscious of his steps down the hall. His feet were sure on his path, but still he never lifted his eyes from the pages.
The door creaked, and Minerva MacGonagall stepped into the room quietly, her demeanor grim in spite of the early morning hour.
The wine had started to take its toll. Bottle number three was almost empty, and Draco surveyed the wreckage. The elves had been cleaning constantly, since he’d made a habit of flinging his empties at the wall or at other breakable objects. What was it he’d said…then…
"No...", she said softly, "I get it. There is a way to undo this...reversals are a whole field of study I've worked in extensively...and, Malfoy...Draco...you were right, I was wrong. I needed to hear this. Harry can be brought back to normal...but unless his memory is erased he won't ever be the same, and we can't erase that much of his memory without damaging his mind, so that's out. It won't be easy to pull this off if he knows people are trying to help him.
The analysis of sounds in the background of my earlier phone conversations with Blaise indicated a high likelihood of a liquor shelf or cabinet in his bedroom or study. The seats in there are leather. We could tell by the creaking, squeaking sounds it made as he sat down or moved. This will get me where I want to go, and it’s so easy it almost makes me ashamed. He sees the look on my face, and he knows what I have to say won’t be easy to hear. At least he has the nerve to hear it.
As soon as he reaches the table, the woman by his side moves to the far edge and takes the seat to one side of Harry, while the rest of us take our seats now that Sir Dumbledore has taken his own. The hall is full of the sounds of clattering silverware as people make ready, and servers are emerging from the kitchens with platter after platter. His head is already turned to Harry while the food arrives, and I’m amazed by how clear his voice is, even if he sounds tired, the way the very old always do. He could have been an actor on stages with a voice like that, and been heard clearly in the back of any hall anywhere.
Harry puts the chair down beside the bed, and this Doctor Snape starts laying out things I recognize on the nightstand. Blood pressure, and glucose testers, vials, syringes, something like litmus papers for simple blood tests. A small, portable microscope and more.
“Hah! AHAHAHAHA! Heh! Oh dear! Not the worst thing I’ve been called in my many years of life! Relax, my boy! Your only enemy is fear itself…not me…I assure you of that!”
“Stop. Don’t promise what you can’t give. You’re human. We both slipped up in different ways. Maybe it will happen again. Maybe not. There’s something else I’d like to talk about, so let’s just put the last two weeks to rest, okay?”
I tense as he sucks gently at the head of my prick, lavishing the same care upon it that I do upon his, and when I tense, the thing he slides wetly into me meets resistance, but just enough to make it all the more interesting. I can’t last like this. I keep popping his cock out my mouth to gasp for air and cry out involuntarily…I’m noisy when I’m excited, and I’ve never been excited like I get for Harry. I can’t even maintain a stroking pace on his cock when I start to come. I lose control so easily, but I guess I never wanted control to start with. I want it taken from me, but only by someone who would use it mercifully…with love guiding their hand. Harry does. My hips are bucking because I’m coming into his mouth, and the head of my cock is frantically sensitive, and the toy is tapping gently in without so much as a pause in his pace. The sounds I make are guttural, more animal-like and keening than human. Reduced to howls and pants of lust and desperate release.
Also out of breath. He’s wearing a crisp white shirt with no collar, open at the throat, and black slacks that show the quality of his tailor. He’s barefoot, and his hair is still short from the prison cut he’d been sporting. He must have stopped to clean up before he came here. He looks impeccable, as comfortable here as I imagined him. The eyes. His eyes are still hypnotic. Sparkling green, impish, as if he’s laughing at the world in silence, and deep, like the glimmer of water at the bottom of a long, dark well.
“WELL, I’M NOT HIM! I’m not here to kiss your sorry ass or stroke your pathetic ego for ratings! I'm not here to get famous or be liked! I recommended a diet that wouldn’t aggravate the tension that is natural for you to feel! I recommended exercise, which is the healthiest natural way to alleviate or at least mitigate the symptoms of stress! Ever wonder why stress tics manifest as involuntary muscle movement? Stress is energy…it has to go somewhere. If you bottle it up, it leaks out. You ignored what I told you…because it wasn’t ‘fun’ or ‘cool’…and now you’re reaping the results.
“Isn’t there a way…we could…bypass this? Couldn’t you believe that it won’t be what it sounds like? Tell them that…that Durmstrang made it sound like it was only my fault. It would be true. I swear it.”
All of this was on Harry’s mind when he entered Minerva’s office and took a seat while she sorted out a few papers, acknowledging Harry with a smile and a kindly nod while she furiously scribbled away. Minerva tucked her quill back into its holder and took a deep breath.
Hermione’s glance was a soulful one, full of unspoken sympathy. “And you’re still serious about leaving here at the end of term…aren’t you? You’re really going to reopen Grimmauld Place? I ask because…if you’d prefer, we wouldn’t mind you staying with us awhile. I know the kids would love it, and it might seem a bit crowded at first, but you know we’d both love having you there.”
Hermione sighed. “I’m glad I was wrong about Draco. I know he wants you to be happy, and I know he’d put himself through nearly anything to do it, too. Seeing you…like this…I know it’s right. You deserve to be happy, Harry. We would never want to take that away from you.”
The hand wrapped around his penis suddenly vanished and Harry looked up in wide eyed shock as Draco pulled away entirely, hurrying to the bathroom with his pants still dragging around his ankles, hand held away from him like a biohazard and face twisted in a grimace of seeming agony.
’He didn’t really love me. Not the way I loved him. He must have…felt something. Like…or lust. Not love…or not enough love. He never lied to me. That’s why he never spoke about it. That’s why he always hushed me or changed the subject. He didn’t try to pretend there was more to it than there was. I did that. Ron was right. The others would have told me not to get involved with him. I didn’t want to hear it, because I didn’t want to believe it was true. There wasn’t anything else I could have done to make it work. I didn’t do anything wrong…not really. Except perhaps expecting too much.
“Yeah…I mean no…oh, hell. Not used to a place like this, I guess. Fish out of water, right? It’s cool…sort of…just different. I just didn’t want to talk shop right off the bat.”
Hermione had actually begun to worry. Harry had left Saturday evening for his date, and hadn’t been seen or heard from since. She’d looked for him at breakfast, and again at lunch, and the first faint sense of serious worry came when dinner was over and Harry STILL hadn’t been seen or heard from.
Diana had been the one constant joy in her life since the day she was born, and though many things had changed in Dora Tonks’ life, the joyful leap in her heart when she saw her daughter’s face hadn’t changed a bit. It had kept her going through working nights as an undercover cop, enduring endless gropings and touches during her time reeling in men for solicitation. She’d seen more than a few dirty cops as well as downright evil human beings in those times, and the overwhelming majority had been men. Could anyone doing that for a living have blamed her turning to women? The truth was that she'd been inclined that way as far back as she could recall...but like so many deeply personal things it was the one issue she hadn't tackled and dealt with immediately. It had taken years to come to terms with the fact that favored women over men by a wide margin, but eventually she'd worked it out in her own time and way.
The route to Slytherin was only interrupted by the appearance of Mrs. Norris, who gave Harry an irritable hiss despite his cloak being in place, and then she stalked away, probably in search of more visible prey. Slytherin’s password hadn’t changed, and Harry was into the common room as quietly as he could manage.
Harry made his peace with the task ahead of him, but the lingering concern was still with him…what damage was done to this boy before he made it to Hogwarts, and was it even the sort of thing that could be dealt with here?
Harry craned himself just a little and kissed the back of Draco’s neck. A soft little purr of contentment came from Draco, who scooted back a few inches, pressing his body tight against Harry’s, even in his sleep. Then, with a sleepy sigh of contentment, he settled back into the soft breaths that indicated deep and comfortable sleep.
How long will this job of Harry’s take? Will it just be one person? Other questions come to mind as well. Does he only kill gangsters? What about their families? Does he ever have to kill them too? Women…children? He’s a killer, and the professionals are paid to not ask questions. He has no choice about who the targets are. He’s like a gun…emotionless…distant from it all…a tool aimed in the direction of a target and fired when ready. Can a living weapon pick and choose the people it’s used against? I can’t imagine Harry killing women and kids. I can’t.
I feel a little chatterbox-like, but it’s nice to speak of trivialities instead of heavy things. The weather, which is unseasonably humid, given the lack of rainfall, and my thoughts on the town in general. Harry is quieter than usual. He’s thinking, but he is smiling while he’s thinking, so it can’t be too bad. It feels like he marvels at me every so often, soaking up the ambience that only I can provide. I think I like that. Yeah…I’m sure. I like it a lot.
“Dee is good enough for me when I’m looking like this. Drake is so formal. I think…just Dee will do. Nice to make your acquaintance, Ron.”
Students still often found DADA to be the most 'fun' class of any day, and it grieved Harry every time a harsh grade had to be delivered. There were few things more unpleasant than watching students fail despite the help they could be given, and he dreaded the end of every year, when OWLs and NEWTs were assessed and final grades handed out. The beginning of each year, however, was another matter, and it always started cheerily, with the Sorting Feast and fresh new faces. His mornings might still be marred by his need for drink each night, but with a Hangover Remedy at his nightstand, Harry was ready to face each day and extract from life the few, small pleasures he could find for himself.
I spent weeks healing up. They dealt with the physical trauma easy enough, but I couldn't be in a room with people or let people touch me without losing my cool for weeks. Couldn't sleep right without spells or potions, couldn't eat properly without getting sick, couldn't hold a conversation without snarling at people and unloading a string of purely verbal curses. It was a lot of time alone between therapy sessions. After getting the details out of Hermione, the ones she WOULD share, what was there to do but think about it all? Mostly about him.
“Bad just got worse. We got two dead Russians and what we think is a Czech national with no papers in a trailer behind a warehouse west of here. Looks like the lid is off Pandora’s Box, and it ain’t hope at the bottom of it. We gotta roll. You finished here?”
Admittedly, my life choices weren’t exactly stellar, but I remember how stunningly low Daddy’s credit card interest rates were. One guess as to why he got rates way, way below ten percent…he’s rich. Really rich. There’s no risk of payment failure, and he doesn’t really need credit, so it’s necessary to offer him a stunningly low rate to make it worth his while. The thirty percent plus endless fees that other people pay…makes up for the huge risk they take offering credit to people who genuinely can’t afford it…and subsidizes the great deals they offer their few exceptional clients.
“I knew you’d come.” It was almost a whisper. “I know what you want…don’t…don’t say anything. It’s your right. I owe you my life.”
Twenty years. It seemed like the blink of an eye. Draco wiped the tears from his face and tried to comport himself. Dinner would be served soon, and there were guests about. Perhaps he'd tell Harry of all this later, or perhaps not. Would any purpose be served by this hidden knowledge becoming known? Or was it like the secret of the Horcruxes, something to be carried to one's grave in silence, not out of shame, but to protect others from the harm that knowledge could wreak.
What the blazes was he doing back there?! Muttering some bloody ill-timed incantation? A soothing slickness suddenly became present, and Draco wondered for only a second where the adorable prat might learned such a thing. He was racking up a rather large list of things for which to thank Luna, and then reality kicked in when the heat of flesh was pressed against him, and Harry was looking him right in the eyes, looking surprisingly calm and patient for a man on the brink of entry. Draco closed his eyes after nodding his assent, and wriggled faintly against the building pressure.
“He came into the office…and he was furious. He ordered me to put my clothes back on. Once I was dressed, he started yelling about what I’d done. He was going to expel me…I think. He said he couldn’t teach me. I thought I’d be leaving here anyway, so I risked saying what I felt.
I can feel the arms slacken a little around me, the intentness of that gaze on the back of my skull, but I don’t want to look at him while I say these things.
I wanted to. God, I wanted to be angry forever. I wanted someone to vent everything that pissed me off through my whole life...someone to hurt to make me feel better. Then I realized I was just like him...before. I don't really want to go into exact detail on how that made me feel. I'll hand it to you lot here in St. Mungos...you're a fair hand at talking someone down from the edge of madness or suicide.
“Harry! I only went shopping for regular clothes before. I don’t have a swimsuit, or any beachwear. Now we’re out in the middle of, like, nowhere, and I haven’t a thing I can put on for the bea-”
His movements became more frantic and desperate, faster and shorter, legs clenching tightly while muscles he'd never imagined trying to use instinctively guided him toward release. With a strangled cry, Draco's cock erupted into the panties while he shook and trembled from head to toe, feeling tears well up from the intensity of the orgasm he was experiencing. Suddenly Harry pulled him away from the wall and into strong arms that held him upright while he almost collapsed, and he could feel Harry suddenly press himself deeper into Draco's body than before while he finally came as well.
It was staggering to imagine! Another time, another world, a place where he had indeed died and Harry grieved alone, while his son was left to who could guess what fate? Whatever that fate had been, it had shaped a man willing to alter the fabric of reality to accomplish a single, somehow both selfish and noble goal. This was the grey-eyed man in robes that had saved his life those years ago, and there could be no doubt, knowing as he did that the man had possessed an uncanny knowledge of Draco's private thoughts and deeds.
The sound of water running from the bathroom made Harry’s bladder tense while he let the pot brew. The articles from Draco’s divorce came back to him as he tapped his foot in the kitchen, waiting for enough to drip for at least small cup. Pansy had said a lot of terrible things about Draco, and though Harry had taken none of it seriously then, the accusations about Draco being a poofter suddenly came back to him. That added a new niggling thread of panic to the ‘cat’s cradle’ of irritation that already engulfed him. Plus, the bastard was taking all day in that loo while Harry was almost dancing in kitchen.
I say it with a smile, and we both know he’ll worry over me anyway. My time doing fieldwork is done, and we’re pulling into the empty shell of a building that welcomes being left alone. The resting hulks of machinery that haven’t run in years slide past us. The automatic entrance closes behind us, and the movement of the car triggers a set of small lights that illuminate our path to the elevator.
The games continue for a bit until people start drifting off to sit on the couches and talk. Harry leaves to chat with Blaise and Ron about the latest Quidditch match, which draws the attention of Ginny, Pansy and Draco. Eventually all of them are sitting comfortably around a knee-high coffee table, squeezed together in the slightly limited space, and Harry has a sudden feeling that this is what he wants his future to be like after Hogwarts. These people all together visiting one house or other and keeping in touch.
“Really. It was horrible. He never ate. I don’t know if he slept. He’d torture people the other Death Eaters caught and make the rest of us watch. Father walked around humiliated after he didn’t get the prophecy at the Ministry and then it was my turn to make up for it.” He looks down at the still exposed Dark Mark. “It hurt like hell when he put it on. And every time he summoned us it burned just as bad. I don’t know.” Draco shrugs, his words trailing off. “You can probably guess.”
He looks around at everybody, his fellow Potion Masters, past professors and other experts in the field and has to blink a couple of times at the sudden force of emotion that fills him.
“But…” and now Draco is entirely confused. He’s beginning to feel as if he’s missing something important and a terrible feeling grips him. “If you knew and you’re alright with it, then what was- why would you send me that letter while I was at Hogwarts?”
“You really believe we can do that?” Draco asks him, no bite in his words, just curiosity. “Work together after everything?”
"What?" He hisses back to the other boy. "Little busy here, Potter, not all of us grew up with this stuff, you know."
Valentine’s Day falls on a Sunday that year, and it’s a good thing too because Draco and Harry end up spending it in the toilets.
Draco thinks back to their years at Hogwarts. Of Potter rejecting his handshake and making it onto the quidditch team. Of the two of them playing against one another in Second Year and dueling. Draco remembered when he would send those stupid notes in class and make those jokes about dementors and when he’d watched Harry dance with Parvati at the Yule Ball and ignored his jealousy all night.
He urges himself to keep moving, to hide, to spin around and face Harry. To do something, instead of just stand there, feeling every second as if there's ice creeping through his veins and dread making his stomach churn.
It’s unfair of him to automatically expect drama with Draco, Harry thinks. In fact, since they’ve begun… whatever it is the two of them are doing, there’s been remarkably little problems. They bicker like they always have, even if it is gentler now and without the cruel intent behind it. Harry is sure they always will because, and he will admit this on pain of death, he actually enjoys most of their little disagreements these days. It’s evolved into something more lighthearted than he ever thought possible, and it’s just part of who they are together. The difference now is that Harry is actually endeared by all of the things about Draco that had used to drive him mental, and it appears the feeling is mutual.
Before they’d begun… whatever this is, they’d been friends. Not for long, but for enough time that Draco misses it now when it feels like he doesn’t have that friendship anymore.
Draco purses his lips in mock disapproval. “The whole point of this is to catch a very dangerous killer, Potter.”
Draco Malfoy. All of him, stripped bare. Everything he tries to hide, everything that he pretends in front of everyone else… it’s gone around him.
Then there is his throat and the other man’s wrists and don’t even get Harry started on what Draco looks like in the Quidditch changing rooms or his
“Hagrid?” Hermione says in surprise. “Oh, I forgot to visit him today. Dammit. Do you suppose I’ll have time tomorrow?”
Draco rolls his eyes, moving to the desk in his room and grabbing a piece of parchment and a quill. "What was it you came here for, you insufferable pillock?"
“Oh I’m not the one about to be satisfied.” Harry says and while Draco is lost giggling to himself at the horrible line the other boy moves further away. If Draco weren’t so busy laughing at him he might have been wondering what Harry is doing.
“No,” Draco bites out before calming down. “No. It’s just Potter being an arse, alright? Nothing new there.”
“How are you both?” Hermione interjects. “Been here long? I feel like Ron and I have been here for ages but it must only be a few hours.”
Draco hesitates before shaking his head. “No. She’s proud, yes, but she doesn’t think she’s better than
“Right.” Ron says doubtfully, chewing on a handful of caramel popcorn. “Well, good luck. And say hi from us, yeah?”
The disbelief and scorn is enough to make Draco lift his eyes. Something almost like anger sparks but doesn’t catch flame inside of him at the slight disapproval there.
Seconds pass and Slughorn keeps speaking. Draco nudges the notes towards Potter again and after a brief moment of hesitation the Gryffindor actually drags them over to start copying them.
Harry looks between the two of them and watches Hermione spin round. "If you think Harry will let you copy his work you’re even more ignorant than I thought." She says to the Slytherin. "Friends, do that, Malfoy, not people who hate each other."
After that the lot of them split up. A few go to the library together to do homework and a couple of others head for a walk around the lake.
“And I almost killed him in a bathroom.” Harry replies swiftly and without hesitation. “It was a war, Hermione.”
Draco feels incredulous and sits back a little more, stunned. He’s never ever thought that could be possible. “Never. What, are you trying to keep your virginity until marriage? Are you gay, Potter?”
“Nothing. I don’t know.” She shrugged half-heartedly. “Spin the bottle maybe? Watching him kiss Ginny like that?”
“I keep thinking about what Luna said. About how the two of us have always influenced each other, even without knowing it. How we’re connected, you know?”
“We’ll tell you all about our trip on the train,” Hermione says happily, brushing some of her hair out of her eyes. “My parents were so happy to see us, and-”
“Yes well, there was a lot going on.” Draco replies understandingly, their eyes meeting. Harry smiles.
But he needs to talk to someone. His mind is racing, his heart is buzzing and he’s torn between giggling and hyperventilating.
Harry almost doesn’t notice him slowly sliding his own underwear off, but when his cock bobs free to rise he gasps against Draco’s mouth, feeling the other’s lips curve.
A few minutes later they’re settled on the couch together watching the TV. A quarter of an hour later Lily and Draco come down too with James. The two kids dash for the loveseat and when Lily wins James huffs and moves to collapse into the armchair, legs crossed underneath him. Lily grabs the blanket draped over the back of her seat, a gift from Millie, and pulls it across her lap, already getting caught up in the film.
Relief sweeps through them both and Draco forces a laugh. Harry wonders if his mother notices the falseness of it.
But he doesn’t linger too long. Teddy is here and it has been a while since Harry has seen him. He’s excited.
He quickly reads the plaque and then looks back up. Snow rests on top of Lily and James’ stone heads and Draco pulls out his wand and whispers a
I also want to say a huge thank you to everyone who has read this story. It's taken a long time and I know it's not the ending any of you were hoping for (yet) but thank you all for being such wonderful and kind readers.
“Draco!” Pansy breaks the moment by hurrying forward to throw her arms around him in a tight hug. “Finally! We’ve all been waiting on you for ages, Blaise and Millie are already saving our compartment.”
“Thank God.” Draco slumps against the wall in relief before his grey eyes flicker back up to Harry’s with hope shining in them. “Now can I please kiss you?”
“Potter,” Draco says slowly, with a nod. The other boy glances at him. It feels like the other boy’s world may have just come crashing down and he’s in shock. Draco desperately wants to know the details, either for his own curiosity or for future gossip, but even he can tell that this isn’t the time.
Draco isn’t certain what he thinks of the man. The Minister clearly believes Duke is on his side, but after tailing the Auror through the Ministry a few days out of the week, all Draco could tell was the man was devoted to his job, and that was it.
When he stands up straight and turns back to his Head of House, she has turned her gaze skyward, eyes reflecting the moonlight like they had before. “The Astronomy Tower is off limits outside of classes,” she says, voice neither stern nor conversational. It simply is. “But I find coming up here to be quite calming,” she continues and Draco’s brows furrow in confusion. She looks down at him and for the first time there is an odd twinkle in her eye, but that could just be the stars. “IF one is working on extra Astronomy work, of course.”
“I’m rather curious of the cinema, if I am to be quite honest,” Draco hums, tapping his chin with his free hand. “Max won’t shut up about me finally seeing a film. Plus, Eve has offered to take us shopping.”
“Yeah? Why, was he not supposed to?” George questions skeptically, both he and Fred arching matching eyebrows.
“Of course I am. You're the Slytherin that turned all goody-goody, not me,” Theodore huffs, but Draco doesn’t comment any further. They both know that isn’t entirely true. Perhaps Draco had embraced his new lifestyle more fully than others, but it was clear Slytherin house was getting a wake up call beyond himself.
Theodore doesn’t look good where he crouches on the ground. His legs wobble some as he forces them under himself and pushes up, and when he sways back Draco reaches out to grab his arm and steady him.
Harry smiles brightly at that, his nerves seeming to vanish, and Draco smirks back before giving a pointed look at all the candy everywhere and arching a brow. Harry’s cheeks turn slightly pink and he glances over at the redhead.
“Okay, yes, hello everyone,” Ron waves his hands dramatically to cut off any further pleasantries. “Can someone please tell me what is going on, now?”
They enter the library and Draco smirks when he spots a familiar face lurking around their usual table. “Your boyfriend’s here,” he stage whispers as they sit down, Granger startling and looking around. It is Draco, however, who catches Viktor Krum’s eye when he glances over. The blonde immediately grins and waves obnoxiously at him.
“Thank you, Eve,” Granger nods over to the other muggleborn, clearly pleased to have her support, and Draco scowls.
Now, however, he finds himself curious. He was already in the forest, after all, so why shouldn’t he do some exploring?
“Is he here?” Draco asks, honestly curious. He’d thought of his cousin on more than one occasion during the summer, hoping he was alright and that Draco’s hard work hadn’t been for nothing, but he hadn’t heard anything. It made sense, however, since Sirius had been disowned from the Black family. Of course Narcissa and Lucius Malfoy wouldn’t talk about him.
When Draco finally manages to find his legs again and makes it down to the dungeons, he finds Eve, Pansy, Theodore, Crabbe, and Goyle all sitting around the fire in the common room. It’s pretty vacant otherwise.
As everyone calms down, idle gossip picking back up again and Draco and Eve beginning to plan how their evening is going to go, Tracey Davis, who has black hair that falls in a curtain around her face, and reminds Draco of what Max had once described “The Ring” to look like, speaks up from her corner.
He’s ready to head back to the dorms, but he takes a moment to enjoy the scene and even snap a few pictures.
“I am so sick of adults asking me that stupid question! How about you ask me what I want to do right now? Ask me where I’d like to be right now! I wanna go to the arcade and waste my money on Mortal Kombat! You really want
When the Lung Dragon article finally drops Draco has to be careful. Where, with all the previous articles, he had to keep his ears to the floorboards to find out people’s responses, when the final article on sentient, magical beings finally comes out, everyone is talking about it.
Draco watches, curious, as the room all works on the spell. While he hadn’t been present for the Patronus lesson, he’d been given plenty of explanations to know that this wasn’t going quite the same.
Hermione was a witch. She was magical just like he was. It made so much sense, yet so little as well. How had no one ever heard of this? How was this such a massive secret to the rest of the world? McGonagall had said the “wizarding world,” which insinuated it had to be big, but somehow it had remained a complete secret.
“To have you sacked on the grounds of a condition that has little to no bearing on one’s character, and that, through basic logic, one can determine you did not deliberately acquire, is a repugnant affair that should be openly admonished.”
Granger gasps, abruptly, and the room glances to her. “The Galleon!” she says in realization and Draco nods.
The diner across the street from the WW2 museum is so much brighter than Draco expected a Muggle establishment to be, and the food is positively delicious. He supposes they have a lot to make up for without magic, and whatever they’ve done to do that, they have succeeded.
“What are ye’ three doin’ here?” the giant man says, baffled, and Potter and Granger begin to scramble together some kind of excuse, but Draco is in no mood to wait.
“Oh! Houses!” Hermione suddenly exclaims after turning a page and Draco looks up. She was leaning towards the book a bit more than usual, eyes wide and flicking left and right.
Draco takes a few more moments to look over the map, reading the front where it states the creators as “Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs” and he knows, from the year prior, that those are Remus Lupin, Peter Pettigrew, Sirius Black, and James Potter. The Marauders.
“Apology accepted,” Draco says after a few breaths, because it was nice that Ron had come over so quickly to try and make amends. Draco didn’t know him very well, but he seemed like he would be a remarkably stubborn boy. “But I don’t think it’s fair to…” How to word this…? “I don’t think it’s fair to assume someone’s a bad person just because of, what? A house they’re sorted into?”
Bellatrix isn’t laughing anymore as she and Sirius face off. It looks like they had begun their battle with Sirius moving to keep her away from the children, but they had twisted and danced in circles until it was the other way around. With mounting anxiety, Draco realizes Sirius - who is joking around like this is nothing - is being backed towards the arch in the middle of the room.
“That is what I just said, yes,” Draco arches an unimpressed brow. “I avoided such a thing in fear I might upset those dreadful family members of yours.”
“We should spy on them!” Fred speaks up suddenly, eyes coming alive with a fire that makes Drace weary.
“Oh, good, I was getting worried you were growing roots there, for a second,” Potter shoots back and grins as Draco glares. Halfway there Draco realizes Potter still has his arm hostage, but makes no immediate move to free it.
“Yeah… I know,” Harry mumbles, and his free hand comes up to cup the back of Draco’s head, blunt nails scratching at the shaved hairs there. “Sorry, I’m just getting caught up in my own head. Again…”
“We won’t let you go splat, Draco,” George assures, slipping over to sling an arm around Draco’s shoulders and giving him a friendly jostle. “Don’t expect us to go easy on you during the game, though. We intend to win!”
“What are you reading?” Potter says quietly, his voice rough. It is clearly not what he really wants to say, but Draco decides to humor him.
Draco hadn’t thought of that. No one in Slytherin openly talked bad about each other, believing they couldn’t, that it would be betrayal, and the students at the Gryffindor table didn’t bring it up often anymore around Draco and Harry. Hermione, on the other hand, had probably heard, or even witnessed, far worse stories about these people than Draco. Of course she would be worried.
It made sense. Uagadou was known for their skills in Astronomy, and nearly every student there became an Animagus due to their pride in self-transfiguration. Professor Sinistra also tended to do a lot of wandless magic, waving her hand to clear away clouds or summon a telescope right into her palm. Wands were mostly European, after all, and Uagadou was famous for its wandless magic.
“Alright everybody!” Gemma calls, cutting into Draco’s mind. She was taking charge after Dumbledore had told the prefects to bring everyone back to their houses… Like Slytherin’s house in the
“Rescuing you, asshole!” Eve’s voice snaps out as she and Tracey come hurrying through the doorway. They would have had to take a longer way around the debris, no thanks to Draco… Oops.
“You actually go into the Forbidden Forest to… what? Feed some random beasts?” Draco questions, crossing his arms as the two girls begin to pull out strips of meat and toss them in the direction of the herd. It would surely be a help. Whatever the corpse had once been would hardly feed the herd properly.
“I’m afraid that will probably happen often,” she warns. Right, Draco was famous, she’d said. He just hadn’t realized what, exactly, that would entail.
“Please don’t mention Weasley while we’re in bed together,” Draco drawls, laying on the double innuendo so thick it doesn’t take Harry long to splutter and grow flustered. The Gryffindor doesn’t give a vocal answer, rather grabbing one of Draco’s many, many pillows and smacking it against Draco’s face. The blonde grunts and scrounges up enough energy to retaliate by reaching forward and wrapping his arms around Harry’s waist, dragging him closer and nuzzling at the other boy’s neck until he shrieks with ticklish laughter.
“This is about Harry’s life!” Weasley argues, “You owe it to us!” Potter and Granger appear to agree with this, judging by their meaningful nods.
“I heard Amos Diggory crying over his son,” he admits, bringing up a hand to wipe at his face before a tear can fall.
He tells them that Barty Crouch once had a son. Barty Crouch Jr was a Death Eater and he had been sentenced to Azkaban by his very father. Sirius had been there, listened to the boy as he cried out for his mother, until his pleas, like everyone’s, faded away with every visit from the dementors.
Draco sighs deeply, rolling his eyes skyward, before finally settling on a record of Tchaikovsky, putting it on his record player before returning to his bed where the radio lies. The soft, piano music fills his room and starts to ebb away at his tight muscles. He’ll put on Nirvana later, he’s sure, but for now he needs to relax.
“That is quite the tale, Draco,” Dumbledore says once Draco is done, “Why did you not approach me with your concerns earlier? This was a very rash choice of actions for someone as logical as I know you to be.”
The swamp truly wasn’t going anywhere anytime soon, with students having to be brought across on boats by Filch. Filch, Umbridge, and the bad-Slytherins in the Inquisitorial Squad hated it, while everyone else saw it as a necessary inconvenience. The only person who seemed to like it at all was…
Finally, hearing enough of this self-pitying, Draco moves his hand away from Harry’s face. Instead he reaches down, circling his arm with Harry’s waist, pulling slightly until the other boy gets the hint and begins to carefully slide into the hospital bed with the blond. He’s so slow and conscious of each of his movements, and as frustrating as it is Draco allows him. He IS still hurting, and he doesn’t want to upset Harry any further.
Sirius swallows, looking away with a pained look on his face, but Draco isn’t done. “The adults should have stepped in a long time ago. Now, when you could arguably say we have a right to be a part of this fight, that we need to be, is when you’re all stepping in and making things messy. At this point it is too late to save them, save us, from this reality, so stop trying to.”
“Training your lions, I see,” snickers a voice behind them and all five boys turn around quickly, eyes narrowing when they spy Millicent, Theodore, and Pansy a few stands up from them. Millicent and Theodore are smirking down at them, vicious as ever, while Pansy looks up dreamily at all the sweaty witches and wizards in the air.
“That is…” Draco has to take a breath, because that one had hit him more than he’d expected. He didn’t want anyone dead, he wanted his society as productive as it could be. Just like his father was always saying. “That is not it at all what I want, you are being ridiculous. These people want to tear down--”
“It looked so official, though!” Draco replies, remembering Frederick’s comment, and he stands and moves towards the bin, hoping to pull out the crumpled letter and examine it for himself. Mr Nubble’s strong hand on his shoulder stops him, however, and he looks back at him pleadingly. He’s never gotten mail before…
Marietta Edgecombe was winding up to be the only person in the whole DA that Draco was suspicious of. Smith had proven to be devoted to the lessons and Blaise appeared to be enjoying himself with everything he was learning. But Edgecombe hadn’t calmed down throughout the entire year.
But he can’t. Not when he talks on a regular basis to a Muggle. Not when that Muggle’s voice pops into his head and makes him question everything he’s ever been taught. Not when said Muggle has no fear of calling him, a powerful young wizard, out on seemingly pointless matters.
“This is it, then?” Weasley mumbles as Draco stops to face the door, his hands shaking. He doesn’t know why he’s so nervous. Wyvern Dragons, as Eve had specified, were the dragons he’d always known about, and they were highly dangerous and wild. Lung Dragons, on the other hand, were meant to be intelligent and wise, even revered in legend as a holy beast rather than a monster.
As much as he did not enjoy hanging out with these two anymore, they always were very good at giving Draco their unbridled attention, and it was nice to have that for a few moments again, even though the situation was less than ideal.
“Both?” Harry shrugs. Sighing Draco finally turns and joins him, sitting on the couch and resting his face in his hands, decidedly NOT pouting. Harry has the nerve to laugh at him, nudging his shoulder, and Draco nudges him back a bit more violently.
Then, like a bucket of cold water, the Death Eaters arrive and Draco is out and running without a second thought. He momentarily feels bad for the Muggle family being tossed through the air and tormented, but then Draco is reminded that these are
Now it’s Draco’s turn to be cut off as something nudges his head, startling him, and he looks over. There is a thestral right in front of him, huffing at him, with a familiar scar over its left brow. It nudges at his cheek again and Draco tries, and fails, to fight off the smile on his face.
“What are you doing?” Harry asks Vivian as she pops her Halloween CD into the player. She grins at them then sets the device on a table in the middle of the room, headphones set beside them, muffled music already playing from them. She points her wand, a twisted thing with a metal handle, at the headphones.
Which was how they found themselves in Draco’s room, after everyone else had gone to sleep, trying to figure out Max’s gift. Max had said it was for Draco’s upcoming “adventures in preppy boarding school,” whatever that meant.
“Oh, now you find a plan crazy? And it’s one of mine? Mark the date, everyone!” Draco immediately snarks back, growing frustrated by Potter’s extended mistrust. At least they were speaking again, but Draco figured Potter was better than this. He was the “good guy,” after all.
They’re all exhausted from the night prior, for while they weren’t running after Umbridge like Draco had been, they’d still been up late, worried and anxious, with the rest of the DA.
“Yeah, you weren’t there when we first went in,” Theodore agrees, “You saw the calm version! You’re welcome.”
“I’m sorry,” Potter whispers, fingers curling more tightly into Draco’s hand, the nails digging into skin. “I… I had to, though… The portrait of Phineas Nigellus Black told me I was being a coward and Dumbledore sent the message to stay still, but…”
“Or treacle tart,” Draco snorts. Granger puts her pile of PopRocks into her mouth first, immediately giggling around the popping sensation.
for our next book club reading,” Draco is saying idly, twirling his wand around his fingers, “She wanted to know your opinion.”
When classes finally end for the day, he doesn’t hesitate. He rushes past the students and sneaks into Gryffindor Tower.
“Oh? Hum…” Vivian tilts her head back and squints at the sky, considering. “Tell you what… you take that broom o’ yours and test out my little lady, here,” she shakes her gadget for emphasis, “And I’ll give you as many pointers as you like.”
“Have you seen the giant squid?” asks the twins’ friend, Lee Jordan, who was trying to keep up with as many conversations as possible.
Draco remembers a distant memory of his father talking about people not being devoted enough to get better standings in society, of lacking a drive and wanting the government to pamper them. He doesn’t know why he remembers it, since it obviously doesn’t apply here. Draco has met Max’s parents, has even spoken to them a few times over this very radio, and he knows for a fact that they are very driven. Stubborn, even, and would deny any kind of pity.
” Draco exclaims and suddenly his clone is turning paler and paler, skin and robes melting into a single white, cartoon ghost that flies around the room in loop-de-loops. The rest of the class thankfully laughs. Draco doesn’t.
The twins eagerly agree to help Draco out with his plan when he poses it to them. He doesn’t want to wait too long into the term to go, wanting to get the information sent to Skeeter as soon as possible, so they aim for the first Saturday of the term, most people still groggy from their Christmas Breaks.
“Who are you? What do you want? Do you not know what time it is?” Vernon Dursley demands and Draco plasters on the fakest smile he can offer.
Granger bends over to catch her breath while Potter, also breathless but seemingly more motivated, lunges forward and grabs Draco’s upper arms. Draco immediately tries to break free, squirming and grabbing for his wand. “What the hell do you think you’re doing?! Unhand me!” he snaps, but Potter doesn’t appear to be in the right mind to listen.
“Neuroscientist, dumbie,” Eric hisses, shoving Max further down the booth and into Draco so he can sit too.
She may as well be salivating at the prospect of a brand-new scandal, but then her eyes sharpen and she looks to Draco suspiciously. “What’s the catch, kid?”
“You could really stand to lighten up,” Potter scowls over at him and Draco puts on his best “fake realization” face.
Draco cannot ask many questions in his household. “Why?” is the most heinous of questions, he has learned, and he is very careful when he asks it.
Eventually they all settle down, Draco still a giggly mess as Potter and Max talk more calmly. Max apologizes constantly, but there really aren’t any hard feelings. It’s a funny story, for the most part, and by the end of their conversation Max is more comfortable with the idea of glasses and how to manage them.
“Plus, they’re yappy,” Weasley adds oh-so helpfully, but looks away when Granger turns her glare on him.
That question has Draco shifting back, eyes cracking open so he can properly look at Harry, confused. “As I have mastered such an art, I would say I am quite familiar with it. Why?”
“It is a good subject. Misunderstood,” Krum says, nodding in approval as he is given his own book back. “Are you knowing of the vand light varning?” he asks.
This is mostly a what if idea I had. It changes SO MUCH in the story, I realized, I had to write it out and get it out of my brain! Hopefully y'all like it!
“Just because I do not share every aspect of my life with you, Potter, does not mean I am keeping secrets or am any less trustworthy,” he says simply. Not soft, not harsh, just straightforward.
It is then that Edgecombe’s eyes finally fall on Draco, who is watching her quietly from his chair, teacup in hand, and every, single, last drop of color drains from the girl’s face. Slowly, at an angle Umbridge can’t see him, Draco allows a thin, vicious smile to pull across his lips. Edgecombe knew that whatever she did now, whatever choice she made, she would be facing retribution.
But McGonagall is smiling at him again, much fonder and kinder than usual, and it stops Draco in his tracks. “Whichever one speaks to you,” she says with a nod, then motions with her hand for him to start looking around. Ah, right… more than anything this was a pet. A companion.
“Simple, really. This school has had three years of nothing but chaos thanks to The-Boy-Who-Pissed-All-The-Wrong-People-Off.”
“Yes, Queen Granger, protector of misfits,” he grumbles sarcastically, snatching his backpack and making room in one of its larger pockets for something toad-sized. Hermione is already taking over the search, he sees, telling Vincent and Greg to go one way down the corridor and look and then saying she and Draco will accompany the boy down the other direction. She apparently doesn’t hear the boy say he already went down the way Hermione wants to go, or maybe she ignores him, and off they go.
“Yes. In the end, I know exactly where to go and I can hold majority of the interview, but if we get into trouble I need the person with the most knowledge of the Ministry I can get,” Draco explains evenly, giving Weasley a displeased but resolute look.
Plus, she always smelled like flowers, helping Pomfrey tend to the local gardens or look after plant life in the Greenhouses with Longbottom. Draco had never actually seen Leandra and Longbottom in the same room at the same time, but he hardly went looking for either of them, either.
Now, she hands them both a small bowl of chocolate and vanilla soft serve and keeps the third for herself.
and on the interior cover is written, “If you ever need some hard proof to use against your father. -Hermione Granger.”
“Whoo, buddy, you heard right! My grandpa used to own an airboat he’d take us out on and we’d see gators all the time!” Max replies eagerly. “Gators are pretty chill compared to crocs, but they’re still massive, dangerous dinosaurs! You do not wanna mess with them.”
He grinds his teeth, pulling out his own wand in case things get messy, but then something is falling over his shoulders.
“This may just be me, but that does not sound like something you want to say to a fourteen-year-old.”
A few more moments pass, and Draco thinks they have fallen back into their regular silence, when Granger continues to find more to say. “It probably would have really made your father mad.”
about blood already! No one cares! Literally no one cares! You act like if he cut his wrists he’d bleed purple, or something stupid like that!” He was so sick and tired and this obsession with blood status within Slytherin. Sure, it was only a few people, but it was so, ridiculously ignorant and pigheaded that Draco was on his last straw.
Draco’s boggart was himself, but slightly to the left in terms of… everything. Like everything about him had been shifted. He looked the same, except his eyes were so much sharper, his posture stiff, and his nose high.
But they knew too little about all of this, and the Slytherin was far too exhausted to do anything more. He could theorize later. Right now, he wanted to get Sirius, get his friends, and--
“Malfoy changed, didn’t he?” Granger says, looking back at the ginger, who grumbles and looks away, clearly not pleased but not having anything else to say.
The dead silence that falls on the room is suffocating. Some of the Slytherins appear to agree with Millicent, nodding along, but as the majority stiffens and stares in clear disbelief, even the ones in agreement shrink back.
He was not an accident. His parents had loved him enough to leave him where he was safe…even while it terrified them to do so. His father had wanted a son, and loved that son in spite of everything. He was too young to remember anything of them. Just pictures and clippings from a vanished time, but he had this. This was his legacy. The truth. It hovered in the air near it, so vibrant and strong that it could be felt heart and soul.
What a piece of work Flint had been too! A real, honest to God, unredeemable asswipe of the highest order, and they’d had to coddle him with the promise of a private cell in the ’cripples ward’ with extra amenities for his cooperation. The worthless piece of crap had been smirking all the while, amused that he’d had something to hold over the cops questioning him, even while he was in traction and wrapped up until he was nearly mummified. Still, he was a living witness who swore that a dark haired, green-eyed man named Harry Black had been there after all, and he’d been beaten nearly to death by that same man weeks before the killings.
Harry’s jaw looked awfully tight, and he closed his eyes and faced Draco for the first time that morning, then opened his eyes while taking a deep breath, trapping Draco’s attention with twin flares of green.
Harry smirked, still not sure what all this was about, but when Draco was polite it was still a charming novelty. It went without saying that Draco was at his most polite when he wanted something...he wasn't Slytherin without cause, after all. But watching him make some kind of extra effort just for Harry's sake always made Harry feel a warm glow inside that he enjoyed thoroughly.
Intellectually speaking, I know that almost all pop music is hyper-produced garbage that preys on the emotional immaturity of its audiences, selling a culture of glamour and wealth and sex that isn‘t realistic or attainable or even healthy…but it’s still so goddamned fun to shake my ass to it that I just…don’t…care!
Hermione’s head was still planted directly above her textbook. A tiny half smile formed at the corner of her mouth. “So what exactly is he doing?”
“Draco. He loves you, too. At least he says he does. I suppose I believe it now. You ought to know…no matter what happens, Harry will remember everything as special just because it was with you. You don’t have to do all that.”
One day he discovered that nipples could be a source of enjoyment, and on another he learned just how sensitive the flesh along his hipbones could be. Masturbation had opened the door to the rest, and now frottage had become the rule of the day.
Draco groaned piteously. His voice was oddly hoarse when he whispered back. "Please...I...I wanna come. I can come again...I'm sure of it. Lemme..."
“I’ll stop at some point and let the effect wear off. Then you can tell me if you’re really okay or not. If you slip into trance, how would I know if you were alright or not? This way, you can still stop me if you’re not well…understand?”
I feel my body lifted effortlessly, swung around and pinned against the wall, knees almost bent tight against either side of my chest, his arms just under the pits of my knees and holding me steady while he pounds up into me so easily. He has the body of an Olympic athlete, and the endurance to match. He makes me feral, crazy with need and utterly out of control…and I love it.
He doesn’t understand it yet, but he’s getting the sloppiest, wettest head I know how to give. He probably thinks I’m still drunk, and maybe I am, but I can do this either way, and tipsy or not, I have a purpose. When his cock is dripping and soaked from base to tip in my spit, and he hovers on the brink of coming because even my sloppiest head is damn good, I make my move.
It wasn’t as if he didn’t know anything about sex. Just not half as much as he’d like to. To Harry, seventeen seemed awfully old to be fumbling around without so much as a decent date in weeks.
I’m out of the room as quickly as I can muster, trying to walk steadily. Just…dazed. It feels like I woke up and realized that I’m in a strange place. Intellectually, I knew that Harry had been shot twice before this, but it isn’t the same as seeing the evidence that someone fired a bullet at him…and hit…or almost hit. Not the same at all.
He doesn’t stop. He pulls away while I’m flaccid and stunned in the aftermath of orgasm, and finds a better use for tongue and fingers than even before. My knees draw up almost instinctively, and a much more familiar hunger is still alive inside of me. He kindles it, feeding it with soft manipulation until it rages again, insatiable and out of control. I sound piteous, I’m sure, and for a second I wonder if Maria and Therese can hear me, then I remember that I don’t care, because what Harry is doing between my legs is enough to merit crying out while blinded by tears of joy.
“You like? You know…you could just…peel them off of me…if you wanted…and maybe…show me what you think of them…and me…by-”
Hermione looked more than a little aghast at the notion of Potter strung out on heroin, but busied herself pouring more tea and tried to look vaguely disinterested. "So Harry's a junkie? You say 'Or so you thought?' I take it there was more to it than just a need for drugs?"
Finding Draco’s son sprawled across it, shirt hanging around his waist and back bared for some kind of savage and brutal beating, was a perversion of everything decent and happy in his memories. Harry, already far from his best mood after the day’s events, finally snapped, all sense of professionalism gone in a heartbeat.
I have boundless experience, the kind gained only by a life of what others would call riotous self indulgence. Harry has no experience at all, but a heart that swells and bursts with genuine desire. I want every satisfaction to be his, every pleasure I can command and marshal, all for his benefit, not just my own. His awkwardness and hesitance are not offensive or clichéd, and I teach with a patience I did not know I possessed until it was needed.
“Alright then. It’s settled. I don’t like it, but we’ll do this one like you want it. Just…next time you have an idea…try to give me a heads up first before you drop any new surprises on me…okay?”
So obedient. Everything is alright. Everything is okay. He keeps that shoulder out of the water, but slides deeper into the tub and relaxes properly while I prop the beer between his neck and the edge of the tub. Touching him is comforting. Familiar and right. Safe and just as real as the life he lives outside of here. I need that balance right now.
The power in his voice made the words a clear command, and the snake reared up and turned to Harry quizzically, awaiting explanation.
Law enforcement goes a big rubbery one when it comes to drugs. They love them. Not the way club kids do…at least not always, but they universally owe their budgets and careers to drugs. If it wasn’t for people trying to party or just forget, the cops would be forced to concentrate on either serious criminals or traffic infractions. Drugs provide a steady stream of busts that are often uncomplicated, and move thousands of people through a system that employs clerks and lawyers on a scale that no Wall Street firm ever could. Drugs are bread and butter, and if they vanished like people wished, the system would collapse overnight. Like blood-gorged ticks on the back of a dog, law enforcement survives on the flesh and blood of junkies and fools.
If Draco never made his peace with whatever demons haunted him, they would never be together again, but Harry had made his peace with himself, and he wouldn’t be burned by the same fire again, and pride in that would have to be enough to see him through.
He hasn’t been silent the entire time. We spoke en route to each destination, but there were snippets that were so much more meaningful than the rest of the chatter. I got my nerve together and actually asked what he was blushing about at breakfast. His staunch refusal to admit that he blushed was amusing…because he was blushing while he denied it! I pushed for answers and boy did I get one.
How sad. I was stone hard when he first walked in, and now here I am with my balls practically pulled into my body cavity from panic. Makes the smile I try to fake seem just that…fake.
I know he thought about his family…how they raised him, what they expected of him. But who…who the hell would ask someone they really loved to do what he asked of me? To stand aside and be a secret from a wife and the world?
“I know. It’s not like you haven’t made it clear before. Do you know how many women I’ve slept with? Two. Pansy and Daphne Greengrass. After that I stuck to gentlemen of discretion. How many of them? Four. Harry…I’ve never actually slept in the same bed with anyone since Pansy. My love life has been every bit as pathetic as the rest of my life. I needed half a bottle of wine just to admit that the only person I’ve felt anything respectable for in the last fifteen years…has been you. And you’re straight. I am a fool. Harry…I should go. The food was delicious…but I think I need to go home and sleep off the wine for tonight. Okay?”
Potential. I see it now. Some of it. His words by the little German deli were prophetic, and he is here to see them come true. In a way, that’s his real birthday gift. There are a lot of things about myself that I don’t like, or probably shouldn’t like but just can’t or won’t change, but I don’t think…I don’t think I feel the contempt for myself that I once did. The person Harry met in that prison hated every part of himself bitterly, despising the weakness that made his life into a living hell. That person is dead. I’m still figuring out who the hell I am now, but all I need to know is that Harry will still be here when I work it out.
There’s a wheezy, skinny one with hair like dirty ash. Skinny, but not much too look at. Someone will probably keep him around for amusement…at least for awhile.
Harry turned and found himself looking into the face of the young man he'd loved in life, and mourned in death, for twenty years.
Alarm flared in Draco’s mind. This was dangerously close to the truth of things, truths he was woefully unprepared to share, and had barely had time to glimpse himself.
All this was good, but it brought Draco back to the situation at hand. Harry would want something more…and soon. There were signs already showing.
Now here they were, years later. Her life had become a hermit's existence, with scholarship taking the place of the brief time she'd spent wrestling over too much drink. Harry had spent all that time lost to them...vanished out into the streets where he wouldn't be recognized, as far from the Wizard community as he could get and still be among humans in England. Even changed by self inflicted indulgence and near starvation...it was still Harry. She could push away that shock of cheaply dyed hair and see the faded scar above his brows.
Minerva walked into the waiting area, fixing Harry with a concerned look now that there wasn't a cluster of onlookers.
Harry finally snapped out of his trance when Draco wrung out the washcloth with a loud splash. Heart bursting in his chest, he slipped backwards quietly, one step at a time. It was only a couple of steps to the entryway and his cloak. He was almost there when the silence was broken.
"Harry. I saw him in the mirror. Not as a professor…not as a friend. As a lover who desired me. That is what I saw."
The snap of phone closing and he’s in the driver’s seat. Five minutes later I’m home. I love saying that. It’s still so new for me. This is my home. This is my life. This is not a bad state of affairs. I thank Ron before I go, and he just gives a terse grunt and a thumbs up sign.
Saugatuck turns out to be cute, in a slightly surreal way. It’s so small, and touristy, and yet it seems very cosmopolitan. The pride flags and rainbow decorations that pop up all over are surprising. One doesn’t see a lot of small towns with gay friendly banners all over the place, but apparently the gay population here is so entrenched, and has been here so long, that people have become very comfortable with it. Kind of like Boystown, or the Village in NYC, where people have long since learned that gay men walk hand in hand or kiss in public, so it stops being a surprise to anyone.
“I was saving you from yourself! You weren’t even supposed to be at that event! You know you only came because I took Luna! You insulted her for half the night, out loud, drank enough booze to fill a bathtub, slapped one of the only other women that spoke to me for who only knows what reason, put a Stinging Hex on another…AND you vomited on the palm tree in the lobby! You were pathetic! You needed to be put down before you got arrested, you obnoxious, no-talent ass-clown!”
Author’s Note: This chapter is dedicated to Heidi. Her reviews didn’t land on any big magic numbers, but they were always sweet, supportive and welcomed with a smile. Thank you, Heidi!
“I can handle just about anything once I’ve put my mind to it. I take it that there is a means for me to acquire materials for these classes?”
“How come you dislike me so much? Don’t pretend I don’t know. It was a good game and all, but you can barely stand being in the room with me most of the time. I’d just like to know.”
The words stung, but Harry didn‘t say them in a way that implied a desire to hurt. It was just very matter of fact. “I thought as much. That‘s your business. I haven‘t any say in the matter.”
Draco had proven to be quiet and studious in the extreme since his assignments had been decided upon. Each day he sat near the front left corner of the class, writing furiously while reading from a textbook, and sometimes more than one was open on his desk. Harry had to admire the silent determination that had been shown by his erstwhile pupil. There was no question about the boy’s talent, and Harry hoped that the meeting with Hermione had gone well.
Traditionally, when that phrase has been used while directed at me, it’s meant that my thong is around someone’s neck, my ankles were over their shoulders, and that person’s cock was about to make me their sole purpose for a little while.
John Prewett’s voice was all concern and comfort, and Harry nodded quietly, taking the flask of Dreamless Sleep. He drank every last drop, grateful for the temporary freedom it would give him.
Harry and I have already had our ‘moment’. The rest is silence. I know what to do. He knows what to do. The time for chit chat and love words is past. This is the time for action, and I’m out the door and letting heels clack on the sidewalk as I head for Blaise’s doorstep.
“Luna!? I know you don’t believe the crap the papers print! Why on earth would you say that? I’m straight! You of all people ought to know that! Draco and I are just…were just friends. Nothing happened. Nothing.”
Harry looks at the window for a minute, then sighs and looks me in the eyes. “Kind of. Almost. I don’t think this is any more my home than anywhere else, but it’s the only place left with some memories attached to it. And people that I know and can safely interact with. This place is one of the most secure in all of England. At least as far as being overheard goes. Interference has been set up all over, and I have a freedom here that I don’t normally have. Still, you know the drill. Never mention business unless I mention it first. If I talk…that means it’s safe and I’m sure of it. Got it?”
This was not the lazy Saturday morning Harry had envisioned before leaving the office. His arm had lost all feeling, his head felt like a grenade had gone off in his skull, and his stomach was more than a little upset as well. He remembered being at a pub with Malfoy…but hadn’t any idea why the bastard was here…or why they were both on the floor in their clothes. And being cuddled by a barely conscious Draco Malfoy was NOT comforting in the slightest.
“Good that you’re speaking of it, Harry, but I should tell you that I haven’t changed my opinion much. I agree that you have a right to feel as you do. Perhaps you did some things that were clearly wrong, but before you rush to judgment on yourself, remember that you’ve done some truly remarkable things as well. I can see that we’ll have some things to talk about, but if you’re willing to push yourself to speak of these things, I’m sure you’ll make admirable progress. Harry, you are a good man by anyone’s definition, and there isn’t one person in this castle who has ever had a harsh word from you. You’re well and rightly loved by a lot of people, and not without good reason. I think you’re carrying a lot more old pain than is healthy for anyone, and I think that, when you let it go, you’ll look at life quite a bit differently. The war was ended more than fifteen years ago, Harry, and a lot of questionable things were done in its name. There‘s no reason for you to carry the weight of that time alone.”
“He’s telling you the truth. I got in just before six, and he was already asleep on my couch. Draco couldn’t have been anywhere near Pansy last night. Now let’s hear where his child is!”
Minerva sighed with relief and placed her cup on the desk with an air of satisfaction. “There will be a statement for you to sign, Harry, but I think that will be all I’ll require. I find it much easier to believe in a love struck youngster doing something terribly foolish than a calculating seducer wreaking havoc at the age of twelve. Nonsense…the things that come out of that school! I’ve more than a few things to see to this morning…is there anything else that either of you would care to discus before we start the day?”
What had become of the bright eyed boy in those old pictures from school? He’d had so much against him in those times. So many people around him had been hurt in the war and the conflicts leading up to it. So many killed. Cedric. Sirius. Albus. He’d pushed through so much loss, and so many trials, just to see things through to their end. The boy in those pictures had been braver by far than the man who sat looking at them now.
“You’re going to kill me.” Draco breathes out eventually, leaning their foreheads against one another. “I always knew you would, somehow, but I never imagined it would be like this.”
His head is spinning, his heart is tearing its way from his chest and all oxygen disappears from his lungs at her words.
Draco’s looks past Harry’s shoulder, wondering how he can put it so that Harry will understand. “I just… it never felt right, telling them. I wasn’t sure at first, and I tried to convince myself it wasn’t true when I finally was definite. I ignored it for a while. And after that, well. I know they would all understand better than anybody why being gay is tantamount to marrying a Muggle for a Pureblood. I didn’t want their pity or- or for them to think less of me. And then in Sixth and Seventh Year we had more important things to worry about.”
He trails off at the blank looks he gets and can’t help grinning now. “Alright then, that’s perfect. The rest of you are alright with being Chasers?”
Harry glares but Draco refuses to say another word unless it’s commenting with the kids on the movie so he tries to pay attention and do the same.
“Right then.” Blaise spins the bottle and as it slows down Harry feels a sudden spike of panic because it looked like it was about to stop on him. Luckily it stops just before, landing on Ginny and making Harry breathe out a sigh of relief.
“I was practically in love,” Harry confirms, ignoring his teasing. For a moment Draco wonders where Chang is this year- she’s one of many from their age group who chose not to return for Eighth Year. “Or as much as a person can be with a first serious crush anyway.”
“Don’t leave again. Please.” He’s looking down at the floor but he still sees Draco’s head whip up in his peripheral vision. When it becomes clear he isn’t going to answer Harry nods, not sure what else to do. “I’m sorry.”
She nods as if expecting the reply which- there is no way that’s possible, is it? Harry looks at Draco again who has nervously swiped up a chocolate biscuit and is nibbling on it. Had Draco mentioned anything about Narcissa being good at
Draco sees Potter glance towards Granger, who is frowning, before she nods at him almost imperceptibly.
"No," he interrupts him because Draco really doesn't feel like fighting at the moment. He'd gotten a letter from his mother last night, letting him know how Father was doing, and it hasn't put him in the greatest of moods this morning. Hearing that Potter and Ginevra have split has brightened his morning considerably; more than it should have if he’s being honest. Which he isn't. "I'm just... wondering."
Not only does Draco feel like he knows Harry, he feels like Harry knows him. Harry knows when Draco got a letter from Mother about Father because it usually makes him quiet and withdrawn, or angry and itching for a fight. Harry knows how to draw him out of those moods, either by letting Draco rant about something and say things he wouldn’t to anybody else and not judging him for it, or by making him laugh and distracting him. Harry knows that Draco’s always been jealous of Hermione for getting better grades than him (and being the only one in their year to do so in most of their classes) and that’s what made him lash out so much at her when they were younger because it would disappoint his parents that he wasn’t the best, especially compared to a Muggle-born witch.
The hand between them begins to move faster and Harry keeps pushing his hips forward with Draco, keeps bringing them against one another again and again, the pleasure building deep.
“Yay!” Teddy continues to bounce excitedly even when Harry puts him back down. His hair is green now. “Uncle Draco’s coming too. And Aunt Cissy can’t come but she said happy birthday and that she bought me a really good present.” He turns expectant eyes to Harry. “Did you get me something?”
Which was when he’d realized that most people had no idea what Harry Potter’s owl looked like. That apparently
“It’s true. I didn’t do any of it by myself. I had help from teachers and friends the entire time.” His mouth quirks up. “If I hadn’t I’d probably still be wandering the Forest of Dean now.”
Hagrid has really gone all out this year, he notes absently as the Headmistress speaks about how proud she is of the change she saw among the students. There are Christmas trees lining the walls and the ceiling gives the impression of softly falling snow that disappears about ten feet above the students’ heads. There is the smell of a fireplace fire even though there are none in sight, and garland is strung along the edge of the Head Table. The tables hold centerpieces of pine twigs, holly berries and frosted pinecones, and even the dishes where the food will appear show different Winter Wonderland themed pictures.
“We can do exes,” Pansy says, eyes settling on Harry and making a bolt of nervousness go through him. “Like Ginny and Harry here. Everyone who thinks they did the nasty before their conscious uncoupling, take a drink!”
Ron frowns and Hermione speaks. “I can help if you want, Harry. I think it’s a great idea that you’re putting in extra time. It will really help towards the end of the year.”
It doesn’t matter that everyone is staring at them, or that cameras are going off and this will likely be all over the papers tomorrow. This has not been the solo venture Draco had dreaded. No, his friends had waited for him, they had come and found him.
“What?” Harry looks up at him, horror on his face as he abandons trying to make up the bed again. “No, I- I was just planning on getting him a present-”
“What’s that look for?” Ron asks suspiciously. “Harry, Blaise, why does he have that look on his face?”
“Ah Potter, you should know better than anyone by now that Draco doesn’t do anything rashly. Believe me, if he says he’s ready, then he is. He’s not ignorant of the risks, you know he’s not. But you have to trust that he knows what he wants and is prepared for whatever comes.” Blaise searches his face. “You have to trust each other.”
What then? Wizard cops, as Hermione had dubbed the Aurors over Christmas Break when she and Harry had been tipsy at the Weasley’s? Or is there something else out there waiting for him.
“Don’t be daft.” He says softly, surprised at how touched he is by the fact Harry actually took his hand. “You think some bad press can scare away a Malfoy? You still have too much to learn from me for me to give up on you now.”
It’s a whisper, barely breathed against Harry’s skin but he hears it clearly all the same and ignores the pang that isn’t lust he feels at the words.
Then Percy and his girlfriend Audrey arrive with George and Angelina and that is all of the immediate family. They gravitate towards the arch where there is more space to stand, everyone moving from person to person until the first of the real guests arrived.
“Hmm,” Blaise wanders over to stand in front of Draco and survey him as well. “Maybe Harry will have some.”
Harry listens to Luna's response, genuinely interested. He never would have thought a friendship could have formed in the awful, cold place that is Malfoy's home. And he can't picture Malfoy being kind to the prisoners, no matter how hard he tries.
He stops at pictures of a young Snape and his mother. These are Muggle photos, and Harry then notices one of the two of them standing in front of the Hogwarts train together in what must have been their first year.
Ginny’s long red hair has been curled and pinned up in a low knot at the back left of her head, with a braid running from the front to wind throughout the design. A few flowers are tucked in as well. She has small ruby droplet earrings and a matching necklace, and her dress is a V-necked white lace design that flares out past her hips.
“Thought I’d spare you all the torture. Dressing up is a big enough pain as it is.” Ron says, and Harry smiles wider as Malfoy blinks again, this time surprised at Ron’s light tone.
“Gladly,” Blaise says smoothly, swooping in to firmly press his lips to Ginny’s, staying there long enough that Ginny’s eyes blink open in surprised confusion right before he pulls away.
“Sweetheart your Father and I don’t mind you being gay. It’s perfectly acceptable these days. Aunt Bella might have kicked up a fuss but she’s hardly a problem now.”
Draco preens. “No but please do, it’s been so long since I’ve had a compliment. I can barely remember the feeling.”
“Thank you.” He looks up at his best friends again. Both are watching him, waiting for an answer, but Harry thinks he needs to finish thinking everything over by himself now. “For everything.”
“Hey.” Harry nudges him, looking concerned, and Draco snaps his eyes away from the statue to look at him. The other wizard offers a slight and crooked smile. “You okay? I thought I was the one who was supposed to get emotional here.”
“Now that’s what I’m talking about!” Pansy breaks the silence and both Harry and Draco look over at her. She grins widely, looking infinitely pleased and Harry is thankful as the tension breaks. “Looks like these two came to play. Good on you, Potter, I’d always thought you were a bit of a square. Way to show him how it’s done, Draco.”
She looks around the room a bit, stopping at the sight of Ron, Harry and Hermione before smiling. "My friends got me out eventually. But before that Bellatrix Lestrange would love to hurt me while Mr. Malfoy watched. The elder Mr. Malfoy I mean."
Draco snaps out of his thoughts to walk to the fire, accepting the powder offered by Donna with a little nod.
“Merlin,” Harry had muttered, turning and finally heading up to the Gryffindor Common Room. Why was it that almost anytime he was around Malfoy they parted ways with Harry’s brain hurting and leaving him confused?
She's still looking at him with concern when she opens her mouth to reply, but Blaise's voice from behind Harry makes her close it again. "What would I not be happy with? Keeping secrets from your husband already, darling?"
It's a very nice office, if Draco does say so himself. The walls are a lovely shade of green, just light enough for the room not to feel dark and enclosed, but not blindingly so. His desk is directly opposite the door, with his very comfortable chair behind it, and two not so comfortable chairs in front for any guests. (He won’t admit he’s stolen the idea of making his guests uncomfortable from Headmaster McGonagall). On top of it are papers upon papers of experiments he's conducting with potions, and correspondence letters between him and his employer, Thelonious Karlton, the Potions Master he works for. Against the wall to the right is a liquor cabinet of oak, polished with a dark sheen to perfection. The glass display shows the crystal chalices of drink within, and underneath that is a place for drinking glasses resting on a silver tray, with the most recently used drink beside them- top closed, of course, because he’s not a barbarian.
He’s waved off by the others, which isn’t surprising really since they’re all far drunker than him with the exception of Potter and Neville. And Harry watches him leave the group, Draco’s blazer the only thing remaining in his seat. Draco can feel it, the weight of Harry’s gaze. When he reaches the wave of bodies it’s easy to slip through the crowd until he’s hidden somewhere in the middle, and then it’s a point of trying to forget everything except the music and letting everything go as he dances by himself, eyes closed, feeling the vibrations run through him.
Draco nods and moves closer to him. “Thank you. And you know- Harry, you know the reason I don’t want anyone else to know- it’s not because I’m ashamed to be with you.”
Minutes tick by, the only sign of it the sound of the sand hitting the bottom of an hourglass and Draco feels suffocated.
“Oh Molly, don’t interrogate him as soon as he steps through the fireplace.” Arthur comes bustling in, shucking off a hat, scarf and jacket and comes to give Harry a hug. He returns it absently, still stuck on Mrs. Weasley’s question. “How are you Harry? Happy Christmas.”
Draco breathes deeply, taking his head away from Ginny's shoulder. "Thank you." He says, too tired to even start feeling embarrassed.
“You think I thought it was possible I could be friends with Malfoy before this year started?” Harry asks her. They both know that nobody had thought that possible between them, never mind what he and Draco have become now. “The two of us nearly killed each other in the past. At least you and Blaise don’t have that hanging over you.”
“Do I?” Draco murmurs, pleased that he hadn’t seemed as nervous as he had been. “It’s all an act, I can promise you.”
“No, of course not. I’m just saying it sort of takes the wind out of my words. Or whatever the saying is,” Draco waves it away. “There’s no obstacle for me to overcome and prove myself to you now, is there?”
“Ah.” Draco rolls his shoulders a bit and shifts his weight. “He was just helping me with something.”
It’s a problem because Harry hadn’t realized he was actually attracted to blokes like that until now. That is new. Sure, he’s looked, but he’d thought everyone did that.
“But,” Mother worries her lower lip and Draco resists the old urge to ask her to stop. He hasn’t seen that nervous fidget in a while and had hoped that the habit had been broken. “Well, it’s just that it’s the Ministry, sweetheart. I know they’re meant to be Britain’s best but are you sure it’s entirely safe for you? Things have certainly changed since your Hogwarts days but memories are long.”
“Oh come off it!” Harry calls and he’s too loud and his cheeks are flushed and his eyes bright and Draco can’t look away, can’t stop his lips from twitching even as they argue. “You went on and on about how you were so in pain from three little scratches-”
“And you look wonderful.” Grey eyes look up to inspect his hair and the corners of Draco’s mouth twitch. “Whatever you did to your hair to make it look like that… I like it.”
Harry glances over at her, taking her in. Narcissa seems more at ease now as well, and there’s a look on her face as she watches Draco, Teddy and her sister that speaks of warmth, of fondness. As they look on, Andromeda excuses herself to use the toilet, leaving Draco alone with Teddy.
“Harry.” Draco’s eyes fall closed briefly as he finds the words. “It’s not. You take care of us all the time. Let us repay you for that.”
None of these photos had been on display at 4 Privet Drive, of course, Harry thinks bitterly as he takes in the photos hungrily. But to know they had been somewhere in the house Harry had grown up in all this time, hidden and kept from him…
“Harry.” Is all Draco says, again and again, and Harry smiles, pressing one last kiss to his back before falling to his knees, grabbing Draco’s arse cheeks and spreading them so he can lick a careful, hot and wet strip up his hole.
“Which you are not allowed to tease me about or bring up again after this conversation,” Draco growls a beat too late.
“Professor,” Draco speaks before Harry can, as the three of them stand. “Thank you for the offer. Really.”
But she only smiles and nods, stepping back and letting him feel like he could breathe again. “Of course, how silly of me.”
Then finally, with one last glance at Draco who is still sound asleep, he slips quietly out of the room on his search for water. And hopefully a bathroom.
Draco and the others are in the library studying together. Harry is casually running his foot up along the length of Draco’s leg and making Draco feel extremely on edge. It’s been a while since the two of them have had time alone to fill Draco’s more physical urges from being around Potter, and that normally wouldn’t be a big deal if Harry wasn’t actively trying to drive Draco to distraction right now in the library while they are surrounded by their closest friends.
“And give him one of the Hangover Potions I gave you. If he needs it.” Another pause. “I’ll bring you a fresh batch soon.”
“Thank you, Draco,” she looks extremely pleased while Luna takes a seat on the side of Draco opposite to Harry.
“Yes we do.” She had smiled that sad smile again. “Or at least I do. I know what Blaise is like when he’s in love with me. Believe me, he’s not anymore.”
Even if there wasn’t the rest of this to deal with, he and Harry have very different career paths and opportunities ahead of them. Harry has a job with the Aurors sitting waiting for him in the Ministry. Draco has almost no opportunities here in the U.K. and thus has had to get more creative.
Now that Harry thinks about it, this week is quite busy. There seems to be exams in every subject these coming days, and then students leave after classes to go home for Christmas. How much time will Draco and Harry really have to spend together?
“Argh!” His friend makes a disgusted sound and sits back, looking away. “Forget it. I’ll figure it out myself.”
Then before Harry knows it he’s walking through the falling snow back to Hogwarts with something akin to anticipation making his stomach flutter.
“Shut up.” Draco groans, face in his hands. “The last thing we need is Mother seeing us having sex.”
“You haven’t spoken about it at all!” Pansy cried. “Not to me, not to anybody! We’re all worried about the two of you, you’ve been acting bloody mental since school ended!”
Harry rolls his eyes. "Hardly," he snaps. "Though it was hard to miss his tongue down your throat. For a closeted prick you really seem to be trying to show off. Into exhibitionism now are you?"
“Because I don’t want to!” Draco’s voice rises again. “Things are fine, alright, aren’t we happy now the way we are? Isn’t the sneaking around fun?”
Blaise sits back, arms crossed. "How can I help, Draco? I'm trying, but you're not making it very easy."
Draco raises an eyebrow and only barely manages to hold back an insult, instead focusing on Potter's point. "When?" He asks, surprising both of them, if Potter's face is anything to go by.
"Draco Lucius Malfoy you stand here accused of aiding and abetting He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, accepting the brand of a Death Eater and killing Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore." Shocked gasps are drawn in around them and Ron looks at Harry sitting beside him.
“They all fought in the battle. Before that too. Fought for you, most of them. Under your leadership. I’d say it counts.”
Soon everyone’s being called to their seats and they’ve eaten the dinner, drinks and laughter flowing. He’s smiling like mad and looking around the table he feels so loved that he just sits or a second, doing his best to memorize everything down to the last detail.
“I also happen to have a lot of customers at my shop who are siblings or parents from students at Hogwarts.” George retorts. “Not to mention students themselves. Shameless gossips, I tell you.”
Ginny hands him his cup of tea. "Drink that," she says gently. "Blaise can go and find some blankets and pajamas for you."
“Good luck, all of you. Let me know how it goes.” He glances back at Harry, briefly, and can only bear to look at him for a moment. “I’ll see you soon.”
He blinks and fumbles for his glasses. He can’t recall whether he remembered to take them off and put them on the bedside table before bed or if they must have slipped off in his sleep. One hand blearily rubs his closed eyes to get the sleep from them while the other fumbles around on the table, and he lets out a breathy and tired groan of success at locating them before slipping them over his eyes.
She’s looking at him with so much sorrow and pity he feels a lump begin to form in his throat and has to breathe in quickly. “I never received a letter from you that said anything about a romantic relationship between you and Harry. And I most definitely would not have written this back to you if I had.”
Draco sighs at the reminder. “I know. And thank you. But no, I have an idea and would like it if even you were surprised at my original thought for a gift.”
"Mr. Potter." The woman beside Kingsley, someone who's name Harry has never managed to learn, now speaks. "Please tell us your full name and try to lie."
"You saved a Death Eater who you are rumored to have hated since your first year at Hogwarts. Why?" She leans forward.
Harry had gone to do the same with Hermione. When he’d walked into the Common Room he’d found her and Ron sitting in front of the fire, distanced a bit from everybody else and deep in discussion. They’d stopped abruptly when they’d seen him coming and Harry had felt a pang because that was something that felt sadly familiar.
“That I’ve acted a total plonk around you since we met,” Harry rolls his eyes and directs this towards Draco. “Sixth Year probably should have clued me in.”
“It is not!” His best friend splutters. Her hair is up in a ponytail and she is already wearing a brand new sweater from Molly. “Can’t I just be happy Harry’s here?”
Draco raises an eyebrow, ignoring the fluttering nerves of excitement he’s feeling. “You’re heading the wrong way, Potter. Apparently we’re sitting all the way in the back of the train.”
The brunette nods against the cushion. “Since they were kids. She was his only friend before Hogwarts. And they were still friends until he got really involved in the Death Eaters later on in school.” Harry looks away. “He was jealous that she liked my dad.”
(Cedric wasn’t supposed to die. He wasn’t supposed to even be there, to reach the end of that maze. Draco discovered this later, after a screaming match in the Manor that left him in his room and his father pacing in his study while Mother knocked on his door. When she came up to Draco he ignored her for hours until the next morning. That was also the summer he was told by his parents that Father was more of a pureblood fanatic than Draco had thought, that they were both followers of Voldemort, who had in fact returned. That was when they had told Draco that their new mission was to figure out how to kill Harry Potter.)
Harry pales. “Oh bugger, I did say something didn’t I? Just ignore it, alright? Seriously, I’m a blabbering idiot when I’m plastered-”
Ginny presses her lips together, eyes sparkling, and Blaise opens his mouth to speak again, glancing over at Harry but he’s interrupted.
Harry glances at Draco, who looks back unhelpfully while his lips are twitching. He can’t help him here.
“Yeah.” Draco notices Snape’s lips thin and absently wonders at that. Had his rivalry with Lupin in Draco’s Third Year really been that bad? “Mum’s just begun talking to Andromeda again recently. Trying to… make up for everything.”
He bites his tongue sharply, blinking from the pain but also feeling a bit more grounded from it. “It’s just… you haven’t really asked me a question.”
With a thought he’s off, zooming through the air, eyes focused on that one spot. He hears Draco yell, feels air disturbed just behind him as the blonde catches up to trail him, but Harry smiles victoriously as his hand reaches out, open and ready-
"Yeah, but we don't fight over- over important things." She says. "It's like- when you were gone for that year, I missed you. All the time."
“I have. We’ve had nearly six months.” Harry says quietly. “And I never said we should tell people right away, I was only asking if you’d do it.”
“Happy Holidays,” Harry toasts along with everybody and then takes a sip of his drink. It is in fact cider and it warms his stomach deliciously.
“I know it’s very late in the year to be asking,” she begins and takes off her spectacles to begin polishing them with a cloth that seems to have appeared from nowhere. “I also know you both undoubtedly have many different roads open to you when it comes to your futures.”
Then she turns away to glide over to the window Draco had always sat with her at. He follows immediately,
She's looking at him with obvious curiosity burning beneath a feeling of worry. "I heard, you know. Most of the others saw you. You turned right around and practically ran in the opposite direction when you caught sight of him."
Draco seems to accept that and takes in the decorated Great Hall. Tinsel lines the walls and tables, holly hangs from the air above them, Christmas trees are placed sporadically around the castle by Hagrid and more. At the moment they’re the only students at lunch, having come in late from a few quick games of Quidditch.
Harry ignores the stumble and the pushing memories of Eighth Year, instead letting his mouth twitch up at the corners at the idea. “That would have been something.”
Now Draco can’t ignore Potter sitting three chairs away. Even though Blaise is right beside him, drunker than Draco’s ever seen him before, and Ron is close to catching up where he sits beside Theo and Potter. They are proving to be enough of a distraction to the others while Draco sits trying to pretend he hasn’t spent the last three hours watching Harry across the table.
As she finishes speaking she moves away further and her black eyes go to Draco. “Which reminds me, of course, that we’re being unspeakably rude.” As Harry watches Andromeda he sees the way her expression hardens slightly, a wariness entering her eyes, and her shoulders pull back. For the first time he sees the family resemblance between her and Narcissa. “Draco, it’s lovely to see you.”
Draco’s staring at the fabric in his hands. “This is the cloak you had on the train at the beginning of Sixth Year. When I broke your nose.” Draco frowns. “When did you get this?”
A few seconds go by until finally Padma raises her cup to drink, causing several looks of surprise and making Hermione gasp.
But her voice is still light when she asks, “who would that be again? I’m not as familiar with who holds which position since your father’s retirement.”
Of course it’s when he excuses himself to the bathroom to sit in a stall, head in his hands and breathing deeply to stop his rampaging thoughts that Harry actually does turn up. Even better that they meet at the bar, taking Draco completely off guard and making him act like a complete fool. Harry had probably taken one look at his frozen state and realized he’d had a lucky escape back in Eighth Year.
Harry gets a sinking feeling but just pastes on a neutral expression and nods, shrugging back at Ron when his friend shoots him an inquisitive look.
Hermione beams some more and doesn’t seem to notice Draco’s unwillingness to elaborate. Or she does and just isn’t as curious as Harry. Which, Harry reasons, is probably more accurate. There’s no reason for him to be as thrown by the revelation that Draco and Hagrid are speaking as he is.
“I never really got to know him.” Narcissa says after a long pause. “Regulus yes, everyone knew Regulus. He was one of the best Death Eaters the Dark Lord had in the beginning. But Sirius left my aunt and uncle’s home when he was quite young. From then on it was as if he never existed in our family.” Her lips twist. “Though of course we all knew that he was innocent of betraying your parents as the Ministry thought.”
Harry jumps as Millie appears beside him, drawing his attention away from Ron and Blaise who have just begun a quiet conversation.
, the prat, and Harry feels that deep curl of something hot tighten in his belly, feels the excitement of a challenge rise in him.
He looks away as if the sight hurts, just to avoid the Gryffindor noticing. Today’s already awkward enough without them sending one another looks throughout the ceremony.
10 hopeful and excited faces greet them. Harry smiles at Lydia who blushes and ignores the Gryffindor Second Year who nudges her and whispers something urgently in her ear.
“How should I know? You’re more his friend than I am, remember?” Draco says snidely and Pansy throws him an unimpressed glare.
“Trust Draco’s judgement,” Dumbledore suggests gently. His eyes are skipping around, landing on the three of them one at a time, getting each of their attention. “It’s not often he’s wrong.”
“Hello, Harry.” Luna catches Harry coming back from Hagrid’s hut two days before Halloween. “How are you?”
He’s been checking the Owlery constantly since sending the letters. Nothing has come in the morning post so he’s been making the trek up there himself to see if any replies have arrived. So far every time he’s been disappointed. In fact, he debates even going after dinner that night, half-thinking he should just wait until breakfast the next morning, but in the end he can’t help himself.
“Because everything he’s done hurt my family! I don’t know how you’ve forgotten that, but people I love got hurt because of him. Bill got attacked in this very castle because Malfoy allowed Greyback in here. Fred died.”
Draco doesn’t know much about Romilda Vane. She’s a Sixth Year now, he thinks. From what he’s heard she was one of the students who played a big role with Dumbledore’s Army last year.
Right, well except for when his family played host to Voldemort. Or during the battles, or when he knew there were people down in his basement starving and in pain-
He pulls her in tighter. “I do need you though. Both of you.” He hesitates, but only for a moment. “I love you, Mum.”
“Is it ridiculous that hearing that makes me feel like I helped you in some way? Inadvertently, obviously, but… I mean at least it worked out.”
and then he'd told him the Malfoys will most likely bring him out as their first defense after learning he’s put his name down on their behalf. Partly for shock effect and partly because if Harry speaks in their defense first, any arguments made after will seem weaker.
Time passes quickly and before Harry knows it January is almost over. The lot of them have been busy with schoolwork, and Harry is beginning to take the pressure from his classes seriously now. Everything was light-hearted before the winter holidays, but this term is when things matter in earnest. And Harry needs decent grades if he has any hopes of becoming an Auror.
When he comes out he sees Blaise snoring away, practically hidden beneath layers of duvets and blankets, and Theo, who had opened his eyes when he’d heard Draco get up, is turned decidedly towards the wall, breathing deep and even.
“Exactly, and there is no good explanation for that.” Draco’s eyes are narrow and he crosses his arm defensively. Harry feels the few meters between them keenly. “Did you tell him about us?”
“If you could make sure any responses get to me as quickly as possible that would be very appreciated.” Draco says to him stiffly. He’s uncomfortable and wants to leave as soon as possible. “It’s urgent.”
Harry can’t stop looking at Draco who, if the number of times they make eye contact is an indication, is apparently having the same problem.
Most of all it’s the look on Ginny’s face that makes any tension Draco is feeling disappear. She looks so happy that he can’t remember for a minute why he was anxious and tense.
“That’s from Kingsley.” Harry nods to the piece of parchment. “He says it’s alright if you come to Godric’s Hollow with me as long as you let McGonagall put a
“Oh I don’t know,” Draco’s smile is tiny, pained and knowing. “You’re pretty self-sacrificing sometimes. I’d hate to be on the receiving end of that.”
?” Harry says angrily, his voice climbing. Draco hasn’t seen him this upset in… a while. “Seriously Draco, at this point would it really be that bad? Why should either of us give a damn what the world thinks? I never have before.”
“-and I am a professional, I assure you. There are only so many things that could be in them without you all having been thrown in jail, and while I do apologize for the intrusion of privacy, I can promise that I am not any happier about it than you both are. Now step aside.”
But the finding of the mirror…that had been his downfall. He'd only used his freetime gainfully the past weeks, surpassing all expectations, until he'd stumbled onto that storage chamber and pulled away the cloth that covered the mirror's face. In truth…he'd seen other things at first, equally desirable. His parents…alive and beaming with love…overjoyed to see him. And then he'd seen Harry…not broken with grief or enraged past the point of reason…but serious, sober, kind and warm…looking at him with the kind of smoldering hunger that he'd only read of in one book. A book he didn't dare share with anyone for fear that it would be plucked from his grasp and leave him alone.
She sounded very wise and sophisticated, a perfect model of the front put up by every adolescent since the dawn of time, trying to sound as adult as possible and yet falling terribly short of the mark in reality. Although it was horrifyingly annoying to children of that age, most adults found this behavior ‘cute’ in a tongue-in-cheek kind of way. Draco, on the other hand, was recovering from the sudden onset of heart palpitations at the very notion of discussing such a thing with his daughter.
Peter Pettigrew cringed as the paperweight Mr. Riddle had flung crashed into his arm. The old man was almost apoplectic with fury, wisps of white hair fluttering on a nearly bald head, eyes bulged with rage and mouth pinched into a tight line when not opening for shouted insults.
’Okay. Better. I can handle this. Wow. I’m telling my thirteen year old son about my boyfriend’s manor. Does it get more surreal than this?’
A dark cloaked figure entered the hall. Silence fell as they waited for the black wrapped figure to make a move.
The bushy haired young woman nods and takes a tone almost like a teacher imparting a history lesson. Annoying, because she sounds like a terrible know-it-all, but I suppose if she is collecting a paycheck similar to Harry’s, then she almost certainly earns it, and not by being stupid.
Draco was on his knees, looking down at Harry in the hazy, enchanted light, with an expression that perfectly mingled desperate hunger and awestruck love. At the moment, flustered and gasping for breath before Draco, Harry felt truly beautiful for the first time.
Draco hadn’t the faintest idea what to say to that. There was a painful and pregnant silence while he stared at the bar and took a sip from the new martini Potter had just bought him. His voice was hushed and faintly distracted when he spoke up.
The door to the library opens, and a very tall, fairly slender black man steps in, dressed in a quiet and tasteful suit, smiling easily when he sees Harry and Ron. Ron pipes up instantly.
But that's when I started to really love him...when I stopped finding reasons to hate him for the sake justifying my anger. He can be a total prick when he's in a foul mood. Sarcastic, arrogant, snide, and oh-so-fucking-superior. It's infuriating! But...he gets over it. Then he's kind, affectionate, passionate...everything you'd never expect. I like it. I like feeling wanted because it makes me feel like I'm worth wanting...and I have trouble feeling that way on my own. He could probably get away with being a total bastard...and I'd still cling to him...because I need the way he makes me feel so badly...but he doesn't exploit it even though I'm sure he knows he could. He's a lot more perceptive than he lets on...so I'm sure he knows more about how I feel than I can guess.
“Soooo...I feel very good about where this has been going, because I don't think either of us expected that something like this would be plausible, much less as comfortable as its been. You...well...you're actually really decent...as Gryffindors go...and I kind of didn't expect that. You've also been the only one who has been really supportive of me when I came here, AND you managed to get Ron and Hermione to give me a chance, in spite of all the bad blood between the lot of us. All things considered, I'd have to be a fool not to look on all that and not be surprised and pleased. And then there's the snogging...which for my money has been brilliant.”
Ron drops us off and departs, while I limp my way to the elevator with Harry. He finally speaks when we get inside.
He hadn't even the desire for sex anymore. He'd always been a riotously lusty fellow...eager to find new sport. The thought of searching for someone...sickened him now. Everything he had ever done...it turned his stomach to sour acid. Everything he'd been...was a thorough shame in the eyes of hindsight. All of it, all that time, all that passion...wasted. None of it mattered now. He'd gathered together the implements and toys and gear that had been a part of his former sex life...and burned the box of them into a cluster of cinders right on the carpet. The black and charred patch was still there, unattended after weeks.
It hadn’t seemed like much when it had started. Exciting, a little dangerous, and definitely hot, sexy and fun, but somewhere along the way, things had slid entirely out of control.
Harry looked down at the History of Magic text in front of him. Study period was almost over, and he was due back at the dorms. He hadn’t finished his essay, and he didn’t even have a lusty interlude to remember in its stead. This just sucked!
“Drake, we, and a few others, are only one operating branch of The Pheonix Corporation. There have been and are other groups like this one, both here in the states and around the globe. Our employer is only ever spoken of as Mr. White, unless you should have occasion to meet him personally. He is very old, very wealthy, and very powerful. He’s poured his entire life into trying to erase a mistake he made a long time ago, and we’re part of how he makes that goal plausible. Hermione? If you’ll explain the rest?”
I have what I need to get along while Harry is out. I have a piano to practice so I can play something nice for him sometime soon. Maria and Therese are always good for gossip and girl chat, and there’s a library full of books that beg to be read at my leisure. I knew a day out would put things back in perspective. The elevator door opens and I’m home. This is my home. Harry’s place. My little slice of heaven, even when he’s away and I miss him. I think I can get used to this.
Draco took his seat and made himself comfortable, steepling his hands and resting his chin on the fingertips. “Be my guest.”
Harry stood up from the table and went to drop the plate and cutlery off in the sink for later. He was two steps away when he looked back. For later. His entire life had become ‘for later’. If it hadn’t been for a timely intervention, he’d probably be waking up bleeding, scalded, hungry and miserable on a filthy kitchen floor. The sobering knowledge that, had anyone found him like that, they would have been horrified that a man who once saved the world appeared to care so little about his own life.
Throw in the fact that the cute Greek girl at his favorite morning restaurant stop had slipped him her phone number, and the fact that he already had a lead on a new client, and it had been one hell of a good week!
Seventh year Slytherins and Gryffindors would be gathering for their DADA class in less than an hour, and he still hadn’t found the curriculum overview for that year’s students. In a worst case scenario, he could wing it and walk them through some standard dueling, but it would be a source of personal embarrassment to hare off in a new direction because he couldn’t find a few bloody slips of paper.
Okay…well…maybe. Insert your own nervous laugh right here. I’m still giddy and sitting down is somewhat uncomfortable. My butt’s bruised and the thong that looked so cute earlier is chafing something fierce, so it’s hard to concentrate on anything but Harry.
“Ah…hah….so you have heard of my candidacy? Well…the support of someone of your stature would be very, very welcome, sir. Really? Well…with that kind of support on the line, I can promise you that the whole of my attention will be on getting things in line here.
“Easy there. No trouble. No gun on me either, man. We can talk about this…work something out. Girls, some money…I know people…we can make you pretty happy, you know?”
It was tough to get a gun with a condition like his these days, but a lot was possible if you were a likable ex-cop who still had a few friends in the right places. Remus knew he had problems, but he’d never once thought of hurting others. Only himself. Dora had thrown around words like cyclical depression and anxiety, along with the usual smattering of comforting remarks about how normal it was and how easily it could be treated. He had problems even more significant than those. Remus hated doctors…and the only thing he hated more than doctors…was taking pills. Even vitamins had made him break out in a cold sweat when he was kid. It wasn’t a rational fear, but it was his, and he was comfortable with that fear.
The man had doled out tea until the small pot was empty, and then excused himself to make more with the same perfect calm as before, but Harry had seen the glimmer of amusement in the man’s eyes as he’d turned to leave. John was no one’s fool, and he’d bloody well known how uncomfortable this would be!
Black is nothing but contradictions. He can talk like a sailor or a trucker, but he can sound like a professor or a poet when he wants to. What are the odds that the ‘weird’ things he sometimes says would be recognized by a pathetic prison bitch? He knows that I know he’s educated. I was so surprised when he quoted a passage from Dante’s ‘Inferno’ that I accidentally whispered the name of the book in response. Prison bitches don’t generally remember their private lessons in history and literature, and only I would recognize Chopin, and know the title of the song, when he whistled it during an idle hour. When I look at him or whisper the source of his oddball quotes, all he does is smirk mildly, or give me a wink when no one else can see us.
He had to leave…he had to pack and get out now before worse happened. A series of counter spells opened his trunk, and Draco snatched at things about the room and flung them in. In the corner of the trunk was his solace, his guidance, his deliverance. He’d lost himself in its contents a thousand times when beset by stress and fear, and his hand itched for its pages now. Draco reached for the book.
“Just enjoying a cool dip before bed. Wasn’t really worried about making myself a fashion model. You’re running a little late. Busy night?”
Harry calmed and flopped back onto the bed, feeling oddly like a teenager again, in this environment of the mind that perfectly echoed his happiest moments in Grimmauld Place. He sighed deeply and closed his eyes.
The benefits were obvious. Harry had never been made so horny, or satisfied so completely, in his entire life. In just a few months, he’d gone from being a shy schoolboy who had enjoyed a few discreet snogs and a bit of wanking in the company of others, to being a hungry, yet confident, sexual creature, experienced beyond the wildest dreams of his housemates.
Luna Lovegood looked up from her book with a smile. “Heya, Harry. Good to see you again…ditch the robes and let’s chat.”
It isn’t entirely fair to the British to ridicule their beef. The truth is that, on an island with limited resources, cattle are usually for milking, and for the production of cheese, especially Cheddar, at which the English excel. Renewable resources, because there just isn’t enough room for cattle to graze easily, and not enough room to grow the crops needed to feed large herds of beef cattle. The consequence of this is that, since beef is comparatively rare, they just don’t have a lot of practice serving it in innovative…not to mention tasty…ways. Since this is delicious, I forbear.
“Hah! A timely comment. I think I should tell you a little about what we really do here, before you sign your name to that contract. The Phoenix Corporation is quite legitimate, and exists primarily as a means to exploit the rather lax scrutiny of international corporations. Through the auspices of a privately held company, it is possible to move money and personnel around the globe with comparative ease, and this allows me to strive toward my primary goal. Impediment to goals is intolerable to the well-financed, and their influence has guaranteed that corporate travel and shipping enjoy a level of scrutiny far less intrusive than one might expect.
The slap that hit his face stung mightily, mostly because it was perfectly placed and this time coming from a healthy and sober person. Draco could feel his long sluggish blood leaping back into action, glands on fire and entire being thrumming with life. They stood only separated by the couple feet of fine wood, staring at one another, Harry furious and defiant, Draco smirking and suddenly feeling surprisingly like himself...and yet somehow not. Somehow...more. More...in control. In control of himself. In control of his emotions and actions. Harry obviously wasn't perfect. He wasn't a bastion of calm perfection. He was just...alive...human...and beautiful in his wrath.
Ron Weasley might be a professor, but he was an instructor for Flight and a Quidditch referee. Sure, the man had survived the war against Voldemort, but Harry Potter had been the final cause of victory…no one else had played such an important role. There was nothing to be learned from slogging along in the class of some ham-fisted lackwit who’d tagged along years ago and managed to live in spite of himself! That was his punishment?! A complete absence of real learning!
At the head of the table, he glanced at the man beside him, not a murderer or broken by regret, confident, literate and gentle, the husband and fellow father that had marked the last two decades of his life as memorable for their excellence, and Draco leaned toward Harry's ear.
“I dunno. Broken glass? You go check it out, wise guy. I’m up to my fuckin’ elbows in dishwater here. Loaded with loot an’ he don’t install a fuckin’ dishwasher. Go figure. Probably just tipsy and dropped a glass.”
Harry put the finishing touches on the roast, basting some of the juices back over the meat, then sprinkled fresh spices onto the surface, before placing the dish back into the oven. He’d rather missed his meals with Draco these last few weeks. He didn’t envy Draco his job, even though he loathed his own. Last week he’d dodged yet another browbeating session with Scrimgeour, who still periodically tried to get Harry to make public appearances. Almost fifteen years, and the relentless bastard hadn’t given up on his dream of transforming Harry into the spokesperson for every decision the Ministry made. In truth, Harry couldn’t have cared less, and went to great lengths to avoid being dragged back into the spotlight again.
“Damn. I don’t want this. I don’t want you to be here…like this…by yourself. I have to do what I have to do. Ron’s on the way. We only have a few minutes.”
Draco Malfoy languished in quiet agony. Everything was in ruins. Harry had punched him in the face! Sure, a quick spell had corrected the damage, but the insult was mortal! He’d gotten no work done at all, and simply threatened complete mayhem until they let him leave early for the weekend. He’d meant to have civil words with Harry, but they just never quite came out of his mouth that way, and Harry was no better!
Go figure? I spend years giving up my ass to everyone who wanted it and could afford it or had the strength to take it, but now that I’m free and happy, I blush at the thought of letting a stranger see it. Who understands these things?
Draco looked horrified and affronted. “I MOST CERTAINLY DID NOT MOLEST YOU! I’m quite sure you shoved that arm under me on purpose. And it was cold! You probably turned the heat off last night in some convoluted, passive/aggressive effort to get me close to you for who knows what unsavory purposes!”
“As you wish, my love. If you didn’t look picture perfect already, I’d drag you into the shower with me just for good measure, but it can wait…a little.”
So many moments where Draco had looked like he was about to crack and say something he was afraid of. So many glances that hinted at more than lust. Looks that had spoken of growing respect and a comfortable familiarity. But when Harry pushed the matter, Draco always clammed up, shutting down any semblance of affection or intimacy, treating Harry with total indifference, and always, always hanging the threat of terminating their acquaintance and its ‘benefits’ over Harry’s head.
Jamie tucked the tie into Harry's vest carefully, patting smooth after securing the knot just right. “Much better. You look sharp, Da! Don't let anyone fuss at you over it! I think you finally look like the kind of wizard who might just have saved the world...instead of just looking like my dad. I'm proud of you!”
He must already know that I’ve warned off the girls. He doesn’t protest at all, because he knows I planned this myself. When I fish his cock out of his boxers and through the fly of his slacks, he flops back against the wall, well aware of what’s about to happen when I dip low and let my nails rake across his chest on the way down.
Luna was frighteningly similar to Dora’s mother at times, and yet oddly better grounded at the same time. She was, of all things, an artist whose mediums were oil, watercolor, acrylic, and charcoal, and she was hanging her new display in an upscale coffeehouse on Halsted St. when Dora had nipped in for a latte. It was the gay friendly end of town, part of the long strip that made up Boystown, but despite the patriarchal nickname, more than a few shops there were owned, staffed and patronized almost exclusively by lesbians. The art was beautiful, and she hadn’t been able to keep her eyes off the slim neck and shoulders of the young woman hanging canvases on the wall. Staring turned to conversation, and conversation to dates, and dates inevitably led to something oh so much more.
It’s twisted, the way I feel something almost like jealousy when the latest residents of the ‘Bitch Tank’ get released into population. Maybe not real jealousy, more a sort of ‘professional envy’. I always worry about the pretty ones. My position hangs on my ability to be more interesting than anyone else Flint fucks. If someone younger and prettier and just a little more interesting shows up, I could find myself fucking half the building to stay alive, and that’s a fast track to AIDS and death, aside from the dozen or so other social diseases that could just fuck up my life in general. I’ve lived through having the clap twice, thanks to Flint fucking the new ones and bringing back a little something for me, but I know others have it worse. I just want his attention to stay focused on my ass and my ass alone until I get out of here.
Author's Note: This chapter is dedicated to Thrnbrooke, who has faithfully reviewed so many fics with kindness and cheer J Thank you, Thorny!!
The students stare in awe as the form of a blue whale made of pure light begins to swim through the air, circling the tower with massive beats of its tail and fins. Then, Sinistra makes a sharp, cutting gesture with her finger and the beautiful creature falls apart and fades away like it had never been there.
“Snow leopard,” Eve nods, her glare back on Draco, “Like he needed anything else to stroke his ego.”
“Well, what was he supposed to do?” Weasley demands from his best friend’s right. He looks equally furious. The only one who doesn’t is Granger, who is stiff and fidgeting, clearly wanting this to be over already.
means no one outside of the Cass name is allowed to read it.” Leandra shoots Granger an apologetic look and Draco suspects they’d likely already spoken about this before Draco and Harry had arrived.
“But, I can see the necessity of your actions,” Narcissa says softly, setting back the broken lens, then sweeps past Draco and walks towards the hall. “Come. I want you to show me these photos and records.”
Also also! If anyone was interested? I listen to a lot of music as inspiration as I write and this song right here was on my mind a lot lately as I wrote this chapter:
That is abundantly clear now. The boy wonder’s eyes are downcast, back curved, shoulders slumped, and bags under his eyes. He’s frowning, which he’s been doing a lot of, and his mind looks to be miles away.
“Go get Dumbledore,” he orders and Eve nods, too shocked to argue, then turns and runs for the castle, leaving Draco to look after their discovery.
The Dark Room, which seems self-explanatory to Draco, where the study of dark magic takes place and the only way to access it is through the Blood Quarters.
Surprisingly, or not so, it appears most of the people waiting for Harry and Draco are Gryffindors. The rest of the team has members of their own house waiting to grab them and congratulate them, but that isn’t the case for the two, first-year boys.
“Draco!” Mr. Nubble called from one room over, not at all pleased by the commotion, while McGonagall looked down at the blond boy with an arched brow.
The zoom on his camera is dreadful, but it allows him to pick up some faint movements of the silhouettes. One, the taller one, keeps swaying on their feet, looking kind of drunk from where Draco’s standing, and the other, the short, stocky one, is raising their arm and--
“I am? I didn’t even get a welcome basket. I refuse to acknowledge such a placement until I am given a proper welcome basket,” Draco huffs daintily, flipping his hair.
The sheer number of books makes it clear that Max’s mother may have gotten a little overexcited. It is still a touching sentiment, however, so Draco is sure to stash each one into his trunk back to Hogwarts. With finals coming up, however, he isn’t sure how many he’ll be able to finish.
He follows after the two Gryffindors, heading around the castle grounds, as they fill him in on the truth of Sirius Black.
“Daphne and Astoria are fine. They were here earlier to catch up on everything, but they’re really exhausted. Apparently, not long after we left, Professor Snape and some other faculty stepped in,” Blaise explains, but he’s frowning. “As for Sophie…”
“It began as a place to house magical creatures that could not be hidden from Muggle eyes, thus the name,” Draco replies absently. Each door had a plaque with a letter and number on it, followed by the corresponding animal’s name just underneath. The Lung Dragon was in F8, according to its file. “Now, however, they also keep endangered creatures, interesting creatures for examination, dangerous creatures, and creatures in need of medical attention, if needed.”
Draco can’t think of anything better to do than squeak, turn around, and start running as fast as he can away.
“I suppose it is my turn to share…” Draco sighs, having put off his reveal as long as possible, hyperaware of Potter’s gaze snapping to his face. With a shaking hand he reaches to take out his radio, unshrinking it like an afterthought, and shows it to Potter.
So, yet again, he would simply have to trust his friends’ intuition. He reminds himself that they’re Slytherins, too. They’re just as cautious as he is, nothing like a Gryffindor, and they wouldn’t throw their lives away that easily.
Pushing off feels like freeing himself from reality. For a second when he separates from the earth Draco feels like he is lifting into his own little world, like he has transitioned into another existence. Then he’s coming back into his own, eyes taking in his surroundings, fingers and feet adjusting until he’s comfortable and confident. He glances down and Vivian throws a thumbs up at him.
“He’s not really talking to us,” Weasley tacks on, scratching at the back of his head and looking as dejected as Draco feels.
“Perhaps now you will stop complaining about Mr. Potter for a few days and focus on your new position,” Lucius says flippantly, making Draco snicker in embarrassment. He didn’t complain about Potter
Weasley and Hermione are still asleep, but the magical healing clouds have disappeared, which he takes as a good sign. Ginny sleeps in the bed beside her brother, likely needing to rest her leg a bit longer and unwilling to leave Weasley’s side. Theodore is sprawled on the bed left of Draco’s, the boy seemingly well enough to sleep, but not to leave Madam Pomfrey’s supervision. Sophie lays alone in her corner of the room, silent and still.
“I didn’t know they’d done that!” Ron exclaims, leaning forward, and Draco doesn’t even hide his sigh.
“Only on dad’s side,” Eve waves him off. “A Long is the appropriate name for a Lung Dragon, the intelligent variants of dragons that originate from China and have spread their territories to many other Asian countries, including Japan.”
“This really happened, didn’t it?” Draco whispers, looking up pleadingly at the Muggle woman. He desperately wanted her to tell him he was wrong, that it really was just a story, but based off the shocked look on her face it is clear Max’s mother always thought Draco knew it was real.
Vivian groans. “I didn’t see who they were either… Just a shadow and then BLOW! Stunned,” the redhead shakes her head, crossing her legs and breathing deeply. “Didn’t even see them raise a wand or nothin’!”
For a moment Sinistra just looks at the two. “Await my owl,” she eventually says and Draco realizes they haven’t actually agreed to anything, yet. It doesn’t really matter, though. Their answer is obvious and Sinistra must know that. “You will need to show your skills in front of Mr. Flint. Until then, Mr. Potter, go ahead and retrieve a broom from home, I suspect Dumbledore will have no issue with my request. Mr. Malfoy, keep that broom in your dorm room. You may return it once you have your own. You are dismissed.”
The other boy, however, spots the raised brow and his grin vanishes. “N-not that that’s bad! I just… My mom’s muggleborn so… okay, I shouldn’t have been so blunt, I’ve been told it’s an issue, so… I wasn’t trying to be rude, I swear.” Oh, the boy thought Draco was upset. Well, it wouldn’t hurt to let him sit in it for a few seconds, would it?
“Humans or wizards?” Draco asks absently, still looking into the water. A few fish swim by, but nothing bigger.
“Hermione…” Draco sighs, shaking his head, and he looks to her like he feels bad for her. “Let me tell you HOW he uses it. I nearly fell off my broom once, right? Well, he yelled, not kidding here, ‘Why do you have to malarkey everything up all the time, Malfoy?’”
“Still a little shit, though,” George snorts and Draco chuckles at him, before they get back to practice.
Draco picks up the paper, the conversation around him shifting to one of Ron’s older brothers named Charlie, who apparently works with dragons, but Draco is too enraptured with the clipping to join in.
Draco, exhausted and rattled, and only after he is absolutely certain Potter is completely asleep himself, allows himself to fall into slumber too.
Draco stares at Longbottom, eyes hard, and he’ll give it to the other boy, he stands his ground. He keeps fidgeting, but he stands his ground. Then Draco scoffs, desperately shoving down all the feelings that are crawling up from his gut and attempting to choke him out. “Then this is his own fault, if you ask me.”
This was Umbridge trying to squash a perceived threat before it had even started, but had only succeeded in strengthening the resolve of all those involved. Draco could see it in their eyes, could see the anger at so blatantly being denied their rights of self-defense. Even Zacharias Smith had been incensed. The only ones that didn’t seem to share these feelings were Blaise and Edgecombe.
“Nothing-- Are you serious? Draco, these people need help, they aren’t asking for the moon!” Max’s retort comes through frustrated and sharp, which only makes Draco’s tone more dismissive.
Potter’s breathing begins to turn ragged, like he’s been shaken out of a stupor and remembers how to be terrified like everyone else, and Sirius finally spots Draco over his godson’s shoulder.
“Oh, yeah, sorry, just… I’ve heard so much about Hogwarts that I can’t wait to actually go myself,” the boy’s lips suddenly twist into a thoughtful pout, brows furrowing. “Wish they’d let us have our own brooms, though. Dad says the school ones have always been garbage…” the boy’s head tilts and he looks mildly annoyed, “Then he tells me he wants a full play by play of when I finally have to ride one. I think he’s messing with me.”
“Why didn’t you?” Draco shoots back, raising both his brows in question. He had suspected Potter would be able to see the thestrals after Diggory’s death, but he hadn’t brought it up. It didn’t feel like it was place.
Ungracefully, and after a short hesitation, Potter plops down in the grass beside him, leaving plenty of space between the two. “And you snuck by Hagrid to do this?”
“That should be Hermione, then!” Weasley motions to the bushy-haired girl beside him and even Granger is nodding along.
Feeling bold, Draco and Weasley scurry to stand back up, looking up at the head of the Lung Dragon. “We want to publish the research we gather here today and properly demolish people’s trust in the Ministry. We aren’t here to manipulate you,” Draco promises, no longer needing to yell over the storm.
“I…” beside him Harry glances over at Hermione, looking worried, before he nods, “Yeah, I’d imagine. I think cousins?”
Gemma goes on and on a bit longer, bashing Gryffindor at one point and making Draco scowl, and explains the password for the dorms will change every fortnight, so they need to keep an eye on the noticeboard. She warns never to hand out the password and not to bring anyone into their common room. “No outsider has entered it for more than seven centuries,” she adds smugly, and Draco really, really doubts that. Seven centuries? That’s too long for something like that.
“Harry and some of the DA have gone to the Ministry,” he says urgently and Sirius’s posture is stiffening, face tightening.
They step off the train, some of the first off thanks to Hermione rushing them along, and immediately are swarmed by students of all ages, pushing them around to get where they need to be. For a moment Draco is overwhelmed, looking around frantically and not knowing where to go, but then Hermione is grabbing his wrist and dragging them to what appears to be a small gathering of first years. Vincent and Greg end up joining them as well, standing right behind them, and a familiar, chubby boy stands to Hermione’s side, looking downtrodden.
“It may not be so bad?” Weasley tries to suggest, scowling despite his hopeful words, “Malfoy said half of them were alright folks…”
“I am well aware, thank you, and I am already ready to strangle someone with my own hair,” Hermione hisses.
Once they are both done Max just about drags Draco out of the booth, begging their father for money for the jukebox machine.
“Could have fooled me,” Theodore comments, lounging sideways in an armchair on the other side of the fireplace. Crabbe and Goyle are hanging around him today, which Draco has noticed them doing more and more of. Thank Merlin for small miracles.
First, he heads to the hospital wing, in case Harry actually did end up hurt, but he isn’t there. “Did Potter come by here, Madam Pomfrey?” he asks, when she catches sight of him.
“If it doesn’t work, we’ll just figure something else out,” Eve says, looking at Draco through the corner of her eye while tilting her head skyward. “Dumbledore said all the jobs he’d planned to give to Mad-Eye he’s changed ownership to, there are additional traps in the maze that will slow down the champions, and the Ludo Bagman article Skeeter’s gonna drop the day before will probably mean we’ll have to wait for a new judge when he skips town.”
They stand there for a long while, desperately trying to pull each other back together, with the sounds of hooting owls in the distance.
“How many of you are familiar with the Militus Charm?” Draco finally says, voice snappish and loud in the room, and the attention shifts to him.
A presence hurries to Draco’s side, though, yelling, “Oh no you don’t!” and is casting a Binding Spell on the downed Malfoy before he can do anymore damage. Draco shakes out his head and looks up to his savior.
“We cannot prove if something is supernatural. There is no way to document or test such a claim. Really, Draco, you should know better,” Hermione finally leans away from her book and crosses her arms, looking like an angry poodle.
Harry snorts and shoves at Draco, a smirk on his face as he replies, “Excuse you. I’ve been doing a great job with your ‘selfish prick’ lessons, thank you very much.”
“Could we please return to the fact that you illegally entered a Ministry Department to copy confidential and private documents over Easter Holiday?” Granger hisses, thankfully keeping her voice down this time.
“Yes…” he says, realizing this is the first real thing he’s said since he sat down in this room, too stunned to speak, and usually he was eager to get a word in.
On Monday he woke up earlier than anyone else and rushed out to the front garden, weeding it and tending to the plants while talking quickly to the snakes. He had all three of their attentions today, which he thought was nice, with Shadow staring at him, Snowflake slithering around his trainers, and Muddy demanding head scratches.
He turns and makes his way back to the front desk, presenting the cage to McGonagall and then the employee. The wizard looks to the cage in boredom before doing a doubletake and stepping back. “Hey, kid, listen, that owl… maybe not a good choice for a first owl,” he says, sounding frantic, eyes darting between the eagle owl and Draco as if expecting the bird to somehow attack from within her cage.
No one says a word, they just look at each other, and Draco sees the exhausted resignation in his cousin’s eyes and realizes this is not the first time that this has happened.
by that point, that they hadn’t been thinking. But then they’d processed the people staring at them in shock and they’d realized what they had done.
“Yes,” Sinistra raises a hand and snaps her fingers. From her raised pointer finger an ember of red fire snaps to life. She does a little wiggle with her fingers that seems purposeful and the fire changes to blue. A different wiggle and it’s green, then yellow, and then she snuffs it out. “Wands are a handicap.”
He sees a doorway just ahead, clattering and crashing echoing from the open door, and he hurries forward. Just as he’s finally getting there he hears a sharp cry, followed by a wand rolling into the open doorway. A very familiar wand.
“Yes,” Sinistra says shortly. The broom on the bottom is dark with big, obnoxious writing on the handle that reads “Bluebottle,” but, with her palm outward, it is the middle broom that jolts out of place and shoots into her hand.
The Hall of Prophecy? As in the rumored department in the depths of the Department of Mysteries? That was a weirdly specific location for Ebru to bring up… Unless…
Draco can see thestrals. That’s what he realizes the day everyone is leaving Hogwarts at the end of his fourth year and he spies the skeletal creatures pulling the preciously horseless carriages.
Draco thinks of all their moments sitting in silence, just thinking or resting or reading, and he finds he can understand that.
“Oh, yes!” Hermione pipes up, her expression brightening up and she nods so vigorously at Neville her hair flies around and smacks Vincent in the face. Draco thinks the boy’s surprised expression as he spits out curly hair is rather hilarious. “There is still hope!”
“It does,” Tracey nods, “Did you know the word lunatic came from the belief that changes in the moon caused moments of insanity?”
They fade off, falling asleep so easily it is like they’ve been doing it for years. In a way, too, that is what it’s like. They may have only begun napping and finding comfort in the other’s contact recently, but ever since they’d known each other they had felt a comfort in familiarity. Even when they’d hated each other, the bickering and fighting had felt fluid, bouncing off each other naturally. Cruelly… but naturally.
“Voldemort, you mean?” Draco says blandly and both boys flinch like they’d been startled. They probably had. “I was just an infant, I haven’t the slightest,” he continues, forcing his voice to be calm and conversational. “But he’s dead and gone now, so who really cares, right?”
The DA agrees, beginning to disperse, but everyone gives Longbottom happy, excited congratulations. It’s a wonderful, powerful moment, but Draco finds his gaze lingering on Harry, watching as the Gryffindor beams.
Harry doesn’t let him finish, delving back in and their tongues are battling, writhing together in a way that makes Draco unable to concentrate on anything else. He moves forward, pressing Harry back and he shifts, making Harry break away to gasp and try and figure out what he’s doing.
"He's just a boy." She finishes while standing straight and tall in her pitch-black robes. "Doing what his father told him, knowing he'd be punished otherwise. We never gave Draco a choice and he did the best he could. Mr. Potter is correct when he said my son is not evil. He is a different generation of Malfoy than his father. Much better than either Lucius and I."
He changes the subject and thankfully she lets him. By the time they’ve reached the Seventh Floor they’re discussing Hagrid’s newest pet: a fire-breathing salamander.
He glances around quickly before looking at Malfoy again, noting that his hair is cut almost identical to how it was in Sixth Year.
“Luna sits with us all the time.” Harry says, starting to shift nervously. Draco bites back the argument that it’s
Ron groans. "Yeah, but what about people like Harry? He's grown up 'round muggles, hasn't he? Why should he have to take the class if he doesn't want to?"
“Yes, exactly. Well not exactly, there’s loads of other stuff, but that too.” Draco glances down at his chest where he can still picture the cuts. “The majority of our history is bad. How can we possibly hope for anything else, never mind- whatever it is we’re doing now?”
Harry tilts his head to the side to look at him more closely, noticing the faint blush spreading across his cheekbones.
“You’re fine.” Harry scrambles for a topic, a heavy silence falling between them. He doesn’t want to suggest leaving quite yet but at the same time the anticipation makes him feel like he’s going to throw up.
He pulls away after a long time, attempting a small smile. “Thank you for having me. I really did have a good time.”
“Draco, darling.” His mum is frowning as she butters a slice of toast at their breakfast table in the Manor. “I know this is important and you’re the best in the field but is it really necessary for you to go into the Ministry so often? Why can’t you work from home?”
Hermione suggested counselling one day. It had been timidly said and Harry had just shaken his head. He knew talking to people had helped her after she'd brought her parents memories back, but he didn't think he'd be comfortable with that.
The other boy’s attention is a heavy thing. So is the knowing in Blaise’s eyes. “You’re protecting Draco.”
Harry can’t deny the fact that this animosity with him and Malfoy is familiar, almost welcome. "Go sit with the people who will actually tolerate you if you feel like being a right tosser."
“Come on.” He practically whispers, jerking his head as footsteps grow audible in the distance of some passing younger students. “Let’s go.”
The pause hangs long and expectant but Harry can’t find the words they are all waiting for. As nice as it is for her to say them, he can’t find it in himself to pretend the sight of Narcissa and the words she’s said haven’t brought back all of the old feelings against Draco he’d gotten over ages ago, only now they are far more intense and justified while aimed at her.
“Were we having one?” Draco takes another bite and looks at him, a teasing glint in his eye. “Can’t say I noticed.”
But he can only manage to wonder for a few seconds before Harry is erasing all thoughts from his mind. His lips have moved down to Draco’s jaw and he sucks deeply, teeth coming out to bite ever so slightly and making Draco whimper and buck his hips without permission.
“Sure.” Harry agrees, something in him going at ease. They’ve decided they won’t have Beaters and Bludgers, but Chaser still seems like the easiest position to start young Lydia out in. “Anybody else?”
But now it’s not Draco that’s the problem, it’s Harry. And the way Harry thinks (knows) he feels about Draco.
He pulls his book out before Malfoy can answer, and his inkpot and quill, looking at the notes on the board. Apparently, Slughorn is starting them out slow, with no actual potion making for the first day or two, only lectures.
Silence ticks by for a few seconds before Harry clears his throat to continue. “It’s that, but also the rest of it. Everyone else, outside in the real world, beyond the castle. Anyone associated with me gets sucked into this- this cesspit of attention, and-”
“You started it,” Draco murmured but one corner of his mouth twitched up. “Nobody asked you to get all maudlin.”
The feelings are distracting Harry to a truly despairing degree and he’s glad that most of their professors are going easier on them this last week before winter holidays. He’s not the only disrupted student and for that he’s grateful. When his friends notice and ask Harry explains his preoccupation away as excitement for break, all the while ignoring Draco’s quietly smug look.
He’s glad he resists adding on that his history with Harry had just seemed too overwhelming added on top of everything else. They all know what they’d been like in school but Draco’s sure they wouldn’t really understand the full extent of how far he and Harry have come.
“People can change, Mrs. Weasley.” Hermione begins tentatively, but Ron and Ginny speak so loud they nearly drown her out.
And maybe he worries that if Blaise and Ginny start dating when he and Harry are then that means one of them won’t work out. It’s stupid and ridiculous but Draco can’t help but think there’s no way two couples spanning the House divide in their friend group can work. One was hard enough to believe, but two? It seems impossible.
The first day he gets back he thinks her unusual cheerfulness is just from him being home and a natural result of him temporarily giving her a reprieve from the solitude she’s had. She says she’s fine, that she’s been speaking with people through letters, that she
Harry thinks about all of this the Thursday night before Halloween. He turns over in his four-poster.
“Because you already are.” She lifts to her tiptoes to press her lips to his cheek before putting a bit of space between them again for their eyes to meet. “You’ve already done better.” Something sad crosses her face. “Your father and I made a lot of mistakes, and we’ve left you with a greater burden than we ever wanted you to have. But you’re handling it better than either of us dreamed you could, and far better than we could have ourselves.” She pauses. “You’ve already made us proud, Draco. Whatever you think we’re feeling about our current situation, I need you to know that neither of us blame you for any of it. We know we put us here. We know we dragged you down with us.”
