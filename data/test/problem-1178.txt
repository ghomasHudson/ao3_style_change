“The order of which you said that is mildly concerning regarding what you think my priorities are?” Harry pointed out, not wanting to think too much on the fact that Draco is with Neville right now, possibly being asked out on a date.
if you want to check it out <3
“Fuck, you’re really-” Draco zoned out the rest of his comment, parting his lips as he took the flushed member into his mouth. He tried to take it as deep as he could before gagging, forcing himself to stop. Harry groaned even louder, his hand settling on top of Draco’s head. He felt his fingers grasp his hair, but he wasn’t pulling hard enough to cause pain.
“Well, no. But I will consider it,” he replied. “I was thinking along the lines of coming with me as my plus one?” he said hopefully.
“The Daily Prophet disagrees with that statement, I’ll have you know,” Harry scoffed playfully. “Where’s your #1 Most Desired Bachelor of the month page?”
So now he has confirmation that the Slytherin Neville is planning to ask out is Draco, and he’s not quite sure what to do. Thinking back to his conversation with Hermione from breakfast, he concluded that he should just avoid interfering. By the sounds of it, Neville hasn’t asked him on the date yet, which means that there’s still a possibility that he’d say no.
“Children, please settle down,” the Headmistress chided, earning herself an immediate reaction. It was almost hilarious how fast the Great Hall became silent.
“Well yeah,” Draco shrugged, side-eyeing him before looking back up at the ceiling. “He asked me to come with him.”

. Harry resisted the urge to frown. He didn’t want to be
said, nodding briefly once more before stepping out of the circle Harry cast around them for privacy and making his way back to the front. However, instead of heading straight to the rest of the Beauxbatons students, another man- dark and also considerably handsome- from the table stood up and joined him as they made their way over to the other side of the hall.
“Fuck, you’re so sensitive,” Harry groaned, relieving some tension off himself by rubbing his cock against Draco’s stomach. “You want to come already?”
“Of course it doesn’t, but that’s life, isn’t it?” This time, Malfoy laughed humorlessly. “The world looks down on sex work. It is what it is, but I do what I need to get by.”
Draco immediately began bobbing his head up and down once he was sure he wouldn’t gag, this time trying to go all the way down to the base and take all of Harry like how he had seen in those Muggle videos. Even as the head of his cock hit the back of his throat, making him gag around the hardened length, he made himself keep going.
“Really?” she asked, looking a bit taken back. “Oh, thank you, then. At least one of you is being reasonable”
It was a sketchy route to take, Harry knew, but honestly, he didn’t really care. Sure, he was too tired to apparate without the risk of splinching himself, but that doesn’t mean is incapable of defending himself should something happen. He was a wizard, after all.
“Draco,” Harry whispered, his face just inches away from Draco’s, their lips aligned. He gave his sleeping boyfriend a slow, chaste kiss, enjoying how soft he felt beneath him. “We’re going to be late,” he said again.
Harry groaned when he found himself locked out of Draco’s apartment once again the following week.
“Shall we get ready now?” Harry asked, making no movement to get up. He threw his arm over Draco’s waist, pulling him closer.
Once they were in an empty classroom, Harry immediately pressed Draco against the closed door.
“Yes?” Draco drawled, raising an eyebrow at him. Harry took a silent breath as he tried to remind himself why he was there.
Thanks for reading! I'll try to update as often as I can. You can also receive updates from my
“Stay out of this,” Harry grumbled before responding to Draco. “I’m sorry I messed up our project, I know it was my turn to check on the potion, but seriously? I asked you for help because I didn’t understand and you waved me off.”
Harry had to admit that, even at his expense, that would be quite a show, and perhaps, not even a bad idea. Only if it meant getting Draco there, of course.
Yes, everything was going amazing.
“Thanks for letting us be here, mister,” He said, holding out his hand. “We don’t get to enjoy things like this often.”
Draco pressed his forehead to Harry’s chest, taking a deep breath.
——————————————
“I don’t do one-offs, Malfoy,” Harry responded firmly. “I’d like to take you on a date at least. Treat you well.”
“It’s to my knowledge that when they became suspicious of any possible act of magic, whether it were real magic or not, they believed that person to be evil and burned alive whilst declaring them ‘witches’ and ‘evil.’ Now pair that with a whole school of real magic, and the possibility of someone letting it slip to a Muggle, exposing the entire wizarding community.”
“Alright, sir,” Harry gave in, nodding slightly.
“Fuck, you’re so tight,” Harry gasped, resting his forehead against Draco’s. Silently, he was glad he wasn’t the only one that needed a second to get used to the sensation of having the entire length of Harry’s cock up his arse. “Just give me a minute.”
“I know.” Harry gaped while Malfoy let out a sigh, running his hand through his hair.
“...and grow to be better, and to be more than who they were before. I would also like to announce that because of the many hands that helped rebuild the school, the other professors were able to prepare for the next school year. With that said, Hogwarts will be ready to accommodate students in time for September 1, and will function as peacefully and normally as before.”
fault the man still couldn’t manage to drag himself out of bed on time. He had resisted Harry’s attempts over the last two days, and now it seems he’s taken drastic measures to keep Harry out.
“Don’t you want to see if you’ll ever be happy if you were actually with him? If he gave you a chance,” the older man said. “You’re wasting your life away just hoping that it would become real one day.”
He was just as, if not more, meticulous as Hermonie when it came to organizing, and he doesn’t know why he found it so endearing on Draco, but it was, unlike when Hermione did it sometimes. Whatever the reason, he was perfectly content to watch Draco flick his wand sharply while shelving the books quickly.
He wouldn't give up his chance with Draco so easily.
Draco didn’t know why those words shocked him, but they did.
“C’mon, boys,” Hermione sighed. “Just get on the train.”
“Okay so first, I’m going to need you to wet your hair. We’ll work in the potion after that and let it sit before rinsing it out. It should last you a while, but you should probably redo the treatment every week or every other week to maintain it,” Draco instructed, waving him off to one of the showers.
“Oh psh,” Draco waved his hand. “What do I need a licence for? I’m pretty brilliant, aren’t I?”
“Shy, Potter?” Draco raised an eyebrow. “After that spectacle of a show you put on a while ago?”
“I mean... you look tired,” and he did. While Malfoy looked good, all things considered, he looked exhausted. Possibly from working late nights, but Harry felt that there could also be emotional exhaustion from the little incident he witnessed just a few minutes ago.
“Duelling,” Harry eventually piped up.
“Potter,” Robards called, poking his head through his office door. Speak of the devil, as they would say.
“Just a few more minutes,” Draco sighed contently, his eyes fluttering to a close. “They can wait a while. I don’t think I can be arsed to get out of this comfortable position,” he murmured drowsily, reusing Harry’s excuse from awhile ago.
They were so close to one another that there wasn’t much else for Harry to look at and distract himself with besides Draco’s face, which wasn’t helping much. For a split second, his eyes darted towards Draco’s lips, which had gone slightly pale from the cold before deciding that it wasn’t such a good idea after all. His lips looked sinfully delicious and he just wanted to kiss them until they were swollen, red, and back to being warm.
“Er, we…” Harry scrambled to string together a reasonable excuse, a warmth creeping up from his neck.
“Oh yeah, you were managing just fine minutes ago!” Harry snapped, unsure as to why Malfoy was rejecting his offer. He just wanted to help the stubborn git.
“That was an awfully late reaction,” Draco said, furrowing his eyebrows while he stared at the spot where the glass hit the floor.  His eyes were still noticeably droopy, however, and he let the issue slide with a lazy shrug.
“Harry, fuck,” Draco gasped. Harry repeated the action, his finger now massaging the tense muscle of his arse until it softened when Draco relaxed.
He had, much to all of their friends’ amusement, been nurturing a strong crush on the man that had come to be one of his closest friends for a while now, but every time there was an opportunity to ask him out, Harry always flobbed it. Either that or Draco didn’t get the hint.
“Alright, fine,” Harry sighed, leaning against his desk.
“What does it do?” Pansy Parkinson asked, only looking mildly interested in what her friend has to say. Harry, on the other hand, was trying not to eavesdrop on their conversation and keep track of what Ron and Hermione were talking about.
“I can’t wait until our honeymoon,” Draco murmured softly into his ear, too soft to be heard by anyone else. “But I guess it would be rude to leave our guests now.”
“Yeah, he talked about the
, of all people.
“Fleur!” Ginny said gratefully. “‘My beautiful, lovely sister. Lend us your powers of grace, or something, and help me tame this mess.”
“Fine!” Ron snapped before storming out of the common room. “Go have fun with your bloody snake.”
Harry remembered. Of course he remembered. She, Nott, Crabbe, and Goyle had all given them hell since the first year they’ve been in Hogwarts.
“Watch this neat little trick I learned from a Muggle book!”
“But it seems you have a lot to think about,” he continued, not caring about Harry’s lack of response. “So I think I’ll leave you to it. See you in class.”
“Shall I assign someone else to wake the pair of you up, now?” Robards asked with a small sigh. “Same address, I presume?”
“Draco,” Harry moaned. “Your hand-”
“Yeah, I know,” the small boy replied. “My favorite is Hermione Granger. She’s pretty.”
“Right,” Ron scoffed. “Don’t tell me you’re about to start worshipping the ground he walks on as well.”
“I’m sure that won’t be necessary,” Draco chuckled, some tension releasing from his body. “Really, though, I should start getting ready.”
“Bugger off,” Ron said in response. “We weren’t asking you.”
“Sure, but I didn’t say anything for you either,” Harry pointed out, unsure why he wouldn’t just take the absolution and run away like he wanted. “I mean, I did kind of agree with Ron at first, so I wanted to say sorry.”
The hand that was massaging his bollocks moved up to palm his flank, running the flat of his palm over the length of his cock. It felt even hotter under his hand, and Draco bucked up his hips to press himself harder against him.
“What is it?” Harry asked, putting his needles down. He sent his overly-animated boyfriend out to buy some thread and meat for dinner and he comes home with something else. Maybe it was time to consider just wine for dinner, or something. Spice it up with some trail mix.
Quietly, as to not draw attention to himself if there really was nothing bad happening, he peeked his head past the corner of the building to see the large build of a short man towering over someone who appears to have fallen and was now lying on the hard pavement.
, he added mentally.
Suddenly, he heard a crash in a narrow side alley and some screaming. He knew that he should have kept walking, that it was none of his business and that he should have ignored it, but something inside him was screaming to check it out.
There were a few scattered chuckles around the hall, and Harry found his lip twitching into a smile. Hermione listened attentively, clearly curious as to what their former Transfiguration teacher might announce, while Ron sat beside her, grumbling about being hungry.
Huh, so they have. Harry was too distracted to notice that other people had found their way to the dance floor and had begun dancing alongside them. Most of which, notably, were couples.
The song that was strongly unfamiliar to Draco started playing, and it sounded like it was playing midway, so at least he had that much more to be grateful for. Now that he was closer to the stage and not being watched, he had the perfect opportunity to observe Harry and his attire.
“We’re discussing it because you’re panicking too much,” Pansy rolled her eyes. “Really, just tell him that you’ve never been with anyone and you could work it out together.”
“Who knows,” Ron shrugged. “Man does a lot of weird things to begin with.” Once those words came out of his mouth, his eyes widened and he earned a pointed face-palm from Hermione. “Don’t stalk him,” he pleaded.
Once he cut off the floo connection, he waved his wand towards the stray ashes that had flown everywhere and vanished them before making his way to the bathroom. After closing the door, he immediately began to strip his clothes, checking to see if he brought everything he needed.
“Hardly boring,” Harry snorted, quickly dodging his head to the side as a block flew in their direction.
“Shut up,” Draco glared, feeling his face heat. “It was purely for educational purposes, and
“We ought to buy those sold in potion vials, I suppose,” Harry grinned before settling himself between Draco’s legs. And then, once Draco managed to quell his giggles, “Could you hold your knees for me? Just so I’d have better access.”
Malfoy gave him a- surprisingly adorable- pout. “And who’s to say I’d still feel like trying it out then?”
“So, er.” Harry resisted the urge to smirk, because Draco hated when Harry said
He tried to shake off the heavy feeling in his chest by taking the longer route to the Gryffindor dormitories and giving himself some time to think during the walk.
There was no answer, so he knocked again. And again. And again. Eventually he just gave up and whispered
“Did you bring me coffee?” he heard Draco mumble softly, attempting to force himself up as though gravity wasn’t allowing him to.
“Don’t think that I’m some stupid virgin,” Draco said, his voice shaking. “I can handle you just fine.”
Seemingly unable to help himself, Harry gave Draco a long, affectionate kiss, his hands gently stroking the base of Draco’s neck.
“Do we have to?”
Harry wasn’t exactly in the mood to talk to him, though, because after a few hours of thinking, he decided that he wanted to apologize to Draco, something he knew Ron would get mad at him for.
Harry thought maybe he’s seen the worst of it, definitely not the last, with the ‘exploded’ car, but no. It appears dating the odd phenomena that is Draco Malfoy will never come with dull moments.
“Blood hell, Nev, they’re here!” he heard someone hiss, presumably Draco.
Hermione was beginning to fidget, having not yet been assigned a partner. Apparently, they wanted the Sorting Hat to assign partners based on how well the two students would get along, which is why they hadn’t been assigned prior to their arrival.
“And he didn’t decide to continue there?” Harry asked, feeling bewildered. Surely there are some inconsistencies in how things are being taught across the different schools around the world, so it would theoretically be easier to have just stayed in the same place.
“You said it first,” Draco reminded him. “And speaking of
Except, when he ran into Draco in the Grand Staircase, he was feeling significantly less tired. The other man, on the other hand, looked frazzled as he kept track of the students walking in a single file.
“Sorry, darling,” Harry grinned, placing a quick peck on the former Slytherin’s cheek, which quickly flushed an attractive shade of pink.
“I live in this area too,” Malfoy said, raising his eyebrow as if Harry were dim. “I’ve seen you walk by in the daytime.”
“And speaking of helping. Hermione! How would you feel about helping us out?” Ron asked enthusiastically. Hermione’s eyes shifted to Harry, weary and unsure of what to do, but Harry gave a subtle nod and tried to convey that it was alright. Whatever happens will happen, he supposed.
“Oh,” Harry said. He wasn’t sure of what else to say after that.
“Oh,” Draco murmured, lying back down. “Good.”
Hiding his sudden embarrassment, he rested his head against Harry’s shoulder so he wouldn’t be able to see his expression. A finger slid between the crack of his arse and began running over the furled hole, making Draco gasp. He felt himself clench when the finger rubbed slowly over his entrance.
“Harry,” Draco mewled. “Please- already-”
to my party, Draco. Late. And you brought your tipsy boyfriend with you.”
“You know, you fit that description too,” Harry laughed, making his way over to his frantic fiance and hugging him from the back. He placed a kiss on the back of his neck, earning himself a light shudder, but the blond persistently braved the task of making sure there were no pairings like Lucious Malfoy and Xenophilius Lovegood. Nope, no need to deal with that.
Suddenly, he felt the potion drip through the hairs on his scalp, caught at the base by Draco’s hand so the excess didn’t go to waste. Harry let out a violent shudder despite the previous warning and resisted the urge to squirm and distract the man that had volunteered to help him.
Harry let out a laugh at that and obediently straightened himself, allowing Draco to continue with his work. It took a few minutes; time Harry savoured greatly because of how good Draco was at giving head massages, until they were finally finished. Harry was almost disappointed to think that he’d have to do this on his own the next time.
Harry waited until his cock softened before pulling out and flopping on the bed beside Draco.
Before entering, he edited the man’s memory so that he wouldn’t be able to remember Draco’s face or his recognition of him at all before bringing him in to the Auror department where there were always people on duty.
“Actually, now that I think about it,” Draco thought out loud. “I want a cat.”
“You wish,” Draco scoffed. Then, he bolted back upright before looking at Harry suspiciously, making the fully dressed Auror flinch backwards to avoid having his head smashed by the other. “Wait, why are you here?”
“I’d say that was a success, wouldn’t you?” Hermione asked once most of the people had left the common room and retreated back into their dorms.
“Did you just-” Harry sputtered, staring. If he looked even closer, it almost looked like there was a small hole in the wall. He looked at Draco disbelievingly, but the man had already begun to doze off, his head lolling at an uncomfortable looking angle.
“Are you sure?” Harry asked. Draco nodded before giving Harry a shy smile. “You have to promise me that you’ll tell me if you don’t like something, though.”
“Harry, I bought you something!”
“I’m alright, thanks,” the blond man said, not noticing the way his green eyes widened. That voice, although empty without its usual drawl, was one he could easily pick out from a whole gala of chattering Ministry employees.
“Spit on me.” Harry repeated, doing his best to hold in his laughter.
“Of course it has,” Malfoy snorted, as if it were the most obvious question in the world. “It’s been worse, of course, so I should be fine.”
For more works, check out my
“Because I- You’ve done this before,” Draco stuttered, looking away.
“You ran away from the war because you were too much of a coward to face it! And now you think you can just waltz in here and enjoy the trip like nothing happened, like the battle you ran away from didn’t take place here!” Ron concluded, his breaths paced fast and shallowly.
“I think his private tutors recommended it,” she said. “Some pureblood thing instead of going to a wizarding primary. And his parents were ecstatic to raise a child prodigy, so he ended up abroad.”
, the unsaid words hung heavily in the air and they both knew it, but Harry didn’t want to say it out loud.
As if sensing Draco’s thoughts, Harry pulled off with a soft ‘pop’ before grabbing the abandoned lube on the bedside drawer, sitting back on his ankles.
“What, you ran away and hid?” the sneer was still present on Ron’s face, distrust evident in his voice. Harry wasn’t sure what to make of the other man yet. His mother did help him in the Forbidden Forest, but he still carried a strong dislike for Lucius Malfoy.
“Yeah, I guess,” she shrugged. “If I remember correctly, the program he joined in his fourth year was for Ilvermorny, fifth in Castelobruxo, and back to Ilvermorny in sixth.”
Still, no reply came. He glared half-heartedly before ripping the blanket off his partner, making him stir in the sheets before he finally turned to face Harry.
“The acupressure thing suppressed my gag reflex,” he explained proudly.
Draco, who probably noticed the still-quite-confused expression on his face, must have took pity on him and grabbed a knife. To end his life right there and thereby end his suffering? Perhaps. But no, instead he turned towards the plant and started scraping the surface of its leaves delicately.
“Harry!” he heard Hermione call after them, but he gave them a quick shrug, said not to worry, and told them he’d meet them in class.
I LOVE RON I SWEAR
“Potter!” He squawked with an offended noise, but Harry only laughed in reply, lifting his hand to ruffle the soft, blond strands further, which earned him a slap on the hand. Harry didn’t care. He thought Draco looked rather adorable with his hair all mussed up.
“Now children, this will be my final announcement before the exchange students arrive.” It was mid-breakfast on the day of the Beauxbaton students’ arrival. They were set to arrive at dinner time once all classes were finished, and Headmistress McGonagall has been stressing over this for weeks now.
“Rather confident, are you?” Malfoy sniffed. “There’s no need to insult your
If Harry stopped now, Draco thought he might never want to go again. That, and he didn’t think his nerves could handle preparing himself for the first time all over again.
“Actually, I did a study on that when I went to Castelobruxo in my 5th year!” Draco explained, his gray eyes lighting up with excitement.
“So you’ve mentioned,” Ron muttered darkly. “If you could give me a good, solid reason on why I should trust him and think he’s anything like his father, then maybe I’ll consider it. For Hermione, of course.”
“Love, if it makes you feel better, sex doesn’t normally look like that,” Harry said, lowering himself to get in Draco’s line of vision.
“Harry, stop moping and get ready,” Hermione chided as she breezed through Grimmauld Place, picking up his haphazardly strewn clothes that essentially looked to be serving as his floorboard.
“Right, yeah,” Harry nodded quickly, unsure of what he was agreeing to exactly. “I was just thinking, you know, since the Slytherins and I didn’t exactly get along before…”
“Stupefy,” he casted, aiming his wand at the short man and watching as he suddenly collapsed on the ground like a wooden plank. As soon as he fired the spell, he dashed over to where the guy that was being held, whose knees buckled as he collapsed against the wall of the building for support while he rubbed at his arm where he was held just seconds ago.
Harry easily agreed, wanting to see the wreckage and how bad it was. It was a good thing they were both okay. Maybe he should call a lawyer and sue th-
“No need to go into that,” Draco laughed nervously. “We should go. More tables to greet.”
Draco knew his moans were getting louder, but he couldn’t bring himself to care. Harry seemed to enjoy his reaction, anyhow.
Draco couldn’t focus on anything except the waves of pleasure that shot through him, the way his cock leaked and pleasure built at the base of his spine, begging for release. His skin tingled, feeling more sensitive everywhere his and Harry’s skin touched. When Harry sucked against the sweet spot on his collarbone, the sensation felt even stronger, making Draco moan wantonly.
“Wait,” Draco paused, making Harry freeze. “Was that my coffee?”
“He did give some pretty interesting facts earlier,” Harry mentioned. He did, technically, albeit Harry wasn’t really a fan of the response he gave. “She probably found it interesting and wanted to investigate for herself. You know how she is.”
“Sometimes. When we get tired after tending to the greenhouse, for example, or when Potions is our last period and he’d rather stay here instead of go all the way to the library or something since I have a sufficient amount of books,” Draco responded absentmindedly. “Aha!”
There’s no way Draco would want to stay now, he sighed. Maybe I should leave a note that he can take his time getting his things and moving out.
“It’s simple,” he reassured them, but it really wasn’t. Not when Harry was still nursing the fact that he fancied Malfoy. Who he was about to play gay chicken with. “You and Harry just have to be as gay with each other as possible. First to back out loses.”
“I said I was fine, didn’t I?” Malfoy snapped, suddenly defensive.
“Oh- oh fuck, I’m coming,” Draco moaned loudly, his head falling back on the pillow. He felt himself tighten impossibly around Harry’s length, the other man slowing down his movements, thrusting shallowly, as Draco rode out his orgasm.
“What’s up?” Harry asked, aiming for casual. They began walking side by side down the hall. Harry wasn’t even sure if they were meant to be in the same area, prompting Draco to walk with him, or if his classmate just wanted to talk with him.
“Potion for…..?” Harry trailed off. They had talked about a lot of potions, in his defense, because Draco had been helping him study for that subject in particular.
“Why?” He eventually managed to get out.
“Have you been arrested before? Because it must be illegal to look that hot,” Harry continued, not caring for the groans and people cringing around them. Draco shrunk further into his scarf, turning more scarlet as people gave them odd and amused glances.
“I thought you couldn’t be arsed to go,” Draco pondered out loud, looking at him with a raised eyebrow.
Harry squinted his eyes through the darkness of the room until he managed to make out a fallen alarm clock that appeared to have been thrown against the wall, lying on the floor, partially hidden by a desk. He briefly wondered how long it’s been there.
“Fuck,” he heard Harry say breathily, but Draco’s attention was now focused on the area in front of him. Slowly, he leaned forward until his lips were pressed against the soft material of Harry’s joggers, covering his hardening cock. He opened his mouth hesitantly before mouthing at the fabric, lapping his tongue across it as he got the material damp.
It took a while, but eventually the sensation waned into mild discomfort rather than pain. Figuring that it was enough, he wiggled a second finger beside the one that was currently sliding into him, trying to force it in as well. It was considerably harder and slightly more painful when he did it, but eventually he managed.
He turned around and saw his classmates try to pretend they weren’t watching his conversation with McGonagall go down and chuckled lightly to himself. “It appears they are. I’ll have them clear the area then, shall I?’
“I think so too.”
“Are you two planning on taking turns napping in Binns’ class then?” she asked skeptically, raising an eyebrow at them.
“Calm your tits, Draco,” Pansy sighed. “You guys have been inseparable since you came back from France. This is if I choose not to count my party and the nonstop letters you sent to each other while you were away.”
“Remind me why I agreed to this?” Harry grumbled, forcing himself to get up.
“Then why did you say you were only proposing because of the game?” Harry asked, somewhat confudled.
, where I also post short fics not on my ao3 account <3
Slowly, one finger began circling his nipple, teasing the skin there before gently running over it, making him gasp softly into the kiss. He felt Harry smile against his lips, sliding his tongue against Draco’s. He repeated the action until the small nub of nipple peaked before holding it between his thumb and forefinger.
“What? We’re not-,” Ron sputtered, but at that point, Neville had already begun to walk away. He turned to Harry. “Why is everyone defending him?”
“Morally gray, I know,” Harry shrugged, feeling somewhat helpless. “But still, we don’t actually know him, and Hermione seems to like him, so the least we can do is be quiet when he’s around.”
When he leaves, it’s gonna hurt. You’ll be surrounded by things that remind you of him His brain just had to ruin it.
Harry was inexplicably charmed, and it took everything in him to not break out into the goofiest, soppy grin.
“Mhmm,” Harry hummed. “Me too.”
Harry rolled his eyes in response. “He’s not up to anything so why would I stalk him?” They both visibly relaxed and smiled.
He saw the man who was being pinned tense, yet also slump as if accepting the inevitable. The short, stout man that was pinning the worker against the wall began moving his hands all over the trapped body, and Harry felt his gut twist. Harry heard him snap, "Now bend over," and that's when he knew he had to do something quick.
Harry wasn’t expecting him to, anyway. Once he was left alone, he looked across the hall and saw Draco staring back at him, a curious expression covering his face before he turned back distractedly to face Hermione and respond to whatever she was saying.
“I could trip and you would say it’s because of my breathing,” Draco huffed, still feeling fussy about the wedding arch. It wasn’t even that bad, if Harry may say so himself. Just a few choice of odd flowers, no harm.
“Sure thing,” Harry agreed instantly, not wanting to give the blond a chance to change his mind and retreat. Draco climbed in and Harry immediately wondered if he could just leave Ron and Hermione to find their own carriage and take off with only Draco with him. He would have been doing them a favor. He knew what other students got up to when couples got carriages to themselves, anyway.
“Yes, of course. An eye for an eye.”
“Why?” Harry asked, feeling bewildered. Most schools started their first years similarly to Hogwarts; at the age of 11. It wasn’t even required to attend a wizarding primary, just as long as they got some sort of basic education.
“Right, sure,” Harry sighed in relief, not quite believing his best friend but choosing to do so anyway if only to save himself from feeling embarrassed.
Better late than getting accidentally injured on the field from fatigue.
“No,” Harry snorted, rolling his eyes as he was pulled out of his staring. “It’s me in the flesh.”
“Alright, Potter, what do you want?” Draco asked, crossing his arms defensively once they were stood outside the classroom, away from the door.
“No,” Harry said in attempts to look unaffected, even while he could feel himself flush from the neck up. “Do you admit that was you’re goal, though?”
“Right...” Draco said, uncertain, before following Harry. The Gryffindor could feel Ron glaring holes into the side of his head, but he did his best to ignore it. No, if Ron didn’t want to talk to Draco, then that was his problem. Harry knew apologizing was the right thing to do.
“No, it’s not,” he confirmed, scooting closer. His softened cock came into view and Draco practically forced himself to look away, trying not to stare too hard and embarrass himself further.
Eventually, once Draco realized that struggling was futile, he dropped all his weight and gave in to Harry’s manhandling until he was set down gently on the floor.
At this, Harry froze again, but Draco didn’t seem to be sharing the same problem. Almost as if he’d never actually had a problem pulling himself out of bed for the last two weeks, he slipped out of the covers and walked towards the bathroom.
Sex. Sure, he was well aware of what they were doing, but he still wasn’t used to hearing the word out loud, more so say it himself.
He gave Harry a shy grin, which he was glad to return back, giving him a quick, chaste kiss before taking a step back and pulling Draco with him. He began waltzing messily, taking whatever steps he felt like while making sure to hold Draco close to him before getting tired and collapsing back onto the sofa.
“Sorry,” Draco flushed, somewhat self-conscious of his reaction. “It tickled a bit.”
“You wish,” Malfoy huffed, getting up from his spot. Parkinson squealed and clapped her hands from her spot next to where Malfoy had just abandoned his seat. “Do feel free to back out any time you can't handle it, Potter.”
“No, I will not give you the quill,” Harry snorted, cutting him off before he could even ask.”It’s the only one I have, so you’re going to have to ask your brothers for one.”
“The hair potion your family invented, you dolt??” Draco responded, rolling his eyes fondly. “I knew you’d forget, so I’ve taken it upon myself to order it for you.”
Harry declined, helping Ron finish the pillar quickly instead. However, rather than going straight back home to Grimmauld Place, he hung back and slowly made his way to the Greenhouse where Draco and Neville were attending to the plants. They did their fair share of work around and replanted everything necessary already but volunteered to check on them daily and take care of them until the school started and Professor Sprout wouldn’t be as busy.
out of bed.
“And how exactly do you plan on bringing the car?”
“Why?” Draco glared at him, finally sitting up. Harry grinned triumphantly and stood, extending his arm once more to offer help in pulling him out of bed. Once again, his hand was slapped away.
Draco rolled his eyes as he said this while eyeing the crumbs that fell from his sandwich with distaste. Harry simply shrugged at the comment and called Draco a prat while flicking a crumb at him.
Harry felt a blush creep up from his cheeks and mentally willed them to stop since Draco’s hands were on his face and would most likely be able to feel the warmth in his cheeks even if it were covered by his hands.
“Is this what it’s going to be like? Are we going to be the poster boyfriends for the Wizarding world to see?” Draco joked after a while, finally getting back to his old self.
Any previous confusion he had turned into warmth. He was always thankful for McGonagall, and how she would sometimes feel like a parent figure to her. “Thank you, Headmistress,” he smiled.
“He sounds like an over-paranoid bastard if you ask me,” Ron snorted, unconvinced.
In the corner of his eye, he saw a pink flush wash over Draco’s pale features as well. Of all the ways for people to figure out about their relationship, it was because they both started showing up late.
Harry wrapped his lips around the exposed head of his cock, sucking on it lightly. Again, Draco’s thrusted his hips into Harry’s mouth, thankfully somewhat held down on the waist by Harry’s free hand. He took more of Draco into his mouth, running his tongue on the underside of the hardened member, using the tip to trace the protruding veins.
Surging forward for another kiss, Harry met him half way and savored the feeling of Malfoy’s pliant mouth opening to grant his tongue entrance into his own, their tongues sliding against one another as Harry’s hand snaked upwards to grab a fistful of Malfoy’s hair. He heard a soft groan emerge from the other man's throat before it clicked in his head that there was something wrong.
“Well yeah,” Harry said awkwardly, not really wanting to expose what he and Draco do in their private time in the safety of their own home, a renovated Grimmauld Place. Both of them have developed some kind of routine where Wednesday evenings were just their night and tonight, Draco wanted to watch a Muggle film and eat popcorn.
“Hi,” Draco grinned, practically nuzzling Harry’s hand. Really, there was no better thing Harry could think of than seeing Draco in this soft, vulnerable state. Especially when he was smiling so brightly at him.
He wouldn’t put it past Draco to use almost illegal spells, or at least ancient and obscure spells that people have forgotten about.
he brought Draco coffee. In fact, he even bought him his favorite chocolate croissants from the little cafe near his flat; not that Draco needed to know that.
“For what it’s worth, though,” Bill said, nudging him as he stood up. “Nobody is that committed unless there’s another reason.”
“They look a bit awkward, don’t they?” Hermione pointed out, raising an eyebrow when she turned back to look at them.
“Alright, Ronald,” she sighed dramatically, lips quirked upwards. “Now take a seat so we can start.”
“What are you doing?” he asked frantically. “Why are you packing, you live here.”
“No,” he scoffed. “I’m not exactly dying to see you every second of the day,” He smiled wryly.
They’ve been repairing a school, for Merlin’s sake.
“Totally unrelated, but okay,” Harry complied, spelling his hair back to its original dark colour then proceed to turn his Santa costume into a formal set of Wizarding robes.
“That’s amazing, love.” Harry said, pulling his boyfriend down onto the space on the couch next to him. “Thank you,” he said, giving him a long but chaste kiss.
“Oh, I didn’t see them when I was looking for a spare carriage.” And thank Merlin he didn’t, Harry thought smugly.
____________________________
Like always, Draco was turned on his side while pressed against Harry’s front, an arm wrapped around his waist and a leg thrown over both of his own.
“Harry,” Draco whispered, his warm breath fanning against Harry’s face.
--------------------------------------------------
“Oh that!” Arthur exclaimed. “We rolled over a glass bottle.”
“You boys are adorable,” she gave him a small smile. “Now, I have to check on Seamus and Dean in the Great Hall.”
Harry then wondered since when he and Hermione were on a first-name basis, assuming that they had only met that very day.
Draco glared at him, and proceeded to keep glaring at him until he was nearly out of the doorway. The effect of the glare was somewhat dampened by the fact that Draco still looked ruffled with his mussed, blond hair and pinkness on his cheek from where he rested it.
Harry belatedly realized that when they began rebuilding, Draco was normally assigned to work with a teacher at first- most of the time that teacher being Professor Flitwick or the Headmistress herself- and helped with a lot of the charm work, such as the one in the Great Hall. He and Hermione worked together often in that aspect because they were both pretty brilliant at theories, and they were successful.
A silicone based lube.
--------------------------------------------------
Draco snorted before sulking his way to the office, his previous drowsiness catching up to him.
“I’m just giving you the space to pack your things,” Harry responded quietly, unable to look into those piercing gray eyes again.
Harry felt his heart shatter all over again. A game. That’s what he said when he suggested moving in together, and that’s all this will ever be to him.
“Mister Potter,” McGonagall greeted him as the 8th Year students got ready to leave. They had all planned on leaving together, bar Draco and Neville because they wanted to get some things ready before everyone arrived. Harry tried not to think too much on it and focus on his former teacher instead.
“What?” Malfoy asked eventually.
Thick ropes of come coated both their bodies messily, Harry’s hand moving over his cock until it had softened, becoming sensitive under his hold.
Of course, it didn’t really matter to the 8th Year students since all NEWTs students were in the same class as long as they took it. The only real reason the sorting mattered, aside from tradition, is because they will be taking part in the house-point system, and they’re only given access to the common room of the house they’re assigned, and possibly the house of their guides. Also, it makes it easier to form groups or partners in class depending on what the teacher wants.
“I saw some students lounging out by the Great Lake,” Ron said as they exited their final class for the day. “Which means that the tours are probably done. We should go find Hermione.”
“Fine,” Harry raised his hands defensively. “I’m just saying that- all things considered- you could be very wrong.”
“Of course not,” Sofia managed to sputter out before forcing herself to calm down. “Draco, going after your
He leaned down and pressed his mouth against his perineum, lips slightly parted. His breath ghosted against the sensitive skin before he gave it tentative licks.
“Whatever, you do what you like,” Ron rolled his eyes before getting up. “But I’m not going to force myself to be around him  just because you and ‘Mione are.”
“Yeah,” Ron replied, nodding. “Actually, we were hoping you could help out. Since you know Malfoy the best, we were hoping you could distract him until Neville’s plan is ready since he’s practically inseparable from the other Slytherins.”
Somewhere above him, he heard Harry chuckle, making his cheeks redden in embarrassment. He was doing so well, dammit. Now Harry probably thinks he’s an idiot and he’s laughing at him.
“First of all, this shouldn’t even be something we’re discussing,” Draco hissed, his face reddening further. He was thankful that it wouldn’t be evident through the flames, or else he’d really never hear the end of it from her once the whole issue was over.
“Hey, I’m Shawn,” He introduced himself. Draco looked lost on how to continue. “You’re Harry Potter, aren’t you? You’re a legend!”
But more importantly, Harry didn’t trip. So it was all good because his husband won’t kill him.
“Well,” Harry shrugged, biting back a smirk. “They said it was a prototype and they wanted me to test it out. It only has a minor problem of taking down what others say when they talk too loud as well, though.”
Of course he's head news of these things, but he never actually imagined what it might feel like until that moment. “Haven’t you ever reported them?”
“I think I’m starting to regret it already,” Harry said faintly, keeping his eyes focused on the ceiling above them. He felt the bed dip as Draco moved to adjust himself.
“I know,” he mumbled, curling his knees to his chest. “Neville said he was working on his date with Draco.”
Harry’s conversation with Bill suddenly flashed through his head. He was right. If he said yes, he’d be committed to Draco and he’d be stuck playing this stupid game forever.He couldn’t handle that. It hurts too much.
“It’s no problem,” Harry said as nonchalantly as possible, wanting Draco to just look at him instead. “You’re doing most of the work, anyway. What with the planning and all.”
if you want to check it out <3
Much to the delight of Harry, Draco was pretty good at tutoring him as well. When he gave up because of Harry’s cluelessness, he’d practically do all the work for him, to Hermione’s disapproval and Ron’s envy.
Harry shook his head and kissed him on the cheek. It was private moments like this that he loved, where even if there was nobody present, they still acted like a real couple. Like for a moment, Harry could pretend it wasn’t just for a game and Draco really was his.
“I guess you’re not Ginerva Weasley, Chaser of the Holyhead Harpies.”
“Oh yes, what an enormous difference,” Draco said dryly.
As if hearing him over the blaring music, Harry’s eyes shifted to his slightly hysterical boyfriend who was on the verge of falling to the ground because of his laughter.
“Aw c’mon mate, just bring him. It’s not like we aren’t friends with him,” Neville said, coming in. “It’s Gin’s birthday, you don’t wanna miss that.”
“Why would I do that?” Harry asked. “Wouldn’t it be better for me to just end it if I can’t. I don’t want to end any possible chance of friendship after.”
“Oh sweet Circe, look at him!” she practically swooned, and her friend nodded in agreement, both staring dreamily at the blond that was seated in front under the Sorting Hat.
“You bastard,” Draco rolled his eyes and swatted Harry’s hand away, but he could see Draco’s lips form a slight smile. Suddenly, he got a mischievous glint in his eyes and shoved his fingers in Harry’s hair before yanking his hand back harshly.
His two best friends’ eyes also turned to where Draco and Parkinson were seated, along with the other friend from Beauxbatons.
“They’re quite hard to obtain but Draco was able to reach out to an old family friend to get some for us,” Neville grinned, placing a hand on Draco’s shoulder while the blond simply turned his head and grinned back at his friend. “Now we could grow more here and multiply them.”
Draco glared at Harry before yanking the blanket from his hand. “You can try it, Potter.”
“Thanks,” Harry let out a breath he had unconsciously been holding. “And honestly, I feel like we can trust Draco. You should at least give him a chance.”
“Then I take it that you are Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger?” the blond’s eyes shifted over to where his two best friends were seated, watching the strange interaction take place. They both nodded in confirmation, both weary and confused because they didn’t know what he wanted.
His eyelashes were pressed against his high cheekbones, pale blond hair framing his face like a halo while his soft, pink lips rested in a small pout. Harry felt his heart stop and his cheeks heat up, momentarily debating the pros and cons of letting Draco sleep a bit longer.
Draco was pretty sure he was already enjoying this, but took a deep, steadying breath anyway, letting his eyelids flutter shut as he enjoyed the way Harry played with his nipples.
He just rather enjoyed the way Draco stumbled about every morning when he couldn’t be bothered to open his eyes completely or would slur his words when he just woke up, and that-
No, Draco was faster. The bedroom door swung open, and it was only a matter of time until he was spun around as well.
“I believe that she can speak for herself,” Draco said, raising an eyebrow at Ron before glancing at Davis, who just watched the exchange quietly. Once he realized that she didn’t want to interfere on the conversation, however, he continued speaking. “And regarding the founder, I must admit that you can hardly blame him, although it seems that whatever had transpired during the passing of his message to those in his house had become murky over the years.”
However, because he kept gagging, his throat began to convulse around Harry’s cock, making it harder for him to continue. Tears welled up in his eyes and he began gagging, thankfully not audibly, making him pull off to catch his breath.
“Grab a vinyl and put something on while I get Kreacher to make us more drinks, would you?” Harry asked, immediately feeling a bit awkward and letting go of his hands. Draco straightened himself up instantly, giving a quick nod and quickly walking back into the living room.
“And you clearly need more,” Harry argued, raising an eyebrow at him.
A simultaneously pleasant and embarrassed warmth spread through him as he recalled the memory; the way Draco seemed to fluster a bit at the distance of their faces. Maybe his mind was beginning to play tricks on him, but he was pretty sure that he’d gotten his partner to blush once or twice when they were just hanging around in the office the other day.
“I didn’t grab it. It’s hardly my fault you don’t know what a brush is,” Draco smirked.
“Oh gods,” Draco groaned. “I’m getting close.”
“Ladies, ladies,” Seamus interrupted, striding over to where the loud whispering was coming from like he owned the place. “We can all hear you,” he announced.
Draco had scolded him while they were fixing up the charms classroom. They had already organized the chairs and whatnot and were now working on the items used in class as well as the books, with Harry organizing the bookshelf.
“Yes, pazzaz.”
“I hate you,” Draco muttered, his eyelids fluttering shut. He could feel himself begin to feel drowsy as his head lolled into Harry’s chest.
“I suppose I best make the most of it then,” Draco sighed dramatically, closing his eyes once again.
“Brilliant!” Because any plan that involved more studying, and getting others to study, was a great idea in Hermione’s eyes. “Do you think I can get them to keep going even after the plan?”
“If the school hasn’t worked towards reforming those notions and providing proper solutions to guide their students to critical thinking, then it sounds more like an institutional problem, no?” Draco asked, still looking unaffected by Ron’s harsh accusations. For someone who wasn’t even sorted into the house, he defended it quite vehemently.
“You’re fault,” Draco grumbled almost incomprehensibly. He pulled the blanket over his head again and tried to fall back asleep. Business as per usual, Harry rolled his eyes.
“Potter, I’ve seen you dance at the Christmas Gala. Trust me, I wouldn’t be able to tell the difference between you and your 4th year self if you waltzed side by side.” Draco teased, moving down a bit more and leaning his head back to tuck it under Harry’s chin.
Not more than a few hours later, he heard the laughter of Arthur and Draco making their way back into the Burrow. At least they sounded like they were having fun, but Harry wasn’t expecting them to come back until someone called for dinner.
“Oh really?” He could practically hear the smirk in his date’s voice. “That’s well, I suppose, It’s not like everyone gets to say their boyfriend got rid of a crazy murderer.”
“Well,” Zabini drawled beside them, getting up before extending a hand to help Davis stand, who took it gratefully. “That was interesting. Your girlfriend truly is something.”
That much was evident by the time dinner came around. Harry arrived at the Gryffindor table and took a seat beside Neville, who was happily chatting with Sofia, their new housemate. Ron took a seat beside him, glaring at everything as he did so.
“Harry likes Malfoy?!” Seamus shouted from the other side of the room before promptly receiving a smack to the head from Dean.
“Thanks, Malfoy,” Ron beamed. He, out of all of them, took the longest to accept their friendships with the man, but once Malfoy realized the easiest way to reach him was Quidditch and food, it was smooth sailing from there.
he rationalized.
“So, what, he’s monopolizing Hermione and trying to get her into his bed? She has a bloody boyfriend.” Ron looked positively outraged at this point, as if he were just a second away from standing up right there and now.
He reached back and breached his entrance with one finger, wincing a bit at the pain that came with the sudden intrusion. Gritting his teeth, he rested his head against the tiles before slowly sliding his finger deeper, thrusting into himself as he forced himself to relax.
“Of course I do,” Harry said, giving him a heated look as his eyes roamed Draco’s barely-covered body. Draco’s face was burning now, but he forced himself to focus on their conversation. “But I don’t want to force you if you aren’t ready.”
When he came back from the kitchen, Neville was gone. Probably going around to be a good host. This would have been great, if it weren’t for the fact that Pansy Parkinson now occupied the seat that Neville had evacuated.
“Don’t worry, I don’t think Potter would be able to hold out,” Malfoy smirked, side-eyeing Harry who, in response, raised his eyebrow in challenge and grabbed Malfoy’s hand.
“Don’t be silly,” Hermione chuckled, taking a seat next to him. He wasn’t joking, but he wouldn’t correct her. “Draco doesn’t seem to be the type to do that.”
“Hey!” he laughed, catching it just in time. When he put it down, he realized that Draco was already falling back asleep. “What, am I supposed to hit you until you wake up?”
"Of course I do," Malfoy snorted. "Who else would I go to? Other than the few friends I've made who work in the same area as me. And they check on me often enough, at least, to make sure I'll be paying my part of the rent."
Still unable to rid himself of his blush, Draco nodded meekly, allowing Harry to place a sweet kiss against his lips. Once he got his body to relax, Harry began rubbing circles around his entrance, pressing against the tight ring of his hole before rubbing the pad of his finger over it.
good plan.”
“Oh great,” Ron scoffed from his seat beside Harry. “He’s already corrupted her. Has she forgotten everything they’ve done to us in the past years already?”
but we were fine since there was nothing around us.”
“You earned yourself an extra half-hour, now get up,” Harry sighed. Since it was clear that Draco had no intentions of moving, he grasped his pale arm firmly and attempted to pull him out of bed, only to be fought with, admittedly weak, resistance.
“But must I remind you that partners in the Aurors should differ from partners in… other matters?”
“Draco,” Harry greeted with a smile, falling into step with the other man’s hurried pace.
“Sorry, mate!” Michael Corner waved in his direction. “Mind tossing it back over, though.”
“What I mean is,” Harry placed a quick peck against Malfoy’s glistening lips. At least that small action loosened his frown a bit. “let me take you out properly, yeah?”
“If that’s all…” Draco said tentatively, shifting on the balls of his feet.
That was enough to tear his attention away from the remaining 8th Year exchange students that were waiting to be sorted and instead focus on this new person who will be joining them for most of their classes now. Once her house was announced, a Gryffindor pin appeared on her uniform beside the Beauxbatons school logo.
“Most don’t bother,” Draco shrugged, kneeling at the foot of what Harry presumed was his own bed and opening his trunk to rummage through it. “You can take a seat, it might take me a while to find it since I lost a book yesterday and kinda threw everything around.
“Did you know that your prostate is as big as a snitch?” Harry informed him, making Draco confused. He was pretty sure that this conversation could wait until the morning, but he decided to indulge his boyfriend.
It was apparent straight away that she cared a fair amount for the bloke, and insulting him was not the way to go. “No wonder she’d rather hang out with him. If you’re fragile masculine ego thinks it’s because he wants her, then I think you should re-evaluate yourself.”
Without waiting for a response, he pulled himself back up until they were face-to-face, his expression mischievous. He inched his face closer, making it appear as though he was leaning in for a kiss, before turning his head at the last second, brushing his lips against the shell of Draco’s ear.
Harry stripped off his shirt before stepping in, tilting his head carefully to make sure he didn’t wet his jeans before placing a towel over his shoulders before walking out.
Sometimes a student would wave or, on one occasion, a teacher would invite them into the classroom for a few minutes and give an introduction of the class and the lesson that was being taught.
Without saying another word, Harry pulled him in for another kiss, this one more gentle than the first. Tentatively, Harry held Draco’s hands, which were still clutching the blanket that covered his body, and pulled them away, allowing the duvet to slide off him slowly.
Happy Holidays <333
“Why?” Harry asked eventually. Would Draco really be this committed to playing a game, one that’s practically run its course since they’ve started three years ago?
Still frustrating all the same.
He already Floo called  Ron and Hemrione to update them on everything that happened and ask if he could stay there until Draco was finished. They were both worried about him, as expected, with Hermione’s light chiding and lecturing that she always warned him it was a bad idea.
“Why are you going up? I figured you’d be assigned to keep an eye on the Dungeons for Slytherins and Hufflepuffs,” Harry asked curiously.
“That’s not the point!” Ron exploded once they were in the hallway. “We were tortured in his bloody house! His father is a
Affection visibly washed over Harry’s features before he wrapped his arms around Draco’ pulling him closer.
“Right,” Draco said, clearing his throat. His cheeks were an appealing shade of pink, though for what reason, Harry didn’t know. “Take a seat so I can massage it in, and remember to pay attention so you can do it on your own.”
“Okay, love,” Draco eventually sighed, giving in to his partners antics. He gave Harry a quick peck on the lips, causing his ace to split into a wide, satisfied grin.
“If he hurts you, though, I will not hesitate to cut off his bollocks and spoon feed them to him,” she warned threateningly.
“Weasley, kindly refrain from polluting my garden with your gas and strange odours,” Draco said sternly without looking up from the seating plan. “We don’t have enough time to order a new batch of flowers, much more in this quantity or those hideous colors our darling groom has chosen.”
“Son of a Death Eater and he heads straight to Slytherin,” Ron scoffed, gathering more food onto his plate.
“‘How long is this song,” Draco groaned softly, dropping his head on Harry’s chest. “On the bright side, other people have joined us now.”
Harry gave in with a sigh, sliding next to the man while also making sure that there was enough space between them so they were at a respectable distance.
“He looks like a bloody ferret, alright?” Ron said, rolling his eyes. “Now what’s the deal? I thought we were going to avoid him and Hermione?”
Unfortunately, the new Transfiguration teacher arrived at that moment, putting all conversations that filled the room to a close. But by some miracle, Harry was able to sit next to Draco in all their shared classes that day so all in all, it was a good day.
Still, no response. Finally, he gave into his urges and began bouncing on the bed, listening to the sheets rustle underneath him every time he landed.
“Fine,” Draco gave in, handing him the handle of one of his bags and using his free arm to hold onto Harry’s.
Hermione and Draco had gotten on surprisingly well, but Hermione and Ron were one of the few who took much longer to warm up to him. Ron still calls him ‘Malfoy,’ until now, but they’ve become relatively civil at least. Hermione, on the other hand, is glad to finally have someone who can keep up with her rants, arguments, and academic quests and Draco, who probably feels that he owes a lot more to her, is always willing to indulge her.
“That’s just Draco,” the petite French girl just said confusedly. “Girls always like Draco.”
“Merlin, I can already see her brain forming plans to fit this in with our NEWTs revisions,” Ron sighed.  Then, he turned his pleading eyes towards her. “You’ll still help us, right, love?”
“I told you I did it!” Ron exclaimed, running down the stairs with a  parchment in hand, raised above his head and flapping in the air. “My Transfiguration essay, m’lady.”
Snape was… questionable. Morally gray, not necessarily good. He shifted uneasily in his seat. Maybe Hermione had a point, but he wanted to make his own judgement, so he decided that maybe it would be best to observe for himself for now.
before mustering up a grin and agreeing. “Brilliant! You can keep wearing what you’re wearing. I like seeing you wear my clothes,” and he did. Something about seeing Draco wear Harry’s clothes like he was his just did something for him.
“I can try,” he shrugged. It didn’t work out too well last time because it took down a bunch of gossip some Hufflepuff was sprouting from beside them, messing up the notes. “No promises though.”
He could feel Harry pressing against the different areas inside him, seemingly exploring his body both inside and out, while scissoring his fingers gently, making sure to avoid doing too much too fast so Draco doesn’t get hurt. Suddenly, he felt a shock wave of pleasure shoot up from the base of his spine.
When those bright, gray eyes met his own green ones, he felt himself pause once again. Draco just looked so unkempt and… soft. Some strands of his blond hair were sticking out at odd angles and there were pillow marks on his cheek, eyes half open as he lifted himself onto one of his elbows.
“Oh my god,” Harry coughed, choking on his own spit.
He barely heard Draco chant
“Yes?” Draco asked, biting back another smile, silently urging him to continue.
Realizing that what he said was not much better than his original train of thought, his face flushed and he looked down, suddenly very interested in the heart-shaped marshmallows in his drink.
Once he saw Draco enter the bathroom, he was satisfied and allowed himself to stop supervising so he could go heat up their breakfast. He rather hoped that Draco wouldn’t take too long, because he wanted to eat with him before they left for the office.
And suddenly, he tried not to think of what it would imply for him to take the ride alone with Draco.
“How silly,” Draco hummed, which made Harry’s heart drop slightly and loosen his grip on Draco’s hand. “Wh-If we got together, they’d know immediately.”
“Yeah?” Draco asked, looking like he was on the verge of bursting out into laughter. “Alright then, but I do feel the need to point out that you didn’t exactly say anything against me.”
“Look, Draco is a good guy, and I can say that there are many people in his life who wouldn’t be pleased to hear you say things like that, starting with me,” she said, her voice still hard but no longer angry. “He has loyal friends, and I think it would be better if you got to know him yourself instead of creating assumptions based on who his family is.”
“Head stuck in a fence, eh?” He raised his eyebrow. “You know what else gets caught in fences often? Deers.”
“I’m so not ready for our NEWTs,” Dean groaned. “Do you think I can just wing my way through it?”
“Mister Potter,” Narcissa Malfoy greeted him, along with a stern nod from Lucious before he looked away with a slight tilt in his nose.
Somehow, hearing her insights on the situation was both helpful and not at the same time. She was right when she said that in the end, Draco would be the one who either rejects them or not, and Harry felt like he had a decent shot with him if he was basing this off the party, but at the same time he wasn’t sure about his chances when he and Neville have grown so close.
“Hey, Harry. Draco,” Neville greeted. His blond head turned to greet them and gave them a smile and began talking with them as he brought out a quill and a notebook to take notes in class.
Not more than 5 minutes later, the train had finally left the station. Ron and Neville were engrossed in talking about Quidditch, even though Neville wasn’t the biggest fan of the game. Harry suspected he was doing it for the sake of being a good friend. At least that left him to his own thoughts, first about Draco and then how that school year might go, while Hermione created a list of things to discuss during the Prefects meeting before Hogwarts.
The only thing left to check was the bedroom. The fact that he was invading one of Draco’s most private places was enough to make him hesitate once he stood outside the closed door, hands raised halfway before he could knock.
Of course, Harry noticed how it was much harder on Malfoy, all things considered, but he’s been actively doing his best to prove himself to others and make up for everything he’s done. He even offered to officialize and sponsor Hermione’s causes, something that helped her warm up to him, albeit she was skeptical at first.
"You really brought me here to help deal with the kids, didn't you?" Harry teased while searching one of the bushes. Found one.
“Alright, children,” Draco chided with a grin playing on his lips. “Stop picking on Harry.” This prompted his husband to stick out his tongue at the three youths, before Draco added, “it’s not nice to gang up on large children.”
“Fine,” Draco said dramatically, rolling away from Harry’s embrace. Almost unwillingly, Harry threw the blanket off of them, exposing them to the cold air. He suppressed a shudder at the sudden chill before forcing himself to get up.
——————————————
“Okay, no. That’s a terrible idea, and here’s why,” Harry laughed. “Robards is going to kill us.”
“Oh please,” Draco scoffed, rolling his eyes. “Like I could ever be embarrassed by being with you.”
“Since we’re all here, shall we start with the Easter Egg hunt?” Narcissa clapped her hands and the children started buzzing. They stood up one by one and were led to the garden, Harry and Draco following at the very end.
“Oh haha, you enormous prat,” Harry rolled his eyes, trying to hold back a laugh. “I’m not that bad.”
“I’m sure it will be fine, Ron,” Harry rolled his eyes.
“As much as I love our school,” Harry began in a soft voice. “What could they want to gain from coming here? I’m sure there would be more of a cultural exchange if they went to the schools in America.”
“Bite me, you wench.” The pout on his lips was back, and it took everything in Harry to tear his eyes away. Malfoy had been the loudest and most talkative of the group when it came to guessing and, being the talent that he is, still managed to get most of his guesses wrong.
“Jealous?” Ron asked, and Harry knew he was joking but he was right; he was a tad jealous. Before Harry could respond, Ron quickly remembered something. “Oh wait, I left my essay somewhere in my trunk. Tell Hermione to give me a second.”
“And thank Merlin we did,” Lily said, but she was at least smiling with heavy amusement in her eyes.
“It pays high and I make enough to graduate on time while buying everything I need,” Malfoy shrugged. “I was just lucky to find people who could guide me around this whole thing.”
“I am not that hopeless,” Harry groaned, flicking his wand to set another brick in place.
“Pansy, what the hell am I supposed to do?” Draco groaned, both from distress and the fact that his knees were starting to hurt from kneeling in front of the fireplace.
“He’s off-duty. They cannot have him work during a party he’s not on shift for,” Draco rambled. “What on Earth could they-”
Thankfully, he was clothed; Harry checked.
“Surrounding yourselves with Slytherins, Hermione?” Ron asked, not even bothering to disguise his tone even though everyone in their small circle could hear them. Harry remained silent.
He ended up lounging around in the common room with a book after dinner, trying to catch up on one of his missed homeworks when he heard Ron and Hermione arguing nearby. He hadn’t even heard when the bushy-haired girl came in, so he sat up immediately to see if he should intervene.
, he added silently. Why was it always their dinner on the line when Draco came home with new Muggle things.
——————————————
“Draco?” Harry asked worriedly, pulling out. He sat up straight, pulling his legs out from underneath Draco before leaning against the headboard, prompting Draco to sit up as well.
“Alright,” Neville said, nodding. “I’m going to meet Draco after his class ends and… tell him about our change of plans.”
“In case you’ve forgotten once again, we were both invited,” Draco replied, smirking slightly.
His housemates gave him a quick acknowledgement before turning back to their conversation.
“I really can’t stay.”
He did jazz hands. Why did he do
“I bought us cable!” He exclaimed, much to Harry’s pleasant surprise. He had been meaning to subscribe to a cable company after buying their telly. He just never got around to doing it. “I know you’ve been wanting to do it for some time now. At least now that contraption of yours will be put to use.”
“It’s alright,” Harry grinned, resting his chin on top of Draco’s hip, making it tingle slightly. Suddenly, a devious glint passed through Harry’s expression before he began placing soft kisses over the skin over and over again, making sure that it tickled Draco.
Ron seemed to share his thought process, having elbowed him lightly. They shared a glance for a second before turning back to their breakfast.
“Oh ha ha,” Harry rolled his eyes, still unable to wipe the grin off his face. “Very cute.”
This seemed to finally get Harry moving. He pulled out his fingers, leaving Draco to feel empty, his hole clenching around nothing while Harry poured more lube on his hand to slather on his hardened cock. He sat back again so that he could align himself properly against Draco’s hole, entranced by the sight of his flushed cock against Draco’s clenching arse.
“Muggles call it stationary!” The excitable blond explained, opening his bag and showing off their not-dinner. “Isn’t it brilliant?”
“And finally, there will be a sorting that will take place after they arrive,” the chatter grew even louder this time, causing the Headmistress to finally cast a sonorous charm. “For those who have volunteered to serve as guides, do not worry. They might not necessarily be sorted into your house, as the results of the sorting may be unpredictable and unbalanced, so I will be providing you and your partners with charmed notebooks so you can communicate and reach one another from the different areas of the castle.”
Ron let out a groan. “I know,” he grunted. “Not talking until our NEWTs doesn’t exactly scream healthy relationship, does it.”
“Draco,” Harry said softly. “It doesn’t matter to me if you’ve never been with anyone before. I just didn’t expect it, is all.”
“Why are you being odd?” Draco asked him. Harry flushed again, regretting letting himself be so transparent.
“You’d be here,” Draco said, rolling over onto his back before giving Harry a - devastating, if he may say so himself - smirk. “I’m sure we could think of something to do.”
“No objection from me,” Harry smiled, but he knew Draco wouldn’t leave. Besides the fact that it was simply too ‘improper’ for them to do, they decided to have the first dance once everyone receives their food. Why they decided to wait so long, he had no idea.
It sounded quite strange, wanting to separate him from the rest of the group, but maybe it’s because they might slip and tell each other everything. Harry thought that Neville would prefer having their help in this, but apparently not so much.
“I would just like to go over my final reminders so that you can leave in time for your first periods,” she sighed, sounding a bit weary, but also somewhat excited. The hall was absolutely buzzing, as it seems many of the students were excited for this exchange as well. “Their carriage will remain on school grounds to serve as their housing. Please do not try to get in unless explicitly given permission by one of the students with the knowledge of their designated teachers.”
“Circumstances change,” he replied, giving a slight shrug. “I’m going with you now, aren’t I?”
“Sorry to shit on your Savior Morals, Potter, but the law doesn’t exactly care about whores like me,” Malfoy spat spitefully, glaring at the ground as he spoke.
“Yeah,” Hermione nodded.”But it’s nice, I guess. I’ll probably ask him why soon.”
Apparently their next subject was Ancient Runes, which Harry did not take. This meant that he would most likely end up alone, unless he manages to find one of his other friends while wandering aimlessly until he reaches the common room and settles on self-forced seclusion until further notice.
“And where exactly did it explode?” He asked, trying to keep his calm. He was pretty sure he was on the verge of ripping out his hair.
“What?” Maybe he was confused, because Harry sure as hell was.
“Are you alright?” he heard a soft voice ask him. On his left appeared Draco Malfoy, who he didn’t realize had been standing there. Merlin, how long had he been there?
Harry took comfort in the fact that if Draco wasn’t sitting with him, at least he wasn’t with Neville either. Now neither of them could hog Draco.
“You poor baby,” Hermione cooed sarcastically, although Harry could tell she was holding back a laugh and continued scowling into his pillow. “Whipped for Draco and now he doesn’t know what to do with himself.”
“Why would I need a reason to have a disco ball?” Draco huffed, plopping himself down on one of the seats. Neville rolled his eyes and swished his wand. Not a few moments after, a bunch of snacks came floating onto the table in the drawing room and music began thumping through the walls.
“You’re right; you don’t,” he said, pulling Draco along to the floo whilst simultaneously trying not to focus too hard on the warmth that bloomed where their skin touched. “And don’t think that your spells are going to hold me off for long.”
“C’mon, I’m almost finished,” Harry whispered, pulling him to the front of the stage. Draco supposed he should’ve been thankful he wasn’t dragged onto the stage instead, happy to have the attention off him and back on Harry and the elves that accompanied him.
There were tables cleared in the front of the Great Hall, a designated space for the new students to eat in. While McGonagall made a quick mention of the fact that they didn’t have to eat there, but rather had the option to mingle amongst the Hogwarts students, most seemed to prefer sitting together at the front tonight.
Despite it not being what he asked for and being slightly exasperated, Harry couldn’t hold back his smile at Draco’s excitement over simple muggle things. He was, after all, the one who insisted he try some as well when trying to get him to agree to the telly despite all the hassle of making muggle technology work in a wizarding house.
“Well, yeah,” Harry said with a small shrug. “You don’t seem to be up for it now, but it does give us some time to talk about this better.”
Harry conceded a point to his red-headed friend.
“Their leaves are used in laughing potions, which causes hysterical and uncontrollable laughter,” Draco explained, and Harry listened intently. “If you eat their leaves alone, that can also trigger it but it would be much more potent.”
Instead, he forced his head to face forward and keep walking at a steady pace, careful to make sure that he didn’t stare too long at anyone that he passed by as he did so.
“Mate, you look like you’ve just seen Voldemort again. What happened?”
“Why is there a huge tear?” He asked, unsure if he really wanted to hear the answer. He hoped to Merlin that it was maybe a sharp rock that was lying around the area.
They sat back down on the bed with Harry positioned at the end while Draco sat on his knees behind him. He summoned a full-length mirror that was placed by his bed-side so that Harry could see what he was doing.
“But you won’t find a way to make me quit and insist on finding me a job in the wizarding community?” Malfoy clarified.
“I love you.”
“How can I not stress?’ He groaned, leaning a bit more into Harry’s arms. “The wedding is tomorrow and I’ve completely forgotten to teach you how to dance.”
He sounded slightly disappointed, and Hermione smiled at him apologetically, shifting closer so that they were seated shoulder-to-shoulder. “I’m still going to make time for other things. I promised myself that I’d give more time to just enjoying the school year since it will be our last.”
“It’s just a short chat,” He insisted, still trying to get a chance to speak to his
Draco took a deep breath, trying to recollect his thoughts. “Okay,” he said, releasing a breath.
,” Harry snorted. “I mean, they might need to be a swot to keep up with her, especially if they’re going to be taking their NEWTs this year as well.”
“Why are you even mad at him in the first place?” she inquired instead.
“Hey, er,” Harry mumbled awkwardly, gathering his things. “I’m going to start with that plan of yours. So, goodbye.”
“Uh..” Both Draco and Hermione gave him a funny look, and he realized that now that they’re friends, they’re going to make one hell of a duo. He was already dreading any possible study sessions those two might try to hold for their NEWTs. “Everything?”
“He has a point, ‘Mione,” Harry said, shrugging.
Harry immediately sank down on the stool Draco had transfigured, the blond moving around him until he was situated at his back. “It’s going to feel cold,” he warned.
“Don’t-” Draco started, but stopped himself.
“Alright, I promise,” Draco swore, fiddling his fingers.
“Yes, I must,” Harry replied, doing his best to hold in his laughter. For what, nobody knew. “It’s to remind you all of what you’ve been missing ever since you all moved out.”
catching himself on his feet at the last second so that he wouldn’t faceplant on the ground. For someone so sluggish in the morning, he was surprisingly agile.
“I was only kidding,” Draco snorted, amusement filling his voice.
“Oh, Merlin, no,” Draco whispered faintly, but it was drowned out by the whoopings of Harry’s friends and colleagues, along with everyone else present at that party.
Harry suppressed a shudder and leaned into him as well, this time facing him. “I don't know, Draco, I’m feeling pretty confident,” and he was, especially after seeing his grey eyes widen a fraction at the use of his first name.
“You’re terrible,” Draco scoffed while rolling his eyes, but the small smile on his lips gave it away. “Besides, if I don’t go, Blaise is probably going to hunt me down, worried out of his mind that maybe I died because I never miss these things.”
“The only time I’ve driven a car was when we hijacked my dad’s back when we were at Hogwarts, though.”
“Of course it is!” Harry exclaimed, pulling his arm away and feigning an affronted look. “It’s all about the pazazz.”
“My mother sent me away, I’m afraid,” Malfoy’s voice hardened just a fraction, and Harry noticed the way his shoulders tensed. “Look, I just came to apologize on his behalf; Merlin knows he’d never do it himself. I also wanted to assure you that I do not share his beliefs and do not hope to cause you any trouble in the months I will be staying here. I understand your distrust of me, but I would like that we could remain civil, at the very least, in the meantime.”
He wasn’t sure why, but he half-expected them to at least sit at the Gryffindor table, or even the Ravenclaw table since that’s where Draco was sorted, but instead they headed straight to the other end of the Hall where Zabini sat with Davis, pointedly ignoring them.
“You really are a savior, Potter.” He could practically
“Not too much,” Draco waved his hand off, grabbing the keys he had put down and heading to the Floo. “I’ll be back by dinner, or would you like to come with me instead?”
“Harry?” he mumbled, peeking one eye open at his boyfriend. Harry found it adorable.
“Right,” Harry said, vaguely amused. “And I don’t think you’re an idiot for not knowing these things. Sex can be complicated.”
“So dramatic,” Draco laughed.
Except, Neville was trying to make a move now and bloody hell if that didn’t make his gut twist.
Harry agreed and they both decided to check the lake since they already knew that there were students there and hoped she was among them. In hindsight, it might have been wiser to use the Mauraders Map to locate them, but Harry didn’t want to make the trip up the stairs just to come back down.
“What?”
“I said I was sorry,” Harry said, giving Draco an exaggerated pout.
“What’s one person compared to the many that came from that house,” Ron debated. “She might’ve just been unlucky to be sorted there.”
“Perhaps,” was the reply he got. “I was considering it, but I’m not sure if I’d be in the mood to, what, get all dressed up to smile painfully at those arse-kissing officials at the Ministry?” Harry barked a laugh.
he silently pleaded. After the first incident, Draco had taken it upon himself to have a cupboard filled with Muggle stationary, including ballpens, pencils, and various papers as well. Naturally, word had gone out to Arthur, who has suddenly taken it upon himself to adopt Draco every Sunday at the Burrow and hide in his shed.
“Right, like I’m going to let him hang around with us,” Ron scoffed. “He has his
“Oh,” Harry smirked, nipping at the skin of his inner thigh. “You like that, do you?”
Draco did his best to not worry so much to avoid stressing people out at the party. He and Harry had came together to the Ministry’s New Year’s Gala, but somehow he had managed to lose his boyfriend not long after it had started. He didn’t even bother to stop and listen to those arse-kissing officials try to butter him up for donations to support their campaigns. He was on a mission.
“Nothing,” Neville said quickly. “I mean, we’ve gotten closer over the summer during the rebuilding and all, but I’m not sure how to get him alone now, especially since they tend to stick to each other like glue.”
“Nice one, mate,” Ron said proudly, patting him on the back and leaving the floor so they can start dancing.
“Oh really?” Harry smiled. “Since when?”
——————————————
“Hey, Draco,” Harry said. “Isn’t it weird that we’re dating but never actually gone on a real date?” He heard the blond next to him choke on the bread he was eating. “I was thinking we head out to Hogsmead later and go on a real date, you know?”
“Any last resolutions before the New Year?” Harry asked Draco.
“But did you enjoy the show?” Harry asked cheekily, throwing an arm over Draco’s shoulders.
“A Malfoy,” Ron practically sneered, but he remained seated, for which Harry was grateful for. He didn’t think that the Headmistress would take too kindly to them fighting one of the exchange students on their first day here.
He felt the bed shift behind him, watching the blond hair peek above his own dark curls as Draco attempted to position himself higher so see what he was doing as well as be able to look over Harry’s figure, grumbling and wishing he were taller.
“You do what you want,” Ron said eventually. “But if you think I’m going anywhere near him, you’re wrong.”
Like always, it didn’t take too long before Draco joined him. Really, if it didn’t take the man so long to actually drag himself out of bed, he would have considered arriving later than he did. And, like always, Harry had brought breakfast for the two of them.
“I mean-,” Draco said helplessly, his brain scrambling to piece a decent explanation together. “What does it matter?”
Sighing resignedly to himself, he decided to go around and talk to his other classmates. It wouldn’t do for Harry to sulk by himself and not enjoy the party. Besides, he was surrounded by friends anyway, he might as well enjoy himself.
This meant that Harry would most likely not be seeing Draco for a few days, since he planned on staying with his family in France while Harry spent his time with the Weasley’s. Another wave of disappointment hit him, but he did his best not to show it and instead try to channel his energy into getting Draco to stay for a while longer.
As it turns out, the week Hermione assigned him to partner with Draco was among the last 2 weeks of rebuilding, and now they were celebrating with everyone before heading out to the party Draco and Neville had pulled together at the Longbottom Manor. Nonetheless, it was a great fucking week.
“More for me, then,” Ron shrugged and just as he did so, Dean and Seamus walked in,
Yeah, he was screwed.
“Great,” Harry chirped, not letting that fact ruin his mood. He practically bounced over and plucked the beanie off the blond’s head, causing his hair to rise and go out of place.
“Me too,” Draco replied. They pulled apart and spent a few seconds just smiling at each other, drowning out the other voices around them which had become increasingly louder as the year came to a close.
They didn’t shower together, thankfully, but Harry went first and told the other man that he was heading to breakfast ahead of him because apparently he planned on taking at least 1 hour in the bathroom.
“Harry!” he greeted, beaming a smile towards his boyfriend. Harry smiled back at him before grabbing him by the waist and pulling him towards his chest, leaning in for a kiss.
“Oh c’mon.” This time, it was Ron’s turn to snort. “It was pretty clear that you found him attractive the moment you saw him walk up to us in the Great Hall.”
Deciding that maybe honesty would do him some good in this situation, he sighed. “It just hurt a bit when you were-,” he cut himself off before feeling his face heat. “I mean, it’s normal, isn’t it? For the first time?”
Quietly, he scooted closer until he was seated by his face, the steady beating of his pulse becoming erratic. He was both more comfortable and discomfited with how at ease he felt in Draco’s personal space.
“It’s a gift and you should be proud because I did it on my own initiative without complaining,” he said smugly.
“Unhand me,” Draco demanded, writhing and flailing himself clumsily in Harry’s arms. Unfortunately for the sleep-addled Auror, Harry was physically stronger than he was - and actually fully awake, - therefore managing to pull him off the bed by force. Still, that didn’t make the task of pulling a grown man’s entire weight out of bed much easier.
“Favorite, huh?” Harry raised an eyebrow, “I’ll be sure to let her know about you, then?”
“He was probably confused,” Draco huffed. If one were to look closely, it would seem like there was a light pink sheen fighting its way onto his cheeks, but maybe Harry was overthinking and beginning to see things. “In fact, he’s probably still confused. Don’t think I’m going to let you copy my notes, Potter.”
“I know that,” Draco snapped with a weak glare. “I even watched Muggle movies and those short films on the internet.”
Draco wanted to feel pleased, except instead he felt his hands threaten to clench against where they rested on Harry’s chest, because his boyfriend had steadily trailed his hand down towards Draco’s arse, kneading the flesh there.
“Yes, but I think it would be more fun if I brought you as my date,” Harry retorted, feeling a blush creep up his neck before adding, “So we’re seated together, I mean.”
Thanks for reading! I'll try to update as often as I can. You can also receive updates from my
Harry swallowed thickly and decided that maybe he should join that mission to get shit faced as soon as possible.
“Wouldn’t you rather ask something like what his wedding theme is gonna be since there’s no way either of them have any plans of losing Gay Chicken?” He takes it back. He has no friends, he is a lone wolf. Best mate named Ron? Don’t know him. Murder just became homicide.
“So you guys will be helping him?’ Harry felt his heart sink. If his friends were rooting for Neville to ask Draco out, then he’d really look like an arse of a friend for trying to get in the way.
“Sure,” his friends looked at him with some pity, but mostly amusement. “Promise me one thing, then,” Hermoine resolved. “You’ll do something about that crush of yours when the year starts. I don’t think you’ll be able to focus on your NEWTs like this.”
"You could go to me," Harry said sincerely. "Even if it's just for the sake of having a decent place to stay while you study." He couldn't imagine a whorehouse being a comfortable place to study, considering Malfoy also said he was also a student.
“You’re thinking about asking me for sex publicly?” Draco asked dryly, his cheeks turning red at the thought of doing more of… that with Harry.
Draco was wrong, it could get quite horrible. Harry began making his way towards Draco with the sea of people parting for him as he walked. When Draco realized what was going on he tried to back away and escape, only to be stopped by their friends.
Harry was still disappointed, but he figured he could get Ron to come around eventually. For now, at least he wasn’t mad at Harry, and that would do for the meantime.
Right. Steadying himself, he picked up the pace and began stroking the hardened length in his palm, mentally willing himself to move on to the next step if he really wanted to make Harry feel good.
“No,” he groaned, resisting the urge to just rest his head against the burning logs. “I told you already, he’s had multiple relationships before. I’m pretty sure he’s slept with at least half of them!”
, Harry wasn’t jealous of Neville,
“Of course not,” Harry rolled his eyes. “But I’d rather not have both McGonagall and Hermione mad at us if he decides to leave because we were being prats for no good reason.”
“Honestly,” Draco huffed. “You’re like a dog.” That did not discourage him, however, from continuing. Instead, his touches became more gentle and soft- or rather, that’s how it felt to Harry.
Instead, he knocked the block out with his wand and it went soaring towards Anthony Goldstein, who cheered loudly after narrowly avoiding getting hit by a flying block. “Wicked! I say that should be the only way we’re allowed to remove blocks.”
“It was never just a game for me too, you pillock!” Draco raised his voice as well. “Why would I dedicate 3 whole years to a game. I’ve lost Quidditch games faster.”
“Please,” Harry scoffed. “As if Hermione would ever allow that. She’s a strong girl, after all.”
soon-to-be husband. “I just want to make sure he’s not freaking out about the decor or something.”
“I really don’t think that would be necessary,” Harry laughed. “But I’ll tell you how it goes. I still think you should give him a chance.”
He tried calling his name again, this time adding a small shake to his shoulder as he did so. Still, no answer came. Harry was beginning to feel frustrated, but he didn’t want to be rude and just outright jump on the bed to disturb him.
Hermione gave Harry one last look before grinning at her boyfriend’s antics. “You present it to me as if it’s a gift and not like I’m doing you a favor here.”
and then the car went
“No,” Harry said, giving her a light smile.
“Tell me, Weasley, have I said or done anything up to this point to make you believe that I am
Harry felt his pulse quicken, a hundred questions buzzing through his mind for possible reasons as to why he might have been searching for Harry.
“I am,” Draco confirmed. Of course he was. His persistence on taking as many classes as he can is as bad as Hermione’s. They began walking side by side together to the classroom. “I wish September 1st landed on a Friday this year,” he sighed. “Not a bloody Wednesday so we don’t have to go to class right after the feast.”
Harry nearly spat out his coffee.
Gingerly, Draco did as requested. He tried not to think too hard on the fact that this meant he was spreading himself wide open, not only for Harry to touch, but see as well. He was going to have everything exposed and on display for his boyfriend, and that was enough to remind him of his initial embarrassment.
, he was beaten by Neville. Which meant that over the weekend, Draco was busy with his brewing and during the final week, they weren’t assigned to work with one another again. Any point after that was spent with Neville in the greenhouses, and all Harry was able to do was give a passing hello when they met.
Harry knew Draco’s eyes were beautiful, but they looked much brighter in that moment, with the fireplace lit and reflect in them. They were practically sparkling as the reflection of the flames danced in them.
. She appreciated it well enough and used it on them as often as she needed to.
and left to continue the tour.
He had to admit, somehow the white hair and beard suited him, although he much preferred when Harry was stubble-free and smooth because it felt nicer to tuck his face into his neck like that.
“Fine,” Harry grumbled, trying to see if there was a way to convince Malfoy to change his mind. For now, he’ll settle. “But if you get hurt, I’m allowed to heal you.”
“Okay, no,” Draco batted his head, stepping away from him and Harry pouted. “If you get any drool on me from last night, I will spit on you.”
Harry gaped as he processed his boss’ words. “You want me to break into his house?” Harry clarified unsurely.
Harry noticed the absence of Draco’s presence next to him about 2 steps after and paused to look at him. “Go on.”
Ron, Dean, and Seamus instantly broke into wide grins and began teasing him about his crush.
"But who's making sure that you get home alright?" Harry said slowly with a small nod. "You don't have to be alone through all this, you know? You may be fine now, but who would check on you in case you weren't?"
. What the bloody hell did he mean by that. He didn’t have enough time to contemplate what he said, more so ask, because when Harry gave the skin a small suck, Draco gasped, arching his back  while his arse gave way for one of Harry’s fingers to slip in.
“Harry has a point, mate,” Seamus, one of the few remaining people in the common room joined in. “We did say until someone loses. But you can quit if you can’t handle it.”
“Be kind, Ronald,” Hermione scolded him. “He just apologized to us. It seemed genuine and we have no actual reason to dislike him because he hasn’t done anything to us. You heard what he said, that we can all at least remain civil while they’re here.”
“And miss the opportunity for me to test my new magic trick?” Malfoy asked innocently, and Harry was sorely tempted to give in.
“Ron, would you mind moving next to Harry?” Hermione asked sweetly, sending both of them warning glares which Draco couldn’t see from his position behind her. “I want to sit next to Draco so we can get to know each other better.”
“Potter, I know I was named after a constellation, but must you have used my father for this. I understand  that he was corrupt and stole many things from people, but I assure you he’s not as powerful as he seems.”
“-Yet.”
Nodding to himself, he stepped into the shower and began methodically going through his normal routine. He washed his hair thoroughly before scrubbing his body with a special soap that’s meant to help him feel softer. And once that was done, he reached towards the counter before grabbing the bottle he’d purposely set aside.
Draco nodded, looking down. Harry felt horrible, even though he didn’t really do anything. He just wanted to kiss his frown away- okay no that’s pushing it.
“Contextually, if we were to observe, Hogwarts was founded during the period where Christianity, I believe it was, had become prominent across the world,” he began, focusing his attention to her while only taking a brief second to spare a glance at everyone in the circle to see if they were listening before continuing.
“Oh, come on, Draco, of course I know what
“Zabini, Blaise!” A man Harry recognized as the guy that joined Draco at the Slytherin table went up front and took his seat. “Slytherin!”
“Ron,” Harry sighed again. How did Hermione put up with them so often? “Why don’t we at least give him a chance?”
“I have no words,” he voiced out, still frozen on his spot.
“A what?” Harry repeated blankly. “Did I hear you say ‘A Muggle Car’?” Please, for the love of Merlin, say that he misheard him.
Thankfully, they were among the throng of students that were lounging on the grass. As Harry and Ron made their way over to them, however, they realized that they weren’t alone. Beside them, they were accompanied by Draco’s friend from yesterday and his partner, another Slytherin named Tracey Davis.
“We would be fine if you would just drop the dis-” the whispering was drowned out by the flames roaring as the other students came through the Floo. “Next time, I promise.”
“You can’t stop people from using me and then leaving without paying,” Malfoy reminded him dryly, and Harry felt his gut drop. “Or those who hurt me while I’m working and let me go after. That’s how it is, even if I do stay with you.”
“If it’s a lovers quarrel, we’re still technically playing the game and winning. All couples fight eventually, totally normal. Like your average gay couple,” Draco huffed. “Follow me, Potter. We’re going to fix this mess you made.”
He got dressed slowly but finished just in time for them to make the trip to Hogwarts while being considered late, but still slightly acceptable. The Hall was already filled with students and parents who had helped out with the rebuilding, but they managed to spot their friends easily. It was hard to miss a large group of 8th Years boisterously laughing on one side of the room.
The sound of their food finishing was able to shake him out of his thoughts, so he grabbed their plates and a fork to transfer the food before hearing a
“Anything you want, love,” Harry smiled, kissing him briefly on the lips before pulling him closer and just holding him. They had a lot to make up for and deal with later, but for now they each just wanted to enjoy being close with one another and resting peacefully.
He dozed off for most of the trip and only fully awakened once they arrived at the station. First years were herded off while Harry went ahead in search of a free carriage. Hermione ran to find one of the Hufflepuff Prefects, apparently having forgotten to give them one last reminder and Ron, being the good boyfriend he is, stayed back to wait for her.
“Lovers quarrel?” Dean asked dryly from the sofa next to them, trying to shield his ears from their shouting.
“Charms,” the man on his left snorted.
He was also turned on his side, facing Harry, unaware of how close their faces were to one another.
The little bit of space allowed for more movement, so when Harry paused to change his angle, he brushed directly against Draco’s prostate.
“Er,” he said dumbly, his mind blank as he stared at Draco’s face which seemed to glow from the light that peeked into the dark room from the doorway. His eyes unconsciously roamed his body and, once he realized what he was doing, he decided to revert his attention towards thinking of a good way to wake him up.
“Nonsense, Harry,” Hermione huffed, joining the pair of them. Aside from helping rebuild, she was also in charge of scheduling and checking on everyone, which meant she could visit them often. Of course, she never stayed too long because she refuses to slack off and waste time. “They’ll try to include you into the conversation. Draco and Neville aren’t like that.”
“Oh, it was,” Harry said, giving him his second shit-eating grin of the night. “But it was mainly because I knew you’d hate it.”
“I’m afraid I don’t know what you mean,” Malfoy said, sounding equally as breathless but slightly more impatient and annoyed that Harry pulled away.
“Of course, love,” Draco gave him the biggest, most smug, smirk before turing to face the game. They remained unbothered for most of if, opting for truths instead. In Harry’s case, he just couldn’t be arsed to get out of the surprisingly comfortable position. For someone with cold hands, Malfoy was  surprisingly warm.
, Harry thought, biting back a snort. This man seated across from them might have been sorted into Ravenclaw, but he’s the type to surround himself with Slytherins. Manipulative, callous, and the tendency to use others. Resourceful. Everyone knew they were the kind that only worked for themselves.
snickered from his position in Harry’s arms. “Nothing like a big, gay, themed wedding.”
Then he began rolling it between his fingers, tugging lightly every few seconds, enjoying the way Draco mewled into his lips before squeezing them with a tug then letting the skin go.
Then, Harry switched over to the other side, leaving the spot wet and exposed to the cold air that brushed against him. It didn’t take long until his hand switched over, though, so he could repeat the same actions over his pinkened bud.
“Ohh, spill the beans later, mate,” Ron said excitedly, coming up behind them. The guests at the table, bar Lucious Malfoy, gave him a greeting. He flashed a quick smile at them before Draco asked why he looks like he ran a marathon to get to them. “Everyone’s been served. It’s time for you to dance.”
“I told you we shouldn’t have used the blanket,” Harry chuckled, his voice still rough from disuse.
you let me take you out,” he said instead.
“His mother missed him,” Hermione nodded, seeming to agree with his thoughts despite the fact that he didn’t actually voice them out. “She wanted him here while his father wanted him in Durmstrang, so Beauxbatons was the compromise since they have properties there.”
“At least one more drink?” Harry pleaded somewhat desperately, giving Draco an appealing smile. When it looked like he was about to refuse, Harry quickly broke into dramatics. “Oh, woe is me. Lonely on this cold Winter evening, alone in my wee hut while my friends forget about me and-”
“Drinks are in the kitchen, you guys help yourselves,” Neville grinned as everyone began to disperse, throwing themselves on one of the settees or making their way to the kitchen, most likely on a mission to get as shit faced as possible by the end of the night. Neville dropped himself beside Draco and said something lowly in his ear, causing Draco to lean in and, not long after, burst out into laughter.
do you know what those are? They’re just…very intimate videos.”
“Or maybe you want to hear about how I plan on having you on every surface of this house once we’re done,” Harry said, nibbling on the lobe of his ear. Because of how wide the three fingers pressed inside him, more pressure was applied to his prostate with every movement, making him shake tremble harder.
“You can’t end until one of you lose,” Dean warned them, eyes still glinting with mischief.
The wedding went smoothly, as expected, in part due to Draco’s strict planning and orders. Maybe also because of the very threatening passive-aggressive smiles he gave whenever someone nearly made a ‘serious’ mistake.
“Of course,” Harry said, trying to give her a comforting smile. He wasn’t sure of how he felt about leaving her alone with him for the rest of the day, but he knew that she could protect herself.
“Get up,” Harry told him with a small smile. “We have to get to work.”
“Jealous I’m taking your job, are you?” Harry retorted. “Maybe it’s you rubbing off on me.” That earned him a shove, although a light and playful one.
“Why didn’t we just Floo in,” Harry groaned, trudging up the long walkway to the Manor.
Harry gestured to him multiple times throughout the song, but the other guests were too distracted by the sells going off, providing them with special effects.
“Come off it, mate,” Ron joined in on her teasing. “You’ll probably be too busy staring at him to even get a word out.”
Harry tried, he really did, to not feel resentful for the interruption. He and Draco were actually getting somewhere, and he wanted to know what the blond was about to say, except Draco nodded and looked at Harry, a silent question of whether or not he was going to follow suit.
--------------------------------------------------
Classes were more unruly than normal that day. There were times wherein students who were giving tours would pass by, easily distracting the class as they stared at the Beauxbatons students who curiously peered into their classrooms.
“Sure,” Harry agreed. If Draco was helping host, then he most definitely was planning on going, and he was going to make sure it was a success no matter what.
He’d noticed that, for some strange reason, the easiest way to wake him up was taking off the blanket. He figured that it was because of the temperature shift. Merlin knows Draco always likes to keep warm, wearing layers upon layers during cold seasons until he was both comfortably warm and reasonably soft looking.Not that Harry would ever tell him. He did value his life, after all.
“Potter!” Draco yelped, the tone of his voice rising as he blinked the bleariness away. “Am I hallucinating?”
“Why are you wearing a sweater?” Harry asked. It was nearly the end of summer, but still considerably warm outside. If they had to work under the sun, there’s no doubt Draco would be sweating all over.
As he was moving his fingers, more squelching sounds filled the room, and Draco turned red at the realization that they were coming from
“Let’s go,” Harry said after a quick kiss.
“Hey, love” Harry hushed, holding Draco’s hand. “Even when we were playing, it was never just a game to me. I always loved what we had.”
“I could handle any dare you give me,” He said and Harry just knew this wouldn’t end well.
Harry looked down and saw Draco standing with his bags. A few carriages to the left, he noticed the other Slytherins looking at Draco apologetically and Parkinson giving Harry a timid wave. Harry’s long since forgiven her, but he knew that she still felt a bit awkward around him.
So here they were, rebuilding Hogwarts and trying to make it in time before the school year was set to start. The only times Harry was able to get Draco alone when they were rebuilding was when they were assigned to work on the same area. It wasn’t that he and Draco weren’t quite speaking to each other, because the times they spent together were all fun. Draco had a decent relationship with most students in their year now. It was just that Draco spent most of his free time with Neville, and when he was with other people, about 65% of the time Neville was also present. For the rest of the time, Draco was with the other Slytherins that chose to come back and help out.
, one that almost sounded like someone bumping into a wall, and turned around just in time to see Draco stumble in.
“That’s what you think!” Seamus said. “We Irish know how to live.”
“Hermione-” Ron began but was instantly cut off by the fuming girl.
“Right on, lad!” Arthur said excitedly, practically skipping down the stairs and running out with Draco to the front where Harry parked the car.
“Draco,” Pansy sighed, finally dropping the smirk. “I may not be his biggest fan, but I don’t think that Potter is the type to date just to get into your bed.”
Hopefully.
“Other… things?” Draco asked, confused. His eyebrows drew together when he looked up at Harry’ who was only smiling bemusedly at him, just the slightest hint of mischief in his eyes.
Deciding to let the topic drop, Harry continued talking about a case, although his eyes carefully tracked every one of Draco’s movements, keeping an eye out for any more signs that something was wrong. He managed to make it through dinner without shifting too often in his seat, and they both eventually settled to get ready for bed.
“I don’t think I could ever regret anything with you, Harry.” He pulled Draco a little bit closer than considered modest but who cares. They just got married.
“I thought we were giving it to the kids, though.”
“Yeah?” he murmured, trying to stay awake.
“Y-yes,” Draco struggled to gasp out when Harry began rubbing against the gland with the pads of his fingers. He felt his cock twitch against his stomach, leaking more pre-come onto himself as Harry massaged his prostate, making him shake with pleasure.
He winced a bit as he felt the skin around his hole cling onto his fingers, the area slightly burning from the stretch. In all fairness to himself, he’s never touched himself this way before, so he figured that it was likely to hurt. Still, he persevered, willing himself to relax further until it was slightly easier to thrust both fingers into himself.
“Mate, we’re friends and I’m pretty sure you weren’t chugging down hard ale when we were 11,” Dean rolled his eyes.
“Then it’s a good thing I’m the one managing your hair right now, isn’t it?” Draco retorted, still focused on the task at hand.
“It was a lovely nap,” Draco said, rolling his eyes. “And you invited Harry, so that was on you.”
Unconsciously, his hand drifted back towards Draco to carefully tuck a stray blond lock of hair behind his ear.
“That won’t be necessary, sir,” Draco forced out.
Harry heard one of his friends, he wasn’t sure who at that point, but one of them took in a sharp breath.
“Potter,” Malfoy responded, immediately pulling himself up from the wall and straightening his posture, the darkness of the alleyway hiding the redness that found its way to Malfoy's cheeks. They were both at a loss of what to say.
“Well, Ronald,” Hermione huffed, giving her boyfriend a light smile. “It’s your fault you boys stayed up so late to talk. It’s ass if you aren’t going to be seeing each other for the rest of the year!”
“Salazar’s fucking-”
“I’m simply saying that some of us are eating and don’t really need that sort of display at the table.”
Unable to help himself, he let out a snort and padded his way closer to the bed before getting down on one knee to be at eye-level with the surface.
“If you’re referring to being the Undesirable #1 wizard, then I’m afraid to inform you that none of your children are such deviants,” Scorpius laughed.
He took a deep breath and forced himself to take a step. And another, and another, and another, until he finally stood in front of Draco, who was peering up at him curiously.
“Children,” Hermione chided with a sigh. “Prefects are meeting in a few minutes and I would like to gather myself before then.”
“Don’t worry,” Ron laughed as if reading his thoughts. “I don’t think he noticed.”
(See the end of the chapter for
And it wasn’t
“I know,” Harry said quietly. “But I can’t.”
“Adorable,” Ron teased once his girlfriend was out of sight. “You could go join them, if you like. We’re almost done with this pillar and that should be it for the day.”
“I meant I wouldn't stalk someone just because I like them,” Harry narrowed his eyes at his ex best friends. “See, not creepy.”
Harry had raised his eyebrow, grinning lightly at the offended look Draco was giving him.
“A solid reason is what everyone’s been giving since he first got here,” Harry shrugged, now giving his small realization some more thought. “We don’t actually know him.”
He brought his eyes higher, only to be met once again with Draco’s silvery pair staring back at him. This time, his face was bright red, and Harry was sure it wasn’t from the cold.
“Alright, go rinse your hair off,” Draco commanded. “I’ll fetch you a clean spare towel since some of the potion dripped on the one you’re using now.”
“Huh?” Harry mumbled, snapping out of his daze. “Oh, er, yeah.”
“So…” Harry trailed off awkwardly, already planning on hitting himself later.
For all he knew, someone could be getting seriously injured. He knew that this type of work came with its risks, and he wouldn’t be able to sleep comfortable knowing that something seriously wrong might have just happened as he forced himself to walk by.
“You’re talking a lot about the founder, but you didn’t justify anything about the people that come from the house,” Ron pointed out. “It doesn’t change the fact that the people that are sorted Slytherin share their Pureblood nonsense and think they’re better than everyone, and the fact that most all dark wizards in our History have come from that house.”
“Okay, calm down, Shakespear,” Draco said, rolling his eyes while biting back a laugh. “First of all, it’s barely past lunch. And secondly, you were invited too, although I suppose I could stay for one more drink. It looks like the sky is clearing up soon, anyhow.” Harry looked out the window, and indeed it was.
“Sure, love. Sure.”
“It hadn’t escaped my notice that you and your classmates are dressed to have fun,” she raised an eyebrow at him and he found himself flushing, reasons unknown to him. It wasn’t like they were going to do anything, at least nothing that can be said based on how they were dressed. “I just wanted to say thank you, and I hope you get to enjoy this night. You, of all people, deserve it.”
Draco frowned. And upon further thought, as it seems, he frowned more before nodding with a resigned sigh. It shouldn’t be too bad, anyway. The entire Weasley clan knows about their game, but they also know that Harry has really fallen for the git. They won’t torture him.
“Look, you said that you aren’t ashamed of what you do because you chose to do this, right?” Harry clarified, waiting for the other man’s nod of approval.
(See the end of the chapter for
He started grabbing things and throwing them into a suitcase, sadly looking around. So much of the place was filled with Draco. The interiors of the house, the furniture and decor that Harry couldn’t be arsed to pick himself, the mound of products and potions in the bathroom. He couldn’t imagine what the place would look like if Draco moved out. He’d probably even reconsider redecorating the whole place because it all just felt like him.
“Can’t have that,” Harry agreed seriously. “Our backs are getting bad enough as it is, what with us aging and all.”
“Thank you, but I had a lot of help too, you know,” Harry smiled, crouching down to be at eye level with the kid.
He received a quick glare before it was quickly covered up with one of sheer delight. “Pick me up in my room after breakfast.”
Harry turned his head to look at his friends, all of them trading silent glances and conversing with one another through their eyes before finally turning back to the man who remained standing, eyes clasped behind his back.
The way his eyes shifted beneath his eyelids, making his eyelashes flutter against his cheeks, the soft sighs of pleasure when Harry brushed his thumb repeatedly over his hip, the way he leaned into Harry when they were close enough, pressing himself into the warmth between them.
“No, Draco,” he sighed, running his hand over his face. “I mean I can’t keep playing this game. It’s hurting me.”
“You know that thing you kept saying you should buy?” The blond asked, bouncing with every stride he took into the house. Well, Harry certainly didn’t ask for a bus, so there was at least that much to comfort him.
They were all seated in their respective beds, dressed to sleep but all wide awake.
Pansy decided to host her Christmas party on the 23rd, stating that there were some people who’d already have their family gatherings on the 24th, with 25 being out of the question and the 26th being for Boxing Day.
“Then shall we take this somewhere private?” Harry said lowly. A strange sense of satisfaction rushed through him when he noticed Malfoy’s cheeks flush and how he leaned just a fraction away, possibly in surprise.
“I mean, sure he turned out well enough in the end, but you can’t exactly justify all the hell he’s given us before that,” Ron snorted, but he looked somewhat more sympathetic.
“You’re good at this,” Harry mumbled, resisting the urge to groan at how good it felt.
She gave him an assessing look. For what, Harry wasn’t sure. “Right..” she said before shaking her head and giving him a bright smile. “He actually takes every class I’m in, so you’ll see each other often.”
“All volunteers please stay back once everyone leaves for their first period. You will be excused from your classes for the rest of the day while I give you further instructions regarding your responsibilities as well as what to expect,” McGonagall concluded. “That’s all, now you may leave.”
“I was actually going to ask you what classes he took,” Harry brought up casually. “Maybe I could apologize to him before class starts, if we share any.”
“A party?” Harry asked. “Like with the Professors and everything?” He felt rather skeptical about how a bunch of teenagers and alcohol would mix with having their professors around. Not well, he surmised.
“Check this out,” Dean said, standing by the area where they were playing Drunk Jenga. He held his wand and pointed it at what might have been the block he was aiming to get. It was a singular block in the middle and on the very bottom of the whole tower, keeping it up.Then, pulling back high, he swiped his wand quickly. Harry was half-expecting Dean to cast a spell to remove it.
And the feast was fun. Harry was suddenly very thankful Ron and Hermione wouldn’t let him miss this, because he definitely would have regretted it sooner or later. It lasted a while, but not too late because parents wanted to get back home, and the younger children were being scolded for bedtimes.
“I don’t know,” his boyfriend shrugged innocently. “We were just driving then we heard a
“What the hell?” Draco asked. “Of course I do! Wanna help, Harry?”
“Happy New Year.”
“No,” Malfoy shut him down, but Harry refused to let himself feel too disappointed. He knew it was coming. “I’ll- And you have no problem with what I’m doing? That I'm a whore?”
For real, this time.
And once Harry had begun to warm up to Draco’s new personality, he had established such a close friendship with Neville that those two were almost always found together now. To make matters worse, once Harry started developing his crush on Draco, it was near impossible to get him alone so Harry could get to know him for himself.
After that, he practically scoffed down his breakfast- but in the most graceful and unobvious manner- and left the Hall as soon as he could, and Harry couldn’t wipe the grin off his face, much to the worried glances of both Ron and Hermione.
, he added mentally. Another revelation from those times they actually talked and got carried away until Malfoy realized how long had passed before cutting the conversation awkwardly and walking away.
“We do,” Draco confirmed, nodding. “Actually we-”
Harry rolled his eyes and carefully held Draco’s head upright, trying not to flush at how close he was kneeling to the other man. “Draco,” he called. “Wake up.”
He gave the bushy-haired girl a half-hearted glare. “Don’t,” he said. “Just don’t. I don’t want to get my hopes up over nothing, and the thing is I can’t even blame him for saying yes.”
“Prat,” Harry said affectionately.
“You’re on, Draco.”
He began peppering soft kisses all over Draco’s face. His lips to the corner of his mouth, his nose, cheeks, eyelids, forehead. It took a while, but Draco eventually began to stir.
“Subtle,” Draco gasped, giving a slightly pained wheeze. Harry turned his head slightly just to be sure that he didn’t accidentally hit him too hard, only to be met with a light, teasing smile, which he gladly returned.
Harry grunted in acknowledgement before slowing down a bit to adjust himself while making sure to continue hitting that spot. He nestled his head in the crook of Draco’s neck, licking a small stripe up the exposed skin before nipping at it, marking him.
“It matters,” Harry started, “Because it means that you might need more preparation before we have sex. I don’t want to cause you pain.”
Merlin, he did hate his life.
“Git,” Harry grinned, giving Draco a light shove. “Anyway, what if I said there was a way to make it more fun?”
“Don’t take too bloody long,” Harry yelled through the hall before adding that he’d be waiting in the kitchen and busied himself by searching for a glass of water. The kitchen was, unsurprisingly, organized, and yet Harry had no idea how to locate the glasses.
“Merlin, fine,” Malfoy sighed, pretending to sound annoyed, but Harry could tell he was secretly pleased by the turn of events by how there was a slight upward turn to his lips. “If it eases your mind.”
“You’re both awful,” Harry sighed, hanging his head low.
?” His best friend cackled falling back on her settee. “Merlin’s beard, you must be desperate.”
“Pardon me for disagreeing,” Malfoy said dryly, getting up and brushing his robes off. “I feel like I need a long shower and a good shad, excuse my language,” he nodded his head to a flustered Hermione.
“Okay, okay,” Harry laughed, taking a step away. “But really…”
“Can’t you just let me find Draco first?” Harry pleaded, the rapid movement of his eyes never ceasing as he scanned the crowd for a bright, blind head. “What if he’s not able to find an empty train cart to sit in.”
“Right, no. I think my feet would like to live, thank you very much.” Draco laughed.
Harry had to stop himself from agreeing eagerly to the last comment, instead choosing to let out a huff of laughter as he followed the Slytherin into their bathroom.
“Thanks for agreeing to help out, Harry,” Draco said sincerely, flushing a bit and casting his glance down to the ground.
“Oh, that sounds pretty fun,” Harry agreed. “So it would basically be a party for our year?”
“Can I move now?” Harry asked, gently brushing a stray lock of hair off Draco’s face once he was able to calm himself down. At Draco’s nod of approval, Harry grinded his hips, carefully moving himself inside Draco until they were both comfortable enough for Harry to start pulling in and out.
“You boys should join them,” She suggested. Harry tried to decline politely.
Draco looked rather put out once he realized that it was almost time for him to leave if he had any plans of making it to Pansy’s Christmas Party. Harry supposed he should even count himself lucky that Draco chose not to skip out on their weekly hang-outs together instead of spending more time preparing for the party or going earlier.
“Scared, Malfoy?” Harry raised an eyebrow back, only to receive a snort in response and feel a hand grab his arm and drag him up and away from the Great Hall.
They weren’t both too skinny, or whatever Molly sees. Well, perhaps maybe Draco, but he was lean and fit. Harry had bulked up considerably after joining the Aurors. But he wasn’t wrong, they were going to end up with a bunch of home-made food if Draco went.
“Sure,” Harry shrugged. “But there’s no class tomorrow, so how do you feel about doing it sometime between before and after lunch, depending on when I wake up?” Harry teased.
This made Malfoy stare at him, this time making Harry squirm under the hard gaze.
“I’m sorry, were we hurting your delicate Gryffindor sensibilities,” Malfoy smirked, looking not at all apologetic. Beside him, Zabini snorted and looked up in his direction with a raised eyebrow.
“Right,” Draco nodded. “By the way, I’m glad that I’m allowed to come back this year. That I finally get a chance to know you, and everyone.”
Harry supposed that he shouldn’t have been surprised when he came down and found all of Draco’s notes stapled or filed in stacks, along with all of Harry’s things as well. Not to mention random sticky notes or reminders stapled to the wall, but that’s for another time.
If he threw Draco’s hat and coat into the cabinet behind his stacks of plates so he would have to stay longer to look for it later on, well, nobody needed to know.
“How incompetent are you, Potter?” Malfoy practically screamed in the common room. “I have things to study as well, you know?” He only reverted back to ‘Potter’ when he was seriously angry.
Yeah, they spent 3 years engaged, much to the surprise of their friends, who were somewhat expecting them to get married right away given how long they’ve waited for each other. But no, they wanted to take more time for themselves and do things they didn’t get to do when they were playing the game, not wanting to push the other too far. Like travelling, or something.
Draco sputtered in protest. “I do not!” he insisted.
“Hallucinate about me often, do you?” Harry teased, his heart beating heavily against his chest before noticing that Draco was beginning to fall back asleep. He tried not to make it too obvious that his eyes were having a field day eyeing the blond, silently thankful for the fact that Draco seemed to be too tired to notice anyway.
“Hey!” Harry protested, pouting at the blond.
“Potter!” A voice screeched from down the hallway of the Manor. “Get your arse back here right this instant before I burn you and feed you to the peacocks.”
Upon further inspection, he noticed that one of the tires had a huge gaping tear, which had probably blown out.
Over Harry’s dead body, although even that might be a possibility at this point too.
“Really?” she sounded a bit surprised. “Who?”
“Hey, I’m much more than that, I’ll have you know,” Harry said very seriously. “I’ve also gotten my head stuck in a fence.”
Harry blinked rapidly, taking a bit longer than he’d like to admit before he could process what was being asked.
Suddenly, there was a knock on the door and it slid open. Harry’s eyebrows were furrowed, wondering who it was that had the audacity to be so bold and let themselves into their cart until he realized that it was just Neville.
“I was supposed to,” Draco responded, giving a slight shrug. “But there are more new Prefects in Ravenclaw and Gryffindor this year, while Slytherin’s and Hufflepuff’s have had prior experience already, so I figured I’d guide them through for their first time.”
They barely got to eat after the dancing, only able to grab a few bites during Ron and Blaise’s speeches. Any point after that was spent with the other guests and hopping from table to table, with the help of some alcohol, of course.
“Oh dear,” Fleur mumbled, gracefully stepping into the room and over all the strewn hair products, broken brushes and combes that have become a casualty in the war against Harry’s head of hair. “What’s happened here?”
“It’s not that cold,” Harry then decided to voice his thoughts.
“Hey!” Harry protested, still not letting go of Draco. “I’m not that bad.”
____________________________
“Better bloody be amazed,” Draco grumbled under his breath. “Took me so bloody long to figure out the charm work on these.”
“But it’s fine,” Draco rushed out, taking hold of Harry’s hands. “It should be okay after you keep going, I think.”
She was made Head Girl while Draco was made Head Boy, something he wasn’t expecting. Apparently, Headmistress McGonagall had grown quite fond of Draco while they were working on the rebuilding and trusted him enough with this responsibility. Harry thought he deserved it, after everything. After all, throughout the summer he’s managed to prove himself to be changed and reliable, and not just for Slytherins.
“Well, Potter,” Draco drawled, sounding slightly slurred as he was still trying to fully wake up. “If you wanted to be on top of me, you could have just said so.”
“Babe, we’re already late,” Harry laughed, enjoying the way Draco’s cheeks turned pink at the nickname. He knew that Draco actually liked it when Harry used pet-names, though he would never admit it out loud.
“No argument there,” Harry eventually dragged himself out of bed, but not without the dramatics of groaning like he was about to take the walk to death, before standing behind his boyfriend and burying his face in his neck.
“And who’s side are you on?” Zabini asked, raising an eyebrow as he peered at Harry curiously.
However, he was stopped by a sudden yank on his arm, pulling him up until he was face to face with Harry, pressed against his bare chest. He must have taken off his shirt some time while Draco was sucking him off.
“You’re right, we should blame people like you and your family who are so far up their own arses and use money to get their way in life, even if it’s at the cost of others,” Ron exploded, finally sick of the conversation. “Running away from the war and hiding behind your own mother. People like you are the problem. I wouldn’t even be surprised if by the end of this program, you’re spouting the same bullishit Slytherin’s do. Like your father does.”
“Dude, please-“
“I don’t want to work today,” Draco groaned. “We aren’t even supposed to be reporting in.”
“Perhaps,” Draco said vaguely, still refusing to look at his boyfriend.
“This is amazing!” a first year whispered in awe.
Harry froze. He could not believe- no. He will kill them when this is all over. He chanced a glance at Malfoy, who looked utterly lost. So that means he didn’t know what the game was. Dean must’ve sensed his confusion because he quickly got down to explaining the rules.
“I told you why,” he mumbled.
Ron, Seamus and Neville looked at each other briefly, with Ron and Seamus faking a gag. At least all Neville did was smile politely before getting back to his work. They had all more or less gotten used to Draco and Harry ‘dating’ after the 3rd year mark, meaning this year.
“But…” Harry trailed off, not really wanting to spoil his boyfriend’s mood. “You don’t know how to drive, much less have a licence.”
“Yes, congratulations,” Draco laughed, rolling his eyes playfully. “Much better than last time.”
“Nothing, I was just curious,” Harry lied. “I’ll probably go with Ron and Hermione if they don’t have a date planned yet.”
“Looks good,” Draco grinned satisfactorily before flopping down on his bed. Harry lied down as well so that they were side by side, their shoulders just barely touching. “And I would tomorrow, but I’m going out with Neville to Hogsmead.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The only thing that managed to pull Harry out of his daze was the sharp sound of glass smashing against the tiled floor. He blinked, confused, before looking down to see spilled water and broken shards scatter around his feet, cursing to himself before casting a vanishing charm.
Maybe he should call Hermione to check his blood pressure.
Draco suddenly barked out a loud, and very nice sounding, laugh. “Oh yes, quite the keeper I have here,” He said dryly.
Every sensation was heightened as Harry touched all the right spots to spread pleasure through Draco’s body. With every thrust, Draco could feel Harry’s abdomen rub against his sensitive cock, on the verge of coming. Finally, it felt as though he might explode from all the pleasure that had been building inside him, his bollocks tightening as they threatened to spill.
“You know what’s on the menu? Me ’n’ you,” this time, Harry was greeted with not just one, but a crowd of groans coming from Draco and their 4 children.
“He might have been, but I believe that is why self-preservation is a trait that is commonly affiliated with the house,” Draco shrugged, looking unaffected. “I’m not saying denying education to those born in non-magical families was wrong, but his fear is justified. I’m assuming that’s why most Purebloods get sorted there, because of years worth of passed-down fear from before, eventually transforming into a somewhat extremist ideology.”
Malfoy stared at him. Then blinked. Then continued staring at him until Harry felt that maybe he was crossing a line here.
He willed himself not to think of those things, however, because he was practically exposed like this, and he didn’t want to make Draco uncomfortable by a surprise hard-on.
“That doesn’t prove anything.”
At this, Harry shifted uncomfortably, but Ron didn’t seem to share the same problem. In fact, it seems to have reignited his anger from earlier, if the way he went on was anything to go by.
“Well, not really,” Draco rubbed at his nape. “We were thinking of having a feast together at the Great Hall with the professors and the younger students, since they can’t drink yet, then move over to the Longbottom Manor. Neville’s aunt said she wouldn’t mind.”
The only reason he practically forced himself to stop glaring was because he almost tripped over his own feet, his toes dragging across the surface of the floor with every step.
“I did set an alarm,” Draco huffed, still managing to sound petulant despite the tiredness in his voice. “You see that weird lump in the corner? Yeah.”
“We’ve been dodging that rule for months,” Draco said, raising an eyebrow back at him. “You knew it was coming.”
“Draco, if you keep this up I
“It’s not organized,” he huffed. “Messy.”
As Harry absorbed what the blond just said, along with the entire situation, laughter bubbled out of him. It started as a small chuckle but eventually broke out into hysterical laughter.
“Hey,” he whispered as he stood up. “Hermione mentioned just some bits of what happened earlier, but I think you guys should stop antagonizing all of the exchange students before McGonagall finds out.”
“I might put away the blanket for a bit,” Draco said, looking down.
“Yes, but then why didn’t he ask him out before the school year started, then?” she pondered, coming to the same realization he did last night. “It doesn’t really make sense, waiting until the school year starts when they could have spent more time together over the break.”
“But if I own a share, shouldn’t they just supply us with is?” He asked, still not fully understanding the situation. Harry shook his head. No, they don’t. “What a scam,” Draco scoffed. “They’re not such good businessmen after all.”
“I like you, you idiot!” Harry blurted. “It was never really just a game for me, okay?” and with that, he bolted away from Draco, making his way to the entrance of the Manor before Disapparating back to Grimmauld Place. Their home.
“Where is your partner this time?” He knew it was coming, of course. The first time Robards had inquired, he sounded quite concerned. Draco was known to be one of the earliest people to come in every day prior to that week. He was very efficient and pretty good at his job, if he’d say so himself.
“Of course,” he said through gritted teeth. “Anything for you.”
Then, Harry grabbed his hands and began dancing them around, turning Draco off-beat and pulling him towards his chest, reminding him a bit of that afternoon they spent together before coming late to Pansy’s party.
Harry vaguely remembered that discussion. Both of them were kind of tipsy on wine, but he could still recall the important details
“I’m sure I could make it up to you,” Harry said as casually as possible with a small smirk, trying to mentally pull himself together. If he was reading the signs right, he might as well make the most of it. He could feel his heart begin to pound loudly in his chest but kept his eyes trained on the blond in front of him.
Before either Harry or Ron could respond, however, Harry noticed a figure making its way to their table, their cape flowing gracefully behind them in a show that seemed almost practiced. “I don’t think that’s a problem we have to think too hard on.”
“Don’t be silly, Ron,” Hermione chided, brisking in with various ribbons and cloths floating behind her. “Ferrets are carnivores. Their faeces could harm the plants. They have to be herbivores for it to work.”
“Hey!” Harry protested. He had not been stalking Malfoy this year. “What does that even mean?”
His hand moved from Draco’s thigh to his nipple, remembering how he reacted to when Harry played with them. They were still pebbled against the cold air, making it easier to grasp between his fingers, rolling the sensitive buds and tugging at them playfully.
“First of all, his convict father fought against us in the war. It’s his family’s fault that Ginny ended up cursed back in second year, and he killed so many people,” Ron began. “And he’s just like him. Look at how he’s mingling with the other Slytherins. They’re probably bonding over their blood purist shit, and now he’s dragging my girlfriend with him.”
“Me and Neville, you mean,” Draco mumbled, his cheeks flushing a bit. Although that could be because of the cold air that surrounded them.
Harry just shrugged. “They all seem to know him better than we do. Maybe we should apologize soon, though.”
“In my defense, I tried to get Kingsley to introduce us as Santa and the Elves,” Harry shrugged, still smiling widely.
“And take your attentions away from your breakfast?” he raised a pale eyebrow at Harry.
They settled into a comfortable silence, Draco lifting his glass to take another sip. After a few more seconds, Harry decided to speak up again.
“Mate, if he evolves into bridezilla or something, it’s on you,” Ron said from one of the chairs,
“Just making sure,” Hermione said. “No need to give you excuses to stalk him this year. Surely you already have enough.”
“Great,” Harry grinned, already counting which classes both he and Hermione are taking so he knows when he’ll be able to see Draco.
“I was only able to get 20%, though,” Draco frowned apologetically. “Muggles are very hard to do business with.”
” Harry asked, doing a quick double-take and staring wide-eyed at the pair with his mouth agape. “You literally just bought it. How did it explode?”

Yeah, perhaps both of them were going to die of embarrassment before they made it back to their office alive.
Actually, maybe that’s why Gryffindor and Slytherin were kept on opposite sides.
“You- You want a cat?” Harry clarified, somewhat dumbfoundedly.
Once they made it to one of the drawing rooms where Narcissa stood in front of a bunch of wide-eyed children, they quietly took their seats behind them. Draco was right, a lot of things had been renovated. All the colors and areas he observed on their way in were lighter, giving off a bright feeling to the Manor. It was a bit more modern, but still very elegant, with most of the old wood and marble being replaced with white marble instead. The green and gold theme still stayed, though, which meant the carpets and settee covers.
They headed out, Draco guiding them to a further part. “They might not make it this far with the time limit and how thoroughly they’re searching,” he explained. The place was kind of hidden, anyway. Or at least for the kids, because of the relatively high hedges.
With that said, he, too, was sorely disappointed.
“Right, well…" Ron trailed off awkwardly, unsure of what to say at the strange looking display in front of him. “I’m going to bed.”
“And if you think you’re going out there without your blazer or Boutonnière, you’ll soon be a dead man instead,” Oh. Right. That. It wasn’t hard to put on, anyway. Just needed a bit of fixing.
“I arrived on time, then?” Harry asked, walking towards the kitchen once Draco stepped aside to let him in.
The doors to the Hall were opened and the First Year students were led in, eyes staring curiously wide as they took in the magnificent site that was the Great Hall. Harry remembered what it felt like the first time he walked in, and it warmed him inside to realize that these innocent kids get to experience it as well, thanks to everyone.
Grinning triumphantly to himself, Draco pulled away and began trying to undo the laces. Except, the problem was that his hands were still shaking from the nerves, and he couldn’t properly untie their laces. He began tugging at them frustratedly until he realized that it had knotted, meaning he’d actually have to carefully undo it.
The only ones who were still buzzing and energetic by the time most people left were the 8th Year students, who were all looking forward to the party that they were going to. From what Harry knows, there would be a few 7th Years present as well, but a very select few because most would be underaged and not allowed by their parents. Anyone else who was allowed would most likely be there.
“It was?” Harry let out an embarrassing squeak. Oh Merlin, he hoped that Draco didn’t notice- that is, if he really did at least.
Harry laid in Draco’s bed, giving himself a couple more seconds to fully wake up, before rolling onto his side and, to no one’s surprise, his boyfriend was still peacefully asleep.
“I was just thinking, since everyone pointed out that I don’t know you,” Harry began. “I think I’d like to get to know you. Would you feel strange if I started hanging out with you and Hermione?”
If only the prat’s eyes didn’t practically shine with excitement as he spoke and his face didn’t light up the way it did, maybe it would have been easier to look away instead of openly stare for the world to see.
He saw Harry smile softly at him, then lean back down to give Draco a quick, deep kiss.
“Well, that’s what you get for talking" Harry said smugly. “Besides, the theme is still mostly silver and green. My suggestion, mind you.”

“Kiss me again and I might be more sure,” Malfoy replied with some snark still present in his voice. However, the pink dusting his pale cheeks was enough to give him away. “In fact, I might just show you instead.”
“I’m glad I came too, Draco,” he murmured, keeping eye contact with him. Draco, slightly wide-eyed and flushed pink from the alcohol, just stared at him back, as if unsure of what to do with himself. Then, Harry found himself leaning in slowly, just a small movement, and observed how Draco didn’t flinch or move away. Instead, he watched carefully, as if slightly dazed, as Harry shifted closer.
Malfoy looked at him incredulously, as if Harry said something blindingly stupid.
“Hey, Harry,” Draco mumbled, pausing a few meters before the entrance. “I wanted to ask you something.”
Harry stared at her, then he blinked. And blinked again. “You’re right!” he exclaimed.
“They will be joining you for your regular classes and will be making use of the school’s facilities, so please be reminded that you are to welcome them and help them should they have any problems.” Harry doubted there would be many problems regarding that, seeing as most of the student body was already excited to meet them. “They are well-versed in their translation charms, as I’ve been informed, but will most likely be speaking English thanks to their extensive classes for those joining this program.”
“They’re both aged at 46, if you’d like to adopt them, ma’am,” Scorpius replied with a false tone of courtesy.
“C’mon, Harry,” Draco huffed from his place in front of the mirror, “We’re graduating today and you still haven’t gotten out of the habit of ignoring the alarm I set for you at least 4 times before getting up.”
“Sorry, I can’t,” Draco answered, looking a bit disappointed. “Head Boy duties. I promised some new 6th Years that I’d help them with their Charms texts.”
“I’d love to partner up with one at least,” Hermione sighed.
His former schoolmate was already there when he arrived, leaning against the wall where Harry found him initially, looking very unsure of himself, which made Harry frown. He was clutching two large muggle suitcases which surprised Harry since he wasn’t really expecting the man to have so much to bring, all things considered, but shrugged it off and offered to bring one himself.
