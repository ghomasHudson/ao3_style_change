Rubbing his head, Draco sighed and got up to change his clothes and get ready for the day. He needed to at least find him and see whether or not he was doing fine. However, he was with his Gryffindor friends, so he was probably doing very well. Maybe he was even laughing and joking just like they had done the last few months.
“Are you seriously dragging around Amortentia?” Harry asked, but couldn’t hide a smirk. “I thought you were desperate, but not
“What?” He felt his heart skip a beat and such a heat in his face, that he was sure he was as red as a tomato. “No, I’m not.”
“Ron! Harry!” Another voice called, before Ron could even say something else. Harry turned to see Hermione running through the halls and into the snowy landscape outside of Hogwarts. Her hair was jumping up and down and the robe billowed behind her as the wind made it look even more spectacular. In her arms she was carrying three huge books and her bag had another two books inside, almost falling out. It looked like she had come straight from the library to talk to them.
Harry nodded. “The mediwitches figured out one potion that’s helping me keeping almost all of the food. It’s not a good potion, but I’d rather have this than having to try other things that ultimately will all fail.”
“We’re okay with this. It is getting a little small here, not to… point that out to you, Severus” Draco said apologetically.
Dean stepped back a little, which made Padfoot calm down. While Harry let go of his dog, the other Gryffindor shrugged his shoulders. “Sorry, mate. I… Blaise said you told him he could work here?”
“Wow, Blaise, we’re not doing wedding vows right now! I don’t have prepared anything!” Harry chuckled and received a kiss on his cheek. He turned to Ginny and smiled. “However, since it’s you, I’ll tell you that this man right here has been a right pain in my ass. But every time I lose my shit and freak out, he’s there to get me back to reality. There hasn’t been anybody in my life who can do that.”
Seamus’ laugh brought Harry back and he looked through the crowd to see Draco standing behind the newly arrived Gryffindor and smirking at him. He knew exactly where Harry’s head had been.
His ward was so tired, that he was either completely asleep again or half awake, desperately trying to cling onto his state. However, Draco was somehow sure that he was about asleep. In fact, as he entered his room and placed Potter in his crib, the boy yawned again and turned, completely asleep.
“Pansy?” Draco entered his room and found Pansy clearly hiding Potter. She had her back turned to him and looked over her shoulder to Draco smiling innocently. Too innocent in his opinion. “Pansy, what are you doing? And where is Potter?”
“What?” Harry shook his head. “You’re basically telling me to stalk my potential boyfriend and then ask him out?”
At this time, Hermione joined and nodded approvingly. “Actually, I have seen him. At half past eight, I sat down at the same table and we started working together.”
That was Neville. Harry looked over his shoulder and saw his friend standing on the entrance to the dormitories, before he closed the doors, smirking. “I knew you didn’t hate each other!”
Sadly, this happiness was cut short by another knock on the door. Draco raised his head and frowned. “If that is Lucius again, I will lose it!”
They talked a little more about what Ginny and Luna had planned so far for their wedding and Harry did notice how their wedding was going to be in November. Ginny had always wanted a spring wedding. The only reason for her to change this idea was because of two reasons. First: Luna didn’t want a spring wedding; though Harry knew that she didn’t really mind when as long as it was Ginny she was marrying. The second reason was a little more depressing: Ginny didn’t believe that Harry would actually make it to spring.
Finally, she started speaking. “I need you to brew a nutrient-rich potion. I’m well aware that Mr. Potter’s fast aging makes it a little hard, however, I believe that we can start giving him this potion before he turns four years old.”
Harry nodded weakly. That could very likely be true. He still didn’t like the fact that Ron sometimes pretended that everything was normal between them and then in the middle of a sentence realized that Harry couldn’t really go out and drink or do something else his friends were doing.
When he grabbed his mug again, an animal walked into the kitchen purring and Eric chuckled. “Look who finally woke up from her nap, Princess Aurora!”
Draco’s tired eyes looked up at him and he smiled, forced. Harry wanted to tell him not to force his emotions like he had done in his Hogwarts years, but his husband started talking quickly. “It’s just one of these days.”
“I never realized it was a movie about a forced marriage. After today, I might have to choose another movie that I like the most.” He sighed, placing his head on the bed. Since they were sitting on the floor, it wasn’t that difficult and he could still see Harry from the corner of his eyes.
“I could eat” Draco grinned.” But I might have to steal one of your jumpers, because I feel too formal in this.” Gesturing to his party outfit, he found Harry smirking and shrugging his shoulders.
Checking everything that was going on at Hogwarts internally, Draco agreed. “That works for me, Professor.”
Before Harry even had the time to think of what he wanted to do, Hermione pulled him aside. She walked him into the kitchen, which was fine as that was another hiding place Harry hadn’t considered as of now and they sat down by the tables.
Harry grinned. “I remember you telling me I wasn’t getting any more chocolate cake the other day... so you...”
Harry grinned and placed a hand on his new friend’s shoulder. “You have a job lined up for you next year, yes. Congratulations.”
Finally, the lunch rush seemed to be over and Harry fell into a chair, groaning. “Why on earth did I think it was a good idea to open up a coffee shop?! Why didn’t you stop me?”
“You’re not mad?” Draco asked. He looked curiously at Harry, who shook his head and put his arm around his shoulders.
There was a line there, as if Harry had tried to continue writing, but his dizziness didn’t let him. On the next page was a list of different illnesses. The headline was
“Of course” Draco answered and changed to sit Indian style on the grass. Aaron followed his example.
Now was definitely a talk happening. Draco knew mother instincts very well. He had to be good at reading them. Sometimes, his mother was in a mood to play and he could pretend not to do things she wanted him to do. Or he could allow himself to talk back a few times, making jokes. As time had went, his mother had gotten a very short temper, freaking out at every little word joke and resistance. It was better to just do what she said. Draco knew that the presence of the Dark Lord had freaked her out as much as it had him. Additionally to the werewolf, the Snatchers and whatever other creature they were hosting in the Manor.
I do not like graphic descriptions of violence. So, I decided to be a little creative and I changed Draco’s POV. I am sorry about that and it won’t happen again, but I actually kinda like the second part. It makes it more mysterious.
On the way to the Hospital Wing, Harry seemed to be upset. Once they almost reached the room, he finally seemed able to talk about it. “Why is Ron that way? I remember him being completely different. He was so kind and nice and… and open minded. But now… he’s somewhat weird. Why does he act that way?”
“Assad means lion in Arabic” Malfoy explained and looked at Harry with wide eyes. “William was Rose.”
“No!” he said strongly. He stared at her for a second, before he turned and looked to the wine bar, where Draco had apparently finally made a decision. He inhaled and yelled over: “Yo, Malfoy! Get me some of that too!”
“Well, then that’s that. The potion did it’s wonders, you’re most likely pregnant and we’ll figure it out in about two days.”
Harry snorted. “Oh yeah? I haven’t read about a ‘Malfoy’ in the last few years, have you? Because I think the Wizarding society has forgotten about you.” Most likely, the Malfoy name had vanished because Draco was no longer called Malfoy and his parents had moved away to France - though Harry doubted most people knew that.
He apparently went to a lover, gotten a hickey and presumably had sex, before realizing he had to race back to Hogwarts, which made it unable for him to check in a mirror how he looked, therefore the badly buttoned up shirt. Draco seemingly went to a lover and brought him here, apparently just to annoy Harry with it. How was it okay now to show Harry that he was the poor fellow?
“I mean” Potter started and shrugged his shoulders. “Sure. You should take a break from your world hating ethics and enjoy the little things.”
Surprisingly, Narcissa Malfoy came by today. Apparently, she has been released from Azkaban and she thanked me for what I did for Draco. It sucks that my memory isn’t working today, because I have no fucking idea what I did for him… It must be something good, right? Otherwise his mother would come by and thank me?
“I have absolutely no clue what you’re talking about.” He winked at Draco and started working on different tables, while Draco quickly excused himself.
” She looked at Draco, who nodded, unsure whether or not he was actually allowed to take something out there, should he ever need to.
“What the fuck is going on?! He’s just three years old!” Draco was fuming. That little shit of cousin should burn in hell forever – as the Muggles said. Well, no. All of his relatives should burn in hell. “No food for a fortnight?! How did he even survive that?!”
They hurried back and upon entering the pub, it was decently filled and James started taking orders this second. Draco checked in the kitchen for Potter, who was hard-working on lunch.
While the others laughed, Theodore was frowning at the baby and finally said what was on his mind: “If I were you, I would go through the history of how he grew up. I’ve had this thing once happening to a cousin of mine and apparently you go through all the states of what you’ve felt through this age.”
Leaning in, Draco captured his lips in a n intense kiss and pulled him into a tight hug. “I don’t know how I could be so lucky to have you - the best husband ever. And he's mine!”
Draco smiled at Harry. Yes, Harry had come a long way. On Saturday morning, he had suddenly stopped doing anything, called for his Patronus and freaked out over a shadow in the corner. It had kept going for almost twenty four hours, until the paranoia had finally stopped and he had turned back into a somewhat happy Harry.
“Oh, she did a whole lot for us, Theodore” Harry answered and beamed at the Slytherin. “She helped Draco and me to talk about our future and our relationship. It was amazing, really. And thank you so much for insisting!”
“It’s in the will, isn’t it?” McGonagall asked and smiled at the werewolf, who was still in clear shock. Draco wasn’t sure why he was so surprised… He had never seen the house, but from what Potter’s father wrote it wasn’t big… or may it actually was but for James Potter it was small. Well, maybe he could take a look at it on Saturday.
Harry grinned. “Don’t worry, ‘Mione. You can buy the books in the front. In the back there’s a library, where the rare books are. Some of them are in permanent spells so they won’t turn into dust if you open them. The oldest one dates back to 700 BC.”
Immediately backing away, Harry felt the wall in his back. There was no way to escape. He tried to find a way of getting away from the other Auror. Over the Slytherin’s shoulder, he could see Malfoy widening his eyes and taking a step into Harry’s direction, when Ron held him back.
“He’s not my boyfriend!” Pansy glared again. “But that would be very nice of you” she added sheepishly.
“I don’t intentionally keep him from you. You’re not Slytherin; Potter spends his time in our Common Room. I don’t think that…” Before Draco could end his sentence, Weasley exploded in his face.
“What just happened?” Ron asked and fell onto the couch next to Harry, making Padfoot move away or he had Ron’s feet in his face.
“The same would happen should the Hat choose Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff, however, we do believe that it will be the same house. It’s just a courtesy to the Book of Acceptance and the Sorting Ceremony” the Headmistress continued as she smiled at him.
“Love, I have been awake for three hours already, trying to tire down Harry. He just doesn’t get tired in the snow!”
Draco froze staring at his mother, unable to think of anything. Before he could even realize what was going on, the earth started to shake. Magic rushed at him, clouds of white dust formed around him, setting him as the middle of a hurricane. The ancient Malfoy magic tore into him as if knives were cutting him into pieces or claws of a wild animal ripped open his skin. Draco screamed in pain into the howling whirlwind around him, he felt something torn out of his body and fell to his knees, defeated.
“Yes.” Draco said that without even waiting a beat and Harry smiled at him, softly, squeezing his hand for which he received a squeeze in return.
Draco smirked as he snuck past his godfather’s office and into the Common Room, letter in hand. Remus’ owl had found him in the library and he had only then realized how late it was. He had been studying Transfigurations with Hermione, driving her mad with all of his problems and he was sure he had confused her as well in the end. Luckily when he had snuck back, he had not been caught.
Malfoy rolled his eyes and glared at Nott. “It could be literally anybody, Theo.” He grabbed Harry and pulled him down into the basement. Ron followed almost immediately and Harry could hear Nott sigh, before he walked down the creaky stairs as well.
He flinched when he heard his uncle’s voice and the shovel in his hands fell down against a pot and broke off a tiny bit. Boy widened his eyes and quickly grabbed the thing and put it back, just when Uncle Vernon walked around the corner, glaring at him.
“That cannot be true!” someone called out as soon as Eric put a foot through the door and a goblin saw him. Smirking, Eric rolled his eyes. “Eric Rogers! I think I may have just died!”
I would like to add that this letter is not meant to be secretive, unlike my wife’s letter. This letter (well a copy of it) will be the official will document. Should I die, everything in my possession will be handed to my wife. However, and this seems to be the reality of how things are going to end up, should we both die, our possessions will be separated and distributed to the following people:
Did it really look like that? He really hadn’t wanted to ignore his best friend since childhood. Though when he looked back at this day, he could see how Ron might have thought that.
“Shit” Hermione squeezed his arm and smiled softly. “Don’t you worry, Harry. Things will turn out fine. I’m sure of it.”
Draco could see the other man’s muscles tense, he was shaking even more. Then there was a knock on the door, which pushed Potter even deeper. Whoever it was, didn’t seem to care, since they knocked even more.
“Vanessa, Henry, do you enjoy your wedding? Anything I can do for you?” he asked and placed a friendly hand on Henry’s shoulder.
Pansy was clearly about to explode, when Draco pulled her back and nodded at the Gryffindors. “Thank you for telling us. I think we need to go to the Hospital Wing now.”
“I’m really glad you’re back with the living, Harry. You just have to try and keep your eyes open for longer than an hour” Ron joked and chuckled as Harry rolled his eyes.
Harry leaned back and brushed an annoying strain of hair out of his face. “I see. So, what kind of secrets have you been telling each other?”
“You know if you keep sitting on my foot, I will move your washing day up and have you cleaned today instead of tomorrow. Without magic. Good old scrubbing technique, a lot of shampoo… Do you want that, Merlin?” Harry frowned, looking down at the Kneazel.
Kevin shrugged his shoulders and chuckled. “He’s doing a lot of work for the company. Sometimes, he just needs a day off. It’s nothing new, so don’t worry.” He pulled a paper out of a folder. “Let’s talk about your experiences. You had two dates until now?”
Hogwarts had probably finally gotten a professor for wild beast who knew how to teach the students, as there were a few paddocks with different animals and even magical horses. A few wizards were going through the boxes, other were feeding the animals. Thinking his made Harry feel slightly guilty, since Hagrid had been a good guy, but he just didn't have what it took to be a professor. While he cared enough for the animals, he didn't care the same amount for all the students. So, Harry was glad that he had found work in Charlie's dragon house, or whatever it was called.
Draco watched Harry very closely and saw him actually faking a somewhat sad expression. It was so believable that had he not spent the last few months with him, he would have never seen the small sparks in his eyes and the miniscule jerk of his lips.
“When’s the wedding?” another voice asked and Harry turned around to see Ron grinning at him. “A motherly bird told me about the engagement.”
Also, I am pretty sure that you might have guessed this, but the story just got more chapters. I can’t end in a few chapter xD So the final chapter count is 86 (depending on how much you guys inspire me, I might add another chapter, but I think I’ve included all the things I wanted to in these 86 chapters).
“Not a date, Aaron. And he’s got a boyfriend” Potter grinned and shooed him outside after that comment. Turning back to Draco, he was still grinning. “Sorry, he tends not to think this late in the evening.”
“Hey, hey” Draco vanished the puke and kneeled down before Harry’s bed. He carefully ruffled through this hair once he had calmed down and turned on his back again. “How are you doing, Harry?”
“I’m not going to apologize” he stated and grinned. Draco got up and greeted his friend as well. Harry followed and the rest of the table joined as well.
Sitting down on the small bench, he placed Potter next to himself. The baby was cuddling the teddy and observing the busy kitchen quite curiously. He squealed happily and somewhat excited, when a house elf sent up food to the tables.
“I know, I know” Harry rubbed his forehead. “I need to think about this. Kevin, don’t make any more appointment for new customers for now. We have enough going on as it is.” He needed to talk to some people who were there, who could see what he went through. Maybe they could help. “How’s the planning for the Brauner’s wedding going?”
“You’re not ready to take over this kind of responsibility, love. You can’t even get dressed in the morning alone.”
The man, which was probably William, sighed and hid it in the drawer again. He then turned around and pulled out a parchment on which he started writing quickly. There were tears in his eyes as he continued writing.
Harry snorted. “I’m not talking about small snakes. I mean the basilisk.” He looked at Draco and Pansy, who both sat up and took notice of what he had just said.
Harry laughed. “Can I go with you to the lessons this afternoon? I really want to learn more about Transfigurations!”
The Gryffindor chuckled, while she shook his wet robes, where the rain had luckily stopped pouring out. “I may have started to say something inappropriate to Harry.”
Draco grinned and hugged the dog. “I know, Paddy, I know! I’m here now!” he said and ruffled his fur. He then walked to the table at the back, Padfoot behind him.
“Thank you!” Harry chuckled. “I have a ticket to Hawaii where I just want to enjoy life. I found a job in a bar and I think it will be something different so live to close to the sea.”
control.” Harry grinned. “Blaise enjoys joking around, he speaks a lot with his hands and eye rolls when he’s not happy with something. Millicent is a little harder to place, but I think she’s taking Pansy as an idol in nonverbal communication. She also works a lot with eye movement and facial expressions. Theodore on the other hand has a lot in his brain and concentrates on that. He’s much more focused whenever he’s giving you nonverbal signals. Also, he seems to be using his whole body for that.”
Harry bit back a laugh when Draco broke the kiss, his eyes wide. Yes, they might have figured out a way to get Draco to lose his mind. Flirting with Harry was actually something that would bring his husband to the breaking point. He had it under control, especially when they were in public, but Harry questioned if he could keep his jealousy in control with their former classmates.
That moment, an owl flew into the room and dropped a letter on Draco’s lap. “Thank you, Isaac!” Draco called out while the owl flew out, as if he was in a hurry to get away. Which yes, with Merlin present, all owls should be scared. Dag was the only one who kept him under control. Probably because he felt as if Harry was his human and even though Merlin had tried to fight to be number one... Dag had always won by just a little bit. Draco suspected it was because he had bought him Dag when Harry had been a child and this memory played a huge role in Harry's mind. Anyway, Harry wasn't one to only like one animal and Merlin absolutely did not have to fight, he still liked him a lot.
Sighing, Draco sat up and made Harry move slightly, so they didn’t collide. Sitting up on his knees as well, Harry tilted his head slightly and frowned. What was going on? Draco seemed really annoyed and… somehow scared.
“I know, I know, Maria!” Harry rolled his eyes and grinned. “You can tell me all about that when I’m back. I’ll see you soon. Tell Kevin to give the profile on his desk to Thomas. I think it’s a perfect fit. See you soon!”
“I understand your concern, Miss Parkinson, however...” McGonagall started. Draco could Pansy about to say something against that and actually silenced her with a warning glance. She seemed to catch on and simply growled something. All the while, McGonagall continued: “...we have to do it this way. It’s about giving young Harry Potter a place to grow up.”
Harry shrugged his shoulders. “I sold it to Ministry. It still has some of the strongest wards around it and I mean Dumbledore basically made it a safe house for the Order. So now, the Head Auror has decided to keep it a safe house for undercover Aurors. I think Sirius would have been okay with it. And that was the only thing that could get me out of the Auror program. I told them I’d take the house back if they wouldn’t let me and Neville leave.” Harry smirked. “Of course, I couldn’t do that, because I already used all the money they gave me to buy this apartment. But they were scared and actually let us go without any problems.”
Malfoy chuckled airily and shrugged his shoulders. “That was not the proudest moment of my life. But you looked really good and I just couldn’t… I couldn’t focus.” He grinned. “From then on, I just tried to get the courage to ask you out, and it never worked. Or maybe I was just too scared that you would still think of me as your bully and not see me as… someone who has tried to get their life back together.”
Severus got up and turned to Draco. “Let’s get to work, Draco. We’ve had a few harder potions to make in class. I can tell you as well that one of these
He rubbed his hand over where he thought he had read his name and when the grey dust fell off… there it was.
He smiled at them and started walking quicker. “If you excuse me, I’ll need to find the Headmistress and beg for Padfoot’s presence.”
“Good to go” Eric answered. He then looked at the man who faced the two of them now. “Hi, I’m Eric. I’m sorry for eavesdropping, but there’s a helpful academy for werewolves in Iceland. They’ll train you to keep composure even when your wolf instincts try to come through and once a month they’ll hold ‘meetings’. It’s all tailored to the job someone has. What do you do?”
Hell no! This Gryffindor was not getting the last of their discussion! Also, Gryffindor had apparently some weird things as well, if the rumours were to be believed. “Oh you mean the stairs that turn into a slide should a boy walk up to the girls’ dormitory?”
Finally, everything made sense. The way his hand tingled from the Savior’s touch, his feeling of wanting to be seen by Harry, the need to bicker with him. He… liked him. Very much actually.
“Mate, he said he loved someone else and how he would be able to deal with you and that you won’t be a problem any longer or something! It genuinely sounded like he was threatening to kill you!”
Looking through the different vials, he found the one he needed. An anti-love potion… potion, if he wanted to call it that. He smirked and took it out of Padfoot’s collar, before he checked the lid. It was closed perfectly, nothing seemed to have happened to it.
Harry was just about to plead with his eyes so that she wouldn’t reveal their secrets, when Daphne shrugged her shoulders. “I know a lot about him. For example; he was supposed to marry my little sister, but he didn’t. What’s that telling you?”
Sighing yet again, he got up and yawned. Aurora in her soft bed stirred as well and when Alamar stood up, she followed him as well, down the stairs into the barely lit kitchen. And there he was. Eric sat there with a cold cup of tea, an open book, though his eyes were in the distance, not even looking at the book. He stared at the black dot in the table and only awoke from his thoughts, when Alamar kissed the top of his head.
Draco smiled, happy to see him actually wanting to eat. He looked over to Pansy, who smiled now as well, almost certainly having had the same though he had.
“Well, if you want them, you can have them. I honestly don’t know what to do with…” before he could finish, Malfoy closed the door to the cupboard and stood in front of him.
“Not sure yet. Severus wants me to go into a new potion’s project. But I think enjoying life should be rather high on my list as well.”
In the room furthest away from the staircase, Harry sat down and pulled his knees up to his chin. He wasn’t going back. He couldn’t be seen by the other Aurors, not after Nott was probably going to tell them what happened in here – if they ever got out.
With an utterance of a spell, he jumped through the opening, while there were still parts of the wood flying through the air. The Aurors tried to follow, but the wall didn’t let them through. This seemed to be the beginning of that hole in the wall.
When Luna walked to the kitchen, Harry turned to Ginny. “Didn’t you want to prove that Luna isn’t… you know ‘crazy’?” he asked with air quotes.
She sat down on the couch, next to Harry and sighed. “He was a very bad man. And he lived with Draco until he died.”
“Would you like to join me for tea?” Severus asked and smiled at Harry and Draco, as if he knew something was going on.
Chuckling, Alamar shook his head. “Breakfast, Harry. We’re eating first, I thought you would remember that simple rule in our home!”
“Yes! You’re that. And people don’t feel safe depending on where they are. Like, when they’re on top of a waterfall on a boat! But if they get to see you, they know that you are beautiful and nice and you can protect them. Like you protect me.” Harry explained and smiled at Draco. “So I like your hair!”
Nott turned to Harry and raised his eyebrows. “It let us inside when you touched the door, Potter. The house has feelings for you.”
Draco got up and quickly caught the Kneazel before he made it to the fish. “You can stay outside of the kitchen for the next hour, Merlin” he said, placing a wall in front of the kitchen. Well, Merlin had always been able to somehow charge through the magic fields, so maybe they had a nice brunch for about half an hour. In fact, it ended up being quite the enjoyable affair.
Even though they were in the shadows, Eric exhaled as they finally entered the safety of the Gringott’s creature wards. What the wizards didn’t know was that the goblins were on their side ever since the wizards and witched started taking away their gold. The creature wards made every creature either look like a goblin or a wizard or witch, depending on what was closer – people could make of that what they wanted.
“Harry! Did something happen? I’m sorry, my magic must have stopped working... Is everything okay?” Draco asked, honestly scared that Harry had hurt himself or something.
“Malfoy” Harry greeted coldly. He was just about to continue talking, accusing him of having an affair, when Ron took matters into his own hands.
The assistant had gotten the blood from Draco and he once again glanced at Severus, who nodded at him, before he followed the assistant. The inside of the back room looked like a greenhouse. Only it wasn’t green but filled with all kinds of different colors. And it smelled as if he had just entered a flower shop, sweet and fruity and just amazing.
He placed a form in front of Harry and gave him a quill. Harry quickly read over all the information and nodded. It wasn’t a huge Manor, but it had a lot of land and a stable where once there had been about twenty five horses.
Severus chuckled and looked over at Caellum who had big eyes, staring at the still unknown person in his life. His huge green eyes matched Harry's very well. And he had definitely gotten his mother's hair, even though Harry's mother had been a redhead as well. Not that Draco minded, he loved every part of his family. It was
“You old charmer” Harry laughed and pulled Draco into a kiss, when Heinrich released Lucky again and he ran around them, portraying the happiness Harry felt on the inside and Teddy clapped his hands, obviously happy for the two of them. It was only going to get better from here.
“We’re not keeping this, Harry! We’re looking through it and copy everything we’ll like but then we’ll send it to you” he said and smiled.
“Expelliarmus!” A wand flew towards Harry and he caught it with ease, while Ron quickly caught the running criminal.
“Alright then, what plans have you got? Because I have an amazingly terrible idea which would be best for our finale.”
“They were looking for you. They being Hermione and – Ron.” He decided to call him his actual name for whatever reason.
“You could also just make it a study date. Harry would never show up at these” Theodore offered and Draco caught Harry’s outraged expression with amusement. Meanwhile, they had already reached the Great Hall and sat down on the Slytherin table. Harry waved to his friends in Gryffindor and Hermione waved back while Ron tried but lost half his breakfast on the fork.
“Yes, it’s gonna be the newspaper title tomorrow” Keene smirked as they walked into the changing room. “And ya gonna be even more famous now!”
“That can’t be healthy” Harry remarked and looked at his friend, who shrugged his shoulders as if there was nothing he could do to change that.
Was there any emotion connected to Neil telling him that their relationship was done? Draco frowned and listened to his heart, which was still beating with the same neutral beat than before.
His husband crossed his arms over his chest as well. “Oh don’t pretend you’re better than that, Potter” Draco rolled his eyes. “I know you had a lawyer over this morning. Just let me do my move and then you can play whatever predictable chess move you’re thinking of right now.”
Potter stood behind the bar, pouring drinks for some guests sitting there and James was already going around the room, collecting orders from the different tables. People were laughing loudly and discussing different topics.
“Huh” Draco was actually very impressed. “That’s very noble of you. Not everyone would see it that way.”
She sighed. “Your boss let me in. Harry, we’re having Christmas at the Burrow and you’re not there!  It’s time you’re part of our family again. Don’t you think? Why did you decide to work today? Actually why did you decide not to come by anymore?”
Before Hermione could say something, the door was opened again and Ron walked in, freezing when he saw his wife. “Hermione Jean Weasley, what are you doing here? Didn’t we agree that until the baby was born, I’d work in the Ministry and after that we’d share the responsibilities?”
” She didn’t read all of it, maybe there was a rule about how much people were allowed to hear, but Draco knew that there were a few more things in there than just the birth certificate and a few toys.
“I want to marry you!” he said. His suit was uncared for, as he had just had this revelation and ran through the streets to find her. His hair was completely messed up, but his eyes were glowing and sparkling. And yes, in real life that would never happen, but every time this happened in the movie, he found himself squealing about how cute these two were together. He always sounded like Pansy when Harry was cute.
When both men stood close to Draco, Teddy squealed again and Harry turned to look at him. He grinned broadly and knelt down in front of him. “Hello there! I’m Harry. What’s your name?”
Harry grinned. “Sure” he pecked his husband’s lips. “But you already knew I’d say yes, because I would literally do anything to keep you happy.”
McGonagall leaned closer and wordlessly raised her eyebrows. Harry bit back a smirk and turned back to his book, while Draco seemed to have a harder time hiding his amusement. They silently ate for a while until Harry once again got the Amortentia scent and he growled at Draco.
“Speaking of Draco, do you might sending him a letter telling him to go ‘meet his wife’ possibly somehow write that he needs to go to the Room of Requirement? We really need to figure out how to explain Padfoot.”
Malfoy looked at him from the corner of his eyes and shook his head. “Both of you are talking about things that shouldn’t interest you.”
“Good Morning to you too, Harry.” Draco smirked. “And you weren’t entirely correct, since I’m now standing
I'm sorry you had to wait for a little bit. A lot of things have happened last week: I had to prepare for a huge test which I have passed today :) And I had to do so much, I'm incredibly tired. Then, my laptop broke and it's still broken but I recovered that story, so luckily I don't have to give it up! :D I've been writing half of that chapter on my new laptop which is weird (read: unfamiliar), I hope everything turned out fine :)
Before they could do or say anything else, Madam Pomfrey walked out of her office and turned to them. “Before you go off to Hogsmeade, make sure to keep him in here for an hour.” She smiled at them and walked over to the window, where a knocking and scratching could be heard.
“Do you see the star over the lake, on top of the mountain there?” he pointed to the shadow under a particularly bright shining star. Harry nodded and Draco smiled. “That’s called Gamma Draconis.”
The rest if dinner turned into quite the discussion about how big houses were supposed to be and how many people could theoretically live in Severus’ house without having problems. In the end, Severus ushered them out, saying he wanted to stay there alone and only having visitors during the day. The last part made all of them laugh and Harry decided to show them the flat he had apparently heard off.
“Hard pass! I don’t think I would have been friends with someone who destroyed my father’s legacy” Draco said and winked at Harry. “But let’s ignore that. You said you wanted to talk to me about… Dumbledore?”
“That wizard was...” Hermione had just been about to start a full on rant about history, while Ron held his ears closed with his hands. It looked like he had gone back to his childhood years. Harry was actually waiting for him to call out ‘I can’t hear you, lalalalala’. Luckily, he didn’t do it.
Eric rolled his eyes. “My parents decided to call me Frederick. I honestly hate this name. So I have a few nicknames, but the one I go with is Eric.” He looked at Kira as if she should have known not to call him Freddy, which made her shrug her shoulders and grin.
“I would have definitely kissed you right now, but we are surrounded by former students, so I’m afraid I can’t do that” Harry said and smirked.
While Potter argued with Connor, Draco walked closer to the burnt wood and was about to touch it, when an old woman suddenly appeared next to him. If he wouldn’t have known that he was in a Muggle village, he would have guessed she had apparated there.
Aaron’s silence made Draco feel slightly bad for Potter. No it actually made him feel awful for the Gryffindor. He wasn’t sure what he was supposed to do now.
Draco raised his eyebrows and sighed. “How about I’m not going?” Looking up, he frowned when he realized that he had already started to talk to himself. Throwing the invitation onto the table again, he grabbed his jacket and walked to the floo, heading to Pansy.
Edit: Thank you so much for understanding! I already have something in the works, it just needs to be confirmed and then we'll see. Thank you!!! <3
“Is that a black sea? Like the shadow?” Lily asked with big eyes and Harry chuckled and shook his head.
Draco chuckled and snuggled even closer to Harry. “Yes, it would be interesting.” He turned to Harry and smiled softly. “Despite the fact that we’d learn something new, it would look rather suspicious if we would be done within ten minutes, especially after all the things we’ve said and done so far.”
Draco snorted, while he got up to greet his father with a hug. “They haven’t lived here for a while now, Sev. And no, how can it be boring with a very interested girl and a husband like that?”
“We would give you a room off to the side of the Common Room, where you could live” was McGonagall’s answer.
Harry chuckled. “Thank you, love.” Before he could continue, Draco narrowed his eyes and decided he needed a few more answers.
Draco was by now at a stage, where he was only glaring at the Injury Parchment wordlessly. These damn relatives. Cooking at an age of 5? Mopping the floors? He was being treated worse than a house elf! At least house elves were treated and healed if they hurt themselves (which only occurred once every 100 years). This should have by no means been the injury list of the Holy and Saint Harry James Potter.
“Draco, don’t turn to starve yourself over losing Harry” Theodore said. He was sitting on the opposite side of Draco and pushed some eggs and bacon closer to his plate.
While Harry was still lost in his thoughts, Hermione chuckled. “In any case we figured out that the sand is explosive if it comes to specific movement.” She then frowned. “At least I think that’s what I remember.”
Sadly, just then, Molly walked in and had heard their discussion. She cleared her throat and shook her head. “Harry dear, you can absolutely go and play Quidditch with everyone else if you want to” she said and walked back into the kitchen.
“Black coffee is fine.” Why did he have the need to not be complicated? He would have liked to go for some tea now, but… something was holding him back.
Severus Snape shall receive the patents for the Skele-Grow and Pepperup Potion. I’m not such a good Potioneer and I do believe that under your watchful eye, you could increase these helpful potions much better than I ever would.  From the stories I heard about the founding patriarch of my family, I think he would like to have someone to actually work with them again and improve them. I hope you see this as a peace offer.
Harry nodded. “Especially since nobody knows for sure that I am gay. Well” he grinned. “Almost nobody.”
“Well, I do have my good days.” Harry smirked and took another sip of his tea. This seemed to finally calm his stomach and he heaved a sigh of relief.
“Too pureblooded?” Potter asked and chuckled, when Draco frowned at him. “Oh trust me, your mother tries the same with me.”
“So, Rose was gay?” Harry asked and looked up at Draco. That didn’t seem like the right answer and Malfoy carefully placed the parchment on the floor again.
Pansy frowned. “Conceited? Draco, come on.” She chuckled a little. “They’re just pureblood standards. Do you want to tell me that Jason is conceited as well? He’s very proud of his pureblood traditions.”
He had landed probably half a second earlier to someone calling his name and as he turned around, he saw Fleur standing at the doorway smiling at him. She looked relaxed, though heavily pregnant. Her hair was in a high pony-tail and she was wearing a summer dress.
His best friend since childhood seemed to understand what he was talking about and when Harry turned around, she looked down and frowned. “Harry James Potter, you are not leaving here!”
The other Gryffindor in the kitchen laughed and rolled his eyes, while Harry whistled for Padfoot. Draco ruffled his fur while he walked by and stepped back deeper into the kitchen. Meanwhile, Neville grabbed Harry’s arm and looked at Draco, who raised his wand.
“I love you” he murmured and looked over his shoulders, seeing the light skin – even whiter than usual in the moon’s light.
So, Harry rolled his eyes and decided to be a little forthcoming. “Fine.” He pulled the ring out of his pockets making sure to hide Draco’s name on the inside with rather strong magic and placed it onto the table. “I’m married.”
Nodding once, Draco smiled and bowed slightly. Harry copied his action, and while they smiled at each other, Draco turned and walked out the door as fast as it was possible for him to do without making anybody suspect something.
Whether Potter had found the thing he was looking for or he just wasn’t feeling up to anything, the pub stayed closed and he was hiding in his room all evening long. Draco had left the house rather quickly after their discussion and sat on the hill, frowning at everything that had happened today. Had Potter fallen in love with Benjamin Brown? He had been here for two days! This made no sense.
Otherwise, I can tell you that coming Tuesday my schedule is back to normal and I should have a little more time on my hands. But I really do want to answer your questions and comments, so please bear with me... :)
Harry frowned. It seemed as if Draco was trying to tell him something with this, but he couldn’t find the solution to this riddle. What had happened down there? Hermione and Ron had come to talk to him and tell him how stupid he was and then left to find the Minister, who for some weird reason (probably since Nicolai planned it) not in the Ministry that day. Ginny had stayed back and asked him whether or not he had done it for…
“Well, he has paid off all his depth and more. Even though he didn’t really had to do so anyway” Kingsley smiled, still clearly impressed of what his Aurors had done. “And that brings me to Pansy Parkinson. I’ve heard you’re taking interest in her estate in Cornwall? Why would that be the case?”
Nodding, Draco grabbed the tray of beer and walked over to the men. Ever since then he had never sat down until Potter closed and locked the doors at one a.m. and he fell groaning into a chair, eyes almost closed.
Nodding over enthusiastically, Harry ran through the living room and fell into Eric’s hug. Alamar’s husband looked at him, smiling, and then grabbed the child and pulled him into his arms. The four of them left the house and walked over to their old house.
When Draco reached the top, he stopped, panting, and leaned onto his knees. “Oh, I’m getting to old for this!”
When McGonagall finally led them out of the room, Draco hid from Pansy and Harry let Hermione join Ron, so they were the only two left.
Hermione shook her head and turned to him. “Reading is important if you want to learn stuff, Ron. We need to learn every day of our life. So don’t you dare throw around more paper or books!
The Slytherin got up again and brushed some laughter tears out of his face. “First of all, it’s called ‘revenge’ and secondly, Potter,” his eyes were shining as if they wanted to turn into the sun during this snowy day. “Secondly, you needed something to distract you from all these pictures in your head.”
He still brought over a few glasses, pouring whatever red wine he had chosen inside and handed out the glasses to Neville, Hannah, Blaise, Pansy, Daphne and finally Harry. He looked slightly questioning and Harry rolled his eyes, his eyes briefly stopping on the cup of tea Hermione was trying to clean up right now.
Draco shook his head. “No. But I can wait for a little more now. Where are you going?” he repeated and chuckled when Harry blushed slightly. He really had turned into some kind of a pureblood wizard. Only they would feel ashamed for not having answered all the questioned asked in one turn.
Now even Weasley started talking. “In second year, his uncle installed bars at his window, so he couldn’t get away. And they locked all his things into the cupboard under the stairs. He wasn’t allowed to do any homework. And he…” wetting his lips, Weasley looked at the floor. There was something that he really didn’t seem to want to talk about. However, he still started again. “There was a dog flap at the door. His relatives pushed food…”
“You need to think Slytherin, Draco! That could actually help you getting through the next months. Being friends with the Golden Boy could help you in all kind of ways. Maybe you could get your father out of Azkaban or…”
The server nodded and motioned to the cake. “You can just come up and get whatever you’d like and we’ll bring it to the table.”
“Oh, I have power over you now!” Charlie called out, before he got a snowball at the back of his head and turned around. Harry caught two children running away from the door and Charlie smirked. “If you excuse me now, Harry, I have to teach some children a lesson.” He got up and walked to the door, before he stopped and turned back to Harry. “You’ll get the tickets tomorrow by owl.”
Chuckling, Eric kissed his cheek, probably knowing exactly what he was thinking about, while Harry seemed to marvel about that information.
“Can you stay, please?” Dominique asked, with so much hope in her voice that Harry could see his husband melting away. His soft eyes to her as he agreed to stay for dinner was just too cute.
Draco chuckled and shook his head. “Alright. I’ll go get dressed for this special dinner invitation.” He rolled his eyes, while Pansy patted his shoulders.
McGonagall agreed with his godfather and added: “I would have gladly given Miss Granger or Mr. Weasley the obligation to look after their friend, however, the Magical Guardian’s Test has the highest power. So, until he’s reached his actual age again, you’re his guardian.”
It only took them about two hours until they were gone and nobody but Boy had seen a thing. First, he had been working in the kitchen, then in the garden. Things needed to be nice, when Uncle Vernon would come home. They had once again a party where Boy had to pretend not to exist. Not that it was hard. He actually preferred it that way – he didn’t had to hide in his cupboard but was imprisoned in the attic, where he could lie in front of the window for all eternity, if it came down to it.
Mrs Williams smiled slightly. “I have known your real name ever since you first came to stay here. The Prophet had been talking about you and your mission to find The Boy Who Lived for a while now. Well, actually, for the last few months the articles were more about what Harry Potter had done for the Slytherins so far.”
“Oh, and he left a few profiles for your newest client on your desk. I told him to wait, since you might have a better grasp on things, but he really wanted to try it” Maria chuckled and turned to the phone which started ringing just then.
The wind blew Draco’s hair into his face, but Potter tucked it all away and smiled at the Slytherin. “It’s not optimism, Benjamin. It’s hope.”
Theodore shrugged his shoulders again. There seemed to be a lot theory going around. “As Pansy said, we’re talking about Potter not anybody else. I doubt that even his friends know everything he went through.”
Draco seemed to finally relax, when Harry cleaned it the second time around and moved his massage to his shoulders and the upper back. His husband let his head fall back into Harry’s lap.
Evan threw the roses at the wall and stomped passed Draco with a glare that could have killed Death itself. “You are the worst person alive, Draco Malfoy! I hate you!”
Harry rolled his eyes. “I thought I’d just arrive here next year and be the headmaster. And I’d have to figure out everything by myself. That was usually how things were going throughout my life.”
Harry has finally turned thirteen – a while ago actually – and I’ve taught him the Patronus. It feels weird since I know you’ve been the one to teach him when he was younger. As a matter of fact that is also one of the reasons I’m writing you today.
“If it were still alive, I would have told McGonagall about it a few hours ago.” Harry laughed. Looking around, nobody seemed to have anything against it, so Harry led them through the castle. Not before they all brought Dag up to the owlery, where he seemed scared at first, but then quickly seemed to make a few owl friends. On their way to wherever Harry was leading them, it was mostly quiet, a few fifth years studying in a corner, other students talking while they walked by.
Today, I’m feeling nothing. Absolutely nothing. I’ve never had a day like this: I’m not even feeling okay, I’m just… here. At least my headache is gone for once.
Pansy nodded. “It was all over the news! People thought you were dead before and then we get that. It was awesome and even better to see the Death Eaters freak out over how you’d gotten away.” She grinned and Harry laughed.
side, my family chose to run away to Egypt, where I met my husband.” She hesitated and shrugged then. “Actually, that was where I met my first husband, and then I moved to Germany after my divorce.”
Nodding, Draco turned around, but waited a second, before looking back at her. “You’re a witch, aren’t you?”
“How did he react then, when the call came?” he asked instead, hoping Ron would tell him that Draco said something about him maybe and that he could start to accuse Draco of having an affair. Which in turn should make someone else speak up and say that Harry had gone to a lover and give Draco some much needed fake anger and hopefully make them fight each other again. Harry couldn’t stop it. Even if he wanted to – which of course he didn’t.
His father couldn’t be so cruel, right? Draco shook his head. “But the Christmas Masquerade Ball is in seven days!” Draco looked at his mother for some help, though she seemed far too interested by what was in his shop window and he sighed. There was no other option. Apparently, he needed to change his approach to the matchmaker thing. “Fine” he relented. There was no other way out of it.
Shaking his head, Draco politely denied. “No thank you. I know people like to have your new things: I’m much more of an old sentimental person. And I think my ward would be happy with that as well.”
Kingsley sighed and shook his head. “Seamus, where were you? I will tell you what happened after we have everyone’s whereabouts.”
“I’ve said it before, Potter, and I’ll say it again: I’m not your dad!” Draco sighed, when Blaise smirked.
Ginny’s saying had messed with his head. Nobody who had fought the war had won. The good side had lost a lot of good people: One of the explosions had also almost killed one of the twins and had left him in a coma for half a year. The bad side... his side. They had lost so much, though most of all: honour. As if they’d had any to begin with. Draco snorted and shook his head.
Silence. No one said anything. Everyone stood there, mouth agape, not sure what to say. Yes, even Draco hadn’t known how to react to it. He had never in his life cursed that much! After he had found out he would have liked to punch everyone! But he had to stay strong for Harry.
His friends sat behind the book cases, well Theodore, Blaise and Millicent were. Theodore had a few novels next to him and he seemed to try and figure out which he wanted to read. Draco wondered how he found time to read other things except school notes. Blaise and Millicent were discussing something from Potions, which Draco had not bothered to figure out. He waved at them, before heading to Pansy’s room. In fact, he found her there, lying on her bed, a pillow on her chest and a somewhat sad expression on her face.
Ron walked up to them with a piece of paper in his hands. “McGonagall just left the activities for every day here. Take a look” he said and shoved the paper into Harry’s hands. Neville looked over his shoulder and read with him.
Harry snorted and quickly recounted what their discussion had been like. Draco laughed loudly and shook his head. “And here I thought I had to make the first step to make it look like we hate each other! You’re a genius, Harry Potter.”
Draco smirked, as if he was sure that Harry was lying to his face and shrugged his shoulders. “Come get me once it’s over.”
Draco’s assessment had been right, though he would have never guessed who would answer next. “Draco, darling!” he heard Neil from the phone.
Severus brought him out of his mind. “Frankly, I have no idea what will be changing. It could only be small features or you could be taller, shorter…”
“Hermione, this doesn’t make sense!” Ron growled and brought Harry out of his state of mind. He looked up to find his friend about to throw the book around. “Why would they start a law against whatever these blood potions are, when they haven’t even been tested by that time?!”
Severus entered about one minute later, looking rather annoyed. When he saw the toddler on the bed, his expression immediately changed and Draco hated himself for wondering why he would do something like that. What had happened between the two of them that something like that happened?! He looked so worried as if... as if he actually cared.
“What do you mean by that?” Harry shook his head and the Slytherin rolled his eyes, as if it was Harry who was the idiot here… Maybe he actually was?
He was missing something. Something seemed off. He couldn’t find the people who had moved into the house Mrs Figg had had. Frowning, he walked back to the table and leaned over it to look for one specific parchment.
Eric rolled his eyes, knowing very well that Alamar was absolutely not going to waste any food. He grabbed the almost empty watering pot and poured it out over the grass when he walked to the other end of the garden to pour some water in.
Harry snorted, while Neville managed to hide his amusement rather well. Draco’s eyes were sparkling for a second, before he turned to the running Slytherin. “We don’t need that, thank you. We’re perfectly happy!”
“Oh, it’s nothing really…” He hadn’t intended on letting anybody else know, but the way she looked at him, rather demanding, he sighed again. “Hermione gave me a love… a fertility potion. I assume by accident.”
Wow, he had always assumed that Potter was arrogant, but not like that. Naming himself ‘King’? There were a thousand better names he could have come up with.
Chuckling, Pansy shrugged her shoulders. “I know, darling. But I think we should start small. So, maybe tell him to make his bed every morning. Then, we’ll go bigger, clean up the Common Room – with our help of course – and then… I don’t know.”
“No!” Pansy jumped up and stared at Harry as if he had lost his mind. Even Draco widened his eyes and was at a loss for words. Bloodquills had been stated illegal after the law of 1974, where a pureblood patriarch had used it to torture his entire family. Before, they had been very helpful if you were in combat and had no actual time to write your last will. Every soldier, every wizard in danger had kept a bloodquill just in case one needed to quickly rewrite his or her will, before one was killed.
“Mr. Potter’s age is reversed to when he felt his life fall apart. Unsurprisingly, it was when he was fifteen months old and he is now around ten months old. However, his mind is still working fine and didn’t get any damage” she explained.
“What?” Draco turned to look at Harry and shook his head. “I basically killed every potential I had in the world and you tell me it was noble?”
As they entered the Great Hall, Draco caught McGonagall’s amused expression and he smirked himself. Harry was feeling awesome and there was nothing he would change about how much more alive his ward was today.
Harry shrugged his shoulders. “My pizzeria has a problem. When I’m back home later, I’ll look into that as well.”
“Can I be your DADA professor, Harry?” he almost begged. “I promise to prepare for all the classes and do whatever it takes for the students to pass…”
Before Draco could say the password for the entrance, the stairs appeared and someone was walking down. That someone turned out to be a very familiar face.
“What?” the Saviour seemed honestly surprised. “Why?” He caught himself and flushed a little, before turning back to his work. “You don’t have to tell me, if you don’t want to.”
Potter and Lucas laughed, before they hugged and the farmer bid goodbye. So, Potter walked over to them and put his arms around Draco’s waist, pulling him towards himself. Draco startled from the sudden contact, but turned around laughing. He nestled against the other man.
“I don’t think I’ll ever visit you or Draco once I have children. Dray, Christmases will be held without your boyfriend here!” Pansy pointed at Harry smirking. He laughed and almost choked on his food, when he tried to swallow the piece of toast in his mouth.
Harry smiled weakly. “Can you show me how to do the Patronus? I know that it’s supposed to be not that hard and I can do it very well, but I have trouble starting with it.”
Harry nodded. “Do you remember how I told you about the Horcruxes? Dumbledore knew I was one and he realized the only way to… get the Horcrux out of me would be by…”
“Hi Harry” Ron grinned. “I just had to tell ‘Mione that you should have been just five minutes behind us. Why are you only coming in now?” He had a knowing grin and if Harry hadn’t known it better, he would have assumed that he already knew that Draco and he had had sex before.
Harry chuckled and shook his head. When Padfoot looked at him a little questioningly, Harry ruffled his fur. “We’re going to have a little fun for a week, Padfoot. I’m sure you can appreciate that and I’m also sure that your dad will have a lot of time to play with you.”
“What’s going on?” He frowned at them, realizing that Potter had killed the Dark Lord. No need to panic then… Wait, maybe something was wrong with his ward! “Is Potter alright?”
‘Callum’ the fish introduced himself and they swam to the school, where Ravo was then happily reunited with his brothers and they got to go home early so that Ravo’s mother wouldn’t freak out over him being gone.
school for witchcraft and wizardry with a lot of people looking at it for advice and strength… How could he take over something like that?!
“Good evening, Bridger! Long time no see!” Draco called out and the snoring gentleman on the rocking chair jerked up. He adjusted his glasses and took a closer look at Draco.
Harry could have sworn that there were tears hiding in his husband’s eyes. Draco nodded wordlessly and snuggled into his side, their bodies the same way as when the therapist had walked into the room. Harry just pulled him closer, letting him know that he was there for him. Nothing would ever happen to him.
“Severus, I am so glad you came to look for me. Is there something I can help you with?” Albus asked and sat down by his desk again, while his servant frowned and shook his head, sitting down as well.
Ron frowned. “You should stop thinking that, Harry.” He looked into the living room and smiled. “What you don’t see is how he looks at you, when you’re not looking at him.”
“And loved?” Draco asked with a rough voice. His grey eyes turned to look at him and they were almost begging him to agree to that.
Harry smirked. “Well, I am ready to do whatever it takes to make my husband happy.” He looked at his Slytherin warmly. “You’re everything to me. I’d go through hell just to be with you.”
Draco looked up to see Blaise wet from heads to toe, Harry holding a bucket in his hands and with broad grin on his face. He was laughing loudly and Blaise looked at his clothes bewildered, before he got up.
Kevin laughed and shook his head. “I know. That’s the one thing we’re not getting to. There’s so much going on every day that between meetings and sometimes even wedding preparations, we can’t better our marketing.”
Harry felt Malfoy walk up next to him and he could smell the fragrance Malfoy used so much better in this small room. It made him shudder slightly.
that attention – which was rather new to him. Finally, it was Theodore who broke the stunned, amazed and irritated silence.
Neville was still around and he saw Teddy almost every other weekend when he visited Andromeda. Surely, his godson was enough to live for, right?
Walking over, he pulled Harry into a close hug and kissed his earlobe. “Why are you looking at me like that, my brave little lion?”
Smirking, Draco decided to explain: “We went to Oliver, Pans. He has a huge book of potential names and their meanings. Harry just looked at them and… decided on taking one right there, didn’t you?” he turned to his ward.
So while he walked along the water, watching the waves softly hit the stony beach, his best friends finally reached him and Ron held his wrist back, effectively stopping him from continuing to walk. As Harry turned back to his friends, he caught sight of the castle mounted on rocks and smiled softly. The castle already looked like a movie star from down here and with the huge rocks sticking out from under it, Harry couldn’t keep his eyes off it.
“The Weasley-Granger household." Noticing that Oaskar was about to object, he added some more information. "I’m looking for Potter.”
Smiling at his boyfriend, Draco leaned back into his arms. “I think I’ll accept. I’m also done with it today and now.”
Draco jumped up and pulled him into a hug, before he could get away. His warm body so close, the scent of his aftershave and the calming motion of Draco’s hand stroking over his back was enough to completely break Harry.
Shaking his head, he let go of the backpack and fell into the bed. He was asleep before he could even form a decent thought.
“Oh, it was disguised as tea” Harry clarified. “And Draco thinks she just looked up which love potions there were and never considered asking her husband or any other pureblood for help.”
Harry climbed up on one of the stairs and looked at what Alamar was creating. It felt weird not being the one to make food, but whenever he had been with Eric and Alamar, they never let him touch anything in the kitchen that wasn’t food. It was a welcomed change from what he had to do in the Dursley’s household.
“Oh, come on, Harry. We all know it!” That betrayal actually stung. Why did Ron turn into such an idiot with Nott close by? He knew the answer, but he had at least wanted Ron to stick a little bit with him.
The Slytherin sighed. “I wish. Actually, yes I am, but this house is annoying me. How come it’s so well secured? I mean, I’ve once seen something so well secured, when my mother incanted her diary with DNA, when I tried to read it.”
“I did” Draco smirked. “I promised him the empty international researcher seat. And I made sure to tell him that you were thinking about giving it to him anyways, but that now I could be the one to have given him the promotion.”
Eric hit him over the head with a chocolate bar that broke into two pieces, while he snorted. Harry laughed, probably over Eric’s surprised expression that the chocolate bar actually broke into pieces. “It’s a day school. So Harry will still be with us every day.”
The house vibrated a little, as if to say ‘you’re welcome’ and calmed down again. Harry smiled and climbed into the room completely, closing the door behind himself. He lay onto the floor and stared at the night sky.
“Okay. So, what does he do then?” He decided to go with what Harry wanted. It wouldn’t make sense to talk to him about that right now. They were inventing a story.
Before he could say anything, Harry pulled out a wand. He placed a spell on his crossbreed and put his fingers up to his mouth. “Don’t talk.” He then took out a small vial. “Take this.”
. Was everyone reading Potion’s books right now? It did make sense since they had a quiz the next lesson and nobody was sure how evil their professor was going to be.
The older gentlemen, which Draco suddenly recognized as William Butler, the town’s self proclaimed mayor, bid goodbye to everyone, paid his drinks and went on his merry way while the woman joined Draco at the other side of the bar.
In all honesty, Harry had already decided to give him that space, though he didn’t have time to talk with him before they had to leave for Hogwarts. Despite the fact that this wouldn’t be the best time to talk to his employee – should Draco actually have chosen him – Harry would make sure to tell him somehow he’d get the new job. In addition, Raphaél had the best kind of humor and always challenged Draco’s or sometimes even Harry’s jokes and pranks.
Well, not that Harry cared much. Hermione had been right before, Slughorn really seemed like the guy to change something he didn’t like. And if that was the case, he needed to get some more knowledge in Potion’s.
Draco hugged his ward and they walked out again like ghosts. Well, since the ghosts in the corner had not realized anything. When Draco led his ward to the Hospital Wing, he grinned a little. “You liked the Patronus cats?”
About five seconds later, Malfoy looked up and grinned. “I’m thinking, if we have to stay inside here, I can at least run some tests on the potions here and see what they are. These are some incredibly strong potions if they’ve been able to stay good all this time.”
Harry crossed the estate and opened the stable doors where Pansy was singing to some music from her phone, while cleaning the boxes. Smirking, he walked in and knocked at the walls, where Pansy was jerking up.
Charlie held out a potion. “This is Memento Mei” she said, looking at Draco and then at Harry. “It’s a potion which is supposed to give the brain a little nudge into opening closed off sections, such as memories.”
Theodore snickered. “Draco, did you hear? Potter can put objects into a box!” He said it as if it was a surprise to everyone that the savior was able to do something. His friends laughed, though Draco didn’t join them.
His home looked… normal. Still cold, unwanted to all kinds of visitors and it still seemed to have an air of death around it. Great thing to get a relationship back on track.
Before he could go through the other ones, he checked his watch and jumped up. Almost too late again.
As always, Draco seemed to have read his mind as he grinned knowingly and shrugged his shoulders. “I want you…” he paused winking at Harry with the eyes that was turned away from their classmates, so only he could see it. This man was driving him wild and mad with heat. “… to understand where I’m coming from!”
“Well then, let’s get this started” Severus said and chuckled as they entered the store. “Bridger, guess who’s here?”
“Leave!” Blaise called and pushed Harry and Draco out of the front entrance. “I want to show my new best friend Hogwarts’ secrets!”
He nodded at her and walked up to his own Dormitory, thinking about the best option in having Malfoy asking
Harry sighed. “Well, I’ve tried to get Lancaster to release the estate to her, but he won’t. All Death Eater estates will be sold by next week. I promised Pansy to get her the estate back, so I’m buying it back.”
Harry smiled though he would have loved to tell him he was one of the people that left him behind and just continued with business as usual. He didn’t do that, mostly because he didn’t want to cause a scene in front of Luna and Ginny.
“That’s tremendous!” Pansy called out and chuckled, before she was hit by mud from Harry who giggled.
“Merlin!” Harry laughed and with a wave of wandless and actually motionless magic, the Kneazel floated over onto his own lap. “What is your wish? You already had things to eat, today.”
Harry chuckled and looked back at the wall with pictures only now realizing that these were in fact Muggle pictures. They weren’t moving, yet still so alive and impressing.
“Draco, do you think it might be possible to see my parent’s grave? Can I go there? You… You don’t have to go there with me, but I just…”
The guard muttered something and turned back to the others. They talked about something, though Harry really couldn’t focus any longer. He had been out of his house for far too long. His legs felt like he was walking through marsh, and his vision was getting worse and worse. He just wanted to go back home and sleep for the next five hours.
While Harry grabbed the plate (Theodore handing him the nutrition potion), Draco made a mental note to go to the Hospital Wing as soon as he had time. He had a lesson this afternoon, but after he was free and he was definitely going to look at the Injury Parchment. It didn’t feel good.
Harry rubbed his forehead, accidentally spreading the ink to his head as well. “Hi Dray, why are you still awake?”
“Around thirty items and no, not everything should make you throw up.” Draco raised his eyebrows as if he had already anticipated that question, which was fair. Harry had just opened his mouth to ask that exact question.
“Oh yeah” Harry sighed. “I totally forgot all about you being Benjamin. Did you write about that in your letter as well?”
“Fair point” he said and shrugged his shoulders. “So, Harry, can I ask you something?” Blaise seemed a little thoughtful, and Harry nodded, waiting for him to sort out his thoughts. “Okay, so, I’ve heard you’re taking over Hogwarts for sure, yeah?”
“Trap. I couldn’t quite see what happened. I just heard Ron calling for help before he lost consciousness.” Harry shook his head, a weird head ache getting stronger and stronger.
As he walked out of his room, rather surprised that he could walk without any problem, he found Draco fast asleep over his journal with the kitchen light on. He had almost reached the end of it, though from the looks of it, he had probably forgotten everything he had read the last few pages. Smiling softly, Harry walked over to the cupboard.
Getting up, Draco walked over to Harry and took one vial. “Well, I’m not. I’ll make you something that helps you and isn’t going to kill you.”
Nodding, Harry took a towel and started drying the plates. “He’s seen me at my darkest and he still decides to be there for me. For the better part of our relationship he didn’t even try to question me about what happened in England. He just let me be... me.”
Nodding, the blond Healer called for two nurses who quickly took Ron away and stabilized him with the help of Malfoy’s charts. Harry saw him being rolled into the first room on the right.
Minerva chuckled. “There’s still a third option, Harry. This one is usually reserved for professors with families – children to be exact. It’s a sort of external living arrangement. Basically, the professors have a few nights where they have to be on duty, up to three a month, as well as set office hours, usually up around dinner. The rest of their free-time, they spend at home.”
Potter’s ex, Ian, stood in front of the door as soon as the Gryffindor opened the pub. “Hello, Sirius” the git said smiling his fake smile. “I’ve decided to come here and taste your food today.”
Once they were all gone – the two other Aurors as well, Kingsley started talking again. “Harry’s relatives have been placed in magical care; however, we believe that there is no hope for any of them. His uncle is but a vessel of himself and his aunt has had some serious trauma as well. Once Harry’s grown up, you might have to tell him what happened.”
With what little strength he had left, he apparated himself and Draco right into his living room. After that, he closed the wards with a flick of his hand. Draco stood there, still in dog form, staring at him as if he couldn’t understand what just happened.
Ron wants to know when you’re paying him back the money for getting you out of prison. Alternatively, he also suggested accepting your Merlin First Class, should you wish to part ways. Teapot, if you give him the medal, I WANT the Moontrimmer!
So, today is the best day! Ginny came by and she handed me a puppy! It’s a Muggle service dog, apparently and she’s trained to help people who can’t walk that well. Her name is Nora and she’s a Husky-Golden Retriever Crossbreed. She is the cutest thing I have ever seen!
Harry tilted his head and smirked slightly. “Draco, you need to get out of your comfort zone, which is the exact reason why we’re travelling like Muggles. And your comfort zone also includes being able to talk to everyone – we need to change that as well.”
While Alamar ruffled through Harry’s hair, Eric smiled at his little family. Well, even though Eric didn’t like his fairy family, it didn’t mean that his own was problematic. In fact, he had asked his partner for years upon years to start a small one. Alamar had always said that they didn’t have time for a child. And also… to think that his husband had always tried to counter with the fact that he wouldn’t know how to behave around a child was completely out of his head.
“What did I do?” Draco looked up confused, while he fed Teddy another spoon full of carrot-puree. Remus shook his head, while Harry was uncontrollably laughing behind their former teacher’s back and almost couldn’t stop, when he poured the hot chocolate into three cups.
“Playing with the children” Hermione rolled her eyes. “Ron gave them a toy broom and now she’s racing them.”
“Och, Ah ken whit ye pure techt! We hae a new collection, unicorn hair. Woods 'at be interestin' tae ye?”
“Absolutely” Harry grabbed a small business card and placed it in front of them. “She’s a close friend of mine and would be happy to hear from you.”
Nature had started to take back the old village. Houses were greener, grass and flowers growing on the inside. Vines were creeping up the wooden walls and a shy fox was running into one of the houses. Birds were singing, a stag roared through the near woods and a raccoon rummaged through the long forgotten garbage cans.
“Hey there!” He kneeled next to Potter and smiled softly. “We have to leave in a few minutes, bear. Can you get your pants?”
Boy nodded and took the garbage, dragging it behind him over the grass and successfully put it into the bin out front. However, he did lose the lid and it made some noise. He quickly caught it and placed it on top of the bin, walking back into the garden and picked up the spray for plants.
“I…” Harry didn’t know what to say. This wasn’t really what he had in mind for his life. “I don’t think I can do that” he said carefully. He narrowed his eyes and looked at his tea, when he suddenly had a very, very bad idea. Actually a good one…
Living with Severus for the past week had been absolutely awesome! However, Draco really wanted to get his own place and he couldn’t wait until Pansy was back from her parent’s, when they could look at the place Harry had told them about.
Malfoy smirked. “It absolutely did. They were screaming at me to open the door, since apparently, the house isn’t opening any other rooms and not even the cupboards can be opened. I tried to open the door, but the house then took away all the possibilities of opening the door. So, they’re basically locked behind magical walls, they can’t use magic to get out.”
This was the point, he thought, as he watched two of the burlier clowns lead Ginny away, where she should shout "And I would have gotten away with it too if it weren't for you meddling kids!" Or where Surly O'Sullivan would tap the notebook closed with his wand, extinguish the lights in his office and go to the pub and get hammered while pondering the human condition.
"Calm down; Pansy fire called me while you were performing miracles with eyeliner and let me know she'd arranged a room for you at the Colchester in Zurich, where you are on unexpected business for an indeterminate time. Should Harry check, Maggie will back you up."
The band was successful enough for each member to warrant his own suite, so once Draco closed the door and locked it, the Do Not Disturb sign hanging prominently on the doorknob, he was alone – a rare treat. At least that's what he told himself. If he was truthful, which he never was, he would have to admit that he hated being alone. He especially hated being alone in London, a city that seemed to mock his single status by reminding him that his phantom man should be here, should be in his suite with him, and eventually in his bed with him. And he wasn't, probably never would be.
Draco sighed; he'd figured this was coming. He'd thought a lot about it, and still didn't have a good answer. That is, he had one, but he hated it – and knew Harry would too. But it was all he had.
In Harry's drunken mental meanderings over the years, he had even wondered what had happened to Draco – if he was now the entitled, spoiled, petulant Lord of Malfoy Manor, instead of the entitled, spoiled, petulant heir to said Mansion. He'd not bothered to keep up with wizarding society once he'd bailed out of Auror training for a life of sloth and vice, so unless Hermione fed him some juicy news on her increasingly infrequent visits, he was out of the loop. And he liked it that way. It kept him out of trouble, and kept him from thinking too hard about things that shouldn't be thought of at all.
And as soon as he could, he would head home to his Harry – his sloppy, unkempt, tipsy, horrible housekeeper of a lover who made him feel like no one else ever could: complete.
"She deserves a raise." Draco started to rub his face, but remembered the eyeliner at the last minute.
"My Draco.” Harry paused. "My Draco, by my count, fucked about 24 men in a month -  one or two were repeat visitors, and this in addition to still fucking me, the randy bastard."
Harry just barely managed to wipe the extremely pissed-off look from his face as he emerged. Dumbledore put a fatherly arm around his shoulder and encouraged the audience to show their appreciation for the brave airborne boy and the Squib who couldn't count. Filch glowered, and Harry was tempted to flip him off behind the Ringmaster's back, but refrained. He glanced over at Draco who was hopping up and down, crossing his legs, and scowled again. Great.
Draco closed his eyes tightly; the pain he felt and that seeped through the cracks in his demeanor was almost too much to bear, but he had to bear it. He had caused this; him and him alone. "Harry, I'm sorry," he whispered. "I really and truly am. You aren't a diversion - you're everything."
Of course, others seemed to know what to do with their hands just fine; like grope him, fondle his arse, or "accidentally" rub against his crotch. At first it had been fun, different - he felt like he was getting one over on Malfoy-that-cheating-bastard and living a little. Now he knew that it wasn't living at all.
"Bill, really. And do stop fussing with your hair." Molly looked around to check the whereabouts of the rest of her brood; Ron was present and accounted for, as were Bill and, oh, Charlie…Arthur, Ginny, yes, right here and the twins were down with Dumbledore. She could just barely make out Percy hiding behind the giant spider, and Harry…Harry was near the clowns, where he had, not coincidentally, a rather splendid view of Draco Malfoy's arse. She sighed, knowing the centerfolds were in for it tonight.
"Great." He sighed. "Sorry, Blaise – it’s not you, I appreciate this, really. It just all feels so fake. Why can't he talk to me? Why won't he accept my apology? Why? I don't get this! I've tried over and over and I want to tell him how much I love him and miss him and he doesn't even want to hear it." He bit down on his lip.
Their hearts slowly resumed their normal rates as they stood there, impaled and enmeshed in each other for long moments, until someone banged on the door. "You gonna be in there forever or what?"
"Yes." Harry had found the page he wanted, where Surly explained the major rules of wizarding investigation.
"With Weasley?" Draco couldn't believe his voice sounded hopeful that Harry might be with Weaselbee.
Or, right, Draco. Fuck. Harry wasn't with it enough yet to figure out if he could play cool or not, but knew that Malfoy wouldn't leave till he opened the door, at least.
He showered and shaved, shaking his head at the hair; he didn't give a shit what Blaise said – it was brown. It looked kind of cool, granted, but it was still brown. Jesus – the things he did for Potter. He hoped someday the other man would appreciate it. He thought a while about how to dress; he didn't want to look like he was trying to seduce Harry – that wasn't the point of all this. If it was the end result - but no. Sex wasn't the goal here, getting his boyfriend back, was.
"Dive?" Harry laughed. "I know the place, my mates and I have gone there a few times. It sounds great."
Harry went over to the liquor cabinet and poured himself a short scotch, neat, no ice, drinking it down in a couple of swallows, letting the burn soothe his muscles. He then crossed over to the closet and pulled out his leather jacket that Draco had gotten him to celebrate their first month together.
"Yes, he'll know. Look, if I went back to looking like Draco Malfoy, but acted like the person I've become - like Aaron - Harry would know something was wrong. And when he figured it out, he'd be pissed off all over again, that I was hiding something from him. Better to show up as me – him - and let the chips fall where they may. If he wants to hate me then, at least he'll know up front what I did to get him back."
Harry nodded; he'd thought the same thing. "You should go back and check on the animals, calm them down in your special Hagriddy way." Harry tried to smile, but it faltered.
So, he made his way down the Molensteeg, Gordinjninsteeg and Golderbergersteeg before finally coming to a stop in front of a window on the Enge Kirkesteeg. There, lounging on a battered black velvet daybed, was perhaps the most beautiful girl – or boy - that Harry had ever seen. She – Harry decided it had to be a she, because no He was that delicate – looked bored. Bored and perhaps a bit pouty as she absently played with a gold lip-ring, the small pink tongue licking and worrying the gleaming metal.
They both stood up and moved out onto the floor, finding a clear space and beginning to move; Draco tried hard not to dance the way he normally did, but that proved impossible. He loved dancing, was good at it, enjoyed the freedom of moving without thought, without plan. Harry though, he noted, was even better up close than from an aerial view; when the hell had he learned to move like that? He decided that if he and Harry managed to work things out, he was going to make him come out dancing at least two or three times a month.
one could replace Draco, and Harry knew enough to not even try. But for a little while, it had helped assuage his loneliness, helped him feel a little better - but it would never be enough to replace what was missing in his life.
"Charlie, there couldn't be a reward great enough to justify that." Harry shuddered and proceeded to take off his clothes. Someone was always naked at the Weasleys. Charlie watched him with brotherly approval. At least, Harry hoped it was just brotherly approval; he liked Charlie just fine, but his heart belonged to a snooty blond. He sighed. Charlie grinned.
They danced through four songs before deciding that more libations were in order; their table was still mercifully open, and Draco longed to cast a Silencing, but showing himself as a wizard would just would make the world a bit too small, too fast. So, he settled for sitting close so they could not have to yell so loudly into each other's ears.
"Theo will be, soon enough; then he'll come to you for a loan and you can have the fun of making him beg, the git. Now go."
"For gaining some personal space if nothing else." He could hear a small smile in Harry's voice, and he wordlessly offered him his pack, watching his hands as he pulled one out, tamped it and lit it with a practiced air. "Thank you."
Ooooh, Potter, wrong answer. Dammit, he'd never been good at open-ended questions; he was much more of a yes or no type of bloke.
Draco didn't think about his 'past life' much, but when he did, he only thought about one person, one man. But he was gone now, disappeared from the magical world, and for all Draco knew, from the physical world altogether. Even his few friends that still straddled both worlds – Pansy, Blaise – didn't know where he'd gone. So, he pushed the thought, the memory away; he had no use for fantasies anymore, anyway, cause reality was much more delicious and satisfying.
He hadn't ever sat in the audience before at any performance, and as he settled back with some popcorn under his Muggle baseball hat he thought this might even be fun.
Harry bit his lip for a second, then grinned. "Both? A mortal enemy who became someone very, very good."
"The rumors are true – as of tomorrow evening, the Tour will include the Marvelous Malfoys in all their splendor."
Except Ginny Weasley, who was still steaming over the events of the prior evening. She accosted Harry outside the cafeteria tent, still clutching a sticky bun. "Harry," she said, blocking his way, "We need to talk."
Draco wandered the paths of the graveyard; this place was spooky enough in the daytime, but it was downright terrifying at night. Bloody Gryffindor courage – Harry must need it to be able to come here. And of course, it had started raining, just enough to create a mist when the cool rain met with warm earth. Brilliant.
Harry shoved his hands back through his hair. "Ginny, there was never an "us." You wanted to think so, even after you knew I wasn't interested in you, or any girl, for that matter. I was never anything but honest with you, and the fact that you not only chose not to believe it, but actively try to hurt the person I
"She's a boy?" Harry wanted to be clear on this point. "Darcy is the one with the long blond hair, the black eyeliner, the lip ring and the legs that stretch to Belgium?"
Pansy was an extravagant, over-dramatic and occasionally annoying flake, decided Draco, but she did love him; he loved her too, and squeezed her hand, knowing she'd understand. She squeezed it back.
The lights dimmed and Dumbledore's voice boomed through the huge tent. "Welcome, welcome, one and all to the fabled Magical Mystery Tour, the finest show in Britain and Europe!" Cheers and applause greeted his words. From his vantage point, Harry grinned. He loved shows, and it never got old for him. He gave Ron a big thumbs-up and Ron signaled the same back.
"So wha…got two." For some reason, they both found that hysterical and laughed till they hiccupped helplessly, the bartender shaking his head at them in amusement. "Yeah, buh…still. Need both. So…"
"But I want him to be happy - I just want it to be with me." Harry's voice had grown small. "And he wasn't then, so why would he be now?"
This was certainly true; Harry was endlessly fascinated with how people hooked up, how the most unlikely folks found others to be with. It gave him hope for his future.
The big man nodded back and clomped back towards the animal cages and his own living tent. Harry pulled out his wand, for the clouds had scudded across the moon and it was now very dark out indeed.
"Yeah, like going out and enticing my boyfriend back by not being me but someone he might like better." The whole thought was depressing, and Draco swiftly downed another whiskey.
One night, Harry came home before dawn, and Draco, still awake, waited for him to slip into bed, then slid over to Harry, fitting himself against the sweet curve of his back, brushing his lips gently across the bared neck and reaching around to grasp Harry's cock. "Hey."
Predictably, Sirius’s stone was in the very last row, at the far end near the hulking black trees. Draco cautiously walked down the grassy slope and was absurdedly relieved to see a very familiar dark head bent over the stone.
Not just a lion tamer…but a chimera tamer. Not just a fire-breather, but a fire-eater. Not just an illusionist, but a master magician with a pet boggart. And not just clowns, but the most renowned clowns in Europe; the Fabulous Fossors. Some thought the Latin name a tad pretentious, but none could deny that they were, indeed, fabulous.
From the floor, from this perspective, he noted three things. One, Charlie's outfit really was indecent; two, Bill's hair did flow in a rather lovely fashion as he swung; and three, that Ginny Weasley really did have an overly large arse. It looked like someone had set a ripe pumpkin on a bar and sent it hurtling into space.
Harry was furious; his hands were shaking. He should just hang up, say fuck you, Malfoy. He should pack and move out. He should burn the place down along with all its memories. "Yeah, it was all to spite you! Of course it was! Nothing is about me, it’s all you, always you! Well you know what? I'M glad I found out about you, what you are! I'm glad I changed it all, the stupid goddamned hair, the clothes, everything! If it puts you off, so much the better! Then you can know what it’s like to not be wanted anymore!"
"So how is the fantabulously hot Draco Malfoy? You stuck to him like Ginny to a caramel apple all afternoon."
"Love IS risky, and besides, I actually kind of like this look now." He held up a hand to forestall Pansy's snort. "I know, all I did was complain at first, but I'm used to seeing me like this now and I don't mind, really."
Harry knew he shouldn't, but he couldn't help it. He looked at the history, which conveniently noted how many times a site had been visited. Thirty-two times in the last month alone - he'd gone there every bloody day, plus.
“I do mean it, and this isn’t guilt – well, not entirely. I realized tonight that I take you for granted, because you never let me down. And instead of being grateful and happy that you love me enough to do everything for me, I took it as my due. And that’s wrong. I’m the lucky one here, not you. You got no bargain with me. But I’m going to change that.”
He almost, Harry thought, almost sounded like Draco Malfoy. His voice didn't have the same sneering undertones, or the tinge of bitterness that he associated with Malfoy, but there was something about it nonetheless. And Milo was blond, too.
"What are you doing tonight?" He asked idly, checking his pockets for stray scraps of paper, change and the like.
After a few more rounds of verbal jousting with his hapless cubicle mate, Harry left and started walking home; Apparating still made him want to toss, and the tube was downright dangerous. Besides, he'd been banned for six months from going on the O-line after innocently asking a woman carrying batteries if she thought the 'O' stood for orgasm. He'd felt the bumps in the track, seen the batteries and come to a logical conclusion, or so he thought. She thought differently, and bada-boom, he was banned. Walking was healthier, anyway.
Harry leaned close; Draco smelled very good, and he was momentarily distracted, but soon righted himself. "Everyone.”
They both recognized each other's signs and didn't have to do more than mutter before they both came, at very nearly the same time, both of them straining and pulsing against each other, and to Draco, the sweetest sound ever heard was Harry gasping his name.
Draco was shaking now, all over, not just his hands. "I said I was sorry. I told you I was scared. Shit reason or no, it's the truth. Nothing, nothing Aaron…I…said was a lie. When he said he loved his boy, he did, and he does, more than anything else in this world. Life is nothing without his boy. When he said he'd been miserable and that it was his own bloody fault, he meant it. When he told you it wasn't you, it was his own fucking stupid scared self, he meant it. If you can't or won't see that, Harry; that I love you and there is nothing else for me than you, then there isn't anything more I can do. I just can’t.”
"So, did you get all your pictures? Are you satisfied with the pictorial of my life so that we can go on to have some fun?" He stood, Onyx jumping off his lap, and moved over to Harry, touching his cheek. "I have a feeling you're a brilliant kisser – are you?"
The "little rascal" was a hybrid of alligator and platypus and he didn't look, to Harry, as though "petting" was high on his agenda for the night. Thinking of petting made him think of Ginny and he grimaced. She had recently decided that she had a "massive, earth-shattering, life-altering" crush on him, and had taking to following him about, making suggestive remarks. He wasn't sure how to tell her that he a) thought of her as a sister b) had a thing for blonds and c) that the corndogs she favored were going straight to her arse. That last was of some concern because even Ron was having a tough time pulling her back up out of some dips and he worried that someday she'd pull him off the swing and down they'd go, arse over teakettle. He envisioned Ginny in a body cast, unable to follow him about, and smiled.
Draco's life wasn't quite – all right, not at all – what he had planned, either, but he was happy enough. He enjoyed dressing in leather, wearing eyeliner, and looking down into a sea of adoring fans. He liked going on tour, interviews where his every word was hung upon, and the plethora of free goodies that came his way. He liked taking a different pretty boy or girl to bed every night and then turning them loose the next day with a smile, autograph, and a promise (never kept) of looking them up the next time he was in town. He liked not having any ties.
going away and he really didn't want to be dancing the itchy-itchy jig when Draco "Why Yes, I Am A God" Malfoy showed up.
As people stampeded out in what was becoming an all-too-normal fashion, he turned to Harry. "Potter, God help me, but I think you're right about the-someone-trying-to-kill-me thing, not to be confused with any of your other crazy theories on life."<
Draco had been taken aback by Harry’s tone and had tried to make a joke. “The fucking you part sounds good…assuming that the “you” means “me” and means that you will soon be fuc…”
For someone who made his living tracking, pursuing and capturing bad, bad people, Harry had a rather terrible sense of direction and couldn't tell where he'd already been, but wasn't worried. He had time.
How Draco managed to get through the rest of the show, he never knew; all he could think later was that he obviously had a hell of an auto-pilot, because his band mates congratulated him afterwards on an over-the-top show. He himself remembered nearly nothing, save for the one pair of eyes he had stared into for too long a moment, seconds after he came on stage.
The lady looked him up and down. "Nr, maar ik kon een partij in uw broek beginnen, baby," she purred. Harry wasn't sure what that meant, and out of curiosity promptly whipped out his wand to cast a translation spell and caught the clerk frantically waving at him. Right. He casually scratched his neck with his wand and stuck it back into his pocket.
“Not sure yet” Hermione shrugged her shoulders and smiled. “But I’ll tell you once it’s decided. I’m just happy you’re coming.” She waved and was gone in almost five seconds tops. Shrugging his shoulders, Harry placed the tea back and went back to checking the profiles in their data base.
Draco was just about to say something, when Harry laughed and nodded. “Oh yes, of course, Mr. Malfoy.” Harry smiled at the elder man so innocently. “In fact, your son and I are in a relationship so you can’t really marry him off. He did after all complete the condition you’ve set.”
“Well, someone has to do it. And since you’re too scared of what he would think of you, I’ll do it.” Pansy shrugged her shoulders. “You can come as well, if you want to know what he’ll say about it.”
Checking his notes again, he saw that the next alley he had to turn left, then right and then twice left before there was a right turn and there should be a shop called ‘King Arthur’. Walking through all the different alleys, Harry had never seen so much variety when it came to shops and offices. That was probably due to the fact that he had almost always used Diagon Alley to shop or the closer back alleys in case there was too much going on.
As he ran his hands over the wallpaper, he could feel a magical boundary. He moved his hands right on top of it and pressed down. A shockwave travelled through his arm and connected to his magical core, which made Draco let go and stumble back a few feet. He had never felt that sensation, like a snake had raced through the inside of his arm right into his chest, where a silent explosion of magic happened and it disappeared again.
It was much more funnier that if Skeeter had just waited for a few more seconds to take the picture, she would have gotten the one and only picture of Draco and Harry together out and about just enjoying each other’s company. Since it was around Muggle London, they hadn’t thought much about it. And Skeeter seemed to be in such a hurry to tell everyone that Harry had turned against the Wizarding world that she had missed the most amazing opportunity ever.
For some reason, Harry didn’t respond, maybe he had just gotten more memories to go through. After quite some time, he finally shrugged his shoulders and sighed. “I know I shouldn’t feel this way, but… sometimes I feel like it was my mistake Dumbledore died.”
That meant he should be the one deciding what was going to happen to Harry. Not Hermione, not McGonagall and no other person around! Yet, he nodded. This was a fight he was not going to win. He was only able to win this fight should Hermione not talk to him for a week and Madam Pomfrey were to find out. This woman could frighten the living daylight out of anybody if she wanted to! And luckily, she was on his side.
“Well, there were some weird things going on, before your parents died, you know?” Alamar said and smiled weakly. “And the rumour is that all of this was staged by him. So, we wanted to save you from being used your whole life.”
Draco sighed. “Then what makes you think, I’ll get an appointment before Christmas and so I can take that person to the Christmas ball my mother is holding?”
The door was already open, and when Draco and Harry entered, Severus looked up from his desk. There was the absolutely smallest smile on his lips and Draco was extremely confused. How was his godfather now happy to welcome him into his house? If that would have happened eight years prior, he would have probably jumped from a cliff or something.
He needed Severus to do something else. “It’s not a punishment, Severus. I have chosen you, because I cannot leave my position here and I need someone out there whom I can trust. I can trust you, can I not?”
“You helped me, don’t worry.” He smiled broader. “And I did pay it back by talking to the Ministry and letting you off with a warning.”
Draco returned the soft smile weakly as he walked closer and sat down in front of him, the water reaching almost up to his chin. Harry leaned over him, kissing his forehead. “You and me forever, my gorgeous snake.”
He looked over to Potter and saw him silently nodding, so he would continue. However, he had no idea how to continue. Then again, another knock at the door interrupted their discussion.
As soon as Potter saw Draco, he waved him closer and made him sit down on a bar stool. “If you’d like something to eat, Benjamin, just tell me and I’ll get Daisy.”
Before anybody could say something else, Draco could once again hear someone – very likely Potter – giggle from somewhere in the room. Pansy chuckled and looked over the room, before turning back to Draco.
The Gryffindor shook her head, as if she knew what Harry would have wanted. Once they reached the kitchen, they sat down at the table, where Draco had once held baby Harry trying to figure out what had happened with his life.
“Thanks, Charlie!” Harry grinned and walked back to Hermione who had a book in her hands, though she had clearly watched what he had discussed with her brother-in-law.
Dwarfbart presented him a vial with an almost invisible liquid inside, though it was still moving. It was almost a ghost looking substance. While Dwarfbart handed him the vial, Eric felt his husband moving closer and he stopped next to him in only a few seconds.
“Nothing!” Harry rolled his eyes. Stalling for a little bit had worked – he hoped. “I went down to the Forbidden Forest and looked at the animals. Ever since I’m living in this tiny apartment in Muggle London, I enjoy seeing animals and being free. Is that so bad?”
graphic. It’s in the Injury Parchment, so if you’re not okay with it, just skip the parchment at the end. Also, maybe skip chapter 38, where Draco and gang deal with what they’ve learnt. Once again, I’m just telling you that this chapter will also not have any graphic descriptions. After that, chapter 39 will be “normal” again.
Instead of Theodore or even Draco, the person arguing against that was Pansy who just as suddenly appeared as Harry and pushed him back onto the couch. “Oh come on, Harry! I’ve finally managed to break free from my study group and now I can’t even watch you two be affectionate!” She even pouted and made not only Harry but also Draco smirk.
Millicent ruffled through Harry’s hair and when he looked at her shyly, she gestured to the food he had made. “Do you want us to try your food or should we go the Great Hall and get some food there?”
Harry placed a kiss on Draco’s temple and smiled softly. He looked at the therapist, realizing it was his turn to say something. “Draco makes me lose all my doubts that I’m not good enough. Whenever I’m with him, I know that I don’t have to hide parts of myself. He knows me better than I know myself and he’s the one who got me out of a bad mindset after the war. Sometimes I think that without his love and his patience, I wouldn’t have been able to go back into Wizarding society. Draco makes me feel like I’m unstoppable whenever I’m with him. Nothing can happen when we’re together.”
“Yes.” He walked closer again, stopped in front of Draco and softly brushed a loose hair strain out of his face. “Why don’t you stop worrying about things that might not even happen and just let yourself be part of this adventure? I couldn’t think of anybody else I’d rather do this with.”
“So” Harry sat down opposite of them and opened the folder. “This is our last meeting and I just wanted to find out if there’s something we’d need to discuss. Good, bad, whatever you’d like.”
The five names and portraits belonged to two women which Draco had heard died in the first Wizarding War right beside the Dark Lord and one man who did the same. The next beautiful name belonged to Eldric Melvyn a name Draco had heard a lot from his mother whenever she had talked about the most important wizards and witches in his family tree. He had something to do with a healing spell or a love spell, Draco wasn’t sure. Maybe he should have listened more closely to whatever his mother had told him… a little late for that now.
“You need to think of an incredibly happy moment of your life. It needs to be so strong that it fills you up with happiness and gives you the strength to cast a Patronus” Draco explained.
The two Death Eaters were trialled fairly easy; Potter had nothing to say about them. The Aurors wanted to lead him out of the room, when he suddenly decided to speak up.
Nobody was on board? Harry frowned. He had seen two people on there the two times he had looked at it. And they seemingly had wanted him to come inside. Saying nothing, he left the library and artifacts room and walked into the office, where the mess was even more visible. The hole in the wall was now magically sealed against any light coming from outside. Maybe it was made so that nobody could follow through? Whatever it was, the darkness in this room was almost overwhelming.
“Megan Jones” Harry replied, remembering the names he had stuck at the doors. “And Gregory Goyle, Millicent Bulstrode, Anthony Goldstein and Ernest Macmillan.“
After a few silent moments, Theodore was the one to break the silence. “Okay, so that’s not really surprising after what we did.”
“That sounds boring” Draco shook his head and narrowed his eyes. Suddenly, he grinned devilishly. “Why not make them pay for it?”
“Have you eaten today?” Luna asked and smiled as she helped Harry getting up. Today, all his limbs felt like he had at least some level of concrete inside them.
Draco pulled him even closer and pressed a soft kiss on his temple. Harry hummed and closed his eyes. For some reason, he was sure that he could stay in this embrace until the world would end. It was the first time in his life where for some weird reason he felt loved. Really, really loved.
Harry stopped, his anger washing away as a wave of new emotions ran through his body. He shivered, trying to figure out what was going on and frowned. This new emotion seemingly pushed all his fury to the edge of the volcano and pushed it inside as a strong urge to talk to Draco, kiss him, hold him,
Harry’s almost sarcastic sounding ‘thank you’ made Draco laugh and he placed a kiss on his boyfriend’s lips, before he turned to the night sky.
Frowning, Draco looked at Potter. “If you say it like that I have to believe they’re not so good friends anymore?”
Chuckling slightly, Draco kneeled down next to her, looking at the couch table which was overthrown by parchments and books. “I’ll help you plan. It needs to be perfect.”
It was rather early in the morning, when Draco went and woke up Harry. They had quite a full day ahead of them. Early breakfast in the kitchen and then, Remus had invited them over to their new house. He thought it would help Harry to get to chase a few not really dangerous creatures while they talked.
“Don’t worry, love.” Alamar smiled lovingly and grabbed himself a cup of tea while re-heating Eric’s as well. Aurora meowed and jumped onto Eric’s lap, rubbing her head on his chin.
Harry hoped onto a chair and grinned happily, when McGonagall conjured a Patronus and the three cats started playing around Harry and let him pet them. Draco had never thought of that: he needed to do something like that as well: He really seemed to love Patronusses.
Where had he put his planner? Harry once again checked all the drawers, but there was nothing in there, and he was already late – if he remembered correctly. He sighed and turned to the door. Grabbing the thick folder, Harry hurried through the hallway and passed Maria.
From the corner of his eyes, he could now see Vernon Dursley with a red face and when Alamar turned to look at the man, Eric unceremoniously placed a kiss on Alamar’s cheek, which seemed to be the last straw to break the camel’s back. However, instead of making a scene, he just walked back into the house, quite clearly swearing under his breath.
Blushing, Harry rolled his eyes. He got up and decided to walk over to Charlie who just got a little quiet, since Ron asked the children to a snowball fight outside.
?” Harry asked, when opened the oven and took out the small bread. He quickly cast a spell to keep Merlin away from the interesting toy that he was playing with. Last time, Merlin almost ended up baked when he jumped into the burning hell. Only a quick reaction from basically everyone saved his life.
Harry smiled, closing his eyes again and relaxing further into Draco’s loving care. Without him, he was sure that he wouldn’t have been able to make it far. Draco had always looked out for him, always had the best interest in mind for him. He was indeed the best husband for him.
“I’m a fulltime photographer.” He motioned to the wall where Harry just now saw a few dozen absolutely stunning pictures of landscapes, happy children and animals. It looked like Malfoy had travelled to Africa for some wild life photography and he had found some amazing landscapes in Iceland. “Next to that, people have decided that I am a good place to come and ask for Muggle help.”
Kingsley nodded. “Make sure to stop by here to get a recommendation for whatever job you want. If you’re ever going back to the Auror, even if it’s around the world, I’ll be happy to write a testimonial letter for you.”
“I will always worry about people being disrespectful to you. Just because I ended up saving the Wizarding World by accident, doesn’t mean I couldn’t have turned out evil. Sometimes I think I am at the very least slightly evil.”
Ginny chocked on a piece of cake and placed it on the table, before she coughed and turned back to Harry. With wide eyes, she swallowed the cake and shook her head. “No! No, you can’t do that!”
Pansy widened her eyes. “You’re not going to leave us, right?! We’ve just started eighth year! You can’t just leave us after not even two months!”
Madam Pomfrey quickly cast some spells, while Draco – once again – sat in the Hospital Wing, fearing for Harry’s well being. After a solid fifteen minutes, where the mediwitch was casting quite a few spells, some of which Draco wasn’t sure were even real spells, she seemed to have calmed down.
Draco sat up again as well and looked at him, carefully. “You don’t feel any push or pull or need or…”
“Not in the slightest.” Fleur chuckled and motioned him to follow her into the house, while she kept talking. “He’s making a pretty good godfather, though. I’m still confused how none of Bill’s family has figured out who this mysterious godfather of hers is. I think Ron is convinced it’s you” she grinned and shook her head.
“If you’re thinking about taking over Hogwarts, I at least want to be made a professor.” Draco shrugged, walked a few steps backwards and held out his hand for Harry to take.
“You know, Pansy tells me I was a happy baby, not friendly.” Harry smirked when he turned back to the stove, finishing brunch.
While the people around them started to argue in this unknown person’s favor, Draco snorted and Daphne giggled. It was quite endearing to hear everyone making a case for this unknown woman. Harry questioned whether they had done the same thing for Draco, had they known that he had actually married him.
Looking up, Eric let the garden hose fall down and looked at it without showing any intent of getting it again. A malicious smirk appeared on his lips, as he turned to Alamar with a sudden sweet expression. “I’ve got no idea what you’re referring to.”
every time I went to Diagon Alley. Sadly, I was always there when you weren’t” Professor Flitwick explained.
Harry had gotten his own room after lunch. Everyone on Slytherin had been overly enthusiastic, he had been welcomed with a banner as well that read
“This house is even creepier from the inside” Malfoy commented and Harry jerked. He hadn’t even heard him coming closer.
Could it be? He had seen this before, in the black house. The family tree on the wall as tapestry. But why was it hidden so well?
As he quirked his eyebrows, he walked closer and pressed a soft kiss on Harry’s lips. It tasted like vanilla. Draco’s closeness and warmth made Harry smile softly and he accepted the coffee, while stepping away from the fire place.
She nodded quickly and cast a charm on the spoon to stir whatever food she had on the stove. She then cleaned her hands and smiled at Harry. “A lot of work, but now you’re here.”
Draco suddenly stopped, remembering the discussion he had with Remus a few months ago. The discussion where Harry had apparently written his godfather telling him he thought he was a bad person, since... “Wait! The Hat already considered Slytherin for you, didn’t it?”
As he stood in front of the cake presentation thing, he saw the cake that looked a lot like the one Harry had been eating and trying to hide in front of Pansy. Draco had stared at the relationship these two had. Since, when Harry had stopped eating, Pansy brought out the real cake for everybody else. Harry had only laughed and shrugged his shoulders with a wink at Draco.
This time it was Draco who directed a few water drops right into Harry’s face, who giggled as he turned away. That wasn’t keeping Draco’s feeling towards his ward away. Harry was almost eighteen by now. Only two more days. Then… who knew what was happening then. He had grown up with him, maybe it was all just too confusing and weird for his ward.
Since the chime had sounded over the door, there was someone walking out from the back, while Harry stared at the colorful array of joke articles. Honestly, Draco also couldn’t stop looking around. It looked and felt so happy to be in here and a soft smile crept on his face as he watched Harry walk towards a huge assortment of bigger and smaller explosions with different colors.
“I smell strawberry” Harry finally said, trying to loosen Draco up a little. It seemed to work, as Draco looked at him as if he was testing him. He smirked quickly, telling his husband that he knew there wasn’t any strawberry inside the wine.
When Alamar walked down the stairs, he found Eric sneaking out of Harry’s room and quietly closing the door again. He caught his husband’s eyes and smiled while holding his index finger to his mouth. “He just fell asleep” Eric whispered and they both snuck down into the barely furnished living room.
Looking through the crowd, Draco found his ward sitting on a table with quite a lot of drinks, which he was handing out to other Slytherins.
Hermione chuckled and beckoned Terrance to follow her. “You don’t want to be in the middle of when they try to outdo each other. Especially with Ron as the vice Head Auror, they’ll be at each other’s throat for the next few hours” she explained while they walked out.
The beaming smile that crossed Harry’s face was worth absolutely everything, as he nodded. “I would never forget that, Draco! That’s one of my favorite memories!”
Harry sighed and shook his head. “Too many people, Hermione. Are you and Ron at home or do you want me to come to Molly’s instead?”
It shouldn’t be that, right? He should feel awesome, be proud of what he did. And now, even if they had caught some unimportant criminal, he really didn’t feel good. It was just another day, another criminal another day on the job. It was a job in which he wasn’t happy.
Counting the six vase fragments, Harry turned to the man sitting on the floor. “So, you’re writing six reasons why you love him and then however many small moments there are on the smaller things? Which fragments are you choosing for big ones?” Harry frowned.
Ron had been right of course. The windows weren’t boarded up, the light from the full moon shone in through the clean glass and there was even a fire in the fire place, though neither Ron nor Nott said they had started it. Malfoy grinned at that and shrugged his shoulders.
As if his friend had read his mind, he smirked. “Yeah, yeah. Liquid courage is also a good idea, mate.”
The Slytherin smiled softly, his eyes flickered to Harry’s lips, before he looked back at him. “I’m not the only one who can read thoughts, Potter. Mind you, almost all of Slytherin knows that your Amortentia smells like rosemary and cardamom and that it reminds you of me.”
“Can’t they do anything to reverse it with some spell or so? Surely there has to be some sort of magical help!” Millicent asked and frowned slightly, looking at Potter. “I mean he’s cute and all, but I really don’t want him to be around us.”
Harry tried his hardest to bite down the smirk and shook his head. “Isn’t there supposed to be some truce between us, Malfoy?” His former last name came out so much easier now.
A few moments later and Weasley came out with a small folder. Draco frowned and wanted to grab it, when the man took it back.
Instead of saying something, he walked up behind Draco and pulled him into a hug. Draco yelped, his hands on Harry’s arm, as if he wanted to push him away, before he relaxed.
“Hello Olivia! I didn’t even see you guys coming back yesterday and when I went to visit Sirius he said you had already asked him to get the job!” He was talking while he jogged up the hill and hugged the girl, while she laughed nervously.
He had actually never had time to look at how Potter had turned out to be. He was no longer the small, thin boy he had seen in first year, with clothes that were too big and an almost sarcastic way to see life.
“I have no idea, Draco. I don’t think I’m boyfriend material myself. So what does that tell you about me?” Harry chuckled softly and kissed Draco’s forehead.
“I know.” Draco nodded. “However, with this information, I can help you in so many ways I thought was impossible. Maybe we could even find the curse and undo it!” While he said it, he was getting more and more thoughtful. Harry was sure that by the end of that sentence he was in the middle of a thinking match against himself.
Smiling softly, Draco shrugged his shoulders. “I don’t know. You can ask Mrs. Weasley, bear.” He motioned towards her and the Gryffindor looked at her hopefully.
Sadly, him being Harry Potter drew a little focus away from the Slytherin. As the father was apparently a huge fan of his. Once he had given his autograph, he returned to the shop and sighed.
“Of course” Draco said, feeling the uneasy and worried glances form his friends, even though he smiled at them. “Maybe Harry likes to see you guys!”
“Um” Ron frowned at his wife and shook his head. “Everyone would be fine, really” he looked between Harry and Hermione. “But Malfoy? I mean, I don’t care that you’re into men, but…”
Neville nodded. “I know exactly what you mean. I mean it’s nice that Hogwarts set up all these things, but why do we need to see them? We remember them...” he rolled his eyes. Harry smiled weakly.
“Kingsley came by looking for you. Just imagine what would have happened if I continued to tell him that you weren’t here only for you to pop out of a secret door.” Harry snorted. “Sorry, Minister, looks like I forgot to tell you that Draco took up the job of a House Elf or something.”
Before Draco could freak out entirely, Severus held out a parchment. “Indeed there is. This is the official statement of the Headmistress of Hogwarts, Minerva McGonagall. Along with the one from former Order of the Phoenix fighter, Remus John Lupin.”
At the same time, Draco cancelled the spells, Harry started yelling at him and Neville opened the door, forcefully pulling Harry out while Padfoot looked slightly spooked and followed them as well. When Neville finally closed the kitchen door, Harry pulled his arm back and glared at him.
Neville rolled his eyes and crossed his legs at his ankles while he leaned back. “It’s the worst time! Everyone of the higher ups goes home for Christmas and they want all the paperwork on their desk yesterday. All of them. It’s worst time of the year.”
The tour ended after two rather innocent stops. And with that they were left to their own device. While most people walked to the lake to enjoy one of these rare absolutely stunning dark blue skies, Harry headed to the kitchen. He wasn’t the only one who’d had this idea. In front of him was Pansy marching together with Draco.
“Stop it! Please!” Bill said and held his hand over his heart. “My poor old heart can only take so much of your love-sick actions. How are you still so… annoyingly in love?”
Harry stopped and turned back to the last picture. No, he hadn’t imagined it, there actually were two old ladies arguing with each other. One had a cane and continuously tried to hit the other grandmother with it, while the other grey haired woman used her black umbrella as a shield and attack weapon. It was almost like watching a movie.
In Severus’ hand there was a picture of Severus and another girl. She seemed to be Harry’s mother. Draco’s godfather sat down again and looked intently at him, so that he knew speaking would be a mistake now. “Harry’s mother knew me better than I knew myself. And one day, she knew that there was something amiss whenever we were together. She figured out that I wasn’t speaking the truth all of the time.”
“Good morning, Harry. How did you sleep?” he asked and closed the book to place it on a table next to him.
“Ye ken what’s guid, sairrr. Weel 'en, come haur, laddie, I’ll see whit we can dae abit 'at jumper!” He waved Harry closer who, after a scared look at Draco, walked toward Bridger.
“No!” Draco rolled his eyes, pretending to be mortally wounded. “How could you do that to me?! You know I can’t figure out Transfiguration!”
“That kind of magic can hurt pregnant women” Draco explained and grinned, before he shrugged his shoulders. “I gave them all a good scare, love. Once we’re back home, I’ll certainly have to show you.”
However, nobody answered and Harry pulled himself together. He grabbed his wand tighter and snuck to the entrance of the living room. Peering into the hallway, he found it empty. Frowning, he turned to Malfoy. “He’s not here. No one is.”
“It was quite clearly you” Harry smirked which earned him a magical slash of water in his face, while he laughed and Draco grinned.
Harry narrowed his eyes and crossed his legs as turned on the bed to look at him directly. “I’m sorry, Dray.”
Neville frowned. “Harry, if someone did that to me, I wouldn’t want to be friends with that person.” He looked rather conflicted, though Harry shrugged his shoulders.
Or maybe not. All he had wanted to do when he was younger was fight as an Auror, which was what he was doing. So his past self would probably be proud of him dying as a result of being chased down by a criminal.
Looking back at the parchment, Harry shrugged his shoulders. “No idea. But it seemed a long time ago. I don’t think I could write something like that.”
However, this comment made all of them look at Potter, who was by now playing contently with his teddy bear. What did happen that made his bone break? Draco did not want to know, yet… he needed to know. He needed to know what his relatives did to this sweet boy who was so happy!
Minerva cleared her throat and Harry blushed slightly, chuckling over how far they had driven their boss. He held up his hands and decided to call it truce.
“Millicent wanted to wake you up, but I thought my method was much more effective” Theodore laughed and dodged one of Draco’s jinxes. “Get out of bed; we’re leaving for breakfast in ten minutes!”
Ron got up and basically stormed around the house. Nott sighed and got down the two front steps as well, grabbing a piece of parchment and writing down everything he could see. Harry sighed and shook his head. He leaned at the pillar and looked up.
“Shit. And by the way, I know what you’re called” Harry chuckled again. “I just wanted to lift your mood a little. Did it work?”
“Hey, I might need some help!” Harry called out as he realized that one platter of chips was finally slipping and about to fall.
“What are you talking about, Pans?” he asked, pretending not to have noticed her emphasizing a very special word in her speech. She didn't know. He had kept it a well guarded secret, right? She couldn't have known.
Potter inhaled and he chuckled as well. “Thanks. Maybe it would be easier to discuss this in person? Do you think we can meet at the Italian restaurant I’ve shown you in thirty minutes? I’ll be punctual, I swear.”
“I am pretty sure you’ve told me you were gay when we started our last year at Hogwarts. Something about Ginny and you and…” Neville frowned, before he shrugged his shoulders. “I can’t seem to remember. I just remember you telling me.” He narrowed his eyes. “Or was it all just in a dream?”
The redhead grinned and shrugged her shoulders. She turned back to her book about Herbology while Luna crossed her legs, sitting Indian style on the chair, and the others on the table turned back to Draco.
Groaning quietly, Draco got out of bed and went to the toilet, hoping he could fall asleep after that. He had only been gone five minutes, but when he entered the room again, Harry sat on his bed frowning. A candle was lit on the bedside table and Harry rubbed his forehead.
Yawning, Harry rubbed his eyes and put the last few packages into the storage. He checked his list again, signing all the different potions and medications they had gotten today. Who decided to work on Christmas? Their potioneer did suck a little.
Pansy had organized this way before everything had started going downhill and they had used it to study for their OWLs. Even though they were in the Common Room and somehow knew what was going on, they were still separate and could talk without being bothered. Now they had all started to enjoy it over there, isolated from the other Slytherins. While some could have argued that they were aiming to be superiors through this, most knew that they had a very tight friendship and preferred to stay with each other.
Stop learning for the test for one evening. Do it for me, because I charmed the origami swan, and it took me almost half a day to figure out the correct magic. The last one went up in flames…
“Well, since I am not your student anymore, I don’t think you thought this statement through” Draco argued, grinning.
“If you tell Pansy to keep an eye on me and then you disappear to come back with a lover, wouldn’t that make her question us?” Harry asked and raised his eyebrows.
Potter giggled and grabbed Draco’s hair again, though this time, he was faster and simply pushed it out of Harry’s reach. “Now what?”
Madam Pomfrey smiled and put a bandage around it. “It will not stay here forever. Keep the bandage on for about twenty four hours. You’re aging so quick it should be helping in removing the scar. It was a ritual, not an actual magical scar. You’re lucky.” With that she nodded at the two of them and walked back to her desk.
“I. Wouldn’t. Know” Draco emphasized. He rolled his eyes and gave a dark grin. “And if I knew, I would say that they had it coming! They thought themselves to be so high and unreachable. Well, we’ve just shown them that they are absolutely reachable and can get hurt. Just because they thought a small child wouldn’t do something against them doesn’t mean a man can’t do something to them.”
Draco leaned down and placed a kiss on his lips. “I do. I’m taking pictures of Pauline’s Christmas Cookie collection. So, you need to let me go.”
Draco laughed and shook his head. “This man is in over his head, Harry! I wouldn’t be surprised if you’d have more work to do tomorrow than if you’d been there today.”
His father raised his eyebrows and shook his head. “Draco, this is as far as I am willing to go for you. It’s almost a decade since you left Hogwarts and you haven’t found a wife to live your future with. You have until the Christmas Masquerade Ball to show us your future man or I will be invoking my right as the family patriarch to accept a marriage offer from one of the other pureblood families.”
Harry hummed, running his hand along his husband’s jaw, smiling softly over how he melted under his touch. “I love you so much, my darling” Harry said between kisses, making Draco even weaker in the process.
Hermione laughed and Ron shook his head, also smirking. He motioned towards the castle, where Harry saw a healer walk away, in the typical blue St. Mungo’s uniform. He looked back at Hermione raising his eyebrows.
Draco grinned and shrugged his shoulders. “You could have said so many other things, love. You’ve rebuilt Grimmauld Place 12, you’re gay, you…” he narrowed his eyes and thought.
Potter sighed and rubbed his eyes with the free arm. In a sleepy voice, he seemingly decided to speak up. “Nothing happened, Benjamin.”
Smirking, Harry was glad he had his back to the door so his best friend couldn’t see his expression. When he finally did turn to the door, his expression had changed into something like annoyance and he hoped a little bit of sadness, though he wasn’t sure.
Draco nodded and grinned. Whatever it was, he was now an official part of Severus’ family. Even if he still looked the same, nobody could take away the feeling he had inside. And the ancient Snape family magic, which probably came more from the Prince's family magic, felt much warmer and cozier than the cold unfeeling Malfoy one.
Chuckling, the shop owner nodded. “Well, Mr. Potter, you did a good job with Dag. And it’s been an honor having you in my shop. You’re always welcomed back.”
Humming softly, Harry turned, kissing the corner of his lips. “Just… realisation of how much I love you. And how loved you make me feel.”
Meanwhile, Draco turned to Blaise. “Harry named him.” He shrugged as if to show he had been unable to get Harry to change the name.
Before Eric could say anything, probably making fun of Dumbledore losing his prized possession, Aurora looked up and meowed. Alamar got up and walked through the home to open the door. Aurora jumped behind him, though not even slightly scared. It looked like an old friend was about to enter their home.
“Harry!” Draco turned to look at him and shook his head. “Names are names!” He was trying his hardest not to laugh over his ward’s blunt statement. He didn’t quite manage that, however, Miss Soames aka Charlie was laughing now as well.
Draco pressed it and was presented with a box for a password. Rolling his eyes, he started eliminating passwords. All the names the press had given him didn’t work, the name of his friends, even ‘Hogwarts’ wasn’t it. He tried ‘Dumbledore’ or ‘James’ and ‘Lily’ and ‘Marauders’. Nothing worked. Maybe it wasn’t the correct connection.
“Minerva, how lovely of you to come by!” Alamar greeted her as Aurora meowed and sat down by her feet, looking up at her expectantly.
After a short silence, Peter sighed, defeated. “Yeah. Sure.” Before Harry could say something, his costumer continued talking: “You know, I keep thinking that I am the problem and that…”
Lucky for him, the Malfoy’s had gotten to this standard and they left their vaults alone pretty much. If the Potter’s had the same thing going, he didn’t know. Well, he didn’t need to know, but it would still be nice to know.
As Harry was slowly calming down, Pansy sat down next to Draco, so that Harry could see her easily. She placed a hand on the boy’s knee and smiled warmly. “Darling, you are no freak!” she said softly. Harry turned his head slightly, tear stricken eyes looked at hers, while Draco was still rubbing his back. “You are a very handsome, little prince, darling! And princes don’t have to cook for others. And we all love you very much and it doesn’t matter that… that the eggs aren’t good or that you have a few problems. We all have them. It’s normal, dear.”
They were all quiet, while Potter settled down on the carpet again, starting to draw something else, while he was humming or mumbling something. Draco carefully watched his ward, though nothing seemed out of the ordinary. The drawing of the Thestral hadn’t messed with him and he apparently hadn’t understood what he was doing.
“How come I’ve never heard of that?” Minerva frowned and shook her head as if she was surprised she had never heard of something like a secret newspaper inside the huge newspaper organization.
“He doesn’t, bear. In my opinion, he’s just a little insecure. You were his best friend ever since you first came here. And now you suddenly hang around us Slytherins. You
Draco smiled softly and willingly sat down, when Harry pulled him down. He placed the soft red blanket over his lap and leaned at Harry’s chest who himself had lain back onto a huge rock.
Theodore looked at him closely and frowned. “You look far too fancy for it to just be a catch up dinner”
Pansy was the next person to speak up: “Don’t worry, Harry. You brought a lot of happiness into our Common Room, so we should be thanking you.”
Well, everyone seemed a little on edge and trying their hardest to hide it, since they were unable to talk and once Draco opened the door, there wasn’t just Severus, but also the witch from before. She quickly counted them and nodded.
“That’s nice of him” Harry grinned and the house vibrated, as if to let them know that he had in fact been the one to keep Teddy safe. Over the last few years, the house had actually gotten to really care for Teddy, even though at the beginning both were a little uncomfortable with each other. Not that Harry blamed anybody or anything.
Now it was Harry’s turn to cross his arms over his chest. “I’m not a child anymore. I’m a teenager.”
“Whatever, Freckleface. You needed to prove you’re still the man, so I let you.” Nott turned his wand in his hand as if he was inspecting it from every angle and whatever he had said was just a secondary idea.
Fred agreed: “You can’t just give things away, especially things as valuable as vaults! They need to be sold to the best match!”
Harry knew for a fact that this place had once been a home for wizards – maybe they were hunted and killed because they had some Muggle artifacts. Though who knew if by that time these things even were artifacts.
A normal life wasn’t interesting. Wake up at six, eat breakfast at half past six, drive to work at seven, work from nine to five and go back home to eat dinner and watch TV. All of that was just boring.
“What?” It came out as almost a bark. Before long, Draco was on all four and his yellow hair spread over his body. He grew a tail and his face transformed until you couldn’t tell the difference. Well, Harry could. But not anybody else who had just seen the dog Harry had come in with.
She winked at Harry and Draco, both rolling their eyes, though Harry could only guess what she had said – most likely something that they were cute together. Draco moved his hand to Harry’s lower back.
Harry smiled down at him and put him into the crib, where their crazy Kneazel Merlin joined him after a few seconds and the two of them started playing with a ball. Harry had always loved to watch Merlin play with the children; however, he needed to find Draco. Something didn’t feel right.
Draco ruffled through her hair and chuckled over her outraged expression. She tried to put her hair back together, though didn’t quite manage. She hadn't only inherited Draco's hair, but also his constant need to have them at least somewhat looking nice.
“I’m sorry” Harry said sarcastically and rolled his eyes. “He got the better of me. It’s just…” He sighed and pulled his wrist out of Ron’s grip. “He just gets to me sometimes.”
Draco turned back to Harry and huffed, walking to the lake. Harry shook his head and groaned, turning to walk into the other direction, whistling for Padfoot to follow as well. Maybe they could play a little game so his dog would feel better. He also didn’t really want to answer all the questions his former classmates and professors were probably having. He grabbed his phone and wrote a text quickly.
On the way to the library they were joined again by Neville, Hermione and Blaise who followed them, apparently happy to study. In the library, very out of character, Ron was already sitting on a table, studying. Everyone joined and while they were trying to go into detail on Runes and Astronomy, along with Herbology and DADA, Draco couldn’t really concentrate. Next to his Mind Healing session which was taking place in less than an hour, there were other things on his mind.
He looked over at Fleur, who winked at him and nodded. “I just want to know if you’ve treated Olaf fine. What do you want to do with him?”
Harry snorted and rolled his eyes: “I can take care of myself, thank you.” He must have seen Pansy pretending to be hurt as he quickly added: “But of course, Pansy can be my temporary Magical Guardian.”
Alamar and Minerva followed her and Eric smiled, quickly placing the weapons and tools on the kitchen counter so she could sit down next to them. “I was afraid we wouldn’t be able to say goodbye.”
Life has been crazy here; a lot of things have changed. Did I tell you that my cat Artemis escaped? I thought nobody realised but Cerberus is trying to sniff her out. I’m sure he’s already hard on her trail. I’m looking forward to seeing her again, but maybe she’s happier outside?
. Smirking softly, Draco put it onto the floor and looked at the parchment. It actually was a full on letter from Remus. Checking on Potter, Draco saw him sitting on the grass, playing with a few dirty leaves that he threw into the air and giggled about.
“Hey” Hermione smiled incredibly innocent – too innocent for Harry’s liking. “What have you three been doing here?” She looked at Draco as if she was waiting for him to do something.
Draco shook his head and nuzzled into Potter’s chest, while he kept laughing. The Saviour stroked his hair and the second Draco thought he was safe, Potter climbed out of bed without any problem.
When they finally left to go to the Common Room, Draco was but a nervous wreck. When they finally sat down in their secret hiding space, Harry seemed to know exactly what was going to happen. Well, he rushed out quickly, Draco following.
“These are Monsieur Brodeur and his daughter Adélaïde Claudine Brodeur. I have invited them over to dinner as well” Narcissa said, before switching to French to talk to them. They clearly came from France. “Welcome to the Malfoy Manor!”
Draco had to hold back his laughter. These two together were like a comedy show, Merlin meowing, Harry pretending to know what their Kneazel said. Well, with his knowledge of how Merlin behaved, he might actually know exactly what he was saying.
Chuckling, Draco grabbed the letters and they walked down the stairs, where Harry could see the door the basement opening and Nott walked out. He looked around and leaned against the front door.
Well, Draco wasn’t really sold, so he started talking and making up more promises: “Even if it’s in the middle of class or during night? You can come and get me whenever...”
“James, that would be Mr. Morris for you, don’t you remember not to give people nicknames?” Potter said almost as if the boy had been his very own.
Please answer mine letters as I am losing hope thou are 'i fact still alive. I still love thou with all of mine heart and while I write these lines, it burns and shatters with the thought - the possibility - of not being yours for the end of time.
“Your guess is as good as mine” Dwarfbart exhaled. “They’re currently extracting the soul part. I know it’s too much to ask, but would you be so kind as to take them with you? I doubt there’s a place in the UK where we can hide them from Dumbledore. We’ll send a few people out to look for more soul parts, but I’ve got my reservation we’ll find anything in a short amount of time. It might take a decade at least.”
Draco chuckled. “You’re too Gryffindor for your own good, Harry. Stupid, brave, bold, idiotic, did I mention stupid?” He grinned. “Jumping into a relationship head first instead of checking every angle and…”
That made Draco laugh which was all Harry had wanted to achieve right now. He grinned and they walked down to the Great Hall, where Draco let go of his hand reluctantly and then proceeded to walk into the Hall, while Harry ruffled Padfoot’s fur and walked outside for a little fresh air and a morning walk for his dog.
The headmistress laughed and agreed. “Is it alright if I visit you at the end of next week? Draco’s apprenticeship will start I two weeks, which gives us a little time. We can discuss everything a bit more. Maybe also with your husband present, so that all the timetables work for everyone.”
Ron snorted. “You, of course. Harry hasn’t told us you existed for the past six years! But it’s nice getting to know you!”
mind?” Potter asked with a faint smile on his lips. It seemed as if Draco hadn’t been the only one who was watching his conversational partner closely.
Severus chuckled and nodded. “The Headmistress already told me. Draco cursed your relatives, so you’re planning on going out today and cursing Narcissa. Tell me if something sounds familiar.”
He fell onto his chair defeated and started sorting everything. The books, he placed into a pile on the floor and the parchments that weren’t important landed on his bed – for now. Other utensils that weren’t needed, he pushed into a box under his desk.
Next to the bakery, there was a just as small butchery. The second he walked by, Mrs Williams left the shop and Draco offered to carry the meat to her home. She agreed thankfully and compared him to Potter, with his gentleman manners.
Harry chuckled and got up, walking closer towards him. “If you don’t want to watch one now, I understand. It is in the middle of the night, sure enough. We just had a party and it might be a little too much. That was just something I wanted to show you. I frankly couldn’t wait.”
“Draco” Harry breathed, stopping his hands. He stared at the Slytherin whose eyes had darkened with lust. He couldn’t stop this train, not now. “Please” he whispered and kissed Draco with much more force, hungrily.
Draco laughed. “Well, I suppose by that you mean Harry trying to break everything and me trying to get him to do something else, such as playing with his toys.”
In second year, instead of taking hair from Millicent’s head, she plucked it from her clothes. That could have been from literally anybody! In third year, she had used the time turner not to her best knowledge, but to do as much work as possible. Harry would have maybe chosen it to sleep more if he could, but she was just irresponsible. And apparently, it only now showed. While she had absolutely gotten better over the years and running away from Voldemort surely made all of them grow up rather fast, it looked as if she was reverting back to her old ways.
He realized that he had been standing in the same position for a while and Harry was looking at him slightly amused. “Well, come along now, Harry. Let me show you the secret potions lab.”
Severus had stayed true to his statement, as he actually waited for them outside the Common Room and told Harry to follow him. Together they made their way along side Draco and every other eighth year student up the stairs until he changed directions and brought him to the Hospital Wing.
Severus nodded. “Should you have any problems, you can always come here. However, I do believe that Draco and any other eighth year are surely there to help you before I am. Still, if there is anything happening, you can always come and knock.”
Looking up, the redhead got to his feet and greeted Harry as well. “Incredibly well, Harry! I almost hadn’t been able to get a free day today. Mum would have probably killed me if I wouldn’t have found time!”
Draco nodded. “Thank you again for what you’ve done for me. I don’t think I could have gotten through this last year if it hadn’t been for your support.”
“Then I guess we’re through. I need another week, I know I’m close” Draco answered both people on the other line. He heard Neil inhaling shocked, King cursing at Neil for not being able to bring him home.
His husband jerked up and stood up, trying to hide the potion in the middle of the table. “You’re back already?”
Draco took a sip of his now cold tea and stared at the next page. Harry had drawn a few animals, not perfectly as the porpotions were slightly off, though Draco liked to see that the perfect Savior had apparently also problems with other things. Still, this was getting worse and worse. He had never heard of a specific curse taking so many different ways to hurt a person.
Harry chuckled and shrugged his shoulders. “She still has a collection of nice teacups and one time when we went shopping I told her to ‘come along teacup’, since she was looking at more of them and she decided to call me ‘teapot’ then. That’s how it happened.”
“Anything I can do to help? Get Professor McGonagall for example?” Hermione asked and her innocent smile proofed (apparently) that she had nothing to hide. However, Draco had grown to see through her mask of politeness.
“Not really. I knew a family whose great-great-grandfather had a curse like that thrown at him and it continued through the male lineage. Just because the original caster is dead, doesn’t mean the curse can’t connect to its origin.”
“Harry! You look so different! I haven’t seen you in a while!” he greeted him and smiled. “I’m here on official Ministry business, Harry. Have you heard what happened to your relatives?”
“Come here, Draco. This potion will turn you back into a human” he held out the potion and the dog walked closer. He sat down and looked up, trying to get the vial into his paws. “No, I need to give it to you, unless you want to lick it from the ground?”
