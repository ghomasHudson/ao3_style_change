Draco smiles at her, his expression bereft.
Harry smiled as Ron continued.
“So he told you about that?” Harry said. He suddenly felt tense. “Did he tell you why Draco was there?”
Harry blinked a couple times, and felt the colour rise in his cheeks again. An uncontrollable laugh bubbled out of his throat as he ran his hand back through his unruly locks before clearing his throat. “Just freckles.”
This question made the young witch pause. She stopped in the middle of pulling a cork out of a tonic potion and blinked at Harry. “Well, if I had to summarise that man…I would say he was an island surrounded by a vast sea… Seemingly untouchable, and distant. However, on that island is a lighthouse, which shines a light against the dark sea to guide people to its borders. To understand and get close to that man, all you need to do is follow the light, but you need to be willing to look for it.”
“So, let me get this straight.” Ginny sipped from her mug with a thoughtful frown on her face. She talked slow, as if she were still wrapping her head around the story. “You’re upset, because Malfoy is upset, because he touched your boner.”
spell.
“It’s something that you’re too embarrassed to tell Hermione about, otherwise you’d be at her and Ron’s house right now. You don’t want comfort ‘cause otherwise you’d be at The Burrow letting mum smother you in hugs and feeding you until you popped-”
Harry boiled over. “No of course not. Your aunt only carved
into her skin. You don’t owe her any kind of respect or repentance, do you?” The room fell deathly silent. The ticking of the clock was loud and far apart like thunder; time had slowed down. Harry breathed hard as if his lungs had run out of air.
years. Harry almost smiled.  “There he is. The cold hearted,
wandlessly sent a spell hurdling towards Harry’s chest. Harry braced himself for pain as the spell hit its mark, but felt the opposite.
“It is part of the conditions of home treatment,
Harry swallowed the lump in his throat as he gripped the bedsheets harder.
Harry tried his best to continue with his day. He showered, but he couldn’t bring himself to wank. Every time Harry closed his eyes and saw Malfoy on his knees, the self-disgust he felt overpowered his arousal. He tried cracking on with paperwork, but his mind refused to focus on the words in front of him. The most productive thing that he did was charm a consent form into an origami crane. But even the crane fluttered out of the room and left him.
The numbers of the doors were slowly dwindling to where he needed to be.
Harry felt the pounding of his heart in the base of his throat.
But Draco didn’t want Harry to touch him.
The joyous moment cracked back into reality, and Harry didn’t feel like laughing anymore. “He doesn’t want me Gin. He made that perfectly clear.” Harry felt hot tears brim his eyes again, and he shook them away. “Maybe I read the signs wrong, I… I just… Have grown so attached in such a short period of time, I’m probably just horny and confused.” Harry sipped his drink again, letting his words linger in the air.
“You gotta talk to him.”
Harry sat formally in his chair and waited for his healer to arrive. As if right on cue, Draco had entered the room and searched for immediate clues for what Harry had done to himself this time. Harry watched as Malfoy raised his eyebrow in amusement and folded his arms across his chest. “No vegetable heads today then Potter?”
on it instead of acting like a lovesick puppy. Honestly, it made me feel a little nauseous watching you
, I judged him based on what I had heard; I thought that the hospital had hired a Death Eater who would put blood purity before saving lives.” Eliza’s bottom lip trembled lightly, but she steadied herself by drawing a slow breath. Harry reached for her hand and squeezed it. “He was quiet, and didn’t speak to us medical staff, so I had my guard up about him. I remember there was an old witch, a muggleborn, who was dying of age-related complications about two years ago… Her family had paid a lot of money to grant her a private room, so she could pass away peacefully. Alone. I noticed
“Fucking hell-“
“Then why aren’t you fighting?”
“Eliza kept insisting that Loony Lovegood's theory of bloody wrackspurts needed to receive funding from the board. I swear that girl has fairies in her head…”
He couldn’t stay here. The ticking of the clock on the wall was plucking his last, fraying nerve. He had to go somewhere else, anywhere else, and fast. Harry rose to his feet and made his way to the fireplace. He grabbed a handful of floo powder from the bowl on the mantelpiece and threw it into the fireplace before stepping inside. He let the flames consume him, and his living room swirled away. He wasn’t even sure what address had left his lips.
Malfoy stepped elegantly out of the fireplace and brushed the non-existent dust off his robes. Harry raised his body slightly and propped himself using his elbows. “Here already?”
Harry shifted himself on the sofa, and slowly began to lie down. He winced slightly and chewed on his lip as he felt his ribs groan in protest to his torso being stretched. Harry sighed in relief as he focused his gaze onto the ceiling. He took deep breaths as his discomfort began to roll away.
“What do you want, Potter? To humiliate me? To make me lose by job?”
Kreacher led Harry to the bottom floor. As Harry walked down the hallway, Kreacher opened the living room door and bowed so low that his nose brushed the floor.
“A guest be here for you, Masters.” Kreacher stood in the doorway of Harry’s office. He knocked on the open door after he had spoken. Harry had previously tried to teach Kreacher to knock if Harry was in his office working, but either the house elf couldn’t quite get the hang of what Harry meant, or he did this to Harry on purpose.
Fearing for the safety of his arse, Harry admitted defeat and hastily jumped up to his feet. He groaned moodily at Ginny and glared even harder at her. He ran his hands back through his dishevelled hair and began pacing the room. “For fucks sake what do you want Gin?!”
“Potter.”
*****
After last night Harry wasn’t sure how to convince Malfoy to give him some more of that chocolate. Would it be impolite to ask for some?
The question echoed in the room and Malfoy became even more stiff. The man was a ticking time bomb.
“You’re taking the next week off work Potter, possibly two. I figured you’d prefer to heal in the comfort of your home rather than in this place. Did I assume wrong?” Malfoy took Harry’s silence as a cue to continue talking. “As part of your new treatment plan, you will rest at home. I will check up on you and your monitor your progress there. Is that clear?”
On Friday however, Harry had changed his approach.
Harry saw a muscle in the corner of Draco’s mouth twitch before he wetted his lips and regained himself. “Blood isn’t that shade of red, or that sticky looking.”
Harry stared into the empty fireplace and felt panic bubble up inside him. He ran his hands back through his hair and squeezed his eyes shut to stop hot tears from escaping.
Malfoy completed the rounds of his patients before leaving the room. Harry kept his eyes trained on the back of the blonde’s head until he walked down the corridor, out of sight. True to his word, Eliza shortly came into the room with a blue plastic tray bobbing behind her. Her smile was bright and she all but skipped into the room. “Good morning Harry, I take it that you didn’t sleep very well last night.”
Every thought and feeling Harry had experienced over the past couple of weeks had led to this night. For the opportunity for Harry to prove himself to Draco that he was worth something. That he was worth Draco’s time.
“Medi-Nurse Mayford will come by shortly to-“
************
Pushing his chair backwards Draco slowly began to stand himself up. He braced himself for a moment as the thunderous throbs in his brain ricocheted. He waited for the throbbing to subside slightly before he stepped out of the station. The young sandy haired healer scurried away in the direction of the canteen as Draco marched his way down the opposite corridor. He could barely hear the fast retreat of the other Healer over the sound of his grinding teeth.
His voice came out much quieter than intended. “You didn’t even check.”
Mayford studied Harry’s face again for a moment before laughing brightly. “Who else? I mean have you seen someone else that walks around like they have a broom up their arse-“
The cold metal removed itself from Harry’s chest. It was replaced by delicate hands once more pressing themselves against both sides of Harry’s ribcage. A quiet, low incantation began escaping from Malfoy’s lips and heat transferred from his palms into Harry’s skin. A low groan escaped Harry’s mouth. Surprised by his own noise, Harry snapped his eyes open.
Harry swallowed as he let his eyelids drift shut. He heard the sound of the clipboard being placed on the table, and the sound of approaching footsteps. He felt the edge of the sofa beside him dip as Malfoy sat down. The familiar incantation began to escape from Malfoy’s lips and Harry immediately felt heat radiate from the man. A dark rouge tint appeared in the darkness that Harry could see; Malfoy’s palms being the source of the light.
Harry nodded.
“Well, actually-”
"Shrek," Harry said.
“I rather think that's up to the people who are stupid enough to do things that can be used against them,” Theodore said. His gaze fixed on Draco, and he smirked. “Why so serious, Malfoy? Potter got your tongue?”
“Right," Harry said. “Thank you for, uh… Sleeping with me?”
"Harry," Ron said somehow under his breath but also with an unusually high-pitched voice, "I saw... Seamus Finnigan is here."
"You saw Dean Thomas in the summer?"
that was what Harry was talking about, but… His mind was preoccupied with staring down Harry's collar and wondering how such a god-awful shirt could look good on anyone. In fact, he had been a fraction of a second away from losing it and interrupting Harry with a kiss when they had heard the sound.
"Wait - you can cast a Patronus?"
"Yeah, it's so good- fuck, Draco, you're so tight, it's so good, oh fuck..."
“And also PTSD.”
Despite all the leftover adrenaline from the arguing, Harry felt a fluttering in his chest when he saw Draco’s room for the first time. It felt strangely intimate to actually see where he spent most of his time, and to Harry’s surprise the place didn’t look as minimalist and monochrome as what he had expected based on the way Draco dressed. The walls wore a dark paneling, and what was left bare above them was covered in pencil sketches of people, birds and other animals, and pages ripped out from books, with sentences underlined in black ink. Books were piled up under the window in what looked like a makeshift window sill, and on top of them lay a pile of papers and - Harry couldn’t help but notice - a couple crumpled up paper cranes.
“Um, no you fucking didn’t," Harry huffed.
"They're really useful though," Harry said. "They pollinate all the flowers and everything."
It would have been a gross understatement to simply say there was tension at the breakfast table the next morning. Not only were Ron and Harry the only ones who had to get up so early, but it also seemed like neither of them had really slept. Harry had come back from Draco’s dorm quite late, and judging by the redness in Ron’s eyes he had spent the night studying. Or at least trying to. It was the first time they were about to take an exam they hadn’t studied together for, and despite the recent events, Harry wasn’t happy about it. He also felt immensely guilty for what he had said to Ron the previous day - that he should just admit he didn’t really want to be an Auror. Hadn’t it been Harry himself who had said to Hermione, that they should let Ron figure it out on his own?
“She was very short and observant,” McGonagall said. “I hadn’t expected her to have such a thick foreign accent after having taught in London for so long, but other than that…”
“Do you have Calming Droughts?”
"Yes. Thank you," Harry said after swallowing down a "if it's not too much trouble". Draco's influence was starting to wear off on him.
"Movies?" Draco echoed. "You mean like, a movie theatre?"
“Yeah, alright," Harry said. “Let me think.” Last Saturday. The thunderstorm… That’s what must have taken Neville so long in the Owlery! He had seen the postcard and panicked because he had promised not to tell anyone about the time Malfoy had spent the night in Harry’s room. But who had he told?
“Not long ago," he started, still throwing glances behind his shoulders (as if there was anyone else in the painting), “I overheard Mr. Longbottom and Miss Granger talking, not far from where you’re standing now.”
“No," Draco said with a voice that sounded like an order. “Stop talking.”
"But?"
"You must see now why I can't come."
(See the end of the chapter for
“To tell you, my asshat friend, that he was offered a promotion to Head of the Department last October. They gave him until New Year’s to consider.”
"If I asked you… would you be my boyfriend?" Harry eventually asked.
“Not that I’m aware of,” Draco said, but then sneezed again. His lungs felt like they were full of stinging nettle all of a sudden.
Later that evening Harry heard a knock on his window. Behind it was Remus’ owl, looking quite miserable as it stared at Harry from the rain with its big, round eyes. Harry rushed to let it in, and it gave a displeased hoot as it flew in and settled on the backrest of Harry’s chair, water dripping from its feathers.
“Nothing," Harry said. “Thought I saw someone going to Diagon Alley, but it was probably nothing…”
And yet despite this, Draco was secretly relieved and even a little excited to finally have someone to talk to. He had spent the first year pretty much in his dorm, studying and failing miserably whenever he tried to cook something for himself, only coming out for classes and occasionally at night to brew himself Calming Drought when he couldn’t sleep. He hadn’t expected his second year at Darthorn to be any different, and it was actually kind of baffling how fast things had changed. Just because of a small coincidence - hadn’t Draco been late that first morning, he wouldn’t have been assigned a seat next to Potter, and none of this would have happened.
the kinky one? You’re one to talk, Mr. I-like-to-pin-people-down-and-be-bitten.”
“And we
“He thought Draco’s name sounded stupid," Hermione sighed, clearly embarrassed for her boyfriend's behalf. “So it was really Ron who started it.”
“Hm.”
The article went on to describe how Lucius had shown up and argued with Draco, although the source apparently hadn’t heard any of the conversation. A Gringott’s employee had gone anonymous to reveal that Draco’s rights to the family funds had been discontinued over a year ago.
“Well, she’s always been a peculiar one," Harry admitted. “But she also tends to see people for what they are instead of… Reputations and the like. By the way - how does she know you can see thestrals?”
Harry stopped talking when he noticed Lucius Malfoy walking towards them. Draco probably saw Harry’s expression change as he looked behind him and quickly turned back to face Harry, refusing to look at his father as he approached them.
Harry laughed. He had missed Neville, he now realized.
“With the price of that coat I wouldn’t think it bold to assume the pockets don’t tear,” Harry noted.
Draco sat up, feeling light-headed. He was still trying to process he had
Draco's fingers were tracing nonsense patterns onto Harry's knee as Draco talked, his voice absent.
They stopped in front of Harry’s dorm. Harry avoided looking at Larry in the portrait.
Draco reached into his pocket and pulled out a clear plastic bag that contained something… alive. Squirming, slimy and black in colour.
“To be honest, I’d be more interested in hearing how the hell she pulled that off. Year two… Are you sure you’re not just fucking with me?”
“I see,” Draco said, a smile lingering in the corner of his mouth. “So you’re just the artisté.”
“Who have you been talking to?”
Harry ran straight into someone and found himself looking up at Draco’s gray eyes. They widened in surprise or confusion as he probably noticed how bloodshot Harry’s eyes were.
“Out of spite I suppose," Draco said. “She can be a real bitch when someone hurts her feelings.”
“What happened?”
Draco felt his blood boil. Potter was talking to him like he was negotiating with a toddler.
The image of Seamus' hand on Dean's thigh returned to Harry's mind. He frowned.
“Do I look like I care, Weasley?” Draco squinted at him as he pushed past him and walked out of the flat.
“Sorry. You’ll get to come along next time, I promise.”
They were slurping their noodles (well, not
“So, will you read the article?” Granger said. "You know a lot about potions, so I would appreciate a second opinion."
“Some of us have jobs, though,” Theodore huffed. “I don’t have time for ‘eventually’.”
“Yeah," Harry said. “Is… Is something the matter?”
“If you had let Voldemort kill you, I’d be dead too," Harry said. “And so would all of my friends. And probably that nurse we talked to at St.Mary’s.”
“What was I supposed to do, just leave you on the street, wailing because you couldn't find Pansy? In case you didn’t know, I don’t have the password to your dorm, so I couldn’t take you there. Or would you have liked that, Draco? Your Slytherin friends seeing me haul you to your room?”
“What’s the worst thing that could happen?” Draco said. “I might not die if I splinch, but that’s about all I can think of.”
for each other, it made me feel so empty inside because I knew I was missing out on something I wasn’t even capable of.”
“She’s not your mother, you... spineless…”
“Stay safe,” Hermione said and hugged them both, Draco a little longer.
Neville turned to look at Draco, and it could be seen in his eyes that he would rather not repeat the next step.
“Yeah," he said and immediately regretted it. He could have just said, no thanks and gotten his shit together before spending more time with Draco instead of making him uncomfortable with his moping. “Uh, sure. Let’s go to my room?”
“Draco," he then said. “Would you like to be my friend?” Maybe it was what they both secretly wanted. Maybe. Harry hoped.
"You could have a great future in Russia," she continues excitedly and lowers her voice. "They think highly of us for what we did. And what
"Come on," Neville said. "It's just Harry. No need to be afraid."
Theodore Nott was no longer in the dorm when Harry left. Although it is debatable whether Harry would have noticed him in the first place, in his current mental state. He could’ve as well been walking a foot above the floor. He felt surreal, but not in a scary, dissociative way. Instead, it was like he had been picked up, given a good shake and put back down in a world that, in place of hostility and unfortunate events, was all of a sudden ripe with goodness and stars, endless possibilities for happiness written in them. Though Harry could not see his own face, he was sure a stunned grin would be plastered across it for a good few weeks if not forever.
looking tired and lucky. The latter was mostly due to the hickey.
“Sounds like you’ve spent quite a lot of time with him," Hermione said in an annoyingly neutral tone that didn’t give Harry any clues as to what she was thinking.
“These are the last ones," Neville said with an excited face. “Hermione and I have been making them all week. Oh, wait - I’ll show you.” Neville got up, careful not to mess up the blanket that had been covering both his and Hermione’s legs. He went into his room and came back holding one of his legged pots.
Harry looked as Draco as he spoke of things he had probably never talked to anyone about in his life, and couldn’t help but to feel sorry for him, despite everything.
“And what if I do?” Harry said, giving Draco’s teasing his best challenge. That was clearly enough to drive Draco over an edge. Something in his eyes turned hazy, too far in to focus anymore, and he pushed Harry back against the wall. He was so close Harry could feel his hot breathing on his lips.
"Can't you just, stupefy it or something? Or open the window?" Harry groaned.
"I wasn't expecting it either. I've never had a crush like this before where I..." Harry struggled to grasp the words. "Couldn't, physically
Harry gave a sigh and tried to gather his thoughts. It didn't help that he was still baffled himself by it all; on the other hand it felt like it had taken a thousand restless days and even more restless nights to get to know Draco like this, to realize he fancied him, but then on the other hand, now that he was talking to Remus it became clearer that all this had happened in the course of a mere two months. Everything, everything had changed, for reasons that… That felt painfully obvious but out of reach for everyone who wasn't Harry.
“Do I look like I care, Potter? Go take a nap. I’ll meet you in the courtyard at midnight.” Draco got up and left, and Harry stared after him, confused and frightened at the realization that his heart was pounding. Not manically. But out of anticipation.
Dean and Seamus were now both staring at Harry.
“I’m sure Spencer would be very amused to hear whatever you have to say after you all but blackmailed your supervisor into giving you that promotion last year,” Harry said. He didn’t seem overjoyed to see Theodore, but nor was he as agonized by his very existence as he had been during their Darthorn years. Now, more than anything, Harry seemed uninterested in his opinions.
"And have your friends accepted him?"
"So is that…"
"It’s
“I didn’t get the case from Tonks. She already knows I’m quitting. In fact, from what Arthur tells me, some people pretty high up had planned to keep me out of this altogether.”
“You know he’s just fucking with you, right?” Dean said to Harry as he sat down on the bed after moving some of the CDs out of the way.
“I was just wondering - what if we, uh… Haven’t improved?”
"Why did you kiss me back?" Harry asked.
“I don’t see why not,” Draco said. “I’m under the impression we’re staying there as well.”
Harry didn’t get to the end of his sentence before Dean and Seamus strolled out of Dean’s room, and judging by the way Seamus’ hair was pointing up at the back of his head, they hadn’t been studying either.
“You don’t want me to?”
“I’m pretty sure you just spit a little on my face.”
Potter mumbled something incomprehensible and rolled over. Draco huffed impatiently and pushed him again, harder this time.
Harry smiled.
"But why?" Narcissa asks, her voice trembling. "Why him?"
After a rough morning, Harry gets something to look forward to. But how much anticipation is too much anticipation?
"Alright," Harry said after a moment of contemplation. "But we can't apparate to Hogwarts from there."
Draco stared at Harry.
“So you agree with him? You’d rather I hadn’t kissed you?”
Before they left, Draco searched through a box under his bed and put something in his pocket.
"Maybe we're just getting old," Harry said, pulling back wisps of black hair that had glued themselves onto his forehead. "Do you by any chance remember the new password?"
“So does HIV”, Seamus huffed. “And what about lube?”
"Okay, just - drop it, alright? I didn't remember."
Ron did them both the courtesy of waving his hand as if Draco's presence in his house on Christmas Day was the most natural thing that had ever happened.
Harry had a feeling he was about to walk into something as much catastrophic as it was alluring.
Confused as to what else he was supposed to do, he started look for clothes to wear. He somehow managed to put on his red hoodie the wrong way around twice before getting it right. He also put on his winter coat and a hat Hermione had knitted for him the previous Christmas, expecting it to be freezing outside. He then pocketed his wand and sneaked out of the apartment.
?” Harry said.
Hey guys! Just quickly letting you know that I've started at a new job, so it may take a bit longer than usual for the next chapter to be published. I want to take my time with that one since something quite special happens in it... ;)
“Uh”, Harry said. His three friends were looking at him in anticipation, although Ron’s expression was more derived from some kind of morbid curiosity by the looks of it.
“Yeah," Harry said. “Lame.” There was a wisp of hair in front of Draco's eyes, and Harry could tell from his breathing that he had managed to catch him purely because of adrenaline. Harry noticed Draco’s bottom lip was a little chapped near the corners of his mouth.
Neville stayed silent for a moment, and then he gave a brief smile.
“Well he-” Ron stopped talking and his eyes widened in realization. “You’re telling me you've done it
Harry could tell from the way Draco turned around and started to search through drawers for something, that he had let more of his thoughts come out than had been his intention.
“So, are we studying or does hearing about Pansy Parkinson somehow make you less stressed out?”
Draco sat back up.
“Merlin," she said after calming down a bit, “it’s only the second week and I’m already so tired I could fall asleep right here.”
Seamus gasped.
“I’m not sure you want to know," Draco said. “Now, I think you’d better be on your way before I make such a fool of you that you’ll never want to show your face again, not even in Moscow.”
“I wish we could," Draco said. “I really fucking wish we could. And the worst thing is, it doesn’t even bother me the most how I treated you, but that I never… I never had real friends. And I’d look at you and Granger and Weasley doing everything together and I tried, I tried
"Shrek," Draco repeated. "What's that?"
Harry sat on Dean’s writing desk chair and watched as Seamus wrote down names of songs he was considering for the mixtape.
and open the door before he had even processed what Harry had actually said.
Don’t look at Harry Potter at lunch in the Great Hall when he’s laughing with his friends. Don’t think about the way his hair sticks up on its own before you go to sleep. Never write his name when you doodle on parchment scraps. Not even just to see how it would look in your handwriting. And when the image of the way his forearms look when he rolls up his sleeves creeps into your thoughts when you’re touching yourself, think about something else. Anything else, but not him. Not his voice, not the veins on his hands, not even his shadow. Not him.
There was no defensiveness in Harry’s eyes when he looked at Draco, reached for his arm, but Draco didn’t let him.
“You brought me here because you want to apologize to me?”
“And thundering too," Neville said, placing the nearly finished-looking sock in his lap. “Did you hear it?”
"Um, I- How about Draco? Is that too strange?"
“There’s nothing brave about torturing spiders," Harry said. ”I saw you in the mirror. Voldemort had killed me the previous night, and he - I
Harry nodded as a thanks when Ron handed him a cup of tea over the table.
“Many people are pale,” Harry said, “but that doesn’t mean they’re incapable of murder. Of course, there’s no pointing fingers before I’ve mapped out who else was in the castle.”
Draco frowned and stared at Harry, his eyes full of questions that Harry didn’t have answers for. A second of excruciating silence went by. Harry heard the humming of his own bloodflow in his ears. Draco had frozen still, and looked like he was about to say something but decided against it at the last minute. Harry was fairly certain Malfoy was about to storm out any second now, but then Draco grabbed his face and kissed him. Harry felt his knees go weak and kissed back, and then the Auror Handbook fell on the floor with a thump. Draco pulled back and stared at Harry. Neither of them said anything, but Harry knew what Draco was thinking. Are we really doing this?
“I think that would be all for now,” he said and got up, and Draco did the same. “Thank you, McGonagall. I will get to the bottom of this.”
Draco looked at Harry, and Harry saw in his face that he hadn’t.
“You know about atoms?”
"My, they certainly did,” McGonagall said, and Draco remarked that a certain hoarseness, perhaps induced by old age, had come to be in her voice. Even so, it held all the power of its days of prime, if not more. The Headmistress continued.
Draco turned to the door to go looking for Harry, but his knees gave in. Two inter-continental apparitions in one day had apparently been too much for his body... He was vaguely aware that he had fallen as a gnawing headache hit him. He groaned and suddenly felt like he was going to throw up. He tried to support his upper body on his elbows so he could get up, but the effort quickly faded with a thump into a blurred vision, and then nothing.
, but that one’s
“What is Nott even studying here?” Harry asked as he sat down on the chair, careful not to bother the owl. “He doesn’t really strike me as the type to be at Darthorn.” Harry was right - Darthorn was a famously Muggle-positive institution and Theodore... well, he was famously
"It's called a wadjet. The ancient Egyptians used them as a talisman for protection, good health and royal power. They'd be buried with pharaohs to ensure safety for them in the afterlife." Draco handed the amulet to Harry, allowing him to inspect it more closely.
Harry’s smile eventually faded, and he looked at his best friend across the table.
“Well, I," Harry said, rubbing the back of his neck, “I guess it’s more like, I keep pestering him and he puts up with it.”
“Oh I’m sure," Harry said. “See, Ron and I used the Polyjuice Potion to transform into Crabbe and Goyle.” Harry thoroughly enjoyed the face that Draco was making.
“You can’t fix it for him," Harry said. “I think we’ll just have to let him figure this one out on his own.”
"I'm not killing it," Draco announced, ducking his head at the insect even though it had now flown two feet above his head. "Fuck no."
"We're on the same side now, Malfoy."
“Uh," Harry said and started to feel restless as he realized all the questions he had for Malfoy had escaped him. “Why haven’t you been in class?” That seemed like a safe one to start with.
“A postcard - for Draco and I? Are you sure?” Harry couldn’t think of anyone who would have known both Draco and him well enough to send a postcard, let alone addressed to both of them as if they were a couple or something.
The students started to stir in protest, but the professor hadn't finished talking.
“Listen, I’m sorry, but-”
“What?” Draco said when he noticed Harry’s expression. “You honestly think I’ll let people talk to you like that? Come on. He’ll turn back in a few minutes.”
“She hasn’t passed through here," Larry noted. “Maybe you should check the Ladies’ dormitories?”
Draco felt almost relieved at the realisation that that was all the woman wanted from him.
“And… finished," Ron said after adding one last dot on the parchment. He laid down his quill, stretched and leaned back in his chair. He had a victorious smile spread across his face.
“Alright, I’m sorry, my bad, won't happen again, now could I-”
“I wish my brothers fought like you," Ron said, clearly relaxing a little bit. “Instead of just, jinxing all my socks into spiders. I prefer the talking even though I’m not that good at it.”
Harry stopped reading when the paragraph went on to describe what Amortentia looked like. Harry had seen it before, and he remembered it as an irridescent concoction of colours that, to him, had smelled like trackle tart, wood and Ginny Weasley.
"Why did it work that time? After the battle?"
Harry tried pulling one of the drawers on the desk. It was locked. Draco walked up next to him, pointed his wand at the lock and said: “
"You look so good," Harry mouthed, looking at Draco's flushed face, some of it covered by his messed up hair.
Harry noticed something in the background of the portrait, so far away that had Larry tried to walk there, it would have probably taken him at least twenty minutes. A distant shadow of… a forest?
"Breathe," Draco said. “Look at me - breathe in with me, okay? I’m not going to make you take the potion.”
“You cook?”
Draco let himself fall onto his bed, still holding onto Harry like he was a stuffed animal.
"Oh?" Harry said, defiantly tilting his head. "Prove it."
"Don't-" Narcissa straightens her posture and pushes back the horrified expression that has momentarily escaped her. "Don't say that."
“Oh, so that was just, a very friendly snogging I just walked in on? Or did he give you a love potion or something?”
A blue cloud of sparks approached Theodore, wrapping around him, and he started to shrink.
how to brew it at Hogwarts.”
"Do you forgive me?" He asked.
“Oh, yes, it’s all in there,” Gwen said, handing Harry a file with the familiar Ministry emblem. “I interviewed everyone present before you arrived, so you should find all the basics in there.”
that.
“What the hell is a Moon Frog?” He whispered.
Draco closed the door behind him, walked to Harry and sat down on the floor in front of him. He took a vial from his pocket and showed it to Harry, whose eyes widened in terror as he saw it. He shook his head.
“Oh right, shit. I forgot," Draco said. “You have that exam tomorrow.”
"He isn't my friend," Draco says. He tilts his head and studies Narcissa with his eyes in that all too familiar way.
“Draco," Harry said. “I’m now going to teach you something very important about friendship, so listen closely.”
"Do you?"
“Harry?” Draco said as softly as he could. There was no answer, but Draco could hear movement. It sounded like Harry was in the far corner of the room. Draco remembered the window, and though he didn’t think Harry was in that kind of state of mind, he started to worry about it. He placed his hand on the door handle.
“By the way, Neville knows about what happened with the Amortentia.”
“Can you imagine though?” He said, gesturing in front of himself like creating an imaginary picture. “Me just, looking like an absolute crackhead on the cover of the Prophet with a headline like, ‘The Boy Who Lived To Flash Oncoming Traffic on Regent Street’.”
Harry suddenly stopped and turned towards Draco so that he couldn’t see the person walking towards them from the other end of the corridor.
The pile of laundry on the chair looked like it had been tossed there by someone who was so lazy that they kept moving the pile from the chair to the bed in an effort to avoid dealing with it.
“Listen mate, you can do whatever you want but if you ask me, kissing that nut job is a thought you maybe would’ve been better off keeping to yourself.”
"Like tar with a little piss in it if I'm being perfectly honest."
The floorboards Harry was staring at started to turn blurry. He felt fear grabbing him by the shoulders, whispering ugly truths into his ears. He
“Stop looking at me," Draco said.
Harry grinned.
“You…”
”. Harry tried not to make much of a mental note of it but couldn’t really help himself. By the time they got to Draco’s room he had already repeated it in his thoughts so many times he knew he was never going to forget it.
a date.”
“Draco?”
"We never were a 'thing'," Malfoy said and sipped from his thermos. "Besides, I don't hang out with her since the - actually, why am I bothering to explain this to you? It's not like it's any of your business."
“Because, Mr. Malfoy, it is Mr. Potter’s job as an Auror to not go insane when he is subjected to such horrors.”
“But Hagrid teaches that,” Harry said with an absent voice, his brows creasing in a frown. Draco could almost hear cogs turning inside his head.
“That’s it!” Granger said, snapping her fingers.
At this point Harry was well aware that he was turning bright red in the face.
Draco swallowed down, trying to keep his composure. He knew better than to reveal his fear in this company, although grandmother Yana had most likely noticed it already.
"It's a Russian spell," Draco said as placed his wand back into his pocket. "Father used it to save space in the bookshelves… One book can fit six or seven books before the words start to spill out."
“Careful, Potter," Draco laughed as he helped Harry stand up straight. “It’d be pretty lame of you to smash your head on the floor and die after surviving the killing curse twice, don’t you think?”
“Could be anything," Harry said. “Apparently there’s like, sixteen different scenarios you can get.”
"I wouldn't do that even if it was allowed", Neville said and went to get a glass of water. "The seedlings don't take very well to all that pressure. I'll have to go water them soon before the mandrake starts a riot."
Dean and Seamus had spread papers, quills and bottles of coloured ink all over the kitchen table. It seemed Dean was trying to teach Seamus how to draw, and was having very little success at it. Seamus was impatient and gave up easily.
using protection, right?” Seamus said.
Harry had been playing with Teddy in Remus and Tonks' garden - despite Harry's offer the couple had refused to live at Grimmauld Place and had instead acquired a frankly dreamy little farmhouse in the countryside - when the toddler's hair had suddenly changed colours. Harry's first reaction had been to panic. He had picked the boy up from the swing that Tonks had charmed into place under a tree the previous summer, and ran back to the house, terrified that he had somehow accidentally transfigured Teddy's hair from its previous ginger tone to this coal colour that perfectly matched his own. It wasn't Remus' reaction that Harry was worried about. The man was a patient and calm father who rarely raised his voice. Tonks, although still as cheerful and curious as ever, was also fiercely protective of her son, and while Harry was considered a part of the family, he didn't like the idea of having to be the one to tell her that he accidentally jinxed her toddler. However, to Harry's surprise, Tonks had been moved to tears when she had seen her son's changed appearance. Harry had realized what was happening only when the boy's hair had turned back into its original colour as he had ran into his mother's embrace.
"For Rolf Scamander? To go to Africa with him instead of finishing college?"
Draco had said Harry looked best when he was busy doing something. Once more, Harry didn’t disagree with him; the problem was that so did Draco. He was hunching over his sketchbook, his knee curled under it and his other leg resting against Harry’s chair. He was wearing a black jumper, the collar of a striped shirt that wasn’t done up all the way, effortlessly folded over the neckline. Harry couldn’t decide which Draco he liked more: the casual Draco in hoodies and joggers he only ever seemed to catch a glimpse of accidentally, or this Draco, who always managed to look stylish and put together despite his wardrobe consisting of items that, out of context, could have belonged to someone’s grandfather.
"Well, yeah… I guess I meant more like - I'm not used to having someone just,
Harry wasn't sure what he had been expecting, but it hadn't been dozens of ceramic pots with little legs and feet, all filled with soil and plants Harry didn't recognize. They followed Neville into the dorm in a neat queue, marching like a little parade of plants, and when Neville opened the door into his room, they all went in. Neville closed the door after them and Harry didn't even bother to ask how Neville had room to sleep with all those plants in his room. He probably didn't.
“So Arthur gave you the case?”
“What time of year?”
Desperate to turn the attention away from his own arousal before it would spill over, Harry reached down for Draco's hand and pinned it against the mattress beside them to keep it from tormenting him at least for a moment, and reached back down with his other hand to tease Draco, gently running his fingers over his crotch where his trousers were pulled taut before lapping his palm over it. The problem was, Harry knew exactly how good it felt, and his blood scorched in his veins in reaction as Draco's back arched and he murmured something incomprehensible against Harry's mouth.
“Yes,” Neville said. “She said she had always heard great things about the Hogwarts greenhouses, so she wanted to visit them before leaving. She said nothing grows from where she’s from, not even in greenhouses. So I showed her around, and she was very impressed with my Knotgrass.”
"Even mum is begging me to return it," Draco said as Harry handed the amulet back to him.
“What?” Harry said, sure that his brain had somehow managed to completely mishear what Malfoy had said.
Harry put on his uniform jacket and quickly glanced in the mirror before leaving. He tied his hair up into a silly-looking bun just to spite Ron. He tried to throw his best confident smile at his reflection, but was unable to impress himself. Why do you care if Malfoy is avoiding you, he imagined his reflection asking. He didn’t have an answer for that.
“Like what?”
“You look a little dazed is all," Harry said, and he wasn’t wrong. Draco kept staring at the same place without blinking for unnerving amounts of time.
"Hm?"
“Okay. Will you put it on the bed? I won’t touch it, I promise.”
“What I mean to say is, you
Draco huffed in a way that said, what else would he have done?
“Harry likes you," Granger said. “He told me - or, it became pretty obvious, when he started to...”
“Merlin’s beard - William Weasley, if you don’t tell Victoire to stop climbing the shelves in my pantry-”
“At least the roast’s good,” George pointed out.
Hermione took a newspaper from Ron's hands and handed it to Harry.
"Blushing, Draco?"
“How come?”
Harry finally gets around to reading the postcard he and Draco received from Luna. It leaves him with many questions, most of which are soon forgotten about as Harry finds his mind wandering towards activities far more... stimulating, than what can be said about answering letters.
"I suppose I'll find out."
“To shake my hand. Left me hanging for ten years.”
"You'd think it was pretty obvious at this point that I don't agree with what you taught me."
hand though," Harry said. Surely he had known where that sort of thing would lead. It was inevitable. He was Harry Potter, and if they dated, sooner or later everyone would know.
Draco still hadn't come. Harry looked at his watch. Maybe he had misunderstood something and Malfoy was already waiting for him outside?
“What did I say to you and Ron? When you talked to me as Crabbe and Goyle? Fuck, I was cringey back then…”
Harry Potter was sleeping in class. Draco kept glancing at him when the other students were being loud and when the token, distant scream that no one ever got any explanation for, echoed in the hallway. No noise seemed to be obnoxious enough to disturb Potter’s sleep, though. He had crossed his arms on the table and was resting his head on them, his face completely hidden within the mane of hair that he sometimes wore in a rather endearing looking bun.
"So, how long have you two been going out?" Harry asked, making effort to sound casual and also to ignore what had just happened.
“What’s that?” Harry asked as he went to fill up the kettle.
Harry read the headline.
“I did ask you not to encourage her,” Harry said, cocking his brow.
Draco held out his hand over the table. Harry quickly leaned forward and took it.
“But what if this whole Auror thing just isn’t right for me?”
“Special interest in him?” Larry smiled. “Well, you
"Why is Adrik locked up?" He asked as grandmother Yana read over the documents and then sent Ksenia to fetch the owls.
“You cut your hair," Hermione said in an oddly high-pitched voice.
Weasley just stared at Draco blankly, as if he had been speaking in a foreign language.
Harry glanced at Malfoy. Malfoy nodded towards the professor, urging Harry to speak first.
“Yes, I-”
Harry slipped his hand under Draco's hoodie and the shirt he was wearing underneath, his fingers wandering on the impossibly velvety skin. It was getting hot and without breaking the kiss, Draco sat up, Harry following him as they both, hands trembling with long unseen need, helped each other out of their hoodies. Draco wore a black T-shirt underneath, Harry noticed, and soon his hands were already both under it, claiming every new inch of bare skin as Harry reached for Draco's neck, lips brushing past his ear.
“Why?” Harry said, surprised that Draco was even willing to participate.
“Well what’s the matter, I thought you like dick now," Ron sneered.
“Okay," Harry said, letting out an amused laugh. He looked into Seamus’ eyes, and they were was squinting at him as if Seamus was evaluating Harry somehow.
“I asked how you’re holding up in Magical Injury," Ron said, blissfully oblivious. He took a big gulp from his own mug. “Merlin, if I was paired up with Malfoy I'm not sure I'd bother to show up.”
"Well, that's - that's a surprise, isn't it?"
," Lucius said, glancing at Harry and making it very clear he was
“You can
"Well, yes."
"Maybe so. But that's not really my problem, is it?" A familiar ice flashed in Draco's eyes and in his tone and Harry started to get worried, but Remus didn't seem to mind.
“Positively," Larry said. “Mr. Longbottom looked most distressed over the matter! I even heard him say, ‘Harry is going to kill me if he finds out’.”
“Tell me what, exactly, Theo?”
“I think we ought to spare the innocent one”, Seamus said. His friends nodded in agreement.
“Skepperus gave us a new assignment to make up for what happened at the hospital.”
” rolled out of Harry’s mouth before he realised his words were hearable again.
“That means I’m getting better right?”
“Are your hands broken Jefferson? I have faith in your abilities to administer treatment within a room that is localised for the more minor injuries that we get on this ward. Have I put too much trust in you?” Draco hardened his glare for effect before looking back down at the papers stacked in front of him. He pretended to read as the words swirled on the page; the quill in Draco’s closed fist was bending from his vice-like grip.
Grey eyes stared intensely into his own once more. The red-light escaping Malfoy’s palms cascaded a flushed tint across Malfoy’s pale skin. His platinum hair shone rose-gold, his eyes a deep metallic. Malfoys lips were dark pink, moving quickly as he uttered the incantations. Malfoy wrapped his fingers around Harry’s sides. His fingertips pressed hard against his flesh. Harry bit down harder on his lip, tasting copper on his tongue. His prick twitched.
After the war the Ministry allocated more funding to the wizarding hospital – originally to keep up with treating injured victims of war, but continued almost as reparations for the lives that were needlessly lost due to the corruption and ignorance of the, now late, ex-Minister of Magic: Cornelius Fudge. Harry’s mind wandered back to his fourth year at Hogwarts, and the way the ex-ministers’ face contorted with rage in response to the news of Voldemort’s return. Harry bit his tongue and mentally strained to keep his mind from wandering far; he did not wish to think ill of the dead. Harry did not have to keep his thoughts on a mental leash for long, as a young blonde-haired medi-nurse softly called his name as she opened the door to the room.
We have family that isn’t blood, and blood that isn’t family, Potter.”
“If you’re late I’ll file a restraining order.”
Once the knot was tied, Malfoy stepped away from Harry and Harry immediately missed his presence. “Medi-Nurse Mayford will be here shortly. Rest up.”
“Yeah but that’s only because of how wide his eyes were-“
“But, you know, I can’t really blame you for all of it," Harry said, turning to look at Draco again. “We can’t choose the way we’re brought up.”
“What mirror? What did it look like?”
“So the heir knows I stole it from father,” Draco said. “He needs it to save Adrik… He assumes I sold it, so now he’s looking for it...”
“Harry darling, look at you! The new glasses and everything - how wonderful to see you!”
“The place will be swarming with Ministry officials,” Arthur said. “I think it’s the best option you two have right now.”
“Not much. She kept on babbling and I was trying really hard to ignore her but she didn’t really seem to get the hint.”
“Are you always this easily provoked when you’re at work?” Draco said, tilting his head. He ran a finger along Harry’s jawline. “I should come along more often.”
“The password.”
“It’s true what they write in the Prophet. I’m not- They don’t want anything to...”
Draco glanced at Harry and smiled somehow bashfully.
“Yeah. These sort of things tend to come with side effects.”
"She's right, you know," Ron Weasley, armed with a grin, said. He was leaning onto the wall, arms crossed in front of him.
The Parkinson girl fails in giving Draco Amortentia, and Narcissa can't help but think she did so on purpose. Either way, it's surprising. Narcissa never expected the girl's loyalty to be greater towards Draco than her parents who were both doing time in Azkaban - and who Lucius had promised to help in exchange for the girl's trouble.
"You’re good at potions, so it wouldn’t have made sense for you to repeatedly get something wrong, especially if even professor Abboud couldn’t figure out what it was. And the other ingredients, well, they’re just not as likely allergenes.”
"Why am I here?"
“I - what?” Draco felt blood rushing to his face.
“My therapist once said something interesting to me,” he said. “She said we can’t save people. That we can only love them.”
The cooing continued until Harry started to blush a little, and then the woman turned to look at Draco. Draco couldn’t quite read her expression.
Hermione sighed.
"Well, there's always bisexuals," Dean pointed out.
- are you on crack?” He then asked, raising his eyebrows. “Are you
Harry tried to contain his smile.
"Nothing about this is normal," Draco huffed.
“Does Draco like you back?” Hermione asked.
"You used one from the battle?"
"Hey," Harry said.
“Really?” Harry asked. He looked at Hermione, unsure of why his heart was beating so fast for her approval. “It’s not just you being diplomatic?”
“Uh," Harry said. “What was the question again?”
“I lied," Harry said, and Draco had a sudden sinking feeling.
“Joke’s on you”, Draco said, turning to look at Harry, “Dostoevsky was a Muggle.”
Ron and Harry make up just in time for their Practical Evaluation. However, the exam proves to be particularly challenging for one of them...
Draco watched her with eyes full of loathing. How he hated this woman! He could hardly believe the thing he had wanted the most as a child was for her to notice him. The last thing he wanted now was to play her game of calm remarks that contained venom inside, but he knew he had to play along if he wanted to get the information he needed to get back home.
“And he’s a Muggle, right? So why do people call him Spider-Man?”
“I think that would apply to you if you didn’t shave your armpit hair”, Seamus said.
Harry Potter? He’s the Golden Boy of the whole department. The man would arrest his own mother if it meant being praised by his supervisors, and the media. Well, you know what I mean.”
Harry hummed his response, his hands looking for tack on Draco’s back, but Draco didn’t let him spare his words so easily. He dragged his thumb along Harry’s lower lip.
“What are the questions then?”
Harry tried to say something, but his voice was muffled against Draco’s hoodie as he shifted positions so that he could let Harry lean on him easier.
Draco smiled.
Often Draco was tempted to guilt Harry about being away so much, but even more often he found himself unable to. There was something about a feeling of urgency and threat that seemed to bring Harry alive somehow. The mental struggles he had faced during their time at Darthorn were now far in the past, and unfortunately some of Harry’s transparency had disappeared with them. It was a trait Draco had found very attractive about him. The way his temper riled up, or his smile when he was happy, even his panic. He had lived on extremes, that boy. But he was twenty-seven years old now, and he had learned to self-regulate. Or perhaps it just wasn’t Draco who got to see that side of him, now. Maybe it was the other Aurors or the criminals Harry chased or Ron, whenever the two of them met up for pints after Ron had won an important game. Either way, it was Draco who got the worn-down Harry, the mildly stressed Harry, the content but not beaming-Harry. And maybe that was for the best.
“Am too," Draco said, his eyebrows raising as if having just received a challenge. "Get up."
together or anything, but... Was the idea of it alone so strange that they could be seen holding hands and people would just, ignore it rather than address it?
Harry nearly choked on his tea. It was no news that word got around fast in his friend group, but the thing was, he had only left Draco’s dorm ten minutes ago. And no one knew what had happened, except maybe Theodore Nott, provided Draco’s charm on the door had worn off at some point.
“Year two?” Draco said. “Granger made Polyjuice Potion in
"Roughly 5000 years."
Harry noticed Draco's expression change.
Draco stopped moving but didn’t turn to look at Harry.
“Yes," Draco said reluctantly.
Grandmother Yana tilted her head.
Draco hesitated.
After spending about an hour with Draco on the rooftop of the dorms building, Harry returned downstairs to his dorm. He was in a good mood from the amount of laughter that had taken place, but also a little confused. In awe was maybe a better word for it. He frankly hadn’t expected Draco to be so fun to be around. Especially the way he seemed to have gotten genuinely angry for Harry, when Harry had told him about the articles the Prophet had written about him during his stay at St Mungo’s, had made Harry feel oddly warm and fuzzy inside. Not that Ron and Hermione’s reaction had been significantly different, but something about the way Draco had called the reporters cretins made Harry smile every time he thought about it.
“My best was always pretty pathetic.”
"What, because you like listening to me talk all of a sudden?"
"I don't know, I guess… I did use a different memory. One I didn't have before that day."
"Do you have something," Harry breathed as they frantically undressed as much as was necessary, all the while lost in a kiss that never seemed to fail to get more intense. Draco reached for his wand that lay on the floor next to the bed, said something that Harry had trouble understanding but that was apparently some kind of lube spell - a small pool of translucent
“What?” Ron said, already laughing a little bit just to Harry’s sudden outburst.
"Hey, aren't you forgetting something?" Ron then said, turning to look at Harry.
“Yeah. Write something like, ‘someone might even put it in an unsuspecting ex-boyfriend’s coffee in an effort to win them back’.”
“You can’t tell anyone. About what happened.”
“Hey, I’m not that thick, okay? Here’s the facts: Harry and I were in his room, on his bed, Harry on top of me, we’re making out, door closed, right?”
And not five minutes later Harry had him in his mouth, just like he had asked, and Draco was putting all his effort into not coming yet, but Merlin it had been a while and he
“Good," Draco said. “Of which building?”
“Gwen is very pretty,” Draco admitted as he slid that same finger into Harry’s mouth, carefully holding back from showing any kind of reaction when Harry’s tongue brushed past it, “and surely she could have anyone she likes.”
“Oh... But who did it before you came here?”
"Dursleys," Harry corrected.
“Yeah," Harry said. “I guess you’re right. But, I’ll tell him myself, okay?”
"No- no, you can't," Ron said, blocking Harry's way as he tried to reach the door.
“I couldn’t do it, I didn’t know how - I just couldn’t stop looking at it. It was so
“Not that much they don’t," Ron huffed. “He called Hermione a mudblood, Harry, he - he broke your nose, he tried to kill Dumbledore! He almost killed me with that poisoned mead! I can’t believe I have to explain this to you - you can’t just pretend that never happened. He’s vicious!”
“That should do the trick," Hermione said. She held out her hand and Draco gave the paper back to her.
"I'm sorry about earlier. It's… it's a lot to handle sometimes."
“What happened?”
“Professor?”
Narcissa sees in her son's eyes that he  wishes he could have done more, that he still regrets the times he hesitated.
"Ah, the Potters. To what do I owe the pleasure?"
“No fucking way," Draco said and shined the light of his wand so that it illuminated the notebook.
Draco smiled.
“Don’t say that," Harry said, pushing Ron further away enough so he could look him in the eyes. “Hermione and I will help you, okay?”
"For instance - I didn't know that you could see yourself being with a man," Remus said. "Not that there's anything wrong with that, of course."
“I’m not gay, Ron, how many times do I have to tell you? I, I like both. Men and women, okay?”
"No they didn't," Ron blurted. "I mean, I was surprised alright. You'd be bloody surprised too if you walked in on Harry and I doing - doing that..."
“And where is the dorms building?”
Malfoy had a geometric picture of trees and mountains tattooed onto his left forearm.
"I don't think you understand," Draco says.
“I don’t know, Draco. You tell me.”
"Everyone does."
Harry was up first that day. He was guided into a tent that had been set up on the quidditch field and left there.
“But that makes you a quarter Russian”, Harry insisted. “Blimey… That would explain the hair and the eyes… And the sass.”
” Draco said, his wand making an S-shape in the air without him thinking about it, as was the case with most of the spells he used daily.
“I thought we weren’t going to the Burrow.”
“Nah mate, nothing like that. I can do it to you if you want - don’t even have to touch you or anything.”
“Well I’m injured.” Harry gestured to a red mark smeared lightly across his right temple.
“Side effects of skelegrow-“
Malfoy didn’t move. His hands were frozen on his collar. His entire frame was taught and solid. No one in the room breathed a sound. The other patients exchanged rapid glances between each other, their mouths were slightly agape from shock. They all waited as if they were on the point of a needle, waiting for what happens next.
“Potter?”
Thank you so much for your continued support with this fic, it honestly means the world to me, and makes me want to continue working on this and take you all on this journey with me <3
Malfoy let out a slow sigh, closing his eyes as he did it for dramatic effect. “I know the name of my colleague, Potter.” Malfoy opened his eyes and paused for a moment, examining Harry’s face. “Do you want a pepper-up potion?”
Harry thought again of the man who sat across from him at his dining room table that previous night.
“Your ribs aren’t near your crotch Harry.”
ooooo angst!!!
Harry nodded and pressed more of his body weight onto Hermione; he already feeling light-headed from exertion. The palm of Eliza’s hands turned blue as she placed them against Harry’s ribcage. The sensation that followed was peculiar; it felt like Harry’s organs had been lined with pillows. Eliza withdrew her hands and the blue light from her palms disappeared. “Okay, let’s get you home.”
. He told her all this before spilling the event that had just gone down, that made Harry went to crawl under a rock and die.
Please please please leave comments telling me what you guys think, I'd love to hear feedback!
“Are you ready to proceed with your second round of treatment, Potter?”
appear in front of them in blue, digital-clock style font. “Finish your breakfast Harry, and I’ll get everything ready for you.”
pathetic. “I’m not a sad sack.” He mumbled quietly.
Harry delicately began to undo the lace and opened the wrapping paper. Inside was a dark green button-down shirt made of what appeared to be soft cotton and silk; looking illuminous as it caught the light. The price tag was removed, but Harry knew this was expensive. He hastily removed his t-shirt and tried on the gift.
A wandless
She stared down at the ceramic shards on the floor and huffed. “Oh shit on it.” She grabbed her wand from the back pocket of her dungarees and casted a
The water ripped and churned.
“But what about my ribs?”
“Missing ribs huh, Potter? Where did they go?”
“How’s the rest of the case going Ron? Have I missed much?”
Harry swallowed uncomfortably. He knew it would be awkward, but this felt ten times worse than he imagined. He placed his mug down onto the table and fidgeted with the edges of the cushion he was sitting on. “About last night-“
Draco continued to stare for several moments until Harry’s soft chuckles subsided. “Okay fine.” Draco nodded slowly and casted a quick tempus incantation. “It’s 2:47pm right now, I should finish tonight at 7, so come to the Manor for 8.”
“I’m not on shift.” Malfoy refused to look up from the clipboard. “Where were you?”
“How’s your ribs?”
Kreacher?”
“The only thing that matters is that Harry is here now. If you own this ward like you say you do then Harry is receiving an excellent standard of care, even if it is from
“Who is it Kreacher?”
“Was his mouth hanging open?”
Malfoy snapped his eyes away from Harry’s to stare down at Harry’s tenting erection, before recoiling his hand as if he was burnt.  Malfoy must have suddenly been aware that he was staring, as he tore his eyes away and shook his head violently. A long, shaky breath left the healer as he rubbed his face in his hands, before running them back through his hair. In an instant Malfoy was walking and grabbing his robes. His voice was strained, but still composed. “I’ll see you tomorrow, Potter.”
This time it was Malfoy who gritted his teeth. “Adults don’t always need to say the childish words
“Disappointed.”
He could have sworn that she winked at him.
The story is really getting juicy now!
Thank you all for being so patient and for loving this story so much. It truly is a pleasure to write, and to know you guys love it make it all the much better <3
Harry pouted and ran his hands up through his hair, away from his face. He rested his elbows on the table and hid his burning face in his hands. “What do I do, Gin?”
Malfoy blinked. “I don’t have time for these games Potter.” He turned and left the room hastily before Harry was able to change his mind.
Hope you are all staying sane during lockdown!!
“I suppose it’s also against the conditions to get a hard on over my healer, but here we are.”  Harry was stood directly in front of Malfoy, so close that their noses were nearly touching. Feeling petty, Harry smacked the clipboard out of Malfoy’s hands. It bounced off the corner of the table before hitting the floor.
Malfoy scowled and examined the red mark with narrowed eyes, leaning forward in his stance. “Is that ketchup?”
Harry allowed one shallow laugh to escape him before his mind raced back to that night with Draco once more, and his heart was once again swallowed by grief. “Her name was Maggie, Eliza.”
“Does not excuse my behaviour of speaking to someone like shit.”
means bad,
“Then why did he leave?”
.” Malfoy rolled his eyes as he wrote something down on the chart that was cradled in his arm. “I’ve contacted Granger to tell her that you’re getting sent home today. She knows the conditions of your release, so your aggravating hero complex won’t do you any good, Potter. You’re not going back to work.”
you look like shit.”
Sensing he was about to be summoned, Kreacher appeared in the room with a light pop. “Masters be wanting me, yes?”
A strangled moan came from Harry’s throat as he curled his fingers to cup Malfoy’s face. His thumbs rested beneath Draco’s eye sockets, stroking his cheekbones softly as he deepened the kiss. “No, you don’t.” A long whine escaped Draco’s lips as Harry caught his tongue and sucked on it harshly, bobbing his head as he did so.
Malfoy did not react to Harry’s attempt at humour, or embarrassing cough, which made the heat grow hotter on the tips of Harry’s ears. Malfoy’s steel eyes did not leave the chart. “I need to give you a quick examination Potter, to check the extent of damage. Are you wearing clothes beneath your Auror robes?”
Ginny began to clench her jaw as Harry clenched his.
Malfoy raised his brow at Harry, who attempted to sit up straighter in the bed. Harry ignored the minor stab of pain that followed and lifted his chin at Malfoy in defiance.
Draco looked up from the paperwork he had been reading over in the Medi-Nurses’ station. He ignored the dull throb of his headache as his strained eyes glared up at the young healer who were, to his knowledge, completing their first year of residency.
Harry nodded at these words, looking over Malfoy’s shoulder. He couldn’t look at him, it was torture. He subtly pressed his palm against his groin, pushing down against his ever-present erection. He suddenly felt really vulnerable, with his torso exposed to Malfoy. Cold air blew against his damp skin which caused Harry to shiver.
“I’m keeping you here overnight Potter. Possibly longer depending on your progress. I’ll have Medi-Nurse Mayford give you what you need for an overnight stay.”

a bottle of water from Harry’s fridge with her hand outstretched to the side. The moment the bottle was in her hand she immediately unscrewed the lid and took large gulps, clearing out her throat. She gave a relieved sigh before screwing the lid back on and placing the bottle, which sagged slightly to the side because of her vice-like grip, onto the table. “Yeah right, and I’m the queen of Egypt,
before guiding the newly mended mug back onto the counter. She had always been good at practical magic. She cleared her throat and turned around to face Harry. “Malfoy is your healer?” Harry knew she meant this as a statement, though it came out more as a question.
like that.”
will be the next patient that gets admitted. Understood?
The voice from the unannounced presence had startled Harry. It caused him to turn around in a panic, drawing his wand from his back pocket. He immediately lowered his wand and sighed towards the floor. “Not now Kreacher, I promise I’ll pick everything up before I leave tonight.”

Malfoy was stood there with his arms folded across his chest, simply staring at Harry. “Bad dream Potter?”
Harry opened and closed his mouth a couple times, but only a strangled noise came out.
“You haven’t seen anything yet.”
This chapter needed emotional depth to try and emphasise how complicated their relationship is. They have such a rich dynamic and history that it is such an honour to explore that on this journey with you guys <3
“You’re doing it again.”
“Peppermint then, please.”
Harry began to close the distance between the two of them and despite Malfoy haughtily raising his chin, he didn’t make an effort to move away.
Kreacher glared up at Harry. His smile was menacing, the top set of yellowed teeth were visible in the corners of his tight mouth. “No space for the parcel, no parcel to give to Master...”

Harry did his best to hide his inner turmoil, and instead smiled knowingly to himself as he lifted his shirt slowly above his head. Malfoy had summoned Harry’s clipboard that Eliza had left in Harry’s bedroom, and began scanning it with his eyes. Malfoy's lips moved as he read the words.
“He’s all good to go! This bag contains painkiller tonics and the usual remedies that should help to reduce uncomfortable symptoms in between his potion doses.” Hermione nodded at Eliza. Her brow was furrowed in hard concentration as she took the small black briefcase from the Medi-Nurse. “There is only enough of each remedy and tonic to last him 24 hours at a time, so overdoses or substance abuse is prevented. This supply will be topped up when needed to by his appointed hospital staff, which includes Healer Malfoy, and myself, Medi-Nurse Mayford. If anyone else tries to gain access into Harry’s home stating they are medical staff, contact the hospital immediately. Do you have any questions, Mrs Granger-Weasley?”
A quiet whimper escaped between Harry’s teeth as his cock twitched for the second time against his inner thigh. Trying to keep himself together, he moved his arms to cross in the crease where his hips joined his thighs to cover himself. He was half hard now and getting harder by the moment. As desperately as he wanted to, Harry couldn’t tear his gaze away from Malfoy’s face. The power radiating from the man was impalpable. Harry wanted to reach out and place his palm against those sharp cheekbones and stroke the cheek of the healer that was tearing him apart.
“Pardon?”
“For you to snap out of this weird broody behaviour and sort this bloody mess out.”
Seeing Draco being vulnerable cracked Harry’s chest open and allowed a searing warmth to spread across its cracks. All Harry could do was nod. The nod began cautiously but quickened as Harry drew a deep breath. “Yeah. Yeah it went dark.”
“So, you’re better now?”
Harry couldn’t see who was inside the room yet, but something in his brain clicked as he observed Kreacher’s behaviour.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Fine.”
Ginny blinked. “Okay mister cryptic.” She huffed playfully, rolling her eyes as turned back to face the counter and prepared two cups of tea. “You show up in my apartment in the middle of the day wearing nothing on your feet and still in your pyjamas – not that I’m judging or anything since you’re recovering and all- clearly troubled about something.”
Ginny’s eyes narrowed suspiciously. Harry gulped.
Harry could not go back to sleep after his conversation with Malfoy. Despite the minimal amount of sleep his body was running on, he felt wired awake and anxious.
Harry felt the plunging feeling of guilt settle in his gut. “They apparated because of me. If I had just dodged that curse they wouldn’t have had the chance to get away. They’d be under veritaserum right now, facing a possible life sentence is Azkaban.”

“Sounds like Granger.” A chuckle escaped Malfoy’s lips before he could stop it, and Harry found himself laughing along.
Harry said nothing. Malfoy’s gaze slowly travelled down his body. Harry squeezed his eyes shut hard, feeling a bubble of panic rising in his throat.
would spend hours in there, so I became increasingly concerned. I thought he would harm her. I-I…One day I noticed after he entered the room, he left the door slightly ajar. I peaked through the gap and I will never forget what I saw. He was holding one of her hands in both of his and his palms were glowing white. I couldn’t hear the spell from the distance, but I knew that it was kind. It’s difficult to explain but different spells have different scents and well… This one smelt like freshly washed cotton. The old witch was smiling in her sleep. She seemed to be at peace. I knew from that moment on I had to give him a chance. He worked extra hours to ensure his patients, regardless of their blood, were happy; a sign of a remarkable healer, and of a man who deserves redemption.”
patients.”
Harry shook his head, his mind coming back to the room. He swallowed the lump in his throat, letting out an awkward laugh. “I was under the impression they were broken, not missing… No wonder breathing is a little tricky aye?” Harry’s awkward laugh turned into a shallow raspy cough, that brought Harry to clutch his sides, hugging his sides together as if to keep his organs in.
Harry’s face broke out into a playful grin before letting out a dramatic gasp. “Ketchup?! No no Malfoy this is blood.”
Harry knew that voice.
. He remembered the venom that would escape his Uncle’s mouth as his eyes bulged out of his enraged face. The vision twisted again, morphing into the front door of The Burrow. He remembered the warmth of Molly’s hugs.
Slowly, Harry began to turn his back towards Malfoy and focused his eyes on the white-washed wall now ahead of him. He gulped hard, having a lot of shame to swallow. “Could you untie the knot at the back of my neck. Please? I can’t lift my arms.”
“If you didn’t take my voice away, I would have chosen different ones.”
Harry snorted and pressed his lips against the warm lip of the cup.
. But do you know what else is valuable like treasure?
Harry felt his hands tremble in his lap, still fighting his erection. He felt scared and confused and angry and exhausted and

Harry’s heart clenched with another wave of grief that made him want to shatter everything around him, himself included.
“Ron told me you were in the hospital, you alright?” The mugs lived in the top cupboard. Ginny had to jump and lock her wrist against the worktop in order to push herself up to reach them. It would have been so much easier to bring them down with magic but Ginny always stubbornly refused to give in. She wouldn’t give Blaise the satisfaction that he was right about the cupboard being too high up.
Malfoy left no room for further conversation as he disappeared in a burst of green flames.
10 minutes had passed, and his breath was now coming out in shallow pants.
“Hey.” Harry winced at his own social awkwardness.
“Side effects of skelegrow include irritability and drowsiness. I’ll have Eliza get you that pepper-up potion and some toast. Keep your fluids up Potter.” Malfoy took out his wand and pointed it at the glass of water on Harry’s bedside table. A soft “
Harry couldn’t get the image of Malfoy’s shock out of his head. More specifically, the way his grey eyes grew wide and fixated on the bulge that his wrist had unknowingly pressed against.
Harry nodded, processing the information.
A mixture of emotions spread throughout Harry’s body with such force and intensity that he had gotten whiplash. “No. No you don’t get to fucking do this.”
Harry felt ridiculous for his heartache. It felt stupid to be mourning over the loss of someone who was very much alive, and to miss someone whose company only confused you.
Harry was fully erect now, and he barely noticed that those hands on his body were venturing lower until it too late to stop what happened next.
Harry’s eyes immediately widened, the back of his neck burning from a sudden embarrassing heat.
Draco was an exposed wire, electric and alive and buzzing with activity. He was dangerous and uncontainable. Harry yearned to touch him again and be completely undone by the wild energy that would collide into him.
Hermione returned the smile. Her attention was shifted towards Harry as he slowly tried to lift himself from the bed. He had changed into a faded blue t-shirt that Hermione had brought with her to the hospital and baggy pyjama bottoms that hung low on his hips. His Auror robes had been shrunken by Hermione prior to her conversation with Eliza and were folded snugly within her handbag. Harry winced as a sharp pain flared in his torso as he tried lifting himself from the bed. “Here, let me help you.” Hermione grabbed Harry’s arm and placed it around her shoulders to take his weight, continuing to help him to his feet.
The time was now 7:59pm, and Harry was stood at the door of Malfoy Manner. He swallowed the hard lump that was forming in his dry throat before ringing the doorbell. Harry could have had 10 years to prepare himself for what would welcome him on the other side of the door, but that still wouldn’t have been enough time.
Eliza’s smile deepened at the corners as the tray lowered itself onto Harry’s lap. She sat in the chair next to his bed and summoned his chart, eyeballing it carefully. “No feverish attacks since yesterday, that’s good! Oof
Whatever piece of sanity that held Draco back snapped. He grabbed Harry by the t-shirt. His hands were balled up into fists against Harry’s collarbones. “You think this is fucking funny, do you?”
“I made tea.”
“You’ve looked better.” Malfoy spent another moment staring at Harry before turning his gaze back down to the clipboard, scribbling something else down. “Eliza will come by and return your clothes and belongings to you so you’re ready for your release this afternoon. You’re not in the condition to leave by yourself, so Granger told me she would side-apparate you home.”
“Because he realised that you wanted him back. And that scared him.”
That was a lie of course.
He couldn’t remember getting ready for work this morning before his mission that resulted in Harry’s arrival at St. Mungo’s in the first place.  “I-I remember putting on underwear but-”
“Wait, so
pointy nose.” Harry broke the eye contact and looked at his bare feet as the shame licked his insides. He felt an embarrassed flush creep up the back his neck and face.
It had taken close to a year, but Grimmauld Palace was a warm and welcoming home, with lightly coloured cream walls, and oak wood panelling. Lavender Brown and Parvarti Patil took complete control of redesigning the layout of Harry’s furniture,
White cream rug, light wood flooring, grey sofas scattered with green and red cushions.
“Harry? What are you-
Malfoy leant in closer to Harry, whose eyes fluttered to the pale man’s rosy pink lips. “I’m studying your temperature.”
Harry felt his body react strongly to the touches, as his skin scorched with desire. A shaky breath left Harry’s lips as he tried desperately to keep his body under control.
“I didn’t ask you what blondie said did I you prat? Do you want him?”
“I never asked for her to defend me Potter. I don’t need an army of little Gryffindors fighting my corner.  I don’t suddenly owe her-“
Thank you for all your love and support so far, it makes me smile <3
Draco grabbed his wand that was resting behind his left ear and muttered frustrations as he stormed his way down the corridor. He casted rapid-fire incantations on the doors that he passed to check the emergency vitals of patients that lay within those rooms, leaving a soft scent trial of cinnamon in his wake.
Harry took a moment to process Eliza’s story. It all made sense.
Eliza would be at Harry’s bedside every morning as he woke up, and her cheerful, vibrant face would be the first thing he saw. She would wring the excess water out of the flannel and into the water bowl beneath it before soothing Harry’s fever that would creep up during the night. They would talk for an hour or so as Eliza would break Harry’s fever, whilst making sure he kept his fluid intake up. She would wait until after Harry had finished the breakfast Kreacher would prepare for him, alongside a skelegrow potion, and then head back to St. Mungos. In the couple of hours that followed, Harry would leave his master bedroom on the second floor and make his way slowly up the flight of stairs to the top floor of the house. There, he would sit in his office and review paperwork and case files; tying up any loose ends he would not have the time to do if he was not out of action.
“What do you mean? I was just upstairs- “
A smirk broke across Harry’s face before he could stop it. The man before him was stood on a knifes edge, and all Harry had to do was push. “What you gonna do Malfoy? Run away again? That’s what you do best isn’t it?”
“No. He hasn’t.”
*********
Thank you for all the kudos and comments so far, and thank you for so many hits on this story - it warms my heart to see it, it really does <3

Malfoy blinked. “Yes, I can see that.”
Harry casted a
Unable to stop himself, Harry reached forward and pulled Draco into a tight hug. He linked his arms around Malfoy’s shoulders and rested his forehead against the crook of Draco’s neck. The hot tears spilled against Draco’s bare skin, and as the tears came out harder Harry tugged Draco in closer. The scent of firewood and pine flooded Harry’s nose from Malfoy’s aftershave. “You’re running away again.”
The hot and cold approach from Malfoy confused Harry to no end. Though the more Malfoy gave him the cold shoulder, the more Harry ached to feel his lips against his skin.
Harry clenched his jaw and clutched his bedsheets hard within his fists. “You just said I’m fine to go home today.”
Harry let out a soft laugh. “It was either this or have Ginny shove a broom up my arse.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You’re hot.” As soon as the words left Malfoy’s lips, he stepped away from Harry. Malfoy reached for Harry’s chart with one hand, as he ran his hand through his hair with the other. “You’re not feverish. Your rise in temperature during my examination was caused by extraneous factors. This is good for your prognosis Potter. You’ll be out of here quick. Today I’d say.”
“Focus on me Potter. Open your eyes.” Harry supressed a moan as he locked his eyes onto Malfoy’s, whose gaze was so focused and devastatingly alluring. “Okay, this is good.”
Harry said nothing, waiting for the man to continue. He wetted his lips.
stropped into the Nurses Station to summon me here with a face like a slapped arse.” She hopped off the bed, stretching her back. “Bless him, I’m so surprised he has such nice teeth considering how hard he clenches his jaw.” She gasped to herself, as if an idea had struck her mind like lightening. “Maybe he has veneers-“
patient.  Despite the emotional car crash that Draco was suffering from, his face remained calm and poised, like the gentle ebbing of water that hides the riptide underneath.
“8 o’clock. Got it.”
Harry’s swallowed his mouthful and winced as the bitter taste of liquorice travelled down his throat, before turning back to place the bottle back in the bag. “If you need to unwind for a bit, I can have Kreacher bring us in some tea.” Harry heard the movement behind him stop for a moment.
Malfoy shoved Harry hard. Harry drank in his dishevelled appearance as he stumbled back a few steps. His pupils were completely blown out from lust, with only a faint band of grey circling them. His cheeks were pink, and his lips were red and swollen. He looked vampiric and dangerous. They stayed like that for a moment, staring at each other whilst taking in deep breaths. The electricity between them crackled around the room. Harry’s cock was hard and leaking in his pants. He broke the eye contact to see that Malfoy’s cock was straining against his trousers too.
The sound of metal cutlery scrapping across porcelain dinner plates filled the awkward silence in the room. Harry cut into his chicken breast and popped a piece into his mouth as he studied the blonde man who was sitting on the opposite end of the table to himself. Malfoy was the embodiment of awkwardness. His shoulders were hunched forward, and his gaze was unmoving from the plate before him. Harry watched as the man nudged his food around his plate with his fork.
“Like what’s your big secret Hazza, you’re acting all secretive and weird, it’s like you’ve got a big gay crush on the man and you did something stupid.” Ginny laughed to herself as she picked up the mugs and turned around.
Malfoy pulled away, and Harry saw a small wet patch on his jumper above his collarbone, undoubtedly left by Harry. Malfoy’s face was hard and empty. He stood up and went to fetch his robes. “You’ve been through a traumatic experience. You got hit with a curse and you are feeling emotional and out of sorts. I can contact someone in the hospital for mind healer sessions if you need them.”
Malfoy folded his arms over his chest and leant back against the closed door. He looked unnervingly calm. Harry gulped. “What are you doing here Potter? I’m working.”
Ginny’s shoulders began to shake, which made the table rattle. Harry turned his head to the side to see that she had covered her mouth with her hand. He watched her half-hearted attempt to stop the laugher from roaring out of her.
“Medi-Nurse Mayford informed me about your fever. It’s amazing how it broke in such little time, hm?”
As more days passed, Eliza’s attempts at conversation began to wither away. On the fifth day, her attempts had stopped altogether. At the end of her visit, she packed away the plethora of vials and tonics back into her hospital bag, but she didn’t head towards the exit with a kind farewell as she normally did. Instead, she simply sat on the edge of Harry’s bed next to him. Scared as if Harry would disintegrate, she carefully placed a comforting hand on the blanket that was rested on Harry’s knee.  She rubbed her thumb against the blanket in a nurturing manner in a way that reminded Harry of Molly. “I know it hurts, but it won’t feel like this forever.”
Harry let out an exhausted sigh and nodded his consent. “Let’s just get this over with.”
A low, slow cackle left the house elf as he clicked his fingers. A small, seemingly light, parcel bobbed over Kreachers’ left shoulder until it settled onto the grey fluffy blanket draped across the foot of Harry’s bed.  “Parcel for you Master, yes. There is a note... A note...”
Harry swallowed and nodded, unwrapped his arms from around himself, and knitted his fingers into the bed sheets on either side of him. Immediate regret followed this decision, as Harry opened his eyes in wide alarm at the sensation of heat pressing against his ribcage. Looking down at his body, he saw pale, elegant hands pressed against both sides of his ribcage. The palms were glowing red against his tanned skin. Malfoy was muttering an incantation quietly to himself in a deep, clear tone. Harry’s eyes studied the hands, taking in deep, shaky, gulps of air as a fire spread across his body, threatening to burn him alive. An unfocused gaze travelled up the pale healer’s hands, up his arms, to the graceful set of his shoulders. Like a flower going into bloom, Harry’s eyes met Malfoy’s, and his world came into sudden, sharp focus. With his internal blaze still roaring, Harry felt his lower back begin to dampen. His internal monologue only consisted of the sound a kettle makes when it has come to a boil on the stove, screaming a high-pitched noise. Eyes sculpted from ice stared into his own with such intensity, Harry almost whimpered.
“I wouldn’t have thought your moral compass allowed for slaves, Potter.” Harry could hear the way smiled into his sentence.
Malfoy raised his voice higher. “And I said take off your gown. I won’t ask you again.” Malfoy’s gaze had raised to meet Harry’s in a fiery intensity Harry didn’t think was possible. A monochromatic fire blazed within his eyes. Harry felt immediately suffocated by the heat. His breath caught in his throat and strangled him. A heat within his body spread like wildfire, causing a deep flush across his tanned face and neck.
Harry began to whine. “It’s not fucking funny Gin I feel like I’m gonna vomit and cry.”
Harry threw floo powder into the fireplace and stepped inside. He watched Ginny’s living room spin until it disappeared, and his own living room appeared in its place.
All he could think about was the way Malfoy had left. It was more than a healer ending his patient’s treatment.
“I’m not traumatised Draco. You’ve got a lighthouse and I can see the light and I think I’m in lov-“
“Are you in pain?”
Harry closed his eyes and sighed. Truth be told, he felt exhausted. A headache was beginning to form behind his eyes. “I should be heading off now.”
***************************************************
Harry laughed, grinning brightly at the witch. “Very clever. ‘
If someone could bottle the uncontrollable joy that appeared across Harry’s face, they would be a millionaire.
“Malfoy put his hands that low because he wanted to. To be honest it sounds like he’s been enjoying those examinations almost as much as you have. I mean come on, Hazza. There are plenty of charms that would carry out those examinations without physical touch. Why would he use one that required touching? Why would he use that exact spell, in your house alone with you?”
The rating of this story will go up when I start writing...  More age appropriate material if you catch my drift...
Harry entered the room to see that Malfoy’s chair was pushed away from the table and empty.
Harry took another bite of toast, feeling a second wave of nausea crash into his chest.
The radio filled the silence that grew between the pair.
Ginny dropped both mugs this time.
Harry and Ginny stared at each other for several moments, both frozen into place. It was a battle of wills to see who would crack first. Ginny stood in front of the fire with her hands placed on her hips and her eyebrows raised in challenge. Her brown puppy dog eyes were strong and determined, too much like her mother. Harry lifted his chin defiantly as he glared back at her. His brow was furrowed as he drew his knees even tighter to his chest. Their scowls at each other became more intense.

“Eliza.” She said calmly. Her voice sounded far away as the window to Harry’s mind rolled down its blinds. “Goodnight Mr. Potter.”
Every thought and emotion Draco had swallowed in the previous moment was suddenly regurgitated as Draco stared at his
on the mugs before they hit the ground. The mugs flew back up into Harry’s hands and he offered Ginny the red mug with fluttering snitches on it.  After a moment, Ginny slowly reached out to take the mug from Harry. She clutched it in both hands and cradled it in front of her chest. Her face was the image of shock, with her freckles even more vibrant with her skin paled.
Ron and Hermione came to the hospital as soon as the news spread that he was here.
Feeling slightly embarrassed, Harry complied.
and apparated them both away as the autumn breeze grew stronger.
The softly hazed comfort that firewhiskey provided would eventually lull him into a dreamless sleep, where he would dream of nothing but of crimson hot palms running down his chest, and the snuffed-out embers inside him would roar back to life and engulf him in flames.
Harry lifted his gaze to stare at the disgruntled house elf. “Parcel? What parcel Kreacher?”
, which I find funny. I was in Ravenclaw at Hogwarts. Intellectual teasing is part of our nature.”
“Take off your gown Potter.”
“Gin I didn’t-“
“Oh?”
He was gone.
Ooooo well isn't this development of plot exciting ;)
Harry’s Auror reflexes kicked in, making him cast a quick
Eliza learnt forward to rest a hand on Harry’s shoulder, giving it a soft squeeze. “It’s for your own good okay? If you resist treatment or go to work before you’re fully recovered it will do much more damage than good. Believe me when I say it would take a lot more time and rigorous treatment to fix you the second time round.
Eliza gave his shoulder one last squeeze before removing her hand. She stood up and stretched, bending her neck from left to right. She casted a quick tempus incantation, which made
A smirk curled on the corner of Malfoy’s lips as Harry’s eyes widened in embarrassment. “You have such a way with words, Potter.”
“The feeling between pain relief tonics feels more tight than sharp now.”
might be a git, but he seems to care a fair bit for you.” Eliza rubbed Harry’s shoulder with her thumb.
“It makes sense coming back here. This is his ward, right?”
“Penny for your thoughts Mr. Potter.” Medi-Nurse Mayford was reviewing Harry’s chart, sitting on the edge of his bed. Her legs dangled off the side of his bed, swinging playfully. Harry smiled softly at her, amused by her antics. She brought such a warmth with her, she reminded him of Luna in that regard.
empty room to treat a patient that conveniently ‘
Malfoy said nothing for many moments. His jaw was set hard. Harry saw his knuckles whiten from his grip on his chart, though no emotion was clear on his aristocratic face. “Potter needs another dose of skelegrow and a physical examination to see the progress of his treatment so far. I am afraid visiting hours are over for tonight. You are more than welcome to come in the morning to check on him. I’ll let you say your goodbyes.” Malfoy gave a polite nod towards Harry’s friends, before making his way to the other side of the room to deal with another patient.
Stumbling out of the second fireplace, Harry felt a surge of pain course through his left side. He pressed a hand against his offending ribs and took slow, deep breaths as he collected his bearings.
A fresh wave of bitterness rolled through Harry, so much that he felt the corner of his lip curl into a snarl. He sipped his coffee to swallow that feeling, resulting in a burnt tongue. “Gee, that’s fucking fantastic. What’s your point here Gin? I made a bad fucking decision trying to jump him after I left your place?”
Harry sighed as he chewed half-heartedly on a slice of toast. “I’m not irritable, Malfoy is just annoying.”
The hunger that roared inside Harry was insatiable.
Harry furrowed his brow again, swallowing his heart back down into his stomach. “I wouldn’t mind someone braiding my hair.”
Unable to stop himself, Harry pressed his mouth hard against Draco’s. Draco’s lips were wet and plump as Harry moved his mouth hard enough against his lips to bruise them. Draco bit down hard on Harry’s bottom lip, trapping it between his teeth. “I fucking hate you.”  He released Harry’s lip and trailed his tongue across the metallic tasting indents from his teeth.
“Malfoy? Y-you’re talking about Malfoy, right?”
“Good. You’re doing good, Potter. I examined the back of your ribcage to see if I missed any missing bones in my previous examination. You’ll be pleased to know I didn’t. There are signs to suggest bone reconstruction already.”
Regardless of how long Malfoy decided to stay for, Harry’s routine after he left was always consistent. The moment Malfoy disappeared through the floo, Harry would stare longingly at the place where the man no longer stood. Harry’s cock would ache torturously as he would drag his damaged body to the master bathroom on the second floor. There, he would have a hot shower, and let the water trickle down the back of his neck as he would hang his head forward beneath the water.  The palm of his hand would be stretched out on the wall in front of him. In his other hand, would be his throbbing erection, that he would begin to fist slowly, until flashing images of short blonde hair and the feeling of strong, aristocratic hands on his body came into his mind, making him tug himself harder. Harry would squeeze his eyes shut and moan deeply at the thought of those grey eyes fluttering and staring up at him with blown out pupils, as Malfoy would close his lips over Harry’s cock, taking it deeply. It was this image of Malfoy on his knees with hollowed, blushing cheeks, that made Harry’s balls tighten and cause him to cum hard against the shower tiles.
********
“You broke my heart Draco.”
“This is a good thing. Your body is almost healed, and Eliza will continue to check on you daily, but my services are no longer required here. Pragmatically speaking, it makes little sense to check the rate of bone growth when all your bones have grown back. What you essentially have now are rib fractures, which a medi-nurse is more than capable to deal with.”
Draco swiftly meandered his way through the stream of Medi-Nurses with carts and the steady bustle of hospital staff that were coming in the opposite direction. He ground his teeth harder and rose his chin as he tried to avoid bumping into the opposite flow of people. Cinnamon scented charms were continuously fired as Draco sent an endless stream of mental curses into the universe, hoping they would manifest into petty misfortune that would ruin someone else’s day.
Harry’s eyes snapped open and his face burned crimson. Malfoy stayed perched on the edge of the sofa with hugely widened eyes. His mouth was hung open in what Harry could only surmise as shock, and his wrist was still pressed against Harry’s crotch.
Harry closed his eyes as he felt cold metal touch the skin where his heart lay underneath. He felt his heart pound against the metal as a heat spread across the back of his neck. Harry wrapped his arms around himself tighter, a feeling of vulnerability sitting in his stomach.
Draco picked up the chart on the end of an elderly woman’s bed, not looking up from it to meet Harry’s eyes. “I repeat, you make death seem like a choice.”
“Don’t go. Please.”
Harry’s shook out the image of blood pouring down a shower drain and looked up to see Malfoy staring directly at him. Malfoy had pushed his plate forward to signal he was done with the meal, though the chicken and vegetables on the plate had barely been touched. His hands were clasped in front of him, and his posture has returned rigidly straight. “Doing what?”
Draco closed his eyes and sighed hard. He wiped his palms together to sprinkle the quill fragments onto the desk before vanishing them away. “If there isn’t a coffee on this desk by the time I get back Mr. Jefferson
Ginny shook her head, forgetting the rest of the examples Blaise had used.  “He… Oh fuck it you get the point.”
Ginny snorted and rolled her eyes. “Yes Hazza, Draco has been writing poems about you, and telling Blaise how he wants to braid your curly mop.”
