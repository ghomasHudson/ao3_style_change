fading Dark Mark on his left arm. It was still the same horrid ink, contrastingly dark on Draco’s pale skin, but it wasn’t moving. Still, Harry’s breath hitched at the sight.
Harry wanted to punch Malfoy as soon as he said those words. He wanted to get angry, to whip his wand out and sent a nasty hex at the blond's ugly, sneering face. But Harry forced a smile on his face, propelled by the
And it was beyond strange; the amount of pleasure Harry took in seeing Draco calm under his touch, the happiness that filled him when Draco abruptly stopped mocking the third year Hufflepuffs that passed by them when Harry admonished him. Draco was never this agreeable, and Harry never had this influence over Draco before.
But even the factitious illusion of denial would crumble down at the hands of Gryffindor curiosity. When Harry had pushed his arm through the disarray and higgledy-piggledy inside his trunk, the first object that he laid his palm on was the crumpled piece of parchment. It was the Marauders’ magical map of Hogwarts. Harry felt a tug of grief and sorrow at the object, remembering the fact that Prongs, Padfoot and Moony (he doesn’t really wanna think about the bloody rat) were all dead. He hadn’t touch this memorabilia since after the war. But the morose had been surmounted with curiosity and the familiar anticipation of seeing Draco on the map. Even if they were both inside the same tower, watching (see: spying) Draco’s dot on the map offer a sense of assurance and normality.
The staring contest between Malfoy and him was cut off when a face with a long red hair came into his view. He almost jump away at the nearness of Ginny Weasley's face.
This was what scared Harry. The idea of being vulnerable and exposed. Suppressing his emotions was a default reaction, and he quashed down all the potentially compromising sentimentalities for a reason.
"Forgive me for disturbing your peace," he said ruefully. "Merlin knows how much of a nuisance I was the whole day."
"Is your son weak now, father! Am I weak, aunt!" Draco practically shrieked, his eyes alit with feverish glint. He laughed maniacally, his wand moving to the nearby tree, and with a terrifying shout that broke the peaceful air, a green light burst out of its tip. The bark immediately debilitated, turning the trunk into a charred wood as if it was burnt, spreading to its branches, its healthy green leaves wilting and feebly hanging off their sprigs.
Harry sighed, a tension in his body and mind that he hadn't felt since the days of Voldemort. He was once again tangled up in a prophecy that he wanted no part of. And this time, there was a guarantee he would die if he didn't even try to fulfill it.
As soon as he stepped out into the hall and shut the door of the room behind him, pain flared up near his elbow. He growled, pulling back his sleeve to see the prophecy's mark changing. The serpent had now turned its back to the lion.
A frown touched Potter's features. "Not exactly. I thought I could make a Calming Draught before our flight, but it takes a few hours longer than we have to brew. I did make a Sleeping Draught though."
Draco scrubbed a hand over his face and laid down his fork. Even though he knew he should eat because of the draining effect of panic attacks, he didn't feel hungry. Instead, it seemed he had swallowed an acid pop with how his stomach was clenching. So what if Potter had figured out he was gay? That didn't mean that Potter knew Draco was having feelings for him specifically. And it certainly didn't mean Potter felt anything in return. Potter had gone out with Cho Chang and Ginny Weasley while in school. Potter was definitely straight. What had happened with the zipper, on the plane, making sure he got food and water...that was all Potter extending a hand in truce for them to get through this prophecy quest where they weren't at each others' throats all the time or make the mark react badly. That was all.
"Yeah," Harry said vaguely, his voice lacking the conviction of a decision. Was he ok? He thought so, but it had been a while since he had had nightmares like that, that vivid.
Sensing that the skeleton priest meant them no harm, or at least was incapable of doing anything much more than throw a few bones at them, Harry stowed his wand away and began to search for the fallen bones. The tomb was so packed with treasure that it was no wonder why the priest was trapped. There was a path around the room only wide enough for both of Harry's feet if he pressed them together.
Potter sighed heavily, replaced the cork on the vial, and turned back to the potion. "So. That's not good."
Potter nodded and tapped the tip of his finger against the table to emphasize his next point. "The Chamber of Secrets was kind of like that. You had to know where to look for the entrance and then know that Parseltongue opened the door." His look of apparent excitement at their breakthrough was gone in an instant. "I can't speak Parseltongue anymore though. I lost that ability when the horcrux inside me was destroyed."
Draco hastily withdrew his hand and fixed his sleeve back in place to hide the old scars. They weren't worth talking about. That was all behind him, though he fought the urge sometimes.
This was different than his panic attack on the plane. That had been a reaction to finding himself in a tight space, but this anxiety was more thought-driven. Thoughts ran circles in his head of how he wanted to give in, risk heartbreak with Potter. And then every time he saw himself smile in some fantasy future with the man, the floor seemed to disappear from under him as his mind brashly interjected with thoughts of death or a simple change of mind turning his happiness to abrupt devastation.
"What else is hidden in Slytherin's tomb besides his body?" Potter asked sharply. "If someone wanted to rob it..." He swallowed. "Did Voldemort ever try to rob it? He was obsessed with the founders and their heirlooms. He made a horcrux from Slytherin's locket."
"I know, but I thought given that I was gone an hour..." Potter pulled out the chair on the other side of the table and sat. He pulled the plate with the cinnamon bun on it toward him and picked up Draco's abandoned fork. He sliced off a bite and held it up in front of Draco as if expecting him to eat it from Potter like a child.
It turned out that Draco was very grateful for Susan's presence on their shopping trip and return to the Sphinx. Having her around meant Potter had someone else to talk to besides him. This was lucky because Draco wasn't sure he could hold a normal conversation with the other man just yet. He was still processing the fact that they had slept in the same bed the previous night. And that Draco had liked it. Ok, maybe that was being too generous. He definitely couldn't
Susan shook her head. "All the pairs come to look for Slytherin first. We don't know why other than it might be because Slytherin was the first of the two to die. I personally think it's because Gryffindor's tomb might involve tests of bravery and only a very closely bonded prodigy pair can pass the tests. But," and she gave a big sigh, "that's speculation and definitely not to say Slytherin's tasks would be easy. Slytherin told Hufflepuff his tomb was enchanted to discourage, injure, and even kill intruders. Though...he seemed to suspect there would be a prophecy because he told Hufflepuff only his prodigy could open the mouth of the tomb. Maybe he knew his business with Gryffindor didn't end with his death, but unless he was secretly skilled in Divination, I'm not sure how he would have known that exactly."
"Yes," the skeleton said as it crawled across the floor to gather its bones. It used its elbows to prod the fallen ulnas and radiuses until they snapped back into place as if by magnets. "I am the Priest Akil. Sworn protector of Salazar Slytherin's body." The skeleton pushed itself up onto its knees and huffed. "Do you boys mind helping?" He nodded to the scattered wrist and finger bones that had slid and bounced several feet out of his reach. Harry just now noticed that the priest had been sitting in a chair in the back corner, effectively trapped by the cauldron and a table.
Draco shivered and drew his hand down his cock from base to tip and back again. Was that true, he wondered. Or was Potter just making up things for the sake of this task?
"I know. I don't want to, believe me," he said. "And that's partially why attachment and heartbreak scares me. I'm scared of feeling so low again. It was a scary time in my life that I barely made it through. I was always scared I would cut too deep or something and that would be it. Despite how low I felt, I never wanted to actually die." He swallowed and rubbed at his eyes with his free hand. He sniffed and pulled his hand from Harry's. "Anyway...I think I'm going to make some hot chocolate. Would you like any?"
But, he supposed it didn't matter to Slytherin. An archway had opened at the other end of the chamber, beckoning them on to the third task.
"Lumos," Draco murmured, and the tip of his wand lit up. The narrow beam of light stretched across the floor in front of them where it revealed the bottom few steps of an obsidian staircase leading up into more darkness.
"That sounds like a lot of 'maybe's' and 'if's' to me, but it's somewhere to start, I suppose," Potter said and laid the map aside. "We can fly there in the morning. Or, hey, we could ask Susan to Apparate us so we avoid the plane altogether."
As soon as they had checked into a new room and walked upstairs to it, Draco tossed his bag onto one of the beds and slipped into the bathroom without a word.
Harry raised an eyebrow. "You have to make it to Paris, and I'm the best you've got. Take it or leave it." He removed his hand from Malfoy's, though his arm was still in the blond's grip, and sat back in his seat to survey the Muggles in the cabin again.
"Wait, in the room where it, what?" Draco asked, jumping forward as if to seize him. His hand closed on air where the man's sleeve had been.
"I didn't want to give you time to come up with some excuse to weasel your way out of it," Malfoy said. He stood across from Harry, the desk between them. Though there was a chair meant for students to sit while Harry discussed their grades or work ethic with them, Malfoy did not sit. Neither did Harry.
"I think we should talk about that," Harry said. Last night, they hadn't discussed Slytherin's message and had just eaten dinner in silence and went to bed.
"And again, we need to know about this thing of us not being the first ones to attempt this prophecy," Potter said, and Draco was happy to see the raven-haired man looking as irritated as he felt.
Harry thought back to when he, Ron, and Hermione had broken into Gringotts to find another horcrux hidden in the Lestrange vault. All of the treasure had duplicated when they touched it since they were not the rightful owners. Now, Harry could picture Malfoy standing in front of the vault, opening it, and being buried in a deluge of treasure. It was enough to make the corner of his mouth twitch in amusement.
Draco carefully tipped a few drops of the blood mixture onto Russia and recorked the bottle. Both he and Potter leaned forward to examine the drops of blood as they congealed themselves into a larger drop. Just as Draco's blood had done the night previous in Potter's office, the drop of blood now began to move across the map. It was headed southwest, definitely ruling out Europe as it bypassed the continent entirely. When it finally stopped and soaked into the parchment, it was not a dot. Rather, it colored in a whole country and labeled itself with two words - Salazar Slytherin.
"She just wants to make sure we have everything. And she said she'll Apparate us to just outside the Sphinx, so that'll save us a bit of time and walking."
"No, he wouldn't have!" said a portrait of a Headmistress whom Harry didn't recognize. She wore a pin of the Ravenclaw eagle on her hat. "And the girls - that is to say Rowena and Helga - would have known everything. The four were close friends, and nothing would have escaped Rowena."
They ascended another dark staircase identical to the first and met another archway with more braziers and another silver serpent. The cobra hissed something in Parseltongue. He had never mourned the loss of that power when the piece of Voldemort's soul he had carried was destroyed. But, now, he found it would have been much easier to be able to understand what the snakes were saying. But, perhaps, this was another test of trust between him and Malfoy. He had to trust that Malfoy would tell him the exact instructions and not alter or omit any of the message.
"The third challenge," Draco said, and he hated that he blushed just bringing up the topic. He cleared his throat. "Look, why don't we talk about this when I'm not in the shower?"
The man stood and withdrew a square of parchment from his pocket. He unfolded it, shifted the pensieve back a few inches, and laid out the parchment on the desk.
"I'll distract it," Potter said. He raised the sword as the statue turned away from him and brought it down on its back.
Banshees were malevolent spirits regarded as omens of death in the wizarding world. Their main characteristic was also a high-pitched scream that never ended until the hearer met an untimely end.
But Draco was pulled from these thoughts as the smoke began to congeal. It took on a solid form, condensing and curving itself to form the features of an old man that was undoubtedly Salazar Slytherin.
"This is insane," Malfoy hissed, glancing around the plane like something was going to jump out and bite him.
Harry stared at him. "Do you even realize how insane that sounds? We have to get their souls, ghosts, whatever to kiss and make up so they can move on to the afterlife?"
Draco suddenly found the emerald dagger sliding toward him across the floor from where Potter had kicked it. He grabbed it with his uninjured hand and staggered to his feet.
Luckily, they were only half way back to the Sphinx when a canary yellow motorbike came roaring out to meet them.
"Excuse me," Susan mumbled and left their table to join the group by the bikes. They all crowded around her, obviously eager for news about them.
The plane filled quickly, and they took to the air. At the instant the plane lifted from the ground, Harry found his arm knocked roughly off the armrest his seat shared with Malfoy. He looked over to see blond's knuckles white under the strain of gripping the armrest so hard. His eyes were closed, and his breathing rate had increased.
"Ok, I think we made a pretty good dent in the supplies we need," Malfoy was saying as he tucked a few cans of green beans and peaches out of sight in his bag. "Time for dinner?"
Malfoy nodded stiffly. "Then I still expect you to meet me in The Three Broomsticks tomorrow. Noon. Don't be late." He retrieved his mother's memory from the pensieve's basin, snatched up the world map, and was gone.
"Neither was I, but I-" Harry froze. Even as he watched the statue stalk closer to them, flail raised, something so simple occurred to him that he felt like smacking his forehead. Disillusionment Charms made the user into a sort of chameleon to blend into the surrounding environment. But, they didn't need that. Not at all.
Having been raised by Muggles, Potter knew what all the numbers and letters meant on the clothing. Draco had no clue at first because all of his clothes were tailored for him. There was no point to know his size when a seamstress hemmed all the clothes for him custom. It was embarrassing having Potter explain the sizing to him. At one point, he was pretty sure a teenage girl walking past them in the jeans section had giggled, thinking they were a couple when she saw Potter holding up jeans for Draco and Draco, his face as hot as the sun, had snatched the trousers away and hurried off.
"Alright, whatever." Potter turned onto his back. "You don't have to be scared of this. I'm not going to attack you or anything while you sleep."
Draco swallowed thickly and nodded. He forced himself to walk back to the statue. How long would he have after grabbing the dagger before the statue moved? He was wagering that it wouldn't be long at all.
"He was Muggleborn," Potter said softly, and some of the anger left Draco as he refocused on Potter and saw the gratitude written clearly on his face. "You donated to Muggles. And...the Weasleys...and your aunt Andromeda even though you hate both families."
it. But, it had been nice not waking up alone. And that was also odd, because he had slept alone ever since he was a child, so he was used to it and had no reason to not like waking up alone.
Once the serpent went still again, Malfoy turned to Harry. "'Silence the herald of Death. What is seen will perish by the jackal.'"
He closed his eyes, steeling himself against these emotions. He couldn't, wouldn't have them distract him from the task at hand. Besides, it was pointless to linger on such feelings. Even if he was open to the possibility of letting someone into his life in that way, it wouldn't be Potter. Potter hated him.
Potter gave a hesitant nod. "Susan said to get lost and have the tomb find us. And you've said before this prophecy is categorized as a quest or journey or whatever according to the text. I think walking and waiting is our only choice."
The blond sat down a few feet from the fire, amazed at how quickly the desert was becoming cold when he had thought the sun would singe his eyebrows just an hour previous. He was only vaguely aware of Potter taking out pans and some of their food to cook. Draco had made it clear during their shopping that if Potter wanted the food to be anywhere near edible, he had to cook it. Growing up with house elves doing all the cooking for him since birth had made it so he didn't even know how to boil a potato correctly. Potter had found this statement hilarious, much to Draco's great annoyance.
Yes, as much as Harry wanted to witness and/or listen to Malfoy's self pleasure, he knew it wouldn't speed things along. Malfoy would undoubtedly be uncomfortable with the thought of Harry watching or even listening. Besides, just as Harry hadn't wanted to see Malfoy naked in the shower without his permission, he definitely didn't want this without Malfoy's consent either. It would be much better and more worth the wait if he let things pan out and see if the blond ever reached a place where he wanted to act on his feelings for Harry.
"Ok, so...yeah," Malfoy said. He motioned to Harry to step away while his hands went to the waistband of his pants.
"Because I was good friends with Colin Creevey," she said simply. "I went to his funeral, and his brother explained that you had shown up one night, given their parents money, and performed a memory charm on them so they would think the money came from the Ministry of Magic as condolences and a thank you for their son serving in the war. And you didn't see Dennis watching from the stairs. You had to hand deliver the money because you didn't know how to use the Muggle post, and I suppose you forgot about Dennis since he was so much younger than you. You could have written him a letter by owl. I figured out the hand you had in the rest for myself."
Infuriatingly, Potter held his hands up innocently. "Whatever. I'll be outside while you finish up."
Draco knew he was only delaying the inevitable. If the only way to find the pyramid and get them out of the desert alive was to confess his feelings for Potter, he would have to do it. That didn't mean he had to be happy about it. He still didn't want to form any attachments. And once again, he reminded himself that Potter. Was. Straight. But, so...what secret did Potter have to divulge to satisfy Slytherin? Because Slytherin had definitely said "secrets." Plural. And Draco couldn't think of another for himself that would mean anything to Slytherin or carry a similar weight.
Madam Rosmerta brought him a butterbeer refill a few minutes later as he shuffled through his papers and checked his watch. He thanked her. Potter was very nearly late.
"It's his birthplace. I've never heard of him being buried there." Malfoy shrugged. "I tried to find information on where they're both buried, but sources say they're lost. No one knows where their tombs are."
Draco felt entirely shoved aside, but what she was saying wasn't untrue. Potter had defeated the greatest dark wizard in the last century, maybe the last millennium. But what had Draco done? Helped Voldemort and his supporters. It had been against his will, but he had helped Voldemort's side.
Narcissa's memory swirled in the pensieve for a moment. Then, a slender ghostly figure made of white smoky memory rose out of the basin to stand on the watery surface. Harry did not recognize the woman, but the tone in which she spoke and the wideness of her eyes told him she was in a trance as he had seen Trelawney do once. The seer spoke in a rasp:
Harry took out a book from his bag and began to read. He didn't know how long Malfoy would need to prepare himself mentally for this task, and reading seemed like something easy to do that communicated that Harry wasn't impatient with the situation.
Malfoy was busy wrapping cloth around his hand. "Yours can do the same to find me. And if we combine our blood, I think it will show us where to go to find these tombs."
"I'll make him promise to behave," Harry said, but he knew from her pursed lips that she was doubtful either that such a promise could be procured or kept. "So...may I go?"
McGonagall narrowed her eyes, and he felt the gaze alone might cut him. "Why?" It was slow and deliberate. Suspicious.
A sudden banging made them both turn to look behind them. An archway had opened to reveal a final staircase leading upward. And from this doorway was coming the sounds of loud banging and shuffling. It sounded very much like something was trying to get out.
Draco locked the door behind the man and then slumped down to sit on the bench in the changing room. He could still feel Potter's hands near his waist and rising up to just under his chin. And then he could see that devilish smile that was a bit mocking of Draco's lack of Muggle knowledge and also a bit genuine.
Damn, how had Potter heard him? Oh. Right, the tattoo on his arm would probably be lit up and burning now that Draco seemed to be in peril.
"It does look like you two have made significant progress," Susan said as she peered at the mark on Potter's forearm.
She held up a hand. "Save it, Draco. We all know you wouldn't publicly donate the money under your name. You did it anonymously, helping to pay for funerals for Professor Snape, Nymphadora Tonks, Ted Tonks, Remus Lupin. You even sent flowers to the Weasleys for Fred's funeral after you had discovered George had already paid for everything else himself."
"Cutting it rather close, Potter," Draco said, and he pulled the scattered papers back to his side of the table as Potter slid into the booth seat opposite him. He had gotten a bit sloppy in his search through the documents.
Harry huffed. "I didn't mean you're doing it on purpose. But, you're going to hyperventilate if you don't stop." Not to mention, Harry's arm would probably fall off and become a singed stump.
Malfoy gave a hollow laugh and didn't look up. "I'm not going to make either of us die over this. I'm just...trying to wrap my head around this."
But what did it matter? If he had feelings for Malfoy, he would just ignore them. He was sure that if Malfoy was experiencing anything akin to his own thoughts and feelings, that they would actually agree on something for once: they could not act on such emotions. They had a job to do. Plus, there was too much bad blood between them from years of tormenting each other. They couldn't simply erase that.
Draco's stomach clenched like a sponge being wrung. Sure, he wanted the cuffs removed too, but Potter didn't have to look
Draco took a step back from the statue and looked around the room. Lying in the shadows cast by the braziers, he could see what appeared to be a few skulls and rib cages. Smaller bones were scattered around his feet. No, he didn't like this at all.
Potter nodded and dropped his own bag beside Draco's. "I'll stay out of the way." Something in his expression softened like it had back in the tent when he was confessing his feelings for Draco. "Be careful."
"I'm attracted to you," Potter said softly, and this time it wasn't just his breath that Draco felt against his skin. As he had spoken, his lips had brushed his ear.
He pushed back the sleeve of his cardigan and saw that the black tattoo had turned bright cherry red. Or, half of it had. Neither the lion nor the serpent had changed position or pose, but the lion was still tar black while the serpent glowed like embers.
Although Draco was awed by actually getting to speak face-to-face with a man he had admired most of his life, he was still ticked off. And it was different now when he was facing Slytherin. The man was less of a legend and more real, like a veil had been lifted in Draco's mind to reveal him for what he was - a simple wizard.
"Yes. And, we know that's true, the 'mounting agony', from you refusing to meet me. The mark kept hurting worse and worse." Malfoy sat forward, gripping the arms of the chair. "Potter, I hate this as much as you. But, we will actually die if we don't do this."
Potter looked at Draco and raised an eyebrow in question even as he rubbed absently at his wrist where the cuff had been. "I think we're ready?"
"Right," Draco said. "So, you need to pack? Can you meet me in one hour? We can take the Knight Bus to London. I think we should pick up some supplies and money before heading to Egypt."
She glared at him. "I'm going to assume you used blood tracking to make it here, is that correct?" When they both nodded, she continued, "And the whole country would have lit up. That's because Slytherin's tomb migrates. It's unplottable. It's a mirage. You have to head out into the desert, get lost, and let it find you."
Draco reluctantly nodded his assent. He had never worn Muggle clothes in his life and had wished to keep it that way. "One hour, Potter."
The single door at the top of the stairs was solid silver. Another silver serpent head was mounted on the door, immobile but presumably awaiting to be spoken to. The shuffling and banging from the other side of the door was louder now, and Harry thought it sounded oddly like the creature within was trying to move heavy furniture.
"No," Draco said and looked away from him. "We said what we said to get the pyramid to appear. That's all."
Back in the main room, Harry used a quick spell to dry himself and his clothes. He then changed into pajamas and sat down to wait for Malfoy to finish his shower.
Draco's eyes went wide, and he shook his head instantly in warning. His eyes darted to Potter and back to her. "I don't know what you're-" he started to say.
Hopefully, he would notice when Malfoy started to awake so he could move him to lean against the window. If Harry was going to avoid acting on his stirring feelings for the man, he definitely didn't want Malfoy to wake up and turn into a beautiful blushing mess at their position.
Harry grunted, his head bowed to the floor in thought, one hand still in his hair. "So, this prophecy...it's saying...Godric Gryffindor and Salazar Slytherin were
"I'll write Ron," Harry told her. "He's said things are slower at the auror office now that they've finally tracked down the last of the Death Eaters. He'll probably be thrilled to sub in for a while."
"Can't we use Floo powder?" Malfoy closed his eyes briefly as the bus took a sharp turn. His chair slid a bit, causing his knee to knock into Harry's.
Harry had to close his eyes again once Malfoy was done showering. After Malfoy had magicked his pajamas onto himself, it was Harry's turn. He suddenly felt nervous and incredibly vulnerable as he followed Malfoy's example and vanished his clothes so they reappeared neatly folded beside the sink. But, once he got into the shower, closed the curtain, and had hot water running down his back, he felt better.
He didn't fall asleep until sometime past midnight, and all too soon, Salazar Slytherin's voice was nagging in his ear again. When this happened, he angrily turned onto his other side and pulled a pillow over his head to block out the pink dawn light.
"We checked out of the room there when we left since we weren't sure when or if we'd be back." He turned his attention to Draco. "Do you want to stay at a different hotel for any reason?"
Harry didn't argue. It was obvious that even given sound logic and reasoning, Malfoy would not be able to properly consider the information while in this distressed state. Instead, Harry just needed to focus on calming him down first. Once Malfoy was calm and the mark stopped burning, they could reconsider the plane or alternate travel options.
Draco's face pinched at this statement, but after a moment, he sighed and nodded. "I suppose you're right. But, if you so much as open your eyes a millimeter while I'm changing-"
Susan nodded as if she were expecting these questions. "The aggressive name and appearance makes the Muggles leave us alone. It helps us be more efficient to get through the streets and get information from Muggles who might have witnessed something magical. As for our origin date, we've been around since Helga Hufflepuff was alive. Granted, back then, we weren't called by our current name, of course, and we didn't help control the magical community. That was all way before the Statute of Secrecy. Originally, this group was made to guard Salazar Slytherin's tomb."
Potter nodded. "And some Muggle money and clothes. We'll probably wind up near Giza or the Valley of the Kings, I bet. Both are really popular with Muggle tourists."
"I was sending a letter," Potter answered. He set his chilled and frothy butterbeer down on the table. "And McGonagall insisted I have lunch before I left. I will still have to go back and pack. I didn't have time."
"Like this?" Draco asked, and it actually came out squeaky because Potter chose that exact moment to press his chest flush against Draco's back and rest a hand on the blond's hip. Was Potter actually holding him? Or worse -
Harry made a face at this. He had grown to distrust Floo powder when Umbridge had used it to try to catch Sirius in the Gryffindor common room fireplace and even more so when the Ministry was taken over. In general, he just hated the thought of being tracked at all. He didn't need the people at the Ministry's Floo Network to raise questions about him going to Egypt suddenly. Besides, Floo powder wasn't the most precise. He had gotten lost in Knockturn Alley when he was twelve. What would happen if he and Malfoy got separated cities or countries apart while they couldn't Apparate? He explained this to Malfoy.
"Not just a memory," Malfoy said, and his expression pulled taut in displeasure. "It is a memory of my mother's. A memory of a prophecy made to her."
"That doesn't make it easy, Potter! It only appears that way to you because you aren't the one having to do it. This is demeaning and pointless. It proves nothing about being cunning at all. Slytherin is just making this a task because it's amusing to him!" Malfoy scrubbed a hand over his face and huffed.
"But...but..." Draco felt like the room was spinning. How were they supposed to function while chained together? Use the toilet? Take a shower? Sleep? Holy shit, he did not like the implications of this at all. He already wanted as much space from Potter as possible to keep his feelings for the man at bay.
"I think Slytherin's having a right laugh about all of this," Draco grumbled after he had swallowed a few large gulps of water.
Draco chewed over his mouthful and swallowed. "I wouldn't have guessed," he said, his voice practically singed with sarcasm. He was quiet for a moment as he watched Potter consult the potions book and then add a few dried lavender petals to the cauldron. "I think we should explore the city tomorrow. Look for anything magical. Maybe some wizarding shops are hidden down some alleys. We saw that market on the way in. We could start there and find some local wizards to ask for any information."
He turned around, meeting the one person who was the bridge between the two, the strange moon and Voldermort.
. Dementors, a break-in at the school, Draco. His cheeks warmed at the last thought as his mind played back how close they were to each other in the snowbank, how a simple comforting exploded into something consuming. "Things have been…well, definitely not dull. That's for sure."
Harry's eyes widened in surprise. While Sirius took full advantage of his renewed freedom by exploring all the must-see sights in the Muggle world, he barely showed his face in wizarding one. Other than St. Mungo's to see his therapist Remus suggested he keep seeing even after Aunt Cissa's mandatory three-session ended. "Really?"
Crabbe escorted him there, knocking into Ron's shoulder on the way and shooting him a look that promised vengeance later.
For a second he was sure Harry fell asleep until he felt the bed creaking from Harry moving closer to him. He shivered from the warm breath that brushed against his chest as Harry placed a light kiss on his cheek.
"And then you came along," Draco continued. "The newest addition to the Hold I was sure would be gone in a few days. A pain who wouldn't stop staring at me. Someone who touched me-and didn't want or expected anything in return. You just wanted to help me." A smile curled his mouth. "And ended up being an unexpected miracle I promised to myself I would never let go."
Draco would've snorted if his mind wasn't whirling with a dozens of thoughts. Like the spider Crouch Jr. had tortured before the class, bending the insect to his will before finally killing it. Harry briefly under the Dark Lord's power and fighting tooth and nail against it. Then to his own parents.
Theo clamped his mouth shut and obliged, placing his other arm around Severus's waist, unleashing wave upon wave of laughter that went on like a tsunami.
Harry's eyes drifted over to the Ravenclaw table, where Cho was giggling along with her friends. He caught her eye and a smile played on her lips. Harry was about to return the smile till Cedric stopped by the table, wrapped Cho in his arms, and dropped a kiss onto her forehead. Cho tried to push him off, but he was persistent, holding her tighter, dropping more kisses that landed on her forehead and nose and cheeks. With a half-sigh, half-giggle, she admitted defeat and responded to Cedric's attacks with a kiss to his neck.
Delacour wasn't the least bit offended. A ghost of a smile played against her lips, split between amusement and intrigue. "And what I know," she said. "Is that a fiery temper will easily be your undoing." Then as if she could sense the frail tendrils stretching dangerously thin, she decided to add pressure to them, words a dull blade slowly cutting away at them. "Yours and your mate."
"Look everyone," Finnegan announced, his loud voice causing the noise in the Hall to defuse. "Weasley's got himself a Howler."
Voldemort looked away from Harry and began examining his own body. His hands were like large, pale spiders; his long white fingers caressed his own chest, his arms, his face; the red eyes, whose pupils were slits, like a cats, gleamed still more brightly through the darkness. He held up his hands and flexed the fingers, his expression rapt and exultant. He took not the slightest notice of Wormtail, who lay twitching and bleeding on the ground, nor of the great snake, which had slithered back into sight and was circling Harry again, hissing. Voldemort slipped one of those unnaturally long-fingered hands into a deep pocket and drew out a wand. He caressed it gently too and then he raised it, pointing it at Wormtail, who was lifted off the ground and thrown against the headstone where Harry was tied. He fell to the foot of it and lay there, crumpled up and crying. Voldemort turned his scarlet eyes upon Harry, laughing a high, cold, mirthless laugh.
"One night the nightmare got so bad that Ron and Hermione had to wake me up." Harry said. "I haven't really done anything since they arrived at Grimmauld Place but this time they were really spooked. They kept hounding me all day, wanting to know what was wrong. Hermione knew that I haven't told the full truth of what I saw, and she was right. I didn't. I couldn't. My mind kept going back and forth between what I possibly saw. How blonde hair is a common color, but very few have that pale white color. How the gray eyes could have been a trick of light but also how the man just looked at me. I was so tired. My head just reached a breaking point and I needed reassurance. Needed a sign that I wasn't going crazy."
"Sorry." Sirius said, dropping his voice to a low mumble. "Got a bit carried away. Can't be blamed though. It's not everyday I get to be the godfather of a two-time winning Triwizard Tournament Champion." Sirius's eyes were bright in amusement. "Who made quite a splash-in more ways than one."
Fudge continued on, saying how the lead on Sirius came to be. The source came from no other than Ron's dad, Arthur. Apparently the Weaselys were out in the flee-market when Mr. Weasely noticed a man fitting Sirius' description hanging among the crowd. At first Arthur had no idea that it was Sirius. Sirius, on the other hand, knew it was him. Or at least knew of Arthur's connection to the Ministry because, before man could even blink, Sirius took out his wand. He fired a hex so strong several vendors lost their shops in the process. Not to mention the crowd of shoppers, including Ron who was standing the closest to Sirius, barely escaped with their necks.
Standing in front of the steps was a tall witch dressed in green robes. Her black hair was tied into a tight bun, and her narrowed eyes scanned over them once Hagrid brought them over to her.
Harry stretched out his arms and worked to peel off the warm duvet from his body, then was yanked back into Draco's chest, arms snaking around him.
His mother stopped his rambling, her icy-toned voice a few degrees below zero. "Do not stand there like an imbecile. Give Harry a bath."
"At least I know how to read!" he snapped. "Unlike some people. And no, I don't consider those fashion magazines you're obsessed with reading material."
Draco was surprised to see Harry wasn't with them. Surprised and disappointed-and also worried. Especially when he cast his eyes around the place and still couldn't find him.
"I arrived at your house, hoping with everything in my being that I was wrong. That the feeling was just a feeling and nothing more," Severus sighed heavily. "I barely had to step through the door to know that I was right. Unfortunately, terribly right. I went inside hoping…to do something. I found your father first on top of the stairs. Then I found your mother with you in your room. You were the only one still standing. Or kneeling I should say. Yet you were so still, so quiet." Severus' eyes glanced over to him. "I was sure you were dead too."
"I will stop you there." Harry turned over at him, feeling something hot and ugly burn inside him, building from within like molten lava. "Voldemort has taken almost everything from me." Anger seethed from each word that shot from his mouth. 'My parents, Sirius for most of my life, my damn sanity. I don't give a shit what anyone else has to say. I don't give a shit if people don't like it. Let people hear about the kiss. Let people know I'm now in a relationship with a person who's always been there for me, always cared for me right from the beginning. Without fear, without hesitation, no matter what, that also happens to be a
"I saw this thing coming towards us, carrying something. It was wrapped in this dark blanket and looked so small. I almost thought it was a baby. Then this voice just said, '"Kill the spare.' Next thing I knew, a green light flashed," Draco's eyes widened. "And Cedric was dead. Pettigrew was pulling me towards this tombstone that had the name, Tom Riddle, written on it."
Draco peeled off the cover. Nestled in black satin was a beautiful pendant, light shining from the thin golden chair and the tip of the white angel wings.
Harry couldn't even finish the thought before he was brought back over to the headstone, slamming against the cold, hard marble. By the time painful red stars cleared away from his vision, the cloaked man conjured tight cords around Harry, tying him from the neck to ankles to the headstone. Harry could hear swallow, fast breathing from the depths of the hood; he struggled, and the man struck him, hitting him with a hand that had a missing finger.
"Hell, I wouldn't be shocked if Potter just killed Diggory himself. We already know he's a psychopath. Won't be long before Malfoy whines up as the next corpse."
Before that day, he never seen Luna look so puzzled but she did as she looked to him, her smile vanishing, concern shining in her eyes.
Ginny arched a brow, turned on her heel, and raced to the field. Giggles fell from her lips as she heard Harry behind her, quickly catching up.
"But I wanna go now!" The last bit broke off into a whine, one that must had sounded much like his own when Draco was his age.
"During the ball, I expect each and every of you to conduct yourselves as presentable ladies and gentlemen. If to ensure that means revising familiar steps, then so be it. Now, which of you will be brave enough to act as the example?"
Hands explored and mapped out bare skin. Pants were shoved away, pushed to the floor. Cocks were freed, bare and tender, lined against each other. Joined in a dance as wild as the one their tongues were entangled in.
It seemed the probable cause. It wouldn't be the first time the Dark Lord played with his head. But making him see colors? On the moon? It made no sense.
Draco screamed through his eyes. Not after being shut out. Not after a summer apart. Not after what just happened on the train.
"If you all are done," The finality in Mrs. Weasley's called for a seize fire. The twins let out a few more snickers. Ginny whacked Ron in the arm for extra measure.
"I can see that, dear," Mother said. "However would you mind explaining to me why you're using your salad fork to eat your duck?"
McGonagall, though, was stern, using the first week of class for notes, notes, and more notes. By the end of the week, the sight of ink nearly made Draco's stomach churn.
"Well then," Sirius said. "I give you my blessing. And I will give the person, whoever he may be, whatever pale color hair he may have, a lovely pike for his severed head should he break your heart."
Harry had invited him along, saying Lupin wouldn't mind housing one more person, but he declined. Actually, Mother declined for him, knowing his dislike for extreme cold weather, adding that a summer apart might be good for them.
Blaise quirked an eyebrow at him. "Oh, I wasn't talking about you, Potter. I was referring to me." He ran his fingers over his face. "It's so hard for the people to peel their eyes away from such beauty."
While that may be true, it still wasn't enough to persuade him to leave his bed, especially when it felt too warm and cozy. Harry decided to use a different tactic.
"How much longer? When I turn sixteen? When I finally graduate? When I have kids of my own and want them to meet their uncle Remus?" Harry couldn't contain the biting anger that slipped into the last sentence, even if Remus winced.
"Prat I may be, but I'm your prat, git," Draco smirked. "I'm also a prat who just happens to have," His hand slipped away from their hold as Draco leaned back, pulling out a package wrapped in silver and white. "Your birthday present."
This time, he wasn't in the graveyard. He was in a dark, cold cellar, watching a boy around his age, shackled by hands and ankles on a wooden table and the Dark Lord slowly approaching him. Listening to the faux-sweet words dripping from the Dark Lord's lips as he told the boy that he should honor for being chosen. Then watching Voldemort shot a Cutting hex on him, starting with his face, slashing his shoulders and arms, marking his gut and hips.
A look of cruel satisfaction on his face, Voldemort straightened up, threw back his head, and stared around at the dark graveyard.
Draco's face was practically stone compared to the smitten, wonderstruck crowd. Expressionless, calm. The only crack in that near-remote façade was the look in his eyes.
Must have been how Ginny ended up writing in his journal, kept coming back to the journal, which lead to the Chamber of Secrets being opened.
He drew back his jaw. He swallowed nervously and licked his lips. Before he could make a move, Mother stepped forward.
The question left him dumbfounded. Did he honestly regret what he said? He regretted that it hurt Harry. He regretted the slur extended over to his late aunt. But did that same regret also apply to seeing how quick Granger's infuriating smile cracked? Reminding her that she wasn't and would never be good enough for Harry? Hurting her the way she hurt him? Draco would be lying to himself if he said yes.
A growl thundered in the room, taking Harry back. Sirius, from his stilled shadow and sudden silence, definitely was.
Harry reached out for the wand, firmly grasping it in his hand. Before he even brought it down, the wand awakened, releasing streams of red and gold that shot from the tip like fireworks that danced and burst around the shop, brightening the place with beautiful light.
Draco turned onto his side and propped himself up with his elbow. He spotted a smudge of chocolate smeared on his bottom lip. "Speaking of sugar, you have chocolate on your face."
A long silence fell between them, Harry sliding his plate of ketchup-drenched fries over to Sirius, appetite long gone, Sirius picking at them.
Draco's wand-picking may have difficult, but Harry's was disastrous. Ollivander placed close to a hundred wands into the boy's hand, half of which were snatched away before he could test it or caused something to explode.
It would have been too easy to assure her he was fine; that he was simply tired and his mind wandered off for a moment. He saw the determination in her eyes and knew saying "just fine" wouldn't cut it with her. She wanted a straight answer.
Both times pangs of sparks that burnt like fire shot through him, sending heated flutters down his stomach, as bare skin made contact with bare skin in the process of bracelet fastening.
Pleasure balled up inside him like molten lava. The tailor who dressed dozens of Malfoys for their weddings, including the stunning one Narcissa worn for hers, had truly put her heart and soul into creating Harry's dress, taking his idea and turning them into a breathtaking reality.
That wasn't a lie. The next morning after Halloween, the media practically became a circus. The entire wizarding world going crazy over the news about the young child who avenged his parents' deaths, killing the man many believed was untouchable. Journalists and reporters alike were going at each other necks and using every one of their connection to find out the boy's location to get an elusive. Fans published their letters in the editorial section, some decent enough to express their sympathies while many asked for requests that ranged from autographs to strands of Harry's hair.
Harry turned to his right. Draco was next to him, nude from the waist up, a book in his hand he lowered when he noticed he was awake.
He swallowed down a lump that was the size of a snitch before he looked up. Pansy's normal brown eyes stared back at him, not a hint of green in sight.
Harry fell under his ministrations for a few seconds or so before he pulled away, untangling his arms, leaving Draco cold and hot and very much bothered. He propped himself onto his elbows, wincing at the weak tingling of his arms. Harry stood beside the bed and held out his hand to him, smiling.
There was a split second, perhaps, when Harry might have considered running for it, but his injured leg shook under him as he stood on the overgrown grave, as the Death Eaters closed ranks, forming a tighter circle around him and Voldemort, so that the gaps where the missing Death Eaters should have stood were filled. Wormtail walked out of the circle to the place where Cedric's body lay and returned with Harry's wand, which he thrust roughly into Harry's hand without looking at him. Then Wormtail resumed his place in the circle of watching Death Eaters.
Their mouths parted hungrily, heat and breath passing between them as their tongues touched and tangled, electric energy igniting their blood with every beat of their hearts. Draco bit down with gentle force on Harry's lower lip, growling as Harry eagerly pushed at Draco's robe and shirt, making them fall to the floor. Harry whimpered as Draco returned the favor, stripping him to his waist.
"Very funny," Harry rolled his eyes, smiling just the same. "What are you guys doing here? I thought I wouldn't hear from you till next week."
"It's just the arm. It hurts," he answered. "But it's better than having no arm. If it wasn't for Madame Pomfey, I would have lost it for sure."
Bad surprise: the field incident-which Draco will forever refer to that morning as-involving him calling Granger a mudblood, causing Harry to pull away from him. The incident was a taste of the possible reality Draco had always feared and had no desire to return to. There was also the fact shortly after the second student was petrified, Draco was roped into helping Harry and the imbeciles solve the mystery of the Heir of Slytherin. Normally, Draco was all for helping his best friend, but he also had to work with the weasel and insect, spending more time with them than he ever wanted.
It was a contract they made when they were six, sealed with a hug. Draco hadn't thought about that in such a long time.
Draco had to wait several moments for his heart to finally go back to a normal pace. Once it had, he whirled over to his best friend and did two things. He first gave Harry such a hard punch to the arm that his fist was stinging when he pulled it back. Then, before the boy could protest or answer back with a punch, he engulfed him into a tight hug, nearly squeezing the life out of him.
Harry gasped, practically screaming, from the sensation. From everything in fact, becoming overwhelmed. The feeling of Draco inside of him, the power of his thrusts, the intense and scorching passion building inside of him like an eruption ready to go, the ecstasy of Draco's bite. It was too much.
Despite the crippling pain in his chest. It was similar to the aches that pricked his chest whenever they were separated, but this summer it was ten times worse. Fifty even, digging into his heart like fish hooks that pulled and pulled with every mile spread out between them. With each passing day they spent apart.
He arched into Draco, wanting more, but his wishes were denied. Draco gripped tightly onto his thrusting hips, keeping him in place, as he sucked hard, driving Harry absolutely mad, while his tongue teased him. The sweet torture intensified as he felt something-a finger-slip inside him, into his hole, causing him grunt and squirm as it searched, until Malfoy's finger found the spot that made him see stars.
Harry thought as he looked at the next picture. Lucius standing beside his dad as they watched their sons play on their toy brooms, Dad beaming, Uncle wearing that same faint, amused smile. The invites to those Christmas balls, the invites to their home, the laughs, the smiles. They couldn't have been a ploy to get closer to Harry and his parents? To hurt them-
" Harry hissed, taking a peek at Draco. He was sprawled on his back, arms stretched out, the frown back on his face. He muttered something under his breath but didn't move.
Draco grabbed his hand once he reached him. In one move, Harry was twirled away from the heated tent to outside in the cool air, back pressed against a tree, and Draco pounced on him.
Moans fluttered from Harry's throat, body arched, as his cock grew heavier in Draco's hand. "Can't… Draco… Can't… oh, god… Draco, please…too much… fuck!"
Pansy's smile faltered for a moment and then quickly snapped back into place. Her eyes tightened, though, as she looked at him. "I suppose it takes one to know one."
"Perfectly demonic is more like it," The boys already lost themselves into laughter again, quickly composing themselves as Severus hit them with a warning glare. "Moving on. I'm pleased to hear that you're doing well in your classes. Lucius and Narcissa are as well, and expect to receive a letter from both of you before Sunday."
Harry slept relatively fast and smooth, Draco's beautiful face in the forefront of his closed eyes and the remnants of the besotted grin tugging on his lips.
Draco pulled his hand to Harry’s face, just as gently, and cupped it against Harry’s eyes. The touch was too soft, too delicate, and Harry breathed slowly, relishing the soothing feel of his elegant palm.
Harry stared at their enthusiastic retreating bodies in disbelief and he was thankful not to be Ron at the moment. Harry turned to Draco, still standing in front of him. He felt nervous, his voice suddenly deserted him.
Harry sat straight beside the blond, vaguely sickened at the thought of being near Malfoy. Harry supposed his partner felt the same, moving restlessly at the same time trying to move away from him. They were both silent, tensed beside each other.
Harry knew Malfoy was the only student to rival Hermione in Potions, probably even better than her, not that Harry would ever admit that to any of them, but Harry didn't get to appreciate how "in his element" Malfoy was during Potions before because he had been a snooty, stuck up git. Right now though...
"I'm not obsessing with Malfoy, 'Mione!" Harry argued. Ron shook his head, staring pitifully at Harry (which Harry glowered at) and pointed a fork at him.
Harry was suddenly back in sixth year again. Draco’s business was not his to know, Harry knew it. And the war was over, no Voldemort to force a sixteen-year-old to pay for his father’s failure, no Dumbledore to assassinate, no Vanishing Cabinet to fix. But Harry was helpless as the alarmingly familiar suspicion tugged at him, urging him to go find Draco and confront him because he was likely doing something that warrant investigation.
Harry all but pulled Malfoy up to the boy's dormitory. Pushing the door open, he dragged Malfoy inside only to be stopped by a sight of Theodore Nott going down on Neville.
But now that he was laying in bed, Draco sat upright beside him, Harry certainly started to mind. He clawed his fingers against his Gryffindor sheets, looking up at Draco’s empty eyes. It was exactly five minutes since the potions wore off, and probably a minute or two since they finished today’s documentation. The Gryffindor dorm around them was dark and silent, and they were shut behind the sealed and charmed bed hangings.
He sighed wearily, weariness carving deep in the lines of his face. He eyed the soppy potion inside the corked tube, then looked at Malfoy, who was surprisingly looking at him with unguarded,
"Harry!" Hermione exclaimed. Harry found it oddly pleasing seeing the guilty blush on her cheeks. He only offered a stiff smile before digging into his brunch, which rather felt like a grimace on his deadpanned face. "We were trying to wake you up earlier to watch the game, but I supposed you haven't slept well enough so we left you be."
. Variables which are essentially changeable should not be a groundwork for Potions that could potentially promote the violation of rights between the involved parties."
Ron relaxed slightly, looking at Harry sympathetically, "I know it's hard mate, but I just don't want you, my best friend, to hurt my sister. You can tell her once and for all. She'd be hurt of course, but better now before things'll start getting complicated for the both of you."
"Lucius Malfoy is dead," Hermione said, staring down at the newspaper clutched in her hands. The Great Hall fell in a somber silence as they too were engrossed in the front page. "He was found unconscious in his cell last night. The resident Healer in Azkaban tried to revive him, but he was dead upon arriving at St Mungo's." Hermione frowned, her shocked expression marred with skepticism. "The autopsy report allegedly declared 'heart failure' as the cause of patient's death."
"You can come to me anytime you want. I'll be here to, er, listen." Draco stared at him, an inexplicable emotion crossed his eyes, much like the one when they were by the lake. Harry realised their faces were inches away from each other. But he didn't intend to kiss Draco on the lips just after he had bared himself to Harry. So he placed his lips on Draco's forehead instead, a gesture of assurance and respect and understanding. He thought he heard the blond gasp.
"My father... had damaged me in more ways I could imagine," he whispered, shoulders hunching as he hugged his knees even closer. "I didn't even knew if he loved me as his son or I was always just the heir, an asset that could serve useful when he saw fit. And being his showpiece proved to be more poignant as there wasn't a single time in my whole life where I was enough for him. I strived so hard to be just like the son he wanted, to be just like him—the perfect, quintessence of a Malfoy. I saw how he commanded the crowd, how polished he was under any circumstances, how adept he was at maneuvering the sociopolitical circles in the Pureblood society. He was a master of emotions, even so much better at emotional manipulation. He was the person that I wanted to become, but in the end, I became the worst parts of him.
"I gathered," Draco said. He wiped the remaining tear tracts on Harry's face and nodded. "Then I will let you sleep."
Harry thought they would be heading straight outside of the wards to Disapparate back to Hogwarts but Draco clearly has other plans as he led Harry far into the woods at the northern part of the estate, past the overgrown bushes and trees with low hanging branches before coming to a stop by the running stream. Harry instantly knew it was magical as the surface of the water sparkled and glimmered as if being hit with light despite the sun hiding behind grey clouds. There was a grove of canty-colored flowers spreading the expanse of the trimmed lawn they stood upon and a lilting in the air that Harry attributed to the chirping of birds in the early Summer morning despite not seeing any animals on sight.
"Merlin's tits, 'Mione!" He dramatically exclaimed. "It's Pansy Parkinson! She repeatedly called you a crossbreed between a beaver and a drugged-out lab rat in fourth year."
Harry supposed it wouldn't be a good idea for him to take the Augmentare, since he's currently feeling nothing but extreme annoyance. Snape said it would "
Harry once again stared across the Great Hall. Malfoy was still eating, but he was now listening to Zabini and Nott's conversation.
He had been afraid he was going overboard with this little impulsive decision, him and Harry were not friends after all. He was prepared to shrug it off after Harry stayed staring at him, until Harry placed a hand above Draco’s and the stopwatch.
well, i guess the CAPSLOCK HARRY from fifth yr is back. I've always kinda loved that Harry because his character was totally relatable. I couldnt understand why they hate the fifth book, i mean yea Harry was whiny and being awful but he had just undergone intense trauma ofc i would be screaming & yelling if i were in his situation. Who wouldn't?
The weather was perfect for a Seeker's game. Harry's hair was whipping about in the wind as he soared. His heart throbbed in his chest, the adrenaline at being high up in the air spiking enthusiasm that thrummed through him. He grinned, the air chilly and sharp on his lungs.
"Look at me, Draco," Harry ordered. Surprisingly, Draco did. "Are you saying they're trying to kill you next?"
"What made you think I would like to be in the ceremony?" Harry bluntly asked. There is no way he would want to see Lucius again, even if it's for the last time. He might think the man doesn't deserve to be killed but there are a lot of things Lucius Malfoy did that couldn't be buried with him six feet below the ground. Apparently, it was the wrong thing to say as Draco's feigned pleasant expression fell.
Hermione's eyes took on a determined glint, and Harry suppressed a sigh for he knew what will progress next before Hermione could open her mouth.
However, Harry's pleasant expression fell at Draco's next words, "...there's nothing like that in the history of the Malfoys. If my father will hear about..." he faltered, his eyes going wide as if he were shocked by the words that came out of his mouth. There was a heavy silence that dulled the growing delightful air between them.
"Forgive me, Severus," Albus said after a few minutes. "I know that you mean well, but is this not a bit counterproductive?"
It was like a new Malfoy had come back. A reclusive, subdued, and passive Malfoy, not the snarky, snobbish, haughty, all-around awful elitist schoolboy rival that Harry knew for seven years. And that Malfoy had passed on to insult him with his choices of books was horrifyingly surprising to say the least.
Potter who has his arms around Draco's torso, green eyes behind that hideous glasses staring up at him earnestly and with a cringeworthy amount of fondness. His ridiculously unguarded green eyes had Draco's resentment ebbing away.
Gulping a fortifying air, Harry felt like being pulled out of the waves of emotions, can vaguely sense the softness of silk under him and the dip of his bed beside him which Draco had occupied. The fog around his eyes clearing, belatedly realizing they were tears. He had no recollections of getting inside the Gryffindor dorm room, probably led by Draco. But Harry was thankful Draco managed to get his friends off his back, proving they tended to be tenacious regarding his welfare.
Harry stepped into her arms before she fully opened them, clutching onto her just as tightly as she did with him, stroking his hair, patting his back. Mother then extended an arm over to Draco and brought them over to the warm embrace.
Sirius Black was the topic of discussion for the next few days. Rumors and theories flew around the school on how he could have gotten in. One student believed he transformed into a plant and was mistakenly brought in. Another rumor was that he made a deal with the dementors, exchanging a safe passage for his soul. The other, one that was the most popular, was someone from the school
"Alright, alright." Harry squirmed more in the couch, slinging his arm around Draco's waist, inserting his hand back into Draco's hair. "Let me see…okay…I think I have one."
He remembered how terrible the weather was. The rain pouring in heavy sheets and the wind blowing gusts of air so strong he had to hol tightly onto his broom to keep from falling. He remembered going neck-and-neck with Cedric Diggory for the golden snitch. He remembered holding the snitch for only a second until…until…
They were caught. The brooms were confiscated. And he ended up with a scratched cheek and a twisted knee.
With the third task, it was like a combination of the two initial reactions with Harry cursing every one of the judges on the panel and every member involved in the Tournament committee to the burning depths of hell as he ran for his dear life.
Then the aftermath. Draco a soggy mess, ranting on about how he'd destroy everyone involved in his "kidnapping". Harry huddled on the floor, watching him, his head running a hundred different directions, the pieces branching out and overlapping. The anger he felt when he found out about Draco and Pansy, the jagged hurt that cut into his chest like a knife when Draco scoffed at him were knocked out like a blow, replaced by paralyzing terror. Terror melting into sweet relief when he picked up the faintest trace of a pulse humming underneath the pale stillness.
Fleur smiled down at him, her deep blue eyes bright with amusement. From the corner of his eye, Harry saw a few students walking by stop in their tracks to stare, gazes locked on the beautiful girl standing in front of Harry. Too bad for them, she was focused on someone else.
Sirius looked like he was tempted to take him up on that offer, but he clenched his jaw and let out a slow breath. He shot Harry a weak smile. "I think it would be a crime to deprive them from this beautiful treasure." He waved a hand around his face.
Fuming, Draco took out his wand and aimed a stinging hex at the girl, missing his target by only two inches.
Draco stared at the man until the words began to sink in, forming ideas in his head, lifting his lips into a soft smile.
Dumbledore. Harry wasn't too surprised. No matter how hard someone tried to conceal the truth, the headmaster always seemed to know. His mind went back to the Whoomping Willow with its mysterious passageway that led them straight to the Shrieking Shack. How the room looked like it was torn apart, such as the chair that was missing most of its parts, including a leg. "The Shrieking Shack? He built that for you."
Where locks of raven-black hair gleamed in the morning light and bright, deep green-green eyes stared back at him.
Looking at him now, Harry felt like he was starting over again, terrified from those unflinching black eyes.
Since Halloween the Slytherin and two Gryffindors became close, practically attached to the hip, forming into an odd but tight group. A group Draco couldn't and didn't even want to be apart of. Harry spent time with Weasley and his friends in the Gryffindo common room. He'd meet Granger in the library to study or talk more about books. At the Hall, during meals, he spilt his time between eating with Draco and their friends and going over to the Gryffindors where he was welcomed with open arms.
Pure, flinching shock blazed in Draco's eyes. An emotion that was evitable, one Harry always knew that Draco would feel when he found out about his father's possible appearance. An evitable emotion that punched Harry in the gut all the same and caused him to look away, knowing this was just a taste of what was to come.
"His hatred for Muggles soon became all-consuming. Before long, he found others that shared in his ideals, his vision on the Wizarding World renewed anew. A new world where only certain individuals would be allowed to live in."
A simmer began to stir in the pit of his stomach, an uneasy but heated simmer that burnt hotter as Draco stepped closer, leaving little distance between them.
"Maybe it is, but that's all I can hope for more. Let someone else have the spotlight. They'll probably like it a lot better than I do."
Nearly everyone laughed, including Harry who couldn't keep the chuckles down. Remus looked both thoughtful and amused.
Harry stared at him for a second or two, as if he was holding his breath forever and was told he was finally allowed to release it. Stunned, he took a shaky step back, then another, and finally turned around to walk to the tent.
After the house-elf packed up their things, the two headed out. If there was one thing Draco loved most about private beaches, it was in the name itself: private. Absolute privacy with no intruders. Meaning they didn't have to worry about searching for the right spot to lay out their stuff in the overpopulated sea of beach-goers. They didn't have to worry about people watching them or being exposed to cringe-worthy sights his mind would have a hard time erasing. And having a glorious ocean all to themselves.
, 'arry." She unwrapped her arm from his and pecked him on both cheeks, the scent of lilac clouding his nostrils. "Draco is very lucky to have you."
He gave himself a mental pat on the back for remembering the vow, and another for not stumbling over the word "solemnly" like he did before.
A small, strange smile curled Draco's lips before he disappeared into the closet again. Harry's mind filled with the endless possibilities of what his best friend could be up to. Draco's imagination knew no limit, and while it was often brought fun, it also brought trouble in the end.
Lucius was at his desk, glaring at the back of the head of the crow. He was a near-flawless statue, his body immobile, his pale complexion sharply contrasting with the blackness of the night sky behind him. Moonlight poured in from the wide windows, turning his pale hair almost silver. The expression on his face was troubled, eyes narrow and distant as if he were caught in a tide of memories, jaw clamped tight. Those distant eyes only looked up when he heard her walk down the two steps.
Adrenaline pulsing through his eyes, he leaned down to lick up Harry's throat, feeling the beat of his mate's pulse against the flat of his tongue. This was his life blood, to be protected at all cost. The low, breathless gasps from his mate only spurred him on. Pulling his hands away from those fragile wrists, Draco sat back and shredded Harry's clothes with his hands, revealing warm skin underneath.
Mr. Diggory flinched, flustered. Harry couldn't help but smile. Somehow, word had leaked about Harry's visions of Voldemort, which fell onto Skeeter's lap. She who wasted no time running the story, portraying Harry as not only a delusional, arrogant competitor but one whose mental stability should be checked out. Less than an hour later, another story poured from the Daily Prophet, only this time it was of their star reporter herself, mouth formed into a big O as she darted around the Diagon Alley with a black dog whose teeth were deeply embedded in her arse, grinning madly at the camera while revealing an unwanted patch of Skeeter's lacy purple thong.
Draco took out his frustration on his teeth, scrubbing every spot and morsel till they were gleaming. He peeled off his clothes and threw them into the laundry basket. He pulled back the shower curtain, stepped inside, and grinded his teeth as he turned the water to cold. He recalled reading from a book somewhere that cold water helped with hangovers; made the mind more awake.
"Not only is regretting a trifle thing," he had said. "but it gives people the excuse to weep and wallow over what could have instead of focusing on the main objective, which would be the future. Time waits for no one, Draco. Nothing speeds up the process more than regret."
Possibilities of what Draco might have gotten him ran through his head, filling him with excitement.
The way Draco stared at him...It was like another set of hands were on him, running over his heated skin, not missing a single inch.
Harry didn't think so. He watched her until she was gone from sight. He looked like he wanted to go after her.
Harry would have been amazed at the fact that the suave and confident Sirius Black was an anxious mess if he wasn't one himself. Which was horrible now that he thought about it. Sirius was one of the few people in the world Harry never felt nervous around. It shouldn't be that way now that the truth was out, but considering the six years apart and spending so much time going back and forth between believing Sirius was guilty to him possibly not, it was hard to find their footing.
One gray eye opened, lit in mischief, followed by the other. "I never said that. By all means, stare on. My face deserves to be gawked at. Have portraits and marbles done in its' magnificent honor."
His mouth pulled into a frown before his eyes blinked once, twice times, squinting from the brightness of the morning sun. With a half-groan, half-mutter, emerald-green slowly cracked open, astonishing Draco with their unique, startling color.
Umbridge took one look at his face and burst into laughter. Harry clenched his teeth, his fists from the sound. For a moment the laughter turned to two, then ten, then twelve, until it was a chorus of malicious, dark laughter surrounding him as he was at their master's mercy.
The introduction was met by the same shattered applause it gained the first time around. Just like then, Remus was unfazed by it.
Draco smiled sweetly at his best friend. "Now, Harry, I think we already have a nice arrangement. You and Uncle James work on the tree house while I supervise from the comfort of the patio."
Harry tried chuckling to ease the tension coiling in his stomach, but the sound was weak and brittle to his own ears. "Not too sure about that."
Biting his lip so badly, blood filled his mouth, Harry looked around for a way out. A weak spot he could charge through. His eyes, against his will, landed on the Death Eater at the far end who was given the harsh warning from Voldemort earlier, the only one silent among his fellow laughing brethren, watching Harry closely, carefully.
Suddenly, silence slammed against them. The song ended and the world froze, quivering and crumbling underneath their feet. Their world that was so nice, so warm, so utterly theirs shattered into glass, plunging them back to reality.
The sympathetic Auror looked like he wanted to say more, but something stopped him. Something that drew his attention to the front of the room, shocking him enough that he tapped his partner's shoulder and pointed towards it.
Another lightning bolt, the size of several bolts combined, shot right at their row, right at them. Harry and his friends ran. He could feel the electricity sizzling through the air behind him. Heard a scream-
"Oh. Forgive Winky, sir. She forgot." She grabbed the thin-branched substance, cutting them into tiny pieces before crushing them to dust. Once done, she tossed everything into the water. As the tea boiled, Draco noticed her eyes were drooping when she took a quick inhale.
"A bit young and odd for my taste," Blaise said. "but pretty enough. Well done, Potter. You must have one splendid summer with her."
Harry looked over at his friends, who answered his silent question with a nod. Wand gripped tightly, he kicked the door wide open.
Draco scoffed. "As if I'd ever get caught. Besides he'd find a way to have the charges dropped like that." He snapped his fingers.
Narcissa's soft expression that was dazzled by Harry's look withered into a sour one as her sister came into the room. Hermione and Neville stood by his side like a pair of bodyguards ready to engage at the slightest hint of trouble. Andromeda was either entirely oblivious or unconcerned by the tension, slowly walking into the room in her royal blue dress that shine with their sequined details until she stood in front of him.
Remus believed it was a good thing, one that would benefit him in the future. Maybe he was right, but Harry refused to see it that way, wanting nothing to do with the rodent. Pettigrew was Dad's friend as well as Mum's. He was Sirius's friend. They trusted him but, thanks to his cowardice, he killed them all.
Draco's nose crinkled as if he smelled something foul. "How the hell you can allow something so offensive to touch your skin is beyond me."
It seemed Draco wasn't the only one who repulsed by the smile exchange because Pansy sneered, "Why don't you two grab a bottle and a room so you can get more cozy?" She gave Granger a nasty, sweetly-sick smile. "I'm sure that will brighten your day, Granger, as well as Skeeter's."
"Black?" Draco parroted. "With Severus?" Already, the two men could barely be in the same room together without exchanging acidic glares and words. Yet somehow Mother believed they would be excellent teaching partners?
A rattling at the window broke the moment, cutting through the spell like a knife and bringing the two back to reality. Heart pounding rapidly, Harry drew back from Draco and propped himself up on his elbows. Through the heavy sheet of rain, Hedwig was tapping away at the window, carrying a letter in her mouth.
Harry bit his lip, staring down at the picture of Mum seated onto Dad's lap, laughing as she played with his hair. "How could you can be sure?"
The words stopped Sirius cold just as they did with Harry, grabbing hold of his heart with their icy hands.
The girl seemed set on keeping her face hidden for the rest of the night, but her sister wasn't having it. She grabbed hold of her arm and yanked her back.
Draco leveled his eyes with him. "You of all people, Potter, should know how possessive I can be. I don't share."
It was so amazing how numb a body could become when the heart began to crash. How slow the crushing process was itself, like an ice-cold fist was holding the organ, squeezing inch by inch, deeply burying their sharp nails into it, making sure every throbbing ache was felt, every squeeze was accounted for.
When the kiss finally broke, Harry eased back, smiling up at him. "I'm curious, though, Draco. What do you want for Christmas?"
Pansy watched the slow, steady fall of snow, the flakes reflecting in her eyes. She was a pretty girl. Not stunning as Delacour, but Pansy was attractive, her hair still long from the spell she used for the ball, loose and spilling over her shoulders, skin smooth with a light-pink tinge, eyes steady and cool as the snow falling outside. Yet when Draco looked at her, he didn't feel anything. He didn't feel strange bolts of warmth pricking his stomach. He didn't feel lightheaded from standing so close to her. Last night, he focused more on feeling something instead of actually feeling.
"'The sound often heard during the search for a hard-to-find word,'" said Harry. "Er…that'd be…er…hang on-'er! Er's a sound!"
"Perfects," he instructed calmly. "lead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately. Teachers, please follow me so that we can find our unexpected guest."
A smile began to lift her mouth as she watched the scene, and then fell as heaviness began to pile onto her chest. Remembering how close those four children were and it all fell away.
Must have slipped her mind that barely any of their past DADA teachers lived long enough to see through making sure the class were up to speed. Out of the ones they had, a follower to Voldemort, a self-absorbed peacock who wouldn't know how to put up a shield charm if a herd of Death Eaters surrounded him, Remus was the only one who seemed like he knew what he was doing.
Anger was rolling off Pansy's body in waves. The glass she held in her hand was slowly breaking, cracks slashing across the cup, the gaps widening.
Theo came in with his date, decked out in a black suit with a bright blue vest underneath and matching tie. The color went perfectly with his date. Patil decided to go with her traditional native clothes, dressed in bright shades of blue andt purple. Sets of golden bangles chimed from her wrists. Her dark wavy hair was let down, the thick curls bouncing off her shoulders.
"Why don't we take this conversation to the parlor room?" Uncle was already heading that direction, leaving the others no choice but to follow.
Growling, Harry packed a small collection of his favorite books into his duffle bag and zipped it up, swinging it onto his shoulder. "Fine, you prat. Be a big baby. See you in September."
"No way. Harry, she's kidding, right? Why, that's…that's…" Ron turned over to Harry, waiting for him to dismiss Hermione's words, for him to say that of course, that wasn't it at all. Harry took in a deep breath and lowered his gaze to the ground, remaining silent.
"It's quite alright, my boy. I understand." Dumbledore said. He lifted the basin, carried it over to his desk, placed it up the polished top, and sat down in the chair behind it. He motioned for Harry to sit down opposite him.
A thin wisp of silver escaped his wand and hovered like a mist before him. At the same moment, Harry felt Draco collapse next to him. He was alone…completely alone…
He took a step back. Sirius placed a hand on his shoulder and directed him to the fireplace, where the two disappeared into the green flames.
." Feet away, they could hear Weasley's intimation of the girl, setting his voice to a high pitch, drawling the word obnoxiously. "She's a nightmare, I'm telling you. No wonder she doesn't got any friends."
Daphne marched over to him with a scowl and punched him in the arm. "Not so fast, Zabini. I believe half of those wages go to me."
The thought screamed in his head. "Yes," he repeated again when the strange force away, allowing him to speak.
Weasley looked like he was fine leaving the wand where it was. Granger pushed him towards the creature. With a sour look on his face, he kneeled down and tugged hard, slowly tearing the wand from the nostril, dragging several strands of slimy mucus along that coated the end.
The funeral was held at Aunt Lily's favorite church during the first week of December. Harry's cool, robotic demeanor didn't wane. Chin held high, eyes straight ahead, he didn't break as he sat in the front pew, the only one brave enough to sit so close to the caskets while his Muggle family was too scared to go near it. He didn't break down once during the service, attentive and calm through the speeches and memories that brought a majority of the mourners to tears. He didn't break down as the caskets were lowered deep underground and he tossed fistful of earth into each grave. He didn't break as people stepped forward to pay their respects, immune to their tears and unresponsive to their hugs.
"And from what Professor McGonagall and Dumbledore told me, you seem to have his talent of getting into trouble."
She even set Harry up for etiquette classes. Harry was already familiar with the basics because of his father. His parents, though, felt he needed to learn more. Two times a week, after lessons with Father and Severus, he'd meet Mother in the library for her lessons. She taught him everything that was needed to know. How to dress, how to make small talk, how to play the piano, various languages such as French and Italian and Latin, posture and table manners.
"You're him, right?" The question practically boasted from his mouth, his loud voice attracting most of the students' attention. "Harry Potter?"
Heat burnt Harry's cheeks as five pairs of eyes, including Minister Fudge's, flickered over to him. He resisted the great urge to melt into the ground. Or make himself disappear.
"The first task is designed to test the Champion's bravery. Courage in the face of the unknown is an important trait quality in a wizard. Plus, I believe it will be greatly entertaining to see how each Champion's wit fares during particular situations." A piss-poor attempt at a joke that was met with a few weak chuckles. "Each Champion must square off with a dragon hauled all the way from Romania, land of the mystic and the beyond. The dragon is safeguarding a nest of golden eggs, one of which the Champion must retrieve in order to win. They will be scored based on the amount of time it takes for them to complete the task and the method they used to retrieve the golden egg."
"He's not?" The girl frowned. "Well you two certainly are close. He barely leaves your side. I'm surprised that he's actually not here with you."
Draco flexed his fingers and played a few practice scales to loosen himself up. Once he was through, he took in a deep breath and played.
He turned around to see Mrs. Weasley and Bill walking over to him. Mrs. Weasley scooped up him into a tight hug.
" He held onto his friend for dear life, as if they were about to separated. Which they were, no thanks to their parents.
agreed that you'd do the talking," Sirius corrected. "I just decided to save everyone the trouble and give the Cliff notes version."
"Just…" For holding him onto tight when he broke down, the news over Severus too much to handle. For putting up him preparing for the tasks and practicing the spells until he was sure he was fine. For believing in him since the beginning of the Tournament. "For being such a really great friend."
"Oh Harry," Mother pulled him back and held his face in her hand, smiling at her godson. Her smiled turned knowingly, almost playful, as she brushed back messy locks of hair. "How have you been, dear?"
Harry's jaw dropped so abruptly, he was surprised he didn't hear a clatter from the floor. Remus-Moony-"You mean...he-"
So fair was she with skin smooth as porcelain, hair like rays of sunshine cascading down her shoulder in smooth waves, and eyes as big and blue as the sea that blinked once, twice, three times before they found the gaze of the king, who stared at her slack-jawed.
Perhaps, though, it wasn't as stupid as he thought, because Harry answered. "No. I'm not. But I will be."
When their lips reconnected, both sighed as if they could breathe easier now. Whenever Harry pushed forward, Draco welcomed it, feeling like he was falling and flying at once. Whenever Harry pulled back, Draco followed him, not wanting the moment to end just yet. Harry kept leaning back and Draco followed him. It wasn't long before Harry was laid flat on the towel with Draco on top, their bodies pressed, curves and angles fitting easily into each other like pieces to a puzzle.
"I agree," Blaise added. "You and Harry not speaking are like these two," He jerked in his thumb towards the brunettes that glared at him. "not going at it. It's simply not done."
Ron, Hermione, Fred and George's heads turned from Sirius to Mrs. Weasley as though following a tennis rally. Ginny was kneeling amid a pile of abandoned butterbeer corks watching the conversation with her mouth slightly open. Remus's eyes were fixed on Sirius.
"Wear the flower," a voice chimed inside him. Repeating the words over and over again until he finally was compelled.
Forget strangling him. Draco wanted to feed him to the wild animals the game-keeper kept caged at Hogwarts. Bind him and cast multiple Crucios at him until he understood even half of what he put Harry through.
He did everything he could to delay his presence. Spending a few extra minutes in the shower, pulling Harry for another kiss or two or three, standing underneath the spray of water long after Harry was done. Just standing, holding himself, holding in his breath, as if the water could wash away everything that happened yesterday.
"And let me guess. You're going to want me to be part of this fun shopping experience and carry all the bags?"
"Now, firs' thing yeh gotta know abou' hippogriffs is they're proud. Easily offended, hippogriffs are. Don't never insult one, 'cause it might be the last thing yeh do."
"Then let's grab some dinner," Susan suggested. She bent to retrieve her helmet from the ground and brushed some sand off it. "You can tell me all about it. The others would love to hear too."
Draco huffed and rested both arms on the table as he leaned forward and lowered his voice. "Certain prophecies," he ground out, and he was delighted to see Potter hanging on to his every word. Even though he himself wasn't a master of prophecy knowledge, he had learned enough in the past two weeks that he relished in the fact he knew that he knew much more than Potter, "are bound by different rules of magic. They're loosely put into a category of journey or quest prophecies where the time and actions to get to the destination are just as important as the end goal. Basically, it means we have to travel in ways that are less...instant."
All of the tension gathering in the air seeped into Draco's body, stiffening it to a tense board. He knew where this conversation was going. Harry wanted to stop, but the words poured out.
His hot, foul breath blasted onto Harry's face as he leaned in close, pleading, "Harry, James wouldn't have wanted me killed. Your father-he would've shown me mercy!"
She looked surprised but flattered, answering with a smile of her own. "Such a sweet boy. It's easy to see which one is the nice brother and which," Her smile darkened to a frown when she looked over to Draco. "is the not-so nice one."
Snarling, he rose his hand up and brought it down, steps to a familiar dance done so many times that always ended in black eyes, fat lips, swollen cheeks, and tears. Only this time, Nisa's hand caught his before the blow could strike and twisted, bringing him down to his knees.
Early in the spring, in celebration of the one-year anniversary of their son' friendship that the mothers thought should be celebrated with as much piazza and enthusiasm as any other holiday, their fathers had gotten them actual brooms as presents which were meant to be opened later. Sadly, like most children, Draco was not a patient child, especially in terms of presents. He dragged a reluctant Harry from bed late at night to the Potters' attic, where James had hidden the presents. Harry was scared, but his fears melted when they tested out their new brooms.
"My boys," she murmured. That steady but layered undertone going through her chest, stacking onto her tone.
The headmaster's smile was returned with a dark scowl. Before Draco could tell the old man what he could do with those capable hands, or better yet where he could stick them, Severus reclaimed his shoulder and gave it a warning squeeze.
"Just give it time, Draco," Pansy said during breakfast after he came to their table, hanging his head in defeat. "I'm sure Harry will come around."
He tried to expand on that memory focusing on the aftermath. How terrified and helpless he felt when Draco fallen off his broom, bruising his knee so severely, blood gushed from the wound. How fearful he was when his parents caught them, his dad hopping on one foot as he tried to slip the other shoe on, a frown pinching his mum's face as she took in the damaged brooms that were supposed to be inside, wrapped in their boxes, and meant to be opened later. How he held Draco tight after Mum healed his knee. How they woken up hours later to the lightening storm raging outside.
"You're awake," Draco mumbled hoarsely. Harry only managed a nod before Draco grunted and fell back on his chest. He heard light snores coming from the blond.
Harry gripped the stopwatch in his pocket, barely concealing the smile that threatened to break his pursed lips, trying so damn hard ignoring Ron and Hermione's knowing expressions.
"But then Voldemort came back. Everything changed as easy as a single flick of a wand. My perfect life turned upside down. My impeccable father had heedlessly groveled to attend to the commands of a Half-blooded madman. My father who was prideful had kissed a monster's hem and cowered in fear. I felt lost, confused; for the first time in my life, I was questioning the things that was supposed to be absolute. And then Lucius failed his task so I had to save my whole family by doing a suicidal mission that intend to kill me and my family. And when I take the mark, I felt like my life had been leading me to it. But I could never be happy, I could never think to make my father proud anymore. Because the life that he promised us had been a lie. That was not the life that I envisioned to live.
"I can understand about McGonagall. I mean, she probably needs some steamy—" Ron shrieked when Hermione pinch his side. "But imagine if the overgrown dungeon bat reads it in his lonely, desolate nights..."
just a heads up, this chapter is emotionally heavy (?) and depressing. pls be guided. & the kudos and comments are deeply appreciated! keep em coming hehe :)
It was Draco who moved away first. He looked intoxicated, eyes half-lidded and luscious lips slightly gaping in astonishment. A rush of heady pleasure buzzed through Harry's body and he dipped his head to capture those beautiful lips once more, but his lips met Draco's finger instead.
Harry let her cling to him sometimes, hugging him in the morning and kissing his forehead to sleep, even if they had been together for most of the day. After the war, Hermione comforted herself by constantly checking in Harry and Ron, fretting over their food and clothes and assignments, showing her affections in an overt, and sometimes vocal way, much to Ron's amusement. But even with her constant fussing, Hermione became more lenient and mellowed out. She wasn't so stern at her commands to work on their essays on time and let the boys have time for Wizard's chess and Exploding Snap. She even join them sometimes if she's in an even better mood.
Crabbe waited till Severus moved along before answering, "Me and Goyle are taking Millie and her roommate."
A wisp of a smile touched Andromeda's face, smoothening out the frown lines previously there, restoring the glow of her still-youthful beauty that featured an extra shine. Tears filled her eyes as she took his hands in hers, brought them to her lips, and kissed them once-twice-several times.
Until…during the last ten steps in, the Walsh Green dragon lowered itself onto the ground and stood still, as if it were a dog awaiting his next command.
Potter!" Draco raged, eyes almost popping off with burning anger and disdain. "I am a fucking Death Eater, always will be. People will always see the Death Eater, the Malfoy. The mark of Voldemort will forever be held against me. My father had made sure about that. It was his fault why I had to carry this burden and trauma for the rest of my life." Draco seemed to stop crying all of a sudden, his teary eyes glazing over, staring off in the distance. "You know what they did to me all those months, Potter? When Voldemort knew I hadn't managed to kill Dumbledore, he ordered me torture the Muggles in the basement. But I couldn't do that, I couldn't Crucio and kill them even at the threat of my own life. So they punish me in ways to assert my submission. Au-aunt Bella... she would- she would make me do things... like... like assaulting the Muggles or she would make me watch as Greyback feasted on them... Then some from his inner circle... they would... gripped my hair... slammed me to a wall... punched me and slapped me... tortured me... because they thought I deserved it. B-because I was... w-weak..."
It was a tender, tentative touch, yet Harry felt like floating so high up in the sky he thought he won't be able to come down.
Harry nodded his head, appeased at the somber look in Draco's eyes. Harry placed his head on the other's chest, the faintest of his heartbeat like a rhythm of hypnotic lullaby in Harry's ears. Arm thrown over Draco's torso, Harry closed his eyes.
"Until after the potions wear off which will take about half the day," Malfoy gently removed Harry's hands off him. "Unless you want to blow off the whole castle, you'll have to be with me to calm you down."
“That was what I was asking, Granger. I don’t know where he is,” Draco replied waspishly. “I thought you must’ve seen him walked by as there was no other way he could’ve gone out of the Common Room. Unless if he could fly, which is highly unlikely even if he is the bloody Savior.”
"I will let you sleep," he repeated, more firmly. Harry didn't know if he could, but the assurance in Draco's voice invoked a wave of solace.
And what Draco had been is not really that relevant at all. What mattered is the Draco who realized everything that he had been taught was wrong, and was rectifying the somehow impossibly deeper hole that was dug by his parents by not identifying Harry even under the threat of his and his family’s lives. The moment in the Malfoy Manor—when Draco looked down at his disfigured face and still knowing it was him, his eyes were filled with conflict, fear, anger and a little bit of hope—was important for Draco’s development as his own person. There had been the smallest moment when Harry feared it would be their end, that Draco would be tempted by the prospect of the false glory Lucius promised him by acknowledging Harry. But Draco proved himself that he was not evil after all, that he could make a choice for himself and choose the right thing to do, and the little hope Harry’d seen in Draco’s eyes is the hope he had for Harry to save everyone from Voldemort.
Harry had been too focused on the slightly moving dot on the map to fling a pillow at his smarmy best friend.
Harry was almost by the door when he looked back and saw that Malfoy was still standing in his spot, still. Harry frowned.
Harry wanted to point the series of love marks, prominent even at the dim light of his lumos, on the side of his neck in retaliation but found that his need and curiosity to see Draco won over. He gathered his pillow and blanket before heading downstairs. Draco was sitting in one of the sofas in front of the fireplace. The flame giving off an ember glow to his face, making him look more ethereal and stunningly sharp. Harry stopped for a second to inhale the air that evaded his lungs before sitting down beside him.
"I'm surprise you knew psychoanalyze in the first place, considering you're not really big on the linguistic department," Draco said in humor, chuckling at the top of his head. The sound resonated through Harry, blinking back the prickling in his eyes.
“He was so different from me. He was brave but not stupid enough to lead his family to their demise. He had a strong personality and conviction, so strong that he had converted some of the fallen creatures who were loyal to Saturnine to the Light. He was the kindest friend anyone could’ve wanted; the epitome of hero with so much love for humanity, as Hermione so called him. He was everything that I was not.”
"Do you want to talk about it?" Harry whispered. Draco's face shut off and his eyes became distant, so Harry hurried to add, "you don't have to if you don't want. I just want you to know that it doesn't do good to keep it in, and I'm here if you want someone to listen." Harry remembered Halloween, when it was his turn to drink the Augmentare, the feeling of being free of the onerous weight of guilt and grief after he allowed himself to cry and feel about it. Draco seemed to think the same.
"The life under the Dark Lord was cold and cruel. The Death Eaters enjoyed killing and torturing Muggles. I still see Charity Burbage's shadow every now and then, still hear the shrieks of the tortured captives in the dungeons for months. I hated myself when I used to think serving Voldemort was honorable because it was downright vile. They forced me to practice their evil ways, but I just could never do it. No matter how I think Muggles are weak and pathetic, I could never think of hurting them because they're as much human as witches and wizards are. But when I showed a small sign of inhibition, they tortured me instead. They made me watch small children getting tortured or getting ravaged by Greyback. Voldemort's inner circle took turns in using the Cruciatus on me, and sometimes they used Imperius to command me to do... things to the prisoners. There were countless of times Aunt Bella made me watch her torturing my mother, and even Imperio'd me to torture her.
"I'd never... never held this way. Before," he blurted out after a moment of silence. Draco's hand came up to stroke through his hair comfortingly. "I wish—this feels great. So great." He choked on a sob, internally hating himself for being so pathetically sensitive, but when Draco's hands brushed through his hair like that, gentle and coaxing, he couldn't help it.
Malfoy slowly raised his head. Harry saw fear in his grey eyes, unshed tears clinging on his long, golden lashes. Harry mindlessly summoned a clean cloth and wandlessly cast an
"It's the potion, Potter. It's not only amplifying your emotions, it also intensifies your sensitivity to external triggers. That's why your anger is irrational. It wants you to let it go so it can somehow be justified."
Being with Ginny felt like a dream. Falling in love with her was easy, being with her seemed to be just what everyone around them expect. But Harry lived his whole life trying to fit into everyone's mold. Being the Boy Who Lived, the Chosen One... his fate was decided before he even knew he was a Wizard. And Harry had been dancing right into the hands of the people he thought he could trust, playing into the beat of their stratagem and he was getting tired of that limbo. Harry had loved the assurance and certainty Ginny could offer but even if the prospect of sharing an ideal relationship with her was appealing, Harry knew it would only strain their relationship in the long run.
Harry fell silent, unable to think of a coherent reply. If he were here two years ago and hear the same question, he would’ve laughed at her face and probably thrown the nearest object in incredulity. But then there was too much that had shifted between them and around them and within them. The war had taught them a lot of lessons, among them are forgiveness and second chances. Harry was in no way justifying Draco’s actions before. Draco was a bully and a bigot, had denigrated Hermione’s blood status and mocked the Weasleys’ financial state. But part of mental maturity was realizing Draco Malfoy was just as victim as everyone else. It was unfortunate of him to grow up in a very unfortunate circumstances. Being a bully, a bigot and a Death Eater were all he really knew, were all what had been taught to him. There had been no other choices for him, just as Harry had no other options as the bloody Chosen One.
Before anyone of them could properly react, the Potion Professor came in his billowing robes. There wasn't a verbal command to enter, only the sharp dark eyes of the Potions Master had the Gryffindors and Slytherins scurrying to get inside the classroom.
“But, at the same time, we were the same. And when I remember him, I can’t help but feel it’s okay to feel this way. Because I’ve always thought... it’s not okay.” Harry both looked and sounded vulnerable and Draco’s heart ached. “Sirius and everyone else deserved to be mourned. Is it selfish of me to not shed even just a tear... because I can’t. I just felt so numb and helpless. I know... I should’ve tried harder but... I can’t. No matter how hard I try. I’m not weak.” He whispered the last word frailly, as if the weight of the word on his tongue had made him feel like he was. Weak.
"Get off the the couch, Finch-Fletchley," he gritted. Malfoy immediately went by his side. Finch-Fletchley sputtered before jumping out when Harry bared his teeth angrily.
The silence progressed in Dumbledore's office, and for once, the Headmaster was speechless, the twinkle in his eyes had dulled. Harry sat down on his chair heavily, Malfoy put his hand on Harry's knee and immediately, Harry felt some of his anger ebbed away. Harry didn't know what had pushed him to shout at the Headmaster, he didn't even understand half of what he's saying. But all he felt was the searing rage that burned hot against his nerves and flowing through his veins, and the pure, unadulterated incense upon the sight of the Headmaster. It was worse than the anger he felt for Dumbledore in fifth year because it had been Voldemort's Horcrux. This resentment was Harry's and it was unwarranted but buried for years, and had been amplified.
"No need to worry, mate. He just wanted to talk to you. And you might want to bring a pillow and a blanket," he added quickly, looking uncharacteristically smug.
But those times, Harry could gave as much as he received. If Malfoy could spat out disdainful things about his parents and the Weasleys, Harry could bark as much. He could care less about Malfoy's words since he knew the blond just wanted a rise out of him. But those words back in the lake hit Harry more than he would care to admit. He was seized with the impeded and buried grief because Harry believed Malfoy's words to be true; they haunted them in his dreams—their faces, Sirius and all the people he loved who died, frequented in his dreams and condemned him for their death. And Harry couldn't fault them for entirely placing all the blame on him because it was true, it had been him who was the reason they were all dead. Malfoy's words hit home, burning the nearly healed scars and piercing through the wounds that went on deeper.
He knew sleep would lodged heavily in his joints and bones, but when he stretched, his body was more awake than ever. There wasn't the pounding headache that seemed to have temporary residence in his temple and the pinpricks of ache behind his eyelids. The sleep had been rejuvenating, so different from the lethargy that he'd always known ever since the hunt for horcrux. It was not a feeling he's familiar but just as welcoming. And to think it was because of Draco...
"There is certainly an issue of consent concerning the Histrionicus Potions," Hermione said assertively, lips pursing in a determined line Harry had seen countless of times during her S.P.E.W. discourse. After they were dismissed from Potions class, most students sporting flushed faces in either annoyance or embarrassment, the Trio had went straight to the eighth year Common Room, lounging by the fire, and wondering what to do for the entire free afternoon. Or in Hermione's case, laying out her dogmas regarding inequality.
After the War, and all the Death Eater trials and Hogwarts reparations that came with it, there were endless opportunities that awaited the Golden Trio. Because they had hugely contributed to the defeat of Voldemort, Harry and Ron were both invited to join the Auror Academy; Hermione was offered apprenticeships for some Ministry positions and had manage to apply for scholarships in few of Wizarding Universities across the continent. When Harry had ranted about all the paperworks and Ministry galas and all the fund-raising events that being an adult—and an adult who defeated Voldemort and was hailed "the Savior of Wizarding World" to be specific—entailed, Hermione immediately dropped all the potential Ministry trainings and scholarships without second thoughts and contacted Headmaster Dumbledore. Ron, to his relief, also supported the idea of normalcy Hogwarts could offer and encouraged the three of them to attend the so-called Eighth year.
“You sure are cranky for someone who’s high on the Sedatus, Draco,” Pansy snickered, not least bit apologetic of the fact Draco had walked in on them, Ginevra’s finger under her skirt, doing... whatever stuff he would not deign to imagine. “I remember you not being this excessively tetchy and unbearable when you once walked in on me riding Finch-Fletchley.”
"Um. Good morning Mrs Malfoy," Harry greeted. Narcissa offered him a small smile that doesn't quite reach her eyes.
"Harry, mate? Are you awake?" It sounded like Neville's voice. Harry stood up and rubbed his eyes before perching his glasses atop his nose.
Though this was easier for him if Malfoy put up with some of their past animosity, sneering nastily and being the caustic, irreverent prat the way he had been under the amplifying potion. But the unusual vulnerability in Malfoy's ocean eyes was enough for Harry to let the ire go. It was all the more hard and exhausting to force out the anger at the memory of the blond's cutting words when Malfoy looked so depreciating before him.
All those times of being trapped, alone, inside his musty and cramped cupboard under the stairs, he had always imagined how it was like to have someone beside him, holding him tight, keeping the nightmares away. The thought of having someone with him there was probably the only thing that got him through those dark times, continuously wishing that it were true.
Harry, still whirled from the strange morning, couldn't help the pull of sleep. Confused but still utterly tired, he fell back to sleep, unknowingly holding Draco to him closer for warmth.
let him feel safe, a little bit sad and sullen but safe and warm, in Draco's arms for just a few hours.
The churning in his stomach went wild at the angered look in Malfoy's face. Harry stared at Malfoy's acerbic grey eyes somberly. "Stop it. Just stop this."
So Harry denied it. He refused to acknowledge the meaning behind the secretive looks he and Draco shared, the thrill that he felt when they did, and the excessive amounts of daydreaming about the blond. He denied the fact that he is but obsessed with Draco. Even at Ron looking at him as if he’s gone barmy, the “you’re getting a bit obsessed with Malfoy, Harry” palpable in his face. Or even at Hermione’s narrowed eyes and pinched face that evidently tell him “I’m not having any of this again, Harry!”. Even when Ginny and Pansy shared surreptitious giggles behind their cupped hands. He continued to lie to himself and deny the fact that he’s totally obsessed rather than face the truth and bear the aggravating fear of what he might do.
“You’re not selfish, Harry,” Draco said softly, but firmly. Harry stared up at him, the intense viridian eyes that only looked at him with incense and disgust before were now filled with an extraordinary display of grief and open yearning. “I understand what you feel. It’s not your fault that circumstances and people taught you that emotions are a sign of weakness. You’ve had it worst, Harry. Please stop beating yourself up.”
"Yeah? But the Death Eaters had been able to enter, hadn't they?" Harry knew it wasn't the right thing to say as Draco's face closed off once more. He successfully untangled his hand from Harry's.
Potter who was the reason why his father had been incarcerated in Azkaban back in fifth year. Potter who was stalking him like a psycho in sixth year, had sliced him almost to death. Potter who was stupidly captured by the Snatchers and brought over to the Malfoy Manor, whom Draco was forced to not identify, hence the multiple
Malfoy's hand touch the blood gushing out of his broken nose, softly wincing at the feel of the clammy crimson red against his pale fingers. It was a fierce and unexpected blow, judging by the stunned look on Malfoy's face. He stared up at Harry, round grey eyes glinting against the firelight. His already pallor face had considerably paled—Draco looked like a broken doll, porcelain and delicate and bloodied, with traces of fear starting to surface from the shock and bewilderment. Harry's anger, frustratingly so, evaporated, leaving him with nothing but shame.
Draco pulled his arm back and put as much distance between him and Harry. The Gryffindor stared in confusion at Draco's scowling face.
Harry was looking forward to the blond putting up a fight because he was such a prat until they would snap at each other, insulting and jabbing and raising their voices, before Madam Pince would kick their asses out of the library, and then they would throw hexes at each other in the corridor.
Harry couldn’t resist the compulsion of curiosity when he found Draco missing whole day on a Saturday Hogsmeade weekend. He’d searched the blond in practically every shop in the village, and just when Harry thought Draco was cooped up in the library (because he’s so much a swot to spend his weekend revising rather than going out) with probably Zabini or Parkinson, Harry had seen Draco’s Slytherin chummies in one of the tables of the newly revamped Hog’s Head, sharing cups of butterbeers and laughters and gossips. It was unusual for Draco, Harry mused, to just be left in solitude inside Hogwarts on a Hogsmeade visit. Unless of course he was up to something.
updating using my phone was actually so shitty im going to probably come back to this soon when i fix my laptop. in the meantime, i have this pt.2 of the past chapter for y’all :))
"No, it's my fault," Malfoy softly said in a broken whisper. "I was—I'm an... an asshole, to you, to Granger, to Weasley, to everyone," he was beginning to sound gibberish, "I shouldn't have said what I said in the lake! You don't deserve it. Please don't think... You're not... it's not—I'm so sorry..."
, when he was five. And even if it was too farfetched for a warning, Harry believed him because he had been inside the cupboard, starved and too close to dehydration, for three days at worse. There was no reason they couldn't do it for seven days, could they? And Harry hadn't utter a
"This is fucking ridiculous," Harry groaned and walked to the door. It was to Malfoy's expressionless face when he opened it. "Aren't you going to come inside?"
had amplified the annoyance when he was preparing the potion and turned it into a full-blown, searing rage. The thing that frustrated Harry the most, and had spurred him on even more, is that he knew that the unbridled rage is irrational and made him felt crazed and manic. It was like fifth year all over again, but so much worse. He had already blasted a part of the wall in the Room of Requirements, and had snapped at the group of third year Hufflepuffs who flocked him.
"Yeah it could be that, 'Mione. But we don't see Snape dropping dead now, are we?" Ron pointed a fork at her as she pursed her lips. "He's still alive and kicking, unfortunately. Merlin knows how long that man dawdles about sordid practices."
Ginny's voice cracked at the mention of him, even Harry's stomach twisted in anguish, "I was so harsh on Malfoy but I was still grieving, I missed Fred and, you know, we do stupid things when we feel grief."
Malfoy raised his head, and Harry can't get over the feeling of disorientation when he looked at those dull, grey eyes. They were once full of haughtiness that Harry once despised.
Five of the Slytherins stopped snickering and collectively looked up at Harry by their table, albeit with different expressions. Bulstrode can't hide the disgust on her face and Nott was glaring daggers at him. It was Parkinson who faked a cough and politely inclined her head.
Harry bit his lip, a blush of embarrassment heating his face as he nodded. He had talked about his and Draco’s cruel history before, and he was so into the memories and the annoyance they invoked that he might have forgotten who he was talking to. Dianne nodded her head for him to continue.
"Listen to me, Draco," Harry said, as gently as he could. "Just because you can't cast the Unforgivables doesn't mean you're weak. You were never weak, Draco. You were stronger than most people credit you for, and your strength lies in your realization that everything you knew, everything that was taught to you was wrong. You were strong enough to let go of your skewed ideals, to undo all the indoctrination from your youth, and to better yourself. And that's what matters, Draco. That's what makes a man stronger."
Harry had long forgotten the last time he had had a nice sleep—if he could even sleep at all. All the nights consist of fitful slumber and waking up drenched in sweat, his silky blankets tightly wound around his trembling body, the remnants of a disturbing nightmare still fresh behind his eyelids. He found himself sometimes afraid of closing his eyes, because when he does, the vivid projections of the Battle played in his mind like a lucid reality.
Draco sat heavily on his bed, exhaling deeply. Pansy stood in front of him, hands on her hips in an imploring manner. He avoided her eyes, though it was a futile attempt. Draco is a master of concealment and subtlety, just like any other Malfoys before him, but there’s nothing he could hide from Pansy. This girl can detect even the tiniest bit of bull shit. No matter how much he loved her long-range intuition and foretelling finesse, it’s annoying some times. He heard her sigh and sat beside him, the mattress dipping under her weight.
Harry hadn't had a wink of sleep the night before, and he was cranky and frazzled. He was buggered by his and Draco's altercation in the seventh floor corridor last night, tossing and turning and not managing to find a position to settle his fraying nerves. Countless of times his roommates had thrown him a pillow on his face as his grunts and exhales had resonated through the Gryffindor dorm room. He almost had a maddening urge to rip the Marauders' map when he was gripped with the intense longing to see Draco's dot, the same thing that had brought him into this predicament.
"It's okay, Gin. I understand," Harry smiled at her, and for the first time he felt no strain on his face. "It would've been really nice to continue, if it weren't for the circumstances. But we needed that to grow up; and to realize we need to let go of each other."
Draco's face lost its antagonistic expression as fast as it came, a delighted smile stretching his lips, his grey eyes sparkling with mirth at Harry's easy acquiescence. "I'm glad you're pleasingly agreeable, Harry. We're just going to get rid of this scruffy clothes."
Their decrepit population was mostly due to the War. Because of the majority of them, and their families, being Death Eaters or were just involved with the wrong sorts even before, it wasn't really a surprise that more than half of the House had decided to flee the Slytherin hostility of the whole Wizardry. Though, Harry thought, those who decided to come back for 8th year were just as surprising; Zabini, Greengrass, Parkinson, Nott, Bulstrode, and of course, Malfoy.
Harry felt a new found appreciation for his best friends' patience during his own angsty and volatile phase back in fifth year. Harry already had a patience for a thread, and if it weren't for the Sedatus, Harry would've already exploded half the castle in his frustration. It was only ten in the evening but Harry was desperate to call it a day.
"Perhaps not in the muggle-world," Father said. "But in the wizarding world, especially for purebloods, it most certainly does."
Sirius waved a dismissive hand. "He always says it but never does it. Can't say I blame him. After all, it would be a shame to take this," He gestured towards his face. "beauty outta the world."
Theo returned her harsh glare with a dark one of his own. "A person who actually felt guilty about what he said last night and planned on apologizing until he sees your
