. Half the villages on this map no longer exist, and there are just as many that aren’t here at all.”
“Yes, sir,” said Kellen. She pointed with her self-inking quill at the plate, which still had a bit of jam-covered toast on it. “We suspect he Apparated away. We searched the house – he isn’t here, and the wards only let Malfoys Apparate or Floo in and out. Wilkins had to get us in before we could lift the wards on the drawing room Floo.”
“Don’t you dare,” he warned, pulling his plate closer to him. Harry smirked.
Harry pulled out his phone. Parkinson raised an eyebrow and opened his mouth to say something. Harry, however, was already dialling.
“I mean, I know that, but hey!”
He sat down heavily on the cot, which creaked beneath his weight. The hound dissipated into the air, like mist on a summer morning. Harry buried his hands in his curls, elbows braced against his knees, and tried to even out his breathing. Draco knelt in front of him, his flushed face worried, frowning. Harry hadn’t realised he was crying until Draco’s thumbs tried to wipe away the tears. He fell forward slightly, and Draco caught him, cradling him against his chest, Harry’s sobs muffled against his shoulder.
He was fourteen, and it was all fun and games until the Dark Lord returned.
Out of the corner of his eye, he noticed Potter watching him, but more than anything, he could feel the weight of his gaze. Even when Potter glared at him, as he had done so often over the years, his gaze was warm, like summer sunshine. Especially now, when it felt like Draco would get a sun burn from the heat of his green eyes.
Draco shook his head. He and Ginny shared a look, his stomach sinking as the realisation dawned on him. “No, they’re real,” he said, his voice barely audible. He thought back to History of Magic, of struggling to stay awake as Professor Binns droned on, of rolling his eyes at the time, only to read several chapters that proved Binns was telling the truth. “You see them throughout history, but they’re rare, incredibly rare, maybe once in a generation, if that. But it happened often enough that there was a law passed sometime in the 1400s, I think, that a marriage could be annulled if one of them found out their soulmate wasn’t their spouse.”
Harry blinked in surprise. “Really?”
Draco’s chest rose and fell with each shallow breath as he stood toe to toe with Harry. If he just leaned forward an inch – Harry seemed to read his mind and grinned crookedly.
Draco chuckled. He knew it was an empty threat – Harry loved teaching his kids to fly too much to take away their brooms. He went back to slicing the tomato for the salad with a shake of his head. Teddy watched him in silence, his eyes distant as he stared at a point just above Draco’s hands. Draco waited. When Teddy was ready, he would talk.
“As long as we need to,” he replied. “I’m not losing you again.”
“Why can’t you leave well enough alone?” he demanded. “Just go back to your Muggle relatives and stay out of trouble for once.”
That Saturday, Gryffindor won its highly anticipated match with Ravenclaw. As Harry celebrated with his teammates on the pitch, he searched the crowd above their heads for one face in particular – but he wasn’t there. Harry’s victorious grin faded, and he turned away from his teammates, only to run right into Ron and Hermione running on to the pitch to congratulate him. They must have seen the look on his face because almost immediately their congratulations died on their lips. Hermione grasped his arm, concern in her brown eyes.
“I didn’t know.”
Draco grinned. “I love you, too, you dick,” he said. “But of course you have to be the first one to say it.”
“You’re late,” Draco said.
“Was that your partner?” she asked. “I didn’t know you were dating anyone.”
“They make you live… in a closet…?”
Draco, meanwhile, was still processing the news. Harry watched him as he sat beside him, placing mugs of tea in front of them. Under the table, Harry reached over and gave Draco’s knee a squeeze. Draco blinked, as if taking in his surroundings for the first time.
Ron frowned at him as they pulled up to the main house. It had once been a Georgian-era cottage, but over the generations had been added on until it became a mosaic of various and disparate architectural styles. Harry loved it. Unlike the pre-fabricated house his aunt and uncle lived in closer to the village centre, this house had been loved for a couple hundred years, and it showed. Ron parked the car, shaking his head.
“Er.”
? Yeah, thought I’d give it a go,” he added at Hermione’s raised eyebrows. Ron had started to disengage from the conversation, his eyes glazing over – books had never been his cup of tea, and he had certainly never heard of
“Harry.”
“No,” Harry protested, but his voice was disbelieving, broken, all the anger washing out of him as he sat back down heavily in his chair. He held Draco’s hand in both of his, searching Draco’s pale face for an answer, any answer. “Please, you don’t have to go through with it, we can find another way.”
Draco put his hand on Harry’s lower back, rubbing it in small circles, little apologies and ‘I love you’s in each one. Harry looked down for a moment. He took a shaking breath. When he looked back up, Teddy had sat up and reached out to take one of his godfather’s hands in his. The three of them stayed like that, their touch saying everything. Then, there was a crash, and the sound of James’s raucous laughter echoing down the hallway.
Draco frowned. “Those words can never leave this room,” he said. “I can’t have my good Slytherin reputation besmirched by such slander.”
you work together, which is unprofessional to say the least.”
“If it makes you feel any better,” Harry said, “I haven’t told my aunt and uncle. Not that they would care much either way, they already hate me, but still. They would probably lock me back up in my cupboard if they found out.”
“But it just… I don’t work.”
Draco had been to Harry’s place before. He knew to take his shoes off in the entryway so as not to dirty the polished hardwood floors. He knew that Harry had painted the walls by hand and that the toilet on the ground floor screamed when it flushed – Bill Weasley had apparently offered to clear out the curse that was stuck in the pipe, but Draco knew Harry kept it because it scared his guests and made him laugh. He knew where each picture hung up on the walls was taken and with whom, because Harry had told him each and every story. He knew these things, not because he spent much time in Harry’s house, but because he remembered everything Harry had ever told him, and the house was just as much made of Harry as it was of brick and mortar.
Luna smiled at her beloved. “He’s fine,” she reassured her. “Draco’s out there with him.”
Draco frowned. He knew, in that moment, that Harry could commit murder and he would forgive him. Hell, Harry could kill
“Like what?” Draco asked. He sipped his water, his eyes narrowing at Harry over his glass. “You’ve been up to something, haven’t you? You had that long call yesterday and were being all cagey about it. Come on then, let’s hear it.”
Harry, who had leaned forward to read her writing upside down, scrawled in a free space on the parchment,
Which is how Draco ended up in Harry’s flat at just past one in the morning. Apparently what Harry meant when he said that he knew a place was, in fact, his own kitchen. Harry had sold 12 Grimmauld Place – “It never felt like mine,” he explained as he poured them each a measure of Firewhiskey, “and not to mention it was creepy as hell, even after Hermione and I tried to redecorate.” His new place was a penthouse flat in a converted abbey, situated amidst the lofty roof complete with white-plastered arches still boasting their medieval mouldings, ancient oak beams and floorboards that squeaked beneath their feet. The flat was long but spacious and open plan, cosily lit by mid-century modern floor lamps and arranged with second-hand furniture. A black leather couch and two vintage-looking wing-backed armchairs sat around a stout coffee table with clawed feet, and a desk was pushed up against one of the tall arched windows. The kitchen looked the most modern, but even the butcher-block countertop appeared hand-crafted, and the way the cupboards accommodated one of the vaulting arches made it seem like they had always been there. At the far end, the bedroom was screened from view by the kitchen wall, while another wall cordoned off what must be the bathroom. Draco sat on one of the stools at the breakfast bar in the kitchen and looked around, impressed and strangely nostalgic.
Draco reached up and covered Harry’s trembling hand with his own, holding it against his chest. “It’s okay,” he said. He held Harry’s face with his other hand, brushing away the tears with his thumb. “It’s over now. It’s just a memory.”
Her face flickered, then disappeared. One of the logs cracked as the fire began to collapse in on itself. Harry groaned and flopped onto his back, knees up and feet inching dangerously close to the fireplace.
March 2010
Draco shook his head. He tossed his apple in the air, caught it with one hand and took a bite. Pansy rolled her head to the side, lips pursed as she looked her best friend up and down.
“You’re a Metamorphmagus!” He smacked Harry lightly in the shoulder, who yelped.
“Since when are you and Draco friends?” Neville asked. Harry shrugged and took another bite of toast. “And since when does he call you
“That went well,” Draco said sarcastically as Harry came into the office. Draco was sitting in Harry’s usual seat, his feet up on the desk as an origami bird fluttered above him. Harry shook his head.
“Malfoy, this is my partner, Junior Auror Eileen Kellen.”
“How are you?” he forced himself to ask, to be polite. His voice was hoarse from disuse. He spent most days in silence, only ever talking to his mother or whichever friend decided to give him a pity Floo call. Potter rested his chin in his hand as he turned back to Draco. He could just glimpse the pale scrawl on the back of that hand, but he knew immediately what it was, what it said –
“Oh, I am very gay,” Draco assured him with a grin. He gave Harry’s ankle a final gentle squeeze before leaning back again. Harry did his best to hide his disappointment and focus on Draco as he continued, “I mean, it’s not like I’m broadcasting it, but people generally come to their own conclusions, and in this case, they would be right.” He shrugged, turning to look at the fire. “Although, I’ll be honest, it’s been a long time since I’ve even kissed a bloke,” he mused. “Not many opportunities to, with the war and all.” He side-eyed Harry, a mischievous gleam in his eye. “Have you ever kissed a bloke, Potter?”
“For fuck’s sake, Potter!”
“Potter?” Draco asked, voice soft and unsure. He watched Harry’s Adam’s apple bob up and down as he swallowed. After hours of work, Draco smelled like too many coffees and sweat, and Harry didn’t smell much different, save the faintest traces of yesterday’s cologne, something smoky and spicy like whiskey.
The day of the trial dawned bright and clear. Harry looked at the pale sky outside the window as he laid sprawled on the bed, running his fingers through Draco’s hair while Draco nuzzled against his chest in his sleep. One of Draco’s legs was hooked around Harry’s, his arms wrapped around Harry’s waist, not unlike a sleeping koala. Usually, Harry would try to extricate himself and start getting ready for the day, but today, he wanted a few minutes, just here. He stretched and settled into Draco’s embrace, his hand stroking down the other man’s back, tracing the lines of his ribs.
“Alright?” he murmured as Harry went to take the seat next to him. Harry nodded and gave Draco a small smile. As they began to tuck into their breakfast, Harry felt Draco’s hand give his thigh a quick, reassuring squeeze under the table.
Harry chuckled, the laugh rumbling in his chest. “After that? Yes, we are definitely going. You owe me.”
“You know, it’s okay if you can’t produce a Patronus the first few times,” Harry said, his words comforting. Draco scowled.
“But it is what you meant! You
“Ex-Death Eater,” Harry corrected him, almost automatically. Zacharias was not the only one to look surprised at Harry’s defence – Ernie and Neville both frowned at him as if he had just said the sky was green and grass was blue. Harry shrugged and did his best to ignore the uncomfortable tightness in his gut. “What?” he demanded. “He’s here, just like the rest of us. Give him some credit.”
“It doesn’t matter,” he said thickly. “You’re leaving.”
? You hit me!” Draco only rolled his eyes and took a sip of his tea, still smirking.
“Potter, you know my policy about personal life in the DMLE,” Robards said carefully. Harry nodded.
“I just don’t, alright?”
They soon fell into a pattern. Draco would wait in the common room in front of the fire until Potter – “Harry, Jesus,” he corrected Draco, “we don’t need to keep calling each other by our family names” – Harry would inevitably come down, wearing his jogger and jumper and filthy sneakers.
Draco was already at the pub when Harry arrived at 8:01pm. He was sat at one of the tables near the balcony overlooking the Thames, chin in his hand, watching the fog roll over the river. Harry took a second just to look at him. He was wearing a black jumper and charcoal grey jeans, his white-blonde hair swept back, a thick peacoat draped over the back of his chair. There was something like worry in the knit of his brow, the tiny frown tugging at his lips. Harry took a deep breath and made his way over to him. Here goes nothing.
“What was that for? I thought you were supposed to be consoling me!”
“In my defence, you were being the asshole, being all touchy feely,” Draco argued half-heartedly. Harry looked down at him.
“It’s fine,” he told Harry, forcing a smile at the canopy of the four poster. “You’ve done worse.” Harry scowled.
“Of course, sir, anything.”
The Ministry atrium was bustling with activity when they arrived, stepping out of the Floor and into the crowded space. Harry had to take a couple of steadying breaths. After spending almost a month locked away in his house with only Draco and a few others for company, he was suddenly overwhelmed by the sheer number of bodies around him. He glanced over at Draco. He only knew Draco felt the same by the tightness of his mouth, the flutter of his hands as he straightened his charcoal grey robes. Harry wished he could reach over and take his hand, give it a reassuring squeeze. Instead, he tugged at Draco’s sleeve. Panic flared briefly in his eyes when he turned to Harry, who gave him a small smile.
Harry choked on his tea. As he spluttered and coughed, he couldn’t help but notice the smirk that flashed across McGonagall’s face.
Harry wondered if Draco could feel his racing pulse under his hand. He swallowed hard and set his jaw, raising his chin a little in challenge. “I wasn’t able to save my godfather,” he said, “but I sure as hell can try to save you.”
He could almost hear Pansy’s eye roll.
Harry sat down next to him, a puff of dust rising from the cushions. “You don’t sound happy,” he pointed out, his voice coaxing as he turned towards Draco. “What is it? I’ll still try to visit, it’ll just have to be during the winter and summer hols, though, when I come to visit Ron and Hermione.”
A prophet once told Voldemort that there would come another that could vanquish him, and that neither could live if the other survived, for there could only be one Master of Death. Mad with power and greed, he found the family last known to hold the first of the three sacred relics and slaughtered them all – except for a baby, who somehow caused the curse to rebound. And so Voldemort was sent into Hel.
“Come on, you git, before the weather gets any worse.”
“Like that, do you?” he murmured. Draco nodded, biting his bruised and sore lips to hold back a moan as Harry’s warm fingertips traced the outline of his nipple. Harry trailed sloppy kisses along Draco’s jaw and down his neck, mouthing at the skin as his fingers worked to unbutton Draco’s shirt. Draco leaned his head back, exposing his neck, his grip on Harry’s hair tightening as he let himself enjoy the pleasure of the moment. Merlin, if his family saw him now… best not to think of that as Harry sucked a hickey above his collarbone. Harry pushed Draco’s shirt off his shoulders and it cascaded to the floor, forgotten. When Harry’s fingers returned to their ministrations to Draco’s nipples, Draco let out a slew of swears and curses, his voice high-pitched and breathy. His hips bucked up against Harry’s. They both moaned as they ground together, Harry resting his forehead on Draco’s shoulder, trying to catch his breath.
“Um, yes, you could say that,” Draco said distractedly. Harry frowned.
Malfoy’s lips pressed into a thin line. “No,” he said. His voice became soft, if only for a moment. “It’s just covered up. They have a no tattoo policy here.”
Harry looked away, deflating. He knew she was right. And technically, he was supposed to be supervising her, he should know better, set a good example. He nodded and waved her off. “Right. Well, good luck then. Keep me informed.”
“Give or take,” Draco agreed.
“Try me.”
“I’d kill for something stronger,” Malfoy said softly. Harry nodded and began to busy himself with pouring them each a glass of Firewhiskey. When he turned back, Malfoy had dried off and was staring absently at the fire. Harry exchanged the towel for the glass of whiskey, tossing the towel towards the laundry bin. He gestured for Malfoy to sit in the armchair in front of the fire. He’d be lying if he said he wasn’t worried Malfoy was going to fall over if he stood there much longer. Harry, meanwhile, leaned with his back against the mantle, warming his legs by the fire. They sipped at their whiskey in silence. Then, Malfoy spoke.
Something in Draco’s expression flickered and died, growing distant and closed off. He didn’t look up from the watch as he asked archly, “Why is that, Father?”
Draco blinked at Harry. “Er, yes,” he said. “I’ve run out of my favourite ink and need to get more. Why?”
Hermione shook her head, her expression sympathetic as she whispered, “Oh, honey, you’re in over your head.”
“I don’t want to talk about it,” Draco shouted back. “Come on, let’s mingle so I can get this over with.”
“Sure.”
“I’m sorry,” Draco whispered. “I wish there was something I could do.”
“See you soon, Harry.”
Draco didn’t know what he should have done when the war ended. After he was exonerated, thanks to Harry’s testimony. After his father went to Azkaban and never came back, his proud head hung low. After he found an apprenticeship at Gringotts, where no one asked too many questions, and moved to London to escape the silent haunting of the Manor, where he couldn’t sleep without seeing the bodies, the blood, without hearing that high, cold laugh. Should he have reached out to Harry? Asked him over for tea like they were old friends? Would he have asked after Harry’s fiancée, feigned a smile at the ring on his finger? More likely he would have broken down, knowing for certain that he had lost everything after all.
Once inside, Malfoy put his hand on Harry’s shoulder, his face pale and drawn. “You’re not going to arrest me, are you?” he asked. Harry shook his head.
Malfoy continued, “But I told myself, hey, just hear this guy out. If he has the stuff, then this will be the last time you ever make anything with powdered Erumpent horn, you’ll just have to tell future clients that you can’t, end of story. I should have just stuck with that, I should have just told this client that it couldn’t be done, but listen, I need this business. My rent’s due in two weeks and I need at least a week to brew the potion before I send it to the client, and I just… I really can’t afford not to, you know? So I go in, Ivanovich was stood over there, he turns around, sees me, and then you lot show up and he bolts.”
“Draco?” he whispered, his voice thick with sleep. Draco immediately pulled back as if he’d been burned. Harry reached over to the bedside table and hooked his glasses on, blinking owlishly up at Draco. Merlin, he looked so young – “I’m sorry, I – shit, how bad was it?”
“Ron, you can’t do that,” Harry scolded. “Don’t make me put a ward up for you and Hermione, I keep that channel open in case of emergency, not so you can interrupt dinner!”
“This,” Draco whispered, his voice rough, “this is really happening, right? This isn’t a joke, is it?”
Malfoy took a bite of his toast. The space between them grew tense as Harry waited for him to chew and swallow. Harry tried to school his expression into one of patience, as if Malfoy was a student thinking of an answer, but could feel it slipping. Malfoy seemed to be taking his time, even pouring himself a cup of coffee and taking a sip before answering.
Harry gave a sharp bark of laughter, surprising himself. Malfoy’s smile broadened briefly before collapsing in on itself. He went back to staring at his hands, picking at a hangnail on his right thumb.
“You think I’m stupid, don’t you, for chasing after the same man, knowing he would never like me back?” he asked, cool and quiet. Harry frowned in return.
Draco was silent for a moment. Harry had to bite his lip to keep from laughing and being discovered.
“Last summer,” Draco said, his voice small and timid, so unlike the proud boy Harry knew. “Mother was against it, but the Dark Lord had chosen me and I… I thought it was an honour.” His lips twisted in a parody of a smile. “I was such an idiot,” he sneered at himself. “I thought I was ready. Then he gave me the task, and ordered me to carry it out, told me that if I didn’t, he would kill my mother first. And if I failed, he would kill me, too.” He tried to take a deep breath, but it caught in his throat, came out ragged and broken. Harry reached out and put his hand on Draco’s knee. He gave it a small squeeze, and Draco gave him an even smaller smile, but still didn’t turn to look at him. “He wants me to kill Dumbledore, did you figure that out as well? He gave me until the end of the year and… I don’t want to kill anyone, Potter, I can’t, I’m a coward, I’m a bloody coward,” he sobbed. “I can’t do it, and now he’s going to kill me, he’s going to kill everyone I love, just because I couldn’t kill one man!”
They walked up the path to the house, their shoes crunching in the gravel the only sound in the muffled winter air. Draco kept fidgeting and readjusting his grip on the presents. When Harry offered to carry them, Draco shook his head and clutched them protectively against his chest, insisting that he could carry them just fine. Harry sighed and shrugged. He suspected that the presents were Draco’s back-up plan in case things did not go well.
“What are you doing here?” Harry asked, trying to sound curious rather than demanding. A memory from three years ago flashed through his mind so fast he barely had time to register it – the smell of magnolias in Hermione and Ron’s kitchen, Hermione not looking up from the
Harry kissed him.
“They have to learn one way or another,” she replied. Harry let out a dry chuckle and her smile broadened. “In any case,” she said, gesturing at the room, “it looks like it happened rather quickly – no sign of a struggle. Whoever did it got in and out and didn’t waste any time doing it. But how did they get in?”
“We’ve never talked about what happened that day,” Harry said, his voice gentle and low. Malfoy scoffed as he traced the grain of the wood with a finger.
Harry raised his eyebrows.
Harry led him to the kitchen and gestured for him to sit down as he put the kettle on for tea. Malfoy sat at the edge of his chair, his back ramrod straight as he craned his neck to take in his surroundings. Harry had to stifle a chuckle at Malfoy’s expression. This was a victim, a potential witness – this was all part of the case, he couldn’t lose sight of that. Not even when he was making Draco Malfoy tea in his kitchen.
Draco gave Harry a weak, trembling smile. “I know,” he whispered. “But it still reminds me, every day, of everything I did to you.”
“He’s changed,” Harry argued. His voice sounded oddly thin, even to his ears. “Really. He’s not the same as he was at school.”
Draco looked up at Harry. Harry’s gaze was gentle, but the set of his jaw was firm. He tapped the marks with two fingers. It was getting hard to breathe around the lump in Draco’s throat.
“Mmhmm?”
Malfoy sighed. He pushed himself up into a seated position on the edge of his bed, his elbows against his knees. He stared at his hands for a moment, as if gauging how much to tell Harry.
“Are you?” Harry asked finally. Draco scowled.
“Okay,” said Draco softly. “Do you want to wait until Harry comes back?”
“Hello, Mrs. Malfoy,” he said. “Happy Christmas.”
“What time?” Draco mumbled. Harry reached for the silver pocket watch on the bedside table, his thumb grazing the engraved ouroboros dragon, and clicked it open.
He looked up then. Draco had never used his name before. Even he looked surprised at himself. Harry’s mouth instinctively twitched into a smile, but it died on his lips as he found his voice.
“Blaise of House Zabini told me,” Draco cut him off. An elf, who must have come in after Draco and thus went unnoticed by Harry, emerged from the shadows behind one of the guards. His skin was a rich, dark chestnut, and he held himself proudly, a noble born and bred. Lord Rookwood balked, his eyes bulging out of his skull. “He is one of my most trusted informants,” Draco continued. “I had him ride to Kirkton yesterday – it’s not far, less than an hour by horseback. He spoke to the constabulary there, and they had a lot to tell him.” He raised a thin eyebrow. Lord Rookwood’s skin took on a greenish hue. “So tell me. Why are my advisors lying to me while my people are dying?”
Draco looked over at Harry standing in the stairwell. He was barefoot, his pyjama bottoms slung low around his hips, and wearing a ratty old Chudley Cannons T-shirt he must have gotten from Weasley. Draco grumbled out a ‘nothing’, lowering his arm to hide his wand. Harry frowned and watched him throw himself down onto the over-stuffed couch, glaring at the fire crackling in the grate. Draco didn’t hear him come over. But then there he was, sitting next to Draco with one leg folded beneath him and one arm braced against the back of the couch, his head in his hand.
, which just made Harry more curious as to how Draco had gotten into them. He turned a little to Ron then and asked, “How’s the shop? How’s George? Has he been working on anything new?”
Harry pressed his lips together as he nodded. “What do your voices say?” he asked, soft and gentle. Draco hated when he used that voice. He would do anything for Harry when he used that voice. Draco shook his head and took another sip of his tea, even though it was still too hot.
“Mr. Potter,” boomed a voice just behind Harry. He jumped and sat up, turning towards the voice. His stomach dropped.
So when he saw Malfoy run out of the Great Hall, he made his excuses to Katie Bell, finally back from St. Mungo’s, and hurried off to follow him. This was it, he thought, his heart pounding in his chest, anger thrumming in his bloodstream. He was going to confront him, once and for all. When he lost sight of Malfoy, he pulled out the Marauder’s Map, and found his little dot hiding out in one of the boy’s bathrooms, of all places, right next to Moaning Myrtle. He set off, planning his speech, his list of charges and accusations, his fists clenched, his book bag bouncing against his hip as he ran. This was it.
,” he said. Harry raised his eyebrows. Seeing his confusion, Malfoy explained, “The name of the cologne. By Versace. Greek for passionate love.”
Ron cut him off with a scoff. “They were only Death Eaters!” he said. Draco tensed behind Harry, and he squeezed Draco’s hand in warning, but it was too late.
Startled, Lord Rookwood glanced back at Baron LeStrange who, Harry noticed, gave a minute shake of his head. Judging by Draco’s stormy glare, the baron was not as subtle as he thought.
“Dinner,” Harry replied. He frowned. “Or at least, I hope it’s dinner. I’ve only made this once before and it almost blew up last time.”
“Er, Draco,” Harry began. Draco blinked, not used to Harry using his first name. “Would you – I know it’s late, and you probably just want to go home – ”
Later that night, Teddy fell asleep in Draco’s lap, warm and drowsy after a bath and wearing his star-covered pyjamas, while Harry read him a bedtime story on the couch. When Harry moved to take him from Draco, Draco waved him off, picking up the young boy with ease. Harry followed them up to the bedroom across from what was once Harry’s but was quickly becoming
His name was Sirius, the disowned prodigal son of the Black family. He had been Harry’s father’s best friend. For the past ten years, he had been on the run after attempting to murder the man who had betrayed Harry’s parents to the necromancer. But the time had come, he told Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, to begin Harry’s training.
“Don’t look like that,” he chided him. “I’ve known you since you were a snotty eleven-year-old. You don’t have to hide around me.”
The room burst into chaos – elves jumping to their feet, blustering and denying all charges, each trying to be heard over the clamour of the others. Lord Rookwood stayed rooted to the spot, staring at his hands folded on the table. Baron LeStrange also said nothing, but unlike Lord Rookwood he leaned back in his chair, appraising the young king with an unreadable look in his cold black eyes. Harry glanced over at Draco. Their eyes met, just for a moment. Harry sucked in a breath as a shock went through him, like a spark flying from flint as it’s struck. Draco only smirked and turned back to the outraged elves.
“You get the nightmares too,” whispered Draco – not a question, an acknowledgement. Potter nodded. “What are yours like?”
Harry frowned. He looked down at Draco’s hand on his knee, covered it with one of his own. His thumb rubbed the back of Draco’s hand gently as he mulled over Draco’s words. “Okay,” he said at last. “I… I don’t know what that means…but okay.” He looked back up at Draco. “What does… what does that mean?”
“And what’s that, exactly?” Draco pushed. Harry scrubbed a hand over his face, readjusted his glasses.
For the first time in his life, he dreaded going to the Weasley farmstead for Christmas. He knew, logically, that just because he would be back in the village didn’t mean he had to go to the manor, that it was so far away from the farm, that he didn’t need to go. Once he was there, Ron picked him up from the rail station, and almost immediately was swept up into the Christmas preparations. Between helping out around the farm, picking out and decorating the tree, making mince pies with Mrs. Weasley and all the rest, it was Christmas before he knew it, then the New Year, and suddenly he had to get back to London and his classes and his life. But even as he stepped back onto the train, there was that pull in his gut, like a string tied taut around his bones, demanding.
“And if the world was fair, Moony and I would have raised you here,” Sirius told Harry as the three of them lounged in front of the roaring fire in the grate, safe and warm in their rooms at Hogwarts. Remus, nicknamed Moony for his lycanthropy, smiled and held Harry a little tighter in his arms, movements slow and heavy with wine and love. Sirius, however, was pulled from this alternate life by reality.
“Why did you ask if I could see you? Earlier?” Harry asked. “If you’re a ghost, surely anyone can see you.”
Malfoy frowned at his hold-all for a moment, then proceeded to carefully arrange his toiletries inside. “It was a gift,” he said finally. “For my seventeenth birthday. He gave it to me when he got out of Azkaban, so it was more of a twenty-second birthday present, but he said he meant to give it to me before….” He trailed off. He shook his head, straightening up and closing the hold all. “All set.”
“Just you, darling.”
“This okay?” Harry murmured against his wrist, his eyes watching Draco’s face. Draco nodded mutely. Harry kissed the inside of his wrist above his racing pulse, and Draco drew impossibly closer. Harry ducked his head, suddenly shy. Draco pressed his chin up with his fingertips. He searched Harry’s face for any sign that this was a joke, that Harry didn’t want this, that this was a horrible mistake – there was nothing, just green eyes wide behind wire-rimmed glasses. Harry’s gaze flickered between Draco’s eyes and his mouth, and he licked his own lips quickly, unaware of the tsunami threatening inside Draco’s chest. Draco, on the other hand, had had enough.
“Maybe you’re right,” he said nonchalantly, “but truth be told, I wouldn’t be so sure of yourself. You were a pretty lousy Death Eater.” Draco glared at him, and he chuckled, the sound low and deep in his chest so that Draco swore he felt the rumble of it more than heard it. “Besides,” Harry continued, drawing even closer, so close that Draco could see flecks of gold and amber in those green eyes, “I have other ways of keeping an eye on you.”
Malfoy smirked. Something flashed across his face, too quickly for Harry to decipher, but enough to make his stomach tense, like forgetting to jump the trick step and having your foot sink into empty space. Malfoy raised his tea cup in a toast.
“No,” Harry repeated.
“Because you don’t want more?”
After class, Harry went down to the dungeons. He hadn’t been there since…well, since sixth year. He avoided them at all costs, and never had a reason to go down before. He couldn’t shake the feeling that he was going to run into Snape at any minute, especially as he stood outside of what used to be Snape’s office. Now, though, there was a simply engraved plaque that read ‘D. Malfoy’ on the old wooden door. Harry squared his shoulders and knocked, but no one answered. He tried again – nothing. Finally, after waiting around as long as he felt he could, he pulled out a piece of spare parchment and a self-inking quill and wrote: ‘hope everything’s okay. See you tonight,’ not really knowing what he meant by that. He slipped the note under the door and hurried back up to his own office. The minute he left the dungeons, he could almost feel Snape’s ghost dissipate behind him.
“It’s good to be here, Mrs. Weasley,” Draco said, raising an eyebrow at Harry who finally looked up and gave him an awkward smile. “Is this where you’ve been hiding this whole time?” he asked Harry pointedly. Harry shrugged. Draco shook his head in exasperation. Molly, watching the two of them, rolled her eyes and busied herself with bringing out another round of canapes into the living room, leaving Draco with a blushing Harry.
Harry thanked them all and told Ron that he would see him later, giving them a wave as Draco none too subtly began to pull them back towards their now unguarded door. When they were back in their room, Draco leaned back against their closed door with a long sigh of relief.
“Oh, such as I like dick?”
“I’m not going to get drinks with bloody Harry fucking Potter!”
“You think so?” he asked, trying and failing to keep the incredulity out of his voice. “Could have sworn he threatened to have me killed just a minute ago.”
“Fine by me,” Draco said curtly, all the time never taking his eyes off of Parkinson. Parkinson started to back away towards his group, who appeared to be growing more confused and uncomfortable under the weight of the onlookers’ gazes.
you, or anything, for everything that happened.”
“Why then?” he heard Harry ask, in that sweet low tone of his. “Why stay away for so long?”
EDIT: I can't do maths. Ten years after the Battle of Hogwarts would be 2008, not 2018. So same-sex marriage would not have been legal in the UK, wizarding or otherwise.
Harry leaned his head back against the wall as the exhaustion crashed over him like a tidal wave pulling him out to sea. “Fuck. Erm. Fireplace. I can’t smell anything else. Just fire, why can I just smell fire?” Fiendfyre, Draco shouting in his ear, the diadem swallowed up in flames….
“Good morning,” he said. Malfoy only frowned. “There’s not much of a sunrise at this hour,” Harry explained, gesturing at the darkness outside the window, “so I thought I’d take a leaf from your book and read by the fire.” When Malfoy still didn’t move, Harry’s smile fell. He searched Malfoy’s face with worried green eyes wide behind his glasses. “Is that alright?” he asked. “I can go sit on the windowsill if it makes you more comfortable.”
“Why’s that?” Harry asked. Wilkins looked down at his pink-gloved hands for a moment. His pale eyes were shifty when he looked back up.
Hermione sighed and shook her head. “That’s easy for you to say,” she retorted, but there was no malice in her words, just a grateful smile. “But you’re right. I just have to finish this essay first…. I’ll try to sleep, I promise. Night Harry. Malfoy.”
Just then, however, they could hear Molly making her way back to the kitchen. Draco stepped away but kept one hand on Harry’s low back as Harry straightened up, more flustered than ever. Molly seemed to notice the change in energy in the room. She pursed her lips as she carried empty dishes to the sink.
Harry chuckled and shook his head at Draco. “I’ve been fine,” he said, raising his voice unnecessarily to be heard. Didn’t he know that Draco could hear him anywhere? “You?”
Then, a voice came from the fire. They both jumped, Harry’s hand falling away as they turned to look for the source.
“No, no of course not,” he assured him. “I’m off duty, and besides, you didn’t do it, did you?”
“Because I told her I’m in love with you!”
“Didn’t your mother tell you that it’s rude to eavesdrop, Potter?”
“My hand?” Harry’s hand brushed over Draco’s eager cock. Draco whimpered. “My mouth?” He turned and trailed his lips along the line of his erection. A desperate sob escaped Draco’s throat.
“Oh, no, not Daphne. Astoria,” Lucius clarified with a wave of his hand. Draco’s jaw dropped.
Draco’s expression twisted and he pushed off the bed, grabbing his jacket from the back of the armchair. “Owl me when you figure it out, then,” he spat. He tried to fill his words with venom, but Harry saw the hurt flashing in his eyes like lightening. Harry stood, tried to reach for him, tried to tell him to stay – but Draco spun away, and with a pop, he Apparated away, leaving Harry alone in his room.
Harry woke up before Draco the next morning. He disentangled himself from the sheets and Draco’s arms as quietly as he could. He put on his glasses, grabbed his wand from the bedside table, and tiptoed out of the room, casting one last glance at the sleeping man in his bed. He smiled to himself. Then he closed the door behind him.
Draco stood in the middle of the living room, chest heaving, as he stared at the mess of shattered ceramic. He frowned as his shoulders slumped.
Draco snorted. “What? No. You must have misheard me.”
“One day,” he whispered against Harry’s shoulder as he gave Harry a small squeeze. “But I’m too tired now.” Harry chuckled again.
“He didn’t come back to the tent that night, not even for dinner. My aunt sent me to look for him. It took me ages, but I found them, deep in that old forest near the campsite. At first, I thought they were fighting. David had my cousin pinned to the ground, but when I got closer, I realized they were both half-naked – and then I heard my cousin moan. They were snogging.”
Harry stood at the end of the table, looking into the booth. He held a bottle of beer loosely in one hand. His smile was wide and his green eyes flashed behind his glasses. His hair, a little shorter than it was ten years ago, was still a tangled mess. Draco hated that he knew what it was like to run his hands through that hair, what sound he could coax from Harry if he pulled at it just a bit. He looked him up and down, taking in the leather jacket on his arm, the pale blue shirt with the first two buttons undone, the charcoal grey trousers that fit him so well. Draco wondered if he still wore the same sneakers. Pansy looked from Draco to Harry and back, an evil smile at the corner of her mouth.
They took their time, exploring each other, memorising the way one arched if he did this, the way the skin blushed if the other did that. “Gorgeous,” Harry murmured as he pressed open-mouthed kisses to Draco’s shoulder, as Draco arched into him when he gripped his arse with one hand. “Beautiful. Amazing. God, I’ve wanted you for so long.”
He sighed and continued, “But we were young and foolish, and in our reckless rage we tried to hunt down the man who led Voldemort to you and your parents. He was our friend, once. When he escaped – framing us for his murder in the same fell moment – he said that he had had no choice. But Harry,” he looked down at his godson then as Harry sat curled against Remus’s chest, “you always have a choice.”
“We can go slow,” Harry said. He smiled hopefully. “I can visit during the school holidays, you can visit on your days off, we can make it work.”
“He?” Harry interrupted. Malfoy nodded.
“Why are you so good to me?” Draco murmured. Harry held their joined hands close to his chest.
“Boring. Frustrating.” He added the tomatoes and tomato paste, stirring them into the vegetables until it began to form a thick sauce. The water began to boil, so he added the pasta. “It’s difficult, trying to do work without the lab. All I can do is theoretical planning. I’ve written something like fifty drafts of various grant proposals I haven’t even gotten approval for. I can’t wait for this case to be over so I can go back to work. So I can – ” but he bit back his words. He exhaled through his nose, then tasted the sauce.
“After a fashion. I know about you, yes. I managed to procure a
“So, essentially, you’ve got a good head on your shoulders, Harry Potter,” she said, smiling up at him. Then she poked at the line near the top of his palm. “Your heart line tells me you love or will love someone, deeply, and that they will be with you for the rest of your life. They’ll be your soulmate, your partner for as long as you live.”
“Which war?”
Draco rolled his eyes but got up, only to flop down on the bed behind Harry. Harry couldn’t stop smiling. Draco stretched himself out, arms behind his head as he settled against the pillows. Harry took his damn time taking off his trousers, his eyes constantly fixed on Draco, memorising the shapes and lines of his tattoos. Draco ran his hand down his own stomach, watching Harry watch him, never breaking eye contact as he slipped his hand under his pants. Harry swore, his eyes almost black with lust. He stepped out of his trousers quickly, then his own boxers, never looking away from the show Draco was putting on. Draco stroked himself languidly, mouth falling open in pleasure, his cock already leaking and staining the front of his pants. All the while, his eyes combed down Harry’s body. At the sight of Harry’s half-erect dick, he let out a shaky moan.
George eventually confessed to all of it. The officers on the scene had found the mask and cloak in his closet along with the Skeleton Key, a small bronze token suspended on a leather string. By that evening, he was arrested and his hearing set. Kellen broke the news to Harry and Draco as they sat at the kitchen table. She looked exhausted, her scarlet Auror robes dirty and torn from where she fallen during the chase. When she finished, she examined the bruise blooming on the skin of her upper arm where it showed through her torn robe, and tutted. “My wife’s going to be so upset,” she murmured, “she cried last time I sprang my ankle while on duty.”
Draco crossed his arms and shrugged. He had sat her down after the Yule Ball – she tried to kiss him, and he had stepped away, quite literally sat her down on a bench in a quiet hallway, and explained that he was gay. It was months before she talked to him again.
“What
Harry stared at the words on the page as he listened to the flurry of French coming out of Malfoy’s mouth. He tried to hold onto the few phrases he recognised, but quickly found himself lost. He set his book on his bedside table and sat up, shifting his legs off the bed, to watch Malfoy. The other boy continued to pace, but he was now gesturing wildly, and every so often his stream of words would stop to listen to the other person. More than once he let out a sharp exhale of air, a little ‘poof’, puffing out his cheeks comically as he did so.
Harry frowned. He pressed a little more firmly against the scratch marks. “Why?” he whispered. Draco swallowed.
“Yes,” Draco sneered. He hunched his shoulders against the wind, his scorn turning inward. “I do
“What did you think of Benedicto’s argument for getting rid of O.W.L. examinations?”
“Tell me to stop,” Draco whispered.
“What are yours like?” Potter asked, his voice low and gentle just like it had been when he convinced Draco to come back to Hogwarts. Had he known, then, that they would be here together, unable to sleep but with nowhere else to go? Was that why he had asked, knowing Weasley was staying behind to help his family and that the only other person he knew returning was Granger, so deep in her studies that no one saw her except at mealtimes? Had he asked Draco because he wanted a familiar face, someone else to confide in, someone else who knew what it was like to be afraid of their own mind?
,” she said again, closing her book. “You were
“Woah, where’s the rush?” Neville asked sleepily.
“Harry?” His voice was so soft, so gentle, but it broke Harry’s heart like a hammer. Harry shook his head, almost fell over as the back of his knees ran into the chaise lounge. He reached behind him, not taking his eyes off of Draco as he felt for the windowsill.
“They were impressive people,” said Potter, his smile growing fond. “Except maybe Pettigrew.”
“I know you’re mad,” Draco said slowly.
Draco hummed. “My landlord would disagree. Plus Pansy would think I’d died or something.”
“Always.”
“You wish.”
I've had this scene in my head almost from the beginning. This is the coming out that I wish I had back when I first started coming out to my parents as queer and trans, so this is very near and dear to my heart. Thank you all for the love and support you've shown my work, it means so much to me!
At around 2am, Harry and Draco jolted awake when their bedroom door opened. It was only Teddy. He came over to their bedside as Draco flopped back onto the pillows, grumbling about ‘having a heart attack’. Harry rubbed his eyes and asked blearily, “What is it, Teddy?”
“That was different. They made that choice for me,” said Draco. “And besides, in this case, you have something I could never have – you are the bloody Chosen One, the Saviour of the Wizarding World, Saint fucking Potter.” He smiled crookedly at Harry’s little huff of annoyance at his accolades. “Yes, what they did was shitty, but you have a chance here to make some real change.”
Ron and Hermione wanted to call. Kellen handed him a long letter written in Hermione’s neat and tidy script along with their twice-weekly re-supply box. Harry set the box to one side and read Hermione’s letter as quickly as possible.
“But that is all in Ængla, surely – ”
A little while later, Draco himself came into the kitchen in search of Harry and found him and Charlie assembling an army of mince pies under Molly’s watchful eye. Charlie, seeing Draco come in, flashed him a sly grin and excused himself, wiping his hands on his trousers as he edged around the taller man back out into the living room. Molly gave Draco a warm smile, and if it was a bit forced, no one noticed. She reached out her arms as she came around the kitchen table towards him and Draco, surprised and confused, froze as she embraced him.
Harry and Draco go to a Ministry gala. Robards is outnumbered. The boys get some good news, and Harry has a realisation.
?” She hurled the cushion at him and stepped back, chest heaving. “I hope it does, because you just royally fucked everything up! Do you know how much time and effort Hermione and I put into planning that bloody reunion? We’ve been at it for months, trying to think of ways to trick you both into going. And right when we thought you had gotten it through your thick skulls, you go and pull this shit! What the hell were you thinking?”
“I know that there are all of these security measures in place,” said Malfoy slowly, never taking his eyes off the hinges. “Logically and objectively, I know this. But I just….” He bit his lip. Then he rolled his shoulders back and looked up at a point somewhere past Harry’s shoulder. “Never mind, it was stupid,” he mumbled. He tried to push past Harry, but Harry grabbed his arm, holding him in place.
Draco lowered the handkerchief, the blood flow stemmed for now. Black bruises stretched like wings under his eyes as he looked up at Harry. He reached and took Harry’s offered hand in his. “How bad is it?” he asked, his voice thick and congested. Harry pressed Draco’s hand with his.
Draco sat down on the sofa, one arm resting on the back as he crossed his ankle over his knee, regal and ready to pronounce judgement. All of this was lost on Harry, however. He sat down next to Draco, still holding the piece of paper in his hands. There was a dark red patch on his bottom lip. Draco tried to hide the concern that strained inside his chest at the sight, knowing exactly what it meant. Harry was hurting himself again. Over him.
Harry raced up the steps and skidded into Draco’s office. Draco barely had enough time to whip off his reading glasses and shove them under some paperwork.
The lock clicked, and the door to the compartment swung open. They jumped back, away from each other, Harry letting go of Malfoy’s arm just in time to see the newcomer cock her head and raise her eyebrows.
Harry ran a hand through his curls, rubbing at the back of his neck. He knew she was right. He had always told her and Ron everything, down to every nightmare and passing thought. But something told him that this was different. This wasn’t just fancying someone. It was like pulling on the thread of his life only to find that it was intertwined with another all this time. Startingly simple but terrifying in its implication, talking about it would only make it more real. Once he told her, it would cease to be a thought he could just dismiss or smother because he alone knew it existed. It would become A Thing, A Problem.
Narcissa wavered, her face drawn and pale. Then she stepped forward and pressed her wand into her son’s hand. Draco’s eyes widened. She gave him a tight smile.
“Well, unlike you, I’ve made amends with people. Hermione and I get coffee sometimes and whinge about our husbands.” She and Hermione had reconciled during their eighth year, both of them spending more time in the library studying than anywhere else, Hermione for her career in Magical Law and Pansy for the Healing apprenticeship. “Seriously, Draco, it’s not that big a deal anymore. It’s been ten years.”
Draco bit his lip. He looked away, down at a cracked tile near one of the drains set into the floor. Finally, he nodded, his fingers playing with his left cuff as if debating whether or not to show Harry. Harry’s gut twisted. Some part of him had wanted it not to be true.
“You weren’t at the match.”
“I will ask again,” she said, her voice cold and quiet. “What is going on?”
“Isn’t this a conflict of interest?” Harry had protested when Robards assigned him as the case supervisor. Robards, a big burly man with a silver stripe in his thick black hair, shrugged.
Harry barked out a laugh. “Tell that to the
Draco turned then to peek out from behind Harry, a small click sounding from the hob as it turned off. He did not relax as Harry had. Instead, he set his jaw and lifted his chin, as if daring Ron to hit him again. Ron glowered at him over Harry’s head, before scowling at Harry.
Malfoy waved him off. “I know you’re an Auror,” he said, as if revealing a dramatic secret. “It’s in the job description to keep an eye on ex-dark wizards.”
“You know exactly what I’m talking about!” Draco shouted. “Your little dare! What, you want to have a laugh, take the piss with your friends about it later? Is that all this was?”
“Don’t like her as much as you want to,” Harry finished for him. Teddy nodded, his hazel eyes wide. Harry gave him a sad smile. “I get it, I really do. I dated someone before Draco – ”
“What is Weasley on about, Harry?” Draco asked, bemused. Harry blushed furiously as he struggled to get up and reach for his phone. Draco’s arm around him held tight, though, as he watched the smaller boy struggle.
Malfoy’s face remained a polite mask, but his eyes were a maelstrom of emotions – frustration, exasperation, relief – that he shared with Harry alone. He turned, shaking off Harry’s hand as he leaned in to whisper, “God, I hate you,” in Harry’s ear. And oh, there was that fluttering in his stomach again, he really had to lay off the caffeine.
“Hey,” Draco murmured with a smile. “How was work?”
“Yes, but how do you know that for certain?” she demanded, stamping her foot for emphasis. Harry let his arms fall heavily to his sides in exasperation.
“Good.” McGonagall took another sip of her tea. “Because he’s moving in tomorrow.”
“Is that you, Draco?” he heard Harry call. “I’ll just be a minute!”
Harry checked the time. He had half an hour. He grabbed his Invisibility Cloak from his trunk and began the long walk to the Astronomy tower.
They would sneak out under the Cloak, a novelty that still hadn’t worn off for Draco – “They really can’t see us?” he whispered after they passed a patrolling professor who, before, Draco would have had to hide from. Not that the professors were as fussy about students being out of bed these days, but old habits die hard. Harry had laughed at Draco’s child-like wonderment, all warm so close to him that Draco couldn’t hide the blush that spread across his cheeks.
“Be sure to write down every detail, Potter,” Malfoy said. He tapped a long finger on the file. “Don’t want to miss anything important, now do we?”
Harry tugged his hair slightly. Draco gasped and laughed, his warm breath on Harry’s lips.
Father Nicola’s eyes widened. Harry’s brow furrowed as he glanced between Draco and the priest, confused by the introduction. Father Nicola didn’t seem to mind. Of course, he immediately searched for the scar Harry had long taken to hiding beneath his curls, but only for a moment. Then he clasped Harry’s hand in his and said that “it was a pleasure to meet him, he was honoured to have him in this humble church.” Then, winking at Draco, he added, “Although, I have to say, I do feel conflicted, since you were the one who destroyed my family’s claim to fame, as it were. Not that I blame you, of course, but Nicholas was quite put out by the whole affair.”
Harry almost choked on the toast.
“Wait,” said Narcissa, her voice breaking. “Wait. Draco. It’s Christmas. I’m sorry. Please. Stay.”
Pansy hugged him tight when he reached them. “I’m so glad you came!” she squealed. Draco smiled and hugged her back before pulling himself away to say hello to Blaise.
“A strange concept, but it’s true,” Draco interjected, his lips quirking into a teasing smile. Harry rolled his eyes.
“He’d tell you you’re ugly to your face,” Harry deadpanned. “Out of the mouth of babes and all that.”
Harry forced himself to smile back. A part of him wanted to tell Draco to never stop touching him. “What about you?” he asked instead. Draco raised an eyebrow.
“It’s weird to see you so… domestic,” Potter said at last. Something of his old self sparked at that, ready to retaliate, but Draco was so tired these days, and it took so much energy just for him to smirk and say,
Harry fished out the Muggle coins and counted them out on the countertop. Malfoy swiped them and processed the transaction. Before he handed Harry his receipt, however, he asked, holding the piece of paper ransom in between his long bony fingers, “Why here? You could have had your date anywhere else. Why come here?”
“What do you think they would tell people? That you’re gay or that we’re… together?” Harry gestured between them ineloquently. Draco dropped his head again as he gnawed at his lip, his thumb pushing and pressing against the opposite palm.
Once again, Draco nodded.
“What just happened?” he said to no one in particular. Hermione, who had been half-listening to their exchange from the cluster around the window, came over and patted him on the shoulder with a pitying smile.
Harry shrugged. Fucking shrugged.
“I want it gone,” Draco mumbled. Harry let go of his arm in order to turn Draco’s face towards him. He gave Draco a smile so soft and tender, it made his heart swell and tear all at once. Then Harry leaned forward and pressed a chaste kiss to his lips before drawing back, his thumb wiping away the tear tracks on Draco’s cheek.
“Still. I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have pushed it.”
Harry frowned. “What do you mean, slow down?” he asked. Draco pulled back more, his smile growing into disbelief. He raised an eyebrow, his ocean grey eyes searching Harry’s face. Harry felt the thrum of his pulse deep in his gut, beating against the nausea building in his twisting stomach. “Show me,” Harry insisted. “Please.”
, into the bottle green jumper. “Your mum knows I’m coming, right?” Harry asked as the thought suddenly popped into his head. Draco, who was modelling for the mirror, didn’t look up.
“This evening. I promised Ron and Hermione I’d get lunch with them. It’s the weekend, so I just need to get back to grade papers and set up for the week. You didn’t answer my question.”
“Read to me? It’s the last chapter,” Harry said with a hopeful smile. Draco beamed. He took the book from Harry and propped himself up against the pillows. Harry nestled in beside him, one arm slung across his waist as he rested his head against Draco’s chest.
“So, before I went to Hogwarts, I lived in the cupboard under the stairs,” Harry continued, his voice forced into nonchalance, as if every eleven-year-old lived in cupboards. “They moved me into the spare bedroom when all the letters started showing up, so it wasn’t like I was in the cupboard every summer, but… that cupboard was my childhood. If I wasn’t at school or doing chores around the house, I was in that cupboard.” Only then did Harry look up at Draco over the top of his glasses, as if to gauge Draco’s reaction. Something about Draco’s pale cheeks and wide eyes made him say in a rush, “I’m fine now, obviously.”
Malfoy’s laugh was hollow. “Something like that,” he said. “But it’s… fine.” He knocked his shoulder into Harry’s to let him know that really, it was fine. Harry, surprised at such casual contact, felt like his skin burned where Malfoy touched him – not like with Voldemort, but as if he had drawn too close to an open flame. He found himself pressing back, just a little, so that their arms touched. Draco really was incredibly warm – wait. He pulled away. Malfoy said nothing, and if there was a pink blush across his sharp cheekbones, neither of them mentioned it.
“So, what’s it like, foreign affairs?” he asked the horizon. “Get to travel a lot?”
They all exchanged anticipatory looks with each other. The girls seemed to all be debating who would say Potter’s name first, while the boys were doing the mental calculations of how they could go the rest of the night without saying his name, because of course, no homo. Draco saw Potter’s eyes flick over to him and away again so quickly, he might have been mistaken. His heart stuttered in his chest, and his stomach rolled so violently he thought in a moment of panic that he might vomit. Like hell was he going to see any of these fawning fan girls kiss Potter. He made to stand up, to make his excuses, to escape to the quiet of their dorm, when Potter caught his eye and, for the first time in a week, held it.
“Exactly. I’ll be back tomorrow afternoon. If he hurts my grandson – ”
Harry rolled his eyes. “I don’t care about outing you, Draco,” he snapped. Draco, unable to hide his surprise, stumbled to a stop, eyebrows raised. Harry slowed and stopped, hands buried in the pockets of his leather jacket, his expression unreadable.
Harry’s laugh startled him. He looked over with a scowl, but Harry’s face was so gentle, his crooked smile so comforting, that Draco couldn’t help but smile back.
Draco sighed. He leaned his forehead against Harry’s, their noses brushing. “I want to,” he murmured after another deep, steadying breath that Harry could feel against his own skin. “I’m just afraid of what you’ll see.”
“Want to talk? Outside?” he murmured. Draco tried to swallow the shiver that ran through him, to fight the urge to turn his head and catch those lips with his. He managed to nod again, and stepped back, gesturing for Harry to lead the way. Harry smirked, but it didn’t reach his eyes.
“No, it isn’t! The crust tastes weird.”
“Are you a ghost?” Harry asked. The man gave a surprised chuckle.
“What do you mean, you remembered? How is that possible?” Draco asked, half under his breath, as if asking the universe rather than Harry. Harry bit his lip as he tried to think of a way to prove what he had seen. Then, he straightened up and said,
“Ron!” Hermione hissed. Harry only blinked in surprise.
The kettle whistled. He poured the hot water into the cup and was about to sit back in his spot when the door opened. Startled, he spilled some of the hot water, barely avoiding getting any on his nice bathrobe.
Harry turned, his expression so fond and earnest it made Draco’s heart break. “I forgave you a long time ago,” he said quietly. “We were kids, Draco, trying to be what the world expected us to be. Now we get to be who we want to be. Nothing else matters.”
“You see this? I am savouring my breakfast, not inhaling it like some animal. Just because I haven’t eaten my toast yet doesn’t mean I’m not going to.”
, Death whispered again.
“Fuck off, go to sleep.”
TW: implied homophobia, references to sexual harassment, public outing
“Well, that’s not entirely true,” Harry pointed out. “This is a lot like a stakeout, really, like the one I did on the drug ring last year? I was gone a whole week that time.”
“Okay, maybe not strong enough to carry another person, but we can’t all be super fit.”
“There are
. It’s all mechanical and awkward and uncomfortable, and I thought that was the way it was for everyone but… Draco said I should enjoy it and I realised that I … don’t.”
He heard Ron snort behind him and grinned. Draco pressed his lips together to resist the smirk that threatened to spread across his face. Robards, however, was not amused. But before he could get in another snide remark, Hermione had gotten up and put herself in between him and Harry. She pulled her shawl tighter around her shoulders as she looked Robards dead in the eye.
“Because Dumbledore was biased, obviously.”
Harry glanced up, one eyebrow raised. “Oh really?” he asked, his voice rough and husky from arousal sending shivers down Draco’s spine. “What do you want, then?”
“She’s fine, thank you.”
“Obviously,” he sneered. It didn’t come out sounding as confident as he had planned and he cursed his voice for betraying him. Harry raised an eyebrow, so Draco continued, “It only make sense, doesn’t it? You have to….” He paused to lick his dry lips. Harry’s gaze flickered from Draco’s eyes to his mouth and back again. Circe, if he had been anyone else, Draco would have given in. As it was, he was not about to be attracted to Harry bloody Potter. “You have to keep an eye on the ex-Death Eater,” he spat at last.
“Do you have something you want to tell me?” he asked, his voice a barely audible murmur. Draco shrugged, watching as Harry was berated by the elderly woman who was, it seemed, half-deaf, half-blind and convinced Harry was her nephew.
In that moment, all was well.
“How was your day?” Harry asked, glancing at Draco just in time to see him look at Harry in surprise. Draco pursed his lips.
He was fifteen, angry and petty and wanting to
“Oh really? Because that’s what it looks like!”
“I love you, too,” he replied.
Harry turned around, dispelling Malfoy’s binds without a word. Malfoy stood, shaking out his arms and rolling his shoulders with a groan.
He would think about what Father Flamel said about belief and faith almost every day. He thought about it as he fixed the Vanishing Cabinet in secret. He thought about it as he pointed his wand at his disarmed headmaster and tried with all his might to say the words, to carry out the task. But in the end, he had been pushed aside, and it was Snape, not him, who killed Dumbledore.
“Yeah, probably,” Draco admitted. He rubbed Harry’s back. “But I’m legally allowed a break, so you’ve got, oh,” he cast a quick
Harry scrambled to his feet, shoving his glasses back on. He backed away from Draco towards the open window. Draco stood and tried to reach for Harry, the concerned crease between his eyebrows deepening.
“It’s so nice,” Parkinson drawled, his greasy smile broadening, “to see you two become so close. But I guess it’s true what they say. Birds of a feather and all that.” He sneered at the two of them as he stood only a few feet away. “It makes our job a little easier then, doesn’t it?”
Ron scowled but relented with another ‘humph.’ When he bent down to try to get Rose to eat another bite of mushy peas, Hermione caught Harry’s eye and gave him an apologetic smile. “Sorry about him,” she mouthed. Harry smiled back and shrugged to say, “It’s Ron, it’s fine.” She nodded with a sigh, but just then Rose spat up all her mushy peas, and she had to whisk her toddler away to clean her up.
“Can he?” Ron asked darkly. Hermione rolled her eyes.
“Harry, I’m – oh.”
“Wha’ is it?” Draco mumbled next to him. He pushed himself up into a seated position as he blinked blearily at Harry. Harry swallowed, trying to even his breathing out. His mind began to catch up to his panic. The room became familiar once more, the pale moonlight illuminating hulking, forbidding shapes and turning them back into armchairs and cloaks hung up on closet doors, blurry and indistinct without his glasses. Still struggling to deepen his panting breaths, he looked down at the sheets tangled around him, his brain trying to reconcile his reality with his nightmare. He had apparently dislodged a sleeping Draco when he had sat up. Draco positioned himself half behind Harry so that he could wrap his arms around Harry’s waist, tugging him back down into bed.
“That is all to say that she is relatively supportive. She always has been. Father on the other hand….” Draco’s smile faded. He lowered his head down to stare at the ceiling, his thumb absentmindedly rubbing circles into the skin behind Harry’s ear. Draco frowned as the thought of his father loomed. Don’t make waves. “I told Mother not to tell him,” Draco murmured, “but he’s bound to find out at some point. Especially with Parkinson being the snitch that he is.” His frown became a dark scowl. “It is not like he can do much from prison himself, but… he has his ways.”
“Shut up.”
Harry smiled sympathetically at his over-achieving friend. “I’m okay, just enjoying the party. Try to get some sleep, Hermione, won’t you? You need to take care of yourself. Your health is more important than a grade.”
Harry grinned down at the cat as he leaned back on his hands. “This is my kind of cat,” he chuckled. “Although he does remind me a bit of Crookshanks, who absolutely hated me.” He glanced at Draco, sucked his lower lip between his teeth as he considered the other man. Draco felt his cheeks flush and refused to meet his gaze, instead focusing entirely on petting Scorpius. “Why did you come to see me at the Ministry?” he asked.
“It was a nightmare,” Draco whispered, his voice thick with sleep. Harry resisted the primal urge to struggle against Draco’s arms and let himself be pulled down, his head on Draco’s chest, cheek pressed against silver silk pyjamas. “It’s okay. You’re at Hogwarts. It’s December. It’s 2008. I’m here, with you,” Draco was murmuring as he ran his fingers through Harry’s unruly hair. Harry closed his eyes, trying to relax into Draco’s touch, to listen to his voice grounding him here, now. “We’re in your bed, in your room, in Hogwarts. The war is over. We’re professors. I’m here, with you. I’m here. I got you.”
“Well, grand-cousin, right? Is that a thing?”
“For the last time,” Harry snapped, anger rising in his chest, “I didn’t know you worked there! And you were the one who talked to me after! And you said yes! You picked the time, the place, everything! You could have said no – so why didn’t you?”
Draco rolled his eyes, but his smile was more relaxed as he muttered, “Why are you like this?”
“Draco, babe, you should go,” Harry said in an undertone.
Draco looked up at that. “Does that mean – do I have to – can I go back to my flat, or should I stay here, still?”
Malfoy rubbed at his brow, his eyes distant and unfocused. After a moment, he shook his head. “No, there were always other curses,” he said, his voice muffled as he leaned his chin in his hand. “As far as I know, it’s only been used twice before now.” He raised his eyes, his gaze meeting Harry’s. He didn’t need to say anything more. Harry pursed his lips and nodded.
“If you say you were just curious, I will beat you with that ridiculous book.”

“Draco? As in… Draco
“And you say I’m eloquent.” He smiled when Draco scowled at him but relented and said, “That wasn’t until recently. Well, a couple years, really.” Draco’s eyebrows shot up, and he quickly added, “I never thought I’d act on it! I just… thought about you a lot. Especially when Ginny and I started having problems.” He grew quiet for a moment, dropping his gaze down to his plate. Then he said, quietly, “Although, maybe, it’s always been there, and I just didn’t want to admit it to myself. And now… it would be easier if it was just a crush, you know? I thought, maybe, if I kissed you, I would get it out of my system – selfish, I know, but it’d gotten to the point where it’s been keeping me up at night and then you were looking at me like that and I just…broke.”
“You’re one to talk,” he snapped. “You can produce a corporeal Patronus. I’ve been trying for years and I can’t even get a wisp of smoke!”
Kellen had managed to prop Draco up and was helping him press a linen handkerchief to his bleeding nose. As Harry fell to his knees beside him, he heard her murmur, “This is going to hurt”, then a quick “
Lord Rookwood and Baron LeStrange shared a fleeting look. Draco frowned.
“Down in the kitchen, sir. He was very upset. We got his statement, I have it here, and there’s an officer down there with him, but he insisted that he carry on with his chores. I suspect he’s in shock, sir.”
“And what?” Harry prompted. “You wanted to give me a proper send off or something? You missed my quitting party at Ron and Hermione’s last weekend, in that case. It was great. I got quite sloshed, to be honest, so I don’t remember a lot, but it was fun from what I do remember.”
“Does it matter?” Draco asked, setting his cup down on the kitchen counter. “You’ll go back to Hogwarts and you’ll never hear from me until the next reunion. This was just one night, Harry. It didn’t mean anything.”
“I- I don’t know. I thought…”
“You can’t save everyone, Potter.” He raised a hand to place against Harry’s neck with a sad smile. “You can’t always be the hero.”
“No,” Harry spluttered, leaning forward in his chair, “no, I don’t understand! Professor, we can’t let him go back! It’s too dangerous! We have to protect him!”
“Aurors Potter and Weasley!” Robards boomed. He strode over to the pair with a strict look that could rival McGonagall’s any day. “This is a place of work. Could you please lower your voice and act with at least a modicum of decorum?”
“You’re not the only one with secrets,” he said in lieu of an explanation. He tugged Draco onto the stairs, and as they were carried up, he gave Draco a curious smile. “What?” he asked. Draco shook his head.
“Oh.” Harry put his hand back in his pocket, rocked back on his heels. “Sorry.”
By the time he got to the top of the Astronomy Tower, he was even more sweaty and out of breath than he was when the match ended. He leaned against the doorway, gulping in deep lungful’s of fresh air as he tried to slow his racing heart. The tall figure standing braced against the parapet didn’t turn around. Breath caught, Harry said,
Kellen and a handful of Aurors rushed in to break up the fight. Humphries stepped in and bodily hauled Ron away, his arms trapping Ron’s to his sides. He nodded his stony face at Harry and said over Ron’s caterwauling, “Go, sir. I’ve got this.” Harry didn’t need telling twice.
“Yeah, mate, but that was one week. You’ve been gone almost a whole month,” Ron argued. He was trying to grow a moustache and Harry made a mental note to tell him to give it up – it made him look like he had no mouth. “Does this have anything to do with those murders of ex-Death Eaters?” Ron asked. “We’ve been following it in the news. A real mystery, that one.”
“So, what did you want to talk about?” she prompted him. “All your letter said was that you were worried something was wrong. Is it your scar? Did something happen?”
“I knew you would say that, which was why I wasn’t going to tell you. But come on, Draco, it’ll be fun, I promise.”
Harry stared at him. The words echoed in the grand hall, the only other sound the distant moaning of some underwater creature in the lake beyond the window. “You’re a necromancer?” he spluttered, momentarily forgetting all sense of decorum. The king let out a sharp laugh and waved his hand.
“Of course, I just… Does this mean he’s the new head of Slytherin house?” he asked. She nodded stiffly. Harry shook his head. “Well, I can’t wait for the Gryffindor team to beat Slytherin to the House Cup this year, then. It’ll be just like old times, right, Minerva?” He raised a cheeky eyebrow, and McGonagall rolled her eyes with a smile.
“I think he really likes you,” Harry said. He got settled into bed and set his glasses on the bedside table. Draco chuckled to himself as he got in beside Harry, tucking himself into the other man’s side.
There it was again, at the end of the hall – a flash of white. Harry followed it, past portraits of regal men and women with cold grey eyes, down towards the main entryway. There was the front door, paint peeling and cracked. Across from it, a grand staircase with gilded balustrades, the steps lined with red velvet carpet, faded now and worn bald down the middle. Harry’s eye caught a flurry of movement at the top of the stairs, and this time, the white flash had a form – a young man, tall and pale. He didn’t think. He ran up the steps.
Draco pursed his lips. He looked down at Harry’s hand still holding his and covered it with his free hand. When he looked back up, he gave Harry a small smile.
“Ah, well, Harry is practically my son, and my children are expected to help their mother. There’s a difference,” Molly pointed out as the now empty pot flew across the room to join the rest of the dishes in the sink. Harry nodded sagely at this. In a matter-of-fact monotone, he explained to Draco,
So Harry set the letter-writing set aside, shaking his head with a smile, and picked up the book. The smell of leather was strong, as if the book had only recently been bound, and there were no words embossed on the spine or cover. Harry opened it curiously to the front page. He let out a soft gasp as he read:
“As you wish,
Several minutes later, Malfoy came back into the kitchen with two vials of pearly white liquid. He gave one to Kellen, who immediately took it and poured it into the Pensieve. He pulled Harry aside and pressed the other vial into his hand. Harry’s brow furrowed in confusion.
“Perfect. I’ll see if someone can cover my Sunday shift.”
He had just put his hand on the drawer handle when he heard Draco’s voice down the hall, speaking in hurried French. Harry jumped and scampered over to his side of the room, trying to look like he had just been in the process of unpacking when Draco showed up. He needn’t have bothered. Draco gave him a quick nod when he came in, closing the door behind him, before continuing his conversation on the phone as he dropped his luggage on his bed. By the time he hung up, Harry had put away his clothes and toiletries and was playing on his phone as he sat on his bed. Draco set his phone down with a sigh and opened his luggage.
“You don’t believe in God, correct? And magic – well, you don’t need to believe in it for it to be real, it’s simply there. So what do you believe in? I’m not asking about what side of the war you think is right. I’m asking, at the end of the day, what, or who, you can put your faith in.”
“That’s a ‘you’ problem,” she murmured, “not my problem.”
“Want to take this to the bedroom?” Harry asked, pulling away just enough to look him in the eye. Draco froze. This, Harry realised. This was why he’d lashed out at Ron, twice now. That despite what he’d said, despite the occasional blowjob or hand down the trousers, they had never actually slept together. Draco refused to take off his shirt, or even his trousers. And Harry never pushed it, never wanted to pressure him into anything. Even now, he rocked back on his heels, ready to concede again. Except this time, Draco was pulling him back. He bit his lip and ducked his head nervously, but when he did manage to meet Harry’s confused gaze, he smiled.
Harry took hold of Draco’s hands where they rested in the other boy’s lap. Draco bowed his head, his whole body shaking as his tears fell on their joined hands.
“Now, Mr. Malfoy,” Dumbledore began, steepling his fingers together as he levelled his gaze at the young man. Draco met his gaze as evenly as he could. “What is it you want to tell me?”
Harry moved his last box into his new flat, dropping it onto his unmade bed. The building was relatively new, and the flat still had that new paint smell. Harry had been pleasantly surprised to find it in the middle of Camden, where most of the buildings that claimed to be ‘new’ were from the sixties and still smelled like it. Sure, it was a little more expensive than he would like, but he had a part-time job working at the café near his old dorm, and since his scholarship covered his tuition, all he had to worry about was the living expenses. He looked around the room, nodding to himself. He would have to find a desk, and a chair, maybe a bookcase and a nightstand, but at least there was a mattress and a functioning toilet he only had to share with three other people – two girls from his course, Pansy and Padma, and a bloke named Blaise that Pansy had assured him she was not sleeping with. The kitchen had more than two hobs, and a washing machine that wouldn’t eat all of his coins. He smiled. He felt like a real adult for the first time in his life. A real adult who was starving after moving all of his belongings across London.
“Aren’t necessary, I assure you.” King Draco pushed aside his plate and settled back in his high-backed chair, studying Harry with his icy grey eyes. “You’re lucky that I find your uncouth way of speaking amusing. Did the people at Hogwarts teach you anything about manners?”
“I work here. What are you doing here?” he sneered.
“I will not say that my parents were good people,” he said, rolling his shoulders back as he began to hit his stride. The room had become deathly silent, everyone waiting on his words with bated breath. “I will not say that the three of us were on the right side of that war, because we weren’t. But we paid for those mistakes – my father with his years in Azkaban, my mother with years alone in a house that haunted her, and I through the word’s derision even as I tried to remake myself. We aren’t – weren’t – perfect, your Honour, my father least of all. His health was… not the best, at the end, and things were difficult between us, but we tried, your Honour. We tried. And despite it all, I don’t blame Mr. Weasley for what he admits to have done. But I have to ask,” he turned then to George, and from across the court room, Harry could see his eyes shining with unshed tears as he fought to maintain his neutral mask, “does anyone deserve to be killed on the morning of their son’s birthday?”
Harry chuckled and Draco grinned. “That’s fair,” Harry admitted. “But Draco’s right, you should probably tell your godmother. You don’t have to tell her right away, that’s entirely up to you. But you know that she, like us, will love and support you no matter what.”
“You shouldn’t have to forgive me,” Draco argued. “I shouldn’t have done all those things in the first place.”
“I really know how to choose them, don’t I?” he asked his cat. Scorpius looked up from his breakfast to blink his green and amber eyes at him, as if to say, ‘Obviously’. A large fluffy brown tabby that Draco suspected was part Maine Coon, part Kneazle, Scorpius never warmed up to any of Draco’s partners. He once joked to Pansy that Scorpius had better taste in men than he did. Pansy had only shaken her head pityingly. She had her own theories as to why Draco’s partners never lasted long, and it had nothing to do with his judgemental cat.
“That’s home,” he said.
Harry was fascinated.
But then Draco was there, beaming at him. “You came!” he said, rushing towards him. Harry couldn’t help the smile that stretched across his face.
“Ginny? Oh, no, they broke up last year or something, never even got to the altar. Skeeter tried to do a whole exposé on it, but Potter had it pulled, something about compromising their privacy and everything. Minnie told me all about it.” Minnie, Pansy’s girlfriend, was a news correspondent for the
“Malfoy. Have you met you? I knew you were gay before I knew what gay was.”
to hurt you, all three of you.” Harry squeezed his hand. Draco lowered his head to look at their joined hands, chewing his lip and tracing the scar on the back of Harry’s hand with his fingertip –
“You know,” Ron said, rubbing at his nose, “Ginny’s not up there bawling her eyes out over this.” He pointed up at the ceiling where indeed no sound could be heard besides the ghoul in the attic. “She’s having lunch with Hermione in our house right now while we’re talking. She knew you two would be dropping by, and yeah, she’s pretty cut up about the whole thing, but I’ll be honest with you, she’s relieved too. They both knew they were struggling, but they’re both too bloody stubborn to do anything about it. I think they thought that getting married would save their relationship, that it was the only way to fix things. This just gave them the universe’s blessing to finally end it.” He rolled forward, setting the chair back onto all four legs as he braced his arms on the table. “Listen. What I’m trying to say is – it’s okay. It’ll take some time for people to get used to the idea, that’s all. “
Ginny remained unconvinced. She crossed her arms across her chest, her frown deepening as she glared at Harry. Maybe Harry had built up a tolerance for Ginny’s glares, because he only flinched slightly, while Draco had to resist the urge to crawl under the kitchen table.
Harry squeezed his hand. “Yeah,” he admitted, “I’m going to Hogwarts. They need a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, and I thought I’d give it a go. But I don’t leave until the last week of August, and I still need to sell my place, and Hermione and Ron are going to start trying to have kids soon – it’s not like I’m leaving forever. Hey.” He lifted Draco’s chin with two fingers, making him look him in the eye. “Tell me. What’s going on in that head of yours?”
Draco was flabbergasted. “How dare you bet on my love life!” he shouted. But Pansy just waved him off. She turned on her heel and strutted towards the bathroom, discarding the bathrobe as she went. Draco immediately swivelled away and covered his eyes with his hands. “Fuck, Pans! You want to blind me?”
“Oh.” Harry was glad it was dark so Draco couldn’t seem him blush. Based on Draco’s smug smirk, however, he saw it anyway. But then Draco was pushing up the hem of Harry’s jumper, and Harry was pulling it off, tossing it next to his glasses and Draco’s wand on the bench. Then he was unbuttoning Draco’s shirt with fumbling fingers, and Draco, grinning and trying not to laugh, was helping him. Then, it didn’t matter if Harry was blushing, because Draco was blushing, too, and it was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen.
Harry looked down at his hand, at the forked heart and life lines on his palm. He traced the shape of them with his fingertip, trying to remember Luna’s words from that night. “Your lives were connected,” he said at last. “Our lives. Maybe that’s why you’re here. There’s no Draco Malfoy here, in this world, besides you. Maybe this is the universe’s way of reconnecting us.” He glanced at Draco through his thick black lashes, his heart pounding at his sternum as he tried to gauge Draco’s reaction. Draco opened his mouth, closed it again. Harry continued tentatively. “People become ghosts when they have unfinished business, right? Well, maybe the unfinished business is something to do with us, with your Harry and me. Maybe something you always wanted to tell him, but never could. Something you always felt but could never do anything about.”
? Seriously?”
“No,” said Harry quickly. “I’m surprised you’d date a bloke who works for Healers United.”
“You absolute idiot!” she raged, stomping right up to where he sat on the antique sofa. “You masochistic, dick-headed arsehole!” She picked up a beaded throw cushion and began beating him over the head with it. He threw up his arms, but she only hit harder. “You bloody piece of –”
Potter made him turn back around to face him, made him look him in the eye. “I was there, Draco,” he said. Draco’s stomach clenched. “I was there, that night. Underneath the Cloak.”
They stumbled up to the bedroom like drunkards, neither willing to let the other go for long. They crashed against walls, chased each other up the stairs, left trousers and socks in their wake like snakes shedding their old skin until they were naked and exposed, reborn. When they finally tumbled onto the bed, limbs tangled and skin pressed against glorious skin, Draco managed to ask, “What do you want to do?”
Harry sighed. “You know I do,” he said. He tried to keep his voice level as he continued, “But you also know that this isn’t going to make you less upset.”
“It’s an improvement,” he replied coolly.
Charlie laughed good-naturedly. “And proud of it,” he said. “I’ve gotten enough to deal with rescuing dragons to settle down.”
“You’re serious?” Draco asked, surprised.
“That’s what I said,” Draco piped up. Hermione only glared at him. Harry, on the other hand, shuffled closer to brush his shoulder against Draco’s, a wordless ‘thank you’. Draco reached over and held Harry’s hand, giving it a small squeeze.
Harry shook his head with a gentle smile. He fished out the charmed cuffs from the pocket of his cloak, but before he put them on Malfoy’s bony wrists, he paused, a strange light in his green eyes. “Would you?” he asked. “Try to overpower me, that is. Make a run for it.”
“Okay. Can you tell me where you are?”
Draco, poised over a simmering cauldron, pipette in hand, only raised an eyebrow as he extracted some of the potion from the cauldron before releasing it into a test tube filled with a clear solution. The liquid in the test tube immediately began to bubble and turn a nauseous green, emitting a foul-smelling smoke. Draco frowned. “What else do you want, Potter?” he asked before making a note on the case file beside the cauldron. Potter’s brows were furrowed in confusion when he finally did look up.
Harry was grinning at him. He wore a leather jacket over a maroon button-down, black jeans tucked into black boots, his Auror robes draped over his arm. Standing there, looking once again into those warm summer-coloured eyes, Draco realised how young they both were, how far they had come. Harry was talking. He shook his head and tried to focus on the words over the heavy beating of his heart against his ribcage.
He reached the doorway to the boy’s bathroom, ready to burst in on whatever nefarious plot Malfoy was up to. But then he heard it – sobbing. Not Moaning Myrtle’s wails, but the wretched sobs of someone who had lost everything. He opened the door, trying to make as little noise as possible, and listened.
Potter’s smile fell just a little, a strange look in his eye as he ducked his head, looking down the path. “Oh, er, no, she, er… she’s at the Burrow for, er… for a bit.” He tried to fold in on himself, as if in doing so he could fold himself out of existence. But he had grown out of the small, slight boy he had been in school, had become a man with broad shoulders and a big laugh and bright eyes, unmistakeable. Draco’s bit his lip, his chest suddenly too tight. He reached out before he could stop himself, his hand sliding up Harry’s arm to squeeze his shoulder. Harry blinked and looked up, hope mixing with surprise as his smile returned. Draco smiled back.
“That’s great, Harry!” Hermione exclaimed. Her eyes sparkled at just the mention of books. “What are you reading?”
“Ditto,” said Draco.
Later, after an awkward dinner in the dining hall where Draco sat with Harry and Ron while his friends shot daggers at him across the hall, after they returned to their room and immediately fell into Harry’s bed, after hours of passion and tenderness, they lay together, Harry tucked into Draco’s side with his head on the other boy’s chest. Draco carded his long fingers through Harry’s hair. Harry traced patterns on Draco’s chest, his fingertips skating across snow-white skin.
Harry frowned. Malfoy was making no sense at all.
. Does that make sense?”
Draco gasped softly. Since their talk the night after the hearing, they hadn’t said anything about love, tip-toeing around their feelings in favour of focusing on returning their lives to normal. But now the words were out, and Draco searched Harry’s face, his eyes wide. “Do you mean that?” he asked, his voice quiet and small.
Draco rubbed at his eyes and sat up, slumping only a little against the back of the couch. “Something must have gone wrong,” he said thickly, “because the next thing I knew I was standing in the bedroom upstairs, wandless, and, for all intents and purposes, a ghost. That first year, I learned two things: one, that people could only see me four times a year, if they saw me at all – I’m afraid I scared quite a few homeless people that year – and two, that I had somehow been sent twenty-one years into the past.
Harry watched her scuttle off to the dorms with her plate of biscuits and chocolates with a pitying look. He barely saw her these days, and even then only briefly. Truth be told, he spent more time with Draco than with her… He looked over at Draco, who was sipping his whiskey again. In the warm light of the fire, his usually sharp features were tempered, harsh lines becoming gentle curves. Draco noticed him watching and lowered his glass, holding it between his knees.
Draco scurried off to the kitchen. With a flick of his wand, he filled the kettle and set it on the stove to heat while he stood, hands braced against the kitchen sink, taking deep breaths and trying not to be sick. His shirt stuck to his back where he’d broken out in a cold sweat. Distantly, he heard Harry moving about, the creak of the floorboards as he walked around the living room. Draco counted to twenty in his head, then back down to zero.
“Well, that could have been worse,” he said. Draco snorted.
“Him?”
Harry, who had by this point finished off three ciders and was having a hard time focusing on Luna’s words, simply shrugged. Luna blinked her owlish blue eyes at him for a moment before turning back to his palm.
It all came crashing down on Draco then. Harry barely had time to gasp before Draco pulled him in for a messy kiss. The kiss grew sweet, edged though it was with desperation. Harry scraped his fingernails lightly down Draco’s back, and Draco bit at Harry’s ear, his neck, his shoulder. With each love bite, he thought,
Malfoy chuckled. “Yes, Potter,” he said with a tired smile, taking a sip of his tea. “Not much for witty repartee are you?”
in that?”
“To be fair, he was a Death Eater,” Harry mumbled. Hermione rolled her eyes while Ron scoffed, his hands back on his hips.
“You should at least have mentioned it in the report card – oh, he’s five years old, likes custard creams, is allergic to cats and
Teddy nodded. His bubble gum pink hair turned slightly neon. “I haven’t told Victoire yet,” he said.
“Because I don’t trust the ferret not to hurt him,” he admitted. Hermione gave him a despairing smile.
“Now you know what it was like for me all those years.”
“Alright!” Hermione shouted, waving her hands in front of her face as if to erase the image from her mind. “That’s enough from both of you. Jesus, I don’t even
“Since the Battle, since the war, since, well, everything that’s happened, people have been either tiptoeing around me like I’m about to have a breakdown, or treating me like I’m some sort of messiah. I’ve missed the challenge,” he admitted. “It’s not fun with anyone else, though. I’ve just missed…” Potter seemed to realise what he was saying the same moment Draco did. His copper cheeks flared and he began to walk a little faster. Draco, meanwhile, broke into a wide grin.
“I wasn’t talking about the Mark, Draco.”
“I think so.”
“Really?” Harry asked, his voice barely above a whisper. “This didn’t mean anything?”
“Oh, actually, I was just going to say,” Harry said, distracted in his search from the glasses and turning his attention back to Draco, “I might go over and see them in hospital, so I might be late for dinner tonight. Do you want me to just meet you at the restaurant?”
and he would forgive him. He sighed and stepped aside to let Harry in. “I will throw you out if you’re explanation is shit,” he told Harry as he came inside.
“Looks like I’m going to have to take another shower. Join me this time?”
“Harry? You alright?” he asked cautiously. Harry didn’t look at him as he shrugged. Draco sat down next to him, eyeing the destruction around him. There were several cracks in the walls. The lightbulb in the lamp by the armchair had burst. Draco leaned back on his hands with a low whistle. “Circe’s pigs, Potter, I’m glad you didn’t do this at the café or I would have had a lot to explain to my manager.”
“You did! You promised it would end badly!”
Once on the train, it wasn’t hard to find an empty compartment. He put his luggage away and sat down, settling into his book. He had wiled away almost a full chapter as the train steadily filled, the growing chatter of students filtering down the hall, when his compartment door opened.
They were definitely friends before they became co-workers, although seeing each other almost every day at work only deepened their friendship to the point that when Draco yelled at Potter for putting his dirty boots on his desk, Potter only laughed and ate his lunch with the smug knowledge that all Draco would do was grumble about dirt on his paperwork. Oh, yes, they were friends. Except when Potter talked about his fiancée.
Harry sunk a little in his seat to avoid getting caught in the crossfire. Draco’s shoulders tensed.
Harry tells Ron about Draco. Things do not go so well.
“Bastard? Was that what you were going to say?” the king sneered.
Draco hated himself for it, but he said it anyway. “Did you say the same thing to Ginevra when you fought?”
“Fine.”
Harry pushed his barely eaten food away, his stomach churning. “I don’t even know what we are, to be honest,” he muttered. “I have to get to class. See you at dinner.”
Malfoy harrumphed. “Well, don’t expect me to cover your coffee. I expected a show and got nothing. Pretty pathetic if you ask me.”
“Do what?” Draco asked, stubbornness bordering on petulance.
Draco lowered his hand from his mouth, his lip trembling. “I love you, too,” he said, his voice thick with tears and years of longing.
“Come here,” he murmured, before gathering Draco into his arms. Draco buried his face in Harry’s scarlet Auror robes, his hands gathering fistfuls of the fabric to hold himself up. Harry smelled of masala, but Draco didn’t mind, too busy letting all of Harry’s emotions wash over him, as he knew his were washing over Harry, waves crashing against the rocks of their bodies.
“I know,” he intoned. “But it’s good to hear you say it. Means I succeeded.”
Harry nodded. He pursed his lips as he considered Draco’s words. “Did you ever like someone else?”
“It is,” Harry said firmly. “A bit small in places, but if you had seven children, I’m sure even a place like Malfoy Manor would feel small.”
Harry shook his head, lips twisting as he rolled the memory through his head.
is necessary, I have his wand and he’s not going to try and run for it.”
“Hell no, I love it. Wait.” His eye caught another flash of ink. He turned Draco’s arm over, expecting the Mark. Instead, there was a bouquet of flowers, narcissus, lilies and irises blooming across the faded skull and serpent. Harry’s breath caught in his throat. He traced the flowers with his fingers. Draco’s eyes fluttered closed at the gentle touch, only to open again with a gasp as lips replaced fingers and he looked down to see Harry kissing each and every flower, so sweetly and tenderly that he felt tears prick at his eyes. Harry looked up at him, his breath ghosting across Draco’s skin.
“Could you, er, could you face me when you talk?” Kellen piped up. Malfoy turned back to her, one eyebrow raised. She pointed at her ear. “I’m Deaf and my hearing aids aren’t the greatest at picking up every word.”
“Professor?” he asked. “Is everything alright?”
“Sirius? And Remus?” Harry demanded, his voice hoarse. “They were soulmates?”
“Precisely. So why was Auror Weasley shouting to high heaven about your dating life for everyone from my office to the Department of Mysteries to hear?”
“Shush, you. That knowledge goes with you to the grave.”
“Your spells indicated that no one’s here. So did the team that did a sweep before we got here. There’s no point going room to room, if you ask me.”
Harry leaned back, biting his lip as he looked away. His gaze landed on the Sorting Hat, sitting silently on its perch, and he let out a quiet laugh.
“Of course he does,” she said under her breath. “We all do. But I will say, he seems…quiet.” She glanced over her shoulder to where Malfoy hung at the back of the group of eighth years, his hands in his pockets and his eyes focused on the ground beneath his feet. Hermione frowned and turned back. “I will say,” she murmured, “I think he has changed. Hopefully for the better. Only time will tell.”
Draco’s lips twitched, a hint of a smirk. “You can try,” he said. “But no promises.”
“Mrs. Weasley would love a space like this,” he said admiringly.
Draco shook his head and ran a hand through his mussed up hair. “Jesus, I had no idea,” he whispered to himself. “God, what a dick I’ve been… all that time I made fun of you for being poor, I had no idea….”
. Pureblood supremacists. They condoned
Draco just had to accept that his blush wasn’t going away. “Er, s-sure,” he stammered. “I wouldn’t want to impose though, if Ginevra’s home…” He and Ginny were never really able to see eye to eye, and their encounters were stand-offish at best. Besides, the last thing he wanted was to get in the middle of one of Potter and Ginny’s spectacular fights.
did… all those years of him in my head….” He shook his head, rubbing at his scar absent-mindedly. Draco frowned.
“Oh.” Hermione and Ron shared a confused look. “Is that it?” Hermione asked.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Yes, I think it will,” he said, uncertain. “It just… feels like you.”
“Truth or dare?”
“Oh, I’ll show you how much I liked it,” Draco assured him, his eyes glinting mischievously. But then he sobered up, and took the hand holding his chin in his. “There’s one other thing,” he said, “we should probably talk about.” He stretched out his left arm, revealing the Dark Mark staining the skin of his forearm. Harry looked away, trying to swallow past the lump forming in his throat at the sight. Draco sighed. “I knew it,” he said under his breath. “You still can’t stand that part of me, can you? Even after all this time.”
“I’m sorry, I just – ”
“No, no, Draco, that’s not – ” Harry fumbled with his words, not knowing how to explain, what to explain. Draco was moving further and further away from Harry and he reached out, trying to grab hold of Draco’s arms, his knee, anything. But Draco was shaking his head.
Later that night, after the feast and long after everyone had sloped off to bed, a small origami crane flew into Harry’s four-poster and landed on his chest. Harry sat up, picking the crane up and unfolding it as he reached blindly for his glasses and wand. Glasses on and wand in hand, he shut the curtains before casting a soft
While Harry put the kettle on to boil, Draco opened cupboards until he found the mugs, picking out the bright orange Chudley Cannon one for Harry and a pristine china cup for himself. He plopped tea bags into each and turned away from the counter to set them on the table. The sight that greeted him almost made him drop the mugs.
He was thirteen – the hippogriff scars faded quicker than he thought, but he played up the pain, loving the attention it got him, wishing for someone else to notice and hating himself for it.
They were silent for a long while as they stared after her. Harry picked up her ring and held it cradled in his palm. Draco couldn’t bear to see the tears welling up in his sweet green eyes, so he turned to Hermione instead.
Stinging Hex aside, he looked nothing like the scrawny teenager kneeling on the Manor’s drawing room floor almost a year ago. No longer on the run, his cheeks had gone from gaunt and hollow to full and ruddy from the sharp wind outside. His stubble was a dark shadow outlining his strong jaw and full lips. His glasses were still dirty and smudged, his black hair still wild and curly, and the lightning shaped scar still stood out silver against his coffee-coloured skin. But this was no boy across from him anymore.
“Why didn’t you tell me he’s a Metamorphmagus?” Draco demanded.
Draco tried his best to make the lie sound true – “Yes.” But the word still fell flat in the charged air between them. Harry looked away, biting his lower lip.
“Fine,” he said. “I’m sorry too, Mother.”
“I think you’re lying,” Harry said huskily. He brought his hands onto Draco’s thighs, giving them a gentle squeeze through the thin fabric of his trousers. Draco reminded himself to breathe. Harry’s hands rubbed up and down his thighs, his thumbs dragging deliciously along his inseam. His gaze flickered between Draco’s grey eyes to his pink lips as he licked his own lips. “I think you do like what you see. Quite a bit, if I’m not mistaken.”
Oh. Harry’s heart stuttered to a halt. He wrapped his arms around Draco’s neck, pressing up onto his toes to kiss him back. Oh. This was happening. He nibbled Draco’s lip and he gasped, letting Harry in, deepening the kiss with a moan. Oh. Draco’s body was warm against his, all lean muscle and bone, filling Harry’s senses with the smell of peppermint and expensive cotton. He let go and drowned himself in Draco.
“Godson,” Harry clarified. “I have him whenever Andromeda needs a break, which just so happened to be this weekend.”
“I knew I couldn’t stay in the Shack, but the
“You’re like a dog,” Draco murmured. “Or a cat.”
“Oh, I’m sorry, your Highness, by all means, call away,” Harry retorted. “I’m not the one who’s been lounging about a palace for the past twenty hundred years.”
“I didn’t – Circe’s tits, Mother!”
The hand resumed rubbing his back.
“It’s the Invisibility Cloak,” Remus explained. He got up from his seat beside his partner and came over to where Harry stood on the hearth rug. “See?” He pulled the fabric away, revealing a sliver of Harry’s tunic beneath. “Anyone who wears it cannot be seen – not by eye, not by magic, not even, it is said, by Death herself. Your father left it with us when he first heard of Voldemort’s plan to track down the Hallowed Trinity, just before he fled with your mother to Ængla. It is time you had it.” He placed his hands on Harry’s shoulders then, his guess of where Harry’s shoulders would be proving eerily accurate, and looked him in the eye, his expression serious. There were lines at the corners of Remus’s mouth, silver at his temples. Harry was struck, suddenly, with the knowledge that these two men were getting older. Death did not call for them yet, but one day, she would. And Harry would not be able to save them.
He turned. Tonks had stepped out of the way, and Malfoy stood in the doorway, holding out the Cloak with a guarded expression. “I wouldn’t forget this if I were you,” he said carefully, his grey eyes boring into Harry. “Could be useful, later.”
