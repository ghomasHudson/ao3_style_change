“Of course, I didn’t expect any less.” Hermione placed her hand into her cheek and sighed.
“Fascinating,” said Harry, still looking at the books. “How you turn the doors into books?”
“I’m quite happy just rolling out of bed and putting on clothes,” said Rosier. “Spells and hair products are too much effort when I look good with messy hair.”
Harry woke up with the sun beaming down on his face, the blinds were raised and the curtains pushed aside, allowing a thin beam of sunlight to break through into his normally pitch-black bedroom. Ignoring everything as he got out of bed, groaning, and grabbed a handful of clothes. He may have stumbled on a piece of furniture once or twice before he managed to escape his bedroom. He had forgotten the socks, as he usually did, and muttered under his breath.
“That’s not fair,” said Fleur. “That means…”
Harry frowned and pushing his eyebrows together in deep thought, “off my what?”
“So, what’s the latest gossip?” said Harry, chuckling. “The ghosts have been quiet.”
“That could work,” said Miles. “It’d be even easier of the weather was bad.”
He took the letter from the owl’s leg and watched as it hooted at him and then took flight back up the small pipe. He held the letter in his hands for a moment before sighing and dragging his feet towards the nearby desk, hoping that the letter was at least small and not an essay on small things that he didn’t care about.
“Would someone not inviting bring you food?” said the man, pulling out a nicely packed package from his pocket. “I made certain that it was in a sealed container and that said container was durable.”
“Don’t talk to him like that!”
Harry said nothing, he just sat there in silence, both his hands on the table.
Harry turned his head and studied his friend. “They?” he questioned. “Are you not a part of the team as well? I am certain you should be using ‘we’.”
“Well,” said Harry, scratching his head, “not really –”
“What if he doesn’t want me there,” said Harry. “Maybe he’s tired of me acting like a protector and saving him all the time.”
“The rumour mill has it that you’re a potions prodigy,” said Ernie lightly, his eyes locked onto Justin. “Some have even gone as far as to say that you’re Professor Snape under Polyjuice.”
Every single Slytherin had been swayed by him or Draco and agreed that it was time for Nott to go. More people had come simply to overthrow Nott, as was the Slytherin way. It hardly mattered to them if Nott was a student in his third year or whether he was Head Boy. Slytherin students needed to be at the top of that list that everyone seemed to forget about until something provoked it.
Harry soon realised that Marcus had done his daily dose of speaking plus some extra in the lessons and that his answers were slowly sho0rtening and he was getting grunts instead of worded replies. He did wonder if Marcus would stick with his promise and actually teach him anything during their small lessons, especially with the fact that he picked up things quicker than Marcus did. Not to mention that he would be teaching the son of the Head Auror, which to most would be like snapping their wand and just walking into Azkaban. He’d never break the deal, of course, as it’d ruin him in Slytherin and he’d never give James the satisfaction of being right.
“What do you think I got, mother?” Harry asked, smiling. “Oh, and I missed you too.”
“Anybody who desires to submit themselves as champion must write their name and school in full as clearly as they can on upon a piece of blank parchment, and drop it into the Goblet,” said Dumbledore, glancing around the Great Hall. “You cannot fool the Goblet. It is an ancient magical device that has thousands of years of history and attempts. It is immune to all kinds of magical tampering known to wizardkind. The consequences of doing so are most dire. The last person who attempted as much was left unable to speak.
‘Don’t mock me, Thomas,’ thought Harry, glaring as he weaved around a post box. ‘You’re simply irrelevant.’
“Don’t you dare blame Nagini either, she spent the entire day with me. Never once leaving my sight.”
“Can I fight that incompetent goblin that escorted us in?”
“I know, I was being stupid.”
“Alright,” said Harry. He stood up and gently tucked the chair into the table and then walked over and stood near his trunk. “I really wish you wouldn’t call me Harrison… I don’t like it.”
He watched as blood slowly dribbled down her chin and drip onto her already blood-stained robes. She was bleeding from her nose, mouth, and the various nail marks he had left on her cheeks when he gripped her face in anger.
“I don’t understand what that language is, or what it even means,” said Dudley slowly, watching his cousin glance out the window as if he was a crazy villain from one of the television shows he had watched.
have an idea.”
Harry watched the group of people as they joked around, traded small banter, and made obvious jokes in different languages. He had not seen the girl, so he had assumed it had been a group of young men that were misbehaving, but the more time he spent with them, the obvious it came that they had no idea what was going on. He glanced back towards Clara, who had just whipped the large man with her ponytail, which caused a serious bout of laughter.
“Here he is, we were –”
“Yeah, yeah.”
“So what do we do?”
“Amusing,” muttered Harry, attempting a glare.
“Oh.”
Harry would master this spell with ease and achieve something no other student has ever done. “And what does a Patronus look like?” he asked with a curious glance. “Can you cast a Patronus?”
“Zabini, Blaise!” called Professor McGonagall.
“Speaking of Uncle David, he’s going to the boy now.”
Harry quickly smelled himself one last time before walking out with Draco, Pansy and Blaise, he smelt like vanilla, he smelt nice. Harry walked alongside them until he was stopped at the Great Hall doors.
Draco scowled, not able to imagine Harry being cute, of all things. Harry wasn’t cute, he was… something else that he was unable to describe. “I don’t think Harry’d appreciate being called cute, mother. I’m sure he’d scowl at us and retreat to the library and spend all day brooding with his books.”
“It works wonders,” said Narcissa, shifting one of her pieces forwards. “Assuming the other player is overwhelmed by the sheer force of the attack that they panic and move their pieces wrong and then Harry takes advantage of that and the match is over in no less than twenty moves.”
,” said George. “Sent to detention with Filch, if you’d believe that. The best part is that no one cleaned up the soap so Filch left us in his office all alone. We behaved for a good two minutes before we realised that he would be gone awhile and we took that time to rummage and see what he had confiscated.”
“Where are we going?”
He gave up trying to be neat in his searching, instead he began to tear through everything, not using magic in case a professor comes and notices it. He hurled clothes, quills, parchments and inkpots across the room, but placed the books aside carefully, even if they were Weasley’s book, they were still books. He let out a long winded sigh and knelt back down once more in front of Longbottom’s trunk, he gently opened it and what he saw was what he was looking for, the little black book, very similar to his. His fingers gently ran over the cover and he grabbed it, tucking it under his robes. He closed the trunk and heard someone rushing up the stairs. He froze and edged backwards, standing near Finnigan’s bed.
What happened wasn’t what he expected.
Of course, when he asked what the point of self-cleaning tiles were, knowing that almost every witch and wizard could flick their wand, mutter a word, and clean the entire corridor in less effort, he was stared at like an extinct animal. A potion did not need a meticulously cleaned room like Muggles needed. It simply made very little sense.
“I never noticed that before,” Draco said sounding annoyed.
Ron met up with Hermione and caught Draco stumbling to class, “Dr-Malfoy, what are you doing?” Hermione called out.
“And you, Mr. Potter?”
“You’re bickering,” he said as he gave a pointed look. “If you keep it up, I’m gonna go and sit back on my rock and consider sneaking off again.”
“Please, call me Nicolas,” said Nicolas. “I’ll ask you three things, just three and then you may request what you want. Is that fine with you?
“Defence Against the Dark Arts.”
“It would be futile to get anything from Harry,” said Severus. “It may be wise to get James here now, so that we can discuss a few things.”
Draco shook Harry awake, “time to go, and stop sleeping else you won’t sleep tonight!”
“Yet again, Cornelius, I tell you that taking Hagrid away will not help in the slightest,” said Dumbledore. His blue eyes were full of a fire most had never seen before.
The four of them watched as the three-headed dog’s eyes, all six of them, began to droop. Slowly, the dog’s growls ceased – it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.
“The Headmaster can tell when Glamour Charms have been used,” said Harry. “Every professor can, they’re not hard to detect. I’ve also been into Gringotts, which instantly vanishes spells and enchantments on you. Your theory is flawed, as is everything else you idiots spout from your mouths.”
“Honestly, I thought it was coming from you,” said Neville, looking ashamed. “It seemed to happen every time you glanced at me.”
“Nagini’s female,” said Harry, cradling said snake protectively.
“I was just informing you that you were wrong.”
“I’ll have a look later,” said Harry. “I promise I won’t touch anything.”
“I thought you were nice,” said Hermione, wiping at tears that formed in her eyes. “How can you be so mean?”
“I swear I answered that…” muttered Harry, trailing off as he tilted his head slightly. “I don’t really care about Quidditch, honestly. I was on the Quidditch team at Hogwarts, being the youngest Seeker in a century before Longbottom decided to usurp me and attempt to take the title from me. Ever since, I never really enjoyed it. I’m the Captain for the team now, but I no longer play.”
“Wow,” said Harry simply. “It’s good that his mother allowed him to stay, we need to hone and train our magical skills… an untrained wizard is more deadly than a trained one.”
“Geh!” said Pyotr, tilting his head comically. “We two have never spoken.”
Draco watched as accusations flied between both, of course he knew that Harry was leaving his bed at night, but assumed it was to go to the bathroom. Honestly, he didn’t follow Harry like a dog. Of course it was now the fourth night here and if Harry had already stolen things than he was in a world of trouble. “I hate to interrupt, but why am I here?” He flinched when they both turned to him.
“As you already know, your father works closely with Albus, looking at the Auror Department and using that to branch into the Ministry with a tight-knit group of witches and wizards that detest the Dark Arts. However, Albus is almost certain the Dark Lord is back and has been since early last year.”
He smiled and turned back to his mother whom had just emerged from Flourish and Blotts and was now standing directly behind him, looking at the pure white owl in the cage.
Harry walked swiftly up to the high table and smiled, “is it alright if we go now Dumbledore?”
“You got him something?”
“I’m not sure if you’re apologising for assuming I was evil, or that I’d throw you aside to get free, or because you expect me to still do this.”
“No?” repeated Harry. “What do you mean, ‘no’? You cannot just start to claim something about me, pause dramatically and then say no.”
“Well –”
“I trusted in the wards that the previous Malfoy family members had added, as well as the small touch-ups that Professor Snape and your father did,” said Harry, shrugging it off with ease. “It worked every time that it was tested and seemed to know when danger was coming before any of us did.”
It wasn’t enough that his next gnome had gone thirty-seven feet, beating Ron Weasley’s record, but he had to throw it further, beating everyone’s record.
“She’ll want a rematch.”
Neville, who was sending Harry curious looks, was startled and stared at Wood in disbelief. “It’s not our fault that you’re not blocking the shots.”
“I did not!” said Harry. “You joined on your own free will and now you’re turning that choice onto me for some odd reason. I never took away any decision that you could have made! You could have said no.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “That makes no sense,” he muttered. “And my future will be bleak? How detailed and in-depth. Everyone’s future is going to be bleak at some point, no matter what you do or try.”
He knew full well that speaking Parseltongue in the middle of an open corridor was very different to speaking it inside the Slytherin common room, where it was somewhat safe and secure. Sure, both of them would have awful consequences if caught, but he was certain most Slytherins would take it better than any of the other houses.
“– attacks on Muggle-born students, Dementors attacking the train… clearly the standards of this school continue to fall,” said Lucius Malfoy. “I needn’t bother with claiming that last year two students were kidnapped and almost killed while you did nothing about it besides ignore it. Surely a wizard of your… calibre would be able to handle a few stray situations such as this?”
Harry
Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he sent them. Neville’s knees were trembling. What if they lost?
“Just ignore him, Percy,” said Neville, glaring. “He’s only doing it to annoy you.”
Harry groaned and ignored Draco, who continued to rave on about rather embarrassing memories. He sat down at the table and instantly picked up two pieces of toast, which were quickly covered in butter and he happily bit into them, the butter dripping down his chin. “Merlin, the toast is amazing!”
Harry shifted the piece of toast over a plate and watched as the buttered from it and landed onto the plate. “I think that I learned a lesson today. And that’s to not put so much butter on my toast.”
“Back in my day, the heir to the Most Noble House of Malfoy would never act like this, not even dressed at ten in the morning. Disgraceful.”
Such as our lives.
“Does it matter?”
Miles stood still for a second. “Did you really have to say you don’t care so many times?” he asked with a sigh and a muttered thank you. I’m just going to go and speak to my brother, I think.”
“Your mother isn’t well, Harry –”
,’ said Tom. ‘
The man smiled and nodded slightly. “Many people fear the unknown, child, whether it’s death and comes after, Gods, or anything that cannot be explained by their pitiful minds. Many fear immortality as it can upset the balance. People tend to think that fate exists and that it’s a living person that stalks through the world, hoping to find anyone ruining her plans – stupidity at its finest. Legends say that Death himself was once a wizard who sought immortality, and succeeded, but was cursed into being alive, but dead at the same time – death, in all aspects.”
“You don’t need to worry about your pets, she won’t touch them, he knows better than that. Now excuse me, but I need to sleep.”
Eventually in all came down to the fact that first-year Slytherins should never walk around the castle alone, as other houses, even if they are years older, will attack a lone Slytherin. It was asinine to learn that a fifth-year would openly attack an eleven year old who was only just making an appearance. IN most sense, he would be safe as his father would have anyone’s head if they dared attack him over something simple as a house, but then again, his father was highly bias of Slytherin house. Someone was killed? A Slytherin did it. An attack on Muggles? Must have been a Slytherin.
Draco shot Harry an excited glance and the two slowly walked towards the front gate, it gently opened and the two walked down the crumbled path, the path was surprisingly empty and the breeze was cool.
“Make Granger cry.”
“– rather sensible to stop now, before I came down hard on them,” continued Professor Lockhart, he turned and gave the students that were lurking around in the corridor a large grin, showing every one of his white teeth in the process. “You know what this this school needs? It needs some sort of a morale-booster. Wash away the memories of last term! I won’t say any more just now, but I think I know just the thing.”
“You, boy!” said Professor Trelawney, clutching the boy’s arm. “After you break my green teapot, would you be so kind to accept the white one patterned one? I’m rather fond of the other sets.”
Hagrid glanced at the three Gryffindors and sighed loudly. “Yeah – he’s mine – bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las’ year – I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the –”
“That is – it’s astonishing!” said Perenelle. “I had no idea that it was possible to do that.”
He woke up on the seventh day feeling like he could quite easily take over the world. It was such a blessing to know that things would start being solved now and there was no more waiting or standing around. He made his way to the Chamber of Secrets, a determined stride in his step. It had been a week since he last spoke to Atieno, which meant there would be news.
Draco sauntered into the room and smiled at Harry with an approving smile. “Guess what?”
“Hey!”
“Nothing,” said Harry, no way to explain that the engraving of a snake that was imbued with Salazar Slytherin’s magic was demanding that he be back before curfew and then claiming that even if he was with the protector of the nest, he should be back before curfew. “Just something I heard in passing.”
Harry looked up at his mother with a confused expression but it was quickly concealed. “I’ll have a chocolate and strawberry ice-cream with shaved chocolate sprinkled on top, please. Thank you mother.”
“You’re right Fred, which could have been an amazing sight,” Fred added.
“That boy is nothin’ but trouble. It’s what happens when there’s no man to take care of the kid.”
Atieno snorted. “I cannot even stand the mere thought of that,” he muttered. “A killer and his victim crossing some magical line that no one can see together? It makes no sense.”
Blaise flashed red, “the first time a couple try to have sex they’re instantly apparated into a room and then instructed to dress. If you’re straight and a male you’ll have a female teacher, girls have a male, unless you’re gay, then you get a male and same for lesbians.” Blaise took a deep breath and glanced at Harry, who looked mortified, “they ask you simple questions, mainly stuff you already know and then they chuck in stupid questions like ‘is male pregnancy possible?’ It’s honestly all bull-”
“How do I stop it?” he rasped. “I don’t want to become a
“Potter!”
The words repeated bitterly in his head as he stared into the soft brown eyes of Terence Higgs. It was an accident, at least he could explain that it was, but he dived into the boy’s head and began to see his most recent memory.
“Why are you so small?” asked Dudley, as he finally noticed the boy. “You look like you’re nine.”
“We’ll be fine,” said Harry. “I doubt anyone’ll even bother us in that aspect. I’ll be at Hogwarts shortly, in less than a month, with Severus, a massive amount of professors, and Dumbledore. You’ll be here, safe, with Daniel.”
Before he could get a good look at it, he was almost face-to-face with the snake, who had lifted its head to be on level with him.
Thankfully, Cornelius didn’t run and started summoning more branches and turning them silver. He copied the boy’s action and sent them at the werewolf with magic.
There was a loud ‘bang’ and when the students turned around, Professor Lupin was gone and in the watchtower that had been created for this task. He gave a wave and signalled for the students to start the course.
“That’s because Professor Snape has an absolute zero tolerance for stupidity when it comes to making potions of any sort,” said Harry, snorting. “Being one hundred percent honest, it was the first thing that I learnt when I was taught. I assumed that making potions was boring and ease at first, but that notion was quickly changed when I saw that one wrong stir could blow up an entire sitting room.”
“What the hell, Potter?” shouted Ron. “Don’t attack my sister!”
Dumbledore waved off the sarcasm and smiled at the boy. “Very recently, you said something has caused me to reflect on it constantly. You must forgive me for being curious, Mr. Potter.”
The silence continued on after that, neither of the two willing to strike up a conversation as they twisted around corridors and seemingly evaded all students in the dungeons. Only the sounds of faint breathing and footsteps echoed throughout the deserted corridors.
“Just drink it,” said Draco, packing away the chessboard. “I want to see what it does. Mother looks way too excited over there, it must be good.”
“Why?” said Draco, sighing. “You said you’re not going to enter ‘cos you don’t need it and now you are? I’m confused.”
Narcissa didn’t bother to interfere she just watched and sipped her tea, hoping Harry would harm her in one way or another, Bellatrix was no sister of Narcissa.
After that, they didn’t really have much of a chance to speak as the small group started the Mandrakes. Professor Sprout had made it look extremely easy, but it wasn’t. The Mandrakes didn’t like coming out of the earth, but didn’t seem to want to go back into it either. They squirmed, kicked, flailed their sharp little fists and gnashed their teeth; Harry spent ten whole minutes trying to squash a particularly fat one into a pot.
“You mean like how I was with the Patronus?”
“はい.”
“Are you going to become an Animagus?” said Draco, copying Harry’s notes.
“There’s not much you can do about it,” said Harry, somewhat cryptically. “It’s impossible to control another person… it’s impossible because a person will always value their own thoughts over what you want, even if they don’t show it outwards. Their thoughts will always come before yours.”
people tried to keep them secret. Hate your father if you will, he did the best thing possible by coming here. An entire alley dedicated to the ‘darkness’. There’s very few resources that I haven’t been able to get my hands on. Either way, from all the research I have done, it’s almost impossible for you to suffer anything for killing or maiming an illusion of a unicorn. The Goblet of Fire brings forth an illusion, nothing more. It cannot summon an actual living creature – no object is that powerful.”
Once he learned Asahi’s patterns, it seemed trivial to defend against him. If Tom Riddle taught him anything, it was that all spells had patterns and switching them around would either weaken them or cause undesired effects.
“Sorry Draco, Ministry calls, but I’ll be back soon, hopefully it’s only a quick visit.” Lucius gave Draco a half smile, “if Harry wakes, tell him I said thank you.”
“Something
“Good” Harry said as he walked back into the Great Hall.
He knew that this fight could go two different ways as that’s how it was worded and it only had two possible outcomes. One, Harry could be defeated and killed, which result in him being hunted down and killed by Lily, Draco, Narcissa, and then Lucius. Maybe even all of them at once. Two, Harry could win and do something no other human has clearly done before and defy history.
The morning slowly breezed into afternoon, lunch was just simple sandwiches and nothing major that people would dive over for, unlike at the Malfoy Manor, which had meals for every day meals that you’d only find at the most exquisite restaurants. The dreadful weather hadn’t vanished, instead it lurked about, pushing grey clouds over the blue sky, causing the mood to dampen slightly with the promise of future rain.
“It’s sort of assumed,” said Harry. “Also, don’t open the door so dramatically.”
The girl gave Ronald Weasley a startled look and promptly edged her chair away from him.
Dumbledore looked at Hagrid, concern in his eyes. “Hagrid,” he started, ignoring the muttering from Harry Potter. “I believe that –”
Draco landed and collapsed in the Great Hall, with various students looking at him, and Snape rushing to take him to the infirmary, there were various whispers and mutters about where he came from and a few rumours spread instantly that Malfoy was stronger than he actually let off; Snape muttered under his breath and carried Draco. Draco regained his strength midway.
“Force it to listen to you,” said Draco, placing his book back into the slot on the wall. “Just stun it or wrap a belt around it, like everyone else has done.”
“It’s not just
This wasn’t all, of course it wasn’t.
“No wonder she hasn’t got any friends!”
“Are you gonna enter?”
The first thing that he noticed was that every single bed in the dormitory was vacated and left mess, as if they rolled out of bed after a night of tossing and turning. He spied Draco and Theodore sitting off to the side, whispering, fully clothed.
He hissed the password to enter the Slytherin common room, making sure his voice did not carry, and quickly entered, watching as the wall closed behind him.
“I hate to make you upset, but I do need one of them as it was listed as a required book.”
“He’s not bad in the term that you’re implying, Ron, just a bad teacher.”
“Your mum is right, Harry,” added James. “It’s a once in a lifetime experience.”
Who would’ve expected Professor Quirrell to be a host to Voldemort? It just seemed so unlikely that you would have been thrown in St Mungo’s Hospital for even daring to suggest such a thing. As for the supposed defences, anyone with half a mind knew they were nothing more than a decoy, a sense of easiness. They were a carefully devised trap. The Headmaster was cunning. He would give him that.
Professor Lupin shook his head. “Mr. Goyle! Step forwards please.”
“Harry, please…”
“Irrelevant,” said Harry. “I missed you Draco –”
“‘Typical arrogant attitude’?”
“A straggler?” said the hat, sounding slightly annoyed. “She founded the group, Mr. Potter. It’s debated that it was Salazar who founded the school, alongside his old friend, Godric, but it’s false. It was Helga, wanting to help as much people as she could in the harsh times.”
“Thanks,” muttered Harry, standing still as the tie was wrapped around his neck and quickly tightened.
Harry stared at his mother for the briefest of moments before he nodded. He wanted to laugh at the barb at James, even when said man didn’t bother to defend his pride and etiquette, which was actually decent when warranted, not that he would ever admit that out loud. He decided that it was best if he just sat silent and allowed his mother to explain ‘what’s going on’ as she put it.
He figured that the Ministry – the one in the United Kingdom – was most likely figuring out a way to go back in time to stop the Dark Lord before he became a dark lord. Most of Europe debated the idea with Grindelwald yet were thwarted by internal sabotage and never recovered anything of note to resume their studies.
“Not only that,” Fred said quickly.
Hermione shook her head and allowed the two boys to converse as they walked up the staircases and towards the room that the Deathday Party would be held in. She couldn’t grasp the fact that the black-haired boy thought that knowledge was power. It was so similar to a phrase that were said in war, just alter to fit his purpose. She had no idea why a twelve year old would have a quote that reflects power.
“Watch out –”
Ginny sat down next to Hermione. “Hello Hermione, how are you?” She looked at Ron and just mumbled something, after what appeared to be silence she decided to ask another question. “What are you two reading?”
“The first challenge is a test of durability and resolve,” said the voice. “The winner will receive a great boon going into the second challenge… the loser will receive nothing and will be unable to research for the second challenge. They will also suffer greatly. Are there any questions?”
“Running from a duel, Weasley?” Draco paused, “father was right; your family really is a disgrace.”
“Dragon Pox?”
“What’re you doin’ here?” said Hagrid furiously. “Get outta my house!”
“That will not be required, Mr. Potter,” said Dumbledore calmly, while gesturing Ron into the vacant seat. “I’m sure you will have adequate time while in class to learn the spell, after all, Professor Flitwick is highly skilled in the art of Charms.”
Harry knew that was Draco, the huff that came after was definitely all Draco. He glanced towards Draco with a small smile, noting that the boy had shoved aside his plate and was staring between him and Weasley.
“Yes you are!” said Draco. “The heir of Slytherin may only seek to attack Muggle-born students but your mother is one and it may not know the difference! If it was ordered to petrify you then it may not hesitate! The monster may attack you –”
This could have been split into two chapters...
“Not a bad turnout,” said Nicholas, mainly to himself. “The Wailing Widow came all the way up from Kent!”
Dumbledore, Snape, McGonagall and Lucius walked in to see the Harry knelt over a shirtless Draco. Harry had his hand son Draco’s chest and was muttering something. Draco’s eyes stayed on Harry the entire time, like Harry was his lifeline.
“Thank you, Rosier.”
Draco paused mid step before continuing as if he never stopped. “I think they start on the fourteenth and go through until the twentieth of June, I’m not too sure. An announcement will be made shortly I assume. We get the results back a few days before the term ends.”
Spinning on the spot, he made his way back towards the Leaky Cauldron, wanting to venture out into Muggle London, hoping to find something entertaining there. He blamed the Dursleys for showing him that Muggles could be interesting, even if it was their stupidity that provided entertainment.
“How about the other boys? Crabbe and Goyle.”
He, along with the other Slytherins, began to take the course. They were seemingly satisfied with the lack of screams and shouts from the other students. It had nothing to do with stereotypes on the Houses, more like pure-blood children being raised by paranoid parents that demanded their children remain safe and cautious. However, with the previous three years at the school having something happen, no one was going to rush into a course that could spell the end of them.
“You cannot do that, others need this book!” whispered Hermione towards the Slytherin. “Professor Dumbledore will back us up if we need it.”
“I was hoping that I would, that way I can scour your library and try and get into your father’s study so I can take a peek at his rare tomes. But, I have a feeling that I won’t be able to.”
He sat in a nearby chair and waited for Madam Malkin to appear and give him the robes that he needed, hopefully without a conversation. He caught Longbottom out of the corner of his eye and watched the boy get stuck on something and nearly trip face first into the floor. He had hoped and prayed that Longbottom wouldn’t be accepted at Hogwarts, but his pleas were not heard and the boy was accepted, with the largest ever interview done between reporters, the Boy Who Lived and the professors of Hogwarts.
!” repeated the portrait.
“Oh, do be silent you wretch,” said the woman, hissing. “They dislike you
“Yes!” said Harry, nodding. “Go on, Draco, I won’t be too far behind.”
“What’s that got to do with the Tournament?”
Harry noticed they were close to Florean Fortescue's, Harry decided about asking if they could stop for five minutes and get an ice-cream or not.
“No, it isn’t.”
“You promised me that you’d let me go on one of your adventures sometime,” said Draco, speaking evenly. “You promise and promise and you do all these cool things, saving villages and whatnot and I’m never there. I know you don’t get into them on purpose, but even when we were younger you got me to safety and then went exploring as if I needed to be protected. I don’t need to be, you know. I’ve wanted to explore with you, seeing all the cool and interesting things you see. You know so many things that you’ve probably learned from just exploring that I’ve missed out on. I’m not angry or annoyed, I’m not even upset or anything.”
Firenze slowed to a walk and warned Neville to keep his head bowed in case of low-hanging branches but did not answer Neville’s question. They made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Neville thought Firenze didn’t want to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped. “Neville Longbottom, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?”
“I never attended the prestigious school and because of that, I feel as if I should make up a version of my own using the knowledge of other people.”
“Most likely because that name, whether it’s his proper name or not, is reserved for only his mother,” said Cedric, caving in and sitting on a tree trunk. “Sort of like how only your mother may call you Ernest.”
“Never leave another Slytherin behind or in danger, if you can help it. Self-preservation is a very valuable trait, and I would hate to see any of you lack it and do something foolish such as diving into a situation, like a Gryffindor, and getting yourself killed. But that does not mean you should leave another Slytherin to suffer the fate that could have been you.”
“Now, don’t be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess,” said Ron.
“But…” started Neville before trailing off on whatever thought he was going to suggest. He wasn’t exactly sure how to explain his need to save Harry, it was like some sort of brotherly instinct to save the boy, despite the fact they weren’t related. It could also be because of Lily and James, not wanting either of them to feel bad about their son being injured. Draco Malfoy, despite the animosity between them, was another that he wanted to save Harry for. The blond boy looked absolutely crushed without Harry around, like his entire world had been flipped and he was now poor and had no money. It was a bad comparison, but he couldn’t think that Malfoy would look so distraught if you kicked his puppy.
“This is so ridiculous!” huffed Draco in anger. He dropped onto the bench with an annoyed sound. “This is what happens when a little girl is the sole heir of a family. She is the reason why younger people cannot inherit anything family related.”
A first-year went blue in the face.
“Then it’s lucky I didn’t spend forty-five Sickles on it, then.”
Harry pulled from Blaise and rubbed his eyes, he glanced around and saw everyone was terrified of him, even Albus seemed to step back a few paces, Severus looked paler than usual and shook his head. Harry dropped his wand and ran from the stage, not even giving them a second glance.
“Remain here, Miss. Granger,” said Dumbledore. “I’ll fetch him. I’m sure he’s alright.”
Ron rolled his eyes and banged on the cubicle that Hermione was in. “Come out, ‘Mione, we’ve got
“Uh.”
“Oh my,” said Harry, interested. “This one will be
I hope you enjoyed! :)
“Of course, it was one of the first things that I was taught regarding conversation,” said Harry. “Act like you’re appreciative when you’re not. It’ll be put to good use while I’m there.”
Harry noticed the stag butting heads with the table, waiting for something. “And what’s it doing?”
Snape sneered but gave a very rare smile. “I must say, Potter, Lily would be very proud of you for doing this. Very proud.”
Narcissa smiled and gave a quick nod, “just let me get a few things and I’ll be right there.”
“Foolish man, do not try to use Legilimency on me, you’re lucky Harry respects you, else I would tell him what you do to people constantly.”
“What,” said Harry, blinking, “happened?”
“That’s stupid,” said Harry, his tone rather harsh. He drummed his index finger against his chin, debating on what he’d say next. “There’s plenty of kids stuck in orphanages, obviously lacking in almost everything that kids need when growing up due to the harsh conditions of an orphanage. I’m sure if you asked the kids, they wouldn’t care what gender their parents were, as long as they were loved and had a home.”
They landed quickly and Neville ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned – it worked. The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice.
Chapter 25 –
“What will happen to the amulet once the task is completed?” Lucius fiddled with the amulet.
He sighed as quietly as he could manage, moving slightly to pick up his creased dress shirt, which he frowned at. He knew that it needed to appear like that so people would talk about the state of it, but he hated that it was so easily distressed. There was supposed to be a spell on it that stopped it from wrinkling, creasing, or getting dirty.
“Don’t pout at me, it’ll ruin your face.” Pansy grinned.
“Uh – yeah – alright,” stuttered out Susan. “I’ll just go… now, thank you, Harry.”
“Not at all,” she frowned sadly, clearly waiting for an explanation.
“Did you?”
“I almost forgot,” said Professor Sprout, cause all the students to pause. “Four people to a tray, one person from each house. There is a large supply of pots here – compost in the sacks over there – and be careful of the Venomous Tentacula, it’s teething.”
“The prank,” he said, reminding Fred and George. “Anything I can do to help?”
Goyle shared a very similar look with Crabbe, he turned and looked at Malfoy. “You must have some idea who’s behind it all.”
“Interesting,” said Harry, pulling away from the golden plaque. “I’m guessing that it’ll be around six hundred to seven hundred Galleons, seeing as the Nimbus was about that.”
“Right.”
Draco turned to Harry, shrugging. “I don’t know the password, it was changed this morning and the prefect didn’t seem fit to tell me while I was out in the Great Hall.”
Harry was just wondering why Malfoy wasn't losing points as he clearly started it, this wasn't fair. Harry kicked Malfoy's leg. “Stop being immature, Malfoy,” Harry let off a slight sigh. “Of course, no matter what you do Snape won’t notice.” Harry just stared at Draco, getting more and more annoyed. “You could punch me in the face and I bet he would just laugh about it.”
“D’you reckon it’ll be the fastest broom in the world?”
,” hissed Nagini in a very slow tone, something highly unusual for her. “
Neville still had a half-smile on his face when he saw Harry stand, he went to copy the action but a slight headshake from Dumbledore told him to remain seated. He watched as Harry, being as polite as he is, gave a quick nod and began to exit the Headmaster’s office. During all that, he couldn’t help but think on why he was being asked to remain behind.
Harry pushed open the door to the hospital wing with his foot as he held a large assortment of potions in his arms. He vastly enjoyed his brewing, especially when he’s doing it with Professor Snape, who tends to improve every potion ever made, using less and less ingredients as time goes on. He knew that said Potions Master had ruined a vast amount of careers by not taking on apprentices and due to his rather cutthroat attitude, but that’s easy to get by.
“I couldn’t think of anywhere else,” he said, kicking at the cobblestone path. “In the open is better – more vision. I dunno what that thing was, but it almost got us… if I hadn’t moved closer towards you when I did.”
Harry woke up pulling at the sheets, he looked around and realized it was now slightly dark and he gently pulled from Draco and put on a shirt and some pants. He looked at Draco and thought about the dream, no that wasn’t a dream it felt almost too real, down to the last aspect. Whatever happened he had to warn Narcissa. Harry grabbed his invisibility cloak and sat at Draco’s desk and wrote a note.
“I’m sure Dumbledore will explain it soon enough.”
“Whatever, Granger, continue on with your tirade.”
“Don’t panic Harry, I won’t peak.”
Fifty-five feet was the record, set by Bill Weasley a few years ago.
“They only want him for his books,” said Harry. “I only want him for his talent.”
“As if anything I brew would go wrong,” said Harry with a slight scowl. “I have been studying the potion for months and months. It’s hard to explain on how it works, but I was never able to get my hands on Angel's Trumpet, it’s distributed by the Ministry, as you know.”
Harry turned at the familiar voice and stared at Pansy with disappointment. He watched as she shifted on her feet, looking rather unnerved.
“Don’t be, in fact this whole ordeal is my fault,” Narcissa conjured a chair and sat down, ignoring the stare Draco gave her, “I forgot you weren’t used to apparating like Draco and I are. Never apparate after you’ve just eaten, it’s the quickest way to lose what you just ate, it will pass shortly and you’ll be back to normal. When I first apparated I did the same, be thankful, Draco wet himself the first time. The house-elves refused to clean it up.” Narcissa chuckled, “all was well, as we made Draco clean it up, that’s why he was so quick with the bucket, not that we would have made you clean it. Draco would have been made to clean the mess while you recovered.”
“Oh.”
Harry held the wand in his hand, embracing the rush of magic that seemed to flow from him. He knew that most people got a few sparks out of their wands when the connection was made and they found the right wand, but his was different. His whole body seemed to radiate a pulse of magic, which was almost smoke that came off him with traces of silver, replicating the wand perfectly.
“What would you know?”
; he was missing, too, from Important
Harry, who was still holding the wand, looked up at Mr. Ollivander and then back down to his wand for a few moments before finally looking back up. “Excuse me, but what are the characteristics of the wand?”
“Lily, you’ve never been so morbid before,” he muttered, more to himself than her, but he knew that she heard. “Take some rest and talk to Potter, I’m sure he’d help raise your spirits. The Dark Lord’s popularity is dwindling, his madness is causing a few to become wary. He will fall.”
“The real concern is: why are these things happening,” he said, squinting at Nott. “First we had Parkinson, who got far too interested in Greengrass and practically started to murder or bully the girl from the school – over what, I have no idea. Then we can go back to Greengrass, who seemed to be determined to somehow take over control of you, which would gain her nothing, on the orders of her father, who I learned isn’t her father, who… is her father… And now we have
” = Parseltongue
“Are you alright?” he asked softly. “If you want to back out now, I can create another scandal by entering the Yule Ball by myself. It won’t be as good, but the professors will overreact.”
Harry chuckled and joined them, “I’ll keep it in mind, I was thinking about getting a haircut over the Christmas holidays anyway, my hair grows rather fast so I end up getting a haircut every month.”
“What do you think you’re doing, Longbottom?” said Harry, his tone blank. “With the way that you’re holding your wand, it looks as if you wish to actually duel me.”
“It’s currently about seven in the morning, still have a few hours before I leave.”
Harry rolled his eyes at the ancient vampire and glanced around the store, wondering when they had done so much damage to the building. He bent over, picking up a magazine and shaking it slightly, frowning at the scorch marks on the corners of it.
“Me?”
Crabbe grunted.
“I want Piers to come over, Piers is a good friend,” blurted out Dudley and looked happy with himself. “Maybe not sleeping over, but he could just come over for a while.”
“Face your partners!” called Professor Lockhart, he was standing in the center of the platform. “And be sure to bow!”
“We would be asked to cure diseases such as cancer or anything major that we don’t have the tools to create. Until very recently a lot of witches and wizards were dying of Dragon Pox, it almost took out a few of the eldest wizarding families.”
“Don’t make me come in there, Harry, and drag you out myself,” said Lily, knocking in the door to the bathroom loudly. “You have no less than five minutes to get dressed and in the dining room before I blast that door open and drag you out, no matter of your state of dress.”
“I will get you out of Azkaban,” said Harry, glaring at a wall, unable to meet the eyes of Robin. “Even if I have to level that entire prison, I will do it. I promise that I will.”
Pansy snapped her eyes from Draco and focused them on Blaise, “you read way too much muggle love stories Blaise, honestly.”
Chapter revised:
All of it due to the castle going quiet.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Why?” said Harry. “I don’t… my soul shouldn’t be that corrupted.”
“Let’s get back on topic,” said James, not following the current conversation. He, like many other wizards, took advantage of house-elves and didn’t really mind where they came from, not that he would ever voice that out loud. “With all the help we got, we realised that perhaps it would be wise if we gave the manor some much-needed love and a rather new look.”
“We’re mostly just kidding,” said Harry, turning his attention from Dumbledore and onto Jude. “I actually think he’s a talented wizard who has done far more for us than people like to give him credit for. I can’t actually say that to most people as it would forever tarnish my reputation and leave me something of an outcast.”
,’ = Tom
Harry was going to say something, but he soon realised that the headmaster was apparently done with him as he turned towards Neville Longbottom abruptly and picked up the tray of lemon sweets, waving it tauntingly under Neville’s nose, hoping to coerce him into trying the sweets. ‘Must suck to be the only personal mentally unstable enough to eat buckets of lemon flavoured sweets per day,’ he thought, watching the headmaster and Longbottom interacts as if they were old friends.
“You’d better open it, Ron,” said a girl off to the side. “It’ll just be worse if you wait. I’ve gotten one from my sister once and I ignored it and it was horrible.”
Harry glared.
Harry glanced up, feeling something tug on his jumper and looked into the hazel eyes of his brother, who had one hand on his jumper and the other holding a toy in the air. “You want it to fly?” he asked, eyeing the toy with concern. Surely it couldn’t hurt to make the blasted thing fly.
The white lady didn’t come out, instead it all fixed internally but Draco heard her voice echo something along the lines of ‘Treat him well.’ Honestly, Draco thought he was going crazy. The golden Snitch rolled out of Harry’s hand and onto the grass.
Rosier couldn’t help but snort at that. “Any injury they have can be cleared up by Madam Pomfrey in less than a week,” he said loudly, trying to speak over the howling of the wind. “So, there’s no real point in hoping and praying that any of them will get hurt.”
“Everyone –”
He knew that his mother cared for him, beyond any normal grasp of a motherly love. Being a Legilimens and a child, the ability reared its head more times than he could control and he learned a lot about her. She would forever worry over him, fear that she would lose him to another accident like what happened when he was six and just recently the troll incident. It could explain why she wants me with Muggles and not in the magical world.
“Mr Weasley has proven that he can do the dance,” said Professor McGonagall. “I hope you all were watching and not whispering as you will all be pairing up and practising it with each other. We have far more boys than girls now, so some of the boys will have to pair up with each other.”
“In a sense,” said Draco, digging at the table with his nails. “She’s the heir because her father is dead and her mother, who’s a woman, cannot inherit anything as she’s an outsider. If Daphne has her son, he will become the heir and leader of the family. If Daphne has a daughter, which is common in the Greengrass line, it will fall to her daughter to have a son.”
Chapter 16 –
“I know what it said,” said Harry. “I did read it, after all. It doesn’t concern us.”
James let out a long sigh. “Sometimes I wish I could do the same thing, Sirius.”
Harry just smirked, proud that he had hurt Riddle with a charm that was to aid with the crushing of hard ingredients in cooking. He would have to thank his mother for that one later on. “If you wish to kill Voldemort, you’ll have to kill Ginny,” he said, sighing when he realised that both Weasley and Longbottom got a defensive look on their faces. “The possession has gone for to long for any means to dispel it.”
He, along with the other Aurors, had received some sort of brief training that highlighted the effects of killing magical creatures. Many of the Aurors had theories on whether the training was done to highlight the effects and detriments of killing various magical creatures, whether it was done to cause cautions, or whether it was implemented to stop the Aurors from using their newly acquired skills to join hunters and receive a large number of galleons for trafficking various creature parts. He, personally, believed that it was a mix of them all. That it was to deter them, aid them, and help them aid others while solving a case. It was not up to the Aurors to help magical creatures, nor was it up to them to prevent the harm of magical creatures. When he became Head Auror, he decided to leave the training as a simple deterrent. Deterrents worked better than any other method he could think of, no matter how deeply he reached. For an example, all one needed to do was look at Gringotts, read the warning etched onto the door, and realise that only one person – and that person was rumoured to have been You-Know-Who – in the last two hundred years has broken into the bank.
“You made bets on my sexuality?” Harry was shocked and confused.
Voldemort looked back at him and wove his hand, “Excellent, that is all I need of you, Lucius.” He exclaimed and went back to reading.
Harry stared at the headmaster, curious, debating whether or not he should say something about his spell being a destructive based spell. He decided against it, just before he opened his lips to say that it mimicked a volcano’s eruption and burned the person alive. “I’m not sure if you know that when I was a lot younger I worked with Professor Snape in various things, such as potions and spells, and we came up with an idea. The spell was rather simple and it was hardly a new thing, but how we were going to implement it and make it work was,” he paused, noticing that his mother, James, and the headmaster were all intrigued. “It’s a lot like the Stinging Hex, just slightly different. Instead’ve stinging the opponent, it tickles them. The spell was designed to be something to help younger children learn to duel.
There was thunderous applause from the Durmstrang students, which rendered a few people silent, expecting fighting and shouts of displeasure. It seemed like Durmstrang was already unified with their choice and seemed to be thrilled by it.
Harry continued to walk backwards, his eyes locked onto the main street of Hogsmeade, his hand pulling Draco as they took ten steps. He took a deep breath, straining to hear the screams and shouts, his mind blanking for a moment when they all suddenly stopped. He found it odd that all noise, no matter what it was, stopped completely. He could hear himself moving, Draco breathing, and the gravel under his foot, but anything from beyond the small building in front of them was silent.
“I ask you all to welcome Hagrid with open arms, especially those in Gryffindor! It was Hagrid who brought me into this world, and it is I who is going to make sure he gets the education he deserves.” Harry gave a slight bow and glanced around the room, taking in the happy faces and the tears on Hagrid’s face, he gave him a wide smile and a curt nod.
die?”
“Decent?” said Harry, tilting his head slightly. “Do you mean that as in they are respectable pure-bloods? If so, I think you’ve forgotten that half the ‘decent’ ones see me as tainted blood.”
“That or someone blabbed.”
“I’m sorry,” said Harry, merging the two words together. “I didn’t mean to kill it… I just want – needed something.”
“His star student is injured,” said Rosier. “He’ll be furious now that there’s no one to complete the work assigned without blowing things up.”
“I’m not gonna argue with that,” said Harry. “It’s wise to not disrupt the peace with petty ideals and trying to wage a war against Muggles. We’d lose and that’s that. We won’t stand a chance against Muggles. Our shields cannot withstand a bullet; our wards cannot stop a bomb. Our magic may short-circuit electronics, but that’s two-way. Enough electronics will break a ward.”
Harry instantly slapped his hand into his head and sighed. “Professor Snape is not after the Stone, I’m not sure why you think that he is, but I can assure that he’s not after it. Why do you doubt me when you know I’m a capable Legilimens?”
“I feel bad that I told the hat what to do, if it is possible can I be re-sorted next year, this time I’ll just sit quiet. Don’t worry Albus, I have a strong feeling I’ll be put into Gryffindor again, but if I’m not, I won’t all of a sudden go dark, I thank you for telling me this, I realize how hard it must have been… but out of everyone you’re my inspiration, I follow in your footsteps.” Harry smiled and gave Albus a bright smile, which seemed to cheer the old man up.
“Speak for yourself,” said Clara. “I was a perfect student.”
“Thirteen,” said Harry. “If I have learned anything from watching your father, reading books, and studying the current Minister for Magic, it’s that it takes a veteran to handle the basics of political movement. Everyone can dip their fingers in the political fudge, but only those seasoned enough can lie about not doing so, even with fudge over their fingers.”
Neville jumped sky-high when he heard the voice. “I didn’t see you come in!” he said, staring at the professor.
“So?” barked Nott. “I didn’t ask any of that, nor do I care! What I want to know is why you’re still here!”
“Can you two stop bickering? It’s far too early for this,” said Narcissa, holding her temple slightly. “If I remember right, Draco, you used to think that Harry’s birthday was on the second of November and you would cry and moan that he was born at a stupid time and wouldn’t be able to attend Hogwarts with you.”
“Ugh!”
“You know we’re the best,” said Draco. “Of course you’d find real friends here.”
Bellatrix laughed and picked up the dagger, “oh I did nothing; you’re the one who did it. I tried to stop you but you just walked over there and did it yourself, your blood will bring the Dark Lord back to his potential.”
“Perhaps,” said Dumbledore simply, his eyes turned towards Harry and then back to Lily. “This year has a lot more students than the last few.”
“No need to be sarcastic,” said Nott. “You’re a Potter in Slytherin, Quidditch Captain, friends with a Malfoy, and top of the classes. People are going to listen to you, even if you rambled and talked nonsense. Think about Dumbledore.”
And, due to that fear, he was pretty much left to his own, unable to bounce ideas off anyone except for Tom.
“James and I, we sacrificed ourselves for you. So you could live and defeat the foul thing known as Voldemort. As you said before, life is full of mistakes, why are you accepting such a poor mistake you made when you’re given a chance to reverse it?”
He watched as Potter gave a way and the black mist slowly retreated and the ward corrected itself.
“Whatever,” said Blaise. “He seems to hate me enough already, I don’t –”
He paused mid-step when he heard something that he could not quite place in the distance. The noise similar familiar, something that he expected almost everyone, whether Muggle or wizard, to understand at some point in their lives. It was similar to a bell or gong, just not as loud or obvious. It was subtle, which meant you had to be listening to actually hear it.
“Not even kidding,” said Draco. “Harry’s spent most of his time in the library.”
He would pull everything out of her head. Every little scheme. Every detail. Every insult. He would know it and he would then destroy her. Targeting Draco would be the last thing Daphne Greengrass ever did.
Harry of course understood the hiss, the snake had some nerve to call them morons. He glared at the snake angrily. He had the right frame of mind to abuse it.
at magic. A simple bit of Transfiguration isn’t
Lily sat back with Narcissa in the highly expensive room that was called the sitting room, in fact, this one room was about the size of their house. “How have you and Lucius been, Narcissa?”
“Hello, Hagrid, Draco and I wanted to spend our free time with you, having tea, is that alright?” said Harry in a polite tone. Before Hagrid could even object, he was speaking again. “I hope you don’t, it’s a long way back to the castle and we’re a little tired.” He waited until Hagrid went to speak again before he continued. “Of course my mother always praised your tea and father said that I just had to come and taste it and, of course, your amazing cakes.”
“Fifteen inches, dragon heartstring, beech – curious, very curious.” Ollivander said calmly. “This wand was the first wand you picked up. Mr. Potter, it’s curious that the real owner had been in the store at the time.”
“Thank you,” said Harry, his face twitching a little as he tried not to sound too awkward. “I try to not come across as a know-it-all, despite the fact that most people are content on remaining ignorant on almost everything. I do know when to fold, and accept the defeat, or when to play my hand and reel in my winnings.”
“Fred? George?”
you,” said Robin cutting in. “I’ve lived my life, you haven’t. You’ll be tossed into Azkaban.”
Harry grimaced as the shield appeared around the creature, almost containing it before the thing raised a dripping claw, devouring the spell in an instant. He realised that the thing was not just immune to fire, it was nearly impervious to all forms of magic, no matter what branch they came from. It simply ate the spell and continued on as if it had never been cast at it.
Draco looked puzzled but caught Harry’s look. “That’s fascinating, someone robbed Grin –”
“In the summer term,” said Professor Trelawney, ignoring the snickering. “We shall progress to the crystal ball – if we have finished with fire-omens, that is. Unfortunately, classes will be disrupted in February by a nasty bout of flu. I myself will lose my voice. And around Easter, one of our number will leave us forever.”
“Fascinating,” said Professor Dumbledore, looking slightly concerned.
“And?” said Harry, glaring. “You’ll go instead. I’m a master Occlumens, the Dementors can’t touch my emotions or my memories. I dealt with them last year.”
The student immediately stood, “thank you Professor McGonagall.”
“Awful suggestion!” barked Pansy, annoyed. “We need her around to feel the burn of the rumours. If she’s unconscious or weak in bed, she won’t hear them. We
“Of course you didn’t,” said Draco with a forced chuckle. “I feel bad for you, in some sense, because you essentially have two sets of parents.”
“From what I have seen,” said Cornelius, breaking the awkward silence, “Harry is a remarkably complex boy with emotions and an attitude that makes him seem like he is not a child. However, this all crumbles into nothing when you realise that he is a child and still, whether subconsciously, still wishes for that. Of course, I have no children so I may incorrect.”
He had got a lot of information regarding Fluffy, the three-headed dog, from Hagrid, who happily revealed it after a few threats and then a few minutes of soothing the threats and promising never to reveal anything. Naturally, the oaf had spilled everything, even irrelevant details.
,” he hissed in reply. “
“I know,” said Harry, somewhat confused on why Draco was pointing out his age. “So are you.”
“Hmph.”
,’ = Tom
Harry however, did not deem that a very legal play and blocking the Seeker should be punishable, although if they wanted to play like that, he would join in and make them taste some justice. He hovered near Lucian Bole, who was doing a perfectly fine job as he hit away multiple Bludgers in quick succession. “Bole, give me your damn bat!” He practically shouted and caught the bat that was tossed to him.
“You don’t look it,” said Dudley as he gazed at the boy. “Well, at least while you’re here, you’ll be getting plenty of food and you’ll get big and strong.”
The entire group just stood there silently, utterly baffled at what was being said. None of them knew what to do or say, especially when the explanation got more and more in-depth, resembling a crazed obsessive psychopath at how in detail their Captain had studied other players.
“Yes and he’s a Pure-Blood, so it’s correct, right?”
“I wouldn’t blame him, to be honest.”
Lucius collected a few books and papers and tucked them neatly on his desk and vanished the teacup, he hastily walked out. What he didn’t notice was Narcissa closely watching and listening on the side.
“Professor Sprout never told us how to kill it, that’s next lesson!” said Neville. “I only know how to tend to it!”
“Just a second, Harry!” panted Draco, as he jogged towards the door and swung it open, allowing the shivering Harry to step inside. “I’m ready.”
, you would be dead.”
“Hey Ron,” Hermione waved and Ron turned to face her. “How are you?”
“Alright,” muttered Harry. “I and Draco are hungry and we want some biscuits.”
“A team game where the game is decided by one person,” said Rosier. “Interesting concept, but witches and wizards
Draco shuddered as Harry’s warm breath connected with his neck, “hello, and Blaise sweetie, don’t do that Harry should be here soon.” Draco smirked as Harry’s breath stopped and then a hand speared through his hair, which that last action sent Draco into a frenzy fixing his hair. “Potter don’t-”
“None of you should be here, what’s going on is between Albus, Severus, Draco, Harry and I assume Narcissa Malfoy, not any of you, leave this instant!” She shook her head slightly.
Nicolas nodded and watched as the house-elf popped into his sitting room, directly next to the boy and then kept its eyes from everything in the room.
This chapter is a bit of an infodump for later chapters. I apologise for that. If you are curious, the game that Professor Moody played is similar to Beat Saber... a little different, though.
“The library?” questioned Hagrid, following them out of the Hall. “Just before the holidays? Bit keen, aren’t yeh?”
“Look at that!” said Ernie, furious. “No mention of that amazing play by the Ravenclaw Chaser! Nothing!”
The voice grew fainter and fainter as it spoke.
“It really depends on how quickly we can get what we need to done, then you’ll come home,” said Lily. “I’ll collect you myself at the earliest possible time.”
Draco swallowed, watching as Harry lowered his middle finger, his eyes never leaving his friend’s fingers. He took a deep breath and prepared to sprint out of the little alcove that they were hiding in. He blinked, catching the wand movement from Harry, and jumped when he heard a loud crack, not as loud as thunder, but it would pull them towards them. He quickly began to move when he saw the bird explode into a wall of black feathers. Despite wanting to look back, he didn’t.
“Doesn’t it mean something about the in the year of the Lord?”
“Did I say you weren’t?” said Sirius. “I simply said that you and Lily refuse to treat him like he deserves. He hasn’t been a child for a long time, James. He does not look to you as a father, he looks to you as an acquaintance, someone he sees very little of. Harry looks to you like I looked at my own father.”
“You will see soon,” said Atieno. “Vuul has no English translation, however, it is an honorific title and something that most hold incredibly close. To be labelled as a vuul is considered the ultimate accomplishment in the eyes of everyone. However, it attaches to the name, so you would be Harryvuul, assuming that is how it is done, but it is not.”
He first realised that he had been undressed and redressed in those hideous blue and white stripped pyjamas that were frequent in the hospital wing.
“Very little,” said Harry, turning around to look at his friend. “However, you don’t need to come with me if you don’t want to. I won’t hold it against you, tease you, or hold it over your head. I’d much prefer it if you did leave because I don’t want you to get hurt at all. I don’t want to lose you to save a child, but I
“That’s cheating!”
“And I’ll be dragged into it, somehow.”
“Now,” said Harry cheerfully, “let’s discuss the Chamber of Secrets.”
Sadly for Draco. That didn’t happen.
Draco slightly shook his head and walked over, “I wasn’t sulking, I was thinking.”
“Hm,” Harry turned and looked at the Gryffindor Prefect with a blank look. “Oh, hello, Weasley, I was simply walking around and decided to cast some dark magic on your portrait and see if should would allow me access. It worked, clearly.”
“Why do you hate her so much?”
Many of the students had heard from Professor Lupin, the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, that Dementors fed from happy memories, such as spending time with family and feeling safe.
“Don’t be a fool!”
“Who’s Moaning Myrtle?” asked Neville, watching as Hermione practically sped away from the direction of the said ghost. “And why are we running from her?”
Harry closed his book and motioned her to sit.
“The entire Potter family is seen as famous, a lot of people talk ill of James as he never seemed to grow up, but people praise Lily and Harry.” Dumbledore turned to face Draco, “the Potter house is over here, it’s where I have Harry.”
He suppressed a yawn as he listened to Dumbledore explain how it would work once more, mainly to keep the slow students up to speed. He wondered if there would be seven winners, one for each year level, or whether it would be free for all afterwards.
“It’s obviously broken,” said Harry, frantically zipping up and down the zipper, trying to get it beyond the bit it was stuck on.
“Oh.”
“Hm,” said Harry, flipping over the letter to see if anything was on the back. He slid it across the table and allowed his mother to read it. “Hogsmeade visits. You have to sign it.”
He rubbed at his hairless chin and began planning on what else he could do.
“Poke me again and I’ll throw you into the lake,” said Harry as the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the lake, which was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood.
Harry rolled his eyes, whispering the magical number under his breath, and set off in a run, hearing the growls of the mob to his left. He saw the shadow of Draco, so he knew that the boy was close to him. He called out directions, darting left and right, leading them both into a small brown building, one that looked like it was slowly falling apart. He, however, knew it was sturdier than on glance due to the fact the worn appearance was intentional. He slammed the wooden door as soon as Draco entered, levitating a large cupboard in front of it.
“If it wasn’t me, it’d have been Draco.”
“It’s not my job to be teaching you, professor.”
Lily was barely able to keep up with half the slang the man used when they entered the building. It was like a waterfall and she had no idea what he was saying. She had no idea what a dero was, nor did she know how that was relevant to the house. Not to mention when he complimented her lippie and said that his wife used the almost same sort.
Despite the system and the peace and quiet, he had questions that he wanted to ask as soon as he could. However, every time he went to ask, Ernie would shush him the second his lips parted in preparation to speak.
He moved to his seat and sat down, staring directly ahead as if following a lesson. Of course, barely a minute later, a wet group of students followed in, all of them looking quite annoyed and frustrated. Before he could taunt the Gryffindors, the spell obscuring Professor Moody and the man gave a weak and last imitation of a clap.
“Hey ‘Arry, come in, come in, I jus’ made some tea!” Hagrid boomed, gesturing towards the little kettle and two cups that were the size of a bottle instead of a cup. “Wha’ are yeh lads doin’ here t’day?”
Harry arrived back at Malfoy Manor without anyone being the wiser that he had actually left. He smirked as he walked softly throughout the halls of Malfoy Manor and towards his bedroom, making sure to remain silent, not wanting to be bombarded with various questions on his sneaking around in the early afternoon. He was certain that the entire family, except for Abraxas, was in the drawing room, so he would be safe for at least a while.
“We split –”
“I must apologize then, Theodore,” said Harry, placing his hand over his heart. “I did not mean for the nickname I had given you to escalate so far amongst the other students, especially those out of our own house. You must see these things from my perspective though. Having my hair ruffled and having sixth-years squeeze my cheeks was more embarrassing then what happened to you.”
Harry followed alongside Draco, trying not to laugh as Nagini began a monologue about how she was starved and forced to eat rats that tasted awful. He really wanted to point out that Nagini had a diet larger than just rats and she often ate other things more often than not. He was tugged into a nearby alcove, hidden slightly by a pillar. He and Draco stood facing each other, their faces less than inches apart. He coughed awkwardly and pushed himself back, summoning a rat in the process for Nagini, who happily devoured the thing.
“Jones, Megan!” called Professor McGonagall.
“We thought it was Malfoy,” said Hermione, glaring with her fantastic bright yellow eyes. “At first we thought it was you, despite Neville – don’t laugh!”
“Weasley, what the fuck is that on your wrist?” Draco shouted at Ron.
“Shove off,” muttered Draco, studying the pattern on his quilt. “I wonder if this coming year will be quiet. The last two years have been interesting, to say the least. Possessed teachers and the famous Chamber of Secrets opening.”
“But what can we –” Hermione gasped, stopping her speech dead in her tracks, her eyes widened.
Harry snorted. “He went to them for you, and only you, Longbottom, not me. I didn’t defeat Voldemort, I’m not the saviour of the wizarding world and I haven’t done the wizarding world any favours and earned myself a hyphenated nickname.”
“You’d be surprised at how many people don’t know what one is,” said Professor Lupin. “It’s going to be a good lesson, I think.”
“Of course Harry dear, you know that.”
“A tragic tale,” he said as he repositioned her body into a more natural and less thrown manner. “The boy she loved left her and, in her sadness, she attempted to take her life. The pain left her delirious and she retreated into her mind to avoid said pain. Her magic unknowingly kept her alive, and now she’s nothing more than a waste of oxygen. Have a nice day, Daphne.”
“Do not interrupt me!” barked Lucius, his eyes narrowing and his posture stiffening always instantly. He clenched his cane, which concealed his wand, and waved it slightly as if threatening the boy. “Were you not taught any manners? No, of course not. For my own sanity, you wretched brat, do not dare to presume the price of
Harry rolled his eyes and set off down the corridor, leaving Draco behind. “Keep up, then,” he called over his shoulder.
“Come on now, round them up, round them up, they’re only pixies…” shouted Professor Lockhart. He then rolled up his sleeves, brandished his wand. “Peskipiksi Pesternomi!”
It was a woman. It had to be a woman. Her voice was soft and melodic, almost piercing through the haze in his head. He tried to speak, but nothing coherent came out. When that failed, he tried to stand, but that only made something swat his forehead.
“How Slytherin father can be at times.”
Harry couldn’t help but chuckle at the comparison.
“Hiding, are we?” said Harry as gave a disgusted look towards the alcove. “You’re not as quiet as you lot would think.”
“The guy is crazy.”
“Now, stop squirming,” said Draco, poking his best friend in the ribs with his long finger.
The potion wasn’t dark or illegal, but it did cause damage when the phial it was in was smashed instead of drunk. The air contaminates the potion and causes it to solely morph into a mist that slowly chokes the person who breathes it in. It was a curious potion that couldn’t stick to food or anything like that. It had to be breathed in to be lethal.
“They were not,” said Draco. “They were slightly unhinged in a good way.”
“Are you well enough to leave Harry?” Madam Pomfrey’s voice was soft.
“And I assume Nagini is going to stay here?”
Harry nodded and walked towards the door, however the three satnding there wouldn’t let him leave. Draco sighed and stood near Harry.
“Shut up, Potter!” roared Ron, his fists clenched. “You may kill people, but we don’t! We’re gonna save her, you hear me? We’re gonna save her!”
“Before you all have breakfast, I would like to explain a few events,” said Dumbledore, standing as straight as possible. “I would like everyone to remain quiet while this issue is addressed. It is only respectful and I’m sure this is exactly what the person would wish. All questions, no matter what they are, will be answered after everything is explained. Is that understood?”
“Words have never been my strong suit,” he said, turning back to Nott with a smug expression to rival Nott’s. “As most people know, I prefer to act. I hate sitting around, twiddling my fingers. So, how about we settle this in the proper manner and have a duel?”
WARNING: Chapter has minor torture.
“No, it’s mine,” said Harry, picking up said sausage with his fork. “You’re too late.”
“Well let’s go to breakfast, don’t worry Blaisey, I’m sure it will be worth it.” Draco grinned and led them out.
Harry rushed into the Great Hall, and sat down next to Ron, and frowned. “Thanks a lot for making me carriage with Malfoy,” he added disappointingly.
“Hey Fred,” George said.
“It’s their job to meddle,” said Lily. “Despite what people like to think, they’ve got to understand the climate of Muggle paranoia and expectancy.”
“Potter will be fine,” said Ron. “Somehow he’ll survive and then brag about it when we get to Hogwarts.”
Harry snorted, it was either snort or burst out in laughter. “
“Come…”
The two continued to converse, although it was mainly Harry, making sure his mother knew exactly how to feed Nagini. It had taken him many months to learn the proper grooming spells so that he could teach his mother to do them without causing an issue. It saved creating a colony of mouse or rats and letting Nagini hunt them from, not that they had the space for it.
!” he hissed out between laughing, he would not say he giggled, as he did not giggle. “
“Just rest him on the floor,” Severus said and held back the laughter.
Harry, going a slight shade of red, just followed behind Narcissa and Draco, wishing they could just Apparate to the place and save an awkward journey there. He was still annoyed about the comment about the toilet and wondered if Narcissa did it on purpose. Even if he did manage to break the spell, he would have to run back to Narcissa with his zipper down and ask for her to fix it.
“I dunno,” said Dudley. “You should try speaking to him, that’s what I’d do if I were in your situation.”
His patience slowly slipped constantly as the days went by. The entire time that he had been here, he hadn’t received not one letter from his parents at all, he didn’t blame the Malfoys as he knew they didn’t want to get him in trouble, but his parents should have known better, his mother especially. She should have known that dumping him off here would just annoy him and make him angry and highly irate. He may have some anti-social tendencies, but being alone was something he disliked, especially in an unfamiliar place. That was probably why he and Draco got along well, they would follow each other around with complaint, heck even into the bathroom and neither would say anything.
“You’re fifteen, two years older,” said Sarah. “Talk to him, I bet her uses long words that no one uses anymore. I also bet he can speak flawless French and’ll seduce you with poems and roses.”
“I have a snake at home,” said Harry, letting the crowd of students know. “I know how to deal with them. This one right here is an Adder, a fair way from home.”
Severus snapped his eyes to Harry, “I see, and where were you? You caused quite the scare vanishing like that.”
“Potter,” said Hermione, her voice slightly wavering. “You’re going to be my dance partner.”
He realised his son would be an awful diplomat.
“I made it, I earned it… NOW GET THE FUCK OUT!” Harry’s voiced echoed the room.
Salazar had confirmed this a while ago. He said that snakes wouldn’t understand contractions because all snakes communicated formally. Nagini was a special case because he had done it for so long she had begun to pick up on what don’t meant and what do not meant.
“Of course the Boy Who Lived thinks that potions is a useless class.” Snape snapped and walked past Harry, he turned in front of Harry and blocked his movement.
“I actually did think of Voldemort first,” said Neville. “But then I – I remembered those Dementors.”
Harry thought on it for less than a second, still trying to piece it all together. He couldn’t piece it together, no matter how hard he thought. As per usual, Tom provided no helpful input.
“You think you have it all figured out?”
,” said Salazar. “
“I will still pay a price,” said Harry. “It just won’t be a visible price.”
“That’s Elizabeff, right, but we call ‘er Liza,” said Mike. “And I'm bloody well just goin’ on ter some rich boy wiv ‘is bruvver, I fink.”
“Oh, we’re not working,” said Neville brightly, staring directly at Hagrid with a warming smile. “Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel, we’ve been trying to find out who he is.”
“Unless what? My Lord,” Lucius bowed again, Voldemort ignored him.
“Harry,” repeated Lily. “Harrison!”
“No,” said Harry instantly. “I would also like two complete sets of casual robes as well as some gloves and name tags of course. Not those cheap name tags you usually give people either, they’re trash.”
“If he considered me a threat, he would’ve expelled me by now,” said Harry. “And I am speaking to the other students in my House. Children are not their parents and most of them don’t share the same views because Voldemort was dead during their childhoods. Next, you’ll be telling me that Slytherin is the House where all evil people go and it’s this way to create House unity between three Houses.”
“Hm? Oh, yes. Father has never neglected me in any way besides working too much.”
“Well,” started Theodore before he was nudge din the ribs by Draco’s pointy elbows.
!” she watched as her human laughed at her, the audacity! “
Harry put down the book, making sure he remembered what page and line number he was on and gently closed it. “Draco, I am aware of cursed books and I’m pleased to inform you that I have never once gone near one,” he said certainly. “However, you did leave out a few interesting ones, such as the one that caused the reader to randomly spew out lines in a book that they had last read – the issue is that it stopped you from reading another book so you sprouted phrases from a magical book, which makes you appear insane if you’re a Muggle. Oh, and the one that caused the reader to think that they had an incurable disease and would make them insane from the sheer thought of unavoidable death.”
“That flat voice they answer in?”
“You do?”
“Sometimes I wonder.” Harry said with a hint of sarcasm.
“Hm.”
“Don’t think like that,” said Lily, frowning. “I know that the previous topic was wearing you thin, I could tell by how one-sided the conversation appeared. I would speak to you all day if I knew we could do it. I heard a rumour about a young boy who was hit by a curse.”
,” hissed Harry, holding his hand over his heart.
“The time where you tried to throw a spell at me, and it backfired?” Draco let the built up laugh loose, expecting to be hit by some kind of spell.
Harry, disregarding Professor McGonagall’s orders, opened a different book and a different page and began reading. He frowned when the book was snatched from his grip and floated towards the professor, who began flicking through it the instant it had reached her. “Professor –”
Harry nodded and stepped into his area, which was pretty much empty and made a quick line towards his trunk, which he quickly picked up, making sure everything was in there and not left behind. Of course it’d look suspicious, but he could just lie if anything happened and he was forced to remain here. Compared to the other boys in here, he was the neatest, so it took very little time in order to get it all ready, including adding his shoes into it, which he had to place on the top of a shirt instead of at the bottom like he would have liked.
“Pansy Parkinson, she keeps calling Draco and I lovers, I told Snape and he said he would deal with her.” Harry frowned.
Mopsy continued to wail, her large, round eyes filling with unshed tears. She vanished the table and chair with a click, the plate vanishing before it smashed to the ground. “Mopsy is being such a failure, Little Master!” she said, rubbing at her eyes. She repeated it three more times before straightening slightly. “Little Master, please be allowing Mopsy to leave and wail alone.”
Lily was confused on what this man was even going on about. She knew he was insane, but this was something else entirely. She didn’t want to antagonize the insane Dark Lord either, that would be a death wish.
“It does and it will,” said Harry. “I don’t hold it against it, though. It seems to have realised that I’m off limits and actively avoids me, but I’m sure it’ll take the chance when it can. I’d rather just avoid it. It won’t seek me out like Death would, it will leave me be and wait until we cross paths.”
Ron, who had just walked back in, made a disgusted noise and instantly went quiet at the stares he got from everyone in the room.
“Sadly,” said George, “but it was worth it.”
“It’s best to move forwards, not remain in the same place,” said Nicolas. “Half these traditions you follow have been obsolete for a very, very long time and only recently bought back.”
Throwing one last look at Eliott, after he put on his socks and shoes, he closed the door and made his way towards the castle.
“I can, and I will, now hush… students are trying to learn.” Snape never intended to take the points off, it was just funny… at least for Snape.
Harry paused for a moment. “You’re not very well liked, from what I have gathered and I don’t understand it. Could you explain?”
spells that work in tandem with each other to form one single spell. It is an astonishing piece of spell creation that has been praised ever since.”
Harry opened his eyes to find himself staring straight at a dark wooden door, which had no glass and no way to see inside. He softly knocked on it and took a small step backwards when it opened the moment his small knuckles connected with the door. He slowly took a step forwards, poking his head into the doorframe, gently opening the door fully.
“Welcome, Patrick,” said Nicholas somewhat bitterly.
Harry tried to recall the memory but found that he couldn’t remember that at all.
“Ward Creation, a subject you should teach, is important for a potioneer, especially anyone who takes safety into account,” said Professor Snape. “You know this, headmaster.”
“No issue,” said Petunia, walking out the door. “If you want anything to eat, just grab it from the fridge.”
“That’s awfully black and white of you, Weasley,” snapped Harry. “It’s most likely due to the fact that I’m in Slytherin and Godric charmed it to burn a Slytherin whenever wielded by one. Awfully pathetic of the man, to be honest. It could also burn Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws – or maybe it’ll only work for the person who summoned it, in this case, Neville, so stab her, Neville.”
“He was also murdered.”
Harry ignored her and reached for a plate of food, he knew eating made them gasp at him and that meant silence for five minutes while he thought on how to address this situation. Harry kept his head down, making sure he never locked eyes with anyone, which would be way too awkward to deal with. Harry heard Fred and George try and make some light jokes, but they failed, Harry was stuck in thought.
Harry straightened his posture, as he was taught and smiled, trying his hardest to prove Draco wrong, but it failed in the end, so Harry walked up and opened the door to the Malfoy Manor for her.
Snape noticed the action Draco did, “what?” Snape mumbled, knowing it was probably something with Harry.
“If it wasn’t so bloody expensive…”
He felt the spell on them vanish when the class was dismissed he breathed a sigh of relief and stood, facing away from the wall. “That was a waste of a lesson, I wonder if we can drop flying lessons – I mean it’s not like we got anything done.”
“Not on purpose, but you can assist me,” said Harry. “I have no idea why I didn’t think of it before.”
“No.”
,” hissed Nagini, lifting her head towards the roof. “
“Perhaps,” said Salazar. “You are forgetting one core detail, however.”
He needed more reserves. He needed reserves for the reserves, and reserves for those reserves. Reserves for the reserves for the reserves. That was going to get confusing really quickly.
Harry knew that if every Auror in the country had been pulled into the Ministry and asked to come in early that something was going on, something massive. He half expected it to already be on the front page of the Daily Prophet, along with Skeeters name and her unique flair for destroying everything that could be useful. Rita had an infamous following in Slytherin as the woman somehow managed to get a lot of the important secrets from many pure-blooded witches and wizards.
“Good, he deserved it, the filthy Half-Blood.”
Draco nodded and shifted around his pieces, hoping to somehow corner his mother and get her with a quick and easy checkmate, but it wasn’t going to plan. “Harry has been teaching me Occlumency during out first year at school, he said it’d do me good to have the ability now that he was around others.”
Neville wheeled around to stare at Ron. “Not another attack? Not now?”
“Before you leave, refresh the curse on the blood-traitor, he still has the amulet so you should be able to find him again, I must congratulate Draco on giving it to him, I assume it did actually work. But yes, refresh the curse and he should be back to hating Harry Potter and beating him again soon.” Voldemort waved Lucius away and then he watched Lucius disapparate.
my power!”
Harry turned in shock, “he’s skipping classes?”
“If you don’t talk about it, nothing will ever get better,” said Lily. “You did everything you could. You tried, that’s all you can do. Talk to me, James.”
“The only information we got was that he was
“You’ll know who when you meet him,” said Harry. “He has taken refuge here and helped with the spells and building. I owe him a lot, really.”
“Stop being a git and listen to me, for goodness sake,” said Harry with a tone of annoyance. “One day I’ll get through your head that you’re wasting your life by being a bully currently or that your only future ambition is to be a Quidditch player? You need good grades for that, Flint.”
Salazar made a noise and gave a gesture to continue.
“They didn’t even search you when you were abducted,” said Robin, pressing his forehead against the bars. “Perhaps because you offered your wand without resistance, they assumed you were clean… or, maybe, because your father already started a fuss and they didn’t want to annoy their boss. However, this
Pansy began to walk, “we’re going to Snape, he will explain more.”
“You moronic, idiotic, git!” hissed Draco in a whisper. “The professor was right there and instead of asking for help, you smooth talk her away from you?”
“Exactly that.”
“I’m ready.”
Harry flung his head back dazed, “fine.”
“A conspiracy to end the truce, I guess,” said Harry, trying not to laugh. “I think that’s giving him too much credit.”
. He would send one of his lackeys to do it and that moron that dabbles in Knockturn Alley would be tasked with it as the ale is closely watched. He. Would. Fail.”
“Fascinating,” muttered Draco. “I wonder what they want. There’s quite a few of them…”
Neville watched, amazed, as a portly ghost approached the table, crouched low and walked through it, his mouth held wide so that it passed through one of the stinking salmon. “Can you taste it if you walk through it?”
“Is that?” Draco almost choked on his words.
“You could have wrote to me, Harry.”
Theodore smirked and turned towards Harry with a facial expression that said that the deepest secrets were going to be revealed. The smirk fell from his face when he saw the look that Harry was giving him. It must have been the light, because he swore that Harry’s eyes darkened slightly, as if he was to slay the next person he saw.
He slowly unfolded the paper and felt his eyes widen.
“This one is updated with the newest charms and a protection against theft, so Ron cannot steal it again.” Harry grinned. “Which means Ron gets your old car, it has been fixed up and such.” Harry dug through his pockets. “Ah, finally, here they are,” He handed each person a ticket, “First Class seats for the Quidditch World Cup,”
“No need to get upset about it, Harry,” said Lily, attempting to soothe her already irritated son. “At least she got you a present and it’s the thought that counts. I’m sure she wasn’t attempting to call you a Sociopath, Harry. I think she was just trying to be nice and wasn’t aware that it would offend you.”
“I’m not as good as you,” said Neville, very embarrassed, as she let go of him.
“SLYTHERIN!” shouted the hat the moment it touched the boy’s head.
“Really?” said Lily, excited.
He took the steps up towards the seventh-floor, grinning when he realised the steps weren’t out to kill him this time. His right foot landed on the top of the stairs and he grinned even more, knowing that he was so close to getting what he wanted. He wrapped the invisibility cloak around him and leant against the wall, waiting for another student to either exit or enter the Gryffindor common room. He glared at the portrait of the Fat Lady, hoping the painting would open up soon.
“Yes,” said Harry simply. “This whole situation is just another child’s attempt at playing politician… another
The centaur didn’t answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale sapphires. He looked carefully at Neville, his eyes lingering on the scar which stood out, livid, on Neville’s forehead. “You are the Longbottom boy,” it stated and kept its blue eyes trained on Neville. “You had better get back to Hagrid. The Forest is not safe at this time – especially for you. Can you ride? It will be quicker this way. My name is Firenze,” he said as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that Neville could clamber on to his back.
“Malfoy think?” Fred and George said in unison once again.
!” replied Harry in a very child-like manner, he winced after he did it but held firm. “
Neville looked over towards Ron. “I reckon,” he said, thinking back to the moment. “D’you remember when she came up to us, looking as if she had something to say?”
“And, let me guess, you got a small cut on your arm and now you’re pleading abuse?” said Harry. “Please, Greengrass, I’m not thick. You’re not going to guilt trip me into feeling sorry for you.”
“Well, not for long,” said Hermione in a satisfied tone. “The Polyjuice Potion’s nearly ready. We’ll be getting the truth out of him any day now.” She lifted her head when she heard both Neville and Ron acknowledge her and lowered her voice, whispering, “I overheard Professor McGonagall talking about Potter earlier on today.”
“Pretty advanced book for you,” sneered Flint, his large hands flexed tauntingly.
“That’s great,” said Neville. “I came here with Gran and Hagrid. They’re getting my supplies while I get my robes. Hagrid said he was going to get me a pet, he said that he had it lined up for ages!”
“He has found a host body?” asked Salazar, frowning. “This is not good news.”
“We’ve been saving up to buy our own shop,” said Fred, nodding at his twin brother. “We’ve been saving ever since our second year at Hogwarts.”
“Yeah, yeah.”
Ginny’s concerned expression could easily be mistaken for finding the diary, but it was about something else completely, something much worse. Neville had spoken to Tom! She had an idea, but didn’t like to use it was it was rather low and her brother would instantly agree with it, no matter what. “I saw Malfoy interested in it, maybe he stole it?”
“If you would go
They only just managed to get in the room and close it when Filch was in front of him.
“A picture?” asked Neville, looking at the small boy was he raised his camera hopefully.
This was originally attached to the previous chapter, but I decided to give it it's own experience and give it a little more detail. I do, however, apologise for the scattered chapter updates... life has been rather all over the place and I've been plotting and planning for the future parts in the series. I have also been trying to fix up some of the older chapters. Mainly grammar, as that's far from my strongest suit.
“Sure,” Blaise stood and followed them into the room.
“Hey, mate, I heard that you’re pretty smart,” said a rat like boy, his facial expression set into confusion. “Is that why you’re so pale? Because you don’t go outside at all?”
She mentally debated about telling Narcissa but decided against it. Harry wouldn’t mind, but she assumed he wasn’t embarrassed about it, especially with the way he glared at anyone who looked at him funny.
student?”
Narcissa watched Harry leave and then she snapped to Draco, who looked at her with a questioning glance, “you never told me he’s fidgety Draco.”
“Who cares,” said the same boy that first spoke. “You’re still cosying up to the sons and daughters of known Death Eaters. Even the Headmaster considers you a threat.”
“Mr Potter,” said Dumbledore with twinkling eyes. “Can we help you?”
“No, he’s my brother.”
He retaliated with enthusiasm, keeping Atieno on his toes, which was saying something considering Atieno had inhumane speed and could move and dodge faster than he could blink.
“I know that!”
“A Draught on ‘how to remove annoying ghosts from your potion classes’” Snape said firmly, Harry wanted to laugh but sat quiet, Draco smiled at him softly. Snape glanced up to see Draco smiling at Harry, for Snape this was nothing new, seeing as he had already read the letters from Lucius and Draco.
I wanted to change Divination so badly. I had so much plans for that class and then I realised that I literally couldn't. I tried to change it up, but damn is that professor a pain to write.
“You can start to treat him better now, get him on a detention and then talk it out with him. Apparently he likes detentions these days; he’s grown used to them or something.” Draco laughed.
Standing up straight, she sent the two boys one final stern look and huffed out, “Five points from Slytherin, each, for your tardiness.” She turned and made it back to the front before she said anything else. “You could earn that back, easily, if you behave in this classroom.”
“How do they know politics?”
Harry ignored him and focused on the Snitch, he could see Draco coming over, dodging and weaving bludgers. Draco finally it over and sandwiched Cedric, who then cursed and dived down, making Draco and harry slightly bump into each other. Both laughed and reached for the Snitch.
“You’re going to lose, which is –”
“Not Britain?” asked Lily, curious.
“I wonder if the Goblet takes into account of you wanting to participate,” he said. “Surely it can’t determine off a piece of paper. I never thought about it until now. What makes someone worthy?”
.” Harry hissed and then smiled.
“You’re a genius!” Hermione shouted, really close to Draco’s ear.
Harry was already sick of Weasley this and Weasley that. He heard Lavender Brown whisper something about the red-haired man as Weasley climbed onto the animal. A small part of him wanted to barge in and demand the thing show him respect, but he had more intelligence than that and knew it would backfire.
Harry glared, although it lacked the usual bite of his icy glare. “I’m not refusing anything,” he muttered. “I’m perfectly fine to just stay here and see if anyone else will take the time to save me. Maybe I just like sitting on sharp rocks?”
“Why?” said Ernie, confused. “I mean, I know you want to challenge yourself, but thirteen classes? How do you have time to do anything else?”
“So, where did we end up?”
“What you said was true, wasn’t it Lucius?” Narcissa smirked as Lucius turned.
Everyone scattered and picked up their robes that were conveniently hung on a hook on the far wall.
“I suggest you take some time, perhaps a few years, and mull it over,” said Professor Snape. “You do not want to rush potions in any sort. Rushing causes mistakes. As you are aware, even the slightest bit of progress could mean a successful potion or a complete failure.”
“Miss. Parkinson! Your turn.”
“Do leave the trees be,” said the druid. “When I said not to use any area of effect spells, I assumed that would also translate to not destroying the environment.”
“Becoming the Minister for Magic is a large ambition, Mr. Potter,” said Dumbledore with a slight smile. He was not going to comment on the second option at all. “What about you, Mr. Weasley?”
“What’s what?”
“It’s Sunday, I’ll have you know. It’s a day of
“– maybe because he knows I’m right, or because I’m putting his precious Golden Boy behind in classes,” continued Harry as if Professor Snape said nothing. “Also, Draco is the vain one, have you seen how much time he spends on his hair? Salazar aid me if one strand of his hair is not neatly in position.”
“I know, it was such a shock to learn that a knock around the head caused him to lose all his memory, but at least it was when he was diving into the Chamber of Secrets to save students,” said Harry, giving Justin a sad look. “I’m glad you’re fine now. You missed a fair bit, isn’t it lucky that the exams were cancelled?”
Harry smiled and then glanced at Draco. “I wonder if I –”
“Hold it afloat, three inches off the tabletop,” said Harry, pulling his wand from his sleeve. “Go on, hold it afloat for two minutes.”
James waved off his son’s dramatics. “Anyway,” he said, addressing the rest of the room. “The good news is that we’ve figured out who escaped and their possible location.”
“What’s the Triwizard Tournament?”
Harry sat in the office of the headmaster, a scowl on his face, listening to Longbottom ramble on about his Chamber and what happened in it. Fawkes had got them out of the Chamber in record speed, sadly, it took Lockhart as well, and they appeared in the Headmaster’s office. It hadn’t taken long for the Weasley family to come and whisper words of encouragement to their son and daughter, who had been given treatment by Madam Pomfrey and told sadly that the cut on her face would scar.
“The very one,” Hagrid laughed. “I have a few essays to mark, why not drop down by the hut later on and we’ll catch up?” Hagrid smiled.
Hermione’s head swivelled around so fast to glare at Neville that she was amazed it didn’t crack. “You’re all as bad as each other,” she said. “It all doesn’t add up, Neville, it just doesn’t… maybe we should just go to Professor Dumbledore?”
Professor Snape’s eyes widened.
“I’m not Mum and Dad,” said Liza. “Ya daan’t need ter speak ter me loike I’m Jack's Alive. Ya Iron Hoof.”
“Mr. Potter, are you aware of how ridiculous that story is?”
Draco gently rubbed his head, “I assume they’re in the wardrobe, Harry.”
: Growing Up (part II)
“There’s plenty wrong with that family,” sneered Harry. “Wizards shouldn’t be poor, we’re powerful land yet they act like common Muggles.”
“Err – well – it’s not terribly – I mean – well – all right,” stammered Professor Lockhart. He opened the door and watched as the two Gryffindors entered.
“I’ll go next time, Draco,” said Harry. “My form is signed so I can go no matter what, but I want to sit this one out. Maybe use this time to play a joke on me for the next Hogsmeade weekend. I promise I’ll attend the next one with you.”
“You see, I want to completely forget something, something rather disturbing you see. I did debate locking it behind an Occlumency wall, but I’m not sure how to do it, as much as admitting that pains me.”
“Tha’s it,” said Hagrid, his tone somewhat proud. “Tha’s it, Ron… now, bow…”
“That’s not how they will see it,” he said. “You’re holding the murder weapon, not that there is one, and that’s all they will see. Any argument you have, they will counter, and then they will use you as a scapegoat to hide the whole ordeal and say that it’s dealt with and that wizarding Britain is, once again, safe.”
Lucius tapped the corner of his lips, “and your power will return?”
Lily was in her first year when Narcissa was in her fifth, not only were the two in different Houses, but they hardly even spoke, seeing as Lily’s Muggleborn status ran rampant almost instantly, with a name such as Evans, some doubted that she was Muggleborn, and instead that she was from the Evans line that was from France.
Harry tuned out the rest of the speech and grinned at Granger, knowing that she would be horrified that she couldn’t use books to achieve easy grades. He turned back to the professor and caught the tail end of something intriguing.
“Harry leaves nothing to the imagination does he? Imagine coming out here in a t-shirt and just his briefs, the nerve!”
The sound of crashing echoed throughout the small office that belonged to Filch, making the said man stop speaking and narrow his eyes as he glanced around. The ceiling of the office shook, which made the oil lamp rattle.
The beeping intensified, letting him know that the person came through regardless and was now in his house. ‘If that’s Dumbledore, I swear to Merlin,’ he thought as he turned off the burner, knowing his potion was already ruined. ‘Someone owes me thirty-two Galleons.’
Harry gave an awkward head nod and rushed back into the kitchen, his eyes fell on the small dining table and his mouth opened before he closed it. It appeared that Mopsy went above and beyond and decided to set the table while she cooked the meal. He glanced at each sitting spot and realized that it was perfect for how the Dursleys ate. “Mopsy, this is perfect,” he whispered under his breath.
“But nothing,” said Harry. “Stop doing all the research for Longbottom while he’s off having fun with Weasley. He willingly put his name into the Goblet – it’s impossible to fool it or tamper with it. He needs to live up to his actions and not have people jump in front of things for him. Consequences and all that. Anyway, Granger, wasn’t it you that said the whole point of the Tournament was international magical cooperation? We’re cooperating.”
He never understood why the man had so much knowledge and looked like he couldn’t afford to purchase a book or afford a house. The fact that the Weasley’s looked richer than someone made him highly curious.
“You didn’t mean that, did you Ron?” asked Hermione, her eyes slightly wide. “Please tell me you didn’t.”
Naturally, the rumours about Harry overpowering Snape were heavily exaggerated, and spun into lies about the situation, of course the lies originated from the Hufflepuff table. Harry was asleep at the Slytherin table, they moved the food from around him and let him rest, Draco cast a silencing charm around him so no one could hear him snore, and Blaise thought it was cute.
“That surprised me.”
Draco stood up, “Expelliarmus!”
The dog barked.
“If I remember right, it’s ‘cos they contact the captains,” said Harry, screwing up his face in thought. “They like to see if the player was cooperative, respectful, and all that nonsense. It’s nothing more than to see if the person is a good fit.”
“Right.”
A few more students had trickled in, seeing the Duelling Pit in use. As Slytherins, they would seize anything they could that could give them an advantage over their peers. Knowing their signature spells and duelling style would help with confrontations. You could learn a lot by watching and most Slytherins attempted to do just that.
“I have no decent way to say it,” said Harry. “Honestly, I cannot think of a better way that would suit both worlds.”
A man with pure white robes and soft light-brown hair was hovering over the screaming boy with something with shock filling his eyes. It took all but a second before he snapped back into Healer mode and barked orders at his secretary to fetch potions and start preparing the small boy for his treatment. “Alright, Harry,” he soothed, his tone soft and gentle, “you’ll be fine.”
Harry nearly jumped as he twisted and saw the same police officer as before strut into the room. “I’m fine, just a bit startled,” he muttered as a small chocolate bar was pushed into his hands and a warm cup of cocoa followed. “Thanks.”
“I think you offended him,” said Lily with a slight chuckle. She watched her son sweep from the room in a very Severus-like fashion. “Upsetting the birthday boy before its even lunchtime, you just have to set records.”
“Anything!” said Harry, grinning.
“That’s so convoluted,” said Draco. “More so than usual.”
Snape broke the spell and grinned to himself, “Harry, how do you forget to say that you love Draco?”
“If you’re sure,” said Draco, looking around. “When are we gonna do it?”
would push their nose into.
“Because, if you had been listening to anything I have been saying, he has been alive for quite some time,” said Severus, sighing. “Albus is aware of his return, but there is not much we can do while the Dark Lord is hiding under the Fidelius Charm. I have no doubt the Secret Keeper is locked inside of his dungeons and is only allowed out to pass on the secret to a select few. What you have done is more important than rumours.”
God, he never would dare admit that he was thankful for finally seeing that stupid, wobbly looking house, but he was. It was a sanctuary, of sorts. His feet were sore, mainly his ankles. It was a painful and a not so fun experience.
“The first task will begin momentarily,” said a voice. “You will be allowed to bring in your wand and that is it. Clothing will be provided for you. If you are dumb enough to attempt to intentionally bring in anything else, there will be
“This is stupid,” said Draco, walking up the corridor. “What is Nott trying to do? I can’t understand what’s driving him to make us prank other students. Pranking is pathetic.”
“Well?”
Harry clapped and stared at Draco with a triumphant grin, his eyes filling with satisfaction. Of course, his satisfaction dimmed when he had to listen to more students that he hardly cared about.
“Big bad Gryffindor, you’re such a brute, you couldn’t hit me, and after all you know what my punch feels like.”
Harry sat in the brightly lit dining room, which had been his morning routine for the better part of the summer holidays. He ignored the slightly crackle of the fire and the gloomy clouds that lurked in the sky, despite the fact that it should be clear weather. He spied a familiar look owl flying towards the dining room with what appeared to be a package tied to its leg. He knew it was a school owl, there was no one else that would write at this time and send along a package that held letters. He watched, amused, as the owl flew in and sat on one of the chairs, avoiding the table as if it would turn into fire and burn it.
Tom laughed loudly. ‘
Rosier almost walked into Harry’s back and before he could ask why he saw the large stone statue walking around. “What – what in the hell is that!”
“Why not just use Legilimency on her?” said Susan, not even bothering to mask her surprise at the fact the twelve year old next to her knew such a rare talent that most wizards spent two or more decades to just learn the basics. “The entire school knows that you’re a capable Legilimens, which is rather odd and unique for a person your age, but I’m not going to argue.”
“That’s not funny!”
“You mean it?”
“Yes,” he asked, still staring at her. “I hope you have a good reason to seek me out in public like this. It was you, after all, who said we shouldn’t be seen together.”
“Mind what?”
The issue with that was that witches and wizards would be unable to advance like the Muggles were. They were a little behind, but that was more of a preference. If you looked at it with a careful gaze, you would see that, in a sense, the magical populace was above Muggles.
“Hardly.”
“Potter, Harry!” called Professor McGonagall.
Pansy stared at Harry like she was ready to fling a curse at him, “because you’re a friend I won’t hex you, but that’s your only warning. However, you owe me a favour that I will take and claim whenever I want.” Pansy smiled with a devilish grin on her face, she didn’t even notice Draco sneak a hand into her candy bag and steal some. At least until she saw him chewing.
“Because it is the only book on Inferi in the United Kingdom that refers to them as Inferius when there is only one of them,” said Albus. “I know this, Mr Potter, because I wrote the book with an old friend of mine. I assume you did not look at the author.”
,” hissed Harry, eyeing the snake carefully. “
Harry’s spell beam neared Dumbledore, Harry was putting more power into his spell than Dumbledore, which explained why he tired quicker, Dumbledore just didn’t realize. Harry shoved one last push of power into the beam and then cut his spell, allowing for Dumbledore’s spell to push the momentum fully into Harry.
Severus was watching the very small group argument with a keen eye. It really couldn’t be called an argument, because no one was screeching or shouting or even throwing curses, but still, it had the aura of an argument. The entire thing was nothing but tense.
Once more, Lily remained dead quiet and decided to just let the Dark Lord ramble on, as he seemed inclined to be doing.
Ginny let out a laugh, “suspended, apparently he thought it wise to call Seamus a ‘filthy faggot who does nothing but suck dick all day’ while McGonagall was behind him. Three week suspension at home with mum, if she finds out what he said I doubt Ron will return.”
“But you didn’t like it.”
“LIAR!”
Harry opened his eyes and was greeted by Draco, who had a fearful look in his eyes, his sleek black wand pressed directly against his nose. He blinked twice and wriggled his nose, trying to dislodge the wand from it. He knew that Draco would never attack him and that he was safe as one can be yet the wand never budged and the double blink, something they had devised when they were younger as a secret code hardly made his friend budge.
“He’s wearing a purple jumper –”
Harry ignored them and glared at the table, ignoring the laughter from both of them. ‘Gits!’ he thought, wondering why the table wasn’t catching fire, which would at least be a distraction. Where was Quirrell with a troll? A Hurricane? Tornado? Something!
“Yes,” said Harry. “Now, let’s get back to planning as I have things to do.”
Harry sat with Draco on his left and Rosier on his right, his eyes glancing around the table, searching for one particular treat and when he didn’t see it he scowled at the table and muttered threats about burning it under his breath. “This is a waste of a feast.”
Harry stepped out of the car almost shaking; Draco followed him and led him to the bathroom. He made Harry close his eyes so he wouldn’t see the house before the official tour started. Draco stood outside the door and listened to Harry gasp at the bathroom, the
“I didn’t mean it like that,” barked Nott. “I meant, what if you exploit the situation and turn it onto another House. Gryffindor.”
“One day, Draco, I will have the entire Slytherin house listening to my every word with anticipation and delight,” said Harry, as if repeating a rehearsed speech. “I’m a born leader, Draco, not a follower. I’m twelve, though, and the fifth, sixth and seventh-years will not listen to a twelve year old, no matter what I do and try.”
Draco shifted his hands around Harry’s waist, ignoring all innuendos of brooms and anything of the sort. “Alright,” he said simply, the only word that came to his mind as he slipped his hands just below Harry’s.
Neville waited for a minute in case he came back, then, quietly as he could, slipped out of the cabinet, past the glass cases and out of the shop door. He had emerged into a dingy alleyway that seemed to be made up entirely of shops devoted to the Dark Arts. The one he’d just left, Borgin and Burkes, looked like the largest, but opposite was a nasty window display of shrunken heads, and two doors down, a large cage was alive with gigantic black spiders. Two shabby-looking wizards were watching him from the shadow of a doorway, muttering to each other. Feeling jumpy, Neville set off, hoping against hope he’d be able to find a way out of there.
Lucius snorted and said nothing, especially when he received a glare from Harry. “You two boys have fun, I have one more errand to run and then I’ll meet you back here,” he said, slipping away from the crowd of females and two boys that just started.
curious.”
to be a Chaser and you said
“I like how you say my name,” said Vaisey, smiling. “And accepting my balloons is well enough for me, Harry.”
Harry chuckled and turned his focus back towards the game, primarily Longbottom. He knew that the game would be over soon, especially when Longbottom changed direction and soared downwards, chasing the Snitch.
“Yes.”
The issue with Longbottom was that while he was self-trained, Longbottom was taught by a slew of different witches and wizards before he even set foot in the castle. He knew that Dumbledore, his mother, James, the Weasleys, a few Aurors that blindly followed Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix members had somewhat trained Neville Longbottom. The boy wasn’t an overachiever and was comfortable by still passing, but the boy was gifted in magic.
“Draco has given him the potion, as you can tell by Harry’s soul slowly flickering, it resembles something I did a while ago, except a little different.” Voldemort paused, “Harry Potter will become the biggest threat since my first rise to power, and no one will suspect it. Not even Dumbledore, if he is trained and tutored right… of course.” Voldemort glanced at Lucius.
1) I apologise for the delay. I really do. Nearly two months for somewhat of a lacklustre chapter that is designed to further the plot much later on. I realised very early on that this chapter would be my test. I knew that writing from the point of view of James would cause me some grief. I got more than I expected. I will never again do this. James sees the world differently to Harry, yet I needed to keep the format the same. It was a headache that caused me to rewrite every paragraph three or four times.
“Longbottom is a second-year with a mediocre grasp on magical theory,” said Harry, squinting at Weasley, trying to find a fault. “This is the second time that she has been the last person to arrive at the attacks… even behind her friends and family.”
“Excuse me!” She walked coolly towards the Prefects and smiled.
“What do we want, Fred?” said Fred, smirking.
“What was that?”
Harry had seen them before, when they first entered the dungeons, they were slithering about and hissing about the new students.
“So, you knew it was me?”
“Then it was a troll, after the chess challenge, which had already been dealt with and all you had to do was sneak by its corpse, and then the second last room, which is my favourite, potions.”
“Did Harry do anything odd in the store?” asked Mr. Weasley. “Did he touch anything or be drawn to anything at all?”
“Of course not, Professor Quirrell is just the worst of the complaints that I have,” said Harry glancing towards the headmaster. “There’s Professor Hooch, or whatever her proper title is, she has no idea how to actually use a broom and her teaching methods are as questionable as Professor Quirrell’s. Don’t even get me started on the fact that there is no inter-house unity, why a fifth-year Gryffindor is able to openly mock and torment a second-year Slytherin with no consequence by Professor McGonagall, who was standing directly behind the exchange, is beyond me.”
“If we go to the Ravenclaws first, who’ll go to the Hufflepuffs?” said Harry, continuing on from the old topic. “Ravenclaws admire knowledge, we easily have that.”
“No harm?” repeated Petunia. “Families would be torn apart!”
Narcissa walked into Harry’s room who was sitting on the bed with a book in his lap.
“Come on, Harry – oh – its Selene now – you must embrace this opportunity.”
Professor Snape looked at Draco curiously for a moment. “You’re here to escort Mr. Potter back to the common room when he finally admits to stealing –”
Harry glanced at the blank page and gently turned it, revealing another blank page. “How?” he asked, staring at the diary. He turned another, and another, and another, all revealing blank pages. “How is the diary blank?”
“I promise,” said Harry, holding his hand over his heart. “I used to cook with mother when I was younger. We’d make breakfast together and it was a massive hit and no one got food poisoning. It’ll be fine, but I do have one condition.”
He sighed in relief as something broke down the door, somewhat glad that Draco could no longer continue debating, which he planned to as he had been in the middle of opening his mouth. He stood up, picked up his wand, held it lightly, and tossed Draco his with his left hand.
“I was friends with a Slytherin as a Gryffindor.”
“I assume it did no harm, he could pick one up and throw it – not that he would, of course – and the snake would slither back to his side and just sit there.”
Harry slowly placed his index finger against his closed eye. He could feel a headache coming on and he knew that he was far too young to be getting regular headaches at the petty arguments of other children. “Can you just go stand over there, Longbottom? Your mere presence is practically headache inducing.”
Harry reached into his robe pocket and pulled out a letter. “Could you please take this to mother?” he asked, handing it over. “After that, you may do what you were doing previously.”
“Because I have common sense.”
Harry nodded, “theirs also one more thing, Dumbledore.”
Still, he had many questions about it as it sort of came from nowhere. It looked like something Longbottom would have a hand in, but it lacked anything that would warrant the touch of the boy. It was a dilemma that started to hurt his head.
“No, you dolt, they’re
Neville jerked his head towards the dormitory door and Ron followed him out, unaware of the invisible person following closely behind. They hurried back down to the Gryffindor common room, which was half-empty, and joined Hermione, who was sitting alone, reading a book called
Neville was about to speak when he heard Fang howl and then yelp. “What’s going on Fang?” he asked, petting to distraught animal. “Hagrid won’t be gone forever.”
“I have heard a few professors call him a Potions prodigy, mainly due to the teaching of his mother, but surely that’s it, right?” said Hermione, looking rather concerned. “Honestly, it’s just not fair! How long has he had an advantage over me?”
“Sorry, professor, my hearing’s not as good as it used to be from where the stone statue hit me.”
James gave a shrug, slipping his fingers out of his son’s mouth, and looked at his wife carefully. “You know, he hasn’t attacked mindlessly for a while, these case reports – they’re too well organized – no blood was spilled, nothing.” He rolled his eyes when his son grasped a handful of his hair, he tilted his head so his son didn’t rip chunks out. “It’s not exactly a bad thing, Lily, trust me on that.”
Students flocked towards the Great Hall, almost being late and sat down Harry and Draco walked in together but split up to sit at their respective tables. Harry sat far away from Ron, it wasn’t that he was scared of him, well maybe partially as Harry cannot stand up to him physically and Ron could beat him easily, Harry’s only option was to use magic. Harry began a soft conversation with Ginny and Hermione; the three chuckled softly which caused Ron to snort in their direction.
Ron looked at the box with shock, for a brief second Harry thought he was going to faint, “those letters seem familiar, even more the last one.”
“We would like to see Professor Dumbledore,” said Hermione, pushing all her confidence outwards, not wanting to appear weak in front of their Head of House.
“You’re a Slytherin,” said Robin. “You should be thrilled at someone else getting blamed for something.”
“You may only use
Professor McGonagall shook her head and walked away before she was drawn into a discussion about manliness. The worst thing about what Harry had said was the fact that it was something that James would say, except maybe a little different.
“Hello!” said Neville in a friendly tone, ignoring the fact they all flinched the moment he spoke. He ignored the slowly rising anger that he felt and just smiled. “I’m actually looking for Justin Finch-Fletchley, I – uh – need to speak with him about something.”
“Where’s your pet snake?” asked Draco, quickly changing the subject. “I haven’t seen her since you got here.”
“The Gryffindor and Slytherin feud,” said Lily, shaking her head. “You know, the whole feud about those two Houses not getting along due to some silly reason. Something about it being impossible for a Gryffindor and a Slytherin to be friends because they are complete opposites.”
“Alright,” said Harry. “I don’t really know any spells that cause area damage…”
“– pacing –”
: Dedication!
“Like?” said James, leaning forwards. “I’m curious on what you’ve heard.”
“That makes sense, I guess. Do you know anything about the Potter family tree?”
“In memory of two students who departed the world far too soon. While they may be gone, their spirit and impact on Hogwarts remains,” he said, sliding his finger over the metal. “Stephen Gardner, fourteen, Hufflepuff… a kind, forgiving wizard that wanted to change the world. Edward Reid, fourteen, Ravenclaw… studious, brave, everything that all young men should aspire to be.”
,’ said Tom, a hint of amusement filled his voice. ‘
“I did what I had to do,” said Harry, tapping his chin as he thought. “Maybe if you actually cared about your sister, you’d have noticed the signs that she wasn’t alright. Granger could’ve gone into her room and seen if she was alright, but she didn’t. I’m sure you would have just allowed her to leave, possessed by Voldemort or not.”
“Yes, Draco, I see them,” said Harry, yawning into his hand. “Fighting books? How quaint.”
“Yes,” said Harry without a trace of emotion in his voice. “You can dislike me all you wish for doing that, but I stand by my decision. If I had remained, I would have been spotted and the Stone would have been destroyed.”
“Come to think about it, it sounded as if he was arguing with someone, someone young… a distressed first-year, perhaps. Honestly, the conversation was about the Chamber of Secrets and how Granger was a Muggle-born and in danger or something,” said Harry, shrugging. “Aside from that, I spent a majority of the day with the Slytherin Quidditch team, asking about the Bludger and if any of them did it – not that any of the professors seemed to care that a Bludger was charmed to attack a student relentlessly.”
“I don’t care,” snapped Harry. “Get out of my way.”
“Oh, he knows it was an accident,” said Salazar. “He also knows that you showed no emotion or remorse and then, not even two minutes later, attempted to use that situation to further your own silly political agenda. He may not believe you are a threat and a dark wizard in the making, he knows that you are a contender and
Harry was peering around the field for the Snitch, while keeping a close eye on the Weasley twins, he let his vision slip for a mere second and he lent back just as a Bludger flew mere inches from his face, he felt the material of the Bludger scrape his face. His eyes instantly darkened and he turned to face the twins with a dangerous glint in his eyes, a challenging smirk hit his face and he silently dared them to try it again. He hovered near the commentators box and observed Longbottom, he wasn’t do very much at all, just watching everyone else, getting pathetic enough to do a loop-the-loop when Gryffindor scored. He glared at Longbottom openly for about twenty second and then he saw it, he saw what he had hoped would happen to the idiot.
Harry watched as Peter edged around him, circling him as if he were injured prey. Listening to the man ramble on about his master and how he could have easily poisoned his bottle of milk was somewhat amusing. “Hey, Peter,” he said, interrupting the man’s ramblings. “How does it feel to be reduced to your current position by the Dark Lord? I mean, you’re essentially nothing but a babysitter.”
“Try and find Draco, and hurry about it, check Dumbledore’s office first then mine.”
Lily watched him leave, the moment the pop from the Disapparition occurred she let out a very small sigh and closed the front door, aware that her son was now awake and staring at her with his baby blue eyes. Slipping past her curious son, she made her way towards the bookshelf and allowed her hand to blindly hover before striking at a book, which made Harry laugh.
Harry snorted. “
,” said Harry after a few seconds of silence. “
“Speech” | ‘Thoughts’ | ‘
“But why Hufflepuffs?” said Draco, not exactly caring about politics and positions in the Ministry when this issue was about the school.
Nagini glanced around the room, looking at the humans and the humans that were flat and slithered onto Harry. “
McGonagall motioned for Draco to stay where is, but he ignored and snuck around towards them, Harry shot Draco a concerned look, the tears still pouring down his cheeks and dripping on the floor.
Theodore lifted his head and stared at Harry. The question came after a moment of silence and it startled him slightly. “No,” he said softly, “and not many still do, depending on who asks and for what purpose. The first lesson pure-bloods learn is about blood, which leads into family and history about the family. Among pure-blood lines, family is important, that’s about all that’s taught these days.”
“I’m sorry Harry, but once you’re in a house, you’re stuck there.” Dumbledore picked up a lemon drop and offered one to Harry.
Ron examined the lock on the door. “We’re looking for a big, old-fashioned one – probably silver, like the handle.”
The group of professors slowly advanced. Before they could do anything a light shot from Harry Potter’s wand and flung the troll backwards. The beast stumbled on its legs before it fell in a lump on the ground.
“Ten.”
Harry entered the classroom as he normally would, not trying to draw any attention or move as if he was sneaking. He knew that Professor Moody could see through walls – something that forever remained in his mind on whether the man could control how far to see or when to stop if he simply saw everything. He also realised, quite disturbingly, that the professor would see people when they were showering or in the bathroom.
Eleven o’clock came around faster than Harry expected. He had changed into his Quidditch gear and smiled at the green on his uniform, which almost fit his eyes perfectly. The entire school seemed to be sitting in the stands scattered around the Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars to see the game better, despite the stands being rather high, the game was fast paced and was hard to keep up with.
“Did you see that?” said Neville, excited. “I think I did it!”
“Must just be the light,” said Vasily, shrugging. “Maybe it could be due to your face shape and general size. You’re not short, but you’re not tall, either.”
Harry felt lightheaded but remained upright as he studied the much smaller version of the druid. He actually had no idea what he wanted to discuss, he just wanted to see if the spell would work. He stared at the druid, wondering if it was the same one that he just spoke to. He opened his mouth to speak but closed it when he realised the druid was speaking.
Draco raised his eyebrows, “you really should look up instead of at the floor Harry, and it’ll stop you from walking into people.” Draco chuckled and pulled Harry up.
And so the explanation of Harry’s father being Head Auror began and he watched as the youngest Weasley, Ginny was her name if he remembered correctly, began to swoon over his father. Thankfully they didn’t gossip for too long and before he even knew it, they had moved towards the train and were staring directly at it.
“I do believe that I have come across something recently that you would be interested in,” said Atieno, pulling the still glaring boy along with him. “We shall allow the grump man a few moments of respite while I attempt to educate you once more.”
“I was not
“No, mother, I was in the library,” said Harry, studying his mother. “I lost track of time and I was just coming to collect my lunch.”
“Shoes on the wrong feet.”
demanding to be let in!”
Harry turned towards the voice and nodded. “Some players are playing on brooms that are at least ten years old and then we have people on brand-new brooms that go almost three times faster,” he said. “Of course, having an amazing broom does not instantly give you skill, but it is an advantage in the Seeker position.”
,” hissed Harry, studying the book with a less interested gaze.
“You cannot change your houses, it’s never been done before, why would you even want to changes houses?”
Snape took one look at Harry and decided he would get his revenge now. Snape stood, “Harry James Potter.” Snape said calmly, Harry didn’t budge and kept softly snoring to himself, Snape proceeded removed the silencing charm and amplified Harry’s voice, which caused his snoring to fill the Great Hall, even with the laughter Harry didn’t budge.
,” hissed Nagini as she turned her head towards Harry’s schedule that had been pinned on the wall.
Harry stilled, the explanation going against everything he knew. He was suddenly curious, slightly energised, and felt this calm breeze of radiance flowing through his very being. It was like his mind, body, and soul wanted him to continue the spell.
Harry shook his head and walked from the train with the rest of the first-years, he stuck to the group that was around Draco and avoided the Bow Who Lived, when he saw the boy he simply sneered at him and continued on his journey. He glanced up at the sky, which was slowly falling into dusk, the small part of the sun that remain was hidden by large trees. The only thing letting the students know that it was still day was that a steady glow of orange was trying to fight its way through the upcoming blackness. They looked around with a smile and then walked towards the other students, shoving them out of the way.
Hagrid was bustling around, making them tea. “So tell me what happened?”
“Ah, forget it. I’ll just talk to Crabbe; he actually appreciates what I have to say.”
The Boggart grew bigger and bigger until it was a towering monstrosity. The familiar looking troll swung its club, smashing the side wall in the process. Bits of debris and glass flew down towards the children.
I mean, it has to be Malfoy, who else would go to this much trouble just to annoy you? He’s had it out for you since the first year. He has made it his life goal to torment you, to make you fail and now he’s putting sexual things in your head and being the typical git he is. Just avoid him and you’ll be fine, he cannot keep it up for much longer.
“Thirteen and already getting into duels with goblins…”
“Would I like to try again,” mocked Harry, glaring. “No, I would not like to try to cast this stupid and useless spell again. When am I ever going to need some sort of sparkling protector? Never, that’s when. I don’t need to cast a Patronus because I’m never going to faint when I’m near one.”
“They’ll be fine, anyone want some tea while we wait?”
“Look, Harry, here comes Weasley!” said Draco, sitting forward. “Oh, it’s not
“Thank you, sir.”
‘He should be the one apologising,’ he thought, tapping his date on the arm. ‘It’s his fault.’
“I’m amazed you care so much for Harry, Lucius” Snape broke the silence.
‘Okay,’ thought Harry, tucking his head behind the pillar. ‘Longbottom has the Stone and that thing knew he had it, perhaps it wasn’t safe to continuously look around the pillar.’
“I’m sure that Draco will get over m abrupt disappearance,” said Harry calmly, his eyes betraying none of his inner thoughts. “Draco would cover for me, as he has before, if it’s for educational purposes, which I can easily tell him it was without revealing anything.”
Harry nodded along, already knowing these pieces of information. He wondered what the Potter Estate looked like. Thousands of questions flickered through his mind about it.
“Relying on others will only serve to weaken me, not strengthen me,” Harry all but hissed at the headmaster, already fed up with the direction of this conversation. “You only learned what you did about me by snooping and spying on me with that mirror, you then lied to my face about what you saw. Your greatest desire is personal, so now you know how I feel when you saw or heard what I saw in that mirror.”
“You didn’t make it!”
Marcus glanced around and lowered his voice to a whisper. “My father and his father were both powerful dark wizards, Potter. What are you getting at?”
,” hissed Nagini, dropping her head. “
“It’ll take your head off, Neville,” said George just moments after.
Draco glared at the ground and took a deep breath.
“I have an idea,” said Robin, blinking. “Well, I
“Dumbledore, what’s with the boxes?” Harry said while eyeing them.
Harry attempted to explain in simpler words and it had the same result.
,” hissed Nagini in a somewhat haughty manner, if that was even possible for a snake. “
Harry grinned, knowing full well that Lucius himself probably said worse things.
“Draco does love me, I know he does!”
“No,” said Harry. “I’ll not play a life-sized version of chess, even if I am at a grandmaster level.”
“That’s how much I thought of Draco, regardless soon enough a man distracted Bellatrix and they left, that’s when I was able to bring Draco to me and get him to apparate us out, well, I apparated us out, I just needed his help or I would have killed myself apparating.” Harry sighed, knowing this would continue on until everyone woke up, and he turned to Pansy who still had her arms wrapped around him in a friendly manner, “tell me a little bit about Draco?”
Harry, moving forwards at a careful rate, studied the books with trepidation, hoping that something hadn’t been released in Flourish and Blotts. Instead of the usual display of gold-embossed spellbooks the size of paving slabs, there was a large iron cage behind the glass which held about a hundred copies of The Monster Book of Monsters. Torn pages were flying everywhere as the books grappled with each other, locked together in furious wrestling matches and snapping aggressively.
“Hardly,” he replied as quickly and stoically as possible. “Some parents only have one child, but that hinders the growth of the wizarding world. Mine decided to either have two or three, which, if you knew basic maths, would cause the population to climb.”
Harry muttered something incoherent under his breath and finished his sandwich happily. His mother did know how to make a great sandwich, he would never deny her that compliment. He wasn’t sure if he should be as nervous as he was about going to Hogwarts, he was embarrassed to say that he wanted to avoid the train journey from King’s Cross to Hogwarts simply because it may ease the sheer amount of butterflies in his stomach, but he avoided it.
“Be quiet, Harry!” snapped Theodore, sounding far more tired than he was. “I swear to Merlin, Salazar and any other deity that is around that IU will end you if you continue to speak in that awful cheerful tone any longer. Let us sleep for at least thirty more minutes!”
“I can’t leave,” he said, repeating himself when Draco just stared at him. “Something isn’t letting me. There’s something I need to do…”
“Speech” | ‘Thoughts’ | ‘
“Harry my boy, do share the tale how you and Draco become closer!” Dumbledore said with a ripple of agreements reaching through the room, Snape disagreed instantly, not wanted to hear such trivialities.
“Rosier was sitting with me.”
Draco sighed and turned to face Blaise, “it’s his class Blaise, besides Quidditch it’s the one thing he enjoys doing here.”
“There’s a book in the Restricted Section that has a skull on it! When you pick it up and open it, a human face pops out of the pages and screams at you.”
“We think you’re that you’re the son of You-Know-Who – what’s so funny? Stop laughing!”
For the next few days, the Hogwarts rumour mill was in full force, causing a lot of students to gossip in the corridors, despite the threats of a detention. Different theories on the attacks were made and debunked on a daily basis. Most of the theories were centred on the Chamber of Secrets and the petrification of something living being required to open it. The school was abuzz with talk of Mrs. Norris, Filch’s cat, and her role in the opening of the Chamber of Secrets.
He knew that Draco wasn’t happy and maybe this was the reason why.
“– I believe it will take you around twenty minutes to complete and will test your knowledge with and without a wand,” said Professor Lupin. “For those that were zoned out or discussing their plans for the summer holidays, I shall repeat what I said. In the course, you will find and face a few creatures that you have learned about this year. None of the creatures will cause permanent harm. In case you have forgotten, you will face a Grindylow, a few Red Caps, a Hinkypunk, and a Boggart. Any questions?”
“Not even close,” said Harry. “There’s an oath, an agreement, a contract, and then the Unbreakable Vow. That’s in order of severity. Many people say that breaking an oath will cause you to lose your magic – they usually then add something like ‘so mote it be’ on the end because they’re ignorant and aren’t creative.”
“You can take a few books with you,” she continued, ignoring the slight anger that her son had. “Go on sweetie, go pick out a few books and I’ll put them in your trunk.”
Hermione shot up, “do you remember when Harry apparated the entire Weasley family away? That same day Ron and Harry came back fine, I assume love breaks the connection, even I know the only weakness dark items have is love, so all Malfoy has to do is show Harry some kind of love?”
’ she thought and pointed her duster at the Gryffindors. “Out! Two week ban from the library!” She looked at Harry and gave him a sympathetic smile. “You’ll have some peace and quiet in here now, Mr. Potter. Now trot off and get your nose fixed, I’ll speak to Professor McGonagall about her students and see if I can get some points removed.” She ushered the boy out and smiled as he complimented her library as he left, he was such a caring boy, and she knew that Slytherins may be cunning, but she knew one hundred percent that he was genuine in what he had said.
“In Knockturn Alley,” said James. “You don’t appear impressed. Under the most recent law, one I had no actual say in, the Minister forcefully removed all Floo connections to Knockturn Alley to prevent criminals escaping through the Floo and landing in a safe haven where they couldn’t be pursued. The only way to enter Knockturn Alley is through one entrance, which is watched night and day.”
(See the end of the chapter for
It was as though somebody had just flicked a light on in his brain. “Ron, this is it. This is the answer. The monster in the Chamber’s a basilisk – a giant serpent! That’s why I’ve been hearing that voice all over the place, and nobody else has heard it. It’s because I understand Parseltongue…”
Hermione let out a great sigh and Neville, amazed, saw that she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing.
Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled, “yes Harry?”
“I do believe that there’s more important things to address, for now, why don’t you tell me what happened at the Duelling Club, Neville?” said Dumbledore, still wafting the bowl of treats. “I do urge you to try one, Neville, they’re fantastic –”
“Of course!” said Harry, nudging the notes towards Ernie. “That way all of you can read them, except you, Smith, as you’re too stuck up to take my notes.”
“Failure.”
“Speech” | ‘Thoughts’ | ‘
thought about long and hard on, curious whether it could be a big deal that a gay man was working here. We eventually came to the conclusion that if someone cried about men bathing their daughters, then people would complain about a gay man bathing their child.”
“Should I be?”
Neville gaped for a moment. “And you mean this map shows everyone?”
“– there’s a spell on the train that automatically goes off the moment the train is stationary or suffers any damage,” said Harry. “It alerts the Headmaster of Hogwarts, who would then pass the alert onto the Aurors. The fact that they attempted to derail the train makes sense now. Whether they’ll all run or stay and fight is anyone’s guess, but I’m sure we’ll have a good seat.”
“You are using one of my many quotes,” said Severus, stalking around the room like a predator. “You failed to include the most important part of that quote. Recite the whole thing to me.”
“Indeed,” said Harry, his facial expression softened slightly and he gave a smile. “You have a very lovely home, Mrs. Dursley.” He peered through the door as he did so and looked around the entrance room, or hallway, as it was called in the Muggle world and forced himself not to scowl at the overuse of picture frames, nor the overbearing floral wallpaper.
Sorry for all the PoV shifting. :D
“A more recent innate talent turned learnable is the Patronus Charm,” said Atieno. “It was once considered something from the soul and therefore you either could do it or you could not, which is why the spell is considered to be advanced.”
“You don’t need one.”
“Don’t look so pleased with yourself,” said Harry. “I’m just putting on shoes and then I’ll be finished.”
Harry twisted his head to try and find out where the voice had come from.
Dumbledore joined them, “do you remember our talk we had earlier Harry?”
“Narrows it down slightly.”
“That’s because everyone loves and adores me,” sniffed Pansy. “Maybe someone complained or the staff are going through an annual revaluation.”
I want to try and avoid spoilers, but this is the chapter where I will be maimed. This isn't a happy chapter, so please forgive me.
“Madness?”
“We will talk about this later…”
“Yes, I just hope I’m not too late, and Molly can fix the situation…”
“Under the rug it goes,” cut in Harry. “Bet no one will even dare question why you lot stole ingredients, brewed an illegal potion, attacked two students and broke into the common room of another house.”
Harry made a noise that sounded slightly like agreement and stared at Ernie’s forehead, not that the boy noticed. He was confused on why that little smudge of ink annoyed him so much. He studied it and found his annoyance grow and grow the longer that he saw it sitting on the boy’s forehead, as if it was mocking him. The uneasy silence that hung in the air did very little to help him get over the issue of the ink.
“I don’t care if there was a massive party going on here, I never wanted to go inside!”
Hermione snorted. “No one will do what you do! Get it through your head.”
“Can Black be trusted?” asked Harry, looking at Salazar and Atieno with a curious expression. “I know that he’s a Black and all, but can he really be trusted with the information that you have an active portrait?”
Harry kept a very close eye on Wood and how he was acting during the match. The boy looked confused, angry, concerned and frustrated all at once. All four of those amplified when he realised that the Slytherin team was playing by the rules without a single foul in the ten minutes the game had been in progress.
The silence that lingered across the table that the three Potters were sitting at was almost unusual, especially for a ‘chatty’ family. Anyone that was watching, looking for gossip, would have a field day trying to figure out what stunned the entire table into silence.
Neville, who was nearest the door, got up to look into the corridor. All along the carriage, heads were sticking curiously out of their compartments.
‘Conversation,’ = Thoughts
“It’s still good that you got some information on him to keep his hands tied,” continued the Baron. “I must admit, though, I do dislike how you handled the situation. Threatening his pet will just come back on you if something happens.”
A lot of stores sold handcrafted objects that were the highest of quality, made with meticulous care and adoration. Each book has a spell cast individually on it instead of a group casting, making the spells last longer and protect the book far more easily.
. That was his Chamber and she would never remember the day she set foot inside of it. He would wipe it from her mind and leave nothing besides the fact that she plotted and acted alone on Greengrass. She would take the fall to ease his nerves.
“Oh, Mistress Narcissa!” wailed Mopsy the moment she entered the room, her small hands tugging on her ears. “Mopsy has done bad, very bad!”
“If you’re not trying, what’s to say that I am?”
Harry turned with a smile and walked in the opposite direction, his mind trying to find a place where the spell would be located. There were very few who had spent more time in the library than him and he would feel quite inept if he had missed a hiding place or some sort of secret spell scribbled underneath a shelf. Despite his doubts, he knew that Weasley had not been lying due to how shocked and sincere he had been. Looking under a shelf would be much easier to avoid suspicion because he was already known for peering intensely at books before reading them or disregarding them. Sneaking a quick peek at the underneath would be one of the easiest things he could do.
a Boggart?”
“Oh.”
“You mean Pansy Parkinson, the one from Slytherin?”
“Hmph.”
Lily was upset that her son was nearly hit with a Bludger, not caring about what had happened with the match.
“Sure yer are,” said the boy, puffing his chest out. “Come ‘ere ter have a gawk at the bloomin’ poor kids, init? Poke fun, laugh, right, and lift yor chin up. ‘Oo’d want ter ‘ave a look ‘round ‘ere. It’s a mess. They call us ‘the bloody wizardin’ zoo’, they do.”
“Yes, but I’m scared that would complicate what Draco and I have.”
“I did tell you, Draco, I told you when we were younger,” said Harry, uncertain. It was a half-truth, he had informed Draco that it would be cool and awesome if he could speak to snakes, seeing how Draco would react. Like he predicted, even at his young age, Draco reacted poorly and stated that he wouldn’t want it for all the Galleons in Gringotts.
“You’ll always remain ignorant and irrelevant. When I saw you on the train I assumed you would be intelligent enough to gather the facts and apply it to situations, but a month with the pathetic Weasley and the failure of a wizard known as Longbottom has reduced your intelligence by half.”
“I assume that’s you Hermione, no one else knocks.”
“My father was an exceptional duellist.”
“I don’t blame you,” said the Healer, gesturing the couple to follow him. “Your son is still be prepared and will be for a few more minutes, so let’s go have a cup of tea and then I’ll bring you back and you can see him.”
“I heard what happened!” said Gemma, cutting off Harry. How dare that boy even think about hitting you? Do you want me to hex him? I know a few good ones, as I said earlier this year.”
“I’m going to the library to see if I can find anything on Nicolas Flamel, I can assure you he has a few books on him, I just cannot remember why he’s even known,” said Harry with a lazy flick of his wrist. “I need to clear my head regardless, I’ll be back before curfew.”
“Potter seemed adamant that one existed,” said Hermione. “If anyone would know – at least in the school – it would be him.”
Draco, who was still gaping, was speechless and unable to form a coherent sentence, let alone explain how that felt.
No sooner were they out of earshot than Draco burst into laughter. “Did you see his face, the great lump?” He turned to Harry. “That was glorious!”
He watched as the sun slowly rose, the light slowly brightened in the room allowing for his reading to become easier and less straining on his eyes. He flipped through the book at a rapid rate, already knowing most of the information already in the book, but actively looking for more about the Philosopher’s Stone. He realized that the so called three-headed dog wouldn’t be all that was defending the stone, in fact there was most likely traps by each professor guarding it or something of the likes.
out of it so I could make my future better. He created a spell at thirteen. Not even Snape did that and we know how gifted he was at spell creation.”
“Obliviate me.”
“Quiet!” said the cold voice. “Follow… us…”
“But why not join the feast afterwards?” said Professor Snape, prodding for more information as his black eyes glittering in the candlelight. “Why go up to that corridor?”
James watched as his wife picked up his tea and finished it off. “I’m sure he’s fine, Lily,” he said. “It’s Harry. He won’t harm himself in any way, especially not with potions and he cannot do magic and he knows that.”
“I can see it,” said Eleanor. “You don’t look
“How have we been near each other for days and I still don’t know your name?” said Harry. “It’s shocking, you know.”
“I’m not going to Hogsmeade this year,” said Neville, his shoulders slumped. “My Gran said that it was best if I avoided leaving the school grounds this year, even more so with Pettigrew on the loose. James almost signed it after convincing Gran that keeping me locked in the castle isn’t good for my health, but Lily put a stop to it.”
He turned towards the three witches and wizards standing there, instantly locking eyes with Albus Dumbledore, and adopted a pleading expression as he tried to mentally prepare his little speech, which he knew would come out in a panic.
Harry thought back to when Draco had said that these games barely took any time at all. His narrowed when he remembered that they supposedly took around thirty minutes. An hour had gone by, which had felt like an entire day. He sighed, feeling like he had been doing quite a lot of that during the past few days, and turned towards Draco, who was sitting on the edge of the bench. H stared for a few seconds before flicking his gaze back towards the match, just in time to see a Chaser drop a Quaffle.
Hagrid slowly walking up from the back wall where he was standing, not sure why he was asked to stand there. The group of first-years parted and allowed the tall man with his eyes slightly welled with tears. “I cannot believe this, ‘Arry?”
“Well, then, if you’re correct in that, he’s pretty much untouchable right now,” said James, lifting his head. “Speaking from the point of view from the law, Aurors can’t enter Knockturn Alley with the goal of apprehending someone, no matter what that person may be guilty of.”
“He thinks that the door is locked,” whispered Harry. “I think we should be safe in here.” He turned around and his mouth dropped wide open. For a moment, he was sure he’d walked into a nightmare – this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far.
He ignored the taunt from Grexle and narrowed his eyes, his forehead scrunching up in concentration as he gave a fierce jab forwards, hoping that the tip of the blade missed the small leather chest piece that the goblin was wearing.
Harry smiled faintly and walked over towards the far wall, which held rows upon rows of brand-new looking broomsticks. He picked up a broom and muttered the Levitation Charm and hovered it alongside him as he walked back towards Draco. “Climb onto my broom, Draco,” he said and smirked when Draco gave him an odd look. “I am not going to start the basics outside in the freezing cold. I’m going to explain it all in here and then we’ll go outside and do it.”
“No,” said Daphne with a soft sniff.
“Am I?” replied the Bloody Baron, a look of sorrow appeared on his ghostly face. “So I am.”
“Of course they aren’t,” said Hermione in a soft tone, as if she didn’t want to spook or startle the ghost. “I just wanted to show them how nice it is in here,” she waved vaguely at the dirty old mirror and the damp floor.
“Young,” said Jude. “Very young.”
Leporem - Charm
She nodded and walked off, confused about how she got there.
Peeves perked up.
“I always knew that Salazar Slytherin was a twisted old loony,” said Ron, his voice carrying over the soft discussion of other students, as he, Neville and Hermione fought their way through the teeming corridors at the end of the lesson to drop off their bags before dinner. “But I had no idea that it was him who started all this pure-blood stuff. I wouldn’t be in his house if you paid me. Honestly, if the Sorting Hat had tried to put me in Slytherin, I would have got the train straight back home.”
He bit the inside of his cheek, his eyes flicked towards the floor-to-ceiling window that caused the Slytherin common room to fill with a green glow and focused solely on that, not being able to not look at Draco was not a weakness, instead he was making sure that he didn’t crush the boy further than he already did.
“Anyway, to apologise, I got you a nice gift,” said Harry, reaching into his pocket. “I’ve been a bit of a prat and I’m stubborn. You did leave me to dance with Granger, though, which was an awful experience. She then claimed I was sexist against females and then I had to take a boy to prove her wrong.”
“What?” said Neville, his eyes rather wide.
“That’s because you won’t let them!” Harry sighed and flew away.
Chapter 14 –
A rumble, as though of distant thunder, told them that the feast had just ended. From either end of the corridor where they stood came the sound of hundreds of feet climbing the stairs, and the loud, happy talk of well-fed people; next moment, students were crashing into the passage from both ends. The chatter, the bustle, the noise died suddenly as the people in front spotted the hanging cat. Neville, Ron and Hermione stood alone, in the middle of the corridor, as silence fell among the mass of students, pressing forward to see the grisly sight.
“Now,” said the Master Mutilator, wincing slightly, “that will be your downfall,
“Checkmate,” said Draco with his expression grew even smugger, if that was even possible. “Well played, Harry.”
“Even if I didn’t tell you in words, I meant for you to find out. I was rather careless with how I used the ability, nor did I ever deny being one. You have to understand that I shared a talent with Voldemort, a talent I shouldn’t have. What would’ve happened if it got out that I was a Parselmouth?”
“No need to swear, Weasley,” chided Harry, grasping his wand loosely. He wondered what he should do and whether he should inform Longbottom that Dumbledore’s phoenix was staring at Riddle’s diary as if it was evil. “Get up, you fools! What kind of heroes do you think you are? Sitting on your butts while I do all the work, trying to save the world.”
“Wait,” said Harry, dropping the quill. “How’d Voldemort gain his followers if the system is monitored by the Head of House?”
“I think so,” said Lewis. “We all said where we wanted to go and then we got distracted by how young you looked.”
“Why do you call Draco, Draco and me Potter?”
“Why?”
“I said nothing to Granger, go ask her who made her cry.”
“Don’t be rude, Harry,” said Draco with a slightly scolding tone. “From what I have heard, he used to be the Muggle Studies professor and left to get some firsthand experience and something happened.”
“I have charmed it so it will return here; it will crumble in front of me.” Voldemort flicked a page in the book, “this is an interesting book Lucius, I’ll give you it when I’m finished reading it. Back on task, the amulet should work like the vial, it will grab the ghost Harry Potter and suck him into it, at the same time placing him into a stasis and freezing his memory, that’s all I have for now. I’ll owl you more when I learn it.”
Narcissa hid the blush, “who are your friends at Hogwarts?”
“Good job, let’s get this over and done with as soon as possible, before Severus catches on and has a fit.” Dumbledore held out his arm once again and Draco took it.
’ | “
Blaise’s heart jumped a beat, “no Harry, I tend to find dating here is a nuisance because you have to bring the girl in the male dormitory, and unless you have your own room like Draco and I have then it’s impossible to get a decent amount of ‘alone time.’ I’ve dated before, but learnt soon that it wasn’t what I expected.”
“He used to live with his girlfriend, I think, but they had an argument and he’s back at home for a bit,” said Nick. “I dunno, really. I just like to think he missed Mum’s cooking.”
Harry rolled his eyes as he dragged Draco into the apothecary. He started to collect everything that he needed plus some extra, bartering with the shop attendant to get a better deal so he could get more. It didn’t take much to talk the woman into a bargain, as she was going to lose her job if she didn’t get more sales. Of course, he knew just how to talk her into better sales and bigger sales, securing her job for a little longer.
. It was a mouthful to pronounce and when he had asked Madam Pince for it, she blinked at him before asking him to repeat it.
“It was great, Harry enjoys his room, he was really impressed with the house, and he assumed it would be a dark and gloomy mess.” Narcissa frowned.
“Wow!” muttered the same girl. “So it was true? It really was opened?”
“He regularly talks to the Slytherins,” said Harry, shrugging. “He spoke to me the first day that I came here, welcoming me into Slytherin.”
Chapter revised:
“But we’re not bad people. We’re like our emblem, the snake: sleek, powerful, and frequently misunderstood. For instance, we Slytherins look after our own, which is more than you can say for Ravenclaw. Apart from being the biggest bunch of swots you ever met, Ravenclaws are famous for clambering over each other to get good marks, whereas we Slytherins are brothers and sisters. The corridors of Hogwarts can throw up surprises for the unwary, and you’ll be glad you’ve got the Serpents on your side as you move around the school. As far as we’re concerned, once you’ve become a snake, you’re one of ours… one of the elite. Because you know what Salazar Slytherin looked for in his chosen students? The seeds of greatness, you’ve been chosen by this house because you’ve got the potential to be great, in the true sense of the word. All right, you might see a couple of people hanging around the common room who you might not think are destined for anything special. Well, keep that to yourself. If the Sorting Hat put them in here, there’s something great about them, and don’t you forget it. And talking of people who aren’t destined for greatness, I haven’t mentioned the Gryffindors. Now, a lot of people say that Slytherins and Gryffindors represent two sides of the same coin. Personally, I think Gryffindors are nothing more than wannabe Slytherins. Mind you, some people say that Salazar Slytherin and Godric Gryffindor prized the same kinds of students, so perhaps we are more similar than we like to think. But that doesn’t mean that we cosy up with Gryffindors. They like beating us only slightly less than we like beating them.”
I have completed everything that's needed for vampires, goblins, orcs, dwarves, the four elven races, and a few more that I shall not address at this point.
“Excuse me, can you not harass students?” A Hufflepuff prefect frowned at Lucius and crossed his arms.
“If you’re ashamed or frightened to get changed as a group, you may get changed in the alcove to my right,” said Marcus starting at Malfoy. “Sooner or later you’ll have to get used to see everyone else naked.”
“I kept an eye on him, made sure he did not harm any other students,” said Albus. “He broke no rules, he was a model student, and he encouraged a lot of things. I had no real right to intervene. Likewise, he would have come to me if he truly needed my help. My door was – as it is now – always open.”
Harry listened as the boy explained his situation in a hesitant tone, leaving clear gaps in what he said. He knew that the boy would open up more and more over time, hence his desire to go for a long walk to an area where no one would be. It would take time and effort, both of which he had in abundance. At least, in his eyes.
“The moon?”
He slowly walked on the train, with his trunk being pulled behind him, he wanted to find an empty compartment, or maybe find where Draco was. He walked up and down the train twice and found nothing. He panicked and stepped into the first compartment he saw.
“How?” asked Ron, standing behind Neville, his face had gone a slight paler than usual. “You just… died?”
“Duelling,” said Draco, smiling. “I only needed one. Now, come
He really hoped not. He did not desire to be killed due to Draco.
,” hissed Harry, shaking his head as he followed the path and walked through the garden, making sure to not step on any gnomes. He listened for yelling, and heard none, so he was certain that he had either missed it or it had yet to start. “Ah – I hear something!”
