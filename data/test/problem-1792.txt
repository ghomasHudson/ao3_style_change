"But why didn't Petunia know? She was the oldest sister? And if Dumbledore knew then the so-called blood protection you've been receiving from staying with then is worthless", Remus furrowed his eyebrows.
Harry cleared his throat before stepping towards one of the goblins. "Hello, sir, I received a notice this morning that I was to attend a meeting with my account manager." Harry clearly stated.
"Uh, yes, thank you, sir," Harry replied nervously as the goblin lead him to a side corridor off of the main hall. Turning to the last door on the left side, the goblin stated, "This is where I leave you, Mr. Potter. Your account manager is within."
Harry was quite happy with how his hair turned out. The top was long enough to put in a bun while he played quidditch. Violet had made sure that he looked good, despite having to lengthen several strands. Harry also had finished clothes shopping, getting an arrangement of Green, purple, navy, black, and white dress shirts and casual wear. Harry thought he looked quite nice. He had decided to change into a pair of black slacks and a dark bottle green dress shirt with a small silver wristwatch and black dress shoes. It was nearing the middle of the afternoon. The hair cut alone had taken well over two hours, and clothes shopping had taken even longer. Harry discovered he like shopping for himself, while there was a twinge of guilt at the amount a galleons it cost, he loved picking out new sets of clothing and shoes.
It was becoming increasingly difficult for Harry to climb out of bed each morning. His feet seemed to drag, and he never could manage to stop his alarm clock before it rang. His summer holidays were the worst. But at least he wasn't under the stairs anymore. Although something about the cupboard was comforting, in the small space, he could always tell what was around him, even in the dark, there were no surprises. But Dudley's second bedroom had positives. The bed was softer, and the spiders were less prone to eat his eyes, as he feared when he was three. Harry was also quite a bit taller than when he last slept in the cupboard and didn't think he would be able to fit under the stairs anymore. While still abnormally small, Harry had grown to only slightly below the average height for a fourteen-year-old, never mind the fact he was turning sixteen in 2 hours. And even though during the summer he would regain his sickly, underweight stature, it was nothing a glamor and a year of Hogwarts food couldn't fix.
“Of course, many people think that wearing glasses makes them look smarter, but they don’t want to deal with putting them on each morning. Here I have the potion in the back room, I’ll take your glasses and change them out, it should only be a minute or so” The old man stumbled to the room directly behind the front desk.
"Yeah, don't worry, I got to choose my classes. That's actually why I was in the Alley for a couple of extra days. I had a medical disturbance during the History of Magic test and couldn't finish it. I then had to study and take the test to choose my classes. After that, I finished my school shopping." Remus looked somewhat appeased. "And uh, I may or may not have gotten a snake." Harry rushed.
Harry needed to find a concealing charm for the rings. He did not want Dumbledore to find out Harry had claimed his lordships, or how many there were. What Harry had found out yesterday was horrendous. The Headmaster had placed a block on his magic, his heritage, and then forced him into participating in horrible challenges. Harry thought it was to much of a coincidence that Hagrid had picked up the Flamel’s Stone, the day he picked up Harry. But why didn’t Dumbledore wanted the stone sooner, no he had to have it Harry’s first year to test the “boy who lived” or the restrictions on his magic.
Getting ready for his day was an interesting experience. While he usually rolled out of bed to change and put on a glamour. He now stood in front of the mirror, debating if the disguise was worth it. Harry wanted to learn how to take care of his hair and have it adequately cut, and his glamour hid the length, colour, and uneven snips. The magical inheritance changed the highlights of his hair to a blood-red, which melded perfectly with his jet-black mane. Still, aunt Petunia would always try and cut his hair. Most of the time, she got sick of going through it all the way, and only cut half of it. As a result, every strand on his head was a different length. Some pieces reached his waist while others barely grazed the tips of his ears. Without the glamour, his hair an utter mess. After he got it cut, it would be easier to hide the new colour because he wouldn't have to put as much magic in creating a uniform length.
Harry considered for a brief moment before stating, “I wish to continue this partnership if you are willing, however I would like to see your old contract to see any changes that should be made now that you are no longer the head account manager to just the potter vaults.
Pressing Malfoy to his chest, he ran, faster than he had ever run in his life, from the sixth floor to the first, ignoring the other students’ exclamations as he passed. No teachers came his way.
“The question is, why is he so worried about what I think?” Harry asked her. “It really seemed to bother him, Hermione!”
His trained eye couldn’t see any of the visual clues most poisons left on a patient’s body, and apparently Potter hadn’t been awake to say anything, so he was extremely curious about the answer.
“Right, okay.” Potter molds his expression into one of concentration. “But don’t we also want to figure out what their grand plan is?”
Bones’ lower lip quivered. “I don’t know who any of you are.” She sobbed, reached up and wiped her face with a tissue someone had apparently given her. “I don’t even know who
“I don’t know.” Admittedly, every time Potter looked at the houses around them, Draco couldn’t help but sneak glances at
The deadly quiet was almost unbearable. Parvati stared, wide-eyed and frozen in place, and then the fire turned green again and Harry appeared.
Potter looked up sharply right when something occurred to Draco as well. “Could this have something to do with the Time Room, ‘Mione? Is there a possibility…?”
Blaise shrugs. “Same reason. Hermione thought you’d balk, and Pansy was scared you’d try to nip the entire thing in the bud. I mean, you haven't exactly been the epitome of tolerance for Slytherins up until now.”
“Yeah.” Harry grimaced. “They’re a lot worse than they were when we broke in here, years ago, and frankly, I’d rather not have to deal with them.”
“I’ll get it,” Harry announced and jumped to his feet before reaching for one of the patches of Atmospheric Illusions on the sideboard. Weasley’s squeaky humming noise of warning came a bit too late. A moment later, they were all staring at the window that had appeared on the floor.
Harry stops, considers that flavor combination, and briefly wonders whether Goyle just decided to pack all his favorite flavors into his creation at once.
“Rowan berries.” She stretched out her hand and cupped the delicate cluster of red berries to show them.
“That, and interacting with them is an excruciatingly awkward experience for you these days, so you embraced that excuse like a good bottle of Chateauneuf-du-Pape.”
She came over and sat next to Harry so she could put her arm around him. Weasley stepped closer too and clapped his hand on Harry’s shoulder. Draco was glad they were there for him, but at the same time, he couldn’t help but wish he could go over to them as well without feeling like he was intruding.
“I wouldn’t say that, Harry. The alternative might just be being stuck in a time loop for all eternity. Since you wouldn’t know you’re in a time loop, you’d never do anything differently.” She shrugged at their looks of horror. “It’s just a theory.”
it is…well…let’s just say the older, more traditional healers at St Mungo’s foamed at the mouth when I returned to work after studying with the haematologist. Antidotes are traditionally something you drink, but that’s very limiting, in the end.”
Draco regarded him for a moment. He’d known Blaise since childhood, and nothing in his friend’s demeanour was ringing any alarm bells. No, Blaise was not the poisoner. Draco was absolutely certain.
Draco isn’t actually sure. He’s never heard of an insanity bug before, but it’s the only logical explanation.
“I told her that we had a very good reason we wouldn’t be able to tell her until a few days from now, but that it was a wonderful reason she would be tremendously happy about. It softened the blow sufficiently.” Hermione grimaced. “That isn’t to say she was happy about it, but I’m operating under the reasonable assumption that she’ll burst with joy once she realizes Harry is alive.”
Parkinson leans her head cheekily against Ron’s shoulder, which makes him startle and look alarmed. “The overall winner from this Charity Bake-Off event will receive a guest column in Witch Weekly, an interview on-air at the Wizarding Wireless Network’s Witching Hour, a profile in the Daily Prophet, and a place of honor at the ribbon cutting for the new Young Witches and Wizards Primary Education Center, which is slated to happen in August of this year. As you probably already know, all profits from this event will benefit the War Orphans Fund and the Ascendio Project.”
“Uh,” Potter says intelligently, and then, before Draco can think about what he’s doing, he is grabbing onto Potter’s arm in a panic and dragging him away in an attempt to save them both from the insanity bug.
“Notes about what?” Selwyn glared at them, but Draco, who had been glared at by people like Bellatrix and Fenrir Greyback on many occasions, remained unimpressed.
Harry flashed him a smile, which was problematic, because he was wearing his own face now and therefore bypassing Draco’s every defence. “So you
In between working with a very volatile partial antidote, cleaning up shards of exploded vials from the floor, and Draco enduring multiple barbed remarks and hateful looks from the parents of one of his patients, they had made progress with the magi-chemical indicator. However, it had raised as many questions as it had answered. They hadn’t managed to create anything that told them in how many ways the poison could potentially change, but they had found an indicator that revealed the poison had already changed its molecular structure – twice. One change, of course, was the one that allowed it to attack specific cells in the body, but Draco was at a loss for what the second change was. It worried him. The last thing he needed was Potter still being in danger because there was some other damage to his body that Draco hadn’t found out about.
It became a dance of agility and quickness, Potter apparently having the time of his life as he kept attempting to reach a post and Draco having visions of being forced to rescue Potter from potentially maiming himself. Potter kept laughing and sticking his tongue out as though he’d already reached the post, and Draco felt flushed and hot and tried to suppress the half-hysterical giggle that wanted to rise up in him.
“She would only exist in the moment,” Hermione said softly. “No future, no past, no familiar people, nothing she knows about herself no matter how many times she’s told.”
“Alright,” Hermione said eventually, produced a little Muggle notebook from her purse and tapped it thrice with her wand. "This will record for us - now talk me through what's in your head. I'm assuming it has something to do with the antidote?"
“Because… because…” Draco tried to wrestle the words in his head into some form that would make sense when he spoke them aloud. “Because you won’t always want me,” he said eventually. “And I can’t deal with that. I can’t.”
Draco was silent as she led him out his front door and down the street. His mind was racing. He kept wanting to explain, didn’t know how to start, ran through possibilities and ingredient combinations in his head.
“Right,” Draco says. When warm breath brushes his cheek, he realizes that Potter’s still gripping him by the shoulders and standing way too close. He considers asking to be released but feels strangely reluctant – probably because it’s not strategically smart to alienate the only other sane 8
“Please,” he groaned, and didn't know what he was asking for, only that the gut-wrenching need was killing him. “Please.”
It felt like giving back just the tiniest bit of what Harry was giving him. Draco watched with wide-open eyes, taking in everything he possibly could; Harry’s face, the flush of his skin, the noises he didn’t seem embarrassed to be making. He took all of it and treasured it, vowing to remember for the rest of his life how it felt to be like this, with the one who understood him better than anyone else. He bent down and used his tongue to make it all even better, swirling in circles and spirals and tracing joyful shapes on spicy-tasting skin, and it was all just so fucking perfect he wanted to cry.
, exactly, but I think that getting away from my flat will help, and, er, well, I.” He faltered, because the girl flicked her head up to the sky and Harry realized he was standing there like a bloody idiot, getting rained on. “I’ll…I’ll just get on, shall I?”
She nodded, as though that had confirmed something, raised her wand once more and cast a spell Draco recognized after a moment as a hearing aid.
“That’s a very good point,” he said to Sky. “And a good attitude. We do need to stop treating Squibs as though they’re a dirty secret, as a society.”
keep telling yourself that, it’s driving me bonkers.” Pansy reached for a dahlia and plucked it out of its arrangement. “I’m taking this as compensation.”
Weasley came back from the kitchen with the entire bottle of Firewhisky and a card. “So,” he said, “I couldn’t help but go through your mail…er, I mean, I knocked the stack over, I wasn’t actually looking as such…anyway…”
He allowed his mind to wander back to all that had happened throughout the past week as he began the familiar task of casting sweeping, scrubbing and disinfection spells. Interestingly, no matter how hard he tried to shove it away, one detail kept insisting on nagging at him.
“I would have brought it up by now it that was the case. But I will be going through inventory lists to make sure no item from the room was unaccounted for before they were all destroyed. The possibility is minute, but…” She shrugged. “I have no other ideas.”
Severus nodded grimly and, after sparing a single glance for Harry, who was still huddled on the floor, stepped up to the patient. Wordlessly, he pushed Madam Pomfrey’s hands aside and removed the cloths, drew his wand in one fluid movement and traced the cut across Draco’s torso. His murmuring, which sounded much like a chant, was echoed by the walls of the hospital wing. Madam Pomfrey watched anxiously and sighed with profound relief when the wound actually began to close.
Harry exclaimed abruptly, “Egbert, really!” and Draco was stuck with a needle for the third time in less than two minutes as Babs whirled around.
“Hermione could probably tell stories for hours about how oblivious and inconsiderate and thoughtless I can be. I…Malfoy?”
Draco took two steps into the room and touched one of the flowers, a calla lily surrounded by snapdragons. Whoever had done this had picked an excellent florist. The composition, the colors…it was all stunning. It was also heart-stoppingly expensive, Draco could tell that much, and Potter didn’t have that sort of money. Did he?
“I don’t want this,” he repeated yet again, talking into the crook of Draco’s neck, and for some reason, Draco didn’t mind it one bit, which, oddly enough, intrigued him almost as much as the apparent time loop.
“Clearly. I haven’t got the time for a chat anyway, I’m due at Robards’ office – probably to get shouted at for not having invented a mind-reading device that the aurors can use, or whatever. In case you’re gone by the time I get back…” He shrugged, and the corner of his mouth quirked up. “Still on for pub night day after tomorrow?”
Together, they shrunk and packed up all of the lab equipment he would need, except for the few things that didn’t react well being shrunk, which they arranged to have delivered. Draco had, halfway through, started mentally cataloguing what he would need to do and in which order, but his mind kept getting stuck on
Potter traced a circle around the writing he’d been indicating. As he laid the wand aside with a clatter, the blur that had been there resolved itself into a cluster of numbers, and above it the words
is that sometimes, you accidentally end up creating something worse because the magical component gives the substance a kind of flexibility that it doesn’t have in the chemical sense. Essentially…” Draco sighed and tried to find words that would be clear enough so even Smith couldn’t misconstrue them. “Ordinarily, you’ve got your poison, you’ve got your antidote, they bind together and create something harmless that the body can simply metabolize.
“Say you’re mine,” Harry whispered, and Draco, finally, let go of the darkness his mind had been clinging to so desperately.
He went slack in Potter's grip. There was a wall, and he was leaning against it, he realized slowly, as he came back to himself. The hand in his hair was no longer pulling, but instead Potter's fingers were rubbing soothing circles on his scalp.
“That’s why they were so eager to recommend you.” Parvati blew out a dismissive breath. “I should have known.”
His nails dug deep enough to draw blood. A pearl of it welled up, dark against his pale skin. Draco focused on it and tried to blend out his surroundings.
“What? No, you muppet, of course not,” Draco scoffs, and Potter looks utterly relieved. Tension seems to leave him in spades.
“Yes. They decided to just leave that alone after the bell jar incident. It was there until after I started working here.”
“Don’t be ridiculous, I wouldn’t make it out of the room alive if I had,” Pansy scoffs. That doesn’t seem to reassure Granger one bit. Draco doesn’t blame her. Pansy Parkinson with a polite smile on her face and a tray of baked goods in her hands is a sight that would set off anyone’s alarm bells.
“Dear Merlin, I’m in love with the world’s biggest idiot,” Draco said, and knelt down, smiling, to kiss Harry in front of everyone.
Granger hesitated, but then reached for her wand and pushed up Harry’s sleeve. She circled a cluster of medium-sized letters with the tip of it, and they unscrambled.
Draco tried to recall what else Granger had said about writing new messages. “Remember that we also can’t risk changing the timeline more than a slight bit.”
“But that’s why I’m asking!” she cried out, jumping up and wringing her hands. “Tell me how to fix this!”
Warm fingers brushed his own. Surprised, he looked over at Harry – or rather, at the annoying glamour Harry was wearing once again. “What?”
Harry leapt off the bus, reached his front door in three steps and burst through it with more force than he’d planned. It crashed against the wall and rebounded, hitting Harry in the shoulder.
“Excuse me!” Harry called out. She jumped and spun around, surprisingly nimble for someone who was – by Draco’s estimate – at least seventy.
Harry swallowed hard. He knew that the head of Slytherin house was not to be taken lightly. When he heard a sharp “Get going!”, he jumped up and went.
“I may actually murder you,” Blaise announced as he stepped out of the floo. “No sane person would blame me. No court would convict me. You
And he buried his fingers in Draco’s silky hair and squeezed his eyes shut, and just before pleasure overtook him, he was flooded with thankfulness that the weather had been shit this night.
But he still couldn’t stop himself from carrying the necklace in his pocket for most of the day, and stow it securely in his nightstand after that. That night, before going to sleep, he couldn’t keep himself from brushing a finger across the surface of the crystal disc, closing his eyes on a heavy, painful sigh. He very carefully didn’t think about what that might mean for him.
They say a polite thank you and have a seat, and Draco is struck by how content Potter looks, sitting there opposite him, mouth so full he looks like an obese Puffskein and yet still able to give Draco a smile. It feels…nice, sitting here together, and Draco wishes they could do it more often.
"How strange," Hermione muttered, sounding half-preoccupied with the tangled string of lights in her hands.
“It’s temporary. He’ll find his own place soon, but for now he’s in my guest room. And I don’t mind, really I don’t, but things are complicated between us, and it’s only getting worse.” He grimaced. “Yesterday…was interesting. I felt things I wasn’t expecting.”
Harry noticed his new mood eventually. He wasn’t the most observant person, never had been, but Draco had nothing to hide behind when it was just the two of them. Every slight hesitation on his part became suddenly glaring, and before long, Harry was holding Draco’s head in his hands, stroking his temples and asking, “What’s wrong? You’re… not yourself.”
She frowned and her shoulders slumped. “I’m sorry, Harry. I’ve tried to make it as nice as possible –”
“Malfoy, your painting,” Potter started, with a very strange look on his face, and it was fine, completely fine, Draco had, after all, anticipated sort of situation.
A month ago, however, some complete fuckwit in administration had decided to change the display, and now the glass case held a much more depressing memento – a single wand on a cushion of gold-trimmed red velvet.
“The small bit of good news is that the poison doesn’t seem to start affecting the memory immediately,” Draco pointed out. “Longbottom said she was fine until she lost consciousness – scared, obviously, but there were no noticeable cognitive issues at all. And it’s only retrograde amnesia.”
The rage in the woman’s eyes was reaching proportions that reminded Draco uncomfortable of Bellatrix. When he heard the incantation he’d been dreading but knew was coming, he took a deep breath and reminded himself forcefully that nothing in this memory could actually hurt him. That included the Fiendfyre.
“I know.” Potter's voice wasn't entirely steady. “I know. It spooked me too. Everyone's pretty shaken up, I think.”
“Lovely,” said Babs, “so if you would please step onto the stool over here, Mr Malfoy, we’ll get your cloak all taken care before you can so much as say ‘Hippogriff’.”
should make him laugh. Have you given him backrubs, picked up the slack instead of this Leroy? Maybe made breakfast?”
Draco regretted the words as soon as they had left his mouth, but Potter surprised him by laughing like he found it genuinely funny.
That only seemed to upset her more. She stood abruptly, crossed her arms and looked at them all in turn. “I
“You most certainly did. I’d ask why you didn’t visit your parents the last couple of weeks like you usually do, but I strongly suspect I already know the answer.”
“Wouldn’t put it past her. Dumbledore had an odd sense of humor, but maybe she inherited it along with the post.”
“Really I’m the one who should feel guilty,” said Potter, and he looked and sounded sad now, which made something in Draco’s chest pull uncomfortably, and Merlin
“Because if it’s that simple, why do you still have all of the memories before the loop starts?” Draco answered in her stead. “It should all be gone, or at least it shouldn’t be so…”
He was well aware that Draco generally hired someone to do the job for him, but with the terrible infestations that had been spreading all throughout Britain faster than a wildfire, professional de-gnomers were impossible to come by unless one agree to be the seven hundred and twentieth name on the waiting list.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “Thanks.” He looked down at the calculations he’d just done, and frowned. “I just don’t know if…” He trailed off.
it was different. He pulled his lip between his teeth, and Draco decided to take it all back because thank Merlin for glamours – his breath was already stuttering, but if he’d seen that while Potter wore his own face, he might have stopped breathing entirely from the sheer want coursing through him.
A very long silence spread through the room. Even the tree in the corner seemed suddenly careful not to rustle its needles. Draco looked down, then back up, and realized he was finished with all the essential parts of Potter’s health check. He cleared his throat.
“Right, so, what’s the message?” Harry dug in his pocket and produced a marker. At Draco’s look of confusion, he admitted, “Been carrying it around, just in case. Should we start with the mint and the…whatever cherry it was?”
Out of words, Draco drank heavily. Warm fingers pried the goblet from his hands, and the protest died on his lips when he finally looked up and into Harry’s eyes.
“I don’t believe so,” said Draco. “Even if they had, it’s unlikely they would have known what to look for. I’ll ask Parvati if there is a way for me to have a look.” He made a face. Autopsies were not something he was used to doing, and he found even the thought disturbing. But he was a professional, and so he would act like a professional, even if a small part of him wanted to run screaming like he was ten.
Draco held his breath, and for a moment, he thought he might have been wrong about the encryption method, but then the inked numbers slowly began to transform.
“No, no,” Draco assured her. “So you fitted the fuchsia robes, yes? Did you have a nice chat with her while that went on?”
“Perfect,” she said once it was done and the string of lights took up the entire length of the sofa. With a flick of her wand, she plugged them back in and then used a sticking charm to affix them to the ceiling. Dimming the other light sources in the room brought about a peaceful, cosy atmosphere that Draco welcomed with open arms. He sat with a sigh that was a whole lot deeper than he had planned.
By unspoken agreement, they made their way up to the staff portion of the roof garden. It was a relief to finally rip his breathing mask off and suck in fresh, cold air. Draco leaned against a wall as he did so, trying to focus on each inhale and exhale, to quiet the anxiety that had been his companion all day and to relax the muscles that had been tense for hours.
“Sure. I’d just like to get the blood first though.” He dug in his pocket for the muggle hypodermic needle and syringe he needed. When he held it up, Granger’s eyes narrowed.
“I'll do whatever I like,” Draco said slowly, savoring the words. His temple throbbed. He was still shaking.
ed out of existence at that moment. Everyone looked to Weasley, whose cheeks were bulging like a chipmunks. Miraculously, he managed to squeeze out “Hold on,” through a mouthful of food.
Draco is about to start listing them, but then Potter displays some fiendishly clever distraction skills when he slips one warm hand beneath Draco’s sweater and lays it on Draco’s lower back. Draco shudders involuntarily.
Draco dropped the painting and launched himself at Potter, pressing their lips together. Potter staggered but kept his balance, which was a good thing because Draco was clinging so tightly to him that they would have gone down together. He kissed Potter until he was too oxygen-starved to continue and had to pull away.
Draco is returning a book to its rightful spot in the library when he comes across Potter. The Saviour is looking from a piece of parchment in his hands to the bookshelf and back, apparently searching for something. When he notices Draco, he looks at him with an alarmed expression.
“Stop thinking about thinking and tell me where we went wrong. What can we do not to get poisoned next time?”
, I thought I was just being protective, but I’m jealous and I don’t want you going out with Leroy because
She had a hint of an accent, French, Draco was almost certain. Her voice was melodious and pleasant.
“No,” Draco said immediately, then felt his face go even warmer. “I mean…you don’t…you don’t need to make it a priority, is what I mean.”
“She didn’t really make any mistakes in the first place,” Draco pointed out. “I can’t fault her for anything I saw in that memory.”
“Yes. Three people. I was able to cure it in one, and that was a pain in the arse I was only able to pull off because there was a True Stasis spell involved.”
The healer collected the used cloths, Draco’s shirt, and the cloak, and ducked into an adjacent room, returning with another phial of blood type 1 4 blood replenisher. Severus had covered the patient up in the meantime. After Madam Pomfrey had given him the potion, the color slowly started to return to Draco’s skin – of course he was quite pale by nature, but she had never seen him anywhere near as white as he’d been when Harry had brought him in.
“Sod off then,” Harry snapped. He was furious at himself, his heart was breaking, he wanted to hide under his desk as to never have to face Malfoy again, and now Ron was failing in his best-friend-support duties, because he was supposed to
“Yes,” Sky confirmed. “Very romantic shackles though. Good luck, Harry! Er, Henry! Come back soon and bring Draco along, will you?”
“Groundhog Day. But I don’t think this is the same sort of situation. If any injuries were undone once you start the loop over, logic dictates that it happens to every other sort of change you made to your body, meaning that the writing on your arm would be erased as well.”
He could feel Potter coming to a stop next to him. For a long moment, they were both silent. A car horn honked somewhere below.
“In other news,” Granger said with false cheer, “did you hear we’ll have a storm tomorrow? The Floo network might be down for a while if it gets as bad as they’re fearing.”
Potter shook his head. “No, she hasn’t had any luck. Do you think it’s the same sort of encryption that yours had?”
Molly says it’s the best vanilla cake she’s ever eaten. It’s creative and neat and perfectly executed, and if Harry had to guess, he’d say Padma made the cake – or Luna, possibly – but he isn’t sure.
There was a hissing sound. Harry jumped a bit when he saw a grumpy-looking Kneazle suddenly sitting on the armrest of his chair.
It was the most upset Draco had seen him since he had woken up after the detox. Before he could stop himself, he sat closer to Potter and laid a hand on his back.
“Hank Partridge,” Potter said. “I’m actually related to Rita, she’s my second cousin. And let me tell you, she has only gotten more vicious with age. You wouldn't
“Secret admirer,” he lied, standing up and dropping the necklace in the pocket of his robes before making his way to the doors. On the way, he took care to avoid Finnigan, who was scowling at the mass of storm clouds over his head and waved his wand, presumable trying to make them vanish, or at least stop raining on him. Draco only barely managed to suppress a smirk, and the fact of it made him frown. He wasn’t supposed to be going around smirking. Harry’s damn present wasn’t supposed to be lifting his mood. It was all wrong.
“Prove it,” Draco said with a very small smile, and Harry shot forward and kissed him breathless. They moved together, although Harry couldn’t figure out how and where, but eventually, his back hit the wall. Draco was plastered against him in the same moment, making a lovely little sighing noise.
“I want you to take proper care of yourself. I can't hurt you if you're already hurting yourself, if you're not strong enough.”
“Right,” says Ron. “As you can see, Draco Malfoy, who may not be a war criminal but has certainly been a bloody great git since I’ve known him, is getting started on his caramel yet again, his sixth attempt. I can’t help but feel he deserves it.”
Someone touched the back of Harry’s head. He looked up pathetically, right into Hermione’s kind eyes. “Don’t worry, Harry, we’ll get you sorted out.” Her tone was so reassuring that Harry felt a tiny bit better.
“Draco asked me to reorganize all the books in his library while he’s gone,” she explained. “Oh! Speaking of books, do you think there’s one with a spell for this sort of situation? I mean, Harry can’t be the first one this has ever happened to.”
“Good,” Parvati said and looked up at him. “Lyman Selwyn sent in a complaint along with the list you asked him to write, by the way.”
Draco stared into the tarnished mirror, his reflection swimming before his eyes, as Harry used his fingers and tongue and a little bit of conjured slickness to loosen and prepare him, and Draco’s own moans rang in his ears. It felt so good, so right that this should happen here and now and with this particular person. Eventually, he couldn’t keep his eyes open at all as Harry found all the spots where he was sensitive, all those nerve endings begging to be stimulated.
He allowed himself to remember things that felt far away, untainted by the war that had followed. There were the excessive shopping sprees he’d gone on with Pansy, and there was his pretending to check out girls along with Blaise, and that time Vince had pitched himself headfirst into a snowdrift on a dare.
It was quiet for a while as they ate the trifle – which was utterly delicious, Draco had to admit, the mixed berries, sponge fingers soaked in berry compote and silky custard. He took his time, both to savour every bite and give his digestion a chance to make a bit more room so he could finish.
Draco finally lifted his gaze, staring. Harry was pacing. His face was dark, his feet kicking the uneven stones of the floor as he stomped around.
“Help me figure out what to put on my blasted arm, Draco, and if we’ve got more time after that, we can speculate if you insist.”
Draco obeyed. Harry’s hands pushed down on his shoulders just hard enough to get them to relax bit by bit. He kept dictating ‘in, out,” and after several minutes of that, Draco felt the tension beginning to trickle out of him.
“No, it can’t,” Potter said, burying his head in his hands. “You know what makes sense about this? Absolutely fuck all.”
They were quietly and lovingly bickering with each other, and it seemed an appropriate time for Draco to leave. He withdrew from the room without another word and returned to his temporary quarters to rest. He would have tried to actually sleep, but he was certain that racing thoughts of cairns and Voldemort and Harry dying would prevent him from it for hours to come.
“I’m leaving,” Selwyn hissed and turned away from them. Draco opened his mouth to call him back, but he was beaten to it.
thing has proven that it can change. The magic is what’s telling it ‘hey, once you find a certain type of cell to cling to, change your molecular structure so you can do something you couldn’t do before’ – presumably something that damages the cell in some way. There is no reason those who created it couldn’t have put a second bit of magic on it saying ‘hey, if you encounter any substance that starts to bind with you, rip it apart and use the pieces to change your molecular structure in a different way’.”
There was a very good reason Draco hadn’t been sorted Gryffindor, but maybe, just this once, he could act like one.
With a small grimace, Draco did. A moment later, he was staring down at a red and white ‘E’ in despair.
I plan to stop at kissing, you’re in for a very big surprise.” With that, he forced Harry’s shirt over his head and tossed it away along with the towel that Harry had forgotten he had slung across his shoulders. He felt Draco’s fingers sinking into his hair, and they kissed and kissed until Harry thought his lips might go numb.
But he had to admit that the savior looked good, glitter and all. The rebuilding of Hogwarts and five months of school had done Harry favors. He filled out and he carried himself well, which was, to be precise, the exact opposite of Draco.
Draco opened his mouth to ask who in Merlin’s name that was and then realized he already knew. “Blaise, you utter twit, you named your peppermint plant
Nothing happens. Conversation picks back up, people recommence their hurried walks to classes, and Draco stands there with his mouth open, wondering if the insanity is going to catch him next.
“Merlin fuck,” said Draco, because it seemed appropriate, and because he hadn’t contributed much of anything lately. “You get poisoned at the end of each loop, right? Just before you go back.”
Pouring wine seemed like the best course of action, so that was what Draco did. “When was the last time you checked to make sure they were all accounted for?”
The last thing he expected was Harry making his way past the heavy door, pushing it shut before turning his attention to Draco.
Harry used the opportunity to steal some kisses and then touched their foreheads together in a way that quickened Draco’s pulse and said, “We need a tree still.”
“I haven’t had any for ages, that’s what. Potter isn’t exactly a connoisseur, and I’m not going to share my favourite wine with someone who doesn’t know to appreciate it.”
Draco sighed deeply and put down Victoria’s notes. There was no point, he couldn’t concentrate on them. It really would have been nice to know if there was the tiniest chance Potter might…not be entirely averse to the idea of getting a tad closer to Draco than strictly necessary. Draco cursed his previous iterations for not convincing Potter to put the tiniest hint about it on his arm. It would have made things so much easier. Then again, his previous iterations had probably all been just as terrified to try it as Draco was now, and if they hadn’t kissed Potter, they could hardly have left hints about it.
“I’ve found it works better for me than using my wand. If I draw the blood out and into a vial with magic, it passes through the air, which can include contaminants. On top of that, I don’t know enough about the poison to be sure my magic won’t affect it in some way. It’s better to be safe than sorry.”
Draco opened his mouth to keep arguing but then closed it again. He had no desire to start an argument over the matter, and Harry was probably right – the chances of anyone spying on them here were enormously low. Besides, there was the fact that looking at glamour-less Harry was infinitely more pleasing than the alternative.
“No!” Harry yelped, because destroying Draco’s garden was decidedly not the sort of non-romantic gesture he’d been trying for. “Don’t you dare! Nothing can be damaged, there has to be another way!”
There was a deep sigh from Blaise. “You’ll get frown-lines one of these days, my friend. Come on through to the kitchen, I’ll explain. Bring Bartholomew.”
Harry pointed at a stack of books on the desk that hadn’t been there the day before. “She’s literally searched every available book on arithmancy and magical secret messages. She’s ready to tear her hair out.”
“This cake,” Kingsley says, then interrupts himself to eat another large forkful. “This cake tastes like every beautiful winter memory I’ve ever had.”
“A summer cake, how lovely,” says Molly, immediately after Parkinson rattles off a detailed description for the listeners on the wireless.
“Of the clues.” He pointed at his arm. “Or rather, we’ve been trying to guess which one was the first one I wrote. Want a go?”
“No, I mean yes, this was when, I’m just, um, running a little behind, you know how these things go…” Too late, he realised he’d grabbed two handfuls of his previously wrinkle-free robes and was clutching them in his desperation.
As soon as he could, he got to his feet and stumbled out of the room and past Clearwater, who called his name, sounding puzzled. Left, left again, then on his right the door to Granger’s office. He burst through the door without knocking and stared at a surprised Potter, who’d frozen right in the middle of airing out his bedding.
Draco winced, but Potter only leaned over to be able to grin at her past Draco’s head. “Relax, ‘Mione, I told him about the thing with Voldemort, that’s all.”
“Oh dear,” she sighed. “Here’s a plan. We hurry up and get you healed, and then you can rest for a bit. Stay the night, if you like. Is that acceptable?”
With his apple cake in the oven, Harry gets started on his gingerbread dough. It’s tricky business, and he had been reluctant to even use it, but Draco had needled him until he’d agreed to take the risk. He hopes it won’t blow up in his face.
“Her memory is just…obliterated,” Hermione told them as they made their way through the park together, snow crunching beneath their boots. “Gone completely.”
“Might depend on how you market them,” Draco pointed out. “Could be some sort of game – everyone takes one, and then you have to…I don’t know, try to form a word out of them all. You’ll just have to package them properly so you have the right letters to form something like…” He frowned and tried to think of a single, festive word, once again staring at the glass bowl. “Humbug.”
“It’s fine,” Draco assured her. “It’s the poison. He’s starting to sweat it out faster than I thought.”
“What you’ll be making today,” Ron says, and it seems like everyone is holding their breath, “is a caramel chocolate ombre cake.”
A basic diagnostic spell was first to monitor both heart rate and breathing rate. Another more advanced one allowed the larger veins and arteries to shine through Potter’s skin. As Draco watched carefully for any irregularities, Potter watched
Draco had never felt such peace. He couldn't bring himself to move, to fear, to be embarrassed. The fingers running through his hair were perfection, the chest he was pressed against rose and sunk in a hypnotic rhythm that kept him calm. Not even when Harry spoke was that peace disrupted.
Of course, once he was a bit older, he probably should have been able to tell that there was a reason he was so very hyperaware of Potter’s every breath on the rare occasions they crossed paths, but really, he’d had other problems.
“We’ll have to have her arrested by someone that’s not me, you, or anyone in the Department of Mysteries, then.”
He know his cloak wouldn’t make it through this ordeal as soon as Babs tutted and tugged on his hood so hard she nearly choked him. “So much extra fabric,” she said.
Potter nodded and was silent, looking thoughtful. Draco waited, but he didn’t seem to be ready to share. Instead, he tilted his head back again and stuck his tongue out.
The little goblin, Bug, nodded in very serious fashion and then whispered loudly, “Is my name horrible, mama?”
“Anyway, no, it’s not the jewelry or the ore or anything. Draco just needs someone devoted, you know. Someone who adores him, who loves flying as much as he does, who will make him breakfast in the mornings and give him backrubs when he’s had a long day. Someone who can make him laugh, you know? That’s important.”
Draco swallowed hard. This wasn’t the impossible task it had been before, when he’d held everything back and within himself like a deadly secret, but that didn’t mean it was easy.
She rolled her eyes. “It’s a half-cooked theory at best, but I can’t seem to come up with another one, given what we know. Death isn’t…I mean, I can’t really get around anthropomorphising Death to explain this – it might be the only way that any of us can even begin to understand –”
“So, show me what you’re working on and let me help, you fopdoodle,” she said. “It’s your fault that I’m here, therefore it’s your fault that I’m sitting around being bored. I know whatever you’re doing is important and at least a little bit time-sensitive, and two heads are better than one.”
Those reasons were one, he needed a moment to get it together and stop feeling like he might cry, and two, he still needed a gift for Harry.
“Right, cast the encoding spell and tell me the numbers,” Harry instructed as he handed over the note.
“Mate, we’re all in the same boat there,” Weasley pointed out, then glanced at his wife. “What was it?”
Draco did not answer until the last bead of Coradine Silver was properly cushioned and inside the warded case. He closed it with a flick of his wand and turned around.
“What if…what if we let everything play out as it did this time except make sure we have an antidote available?”
clues, and I’m not going to hide in someone’s bedroom the entire time you and Ron and Hermione run around trying to figure it out. I’ll wear a glamour, obviously. But I’m going.”
She opened the door wide and beckoned them in. They stepped into a living room that was chaos incarnate, with half-empty or tipped over drink glasses everywhere, decorations that had been mostly torn down, stains and broken glass on the carpet, and so many more things that Draco could barely process it all. He assumed quite a few of them were muggle, as he had never seen them before. The room reeked of sweat and alcohol.
"I am," Weasley assured her and immediately reached into one of the crates. A moment later, he held one end of a string of fairly lights which flickered in red and gold. "Doorframe, d'you reckon?"
“I…I’m not sure. June would know better, she’s the one who checked on her, who cast some healing spells.”
Harry opens his mouth to reply, but it’s then that the judges enter the tent. He is excited to discover that the first one of them is Molly Weasley. Now that he thinks about it, it makes sense – she certainly knows her baking. The second one, shocking him, is Kingsley Shacklebolt. Harry wonders just how the new Minister for Magic got himself roped into this, and who managed to do the roping. It was probably Hermione, or maybe McGonagall. Possibly both.
“Hm?” she asked and stopped staring into space. “Oh, sorry, I’m still thinking about how the time travel might have been possible. It’s just…
“Well, yes, but we’ll need it if it keeps happening. I also need to try and understand this stuff better, because it’s so different from other poisons that figuring out the mechanism may point us to its creator.”
Babs tutted as Draco hopped down from the stool. “The youth of today. So fragile. Egbert! You should be ashamed of yourself!”
Something happened – something moved, some kind of tight, sharp knot in his chest he’d not been fully aware of until now. The words played through his mind, over and over.
Potter nodded. “The first time must have been right after the cairn, and then, for some reason neither of us can even guess at, I went back in time to that exact point. Why then, we don’t know. We don’t know anything.”
Weasley’s expression was unreadable as he stared at ‘The Pregnant Witch Is Always Right - A Guide to Communicating With Your Partner As You Prepare for Childbirth’. He opened his mouth, closed it again, looked at Draco, then away, then cleared his throat and put the book on the coffee table.
Selwyn,” he said peevishly. “But I’m not surprised you forgot, it has been a while since the Malfoy family had this sort of standing, after all. And you’ll never inherit your title, will you? What a shame.”
“They tightened the after-hours security for that ward because there was a slew of complaints about valuables being stolen from helpless or unconscious patients – jewellery, mostly. Kenneth Spindlewheel had his late father’s wristwatch in his possession when he was brought in, which had great sentimental value to him in addition to the galleons it was worth – I don’t blame him for threatening to sue the hospital. The thefts stopped after the warding spells were changed to allow only healers working in the ward access to it.”
Draco wished he could challenge that statement by recommending she have a talk with Potter. But Potter was of course still a secret kept by a select few, and he was currently hidden in Weasley and Granger’s bedroom, probably unable to sit still as he waited for Parvati to leave.
Draco rubbed his eyes. “I stashed it in a closet,” he said. He didn’t even try to hide his distress, slumped as he was on his chair, robes wrinkled.
Harry grins a bit, thinking back to Draco’s disproportionate outrage and dramatic huffing, which was almost sort of…endearing? He shakes his head, because that can’t possibly be right. Nothing about Draco is
“It's okay,” Harry kept murmuring, and “Trust me, Draco,” and “You're safe, I'm here,” and he seemed to know at the same time everything and nothing about what he was doing to Draco, deep down inside. Draco couldn't control his shaking, and Merlin, he needed, he
That made no sense at all, but before Draco could point that out, he found himself being pulled out the front door and onto the strange and exotic streets of nighttime Muggle London.
Potter looked at him and grinned, the corners of his eyes crinkling, and then Draco was grinning too, and that made Potter start chuckling. Draco wasn’t far behind. The snowfall was heavy around them as they stood in the middle of Diagon Alley, laughing together, the people around them giving them strange looks as they hurried past.
idea,” Harry said with emphasis, and next thing Draco knew, he’d been dragged out of the room by his overenthusiastic lunatic of a boyfriend.
“Fine. What did Weasley have to say, then? And should I get the winter apple ones or the mulled wine flavour?”
Potter ignores him. “This is just the precursor to something worse, then,” he says, biting his lip. “They’re trying to lull us in, and when we’ve let our guard down…”
Draco slammed the front door shut, stalked into the living room where Harry was busy writing something in a little muggle notebook, dropped into his armchair like a drunk house elf and said, “Murder me. Make it quick, if you will.”
“Right as rain, Potter,” he said coolly, and decided there and then that he'd had enough of the party. Screw Pansy and Blaise and inter-house unity and all of that. He was going back to the dorm, where he would fight and probably lose to the temptation of slipping beneath his blankets and pretending the world outside his bed no longer existed.
Draco let his present for Harry float over while Hermione did the same with a slender package. “Mine first,” he said. “Mostly because it’s as silly as the one you gave me, and not the thing to end this gift exchange on.”
“It’s to do with the time travel. Or, well, with time in general. There is next to no chance this could actually be what continues the loop.”
“Draco asked me to have a look at his wards while he’s gone,” Kingsley said. “I wasn’t expecting anyone else to be here.”
“They looked at both the ruins and the floorplans. It was an enclosed space, no windows, no secret tunnels.”
“Why don’t you have this stirring rod already?” Blaise asked. “You’ve got the most potions equipment of anyone I’ve ever seen.”
hasn’t revealed himself yet,” Draco sniffed, then paused for a second. “Or herself. But hopefully not that. Women mystify me.”
Once Potter had left the room, Draco ignored the temptation to bang his head against the wall and instead reached for the Floo powder.
“After the Fiendfyre, you mean.” Draco was proud that after all this time, he could actually talk about the incident without shivering or staring into space as he remembered Crabbe. That didn’t mean he
“This looks lovely,” Molly says fondly of the first roll. “A bit clumsy, maybe, but certainly made with love.”
She smiled. “I’ve whipped him into shape quite nicely, don’t worry,” she assured him. “And speaking of partners, does Susan know?”
The way Hermione perked up told Draco she had expected the question – probably much sooner than it had been asked, actually.
“Yes,” she agreed, and stood as well, brushing snow off her shoulders. “The ministry is nearby, actually. If you like, we can walk from here.”
Atop his simple icing that doubles as a blanket of fresh snow, a gingerbread fawn and several bunnies frolic playfully while more snow, made from coconut flakes, dances in the gentle wind. Harry is very proud of it. Even before he hears the comments from the judges, he knows this round went better for him than he could have hoped for. His aim was to recreate the look of a snow globe, and in his opinion, he succeeded.
“Well, it definitely makes things harder. But I’ll keep trying every new name and word I come across, hopefully I’ll get it at some point. Every time I’m remotely bored, I try new words, anything I can think of.”
Draco frowned. “Why did she think she might be getting the flu? Were there any symptoms? Did she mention how she was feeling?”
“Nothing,” Draco complained. He knew he looked petulant, sitting there with his feet on his desk and his arms crossed, but he couldn’t bring himself to care. “Nothing since the flowers. Who does that? Who sends flowers and then
Granger was there, making notes on something she was holding, surrounded by a veritable sea of clocks – all different types and different sizes, but all of them creating an extremely annoying chorus of ticking noises. She whirled around as she heard the door opening. When she spotted Draco, she lifted her wand and muffled the ticking noises, which he was grateful for.
Someone taps Harry’s shoulder, jerking his attention away. “Can I borrow your wand?” Luna asks, serene smile on her face.
“Yeah, true, but all three of them have someone they’re looking forward to spending time with. Hermione said she was certain – she’ll double check though, just to make absolutely sure.” He nodded toward the booth. “It’s our turn.”
Draco lunged for Potter's wrist. His arms were shaking madly as he tried to get his former adversary to tighten his grip.
“Oh?” asked Graglor. “Is he planning to take advantage of this Draco? Steal his most precious jewelry? Collapse the ceiling of his ore mine, possibly?”
“Indeed I did. Although now that I think about it, his name may have been Alfred – I can’t quite remember.”
Draco searched his face and tried to make sure he wasn’t being messed with. “Harry,” he said slowly, “we can’t just waltz in there and say ‘Pardon us, terribly sorry, just going to stick our noses into everything for a moment here’.”
“I shouldn’t have refused to touch you. I’m sorry about that,” he said amidst the steady rhythm. “I just really wanted to make sure you were okay. I was afraid I might go too far otherwise, do something neither of us would be comfortable with. You’re… far more important to me than the feeling I get when I hurt you, I hope you know that.”
“Yes, well.” Harry tries to say something, possibly funny or clever, maybe insightful, he’s not picky. But nothing will come out, and so he ends up looking like an idiot with his mouth open and Draco’s hand clutched in both of his own for no good reason.
Draco held up the photograph, then thrust it forward when it occurred to him that Harry probably couldn’t see that much detail in the low light.
Granger smiled at him and went to fluff his pillows. “He’s turned into a really decent person,” she said to him, just barely loud enough for Draco to hear. “Give him a chance, will you?”
Draco tried not to be offended, because he had a fairly good idea of the place her worries were coming from. “I wouldn’t be proposing this if I wasn’t sure it’ll work,” he said.
“I think I can handle it. Hermione’s already gotten some of it out of me, too. You need to know, though, that there are apparently a few gaps in my memory, so I might not be able to answer.”
McGonagall had always been able to make Draco feel like she saw right through him, and that hadn’t changed at all. She was kind and welcoming, choosing words that seemed superficially polite but conveyed a very clear ‘You’re forgiven, Mr Malfoy, but if you squander that forgiveness I shall be very cross indeed.’ Even more disconcerting was the sort of all-knowing gaze she seemed to have learned from Dumbledore. When she rested that gaze on Harry’s glamoured form, Draco was certain she suspected
“Yes,” Potter confirmed. “We won’t take up much of her time, but we do need to speak with her quite urgently.”
“Oh no,” Harry moaned into the grass, and tried to wandlessly cast a spontaneous combustion spell on himself.
Harry shook his head. “That's not it. I... it's hard to explain, but I like... that you let me see you like this. I like that you trust me with this. And I like that I can help you. It's not just altruistic, it makes me feel better too.
Eden, meanwhile, was pleading with her roommate. “June, darling, you do need to come out! The Aurors are here, they have more questions.”
Hermione set the gifts aside with care so they could eat. Draco was amused to notice she ran her fingers lovingly down the spine of the book he had gifted her – some things would never change.
Harry isn’t sure whether to feel bad about being a distraction, or be upset because he’s clearly being blamed for something that isn’t his fault. In the end, he decides to let it go in favor of focusing on his gingerbread once more. He has decided to cut out far more animal shapes than he actually requires, in case some of them burn in the oven.
“Yes. Important ones.” Harry stood so hastily he nearly swept a potted plant off the corner of Malfoy’s desk. Fuck, he just couldn’t concentrate, not when he’d suddenly realised that Malfoy
So the question was…even if he could figure out what the instructions meant – would he follow them? The fact that the message had been encoded for Draco specifically meant it could only be from one of a handful of people who knew his public key, none of which were likely to have been in contact with Potter.
“Me too,” Harry murmured and pulled him close. It felt fantastic to have Draco’s head tucked so perfectly beneath his chin, to tangle their legs lazily, sated.
Draco stood there for far too long, wide-eyed. Slowly, the realization trickled in that Potter was looking confused.
There was a shriek. The two of them jumped to their feet, but then they heard laughter, and when Granger and Weasley came back into the room, they were smiling broadly.
“It’s Buglirg,” said the mother. “But I think nicknames are acceptable for little ones, so we call him Bug. I’m Graglor.”
He was still in a bit of shock over the entire revelation when they were walking back to the lifts, so he didn’t notice Marielle coming toward them until it was too late.
All because Harry had poured his heart and soul into a cathartic painting which showcased his feelings of love and desperation and longing.
“My mother never displayed any weakness if she could help it, never looked sick even when she was, never accepted assistance with anything. There was one moment though when she flinched and gasped, and afterwards, she seemed uncomfortable. She reached for her shawl but didn’t put it on, and she fanned her face at one point. It was out of character for her. I remember thinking maybe she was trying to manipulate us, get us to sympathize with her.”
Soon, he was careful not to be seen with Harry outside the eighth year common room, and that was it for their attempt at open friendship.
“Because we found one where Orval Amado was killed. So, either our culprit is ridiculously good at sneaking into the Department of Mysteries and getting back out, or…”
He begged and begged through the stinging hexes, wondering faintly just how much of a mess his sore back had to be by now. This was different from before, from hair-pulling and biting, which seemed like child's play compared to the deep, dark need that Harry was bringing to the surface in him with this.
Harry banged his forehead on the grass, which was not as dramatic as he’d hoped because it didn’t even make a good
“Well, yes, because blind panic doesn’t make for a very good baker, does it. You created a charcoal banana brick that way.”
“Because, Malfoy.” Potter's face took on a mulish look. “Because everyone has suffered enough from the war, even you. I don't want this to keep going, all the hate and the fear. And you just... you're not right. I can see you're not.”
“I don’t know, Hermione.” Potter scratched his head. “You say it isn’t possible to use the sand, but even you have been stumped by how else this stupid loop might have happened.”
All of the contestants obediently stow their wands in the drawers beneath their counters. There is quite a bit of cursing and slamming going on. Neville tells his wand an amusingly weepy goodbye.
“Well, still. I got you a window, so you’d best be thankful.” She started digging in her handbag as she sought Draco’s gaze. “How is he looking?”
“Hermione asked us to stop by the department,” were the words that greeted Draco when he entered his home after a very long day at the lab.
have any, but he suppressed the urge to make a remark about it. He was well-aware it wouldn’t be productive in the slightest.
For a long while, he simply sat there, looking on as his student kept recovering, and thinking. Then, suddenly, he straightened. Where was Potter? Hadn’t he said something about five minutes? How long had the impertinent brat been gone, twenty-five? Just as Severus was about to leave his chair and fetch the smug, arrogant wretch who was more than likely dawdling on purpose, a disheveled-looking Potter stepped through the door.
Harry will never know what comes over him when they walk to the back of the tent after time has been called. As Draco bumps shoulders with him, Harry snatches his previously injured hand almost on reflex, turning it over and studying the pale red line across the palm.
“Yes,” Harry agreed emphatically. “So obviously, I have to stop my flatmate from going out with him, see?”
Because it was one thing to know he was hated, but another thing entirely to look someone in the eyes as they told him he should have killed himself after the war if he had any decency at all. Like casting curses and hitting dead center, they had pelted him with the truths Draco tried so hard to fight. That he was a coward. That he wasn't worth the dirt under Harry's fingernails. That he should have joined his father in Azkaban. That the world would be better off without him.
go down that rabbit hole. It’s not going to end well, and there’s no point. Go home, use your days off to recover, and have a good talk with Clarke when you get back.”
He could see her desire for his help warring with her need for discretion plainly on her face, and decided to try and help the matter along.
“That’ll be easy,” Potter says. “I’ll just ask her to write down her ideas about reforming the Muggle Studies curriculum. She’ll be busy for days.”
Hermione rolled her eyes. “Well, no, but I don’t think the loop is long enough that you’d have had a chance to, by now. You’ve probably lost something like two or three years – I’m completely guessing, but I doubt it’s more than that.”
“Trying to figure out if you sent the flowers.” Ron yawned. “How are you going to let him know it was you, by the way?”
“Why isn’t he a lord, then?” Potter asked later, when they were making their way through Diagon Alley, searching for a specific flat. “Since his mother died and all. Isn’t that how it goes?”
Right, there was nothing for it. Harry took a deep breath, knelt, plunged one arm into the nearest gnomehole-
“The problem is that if I did, my mother would clobber me with the nearest antique vase and then start lecturing me on family bonds and loyalty as I lie on the floor bleeding.”
“I suppose you’d need to be extensively educated to truly appreciate the sort of quality and depth this piece has. How it exudes the artist’s calm confidence, the way he has expressed the joy and playfulness of the kitten-”
Malfoy, too, looked horrified that he had mentioned it. Harry winced. He opened his mouth to apologize, and Malfoy said hastily, “It just, er, it didn’t fit with the rest of the decor in here.” He went very red. Oh, Harry thought, and then
“Bloody bird,” Draco swore, a little too loudly. From the corner of his eye, he could see several heads turn, but he ignored them and focused on untying a small piece of parchment. Draco scowled, but his curiosity won out over the little voice that warned him to incinerate the damn thing without even reading it. He was never going to get over Harry this way.
The assistant didn’t waste any time and was out the door in the next second. Madam Pomfrey reached for the phial of blood replenisher and poured it down the throat of the still unconscious Draco. With a special massage technique, she coaxed his esophagus into swallowing – a trick she had, thankfully, learned many years ago from her mentor. Once that was done, she pressed the cloth to the wound to try and prevent Draco losing too much blood. She had given up on trying to heal the cut with magic – there was no way she would be able to do it without knowing the proper incantation. She hoped fervently that Severus, who had much more experience with dark curses, would be able to help.
“Why don’t you guess,” he said therefore. “Was it…A, an ex, or B, a one night stand, or C, my mother?”
For eight days, Draco avoided Harry’s eyes and stayed away from their bathroom. He went through classes in a haze, always present but never quite there. He started skipping meals again, because it was easy to do when no one cared. Such a simple matter to pretend that nothing had ever happened between Harry and him, as long as he kept himself lost in the haze of his own mind and didn’t so much as glance in the direction of the Gryffindors.
“It isn’t? It’s radiating heat, though. And I can hear it crackling.” Draco extended a hand and moved it through the warm air. “That’s a very good illusion.”
“By filling them all with your limbs? Mate, I hate to break it to you, but you wouldn’t have gotten very far.” The person crouched in front of him.
Draco capped the green marker he’d been using to highlight the spots where he would inject the serum to help fight cell decay into Potter’s body. He hadn’t needed to brew it fresh, thank Merlin, because that might have taken a month or two. It was still in an experimental stage – he’d been trying to develop something to help the formerly poisoned patients in his ward recover for a while – but this entire operation was experimental, and it was the best option they had.
He had directed the mint leaves onto a prepared cutting board and was now bewitching a knife to chop them haphazardly. Draco winced without meaning to.
“Because,” she said sharply, “I don’t know what else to do with it. Vanishing it could be catastrophic. The bell jar caused a lot of unforeseen consequences, and that was just a minuscule bit of time current that, from all I understand, snapped back into its original position right away. An amount of Time Sand as large as this is far more unpredictable and powerful. It isn’t even a magical substance as such, otherwise I could at least measure and calculate, but this…it’s just…it’s this strange, foreign element.”
Harry looked relieved – probably because it meant his gift hadn’t been inadequate, Draco supposed, and he had to admit he’d been relieved about the hat for the same reason.
“Strong stuff,” Harry said. He was slurring his words the slightest bit, which shouldn’t have been endearing. “Where’d you get it?”
“Mom is ecstatic. I had to talk her down from telling the next thirty people she saw. I mean, I don’t want to sound pessimistic, but Bill said that you never know at this stage if…you know, if everything will go well. And it made me realize how excited I am, even if I didn’t find out under ideal circumstances.”
“It’s the reason I ran away, that first day I saw the other one,” Potter said. Draco heard him as though they were standing in a large, echoing cave. “I had painted, well, it was something I imagined, about you and me, and then you said it that you thought it was a kitten, and that was a bit upsetting, to be honest. I…Malfoy? Are you…are you really mad at me? I’m sorry I didn’t just tell you, I really am, I didn’t know how.”
He was sitting in the library, trying desperately to catch up on his neglected homework, when Granger found him. She didn’t say anything right away, just sat next to him and opened her Arithmancy book. His concentration went out the window immediately. When Draco tried to move away, she placed her hand on his arm, making him jump. No one had purposely touched him since Harry.
“Ernie Macmillan, who is set to start a Ministry internship once he has taken his NEWTs, is disposing of his failure in a most un-Hufflepuff fashion,” Parkinson narrates promptly.
“Yes, er, as it happens, I am also not feeling well. Perhaps I should return once I know for certain I don’t have Mumblemumps.”
She shook her head. “I don’t think it’s a good idea to tell anyone else. Parvati might decide to question all of the Unspeakables or something of the sort, and if our poisoner has even the slightest inkling that we’re onto them, our job will probably get a lot more difficult. I’d like to avoid that. You haven’t told anyone, have you?”
“I heard,” Harry said when he finally entered. His cloak was wet, he had to have been outside until recently. “You were cornered by Ravenclaws?”
Hermione looked up from where she was on her knees before the fireplace and squinted at him, looking supremely unimpressed.
“It’s alright, I can…I can wait for some rain to loosen the earth a bit, or until Hermione finds a spell, or something,” Harry said. "Just…try to get me out of here before Draco comes home, that’s all I ask.”
“That’s essentially all there was to it,” Blaise said as he directed the silvery memory back into its vial. “She was forced to abandon him shortly after we left. Struggled to conjure a Patronus for help, but she managed it eventually. They couldn’t get the fire under control until it was far too late.”
"Merlin help us." Draco put his head in his hands just as he hear the Floo whooshing once more, and then again.
“I didn’t know what the spell would do,” Potter said quickly. He looked Severus directly in the eyes, as though trying to underline the truth of his words.
“You’re calling Parvati by her first name, and Harry as well now, don’t think I didn’t hear you earlier. Can you please just call me Hermione?”
“Do you like it, Potter?” he asked with a voice he tried to pretend wasn’t shaky, attempting a neutral, unaffected expression. But Harry didn’t respond. He looked almost…horrified. “I see that you don’t,” Draco went on, and oh fuck, he was drawling now, falling back into the old, familiar role of his Hogwarts-era self, and he didn’t seem to be able to stop. “I can’t say I’m surprised; your tastes always did seem to run a bit on the pedestrian side.”
“Hey!” Potter says, sounding annoyed, and that’s at least a bit more normal, but it barely registers. Draco stops dead, nearly dropping his book at the sight that meets him as he steps out from the semi-darkness of the shelves. There, at the table that was empty ten minutes ago, sits the most unlikely assortment of 8
“Exactly,” she said. “There was a cabinet full of them that was damaged during the battle that happened in the department. The cabinet was hit, with a Reducto or a Stupefy or something similar; it fell and shattered, and they all broke. And then all of the pieces flew back together, and it stood there just the way it had been. And then, it shattered again, and it reversed the damage, and shattered again…”
Then Harry shifted, reached for his wand, and, after casting another warming charm, cleared his throat. “Is there anything that you want me not to do? Anything you might not like?”
Apologies for the long absence, and a great big thank you to all the lovely comments I've received on this piece during that time. I suffer from cyclical depression among others, and it's been a difficult few months. I'm doing better now. Hopefully this new chapter meets expectations.
the poison takes until it works, I need to figure out what possibilities and circumstances would have allowed the poison to be transferred. A lot of it is intuitive because it’s based upon a poison with an extremely complex makeup. Any questioning needs to be dynamic so I can get all the information I need, which means I have to be there.”
The owl didn’t appear to think much of that nonsense. Once they were outside, she took off immediately.
Draco finished with the syringe and conjured up a small patch to stick on the skin. The stasis wouldn’t allow for any healing spells either, since those amplified and sped up the skin’s natural tendency to knit itself back together, and that tendency was currently inert.
“We need to catch this poisoner before they do more damage,” Draco said unnecessarily and ran his gloved hand through his hair, feeling anxious. He wished he’d have been in a state to do more work on the antidote, it might have helped him feel slightly less helpless, but his mind was a jumbled mess.
“I’ve never seen anything like it. I’ll need to neutralize it in several stages, and for the first one, I need the crystalline structure that quartz inherently has. I have to find a way to encapsulate –”
“That looks quite fun,” said Potter, but he made no motion to follow, so Draco doubted the veracity of the statement.
“Do you have any ideas get him unstuck, Minister?” asked Luna. “I thought we might wait for one to bite him and use its saliva for inspiration, but Harry seems really quite bothered by it.”
Draco found refuge in the calm and repetitive work of brewing. Tucked away in a far corner of the dungeons, he went about the business of squishing eel eyes with his silver knife, chopping rat tails and nettles and counting under his breath as he moved his stirring rod. His skin felt flushed from the heat of his burner. His nose stung from the fumes, and his fingers were stained a greenish brown.
“I’ve had this theory for a while but never a reason to try it out. The risk with eliminating a magical substance that can
“You know, I’m on excellent terms with Rita Skeeter,” said Potter. “She’s been looking for a bit of pureblood family gossip, did you know that? Apparently, Witch Weekly readers love that sort of thing.”
Draco snorted in both amusement and complete disbelief. Potter had some very strange ideas about how to convince people of something. He kept looking at the words, tracing them with his eyes, and only when he realized that his thumb was brushing over the letters of his own name in Harry’s handwriting did he snap out of it, cursing under his breath as he shoved the note into his pocket and tried to pretend it didn’t exist.
Potter sighed and stuffed his hands in his coat pockets while trying to put on what was probably supposed to be an exasperated expression. He’d gone quite minimal on the glamour today though, so Draco mostly just found it adorable. “The point is for it to spread festive cheer.”
“No one,” said Draco. “I couldn’t bear to look at it anymore, it was only a reminder of how badly I fucked up.”
“Put him on this first bed here, Mr. Potter,” she said, so fast that it took a few moments for the words to penetrate Harry’s brain.
“Thanks,” he said and was about to turn away when he realized she’d left his fringe plastered to his forehead. A moment later, he received a wink.
“Good times, weren’t they?” he said. “Especially that time I threw a bunch of mud at you and your friends and terrified the hell out of you when Crabbe pulled my Invisibility Cloak half off of me.”
“I’m not even denying it. It took me forever to realise.” Harry pulled Draco close, back to chest, and pressed a kiss to his nape.
“Has worked wonders when a direct confrontation never did!” she interrupted him. “Turns out that in some ways, the Slytherins had it right all along. All I’m doing is using their methods to stop those who deserve to be stopped.”
Theo tilts his head and narrows his eyes. “I’ll agree to that,” he says, “but only because I’ll lose the betting pool if it gets out at this point.”
“What Harry?” Parvati asked blankly. “I don’t know any…well, one, but he died, so who are you talking about?”
Harry desperately casts for a change of topic, and eventually settles on the obvious. “Happy with your roll?”
“I’ve been having to deal with this all my life, you know,” Harry said. “People making decisions about my life. People making assumptions about me, and having all these stupid expectations. I thought the worst would be over by now, with the war over, but this… this I didn’t expect. I didn’t think you’d do that to me, not after everything. I want to live my own life don’t you get it?”
“That’s what we’re trying to figure out.” Draco looked down at the bits of information Parvati had given them. “Secretary Fletcher was alone in the room when she died, is that correct?”
Draco stiffened his back and tried to look as proud as one could while huddled up on a bathroom floor.
“Of course,” said Draco, who felt terrible for the girl. It had only been three weeks since she’d lost her mother, and from what Parvati had told them, it seemed Charlotte barely knew her father at all.  “We’ll try to keep this as short as we can, I’m sure talking about it is incredibly difficult.”
were invasive, the sorts of questions we’re about to ask might not be received well. Best way to make her feel at ease and get something out of her.”
“Yes, but Parvati needs to understand, because we can’t afford to lose her trust,” Draco pointed out. “And if that happens, we might not be able to solve the case, and you know who needs us to solve this? Fucking
Weasley reached across the table to take her hand. “It’s going to be fine though. Right? If we’re careful, it has to be fine.”
“Right, so,” she said, once the fire was bright and crackling. “I…I lied, yesterday, and I wanted to apologize for that. It’s not something that I think could be relevant, and I’ve kept this to myself for so long that frankly, I didn’t even think about mentioning it until I had time to think.”
, Harry remembered the scrawled note in the margin. If there was any situation appropriate for it, then this one was it.
Hermione blinked several times, then looked away and cleared her throat. “I asked Parvati to look into what might have happened between Penelope and Sylvana Brown, by the way, and what it has to do with the Janus Thickey Ward.”
“Me too,” Potter said, snapping Draco out of his burgeoning anxiety attack. “I mean…cairn, obviously. But even before, it was, you know…” He trailed off, then cleared his throat. “This is a really weird conversation.”
“What?” Draco asked and stared at Harry, whose expression had undergone a remarkable change. “You’ve…Merlin, Potter, you’ve figured it out, haven’t you?”
Blaise did an impressive amount of shaking before pouring the now sparkling green gin into the glasses over crushed ice. Once he was finished, he adjusted his sleeves, reached for the crème de mure and cleared his throat.
Harry didn’t pace, but he made up for it by looking more aggravated than Draco had ever seen him. “Could try dispelling it with the Elder Wand.”
Harry didn’t respond. He just kept running, running, pulling Draco with him, and then he opened a door and they staggered inside, and Draco nearly fell down a number of huge stone steps. He threw himself backward, landed painfully and gritted his teeth to try and ignore the pain shooting through his wrist.
Time seems to fly. Harry works as though possessed, slams his sponge into the oven and gets started on his filling. He is hasty, fumbles a bowl, and it falls to the ground as he curses.
When he came back down, he found himself clinging to Potter and panting into his neck. His legs shook madly, there was a soft buzzing sound in his ears, and he was slick with sweat. Potter was holding him a little awkwardly, half propping him against the wall, and Draco didn't understand why until a few minutes later, when he could finally stand on his own and Potter let him go, just to turn away and quickly adjust himself.
“Let’s go to the post office,” Potter said, and that was when Draco realized Potter had been looking at him while Draco’s zoned-out gaze had been fixed on Potter’s lips. His face heated immediately.
“Hm?” Granger asked and raised her head from the file she’d been glaring at as though it had personally offended her. “Oh. No, no, that one actually is real.”
“Exactly that,” said Potter. “And if you’re wondering how I came to be there, I’ll tell you that too, because it’s a ridiculous answer: The stupid thing had a hole in the top that the grass had grown over, and when I stepped on it, I fell in.”
I had always planned to finish this story, but writer's block is a bitch, and so is mental illness, of which I have a generous heaping (and it's steadily getting worse). I'm thrilled that so many people like this story, but very sorry you all had to wait so long without knowing if I'd ever post the last couple of chapters.
Everyone was silent and looked at each other. Evadne headbutted Harry’s forearm and he started scratching her behind the ears absent-mindedly. “What?”
“One of them says something else that’s true, but there was no way he could have known. There was no way
Draco had never seen it, of course, but he knew the rumors, and he’d heard retellings of the battle that had happened here at the end of his fifth year. Those made it seem impossible enough.
to go on, and all Draco could do was to keep fighting for every life that hung in the balance in his ward so that their loss wouldn’t leave yet another scar on their battle-worn generation.
“Well, he could have one assistant, right?” Granger bargained. “To take notes? We’d use a glamour and everything.”
Draco hadn't expected it. Maybe that was why his knees went so weak, and he leaned against Potter with an embarrassing gurgling whimper, the sound bouncing through the room. His hair was still being pulled, and now Potter's teeth were sending his nerve endings a different sort of pain, and both of these together sent him spiraling away from anything resembling coherency. Heat rose up in him, all the way from his toes to the top of his head, and he could feel his skin flushing. He was hard, suddenly, achingly hard, and he couldn't bring himself to be embarrassed about it. He was too busy savoring the sensations and reaching the high of pain and pleasure that seemed to be what he lived for these days.
“Sure we have, mate,” said Weasley, reached forward and grabbed an entire handful of candy canes. “We’ve got it narrowed down to only a few people, haven’t we? That’s got to count for something.”
“Oh, fine,” Potter said eventually and threw his hands up, coming to a stop. “Don’t let me have any fun.”
“Potter,” Draco hissed, more quietly but also with more emphasis as he moved to block the way. “No!”
That did sting. Draco was not about to let it slide; his professional pride wouldn’t let him. “I didn’t even know the two were related until I looked at the blood sample you gave me. Granger brought me in to develop an antidote for the exact same poison, and I became more and more disturbed by it the more I analysed it, and when I realized it was a serial poisoning, I was quite shaken, truth be told. I really am the most qualified person to figure it out, I wasn’t just pretending.”
“Aren’t you worried that the alcohol will overtake the other flavors?” Parkinson has clearly done her homework, because Harry knows that three weeks ago, she had never even
It’s fiddly work, and there isn’t a good spell to keep the delicate cake layer from breaking, at least not one that Harry’s found. Behind him, Hermione’s muttering grows increasingly desperate. Padma is crying into her crumbling peppermint mocha creation, and Neville switches frantically between comforting her and finishing his own work. At the station next to Harry’s, Draco keeps blotting his face with a monogramed handkerchief, and Ernie, who insists on calling his roll a
“It wouldn’t have helped you solve it,” Draco said. “What happened is a bit insane, and we haven’t even figured out the extent of it yet, but it’s the reason why we are so interested in who’s behind this.”
“I’m going to go help Victoria, but I highly recommend that the lot of you keep a safe distance. If you don’t, I will not be held responsible for my actions.”
“Oh, well, that makes it all better. Forgive me for being the slightest bit concerned that an item I’m responsible for has somehow found its way into your house without me even being aware that it was missing, because that
Parvati said her goodbyes and allowed Granger to walk her to the door. Draco found the ensuing silence moderately awkward, but it might have just been his imagination, since he couldn’t get the memory of the noises Harry had made just before his orgasm out of his head.
“And I suppose you can’t tell me what it was?” Blaise rolled his eyes as both Draco and Potter shook their heads. “Fine, you drama queens, I’ll forgive it this once. Oh, stop doing that, Draco, I’m not going to steal your bloody falafel!”
Potter sighed repeatedly. Draco couldn’t help but wonder if an upside-down Instant Illusion Christmas tree might lighten the atmosphere or at least give Potter something less upsetting to think about.
“Simply point your wand at the floor,” said Granger, who had come over to them. “Now, please, Draco. You’re sending salad and…is that tahini sauce? – floating toward Mercury.”
“Good.” Potter gives him a bright smile and turns to Blaise, who does not get a smile, Draco notes with satisfaction. “So why wasn’t
“No, you idiot, it’s a joke,” said Draco. “And we were never together in the first place, because she’s been pining after a certain Ravenclaw for a good ten years, and I’m gay as a parade.”
“Fine,” Severus hissed. He still looked furious but was obviously trying to control himself. Conjuring himself another chair, he sat opposite Harry, who was staring at Draco with empty eyes.
“I’m just frustrated. Before I get into that though, and before I forget, Potter says thanks for sending Bones to him.”
“Oh, Harry.” Granger stood and hurried to his side so she could put her arms around him and hug him tightly. “We can figure this out. I promise we can.”
“Alright,” she said and took a few shaky steps into the living room. Draco didn’t think she was entirely sober. She also wasn't wearing shoes and he feared for the soles of her feet.
“He's still a person, Dean.” Potter sounded annoyed. “I saw you flirting with Parkinson at the Halloween Party, you know. If you can forget all about her trying to hand me over to Voldemort, you can stop calling Malfoy a Death Eater.”
“Alright,” Potter said and blinked at him, “How’s that: I’ll give you one question in exchange for your silence in the matter.”
“Parvati, please,” she said. “I know. Sorry about ambushing you, but I’m under a lot of pressure. The latest victim is one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight, and Robards is panicking.”
He drew the blood with sure movements, wincing when he had to fight against the plunger’s resistance.
“Sorry, sorry, I know I’m a few minutes late, Doris cornered me in the elevator, and I was forced to ride up and back down three times, talking standardised broom bristle curvature the entire way.” He smiled apologetically and dropped into the visitor’s chair in front of Draco’s desk at the very same moment Draco’s heart dropped into the general vicinity of his kneecaps.
Draco knelt next to Harry’s body and then looked up at the woman with the shaved head. “That’s…Muriel, right? The one I haven’t met yet?”
“He certainly won’t wake before the morning,” sighed the matron. “In the meantime, we can do nothing but hope he will make a full recovery.” She turned to the professor. “Thank you for coming so quickly. I really don’t know how I would have stopped the bleeding.”
related to him, I think there’s a good chance she got her hands on them. It’s obviously just a theory, but now that we know what we’re looking for, it shouldn’t be too difficult to establish whether –”
“Well, I already told the last Auror who asked, I don’t think you can be a politician without having somebody get upset at you. Got a threatening owl or two, but nothing recent.”
“I’d really like to talk to her,” said an obviously sad Potter once Parvati had left and Draco had gone to the bedroom to let him know. “And Susan too. And, well, a lot more people, after the rest of the Weasleys, of course.” He sighed and ran his fingers through his hair.
“The stuff on my arm.” Potter raised the arm in question. “She still won’t let me see all of it, but from what I’ve gathered by now, it’s stuff that I really
Draco laughed. He couldn't have held it back for the world. The understatement was just that priceless. Harry looked taken aback for a moment, but then a self-deprecating little smile appeared on his face.
There was no reply. Draco pulled out his own wand and made his way down a different corridor to the office Smith and Clearwater shared, adjacent to the Hall of Prophecy.
“Oh yes.” She grinned at him. “I’d been working alongside Victoria for several days already by that point – I didn’t want you to burst in and realize immediately that something wasn’t as it seemed. You two are wonderfully predictable sometimes.”
“I’m sorry, what?” Draco’s eyes flicked to the only diagnostic spell he hadn’t cancelled yet. “The stasis didn’t –”
“Yes, well, while my stick-in-the-mud co-host is busy being mind-numbingly boring, let’s take a look at the rankings. At the very bottom of the leaderboard is Hermione Granger-”
“Bake!” they chorus, and everyone under the white canopy springs into action – that is, everyone but Luna, who calmly floats over to Padma, just to touch her shoulder and wish her good luck. Harry makes a wild grab for his ingredients and gets started separating eggs, knowing he needs to get his ginger spice sponge into the oven as fast as possible, so he can focus on perfecting his maple cream filling. He likes to think his flavor combination is a good compromise between simple and complex, and the ideal way to start the competition when he doesn’t yet know what the judges are looking for.
Harry was suddenly worried. There was no way he wanted to lose the Half Blood Prince’s advice. This year had been the best he’d ever done in potions, and now he was supposed to give the book to his most hated teacher? He was reluctant, although a little voice in his mind pointed out that it was unfair to everyone else if his success had been brought forth from someone else’s knowledge.
Weasley pressed his lips together and crossed his arms. “I don’t know,” he said frostily. “How many more secrets are there that I haven’t been told?”
Reflexively, Draco clutched a fistful of his expensive velvet-lined cloak. School uniform fitting might have been be well enough, but Madam Malkin’s wasn’t precisely known for its spot-on tailoring services. “But…it might, er, mess with the warming charms.”
Draco opens his mouth, but the clever idea he’s expecting does not do him the favour of popping into existence.
“I dunno, mate, I just noticed it too.” A dark-haired man had popped up next to Draco, newspaper held in a limp hand as he studied the sight with a puzzled frown.
“So,” said Victoria, leaning against the door jamb and squinting at Draco, who had decided to spend the latter half of his day working on the antidote despite it being his day off. His hours would be irregular from now on anyway, since he was once again being temporarily employed by the Ministry and had to be available for witness interviews and the like.
“Go on, say something else,” the woman encouraged. “Can’t know if it’s working otherwise, now can I? Well?”
Draco glanced over at Potter, who was patiently reassuring Parvati, arm around her shoulders, and it suddenly hit him how very lucky he was to have gotten this chance. Less than three weeks ago, he’d lived an average and rather boring life, content but lonely, feeling distantly sad about the fact that Harry Potter had died two years prior. Now, his heart squeezed painfully at the thought, and…Merlin, he’d sat on Potter’s lap the day before and they’d…
“Oh, right.” Potter glanced down at himself like he could figure out the answer that way. Then he gave Draco a weak but guileless smile and leaned back comfortably. “Okay.”
Draco took another bite and grinned around his spoon, because seeing Weasley wince and cower was brilliant. A moment later, his free hand was taken by Harry, who was smiling broadly.
“It’s not an advertisement, you daft buggers,” said a girl of maybe sixteen with a glittering black knit cap on her head. “It’s to make you smile.”
Potter nodded, staring straight ahead. Then he turned abruptly and pressed his forehead to Draco’s shoulder.
it hurts to know that.” He groped blindly for the Floo powder and threw an entire fistful into the flames. By the time Potter had managed to follow, Draco had reached his bedroom, locked the door, and thrown the stupid wreath on the floor as an afterthought.
“And I promise I’ll be better in the future,” Granger added, and finally, Weasley’s shoulders dropped and he sighed.
“Our plan is that I take the time sand bubble, wrap myself in my cloak and throw myself through the Veil.”
Merlin, that name. Draco would never get used to Potter casually using it in conversation, just like that. He would never be able to hear it without flinching, without flashing back to those months of terror and fear and disgust at himself and everyone around him, retching after he was forced to torture, to-
“Well, same. Hermione still hasn’t heard back from the French Ministry about her, you know. She’s sent three missives.”
It happened in Charms, as the class practiced basic silent casting. The only sounds in the classroom were Flitwick's voice, encouraging and praising, the occasional shout of triumph whenever someone managed to Summon their designated handkerchief from across the room, and of course Finnegan's cursing whenever his wand acted up again. So far, he had managed to singe Granger's hair, turn his handkerchief yellow, and make the room smell like lavender, and Draco was just thinking that it was high time Finnigan had Ollivander take a look at that worthless piece of wood he was waving around. Once again, Finnigan shot a glare across the room and raised his wand.
“Well, that was a catastrophe,” Draco says as they walk out of the tent together. Far in front of them, they can see Hermione lecturing Ron, presumably about his lack of commentator neutrality when it comes to Draco. She’d already whacked him over the head with a whisk – a dirty one – back in the tent. Ron now has bits of ganache in his hair.
After a long moment of silence, Harry said, “Susan’s wand was made of rowan. Her second one, after the war. She told me it helped her decide to become an Auror, knowing that her wand was made to preserve life and not destroy it.”
So Draco did. With a face like stone, he repeated everything he remembered, every last nasty word, the heartfelt wishes that he would drop dead,
With those words, Severus Snape left. On his way back to the dungeons he came across the caretaker, Filch, wiping away the blood in the corridor while muttering angrily. He ignored his students’ questioning gazes – the faster these gossiping brats forgot the incident, the better. It would be bad enough having to tell Albus about the matter once he had finally returned – whenever that might be.
“But you should,” he insisted, trying desperately to blink the tears out of his eyes. Thunder sounded in the background.
“Shut it,” Harry said. He couldn’t seem to stop worrying his lip between his teeth, so he’d given up trying. “It was different from how he usually looks. He didn’t even seem to remember that I was really rude and ran out of his office two days ago. It was just this…”
“Wait,” Harry said. His head was positively spinning with this new truth. “How long have you known?”
“Did she mention what she was going to work on?” Potter asked. He was only supposed to sit and take notes while Draco asked the questions, but Draco probably shouldn’t have expected that to actually happen.
“Oh, dear,” says Parkinson. “It looks like the stress is getting the better of this reformed bad boy, dear audience.”
“Well,” Harry said and plucked at the fabric of his shirt, “as a matter of fact, Hannah didn’t look like she minded all that much. Partially, I'm sure, she was glad to get away from Seamus, because he's piss-drunk and he was weeping in her lap about his wand hating him, before Blaise very gallantly dragged him away by his ankle, but partially...I think she just likes him. The lines are blurring more and more, you know. People are… they’re starting to get along. Healing.”
“I should go back to class,” Potter said awkwardly. “Are you going to be all right? I'll... I'll tell them you went to see Pomfrey for a calming draught.”
“I think you’re working toward some kind of goal,” Granger said. “And you get a little closer each time, and then leave yourself another hint for the next loop.”
Harry’s stack of sponges is a bit wonky, but he’s pretty sure he’s got the order right, darkest to lightest. It’s a good thing, because time is almost up, and he has yet to make his ganache, which is supposed to cover the outside of the cake. As he starts heating up his cream, he notices from the corner of his eye that Draco is doing the same.
; she didn’t focus on getting through the defenses of one opponent at the risk of leaving herself vulnerable to the other. Instead she used the environment to her advantage to buy herself time. A chandelier came flying at the man and forced him to dodge, distracting him just long enough for Bones to turn the floor beneath the woman’s feet to slippery ice. As she flailed, a spell hurled two chairs at the man to keep him occupied, and the woman only managed to cast a single curse, which went wide, before a bright light flashed right in front of her face and messed with her eyesight.
“Oh, right,” said Sky, and came over to drape the knitted blanket that had been lying there over Harry’s lap and tuck him in. “See?”
Harry stroked back up his arms, slow and firm. “We were still planning on going back to the Christmas market, weren’t we? You could buy them one of those spinning wooden pyramids with the candles.”
Eventually, they found the address they had been looking for ten steps into a narrow side street, fairly close to where they had been looking.
Draco grinned, but just like that, there was a dull sadness making his chest hurt, because he loved spending time with Harry like this, and he wouldn’t have this any more once the loop restarted. Depending on how different the next loop ended up being, he might not ever have it again. The thought really, really hurt.
Hermione beamed as she lit them with her wand and then directed them up to hang beneath the ceiling.
He cleared his throat. “No, um, we should…we should get started.” Feebly, he lifted the folder he had brought.
On those days when Draco felt he needed to hurt, they would meet in the bathroom in the evening. At first, Draco communicated his need by narrowing his eyes at Potter across the Great Hall during dinner. Soon, however, Potter started anticipating him – because he looked more agitated in class, Draco supposed – and heading Draco off before dinner. Once, it happened when Potter was with Weasley and Granger, and Potter said something to them with a smile and a small wave before stepping right up to Draco. The two other members of the Golden Trio didn't seem surprised at all. Weasley rolled his eyes and Granger smiled fondly at her boyfriend before they turned and continued on their way.
There was a moment of silence. They both knew why they were there, but it was difficult to breach the topic. Draco waited – because after all, Harry was the Gryffindor – but when there was only more silence and some awkward shifting, he closed his eyes and took a deep breath.
When Granger did it instead, Draco learned that it was now almost one in the morning. Once the shock and excitement wore off, he’d be ready to keel over.
Clearwater deflated and sighed. “I honestly, truly wish I hadn’t been forced to do that to her. But you lot just wouldn’t leave well enough alone. Look at you, you haven’t even learned from it – otherwise you wouldn’t have gone through my things and I wouldn’t be standing here hating the fact that I have to keep the information from getting out.”
Draco rubbed his eyes and said, “Oh, right. Yes, we should do that, I’m terribly behind with buying presents.”
Eventually, when they’re absolutely utterly sure the two of them are gone, Draco and Potter untangle their limbs. Potter pulls off the invisibility cloak and stares at Draco, who stares back with wide eyes.
“Well, my guess would be that he’s desperately in love with you and therefore doesn’t want you to think badly of him.”
have a leak then. But we’re all exhausted and doing literally nothing else, and we can’t sustain that.”
Draco tried to look at Potter without making it obvious, which was a little difficult because both Potter and Blaise were staring at him now.
Potter huffed a tense-sounding laugh. “Yes. Hermione suggested it, because I’m rubbish at talking about the things that bother me, and she thought a different kind of outlet might help. It did, at that. And as it turns out, I’m not half-bad at it.” He flushed, as though embarrassed to acknowledge a strength of his.
He snarled viciously at the frightened-looking Harry. “By Merlin’s balls, what were you thinking, you foolish, insufferable brat! Did you lose your-”
“Thanks,” she said. “That’s the sort of thing every girl likes to hear.” She held open the door to her office and shut it tightly once they were all inside, then went to her desk and lobbed an Instant Fireplace at the wall with too much force.
“Nothing. Didn’t recognize anyone, didn’t know what her name was…she wasn’t surprised by magic, but she couldn’t name a single spell either. It’s…well, it’s awful. It also terrifies me – the thought of this happening to more people I care about, I mean. The poison is still out there.”
“I did do a sort of apprenticeship with a muggle haematologist as well, actually,” Draco said as he disinfected the crook of Potter’s elbow with a swipe of his wand. There was a bit of writing there, quite small, that he’d have to avoid. “The father of one of the Muggleborn trainee healers. Almost every poison is carried by blood or affects it in some way, it would have been extremely daft not to learn everything I could.”
Blaise went to a chest next to his desk and came back with two bottles of butterbeer. Draco accepted one gratefully. His throat felt dry and scratchy.
“Look, do you remember when Draco cast the spell to check Harry’s age, and it showed two different numbers? Even with the time loop shenanigans going on, it should have just given us the older Harry’s age, the one who’d already gone through all the iterations. But it gave us
“I was just thinking about that.” Absently, Draco took out his wand to send a stray traveling cloak back to its proper rack, then tucked it away again, then took it out once more to re-fold a uniform and promptly realized this was just another form of fidgeting.
“That’s quite alright,” she said. “I want Lena’s killer caught so badly. She didn’t deserve what happened to her, not one bit. They say it’s a poison – is that true? How could that have happened?”
Hermione sighed again. “If I had to guess – because Death couldn’t just grab you and physically toss you out. The younger Harry was on his way out, and he took the older Harry with him once they were combined and Death rid himself of both at once.”
“Give it a rest, Potter, it’s been hard on her,” Draco said, and tried to ignore the way they both looked at him in surprise. “She’s technically not supposed to tell him anything at all, and she’s been dealing with shock and stress.”
“She only joined us a few days ago. We thought she just wanted a warm, dry spot to take a nap and maybe a full belly, but she seems to have appointed herself Hospitality Manager and decided to work for her keep.”
“I'm sure I have no idea what you're talking about, Potter,” Draco said. “The Malfoy name is obviously as revered as ever, these days. Why, clearly my father is held in the most luxurious cell in all of Azkaban. What more could I ask for?”
"Setting things on fire and explosions are not technically the same thing, and anyway, I can leave off that step if it makes your little rabbit heart happy."
"That's a lot more than the vast majority of pureblood wizards," she pointed out. "They're used to confirm pregnancies, and to check on development of the fetus at certain points throughout. To check the sex, too, though of course we won't have need for that part."
“That was the most fun I’ve ever had in that place,” Draco said when they were back out on the street. “Thanks.”
The corner of Granger’s mouth twitched. “Yes, well, Ron and George wanted it to be as realistic as possible. They put quite a bit of work into it.”
“Yes, let’s try and avoid that.” Harry frowned. “Isn’t there a muggle film about a man who is stuck in a time loop, but it doesn’t break even when he kills himself?”
Potter’s eyes damn near bulged out of his head. “Malfoy, are you…are you saying you’ve never had street food?”
"Cheers." Blaise ripped Bartholomew out of Draco's hands and set it carefully on the kitchen counter, then fluffed the leaves.
, and so Harry had been forced to figure it out through a combination of clever detective work and process of elimination.
“No cause for alarm, dear audience,” says Ron. “It’s just our favorite Dark Lord vanquisher throwing pots and pans at everyone.”
Harry wasn’t sure what to think about anyone wanting to know about his fight with Draco for the entertainment value. “It was about…he’s going on a date later tonight.”
But Potter was in true stasis, utterly frozen. He could be moved to a certain extent, but he wasn’t aging, his brain not sending a single signal, the blood in his veins completely still. He was, for all intents and purposes, suspended in time. The Unspeakables weren’t fucking around.
Granger gnawed on her lip. She looked like she was internally debating something, so he waited while he cleaned up and Vanished the used needle.
Victoria rolled her eyes again. “Oh, yes, why would you want to know what he’s feeling, that couldn’t possibly help.”
“Oh,” everyone said at once, disappointedly. Then, “Bless you!” when Evadne sneezed once more as she came wandering back to them.
“The curse-breaker’s assistant did it because her uncle was faking his illness and she was trying to expose him in the most convoluted manner possible. There, consider us even.” Blaise laid the book down and smirked.
“I don’t know, Blaise,” Draco said tiredly. “And it’s really none of my business. It’s not like I’ll be around for much longer in any case.”
“Right.” Potter laid aside the parchment he’d been holding, which had a lot of text and lines on it and was folded in a complicated way. He pulled up the sleeve of his jumper and allowed the words on his skin to unscramble and sharpen, apparently able to reveal them wandlessly now.
Draco frowned at the floor as he tried to remember what he could about his flight. He saw Potter only at the periphery of his vision. “I was the only one who ran though, wasn't I?”
"Well then you should be able to answer your own question. Ah." Blaise  had opened a cupboard and was now taking a number of glasses out of it. "I am going to mix drinks."
Twenty minutes later, Harry is staring in awe at the cooling golden-brown mass inside his cauldron. He’s done it, finally, he’s made caramel. As he starts putting together his cake, using the caramel sauce as mortar, he feels the envious stares of both Hermione and Draco.
That makes Draco pause. Sane Granger is scary enough and packs a mean punch – literally – and he does not want to find out how much more vindictive a not-sane Granger might be. “Fine, we’ll interrogate very politely.”
year table in the Great Hall, but they managed surprisingly well, and since the two of them feuding was nothing out of the ordinary, no one paid them the slightest bit of attention, which suited Draco just fine.
He felt a soft touch at his chin, and when he opened his eyes, he saw the apprentice healer, Holly, who looked him over.
He washed his hands and afterwards reached for his wand and cast a Scourgify on them for good measure. Then. he began the task of closing Orval back up, carefully stitching together the cuts he had made. He was thankful he could use magic for it. He didn’t think he’d have the stomach to do it the muggle way.
“Potter, you prat,” Draco said, laughing, and because he was in such a good mood with the poisoner having been caught and no time loop to worry about, he allowed himself no more than a small grimace and put on the bobble hat Harry had so thoughtfully bought for him. It was soft and warm.
They left the Space Room and walked along the much brighter corridor to what seemed to be Granger’s office. One glance told Draco that Potter had been right – she looked tense and worried and somehow conflicted.
, on the wall, like it was any old painting, like it was pleasing to look at and nothing more, like…like…”
“No,” said Clara. “Only to the door, and sometimes to the desk, quick-like, to give her files. She was very professional, and so was I, we didn’t just stand and chat all the time.”
“Well, I mean, I wish he hadn’t done it, of course,” Granger said with a sigh, “but this whole mess wouldn’t have happened if only I’d told Ron right away. I can only blame myself.”
Draco took a deep breath to keep from panicking, then another. “I assume so,” he managed to reply after that.
“Clothes off,” he said, and Draco obeyed. His fingers still shook as he tried to work out the buttons, but then, that wasn’t anything new. He lost his shirt and his trousers and socks and pants, and then he let himself be bent over a sink and closed his eyes while Harry kissed and touched every single inch of his skin. They stopped only once so Harry could warm the air in the room with a spell, getting Draco to stop shivering quite so pathetically. Soon, he was wrapped around Draco like a warm blanket, holding him tightly while his tongue and teeth savaged Draco’s neck and created the marks Draco loved so much. There was very little pain, which was fine, because at the moment Draco didn’t need it. Later, perhaps, Harry would experiment with biting and hair pulling and stinging hexes during sex, would turn Draco inside out with the conflicting sensations and send him to that floating headspace he so loved.
”I see…” Dumbledore says in an even softer voice, barely above a whisper. ”And is Arthur seriously injured?”
Harry is starting to get really worried, but when they filter into classroom 1B for Double Transfiguration with the Gryffindors, he forgets all about it because on a small stool in the far corner of the classroom sits Toad Face with a smug smirk on her face and a clipboard in her lap.
”Why don’t you try being nice”, Harry tells him pleasantly. ”A novel and revolutionising idea, I know. But it
Harry stops and stares at the words he’s just written, unaware of the ink blot growing out of the tip of the paused quill and slowly consuming the
”Worthless and traitorous as you are, you did help me return to my body… and Lord Voldemort rewards his helpers…”
Harry takes a deep breath and, looking up again, opens his mouth to tell Ron that he’s fine, but just then the doors to the Hospital Wing swing open with a sigh and he snaps his mouth shut again. Remus and Dumbledore stride through the doorway, both looking very serious — But, Harry can’t help but notice, very twinkly-eyed as well, as if they’re trying very hard to keep their faces that serious, when in fact, they rather be beaming…
”Yeah”, he says, discreetly slipping his hand under the desk and brushing his fingers over the other boy’s thigh. ”That’s all… and I’m back on the team.”
Remus refrains from retorting, but the frown stays etched on his face until Harry changes the subject and tells him the class can’t wait to have him back and that they’re less than impressed with Snape filling in for him.
”Hi guys”, the dark-skinned slytherin says, squinting up at them with a cool smile. ”Did you just get here?”
”Not since sun down”, she says brightly. ”I don’t know about before then. I was in the Prefects’ bathroom on the fifth floor—”
There is a series of muted gasps and whimpers amongst the students and they exchange worried looks. Even Pansy, who usually waves away any talk of monsters with a nonchalant hand wave, sure of her own safety because of her pureblood status, looks anxious.
”Don’t call him that”, Harry mumbles, his voice muffled against the other boy’s neck. ”I think that girl has got some Veela in her, he probably didn’t know what he was doing…”
”Yes… And as I watched, the petal sank towards the bottom of the bowl, but… Before it reached the bottom it transformed into a goldfish. It was incredible magic.
”Right, silly me, I should have known we’re keeping them alive for their immense use as — of, remind me again, Granger — what are they useful for? Oh, wait, I forgot,
He pulls on the blonde’s arm impatiently and drags him over to the door. This is it, he thinks. He can feel his heart pumping valiantly in his chest, sending bursts of adrenaline through his body and his fingers trembling slightly around the wand gripped in his hand. He glances down to make sure that Draco has got his wand ready as well.
Then with surprising speed, the man had leapt forward and snatched the Map from him. After inspecting the parchment quickly, he’d floo called Harry’s daddy who, Harry found out later, had been searching for Harry on the fifth floor of the castle.
Bowled over by a sudden onslaught of memories of flying glass and angry words, his dads arguing over a picture in the Prophet, a picture of the Weasley family and — and
He returns to the doorway which lead to the First Years’ dormitory and discovers a small passage which leads to a staircase going further down into the shadowed depths of the dungeons. With trepidation, Harry begins to descend the stairs. Thinking that, if the First Year dormitory is located at the top, the logical assumption would be that the Fifth Year dormitory should be five floors down, he stops on the fifth flight of stairs and opens the door as carefully and quietly as possible.
”Don’t you own an owl?” Professor Snape says when Harry’s dragged the trunk halfway across the threshold.
Whipping his head to the side, Harry is shocked to see Seamus waving at him from a corner of the room, sitting rather comfortably next to Blaise Zabini on a love seat and talking to Pansy Parkinsson and —
Unsure of how much time has passed but aware that he spent at least a quarter of his allotted hour fighting the Grindylows, Harry feels a paradoxically calm sense of panic set in and pocketing his wand again, he begins to swim in earnest.
”What?” Harry looks from Pansy to Draco. ”I don’t know — I mean, yes”, he shakes his head a little. ”Yes, his mum’s a witch and his dad’s a muggle, I don’t know how he got Sorted into Slytherin, but he did. And so did I, well… I actually asked to be—”
”— And not, at Hogwarts, terrible things are about to happen, are perhaps happening already, and I cannot let Harry Potter stay here bnow that history is to repeat itself, and the Chamber of Secrets is open once more —”
”I believe that’s what I said”, Snape mutters. ”The rest of you hurry up, or you’ll be late for Charms…”
Harry glances over at Draco again and the unmistakable twitch in the other boy’s lips is the only thing keeping him from flipping Lockhart the bird and marching out of the classroom. He takes a deep breath, and starts babbling again, except actual words this time…
With another meaningful look at Diggory to hand over the reigns, Professor Snape takes a step back. But instead of resuming his seat behind the desk, he begins sweeping around the classroom and pins each of them with a steady gaze whenever Diggory interacts with them, to ensure exemplary behaviour.
”Just be safe”, Remus intones. ”We’ll still be here waiting for you tomorrow, so there’s no need to get careless.”
Malfoy’s hair is wet, which would explain the smell of coconut. His eyes are very red as well, Harry can see. The ball in his stomach turns over and grows a little heavier when he thinks about what that means.
Harry is seized by an irrational fear of having an embarrassing love note recited to him by an angry dwarf in paper wings, and spins on his heel and starts to run away… Unfortunately, the dwarf is much more adapt at weaving his way through the crowd and manages to overtake Harry next to a long queue of giggling first-years.
”Won’t you stay for tea?” Harry asks him with an imploring look. ”Dad was called in to work, so he’s not here, if that’s what you’re worried about…”
”No, that’s imposs— Wait, what?” Harry says, blinking and fixing his eyes on the other man once more. ”What did you say?”
He loops an arm around Harry’s neck and pulls him in for a quick nuzzle and peck on the forehead, before shuffling aside so that Sirius can get his goodbye hug as well.
”Nah, I’m knackered… I’ll see you in the morning”, Harry says and makes his way to the Third Year dormitory.
”You can’t go on like this, Harry”, Remus replies sternly. ”It’s extremely dangerous to deprive yourself of sleep, especially on a regular basis like you’ve been doing —
It was Ginny Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets… Ginny who strangled the school roosters and daubed threatening messages on the wall in their blood—” he lets out another laugh. ”She didn’t know what she was doing at first, of course. The diary entries certainly got more entertaining after that, though…
He’s not sure exactly when that happened; it must have been happening gradually all year, because he can’t pinpoint a moment when he started thinking
”Fine…” Harry says with a shrug and then starts rattling off anything that he can think of that might serve as evidence, from their timetable to the location and interior decor of the Slytherin Common Room.
