Harry stutters, “I- Yes- How- how did you know?”
He picks up his glasses and walks from the washroom without looking in the mirror again.
“It’s ok. Take a second. Maybe after this, we should go get some food too. Yeah?”
Draco feels sick to his stomach as the other boy furiously rubs his eyes, clearly fighting tears. He says something to Hermione in a small voice and the girl looks stricken. Her face falling, bushy hair shaking back and forth as she clearly tries to argue whatever he just said.
And if the blond softly starts singing again, his hands rubbing comforting circles on Harry’s back…
He then quickly hugs Hermione and compliments her intensely, causing her to blush the way he had just moments before. She compliments him softly in return and then the ball begins.
“We’re so proud of you darling.”
Cedric smiles knowingly and Harry can’t help but think he’s much more observant than is particularly safe. “Sure thing Harry, we need to hang out more often.”
What kind of room does he need now? He thinks it will just give him whatever he wants, but he isn’t sure.
“I’m not kidding, Draco. You’re already feeling his emotions this intensely… when did the mark even get color? Right before school started, if I remember from your letters correctly. Though I still can’t believe you didn’t tell me who it was.”
Harry starts thrashing, large amounts of bubbles leaving his mouth - clearly screaming, though it cant be heard over the sounds of his struggle and the song still playing in the background.
I listened to for much of this chapter. I really liked this cover and felt like it fit the mood so I hope you like it too.
” He says, “
This chapter is a good 700 words longer than my average. I think it's good but I also am sleep deprived and running a fever so who knows.
So I'm not doing too well right now.
Harry stares after her in complete shock until two more mermaids break the surface, one dragging a very angry Krum and another a struggling Cedric, both of the boys crying out that they still had to save their hostage.
He sighs and starts guiding Potter into a proper dance position. “I’ll be the girl, in order to teach you how to lead, but that information does not leave this room.” He grabs Potter's right hand and places it on his shoulder blade, then places his left hand on Potter's upper arm, and finally takes Potters free hand with his own, holding it at eye level between them. “This is dance position. You do not leave this position unless turning or lifting the girl.”
He glares at the door for a couple minutes before it opens again. “Yes, you will need the robes, for now just go. Where should I bring them when I’m done?”
Curiosity gets the better of him and he pushes it open to find a wide-open room with a record player on the side and a mirror over the entire far wall.
He then places the parchment against his hip and steps up to Potter. “Remember, this isn’t meant to be sexual, the connection is on the side of our hips, not dead on.” He fully settles into dance position now and begins counting again.
It’s odd how fast one can fall asleep when they feel safe and secure, but rather beautiful in its own way.
Save him.
In case you were wondering,
He nods and opens his mouth to sing the notes, surprised at how well it works as the water flows freely through his neck without gargling the sound.
“How am I supposed to ask a girl to the ball when they all travel in packs?” He grumbles to Harry later that day. “I reckon, who are you gonna ask?”
drown for some silly competition.”
When Ron’s scream breaks out Harry can honestly feel his heart stop, deathly afraid of something happening to his best friend.
“Draco?” She said, waving a hand gently in front of his face.
“We’ll distract him. Ok? You rip your wand away and we’ll use whatever time we have to protect you as you run for the cup.”
Fleur in last with her 10 points today and… however many from the first task… he should really figure that out.
” He whispers harshly before taking off after him, for once in his life not caring if anybody sees him.
Not quite true to his word, Potter shows up 13 minutes later. Draco jokes about this being a day for the history books - Harry Potter
Harry smiles, then gets an idea. “Ron, I know your family doesn’t exactly share the ideologies of most of the pureblood society, but how is most of the wizarding world with things like homosexual relations.”
come say hi!
Pans, I was
Harry
She smiles, “That’s my boy.”
He says over the bond, smiling as the other boy jerks upright before relaxing into a smile.
“Ready, set, go.” He pulls potter into the movement and counts slowly. “1-2-3, 1-2-3, 1-2-3, 1-2-3.” He stops the movement again. “Good, just keep your head up. Now, try it closer together.”
Ron is waiting for him in the dormitory and stands to join him when he walks through the door. “We better hurry mate,” he says, “We’re gonna be late.”
“Shhh. Shh. It’s ok. You can tell me later. Or you don’t have to. Right now though? Just focus on me. I’m here. Everything's ok.”
Together they just sit there, wrapped in each other's arms, until Dumbledore bursts through the door, wand at the ready.
Granger is seated nearby, surrounded by a sea of books and Ron has fallen asleep on the table and there is nothing Draco can do to help because Harry, in his stress, has blocked him from his mind.
A truly terrible title, but descriptive nonetheless. Basic definitions and purposes are really all they have time for.
Can we all just take a moment and appreciate that Skeeter got a beetle as her animagus, like... what if she'd gotten a lion or something? What would she do?
Should I edit the tags on this?... yeah probably... I will... later...
Harry pulls him closer.
“Hiya Harry. What’s up?”
both boys think at the same time.
and message me there!
On another note, I'm so sorry this chapter took me ages. It was the last couple weeks of the quarter and I've been dealing with some court stuff and just... didn't have a lot of time. So thank you for being so patient and sticking with me and my sporadic updates!
Like. Excuse me????
Harry shoves up a wall in front of the other boy's presence in his mind as he ducks back underwater, showing no other sign he heard the words at all.
"'Harry, I've left a letter telling your aunt and uncle not to worry -' 'They won't,' said Harry. 'That you're safe -' 'that'll just depress them.' ' - and that you'll see them next summer.' 'Do I have to?' Lupin smiled but made no answer."
Now is where Harry feels slightly nervous, supposedly the Siren will respond, but not in words, and one wrong move on his part could ruin the deal.
Idly flipping through the first few pages as he wanders back to his table nothing immediately pops out as helpful. In fact, nothing seems even remotely plausible.
She keeps saying things like that for a few minutes. Just repeating that they aren’t his emotions and he can just push them out of his head. Silly things that make no sense... until it suddenly works and he feels like himself again.
“Ah. Ace as in ‘asexual.’ Means he doesn’t feel sexual attraction. We think he might be aro too - as in doesn’t feel romantic attraction - but he’s never told us so we don’t really talk about that much.”
Except, of course, the fact that he somehow needed to get to the village without drowning.
“What's with the long face?” Harry asks him between giggles.
The bead of light has slowly slides closer to his wand as he’s distracted.
Draco knows he’s just trying to change the topic, pretend his mask hadn’t just slipped. but Draco knows what that's like, too, so if he ignores it who can blame him?
He says through the bonds, somehow Draco knows exactly where he means.
That means the standings going into the third task are:
Ron had explained the argument he had with Hermione last night - and to Harry her exclamation of “Ask me before someone else does!” Meant she had wanted him to ask her… He didn’t say that though.
He sighs and goes to put the book on the shelf again when he suddenly feels like drowning. A rush of noise fills his head, he feels closed in on all sides and suddenly finds himself gasping for air and clinging to the shelf as if it were a lifeline.
He shakes his head again and listens in.
Come find me
Silence follows for a very long time, Harry and the Siren never breaking eye contact.
He looks at the clock on the wall and sighs.
Harry just shakes his head softly and squeezes him tighter before he’s yanked roughly to his feet by none other than Professor Moody.
“It's
“Yes. Hi. Hello. I’ve been sitting two tables that way,” he says with a vague gesture, “this entire time and just saw the weasel and his girlfriend leaving in your time of need.”
Harry blushes. “
Potter scoffs. “
I'm lonely
“If you’re implying that you aren’t stunning, far more stunning than myself, you are sorely mistaken. I must admit you nearly took my breath away.”
“You could always ask one of the other champions? Maybe Fleur?”

heard!” He shouts over the screeching.
“bring them to me after dinner, leave early enough and we can meet here for a few minutes before Cedric gets here - this is where you’re meeting him right?”
“My name! I didn’t!”
(See the end of the chapter for
Before he knows it the second task is upon them. Draco watches helplessly as Harry paces a short distance away in the library with his desperate last-minute attempt to find some spell or another to help with the task.
So far their only luck had been finding some way to negotiate and trade with the merpeople. Which, yeah, was very important and helpful, but only if Harry could, you know,
With the pale arms around his waist and the gentle presence in his mind, Harry finally lets himself relax, and the tiny bit of adrenalin keeping him awake finally slips away.
Mal... Draco pulls Harry into his arms and through the door as the room softly begins playing music.
“What now Draco darling, it really is about time for me to start getting ready for the ball.”
The mermaids each help their treasure to shore where they gratefully accept the offered towels, blankets and Pepperups.

” He reaches out and ruffles Dracos hair, pulling a squawk from the other boy as he bats the hand away.

Harry feels Draco wrap his arms securely around his middle and tuck his face into his hair. “Bloody hell Harry. I thought I’d lost you.” He says quietly.
“Hermione!” he cries patting Cedric's arm and leaving him with a smile, and a whispered, “I’ll be back soon.”
The conversation then turns to who Ron should ask, and Ron groans that he wishes he knew who was on the other end of his own mark.
in order to negotiate.
“That would certainly make a splash.” Ron laughs. “You might wanna be careful though, if your soulmate isn’t a guy it could ruin your chances with them in the future.” He pauses and seems to think through his next line. “I really am curious, why not just ask whoever
Draco, however, remains still. Staring at Harry, mouth open in the form of a small ‘o’. “
He then turns and waves goodbye to his friends and leaves the Great Hall, quickly making his way to what is quickly becoming his favorite spot in the castle.
Snape and McGonagall step through after him, rushing their students. Snape pulls Draco one way, McGonagall pulls Harry another. They let it happen, for the moment, bond buzzing between them.
He steps towards Potter and firmly slots his right leg between the other boys, causing him to blush deeply. Draco glares in response. “Get your mind out of the gutter, the waltz is a very beautiful,
Probably nothing that would be great for Harry’s system… but it would work until the kiss likely overpowered it and thus stopped its effects.
Sure, when he explains what has happened people get upset. Ron and Hermione are angry at the Dursleys. They wish they could get him out.
Harry smiles a bit to himself and pushes towards the surface. “

“I… What?”
Harry purposefully ignores what he
For a castle with so many rooms, it was surprising how many of them
“Champions!” She cries, nearly out of breath - clearly, she’d been looking for them for a while. “There you are! You need to come line up… where are your dates?”
“Have you been taught to duel, Harry Potter?” Voldemort's hideous voice scrapes out of his hideous face. “We bow to each other Harry. Come now, the niceties must be observed.”
the ball Pans! I told Potter I would alter his robes so they weren’t so plain, but I forgot to do it! Well, I didn’t forget I just don’t know how! My elves always do it for me but I forgot I couldn’t ask them to do Potters without explaining why I had his robes in the first place!”
hasn’t seen his friends, the only thing keeping him from panicking is the comforting feel of Draco’s mind next to his own.
Harry looks at him helplessly and that’s how Draco knows it’s deeper than that - he’s seen the look in the mirror enough times to know that.
you would’ve told me if I no longer had a date to the ball?”
love. Which is why no one ever talks about them. The weaker, common bonds are easy to ignore, just a colorful fluttering shape like any other tattoo. But it’s rumored that, every once in a while, there are much stronger bonds. Strong enough to transfer feelings or even thoughts. Strong enough to mean the difference between success and failure, life and death… however, those are just rumors, so none of you have to worry about that.”
Hot tears roll down his cheeks. “Mom!” She comes over and stands by his shoulder.
“Plants….. NEVILLE!”
This chapter was originally meant to go with the last one, I meant to finish off the tournament. But then it got really really long - like more than twice as long as my average chapter - so it became two!
Potter sticks out his tongue but steps up to Draco. “
She hesitates, “Ron… I have no clue what it means, and no we haven’t talked about it. In fact, I’ve avoided touching him since his birthday so his may not even be colored yet. I don’t know. But enough about mine, show me yours!”
As soon as that final corner is rounded the air leaves his lungs.
That’s the thing about stuff like this, most people just don’t understand. You can sit and explain it all day long, but they will never truly get it unless they live through it themselves. It works about as well as explaining compassion to a muggle rubber duck. So you just suffer in silence, hoping it will be ok one day.
“Where is he?” The man cries. Draco just lifts an arm and points to his crumpled form.
By the time he hears Draco slip into the water his lungs ache and he still hasn't taken in a word of the song.
Draco just needs to remember to ask how he found Longbottom so fast…..
mentioned shaving his head - but it was still hard. Once again, he doesn’t push it, and continues without speaking in the bond.”
A chuckle escapes his mouth when the door that appears is in the shape of a giant egg - gold designs spiraling across the front. He swats away a beetle with a shiny green shell and steps inside, barely making it through the door when he's practically tackled from behind right as the door clicks shut - pale arms encircling his waist.
Strange, but not unheard of, he just shrugs and makes his way to the Great Hall to quickly eat some breakfast, waving to the other students he sees on his way.
” He almost doesn’t want to know the answer.

Harry takes his arm with a blush and waves goodbye to Ron, who he assumes needs to meet his date somewhere. Then replies to Cedric.
“Welcome, Siren speaker.” Is all they say before they turn around and swim away, silently bidding him to follow and thus prove he truly knows their ways.
He gets a mental image of the other boy sticking out his tongue and gasps.
Harry closes his mouth with an audible
“Practicing would probably be good, but give me a little bit to actually get the hang of waltzing before we do, yeah?”
Harry smiles a little but is snapped back to reality when Ron frantically waves a hand in front of his face.
His lungs burn, he needs air and knows Harry does too. If he breathes in now it’s all over.
He personally thought if Hermione wanted to go out with Ron so bad she should allow them to have physical contact so Ron knew they were soulmates.
“Thank you! Now, what the
So, he slips underwater and immediately notices two things.
The other boy just shakes his head and waits a few minutes before leaving for the Great Hall himself.
Hannah blushed when she noticed all three Slytherin boys' highly offended expressions.
At her words, Draco's eyes glinted and without any warning, he suddenly bit down
Draco's eyes narrowed as he flicked his gaze back and forth between the two girls. His suspicions were immediately confirmed when he felt a trickle of glee filter down through his and Aria's mate bond. Since he was pretty sure that he wasn't feeling particularly gleeful about anything, Draco realized that the feeling was Aria's — and he
"Shall we go?"
He turned around very slowly, staring at Aria with a strange, expression on his face that almost made her want to run away; but she didn't falter. Her heart was pounding rapidly in her chest, and she felt so unbelievably raw and exposed and vulnerable as she stood there, but still, she stayed exactly where she was.
After a quick trek through the school grounds, the two Slytherins finally reached the quidditch pitch. As they entered through the stands, Aria fought the urge to groan at the sight of Slughorn, Draco and the rest of the Slytherin quidditch team, all of which were in their complete quidditch uniforms as they waited in the center of the field.
Draco took a deep inhale of breath to calm himself down before reaching up to massage his temples in frustration.
"Well this changes everything." Blaise's lips twitched upwards into an amused smirk. "Now I understand why you always had a soft spot for Potter and her friends." He teased, earning a glare from Greg.
"Tell me the truth, Draco."
Draco snickered at his words. "You're lucky Luna wasn't the one who found it."
Surprisingly, she had grown used to his weird flirting at this point so Aria was unaffected by his antics and just rolled her eyes at him.
When she heard the Gryffindor side of the classroom groaning loudly in disappointment, Aria's eyes narrowed and she flicked her gaze to the back of the room, glaring halfheartedly at Ron. Her best friend just gave her a sheepish grimace and pointed frantically to a grinning, completely unrepentant Seamus Finnigan sitting beside him.
Draco glared at him. "Thank you for that."
As soon as she was gone, Draco turned to Aria and gave her a nonplussed look.
of her sweaty, male teammates. When her veela senses became too overwhelmed by all the different male scents, she
Unfortunately, things didn't work out and it was all incredibly bad timing.
Aria followed his gaze, chuckling when she saw what he was staring at. "Those are just portable cameras, Draco. I think they're taking pictures of us." She explained.
Since this chapter is a bit longer than my usual ones, the next one may take awhile. Hope you're all enjoying the story so far. Reviews, comments and kudos are love! :)

Draco brushed past her without another word, leaving a glassy-eyed Aria staring helplessly after him as he walked back towards the castle.

And speaking of classes, she'd definitely be lying if she said she didn't miss having Hermione beside her during long, boring lectures.
The elderly nurse shook her head and gave Aria one last doting smile before she nodded at her in approval and stepped back out through the curtains. As soon as Madam Pomfrey was gone, Aria sighed softly before turning to give Ron a wry smile.
matter?!" Aria blurted out, only for Hermione to silence her by nudging her sharply in the ribs.
Aria froze in her seat and blinked at her in surprise.
Aria's eyes widened and she couldn't prevent a small, obnoxious grin from curling her lips. "Aww...I knew I'd eventually grow on you. Admit it, already. You like me, don't you?

Wood glanced at the blackboard again, watching as the floating piece of chalk continued to write down everything he mentioned so far. "More importantly, we also have a
"If this is you trying to make me feel better, you're absolutely terrible at it, Hermione." Aria retorted sarcastically but she was also smiling as she chuckled and allowed Hermione to give her another tight hug before pulling away. She remained seated on the bed beside Aria, however, and both girls looked up to see Ron watching them with a bemused grin on his face.
"Wait up, sweetheart." Blaise called out sarcastically behind her as he and the rest of their housemates followed after her on their way to the Great Hall.
"Wha—what are you doing?" Aria stammered.
"It's not that bad. If it helps, our uniform seems to suit you better than your old Gryffindork ones do." He drawled, smirking slightly when she gave him a deadpan glare in response.
"But weren't you just telling us the other day about how much of a prick your boyfriend was being for hanging out with another girl so much?" Aria asked bluntly.
"You can't be their new seeker, you
"Yes, because they'd just
; and she felt a strange, magnetic pull from somewhere in the middle of the crowd. It called out to her veela blood, warm and soothing, drawing her towards it like a moth to a flame. She allowed herself to follow the pull for awhile, her eyes scouring through the sea of faces before her until she finally found herself staring at her mate's hooded figure behind a tall row of photographers.
By the time she reached his forearm and Draco realized what she was going to do, he stiffened. He almost pulled away but Aria shushed him gently, pressing him back down onto the bed. Before he could protest, she grazed her lips against his Dark Mark, gently kissing and licking along the rough, scarred skin until Draco furiously began to shake his head and he sat up, pulling his arm away and hiding it from her view.
"Why Potter, I am

"Hey—"
couldn't break free. Bentley continued to ignore her reaction, his blue eyes glowing inhumanly bright as he spoke.
Thankfully, Aria didn't seem to mind his unexpected public display of affection.
"Yes, I'm sure! Leave me alone, Aria!"
"I said I'm
Astoria slowly detached herself from Blaise and took a careful step toward him.
Eventually, they reached the hospital wing and Aria hissed in pain as Ron deposited her carefully into one of the beds near the back of the room. Fortunately, the room was empty of other students as most of them were probably still gathered outside in the quidditch pitch. With a sigh, Hermione pulled the thick curtains around Aria's bed, shielding her from view.

"You wish." She snorted, releasing her grip on his shoulder and giving him a mocking pat on the head. "Anyway, you all enjoy yourselves. But you, and you—" She cast a pointed look at Neville and Zach, giving both boys a teasing grin. "—make sure to hold your liquor this time."
"That's not your choice to make! No matter what your intentions were, I'm not a doll for you to control, Draco!" She screamed at him.
Neville raised his hand and Draco had to force himself to look up when Fleur called on him, still haunted by the image of a veela's wings (if he was being honest with himself, it was
"Er…Malfoy?"
Aria saw Hermione wave at her as she entered the hall with Millicent Bulstrode, Lisa Turpin and Su Li. She reluctantly waved back, knowing full well that Hermione would notice how tired she looked even from way across the room. Sure enough, her brown-haired best friend gave her a worried scowl but Aria just rolled her eyes and shooed her away.
Even after Blaise and Pansy returned, both Slytherins looking a little rattled as they sat down to explain the situation to the rest of them, Aria still hadn't moved from her seat and continued to remain silent as she listened to them.
"Draco, stop pissing him off!"
"Because it seems to me that you've already figured this whole thing out. Haven't you?" She ignored the way Blaise and Draco exchanged a worried look and finally stopped, standing directly in front of where Aria was sitting on the couch.
"You're welcome."
when I think about it though." Ron ignored the way Aria began slapping his arm and continued, schooling his face into an exaggeratedly disgusted grimace. "I mean, the idea of you and that ferret making out – all kissing and hugging and exchanging saliva – eurrrghhhh! Just…
There was also something oddly
"I know it's ridiculous! But I just—"
When Draco couldn't seem to do anything other than let out a strangled gasp in response, she smiled and yanked off the remaining glove she was still wearing, using both of her bare hands to cup his face. His eyes closed and he tilted his head upwards at the same time Aria leaned down and pressed her lips against his.
"I don't really want to talk about it."
She paused and waited until the murmurs and whispers that rippled through the crowd died down before she spoke again.
"Lay off her, Pansy."
A few minutes later, after all of the nosy spectators who had gathered to watch Draco and Potter had dispersed and the remaining students in the common room resumed their previous activities, Pansy walked over to the seat Potter had just vacated. Ignoring the questioning look Blaise was giving her, she frowned and reached down to pick up the strange lone item that was left on the dark green seat.

"The answer to that,
At the incredulous looks she received from them both, Hermione hesitated.
"Basically, instead of a discussion, Instructor Delacour has so kindly agreed to take part in a question and answer discourse that will dispel most of the common misconceptions some of you may have about veelas. Be sure to make the most out of this opportunity as this will also help you with your research assignment on veela." McGonagall added sternly.
kiss her! You're not supposed to kiss anyone but
Zach rolled his eyes at her quip while Neville reddened and gave her a sheepish grin, deliberately looking away when Pansy turned her head to glare reproachfully at him. Chuckling, Aria gave them one last smile and wave before she walked off, heading towards the doors of the common room. As she left and everyone resumed their earlier conversations, Blaise turned to Draco.
As he maneuvered his Nimbus 2001 through the air, Aria's other hand wrapped tightly around his shoulders, her gloved fingers gently brushing against his nape. Draco felt his stomach jump when Aria leaned in even closer, tilting her head so that her face was pressed against the side of his neck. They both
Zach eventually re-joined the loud, cheering horde of Slytherins gathered in the middle of the tent; and after a few minutes of Aria watching him and Neville get goaded into another ridiculous drinking contest against Blaise and Draco, she shook her head and let out an amused chuckle.
"Go ahead then." Aria challenged, her eyes glinting as she smiled coldly at him and leaned back against her bed. "Reject me and let's get this whole thing over with."
Still chuckling, she followed Blaise through the many twists and turns of the school's corridors until they reached the outside of the castle.
Thank you all again so much for your love and patience! You're all so lovely and awesome and I wouldn't have been able to finish this without your support! Please continue to stay safe and healthy and I wish you all the best!

It was on the fourth day of Draco's break from school when Narcissa suddenly owled him, inviting him to have breakfast with her in a quaint, little café across the street from his flat. Truth be told, Draco wasn't really in the mood to talk to

Draco huffs, having read something similar several dozen times. He quickly skims the rest of the chapter on mermaids, all of which just confirms what he already knew.
After sending out dozens of letters and eating food for the first time in days, Neville forces him to go to bed even though it’s still rather early in the evening.
Draco raises an eyebrow.

“Is he back?” he growls out.
He gently reaches out and runs a hand along the other boys dark locks.
Harry sighs and then pulls his school robe over his head before unbuttoning his shirt.

He pulls them on as quick as he can, but loses confidence before stepping in front of the mirror. As he looks down at his toes peeking from the hem of his slacks he feels as small as he’s ever felt. Horrid thoughts fill his head and he crumples to the floor like a rag doll blown in the wind.
Harry just rolls his eyes and slips his shirt off his shoulders before going for his belt. He hurries and slips into the water, ignoring Dracos horrified stare.

When breakfast is over and neither Ron nor Hermione have shown themselves he starts to get a little nervous, but it isn't until he has to head down to the lake for fear of being late that he really starts to worry.
A group of four mermaids surges forward to untie each ‘treasure’ and then motion for him to swim upwards, which he does with them following close behind.
The last thing he registers is his body starting to shake, and then he’s no longer in the basin with Draco.
Hermione looks like she’s about to say something else, and probably does, but he misses it when Draco suddenly screams ‘
. And
Fleur is the only other champion that seems actually happy with the outcome of this task and immediately pulls Harry into her side, securely trapping him in another hug.
He can feel Draco's excitement along with his own. Perfect.
He fights the urge to wipe his eyes.
There was true fear in Draco’s eyes when they met Harry’s, but his face was an impassive mask. That night Harry goes to the library and picks up a fairytale book, hoping to find something on soulmarks.
“Hey, Hedwig. What’ve you got there?” He says as he unties the little package and pats her head.
“So… What’s your mark? I know everyone seems to think it’s taboo, but I think it’s rather intriguing.”
He says, ‘
“I think there are two things. One: Study the tales like you already planned. Two: You need to talk to Potter. As for knowing, I always wanted to be a ‘Drawn’ so I studied them.”
How to fix this.

Draco shoots to his feet then, “
He shrugs, “I got some dress robes from Madame Malkins this summer. Although they’re fairly basic. I might try to alter them a bit with some spells. Maybe add color or something so they aren’t so plain.”
“Oh my… just… give me the robes. I’ll alter them. He wanted color and a bit more style yeah?” He nods and turns around, running to grab them. “And just to be clear Draco, even though you didn’t tell me
Nothing. I'm terrible at writing. Idk why you guys read this. It's 56 pages of a google doc and absolute garbage. I appreciate you none the less. But are you ok?
Steeling his nerves, he let out the shaky breath he had been holding in and slowly extended his hand out towards her, causing Aria to stiffen in alarm and look up at him with wide green eyes.
come from him, suddenly popped into his head and he was startled when he felt a powerful wave of lust jolt right through him, shooting all the way down to his crotch.
"Malfoy!"
"Wait a minute, Pansy, that was uncalled for. I didn't mean—"
Ignoring the confused look Blaise gave him, he snatched the other boy's wand and held it up in the air, wordlessly summoning something from the bottom of his trunk all the way back in the dungeons. He knew it would take a while before the summoned item would reach them, so Draco reluctantly turned his attention back to Aria.
"Your other Hufflepuff friends?" Aria tried again.
"No, everything's fine! It's just that…Well…" When Hermione paused again and bit her lip, Ron finally seemed to have lost his patience and turned to Aria with a wide, ecstatic grin.
"Go away! I don't want to talk right now!"
"Umm..."
"Is it true that a veela cannot harm her mate?" Granger asked.
When he leaned in and did just that, Aria shivered and she reluctantly turned around under the blankets to face him.
She wore a dark green gown with a seductive V-neckline; but instead of sleeves, the gown covered her right arm with beautiful, intricate appliqués. Save for a simple, silver bracelet on her wrist, her left arm was bare, exposing a generous amount of skin; and her dark hair was twisted into an elegant braid on the top of her head, half of the thick mass cascading past her shoulders in thick, loose curls.
"Huh?"
" Blaise shrugged and gestured calmly to Draco's hands which, he only just noticed, were still trembling as he wrung his fingers together.
Eventually, Draco and Aria were the only ones remaining on the field.
Draco's eyes were wide as he stared at their clasped hands in awed silence. Ignoring the weird, fluttering sensation he felt somewhere in the pit of his stomach, his fingers tightened slowly around hers as he looked up and met Aria's warm gaze with his own.
"Pansy,
Her wings sagged as she dropped down to her knees and gave Draco one last, pained smile.
The next chapter will be Oliver Wood's discussion on vampires, and the last quidditch match of the year (Gryffindor vs. Slytherin) ;D
"You seem to know an awful lot about veelas."
"All those hours she spent training certainly kept her mind off what happened during the war. To be honest, all of us have been trying something new nowadays. It helps us forget about—" Ron's voice broke and he immediately cut himself off, averting his gaze from Ginny to stare at the ground by his feet.
"Yeah, er…Hi. I'm really sorry to bother you two again so soon after the war but—" Aria swallowed the lump in her throat and managed a nervous laugh at their gobsmacked expressions. "Something kind of…
"Nah, I didn't hate him either." Aria answered with another quick shake of her head. "I always just found him annoying but he never really did anything to make me truly hate him."
you for defamation, Potter!"
The blond boy stumbles back and Harry catches him, pulling him close and squeezing him tight.
The blonde reaches out his hand. “
“Oh. Ok.”
As Harry reaches out to take his hand something in the bond shifts, pulling a gasp from each boy.
“Yes, Pans, we’re still going together. We both know I could never show up with him.”
besides, even if I wanted to talk to him, he's always with the Weasel and the beaver. I refuse to even try.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Cedric chuckles at the compliment, smiling over at Harry. “I didn’t take you to be one smooth with words!
And with that the dark-haired boy literally jumps from his chair, knocking it down, and pulls a piece of scrap parchment from his satchel before taking off from the library at a run.
A very toothy smile splits the Sirens face, the sight of their pointing teeth making his blood run cold, though he forces himself to stay calm. Moments later they place a firm kiss on his cheek and his body glows before returning to its pre-Gillyweed state, though he still can breathe and feels just as at home in the water.
dance style. Now bend your legs and keep the connection of our thighs and hips.”
Harry smiles and slides out of bed, walking over to Ron’s, only to find it empty.
The spells collide and become one, Harry feels his arms shaking and senses Death Eaters rushing forward to help. “No!” Voldemort screams, “I will beat him on my own! Stay back!”
“7th floor. Corridor with the ballet trolls. Don’t come into the room. You’ll freak him out. Just stick them behind the tapestry and I’ll come to grab them.” She nods and the door starts to close again. “And Pans? Thank you.”
Draco blushes and looks away the moment he realizes what the song is saying, and doesn’t realize Potter doing the same. After all, this time the room had responded to both of them.
He nods, “Ok! Ok. I love you.”
Harry smiles, faking much more confidence than he feels.
They still haven’t spoken through the bond again, however neither is blocking the other out and emotions flow freely between the two. Draco doesn’t exactly know what he feels as he watches Potter dance so freely - every wall removed and radiating pure joy rather than something tainted with darkness as usual, and as he wishes for some way to express it magic radiates around them and the room responds and a new song starts playing.
Harry forces his way to his feet, gasping after being hit with the cruciatus for the second time, but now he’s free of the grave and wand in hand. He has a chance.
Anyway. I love you all and thank you so much for reading. It means a lot!
“Perfect! Then I just have one more question, Lead or follow?”
Dumbledore smiles and continues, “His use of the Gillyweed plant to reach the village where he was not only successful in recovering his own treasure, but that of the other three champions as well. Then, of course, returning to the surface right with the hour. To him, we award him 50 points.”
“Blimey! Who would say no to you? You’re the boy who lived
He shakes his head, “Maybe, but not my connection. That's what really matters.”
Also... does anyone know how many points Fleur gets canonically in the first task? I can't seem to find it anywhere...
It may or may not earn him a wack in the shoulder.
“Yep. She full-on man-handled me to find the mark and see it. So I would have to find someone that fits the memo.”
“Of course, I wouldn’t want -” The rest of his answer is cut off as she smashes a kiss to each of his cheeks before running off again to hold her sister.
He sighs and rolls up his sleeve. Hermione is about to say something when Ron’s voice calls out.
’ he replies, ‘
bloody second.”
“I mean… It's a start?”
Potter shuffles his feet, “I… Well I wasn’t.”
five: I'm dropping out of school and becoming a stripper. It's too stressful. I'm literally drowning in school work and tests.
Easy.
A large and distant bang covers their identical gasps of pain, and their thick jackets cover the glow they know emanates from their forearms. They make fearful eye contact for a moment before they yank their hands away from each other and send one last glare before marching off in opposite directions.
Harry has to hold back a chuckle. Ron, of course, notices.
’ in his head.
That’s when everything got harder to ignore.
I got so many comments last chapter! That was insane! I know it's not a lot compared to some big authors out there, but I think it was the most I've ever gotten on a single chapter! It means so much to me that you guys enjoy my writing! You're all so amazing and I love you all!
“It was you, wasn’t it?" Harry says loudly, "You’re the one that put my name in the cup.” Draco’s eyes widen at his words and he subconsciously holds tighter to Harry’s hand. “You’re the one that imperioused Krum to attack the other contestants. Aren’t you? I barely stopped him! He would’ve killed Fleur!”
“Harry!” His voice is less soft now.
Malfoy is casually leaning against the wall outside their room, head back, eyes closed, and just as casually putting everyone and everything else to shame with his looks.
“Oh, Harry, my boy, Dumbledore would want you to show manners, now wouldn’t he? The weaker wizard must bow first, to show they submit to the power of the stronger man.” He lazily points his wand in Harry’s direction, mumbling yet another unforgivable.
Draco just slowly nods.
And as if his words triggered a further spell the two rise into the sky and over the heads of the gathered circle, a golden netting flying out from a central bead of light and creating a barrier around them.
Harry gargles out more screams around the water in his lungs and Draco drops to his knees and pulls the other boy into his lap. Blunt nails sting his skin as the other boy refuses to give up the fight.
must be rubbing off on you.” He says, raising an eyebrow in implication.
Potter. He’s scared
Malfoy stubbornly stays quiet and Harry remembers the song from the night before and starts humming the melody in his mind. It only takes about three minutes for Malfoy to stop whining and projecting thoughts of covering his ears.
Draco smiles at the sudden panic.
He exclaims,
A few hours later Harry is back in his own dorm and panicking. He’d had a lot of fun with Malfoy this afternoon, listening to goofy music as the other boy did his hair before handing him robes neatly wrapped in paper, but now he felt like it might all be a joke.
In the end, he pulls a book off the shelf titled
Potter swallows and looks down again, but Draco feels the wall against his mind drop.
She humphs and rolls her eyes, but when Draco comes back - dress robes in hand - she accepts them without question and shoos him away. “Go get whatever you need to ready. Maybe plan a time to sneak away and share a dance or something.” She keeps mumbling to herself but Dracos already been pushed out the door, having it slamed shut behind him. He sticks his tongue out at the wall and humphs, folding his arms.
Sorry this chapter took me a minute to get out! School is... hectic...
On another note, I think I broke... something in my hand because I can no longer move my pinky finger and moving my ring finger causes large amounts of pain. Crossing the fingers on my other hand that there aren't any typos. You use those two fingers a lot when typing...
No more mermaid lore. They have that part covered.
like a freaking Slytherin. Worst of all, Malfoy wasn't answering the bond.
For the entirety of the chapter I had "Did someone say Draco Malfoy?" From "A Very Potter Musical" stuck in my head on repeat.
the man known as Alastor Moody, is cuffed and locked in a small room. Harry is led to the infirmary where he is nearly stormed by the other champions before McGonagall shoos them away.  Aurors show up and try to question him before Pomfrey shoos them away. Then he shoos
Harry wanders down the hallway the next morning and finds himself locking the door to a stall in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom, then he throws pebbles with his mind.
Two: Underwater the egg no longer emits screams, but rather a haunting song. A beautiful song, but haunting nonetheless.
Sorry this took forever. I got major major writer's block and rewrote this like. 50 times. But, the next chapter is already halfway written.
Harry pulls at Draco’s arm.
That doesn’t mean he wants people staring at them.
“Thank you all for your patience with this task! Now, let us see how the points fall. In fourth place, we have Miss Fleur Delacour, to whom we award 10 points for her successful bubblehead charm. Next, we have Mr. Viktor Krum, to whom we award 15 points, for his partially successful self transfiguration and his ability to nearly make it to the village. In second place Mr. Cedric Diggory, to whom we award 20 points, who also successfully performed the bubblehead charm and of course his ability to make it to the village, though just outside of the hour mark. Then, of course, in first place Mr. Harry Potter with his use of…” He trails off and looks expectantly at Harry.
He dives right down after him, wrapping his arms securely around his waist to pull him to the surface.
“Why don’t they believe me?” He gasps out, “I didn’t want this. I didn’t do it!” His forearm starts burning and he collapses in on himself.
It takes a moment before he realizes he isn’t scared
Harry had originally thought there was no way he would fall asleep, but the next thing he knows a soft hoot and a light nip to the ear wakes him up. He sits up and rubs at his eyes, stretching his arms over his head.
Tears run down his face as he hears the pleas and cries of the other boy echo around the room, mixing horribly with the eggs noise.
He stays awake for hours after midnight, not actually knowing when the mark will appear and not wanting to miss it. He finally falls asleep around 5 in the morning.
“Well,” Dumbledore begins, a twinkle in his eye, “I suppose it’s time for points, no?”
Also linking my Tumblr reminded me...... do most authors not know how to embed things? I've read a lot of fics lately with random links that I'd have to copy and paste. Would it be helpful if I linked the work that taught me how? Any fellow authors lmk
Moody lets out another laugh, and both boys jerk to attention as he starts mumbling. “Of course… I was too focussed on the task. I forgot to make more! Ah… Well, this is the best time for it at least. Yes. Now….”
Also, of course,
“Common misconception. The hand on the shoulder helps the girl keep her posture and allows for easy guiding through the steps with only minor shifts in your own movement.” Potter nods and he continues. “Now, the basic step. In a waltz you always count 1-2-3, 1-2-3. You should lower on the odd counts and rise on your toes on the evens. For the basic step you will step forward with your left foot 1, side with your right 2, and close your feet on 3. Then you will step back with your right 1, side with left 2, and close 3. Then repeat. Got it?” Potter nods again so he goes on.
Voldemort points his wand again, and Harry feels a gasp in his mind right before the curse hits.
He knows not to push it though, and just turns around to look for a small piece of parchment - which suddenly appears on a table next to the record player. He shakes his head, a little bit baffled, but picks it up anyway before returning to Potter.
for something.
It’s unclear to either boy just how long they dance together, maybe minutes, maybe hours… the only thing that’s certain by the time they leave for bed is that it’s no longer “Potter and Malfoy,”
I know everyone is all worried about Draco around Voldy with the mark... so I promise I'll get to that. Also. Canonly we don't actually know when Voldy moves into the manor, but its likely them summer of 1996, and the summer before fifth year is 1995.
Fleur surges forward from the sidelines, tears spilling from her eyes as the four treasures splutter awake, clearly surprised to find themselves in such a position.
Draco had met him right after breakfast that day, so Cedric could meet him after dinner, and now they were just goofing off until lunch.
Words as clear as day, just in a language most would not know.
His breath comes more rapidly and his hands start to shake.
“I’m sorry! I kinda just assumed you knew where I disappear to after dinner ... but we don’t have time for this right now! He’s going to be here to get his hair done in like… an hour. I think? And actually not here, where we meet most of the time, but that's beside the point too! What do I do about his robes??”
Then the village comes into view through the murky water.
Lupins words from earlier that year floated through Harry’s mind over and over as he watched the clock tick down to his birthday. Lupin had explained that the only time the marks are ever mentioned in wizard society is in one class, on one day, where the fateful moment comes and someone's soulmark burns to life during class. Other than that it was never mentioned again, except - maybe - between a pair when they touch.
The only response is an indistinguishable grumble, but the rest of the day passes smoothly, both boys happy to constantly feel the flow of emotion between them.
“So, if I showed up to the ball with, say, Cedric… that would make a splash. No? And he would fit my mark - its a broomstick after all.”
Ron shrugs, “I mean. They don’t encourage it, but they don’t really stop it much. Especially now where there are ways to get heirs with same sex partners.”
you recently faced off a dragon!”
He thinks.
, he thinks,
“Draco?”
heres the thing i wrote that note before I did my final edit and my opinion has changed. my writing is all trash. why. ugh. im blaming my fever
He breaks the surface of the water and gasps a breath before joining Draco underneath and finally stopping to properly listen.
When he can finally catch his breath he stands and looks to the mirror.
which he thought was a terrible name as sirens were a completely different creature, and present them with the golden shell they’d owl ordered a short while ago. After which, hopefully, she would give him a kiss on the cheek allowing them to communicate - and supposedly also allow him to breathe freely underwater. From there, so long as they liked him, he could easily get his item returned to him and return to the surface. Safe and sound.

“How in the name of Merlin did I match with this

An hour later the two boys are
He looks back down at his book and projects a thought, though he has no way of knowing if Harry will hear.
Harry - who had slammed his hands over his own ears - nods in agreement.
On a normal day, they would pause and study it, see what had changed, but this wasn’t a normal day.
He feels a sigh in response and suppresses his smile. ‘
“Draco?!” Pansy repeats, worry clear in her voice. “What's happening? Who doesn't believe you? About what?”
“Ah Ron, that's the thing, you’re a catch. I’m sure you’ll find someone! besides, just look how many people have put their names down to stay the holiday! There’s no way they
“What am I supposed to do Pans? Just go up to him and be like ‘Sorry to bother you chosen one, but looks like we’re that weird once every couple hundred years type of soulmate so now you have to spend time with me so we can learn to control it before one of us implodes?’”
The Siren smiles at him once more and then he is led from the room and to another part of the village and he finds himself swimming easier than ever before.
Personally, I feel like this doesn't read great. But what can you do?
“I did… that’s who said no. It is a guy though so asking another guy would be more accurate.”
“Harry Potter! Stop for
“Yep. Definitely.” He says - despite the fact that he could really use her help now that the deadline
Both boys beg the room to help as they keep their hands clamped tight over their ears and shout possible ideas to get the egg back without 1. Hurting themselves in the pool or 2. Accidentally doing something to ruin their chances of getting the clue.
Thank you all for your kind comments last chapter. It really means a lot. I hope you're all doing well.
“Well Voldy, you’re gonna have to do better than that!” He screams, “
seemed to be approaching.
The argument quickly grows and as soon as Malfoy lets the word “Mudblood” fall from his mouth, Harry reaches out to grab his wrist.
Then comes the waiting game.
And the like, each thought earning a small laugh from Draco, which definitely doesn’t make him smile. 100%
He swims quickly as he can but it still takes him ages to get to the center of the lake, by Draco’s count nearly 20 minutes. All of which were randomly interspersed with the thoughts of,
“Maybe… but… Cedric, would you go to the ball with me?”
Cedric offers his arm again and together they stride confidently onto the dance floor and moments later is leading him through a stunning Viennese waltz.
” He cries out, “
She lifts the hem of her shirt to reveal a simple black snake in a rolling tunnel of blue water plastered on her hip.
He takes a deep breath and starts singing. His voice is rough at first, but as he gets further into the song it slowly starts to sound a little better - softer and more used.
Where it immediately starts screaming.
He projects.
All too soon they’re nearing the last corner before the Great Hall and McGonagal is hurrying up to them.
(See the end of the chapter for
A soft smile spreads across his lips as a feeling of calm settles over his mind, and he feels like he can breathe for the first time in days.
He’s woken up by Hedwig only a few short hours later when she brings him letters and cake from his friends. He smiles at their thoughtfulness and goes about his day, waiting for the telltale burn.
, in fact, in use.
I'm going to aim for 2 updates a month... we might drop to one depending on one my workload and stress level!
Draco rips his hand from Harry’s and jumps to his feet, pointing his wand as Moody points his, and then he screams at the top of his lungs.

Minutes later he’s shivering on the dock in his swim trunks, shell in one pocket and Gillyweed in the other and he

off task, dancing separately to pop music rather than waltzing together.
Moody drags them to his office instead, pushing Harry down in a chair. Draco almost gets locked out of the room, but Harry managed to grab his hand at the last second.
“Draco?” He asks in a raspy voice.
Harry is going to be ok.
Harry knows its likely because their emotions aren’t lining up, or Malfoy isn’t listening for him or a million other things (the bonds really hard to control). It's still annoying though!
“We love you too darling… now go!”
by the time Draco manages to actually catch up with the other boy he has somehow already cornered a very frightened looking Longbottom. Draco stops before fully rounding the corner, shaking his head.
This chapter was... pretty heavy to write.
They rise early the next morning and Harry spends the entire day in awestruck wonder. A ratty old boot that can transport them over huge distances in seconds? Cool. An enormous gathering of wizards - a large portion not children - and magical items? Amazing. And then the actual match was so amazing Harry is surprised he falls asleep afterward at all, but when he’s urgently roused by Mr. Weasley he doesn’t have time to ponder any of this. He is quickly herded out of the tent with the rest of the Weasley siblings and they all hurry through the crowd of frightened wizards. He looks in horror at the blatant torture of the muggle family and takes Hermione's hand in his own, each of them silently providing comfort to the other as screams echo in their ears.
the other boy wishes to talk about. “So. The clue. What do you think it means?”
When Dumbledore reads out the name on the fourth slip of paper Draco feels first intense surprise and then an all-consuming fear. His heartbeat speeds up and he feels as if he might pass out ... but that wouldn't make sense. Why would he be scared for
“And you didn’t tell me???? Draco!”
The task that was the very next day.

His feet connect with the bottom of the basin and he pushes towards the surface, and that’s when things get complicated.
“You really think so?”
He thinks to himself.
Either way its a blast and by the end Harry finds himself giggling and beyond dizzy.
“Dear
The vision of a nod, ‘
away and insists she checks on Draco first. The blonde protests too, but eventually they’re both checked over and lying in bed.
He and Cedric dance for hours, stopping once or twice for a glass of punch or a bit of something to eat. by 11 they collapse, completely exhausted, into two chairs next to Ron, still bubbling with laughter. Ron, however, seems grumpy as can be.
5 more minutes later finds him in a throne room of sorts in front of the most snake-like mermaid he’s seen so far.
He sighs and walks a few more feet into the room, right up to the edge of a gigantic... bathtub.
The next morning things are relatively back to normal, what with Hermione’s bushy hair, Harry’s unruly curls, Ron and Hermione were dancing awkwardly around each other and their feelings.
The first thing he’s does once he stops convulsing and screaming is reach out.
The grin Potter gives him is devilish. “
“Sure Harry, why not.” He says with a smile.
hey look
It’s two days later - Saturday - when Draco finally decides to do something about this dilemma. He was wandering the halls alone, looking for an empty room with a lock where he could teach Potter to dance.
he thinks as he stares at the black inkblot.
He finally stops on a random corridor on the 7th floor and starts pacing back and forth. Well, technically he paces the hallway three times and stops, startled by the appearance of a door in the previously empty wall.
happened to you?”
Especially Draco.
Harry looks back at the egg then and sees a small layer of water filling the bottom of the pool.
Who to ask for help.
Within moments a beautiful woman has dropped from the wand. “Harry, Darling!” She cries, “Look how you’ve grown!”
Cedric in second with 58 points.
Where could they be?
He slides to the floor, unable to support his weight, and stares straight ahead unseeingly.
Remember to keep on smiling, at least once every day. No matter how bad things are there is always something good, and for me right now it's you guys! I send all my love to each and every one of you! <3
“Harry! Hermione! Are you coming?”
Harry nods softly and the hallway is silent until he calms down enough to talk. “Ok. I was wondering… I know this is technically against the rules but I promise I won’t tell anyone… except for Hermione and Ron of course… but have you happened to stumble upon any plants that allow someone to breathe underwater in your reading? If so do you happen to know where I can get some?”
I hope you guys enjoy this story and look forward to more!
Now fully sobbing as well.
he has scars. It would be hard not to know.
He doesn’t know how long he sits there, waiting for the pain to subside, but it's long enough.
“Merlin no.”
The laughter that had previously filled the graveyard died out, shocked silence replacing it.
“Who is it?” He asks
Draco snorts, “
He stays under and listens to the song again - his lungs burning in his chest by the end - and then breaks the surface to come face to face with Draco.
Harry is about to reply when he finally comes into view of the treasures and his breakfast threatens to come up again.
It's a pandemic and my mom is literally throwing me to the streets but OH WELL
Hope you're all doing well!
He scampers off, earning himself a glare from Ron, but is soon walking beside Cedric.
Fleur grabs Harry as soon as he steps on the dock, “You saved ‘er!” She said breathlessly, “You saved ‘er even though she was not your ‘ostage!”
“Ok.” He says, holding up the parchment, “I am going to put this between our hips. Your goal is to keep it there while we dance. This time we are going to turn the basic step. The footwork is the same, but this time our bodies turn.”
” He could honestly

Harry, and people like Harry, have scars on their minds. Sensitive, aching scars that act as landmines, waiting for the pain that has defined years of their lives.
He calls out when he doesn’t get a reply and finally receives a groggy ‘
He doesn’t know what to do.
six: someone, please help I'm dying
He doesn’t know whats happening, but Merlin knows he’s not gonna let the boy die.
Just in time too… the song had just restarted.
Or as stunning as a Viennese waltz can be when one half of the partnership only learned how to waltz 13 days earlier….
Well, no one has to say anything about it.
The brown paper rips off easily and the box opens to reveal a dark green jar labeled “Gillyweed.” Harry smiles so big it nearly splits his face… at least until he opens the jar.
“Can’t sing above the ground… obviously some sort of magical creature. Humanoid I would… assume.”
After dinner as everyone heads back into the house Hermione grabs him by the wrist and hastily whispers to him.
Within seconds the basin is filled and the only evidence the egg is still screaming comes from large bubbles rising to the surface where the boys know the egg to be.
He just hadn't expected to run into the original written story of soulmates - Syra and Epita. Of course, he ended up reading it in a simplistic form meant for first years and younger, but the gist of the story is this:
most awful sound I have
The thrashing stops and for a moment Draco thinks it may be over, but then it’s suddenly back tenfold. Words now accompany the screams.
“Hm? Yeah. I’m fine. but uh… I gotta go. I have a bit of… homework. I’m gonna go grab it and… go to the library.” He stands up before his friends can respond, running to his dorm to grab his cloak and the egg then zipping past them again on his way to meet Draco… more than 20 minutes early.
” he starts, voice cracking and reaching out with his mind. “
“McGonagall said hand on the waist….”
He feels a burst of happiness from the other boy and then his mind goes silent. They’d lost control of the bond. Again. He sighs and leans against the wall, hoping Potter turns up soon.
“I already asked… they said no.”
he would reward me. Killing Harry Potter, the boy who lived,
He shakes his head vehemently, not hearing anything after “talk to Potter.”
“Nah… Fleur wouldn’t be surprising enough. And Skeeter would never fall for her being my soulmate, as I only just met her and Skeeter has seen my mark.”
Draco rolls his eyes again,
He’s about to reply when they hear voices around the corner and Draco quickly pulls Potter through the door to the room he found.
He sighs then throws his imaginary pebbles towards the other boy's mind.
“Oh… I didn’t tell you?” She simply raises an eyebrow at him, “Yeah… we… actually kinda hang out almost every night… and… study the bond…”
“Of course, I desire to alter mine as well. I ended up with rather plain ones, surprisingly. I had other things on my mind.” He looks pointedly at his arm. “What about that mop you call hair? How are you planning to tame that?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Much love,
“Well, you know Skeeter is freaking out about the tournament and my soulmate, and insisting that it’s a girl, so I figured I should ride this fame for as long as I can. Would you like to join?”
Draco is laying on the floor in the middle of the dance room when Potter barges in, loud and obnoxious as always.
Harry waits five seconds, then slowly raises his head and nods.
Then the task begins. He shoves the Gillyweed into his mouth and leaps into the water, swimming downward with some difficulty until it takes effect. Then he reaches out to Draco with his mind.
but it's destroying him.
“I know people often think of it as taboo, but maybe I could help you think of someone if you show me? Or… you could just ask the person. I know they might not see it as something, most people don’t, but my family feels they’re at least somewhat accurate. My parents matched, so did yours actually! And Charlie is one of the rare ones without a match. His mark was colored right when he got it, and was just a picture of a dragon. Turned out to be an exact match to the first dragon he saw hatch. He was ecstatic. He’s ace… in case you didn’t know.”
“Neville! He’s amazing at herbology! He’ll probably know something!”
Pansy finds him there nearly half an hour later.
He hadn’t noticed how close the other boy had gotten.
He keeps his chin tucked, fear churning his stomach until he hears it.
As always, Draco snorts at his stunning vocabulary and careful word choice.
He yanks his wand out of the stream as hard as he can, and without looking back books it to the cup, diving on it and entering the familiar whirl of a portkey.
He plops himself down next to Neville and nods happily at his questioning glance before buttering some toast.
Viktor in third with 55 points.
“Ok! So! Spells are out, but I was think-“
Most of the time it doesn't...
As it turns out, Potter is actually much better at following than trying to figure out how to lead, and by the following Sunday, he actually looks very graceful as he waltzes around the room.
Mere moments after the school is excused from the feast, the contestants still behind the door, Draco shows up at the library, searching for a fairytale book of his own…
“Ah! Cedric!” He calls out, “I was just looking for you! I have a question!”
Back in the real world, one 14-year-old watches another fall apart before his eyes. He
Harry blushes and even deeper red and looks down at the shiny toes of his shoes, only admitting to himself how right Cedric is.
They then stand together and Cedric winks at him before kissing his knuckles in goodbye. Harry smiles when he hears the click of a camera from somewhere off to the side, that's bound to make the paper.
please
Throughout the song, Harry had slowly stopped screaming. Slowly stopped thrashing. And now he slowly opens his eyes.
It takes all his concentration to keep the contents of his stomach where they belong while he looks at the squirming, slimy mass within. He slams the lid back on and scrunches his nose, putting it off to the side to pull out the square of parchment still in the box.
It doesn’t come until seven o’clock but it causes him to hiss in pain and yank up his left sleeve. He then watches an unidentifiable shape brand itself to his forearm.
One he hopes with everything in him that no one, especially his friends, ever have to fully connect with.
He lays the other boy on the ground a crawls towards the egg and slams it shut, then crawls back to Harry, softly whispering comforting words.
A gust of air leaves his lungs and the chest of the figure in the mirror follows suit. And when Harry takes his glasses off the figure does the same, when he turns on the sink and lets warm water flow over his hands the figure does the same. He doesn’t know if the figure follows when he closes his eyes and cups warm water to his face, letting it drip down and clear the last evidence of tears from his face.
Harry grumbles.
The break the surface of the lake right on the hour and the crowd absolutely roars.
The dark-haired boy just opens his arms in silent invitation and Draco just sighs, crawling into bed and pulling him close again.
A drop of water suddenly lands on his shoulder as Draco tucks himself into Harry’s neck. ‘
He just gets a glare in return, so he rolls his eyes and turns back to Cedric.
No more spellbooks. They’d already tried learning the bubblehead charm and it had
Harry chuckles, “Yeah, well, that’s apparently not enough for this one.”
The Siren speaks in parseltongue. “
Aria stared back at him, her eyes wide and her features frozen in a pained smile because for the life of her, she never thought she could feel this many emotions all at once.
From where he was sitting between Seamus Finnigan and Anthony Goldstein at the Gryffindor table, Ron was too busy wolfing down his food to notice the exchange between Aria and Hermione but eventually, he looked up and saw Aria smirking at him. He set his goblet down and gave her a mock glare back, sticking his tongue out at her.
on a regular basis? This is utterly ridiculous!" He spat out.
Aria gave him an apologetic smile but she didn't flinch when he glared at her again and rolled his eyes before looking away.
"Um...why exactly...?"
His jaw clenched and the next thing he knew, he was already towering over the black-haired girl's form, gray eyes hard and steely as they leveled Potter with an icy, infuriated glare.
She flopped down into her usual spot on the Slytherin table and wordlessly began scooping some food onto her plate. The rest of her housemates did the same and soon, more students from the other houses began piling into the Great Hall.
, Malfoy?" She turned around slowly, her eyelashes fluttering as she lifted her gaze and smiled at the tall, sputtering blond standing behind her. "Did you really think I would fall for that?"
Burt scoffed and deliberately flexed his arms, showing off his huge biceps.
Draco immediately cut her off.
Draco's eyes widened and he suddenly stopped dead in his tracks and yanked his arm free, causing Aria to turn to him in surprise.
to go to the Yule Ball with you." She told him.
Pansy's footsteps were curt and agitated as she stomped into the room, her high heels clacking loudly against the dungeon floors. From the rushed, heavier footsteps that immediately followed, Aria guessed that Neville was probably trailing close behind her.
"To answer your earlier question, apparently our instructor on vampires this week is a famous quidditch star. And he's hot, or so all the girls say." Neville said wryly, shaking his head as he and Draco both looked up and watched as Susan Bones and Padma Patil suddenly joined the throng of girls and began whispering excitedly to each other in hushed voices.
at himself, as though he genuinely did not expect the witty retort that had come out of his own mouth.
Neville took one look at him before his lips twitched upwards into a smirk.
"If you say so, Potter."
Headmistress McGonagall allowed the Daily Prophet, Witch Weekly, as well as a slew of other reporters and journalists to visit the school this weekend to cover the quidditch match and the Yule Ball; and,
"I'm sure it'll all work out somehow." Aria told him, giving the redhead a comforting smile. "I mean, just last year, we were trying to figure out how to destroy horcruxes, for crying out loud. I'm pretty sure we can handle whatever else life has to throw at us."
When Blaise still looked put out and didn't look inclined to answer, Draco sighed and pointed her towards the corner of the room.
"What about those times when I see those Bulgarian veela mascots get angry? They suddenly get those sharp bird beaks and wrinkly faces? They looked pretty hideous." Entwhistle commented rudely, causing Su Li, the female Ravenclaw sitting beside him, to glare at him from the corner of her eye.
at her tone of voice. She knew Hermione well enough to realize that the Ravenclaw was slowly beginning to lose her patience.
"—but they will never be as fulfilling for her as being with you would. She's a
"Congratulations, by the way." Luna added in a dreamy voice.
Blaise and the rest of the team (save for Aria) gave him a loud, gleeful cheer in acknowledgment before they broke apart and Draco flew back over to the other end of the pitch.
Hermione's voice was firm as she reached both hands out and placed them gently on Aria's shoulders in an attempt to make her calm down. "Try to relax, okay? We don't know if Malfoy noticed anything or not. For now, let's focus on getting that wing looked at by Madam Pomfrey."
Technically, the story officially ends here; but I will be including one last chapter for the Epilogue just as a thank you for everyone who kept up with me until the end. Thank you all so much, I never would have been able to complete this without your constant support and encouragement!
"No." Aria deadpanned.
to say that all Slytherins are bad or anything—"
" Corey finished, blinking up at Aria again and giving her an impatient look. "What's the point in learning all of those subjects anyway? Who needs DADA or Potions or Transfiguration or even
"This one is true, I'm afraid." She admitted, sighing as she leaned one elbow on the desk and rested her delicate chin on her palm. "Once mated, a veela cannot harm her mate – even if her mate forced the bond, cheats on her, hurts her, or even dies, a veela cannot choose another mate for the rest of her life. This is why there has always been so many incidences of veela abuse nowadays, and why so many of us would rather stay in hiding rather than properly register our status with the Ministry of Magic."
want to invite you. I was just doing what my father wanted me to do." She muttered under her breath.
Without waiting for her to recover from her orgasm, he spread her legs open and yanked her roughly toward him. When Aria blinked blearily up at him, he lifted her trembling legs and draped them over his shoulders, using the position to fold her body beneath him. Then, smirking at the way Aria was obviously still trying to catch her breath, he leaned down to whisper into her ear.
Draco finally let out the shaky breath he had been holding in and allowed his shoulders to sag under the weight of so many different emotions — relief, doubt, fear and so much overwhelming happiness that he was certain that his chest was going to explode. He closed his eyes and wrapped his arms around her waist to pull her closer, pressing her form snugly against his. He ignored the curious stares they were receiving from the many Londoners passing by and leaned in closer, pausing only when his lips were inches away from hers.
"You melodramatic prick." Aria grinned and shook her head at the petulant scowl on his face. Reaching over the side of the bed, she grabbed his discarded shirt and yanked it carelessly over her head.
"Really? What are you, a caveman?"
"Y—you…stupid…
"Are you insane?! Hermione, what exactly are you going to tell them—"
"T—too good...fuck oh fuck...Please...ahhh...harder!"
For courtesy's sake, he and Aria had agreed to stick with their dates for the Yule Ball, at least until the event itself was over.
Granger's eyes widened and she looked alarmed as she gave Fleur a strange look.
anything. That was just a guy thing—"
The more he thought about his awkward veela situation with Potter, the more Draco was beginning to accept that he was, apparently, much more interested in her than he originally thought. In fact (and
"How is it even
He tried to ignore the warmth that began to spread into his cheeks as Aria eventually looked away and sat down somewhere in the middle of the classroom between Weasley and Granger. Oddly enough, the sight of her suddenly sitting so far away from him caused an unfamiliar stirring somewhere in the pit of his stomach.
you make her associate with liars and murderers and Death Eater scum like you?!" Bentley was shouting at him again, completely oblivious to way Aria was massaging her temples in angry exasperation behind him.
They sat together in one of the empty compartments near the back and spent the rest of the trip in comfortable silence.
Draco squinted in the darkness; and he paled in realization when he recognized the three white feathers Fisher was holding in his hand.

"The sorting hat did tell me in first year that I was brave and reckless." Greg mumbled, his shoulders slumping in defeat. "But I had no idea that it meant I was qualified to be a Gryffindor."
"It's not an interrogation." Aria answered uncertainly, her shoulders slumping in defeat.
"You're being a childish prick." Aria said calmly.
classes where we're all together this year." She admitted with an embarrassed smile.
For some reason, Blaise seemed to find this really amusing.
Bentley growled, his eyes flashing red with anger.
"Will you dance with me?" Aria asked softly.
Malfoy then?" Bentley asked again, his eyes growing dangerously wide as he reached out and grabbed Aria firmly by the hand to prevent her from walking away.
a selfish prick."
Blaise made a face at her. "And thank
Meanwhile, Pansy continued to keep mostly to herself, and it wasn't until she had finished unpacking her belongings and was sliding under the covers in her pajamas that she addressed them all again.
"Oh Merlin, Aria! I'm sorry – I didn't mean—"
"Kiss me." She whispered harshly.
Aria was still blushing from her little slip earlier so she avoided Blaise's perceptive eyes the whole time as she joined the throng of green and silver figures huddled in a circle around Draco. After calling out some of their team members for their good performance, followed by him discussing a few key criticisms regarding some missed shots and how to improve their overall technique as a group, Draco finally nodded and dismissed the team for the rest of the afternoon.
sometimes my writing makes sense...
“Soulmarks are, simply put, a genetic trait of all witches and wizards. Unfortunately, no one ever really… talks about them. They appear on one's 14th birthday, a simple unmoving black shape that stings and glows the first time you make physical contact with your soulmate after the mark appears, and from that moment on are colorful and have small movements. Each pairs marking is unique, somehow representing a prominent moment in their relationship. However, just like all magic, soulmarks are unreliable. They make mistakes, they don’t
His boney knees stab into his chest as he shudders with silent sobs, a few tears leaking their way down his cheeks.
He sings the simple melody again, then tucks his chin to his chest and pulls the shell from his pocket - releasing it into the water in front of him as he starts the melody again. This time the other mermaids but the newest one join his song and the shell starts to spin.
Warning: I am going to start getting more in-depth with Harry's feelings and the results of the abuse of the Dursleys. I know this can be very triggering for some people so please be careful! I know experiences for these people aren't universal, jut also know what I am portraying is very real (you know, minus the magic) for some people.
Moody goes flying backward and collides with the wall before crumbling to the ground unconscious.
An eye roll comes through the link and Harry smiles again.
Cedric smiles, “Sorry to worry you professor, but we’re here now, and so are our dates. After all, we’re each other's dates.”
Harry feels the joy seeping from the other boy into his mind along with the words and he probably gets an extremely dopey grin on his face, but he can’t find it in himself to care much. He sends an affirmative answer and turns his focus back to his group of friends sitting around him - only to find them all staring at him questioningly.
“Harry….” The other boy starts, voice soft.
come say hi
I'm a sucker for soulmark fics... and Drarry are my favorite ones (:
He shakes his head, takes a deep breath, and rounds the last corner hoping to catch Harry’s eye as he sits back down.
It takes all his strength to keep his arms in place around the thrashing boy, and he knows he won’t make it to the surface without help.
So… what?
“Right. Of course. I’ll see you tomorrow.”
Harry smiles and then looks out to the room… and immediately turns bright red. “
“Hey, Harry,” Hermione says suddenly. “You
I may or may not have had a crisis about my writing skills during this chapter and nearly deleted the entire story. Whoops.
“Its Potter, Isn’t it?” She asks, nodding towards the book.
Harry mentally sends a glare his way before scurrying to the judges' table where the champions are being gathered.
Draco can't help the snarl that comes to his lips.
He floats in place for nearly 10 more minutes before a group of mermaids appears through the murk, their strangely snake-like voices odd to his ears.
Catch me making subtle references. Can anyone tell what they are and where they're from?
He cast a quick Sonorus on himself and quiets the audience.
“They’re not dating…” Comes the mumbled reply.
The other boy is dressed in robes that complement his own quite nicely, with more prominent green tones and the silvery black underneath. They fit him like a glove too, perfectly accenting his body. His pale hair is slicked and styled, but not overly done with gel.
They hurry to the edge of the bath and sigh, its way down in there.
Three weeks go by and first a PlayStation gets thrown from the window, then Harry dreams of someone getting murdered, and finally, Arthur Weasley shows up to take him to the burrow - which leads to the best afternoon he’s had in a long time.
“Wait, wait, wait. Skeeter is truly going after your soulmate? I thought that was just for publicity!”
Harry returns the smile and nods his head. “
I am posting this just after 2 am and a fight with my mom where she tried to snap my laptop (that i saved up to buy on my own) in half, and when I forcefully took it back she told me I didn't deserve to live and said I can either leave right now or she would have my abusive father come pick me up in the morning.
Sorry all... school is stressful.
“Well!” He says, marching forward, “Imagine how
the cowardly traitorous son of one of his traitorous men!”
“I mean… If you had the right connections I’m sure you could get some by…. This is for the task, right? I was assuming but never asked, did I?”
He changes directions and slams his book down on the dark hair boys table, pulling a seat out and sitting next to him.
“I… Maybe? I think… Yeah! Gillyweed. We could ask Snape, I’m sure he has some… Yeah no we aren’t asking Snape.”
“That’s cool! And I’m actually glad you feel that way. I gotta ask though, whats ace?”
“You’ve got this Harry. Show him who’s boss.” He nods at his dad's words as he joins him at his other shoulder.
Harry mentally nods and focuses on the bead of light, pushing at it with all his and Draco’s combined might. It flies back across the golden ribbon in a matter of seconds, violently colliding with Voldemorts wand and sending him stumbling back several steps. Shadows begin to emerge and the two boys gasp in unison.
He thinks,
Tears roll down Harry’s cheeks freely as he finishes. How he still has tears left after everything so far tonight he isn't sure.
” Potter says, “
No words, no spell, just screams.
Instead, he sees the dark-haired boy staring helplessly at the library door. A quick glance shows the source of his latest bout of helpless thinking - a flash of bushy curls and ginger locks disappearing through the doorway.
this room. What kind of joke was this?
“Wait here.” One of the mermaids instructs, and he immediately stills.
How can they leave Harry at a time like this? And they call themselves his best friends? Aren’t Gryffindors supposed to be loyal?
Draco counts them through the basic step a few more times, but Potter keeps breaking the connection.
“Yeah… I was gonna ask… why do you have his robes? Last we spoke about him I was giving you crap for overcompensating how much you liked him by pretending you hate him.”
Tied to a large statue in the center of the village are Hermione, Ron, and two girls he doesn’t know - though he assumes the one with silvery hair is related to Fleur.
I feel like this chapter is a little trash... but what can you do...
Harry nods, “Er… yeah. The task. Do you know somewhere I could order it? Throw my name around a bit, get it by, at the latest, 9 tomorrow?”
That's when he’s hit with a sudden idea. They’ve never talked about it, so he isn’t sure how the other boy feels, but he knows the song the room played for them before their first argument rarely leaves his mind.
. You’re telling me you’re scared of a little dance?”
-Authenic
He holds out his arm to Harry with a smile, “I was beginning to think you ditched me, found a date as stunning as you are.”
“Well. That won’t do at all, meet me a couple of hours before the ball and I’ll do your hair before I get myself ready.” He then turns and stalks towards the door. “Well, I reckon it’s nearly lunch. See you tonight, Potter.”
It’s too late to change them now anyway, hopefully no one thinks much of the color.
He pulls the blonde boy impossibly closer and buries his wet face in the other boy's neck, breathing in his scent. He kinda smells like apples and Harry makes sure to file that information away for later.
Draco laughed and the two boys grinned at each other.
Moody licks his lips and grabs Harry’s arm, dragging his finger through the blood before licking it off. Both boys shiver in disgust.

The robes were
Harry looks terribly small in this moment and somehow gets even smaller as he curls into Draco and closes his eyes. Still trembling.
on the other end of that mark?”
Oh, and I know everyone wanted it to be Draco that he had to save... but I'm pretty sure the Headmasters chose who it was and at this point, Dumbledore does not know about the two of them.
Draco saw
"I'm fine." Neville waved her concern away, looking impatient.
"That is
When Aria remained silent at that, considering his words carefully, Blaise went on.
"Is this how it feels like to be
She shrugged at him and bent down, retrieving the book he had dropped and casually scanning through it until she stopped on a detailed section about how to recognize a veela in her true form by the size of her pupils. Draco would have snatched the book from her hands to read the section further but Morag flipped the page, leafing through the rest of the book's contents.
"How do you mean, Luna?" Seamus Finnigan smiled sheepishly when everyone around him groaned at his question.
"Don't take your mood swings out on me." Draco's eyes narrowed and he turned to glare irritably at the back of her head. "Just because you and Longbottom insist on continuing that childish little war of yours, it doesn't mean the rest of us are as immature as you are." He snapped.
A collective gasp echoed through the crowd, and the reporter who had spoken waited patiently for everyone's excited whispers to quiet down before she continued.
"I don't think the school board will let this go without a culprit though." Zach chimed in, shaking his head. "Especially since it's another Slytherin-related incident."
the party."
form of sexual experience?"
At this point, Pansy sat back down into her seat and looked just as confused with Fleur's question as the rest of the class, shrugging when Neville turned to look at her from Draco's other side. As Fleur waited for someone to answer, Draco took that opportunity to glance around the room, his eyes narrowing slightly when his gaze fell on the empty seat between Weasley and Granger.
"Before I treat this, is there something you want to tell me first, my dear? Something rather
"Is everything okay?" She asked worriedly.
Without meaning to, Draco automatically looked up at him with narrowed gray eyes.
Aria's head was beginning to hurt.
Aria sank down onto the table beside Draco and furiously shook her head. "This doesn't make any sense. Corey is…That kid cares about nothing else but quidditch—he couldn't have done something like this. I mean,
"Because I didn't like the person you were becoming!"
Somehow, Draco managed to separate his mouth from her delectable veela skin long enough to gently turn her back around to face him. Her eyelashes fluttered as she lifted her gaze to meet his, allowing him to look deep into the large green pupils in her eyes.
Pansy nodded slowly, meeting her startled gaze through lowered eyelashes.
"Haven't you been listening, Mother?" Draco glared impatiently at her and looked away. "She never wanted me as her mate. She only extended the mating call to me that night to save me. It was out of pity." He said bitterly.
Draco knew that the group fancied themselves as Aria's unofficial fan club at Hogwarts, so not surprisingly, they weren't very happy when they found out about Draco and Aria's relationship during the Yule Ball. Over the last couple of days, the group kept throwing stray jinxes at Draco whenever they got the chance.
"Alright fine, I'll be there."
"Oh for Heaven's sake, Granger!"
He sighed in defeat and looked up, allowing her to see the guilt and shame on his face.
He didn't wait for the younger Slytherin to respond before he grabbed him by the collar of his robes and began leading him back towards the main area of the library. After grabbing his bag and muttering a quick farewell to Greg and Astoria – though Draco doubted they heard him as the two were too busy giggling at another one of those weird inside joke of theirs that only
Isn't it your bloody vocation in life to save people all the damn time?! Maybe you can convince everyone that this isn't our fault – that
Draco frowned and moved towards her, but when he passed by Fisher's bleeding, half-conscious form on the ground, the vampire glared hatefully up at him. He wiped the blood from his lips and gave him another mocking smile before reaching into the pocket of his coat.
"Seriously?!" The suspicion in Corey's expression immediately faded into an ecstatic grin as he blinked at her, practically bouncing in his seat. "You'll help me with my flying? You're not just pulling my leg, are you? But what about Pansy?"
"Yes, the spell is also in ancient veelish. However, unlike the Feather Curse, you do not need a feather to make a veela reveal her true form. You simply need to speak the proper incantation
to spend as much time with you as we just did, I just wanted to let you know that…Well…Tonight wasn't actually as
After a few minutes, when it was over and she finally managed to open her eyes, she almost squirmed away again when she saw the absolutely carnal way Draco was staring down at her.
Wood walked over to stand in front of the blackboard. He took a piece of chalk and drew a rough sketch of the moon on the board; then he paused and added another, much lighter circle around it.
Hagrid ignored him and glanced at Aria from the corner of his eye, giving the smirking girl a wink. "Anyway, as I said, that list should tell you what you need to collect. Be on your guard though. These past few weeks, there's been some wild animal lately that's been killin' a lot of foxes and drainin' all their blood. I keep havin' to collect their corpses in the morning."
wedding and
To everyone's surprise, Fleur didn't bother hiding her amusement at the question as she immediately covered her mouth and giggled. Once she had gotten her laughter under control, she waved her hand and gave a slightly embarrassed Susan an apologetic smile.
He knew that was the last thing the girl needed to hear right now – the fact that
Blaise?"
who had actually spoken and that he had been holding his hand up in the air.
Hermione sighed at that but conceded with a nod. "Yes of course, that's possible."
She and Greg spent the rest of the evening enjoying each other's company after that, alternating their time between dancing and talking about what they planned to do after Hogwarts. Aria learned that Greg was hoping to work for Gringotts after graduation; and that he was a big, closet fan of Celestina Warbeck.

She grabbed him by his scarf, yanking him down and silencing the rest of his words by capturing his lips in an intimate kiss. When she pulled away, Draco blinked and continued to stare at her with a dazed look on his flushed face.
Before either Lewis or Hannah could say anything else to tease him further, Draco took advantage of their momentary distraction to levitate his tray and quickly set off to get started on his patient visits for that day.
Aria gritted her teeth in frustration.
Aria sank back down onto her desk and let her shoulders slump in relief.
"Oh that's nice, a wild animal is on the loose." Draco muttered sarcastically under his breath.
By now, every single Slytherin in the common room was staring intently at them, most of which were probably waiting for either one of the two formal rivals to start blasting the other with an unforgivable curse.
There was another long moment of silence that followed, and Aria frantically wracked her brain for something else to talk about so she could keep the conversation going. She eventually gave up and looked away, lowering her gaze to the floor.
birds." She answered. By then, Draco noticed that she was beginning to look irritated by his prodding as she was scratching impatiently at something behind her shoulder. "Anyway, I'd better get going—"
too." He teased.
"That
"We'll wait for you."
"Care to dance?" She asked cheerfully.
He glared at her, a little offended by her words, but Luna ignored him and went on.
In spite of herself, Aria couldn't help smiling at the adorable way Greg was fumbling over his words.
older than me, it's gross!" She made a face and shuddered.
off!" She snapped.
"Because there's obviously something he's trying to accomplish with all these elaborate schemes. Something he wants." Aria lifted her gaze again and met Pansy's anxious expression with a grim smile.
"You can call me Aria."
Aria snorted derisively and levitated a batch of newly cleaned metal bowls toward him, purposely dropping them in such a way that Blaise cursed and had to jerk away to prevent himself from getting smashed on the head.
shift.
With a sigh, he knelt down and began perusing the dusty books along the shelves again, starting from the very bottom partition. He was just in the middle of going through the books on the topmost shelf when the soft sound of someone clearing her throat drew his attention, causing him to pause and look up.
"I gather Pansy doesn't know that you're interested in joining the quidditch team?" Draco asked wryly.
"They were in the way." He said simply.
about this Dream Girl of yours, Malfoy? I mean, other than the fact that she's as gorgeous as you say she is? Is there honestly anything else you like about her?" Neville spoke up, looking up from his plate and giving Draco a pointed look.
going back to the four veela names I have written in English on the board. If you did your research properly, then I'm sure you can tell me something about them." Fleur mentioned as she crossed her arms over her chest and leaned the back of her hip against her desk.
"Oh she's hinted, believe me." He admitted.
He noticed that Seamus Finnigan, Anthony Goldstein, and most of the other male students around the room suddenly straightened in their seats and were now listening intently to McGonagall in piqued interest.
Aria's eyes narrowed and she whirled around to glare at Draco in stunned outrage. As the feather burned away in Draco's hand, Aria blinked a couple of times and stared back helplessly at him with a dazed look on her face. The circle of blue flames around her and Fisher vanished as Aria's wand fell limply from her fingers.
"Shut up!"
them cheat against the Gryffindors.
"By the way," Draco surprised himself when he spoke again, his hooded gaze dropping down to focus intently on his shoes. "About the other night in the common room, Potter—" He felt blood rushing into his cheeks when Aria visibly stiffened at his words and turned to look at him.
"But as your housemate and your friend, what I'd really like to say is—"
Hannah reddened at Aria's words but she managed a sheepish laugh and gave her a genuinely curious look.
"Oh, this is so wicked! I've always wanted to meet a veela!" She blurted out happily, ignoring Blaise and Draco's amused snorts as she reached out and began poking incessantly at Aria's shoulders. "So how do your wings retract? Can you fly? Your true form was so pretty, by the way! How does the veela allure work? Is that why you always keep your hair tied up?"
The entire Great Hall, led by the Gryffindors of course, had burst out laughing and watched with glee as the Slytherins glared at them and struggled to continue with the rest of their dinner that night, hiccups, bubbles and all. Thankfully, the effect had worn off in a few hours and by the time everyone was back to normal, Aria and Blaise had already planned out a counter attack.
They stared at each other in stunned silence, both Slytherins blushing slightly as they tried to make sense of what just happened.
" Pansy immediately blurted out, her face flushing with embarrassment.
For a while, the look on Fisher's face was almost gleeful as he drank greedily from her; but then, after a few seconds, his eyes widened in realization and he immediately jerked away from Aria as though he'd been burned.
"Yes he is." He frowned to himself, eyebrows fusing together in thought. "I should probably warn you. That bloody git is so ridiculously obsessed with you that it's downright
They continued to glare at each other for a few more seconds, both Slytherins unwilling to concede until, to Draco's disbelief, Potter's glare faltered and her lips began to tug upwards into a reluctant smile. It took Draco a few more moments before the absurdity of their situation finally caught up with him but when it did, the sneer on his face melted away into an exasperated grimace.
To Aria's surprise, the smile on Corey's face slowly faded and his shoulders slumped slightly. He sighed and turned away from her to stare out the window, resting his chin against the palm of his hand.
"But more importantly, what happens
"So we can just choose whichever bed we like?" Morag Macdougal, a lanky, brown-haired former Ravenclaw who Aria always used to see walking the halls with her nose buried in a book, asked as she reluctantly walked over to the bed beside Pansy's.
There was a violent, ripping sound, followed by Fisher's agonized scream as a long, diagonal gash suddenly appeared on his back. The spell ripped right through Fisher's coat, and Draco stood back, watching with a certain degree of satisfaction as the laceration began to bleed profusely, staining Fisher's inner shirt with a diagonal line of blood. As Fisher continued to gasp and whimper in pain, curling himself up to protect his head, Draco finally allowed Blaise to pull him away. He ignored the way Pansy was staring nervously at him and watched as Blaise knelt down, checking the extent of Fisher's injuries.
"Um…Okay, is this something only girls would understand? Because I'm really not following here."
She reached into the pocket of her robes, pulling out the small piece of parchment that Blaise handed her when she entered the Slytherin Common Room that morning. After confirming that she was supposed to meet Zach in front of Hagrid's Hut for their chores that afternoon, she made her way down the stone steps leading out to the school's grounds.
Draco fought the overwhelming urge to hex them
In her shock, Aria's eyes widened and she accidentally tipped her glass over, spilling the wine all over the front of her shirt. He leaned back against his seat and snickered, causing her to shoot him an indignant glare.
looked as though she was trying desperately not to burst out giggling.
"How do you know her, Zach?" Hannah asked him in a strangled voice, looking up and meeting Zach's gaze with glassy blue eyes.

"No, look." Blaise reached down and turned the fox over, pointing out the two pinprick wounds on the fox's neck. "It's not just dead. It's been drained of blood. And recently too since it's still pretty warm."

She closed her eyes and tried to suppress her true form and force her wings back inside her body but for some reason, she
"But seriously, can you believe how stupid Longbottom looked during History of Magic? It's like the git has never heard of using a bloody

How could he—should I go and bash that little ferret's skull in?!"

"Who are they?" Aria frowned.
"Pansy
. It was a way for me to reassure myself, and to give me enough courage to actually attempt a relationship with you."
"Like I enjoy listening in on your conversation anyway." Pansy scoffed back at them.
"So what's your story, Aria? I don't believe the great Harriah Potter is still single
Draco's eyes widened and a soft, startled chuckle escaped his lips.
"I swear, those silly little girls!" She grumbled under her breath as she slammed the doors shut and huffed, stomping over to them. "The nerve of them! Of all the absurd, ridiculous things to make up—"
"Of course." She recovered after a few seconds and shook the confused expression away, rewarding the other girl with a comforting smile. "You can call me Aria, by the way. It's nice to finally meet you, Hannah."
"Of course I know that, you bloody idiot." At his words, the irritated scowl on Aria's face dissolved into a genuine, albeit exasperated smile. "If you think for one minute that you going all sappy on me will get me to take it easy on you at quidditch tomorrow, you've got another thing coming, Weasley." She teased.
He saw Zacharias Smith frozen by the entrance, the former Hufflepuff looking as though he was unsure if he should risk his life by entering the room. Pansy and Blaise were both gaping at him, obviously not expecting Draco's little outburst while Hannah Abbott and Morag MacDougal had both stopped whatever it was they were doing and were now watching Draco and Potter with wide, curious eyes.

"Then there's your wand."

"How did you—"
as Draco is. Maybe even worse." She sighed, oblivious to the way Aria's lips twitched at her words.
"A dream wouldn't let you feel me this way, Draco. It wouldn't let you feel how much I want you." She leaned up and kissed him again, massaging their tongues together and sucking his bottom lip into her mouth.
He shook his head at himself, amused at the uncharacteristic sappiness of his thoughts.

She didn't voice her thoughts out but the tension on her face must have given her away because Bentley was smirking at her. He spoke again, drawing Aria's attention back to the triumphant look in his eyes.
He remembered all those times when Aria would purposely move away from him, the way she was always
"Don't presume to know anything about me, Parkinson. Because you don't. At all." Neville snapped back at her, surprising Aria with the vehemence she suddenly heard in his voice. "Unlike you and the rest of your pretentious little lot, I don't judge people behind their backs. I'm not a petty, sniveling coward."
Aria nodded and was about to take his offered hand when another roaring blast of thunder caused them both to jump in alarm. They whirled around, gaping at the sight of a tall, thick tree catching on fire before hurtling noisily down to the ground a few meters behind them.
"Hey."
"Pansy, I'm getting really tired of this." Blaise scoffed and gave her a pointed glare. "In case you haven't noticed, they're wearing the same uniform you are."
When a veela first manifests, her physical appearance and flaws are
"I—it's fine, it's just a scratch." Ron stammered, laughing nervously before he reached out and began trying to extract Aria from Draco's arms.
Draco's eyes narrowed slowly and he gritted his teeth. "Now listen, you sex-obsessed little—"
"Slept in on the first day of classes, did you?" He teased, snapping Aria out of her staring.
veelas, so this question is irrelevant. Of course, we all know that a mated veela can never harm her mate."
"A veela's name is protected by ancient magic." Granger answered, her voice ringing out clearly in the silent classroom. "If a veela herself does not tell you her name, you will never be able to remember it unless it is written out for you. The name will just slip out of your mind again and again no matter how much you try to keep yourself from forgetting it."
"Nice to know you're keeping up with your studies even when I'm not around, Ronald." Hermione told him scathingly, leveling her boyfriend with a warning glare.
"Oh yeah, that
it when you were more reserved and delicate with your affections—"
To his dismay, the girl was already stepping up onto the train entrance. When she heard him calling out to her, she stopped and turned around slowly, giving him another strange, knowing smile.
Aria unclasped her hands from around his back and moved them up and down his torso, murmuring appreciatively to herself when she felt the firm muscles along his stomach. She eventually stopped when her fingers grazed the long, sectumsempra scar that ran diagonally across his chest.
"So it's actually possible to force a bond?" She asked grimly.
"You'll manage somehow, Potter." Pansy ignored her protests and flashed her another smug smile before pointedly turning around and walking to the other end of the classroom to clean the rest of the windows.
During the days he stayed in his flat, Draco spent his mornings monitoring the newspapers for articles about Aria.
"—and lastly, Zacharias Smith."

Hannah immediately choked and spat the drink out in horror, causing the entire table to burst out into another round of laughter.
She turned to Aria with wide brown eyes, a genuinely remorseful expression on her face.

"It doesn't
Luckily, Draco didn't have to think of anything else to say because that was when Blaise suddenly sauntered over to them, grinning widely as he slung an arm around Draco's shoulders. Luna Lovegood trailed after him, her usual dreamy smile on her face as she stopped beside Astoria and watched as Draco tried to shove Blaise away.
clearly as she lay there, her entire body still shivering and convulsing with pleasure.
Aria blushed at his words.
"B—but then...How would that even work?! I can't just do that! I mean, what if he doesn't reciprocate? Or what if I do something wrong and he laughs in my face? Or what if I do something that turns him off and—"
." She met his contrite look with a genuine smile. "And it's 'Hermione', by the way."
He finally pulled away from her breasts, but not before nuzzling his face one last time against them and giving each nipple a cheeky kiss. She swatted lightly at his blond head, grumbling exasperatedly under her breath when he laughed and continued his descent. He licked a trail down her stomach until he reached her bellybutton, where he dipped his tongue a few times, causing her to giggle, before sliding down even lower to bite playfully at the skin of her inner thigh.
"As far as drunken pick up lines go, Zach, that was horrible." A fully sober Blaise suddenly chimed in, inadvertently distracting Zach's attention away from Aria as he met the former Hufflepuff's confused look with a mocking smirk. "Oh and you
"You're never going to lose me, because I'm not going anywhere."
"Now, let's see what we're dealing with here. If it's just a simple injury from quidditch, then it shouldn't take long to—wait a minute, I don't—
"Look, I know being a veela and having to deal with people expecting you to choose a mate all the time
And I really
Draco hesitated, frowning when he realized that he couldn't come up with an answer to Neville's question.
with you, darling?" Narcissa frowned in concern, reaching across the table and placing her hand on top of his. "You've been distracted and lost in your own head all morning. Is there a problem? Are you feeling ill?"
"No. No
Aria smiled at that, and she didn't protest when he sat down onto a nearby couch and pulled her down onto his lap, wrapping his arms around her and burying his face into her neck. He nibbled on the sensitive skin just below her ear.
When Aria didn't answer and continued to stare intently at him, studying the carefully guarded look on his face, Bentley chuckled and took another step away from her, a strange, knowing glint in his blue eyes.
"For your sake, you'd better not be teasing me right now."
So many secrets, insecurities, and misunderstandings that just came bubbling up to the surface. You see Aria (and Draco), this is why it's important to talk about these things. Not just make out and have sex lol.
Aria looked up again to find Draco watching her with a worried frown on his face. Before she could answer, he stood up, removing the expensive-looking black cloak from around his shoulders. He ignored her halfhearted protests and leaned down, draping the cloak snugly over her form.
" Draco's eye twitched again and, oblivious to the way Blaise and Zach were desperately trying to stifle their snickers beside him, his eyes narrowed and he practically descended upon Morag's petite form like a vulture about to attack its prey.
Theo rolled his eyes and took a sip from his wine. "Hannah, I already told you. I don't particularly care for wedding details, you just tell me when and where to show up and I promise I'll be there, tux and all."
that a vampire attacked her and tried to force her into mating."
"This is really delicious, Pansy." He told her, inadvertently causing the short-haired girl to redden in embarrassment before she scoffed at him and pointedly looked away.
You won't let me show up to the Yule Ball looking like an utter train-wreck, will you? Please, please, please, pleeeeaaaase?!" She whined.
"Of course,
"Get out, Draco."
"Aria thinks so too, doesn't she? I think that's all that should matter, really."
"You'd be surprised." Aria laughed, shaking her head. "Malfoy's changed a lot since the war. He's not the loud-mouthed, obnoxious git he used to be. Mostly, he's just quiet and keeps to himself now. To be honest, he's not

"I hate cats."

"You're in your true form."
"I'm surprised you let him treat you that way." Aria answered as she glanced at her. "I wouldn't have pegged you as the type of girl to just cower away from a jerk like him. Did you two really date? Or was he making that up?"
"Really, Potter?" Instead of answering right away, he scoffed and gave her a dubious look. "I thought you were just making fun of me back there."

The hateful looks he could deal with; and they didn't really bother him all that much anymore.
"Oh shut up." Ron rolled his eyes and glared at her. "And
Pushing past the doors, she entered the pub slowly, pausing by the entrance so she could scope out her surroundings. Since the pub's interior was relatively smaller than the Three Broomsticks, it wasn't hard to spot the 8th year Slytherins, all of whom were cramped together around a long, wooden table near the back.
Aria held up her drink again, winking at him before taking another long, satisfying sip.
Apparently, it was one of the many things Narcissa Malfoy had done right when raising her only son.
"I don't know." Aria sighed again as she removed her glasses and pressed the heels of her hands against her eyes in frustration. "To be honest, I'm just drawing at strings here. I have absolutely
Fortunately, most of the younger Slytherins were still in class so it was just the 8th years who were lounging around in front of the fireplace that afternoon.
She quickly tore her gaze away before Draco could notice the surprised look on her face and circled the quidditch pitch a few more times, her narrowed eyes on the lookout for the golden snitch.
"Hermione, she used to call you an 'insufferable know-it-all'. And remember how she was bigger than Ron in second year and she liked to shove us both around in the hallways like we were nothing but a sack of feathers?" Aria pointed out.
Corner's left eye twitched at her words but he continued, ignoring the way Pansy was desperately trying to wriggle out of his arms.
When only a handful of students seemed to nod back at her, she frowned and paused to gather her thoughts. Fortunately, Granger's hand shot up into the air again and Fleur gestured for her to speak.
He and Neville both glanced over to where Pansy, with a clipboard in her hand, was currently busy watching over the musicians as they began setting up their instruments on the small stage at the center of the reception area.
"So." Greg caught Draco's attention when he spoke again and gave him an expectant look. "What exactly is the plan this year, Draco?" He asked.
By the end of the day, as Draco was making his way out of the crowded elevator back into the Ministry's atrium, he stopped when he caught sight of the massive assembly of reporters sitting around the fountain in the very center of the hall. From the excited reactions of the other Ministry visitors who happened to pass by, it wasn't hard for Draco to guess who everyone was staring at.
"—you've been ordering beauty and age glamour potions made from veela hormones and regularly going to St. Mungo's for skin enhancements using veela blood for the past decade now."
He snatched the coat from her hands, shaking his head and meeting her surprised look with an apologetic grimace. "We shouldn't end things this way. It's
"Of course I do." Wood automatically answered, finally turning his attention to Draco and acknowledging him with a nod of his head. "You were the Seeker for Slytherin back when Marcus Flint was Captain, weren't you?"
long sip from his scotch to calm his nerves.
"Is that creepy bloke Fisher staring at me again?"
"Oh no, Dracula was actually quite real." Wood averred with a grimace and a slight shake of his head. "But only muggles like to refer to him as Count Dracula. We just call him by his real name — Vladislav III, and he was actually a Prince of Wallachia. Eventually, he became known as the Dracula that muggles know of today." He explained.
"But if you are talking about laws that protect against the abuse of the Feather Curse, then
Blaise, he was there in the common room with us when Slughorn and McGonagall came storming in. He looked just as confused as the rest of us about what happened—"
"Good enough?! Overrated?!
to get you expelled in a heartbeat, and she'd believe every single word. No questions asked."
"How about holy water and crosses? Is it true that vampires are terrified of them?" Susan Bones asked.
"So...Why don't you tell me how you really feel about me, Parkinson?" She asked.
"What is this, are we in third year? Is this a bloody
you, Blaise."
She had unusually sleek and incredibly long black hair. It fell over her shoulders and continued in a long, inky waterfall down her waist, past her ankles, until the silky strands hovered just a few inches above the floor by her feet. She was unnervingly attractive, with a perfectly sculpted nose, high cheekbones and a smooth, flawless complexion. The color of her skin was also noticeably very fair – almost glowing in an unnatural sort of way. She was tall – not as tall as he was but certainly taller than most girls in Draco's year. She was also very slender, her womanly curves visible even through the thick layer of ugly brown clothing she wore.
Aria hesitated again, but as she was trying to think of an answer, the doors to the Headmistress' office suddenly swung open. Glancing over her shoulder, she watched in surprise as Blaise and Pansy both hurried into the room and headed towards them.
Fleur's expression immediately soured at Hermione's words.
"I saw her just before I got on the train. She, Granger and Weasley were one of the first people here." Greg answered.
"Can I ask you a personal question?"

She couldn't help but remember the way Pansy had reacted after both Aria and Neville had all but accused her of hiding something when she and the other Slytherins had been discussing who the possible culprit behind the vandalism was. Given that the
Draco looked horrified as he glared poisonously across the table at a stone-faced Pansy, who sighed in exasperation and covered her face with her hands. The way Draco's hilariously shrill voice had cracked caused Blaise to clutch his sides as he laughed even harder.
"No." Ron shuddered.
sit next to you a few times in study hall a couple of years back, but you probably wouldn't have noticed." He breathed out.
Draco paused in the middle of his efforts at trying to entertain Teddy by making magical sculptures out of his food. He glanced to his left, watching as Aria grimaced in apology before quickly reaching into her robes and pulling out a small, rectangular device.
"Malfoy, a—are you sure?" She hesitated, her eyes flicking back and forth between Draco's annoyed expression and the sweater in his hand. "I don't mind just stepping outside to fix the damn skirt—"
"Do you know how one forces a bond with a veela?"
"What are you still doing here anyway?" Greg's voice was oddly laced with a hint of anger as he leveled Draco with a sharp glare. "Shouldn't you be on your way to pick up Astoria by now? It's incredibly rude of you to keep her waiting."
Honestly, in that outfit, she looked like she belonged on the cover of one of Blaise's racy magazines.
"She'll get over it, Longbottom. Trust me." Blaise told him, though his words didn't seem to have any effect on the frown that only seemed to deepen on Neville's face. "That's just how Pansy is."
"She'll be fine." Draco said nonchalantly, turning back to his food and impatiently waving their concerns away. "Besides, Pansy knows that Blaise and I don't do that whole 'comfort' rubbish. I think you're confusing us for Gryffindors or Hufflepuffs." He added in a mocking drawl.
Five points to Slytherin." Fleur beamed at her, clasping her hands together in delight. "But the more important question is, what is the significance of a veela's name? Why is a veela's name important to an
prefects who were out on patrol the same night the three common rooms were vandalized.
then, right? Because we're the good-for-nothing lot who chose to side with the Dark Lord?!" She shot back, the anger in her voice causing Neville to blink at her in disbelief.
"...What other thing?" Draco shifted his gaze from Andromeda back to Aria. "You'll have to fill me in on this one, Potter, I'm completely lost here."
By now, Morag was clenching her quill so hard that even from where he was standing, Draco could see the way her fist was trembling.
"S—sorry about this." Aria winced again and answered him with a grin that was both a half-smile, and a half-grimace. "I guess that means we lost the match then." She kidded weakly.
There was another 'whooshing' sound and, before Aria could realize what was happening, Draco was wrenched apart from her, only to reappear a few feet in front of her by the entrance doors. A lean figure stood behind him, and he had a pale arm wrapped tightly around Draco's neck while his other hand held his wand, keeping it pointed at Draco's throat.
"Potter?"
Potter's face had gone white at Draco's words and her green eyes were wide with shock as she gaped wordlessly at him.
, she had no current plans to re-establish the Black family name in High Society.
"Please don't cancel the Yule Ball because of what happened." Aria rushed out, leaning forward in her seat and placing her hands on the table. "I know a lot of people were looking forward to it, it would be a shame to cancel it now."
"Okay first, that's gross, who
"Oh sorry! Was that you?" Hannah let out an embarrassed giggle, followed by a hiccup before she hastily withdrew her foot and ended up accidentally kicking the table, nearly causing all of their drinks to spill.
out of my goddamn uniform, for Merlin's sake!" Aria snapped back angrily at her, shoving her hands away.
Skeeter gaped at her, clearly not expecting such a polite, amicable response.
"You don't
Narcissa instantly noticed his dejected expression and reached up, caressing his cheek in comfort.
"Draco."
Once he was done, he straightened his robes and set off, heading quickly towards the east wing of the castle. Since Aria couldn't attend their European Magical Anthropology class with him that afternoon, Draco had promised to attend so that he could lend her his notes (though she did have to negotiate a very interesting deal with him before he actually agreed).
Just a few things:
"I don't know." Aria answered quietly, watching as Blaise and Pansy rushed down from their dorms, both still looking a bit bedraggled as they shot each other identical looks of confusion. Wordlessly, they followed Slughorn and the rest of the prefects out of the common room.
Dorea's direct descendant after all so she probably got the veela gene from her—"

"Now get the hell out of my sight before I beat your ass myself!" He raged.
such thing."
"I do." Aria answered plainly, meeting his gaze. "Whether or not Gryffindor has a more experienced line-up of players than we do, I can honestly say, for certain, that Slytherin's dynamic as a team is much better."
"You don't have to do that. You already look gorgeous." He huffed, roaming his gaze hungrily up and down her form. "How exactly do you expect me to concentrate tonight?"
The entire Slytherin side of the stands had erupted into cheers and screams after that.
"Ladies first." He shot back.
She recognized one of them easily - the brown-haired, lanky one on the right was Bentley Fisher. Aria remembered him as the weird boy who had declared himself to be her fan and fawned all over her in the Great Hall the night before their first day of class.
"You were
Fleur's expression was grim as she tucked the feather away and folded her hands neatly behind her. "This is, ultimately, why unmated veelas are at such a disadvantage. Once a veela is mated, she can afford to be less guarded. Touching other males will no longer affect her, as the urge to find a mate is no longer there, and her veela allure is also significantly less intense. But more importantly, the Feather Curse will no longer work on her and she can no longer be compelled by other people,
no plan this year." Draco snapped at him, looking annoyed at his persistence.
plus the gloves,
Draco didn't protest at that and soon, all three of them were quietly making their way down the stands.
Afterwards, while the rest of their classmates continued laughing hysterically at them, Pansy cast one last poisonous glare at the two potion-drenched students grinning sheepishly at each other on the floor before she huffed, turned her nose up at them and stormed back over to her table.
She chuckled to herself and leaned back against her seat. "And all things considered, please don't misunderstand. I
"Pansy's knickers are in a twist because I asked if I could join Potter and Longbottom's study session for DADA. Apparently, I'm not supposed to be associating with them." Blaise answered sarcastically, rolling his eyes as the glaring, short-haired girl.
Aria's reaction was both violent and instantaneous.
Both Neville and Aria glanced cautiously around the Slytherin Common Room, oblivious to the throng of other Slytherins who were entering the common room behind them and heading up to their dormitories.
The dark-haired girl let out an angry, bird-like
"It's fine, Ron. We can tell you everything later." Hermione assured him.
"What are you doing all the way over there?" She brushed her long, sleep-tousled hair back from her face and patted the cold, empty space beside her. "Come back to bed. It's cold."
you are, actually. You think just because you were desperate enough to make the Chosen One your fixation, you're suddenly more deserving of her than anyone else?" Draco mocked loudly.
"Potter! How dare you?! I
"Alright, alright. I think we've all had enough.
hate each other?" Morag suddenly asked, surprising everyone with her bluntness as they all turned to look at the former Ravenclaw. For her part, Morag looked completely unaffected by all their stares, her attention focused solely on Draco and Aria. "Because I've read from a lot of books that the kind of childhood rivalry you two had is usually just a manifestation of unresolved sexual tension between two people who are secretly attracted to one another. Would you say that was true in your case?"
"They did - well, the
Draco ignored the irate expression on Bentley's face as he growled and reached out, deliberately extracting Aria's gloved hand from the other boy's death grip. When Bentley blustered at this and sputtered at him in outrage, the glint in Draco's eyes only hardened and he glared warningly at the other boy.
Somehow, Skeeter was able to spin the story in such a way that it looked like
"I am

"It's the mate bond." She whispered back, biting at his skin and causing him to hiss in pleasure. "I can feel you too."

"Is that an actual compliment about my
"Seriously?" Pansy turned and directed her affronted glare at Draco instead. "Weren't you the one who said we should avoid associating with Potter this year?!" She pointed out.
"I wasn't playing around!" Draco growled back at her, gritting his teeth in frustration. "I did those things because I

Draco Malfoy paused briefly by the entrance, gray eyes roaming the pub for before he reluctantly closed the doors and made his way to a dimly lit area at the back of the room.
"I'd rather not."
"Am I the only one here who completely disagrees about Potter being sexy?" Pansy complained loudly, making a face at Blaise.
"No, it's not." Blaise's eyes were wide as he flicked his gaze back and forth between Aria and Draco with a look of genuine amazement on his face. "You ordered her to kill Draco, and so she made him her mate. And everyone knows—
"Malfoy, you're welcome to continue hating me all you want. Nothing will change that." Potter answered stiffly, looking a little disgruntled by his comment.
Potter." Draco snapped again, scoffing at her before he turned his attention back to his task. "Frankly, I don't even know why you're asking me. You were there during my Ministry trial, you know I have to serve two years of community service after I graduate." He spat out.
and damn it all to hell, if this blasted veela wasn't the most physically desirable woman he had ever laid eyes on. In that moment, all his malfunctioning mind could really think about were her sensuous curves, those long, slender legs and oh just
Draco made a disgusted face and immediately washed the cake down by taking a long sip from the bottle of firewhiskey he held in his hand. "Bloody hell, that was way too sweet, Potter." He complained.
Draco hissed when one of Aria's severing spells managed to break through his defenses and sliced a deep gash on his arm. She immediately followed up with an upward slash of her wand, forcing Draco to retaliate by pointing his wand at her and casting a counter spell to deflect her magic. It proved to be a mistake, however, because the beams from their wands connected and Draco gasped as the force of her magic nearly knocked him over. He winced and gripped his wand with both hands, grunting with exertion as he struggled to push her magic away. Aria lashed out with a very powerful shockwave that shattered their connection instantly and sent Draco hurtling to the ground.
"That's easy for
"I'm here to pick up my date for the evening. Pansy set me up with someone." He answered.
"Mollie Davies. Seventh year." Zach answered as he bit into an apple and watched as Macmillan grinned playfully at whatever the girl was whispering into his ear.

after the vandalism took place, Aria. He could have easily snuck back into the common room before McGonagall and Slughorn arrived." Hermione pointed out.
Bentley." Aria pushed him away herself this time and pointedly moved back from him a few inches to prevent him from leaning into her again. "But as Ron said, I'd like to finish my dinner now so if you don't mind." She didn't bother trying to be polite this time as she gestured impatiently for him to leave, completely fed up with the fact that he had been fawning over her for the last ten minutes.
"I must go back to my herd now." He told them, glancing over his shoulder one last time to give Aria another deeply respectful nod. "It was an honor seeing you again, Harriah Potter. I look forward to hearing more of the many great feats you will undoubtedly accomplish in your lifetime."
"Draco?"
veela.
"I'm sure everything will be alright." She said in a soft, knowing voice.
Aria winced again at the loud sound of a heavy door slamming shut, followed by a tense, awkward silence. More than a little curious at this point, Aria peeked her head out slowly from behind the couch and glanced around the common room.
"Firewhiskey?" He offered.
"I hope so." Hermione averred, her eyebrows fusing together with worry. "It's a little intimidating, actually. I've never planned a wedding before, I don't even know where to start or what I'm supposed to do first. You'll help me with all of this, won't you?" She asked nervously.
offered to stay behind and keep her company at Hogwarts, but Aria had adamantly refused and had sent them away.
"Ow!"
Th following morning, during the Slytherins' shared History of Magic class with the Ravenclaws, Aria had just about fallen asleep in the middle of the lecture when Professor Binns had suddenly chosen that moment to
"Well, it's just so conventional and just so…
"Trust me." She reached across the table, placing her gloved hand over his again and giving his fingers another comforting squeeze. "For all you know, she could feel the exact same way about you and not realize it just yet."
, to such ridiculous extents, but this obsessive nature of vampires is actually also a side effect of our condition. Sometimes, if a vampire does not learn how to control his or her fixation, it can become so bad that he or she is consumed by it." He said grimly.
"Yeah, I think so too. Having Angie around seems to give him the energy to get up out of bed in the morning. He's been coming over to check on the shop more and more too. Reckon it'll only be a couple more months before he's ready to open it up again. At least, I hope it will." Ron said softly, a small smile on his face.
As Stubby Boardman's tenor voice began to fill the hall, singing lyrics that started off by describing a young girl with green eyes, black hair and a bolt-shaped scar, Aria felt her cheeks beginning to flood with warmth. Fortunately, save for the lights that focused on the couples on the dance floor, the entire Great Hall was dark; so Aria was able to hide herself from everyone's stares by sinking down into her seat.
Both Morag and Granger raised their hands and Wood looked amused as he glanced back and forth between the two of them. He eventually decided to call on Morag.
at it. I'm almost tempted to kick you off the team for insubordination."
"What do you want, Zabini?" Aria finally asked, rubbing her face with a weary, defeated sigh.
"You're not a lion at all, are you? You're just a little
" Aria told him, grimacing at the accusing look on his face. "But Blaise can be very
Pansy glared back at him with an affronted expression on her face.
"So then...Are you saying that you're not currently romantically involved with anyone?"
By some stroke of luck (or fate, as Aria knew Draco and the rest of her teammates would have preferred to believe), Slytherin actually made a complete turn-around during the latter half of the match.
Her voice broke, and she winced, clenching both of her hands into fists.
Hermione shifted her amused gaze over to Aria, quelling her tense expression with a teasing wink. She reached over and took Aria's free hand, giving her fingers a light squeeze. As she did this, Draco's eyes flicked down to the ring on her finger. He arched an eyebrow and glanced back and forth between Ron and Hermione in question.
Aria reddened and scowled to herself when she noticed that everyone around the table, including Neville, was trying to stifle his or her grins. Well,
as Pansy suddenly dropped her thick stack of textbooks loudly onto the table beside Aria, causing her to jerk in surprise. Gritting her teeth, Aria looked up and gave the short-haired girl an irritated glare.
Somehow, Aria managed to snap herself out of her lust-induced trance long enough for her to place her gloved hands firmly against his chest, using the position to shove him away.
Draco felt a surge of intense jealousy in his chest when the boy eventually stopped in front of Aria.
They reached the train station at the other end of the village in a short amount of time, and eventually, they stopped in front of the entrance, turning to face each other with a warm, friendly smile.
"Don't you dare
) brushed against her when he passed by.
The sight of his hunched shoulders, and the way he looked as though he was about to leave when Aria mentioned his name caused something in her chest to squeeze painfully. Suddenly, she realized how utterly ridiculous this whole thing was — what they were doing to each other — and she didn't care anymore if they both made mistakes or which one of them was wrong.
age, sweetie." Estelle giggled at his reaction and gave him a thoroughly amused look. "Twenty years ago, wizards
"Mmm..."
"Relax, Potter. Why are you so worried anyway? It's not that big of a deal—"
Thankfully, she had an entire week to herself in the hospital wing before she had to see him again.
"I have a pretty high alcohol tolerance." Aria looked amused as she flashed them both a smug smile before tipping her head back to finish the last of her drink. "Though I'll admit, my hand-eye coordination and balance does tend to suffer a bit when I'd had too much to drink but that's about it." She told them.
"No, no, no,
"Don't mind me. My mouth tends to run off without getting clearance from my brain." She looked up at them again and gave them all another sweet, innocent smile before hastily looking away.
Not surprisingly, a lot of the people Skeeter interviewed as 'sources' for her article (including the supposed healers she cited as references regarding Aria's psychological state) were all vampires.
"Are we required to eat at our new house table already?"
learn from the Prophet that Bentley Fisher was still locked up in the Ministry; and that the Aurors in charge of him were still waiting for Aria's statement before they decide on what formal charges will officially be filed against him. Draco also learned that the Department of Veela Affairs would be holding a public press conference to deliver Aria's statement sometime that week, though no specific details as to the time and place of the event was actually given.
Sometime in the middle of the conference, while Aria was talking to one of the reporters near the front, her veela senses
"Aria.
Grinning widely, Blaise looked as though he was about to answer her when another familiar voice behind them suddenly spoke, causing everyone around the table to glance up and stare in shock at the person approaching.
those good-for-nothing liars, those
"I take it that you're a breast guy, huh?" She teased.
Interestingly enough, the 'Chamber of Secrets' wasn't as dank or ominous as what he pictured in his head; though the gigantic, tacky statue of Salazar Slytherin's bearded face at the very end of the room did sort of freak him out. The place would have actually been too small to accommodate such a large number of guests; but the water surrounding the narrow pathway that led to Salazar Slytherin's head had been magically frozen so as to expand the floor area.
"I still don't understand
"It's not my fault! I swear, I never intended to hit Aria –
If there was one thing Slytherins were good at, it was self-preservation; so Aria knew it was highly unlikely for her housemates to do something they knew full well would be a detriment to themselves,
about what anyone else thinks or whether I deserve you or not—" He continued speaking in a low voice, using his free hand to yank the hideous glasses off her face so he could gaze directly into those beautiful green eyes. The fingers he had intertwined with hers tightened firmly and Aria gave out another gasp, shaking her head as she made a pitiful attempt to yank her hand away.
He ambushed Aria just as she was coming down from the girls' dorms and dragged her towards his favorite armchair (the same one they had fought over at the beginning of the year). Afterwards, he ignored her laughing protests and pulled her down onto his lap, greeting her with a smile followed by a ravenous kiss.
Draco stilled at her words and stared at her, unsure of how to respond. The cold, unwelcoming tone of her voice reminded him of how Aria used to speak to him back when they were still enemies; and he didn't like it one bit.
"Yes."
but ultimately, it is still
Luckily, Hannah didn't seem to notice or hear Aria's deadpan reaction and she went on, her words barely audible in between the harsh, hiccuping sobs that were wracking her petite frame.
"Yes, but you could afford to be a little less…
"I'll be there, Headmistress."
Oh and yes, I borrowed a line from the Crazy Rich Asians movie lol. And yes, I know Blaise's mother (according to HP Wiki at least) was hinted by JKR to have actually killed all of her previous husbands but I chose to ignore that for purposes of this story.
"Mmm...Well, aren't
She was wearing a strapless dress; and Draco suspected that Pansy was the one who did her make-up because her features looked sharper, giving her a more mature and sophisticated appearance. Instead of her usual pigtails, Hannah's blonde hair was curled and she left it all down to frame her face.
"No, wait!"
"You say the sweetest things, Malfoy." Aria drawled back in a sarcastic voice. "That mouth of yours is going to get you in trouble one of these days."
"There's Ron and Hermione. I'm going to go over there and talk to them for a bit, okay?"
"Don't worry about it, Malfoy."
"'Did you tell Headmistress McGonagall all this, Hermione?" Ron interjected from where he was watching their exchange, his eyes darting back and forth between the two girls.
"You know, I just realized...I never
While most of the students gasped and chattered loudly amongst themselves, Fleur took advantage of their distraction to finish securing her hair back up onto the top of her head. Afterwards, she turned to smile at the class again, chuckling when she saw that most of the males had finally snapped out of their entranced staring and were shooting each other embarrassed grins.
Andromeda nodded and reached for something inside her purse. "Hold on, I have it right here."
To her amusement, Blaise just grinned and smoothly decided to ignore her comment. "You don't even have to worry about anything, drinks
Madam Pomfrey was already waiting for him when he entered the room.
"Potter."
"That's because those idiots on the team can't recognize talent if it hit them between the eyes." Zach snapped at him, obviously annoyed by the insinuation in his comment. "Alright, so
We were actually rivals in school. In fact, I think she absolutely hated my guts." He looked up and gave her a wry, half-hearted smile.
She gave him a strange smile and held something out to him, causing Draco to shift his gaze down to the thick stack of papers she held in her hand. When he realized that what she was actually showing him was a copy of the Daily Prophet – with his and his mother's name, face and supposed war crimes plastered all over the front page – his expression immediately darkened and he scoffed before turning sharply away.
She sighed and covered her red face with her hands, inwardly deciding to wait the situation out a bit more.
confused.
"Go ahead, Mister Malfoy. You may visit Miss Potter if you wish. She's in the very last room in the corner." Madam Pomfrey told him.
"Are you planning to blackmail me, Zabini?!" She growled, baring a row of sharp teeth at him.
"Well, anyway, it was good seeing you again, Aria. Let me know if you're ever interested in joining professional quidditch, alright? I'd be more than happy to pull a few strings for you." He mused.
"No, I
Before Greg could notice the sudden change in Aria's expression, she forced out a laugh and hastily moved away.
friendly face down in the dungeons with me." He sighed.
" Neville muttered, his eyes growing dark with realization.
She closed her eyes and stepped away from him, her entire body going completely still as her skin began to emit a faint yellowish glow. Draco squinted, blinking a couple of times to see her better, but when the light finally faded away, he found himself staring at Aria as a fully transformed veela for the very first time.
Aria didn't notice him at first, too busy fiddling with her gloves as she stood by the doors, so Draco took that opportunity to just drink in the sight of her.
thank you very much." He drawled snippily.

. That
Normally, Draco would have said no – if only because he couldn't care less whether these two hexed each other's eyeballs out – but when he saw the panicked, slightly pleading expression Pansy was giving him, he rolled his eyes and reluctantly stood up, gathering his things.
He was pale and trembling as he pulled away from her and gently turned her around to face him. Aria watched as he swallowed nervously and lowered his gaze, staring very intently at their intertwined hands.
"What's up with that face, Potter?" Draco chuckled as he reached up and took her by the chin, gently turning her head so that she was staring back at him with her big, beautiful green eyes. "
If you slap me one more time, I'll tell the whole bloody school how much of a slut you really are!" He raged in an angry, threatening voice.
"Your loss,
Aria's lips tilted with misery as she lowered her eyes and looked away. Beside her, Ron looked just as equally distraught and he alternated his gaze back and forth between the two girls in concern.
dead."
Pansy fidgeted with her hands before she spoke.
"What the fuck is that supposed to mean?!" Aria seethed.
"That's not what I meant!" She screeched out, causing another round of snickers around the table.
Before Granger could react, the bomb exploded into a thick cloud of bright yellow smoke.
"Yes, they were." Blaise grinned, using his wand to tuck a set of newly dried dishes into one of the nearby cupboards. "They were assigned to clean and rearrange the restricted section of the library. Somehow, they ended up arguing and screaming at each other over how to interpret the Dewey Decimal System. Madam Pince sent them both away before they could even get through half their assignment."
He had just made it to the end of the hallway when Wood suddenly disengaged himself from the crowd of girls around him and turned to someone on his right, his face lighting up with friendly recognition.
your wings, Aria." He said gently.
Draco stiffened in alarm when Skeeter suddenly snatched her wand from her purse, shoving past the other reporters in front of her as she made her way to where Aria was seated. She didn't get far though, because as soon as she neared the elevated platform and raised her wand, Aria just arched an eyebrow at her and raised a hand up into the air. With a twirl of her index finger, Aria sat back and watched as Skeeter immediately stilled in her tracks and looked up, staring at her with a flabbergasted look on her face.
of the Gryffindor Chasers (Anthony Goldstein, Megan Jones, and Demelza Robbins) were pretty good –
Hearing the flatness of Ron's foreboding voice, both Aria and Neville looked up and followed his grim gaze to where a couple of Slytherins were huddled together behind most of the 8th years.
"Huh?" Draco's eyebrows fused together in annoyance. "You just said—"
Another reporter, a beady-eyed, stocky woman who sat near the back, spoke up.
"Why are you acting like such a
"Are you serious?! I can't use these!" Aria pointed out again, making a face. "Look, it even says 'Malfoy' on the back! And besides, not only would it be horribly inappropriate, they're also way too big for me!" She grumbled.
"I can't think of anything specific right now." He answered hastily, looking away so she wouldn't notice the sudden flush of pink on his cheeks. "But in general, I do like any form of dark green so long as it's tasteful and elegant to look at."
"Sorry. I got a little carried away." He chuckled, kissing the smile on her lips.

"Because you don't want a mate?" Draco interrupted quietly, looking at her again and meeting her eyes with a weary, defeated look. "Or maybe because you don't want
"I didn't realize she had so many enhancements."
Growling in frustration, Draco was just about to head out of the Great Hall to look for Aria himself when Luna suddenly stood up and walked quietly over to the window behind them. The expression on her face was deeply contemplative as she stared at the expansive view of the Forbidden Forest outside the castle.
Aria spoke again sometime later, glancing curiously at Draco from the corner of her eye.
"You go on ahead." Draco told him, shaking his head. "I'll meet you there. I just need to drop by the owlery first and send a letter to my mother. Otherwise she'll send me a howler." He rolled his eyes to himself at this, causing Blaise to chuckle and give him a sympathetic pat on the shoulder before he took off, heading in the same direction Pansy had disappeared off to.
Both girls blinked and gave him identical, stone-faced glares.
Gasping, Pansy fell to the ground and scrambled away. She looked up and watched as Aria turned around slowly, sneering at the person standing behind her.
seem to be the question on everyone's minds nowadays."
"A—and when I confronted him about it, he broke up with me! He actually broke up with me on Christmas, that no good, cheating bastard! I can't believe I ever fell for him—I just...I feel like such an idiot!" She wailed again, pushing past Aria and Pansy as she walked over to her bed and buried her face into her pillows.
Fleur chuckled at his uncomfortable expression and shook her head. "It is not so much a painful process, but rather quite tiresome. Except perhaps the wings. Those take a few days of endless itching and painful twinges before they completely come out." She admitted with a slight grimace.
Unconvinced, Draco arched a single eyebrow and studied her pale face.
Clearing her throat, she waited until Draco hesitantly turned his attention back to her before she continued. "Draco, I'm sorry for everything I said that day in the hospital wing. I was needlessly harsh that day. And...I'm sorry for lying to you about who I was. It was never my intention to hurt or deceive you."
"It was my fault." He reached up, tugging his goggles off so he could give her a sheepish grin that matched her own. "I was too busy avoiding the bludgers that I wasn't watching where I was going—"
They kissed each other as though they were
"Intruding into your personal space." He raised his hand again, pressing his finger playfully against the tip of her nose.
Smirking at the thought, Draco leaned down, catching her parted lips in a fierce, hungry kiss that stole her breath and caused her to keen in approval. Aria wrapped her legs invitingly around his waist, locking their bodies together; but when she linked her arms around his neck and pulled him down against her to deepen their kiss, they were interrupted when the large, mahogany fireplace in front of the bed suddenly flared to life.
With a sigh, Draco allowed his hood to slide back from his face and slowly turned around to face her.

, the crowd of frantic spectators around them began to grow, furiously taking pictures of Aria and Draco from every possible angle. Their excited tittering drew even more people, causing a large crowd of onlookers to begin forming in the middle of the Ministry's atrium lobby, but Aria
Draco tore his gaze away from Fleur as his stomach lurched violently at the thought. He closed his eyes and shook his head a couple of times, trying to clear the horrifying image of Aria's bloodstained feathers away from his mind.

"You two are
and Aria heard from Blaise that Luca and Olivert were suspended for two weeks, followed by a series of weekly detentions for the remainder of the school year.
"Gods!"
"You're not here to
Draco frowned, his eyebrows fusing together in question.
"That's not exactly why I—"
"I made you my mate because I love you."
"But speaking of your better half—"
Their gazes met, and they smiled slowly at each other before Aria leaned down, resting her cheek against his chest and allowing her wings to fold around them like a blanket. Then, yawning, Aria closed her eyes and snuggled sleepily against him.
Blaise grinned again and answered her with another noncomittal shrug.
"What's got your knickers in a twist this time?" He deadpanned.
"We want you to make a public statement." Ilyana answered calmly, arching an elegant eyebrow at her words. She straightened in her seat and folded her hands primly on her lap. "We'll arrange all the necessary schedules and logistics of course.
"I'm Blaise, your resident house prefect. I currently live in Italy with my mother and my stepfather – whom I'm fairly certain my mother will divorce by the end of the year. In my spare time, I enjoy art and reading classical literature. And after I graduate, I plan to set up my very own art exhibit displaying my works in a classy studio somewhere in France."
The blunt nonchalance in Luna's voice caused Draco to scowl at her in confusion. "Most people are trapped by circumstances, after all. And we make do with what we can."
you two!" She blurted out, and she looked as though she wanted to hurl her goblet across the table at their matching smirks. "You should go after her, you're her friends! She looked like she was going to cry back there."
He nodded wordlessly; and after a few minutes of awkward silence between them, the last few notes of the song they had been waltzing to finally faded out and they quietly began making their way back to their seats. As soon as they sat down, Greg turned to her and gave her a small, uncertain smile.
(See the end of the chapter for
Bloody hell,
"Nearing that age?" Draco echoed, blinking uneasily at her.
"That's unfortunate." Blaise looked a little disappointed at her response. "I was kind of hoping to get you properly drunk this time."
He crashed into a big group of reporters, including Rita Skeeter, knocking them all down to the floor in a tangled pile of limbs and bodies. As Bentley scrambled to his feet, Aria knelt back down onto the ground beside Draco's unconscious form. She was just about to use a spell to wake him up when she heard Bentley screaming at her from several feet away.
He calmly began to make his way to his usual compartment, and it didn't take him long to reach the Slytherin-occupied end of the train. When he got there and slid open the doors, the familiar sight of his friends – Blaise Zabini, Pansy Parkinson and Greg Goyle — greeted him.
One chapter left, guys! Well, technically, two chapters left if I include the Epilogue. We're almost there! ;)
"I know." Hermione sighed, slumping into her seat. "It's all just…
"Apology accepted.

Sighing, she walked over to stand beside him and began levitating a few Belladona flowers into her own basket. "I was just trying to make casual conversation. You know, like most

"I meant your veela wings, actually."
Greg continued to frown at the two boys in warning. "There's nothing wrong with Hufflepuff
"I said let me go! Do you want me to report you?! I'm still a Prefect!" Pansy threatened.
They stared awkwardly at each other, all of the unspoken words that needed to be said hanging uncomfortably in the air between them, but neither of them knew how to proceed. Finally, when the silence became unbearable, Aria took a deep, shaky breath.
but it is more...er...What is the English equivalent again?" Fleur sighed as she struggled to find the correct word.
cries when you fight back against her. She's sensitive like that, even if it's usually her who starts the fight." Blaise retorted with a snort, rolling his eyes.
"So what happened then? Why didn't it work out?" Morag prodded curiously, a small smirk on her face as she took after Hannah and alternated her gaze back and forth between Draco and Pansy.
The amusement on Fleur's expression slowly vanished, only to be replaced by a forced, indulgent smile.
, Greg had managed to aim one of the bludgers straight into Draco's right arm. He had to spend the rest of the game struggling to throw the quaffle into the goal posts with only his left arm after that, so he ended up missing a lot of his shots. And despite the apologetic shrug Greg gave him during one of their time-outs, Draco suspected that his friend was also feeling a little bit vindictive about the whole thing - if the way he was obviously trying not to smile was any indication.
The smile on Aria's face dimmed a little as she shifted her gaze from Corey's flying form to Ginny, watching as the redheaded girl took another graceful dive in the air. "How is Ginny, by the way? She's been really immersing herself in nothing but quidditch this year."
"But based on your reaction, I don't think that's something
"You expect me to just—"
"If it wasn't for you and Ron, that night with the fiendfyre, Draco and I would probably be
"What do you know?" Aria commented about half an hour later as she glanced over at their potion, grinning slightly when she saw that the shimmering liquid was nearing its final shade of turquoise blue.
Her eyes glowed; and she had to force her next words out in a harsh, raspy whisper.
