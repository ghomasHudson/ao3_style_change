Potter seemed to weigh this and then nodded, slowly.
“Harry? Is everything alright?”
She mumbled all of this very quickly, but Draco felt fire flood through his blood with every word. He was about to speak, but Potter beat him to it.
“Says you, Mr I-Only-Date-Quidditch-Players,” countered Ron, eyebrows raised.
She raised her eyebrows at him.
wanna run your mouth?” Finnigan’s fair skin seemed to be reddening slightly. The tall one, his friend—Thomas—tried to pull him back slightly.
Feeling empty without an enemy to hunt down?”
“Er…you’re welcome, Draco.”
“Harry,” Ginny said, her voice slow and cautious. “Do you…
“Er, I mean…”
“Yeah,” Potter said, pulling up his trousers. “Merlin knows I’ll need to blow off some steam.”
“What about you, Harry?” Ron asked. “Still have kids vomiting on you?”
Daphne nodded emphatically and grabber her book once more, bringing it back up to her chest and standing up.
“Or you will no longer have a job in this office.”
As usual, Hermione had an answer for him.
Potter snorted, and Draco felt a thousand stone lighter. This was easier, this back-and-forth of sarcasm and taunts, this he could handle. As long as he threw in a few insults to Potter here and there, he was sure he could get through this. Probably.
Malfoy gaped at him, momentarily forgetting to put in the effort to look cool and collected and uncaring.
seventh year was a year of preparation, but I had no idea we would be undertaking apprenticeships! I haven’t prepared for this at all. I have classes until past six, but I think I’m going to go to the library afterwards to do some more research. I do with Professor McGonagall had at least
Ginny grinned.
Draco did not trust easily. He was taught from a very young age that trusting people was dangerous, that they would always let you down. His father had told him, time and time again,
you were in my career prospects. I’ll make sure to consult you next time I plan on making any decisions regarding
“Every day?” Harry exclaimed. “This is going to keep happening?”
“No, no, I just came early, in case I needed to set anything up,” Potter replied, pushing his glasses further up onto his nose.
“The other flowers. What do they mean?”
It was true, Demelza had chosen her players well. Ritchie Coote and Jimmy Peakes had stayed on as Beaters, and Demelza and Ginny were joined as Chasers by a new find by the name of Natalie McDonald, a fifth year who flew with her small body pressed down against her broom to advance her speed. She was flying on what looked like a Comet 360, but her speed could rival that of the Firebolt due to her technique.
“For everything. I dunno. I never thought I’d be sitting here having this kind of conversation with you. I never thought we’d be friends at all. But here we are. And I’m glad. So thank you.”
Daphne just snorted once again.
“Order her the elderflower wine,” Draco added, feeling somewhat winded. “Lègendaire is famous for it.”
“It isn’t that,” Draco said, quietly, feeling his heart beat in his ears as Potter took a step closer to him.
“Sounds like she sucked,” Laurel finally said, a half-smirk on her face, and the tension that was weighing over the table snapped like a twig.
“You did?” she asked. “What did you say?”
“Yeah, we had to have him remove the spell in order to release you,” Chang confirmed. “He was upstairs, Transfigured himself into a bed.”
“That was brilliant, Malfoy!” he said, and clapped a hand on Draco’s shoulder, hard.
“Than doing the wrong thing, for the right reasons,” he said, his voice sounding small and far away. Potter’s green eyes drilled into him.
this frustrating? No wonder Granger was so tightly wound; if Draco had to spend half his life explaining everything to Potter, he would be too.
sorry. I was out of line. Especially…you’re not like your father, at all, really. I was just…trying to get you angry, I suppose.”
“You really are a git, Malfoy, you know that?”
wanted to recruit you and you said no. Fucking Potter.”
“Come,” Nathaniel had said. “Let’s get you out of the rain.”
Potter scoffed.
“Yes, like…learning a new language, or learning how to bake, or growing a garden!”
His father had always treated him well. He had been a spoiled child, and he knew it, too. The only Malfoy heir, he received anything he desired as a child, and his parents were loving and devoted. His father may have been more stern and particular, but he always explained himself and Draco was always kept very aware of how proud they both were of him.
Potter stared at him.
“It’s not that strange,” Potter argued and this time, Draco rolled his eyes. Despite having buried the hatchet, Potter still seemed to have this need to be contrary about everything Draco said, even though he didn’t always notice he was doing it.
And yes, sure, they had won. But at what cost? Could it really count as winning if they had lost so many people, so many lives? Harry still thought about them all, about Remus and Tonks, about Fred, and Moody, and Dumbledore; even Snape. And Sirius. Always Sirius. He thought after three years maybe the pain would start to subside or numb itself out, but it still came at him in harsh reminders, like a quick stab to the chest every time.
“Come on, you have to admit, that was fun. This was a fun day.”
He tried to shake himself out of that idea as quickly as possible.
The door to the dormitory swung open and Draco and Theo jumped apart.
“Did you enjoy the meetings? With Dumbledore’s Army?”
Draco gained enough of his composure to snort.
felt familiar.
“Er…” Harry stumbled, not even sure what was being asked of him.
anything! It just keeps happening!”
“Not because I owe you,” Draco said, quickly. “Because I want to. Let me take you out for dinner, or…or something.”
“So when she dies, the blood magic will not have any family to bond to. And he’ll be at risk.”
“Is…” Hermione hesitated, looking over at Ginny, who had chosen that moment to press a loud kiss onto Heidi’s cheek, causing the other girl to laugh and jokingly swat her away. “Is it hard? Seeing Ginny with someone else?”
Hi all! I know the last chapter was super short, so here's a long one to make up for it! Thanks for reading, let me know what you think <3
She hadn’t really
Okay, that's all I've got! Chapter title is from Life of the Party by All Time Low and this chap's moodboard is our lovely Draco. Enjoy!
“Shh!” Hermione hushed them. “Oh, look, now we’ve missed an introduction."
“Spell to clean a dirty wound?”
that, Harry, it’s bad luck!”
Draco expected Violet to get outraged, to begin one of her rants about preposterous pureblood traditions and their dangerous nature, but she didn’t. Instead, her shoulders merely slumped.
“Funnily enough, I don’t actually enjoy talking about all my near-death experiences that much,” Harry snapped, earning him wary looks from his friends. He sighed again. “Sorry.”
anymore.
“Pansy’s an acquired taste.”
“Kids are sort of told it’s your soulmate, more romantic that way.”
Although, a voice that sounded suspiciously like Violet’s reminded him in his head, his annoyance could largely be due to the fact that he and Granger were rather similar in that respect, tending to assume they were the smartest person in the room at any given time. If he expected Granger to admit her gaps in knowledge, he would have to admit his own.
It was the same the other way around, however. Sophie was a beautiful girl, dark hair and pale eyes and a slender figure, but she was definitely more Ron’s type. Harry didn’t really know if he had a type. He supposed he didn’t have enough experience to have a type. Hermione would know. She always knew.
Draco couldn’t help but snort at Potter’s poor impression of Granger. Potter didn’t look amused, however, just tired. He took his glasses off for a moment to rub at his eyes before shoving them back on.
Draco looked back at the Mark, unsure where to start.
“I was actually thinking of you.”
It wasn’t that he particularly missed who he used to be. He just didn’t know who he was now.
Hermione seemed to ponder this.
Draco took his loathed wand into his hand and inspected it, feeling the material in his hand. Ollivander was right, of course, it was much sturdier than redwood should be. It had striping down it too, which woods had that again?
Slughorn looked at Malfoy as if he had just realized he was there. A second passed, and then he absolutely beamed.
Perhaps absent-mindedly, Hermione touched the scar that Bellatrix had left on her throat.
Potter’s lips twitched.
much about Nott, but well, it was possible, wasn’t it?”
“I beg your pardon, sir?” Draco asked, trying not to wince at the man’s furrowed eyebrows.
“Notably hard to please,” Draco said at once. Once he had figured out that his new wand was made of larch wood, he’d been slightly apprehensive, unsure if it would work well for him. “It’s constantly in demand because of its strength and reputation. It can be tricky to handle, but when bonded to a well-deserving master, it can have a lot of hidden abilities and effects.”
Ron was yelling loudly throughout most of the game, especially when a Hufflepuff Beater pelted Bludger at Ginny and hit her right in the ribs, causing her to double over on her broom.
Draco tried to hold himself back, he really did.
“What d’you want, Malfoy?” Weasley said, the aggression barely disguised in his tone. Draco clenched his teeth.
“Well, I’m sure there’s something else you could do,” he said, dismissively, and Draco found himself bristling at how casually Slughorn was taking this. He knew that he had scoffed at the idea of having any sort of future himself, but it felt very different when someone else—a professor, at that—was doing it.
“Please do,” she said. “And you know you can always talk to me, right?”
“Oh!” Potter said. “You’re—yeah, I’ll go get them.”
He hadn’t spoken to Draco in years, but he knew that he had been working hard. Ron had been sent to Ollivanders more than once to check up on him, as part of his “Death Eater clean-up” duty, but he always described it as a pointless endeavour, as there was never anything illegal going on there. Despite keeping his nose clean however, it seemed as though suspicion continued to follow Draco.
He frowned. He certainly wasn’t expecting anybody. It had to be Hermione. She had been feeling guilty ever since Harry’s Subconscious Linked Legilimency had ceased its regular course. He had reassured her it wasn’t her fault, that he had agreed to do the article, and that it was him who wanted to reach out in the first place, but she still had that sorry expression on her face when she saw him.
“I’m three minutes early,” Draco said, spinning around to face Finchley. “Would you like me to arrive even earlier? I know how much you’d hate to have to pay overtime.”
“I know,” Draco said. It was true, of course; as soon as she said the words, it seemed glaringly obvious, but he felt a strange sense of relief regardless. “I’m not saying goodbye. I’m just saying thank you.”
“I don’t think anything short of death will get Hollowell away from the Hit-Wizards,” Sophie said, with a snort. “He’s in Mungo’s so often he practically has his own room, but he keeps going back into the field. Says he’s made for it. Honestly, I almost believe him; sometimes I can’t believe how he’s still standing what with the amount of spell damage he’s been through.”
“Very well, Potter. I agree to be civil, if that’s what you’re looking for,” Draco provided, which he found to be rather generous. Potter just snorted.
“You breathe as loud as a hippogriff,” Malfoy said, still not looking up at Harry. “And I don’t know of anyone else at Hogwarts with an Invisibility Cloak.”
“What direction?” asked Draco.
He started to fly back down towards the ground, until buildings came back into sight. He had long left Diagon Alley, and couldn’t recognise exactly where he was. It seemed to be within the Wizarding area, as he could see people walking through the streets in robes. He flew down lower, hoping to catch sign of a street sign, or something else to help him identify where he was, when, out of nowhere, something swooped into him.
The way he said it wasn’t accusing. He wasn’t waiting for Draco to contradict him. He said it with certainty, with matter-of-factness.
“Oh,” said Harry, unsure how to react to this news. “Have you seen her?”
He and Hermione both rose from their seats, Hermione offering them a wave, and exited the Great Hall, with Ron at a sort of half-jog and Hermione at a brisk walk.
Ginny looked like she was about to say something, but was interrupted by the sound of a bell chiming, the sign that the front door had just been opened.
spending time with Potter, oddly enough. Perhaps he wasn’t the most intellectual person Draco had ever met, but he was interesting, far more interesting than Draco had always thought. He carried this strong energy with him, beyond just the power of his magic, although that in and of itself was a sight to behold. So he kept going to the sessions, but the logical part of his brain continued to remind him that there was no real reason to continue them, beyond just his own desire to be near Potter.
“I want them here,” Harry said, and everyone’s head whipped around to look at him. He didn’t know what made him say it. He supposed it was rather unfair, to invite everyone but the Slytherins, especially considering the fact that they were all sharing a common room together.
Hermione’s lips pursed at the word ‘soulmate,’ but she didn’t argue.
“Do you want…” Harry trailed off, looking at Draco with furrowed eyebrows. “Is it too soon?”
“What about?”
“Malfoy!” he said, walking up to him, and Malfoy’s head snapped up so quickly, Harry practically felt it in his own neck.
“You should listen to your boyfriend, Weasley,” Draco smirked. “He’s actually got it right for once.”
“Whitewater thinks it
“I, er, I never really thought about it, Professor.”
“Apparently, my education in all things Muggle was severely lacking,” he said. He was looking all around the room, trying to find something to fix his gaze on, uncomfortably aware that Potter’s eyes never once left his face. There was a long moment of silence, and then Potter broke it with a sudden and random subject change.
It was all very confusing.
“Are you going to join me, Potter, or just stand there staring?”
“Well, it definitely worked. Good job, five points to Gryffindor. Who’s next?”
“And that’s precisely why I asked Granger for help and not you, Potter,” he snapped, turning back to Granger and carrying on as if Potter hadn’t spoken. “When you take the Oath, you recite a passage, a verse that binds the magic together. It specifically refers to keeping the bloodline pure and keeping the Sacred Twenty-Eight alive through marriage and children. But the marriage part is where it gets a little grey.”
“How much do you know about the Oath of the Sacred Twenty-Eight?”
“I will not make you do anything you don’t want to,” she said, firmly. “But I will say this would be great exposure for you and the team. Besides, I know you’re not lacking in funds, but you’ll have access to brand new Quidditch gear before it’s even released. Don’t tell me that isn’t tempting.”
She looked off to the side as if trying to remember something.
The table went rather quiet.
Draco felt his breathing pick up, ever so slightly. Ever since
He didn’t say any of this, mainly because Hermione had already started voicing concerns about how much he was sleeping these days.
“That’s wonderful. It’s always important to do something you love, don’t you think?”
Sure enough, at a quarter after, the Aurors poured in, chattering loudly amongst themselves.
“The snakeberry. It’s not for me,” Malfoy repeated, a gentle pink flush rising on his pale neck.
the man, but it still felt like he was losing someone close to him.
“Happy birthday!” Everyone exclaimed, and Harry couldn’t help but find he was grinning. He clinked his glass with everyone else’s, several spilling drops onto the table, before taking a long hearty drink.
“You’re very welcome, Daphne,” he said, feeling a bit flustered when she released him. “But I have to remind you, that would mean the line will end with you completely. It won’t merge with another pureblood family, unless or until Astoria gets married.”
for it.
Harry hopped across the page until he reached the N and stood there.
to marry any of them, did you?” Granger continued.
even the little jibes he made at Harry’s potion-making skills had been rather gentle and…well,
“I’ve taken the Oath,” he said, instead. “I’d like to know what exactly I swore to.”
, of all people, so he wasn’t sure how to proceed from here.
As it were, though, Draco was far too preoccupied to wonder about the strange qualities of the hallway he was walking down. Tonight was his first meeting with Ollivander, and he didn’t know what to expect. He still didn’t understand why Ollivander had agreed to mentor him, but he was overwhelmingly grateful that he had, so he didn’t want to mess up and make him change his mind.
Potter was looking at their cauldron, with a strange expression on his face, as if he was reading a complex and difficult book and struggling to understand it.
“Will we no longer have access to our old common rooms?”
After Harry finished his tea, he gestured for Ella to come over to the table in order to pay, only to be informed that Draco had already covered it.
“You helped it—you—Potter—
“Potions, hmm?” Slughorn murmured, unhelpfully. “Anything in particular you’d like to do with Potions or are you interested in becoming a Potioneer?”
once again, I must apologize for the lateness of this chapter. I'm returning home in four days and hopefully then will have more time to dedicate to writing. that being said, this chapter is a little longer than the past few so I hope that somewhat makes up for it.
“Maybe I’ll see you afterwards?” Draco had asked, trying unsuccessfully to sound blasé. He was terrible at hiding his emotions around Potter, and it was only Potter’s natural obliviousness that kept him safe.
“That kind of sounds like what Dumbledore always used to say,” Harry said, without thinking. When Hermione gave him a curious look, he elaborated, “He always talked about the power of love and I always related it to my mother, and her love for me. But there were other kinds of love that saved me, other kinds of love that had that power.”
Draco stared at her.
this killed me to write but I FINALLY got it done. apologies for the long wait, but that's just Who I Am as a writer. hope you enjoy!
It was easy to tell Ashworth was incredibly proud of being a Gryffindor. He had a scarlet triangular tapestry with a lion on it hanging on the wall behind his desk, and the desk itself was home to a number of golden quills and a large, red chair made of velvet.
, he neglected to add.
Draco still didn’t understand how Granger could be so nice to him. Yes, he was being extraordinarily gracious to her now, but there was still no reason for her to grant him her time. He supposed maybe she liked knowing something Draco didn’t.
As he walked down the stairs from the dormitories, he tried to keep an open mind. He still felt a warm, happy sort of feeling in his stomach, and he was determined to make the most of this Christmas, however untraditional it was.
“That’s decided then.” Hermione said, in an official tone of voice. “The Slytherins stay.”
“He was quite eager when he heard it was you I wanted him to instruct.”
“Brilliant!” he exclaimed. “Thank you!”
Always make the right choice, eh?
“Well,” Draco said, slowly. “I was thinking about the trees used for wand woods and how many of them are significant in Muggle culture as well.”
“I feel like you’re perhaps focusing on the wrong thing. Shouldn’t we instead be celebrating that I just managed to cast a Patronus?”
Ollivander had told him to organise it the way he liked, since it was to be his workplace and therefore needed to be an environment he felt productive in. So Draco had done so, rearranging the work station and purchasing shelves for all of his supplies. He had also put in a couple armchairs and a kettle by the fireplace for breaks and for when Ollivander stopped by.
Things had been going so
“First shoot?” Draco asked, looking at Harry sympathetically. Harry almost started; he didn’t think Draco had ever looked at him with anything but anger or malice.
She had has great gashes in her face, her neck, her chest. She’d seemed to be bleeding from
But it doesn't matter.
to do; why am I so stupid?”
“Yes, it will some,” she said, with her characteristic honesty. “But not terribly.”
And yes, while a voice—sounding suspiciously like Hermione’s—rung in the back of Harry’s head, reminding him that not
The question took Draco by surprise and he stared at her with wide eyes.
“Oh, bollocks, I hadn’t even thought of that,” Harry groaned.
“Yes, yes. The two used to be great friends, of course, as all the founders had been. It was only after Slytherin descended into a state of deep paranoia and madness about Muggleborns that the two had their infamous falling out. Thus began the centuries-long rivalry between the two Houses. I’m sure that two founders would be rather impressed that you and Draco have kept that spirit alive amongst yourselves.”
“I don’t know if swearing at an officer from the M.L.E.S. is really what constitutes wittiness, but cheers, Malfoy.”
” Ron asked, gaping at him. “You didn’t ask him what happened? You didn’t ask why he suddenly stopped wanting to talk to you?”
“I want to kiss you again,” said Potter, seriously. “Is that how you feel?”
“D. Black. Hmm. Haven’t worked with him before. I know they were considering Oliver Rivers, he’s done a few shoots with us before. But he’s all dark-haired and brooding, too similar to you.”
“A Wizard’s Chess set,” he replied, setting down the heavy board and picking up a pawn, made of a delicate blue stone of some sort. “It’s made of celestite. Blue and white.”
Today’s offer was shepherd’s pie and tomato soup; an odd combination, but Draco accepted both onto his tray. He sat at his usual table, the small two-seater in the corner, where he could sit half-hidden behind a large potted plant. He ate his tomato soup quietly, counting down the minutes in his head.
“Yes, of course, I…” Draco sighed. He wondered when he was finally going to really trust Potter. After all, they had been working together for over two years now, and had saved each other from messy situations at least a dozen times over. Draco could easily say he trusted Potter with his life, and he liked to think that Potter could say the same, but that didn’t mean he trusted him with…information. With details about his personal life. With his history. It was harder to talk than to duel sometimes, particularly to Potter. And yet Potter seemed to find it so easy, casually mentioning his family dinners at the Weasleys’, and nightmares about the war, and doubts about himself, all just spilling out of him as if he were discussing the weather. And Draco would stumble over himself and try to come up with an adequate reply that reflected the seriousness of the subject matter, but then Potter would just follow it up with something inane like “have you had the lemon scones in the cafeteria? They’re always gone by the time I get there.” It was all just open vulnerability with Potter and Draco was terrified of it, partly because he couldn’t imagine doing so himself, and, perhaps, partly because there was something so…
But now…well, with his nightmares slightly—if not entirely—abated, and no Dark wizards currently threatening him or his friends, Harry’s priorities were somewhat different. He had N.E.W.Ts to stress over, certainly, and his apprenticeship with Ashworth as well as the additional advanced magic Waya was teaching him, but this…whatever this was seemed to be preoccupying him as well.
Malfoy often didn’t make any sense to Harry. Not that he had been expecting him to be grateful or anything, but no matter how much progress they seemed to make, it appeared as though there was always going to be this underlying animosity between them.
He tacked on the thanks so he wouldn’t sound excessively rude—he didn’t want to give anyone a reason to accuse him of reverting back to his ‘old ways’—and then turned and left Slughorn’s quarters as quickly as he came.
He had also started thinking about what he would start their lessons off with. He knew he had promised to teach Malfoy how to cast a Patronus, but he didn’t want to start with that, for fear that once Malfoy could do it, he’d have no reason to stick around and learn anymore. He also wasn’t sure how much of what he had to teach would be new information to Malfoy.
Draco ducked his head, willing the heat that bloomed in his cheeks to disappear. He couldn’t help but feel proud of himself, having just cast a Shield Charm so powerful it knocked Potter backwards.
“I suppose that’s all well and good, Potter, but it’s easier said than done.”
“Of course,” Harry mumbled, turning his head to see Draco Malfoy approaching the set, followed by Gabriel, who still looked rather cheerful and pleasant, and Demelza, who was chewing on her bottom lip and avoiding Harry’s eye.
As soon as the words were out of his mouth, Harry bit his tongue. Ollivander had just died. Obviously, Draco would not be doing great.
“What?” he exclaimed.
“Oh, it’s been wonderful!” she exclaimed. “Peter even said he was going to take my proposals to his boss.”
Potter looked at him in surprise.
"You’re as bad as Ron, you know,” he said, and Ginny laughed and suddenly, he felt a lot lighter in his chest. “Come on, let’s get back to the others.”
Finnigan reluctantly tore his eyes away from Draco’s face to look at Granger, whose jaw was set and whose eyes seemed to shine with ire. Draco found himself feeling more fearful of her than Finnigan, even though her gaze was not directed at him.
“Yes,” he said, purposefully not elaborating at all. Unfortunately, Potter was not the type to take a hint.
Hermione swatted at Ron half-heartedly, who merely chuckled and wrapped an arm around her.
She nodded once more, wringing her hands in her lap.
“Enjoy what, sir?”
“I don’t know. Maybe it’ll force you to make some new friends!”
“When will you cease this fruitless effort to set me up with one of the dozens of unfortunate men you happen upon?”
“I’m sorry,” he said, quietly. “I didn’t think.”
“About what?” asked Harry.
“Of course. Are you alright?”
century, and the facts she’d given him had left him in such disbelief that he had spent an entire night in the library’s Muggle Studies section, until he’d learned as much as he possibly could. He’d sat there, horrified at what he’d read, but also horrified that he hadn’t known. After that, he listened to every word Violet said about her classes, and almost always went to the library afterwards for further research.
He remembered how enjoyable it had always been to poke fun at Weasley—sometimes even more than Potter, and so much
Ron shook his head, incredulously.
Somehow, this thing about Potter, this drawer of untouched, unanalysed…feelings…it felt different than everything else. Stranger. Deeper, as if sparks of it were running through his blood, built into his very bones. It scared him, and his first instinct was to find another drawer to throw it back into. But that technique no longer seemed to even be an option. After the war had finally ended, it was as though he’d just realised how much effort he’d been putting into keeping these abscesses of his mind shut, and his brain simply could not sustain it any longer. He’d stretched the rubber band too far, and the tension had disappeared all at once—as it had snapped.
Potter looked at him, expression somewhat amused.
“A new skill?”
It had been a wild, torrid love affair that was too good to be true, and eventually spiralled into chaos. Rhiannon warned Harry that he couldn’t have a healthy relationship if he didn’t know how to take care of himself and how to properly regulate his emotions. He insisted it wasn’t a problem, that he
Draco felt his stomach twisting with nerves, but he was already this far gone, and the adrenaline rushing through his veins was so
“She hates the Draco Malfoy who called her a Mudblood and made her and her friends’ lives miserable,” retorted Violet, effectively shutting Draco up again. “But the Draco desperate to know how Muggles walked on the moon?”
“But, but who is this person?” Harry asked. “What makes them my soulmate? Or, supposed soulmate or whatever.”
“Yeah,” said Harry. He’d been reminding himself of that almost daily, any time he could feel his anxiety prickling up. It was true—he
“I’ve been promising Luna I would go visit the Thestrals in the Forest with her for weeks now. Apparently, the babies’ wings are fully grown and they’re starting to fly now, so I told her I’d join her to visit them this weekend.”
Draco looked at him, trying to figure out if this was some sort of trick, if Potter’s friends were lying in wait for the perfect moment to jump out and hex him. But Potter simply looked curious, his face so open, every emotion written so plainly on his face it made Draco feel vulnerable just
Potter, as always, stood beside Weasley, smiling genially as Finnigan elbowed him in the ribs.
to Theo?) and Potter was interjecting himself back into Draco’s life for who knows what reason, and the person Draco most wanted to talk to about everything—Ollivander—had died. He kept thinking about what Potter had said about seeing a Mind Healer. It had never been something Draco had considered—his upbringing with Lucius as a father certainly hadn’t encouraged Draco to speak openly about his feelings—but now that Potter had brought it up, he kept thinking about it.
“Yes, on my seventeenth birthday,” he confirmed.
Maybe he had finally gotten tired—tired of seeing young people dying and suffering in an old man’s war. Maybe he had just wanted it all to be over, wanted everything to settle down into some sort of normalcy that he’d never truly gotten to experience. Maybe it had had something to do with Malfoy’s defiant expression, this look that seemed to say he couldn’t care less if his own sentence was a Dementor’s Kiss, but if anyone dared try and harm his mother, he would kill them with his bare hands.
“Of course, I know your year is very busy with the apprenticeships. Have you begun yours yet? What are you apprenticing in?”
“Experimenting with cores is a vital part of your education in wandmaking. Were you thinking of any in particular?” Ollivander turned his wide, silvery gaze to Draco.
be caught doing anything illegal, they’ll send me back to Azkaban the first chance they get.”
he was mad about anymore, he was just
The prickle that went up Draco’s spine, he knew, had nothing to do with the nettle wine he had drunk.
“How was it?”
Draco didn’t even flinch at the words, but he felt them settle uncomfortably in his gut, twisting around with the wine—
Draco clutched at the letter until he realized the parchment was crinkling in his tight clasp and released it to fall onto the table. He hurriedly grabbed at the next letter and began to read.
“How did that feel?” he asked at once.
The last time he’d seen him was at his and Narcissa’s trials—one of the few times Harry had left the Burrow in the past several months.
“That’s wonderful, Harry, I’m so glad.”
“This has nothing to do with you being Harry Potter,” Ginny waved him off. “This has everything to do with
Hermione beamed.
By the time he reached the entrance to the Headmistress’s office, he was beginning to doubt his decision.
“Godric, no,” Harry shook his head vigorously, thinking of Umbridge. Ashworth chuckled again.
“Stop,” breathed Potter, grabbing at Draco’s arm to stop his movements. Draco obeyed at once, and allowed Potter to manhandle him onto the bed. Clothes came off slowly, Potter meticulously undressing Draco, his stubble scratching gently as he kissed down Draco’s chest.
Draco had gaped at her, wondering how she couldn’t see that he would never be able to gain respectable employment due to the bloody
“Do you need any help?” he asked, gesturing to the steaming pots behind her. She waved him away.
“Excellent,” Waya nodded, approvingly. “What else?”
“When does fall semester start for you again?” Rhiannon asked, seemingly having decided that Harry had digested his own words. “It isn’t the same as Hogwarts, right?”
Draco narrowed his eyes dangerously, but Potter only snickered.
He reminded himself she had just returned to Britain for the first time since the war, and perhaps didn’t know how she would be welcomed. For that, he felt a rush of sympathy for her. He knew what it was like to live as a former Death Eater in a post-war world, and though she had never taken the Mark, she had earned a reputation as a Death Eater sympathiser, and had to be afraid of the reaction she would get from people upon her return.
“You’re quite welcome, Mr Malfoy. You were sent that letter for a reason. You are wanted back here at Hogwarts.”
“And you taught most—if not all—of Dumbledore’s Army to do the same?”
“Maybe you’re just getting better,” said Potter, mulishly.
“You had no right to take our case like that,” Potter said, firmly. “You could have come to me as a fellow member of the department and asked if the Aurors and the M.L.E.S. could cooperate and work together on this case, but instead you went over our heads and are shifting authority on a case in progress. Do you know how much work will be lost that way? We have a rapport with the witnesses! We have potential leads!”
“Ron, that was your
Harry shrugged.
It was at dinner that she approached them, walking with her head down until she reached where they were sitting at the Slytherin table.
Dennis also acquiesced and Draco hesitantly reached for Harry, as though he were expecting Harry to physically push back.
“I suppose,” Draco said, slowly. “But you’d have to have a male of the Sacred Twenty-Eight agree to that, and it
is what’s wrong with it! Every other House—remembrance of the dead, celebration of the dead, tribute to the dead, but Slytherin?
“What? But—he—you—
“Go take a shower, you smell,” said Draco, pushing Harry away.
“Why?” Draco croaked. “Why did you tell me?”
“Have you nothing better to do on a Saturday, Potter?” he asked, half-way through a tremendously difficult-to-read passage in an ancient pureblood history book.
Seeing Malfoy’s emotions was rare—he was normally cool and composed, unless he was angry or spiteful, but mostly impossible to read.
“Walking helps me think,” he said, surprising Draco, who had been expecting a retort of some kind.
“Hey!” Hermione exclaimed.
Draco found himself looking forward to going to the Ministry, just so he could have those short conversations with Potter. The more days that passed however, the more disheartened he became at Potter’s surprised expression when he entered the Auror headquarters. He knew that Potter wasn’t remembering any of these conversations, and he hated knowing that they could never become real friends like this.
It was comforting, to have this sense of familiarity, particularly when everything else felt wildly out of orbit.
“The Houses of Ilvermorny represent parts of a whole. Horned Serpent—the mind; Thunderbird—the soul; Wampus—the body; Pukwudgie—the heart. Each vitally important, but best results come from all parts working together. That isn’t to say there isn’t any competition between the Houses; there certainly is. But overall, students from different Houses are encouraged to cooperate with each other, share their skills, in order to create harmony and balance. Professor McGonagall has been pushing for stronger House unity here at Hogwarts as well this year, especially because of how Slytherin House has been suffering.”
“An old friend!” added Ron.
But it wasn’t just him. Gryffindor and Slytherin students famously didn’t get along, as he and Waya had discussed. It just wasn’t common to see Gryffindor and Slytherin students as friends. The Slytherins had never given Harry any reason to trust them, and that hadn’t changed this year, despite all he’d been hearing about them needing a second chance.
Draco felt his heart drop. He almost felt he would be insulting Ollivander by showing him the shoddy excuse for a wand he’d been using. Nevertheless, he withdrew it and handed it to the old wandmaker. Ollivander examined it for a long, agonizing minute or two.
“Well, yeah,” said Harry, sheepishly. Malfoy was being alarmingly quiet and polite, and Harry did not know how to deal with that kind of a Malfoy. He was half-hoping Malfoy would smash his teacup against the floor; he was better equipped to handle that.
“Come off it, Malfoy,” scoffed Potter. “It’s not like we’re friends, you and I. But we’ve been working well together in Potions this year.”
“You’re beautiful like this, you know,” murmured Potter, barely audible as his mouth roamed down Draco’s neck to where it met his shoulder. Sometimes he said things like this, off-handedly, as though they meant nothing to him, when they meant everything to Draco.
“I haven’t
“I did want to ask, Harry,” Waya spoke again, and Harry focused his attention on him. “If you would be interested in continuing our sessions after you have finished your schooling.”
So it only made sense that the Dark Mark was similar in nature. Lucius had failed, and Draco was given the responsibility of making up for the sins of his father.
“Is that what you thought you’d have to do?”
It was a bit of a touchy topic, as Daphne felt insulted that her parents would imply she had failed them by being in a relationship with Violet, while Astoria sometimes became frustrated at Daphne, as—despite knowing she wasn’t to blame—it was because of her that the Greengrasses were so insistently pushing on Astoria finding a partner.
“I’ll be outside,” she said, and walked off, leaving them standing by Claudia’s portrait.
“Does that mean someone agreed to mentor me?” he asked, trying to hide the anticipation in his voice.
Potter looked as if Draco had just announced he was marrying a house elf.
“I wouldn’t know,” he said, amiably. “That’s your job, isn’t it?”
“Well, Muggles have these machines that can fly,” she started.
“You have no right to speak to your superior that way!” he exclaimed.
Everyone stared and waited in silence. Draco strangely found he was holding his breath tightly. And then the tear near the brim opened wide, and in a terribly dark and low voice, the Sorting Hat began to sing:
“Alright, Dennis?” he asked, still looking at Harry.
It wasn’t enough for him to win, Draco also had to
He was also certain that his name was on the Greengrass’s list of potential suitors. He was, after all, one of the only age-appropriate males of the Sacred Twenty-Eight left. He was sure he wasn’t high on the list, what with his ex-Death Eater status. Theo must be up there, and perhaps Longbottom, although he doubted that Longbottom had taken the oath.
“It’s okay, Potter,” Draco murmured, softly. “I won’t break.”
“No, you don’t understand,” said Draco, elatedly. “I didn’t loop! It’s not April 10
“He wanted me to practice making the most popular potions first, so it’s been a lot of Dreamless Sleep and Pepper-Up for the first few months, but recently we’ve been doing more complex ones. We’ve done the theory of Felix Felicis and actually brewed Veritaserum. We’re meant to start Polyjuice once the new year starts. We were meant to do Amortentia, but apparently we’ll have to brew that for our N.E.W.T.s so regular Potions class will cover it.”
Harry blinked at her, confused for a moment. Hadn’t she just said that she knew they were friends? What else could she—
“You know exactly what.”
“And Slytherin?”
“What does it do?”
The new common room looked nothing like the Slytherin dungeons. It was a large, circular room, with two sets of curved staircases at the very back. Near the staircase on the right were large arched windows, with cushioned window-seats and two small shelves full of books. By the staircase on the left was a bulletin board, already half-full with notes and announcements.
Somehow, this thing about Potter, this drawer of untouched, unanalysed…feelings…it felt different than everything else. Stranger. Deeper, as if sparks of it were running through his blood, built into his very bones. It scared him, and his first instinct was to find another drawer to throw it back into. But that technique no longer seemed to even be an option. After the war had finally ended, it was as though he’d just realised how much effort he’d been putting into keeping these abscesses of his mind shut, and his brain simply could not sustain it any longer. He’d stretched the rubber band too far, and the tension had disappeared all at once—as it had snapped.
Harry didn’t like the way this insight made him feel. He found himself obsessing over sixth year again, over all the memories he had of Malfoy sneaking around. At the time, he had been sure Malfoy was up to something, and while he had been right, looking back with the knowledge that Malfoy was very much operating against his own will with the threat of his parents’ deaths looming over him made Harry’s stomach churn.
“That seems healthy,” said Draco, mildly, sipping his tea. He seemed to realise that this was a bit of a touchy topic for Harry and was thus backing off, and Harry was grateful.
“Delmont Bradshaw,” the man who had called his name, a tall, somewhat gangly-looking fellow who looked to be somewhere in his mid-thirties, thrust his hand forward to shake Harry’s eagerly. “Recruiter for the Appleby Arrows. Pleasure to meet you, Mr Potter.”
“So,” said Ashworth, with a small smile. “Time to discuss the future, it seems.”
“Ten minutes for you to hear exactly what I think about doing to you.”
“What business is that of yours?” he asked, his voice level.
A spark of yellow shot from Draco’s wand, and Potter’s blood began to run in the other direction, returning to Potter’s arm before the gashes closed up neatly, leaving no evidence of any wound. Potter’s long white scar, the same size as Draco’s Dark Mark, remained.
Draco watched him.
“There is that,” Laurel admitted. “If only I weren’t a Squib, then
the headline exclaimed.
“I’m on duty today,” Potter explained, rolling out of bed. Draco got up as well, pulling on a dressing gown as Potter re-dressed.
“Harry,” said Waya, looking at him expectantly. Harry obediently rose from his seat, not failing to notice how Waya had known his name without asking.
“Marriage tends to be rather vague, as pureblood marriages require their own, separate oath to be taken. However, many couples nowadays forego the ancient marital ritual, as they find it outdated and unnecessary. My father used to go on about how disgraceful it was that the Weasleys never performed the ritual.”
Without so much as another word, the students all obediently shuffled towards their respective staircases.
All that rung in Draco’s head was Potter saying his given name aloud, something Draco could only remember him doing once before—while taunting Voldemort moments before he killed him.
“To your house?” Daphne asked, passing out plates of tart. “Unannounced?”
Draco’s own family members, so really, he had no right feeling bad for himself at all. Feeling oddly angry and appropriately guilty, Draco bid Violet and Daphne a good day and quickly left the Slytherin table, before Violet could start to figure out what was going on in his head.
of red flowers to choose from if they simply wanted to represent Gryffindor’s colours, why not choose something else? A rose? A carnation? A tulip?”
He wasn’t sure who originally came up with the nickname for Violet and Daphne’s home, but it had stuck and eventually they had even changed the official Floo address to reflect the moniker. Draco rolled his eyes about it and ribbed Violet, but in truth it was a fitting name. It was a nod to Daphne’s surname, of course, but also to her love of gardening and Herbology, and Violet’s name being what it was fit quite nicely as well.
“You’re…having lunch,” said Harry, dumbstruck.
“Don’t worry,” he breathed as he kissed down Potter’s neck, and Potter huffed. “I’ll take care of you.”
Her eyes lit up.
“Pansy said,” Draco spoke breathlessly. “That when you broke into the Ministry in our fifth year, you found out that the Department of Mysteries studies time?”
But that didn’t explain the perverse sort of pleasure Lucius seemed to get from seeing him in pain, the way his lip would curl into something of a smile when Draco panted and whimpered after the curse was removed. His face almost resembled Bellatrix’s in its triumph and it was that face that invaded Draco’s nightmares.
Ginny cut her off.
In today’s Potions, they were finishing the Energy Tonic they’d been working on all month. Harry felt guilt swell up inside him as Slughorn talked about how they’d been checking in on their potions each week, knowing full well he hadn’t checked on it once.
“Robards thought he was going to get to retire after the war,” she said. “That’s why he volunteered to do apprenticeships at Hogwarts our last year. Well, that
“You didn’t read the prep sheet for today, did you?” she asked, quietly, letting Dennis resume the shoot, and gesturing for Harry to follow her.
Potter easily did as he was told, but looked right back at Draco when he was done.
“I’m always thinking you’re fit,” replied Draco, easily. Harry just grinned wider.
They never had a real conversation about the years of enmity they had shared. Draco never found a good opportunity to apologise. Their short, pithy conversations they had at work were definitely not the right time. It wasn’t exactly like they were friends, but Draco still delighted every time Potter wandered over to his neck of the woods and struck up a conversation.
The flowers were beautiful, drawn with thin lines and excellent detail. The stems of the narcissi sprouted from the snake’s head, the zinnia beside the skull but larger and pulling the attention towards it. Two tulips sat on the other side of the skull, with a blooming hyacinth right below them. The skull and snake were no longer the focus, despite their thick black ink.
“So you’ll run Ollivander’s then? You won’t change the—at
“Nonsense,” said Draco. Harry looked at him but he was determinedly looking up at Ella instead. “Ask Sabrina if there’s any treacle tart. If not, get him a Manchester tart.”
“I—yes, but I’m not…I’m not
“Well, no, I just…” Draco thought about this. “I just don’t understand why you’re trusting me with that information.”
“I’d like to,” he said, looking at Draco and trying to communicate with his eyes just how much he meant what he was saying.
for Draco. Potter didn’t trust him. He just needed someone to vent to, someone to spill his feelings out to, someone other than his friends that would jump down his throat with worry.
“Potter, if I got angry every time you got the credit for other people’s work I would have exploded by now.”
Draco pondered this.
“Oh. Draco. Sorry, I just…lost myself for a moment,” she gave him what she clearly meant to be a reassuring smile, but Draco wasn’t fooled.
Violet reached out her free hand and gave Draco’s a squeeze.
“Ollivander,” replied Draco.
“Would you?”
“And what was that?” Potter asked, barely louder than a whisper.
“Hello Dean,” Draco greeted him. “Busy day?”
“Fine, take a loop or two off and go get drunk or whatever you want to do. But you cannot let this keep going on.”
It was a watch—of course—but it was a
“Don’t sound so surprised. We both know you were the youngest Seeker in a century,” he said.
Perhaps it was also because for years they had hated each other, and had only hateful things to say to one another. Draco could barely believe it, but now…they were almost
“It was very nice of you to speak at their trial, Harry,” Hermione said, clearly trying to cheer Harry up.
He had been in a bit of a rush when he’d bought it, not wanting to be seen by anyone, and he’d been far too ashamed to go to Ollivander’s after the ordeal the senior wandmaker had been through at Draco’s own home, so he had settled for some unknown, back-alley wand shop. The owner had been so thrilled to have a customer, Draco thought he could have been the Dark Lord himself and he still would have been happily attended to.
He could’ve saved them all, could’ve set them all free—Lovegood, Thomas, the goblin, Ollivander. But he hadn’t. Instead, he’d just followed orders like a scared little boy. And then Potter had showed up, and managed to orchestrate an escape for all of them. He’d been a prisoner,
“You’re quite the surprise, Draco Malfoy, you know that?”
“I’m sorry,” Draco said, and he had never felt smaller.
Ashworth shook his head, an amused expression on his face.
“Go on then, try it out,” Ollivander urged, and Draco gripped the handle of the wand a little tighter.
“I thought I did, too,” said Harry, quietly. He didn’t want to elaborate, didn’t want the conversation to lead to the war, as it inevitably would. Thankfully, Malfoy didn’t pursue the subject.
At this, he blinked and took a moment to sip at his tea. Harry stayed silent, realising he seemed to need it.
before turning tail and fleeing the dungeon quicker than he came.
The Siberian larkspur then,” he said, and Potter seemed to return from a moment of reverie. He gave an apologetic smile, as if he had interrupted a professor mid-lecture.
“Being a bug of some kind might actually be good, Harry,” chimed in Hermione. “Remember Rita Skeeter?”
“Why don’t you find us a seat and I’ll get our drinks?” he offered. “Red currant rum, wasn’t it?”
“What, inaccurate articles? That’s practically all they do,” said Hermione, disdainfully.
But Potter.
He found himself desperate to ask.
“I never thought I’d say this, but you’re right, Malfoy.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Potter,” he responded, coolly, in contrast to his startled reaction.
It was Potter’s turn to gape, and the anger seemed to sizzle out of him, his shoulders drooping and his whole body seeming to deflate.
“Your fan club won’t care about what you’re teaching, more about who’s doing the teaching.”
“I didn’t expect that, Malfoy,” said Harry, with a sigh. He started to wonder if maybe he should have just tried to fly to Hermione on his own once he had healed.
“You look like you’re miles away,” she said, brown eyes looking right up at him.
“I’s abou’ ‘Arry’s saviour complex,” said Ron, through a full mouth of roast chicken. Hermione looked at him, too surprised by his words to show any sign of disgust at his eating habits.
“Well, there you go,” Hermione said.
He spent some time alone, at Grimmauld Place. Slowly sorted through more old things that needed clearing out. He would sit in Sirius’s room, looking at his posters, at his notes still shoved in the desk drawers.
“Right,” Draco said. “Are you saying you
“Well, Hermione fixed it, really,” said Potter, looking awkward.
However, it was when Slughorn reminded them on which potions were likely to be on their N.E.W.T.s that Draco realized Potter had absolutely no idea how to make any of them. Initially, he thought, well, that’s Potter’s problem, isn’t it? But then he started feeling somewhat guilty. Slughorn favoured Potter, there was no question about it, but even the Saviour of the Wizarding World couldn’t get away with passing a Potions N.E.W.T. without knowing how to draft a simple Pepper-Up.
“When did this happen?” Draco interrogated, though lowering his voice.
written underneath it in black.
“I’m fine,” he replied, offering a slight smile and letting his hand fall onto Draco’s leg.
“I’m sorry, do you have a better suggestion?”
“Draco, are you familiar with the concept of
“Hmm,” hummed Hermione, looking thoughtful. “Or maybe, you just have to let him know who
“Oh! Oh, Harry!” her voice increased in volume in her strange excitement and a few others around the table to see what was going on between them.
They were something like friends now, weren’t they? He supposed it was time he started calling him Draco.
“I mean, about Draco,” said Harry, and it hurt his throat to say his name. He felt like he was trying to swallow a stone.
“No, no,” said Dennis, still a bit slowly. “He’s great at what he does, also a professional. But I’m surprised they didn’t warn you…”
Hermione cleared her throat, loudly.
Draco wasn’t staring at Potter and the Weaslette, he really wasn’t. They just happened to be in his direct line of sight, laughing and smiling and
“A hyacinth,” Draco managed. “Blue means sincerity. Purple mean sorrow for a wrong committed and…and deep regret…and asking for forgiveness.”
The Dark Mark had remained untouched, and all that he had done is add some more scars around it.
“Oh,” Potter said, starting to walk towards the middle of the room, towards Draco. “Why would you think this was his idea?”
Harry furrowed his eyebrows, slightly confused.
“No problem,” said Potter, shooting Jamison a dirty look. “I am still an Auror, after all.”
“Wait, hold on. We don’t know if this risk is
Harry was supremely grateful, and had made sure to already ask McGonagall and Waya for letters of recommendation so that he wouldn’t fall behind. All he had to concentrate on now was studying for his remaining N.E.W.T.s.
“No, I just…” Potter let out a heavy sigh. “I don’t know exactly. I guess I just…missed you.”
“No,” she said, under her breath. “No, no, no. Who are you? Why are you here? You cannot be here! It’s dangerous!”
Malfoy raised an eyebrow, a smirk starting to grow on his face. It wasn’t that same easy, beautiful smile, but it was
He gave a little smirk and shook his head, but his eyebrows were furrowed.
and not just because he had spent two days as a bird.
She planted a loud, smacking kiss on Harry’s cheek and withdrew a notebook and Self-Inking Quill from seemingly out of nowhere, beginning to scribble wildly.
“Guess you’re stuck with Robards, then,” Harry said, grinning slightly when Ron let out another dramatic groan.
He walked at a leisurely pace, far slower than his usual brisk walk. He had been taught to walk with purpose, to always have the destination in mind. His walk showed that he was busy and important and powerful. At least, that’s what Lucius had taught him.
said Pansy, eyebrows shooting up to hide behind her fringe. “Since when do you spend time with Loony Lovegood?”
“Don’t worry about who took him in,” Chang said, seriously. “This was your bust. You guys found him. Good job.”
“Okay,” Harry said, not sure if
“Explain!” demanded Draco. “What do you mean they’re
“You did,” said Potter, sounding a little odd. After a brief pause, he asked, “Was that a Thestral?”
“Please, who would even believe me?”
“Who do you think I am, young man? I don’t go handing out Dreamless Sleep to any student who comes in complaining of nightmares. No, this is a Lullaby Tincture. Previously not very popular, as it was mainly used for children who experienced night terrors, however after the war, it seems everyone has a vial at home.”
“I think I’ve proven I can take on Malfoy in a duel.”
“Yeah, exactly! But you know, even wizards don’t fully understand how Conjuration and Vanishment work, because no one can really explain or prove where Vanished objects go. And even with Conjuration, it isn’t like you’re creating energy out of nowhere, is it? Because you’re using your magic—that is, your
like you’re contributing.”
which in and of itself felt like such a foreign emotion. It wasn’t something he could have ever predicted happening, and he snorted to himself at the thought of his sixth-year self being told this is how he would end up, but it turned out that Harry Potter was rather fond of Draco Malfoy.
“Bloody hell,” he said, leaning back in his chair. “An Animagus. Alright. So, what is it? You can’t transform back?”
Draco stretched out in his bed and sat up, feeling warm. He allowed himself a minute to wake up fully and get his brain working properly before drawing his bedcurtains and hopping out of bed. He washed up and dressed quickly, finding himself excited to get to breakfast. He supposed it was simply a force of habit, it was as if his body knew it was Christmas Day and started preparing him for it.
And that, more than anything, made him feel like a failure. Was he now so pathetic that even Malfoy was feeling bad for him? Was he truly so incapable that he had to be treated so delicately, like he might explode at any minute?
“My friend, Violet, takes Muggle Studies,” he said, “and she was telling me about how Muggles often intuitively recognize signs of magic, even if they don’t necessarily understand that it’s magic they’re recognizing. It’s something the Wizard-Muggle Relations office is constantly trying to better understand. So I thought, instead of magical creatures and artefacts, would it be possible to use cores that have magical qualities but are visible and accessible to Muggles as well?”
He sat at his desk to find all the same documents from yesterday and the day before sitting in his tray. He sighed, and set to work filing them for the third time. As he was filing, he wondered why he was bothering. How long was this going to go on? And what
“And do you still think that he’s likely to see the newspaper?”
He looked at the mess of parchment and textbooks strewn across the table in front of them. Granger let out a breath sounding partially like a laugh and partially a sigh.
Hermione’s expression darkened at Harry’s words.
“I—yeah, I do. I figure…war’s over. Time to turn over a new leaf, or page, or whatever the Headmistress is always saying.”
moodboard is Violet!
“What do you mean?” Neville asked.
it had been since someone had touched him like this, with tenderness, with care, with
rather foul, but Draco was far more focused on what this story meant for the Oath.
Potter looked towards the dummies in the corner and shook his head.
Draco watched them from behind the potted plant. It was a force of habit, he supposed, watching Potter. A skill he had finely honed during his Hogwarts years that he now seemed unable to just dismiss.
in his stomach, something warm and painful, an ache that buried inside him and seemed to take root.
“Are we still quitting our jobs today?” Harry asked.
“Death Eater clean-up? Again?” Harry asked, incredulous. “Who’s even left?”
“Oh?” Draco raised his eyebrows, tearing his eyes from the pitch to look at Potter sceptically. “Then why aren’t you a snake?”
“Is…is he gone?” Claudia spoke up, looking rather frightened. Potter managed a smile for her.
Half an hour later, Draco felt much more like himself, stomach full, and faintly buzzed from the sweet Daisywine with which Daphne kept refilling his glass. The dinner table was not as full as usual, as both Laurel and Cordelia were absent, having to work, however they were all as loud and chatty as ever.
“Harper’s always been a bloody idiot,” Draco muttered, looking put out.
Potter smiled at him, and Draco was suddenly struck by the thought,
Harry tried to imagine Malfoy making candied walnuts, but it was a difficult thing to picture.
it, but—”
Draco felt as the words hit him, as though they were jabs to the gut. His mind was still fighting the horrendous thoughts pounding against that locked door, but it was a losing battle, and they were beginning to squeeze under the cracks and through the keyhole.
“Who else do you want in the house with me?”
“She’s rather eccentric, and more than a little bit odd, but I don’t think she’s crazy, no.”
Draco didn’t know what he was thinking, agreeing to meet Potter on the same day as one of Violet and Daphne’s Slytherin dinners. It was like his brain had stuttered to a halt the moment he had opened that letter to find Potter’s awful chicken-scratch handwriting.
Another silence followed Potter’s words, this one stilted and awkward.
informally known as Silver Tongue Tonic. A favourite of politicians and speech-makers, it serves to make its drinker more persuasive and articulate. The instructions are on page eighty-seven of your textbooks. Off you go!”
“Ollivander has been incredibly gracious and forgiving of my many transgressions, and he has been an excellent mentor in the field.”
“Are they…are they like the flowers in the common room?” Potter asked.
“That’s nice, Harry,” Hermione said, from beside him, giving him a smile before returning her gaze to the book in her lap. It made sense that this wasn’t exactly news to her; he had had most of his Malfoy-themed conversations with her, and she was far quicker and picking up things than he was, so she had probably sussed out everything he just did months ago.
“She’s got a hell of an arm, I’ll tell you that.”
. He was slowly realising that he had no interest in girls and much preferred boys, but he refused to acknowledge that his hatred of Potter had anything at all to do with that, even though the back of his brain kept pushing that conclusion at him. He hated how anxious he felt about the third task, how anxious he felt about Potter, and he hated Potter even more for giving him that feeling. When Potter had returned, crying and bleeding and clutching Diggory’s lifeless body, Draco had felt a sharp, twisting pain in his gut, followed by a horrific sense of relief that accompanied the realisation that it wasn’t
Potter quickly followed up with an
But, of course, Potter had to ruin this.
Ron snorted at this, and Harry couldn’t help but smile as well.
“Like stepping into a fireplace sounds safe,” Laurel would always say, rolling her eyes.
“Hello, Potter,” said Malfoy, looking very much like he was being forced to be there. “May I come in?”
“I came to support my House team,” Harry said with a smile, keeping it neutral, but adding, “Ginny’s a fantastic player, one of the best I’ve seen.”
“Claudia? Claudia, wake up!”
Draco allowed himself a smirk.
When the Great Hall eventually started to applaud, he joined in, not wanting to seem disinterested or—Merlin forbid—spiteful. His eyes swept over the Hall, observing other people’s reactions, until they stopped dead at the Gryffindor table, where none other than Harry Potter, the Saviour of the Wizarding World himself, sat.
“Stay positive, Harry,” she insisted. “You’re doing everything right, try again.”
Without waiting for a reply, Draco grabbed his bag and fled the room.
Maybe he should have gone to pub night after all. He wasn’t exactly in the most sociable mood, but maybe it would be a good distraction. He could talk to Ginny about her most recent Quidditch match, or Neville about his work with Professor Sprout, or just listen along to Seamus and Ron as they exaggerated the heroics of their latest arrest.
“I watch you too, you know,” he said, quietly. “Notice things.”
Finchley’s thin eyebrows rose on his forehead. Draco had never talked back to him before.
Strange as it was, Rhiannon’s hair was one of the things that first endeared her to Harry. After he had finished at Hogwarts, he had followed through on his promise to Hermione and found himself a Mind Healer, an older man by the name of Irving Locke. He had worked with him somewhat half-heartedly for about six months before deciding he didn’t feel comfortable and wasn’t making the progress he was expecting. He had been ready to give up entirely and mope about it for a while, but Hermione would have none of that. She had found Rhiannon Shields, a Mind Healer who specialized in trauma recovery. Apparently she was a favourite for people who needed help after the war.
the fact that he was sure you were going to be one of his apprentices, Harry.”
Violet and Daphne went around the table, serving everyone and offering drinks, and Blaise began chatting about his most recent trip to Spain and Draco sat back in his seat, observing his friends and feeling glad he had come.
“No wonder she got all those offers, right?”
“Muggle-borns,” said Draco, listlessly.
“What do you mean?”
“Well-spotted, Potter. You’ll make for an excellent Auror.”
Ron looked from Ginny to Harry, as if worried that he was going to give the wrong answer.
Draco sputtered. “What? You can’t just
“It’s a pureblood thing,” Theo explained, waving his hand. “Not even all the families do it anymore, but some are sticklers for tradition and it’s how things were done in their day.”
idea, Harry!” Ashworth exclaimed. “He’ll have to work around his apprenticeship, of course, but Mr Malfoy is an incredibly dedicated student from what I’ve seen, so I’m sure that won’t be a problem. How often do you plan to meet?”
As soon as the words left his mouth, he wished he could take them back. He had forgotten that, of course, it wasn’t like that anymore. None of the last few Christmases had followed their old traditions.
“Definitely for a nefarious purpose. It’s all a plot, Potter, I lured you here so that I could poison you with laced pumpkin juice.”
“Do you think it’s changed since then?”
“Are you sure, mate?” Ron asked, his head floating in Harry’s fireplace.
“Of course, the Saviour of the Wizarding World never gets jealous,” he said, putting on a pompous tone. “No common man could
“You’re too kind, sir,” Draco said, feeling that same sort of hollowness he’d felt at Luna and Violet’s words. Ollivander regarded him.
He arrived at work exactly six minutes early.
“You should! We could go by the Three Broomsticks for a warm drink. It’s been ages since I’ve had a Butterbeer,” suggested Violet. Daphne considered this and then smiled.
Potter seemed to realise that this was difficult for Draco, so he waited patiently for Draco to find the words. What came out wasn’t exactly what Draco had intended.
“If you call me your soulmate, I’m getting up and leaving right now.”
“Don’t be,” Ollivander said, gently. “I wouldn’t have agreed to take you on if I didn’t believe in your abilities and in your talent. You’re a bright young man, Mr Malfoy. You’ve made some bad decisions in your life, no question,” –Draco felt a coldness spike at his gut at these words—“but I believe strongly in man’s tremendous capability for change.”
“What?” Potter said, distractedly, chewing on his bottom lip in worry as Ravenclaw scored another goal. “Oh, blimey, no. Hogwarts wouldn’t hire me right out of an apprenticeship, Chosen One be damned. Ashworth recommended I start at local day schools, maybe even magical preparatory schools for children under eleven.”
was walking straight for the Forest with such conviction?
“What?” Harry asked. “Am I doing something wrong?”
Draco took him into the shower, running his hands over Potter’s skin, softly cleaning the blood off of his face. Potter was silent, but his eyes closed as Draco washed his hair, massaging his scalp. Draco spent about half an hour in the shower, washing the night off of Potter, and then wrapped him up in a towel warmed by a gentle Warming Charm. Potter was still wordless, but he had stopped shaking and looked significantly less pale, so Draco’s fear had slightly abated. Once they were side by side under Draco’s blankets, Potter finally met Draco’s eyes.
Malfoy looked thin and worn. His pale face seemed sharper than Harry remembered, his cheekbones high and pronounced. He wore a simple black cloak that seemed to hang heavily on his slim frame. His hair, much unlike the slicked back style he sported during their Hogwarts days, was somewhat choppy, as though he had spelled it cut himself. Harry couldn’t help but think it looked far better this way.
“She followed the Carrows’ instruction a little too easily,” Blaise said. Unlike Draco, Blaise had spent their official seventh year in Hogwarts along with Pansy. “Not like…Crabbe,” he paused before continuing, “or Goyle, mind you. Not enthusiastically. She didn’t
Potter’s eyes remained on him for a moment, and then followed him down the stairway.
“What is what, exactly? I can’t think he’s attractive?”
“I have the patience of a saint,” Violet said, looking completely serious. Draco turned to scowl at her, and she responded with an angelic smile.
Potter blinked at him, then a shadow crossed his face. His lips tightened and he nodded.
“I know it’s early,” said Will at one point. “And maybe a bit forward, but would you like to come back to mine?”
Harry was eternally grateful to Madam Pomfrey. He vowed to never doubt her abilities again, as he was finally sleeping through the night again, and actually feeling relatively well-rested when he woke in the mornings.
“What do you think?” she snapped at him, in a much less patient tone than she’d just used. “She was hexed.”
“Thanks for agreeing to meet with me,” Harry finally said, fighting the urge to wince at how stilted he sounded.

“To Harry,” she said. “Happy birthday!”
It all happened very fast. One second, Potter was looking at Draco with a set expression, the next there were long slashes down his arm, blood flowing like a river and Potter’s legs began to shake.
“Why are you asking me this, Potter?” he hissed. Harry didn’t really have a good answer to this.
“Luna,” improvised Draco, saying the first name that came to mind. “She works next door.”
“Right,” he said. “So I met with Ashworth…”
Ron watched her go with a fond smile.
“Yes, exactly. It was part of a longer program of space exploration the Americans were doing. Apollo 11 is the one that accomplished the mission. Three astronauts—that’s the name for the people who go to space in those machines—were in the crew. So the machine was launched into space by a rocket—which is this other machine that deploys it and projects it forward. I think it took them about three or four days until they landed on the moon. And then the astronaut who was first to set food on the moon was called Neil Armstrong.”
Without warning, out of nowhere, Draco’s mind supplied a face, a skinny face, with sharp cheekbones and bright, shining green eyes. Draco forced the thought away, not daring to even think the name that was barrelling itself through his brain nonetheless.
“Yeah,” Harry replied, with a shrug. Strangely enough, it was true, as Malfoy hadn’t said anything obnoxious or insulting thus far, which Harry found incredibly out of character.
talk about him, Draco wondered what Potter would say. He hated that he wondered. He hated that he desperately wanted to know what Potter thought of him. For long enough now, he’d been able to chase away such thoughts by telling himself that Potter
Harry’s eyes widened and he seemed to only hesitate for a moment before nodding. Draco, trying his best not to tremble, gripped Harry’s t-shirt and leaned forward, his eyes fluttering closed.
“Well, I was thinking about that and…it’s obviously silly to think about marriage at this age anyway, but just…
The wandmaker’s wide grin had faltered a little, but it quickly returned and he’d said, excitedly, “I know just the wand!”
“The war’s over. No more fighting. Enough,” he said, and Finnigan appeared to deflate a little.
“What?” he asked. “Why?”
“Then what are you studying?”
Ginny had never commented on Harry’s friendship with Draco, not once. Harry had been grateful for this, because he had always suspected that Ginny’s feelings about the entire Malfoy family hadn’t changed at all over the year.
“Why do you still care so much about this pureblood nonsense?” Potter asked, sounding disdainful.
the Prophet declared in bold letters, the subtitle reading:
you, you thanking me. It’s all a bit mental, isn’t it?”
Well. Most of his skin, that is.
Draco stared at her. Without a doubt, Violet Foxblade had to be the strangest person Draco had ever met. A Slytherin, who came from an old pureblood family, who had remained quiet and invisible for most of her Hogwarts career, who had fought
“She went to school with us,” Violet provided, hesitantly. “She was…”
“It’s okay, Daphne,” Ella said, still in that quiet voice that Draco had to almost strain to hear. “It’s a couple of guys in my year. And some from sixth year, I think.”
“…and peaches, and the leather of a Quaffle,” girl-Weasley was saying, leaning forward in her seat next to Luna, who said nothing more than “it smells like friends and stars and happiness,” when it was her turn to speak.
better off as friends and he was glad they had been able to remain as such. Besides, she seemed to be happy with Heidi—aside from this new Quidditch conflict.
“You’re welcome, Malfoy.”
Potter also didn’t seem to like being touched. He avoided handshakes, preferring a curt nod or even a wave. He ducked away when fans tried to hug him, and flinched at casual physical gestures, like being clapped on the back by Robards after closing a case, or a comforting squeeze on the shoulder by a colleague after a rough day. Draco could understand it, he himself didn’t much like being manhandled by strangers or acquaintances, and he supposed that being chased by overeager fans the way Potter was would only make one more averse to that sort of thing.
“Friendly?” Ron breathed, sounding incredulous. “
Pansy grinned widely, clearly noticing it as well.
“If we follow the chain of allegiance of the Elder Wand, we see that young Mr Potter won it from you with a similar subtle method, a Disarming spell or something of that nature, causing no significant harm to you. The Elder Wand, not being especially loyal, thus transferred allegiance to him. However, hawthorn is not a wood that makes for easily-won wands, as you well know. When Mr Potter gained control and possession of your wand, there was a shifting of allegiances—of that, there is no doubt. Whether that allegiance was of
“I’m sure you would,” he said. “And I love you for it. But it smells delicious, and I’m certain Daphne’s got something up her sleeve for dessert. Come, let’s eat.”
“Woah, that’s impressive.”
of him.
“Wait, what is this?” said Potter. Draco looked down at where Potter’s gaze was directed, at the bottom of the golden frame Claudia’s portrait lay in. Something was leaking out from the bottom of it, something that looked like…
Casting an eye at the rest of the ingredients on the table, he added, “You can take the morning dew back. It doesn’t need to be added for another week.”
“How are you feeling?” Ollivander asked him, a small smile on his face.
“Well, my dear boy, that seems to be irrelevant here, as this isn’t actually redwood.”
Draco felt a shiver down his spine and his arms that he knew the gentle warm spring weather wasn’t causing. He didn’t know why he had come up here anyway. It was a stupid idea, one he hadn’t thought through at all.
“Are you hearing their thoughts?” she asked, and Harry gave a short nods. “And you’re…feeling something?”
Harry felt his feet come to a complete halt. He was coming dangerously close to a full anxiety attack in the middle of the south side of Diagon Alley. Spotting some sort of café to his right, he decided to duck in and have a tea to calm down before going on to Ollivanders. He swallowed heavily and entered the café, berating himself for his lack of Gryffindor courage. The door let out a gentle sort of chime as it closed behind him and Harry flinched at the sound.

Malfoy!’” He spat the last one, unable to keep his blood from boiling, because that had been the comment that had finally pushed him too far and caused him to swing a punch at Potter’s stupid face.
Perhaps that was part of the reason Draco had been so much more willing to listen to differing opinions on Muggles and Muggleborns this year than years prior. His entire image and perception of his father had been shattered and with it had gone the confidence in all that he had taught him.
Harry had stayed, and was now watching Ginny fly, deftly weaving through other players with the Quaffle tucked under her arm. It was odd how little he was thinking about Quidditch this year. He thought he’d miss it much more, but McGonagall had been right at the start of year feast when she’d said their N.E.W.T. work and apprenticeships would keep them quite busy.
“Merlin, and I know you have no reason to give a damn, but you’re the only person who actually
He did find Draco’s side-line commentary to be highly amusing though, and while he didn’t dare say it, it sort of reminded him of Ron’s.
Harry didn’t want to admit that yes, he had sort of expected that.
Hermione looked like she was going to say something more, but was interrupted by the loud sound of the bricks of the entrance to the common room opening. Dean and Seamus walked through, followed closely by an interested-looking Luna and a grinning Ginny.
“Draco!” Daphne was the first to greet him, enveloping him in a hug before he could even get a proper look at her. She pulled back slightly, her hands holding onto his forearms and looked at him with a caring expression, her blue eyes filled with concern.
Her use of the word
“Pansy, love,” he said, relieved that his voice didn’t sound nearly as shaky as his stomach felt. “I’m going to have to run. I have a prior commitment.”
“Er, not exactly,” said Potter, looking from Draco back to her. “Mal-Draco, can you explain?”
~I have returned from the depths~
Harry smirked at the thought. He stood, trying to shake off as much dirt as he could before going back inside, not wanting to be scolded for tracking dirt into the house again.
“Why?” he asked.
“I…I didn’t realise I was doing that.”
“Hello, love,” Draco greeted her with a warm smile. Harry felt his stomach lurch, unwittingly imagining Draco regarding him with that warmth, calling him ‘love’…
Potter sighed, falling into a chair. Draco pulled another around and sat as well.
magic is madly impressive, I think.”
“I just mean,” Potter continued, not seeming to realize the struggle Draco was going through right beside him. “I can’t imagine what I would—what was going through your head?”
He told them about their meeting, about how Ashworth helped him figure out that the aspect of the Auror job that was appealing to him was the opportunity to help people, and how teaching was another way of doing that that Harry felt more comfortable with and excited about. When he finished, Hermione’s eyes were sparkling.
I also wanted to mention, I've been debating it in my head for a while, but I've finally decided and there will be a sequel. Don't worry, I won't leave this unfinished, but I've sort of fallen in love with this universe and the characters and their development and I want to tell more of their stories, so yes, when this story ends, a follow-up is on its way.
Fred’s death had hit each member of the Weasley family in a different way. George, of course, took it the hardest. He’d spent practically the whole summer locked up in his and Fred’s room, barely coming out at all, not even for meals. He’d hardly spoken, and when he had, it was in a monotone that Harry wouldn’t have even recognized as his voice.
What came out of his mouth was the word, “grateful,” and he found it was very true. Ollivander’s silvery eyes softened slightly.
Ella’s head shot up at the sound of her name and Draco felt his stomach churn. The scar she had, from the corner of her mouth up to the middle of her right cheek hadn’t ever gone away, merely faded into a pinkish white even paler than Ella’s skin.
“You want to be touched,” Draco phrased it as a statement, but Harry nodded.
“Absolutely not, she’s with Potter and Weasley,” Draco said, stubbornly. Violet and Daphne shared exasperated looks that Draco chose to ignore.
Ginny just gave him a look.
“Ginny!” Ron exclaimed. “What are you doing here?”
Potter’s smirk simply grew wider.
If he

in 2001, after their last seeker retired. It was a fun job and suited Harry better than working for the Aurors. Escapism might not be a particularly healthy coping method for dealing with war trauma, but it was working better for him than murder investigations and hunting down potions smugglers. Harry enjoyed the camaraderie of team sport and the physical nature of the work was rewarding. He wasn’t keen on the fame aspect, but at this point it was impossible to be more famous than he already was, so playing professional quidditch didn’t make things any worse.
“But you’ve dated loads of people! The press never shut up about whoever it is you’re supposedly shacked up with. You mean to tell me they’ve been fibbing all this time? How positively typical. So, tell me, why did you never have sex with your exes? You can’t possibly have been short of offers.”
“I’m not sure I follow you, exactly.”
Draco clung to Harry for a minute then pulled back slightly, brushing his palms lightly over Harry’s biceps. Harry kissed his forehead, curled his fingers into Draco’s dressing gown, pulling it looser.
“Lier. You were laughing internally just now. I saw you forcibly stop yourself, don’t kid me you weren’t.”
possible if you were going to any kind of classical music event.
Harry laughed, “Did Lucius write the MoM formal events dress code?”
“I think if I was asexual I would just er... not want to have sex? As in, just not be interested in the idea? But it’s not that, that’s not the way I feel. I really want to have sex, but only if it’s with someone I feel comfortable with, who I find sexually attractive. And it’s just hard, you know? Because the people I find attractive are always people I know really well, friends really, and so there’s always so much at stake if something goes wrong and I don’t – I just don’t know…”
“Language, Potter, muggles present. And don’t be a cheapskate, it’s undignified. Especially for someone who is currently wearing white tie and didn’t even buy the programmes in the first place. Here, take one. The synopsis is on page six, as I have absolutely no doubt you did not take the time to look one up before coming.”
“I bought it to wear to Ministry events, when they insist on hauling me in as their favourite show-pony to impress dignitaries and the general public.”
“Er… yes? I think it would be a good idea, Draco. It seemed to be important to you a few minutes ago. I promise not to laugh, or shame you, or anything.”
“Oh, Harry,” said Draco with a long-suffering look, “what would you do without me? The synopsis is a summary of the plot. It’s a good idea to read it before the opera starts, so you know what’s going on. You almost still have time now, especially if you read the second half during the interval.”
“I know,” said Harry, “I trust you.” He wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist and apparated them to his room.
“Do you still want to experiment with me? You know, with touching and sex stuff and all that?”

) and hopefully more sexy experimenting, providing both of them were still keen on the day. This date, in the broader scheme of things, shouldn’t have been scary. Harry was fairly sure he had planned something Draco would love, and it involved flying and quidditch, both of which Harry enjoyed and was good at. But it would be his last date with Draco under the terms of the
“I want to try and suck you,” Harry murmured. “But I’m worried I won’t be very good. I can’t open my mouth well, my temporomandibular joint’s fucked.”
“I’m not saying that I’m a sex God! My name isn’t even in the title!”
“I think it would be good to… er… what I meant to say is… I’d like to establish… to, er, discuss as it were, what exactly we are to each other.”
“I want… Could we…” Harry stumbled, not sure how to name what he wanted.
“Really? You really want to…?”
“Stay,” he said, quickly. He didn’t want Draco to sound like that, like he was terrified and broken. “Please stay. It’s alright, well… it wasn’t, but… I just got a fright. You didn’t do anything wrong, it’s understandable you would think… I mean, that did seem to be where it was going…”
“I mean, with the kissing and cock touching and everything. I know you said it was all no strings attached…”
The fucking opera. Of course, Draco sodding Malfoy thought that
“Come?”
“Amazing. Do you want to go for a drink? There was some kind of bar in the foyer.”
Harry pulled himself gently off Draco’s lap, so he was sitting beside him, hands shaking, not sure what to say.
“So,” said Harry nervously, “that’s all the charity dates done then.”
“It’s a
“I have proof-readers, ok!” said Draco, eyes glinting and combative.
Draco made an odd, strangled choking noise.
“Then yeah, metaphorically, I guess I did.”
“Would you like a cup of tea?” He asked. This was another useful technique to use when confronted by crying people.
“Can I?”
“No, no. I insist on taking the credit for that. It was entirely my doing and I won’t hear otherwise.”
“But I could try a hand job with some mouth involvement. Would that be alright?”
“Harry, there’s something I should probably tell you.”
. It’s not even fiction. You do understand the concept of fiction and non-fiction, right, Potter? Missed that one in primary school? I can explain it again for you, if by chance you weren’t paying attention in the five years in which it was covered.”
Harry dropped his bag on Draco’s white-tiled kitchen floor and pulled the man himself into a loose embrace. Draco hummed and leaned into the touch as Harry buried his face into the crook of Draco’s neck, kissing the thin skin there open-mouthed, the vibration of Draco’s moans under his lips. Draco tasted sweat-salty, musky, and Draco-scented. No cologne this time. Harry didn’t miss it.
was a good idea for a second date. Harry didn’t even know what one wore to the muggle opera and it wasn’t like he had a huge selection of people to ask: Hermione’s parents were Classic Rock snobs and they were the only muggle adults Harry had any real connection with anymore. In the end he decided on the white waistcoat and black tails that he wore to formal events at the Ministry, by which point he was running late for Draco’s ridiculously early meeting time: half an hour before the curtains raised was just over the top.

“You think a whole galleon for a programme isn’t too bad?! On top of the ticket price?”
“Better than the saviour of the wizarding world?”
As Harry came down, he was vaguely aware of Draco kissing his forehead and casting cleaning charms on him and the bedclothes. When Draco was done, he lay down again next to Harry and Harry turned to him, winding his arms around Draco, pulling him close.
fan attending matches. Draco’s reverence left him speechless – a shocking first – so Harry struck up a conversation with Birch about his days playing in the league and for England, then hinted heavily that Draco might appreciate an autograph. After Birch and Davidson had signed every item Draco owned and had to hand, as well as some random napkins he had filched from the club, they headed out to the pitch.
Harry looked at him, wanting to ask why Draco had thought about this at all.
Before Ron or Hermione could mention anything related to Draco, Harry quickly answered, “Easter.”
A lot of things may have changed this year, but by no means were Draco and Potter going to become best friends.
“Yes,” said Nathaniel, a soft smile crossing his lips. “I would like that.”
“Who is she?” Draco asked, finding that his voice had lowered to match hers.
“I want to believe we are better than this,” McGonagall went on. “And I will not have my students tormenting each other in this castle. We have seen enough harm, we have seen enough pain. It’s time to move on. We should be helping each other heal our wounds, not creating new ones.”
“Who’s instructing you?”
“Visiting you, dear brother, what’s it look like?” Ginny said, with just the slightest note of sarcasm in her voice.
“No, you knobhead. As in Neil Armstrong, the Muggle astronaut who walked on the moon.”
Ron and Hermione just looked at him, shock and worry over their faces.
“Is her portrait disintegrating?” Potter demanded. “Is this some sort of fail-safe? Malfoy!”
“Do I have a type?” he asked her at breakfast, causing her to stop dead in the middle of buttering her toast. She furrowed her eyebrows at him for a moment and then resumed her buttering.
“It can’t be more than three by three feet,” he said. “We won’t be able to sit.”
Smith barked out a laugh.
Happy to hear something familiar, Draco nodded.
Harry hesitated. He wanted to answer honestly, about the new Gryffindor Keeper—Simone Wexler, a girl in the same year as Ginny and a formidable force—but he feared his answer would be misconstrued, and the next article in the Daily Prophet would be about Harry dating his way through the Gryffindor Quidditch team.
“Brilliant,” Draco said, freshly motivated with new steps to take. “Thank you, Granger.”
“That’s easy for you to say,” scowled Harry. Surprising him yet again, Draco snorted.
Recently, she’d told him about the Great Muggle Wars. He’d heard about them before, but only in passing. He remembered a section in his old Botany book that had mentioned flowers as symbols of death and remembrance in reference to them.
“Martin was only a reserve Quidditch player,” Harry mumbled, knowing it was a weak defence before the words even left his mouth. Sure enough, Ron let out a snicker of triumph.
thought Draco. And that was
The first day, he had simply sat at an outdoor café, ordered a coffee, and watched. It wasn’t the first time he had gone into the Muggle world by any means, but he had never really stuck around, always in a hurry to return back to what was safe and comfortable.
but rather of their life. You know, there is a popular Mexican cultural event where they gather to rejoice the lives of their departed loved ones. Day of the Dead, it’s called. It’s quite lovely, in fact. Both wizards and Muggles celebrate it.”
A small clattering noise brought Draco’s attention back to his own table and he looked down to see his absurdly long wand had fallen out of his pocket again. Cursing, he bent to fetch it and gave it a nasty look.
Harry opened his mouth to answer but was interrupted by a cup of tea and a plate sliding in front of him. He looked up to thank Ella, but found a different woman serving them.
“Master Ollivander is gone, sir, he is dead!”
“I—yeah, I trust you.”
“Not really,” he replied, honestly.
“What are you doing? Do not get near me with all of that dirt on your hands,” Draco warned, holding up a hand.
Draco was rather alarmed to see the elf’s eyes were large and red and she was practically wailing.
On Christmas morning, Draco woke up with his chest feeling much lighter than it had in months. He had spent the previous night wrapping his mother’s gifts before sending them off, along with a letter, with Elpis. The eagle owl had seemed quite happy to have something to deliver and Draco felt another little pinch of guilt. Elpis used to be rather busy, bringing Draco gifts or letters from his mother on an almost daily basis, and taking his replies back. This year had been different. Narcissa had been keeping herself busy with the great purging of the Manor, so Draco had only received a handful of letters since the beginning of term. Elpis still regularly visited Draco in the mornings when mail arrived, even if she wasn’t bringing him anything.
“Yeah, but it’s all talk. I was telling Ron earlier, all Robards wants is to retire and the Ministry won’t let him, while
Harry blinked at him.
“Yes,” he snapped. “You can manage labelling the cauldron with our names, can’t you? Wonderful.”
Draco had agonized over that initially, but Ollivander had reassured him that his work would speak for itself, and he wouldn’t have to worry about customer disloyalty. Now, only in his second year, he had already earned his place at Ollivander’s in society’s eyes, as well as in Ollivander’s himself. Pre-Hogwarts season certainly proved he didn’t have to worry about customers running to the competition. In fact, he wouldn’t even complain if a few more decided Czech wands were more their style.
Draco sneered quickly, covering up his initial surprise.
“There isn’t much to say,” Harry shrugged. “Umbridge refused to teach us properly and Voldemort was back, so we had to do something.”
When he looked up, he found Granger, Weasley, and Potter all staring at him. Granger was still smiling slightly, while Weasley looked like someone had clubbed him in the head. Potter had an infuriatingly unreadable expression on his face, his bright green eyes boring into Draco as if wanting to unravel him like a ribbon.
“See you in Potions,” Draco added, a small smile tugging at the corner of his lips.
Harry stayed rooted to the ground, looking at Malfoy, trying to figure him out. Malfoy scowled at him.
Potter stared at him for a long moment.
“I don’t think we should—” he started in a low tone, and then Rosmerta’s face turned to them. Draco felt his body go rigid, his stomach lurching uncomfortably. Theo looked from him to Rosmerta, as the two stared at each other, and his face changed as realization dawned on him.
Harry didn’t want to think about this right now. He normally felt rather capable of communicating his feelings, but sitting down with a stranger and unloading everything that was weighing him down sounded like a daunting process. He wouldn’t even be able to find someone unbiased. He
“Don’t be dramatic.”
“Thanks,” Harry said, genuinely. “I’ll check it out.”
“What about it?” Potter’s voice had gone from tentative to downright suspicious. Draco wasn’t sure whether to feel insulted that Potter was immediately suspicious of him, however it further supported his decision to tell the truth. This was a display of faith, he was showing Potter that he trusted him enough to reveal this secret and hopefully proving that he didn’t have anything malicious to hide.
Draco shrugged.
“You did what?” she asked, perhaps thinking she had misheard him.
“Been watching me, have you, Potter?” he asked.
“What is going
“High expectations aren’t a
Waya looked quite happy with her, offering her a smile before looking towards Malfoy and the other girl. They looked at each other; both had guarded expressions, but they seemed to be communicating with their eyes. Harry desperately wanted to know what was being said—or, more accurately, not said.

like one. He still got to lie down in a warm bed at night, even if he didn’t actually sleep when in it. He was not innocent; he had done sickening things during the war.
Draco sighed quietly to himself. He started to wonder about Slytherins from younger years, would they want to come back? He supposed many of them would have no choice, but he was sure that at least some parents would choose to send their Slytherins to Beauxbatons or Durmstrang. He wouldn’t blame them. He did not expect any returning Slytherins to be met with welcoming arms, even those who didn’t bear the shame of being related to a Death Eater.
“Yes.”
sorry about the shabby photoshop quality of the tattoo, I am not exactly a photoshop wizard.
“That’s what they think, at least,” Harry replied. “And that the Curse Breakers and Aurors aren’t investigating it.”
Draco didn’t really know why Potter cared what he thought, since he was suggesting it for
“You see this?” he said, as Ella and Daphne stared at the scarred Dark Mark. “I am the only Marked person in this castle. I am responsible, not you nor any other Slytherin. Next time, you tell them that if they’re angry about the war, they can take it up with me.”
Draco looked surprised again for a split-second, before the mask settled back on his face.
“Yes, of course, what is it?” she asked, breathless in her enthusiasm.
chapter six, a little short but hope you like it nonetheless!
“Oh well,” said Draco, entering the room more fully, and starting to pull at the laces of his Quidditch leathers. “Don’t worry, you probably won’t have to see me again. Our lives don’t cross paths much these days.”
“Lots of people for an N.E.W.T. level class, don’t you think?” Ron said, voicing Harry’s thoughts aloud.
Pansy smirked.
“Says you, of all people.”
“Yes, well, you don’t
“How?” Potter breathed.
She was the one to suggest Quidditch to Harry in the first place, not that he hadn’t thought of it before.
Harry laughed.
Eyeing his wand with another contemptuous look, he decided there was only one way to stop the slew of stress-inducing questions, so he fetched his outer robes from where he had hung them up by the compartment door, fished in the pockets to find the vial he was looking for, and quickly swallowed down some Dreamless Sleep.
“They don’t like to pick right out of Hogwarts. They usually wait until other teams have picked up the newbies, and then trade players once they see where the real talent lies.”
Before any of them could say anything else, Draco returned to his table to grab his tray, and quickly walked away.
Their little pity party was interrupted when Hermione appeared, plopping herself down across the table from them.
“What? What is it?”
“We’re studying wand ownership, and the case of the hawthorn wand was brought up. You don’t have to give it back to me, I just need to test it. You can be there while I do, if you wish.”
“Alright, love, you go and get some rest. I’m going to Ollivander’s.”
“Yeah,” Neville continued talking in that easy tone. “He’s a bit weird, but he’s a good guy. He’s great at Herbology, too.”
“Hey,” he said, taking off his shoes by the door, and wiping the sweat from his forehead with his shirt. Draco looked up from his paperwork.
“Ah, yes. How could I forget, having roomed with Pansy Parkinson for seven long years?”
“I can’t be sure,” he said. “It’s just a feeling.”
There was yet another long moment of silence and then Potter broke it with a sudden and random subject change.
“And?”
“Well. Night, Draco,” said Potter, and then he bounded up the left-side staircase and disappeared from sight.
“I—” before Potter could get more than a word out, an agonizingly loud screeching sound caused both of them to jump, Draco’s hand immediately shooting back to pull out his wand. The wall in front of Draco seemed to clear, a portrait-sized hole appearing, bringing with it the light from the room they had just been in.
“Tell me, Potter,
“I don’t understand why they chose marigold for the Hufflepuffs,” he said, firmly. “Surely a clearer choice would be the sunflower, happiness and good fortune and all that Hufflepuff drivel. Or even a black-eyed Susan, representative of the justice Hufflepuffs are apparently
“No time to waste, Potter. Less than ten minutes.”
Potter shrugged.
“Not really. Just making some changes with my work schedule that have me thinking a lot lately.”
“How did it work for you?” Draco continued, and Harry was briefly distracted by how brightly his eyes seemed to be shining.
“He’s quite busy, as well,” Harry said, thinking of how exhausted Ron was every time he saw him. “We still see each other though; we’re getting lunch today, actually.”
“No!” cried Harry, shaking his head quickly. “It’s not brill! It’s a disaster! I’m not prepared!”
“Oh, hush, you,” said Hermione, flushing slightly.
The thing was—he
and any breaches of conduct will be met with a swift ban.”
As he did so, his eyes fell directly upon Harry. He seemed to freeze at the sight of him, the corners of his lips tightening into a slight frown.
“I suppose,” said Harry. He had felt awkward and uncomfortable having his photograph taken—he always did—but he had to admit Dennis Creevey had done a good job. Parvati had dressed him in an elegant yet simple pair of dark green robes and hadn’t bothered to even try to tame his mess of hair, instead letting it be. He looked like himself, and his discomfort didn’t seem to come through as such in the photograph. Instead, he seemed to look at the camera with an intense expression, reaching up to scratch at it stubble or run a hand through his untidy hair.
“May I see your wand?”
“You think that’s what I’m nervous about?” asked Harry, completely forgetting to look at Dennis and turning his head to look up at Draco.
“Come closer and take a look,” Ollivander said, holding out the wand for Draco to see better. “Let this be your first lesson. You see the warm, reddish-brown tone? Feel how tough and durable it is? This is a hardwood. Redwood trees are softwoods, and their colour is a much richer, deeper red. Take a closer look at this. You’re familiar with the woods, you said, can you tell what this is?”
“How about Armstrong?” he said, looking down at the Thestral in his lap. The animal nudged his knee with his snout, and opened its eyes long enough to blink slowly at him. Draco smiled, pleased.
“I did,” he said. “I would wager that Daphne did as well.”
“No!” Draco shouted, but he didn’t know
“I’m not an Auror anymore,” he said, unable to break the intense eye contact the two men were sharing. “I quit months ago.”
things when…when you have the…the subconscious Legilimency or whatever?”
“Really?”
“Do you…I can…I mean, well. I’ve been taking Lullaby Tincture. Slughorn lets me use the Potions classroom for extra brewing practice.”
Potter looked pale, taken aback and looking somewhat as if he had just realised that he was the one who had said all of those things.
Draco blinked up at it. He had expected to think of it as tasteless, but oddly enough, it comforted him, made him feel somewhat better. Here he was, feeling like enough of an outsider, and he couldn’t even have the simple pleasure of hiding out in the Slytherin dormitory, lounging on the leather sofas and watching fish and merpeople swim by above him. And yet, even in this unfamiliar nook of Hogwarts, where the black and white and grey of the room seemed strange, the tapestry gave him this feeling of…safety.
After finishing up his breakfast, he cast Cleaning Charms on all the dishes and levitated them to return them to their proper shelves. He could at least say he had gotten slightly better at household spells, though Polkey always managed to find something he’d missed or forgotten to clean.
Harry chewed on the inside of his mouth.
He tried to focus, on Luna’s kind face, on the cold air, on the warm breaths of the Thestral sleeping soundly in his lap. He stopped his stroking of the Thestral’s mane to tug the left sleeve of his robes up and then reached his arm out towards Luna, displaying the Mark at full view.
Harry just snorted as Malfoy—
“Fascinating, isn’t it?” she asked, his eyes large. “I wonder if the Sorting Hat has ever issued warnings about the Houses before? I mean, it didn’t even sound like this in fifth year. ‘Remember there aren’t always victims you can save,’ I wonder what that means.”
Even after the Patronus had faded away, Draco was rooted to the spot. He was still in awe at what had happened. He had done it. He had cast a corporeal Patronus. There was something so striking about Patronuses, but it felt even
“Well, let me know if you think of anything. It’s annoying to have to rewrite unnecessarily. I can show you the draft on Saturday. We are still good for Saturday, right?”
“Thank you for telling me all this,” said Harry, “I appreciate you being honest with me, it means a lot. Sorry I spoiled the mood before. You know. While we were getting it on.”
he thought,
way. So, anyway. Ginny was really upset; she thought that it meant that I found her too ugly to fuck. We broke up not long after that, it wasn’t great.”
“Weird, really how much has changed. That having sex before marriage was seen to be completely evil. It isn’t even that long ago, really. Dumbledore would have been about our age the first time that opera was performed.”
Draco rolled his eyes and accioed their stuff, before pulling them both into the tight squeeze of apparition.
Draco’s eyes flashed. “No!” He was so vehement it made Harry jump. “Your body is your body, Harry. You shouldn’t be any more ‘chill’ about someone touching it than you want to be.”
“Yes, yes. Your life is hard, we know,” said Draco, patting his shoulder, the patronising git. “But why do you feel the need to wear a formal muggle suit while performing Ministry Golden Boy duties? Surely dress robes would be more apt?”
“Oh, right,” Draco looked shell shocked; distressed.
“I haven’t had sex, alright! I’m a virgin. Chaste, pure as the driven snow, all my petals intact, no canker in the bud
“Harry,” he said, “have you ever heard of asexuality?”
Harry had been selected for the
“I would really like to see your cock. May I?” asked Harry. Draco gave him a look of adoration.
author, you knob. And a relationship advice columnist.”
“Do you want to?” said Draco, surprised.
“I get to see yours, too. I’m not going to down-throw on my own.”
Draco moaned, low guttural and needy, closing his eyes and snaking a hand up and around Harry’s back. Harry collapsed beside him, hands ghosting over Draco’s torso, tracing Draco’s chest though his shirt. Draco’s breath stuttered, uneven with arousal. It made Harry’s chest squeeze, his own breath catching then coming back in quick pants. Draco wanted him, his touch, his breath on Draco’s neck. Draco moved his head, giving Harry easy access, and Harry took full advantage, mouthing the thin skin where shoulder met neck, the vibrations of Draco’s moans under his lips. Harry poured himself onto Draco’s lap, Draco adjusting them so their bodies fit better together, hands under Harry’s shirt. Harry’s nose was behind Draco’s ear, still kissing, revelling in the scent of skin, sweat, and cologne. Draco worked more of Harry’s shirt loose from his slacks, hands skating over Harry’s waist to his stomach, down to his fly. Harry froze, heart clenching in his chest in a bad way this time. Draco stopped.
“Understood.” Harry tongued right up the ridge under Draco’s cock. Draco made an undignified squeal-grunty noise.
“Ok. Would you like some tea while you tell me whatever it is? I can fix a pot.”
“I’m not uncomfortable,” said Draco, lightly kissing the nape of Harry’s neck, “by all means, go ahead.”
“Why would I do that?”
“Absolutely.”
“I bought programmes,” said Draco, waving one in Harry’s general direction.
“Probably,” said Draco softly, strong arms cradling Harry’s back “there are a wide range of things I would agree to right now.”
“Oh, Harry, yes. Yes, of course. Whatever you like. I’m fine with slow, slow is my favourite. We can do as much or as little as you like.”
“Do you really have a thing for virgins? I was kind of kidding, but it’s ok if you do.”
“Oh, and Draco?”
“Yes,” Draco rubbed Harry’s back, “clothes removal can be arranged. Anything else? Or is this just a show and tell kind of deal?”
Draco looked at him, his expression serious but gentle.
“Oh you fucker. No, don’t stop.”
“Are you offering me a strip tease already?”
Harry was far more nervous than he should have been preparing for the date. They had agreed to meet up again on Saturday and read over Draco’s article, checking that there wasn’t anything in there Harry strongly disagreed with (
cycle. Also, there used to be a belief that extra body weight improved vocal timbre, which was all a load of tosh. But the images of fat sopranos singing Wagner still lingers, more’s the pity.
“Sorry, still don’t really buy it, I’m afraid. Draco, your main reader base is middle-aged witches and forty-year-old mothers who have usually had loads of sex – I know it’s not particularly on-brand for their image, but that doesn’t make it not true. The stakes are so high – your audience are so
“Go on then,” said Draco, “lead the way.”
“Would you like me to touch you? I mean on your…” Harry shot Draco’s bulge a meaningful glance.
“Pardon?”
“I declare this topic closed. We need a new one. For the love of Merlin pick something civil this time.”
Harry grinned, “Yeah. Really.” He stepped closer to Draco, cupping Draco’s cheek in one hand. “Can I…?”
“Yeah, tea might be nice, now you mention it.” Draco gave Harry a wet smile, his face was blotchy, and he had a gob of snot on his chin.
Harry laughed and continued, enjoying the hot, dense-velvet silky smoothness of Draco’s erection. The way it grew and twitched under his touch, while Draco made small keening noises of pleasure, hips bucking against Harry’s grip. Harry muttered his favourite wandless wanking charm, it made his palm slick with lube and also slightly altered sensation – now when he gripped Draco’s cock it would feel like his hand was fully enveloping it with warm, slippery heat. He shifted on his elbow, carefully placed the flat of his tongue over the head of Draco’s cock, covering his teeth with his top lip, and sucked, sliding his charmed hand up Draco’s shaft from the base to the tip.
“Not to be rude, but I just want to be clear on something. Would this arrangement be… er… a, a sympathy fuck kind of deal? Because, I don’t think I would really be comf...”
For the entire first scene of the first act, apparently, which was likely to be of some significant duration. Had Harry been on his own, he would have risked it. He suspected opera was not going to be his cup of tea at all and missing one scene of bad music would be no great loss. However, there was a very real possibility Draco would wait for him and also be locked out, and the idea of spending 20-30 minutes of sitting alone with Draco berating him would be unbearable. Not to mention that the git would definitely include it in his magazine write up AND bring it up every time he saw Harry for approximately the next eighty years, at the bare minimum. There was nothing for it. Harry drew himself up to his full Gryffindor-on-a-mission unembarrassable height and strode into the building in search of his date.
“Then yes. Merlin. That sounds amazing.”
When Draco was settled, and all the appropriate protective charms had been cast, Harry crawled up between Draco’s parted knees. He lightly traced the shape of Draco’s outer thighs with his palms. It was strange to see someone else's penis this close up. Draco’s erection was a pretty colour, pinker than Harry’s and a slightly different shape. Harry placed a quick gentle kiss on it’s tip. Draco gasped and closed his eyes. Harry couldn’t believe he was allowed to see him like this, beautiful, naked, and longing. He moved higher, arms encircling Draco’s hips, and kissed the soft white, blue-vein marbled skin of Draco’s stomach. Nosed into the dusting of coarse hair that trailed from his bellybutton down to his groin. Draco groaned, his legs twitching against Harry’s ribs. He was precious, Draco was so precious. Harry buried his face into the fold between Draco’s groin and the top of his thigh and just stayed there a while, breathing in the musty scent of him, feeling the catch of pubic hair on Harry’s stubble, and waited while Draco caught his breath, adjusted to the intimacy of Harry’s touch.
Turns out showers can be a bit cramped with two people in them. Not to mention uncomfortable and a little cold. Harry couldn’t have cared less, he got to hold Draco naked and participate in the banal necessities of washing. Soaped backs and shampoo. Washed arseholes – the intimacy of that was breathtakingly hot, even though neither of them was up for another round quite that soon. Harry had no idea his afternoon was going to involve soap and Draco’s arse crack. Draco’s arse crack that he let Harry touch. He was so beautiful and Harry wasn’t sure he would ever recover from the shock or the joy of it.
“Yes.”
“Did you have anything specific in mind?” Draco asked.
Harry’s laugh bubbled out of him, high pitched and too thin.
“You’re incorrigible.”
“All I said was that I trusted your taste better than
are clearly the superior team. Wait. Did you just say
Draco shook his head, “I don’t think so, no. I was speaking metaphorically.”
“You’re wearing too many clothes,” Draco whispered conspiratorially. Harry smiled and wandlessly banished his shirt without moving his hands from their spot on Draco’s waist. “That’s cheating,” said Draco, pressing closer, bare chest to bare chest. He didn’t sound like he actually minded.
Harry managed to find the place alright, although he opted to discreetly apparate rather than take the tube. He had managed this without incident, despite the built-up nature of the muggle surroundings. Even from outside the building, Harry could tell he was going to regret his choice of clothing. Several of the men in the crowd milling around the foyer cradling plastic wine glasses were in shirtsleeves without waistcoats or even ties. One particularly casually dressed gentleman was in what appeared to be maroon chinos, a cream cotton t-shirt, and a blazer with elbow patches. Harry glanced at his watch, assessing if he had time to go home and change – into what he wasn’t sure, but he must have something that would make him look less of a prat than what he was currently wearing. He had fifteen minutes before the show started. Harry was looking around for a handy alleyway for apparition when he remembered Draco’s dire warning about Being Late. Harry technically already was late, at least by Draco’s reckoning. Apparently, being late was the worst
“You’ve read my books?” said Draco, in a small voice.
“Merlin, Potter. What. How have I offended your Gryffindor sensibilities this time?”
“Isn’t that like, a spoiler? Wouldn’t it be better to find out what happens while we watch?”
“Poor Dumbledore. Being gay back then was as bad for the reputation as being a woman of easy virtue. But I take your point. Virtually no one
Harry kissed the corner of Draco’s mouth. “Just checking,” he said before removing their underwear. “Can you do the charms?” Draco muttered protection and lubrication incantations and Harry’s skin tingled, all goosebumps and anticipation. Gently, he grasped both their cocks.
“What about the poor straight people deprived of being turned on and distracted? Also, the Arrows have always been backward. This is just one more instance of the inevitable.”
Back at Grimmauld Place, ensconced in the living room along with a bottle of very old but nonetheless exceptionally drinkable wine, Harry continued to quiz Draco on opera.
“Would it matter if it was?”
“Sorry, Draco, I didn’t quite catch that.”
“I don’t know, really. I think it’s probably because I have to know someone really well before I feel comfortable around them in that way? And most people don’t understand that it’s just how I am, they think it’s about them. As in, they think me needing time is some kind of a slight on them, like that I don’t find them particularly attractive or something. I mean, Ginny, for instance. She really wanted to have sex with me when we were together. She talked me into letting her give me a blow job and everything, but I couldn’t…”
“We’re here to see
“Harry, I’m going to, I think…” and Draco came. Harry caught it, sucking and swallowing it down, even though it was jizz, and tasted really awful. He was too high on having made Draco come to care, too delighted with his success. Harry held Draco as he came down. Draco murmured sweet nothings and carded his hands through Harry’s hair.
“Potter, if it weren’t I would have said so before, believe me.”
“You wouldn’t see anything! There are separate girls showers, with cubicles and everything.” Harry objected.
“Oh. Right… good. That’s really good. Let’s do that then.”
“Oh, you are ridiculous.” Draco hid his face in the menu and blushed.
Malfoy had lectured.
“Go on then,” said Harry with a grin, “be my guest. Pick one.”
Draco appeared with two cups and saucers, a teapot, milk jug, sugar bowl, and plate of chocolate biscuits bobbing along behind him. With a flick of his wand everything settled on the coffee table and he sat and carefully poured tea for the both of them.
“I should have checked,” said Draco. He still sounded upset, but less scared.
“True, but I’ll take it; Never look a compliment in the mouth and all that.” He grinned and handed Harry a menu. “I am sorry about this, by the way. When I agreed to go on a date for W.A.P. I was assuming they would pair me up with someone with whom I had less personal history.”
“Uh huh. And your new book, the one with all the giant posters with your mug all over them. What was it called again,
Harry gave him a half smile.
“No,” said Draco, breathless and quieter than usual, “I just propositioned you, you complete dolt.”
“In that way?”
“Fuck... yeah, ok. But it’s not how you think; I wasn’t laughing at you being a virgin. It was just a knee jerk reaction. As in, when something emotional surprises you and your brain goes –
“Please, Harry.”
“I’ll stay,” Draco promised, “but you’re making me breakfast.”
Harry grasped himself gently, muttering the same wandless charm he had used earlier with Draco, and fell into the familiar rhythm of a wank. He could feel Draco holding him, his warm body pressed into Harry’s back, his hand cupping Harry’s hip, the soft huff of Draco’s breath on his neck. It felt good. Harry never fantasized while wanking, he had been quite surprised to find out others did. He even knew guys who couldn’t get off without pornographic photos, which was odd to him, because those things actively turned Harry off the few times he had seen them. But to each their own, he wasn’t judging. When Harry masturbated, he focused on the way his body felt, the movement of his hand, the fissions of pleasure this caused. He sank into the moment without really thinking of anything much, just feeling and feeling and feeling. It was harder to do with someone else there, but Harry found if he focused on the feeling of security and trust of being held by Draco it helped. The specialness of being able to be with him, to share this with him, a man Harry cared for, one he had grown to like and respect, and who he trusted. Draco’s trust in sharing this with him when Draco himself was so inexperienced. Finally, Harry managed to lose himself in sensation, his whole focus on the spikes of pleasure shooting from his groin, curling through his legs, his stomach. His breathing sped up in time with his hand, then plateaued, and then gasping, Harry came. Draco held him through it, as Harry’s vision blurred and his cock spurted and pulsed.
Draco nodded and Harry slipped his hands inside the robe, knuckles brushing over Draco’s chest, deliberately thumbing peaked nipples, enjoying the way Draco gasped, arching into the touch. Harry smiled, kissing him quickly on the mouth, and started working on Draco’s buttons. Draco closed his eyes, hands resting on Harry’s shoulders, allowing Harry to undress him. The intimacy of it made Harry’s hands shake as he worked the flimsy fabric around the buttons, hyper-aware of the warmth of Draco’s skin, the rise and fall of his chest. He reached the last button, checked that the shirt was fully untucked, and slid his arms around Draco’s waist, revelling in the warm soft-slick feeling of skin-on-skin as his forearms encircled Draco’s back. Draco embraced him, face buried in Harry’s neck, mouthing him, kissing and sucking, while Harry held him and shuddered, almost crying at how overwhelming it was to touch and be touched.
“It would, if it made you uncomfortable.”
“Yeah, not in a
“I know. But it’s easier for me to focus on you at the moment, touching you, enjoying your arousal. I don’t want to be touched myself right now, but you enjoying yourself makes me feel good. If you would like me to do that.”
“I’m not… Harry, what the fuck? Sex Author? Since when… I mean… you do realise that isn’t a thing? As in, that is not a job title. No one when heading up a CV in the history of ever has put ‘Sex Author’ under work experience.”
“I think what you’re trying to say is ‘thank you, Harry for pulling strings so I can train with my Quidditch heroes, even though they are not on your team,’” said Harry, crowing.
“Well, as you asked so sweetly, you may. But on one condition.”
“Oh,” said Harry.
Harry had forgotten how good Draco looked in the air. He was decidedly more athletic than anyone with such a sedentary profession had any right to be. To make matters worse, they ended up playing a chaser’s match (easier with two aside) and Draco paired with Davidson, aka God’s gift to Quidditch chasers the world over. Pitted against two dyed-in-the-wool seekers, one of whom was getting on a bit, team Draco was doing quite well and Harry was starting to regret his decision to fly an older model broom. Surely the distraction of Draco’s arse in fitting quidditch breeches and short flying robes would have been handicap enough.
“And it is. I’m not expecting anything from you, Harry.”
“Can I touch you?”
Harry brushed a lock of hair off Draco’s forehead. “May I?”
for free, mostly (Harry knew) because Hermione had asked him to. It wasn’t the kind of thing Draco usually did. Harry was being touchy, and he needed to chill.  So instead of snapping, he replied, “I guess there are a fairly limited number of famous queer wizards who would be willing to embarrass themselves for the sake of charity. Fewer, if you rule out your exes.”
Draco gave him a look of deep affection. The unidentified expression from earlier was also back.
Harry pulled a face. “Here I was thinking that despite the posh décor and exorbitant prices, the food was at least likely to be good. Now I suspect this is all just a swanky aesthetic aimed to con money out of a clientele with more status anxiety than taste.”
“Draco, would it be weird if I asked you to hold me while I touch myself?”
“You lads have fun.” She gave them a wiggly fingered wave and a look that included a shit-eating grin and lewd eyebrows, before heading to the changing rooms on the opposite end of the pitch.
“Er… not offended exactly.” Harry didn’t meet Draco’s eye. “It's just that I haven’t, you know. Had sex. That is.”
“Yours or mine?” Harry gasped.
“Yes. I’m in the process of writing the article. I’ll leave out the extra-curricular dick stroking. Not that it wouldn’t be lucrative, but it’s hardly the done thing to discuss private affairs. Are there any other sensitive topics you would like me to avoid?”
“Ah, Draco? Are you ok? Is it something I said? I mean, I assumed I was less experienced than the people you usually shag. Am I not? Do you like hooking up with virgins or something? Like a kink? I mean, that’s probably alright, so long as it’s consensual. Except, maybe it would have been nice to tell me first? In the interests of clear communication and all that…”
“Correct.”
Without underwear it was painfully apparent that Harry was not properly hard. Harry glanced up at Draco, he had seen.
“Oh, is that what the kids are calling it, these days?”
Harry had to use all his will power to keep a straight face. It would have been highly inappropriate and hurtful to laugh, given the situation, however tempting.
Turns out that opera was bloody brilliant. Or, at least, Janáček’s
“I can’t believe you own a formal suit appropriate for a white tie dress-coded event – including an honest-to-Merlin self-tie bow tie – and you don’t even know that it’s called white tie. Wait, yes, I do believe that. What I actually don’t believe is that you own white tie apparel in the first place. Whatever possessed you?”
“Depends. Can we share?”
“What? That I fancy you?”
is refreshingly gritty and realistic. The play it was based on was written by a female Czech playwright and is very true to life at the turn of last century. It was pretty unusual at the time, for both reasons.”
“Yes,” Draco swallowed, “it still stands. I would… I would like that.”
He picked up his pace, careful to make as little noise as possible, as he tried to catch up to Malfoy. His heart rate picking up ever so slightly, it felt like flying a broom—familiar, ingrained, easy.
Potter, and quite frankly, I think I’ve heard more about you than I’d ever care to know.”
Harry watched him. He hadn’t heard much about what Malfoy had been up to, not since the trials and that had been more than a year ago. But despite walking away from Azkaban, Malfoy couldn’t have been welcomed into the open arms of society.
“Cheer up, mate,” said Ron. “It’s your birthday. Hey, let’s get your mind off it. Another round!”
Sophie batted her eyelashes at him and Ron choked on a cough.
“A few more minutes,” said Malfoy. “You’ll be alright.”
“What happened?” she asked. “Between you and this Nathaniel? You were together?”
it would be like this with Potter, even the most innocent kiss so intense he could feel his skin burning with it.
Draco remained silent, wanting to give Potter the time to work up to what he was going to say. He felt an anxious stirring in his stomach, the one that always came up when the war was brought up, and he felt like that was probably where the conversation was headed.
Draco certainly wasn’t the best at recognizing emotions—especially not his own—but he liked to think he was reasonably sharp and observant. Observant enough to notice that, although Violet’s eyes were fixed on her book, they were unmoving, and she hadn’t turned a page in over five minutes.
Draco held out his arms.
He presented the tiny jar, which Nott took with his thumb and fore-finger.
“Heidi and I are going out, Ron,” Ginny said, seemingly taking pity on her brother.
“Potter,” he said, coolly.
” Harry Said, stubbornly. “That doesn’t mean that what he did was right.”
Checking his watch, Draco went back to his bedroom to get dressed. It was another day of work ahead of him, and he could only hope today would be less stressful than yesterday.
“You don’t have to tell me if you don’t wish to,” he said. “But if you’d like to talk, I’m here.”
Both Potter and Granger looked stunned once again. Granger, as expected, gained her composure first.
“And you can’t just…move it?”
Realizing she was expecting an answer, Draco managed a, “No, I haven’t found the time.”
“Kreacher has made sure they will stay fresh,” the elf said, then muttering, “Master thinks Kreacher is thoughtless, but Kreacher is not.”
“Former Death Eater,” he said, his voice sounding formal and strange.
“I think it’s connected to the pureblood marriage oath and the bonding ritual. I believe that anyone who takes the Oath would only be able to complete the marital bonding ritual with another member of the Sacred Twenty-Eight. However, as I’m sure you know, many magical couples these days decline to perform the ritual. Keeping the bloodline pure is clear, the Oath prevents one from creating a child that isn’t of pure blood. However, I’m unsure over whether or not it prevents a
“How can we find out?” he asked. To his surprise, Ollivander let out a soft chuckle.
Unwilling to return to work and deal with Finchley all over again, Draco spent his eighth April 10
Draco Summoned a quill and penned a quick note, asking after the senior wandmaker’s wellbeing and whether he would like to reschedule their meeting, and then called over Elpis, promising her a treat when she returned. She hooted happily as he tied the letter to her leg, and took off as soon as he opened the far window.
her shift started. “Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley have broken up!”
Daphne kept her lips tightly pursed as Astoria bemoaned the latest unsavoury meeting.
“Nonsense, my boy,” this came from Dumbledore, and Draco looked at him in surprise.
“As long as you’re alright,” he said and Hermione gave him a gentle smile and reached over to squeeze his hand warmly.
“’Course,” said Ron, easily. “Auror training won’t be as fun without you there, but you sound really chuffed about this. ‘Mione’s right, too, you know. You’d be a good professor. I learned loads from you in fifth year.”
“What?”
Ron gaped at her.
“It’s been a shitshow,” said Malfoy, barking out a sharp laugh that didn’t meet his eyes. “When the Ministry seized the Malfoy vaults, I thought that would be the worst of it. Stupid of me.”
“Merlin, this is harder than I thought,” he murmured. “It’s—I’m the one linked to you. In your, in the…Subconscious Linked Legilimency.”
Hermione and Ron had come over, on one of their few evenings off, and Harry had cooked dinner. It had been lovely at first, Harry once again trying to apologise to Ron for quitting the Aurors and Ron waving him off, Hermione cutting in to reassure Harry that they supported him no matter what he decided to do, and Harry felt a rush of affection for his best friends, but then a thought so out of place shook him.
“You spoke at their trial?” she demanded. “Why?”
that he had willingly walked towards his death in the Forbidden Forest and that, in comparison, walking down Diagon Alley towards Draco Malfoy should be no trouble at all just to get
“I’m a hypocrite for saying it, honestly. I still get nightmares on and off. I still think of the Battle. Of those we lost. I still reach for my wand when I hear a loud noise, or when something surprises me. I have good memories here, but I have the bad ones too. And sometimes, I don’t know which ones to pay attention to. Sometimes I feel guilty for carrying on, for sitting in the Great Hall and eating and laughing with my friends when there are students who died—who died
This time, the speaker was Potter. He didn’t look angry like Finnigan or stern like Granger. He just looked tired. His normally bright green eyes lacked their usual spark and he seemed to be slouching, his posture nowhere near as strong and commanding as it typically was.
“I know,” said Harry. “Can you believe he’s learning about Muggles from his friend, that Foxblade girl?”
“Er…no? I mean, I thought we would both be doing it at first, but he’s got his teaching thing and I reckon he’s much happier with that,” Ron gave a little shrug and looked at Harry again, who grinned at him.
“Hmmm?”

“Oh, you complete fucker.” Draco punched him in the arm, and Harry grinned. “You invited Brevis Birch and Robyne Davies from the
“Oh, good.” Harry felt the tension rush out of his shoulders and back. “I’ll just…” he pulled at the cuff of his coat.
“Oh, yes. I’ve already bought us both tickets.”
“Oh,” Draco’s voice sounded slightly strangled, his face flushing. He blinked for a moment while it returned to a more subdued colour. “Yes, you can touch me while we’re naked, if you would like. That sounds quite appealing, actually.”
“That,” said Draco, landing with his plastered sweatily all over his face, “was quite possibly the best date of all time.” He was so happy that Harry felt his ire over his 15-12 defeat evaporate. He didn’t even have the heart to take the piss, or to point out that half of his team had been geriatric, and not only had half of Draco’s been fighting fit, but also England’s best chaser. Instead, he just hugged him. Draco cupped Harry’s jaw and kissed him, while Davidson whooped and wolf-whistled.
“Er… kind of? I mean, I wank.”
“Blame Hermione,” Harry shrugged, “it’s her charity.”
“No, no. Your bow tie is fine,” said Draco, waving a hand. Draco wasn’t wearing a tie: he was wearing a sheer gauzy black collared shirt that was open at the throat; a dark red waistcoat that matched the detailing on his slacks, his eyebrow ring, and his pocket handkerchief; and a French-blue sleek sparkly blazer. Harry swallowed, Draco looked properly hot. He was also still talking at Harry about Harry’s clothes.
book, you complete twat, and it’s called
Harry laughed, embarrassed. “No, worse than that. I couldn’t even get it up, it was so awkward and the worse I felt the worse the no-boner-problem became… it was just bad. Really, truly terrible. Gin didn’t understand it at all, she thought maybe I was gay. Asked me outright, actually, not long afterwards. It would be an easy explanation, right? Especially as I like guys, too. But I’m definitely bisexual, I’ve found all kinds of people from right across the gender spectrum romantically attractive, including Ginny actually. I found her really romantically attractive when we were together just not…”
“Oh, wicked. What are we going to see?”
“Also,” Harry continued doggedly, “I am not calling you a slut. I mean, even if you had slept with every gay man on Diagon Alley I wouldn’t call you a slut, that would be wrong – your sex life is your business and shaming people is never ok — I just meant that the wizarding community is tiny, the queer wizarding community even tinier, and the famous queer wizarding community is minuscule. So. Even if you had only dated and broken up with one famous queer wizard, it would significantly shrink the pool of possible date candidates.”
“There’s nothing wrong with being a virgin, Draco. I’m hardly going to laugh at you, I too, am also a virgin. We have established this.”
“Thank you,” he whispered.
“Naturally that works. After all, bodies only have so many different holes and appendages, and human emotions are alarmingly similar. There are really only so many ways of writing ‘I think this person is hot, they think I’m hot, so let’s get together and orgasm all over the place in improbable ways.’ You don’t actually have to have
“Ok, fine. How’s the erotic fiction writing going, then?”
“Yeah, pretty much.”
Quidditch was the theme for Harry and Draco’s third and final charity date. Draco was meeting Harry at the Arrows off-season training grounds midday Wednesday. What Harry had planned would take the rest of the afternoon and Draco had to take time off work. He had bitched about this profusely and at length, which Harry had cheerfully ignored. Draco had a flexible work schedule – he was principally a freelance writer – and he worked too hard as it was. Instead of changing the time of the date, Harry had promised to make it worth Draco’s while and told him to come in clothes suitable for flying and to bring his broom, unless he wanted to use one of Harry’s spares. Harry had good spares. He had a rather exclusive sponsorship deal with Firebolt (being a war hero and a professional quidditch player was occasionally useful) and they sent him new brooms whenever they updated their models. Although Harry still flew the one Sirius had given him for sentimental reasons, it was fun to have other options and essential for training and matches. Consequently, he now had enough top-end brooms that he could have lent spares to all the Weasleys including their extended family and have good ones left over. Not that this was necessary – Ginny was in the Harpies and had surplus brooms of her own – but he
was bloody brilliant. Draco said it was poor form to judge an entire genre on one show, but looked unduly smug when Harry mentioned it.
. I would have worn something nice.”
Harry swallowed, suddenly frightened.
“No, you’re not. You have proved yourself to be incapable and untrustworthy. Now hurry up and pick a different conversation topic or I’ll be forced to do it myself.”
Harry shook his head, “I think you’re being overly generous there, but ok. If it makes you feel better. Draco?”
Harry laughed, then came round the table and knelt in front of Draco cupping his face in his hands and kissing him. “I don’t know. I hear you’re a sex god. You might have better offers.”
“Yes?”
“Merlin, the two of us are a mess.”
“Oh, thank Merlin. You left me hanging so long, I thought you were going to say no.”
Draco sipped his tea and looked pensive. “I suppose I really have to tell you, now. Don’t I?”
“Can you take us to your bedroom? It’s just I feel a little on show in the parlour. I’m not angling for anything you don’t want to give, you understand.”
“Sure, no problem. Just no teeth, please.”
“Yes,” Harry swallowed, thinking of the other ‘extra-curricular’ plans they had made for that day. “I’m looking forward to it.”
Harry started, realising he had been staring into the middle-distance while fantasising about Malfoy at dinner parties. “Oh, nothing important,” he smiled, shaking his head. “How’s the Sex Author work going?”
“Excuse me! My exes are a very select and small group. You make it sound like I’ve slept with every gay man in Diagon Alley! Also, a date with me is
of sex in those books. Like, a lot. I’ve read them.”
Draco smiled, honey slow, then kissed Harry quickly, full on the mouth. “Shirtsleeves and slacks would be brilliant,” he said.
“Oi. Don’t call me that.”
“Oh!.. oh... oh…” Draco moaned writhing, hands grasping onto the headboard. He was so loud in bed. Harry almost felt drunk off Draco’s arousal, of the power of being able to draw it out of him, the giddying joy of making Draco come apart. Of being allowed to give him this private, personal, wonderful thing. Harry kept working his hand, adjusting his rhythm, pressure and speed slightly to match Draco’s moans, trying to gauge what felt best from Draco’s responses. It seemed to be working. Draco was panting, crying out, keening. Then he stilled, drawing deep ragged breaths.
“No, no. Nothing like that.”
“I mean, in a no-strings-attached, friends with benefits kind of way,” said Draco speaking a little louder but much too fast, “just to be clear. I just thought. Well, I mean, I thought maybe, as you trusted me enough to tell me this… and we sort of know each other a bit. It might be good practice for you… you know, if you… ah… wanted to.”
with Malfoy. He had just agreed to sign up for a charitable publicity stunt for W.A.P. (Wixen Against Preposterous-Pureblood-Prejudice), Hermione’s latest passion project.
“Hmmm?”
“Can we spoon for a bit? I need a moment.”
“Knut for your thoughts?”
Once Draco was still, Harry wiped his mouth, reached for the glass of water on the bedside table, swallowed. Draco looped his arms around Harry’s waist from behind, chin on his shoulder. Harry turned slightly and kissed him.
