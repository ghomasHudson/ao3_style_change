“Yeah, it’s me,” Harry said, unable to sit still. “Have you – has Remus – Did you read today’s Prophet?”
Ron gave him a funny look, as if Harry had something on his head. Harry instinctively ran his hand through his hair, just in case. “Well, I’ll see you on Sunday then yeah?”
The streets on the outskirts of London, where Grimmauld place was, were rather quiet, as everyone was at work or school. Harry listened as birds chirped in the trees and the low buzz from central London distracted his mind from his boredom. It was times like this that he missed Ron being an Auror the most, and he hated himself for it.
“Well don’t stand in the door like a prat all day Potter, you’ll let the heat out,” he drawled, nodding his head towards the back of the teashop.
Draco thought for a moment – it was a complicated question. He used to, and he used to hate Harry for that exact reason. His laugh, his wit, his smile, his eyes, everything about him used to make Draco confused. Until he left Hogwarts and met Astoria, someone who loved him back, faults and all, and he forgot all about Harry. It was only when Scorpius asked this question however, it made him realise something. “You know what Scorpius, I think I do,” he replied, suddenly unsure of what to think.
“Harry!” someone exclaimed as he stepped through the portrait to the Gryffindor common room, practically tackling him to the ground with a hug. “You never came back to the lesson and Snape, the evil bastard, he wouldn’t let us look for you,” Ron, the apparent assailant, explained, talking almost as quickly as Hermione, the worry etched into his face. “Then
Blaise sighed, rubbing his arm. “That’s not really the point Pans,” Blaise said, understanding Draco’s fears. His mother was only just neutral, in terms of politics. “If he does get disowned, he won’t be able to
In front of the Professor’s table was a stool, and atop the stool was a dusty, old hat. Draco tilted his head as he stared at the hat, and saw he wasn’t the only first year to be confused.
“Don’t thank me yet Potter,” Malfoy replied, wincing at his own thoughts. “There’s not much more I can tell you,” he said quietly, sounding sincere.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “If I was going to kill you Potter, I’d have done it by now,” he drawled, folding his arms.
The walk from the docks to outside the Great Hall was not as long as Draco would have assumed it to be, looking at the outside of the castle. The trio continued the walk with their arms linked, smiling and laughing, buzzing from the magic that emanated from within the very foundations of Hogwarts itself.
“That’s an understatement,” Pansy drawled, rolling her eyes. “Do you remember when we were four and that
The trio spent the rest of the journey theorising about the Hogwarts feast, as well as the sorting ceremony. So far, they had come up with multiple theories, including (but not limited to)
Draco knew there was nothing to be said about his parents outside of hollow promises, and he was grateful Cedric hadn’t assured him of something he would have no knowledge on. “Thank you,” he sniffed, rubbing his eyes with the hem of his robes.
Hermione tried to snatch it out of his hands as soon as she realised what the headline was, but Harry managed to get out of her reach as he read the headline again, and again.
, he added in his head, but he wasn’t sure that was something he should tell either of them. Not only was Harry uncertain about his sexuality, but it was with
“I don’t expect we’d have the best heart to heart Potter,” Malfoy smirked, glancing back at Harry. “Besides, would you tell
Harry felt sick and dizzy, his vision spotty. He knocked his glasses off as he pressed the heels of his palms into his eyes, hoping that would fix his vision. He could just about hear the door opening and someone calling his name.
“Who might have just given us valuable information,” Sirius added. “Is it possible this was him reaching out? That he might want to change for the better, but he isn’t in a position where he can?” Sirius said, and Harry opened his mouth to deny what Sirius said, but it made sense.
“Oi!” Harry exclaimed, supressing a laugh. “Don’t offend flobberworms like that,” he said, and Draco quirked an eyebrow, amused.
“I’ll owl you where and when if that’s alright?” Draco said, ignoring the blush creeping onto his face.
“There’s a war arriving,” Draco muttered. “And I won’t know if she’s okay, all because my parents are too cowardly to choose me over some lunatic,” he spat, curling up into a ball on his chair. His aunt had already written to him. He wasn’t sure how she knew what was happening, perhaps his mother had written to her instead of to him. She wrote that if he needed her, all he had to do was write a letter and she’d pick him up from the platform.
“I’ve spoken to her before, she gave some good advice on baking bread,” Harry reminisced. She had also told him that he and Draco make a wonderful couple, but he wasn’t going to tell him that.
Before Draco could answer, there was a tapping at the hatch to the attic. “Is that you Harry?” a voice called.
There was a faint hum of magic emanating from the teashop, and Harry hoped that was due to it being owned by and visited by magic folk, rather than the tea being made by magic. Harry had only tried once to make tea with magic, and it was the second most disgusting drink he ever had to drink. It would have been the worst, but nothing has ever, or will ever be more disgusting than the Polyjuice potion he drank in his second year. Although, as it seemed that Malfoy would be the one making his tea, he was certain that it wouldn’t be made with magic – he had a feeling Malfoy was a stickler when it came to making tea.
“You don’t tell me about pasties again and there will be no more kisses,” Draco informed him, and Harry rolled his eyes, knowing it was an empty threat.
Draco stiffened under Remus and Sirius’ amused gaze and smoothed his robes instinctively. “Hello Professor Lupin,” Draco said calmly, his expression devoid of any emotion. “Mr Black,” he nodded at Sirius who flinched.
Harry had a lump form in his throat and nodded, heading straight to the sofa, feeling incredibly awkward. He wasn’t sure why he stayed, but a part of him believed it would be rude to walk in, see Malfoy, and then leave. Harry didn’t have anything else to do anyway.
Draco furrowed his eyebrows. “Why?” he asked, flinching as Andromeda yelled something about how Dumbledore hasn’t cared for the boy once in the past decade. Draco had no idea who that boy was, but he could take a guess. He had mentioned to Andromeda about Harry’s isolation over the past month.
“I’ll alert the Order, but Harry, you must stay at Hogwarts all right? You can’t run off to the Ministry just because this trap was set for you,” Sirius said, his eyes scanning Harry’s face as he looked away.
“Can I –“ Harry began. “Can I ask you something if it’s not about Hogwarts?” he asked, fiddling with the bottom of his t-shirt.
Harry shrugged. “Maybe?” he said, bringing his knees up to his chest. “Ron and ‘Mione probably know, sort of, and Draco’s suspicious but he doesn’t push for answers.”
“I may have been awful at charms, but I was the best at defence,” Harry retaliated, snorting as Draco raised his eyebrows. “Besides, George has been trying to get word activated charms to work on objects for years, he couldn’t quite figure it out,” Harry said. He remembered the meals at the Burrow where George would complain about how it ‘
, sorry, you probably don’t want to talk about it,” Draco apologised, looking at the ground as they walked.
“What?” Harry asked, certain he’d misheard. Sirius had never corrected Harry when he said he only had one Godfather.
he insisted, lifting his glasses to rub the bridge of his nose. “There’s just, a lot happening OK?” he said, a dull ache pressing at the back of his eyes.
Draco nodded returning to his book before he processed what Kreacher said. “What!?” he exclaimed, running from the library. “Thank you Kreacher!” he called out as he left, skidding on the floorboards.
They laughed about the stupid things they used to do when they were eleven. Harry explained how Lupin had taught him how to produce a Patronus so he would stop fainting around dementors. Draco explained how once he accidentally set loose a rose bush in the Hufflepuff common room that wouldn’t stop growing and Professor Sprout insisted she personally tutor him on plant care so it wouldn’t happen again.
Draco couldn’t help but smile at his aunt’s calm demeanour. He had noticed that she wasn’t pleased with the Order’s presence.
“What’s his name?” Pansy asked, looking at her hands. It was clear she was trying to act as if it didn’t bother her, but she wasn’t very convincing.
Sirius sighed, muttering something to himself that Draco didn’t catch. “You shouldn’t blame yourself Draco,” he said, offering Draco a small smile. “From what I remember about Narcissa, she is a very powerful witch, and if she wanted to leave, no one would be able to stop her.”
. He suddenly felt all his anger and exhaustion at trying to peacefully deal with Snape for the past hour and a half resurface. “You’re right Professor I’m spoilt rotten,” he snapped. “It’s
He had barely managed to sit down at the kitchen table when there was a soft tapping at the window. It was Andromeda’s reply, which was a lot quicker than Harry was expecting. It was possible that she had received a letter too and felt rather lonely.
He had been intercepted by people he didn’t know, asking if his father could verify Harry’s claims, as he was ‘
“Here,” Harry said, shoving a hot chocolate at Draco. “You’ve been in here all day, it’s freezing,” he shivered, sipping his own hot chocolate.
Harry wished that Umbridge’s office was closer to the History of Magic classroom, and not on the other side of the school. His mind was filled with thoughts about Sirius already being dead. A lot of time had already passed since his dream and every minute standing around doing nothing was another minute of Sirius being tortured to death.
'I'm not asking Aria for lessons,' Draco mumbled, 'this isn't about learning Defence, this is about a matter of pride.'
Aria stopped herself before she made a fool out of herself. She knew that Draco's parents had been invited to see the last stage of the competition, for Hogwarts had all the families for the last contestants to watch the tournament.
'Wait - just give me a second -' Aria's hands moved to roll Teddy nearer towards her, 'if I just -' then she rolled over supporting Teddy all the while until her godson was the one upon the floor. 'Ah-ha - gotcha - not so smart now, are you?' and proceeded to tickle him, and Teddy laughed all the way through. 'There's no escape - none whatsoever.' her godson moved his arms and legs to curl up into a ball to stop her. 'You little Slytherin - such a sneaky thing to do - how am I meant to tickle you now?'
'Everyone is on it!' Aria exclaimed, 'Teddy, Andromeda, Tonks, Remus. Even Sirius! The Weasleys', my - my parents. I love it - I absolutely love it! I can't even begin to tell you what this means to me.'
Aria gaped at him, blinking rather rapidly. Draco Malfoy had just sworn an oath. A magically binding oath at that! He was agreeing to her conditions and had not demanded anything other than respect from her friends in return. Though she gathered his mother had covered the bases of actually spending time with him.
Aria would have been happy to accompany him, but Draco strode out of the classroom without a look in her direction, at least Zabini indicated for her to stay, shrugging his shoulders in apology, before going after his friend.
'Yes, I do,' Aria said firmly, 'Have you ever just heard someone's voice in your head when you read a letter or note that they've written? I hear Draco's voice every time, I can hear the way he would exactly say the words. I can picture his expressions as he spoke. If that's not loving him, I have no idea what is.'
'Mr Malfoy.' she greeted with her hand outstretched to shake his own, Draco noticed a glint of gold coming from her wrist, sure enough, it was a bracelet, the same bracelet Draco had made the moment he realised his son would inherit his Veela traits. There was no doubt now Draco had seen it for himself, the girl before him was his sons' compatible match.
Narcissa laughed, 'Compatible magic is not as complicated as making a wand Aria. Indeed, I knew from something simple as that.'
Bill had stopped short, peering at the doorway, Mrs Weasley had a wide-eyed look, Ron looked as though he was about to punch something, Ginny and Hermione exchanged hesitant looks. Fleur grabbed Bill's arm, and George gave a look of indifference.
Draco knew that something was wrong, Potter's magic seemed not quite right. It felt weaker somehow. Then he learned the reason why Potter had been plagued by horrible dreams. Her magic felt weaker because she herself was suffering due to not resting. He didn't know really what woke him the night he overheard Potter speaking with her cousin. He thought that maybe her magic had been reaching out for his own somehow, looking for the comfort she sorely needed.
'Well I didn't want him to ruin this for you,' Dudley said, he turned his head away, 'we - I treated you like crap. I just wanted you to have a nice time - for once.'
"We would have to find them and check first." Draco said, "But they could be anything. Like a portkey."
'Oh, I'm so sorry Luna ... I kinda forgot that we were involved in that, we should have been around to help.' Aria said.
'You know,' Aria said gently as she raised up her throbbing foot, 'you should consider Healing for a career. I'm feeling loads better.'
Hermoine and Ron were glancing at each other with smiles on their faces, Aria felt her face heat up, 'What?' They both laughed.
The next morning, bright and early, Aria apparated over to Diagon Alley. She passed through the Leaky Cauldron waving as she passed Tom the landlord, she had no troubles with passing through the cobbled street once she stepped onto it. Ollivanders looked exactly the same since the last time she had been in it, boxes which she knew to contain wands filled the shelves.
'That's because the Manor wards are older, than these ones.' Draco explained, he pulled them to a stop, gesturing to the door nearest, 'Open it.'
Aria giggled, 'And with only the levitation spell ... though, it was my friend Ron, who cast the spell, and we merely knocked the troll out.'
Stay! Well, that was one word for his sentence for the crimes he had committed, she was slightly startled to hear that he would be back so soon. It was just the news she wanted to hear, after being told that she was now engaged to Draco Malfoy. Not! At least someone else would be on her side, if there was one person who couldn't stand her more than Malfoy junior it was his father.
But that had been after the Dark Lord's defeat - after Potter had saved him. If he had just figured it out, back when they appeared at the Manor when he felt his magic wanting to respond to that of her own. He could not explain why he wanted to protect her, why he wanted to wrap her up so she would be less frightened. It - it had alarmed him, he was uncertain, and he had no way of doing any of those things. Potter had escaped, along with her friends, and the next time they saw each other, had of course been the Room of Requirement.
Wow indeed, the platform was its usual busy self, full of parents sending off their children. So far no one had noticed her arrival onto the platform. Aria kept glancing around, as they walked over to the Hogwarts express. Aria levitated Alana's trunk onto the train. Aria nodded and looked around, and found exactly who she had been looking for, Hermione, Ron, and Ginny; who were also loading trunks onto the train.
'I ... I wish - you should have just told me ... from the very beginning - it's not like I wouldn't have heard you out,' Aria mumbled. 'I know which - types - of magic that are honoured, and well - you should have told me - you could have told me.'
'I - I - gosh,' Aria rambled once more, hands raised in the air as she said, 'Why am I even attempting to explain myself!'
'I, Draco Lucius Malfoy, swear on my honour and magic, that I will never harm Aria Lily Potter, attempt to change anything about her, I will treat her henceforth with the utmost respect, added to that I also swear to treat her friends with the same respect. I will respect that her time is her own, and she is free to as she wishes with it.'
Aria smiled at him, her face leaning towards his cheek. But a flash of light caught Draco's attention, a spell coming towards them from a short distance away, there was no time to think about what to do, on instinct he reacted - he would be damned if he let his fiancee get hurt, he had made an oath after all, but what's more, he loved her.
'Well you'll be pleased that least one female student isn't falling for his Veela charms,' Blase said, 'and she is looking as popular as ever.'
'The nightmares - I take it you've had a few if your cousin's reaction was anything to go by - are they always that bad?'
'Horribly ... I keep treading on his feet.' Aria replied, with a slight smile. 'Not always by accident either.'
The door to her room opened again, and Aria hoped that the Healers had changed their minds. It turned out to be one better. Teddy Lupin was definitely the best thing to happen all day. Andromeda stopped in her tracks. Aria glanced at Draco who looked rather pale, Narcissa looked like she was seeing things whereas Lucius Malfoy looked how he always did. She wondered how long it had been since Narcissa Malfoy had seen her sister exactly ... Aria stood corrected ... the situation was now awkward.
Aria had not lied to Draco. You could after-all tell a lot about a person from their Patronus. And Draco's Patronus made more sense than she had led him to believe - something she had never told anyone. And it only confirmed her theory. If things had been different, then she was certain that she and Draco would have had matching Patronuses.
Not the question she had been expecting - most people knew exactly who she was, but the question about the platform meant it had been a first-year to ask - and if they just asked the first person they saw then most likely -
'Until the other competitors turn up, there is no way to tell that,' Aria said seriously, making Draco feel disappointed. 'But I have every faith that you are more than up to the challenge.'
Narcissa did not need to explain further, Aria knew she was talking about the bracelet concealed on her wrist beneath her robe. Talk of the bracelet made Aria, look at her own and examine her own bracelet. All of this, the engagement, had started because of Narcissa.
"To your dorm Miss Potter," Snape said sternly. It was weird being under Snape's protection rather than be at the end of his cruel belittling tone.
Mrs Weasley just had to use the don't mess me with tone. Aria cursed at herself, she should have gone over, been quicker. She should have thought that Malfoy would pull something like this.
'Good,' she replied firmly, 'she deserves a bonding. I'd advise you tell her the whole truth next time Draco, she might not be so forgiving.' So his grandmother had known what had caused him to almost lose ... everything he had built with Aria. 'Now I do believe your young lady is free, go dance with her.'
'I didn't think he'd go through with it,' Aria said, 'not after seeing the aeroplane - I'd thought he'd back out.'
'Once was enough, thank you.' Aria said firmly. Draco turned his head around, she looked slightly frustrated, frowning at her fellow peers. 'I'm not competing.' she pulled out a book from her bag and started reading it, her statement clear, the conversation was over.
A squeal from his daughter caught his attention and the air itself shifted. Draco knew who it was without even looking, and his daughter ran off.
For the first time that evening, he looked along with the Slytherin table. To his surprise, they had gained a cluster of new students, who were swapping stories of their home lives, it wasn't so long ago that he too had done so; well he bragged. His eyes followed the line of students along with the table, sweeping over the second-years, to the seventh surprised by the number of returns Slytherin had. This year would be the hardest for them all, they had, had it so easily last year, the Slytherins had been overlooked, held the superiority. Well with Severus Snape known Death Eater as Headmaster, there was little they could do wrong. Then Draco's eyes settled on a person he hadn't seen since the final battle; Gregory Goyle. Draco merely inclined his head, if Aria was willing to bury the hatchet, then he could do the same, and after all, Goyle owed him one, for saving his life. Goyle would have never made it out, from the Room of Requirement unconscious, but he owed Weasley and Granger more so, for actually saving him.
Aria smiled gently at her, 'That compatible magic is not as complicated as it seems.' Lily frowned, looking a little lost. 'You'll understand when you're a bit older. Let's go home.'
'You can stay as long as you like,' Draco found himself saying, though it was unnecessary, perhaps she needed to hear it though for she responded with a soft thank you.
'You already thanked me for that,' Aria said. 'Now shall we try again, I believe I never introduced myself, I'm Aria Potter, most people know me as the Girl Who Lived, the Chosen One or the as the Wizarding Saviour ... I much prefer being called Aria.'
Aria didn't see what the problem was, Draco's duel was to held in the afternoon. Watching the other duels would be of no use to her, after all for she herself was not competing.
'You know,' Aria said, 'when Cygnus began to question me on the Patronus, I feared that he was going to ask me to do just that.'
Aria took the arm Ron held out for her, she walked with him until Aria abruptly stopped at the door that led to the gardens, ribbons of light blue surrounded it. Charmed blue ribbons in her favourite colour, Aria was sure that it hadn't come up in conversation before. Ron steered her through the doors to the gardens to where blue ribbons greeted them again. Ron stopped at the entrance arch, and tears greeted Aria's eyes, as the marquee which was not only full of friends and family was full of her favorite flowers. If there was ever a doubt that Draco Malfoy loved her, all of them diminished. She was marrying a man who loved her in return and if it had not been for Narcissa's interference, to begin with, none of it would have happened - she and Draco would have never happened.
'OK, so Professor Slughorn wants us to list five uses for Tropaeolum, and I can't seem to find uses for it in Potions anywhere.'
What do you think about the new program Hogwarts wants to do? - well McGonagall wants to do - I think it could be a good idea, a mentoring scheme for us "eighth" years, and the first-years get to choose, you think I might be asked to mentor a lot of firsties? I think that's the only thing I'm not looking forward to turning them down - always hated saying no - well to some things at least. Congratulations on making Head Boy .. be strange to have both eighth and seventh-year students as Head Boy and Girl sharing it but McGonagall didn't want to be unfair. Did McGonagall tell you I turned it down? I'm not sure whether she saw you or me first, wasn't even aware you had been made Head Boy until your letter. But I think it might have upset Hermione if I had got it instead of her - not that she would have expected it but still - lead by example, and well I haven't exactly always set a good one. Do you know what changes are being made in regards to eighth-year accommodations? It was the only thing I could not get out of McGonagall while she was here.
'Maybe,' Aria said thoughtfully, moving her hands so her chin rested upon them. Fleur blinked several times at her wrist.
"Not really, I was always going to be assigned to protecting you. His plan changed you know, you weren't meant to be here. And now his - it's like he's obsessed with keeping you alive for reasons unknown to us. Bella tried the first night to get into your cell. He found her. She learned quickly after that. No one has dared touch you," Draco raised his arm. "but I just couldn't risk them not trying, hence the bracelets."
'I won't lie ...' Aria replied honestly, 'I never thought highly of them, what with Voldemort and his followers ...' Aria gestured to an empty table, and they made their way to it. 'Slytherin has always had a ... reputation ... then I learned that not all Slytherins were the same...' Aria slid into a seat, and Alana took the chair next to her. 'and the hard way, so I won't be judgemental of you because of your House if you won't be judgemental of me.'
'Maybe Malfoy said something,' Luna said, 'to his father - after all Veela's only go for people truly compatible with themselves.'
"I don't want his mark. I don't want him here. I want him gone." Draco muttered, a thoughtful look returning to his face. "We'll need to be careful, we have to get hold of some of your lot somehow. Can't be by post, it's being monitored. He is watching you like a hawk, why do you think I had all the paintings removed from this room, before gifting it to you."
Aria gaped at him, but before she could say anything, Draco wrapped her up in his arms and shielding their surroundings with his wings, so that Aria was unable to see anything and Disapparated them.
'I'm not going to force her, but I will tell her,' Draco found himself saying, from what he remembered the Weasleys twins were not to be messed with unless one wanted to land up on the wrong side of a prank, and even if it was only one of them, Draco did not want to take any chances.
Much to Draco's amusement, Emily had tried to teach Potter some words as they walked around. It soon became apparent that Potter could not pick up on how to pronounce the words. Potter soon got frustrated with herself and gave up attempting to try.
'It's lovely,' she said, and Draco gave a sigh of relief, he gestured for her arm, and picked up the bracelet, she allowed him to slip it over her wrist where it magically resized to fit her delicate frame.
Hermione frowned, Aria could see slight disapproval in Ron's choice of words, but she understood, and if it meant her best friend had finally got gest that compatible magic wasn't making the decisions for her, she would damn well take it.
The sound of the door opening made Draco spin around, Aria froze at the sight of the room, shock written upon her face. She looked at him in hesitation.
Draco was glad when the site tour came, even if he had to get into another damn aeroplane first. Draco had the advantage though when they landed in Rome, thanks to several years of sharing a dorm with Blaise Zabini he had picked up Italian. It seemed though he wasn't the only one who knew the language, Emily did also.
'How -' Draco croaked, he had the right to know - but he did not want to know the answer at the same time, especially if Aria had been with someone - like that.
Aria laughed, though she knew she shouldn't be, and to prove her point her chest started to hurt and a deep chesty cough started up again. It wasn't her fault she was in her current state. She had only been cleaning out Grimmauld Place for Teddy's visit - and well she had decided to tackle Sirius's old bedroom - a huge mistake that turned out to be. Her retort, when she regained herself, fell short as her eyes caught sight of Mrs Weasley's unhappy expression, so Aria politely changed the sentence she had been thinking; 'Bugger off.'
'Yeah,' Neville shrugged running a hand through his hair, 'it's been - it's been good. Ginny told us about your summer. It's true then, you're engaged to Malfoy?'
'Well it's too much if you ask me, first she speaks up for them and now-' Ron said, and he waved his hand gesturing at all of Aria, '- this!'
thought out and made before our engagement started. I've instructed Coeus to wait for your response,
'I was about to ask our guest if he'd like a drink. I was about to make some tea,' Aria said looking in Draco's direction she added, 'or there is coffee if you prefer.' Draco nodded gratefully.
Aria bit her lip, then blurted out before she could stop herself, 'I want the reason as to why you didn't tell me from the beginning - the real reason - not the petty excuse.'
Draco cut Pansy's sentence short as Aria neared, she didn't even glance in his direction, Weasley greeted him with his usual scowl, Granger's eyes flickered from Aria very occasionally to himself and back again. Aria had not spoken to him since their last Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson; Cygnus was going to pay for this. How dare he do this to him!
'Accident my arse. She hates me,' Aria said, 'told me I'd never see Draco's wings when I first met her.'
'Scorpius, why is your dad referring to your mum by her previous last name, I'm a little confused by it.' The whispered question attracted both his own and his wife's attention, the girl his son had brought along with him, Adelaide seemed generally surprised and gulped a little. 'Sorry.'
She did relax as he applied more lotion on her back. She moved her head for him so it could apply some to the back of her neck. And he relished the momentary bliss as his hands swept across her skin - only to frown when he caught sight of what looked like scratches near the base of her back. As her two piece suit had moved to reveal them. Draco then realised that they were not mere scratches but scars.
In reality, she felt like she couldn't, that turning back and hiding under her bed-covers was now the best option. But she was a Gryffindor ... she was Aria Potter ... if she could face down dragons, trolls, Boggart-Dementors, Dementors and breaking into Gringotts, Voldemort and everything else she had done to face down Voldemort, she could run through a barrier that shielded platform nine and three-quarters from Muggles.
Aria nodded and regretted it the moment she did. 'My head is pounding away constantly ... I feel cold all the time.'
Aria shook her head firmly, leaning her head upon his shoulder, her breath hit the hollow of his neck, and Draco wrapped his arms around her again.
There was a small crack, Aria turned her head, facing her house-elf that had appeared by her desk, 'Mistress,'
Draco knew one thing for certain since he set eyes upon the beefy-looking woman, he didn't think much of her or the way in which she had spoken to Aria. Aria stepped out of his way, gesturing to Draco to step through after she exchanged a quick glance with her cousin.
'Miss Potter, what can I do for you?' He did not seem surprised to see her, but Mr Ollivander was ... unusual. 'I do not think you'd required a new wand, I figured you would have brought yourself a new one before your return to Hogwarts.'
The day was a slog. Despite his unusual efforts to reach an empty inbox over the past few weeks, Harry was not actually used to spending hours at a time doing paperwork, let alone proofreading, translating, deciphering, and other activities that required sustained mental focus. Harry regularly found his attention wandering, or realised that he had reached the bottom of a page without paying any attention to it and had to start from the beginning again.
“You didn’t show up to Potions today,” Draco said, pretending to be put out. “There’s only so long you can coast on being the saviour of the wizarding world. Nobody wanted to be my partner, so Slughorn decided to put us together. I’m sure he thought it was hilarious.”
Blaise leaned over to take a sniff of Ginny’s beer and then gave her a disappointed face. “You promised you would order something that wasn’t an IPA tonight. How are we ever going to expand your palate?”
“Mate,” Ron began, but he trailed off. “I dunno. Maybe Hermione’s right and this could be a good thing for you.” He smiled, but Harry had a lot of practice reading his friends by now, and he felt his heart sink. He’d assumed they’d be on his side on this one.
When Harry reached the office at 8:15 am on December 24th, Draco was already sitting at his desk looking productive and alert.
Potter knew how to consciously manipulate dreams. It figured; it was just one more thing in his life that came naturally to him.
“How did you start smoking, anyways?” Harry asked him several minutes later. They were outside, taking in some sunlight and leaning against the studio wall in what Harry now thought of as their customary positions. “No offence, but it’s just not something I ever imagined you getting into.”
“No time like the present!” Draco declared. “Come on, we need to go collect research materials for our assignment. To the library!”
Harry breathes out slowly and brushes past Malfoy to reach the table that holds his lathe. He attaches the dogwood block to it and sets it spinning. “I’m going to start with a large chisel to make a cylinder and find the rough shape of the wand,” he says, hoping that by narrating his steps he’ll be able to ignore the fact that Malfoy is standing only a few steps behind him. He swears he can feel Malfoy’s eyes on his back as he reaches up to grab the chisel off of its wall mount; he is hyper-aware of every movement right now.
“Malfoy?” came a surprised voice. Someone with red hair turned around, and Draco was unsurprised to find Ron Weasley sitting alongside Potter’s bed. “What are you doing here?”
Without looking up from his own parchment, Draco held up a half sandwich that already had a few bites from it. Harry huffed.
The thing about dreams, in Draco’s experience, was that falling was one of the most reliable triggers to radically change the experience. Sometimes it was enough to wake the dreamer up, but Draco suspected that was unlikely for a magically-induced sleep like Potter’s. Draco had bet that Potter’s dream brain was resilient enough to make sense of the new development and get them the hell away from the library.
All was lost. What could Aria do if she wasn't able to use magic against him? If she could not escape. How could she defeat him? Not when the curses aimed at her affected someone else. She understood the threat very well. It would not be a torture curse, no next time it would be the killing curse. Voldemort it seemed understood her too. She would not allow harm to befall anyone, even if that person was her school rival. Draco struggled up from his knees. Aria's green eyes met the grey ones, the same realisation within them. It mattered not that the magic which bound her fell, she was, however, in no case free. It was official, it was the darkest of times.
'Aria!' Draco said, cursing himself for not realising it before. He jumped off the bed and followed Potter's cousin out of the room, to the door next to theirs. The door was open, Emily stood there in her nightdress looking completely terrified.
'Why thank you,' Aria said mocking a bow. 'Hopefully, I put a few people off with my randomness. I couldn't believe it when McGonagall told me how many people had turned up.'
'I didn't know they would put it in the paper,' Aria said, 'I was going to tell you, I swear when I saw you all next.'
Aria took a breath, they had been attempting the Patronus Charm for the last two nights now, and Draco was already beginning to get frustrated with it. How had Remus kept his cool with her when she had demanded to try again and again until she got it right, she will never know. But Aria understood Draco's frustration, but it wasn't like he was going to get it on his first try and Remus had told her not everyone could produce a Patronus.
'Alana,' Aria said calmly, 'my current state has nothing to do with the amount I've taken on. I just haven't been sleeping well, that's all.'
Draco turned at the sound of Aria's voice, he hadn't noticed that she had been watching him practice, since their return to Hogwarts a month ago Draco spent his spare time in an old classroom practicing all the defensive spells he could think of. They were due to take their exams to start the following week, but Draco's mind had been elsewhere and he was slightly frustrated, hence the need to do something practical. That did not, however, stop him from beginning concerned about the woman now stood in the classroom doorway.
Aria had not thought of that - she had not realised that her rejecting his friendship way back in their first year had affected him at all. 'Well, you were being a prick ... Draco. And our first meeting in Madam Malkin's pretty much put me off you -'
Merlin! What had happened to her? Most scars could be healed magically, leaving no trace - even the curse Aria had used against him had not scarred his chest. But this - it had been the reason she had covered herself up - Draco cursed the damn war - for doing this - for scaring her like this. No wonder she had recoiled from his touch.
An Army more like. Aria thought. "I helped some younger students learn some spells when our last professor would not teach us, My Lord."
'You look beautiful,' Draco said his voice thick with awe, 'Well, if you are feeling better, care to join me for a dance.'
'I'd remind you that your mother has warded every single room in the Manor because as you both have now put it, "deserve a bonding", so yes I'm going, it's traditional after all.'
Draco's grey eyes met hers again, which seemed unsure, but Aria did not know why he could be uncertain. 'It has several meanings, loyalty,' he began, 'faithfulness, the knot shape means eternal...' Draco trailed off, Aria glanced at the last knot as he called it, it clearly had another meaning something he was hesitant to share with her. He kissed her cheek swiftly and left her alone with nothing but the Ancient Runes book and her own thoughts.
Hermione gave her a small smile, and continued on with her homework, acting as nothing had happened. Ron however, was wearing the expression as though he was still trying to figure out something but settled upon saying nothing.
Cygnus opened the classroom door and beckoned them all inside, Draco noticed that today was not going to be another practical lesson. He felt utterly disappointed. He wanted another crack at his cousin - and this time Draco was sure that he would not be the one to land upon the floor.
"Aria, is it now?" he said sternly. "tell me the truth. The use of her first name makes me wonder if you've grown attached."
Aria knew she was not the prettiest girl ... that was why she often didn't wear her glasses whilst she was out. When she went into so much trouble trying to tame her hair. Well if she was not good enough for their ... precious Draco, she was not going to stay here a minute longer ... looking like this!
'I grow bored.' The females were finally dragged from the room, entertainment clearly had been filled for the evening. 'Let's all dine now."
Aria spun around, though she knew no harm would come to her, she was slightly surprised to hear the voice. Mrs Malfoy looked as elegant as she always did, Aria raised an eyebrow questionably, for Mrs Malfoy had come alone.
“It’s only the 23rd!” Draco cried at the unfortunate soul who had apparently drawn the short straw for keeping the lights on during the holidays.
“There is something I need to share that has been weighing on me,” Draco said. Harry decided that his soul was going to separate from his body if this dragged on any longer. “I meant to tell you sooner, before the winter holidays, actually, but then there was this case, and I didn’t want to make you feel uncomfortable—”
“Hmmm?” Harry asked, pretending to be deep in thought over a list of Pensieve time codes. He was pretty sure he could see Draco’s eyes narrow, but nothing more was said about the matter.
“Intimidate?” Harry asked, wrongfooted. “I’m not—I’m just here for the class! I had no idea you’d be here.”
“What do you want, Harry?” Draco breathes. His pupils are dilated, and Harry hates that he still can’t look away.
“None of that now,” Malfoy said, leaning forward to close some of the distance between them. “Just keep your gaze on me, nice and steady. You know what a bowl looks like; I know you must have used one once in your life. All you need is that mental image—staring at the wheel won’t will it into being.”
It was mid-afternoon when they arrived at The Burrow. The traditional Christmas Day Quidditch game was underway—as they marched up the path to the front door, they could see the players zooming and dodging through the sky above the back meadow, their whoops and laughter carrying through the crisp winter air.
Harry pushes himself off of where he was leaning against the workbench. This result confirms his suspicions; he doesn’t know of any other reason that a wand containing a hair of the spell caster would ever be viable. “Do a quick cast, please?” he asks. “Just to be thorough.”
Aria re-framed from rolling her eyes, 'yes I heard you, Marge is coming to stay, and she'll be here later on today.'
'Yes, I managed to,' Aria said, 'Only one so far, took me ages to figure it out - even though I had help to understand the magic behind it.'
'I felt like interrupting,' Aria said shaking her head. 'and that I should bloody teach us all ... again.'
Aria was laughing her head off, Draco Malfoy had no idea what he was agreeing to or letting himself in for. But she planned on capturing every moment. So when the falcon had turned up, starting their correspondence just several days ago, Aria had been more than happy to offer to pay for Malfoy. Because Malfoy on an aeroplane was priceless. It was that thought that had her laughing her head off. She had not missed the hints of sarcasm in his letters, or the way her first name had been written in hesitation, the space between the dear and her name was enough to confirm, he had at least paused before settling on addressing her as Aria and not Potter. It was to no surprise when the falcon had turned up that very morning, with another letter from Malfoy attached to it.
'Everyone has been asking me that since we've returned, my mind is not suddenly going to change. I'm not competing.'
Aria reached for her bag and pulled out the letter she had been given this morning, wordlessly handing it over. Draco took the letter but frowned as he read the letter. Aria watched his reaction as he read, his brow narrowed in concentration, and then comprehension filled his stormy grey eyes.
'Ron has a lot of sense thank you very much!' Aria retorted, she took a breath, 'but that is not what I meant.'
'Like how he did not try to kiss you?' Fleur mentioned, holding up the holiday photographs Aria had gotten out to show them, as she only just had them printed. 'Because that's what this looks like.'
Malfoy and skiing turned out to be funnier than Malfoy on an aeroplane. Admittedly she herself had not fared any better but watching Draco make a fool of himself just made her day. Considering their environment, he had been a bit cagey with her since they had landed. Aria supposed she should have told him about the plane, not to have done so may have been slightly mean, but he should have told her about the announcement. Malfoy clearly was pouting, though he had not spoken to her about her little stunt. They decided to hire out everything that would need whilst skiing, though more expensive it saved room on the packing side of things, and with a tour of Europe and ten days in America, well it was just smarter to hire out what they needed for skiing.
She couldn't work out for the life of her what she had woken up for. Aria could understand waking up for a nightmare, but waking up for no reason, and why did it suddenly feel cold? Aria pulled her covers in an attempt to warm herself, falling backward to lay upon her bed once more. She forced her eyes shut, but Aria knew as with the many nights before, that sleep would not come. There was only so much one could do to make themselves fall asleep again, and Aria had tried everything she could think of, including doing her homework. There was only so much homework she could do before her brain decided to explode from an information overload.
'My time is my own,' Aria added, 'If I tell you I'm busy - I'm busy. I'm not changing my plans for you!'
Aria took such a deep breath, her eyes closing as though she was forcing herself to relax, and the question Draco had been about to ask her trailed off. Aria's eyes opened again, her green eyes searching his.
'My grandmother is lovely, my grandfather... I don't think you would have liked very much.' Draco said, 'Father shared his views -'
When he noticed Aria looking around off into the distance in signs of Dudley and Emily's arrival, Draco got out of the pool.
"So six more find and who knows it might be less, the Dark Lord has trusted where he shouldn't have before."
Draco kept an eye on Aria as she played with Teddy, more helped him stand on his own feet whilst he learned to walk. The garden to his aunt's house felt small, but then with the added company for Teddy's first birthday, it would be. Draco, Aria, and his family had not been the only ones to be invited along for the celebration, his aunt had also invited the Weasleys, the Minister, and Granger. The weather was overcast, but all in all, it had been pleasant enough of a day.
'I was taught that it was rude for a guest to bring dirt into someone's home,' Potter retorted, as though she thought, he didn't think she had any manners.
'I know I should have and I am sorry that I didn't, I didn't mean for you to worry,' Aria said moving towards him, 'I took it out, the pins were pinching ... I know it looks a mess and my glasses-'
'So Aria's protected from attacks - just not poisoning - maybe Malfoy should have thought of that,' Ron said, 'look at where she is now - look at what's happened.'
'Oh no, he's got me,' Aria laughed, pretending to pin to the floor, supporting Teddy in a sitting position on her stomach, 'whatever should I do - help! Someone help me - I've been attacked by the strongest little boy in the world!'
'Now it's official,' his mother said, 'Welcome to the family ... you may call me, Narcissa I'm sure Lucius,' she sent his father a look, 'wouldn't mind if you paid him the same favor.'
Aria led them to the lake, her favorite spot to be precise, to the spot that she knew from the other side of the bank she had saved her own soul, and the one belonging to her godfather.
'Well, Dragon,' Aria smirked, despite her lack of imagination, it would have to do, for now, 'Do be sure to owl me, won't you!' I can't wait to tell you, that I have hardly any time to see you.
There were no wards in the Headmaster's office. It was like it wasn't even being used. Aria knew better though. The Marauders Map told her that her current Headmaster did access this room. Just because she was alone didn't mean she trusted the conversation would say amongst themselves.
Yes, but I wouldn't put it past him, Aria thought. 'I'm just covering all the bases so that everything is clear.'
"I've watched the Dark Lord torture my mother Potter," Draco whispered, "I can't stand watching it either, I dislike it immensely and I hate him."
The reason as to why he felt so relaxed came to him, as they neared France. Because from Paris they would be getting on an aeroplane to America from there. America which he knew he wouldn't get away with wearing long-sleeved tops. Potter's cousin and his girlfriend didn't judge him on his past mistakes - despite any threats Potter's cousin made, nothing had been said about the mark upon his arm. The mark he had taken to keep his family alive. Surely if they saw it, they would ask about it. And Draco was sure Potter had not told her cousin that he was once on the dark side of their war, he doubted her cousin would have threatened him if he had known. Draco had tried everything to cover up the Dark Mark tattoo that now scarred his arm. In the end, he had to make do with long sleeve shirts to hide the hideous thing.
And Aria thought carefully, remembering, "I, who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality." Aria ran a hand through her hair, "that is why he didn't die when he tried to kill me."
It was kill or be killed in Voldemort's world. Aria would choose Draco or death any day over Voldemort's rein too. Draco had after all proven that much to her.
Draco did not miss the hidden meaning behind what Aria had been really saying, she was advising him not to speak until she had got back. But something was going on, for Dudley kept eyeing the door Aria went through - Draco presumed to led to the kitchen. Her aunt too had been eyeing the door
'I've been asking myself that same question -' Aria said, 'do you fancy going through the barrier with me?'
'You were there when Aria broke into the Ministry and broke all the Muggle-borns out.' Draco realised, 'So that's what this year has been about - you've been wanting to repay the debt you owe to her for saving your compatible match.'
'Oh, he knows it ... don't worry - he's being smart enough not to say anything,' Aria said, 'Serves him right, for not telling me - though I don't think his mother gave him much of a chance to.'
Granger entered the square, calling out "Ravenclaw", Susan Bones called out "Gryffindor!", Tracy Davis from Slytherin, also called out "Ravenclaw", Longbottom called out "Hufflepuff" but Aria shocked them all when she stepped into the white square and called out "Slytherin!".
'Is that why - why you didn't protest to your mother's - arrangement?' she turned her head, she looked sad, how was it possible for one person to go through so many emotions at once? Draco braced himself - if she had finally worked out the meaning behind the bracelet or was told about it, then she knew what he was, knew that the debt could not be paid this way - but the hex he braced himself for never came.
Aria forced herself to take a breath. Draco was asking her such a ridiculous question considering that both of them were now in a guest room of Malfoy Manor.
'What do you want to do, after Hogwarts?' Aria said, the question slipped out before she had a chance to stop herself.
Draco knew an accusation when he heard one, especially when it came from The Dark Lord. "We've been completing our homework, it is NEWT levels we're studying for, I wish to be prepared. Aria accompanies me -"
'Forget about it,' Ron said, looking around at the shattered bits and pieces on the floor, 'but you could tell us what has you so upset you felt like blowing up half of the room of requirement.'
How dare he! If Blaise had not tugged on his arm, Draco was sure he would have shot to his feet in outrage.
'I didn't do anything - you did!' Cygnus said, 'And Draco, I've changed my mind, you've got yourself a detention -'
Fleur let out a sweet-like laugh, 'Well no one understands it better than I, you are most welcome though.'
'Explains - a lot.' Aria said, 'his family doesn't seem to think much of me - well his cousins at least Mr Malfoy ... he's been rather odd.'
They chatted some more, the trolley lady passed by, Neville and Aria were discussing the new eight-year common room and dorms when Hermione and Ron returned.
'I was thinking of getting you an emerald to match your eye colour, but as ruby happens to be your birthstone as well as Gryffindor's colour ... it seemed fitting.'
Prongs stood tall and proud, bowing his antlered head. Aria caught Draco's smirk of triumph at knowing better. Git! Aria thought.
"Albania!" Aria said thinking. "Quirrell went into the Albanian Forrest, Hagrid told me that rumours believed the Dark Lord was in hiding there. And well Quirrell found him or the Dark Lord found Quirell more like."
"Don't you want to escape?" Neville said. "We can get that damn choker off you once we've got you to safety."
'To bond with you?' George clarified. 'She has a right to know that is the only way to stop magical withdrawal.'
'Thank you,' Draco nodded curtly before settling himself down in an armchair next to his friends in the eighth-year common room.
A tap on the window made Aria look up, usually, Aria left the window open, but with the way she was shivering, she did not actually want to catch anything. She was about to get up, when she caught sight of the familiar-looking bird, to be precise a very familiar-looking falcon, she happened to know to belong to Draco Malfoy. The very last person she wanted to hear from.
'And then there was the announcement of our engagement,' Aria said, 'I didn't get a choice in it - I never had a chance to tell everyone before it went out -'
'I have conditions,' Aria replied quickly, a little too quickly. Malfoy courting her might be the best way out of this, but that didn't mean she would let them run or change anything about her or her life. 'If I agree to this. Ma - your son,' she stopped herself from calling him Malfoy before it was too late to disrespected them within their own home. Though she could not bring herself to call him by his first name. 'Is not - not to insult my friends. I don't want to hear it, any of it. One word, one insult and I call this off.' Aria said as firmly as she could manage. 'I don't care what I have to give you instead Mrs Malfoy, but I can promise you I won't be marrying - courting or in any way shape or form, be in a relationship with your son.'
'I don't know what I want to do either,' Aria said, once again not looking at him, 'I had it all planned out, join the Aurors - hunt down Vol-,' she shook her head, stopping herself from calling him Voldemort, she was pretty sure Malfoy wouldn't appreciate hearing it - not after having to live with him, 'it seemed to make sense, it no longer does. I guess that's the reason I chose to go back so I could figure it out.'
'Well, he - you - I didn't know he was a Veela or that we had compatible magic. I know why and I can understand it - I just wish -'
A crowd surrounded the dueling stage, the dueling tournament had come to an end, which left Draco frowning at the stage. The tournament trophy had been handed out sheer moments ago to the winner. That person was not himself.
Aria laughed, 'And get me in trouble when they find out where you've been. I've had enough trouble for a lifetime, thanks.'
Aria's step faltered, she had a deep look of thoughtfulness upon her face. 'Not everything about us has to be complementary, it makes sense that yours is a husky. They can be quite independent and rise to a challenge. A Patronus is a reflection of one's self, Draco. You can tell a lot about a person from it.'
'I was going to tell Aria after dinner, as we were running behind,' Draco informed his mother. Aria glared at him.
Aria shocked her head. "He bullied and kept the tokens of his victims. That's why Dumbledore wanted us to see that particular memory. The Dark Lord wouldn't contain his soul in any old thing. It would be meaningful."
'What you really meant was you wanted to get back to Potter,' Blaise teased, 'Man you've got it bad.'
'How are preparations with my mother coming along?' Draco asked though he had input on their upcoming bonding, Aria deserved to have a bonding she wanted - though somethings Draco was unable to provide her with, like not having the bonding at the Manor. The deep sigh and the frustrated groan had not been the reply Draco had expected.
'You dare tell me to calm down ... when you've caused all this!' Draco ragged, tackling Cygnus, making them both tumble to the ground. In his rage, Draco had forgotten all about his cousins' wand. The only thing holding Draco back from tearing his cousin apart was the very fact Aria would never forgive him, something that Cygnus took to his advantage in the next instant as his cousin also transformed and Draco was flung away from Cygnus.
It took Aria a long moment to realise why Mrs Weasley who was looking at her in such a concerned manner and had asked her that particular question, Aria had barely eaten anything. Aria looked away, she was unsure what to say - for where did she start, she should have said certain things months ago, but she had not wanted to upset the Weasleys any further. As far as she was concerned she had caused them enough pain.
'Here, give me your hand,' he said holding out his own before her. Aria glared up at him from the chair he had rested her in.
Doors were opened and slowly students starting to disembark from the Express onto the platform. Draco caught sight of the striking blond hair, his son one of the tallest in the crowd due to the fact that he happened to be in his last year. The family resemblance between them was uncanny if only the same could be said for -
'Aria, lovely to see you,' his mother welcomed her, 'has Draco told you about the ball we are holding in honour of your engagement?'
'Oh like how you did?' Aria pointed out, glaring at him again. Draco had conjured a bowl and some cotton wool, and he summoned a potion non-verbally, which he poured into the bowl.
The magic surrounding her became suddenly warmer. Yes ... she could get used to his magic and the shield it wrapped around her.
"I'd rather have my goddaughter back and out of Voldemort's slimy hands," Sirius said. "I don't get why he hasn't killed her. What made his plan change. So with this new form of communication-"
"Drop the pretenses and let me in Potter," Draco murmured, nodding towards the door. "I came to see how you were, you looked ill throughout dinner and you didn't eat much."
'No, he didn't,' Aria said, glad for her friend's support, well technically there was no Ron as this was a girly night. Aria had invited Hermione, Ginny, and Fleur around, Grimmauld Place felt empty and rather lonely after having spent so much time in other people's company.
Andromeda had felt awkward going to Malfoy Manor, so Draco had instead ended up in a humble house. His mother and aunt were currently drinking tea watching in slight amusement at Aria's antics. Who was sprawled out on the floor playing with her godson, with a pile of baby toys surrounding them? The only reason Draco had joined them was that his father had gone also. Draco was sure that it was the last place his father wanted to be, but he supposed it was better than being in a small room at Saint Mungo's with the Weasleys.
Mrs Weasley gave her a tentative glance, her hand reached up to Aria's forehead, stopping Aria's fingers from massaging her temple, she pressed her hand against Aria's head. 'Well, you don't feel like you're burning up. Perhaps you should lay down just in case ...'
'The only fool was me,' Aria said, 'When I was younger, I thought that if I did well ... if I could just do one thing to please them, that I could change how my aunt and uncle felt ... nothing was ever good enough. I gave up in the end, I realised that no matter what I did, I was never going to be as precious as their little Dudley.' Draco caught her rolling her eyes. 'I didn't know anything ... completely ignorant of magic - they told me that it wasn't real and I was punished if anything freaky happened - if I cast accidental magic, not that I knew what I was doing, of course. Dudley was a shit that made school life hell ... then I'd returned to get even more of it back at theirs. It was never home to me. They couldn't care less about me, well not Dudley, not now.'
'It is with great pleasure that I can announce that at the end of the school year, once the exams have taken place, Hogwarts will be holding a dueling tournament -'
'Saving the wizarding community does that,' Draco said, rolling his eyes, what else had Blaise been expecting.
' ... magical bonds have mostly happened in duels, though that is not always necessary. I am of course talking of which where a person's life is spared, the bond we know as a life-debt. Life-debts originate from duels, for in ancient times a wizarding duel was to the death, a witch or wizard would spare their opponents life intent on using the life-debt to their advantage, using it for a later duel or to enslave someone. As being spared your life was considered a complete disgrace.' Neumann paused. 'Nowadays, people have more understanding and consideration for each other, and slavery is illegal, that life-debts are uncommon. But as I said, a life-debt doesn't have to happen within a duel. One person can save another person's life and the same bond, the same debt will occur.'
Her name had been spoken softly, and she could for the first time feel a touch of concern about his magic.
To top it all off Draco was still swapping tentative glances with Aria and it was days after their first kiss. Draco discovered that Aria had a smile that she would only use after they exchanged glances. It was like having a secret that only the two of them shared.
Aria rolled over, giving up, nope sleep would not welcome her. Back to the good old drawing board, if anything could get her to sleep it was reading a potions book, or if she could find one laying about in the common room, any copy of Hogwarts A History would do. Because as much as Hermione loved to quote from it, there was nothing more boring than history.
'Like the Shielding Charm -' George said, 'it's basically a Shield Hat or Cloak, like the ones we-I have got in store.'
'No,' Aria replied, shaking her head, 'It doesn't. One of my best friends is Muggle-born and she's the best in our year.'
'You do, however, make an excellent point,' she added, and Aria looked up at her hopefully. 'You both do not know each other well.' Aria took a breath of relief, 'I think it is wise we change that.'
'I'm fine,' Aria said, 'absolutely fine, and I would have been even without your wings!' she snapped, 'now, however, is not the time for me to remind you, that you are an idiot. I need to get you to the hospital wing.'
Aria closed her eyes, she was beginning to really detest life debts. If Goyle ever found out that Ron had only turned around because she had ... well she didn't need Goyle tailing her too.
"Not entirely. She looks outside like she misses the fresh air as though she may never feel it on her skin again." Draco said. "We study, for our NEWT's. For I mainly use it as a distraction My Lord."
He wanted this moment to last forever. More than anything he wanted to keep her safe. He spent most of this war worrying that she would end up dead. That he would lose her without ever really having her. Draco's fingers tightened around her curls almost on instinct as the sinking feeling settled around him. He would not have much longer, he would not have a choice. It disturbed him knowing what was coming, would Aria trust him afterward. Grant him the small mercy of falling asleep in his presence and allow him to be close to her, just as he was now.
'I can't bring myself to cry,' Aria turned so she could face Draco. She bit her lip. 'I can't help feeling that it makes me a bad person.'
'His magic,' Draco said, giving a shudder at the thought of it, 'it's similar to my own ... which makes his compatible ...'
'Sorry,' she mumbled as she put her glasses on. Potter was still trembling, and she pulled at the bed-cover, but it did not seem to be so she could cover herself - more as a source of comfort. 'Nightmare - didn't mean to wake you.'
Aria headed to a deserted corner ... or what she hoped would be a deserted corner of the library ... and stumbled as she collided with a small life form, as she turned along with one of the bookshelves.
'You look - wow!' Ron said shrugging his shoulders at her, 'Malfoy better appreciate you.' Aria read between the lines, she knew he meant; "It's not too late you know, you can still back out."
Aria's new entourage managed to protect her all the way to the Great Hall of Hogwarts. The plans to overthrow the Ministry altogether had been successful that now Voldemort had a watchful eye on all the witches and wizards' children. It had become mandatory to attend Hogwarts. Umbridge as far as Aria had heard was in charge of questioning Muggleborns. The evidence of Voldemort's accomplishments was clear as Aria looked around the Great Hall during the sorting. The youngest Weasley's were there, Hermione, however, was missing as were several muggle-borns. They were either now in Azkaban or in hiding. Though from what Aria gathered Voldemort was very confident that those in hiding would not stay that way for long.
'I actually like that.' Aria said blinking at him a little, as though combining the names so simply would not have occurred to her. 'Now I best get on over to The Burrow the Weasleys are expecting me. I'll see you in a couple of days.'
Aria cringed, Voldemort had been calling her that since her capture, though always in Parseltongue. Aria was uncertain of the reason behind it, it wasn't in Voldemort's nature to be careful with his choice of wordings, so whether it was because she could understand Parseltongue that he choose to speak it or whether it was because it caused fear and shivers from his supporters. Aria guessed it might have been both, Voldemort after all craved power. What she couldn't understand was why he hadn't killed her. What this was all about? Unless it was some type of weird delayed gratification.
'And Goyle's,' Granger said, 'Ron would have never turned around in that fire if Aria hadn't. Goyle owes her the life-debt really, not us.'
She should have suspected nothing good would come off, Professor Neumann informing them, of a dueling challenge. As they had learned the counter-spells to the hexes and minor jinxes that they had learned, Professor Neumann had thought that it would be a good ice-breaker. Aria thought better of joining in with how tired she was feeling.
'I know the theory behind wands, how the core and tree have to be compatible to allow for a wand to be created.' Narcissa said, 'My grandfather, his knowledge was vast, very vast. He knew information, enough that when it became clear I was Lucius's match, that my grandfather could ease my concerns. Very much was expected of me considering Andromeda's compatible match. I lost a sister, I could not -' Narcissa paused, 'I am not strong like you, so of course I choose the rest of my family. Followed Lucius, giving him all the support I could - I thought we were right.'
It had been a week since she actually learned from Draco exactly what spells she could cast via her wand. It was more than she actually thought she would have been allowed. More than Voldemort had told her. The reason behind that had been who had restricted her wand in the first place.
Tonight had been no different, unable to get to sleep, in the dead of the night Aria, had crept to the little sitting-room in their cabin they had been given and sat by the fire.
' ... I do not have the words, for they seem to fail me, for how could I even begin to describe the selflessness of those who bravely fought, that bravely stood up in our darkest hours ... words, they are not enough ... will never be enough to describe. I, however, will not regret that I could not have done more, to do so would be an insult to those who gave their lives, to those who battled and died believing that they were fighting to bring about a better future ...'
'The sprouting blossom represents growth -' Aria felt her cheeks heat up a little under Draco's intense gaze, which had been the first one Aria figured out and without any help from a book. She cleared her throat, feeling a little awkward, and pointed at another. 'This one means sanctuary.'
'No, I said it was,' Fleur corrected, 'And it doesn't work like that. It protects only from harm - physical harm - minor jinxes and hexes.'
It seemed everywhere Aria turned she would be casting Non-verbal spells to avoid unwanted attention. Aria would be casting spells in her DADA and because Voldemort had made it compulsory Muggle-studies classroom the classes the Carrows taught. Aria also cast spells as she walked the halls and at the rate, she was going she would be soon casting spells in her sleep. Protecting the students of Hogwarts, whilst secretly trying to take down Voldemort without looking like she was doing anything was exhausting. Because when she wasn't casting spells she was running around either in class or the middle of the night nicking ingredients from the potions cupboard with Draco. There was never seemed to be a day Aria wasn't breaking some type of school rule because never before had she actually meant to be breaking them. Aria no longer cared because Dumbledore was no longer in charge and she felt it was her moral obligation to break them if it meant the defeat of Voldemort. Polyjuice ingredients were needed so often now, as she was using it on a daily occurrence: for how was she to sneak out in daylight without her loving protection Voldemort had provided with otherwise. Aria and Draco brewed the potion in the secret of darkness in one of the tunnels that had George and Fred told Aria long ago had collapsed. Aria figured that this tunnel would be the one most likely to no be heavily watched. And she was right. Voldemorts defenses of the castle were not as extensive as he believed if Aria could move about this freely.
'I've heard so much about how your activities ... though a little unorthodox ... is bringing the whole of Hogwarts together. We have accomplished so much since the defeat of the Voldemort ... but we as a community still have so far to go. We have a lot to learn but with each step we take, will strive to do better to put our differences aside so that we can learn to be better people.'
Draco slumped back, in a manner she had never seen him use before, so that he rested upon a desk of the classroom they had been using. Aria wondered if the question was rhetorical or if he had actually been asking her, Aria moved so that she rested upon a desk near his.
The silence resumed after the Weasleys had left, his mother looked as though she couldn't quite believe what was happening and his father showed no difference, just his usual cool expressions.
Ron nodded, then gave the messages a thoughtful look. "We need to hide these messages so that only we can read them. And we need to figure out what they actually mean."
Draco pulled out the chair beside her, slumping in it slightly like he hadn't had a care in the world. He raised his eyebrows, tilting his head upwards, gesturing to her to continue without speaking.
The holidays had arrived and Draco had grown impatient of waiting for a reply. Which is how he had come to be heading down the same street he had been appeared in during the summer. He had waited a couple of days after the day he had known the funeral to be, but Draco was not going to wait any longer. He should have done this, to begin with ... go after her - the first moment he had got the chance to. He had known her well enough to realise that she wouldn't return his letters with one of her own. He should have realised that he would have to speak with her one on one to explain ... everything.
Draco half-listened as McGonagall did the start of term speech after the sorting had taken place. He just about heard where the eighth-year common room and dorms were as he was too busy frowning - What the fuck was his cousin doing here? Because he did not think it was to teach Defence Against the Dark Arts for one second.
The heavy sigh and yawn made Aria look up from the book she was currently reading. Ron was looking slightly drowsy and his head was a mess from where he clearly had been running his hand through it, which caused Aria to laugh.
"It displeases me to see you like this, Aria," Voldemort said. He had been doing that a lot too, using her first name though she had ever given him permission to refer to her by her first name. It was like he thought he didn't need it. "It was not like we could trust you, that is until the most unlikely opportunity arose. One that sets you free from this chair and allows for you to have your wand."
The silence was eerie, broken by the soft sounds of breathing. Three people sat quietly, two of them, a young male in his late teens, with blond hair and grey eyes; the other his mother, also blond gazed at the youngest woman in the large room.
Draco understood what his grandmother meant, Aria baffled him at the best of times, but the respect people had for her - she had never demanded it, but people had done so regardless.
If it was possible Snape’s face went even paler and hot fury burnt in his black eyes, “You’re parents are very much alive, and they were not drunks. Your mother was one of the kindest people I have ever known.”
One wild cart-ride later Harry was a pocket full of gold heavier and Snape had collected one small grubby package.
Harry nodded and straightened up, and anything he was about to say was silenced immediately. He stared in awe at the surrounding street.
“I’m certainly not letting you stay here, no matter what the headmaster says. This is no place for a child.” Snape practically growled.
Snape exhaled slowly. Child abuse was one thing he couldn’t stand, especially because he himself was a victim of it in his youth.
Harry had already gathered that muggles were the wizarding word for non-magical people, “No both my parents were magical, but they couldn’t look after me so I was sent to my muggle aunt and uncle’s house.”
Once safely shut in his cupboard Harry took a deep breath and slid his arm under his mattress, trying to feel for the thick parchment.
Once his family had settled down to eat, Harry stayed standing in the corner of the room. He meekly bowed his head, not wanting to catch the eye of his uncle or cousin.
Harry pressed his ear to the keyhole on his cupboard door. He wanted to hear exactly what was about to happen.
As Harry’s eyes got used to the light he saw that the stranger was an almost sickly looking man, with pale skin and gaunt cheekbones, and there was something harsh and hawk-like in his hard stare.
The rest of the Dursley’s breakfast passed smoothly and before long Vernon was preparing to leave for work, and Dudley was getting ready for school.
“We’re going to apparate, which can be uncomfortable, especially for first timers. So hold onto me tightly,” said Snape as he extended his arm towards Harry.
When Harry re-entered the kitchen he was sure his family would somehow know what he’d done, but they just continued to contently munch on their breakfasts none the wiser.
Harry actually preferred it that way. It was much better than being noticed. Because any attention paid to him was usually negative, and he always ended up coming away with a few extra bruises when that happened.
On the way to Ollivanders Draco’s mother joined them. She possessed all the glacial beauty of a snowflake, but she seemed far from delicate. Her hair was so blonde it was nearly white and Harry could see Draco had inherited her sharp cheekbones and grey eyes. She introduced herself to Harry as Narcissa.
“Well you’re certainly not here for wands,” Ollivander then turned towards Harry and Draco – who both looked rather nervous.
Harry Potter groaned as his aunt rapped smartly on his cupboard door. She always got him up early on Mondays because he had to cook a full fried breakfast for the family. But despite slaving away at the stove he was never allowed a plate for himself. Harry wasn’t allowed those luxuries. Freaks like him didn’t get bacon and eggs.
“And you’re too young to stay at the Leaky Cauldron on your own,” Snape heaved a monumental sigh, “I suppose the only option is for you to come home with me.”
Harry just nodded and stuck close to Snape as they made their way up the busy street. A snowy white building soon loomed out over the squat shops, Harry stared at it with reverence. He’d never seen such a grand building in all his life.
Little Opal didn’t like it at all, and once they landed she burrowed into the crook of Harry’s neck hissing in fear.
Snape looked on with cool amusement, “I took the liberty of collecting your books and potion ingredients for you, Potter. You just need a wand now, and if you are so inclined you’re allowed a pet at Hogwarts.”
However, the rich smell of the soup soon pulled Harry’s attentions away from his familiar and towards his grumbling stomach.
The reptile witch showed Harry and Snape a variety of snakes, but a small albino corn snake caught Harry’s eye.
Harry handed over five galleons for Opal and walked out of the shop, it was now nearly dusk and the sun was low in the sky.
Harry darted down the hall and into the first room, as he stepped through the doorway the lamps immediately flickered on. They illuminated a living room with an ornate fireplace, a long elegant settee, and several old Victorian style armchairs. The walls were also completely covered in books. They ranged from old dusty ones with peeling leather covers to recipe books and ancient Greek myths.
However, they soon reached the wand shop. It was the last shop on the street, and it was rather disappointingly shabby looking. Peeling gold letters arched over the door read
To Harry's astonishment a tiny figure popped out of nowhere and curtsied at Snape. It had big round eyes and bat-like ears.
Harry had dared hoped that maybe, just maybe, there was someone out there who wanted him. Who wanted to take him away from this dreadful family, but it was just an elaborate hoax.
Harry handed Vernon the mail and went to stand in the corner again, excitement bubbling inside his chest like a fountain.
The stranger rolled his eyes, “Potter I’m not an enemy, I’m here to take you away from this suburban hellhole.”
Harry knew that he should probably be polite to this stranger, he could be dangerous, but he couldn’t help asking, “Who are you?”
An old man seemed to appear out of nowhere. His wide pale eyes shone like twin moons through the gloom of the shop.
Harry shrugged, “Most muggles are okay, but my aunt, uncle and cousin are horrible. They didn’t even tell me I was a wizard. In fact I only found out today. And only because Professor Snape turned up at my house to collect me.”
Swiftly following the order Harry fetched the juice from the fridge and poured it into his cousin’s glass. The smell made Harry’s mouth water.
