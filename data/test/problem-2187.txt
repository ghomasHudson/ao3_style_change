“But I would understand if you wanted to go back to yours to enjoy the evening with her.” he added, to cut short the discussion.
So, Harry reached out his hand, already raised, to caress Malfoy’s cheek and grabbed his neck to bring him firmly back to him, sticking his lips against his own in a feverish kiss.
OoOoOoOo
Draco noticed that Harry had not pulled out his wand when he asked him that. He just stood there, looking at him, obviously expecting him to obey.
Harry will loosen his arms, bringing them back along his flanks, raising his eyebrows.
"Good night, Harry" she blew, turning down the hallway, leaving the door open.
He was about to put his hand on Malfoy’s dick and he didn’t feel ready to do it. Harry tried to remove his fingers, but this one tightened his wrist to keep him from moving.
Harry almost choked drinking his drink and coughed while wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. He set his eyes on George who winced and gave a friendly pat on Neville’s head before giggling in his turn.
"Hey, Potter!" he hemmed at the Survivor's back.
“Why Malfoy? Are we ashamed of having succumbed? Shame of having folded before Voldemort?” Harry jeered, who felt his anger rising in spite of him.
“Do I have to sit on the couch for you to pay attention to me?” Draco had jeered, raising an eyebrow.
Draco swallowed hard as he gradually moved away from Potter’s arms and turned his heels to the window where the dummies were exposed.
Somehow, this distance with her suited him, he didn’t have to pretend to appreciate the act as much as she wanted.
“That day will never come
Malfoy didn’t move, but grinned to see him dare him.
’s problem.
“It might be complicated, indeed… Because, as far as I’m concerned, I want it to continue, you know?
“Some of them, yes, not you?”
Later that evening, he went up to his room quietly, belly full of Molly’s feast, when Ginny caught him on the stairs to take him to her room before locking it.
But the pain that he could read in the grey orbs was almost palpable. It almost hurt him so much that it seemed deep.
“But… who could…?” he began, before being abruptly interrupted.
, feel Malfoy’s breathe against his lips.
He winced thinking of this gesture that disgusted him and awakened his desire for Malfoy.
“You’ve just arrived and you’re already breaking the rules! Coming from you, the opposite would have surprised me,” he laughed.
He looked down on the vial he was still holding before putting it back up and putting it on the bedside table next to his bed. He looked at the white sheets of mediocre quality compared to those of his four-poster bed which he was anxious to find.
"Harry, tell me what happened?" Hermione asked in a soft voice.
A look that cried out for him.
“What, it’s not clear enough? You got what you wanted, it’s my turn now” Harry incited, opening his zipper.
"Don’t be silly, I wasn’t going to kill you."
Harry then lifted his glass to his lips and let the bitter taste of mead invade his mouth before feeling the sweet touch of honey soften the whole. It took him only two sips to drink it all and he rested it in a small tinkle on the bar.
"And so it is," assured Malfoy, scowling at him.
She gave him one last kiss before she left.
Harry paused to sigh and resumed his slow, calculated walk.
Malfoy made a little sneer before he walked through the door, Harry on his heels.
His perspiration mixed with the cold from outside froze his limbs. He was no longer able to go any further at this time.
His magic lost its flow, lost its strength, Harry lost his gift while his imagination drove him mad. The tears of anger rose up in his eyes, feeling his power leaving his body, the light in the hollow of his hand fading away. The dizziness took place, blurring the vision of Malfoy and Noah in his mind.
He searched for a moment without ever finding him. He was eventually going to give up when he heard voices arrive on the side of the building.
Draco was convinced he was here, taking care to cast the safety spells to keep him from getting out.
He walked up to the door and was about to open it when the wizard therapist’s voice was ringing in his back.
Harry avoided him skilfully, bounding on him, to grab his wrists, laughing, as Malfoy struggled against him. Harry was always laughing, squeezing his fingers on Malfoy’s wrists as he struggled to get out. Malfoy started a movement, causing him to lose his balance and Harry fell on him, his body stick to his.
Harry raised his glass in turn, raising his eyebrows.
“Of course! He may be crazy, but he’s a genius and he’s always been able to explain the unlikely events that happened at this bloody school.”
Harry made a slight grin before lowering his eyes and shaking his head, immediately raising it to look at his best friend.
He had the confirmation when this friend, passed a hand in Malfoy’s hair to put a strand behind his ear with such delicacy that this it was almost indecent.
Harry hurried so he wouldn’t have to face the people who made them. But to his great dismay, his ill-placed curiosity failed to stop him from leaving a glance at the noises that were becoming more and more explicit as he advanced.
He thought he was done with all this “enemy” bullshit, Potter and Malfoy, Gryffindor and Slytherin…
Ron took a disgusted pout.
“I’m wasting my time…”
.” he jeered, leaning against his desk.
Nott then took the floor, to break the discomfort that was settling.
Malfoy suddenly took off his hand and Harry heard himself growling to lose this pleasant sensation against his skin. Malfoy then took his shirt between his fingers and pulled him closer to him. Just enough to make their noses practically stick.
“And you, definitely in bad faith!”
“You’re often in your thoughts and I feel that you are more distant with Ginny” Ron added.
“This is indeed what I was thinking. It seems to affect us more than we would like…”
“Because
An atmosphere of madness was hovering in the air, under the shouts and cheers of the students seated in the stands where he, Ron and Hermione were recently installed.
…” He ends up, with difficulty between his teeth.
No, he actually preferred to stay in his room rather than be locked in here... Harry shook his head against his indecisive mind... He just wanted to stop thinking about Malfoy and he was looking for an occupation so that Malfoy would leave his thoughts and let him live his fucking life.
They took advantage of the restful calm and the sounds of the many birds in the trees, feeding their chicks or repairing their nests to face the bitter cold surrounding them.
They ate in silence, both too disturbed to dare to break it. Draco struggled to calm the beating of his heart, which seemed to resonate on all the walls of the room, beginning with his ears, to the point of covering the noises of cutlery scraping food.
The more he thought of the scene of the day before when Malfoy, in the company of Noah, had stared at him with an empty gaze as if Harry had been non-existent, the more the burn had intensified over the hours.
Harry’s breath stuck in his as he stared at that grey-angled gaze. Her hands had become sweaty and the one still holding the door, slipped a little around the handle.
All he remembered was a troubled teenager looking for a place in the middle of the war. A miserable coward fleeing his responsibilities, daring not to face his family, for fear of suffering more than regrettable consequences.
Fully aware that he was lying to himself, he could not help but repeat that he had only used a spell invented by a certain
Harry walked slowly, without really looking where to go, his steps leading him to his dorm as his brain dictated.
Harry weighed the issue, then nodded, moving to point his wand at Malfoy’s neck.
Malfoy said nothing, look at him with a slight smile on the corner of his lips, blushed for having sucked so much Harry.
He struggled on the couch and groaned while trying to loosen his painfully contracted muscles from the night he had spent away from his own bed.
“I’m sure he’s up to something... He always has something in mind, that fucking ferret,” Ron snorted.
Potter sighed, turning completely to face him.
OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoO
Harry stared at them for a moment, frowning, thinking he could see some pain shining in their depths.
“Cut the crap, it’s just practice, I’m no better than anyone else.”
“I’m going to make breakfast, Ron should be here any minute” he said, before moving in his direction.
“I’m sorry I did it…” he said in a determined tone.
After making sure he was clear enough in his gestures, he released the pressure of his arms on Malfoy, making him lower and return to his original position, keeping his mouth against his own.
"So Potter, what do you want, this time? Or rather, what do you want again
Malfoy was a few meters away, surrounded by his friends, a cigarette between his fingers. He looking down on him, in a most neutral expression, before turning his gaze to put it on Parkinson who had called him.
He got up slowly, his legs still shaking, barely supporting him. Once he had properly done his hair, smoothed his clothes and took a deep breath, he went to the kitchen to make tea.
Everything seemed more harmonious now that he had matured and without knowing why, Harry found that it was much better for him like that. He even went so far as to think that Malfoy was a rather attractive man if we looked closer.
"Well, I’m taking the risk!" Harry said, a glimmer of challenge in his green eyes.
Harry remained silent, his eyes fixed on those of his ex-enemy who still smiling. Malfoy had this strange and unspeakable look that made Harry almost uncomfortable.
He let Harry pass by, before closing the door, casting a protective spell, in case of that he was considering not listening to him. 'Cause you shouldn’t have fooled yourself, after what Potter saw, he’d probably want to go back…
Harry then pushed the door with his foot, looking for any possible attack or repulsive spells.
“Thank you” Harry blew, from bed, without turning around.
"In fact, I thought that was why you were always so stingy with me despite the end of the war… I would have thought that after this our rivalry would also have ended… I was obviously mistaken," Potter said in a sigh.
Frowning, he lifted up his eyes and planted them in Malfoy’s eyes and froze when he met his eyelids, his head leaning backwards while his lips half-open let out some pronounced gasps.
It drained him of smiling, while the fear ate his bowels but he did not want to worry more his friends who had spent two months moping over his health.
“Yes Harry, we are on the right track! And this time we will succeed in catching them”
"Cowardly!" Malfoy shouted at him, laughing. He then turned to Harry, who was clenching his fists and glancing at him. “Breathe Potter, or I think the vein on your forehead will burst,” he sneered.
Draco swallowed hard at these scathing remarks.
He was about to close the door when he passed his face through the crevice with a sneer.
He did not want to rush Harry by telling him about the trouble he had felt earlier during their altercation. Draco knew it was new to him, he remembered again the first time he had could feel the envy he had for him and he had answered in favor of it…
He tried to answer her, but the words died in the back of his throat, only to pull out a small sound strangled and he carried his hand to his neck by reflex.
“Anyway, he doesn’t look at you like he wants to finish you off right away.”
He fell heavily on his knees in front of the toilet bowl, still held by Malfoy, crouching behind him, feeling his throat burn while a warm liquid rose up.
“Just a courtesy call, that’s all. But judging from the tone of your voice, I feel like I’m not welcome?” he replied, raising a skeptical eyebrow.
Harry began to strike in his bed to remove the rage that was awakening inside him.
Even Ginny’s sweet words did not seem to satisfy the ill-being that had dug into his head. Because he felt bad. And he didn’t understand why he was still haunted by all this.
Tonight, he would surrender to him.
“Fuck, yes!” he swore in the void, before rushing to the door.
Malfoy sighed before deigning to continue.
“It wasn’t fair, I didn’t have my wand to defend myself!” Harry growled.
“Hmhm…” Malfoy whispered, against his skin.
Harry frowned and turned sharply.
“There’s going to be a Quidditch game next week.” Ginny interrupted her, in a strong and hard voice to cover his own.
Blaise repressed a smile before turning his eyes again at Potter.
More than a month now that Malfoy was acting as if he simply didn’t exist and that had really put his nerves on edge. He didn’t understand at what point Malfoy had decided to simply ignore him.
Harry was no fool, he had never been able to lie and have Hermione as his best friend for more than seven years now had never helped to keep any secrets from him.
“Fine…Do what you have to do, but I want to know everything! Understood?” Harry pressed, with a piercing glance at Ron, discouraging him from leaving him behind.
Maybe the nightmare was about to end? Maybe Harry was going to regain his memories very quickly?
Without him really knowing why, Draco stepped forward suddenly, grabbing Potter's arm to prevent him from going further.
Malfoy stood up in front of him and licked his lips, before erasing the last drops of semen with the back of his hand. Harry finally seemed to realize that he could now move and rose on his elbows, completely disoriented.
Harry gave him one last tight smile before heading towards one of the central aisles of the stands.
“I have to leave you,” Ginny said, “I have an intensive sports class to start the day!”
He needed time to process their last face-to-face.
Harry made a little surprise sound before getting back on his feet and folding his arms in defence.
OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoO
OoOoO
He relaxed by letting his girlfriend lift up his shirt and pass it over his head.
Everything is disconnected in his head, the only thing that mattered now was the taste of Malfoy in his mouth, the texture of his skin under his hand, the fresh and subtle smell of his perfume.
“Honestly, Harry, do you really think this is going to help you? That you’re going to find out what Malfoy is up to, if he’s up to something?” Ron asked, raising his eyebrows.
"Really?" he asked, seemingly not believing a word.
The breathing jerked, his eyes moving from left to right, unable to calm the frenzied heartbeat of his heart beating heavily in his chest.
Harry nodded in spite of himself, lowering his eyes on his gloved hands.
Maybe it was time to go home…
The days passed, and unexpectedly, Malfoy tried nothing more to him.
Harry had never experienced anything like it, Malfoy was so exciting, his desire for him was beyond all comprehension and felt him there, everywhere on him, breaked down the barriers of his mind. He was no longer able to think anything, he seemed to have put his brain on standby, only his body was functioning, sinking into Malfoy’s body. Striking at the very bottom to touch a sensitive point that ripped away raucous screams at each breath between kisses.
Harry had then nodded, swallowing one more bite and sipping a sip of tea.
Draco smiled, raising his eyebrows encouraging him to share what he was thinking. Harry blinked, quickly turning away from his face, visibly unaware that he was staring at it intensely and concentrated on a corner of the coffee table before taking another sip of wine.
“Oh… And you didn’t go,” Neville noticed, puzzled.
Harry got tense. He wanted so much to dream about her last night...
He turned his head on the chair beside him to find that Ron had completely abandoned the idea of pretending and had already fallen asleep, his head leaning backwards and his mouth slightly ajar.
Harry was carried away by Malfoy’s bewitching kiss, moving his tongue to find his own and embrace it with devotion. He groaned under the texture of his full lips, eagerly breathing in the tangy odor, and then finally backed away from the delicious taste of Malfoy.
Draco frowned again, squeezing his hand a little tighter on Harry’s shoulder, before he shuddered under the pressure of his fingers.
Let Malfoy remain forever Malfoy and be no different.
“I’ll have to explain to her why I want to break up with her”
Harry, on the other hand, exploded inwardly and see Malfoy so inexpressive as to drive him crazy. It was worse than the period when he totally blacked out Harry and acted like he didn’t exist anymore. There, he
Potter had a slight jolt before abruptly moving his eyes up into his own. He then quickly lowered his head to see all the damage that his magic was causing and quickly loosened his hands from his plate by discarding them as if the porcelain had just burned him.
It was
“Shut up and focus!” he hissed, more and more irritated by the childish behaviour that Malfoy was pleased to maintain.
"Potter, apparently there's something you think I need to be aware of that obviously isn't, so if you could give me a little pointer that we can move on, that would be very grateful from you." Draco sighed, losing patience.
Ron sighed before giving him a sympathetic look.
"I love it when you lose your temper like that... I love to make you lose your mind..." Malfoy said, maliciously.
But Harry didn’t answer and passed by, without making any fuss.
Harry had to leave, get as far away from Malfoy as possible. He thought he was cured, he believed in a stupid deviation, but obviously the desire was always there.
The hands continued to touch him over what was supposed to be his clothes. He wasn’t entirely sure, but none of them seemed to come into direct contact with his skin.
“Last night … I remember…” Harry said in a breath.
Harry opened wide his eyes.
It was his first time…
Harry’s heart missed a beat, he brought his hand holding his erection to lay it flat on the other side of Malfoy’s face, extending his second arm and without letting go of his eyes, sank completely inside him.
"I’d like to know the moment when I made you think you were something else?" Malfoy replied, in a grin.
Once through the nightclub door, he took several puffs of air before Side-Along appeared directly in front of the campus.
After a few minutes, she made them disappear and turned to him.
He didn’t know how to explain it, but as soon as Malfoy laid his eyes on him, he could feel how much he wanted only good for him. Seeing Malfoy so involved in a simple scratch left him perplexed. As if watching him worry for so little showed him how much he had changed, how much he considered him.
Harry focused on her, frowning at the slight smile was stretching her lips.
Malfoy, though far away now, did not seem to want to let him go…
"Fuck off, Malfoy! It was an accident and I've no intention of repeating the experience," Potter exclaimed, losing his patience.
Losing patience, Harry rose from the bed and moved closer to Malfoy, sticking his pelvis against his chair. He grabbed the base of the quill to stop his movement before lowering his hand to surround Malfoy’s hand firmly, exerting gentle pressure on it to prevent it from breaking free.
There was no doubt that the Draco Malfoy who stood before him was the version he had always known. The cold and sarcastic character who had ruined his existence since his arrival at Hogwarts. The fucking aristocrat who denigrates everything that he thinks is not worthy of his worth, the pale copy of his own asshole father just good at demeaning others.
For all the occasions when he had to face fear, this time, nothing seemed strong enough to put it to sleep.
“Except
“I want to get Malfoy out, I can’t stay here alone,” he said, suddenly getting up.
Harry held his breath in his lungs. Apprehending the Side-Along from which he still could not get used to the effects as well as the emotions that this gesture made him feel.
“I can’t believe you wasted so much time just to piss me off.”
Harry’s hands were already beginning to unbutton Malfoy’s shirt, who backed away a few steps, stopping the kiss, making Harry growl, who tried again to taste his lips. He stretched out his neck, leaning forward, feeling the fabric slide under his fingers as Malfoy pulled away from him.
Draco raised his eyebrows, barely digging information.
He was, nevertheless happy that Malfoy allowed him to do so, too anxious that he would use it to his advantage to deceive him about where they were supposed to go.
“If it bothers you that much, we can stop” Harry apologized, reaching out to him.
Harry had crossed the line, he knew it, but he didn’t regret it.
Malfoy pinched his lips in a ragged pout and released the barrier that he squeezed tightly between his fingers.
Rating : M
Harry picked it up twice, leaning excessively up and down, but couldn’t find it. He frowned, thinking that they must have forgotten his name in the list, when close steps made him turn his head to the side.
"It may be laughable indeed, but it is nevertheless the truth, whether you like it or not, it is what I feel! Now if you're done trampling on what's left of my dignity, I'm gonna let you get drunk on your side and do the same with mine, good night!" he concluded by sketching a gesture in the opposite direction.
Everything had always been driven by desire, the desire to devour the other to punish him for making him feel so much pleasure, to have a moment captured his attention to drag him into his bed, to do all those shameful things he dreamed of at night at Ginny’s expense.
He hadn’t swallowed anything since he landed here. Noise behind his back had indicated that he was not alone, Malfoy must have been in the kitchen. Hardly had he thought of this idea that Malfoy had burst into the room, appearing behind him with a tray containing two small pots which he had delicately deposited with the rest of the pastries.
Ginny’s team had just scored its third goal when he saw below, Malfoy and his crew pushing people to move to let them settle in. He sighed. It was not yet tonight that he could avoid him. He noticed that a new head had been added to the band. A bloke was sitting next to Malfoy and laughing with him, gently pushing him with one hand on his shoulder.
Harry didn’t seem to hear him because his magic power was increasing. The various elements present on the table were shaken by tremors and moved quickly over it, the cutlery hitting the plates in small metal noises.
Hermione nodded in a serious look.
“I'll let you get dressed, I’ll go to the bathroom.” He said, before leaving the room under the ever-frightened Potter's gaze.
The anger took place in the midst of this whirlwind of emotions and his little strangled cries came to break the silence of the night.
Ron raised his eyebrows before smiling widely and finishing his biscuit with a wink.
He opened it and drank a sip while wincing under the bitter taste that he felt slipping on his tongue. He suppressed a chill when the liquid spread throughout his body, at the same time relieving his wound trachea.
Ron was nervous by his side, commenting on every movement he found impressive, a hilarious smile stretching his lips. Hermione also seemed to concentrate on the match that was taking place in front of them, watching the darkness slowly falling.
"How could I miss this headline? How come everyone knows but me?" he exclaimed, pressing his hand a little more into his hair.
The wall widened to give way to the spiral staircase, which gradually materialized.
OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoO
Draco still held his breath when the kiss intensified, Potter’s mouth pressed more firmly against his, while their fingers tightened more strongly between them. He could see the black lashes trembling slightly behind the glasses, while Harry’s free arm surrounded his waist to bring him a little closer.
“Speaking of songs, I think I remember you dealing with this kind of thing when we were kids.”
No, on the contrary, Malfoy wanted to continue what was between them and took a clever pleasure in using recent events to seduce him.
And it was eating him to the bones.
“So there won’t be any complications?” he had asked, not preventing the anxiety from taking part in his tiny hope.
Harry blinked his eyes and could not restrain the bitter laughter that escaped from his lips.
The next day, Harry woke up with difficulty. Visions of Malfoy in his head... He could still feel his lips on his own and Malfoy’s hand in his pants wanking him with application.
Harry didn’t know what he was doing there. He didn’t know how his friends had dragged him here, but he was still there, lost, in the midst of a crowd of students from his school dancing, drinking and laughing.
“What are you going to do, Potter? Killing me? Hexing me? Or...” Malfoy blew, his eyes down slowly on Harry’s mouth and then bit his lower lip.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Harry replied, who felt the situation was slipping away.
“As true as the
Malfoy grabbed his thighs to block the movement and then planted his metallic eyes in his.
A memory of the day before suddenly came to his mind. Malfoy walking towards him without seeing him, before a young man grabs his arm to turn him in front of him and make him disappear from Harry’s field of vision. Harry, who had not seen the scene, left his mind spinning, imagining the sequel with frightening sharpness.
If he were to be perfectly objective, he would understand what today’s Harry, in relationship with the man who pressed him against him to Side-Along, must have felt for him.
The sound of the blows resonating against his temples became almost insurmountable by mingling with the stream of words that that asshole Slytherin had thrown at him at their last meeting.
Nott still stared at him, this time with great interest.
He began to undress Malfoy by unbuttoning his shirt with precise gestures, sliding it along his arms, revealing his shoulders and his pearly white skin.
“You won’t make me believe that you didn’t like it, Malfoy, so tell me instead why you decided to piss me off tonight?” Harry hissed, getting close to him.
OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoO
Seamus nodded before smiling and regaining his good mood.
Harry had always found that Malfoy had too sharp angles on his face that brought out his cheekbones too prominent and his nose too sharp but everything seemed harmonious at that moment and all the faults he had long hated shouted to him that Malfoy was beautiful now.
OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoO
Harry had measured the food with distrust, before turning his attention to Malfoy, looking to see if he could really taste it safely.
Malfoy stared at him for a moment, then nodded before he pulled back gently to position himself between his thighs. He then placed his hands on Harry’s knees and gently spread his legs to reveal his entire pelvis.
“But then who?” Harry blew, his breath becoming more and more difficult to control as the conversation seemed terribly insane to him.
OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoO
She came to see him in his room and he thought she was just looking for comfort. But her eyes, though wet with sadness for her brother, betrayed her desire for Harry.
“It would have been my pleasure, but today’s training has worn me out… Next time,” she smiled, winking.
Harry had woken up, soaked to the bone, one morning at the beginning of the week, with Malfoy right above him as a reminder of his night.
"Of course, who else do you want me to dream about, except my lovely Gin?" he lied.
“Uh… a little tired but Mrs Pomfrey said it was perfectly normal and I wasn’t doing too badly given the situation.” he replied, didn’t really know what else to say.
He arrived in the hall, Malfoy beside him, silently asking him to follow him.
“Why wouldn’t I?”
Harry took what she offered him, encouraging her to continue, touching her too so that she could feel his desire even if it were not the same...
With his hand on the handle, he began to turn it before interrupting, weighing the pros and cons. With his eyes fixed on his hand, he agreed to turn around and face Malfoy, still immersed in his reading.
It was Theodore Nott, Malfoy’s roommate.
“Please don’t make things more complicated than they already are…” he groaned, grabbing a handful of his hair between his fingers.
“Blueberry Red? Is it even a colour?”
Draco had positioned himself in the center of the room, briefly detailing the decoration he had found to his liking, before putting his grey gaze on the wizard therapist, who had applied himself to having his quill scratched on a parchment.
She uttered a little cry but Harry was already beginning to come and go in her. He needed it, he had to wash his mind of his impure thoughts that had not left him in the last two days. Then he hit Ginny’s pelvis again and again, whimpering louder and faster, moaning too. And when he no longer had the strength to restrain himself, he came and fell heavily upon her.
His heart held on to this last thought. Harry felt terribly guilty about cheating on her, but he couldn’t help but find Malfoy when he could, when he
Harry was sitting nonchalantly on one of the tables outside with Ron, right in the middle of the park, which extended around the witch academy. They were both revising their next course of Spells, their large open books laid flat on the page of the spell
“Wait, I don’t understand what we’re doing here exactly? You wanted me to stop so that’s what I did and now you’re asking me why I didn’t continue?” he replied, puzzled.
Harry’s shoulders began to sag as a deeply disappointed look on his face as he watched his best friend.
They were having lunch and as since the beginning of the week, Harry couldn’t get his eyes off the table in front of him...
“I’ve rarely seen someone as unpleasant as you, Potter..., you’re wasting your time, he’s not here,” Zabini replied.
They were on their third drink and already the effects of whiskey were clearly felt. Harry was hot, his chest burned him every time he drank a sip of his drink and he blinked more often to focus.
"As you wish" she sighed, with a look of disappointment.
Harry immediately opened his incredible green eyes and glared at the Auror.
Bloody hell, those were his memories we were talking about!
“Bloody hell, Malfoy, go harder!” he replied, bringing his pelvis closer to his in a sudden movement.
Black dots danced in front of his eyes, while the orgasm ran through his body and left him numb.
Harry squished his eyes in an attempt to see more clearly but the bleachers had become abstract and the students he had seen were no longer visible and no longer looked like coloured spots.
"I really don’t know what the fuck you’re thinking, asshole! It wasn’t premeditated, I never wanted to kiss you," Harry replied with a grudge.
They stayed for a moment to sip their tea, daring not to disturb this moment of calm, too afraid to start fighting again.
The dates of Quidditch’s next games were then identified and Harry painfully noticed the name of the Harpies at the top of the standings.
It wasn’t just the effect it was having on him, though.
OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoO
A slight moan escaped from his lips, as he bit one. His crotch was beginning to contract, his dick getting bigger, making him squirm with embarrassment.
“Fuck's sake Malfoy, stop with the recurring nicknames you want, it’s really boring in the long run.”
“I would say that you have something to worry about, because sex accelerates the deterioration of your brain cells.”
"Fuck you, you bastard!" Harry hissed, sharply turning his head towards Malfoy.
Harry had never had any special desire for Malfoy, nor any attraction to his looks. Much less about his personality.
Certainly he had been that cold and cynical character that everyone thought pompous and unbearable, but this picture still stuck in the minds of some witches, was no longer. He’d changed a lot since Hogwarts.
“I still believe that he always knew it was me. I wouldn’t know how, but... I saw in his eyes that he knew...” Harry added, remembering the look of Malfoy on that famous day.
“But finally I think you’re right, the treacherous being that I was must surely pay the price today, because now, even that aspect, I no longer have the right.” He ends up, sighing.
“Potter? What are you still doing here?” Malfoy asked, frowning.
Draco raised an eyebrow, surprised at the discomfort of Harry, understanding nevertheless all his resentment towards the events that he suffered in recent days.
Harry opened his eyes, feeling his throat jam, but quickly regained consistency.
Malfoy’s smile widened, and the features of his face continued to show that saddened face he did not know.
Harry took a deep breath, and brought his pelvis closer to Malfoy’s hole and pushed against it, penetrating it softly, his outstretched arm contracting, his hand squeezing the sheets between his fingers.
Harry had instilled a goodness in him that he never thought he would have. Opened a door in his heart that he had no idea existed. Harry had known to make live the cold and closed being that Draco had been at a time in his life, filling it and completing it as he imagined himself to see it.
In his last session with the Theo, Harry had hinted that he didn’t like him. According to him, Theo was only good at belittling him and showing him all his superiority. This was not entirely false when we knew him, but Draco knew that he was excellent in his field of choice.
“When I think of all the times we were bitching about Hogwarts' schedules…” Ron said sarcastically, eyes fixed on the timetable.
“Do what you want, I’m used to you calling me like that, anyway”
“You are hopeless,
“I don’t see why she should know what we just did”
Harry turned his eyes on him and frowned. Malfoy had clasped his hand on the mark and began to lift up his shirt with a hurt gaze.
"You can be more explicit?" Malfoy jeered, who clearly didn’t see what he was getting at.
Malfoy made a little puffed laugh which made him turn his eyes in his direction and noticed that he always held the floo powder in his hand which fell into a small net between his fingers.
“Cause he looks at you, Harry. A lot.”
“Did he greet you?” Ron said, stunned, almost dropping his fork.
Harry knew that he had the annoying habit of –
He blinked his eyes to refocus himself when the fingers struck so far that a long moan escaped from his lips and raised Malfoy’s eyes to his face which crossed his gaze veiled by pleasure.
“Good morning to you too, Mr. Potter.” Pomfrey replied, who had just entered the room.
“I heard him wake up and as soon as he saw me he started threatening me,” Malfoy said in his dragging voice.
In the evening, he claimed he needed to rest, his stomach ache worsening painfully. Actually, it was his head that was wrong. He hadn’t stopped thinking about Malfoy all day and his nausea got worse when he felt his fucking cock contract.
One of Malfoy’s hands detached from the bed to go to find Harry’s erection and gripped him firmly, a raucous scream escaped from his lips on this contact and he tilted his head back.
And now they’re taking him back…
“Not too bad, I can go back to the dorm tonight, according to Pomfrey.” He announced, straightening himself to be totally seated on his bed.
With his eyes always resolutely turned up, Harry nodded frantically, biting his lower lip.
Harry lost his mind, and all that he had so far contained rose up in his throat, inevitably making him lose his mind even more.
“Astoria Greengrass, she was with us at Hogwarts, but not from our class. “Her sister is Daphne Greengrass, one of the stuck-up that hung around with Parkinson’s all the time.” Dean added, nodding his head at her.
"You’re right," Harry replied hastily, sinking a little deeper into his bed.
And even though Harry shouldn’t have been so concerned, even rejoicing that he finally decided to let him go, it didn’t stop him from wanting to understand why Malfoy had so quickly stopped pissing him off...
Ron moved the magazine slightly to the side to look at him and raised a dubious eyebrow.
He looked up at Malfoy, who stared at him intensely and noticed that he had already recovered his mug. He then lowered his eyes to the handle where his fingers were curled and believed for a moment to see them tighten it more strongly before staring at him again.
Potter stopped looking at him. With his head turned to the side, he had the look of the one who felt guilty, as if the fact of having hurt Draco also reached him. He clenched his fists around his plate, his lips tightly pinched, seeming to struggle not to hit himself.
“Mione, it’s complicated magic, I had a terrible headache after me too, you know, it’s not easy to handle” Ron explained, trying to calm down his girlfriend.
Harry was still holding his breath, unable to move or add anything. He had to lift his chin a little so that his eyes could match those of Malfoy, who was a little taller than him.
“This is the particularity of alteration phenomena, Harry. They exist only because we want them to and as a result of the choices we have made.” Dumbledore explained, quietly staring at him with his piercing eyes.
He moved forward cautiously, his Patronus following him. With a movement of the wrist, he told it to pass in front, passing through the shutter, without any sign of danger manifesting itself.
Malfoy seemed to think for a moment, standing against his bedroom door, looking at his nightstand. He then raised his eyes and anchored them in Harry’s.
“Let’s see, Potter, obviously, you wanted me to think of you differently than I always did...” Malfoy sneered.
Draco had a nervous laugh.
He was not an ex-Slytherin for nothing... Manipulate people, he knew well...
A few stars began to appear, slowly illuminating the clear sky, making the show even more beautiful before their eyes.
And it was unacceptable!
Still shocked, he did not react immediately, but Harry retreated sharply, seeming totally disturbed by his growing desire. His face was pale and he gasped, while his whole body was filled with tremors.
“The one about potions…” He said, without having to ask the question.
He repressed a sob, realizing that he
Swallowing all his sorrow, he squeezed his wand tightly between his hand, biting the inside of his cheek to avoid appearing on his face and agreeing to answer.
Draco closed his eyes by feeling Potter’s hand fondling his neck and raised his arms to encircle his back again in a possessive embrace.
He closed his eyes in spite and shivered when he felt Malfoy’s lips brushing his neck. He squeezed the glass he was still holding in his left hand. Conversely, Malfoy’s hand flowed from his arm to entwine his right hand.
Malfoy was obviously part of a team, or maybe
"You bastard... I should hex you that will make you shut your mouth for the rest of your life," he spit out.
However, it had never been otherwise in Harry’s memories.
He prepared to open his mouth again but Pomfrey was faster.
Harry’s gestures were becoming more and more precise, though utterly desperate to touch as much as they could, tasting his skin wherever he had access. Draco’s body trembled every time his cock wanked against Potter’s, Harry’s moaning accentuating his burning desire to free himself.
Harry yawned hard before rubbing his face with his hands until his coffee was ready. All his colleagues had already returned home, including Ron, he was now the only Auror still present to try to stay awake with caffeine.
"Get ready, we’re going out" he said, in a dragging tone.
"So what do you want to talk about?" he asked, raising his arms in the air, impatiently.
But Harry was scared. Because it was Malfoy and he didn’t trust him at all. And even though he desperately wanted it and his lust for him was bordering on indecency, their relationship was based only on sex, nothing more.
"Don’t you guess? You’ve completely lost control of your magic, Harry! You almost hurt us all, or worse, killed us! Including yourself!”
“Yeah, like that! That’s how I want you to be!” Harry replied, getting closer to sticking their noses.
He had wanted to go further with him, he had wanted to possess all of him.
As he swallowed the last spoon of whipped cream, Harry felt Ginny’s hand move on his thigh, moving slowly inward and he hurried to tighten his legs to prevent it from going any further. Harry turned his head towards her, and she glared at him. She wanted him, and obviously she wanted him now.
He felt Malfoy’s hands pass between them and push him back, until he bumped into something that turned out to be a bed and felt tipped over, his back hitting the mattress.
Exhausted, he no longer had the strength to move. He left his head in the pillow and let go. The tears were still running down his cheeks and he had no way of controlling them. Harry couldn’t even think anymore. He was like emptied and there was no point in fighting.
“For two guys who wanted to avoid talking about wedding preparations, we just spent the beginning of the evening doing just that…” he sneered, glancing at Malfoy.
Malfoy sighed, rolling his eyes.
“I’ll make dinner” Harry mumbled, heading into the kitchen without bothering to fire Blaise.
“Harry…” he whispered.
Harry broke free and continued to walk without turning around.
“What? Yes, of course! But, I thought you would have turned more to Herbology, given how much you like this domain,” Harry said, fearing that he had offended his friend.
"How did I end up wanting the pretentious prick who's been ruining my life since I started school? I don't know, these things are out of control. I would never bet on you, but I guess my life is full of twists and turns, isn't it?" He explained in a sarcastic tone.
Dropping his hair, his arms down his body, Harry stuck the back of his skull against the cold tile of the shower, resigned by what his heart proved to him.
“I intend to!”
“I’ll just go home to get some stuff and then I’ll go to class.”
Did Malfoy not feel how sick Harry was of having to admit that he was the one who started the thing and how bitterly he regretted it?
And like his glass a few moments earlier, all the hint of hatred that Harry had worked, had let it mature for a long time while striving so hard to contain it, ended up inevitably reaching the edge of his lips and leaving without him being able to hold it.
that they had to cast nonverbally. Or at least, were supposed to study but, their books were abandoned while they took the sun and breathed the fresh air of the morning.
When he reached the count, he straightened himself slightly and opened the bottle with a dry gesture before carefully pouring the liquid it contained into the pot. He carefully tilted his face just above the preparation to see the yellow potion turn instantly to green once the salamander blood was integrated.
"What do you mean?" he asked, puzzled.
He realized he had absolutely no desire to go home. He didn’t have the patience that night to listen to Ginny tell him about the latest novelties she had found.
Potter recovered slowly, his laugh slowly dying in his throat, before staring at his wet eyes in his own.
And letting go, there, now, as Harry had been curbing his desire for so long, this forbidden pleasure that he was obtaining, there, squeezing his sheets with his free hand, made him bite his lip hard, to not shout so much he felt free.
“I imagine you’re dying to ask me all the questions that go through your head, but I would like, if you don’t mind, to ask you something else before you do it.” Dumbledore added.
“Potter, we can stop if you prefer.” Malfoy said, seeming worried.
“He doesn’t remember anything apparently. He told me he was still in sixth year before he woke up here. He thinks I hex him a Confundus or something” he added to Harry’s best friends.
He had not sought to do so since he had been sleeping with him.
Harry tensed his hands on his book, the blood flowing quickly along his cock as he bit the inside of his cheek to swallow his urge to get up to touch Malfoy. He wanted to grab his shirt and turn him in front of him and ferociously steal his half-open pale lips that moved while he seemed to recite his course.
He clenched his fists and gave him the most hateful glance he could.
Harry began to lose patience, not understanding why his best friends also seemed to believe that he and Malfoy lived together as a couple.
Malfoy lowered one of his hands down and proceeded to unbutton Harry’s pants, unwrapping his belt first. Harry tensed up, understanding Malfoy’s intention. He quickly placed one of his hands on Malfoy’s wrist to stop him. Malfoy released his wrist and grabbed Harry’s hand to interlace his fingers with his own before placing it on one of his own hips. He then released it and undertook to definitely unbutton Harry’s belt before removing the buttons from his pants. Harry tried again to prevent him from going further but Malfoy was faster and plunged his hand in the pants to go and touch his sex.
But the Aurors district had specifically asked that one of their recruits be dedicated to them to diagnose the victims of advanced spells and more precisely of black magic.
“Hermione told me what the healer said, so I was able to go a little further in my search to try and find the bastard who did this to you, Harry.” Ron explained, before he sat down on the sofa.
When he opened the door, he expected to find him lying in bed, perhaps even completely asleep. He already imagined himself watching him sleep, his eyes running through the features of his face as his ears filled with his calm and slow breathing.
He looked happy. The title said he had just won the cup.
Draco staggered under the blow, feeling his heart crumble after Harry’s painful words.
Potter gauged him for a moment before turning his eyes away from his glass, which he laid down in his turn, to fit completely into the couch.
Harry’s lips parted, opening his mouth in an inspiration as he was preparing to rebut something, anything that could silence this idiot Parkinson, but she spoke again before he had time to close her beak.
“I thought so too, but obviously he decided it had to go on...” Harry said, in a tired tone.
Draco had repressed an annoyed smile, clenching his teeth in front of his cynical colleague, perfectly aware that he had wanted to make him spit words rather than simply answer him.
Harry stopped coming and going and stood there for a moment, panting, his hand soiled by Malfoy’s sperm. This one breathed hard against him, his teeth still in the flesh of his neck. Harry didn’t dare move, waiting for the rest, because his brain hadn’t realized yet.
He took advantage of this to free himself from Malfoy’s embrace and stumbled back, with very short breath, his mouth burning. Harry passed his fingers over it, then into his hair, his eyes fixed on the ground, spread with terror.
«Finally awake... It’s about time... » a dragging voice made to his right.
He had hit Nott when arriving in front of the building, half-snorting him to go and knock on the door of the room he shared with Malfoy, wanting at all costs to talk to him. Malfoy had opened it to him and there again he was not sure what had happened.
He laughed and shot again on his cigarette before blowing the smoke on Ron, who coughed back.
Harry was already in his pajamas and lying on the bed, a book on Quidditch in his hands. Draco took the opportunity to open the drawer where his clothes were, all tidy and folded to perfection to get out a fine pajamas.
, used extensively in the medical field. After spreading the whole set on the table, he rekindled the fire under the cauldron and began to make the cure potion.
Malfoy stared at him one last time before finally Side-Along, leaving him alone in the middle of the living room.
He stared at the ceiling, always the urge to cry, because he was fucking upset, because he was totally lost…
Draco took the opportunity to get closer, carefully reaching his arm to put it on his lower back, feeling him tense under fingers.
Harry definitely had a knack for making him lose his mind, whether or not he was without his memories, he was still the most amazing man Draco had ever met.
"And I don’t deny, that’s exactly what I did," said Malfoy, raising one eyebrow.
Potter lowered his head and Draco guessed his smile adorning his lips before he stretched the arm in his direction by giving him a finger that he accentuated with the wrist.
The movements were slow and meticulous, as if Malfoy was extremely careful not to hurt him. When the pain eased a little, Harry began to feel again what surrounded him. The texture of the sheets between his fingers, the pillow becoming moist against the bottom of his back and the slight caress rubbing his hip.
Ginny smiled at him.
Harry joined Ron for breakfast, devouring the contents of his plate, his stomach clamoring for food after he had emptied several times in the last few days. His best friend seemed reassured to see him recovered and they talked together before going to their first class of the day.
Malfoy took a step to the side, heading for the next room.
Harry had already gone to the door and kept it open when Malfoy answered.
Disclamer : all rights to J.K. Rowling
He didn’t like it. Because he didn’t like Malfoy and because he was a fucking
Ginny was stationed above, flying over the stadium, looking for the Snitch.
Harry who seemed to be doing better when he had left him last night, had shown himself to be hurtful and distant in his way of being in barely a morning. And even though he seemed troubled by Draco, by regularly squinting on his lips, it was obvious that Potter found it repulsive to be associated with him. Just the way he gauged Draco’s hand, the muscles of his body become tense whenever Draco had the misfortune of simply
A book fell from the shelf in front of him, startling him sharply.
“Malfoy, we literally just jumped on each other, if you hadn’t pushed me away, we probably would have gone even further. Don’t you think that’s reason enough to have a discussion with your fiancée?”
Then his eyes stopped at one last picture, hovering in the middle of the nightstand. Harry felt pale, and without releasing his wand, took a step to the side and took the picture in his free hand, trembling slightly.
“Don’t know, that’s why I’m asking you.”
“I wish I could, but I already have an evening planned with my Quidditch team…” Ginny replied, embarrassed, looking at Harry.
Malfoy’s almost white blond hair appeared, shining under the light of one of the torches that framed the room. He was leaning over his desk with a quill in his hand and stopped before raising his eyes in his direction.
"Where’s the mark?" he added in a colder tone.
Malfoy stopped his movements and turned his head in his direction. He planted his translucent grey eyes in his eyes and laughed bitterly while raising his chin.
Draco stood up in a sitting position, and put his feet on the floor. He then put his hands on his face and rubbed it to wake up more. He stretched out for a long time before deciding to get up, cracking the bones of his spine and neck and then carefully folding the down that served as his blanket.
He closed his eyes to regain his senses, the strange atmosphere that reigned around him seemed to lock him in a cocoon of well-being, making him almost forget where he was. He took the time to refocus before reopening them and blinking his eyelids, shaking his head.
Harry rolled his eyes before glaring at him.
Harry swallowed and quickly groped his pockets to look for his, but a new bolt of lightning brushed against his cheek and he froze as his fingers pressed the edges of his trousers.
Hermione raised her eyebrows before speaking again.
Obviously, just thinking was a hardship in his current state, and he clearly didn’t want to fight it while knowing it would lead to nothing good.
His trademark well in place, nevertheless hoping that it was not too cracked, he consented to turn vaguely towards the creaking, seeing two silhouettes approaching.
Harry stared at him and saw the fear clearly reflected on the features of his face through the blue light that illuminated him.
Fortunately, Malfoy had calmed down and even though he always had a look for him as soon as they crossed, he had not tried anything to destabilize him. It really amazed Harry when we knew how much that sod liked to make him uncomfortable.
years of my life? How could I be with…
“The Burrow” he announced distinctly, before throwing the powder into the hearth.
“Even in Snape?” he asked with a hard voice, sticking his eyes into the Dumbledore’s eyes.
The old death eaters were all dead or languishing in the dungeons of Azkaban and only a few repeat offenders who wanted to use black magic showed up from time to time.
Draco scraped his throat, drawing their attention to him.
“Apparently Malfoy is getting married too.” Dean’s voice made to his right.
"Let’s go home," he said, with his palms facing the sky, waiting for him to take hold of it.
Neville remained silent before muttering.
Harry gauged this hand for a moment before deigning to hold it briefly, quickly loosening his grip to bring his arm back to his side.
But his boss kicked his ass by flattering his aristocratic ego that he remained despite his current situation.
“But unless being a student or a teacher, I don’t know how to get inside the castle without getting caught.” he retorted.
The mild warmth of the inn immediately surrounded him when he arrived on the still soaked threshold of the storm from outside. He carelessly shook his cape to drop the last drops of rain and wiped his feet on the doormat before moving fast to the bar.
With his breath jerking, his arm in the air and his fist closed, Harry looking at Malfoy as if it was the first time he saw him.
The light of day burned his retinas over his eyelids, which he creased strongly before sticking a hand on them to preserve them.
“Really?” Malfoy asked, that he felt rising at his side.
“I used one of my mother’s manuals.” he said, in a proud tone. He then leaned his head slightly to the side, looking a little higher. “I admit I had no idea how complex sewing spells were before I cast them.” he added, distorting his smile which now looked like a wince.
“It’s true, I don’t know much about it, but this mark proves that he owned you... And that’s enough for me to recognize an enemy.” Harry replied.
“We’ll see if you’re not too bad.”
"What would I be, Malfoy?" Potter said, impatient.
Harry and Ron shook his hands with a big smile on their face. Lee Jordan was a great friend of the twins at Hogwarts.
Alone…
even though it was because he was irritated to see him pick himself up every time his first name escaped the barriers of his lips.
Harry took the opportunity to get closer until he was barely three feet away. Malfoy swallowed his saliva before glaring at him.
? But what’s this bullshit?" he hissed, annoyed by his enemy’s attitude.
So, he was struggling to get his leg as heavy and stiff as a wooden handle forward as he finally reached the corridor.
Harry moved his hand forward, taking the cup to turn it between his fingers and make the light reflect on the crystals that surrounded it.
was no longer Potter…
Malfoy, who had completely abandoned the book now, turned his eyes on a corner of the room and pretended to think.
OoOoOoOo
After living on campus for a year, specializing in his future profession, he bought with the money his father had invested in him since he was born, an apartment in a small sorcerer’s district not far from the Malfoy’s Manor to visit his mother regularly.
He then stretched the boiling cup to Harry, who grabbed it by touching his fingers, jumping to the touch, missing to let go of the container, before bringing it back to him with his head slightly turned to the side, avoiding his gaze.
It was good, it was hot, but too little to his liking. Harry’s moves became more impatient, always wanting more, wanting Malfoy...
"Not before you let me in" Harry insisted, glaring at him.
How could he believe that Potter would trust him enough in just a few days to confide in him? To even feel
Harry fastened the buttons on his trousers, fastening his belt, before putting on his shoes and quickly tightening his laces.
“Stop acting like you’re a victim in the story, you want it as much as I do!” Harry spit out, clenching his fists, his face just a few inches from Malfoy.
Draco had raised a new eyebrow, dipping his hands into the pockets of his pants.
Harry did his best to appear natural, challenging her to go further in her reasoning.
Harry stared at the cup on his classroom table and closed his eyes. He took a great inspiration, concentrating all his magic flow and let it travel his body. He then stretched his arm with his palm open before slowly opening his eyes veiled by the power inside him.
Harry sighed, annoyed.
A sad smile stretched Harry’s lips as he stared at the beautiful stag motionless in front of him.
Harry had a gift for not caring what people thought. Quite the opposite of Draco at that time, or showing himself as he really was, was exposing a state of weakness of which he was deeply ashamed. Because a Malfoy never reveals his moods. A Malfoy keeps his temper in all circumstances, even in the face of death.
And then, after that asshole openly sought him out, Harry had clearly lost all sane thought by crushing his lips on his own. And everything changed when he felt Malfoy respond to his angry kiss, insisting and tightening their embrace.
Harry was still in the middle of his thoughts, still in the middle of the office when a movement finally caught his attention.
“So, you’re gonna fuck with me, aren’t you?” he shouted, clenching his fists, arms still crossed on his chest.
“No Potter, if I wanted to kill you I would only have cast one spell and you know it…” Malfoy finally replied, immediately soothing the sensation that was crushing his heart.
Malfoy sneered, obviously proud of his fucking bullshit!
"Really," said Draco, in a raw tone.
Chasers took the Quaffle without restraint, skillfully dodging Bludgers that Beaters sent them.
Resuming his breath, he slowly pushed the door before crossing the threshold and finding the Pensieve where the silver colour was reflected on the stone walls of the room.
“Going back to Theo, I don’t know him any more than that, but I valued him for what he is, an equal, descended from a long line of pure bloods like many of our comrades in our old house” Draco added, staring at Harry.
Afterwards, Harry had somewhat calmed down, controlling to the best of his ability his impulsivity and the anger that animated him, punctuating crises from time to time but nothing that was unmanageable in Draco’s eyes.
His breath suddenly short, he hardly exhaled.
"Don’t say it like that," Harry winced, putting a hand on Malfoy’s white torso to keep him away and allow him to get up.
Draco sighed, then weighed the pros and cons, pulled the wand belonging to Harry out of the pocket of his pants and put it in a small noise on the closet by his sides.
“We haven’t decided on the date yet, but by next year between May and June, I guess.” he replied, taking another sip.
OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoO
“You didn’t want to fight anymore. Too much blood was spilled in the final battle, many of our friends did not survive, and others were seriously wounded and still bear scars today. You just wanted to change your life…” Draco calmly explained, still standing in the middle of the living room.
He laid down, brought the blankets over his body, turning sideways, so as to keep an eye on the drawing of the empty corridor in case Malfoy came out.
Harry closed his eyes on his clasped hands and breathed a long sigh before reopening them to look at Ron.
Harry slipped in the shower and ran the hot water, still disturbed. He looked at the ground, rubbing abundantly the parts where Malfoy had laid his hands on him. Especially his balls where Malfoy’s mouth had sucked him. He still felt his tongue all over his body, tracing his muscles and tasting his skin.
Malfoy stared at him for a moment before turning his head to the coffee machine, pinching his lips slightly.
Harry had come to realize that Malfoy was present in his every thought, both in his way of looking at him and in the way he saw him through his gestures and personality.
“But…For fuck’s sake, Malfoy, we hate each other,
Harry rushed, Ron trying so hard to follow him.
Harry realized that his heart was beating too fast and that his breathing had become difficult to bear while he was thinking back to that moment exchanged with Malfoy. Horrified, he realized that he even had an erection while his best friend was sitting beside him.
Malfoy seemed to never leave his office, at least that’s what Harry thought since he didn’t see him anywhere in the corridors of the Ministry.
Harry turned his eyes to him and noticed that he had laid down on his left side and stared at him intensely. Harry turned his eyes away, feeling his cheeks burning by the discomfort that Malfoy’s grey gaze caused him.
“What the hell is this shit?” he hissed, wincing.
How could he have waited so long to climb back up?
Theodore Nott, one of his Slytherin classmates, gave him a big smirk before escaping into the crowd, sheltered from Draco's fury.
Adrenaline had now taken hold of his muscles and he began to move forward to get closer to Malfoy.
Malfoy raised his eyebrows before scowled at him.
Malfoy let out a slight sneer before leaning against the wall behind him and crossing his arms.
Harry finally gets Neville’s wand and overtook it on the fly. He was amazed by his prowess.
This one was particularly clear, a little too bright, it should have been dark blue but Harry’s magic was half consumed by his jealousy. Almost entirely tainted by this bullshit of emotion from which he was desperately unable to detach himself.
He held his breath, his legs barely supporting his weight after the intensive effort he had practiced a few minutes before, Malfoy’s tongue on the tip of his cock not helping his balance.
Feeling his knees sagging, Harry clung to the night table, wailing under the back-and-forth of Malfoy’s mouth against his sex, which made him lose his mind. He had to go back to his dorm, to make sure Ron would find him tomorrow morning when he came back, but Malfoy’s torture on his cock made him forget his obligations.
He therefore stood carefully, taking the time to dress with his dress in the colours of the Gryffindors which had deeply missed him the few days he had spent in his other life. He collected his personal belongings which his friends had brought to him in the last 24 hours and slowly walked towards the door not without an inflating apprehension ball in his throat.
Malfoy’s fingers ran higher on his belly and he held a moan in his throat, because his fingers were soft and he felt his skin shiver under their touch.
A deep hatred seized him and he had to resist the urge to hit that fucking prick who smiled at him with that particular look he could not decipher.
A feeling of softness invaded him as the pain he had felt earlier gradually faded away to leave only a vague memory of the burn she had left.
The elevator doors closed, and Harry stepped into the corner, grabbing the railing with one hand, and placing the other on the top of his thigh to rub the stiff spot that was causing him pain.
“Careful, it may be that one day she has already prepared the ceremony and you may have to celebrate it right away!” Neville added, giggling.
He scraped his throat.
“Potter! It’s not a dream, it’s… It’s
“Sorry… I-” he babbled, embarrassed.
And for a few hours, there was nothing else but them.
Draco chuckled nervously.
Blaise, if he had noticed Potter’s strange behavior, did not show any, and invoked a glass and poured out wine which he immediately took to his mouth to drink a long sip.
He shook his head, determined to get moving, avoiding wasting more time in lamenting and asking himself questions witch he wouldn’t find answers on his own and began to dress.
Nott seemed perfectly aware of his intellectual abilities, he had this way of showing you that this was the case without exposing it to you in person.
He exhaled deeply and suddenly opened his eyes, more determined than ever.
Harry raised his eyebrows.
But now that Harry had experimented, more than reason, he had to admit that the idea of being below was particularly tempting.
“We have to touch each other to be able to Side-Along…” he recalled, in front of the questioning look that Harry was giving him.
There was no four-poster bed where he had wisely fallen asleep the day before, nor was it the Gryffindor’s dorm with the famous red and gold colors as he expected to find it...
Malfoy seemed about to faint and already his voice was only begging in his ears.
Harry thought about the pleasure of flying. He didn’t have the strength to buy a new broom, but watching the players flying in front of him, he couldn’t help but envy them too.
In his great misfortune, he wanted to do it again but he promised to stop.
Harry straightened out slowly and continued his movements on Malfoy’s sex. His breathing was jerky as his eyes met those of Malfoy, darkened by the pleasure he gave him.
How, from his cozy bed to Hogwarts he had landed in this unknown reality of which he had no memories, only the few photos and portraits he had vaguely glimpsed in the room, his room visibly shared with…
“I don’t think so, Ron. It’s true they’re often placed here, but that doesn’t necessarily mean there’s something behind it” Hermione sighed, annoyed.
The young man stopped sharply, spreading his eyes in his direction, before turning them towards Potter to stare at him. Then, he turned his attention to Draco in half a smile.
"Potter!" Draco cried, taking a step forward.
Malfoy then plunged his hand into a terracotta pot and removed some of the floo powder which he threw into the hearth.
Harry had the power to completely drown him, just laying his eyes on him. It was horribly destabilizing. At the time, he hated him for it, now, although he found it annoying to be trapped by a simple glance, he would give everything to contemplate this eyes until the last day of his life.
OoOoO
Just imagining that he was in a relationship with Malfoy in his future life, his present now, his reaction would have been quite normal. But he could not bring himself to feel such a longing for his enemy, for he had never experienced such feelings towards him.
He glanced at her for a moment while wincing before giving the password.
“You won’t be alone if Hermione comes with you,” Harry said in a sad voice.
Malfoy glanced at him for a moment before crossing his arms on his torso and lifting his chin.
Harry loosened one of his hands from the glass and felt his nerves pull from having too long been roughed up and taken the vial.
He yawned again before turning his eyes on Malfoy who raised a sarcastic eyebrow.
Harry waited a little while, giving him an interrogative gaze before going deeper. Malfoy breathed strongly, biting his lower lip, his fingers squeezing the sheets of his bed, looking at the ceiling above him. He closed his eyes a few seconds before anchoring them in Harry’s and smiling at him slightly.
Harry’s mind started wavering again. Being close to Malfoy was really not a good idea. Especially when he started to look at him like that. And that asshole kept going. Malfoy passed his tongue on his lips before biting the one at the bottom, giving him a hot glance.
"Precisely, you should know after all these years that I never lie and that I have no interest in doing so, especially in this kind of context," Potter thundered with a loud voice.
Harry did not even bother to look again, feeling his stomach contracting painfully.
Harry stared at her without blinking, swallowing painfully while her heart missed a beat to hear that Malfoy was watching him regularly.
Draco's mind suddenly regained consciousness as Potter was already moving in an unknown direction.
Hermione and Ginny joined them, and they left in a lively discussion about new inventions they had proposed.
Harry turned his eyes to Parkinson, who stared at him with a sneaky air, her lashes tightly tightened leaving only a glimpse of light between her eyelids.
“Sorry, what?”
“Fuck, Malfoy, tell me!”
Ron tried to say no, but he finally admitted that he would be more useful in the field than waiting wisely for someone to take care of him. He had promised to come back to see him after everything had been settled and Harry had acquiesced before throwing him out of the way.
Harry saw Malfoy swallowing with difficulty, his Adam’s apple, rising up and descending in a slow rhythm while a glimmer of desire took place in his metallic eyes.
Draco had his mouth glued to Potter’s shoulder, panting heavily as he pressed his back with his arms. Feeling the orgasm far too close, he slowly backed away to seal his lips to Potter’s.
By the time of Hogwarts, all the students were there to watch a game, mixing up all the houses, regardless of which one was fighting.
Harry licked his lips and shrugged his shoulders.
Harry grabbed his hair between his fingers, squeezed it hard, seeming like he was about to lose his mind.
“It seems to me you have it now, no? So what are you going to do?” Draco answered, in a scornful tone.
He felt his heart leap into his chest when she appeared in his field of vision. He hadn’t seen her since and he was strangely relieved to see that she was still there.
Malfoy sneered, extending his arm in front of him.
If Harry’s bad faith wasn’t so blinding, he’d think he was smiling more now that they were seeing each other.
“Shut the fuck up! It’s wrong and you know it!” Harry growled, plunging his hands into the pockets of his pants.
