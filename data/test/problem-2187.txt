This Malfoy is so much more different than Harry could ever have imagined, this Malfoy wears kimonos and pretty smiles and freckles on his face like speckled armour.
exactly, Ron's already flashing a badge at somebody in front of a desk, and they hand Harry a key. Ron pats him on the back, stepping back and folding his arms like a proud Father. Harry opens the door to the far room on the right - the one shrouded in shadows that almost makes it impossible for him to stuff the key in the keyhole because it's so dark. Stepping inside, he shuts the door behind him.
His hands - still encased in their thick gloves - seem to have gotten the memo from his feet that today is ignore Harry Potter Day™, as they're up against the glass door, poised and ready to grasp the brass handle. He hates his limbs, he decides. He really does.
He can feel Malfoy smile against the skin of his neck. "Relax, Potter. I've never so much as set foot in this club before. I've only ever gone to a Muggle one three times before I quit."
"Thanks, sir. Don't worry, you can go back to fucking your boyfriend. Alex and I are gonna do that for the first time on Christmas Day."
"Right, sorry. I'm a potion's analyst, as you know. Or, I mean, you don't have to know. It would be weird if you didn't, actually, as Rita Skeeter has a field day questioning my qualifications in
He purses his lips. "But Andromeda doesn't have any freckles." Somewhere in the fog of confusion, curiosity and - okay, he admits it - arousal, he swears he remembers Draco making fun of Ron's own face of constellations.
Harry doesn't understand why his heart soars at that. "I can't really do much." He pushes his hips up to rub his covered length over Malfoy's arse to illustrate his point.
Above him Draco seems to be having fun, writhing and rolling his hips, trying to thrust into the clenched fists wrapped around his member. Harry uses the pearly liquid sliding down Draco's prick to make it easier for him to start a slow pump that makes the blonde squirm and gasp out loudly. Draco's other hands reaches down to tangle in the coarse locks of Harry's curls.
"HARRY MOTHERFUCKING JAMES BLOODY POTTER! IF I DON'T SEE YOU OUT HERE IN THE NEXT MINUTE YOU MIGHT AS WELL WRITE YOUR WILL, BUILD YOUR OWN COFFIN AND CHOOSE YOUR GODDAMN FUNERAL SONG BECAUSE I WILL COME AND KILL YOU RIGHT WHERE YOU'RE STANDING!"
It's the sort of problem that Hermione would gut him for if ever she found out. Good thing is, she never will. Not if Harry doesn't breathe a word to her about it.
Draco's eyelids flutter open - Harry's unsure of when they closed in the first place - and the frail pink of his cupid's bow quivers slightly. There, Harry fucking knows he's messed up whatever slight chance he had before to claim this man as his. He's probably messed up the one good thing in his life. Harry backs off, ignores the way his dick dribbles more precome in longing for his dragon and looks away from the Slytherin.
Harry wants to argue, but all he can think about is how fucking amazing Malfoy looks when he's exasperated. And his
"Merlin," Malfoy hisses, holding tight onto Harry as his orgasm rips through him, his face melting into an expression of pure pleasure. Harry rubs his thumb against Malfoy's slit and grins when Malfoy takes the slight jolt of pain from the sensitivity. He keeps doing it, watching the blonde squirm between intense discomfort and intense pleasure. Finally, he lets go, and Malfoy jolts in his arms, moaning softly.
crying, not Draco. Still, Harry wraps both arms around the man he has yet to really figure out and lets him weep.
"Alright, mate?" Ron shouts over the music. Harry nods minutely, his eyes taking it all in. "We've set up a room for you - one free lap dance, courtesy of yours truly."
Diagon Alley looks nice at this time of the evening, Harry thinks. Quiet, peaceful, snowy and filled with the silent hum of magic that encases both him and Pansy Parkinson in its warm embrace. Don't look so surprised; one must have seen it coming. Harry's a hero, plain and simple, and right now his biggest task is helping Pansy get gifts for Hermione. Something about a 1-year anniversary or something; Harry doesn't listen very often.
Because Harry is a potion's analyst, and so that's the easiest lie he has to use right now. Plus, he's sort of drunk on the sight of beautiful Malfoy.
How the fuck does he tell Malfoy they're less than a few hundred feet to the graveyard and that's actually where they're going? Harry wants to cry, and that's the truth of it.
"Maybe I -"Harry breathes in thick scents of sweetened almonds, lips brushing against Draco's ear as he murmurs. "- Maybe I want you to bite."
The one where Harry Potter goes to Diagon Alley to help Pansy Parkinson and just happens to see Malfoy through a shop window.
"Here she is - the beautiful woman. I think she's perfect, personally, and deserves all the stolen flowers she gets."
to kill him - and now the pale blonde strands graze the top of his back, tied with a string of leather rope into a low ponytail. It's rather unfair, really, how beautifully soft it looks. Criminal, more like, the way Malfoy's voice now resembles breathy lavender, soft and unspoken with a certain grace.
- glides from his bench and into the light of the shop. Harry's eyes fall immediately on the Slytherin's freckled face, gaze sliding over the man's nose and cheeks. He feels something surge in the very lower part of his stomach when Draco is suddenly in front of him, pretty little hands clasping the front of his jacket.
The first thing Harry sees are scantily-clad people on floating, multicolored poles, which he'd expected so it's not like it comes as a surprise. But he'd never expected that all of it, the smoke, the heat, the sensual music, to affect him as it does. After 18 years of Voldemort-imposed celibacy, Harry doesn't know what to do when his eyes glance over at a male dancer grinding in some lucky man's face.
"Enchanting? Dangerously handsome?" Draco's grin still brightens up even the darkest corners of the room; the droopy flowers are left forgotten as he glides over to the sign on the front door that reads
Harry hates himself, but he still kneels in front of his mother's grave and places the flowers on the soft earth. He glances over his shoulder at Malfoy and lets slip a tiny, mangled smile.
After a few moments, Harry turns around to leave and bumps into a hard chest. He stumbles against the person and his hand reflexively curls around a hard bicep.
Meaning he totally misses the time he steers them through the gates of the graveyard and suddenly they're standing in front of Harry's parent's grave.
Images, unbidden, flash across his mind. Arms clutched around his torso as heat licks at their feet. Grey eyes alight with malice so bright it turns them quicksilver. Grey eyes dulled down to the color of lead from months in Azkaban. The soft fullness of a mouth he's watched for so many years.
With his nosy husband gone, Harry quickly sticks the picture to the wall with a charm and Vanishes the hammer.
Harry loves his husband - don't get him wrong; he really does. Draco Malfoy is the most beautiful, enchanting man he's ever set his eyes on, and Harry truly does love him. He loves his snarky comments and the way his brow furrows into a small frown when he's confused about something, or the way his tongue pokes out when he's concentrating on not burning his toast.
It's a good one, as well - one of Harry and Draco in front of their new house for the first time. Draco's standing behind Harry, arms wrapped around his - Harry's - midsection, face pressed in close to Harry's neck. Grey eyes look like moonlit pools of silver, and Harry falls in love all over again.
Is he comfortable? Yes. Does he want to kill himself at this present moment? Yes. Is he sporting a raging hard-on and is desperately trying to think of Molly Weasley naked to get rid of it promptly?
them and the feeling is immediate, violent and ripping screamed moans from deep within both their throats. Harry thrusts, clasps at Draco's shoulders, clasps at his long, messy hair that sometime during their exchange fell out of its ponytail. The feel of both their members sliding, slick and intense, makes that animalistic feeling swamp Harry again.
Draco spots Harry's dubious expression, and delicately waves one hand in a simple gesture. "There's no one out there of interest, anyways. I'd much rather talk to you."
Harry practically melts, allows his body to fall forward and slips into Draco's embrace. He doesn't know what the fuck he's doing, or what has possessed him, but Harry also finds that he doesn't mind. He wants this. So much more than he ever could have imagined. Hips grind into his, and Harry bites at the exposed skin on Draco's neck - it's taunting him, he thinks, daring him to lose all control and become positively
They spend a few minutes in terse silence, and on the outside, Harry looks fucking calm and collected like nobody's business. His hair is a mess, but that's a give, and he's sweating through his band t-shirt. ACDC cannot help him now.
Harry feels fuzzy, and he isn't sure if that's what an Auror is meant to feel in the presence of his ex-arch-nemesis, but he feels it all the same. His hands are tingly, free from those wretched gloves, and his heart is thumping loudly. Not to mention his glasses are all fogged up from the sharp warmness of his breath - Harry realises he's breathing far too loudly to be normal.
"I'll pound you into the bloody wall in a minute." He breathes, glad he's taking up most of Draco's personal space. "If you don't shut the fuck up."
It has to be - who else would just be standing there, watching him? Other than the little girl, but she's tiny, and certainly not 6-foot-something and a wall of hard muscle.
This world where Harry Potter's and Draco Malfoy's let each other explore their skin with plump lips and hesitant tongues just isn't the right world for this Harry Potter.
Before Draco can protest, Harry's slamming him into the patch of wall beside the nail, face flushed and breathing heavily.
And with that Harry's slamming the door behind him and sprinting towards a rather angry looking Pansy Parkinson.
Wait, what? Harry turns sharply to face Ron, ripping his arm away from Lavender's leering touch - the girl was far too soft, all skin and fat with curves galore - she reminds Harry of a leech; of a very special redhead with crimson lips and a pretty smile. Of Ginevra Weasley.
He's not ready for the quick rush of relief as cold air brushes over his aching dick that springs up to slap at his stomach, and most certainly not really for - wait...
"So what do you think he's looking for?" Draco asks, all brisk business and flowering petals. Today, nothing hangs from Suspend charms by the ceiling, and so the floor isn't littered with compostable rose bits and disregarded twigs and leaves.
"Merlin, Harry, are you alright?" Draco is smiling murderously, one perfectly plucked eyebrow raised. His hands don't flutter from their position on Harry's shoulders but the Gryffindor is in no position to call Draco out.
"Um...she'll appreciate the magic gone into making them?" He tries instead. Harry knows he's stretching it, but he knows Hermione. The girl had a weird interest in things like that. Pansy hums, her free right hand coming up to tap her chin.
Harry didn't know that. Yes, he knew Hermione was a publisher, but he didn't know that she published Malfoy. Oh.
Harry glances around him - the streets are empty, apart from this odd little girl who's watching Harry avidly, but he just ignores her. It'd be just his luck if she was a witch and started screeching about Harry Potter stealing from someone's garden - Rita Skeeter would have a field day.
By the end of the whole ordeal, his heart is so full of love that he's sure he'll burst if he doesn't go capture Draco right this second -
Long, slender fingers drag down the cotton of his light shirt, slow and beautifully firm until they reach the small of Harry's back. Draco's hot breath fans the back of his neck, and the Gryffindor shudders as goosebumps mark his flesh. The scent of chocolate and sweetened tea encase their bodies, so different from the almond and lavender of yesterday that Harry wonders if he's with the same Draco Malfoy.
Although for now, Harry agrees that it would be best to just go along with the tea. Ask some unanswered questions, deal with the longing building inside of him.
"Not much, a few sickles should do it." The pair traverse to a rather antique, vintage looking cash register that sits on a lonely little table just in front of those flower pots Harry remembers from last week.
Ron grins at the bouncer who flushes a bit too prettily for a woman twice their size, before he glides in, Harry grasping onto the hand on his arm.
And now, it seems, is no exception. "Look, Lav - I'm fine, really. I already said I don't want to go anywhere near -"
is small; so small that if Harry shifts around two feet to the left his whole body will end up against Draco's. And Harry is quite sure, what with Draco just leaning against the counter innocently, that that would count as sexual harassment.
Malfoy raises an eyebrow and rolls his eyes. "Potter, you work with high-level Amortentia and colon-burning potions, I highly doubt you need my lilies and hydrangeas."
What was he supposed to say to that? Yes, Pansy, you will be the best girlfriend ever and I'm slightly jealous of Hermione because my last girlfriend was about two years ago and she's gone off to join some Quidditch team while I'm here slaving over Auror paperwork? Harry snorts quietly and sends a quick, reassuring smile down to Pansy.
his mind supplies - and tucked into a corner so dark that Harry wonders if this is all part of Malfoy's plan to ruin Christmas for curious passers-by by scaring them like it's Hallowe'en. "Erm..." Harry coughs.
He feels 12 years old again, and his heart is beating erratically - which simply won't do - sending blood rushing to Harry's ears and the palms of his hands sweat inside of his gloves.
Kreacher comes into the kitchen and tries to make him breakfast. Harry says nothing, but he doesn't eat it, he just drinks his black coffee and throws on a jacket and a pair of vans. He leaves Grimmauld Place, burnt breakfast still on the table.
It's not his fault, really. The garden sort of spills over the white picket fence around the property of the house, and sometimes the flowers are too pretty to pass up.
I don't have -" He tries to say more, he'll be the first to tell you he really does fucking try, but Draco's dick is hard in those chinos of his and pressing against the crease between Harry's arse cheeks. And fuck, it feels so good, Harry can feel his own boner twitch minutely.
Harry wants to actually die. He averts his gaze and feels the burn in his cheeks spread down his neck. He lets out a strangled breath.
He ignores the snicker Draco gives when he almost drives the 'stupid Muggle contraption' onto his fingers, and throws the hammer down. "Yeah, yeah, right, you won. Why can't we just use sticking charms now?"
I'm so sorry it's taken me this long to post the rest of the chapters, but thanks to all those that read Flower Shop Boy! Its means so much <3
Draco's hips slam into his, ripping a violent moan of pleasure from Harry as explosions of white heat cloud his vision. Harry wonders if the fact that he's getting off by humping his ex-arch-nemesis in the middle of his own flower shop is cause for any sort of worry, but he's too caught up in his own ecstasy.
Harry's not sure if that’s actually just wishful thinking on his part, though, and some laziness too. It would be great if Draco could just read minds, Occlumency aside, and Harry didn’t have to do any of the labour of, like, actually voicing his emotions.
“What?” Draco asks, turning around to look at Harry. In the corner, Nettle wags her tail at them sleepily in her bed, before setting her chin back down. The thump of her tail dies down to nothing as she slips back into a doze. Harry apologises to her mentally for standing in her room, tackle out, but she doesn’t seem fussed. When he turns back to Draco, it’s to catch the end of Draco stripping off himself, tossing his soiled pyjama bottoms towards the washing basket by the door of the ensuite bathroom.
He wasn’t sure if it was the bottle of champagne he’d drunk, the risk of getting caught, or if it was potentially even a mild concussion, but it was still up there as one of the best shags of Harry’s life. The sex had again been bloody fantastic the next time they hooked up, in the garden of a fundraising gala for Hogwarts students who couldn't afford their own instruments or something. Harry couldn't remember, he only went because Hermione had dragged him there, and to be honest because he heard the Malfoys were going and he was hoping to cop a snog with Draco behind the hydrangeas. Anyway, he could be forgiven for forgetting about whether little Timmy the second year was going to get a trumpet or not when Draco had three fingers in his arse and Harry’s cock down his throat. Harry was often likely to forget his own name or how his legs worked when Draco did that.
It’s midnight when Draco wakes up, tangled in his sheets. He thinks he’s had a nightmare; there’s sweat on his temples, and in the dip of his throat, and he’s covered in prickling, shivery goosebumps. If he did dream, he can’t remember it. That’s good. Draco is glad to forget the dreams that wake him up cold and sweaty.
, and b) that he possibly had a bit of baggage from the war. He’d begrudgingly sought counselling, which was Ron’s idea of — all bloody people —but it had helped Harry, even if talking about how he felt was a ball ache he could have lived without. Well, or not; Harry would happily prattle on to a series of counselors about his weird dreams and messy childhood if it meant he didn’t fuck things up with Draco. Draco was just as willing to do the same. Seven years on, and they were still great at pissing each other off but really,
The pressing concerns of his bladder decide for him in the end, and he turns the soft covers down, emerges from his little cocoon of warmth. He immediately misses it as he presses the balls of his feet against the cold, hard wood floors. He'll have to take the piss out of Draco for not being
It wasn’t until Ron joked that it made people think he was having some kind of breakdown that Harry realised two things: firstly, that people were unsettled by this intentional removal of something they saw as so attractive about him, so iconic of the boy they watched grow up. And secondly, that he kind of
Secondly, he gets himself kicked out of home for blowing the gardener behind the sheds near the ornamental carp pond.
At least she doesn’t yell at him, and seems genuinely quite interested in what Harry’s come up with as an alternative to, you know. Doing the things he definitely promised, and is contractually obliged, to complete for her. She even gives him a big hug afterwards, and whispers that she
). Best of all, they seem fine with Harry walking in wearing flip flops and carrying a cat. He waves to Ginny when he sees her at a table outside.
“It’s okay,” Harry says, shooting Draco a small half-smile. They lapse back into silence before Harry slowly lowers his head to rest on Draco’s shoulder. It’s a careful and measured move, and very deliberate. Draco lets his breath out in a rush, before he tilts his head, lets his cheek rest against the top of Harry’s head. His hair is soft against Draco’s cheek and his fingers are warm against Draco’s skin, and it’s the most comforting thing. Draco shuts his eyes and enjoys it, warm and safe in a place that should be exactly the opposite.
He's distracted when Potter asks what he wants, and makes a vague gesture with his free hand indicating he'll drink anything. He's too focussed on keeping his instincts in check to really concentrate on an order right now. His hand is still pressed to the small of Potter's back. He's focussed on that, too.
. Harry snorts. Sounds like something Teddy would write. Maybe he could get Teddy to read it for him one day.
Harry stares at his phone. Draco teases him a lot, often quite flirtatiously. That’s fine. That’s very normal. Draco doesn’t send kisses. That's…not just flirty. That's affectionate. Or at least, Harry thinks it is.
He kisses up Draco's arm, lets his tongue slip out to taste him. Draco's breath hitches, and Harry does it again, his kisses turning wet and open-mouthed. He's never cared much for this before, never wanted to taste every bit of someone. Right now, he'd lick Draco's armpit if he would let him, and he feels no shame in it. There doesn't seem to be room for doubt when he can feel how turned on Draco is. It crashes over him like waves in the wake of Harry's mouth and tongue moving over his skin. Harry's own arms, the soft skin above his wrists, prickle with sensation too. It hardly seems real, but all of it is. Above him, Draco is breathing hard already.
Songs bleed into each other, one to the next, and Draco sways with the beat and the rhythm of Potter's lips. Potter's kisses turn deeper, more insistent, and Draco rolls with it. They're barely dancing now, just moving in a hypnotic and dirty grind against each other. Draco can feel his cock stirring, another borderline novel feeling if he's frank. Not that sex is overly different for him now that he's less than human, or any less desirable. It's just been rather infrequent.
There's no distinctive way Harry can pinpoint how he can tell the arousal he's feeling isn't his own, but rather playing through him. It crests in a slow arc, from the base of his spine up between his shoulder blades and down over his chest. Goosebumps prickle down his thighs as his nipples harden, stiff nubs pressing against the soft material of his top, and it's not as if Harry's body couldn't feel this all on its own. He knows it isn't, though, that the stirring of his prick between his legs is because someone else is touching themselves, their pleasure rippling back over Harry. That it's because
"Wait here," he says gruffly, albeit slightly more pleasantly than before. He raps his knuckles against the wooden bar.
“Shag the living daylights out of each other?” Draco’s lips curved into a small smile. Harry shrugged, refusing to blush. Which, of course, had absolutely no effect on whether he was blushing or not.
He's stayed at Draco's before, not often but just a handful of times―after a particularly long stakeout, after a party Draco threw for his birthday. There are rooms upon room, it seems to Harry, the house almost as big as Grimmauld and far more well put together. Harry doesn't like it, not really. It's too clean, too minimalist in its layout. Everything has its right place, and fits there perfectly. Harry prefers a little comforting clutter, some of the warm disarray he associates with
"So what about…" Ginny later asks, after about Bellini number three and with her eggs Benedict thoroughly demolished. She tilts her head thoughtfully, elbow on the table and feet on the chair opposite her. "Tina?"
Draco doesn’t follow Harry down to the Greenhouses at night. At least, he wasn’t following him the first time.
great at talking about it afterwards and remembering to explain why they were acting out and not assume the other could read their minds. They were actually great at this relationship crap, and Harry had big plans of sticking around and annoying Draco into old age, and so, well, here they were.
He can’t move. He’s sure he physically could; there’s nothing wrong with his body. He can feel his legs, his arms, his fingers and toes. The muscles in his neck are taut and strained. He can’t move them though―nothing but his eyes, which scan the room, always landing back on the shape in the room. The shape that is invariably watching him back.
He writes a few more meandering paragraphs about feline adventures, and masterfully puts off addressing his situation entirely.
"Mm." Draco kisses the sensitive skin high on the inside of Harry's thigh. "Not exactly the same, but. I feel it. It makes me wonder." Draco turns his face again, all but rubbing it against Harry's skin. "Have you ever been fingered?"
"It is, though," Draco responds, working at the button of Harry’s jeans. Their knuckles brush against each other, Harry's breath catching in his throat each time Draco’s hand bumps against his prick. "You’re so stupidly fit."
"An investigator, of course." Draco raises one shoulder, casual and smug. He can’t hide it; he wants this. "I can find them."
For anyone else, this might be terrifying. It hasn’t left Draco unshaken, but he’s constantly aware that he’s not vulnerable in the ways he used to be, when monstrous serpents roamed the hallways of his childhood home and terrible wizards entered his mind at will. His body is not frail and mortal, Dark creatures can’t feed on him the way they once did when he was still made of tender human flesh. Whatever this is, Draco doesn’t feel intent from it. It seems only a presence, for now, one that creeps closer with tentative steps made of nightfall. Draco watches it back with equal curiosity.
"Hi." Potter's voice is small, and sounds tired. The rain is picking up in volume, almost drowning his words out. Draco resists the urge to lean closer to hear him. Potter feels like a skittish creature, something Draco doesn't want to scare away. He wants to keep drawing him closer, laying breadcrumb after breadcrumb until he willingly comes close enough to eat out of his hand.
"Good," responds Draco. He knows he sounds eager. He doesn't bother to hide it. "I'll make some Floo calls. Let some people know to expect me. We can surprise the rest."
Harry purses his lips then wrinkles his nose. "Fine. Gross. If you are really a person, then that’s quite rude, just so you know." Harry sighs, turning back to his typewriter. He all but dives on his phone for the distraction when it vibrates next to him.
― so welcome, but also so very not welcome at the same time. Harry swallowed his moan, feeling Draco’s cock slip wetly out of him, before he swatted Draco’s hand away.
"Fuck." Harry swallows hard as he feels the tingle of Draco's magic over his skin, and inside him, too, as Draco murmurs a quick spell.
He thought after last year that he couldn’t hate feel any lower about himself, but as always he was wrong.
. Draco’s loneliness curdles inside him. He eats the cucumber instead of pelting it at anyone, in an impressive display of self-restraint and maturity. Pity there’s no one here to admire how much he’s grown.
“Morning, Potter,” Draco says, slightly stiffly. He clears his throat, then gestures to the seat opposite him. “Hungry?”
He wonders if Draco is doing the same thing in his own head, as he looks down at Harry. If Harry tilted his head to the side, he could press his forehead against Draco’s knuckles. He’d like to. Harry hears the bedsheets rustle as Draco shifts his weight onto one arm, laying the hand closest to Harry’s head out palm down on the bed. He extends his fingers slowly, one by one, as if stretching them, each action deliberate and measured. Harry feels impossibly aware of how close they are to touching him, each movement of Draco’s hand almost ghosting across his skin. The room is so quiet he can make out each of Draco’s soft breaths. He’s suddenly aware that he’s holding his own.
“No, okay, just hear me out.” Harry held his hands out in front of him. “We both want this, right?” he said evenly, raising both brows. “Like, a baby?”
"He’s probably working," Harry says to the room, poking at his crust of toast. He waves his hand, flicking the wireless on for some company. He’s feeling a bit pathetic today, alone in his rented cottage and in the writing misery of his own making. He’s got six ParchText messages from Aggie and he knows,
Draco lies against Potter, boneless and straining to hold himself up on one hand. He struggles to extricate himself from the tangle of limbs, slipping sideways and Summoning his wand before cleaning them both up with a murmured spell. Harry's breathing is still heavy when he pulls Draco in for a lingering kiss. It's messy, uncoordinated, and Draco's still reeling in the aftershocks of pleasure when their bodies touch. It's dizzyingly good. Slowly, they both settle back against the pillows, like sediment settling in water. Potter's eyes slip closed between kisses and he forces them open again; each time it takes a bit longer than the last. Draco can tell when drowsiness overcomes him, Potter's fingers going lax in his hair and his hand falling against his neck. Draco almost smiles, stupid and tender, but it feels too vulnerable a thing to expose to the room, even dark as it is. He slowly arranges Potter's arms into something more comfortable for both of them, and then settles on his back next to him. He takes care not to move too far away, though.
that he wouldn’t dream of laying a tooth on someone who didn't expressly let Draco know they were up for it beforehand. That's never been Draco's thing. It shouldn't really be anyone's, but Draco's not an idiot. He's aware of what some vampires do. He's a product of it.
Harry’s staring at it. He’s been doing this for a good half hour, he estimates. It’s a good cat. Or at least, a pretty one. It’s ginger, and sleek, with white paws and a laziness about it that makes Harry want to nap in the sun for hours, too. It’s also dug up half of his spring onions, and had a rather obnoxious poo in one of the flower beds. Harry kind of wants to pet it. The cat, not the poo.
"It is a bit of a shithole, I guess," Potter belatedly agrees with him, peering around. There’s a bar at the far left of the room, across a dance floor that’s seen better days but probably not seen better patrons. On the other side of the room there are a series of doorways covered by faded velvet curtains. Draco fights the urge to roll his eyes. It’s tacky, and it’s making his skin crawl.
“Merlin, like an old raisin that’s been marinating in a sock.” Draco’s mouth stretched open, his face twisting into a grimace as he shuddered.
. Draco has often told Harry he himself finds Harry's house a total tip, so they're evenly matched in terms of disliking each other's choice of abode. It would be strange to Harry if they weren't, in a way.
"Yeah," Harry says again, unable to conjure up something more eloquent. He wants that, enough to make his stomach tense and his belly clench at just the thought of it. He can feel how much Draco wants to do it, too.
“I’m ruining the sheets,” he says after a moment, shifting his arse slightly against the bed to make his point. Draco’s face splits into a slow and sated smile. He shrugs, a languid move.
His arm is itching, and Draco rubs a palm over it, gritting his teeth. He taps his fingers on it, refuses to scratch at the healing bite. He just needs to let it heal, to not let his fingers wander and
,” Draco repeated, batting his foot against Harry’s head. Harry ran his hand contemplatively over the back of Draco’s thighs, felt the firm muscle and the catch of the hair on them.
"Oh shit, there, there," he babbles. Draco hums, pulling off Harry's cock for a moment to catch his breath. He brushes the same spot again, wanking Harry's prick with his free hand, the way slicked with Draco's spit. "Oh,
"Drink?" Draco suggests. He steps closer, just as Potter tilts his face down. His eyes are a little glassy, from either unshed tears or the hot, pent-up flush of anxiety. Draco can't tell. He's momentarily rendered mute by the startling colour of those eyes, their intensity. Even behind glasses, they are still the most striking green he's ever seen a human possess, clear irises all the way to the pupil, almost devoid of flecks of brown except right around that darkest centre. Green, upon green upon green―teal and emerald and soft gemstone jade. Potter's eyes are stunning. The expression in them is unreadable.
"Normally, I would do this the old-fashioned way." Draco sucks in a breath, kissing the knob of Harry's ankle. "Use real lube rather than conjured, but." He laughs self-deprecatingly. "I'm feeling rather pressed for time."
If he’d been a betting man, Draco would have put his Galleons on Longbottom being the one to be found seeking refuge amongst plants and leaves and shimmering blooms, but it’s not him. Draco would recognise the back of Potter’s head anywhere; he’s stared at it long enough, wishing ill will upon it when he was younger, and then futilely and shamefully wishing Harry would save him somehow last year. Draco would normally have a hard time admitting that to himself, but he doesn’t think he has a filter on his feelings anymore. He’s too tired (
Sluicing the warm water over his fingers and wrists feels heavenly. Harry waves a finger in front of the soap dispenser, feels the comforting tingle of Draco's magic as the clear liquid bubbles out and onto his palm. Harry finishes and dries his hands, catching sight of himself in the bathroom mirror. He looks no different that he did the morning before, he finds. The same tall, slim bloke, with short dark hair and wire-frame glasses. Draco's pyjama bottoms fit him well, resting low on his hips, where they meet the cream coloured Henley top, the three buttons undone. There's faint stubble on his cheeks, bags under his eyes, a thin scar on his forehead. Same old, same old. Harry can’t see a single thing that's different about him or would indicate there's a connection between himself and the man sleeping down the hallway. The same as there's no visible indication that he and Draco spent years hating each other, Harry supposes, before it grew into a friendship somehow, and now teetering around the edge of more.
"I know." Draco kisses him, deeply and properly, for a long heady moment before he pulls back. He places a hand on Harry’s chest when Harry tries to follow him, chasing his lips. "I’m
"And where else have you been?" he inquires, his voice low but loud enough to be heard over the din of music. Draco can feel Potter's intake of breath. He doesn't step away.
Ginny squeezes his arm again. "You’ve been through hell. I think you’re just really used to…sort of sucking it up, and making the best out of being a mushroom. You know, growing in the dark, making the best of living in shit," Ginny elaborates when Harry stares at her with, frankly warranted, confusion.
“I’m due for a tidy up, actually,” he replies, watching Draco reach into the jar of liver treats he keeps for Nettle. In his periphery, Harry can see her ears perk up at the prospect of food. He pushes his glasses up the bridge of his nose, before turning so he can properly watch Draco.
"Shit, I have to―I'm going to―" Draco suddenly pulls the hand on Harry's cock away, replacing it with his mouth. He's out of breath, in no better state than Harry as he slips his now free hand between his own legs. He groans, deep and relieved, around Harry's cock. Harry shuts his eyes, his mind whiting out as Draco sucks at the head of his cock as best he can while gasping at the reverberating pleasure between them himself. His fingers remain sure as they massage up against Harry's prostate. Harry's mouth falls open on a silent gasp.
, then confused, that he takes a full moment to just stare open-mouthed at him. He feels like the shock of it has given him heartburn. His chest is aching as his heart thumps against his ribcage.
They weren’t invited back to Sarah’s (not really that surprising) but Harry didn’t feel too bad about it. Well, no, he did feel genuinely pretty rubbish about it for the next week or so, all stirred-up inside and cranky, but it was bound to happen the more he and Draco had to rub elbows at social events. They had history, and it was not good; even the remotely positive times they had interacted had happened in the midst of a war, in mansions full of mad men or in a swirl of flames. Harry had just hoped this most recent blow up didn't make things too hugely fucking awkward the next time said elbow rubbing had to occur between them.
And there’s the kicker. Why would he, or should he even? It’s a miracle Draco’s even got them this far into the conversation. It’s a gamble, what Draco is about to say next. But he does it anyway. "The same reason you just told me what you’ve been doing, and why you waited for me here. Why you’re even talking to me."
He never wants to be responsible for another death, for another person's suffering, ever again in his life. Witnessing it, being the indirect cause of it through his desperate yet despicable actions, was enough.
“Yes.” Draco’s grin widened into almost Cheshire cat proportions. “I myself was conceived on my parents’ wedding night.”
"I want." Draco hums, closing his eyes as Potter kisses over the dip of his throat. His cock is aching, trapped in his jeans. "I want whatever you want to do," he answers honestly. He'd be embarrassed about how easy he's being, but he can find it in himself―especially not when Potter is being even easier, dropping to his knees in front of Draco.
Late at night, when his left arm itches with a phantom ache just under the remnants of the dark ink stain, Draco wishes he could do the same thing to himself. Just purge the dark magic back out, get the Mark truly off of him and get rid of all the horrors imbued into it. Draco can barely look at it, even though it’s faded to just a scar, and he scratches at it constantly, mindlessly. He’s broken the skin more than once, the spike of pain bringing his attention to the fact he’s rubbed a patch raw by dragging his nails over and over the same spot. It’s become an embarrassing habit, one he can’t stop or anticipate. He keeps his nails clipped as short as he can and wears long sleeves, tightly buttoned at the wrists, but it doesn’t make much of a difference. His mind wants the Mark off him, and the scratching is seemingly a new basic motor function it has added to its roster. Draco has a mad fear that one morning he’ll wake up and find he’s cut his arm off in his sleep, or gnawed it right off, but for now, he just has to contend with waking up with the healing, raw areas painfully stuck to his sheets. It’s disgusting, and humiliating, and the Mark scar is still visible as ever undeath the new marks Draco’s put there.
Around them, the bar has picked up steam, the music growing louder and the conversation of the patrons getting rowdier with it. Draco clears his throat. "So what do you want from me, then?"
"I told you I was shit at this bit," Draco replies, voice low. His hands are on each of Harry’s hips, slipping around to his back. He fiddles with the hem of Harry’s jeans, fingers in the belt loops. The movement pulls Harry ever so lightly closer, belly to belly.
Potter smiles, quickly, then adjusts his glasses. It could be a nervous habit. Draco wishes he knew him well enough to be able to read it properly.
He waits a few more moments, but Draco doesn’t reply, and Harry slouches back to the kitchen to his badly-brewed tea and blank typewriter page.
sleep, will you? Definitely not creepy at all." Potter’s smile has turned cheeky as he pulls down the covers in order to get under them. The thick, dark curtains in Draco’s bedroom, as well as the charms on them, completely blot out the rising sun, and the lamp on Draco’s side table casts only the scantest light. The room is quite dark, but Draco can see Potter’s expression well enough. "I’d much rather you sleep with me, if those are the two options."
“But hang on, if we’ve been bonded, shouldn’t we, y’know.” Harry flaps his free hand about, then lets it flop to his knee. “Feel a bit different? Feel a bit anything?” Harry shrugs one unimpressed shoulder. “I feel fine, just a bit cranky and tired.”
“You’re ridiculous,” Draco surmises as Harry settles his back against the log (not as bad as settling his arse on it, he finds. He rests his shoulder just against Draco’s calf, too, trying to steal a little warmth. There’s a low-level warming charm on their hideout, but it’s far from keeping them toasty, as such. Too much magic will give off a tangible and easily discernible trace for savvy criminals, rendering their surveillance moot. All they’ve got allowance for on this trip is a mild concealment charm, a Muffliato for their voices, and a heating charm that should ideally save them from hypothermia considering it’s just gone midnight and it’s February. Draco’s the one who’s cast the charms, and Harry basks a little in the tingling, misty feeling of his magic. There’s always something jumpy about Draco’s magic, his spells, as if they’re brimming with energy and excitement. Harry likes it.
Her name is Darya. She is deceptively difficult to find, this person Potter is looking for. Draco owes favours now, which is not uncommon, but these sound like
“Mmm. Read it.” Draco watches as Harry unfolds the parchment scroll, his expression curious more than apprehensive. That settles the spike of worry in Harry’s gut a little.
Draco does rest his hand on Potter's knee now, just lightly. Potter takes a long moment before he responds, which Draco takes as positive. He hates being so dire, so dramatic. All the same, he isn't exaggerating.
“No, I‘m not always bloody hungry, Draco!” Harry clenched his jaw, shaking his hair out of his eyes.
This, Harry reasons, is why he’s never going to get over his crush. With a sense of deep, deep lack of self-preservation, he sends three kisses back, and then sticks his phone under a chair cushion so he won’t be tempted to stare at it longingly for the entire afternoon.
Draco arranges to meet with her the next day, and Potter doesn’t object when Draco declares he will be coming with him. He’ll need to do the introductions. Potter is a stranger to these parts, although he made good headway on his own. Draco is better trusted by default, though, being from a Dark family, and with creature magic running through his veins.
With that, Draco stands, fully accepting his date is an utter farce and his mood is completely tanking along with it. He’ll be damned if he’ll spend the evening in a bar he doesn’t care for, getting poked in the eye by a sprig of rosemary every time he tries to take a swig of his drink, and being stood up by some tosser. Etienne, Draco thinks his name was. He looked fit on the dating app. Draco will have forgotten about him by tomorrow.
Potter laughs, once, but it's not a happy sound. He shrugs with a loose gesture of limbs, shaking his head as he does so. "No fucking idea, Malfoy," he responds. His voice is thick with emotion.
running through his head as he felt Draco’s cock twitch and spurt inside him. He pulled his lower lip into his mouth, reciting old Quidditch moves in his head and trying not to get swept away by the feeling of Draco’s stomach as it brushed over his aching cock. Draco hissed as Harry ground his arse against Draco’s hips, keeping him inside him. Pale hair tickled over Harry’s cheek, then his neck as Draco panted above him then bent his head.
"Something in the room," Draco repeats, searching Potter’s expression for an answer. He already knows what Potter means, though, what he must be referring to given the context. "You," he deduces, almost hesitant to say it out loud. Potter’s expression tells him he’s correct.
is not exactly what Draco had in mind when he suggested a drink, but Potter appears to have taken to the idea with both hands. Or at least, with a drink in both hands, as it were.
Draco laughed again, incredulous and pink-cheeked as he stared down at Harry. “Okay, if that’s what you ―”
It’s not elegant. It has absolutely no finesse, and lands harder than Harry intended, his teeth pressing up against the inside of his own lips. It’s perfect. Draco huffs a surprised noise, right into Harry’s mouth. Their teeth clack together as Draco smiles, Harry still dropping nipping kisses over his lips.
The river winds slowly beside them as they share a cigarette. Potter’s free hand is in his pocket, his hair falling over his eyes and over the dark frame of his glasses.
He’s always noticed Potter was handsome, good looking. It’s another thing entirely to let himself be affected by it.
Draco nods, his breath coming in hitches in between the kisses he plants across Harry's collarbone down to the collar of Harry’s top. "Yeah," Draco murmurs, pulling at the hem of Harry's top, then leaning back so Harry can lift his arms. Draco drops it carelessly on the floor, leans back in quickly to kiss at Harry’s shoulder. "Everywhere I touch you." He kisses the top of Harry's bare chest, as far as he can reach while bent over him. Harry runs his fingers over Draco's shoulder blades. "I can
sometimes as well, yeah?" She reaches up and pinches his cheek, slow and tender and oddly motherly. Harry’s eyes feel a bit warm. "Say no to the book you don’t want to write," she says softly. "Let people down. Don’t finish something you started." Harry looks down at her, her head resting on his shoulder and her eyes fond and bright with the drink.
He means to warn Draco, but he barely gets a chance as his balls tighten, and his orgasm barrels towards him like a speeding train. His already laboured breathing turns to loud gasps and cut off sounds as he shifts against the bed, shoulder pressing down into the mattress and toes flexing. His mouth feels too empty, orgasm skittering along his skin but just out of reach until he shoves two of his fingers in there, then sucks on them hard.
Draco swallows, momentarily blindsided by the compliment. "At what, Potter?" Draco clears his throat, fighting the flush of colour that wants to spread from his neck and trip over his cheeks. "At staring down surly barmen and remembering puerile code?"
Draco laughs once, soft and under his breath, then slants a glance in Potter's direction. Potter's standing so close that were Draco to turn his head their lips might touch. The thought comes unbidden into Draco's mind, like a seed carried on the wind and landing on fertile ground. It takes root before he can brush it away. His pulse begins to race, the heat of Potter's body where he's pressed close to Draco's back amplifying the cloying heat of the room.
Agatha wrinkles her nose at Harry’s manners. "Depends." She sets her tea cup down, then takes a biscuit for herself. "Can we get a curry? And do you have wine?"
a pilchard,” is the only thing he can think to add to Draco’s annoyed soliloquy. It’s all a bit much to take in; he can be forgiven for being somewhat off his game.
“‘s’fine.” Draco waved a hand, still loose and groggy from having only just woken up. “‘m a light sleeper.”
"Well, you walked in here with a cat and you’ve been avoiding everyone for a fortnight, so. Not too hard to piece together." Ginny pats his hand. "Do you want to talk about it?" she offers sympathetically. "By which I mean, which one would you like to talk about first, because we’re talking about this before you leave here today, whether I have to ply you with more fruity cocktails or not."
Potter sucks cock like he loves it. Draco doesn't mind it himself. It's fun, it's good, it's hot. But it's not at the top of his list of things to do with someone else, unless the mood particularly strikes him. It’s never something he’s desperate to give. Potter sucks cock like he’s
, plus Hermione does have a point; Harry’s not really good at stopping, it seems, at standing still or letting himself have breaks. He’s a time-filler, a silence-avoider. His first novel―published under a pseudonym―was a roaring success, his second was too, but also came with his identity being properly rumbled. His third novel seemed like it would be a breeze, but the pressure seems to be mounting and Harry suspects he just…doesn’t want to write it. At all. He doesn’t like to think he’s been throwing himself into writing in order to procrastinate from getting on with his life, but he doesn’t want to outright lie to himself either. So he ends up just stood there in front of the mirror in his weird cottage-escape hideout, toothpaste foam around his mouth, in need of a shave, and as stuck as he ever was.
feel unexpected. Potter is tentative, slow, feeling Draco out and Draco responds in kind. Their lips move against each other in soft motions, the kiss deepening but never growing any faster. Draco feels overwhelmed by it, by all of it. It’s too much. It’s perfect.
Draco lets his lips curl into a sneer. "So I am." He takes a mouthful of his drink, lets the bitter Campari roll around his tongue as he fights to regain some composure. "And what are you?"
Draco pulled back searching his face. He slowly shook his head, nose brushing against Harry’s and grey eyes soft. “Wouldn’t’ve been the end of the world,” he mumbled, kissing Harry slowly, and then harder. He ran his hand down Harry’s arm, down to where he held the paper, and slipped his palm around it. Harry sighed into the kiss, his head spinning and his heart thumping.
Draco offers him a wry smile. "Thank you, Harry." He sits. Harry motions for Draco to pour the tea. They lapse into an awkward silence, which only ends when Draco makes an annoyed grunt.
for that matter. Honestly, was he gestating an entire fucking Quidditch team, including equipment and a commentator?
“Show off,” Draco said fondly as he flipped the paper at Harry. It fluttered to the floor and he crowded Harry up against the bathroom sink. “Had to steal the limelight didn’t you,” he muttered gently, eyes shining and bright as he smiled, kissing Harry's cheek, his jaw, his temple.
Harry breathes in deeply, watches goosebumps rise along Draco's skin as he breathes out again. "I want to kiss you," he manages, the words mostly a breathless jumble against Draco's arm. Draco understands him well enough, though.
"Potter," he says, dropping his cigarette and stubbing it out with the toe of his boot. He uses the moment to surreptitiously check Potter out. He’s dressed down as well, but not so much they won’t get in the door. If there even is a dress policy here; Draco suspects not, based on the people he’s seen tripping in through the front doors. The place seems like a complete dive. Potter looks more than passable in his jeans and dark top, plaid shirt open over it. His sleeves are rolled up again, exposing bare forearms. Draco casts his eyes away from that particular part of Potter. It’s not that he’s prone to a lack of self control when it comes to bare skin, no matter how much he wants the life force running under it. He’s a vampire but not a brute, for pity’s sake. Historically, however, he
"Yes, please." Draco turns his head, then presses his hot lips against Harry’s neck. "I’ll stay as long as you’ll have me, Potter."
The Healers seemed less confused about what had happened in the marshy Fens, but they were also infuriatingly vague when it came to sharing that information. Even after being poked and prodded and magically examined for what seemed like longer than they were even unconscious, the Healers didn’t seem inclined to give anything other than vague answers and annoying hums when Harry asked what had happened. A very valid question, he felt, considering that it was far from usual for him to be mesmerised by a shiny thing in the sky, go all tingly, and then pass out. At least not without having had a few drinks, Draco kept teasing him. Harry didn’t feel overly different, and definitely not like something significant had occurred, which was in itself rather concerning; Dark Magic could be sneaky, Harry had found. He really hoped he and Draco hadn’t managed to step in some somehow and that was why the sky had gone squiffy and Harry had felt such an odd zap and comfort at all the places he and Draco touched.
Harry nods, rubbing the small bottle between both palms and then offering it to Draco. “This might help.” He presses it against Draco’s thigh when Draco doesn’t move to take it. “It’s Murtlap Essence,” Harry goes on. “It’ll make it feel a bit better, and help, like. If it’s sore. It’ll help you leave it alone.”
Draco turns his head, running on instinct rather than sense. His nose brushes Potter's cheek, over the faintest of stubble there. Potter's breathing remains even, but deliberately so. The air feels tight around them, thrumming with the vibrations of the music and the tension strung taut between their bodies. Draco feels almost woozy from it, drunk on stimulation. Potter's eyes appear fixated on Draco's lips. Draco licks them, opening his mouth to finally speak.
"That's fine," Potter says. He squeezes Draco's arm, once, and Draco lets a breath out through his nose. "That's fine," Potter repeats, looking at Draco. There's a question in his voice this time.
mean?” Draco leans back himself, arms folded across his chest. “What does Shakespeare have to do with this?”
"Touche." Ginny chinks her glass against Harry’s. "So, terrible pet names aside, how have you been? How is the book going?" she asks with a smirk.
“Oh, fuck,” Harry groaned, kissing him wet and deep. “I don't think I can, on my stomach,” he mumbled in between slick slides of his lips, pressing himself harder against Draco’s leg. “Or my back, to be honest,” he added, laughing softly at the idea of of trying to pull his legs up. He probably could ― he was fit, and still agile enough these days ― but he doubted it would be very comfortable, without, perhaps, a series of complicated levitation spells to keep his legs in the air. Or maybe a winch. He wasn’t sure how sexy that would end up being.
Potter answered immediately with his mouth, fitting his lips firmly against Draco's; their mouths opened involuntarily, tongues sliding against each other with increasing urgency until Potter pulled back, pupils dark. He twisted his hands into the soft wool of Draco's jumper, staring at him with naked lust on his face.
Potter glanced back at him, a quick flicker of green eyes before he turned resolutely away and strode into the kitchen, casting a "Yeah," over his shoulder, followed by something that sounded suspiciously like, "Might as well get it over with."
The scene replayed itself in Harry's mind. Again he saw the glare of a curse shattering over a shield, Malfoy with his hand raised, the twisting arc of blue light...and a dark figure behind him.
Potter's hand worked its way down, caressing Draco's inner thigh as he laid kisses along his throat, teeth scraping lightly at the juncture of his neck and collarbone.
A long suppressed hurt and anger bubbled up and boiled over, taking him quite by surprise and Harry clenched his fists involuntarily, torn between rage, bemusement that he still felt that way when so many other, bigger things had happened in the intervening years, and an overpowering irritation that despite everything at least part of him still wanted to snog the face off Malfoy.
"So, I understand yourself and Mr Weasley want to look through some old school records..." She gestured in the general direction of the library. "Madam Pince has set aside a room for you next to the library. I'll have tea and biscuits sent up directly. And you, Mr Malfoy, will be conversing with Professor Snape. His portrait is in my office of course, but I'll give you two some time alone." She smiled at Draco and took his elbow." Come along; Severus is expecting you."
Harry turned around then, a crazy smile pulling at his mouth, to find himself chest to chest with a dishevelled Malfoy. Whatever he'd been planning to say abandoned him, the words lost in the warm touch of Malfoy's breath, the unguarded look in his eyes.
It was clear from Potter's expression that he had complete faith in the female member of the Golden Trio, not that there was any historical evidence to suggest that faith was misplaced.
Draco studied the weave of cloth over his knees and swallowed hard, blinking furiously and thinking his father would have been so disappointed in his lack of self-control, not that he gave a fuck about that any more. To his surprise he realised that the warmth of Potter's jean-clad thigh was right next to him and then the man's hand descended onto his shoulder and gave a gentle squeeze. Draco's skin shuddered at the quiver of magic that he could feel even through the cloth and he fought against the instinct to lean into the touch.
"Your training is the reason you survived Azkaban; it's the reason you survived the Dark Lord." Snape sighed. "The reason behind the training was deeply flawed, but that does not make the lessons themselves any less valuable. You need your wits about you now more than ever."
More anxious by the second, he rushed away, Ron trailing behind him, looking rather puzzled at the sudden haste. A few minutes later and cursing himself at every step, Harry burst into the office, the door slamming into the wall and rebounding with the speed of his entry. Malfoy, still seated in Harry's chair, raised a laconic eyebrow.
For some reason Harry found the thought of Malfoy dying inexplicably distressing and after a while he shuffled down the mattress a little way until he could take hold of the cold, elegant fingers. The flow of magical energy beneath his fingertips was fading rapidly as the other man slipped inexorably away. Harry gathered himself with an effort and concentrated on pushing a steady flow of his own magic through the strangely intimate joining of their hands.
"I'm trying to help you," he said quietly. "I pulled your file; I know things haven't been easy for you. You say you're not involved in this potions thing, and I believe you."
"Of course," she said carefully. "Romani may not have actually kept anything illegal in any of these warehouses."
Gradually Draco unfurled his fingers from their white-knuckled grip on Potter's soft hoodie. He moved back a fraction and glanced down, relieved to find that he was still wearing Potter's spare pyjama bottoms and old t-shirt.
Harry was fuming at the easy dismissal of the situation, angry enough that a quill on Robards' desk began to tremble and quake behind his back. He wanted to shout and rant, but knew it would be counter-productive and would somehow make Malfoy's theory less acceptable. He fought instead for control, mildly shocked when Malfoy stepped forwards casually, his knuckles brushing against Harry's and transmitting a cool stream of reassurance. It allowed him to regain just enough balance to calm his roiling magic and Harry swallowed, taking a deep breath, the quill settling back against the desk.
There was a whoop of excitement in the street and the sound of running feet that had no further cause to be stealthy.
"Okay," said Harry easily, stopping to straighten out the sheets and plump the pillows, careful to keep his movements slow and calm as though he was dealing with a flighty animal. When he was done he wandered across to the window, opened it a crack to allow the ingress of some cool night air and then pulled the curtains back together. Only a couple more steps took him to Malfoy's side, where he leaned his back against the wall and slid down until he was on his haunches next to the huddled figure.
Neither the heightened colour nor the fact were lost on the other man, who smirked at him again. Oddly, Harry didn't find the expression as annoying as it used to be at Hogwarts, it being preferable to lines of pain on Malfoy's face.
"I never said it was a coincidence," noted Potter defensively. "I was on a stake-out a few days earlier and you walked past, so yeah, I wondered if maybe... Then I went back yesterday and you were there, and you know the rest."
His hair shone pale gold in the light from the little window and Harry found himself suddenly tongue-tied in a way he had not been since he first noticed Cho Chang back at Hogwarts.
Harry slammed the gates closed rather more vigorously than intended and the lift shot backwards, causing him to stagger into Malfoy. A cool hand against the small of his back steadied him, but then made no attempt to move away.
"Do you want me to ask for another room' til we're done?" Potter sounded resigned and actually started shuffling scrolls around as though he was planning to move there and then.
"You're beautiful," he breathed suddenly, shocking himself as much as Malfoy, who froze, his cock jerking against Harry's lips.
"I think that would be a good idea." Then she added carefully, "You two seemed to be getting on better?"
Malfoy thrust hard then, hands twisted in Harry's hair as he rutted into his throat with sharp gasps.
"No," said Harry, a bit breathless from wanting to kiss the corner of that perfect mouth. "No, you're not. Not any more. What you're doing, it could really make a difference."
After the shock of the showdown in the warehouse the boys gather themselves. The pressure is on to solve the case - will this prevent Harry realising that his hopes and Draco's expectations do not align?
There was no answer but a small whisper of sound drew Harry's attention to the wall on the far side of the bed. He sent a wordless lumos at the lamp and saw that Malfoy was huddled at the foot of the wall, his knees drawn loosely up to his chest and his arms wrapped around them.
The bowls flew back to their place on the dresser and parked themselves neatly on the shelf. Two cheap ceramic dishes hurtled towards the table and rattled to a halt.
The contents of the file left a bad taste in Harry's mouth and played on his mind as he resumed his vigil in the park. What would a Pureblood, denied the use of his magic, be able to do in the post-Voldemort world? Would he perhaps be forced to resort to nefarious activities to make a living? And why did it have to be him, Harry, assigned to this particular case? Had he not had enough years worrying about Malfoy? Was fate about to bring them together again?
“Yeah, I mean.” He stuffed his hands into his jeans. “Well, we don’t have to. S’just an idea. You know, considering we weren’t really sure, well, we hadn’t decided who would, like. Carry the baby, and this way we don't have to keep weighing up the pros and cons and playing one-on-one Quidditch to decide it, which. I mean we just keep tying every time we do, so.” He looked at the fertility potions, sitting innocuously on the bench, and then back again. “So this is a good decider,” he mumbled.
"Well." Draco taps the nib of his quill on his parchment in three short motions, before he drops it. He faces Potter properly. "I know someone there. I was thinking about it, while you slept. She… could know something useful. Merlin knows she owes me enough favours to tell us what she does know, anyway. We could go there. Together. If you like."
“And the body wash okay?” Draco adds, as if Harry hadn’t spoken. His attention is fully focused on buttering his piece of toast, right out to each corner. There’s the hint of a smile at the corners of his mouth, and cheeks are flushed. The dip of his throat looks pink too.
out like he’s poison, Draco is sure of that, but when he sees him between classes, Harry looks about as uncomfortable in there as Draco feels. Maybe it’s not the castle at all, but just their own skin they’re not so good at fitting into these days.
) to really stop the things that come into his head, or stop himself from acknowledging what they are. First year, he wanted Potter to be his friend the first time he saw him, then hated him vehemently from the moment Harry turned him down; last year, Draco desperately wanted Potter to somehow save him from himself as he opened the castle up and let the people he hated right inside.
Draco rests his elbows on the counter, refusing to back away. He knows this dance, has done it many times before. He's pleased to notice Potter doesn't appear bothered in the slightest either, standing next to Draco and with his hands stuffed in his pockets, deceptively unthreatening and presumably close to his wand.
"Okay." Potter nods. "I've heard you. So." Potter smiles wryly. "I guess we do this, and just try not to kill each other then, yeah?"
"Shall I get another round in, then?" Ginny suggests, bumping her shoulder against Harry's. "Wash all this stink of emotions off us?"
Harry, elbow resting on the arm of his chair and chin in his hands, taps two fingers against his lips. “
Draco shrugged. “Worth it. Besides, it’s good practice for when the baby comes and neither of us ever, ever sleep again.” He ended in an ominous whisper, and Harry choked out a laugh.
This time, Draco shakes his head. “You can be hard to read, really. Far from obvious.” He looks up at Harry through his lashes. “Did you not suspect about me, then?” Draco asks, batting the question back at Harry.
“Yes, I guess so.” Harry folds his shirt sleeves up to his elbows, eyes off the spread of food before him. He decides he wants tea in lieu of coffee. “As well as can be expected, I’d say. Oh, I hope you don’t mind, I used your Floo before.” Harry adds a splash of milk to his tea. “To call Ginny, ask her to drop me off some clothes for the rest of the weekend. She’s got the codes for all my wards, knows her way around my closet,” he clarifies at Draco’s blank look.
“I just had an orgasm, Potter,” Draco said smugly, brushing his hair back and rolling his shoulders. “Of course I look pleased.” He looked down at Harry’s impressive erection, licked his lips. “You sure you don’t want me to…” He made another languid gesture with his hand, and Harry groaned. He pushed Draco’s fingers away, slipped his hands behind Draco’s knees and dragged him closer.
"I love you, too, darling." Ginny sighs, reaching out to place her hand over his. Her rings are cool against his hot skin. "I take it neither are exactly making progress, then?"
It's clear Potter is no stranger to places like this, to the dirty grind of a hookup. The crowd around them is thick and in constant motion, pushing them close together. Draco’s jacket is too hot. The sweat makes his thin t-shirt cling to his skin. Potter’s hands feel like brands on his hips. Draco curves his own around the back of Potter’s neck.
"The cat story." Agatha beckons with one hand as she measures out tea with the other. She doesn’t look up.
Draco lets out the breath he’s been holding, then sits back in his chair. He quickly finishes the last of his drink, then stands. Potter hasn’t said anything, hasn't reacted, and Draco wants to leave as soon as he can and let Potter keep mulling it over.
even while lugging a small human around inside him and bursting at the seams, thank you very much, Deputy Head Auror Stephens. Harry knew the fucker was eyeing his job, what with all the faux-nice comments about how Harry was
“Excuse you,” Draco shoots back, footsteps heavy as he starts to ascend the stairs, Harry and Nettle following him up to the bedrooms. “This house is barely half the size of the Manor.”
It occurs to him, while Potter is dressing, that they haven’t broached the topic of sleeping arrangements. There isn’t a sofa Potter can sleep on, not really; the chaise longue in this flat is too small for anyone over four feet tall to comfortably sleep on. When Draco looks back, Potter has finished dressing. The cuffs of the pyjamas bottoms are a little too long; Potter has rolled them up, exposing knobbly ankles. Draco feels strangely endeared by this small thing, and by the visual confirmation that he is taller than Potter. He drags his eyes away and back to Potter’s tired face.
The dinner affair went well with the occasional of Draco asking them if the food was good or if there's something he can help them with. They locked eyes a couple of times with Draco giving him his sweetest smile he could muster.
“What is Draco is doing? Dobby must get to work before Master Malfoy notice Dobby is missing.”, asked Dobby frantically scared.
Harry thread his fingers through Draco’s luscious long blonde hair. Draco kissed Harry’s stubble beard, kissed him under the chin because he felt like it.
They walked out of Knockturn Alley into the bright Diagon Alley, whoever invented both of the alley are genius especially the gloomy state of Knockturn Alley. They walked to Madam Malkin’s shop, mother are already waiting for them in front of the shop, standing proudly and looking down at her inferior in disdain.
“I’ll talk to you later, okay baby? I love you forever,” kissing him on his red cheeks and standing up, he kissed Harry on his lips, connecting his lips with his, muttering into the kiss.
“But Sirius was in Gryffindor so there is probably a 50% chance that I will end up in Gryffindor,” he reasoned his father.
He didn’t look at Severus in the face, he doesn’t need his pity, he just need someone to listen to his mourning, that’s it but then something truly shocking him happened.
The lessons end and they were walking to the Great Hall when Harry get a notifications from a groupchat. Draco never bring his phone with him. With Harry hand holding his while his other hand took out his phone beside him.
‘Hey! That’s my clothes you are wearing!’, screamed Pansy from a far as they went inside the room. Harry slammed the door shut and vanished their clothes just by the snap of his fingers.
“Good morning Mother and Father,” she walked into the room and took a seat on the long couch, trailed by Iris behind, their hands clasped together, pulling Iris down to sit beside her.
He then pulled Draco towards their destination, feet rushed them to their bedroom and Harry fulfilled his promise and fucked him hard. He did faint as he rides Harry’s cock and slumped down to his hairy muscular chest once his last ounce of energy are gone, he moved him to the side and continuously fucking him side way and Harry never pulled out of him until the next working.
Draco frantically bobbed his head, releasing their intertwined hands and pulled his arse cheeks apart, he held himself by his shoulders against the bed.
A knock on the door interrupting him dressing Jamie up, he looked up and his eyes straight up meeting his husband emerald green eyes.
“So what do you thing about it?” asked Pansy again after he has taking out his frustration by flicking the owner of the book’s face on the cover.
“So what do you want us to do? To accept this relationship? Not just she is a woman, she’s a halfblood. She is everything that we are against off.”
The lithe boy screamed as he felt the enormous length entered his tight tiny hole. He clenched his hole signaling that he was ready for him.
‘FUCK OF COURSE IT’S NOT GOING TO WORK, TROLLS DOESN’T EVEN HAVE A BRAIN TO BE CONFUSED FOR’, he shouted in agony.
“So you can’t shrink an object that contains another object in it,” he said. Draco nodded his head while holding one of his tiny silk pajamas. He felt stupid because now he have to Engorgio all of his clothes, books and the only photograph of his biological family. He never parted away from the photograph and would always bring it anywhere with him.
Before he presented into his secondary gender, he thought he’s going to be a beta because to present as an omega, they usually hit the age of twelve, a normal age for puberty. Even then, he felt the creepy eyes of the alpha’s watching him, especially Riddle.
“Jamie, why don’t you come here for me. I miss having you in my arms.” coaxed Draco softly as they were sitting themselves down on the bench they installed in the perimeter of their house.
The table on the right side cheered enthusiastically as Hannah Abbot went to sit down at the Hufflepuff Table.
‘Your hand are cold, Malfoy’, said Potter as he looked at Draco in awed while Draco was holding his hand still to tend the injury. ‘Well, it’s good for my future boyfriend then, he could warm me up’, said Draco as he looked up , the hand that was holding his hand tightened.
The sorting for the first year already ended and he still hasn't seen the black haired boy. He was agitated because Potter should be across from his right now, eating the Welcoming Feast. Where was he?
Cassie hugged him tightly once they reached his room, “Don’t listen to what father says.”, whispered Cassie in his ears. He did not hug her back and push her off of him and told her that he needs some times.
Harry gave the phone to Draco, he held it in his hand, stretching his arms so that Harry’s face could be in the frame too and he answered all of her questions and then decided to ask her about her day filming the upcoming new movie she starred on.
She pulled Celestial to her and hugged her tightly, her hand giving comfort by stroking her back in a slow motion, while kissing her forehead.
Harry holding on to Draco like a lifeline, his huge muscular arms wrapped around Draco as he fuck him intensively. His face buried into Draco’s neck, exhaling hot breathe air into his neck.
“Go away! Don’t come near me ever again. I hate you and I don’t want to see your ugly face!” she screamed while trying to find her tampon and when she realised she was out of tampons, it was making her more frustrated.
The bell rang when they opened the door, Madam Malkin greets and instructs them to stand in front of the mirror on the stool since she was occupied by lots of children their age. They then heard the bell ring indicate that someone has walked inside, they heard that Madam Malkin told a child to stands besides them, they heard the footsteps walking until it came to a stop beside them, they turned their head, and there stood a boy who have messy black and wore glasses on the stool.
He finally came for the second time followed by Draco’s fourth time as he stroked his own cock. He cum and cum and cum inside of Draco . They never did use protection since the first time they slept together.
‘Now take the rose thorns but be very caref-,’ his sentence was cut off by Potter’s screeched. Potter accidentally cut his finger and now his finger are bleeding. Draco rolled his eyes since Potter never took precaution. He went over to him and took his finger in his hand, examined it.
“Harry- I can’t feed you if kept teasing me”, moaned Draco as he bucked his arse. Harry chuckled at his antics, pulled his fingers out and went back to Draco’s nipples, grabbing his boobs which fill his hold hands as he palming Draco’s nipples, he can’t wait to suck on his husband’s breast.
Professor was calling Daphne when he was dazing out of thought. He turned to her when she walked near him and gave her a squeeze on her shoulder and Cassie walked to stand beside him.
From afar, four footsteps could be heard, approached him, made him pull out of his deep thoughts, He raised his head and stood up greeting the welcoming visitors. “How many hours have you been waiting?” asked the man near him. The man has light brown hair flecked with gray, though he is still quite young.
“Are you trying to warn him about the danger at Hogwarts?”, asked Draco again as his hand repeatedly stroking Dobby’s head. Dobby nodded his head again.
“Whatever you said Longbottom.” he screamed back as he cupped one hand over his mouth since he was holding his camera.
It was already eight o'clock at night when they arrived home, Jamie was already sleeping soundly in the car and Harry had to pick him up, change his clothes and lay him down on his soft bed.
“HARRY! GET YOUR ARSE BACK HOME NOW! THE BABIES ARE COMING!” and the dragon disappeared into thin air, as he waited for Harry, Jamie placed his small hand on his stomach, doing the same thing he saw his Papa do when his Mama was in pain.
When they arrived, there were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. No sign of their teacher, Madam Hooch or even the Gryffindors. The school brooms looked a little dusty, some are bendy and he sure hopes that when they fly high up in the sky, there won’t be any problem or he might tell his Mother about this.
That was the year he realised he has a crush on his now boyfriend and told his friends and parents about it but it didn’t go too well. He rather did the dare than tell them about it, it was the secret he rather buried with him because he was ashamed to talk about it.
He with his back on them, raised his voice so they could hear them, “Next time, I think you should change your attitude when meeting someone new, you know because people look down on the poor, Weasel, Good day”, and nodded his head.
“The Weasley boy surely has a problem with everyone,” he thought to himself and a piece of hatred towards the boy grew in his heart.
He gave the baby to Narcissa while holding his teary eyes that trying to leak out of his eyes, Narcissa accepted it and handled the baby with care. She nodded at Sirius and he knew what it meant.
‘Draco! Stop! Walking! Like! A! Bloody! Stick!’, she screamed. ‘ Walked the way you usually walk’, as she walks back to put the phone back against the window glass.
As Harry played with his nipples, Draco unbutton Harry’s shirt, pushing the shirt off of him, displaying his olive toned skin.
Draco doesn't think she was reading the magazine since the magazine was upside down. He was going to ignore the girl and stepped back out of the compartment when suddenly she looked up. Their eyes met and they were having a silent war with their eyes, who could break other glances first wins.
“Just let him wear whatever he wants, Draco,”, smoothing Harry at him, he walked inside the room, towards Draco who was sprawling on the floor with his huge pregnant belly, Jamie’s clothes scattered around him as he was messily trying to help Jamie few moments ago.
Although he knows Jamie are tired, he still won’t close his eyes because he’s stubborn when it was time for his nap.
‘Tik Tok videos’, answered Pansy as she looked up from her phone and show it to Potter. ‘I want to recreate it with Draco but he didn’t want to’, she continues.
When they are done, two fifth-year Slytherin perfects instruct the first-year to follow them to their Common Room. They walked down to the dungeon where the Slytherin Common Room was. On the way to the common room, Draco accidentally tripped Blaise and with exchange, Blaise whacked him in the head, Pansy and Cassie was sniggering from behind.
It was uncommon and when he thought about it, maybe that’s why he had a tiny crush on him and his talent on playing football but because he doesn’t follow up with football controversy since it was not his cup of tea. He only saw his pictures in the passing while scrolling through Instagram.
When Draco and Cassie were little, they would practice riding the broom with Mother watching them cautiously, scared that if she turned her attention away from them, they would be missing or worse break a bone, sometimes they would sneak out without Mother. Sometimes, he would ride with the house-elves, mostly Dobby because most of them are afraid of Father and although Mother disagreed with the behaviour, she kept her quiet.
“Baby- we are in public,” said Draco as he was trying very hard not to moan in a public area, especially in front of Jamie and that shook Harry out of his dilemma.
He came closer to her, “Hello cousin,” he greets her with no hint of anything, his tone was bland, emotionless. She gave him a warm smile and asked, ”What brings you here Sirius?” They were quiet for a while and finally he spoke, “I need your help with something,” he tried to speak but nothing came out.
Draco knows Harry was looking so he invited the Ravenclaw to touch him further by reciprocating the action. Just a light touch on the arm, nothing more but that small action makes his blood boil.
There was a yell of ‘Get him, Dad!’; Mrs Weasley was shrieking ‘No, Arthur, no! ; ‘Gentlemen, please - please!’ cried the assistant. Draco wanted to get far away from the scene without anyone noticing, when he remembered something, he has perfecting his disillusionment charm, he casts it over him and Cassie.
“What do you have there, baby” said Draco as he peeked his eyes inside. Harry’s hand went up to his eyes and closed his vision.
When he felt the spell lift off of him, he quickly stand up and dust his robes off while glaring at his sister.
Draco had been walking around his house, trying to find his troublemaker son when he realized that he had not seen him since he told him that he was going to cook dinner. He thought for once his son listened to him but when he had done with his cooking and called out to his son. He heard a sound giggle somewhere in the house.
“Don’t you think that you put too much pressure on yourself, star?” Harry asked with a frown, worriedly scanning Draco’s whole body. Seeing the effect of his overworking boyfriend. “Have you eaten yet?”
As he thrust into Draco, Draco’s body slowly dropped down to the bed and Harry’s arms were the only support to hold himself up.
Draco turned his head towards Cassie for help, maybe backing him up or anything but she had the audacity to try and sniffen her laugh. He decided to find an empty compartment or maybe along the way, he could find Potter and his friends mocking him or something.
Draco looked over at him and saw that his face was red like his hair from embarrassed. He patted him invisibly in his head.
It took them a while to order but once they were done, Draco wrote in their orders in his notepad as elegantly as he could while his eyes were trying very hard not to stare at the oldest son of the Potters, who weirdly are still sneaking glances at him, who is still haven’t order yet despite having most of his family members already giving him theirs.
He wish that Sirius did not go to Azkaban, at least he won’t have a huge expectation burden on his shoulders, maybe he would have a great father-son relationship like most of the other kids have.
Jamie is curled into him once he got the reassurance he needed, he murmured softly, “Love you, Mama.”
“Okay,” his voice hoarse, for not speaking for a while. Nodding his head, as Harry plays with his hair, adoringly bends his head, giving Draco’s forehead a kiss.
‘Hi Malfoy’, said Goldstein as he smiled at him dauntlessly. Draco noticed that he was standing too close to him that their shoulders brushed together.
“ I don’t care.”, said Draco without giving him an explanation why because he knows why, he still cared about it sometimes. Potter was looking at him weirdly as their legs kept on walking into the heart of the forest.
He had finally lost his mind, he was not going in the forest, there was a reason why it called forbidden in the first place.
Cory was the first one to fall asleep on his chest when he peaked one eye open, he disentangled him and put him down beside him on the bed, with a thick baby blanket knitted by Mrs Weasley once they arrived into the world. It was soft and warm, they loved it very much just by how quick they got comfortable by it.
He knows it was wrong. He was the professor while Draco is his student for fuck sake. How can a thirty five years old man cannot look away at the sixteen years old Slytherin boy.
“Mother, perhaps I have something that I want but you have to agree to buy it for me because I’m your favourite, right?” he smiled with cheeky grins on his face.
“AHH”, she screamed her lungs out, she almost fell backwards but Draco’s hand quickly snatched her up, “What’s going on back there!”, seethed father as he walked towards them, Draco had no idea where to put the stupid fucking skull out of his hand.
Draco was packing his trunk, the trunk was full of 1st year mandatory books and some extra books that Severus gave to him about Potions, and he bought Spell books which are not in the list. He too packed a lot of clothes.
“Luna Lovegood but I can already hear people call me Loony, they spread it like Blibbering Humdinger but that's quite alright,” she reassured him that she was alright with the name-calling. Deep down in his heart, he doesn’t know why he felt bad for her. He doesn’t even know what Blibbering Humdinger is.
Longbottom did not just say that, Draco don’t know about Blaise and Theo but he never said that to Longbottom. He only giving him advice saying maybe he shouldn’t be in Gryffindor because he not brave enough, he did not use the word ‘coward’, he used ‘not brave enough’. On a second thought, he did say that but he didn’t mean it in that way.
He then turned his attention back to the hat and whispered venomously, ‘Listen, if you don’t put me in Slytherin when I put you back on my head, you won’t be sorting crap next year, so understand?’
But then, out of nowhere, his other baby who was still in his belly, moved aggressively when he couldn't feel his brother’s presence. Harry quickly handed their second son for clean up and checkup to make sure their baby was alright.
When Draco’s leg hit the bed, Potter pushed him down carefully with him followed by. With Potter lay on top of him, he lay down tiny kisses all over his face. Draco wrapped both arms around Potter’s neck.
“You know, Draco. I know it’s romantic and all but I really can’t find any constellations at all. All I saw is a dote which I know is the stars.”
“How would you even know about that,” if looks could kill, he would be dead now by Cassie’s furious and annoyed look.
Would her father hear about it? Absolutely not but her mother might if Harry found out about it and decide to go and blabber to her mother.
Nobody spoke a word once they arrived at their destination. Cassie walked towards the girl dormitories while Blaise and him walked to their room. They slide under their blanket in their respective bed and cover their whole body. There is one word flying through Draco’s mind. Wicked.
Goldstein gave him an enthusiastic waves, Draco just nodded his head, which it pleases Harry with their interaction.
Read carefully at what Firenze said. Is there going to be a new dark lord on the horizon? Read to find out.
The atmosphere in the room was tense but was broken by Granger. ‘The spell that you use was spectacular’, eyes shine with fascination.
“I am not going in the forest - what if I died in there, my sister would be devastated that she couldn’t scold me anymore and I didn’t even have my first kiss yet. Shouldn’t we be writing lines or something”, said Draco, trying to conceal the panic note in his voice but by the pleased look on Potter’s face, he probably heard it.
He pulls out his phone and checks his notifications for any message. Forty notifications come from iMessage, probably his trio group chat they created.
‘Potter! I swear if you don’t put your big dick in me, I’m going to find someone else!’, said Draco choking on his breathe. He felt the arm on his waist tightened, he feels Potter pulling out his fingers from his tight little hole.
The mirror shown Sirius was sitting on a stool, his fingers was dancing on the piano keys, behind him, Amelia and him was dancing to the music that was playing. Draco saw that his mirror-self was walking to his father and tapped his finger lightly on his shoulder.
“Are we going to stargaze?” guess Draco out of excitement. Draco once told him before that he was always fascinated with stars and moons, he even wrote in his bucket list that he wanted to lay on the grass and stargaze with someone special.
If Harry could compare any worst day he had at work, this would probably be the worst. Everything went wrong today because firstly it took him an hour to find a missing file that contained a lot of important stuff about missions and when he did found it, he forgot about a meeting that he had to attend to discuss with the other aurors since he was the Head Auror. The youngest head auror he might add.
Malfoy looked up then. His grey eyes met Harry's, narrowing slightly as he took in Harry's expression.
"It's not that," Harry interjected quickly, torn between his desire to protect Malfoy and his loyalty to his best friend. "He's been a help so far," he said in a placating tone.  "Let's not alienate him for the sake of it. We'll check it out and decide what to do when we've more facts."
"And yet, you are performing wandless magic. I think, when this matter is settled, there are things you and I should discuss."
"It's tough," the taller man admitted, holstering his wand. "What with Fred, and with us being partners since we started in the Aurors."
"You're crying," said Malfoy unnecessarily, his other hand coming up to cup the side of Harry's face.
"One more," he said in a bland voice, moving aside with a tight smile as Malfoy crossed to the metal door.
So that was why they were there. Draco was grateful to her. It was becoming a habit, he mused, not one he'd ever expected to acquire. He was about to enquire how many premises they intended to search when his thoughts were interrupted by a crackle of sparks, the sound of Weasley shouting and the crack of apparition. A bulldog patronus skimmed past his leg and hurtled out of sight.
Malfoy stopped abruptly, causing Harry to swerve to avoid running into him. He thrust the script in Harry's direction.
He closed his eyes for a moment; it had been so real he found it difficult to ground himself in the present, especially now he thought he could hear the sinuous swish of Voldemort's robes coming up the stairs.
Then Potter's finger was in him, curling and reaching until Draco jerked and groaned and ground himself into the pleasure.
"Er," said Harry, about to say he wasn't sure, but catching a glimpse of something behind Malfoy's scowl that looked suspiciously like desperation. "Yes, of course." He put on his most earnest expression and moved to stand next to Malfoy to reinforce his words.
"Of course." Malfoy sounded irritated. "Mother could see the way things were going. She wasn't a fool."
Then there were questions, lots of them, and Madam Pomfrey's attitude visibly softened right up to the point when she actually laid a hand on Malfoy's shoulder and gave it a little squeeze. He closed his eyes then, mouth drawn tight as he shook his head. She spoke for a while longer then ran a hand over his hair in a maternal manner before stepping away.
"It's okay," said Harry hurriedly. "It's to help you breathe." He caught hold of Malfoy's fingers and placed his hand back on the sheet, speaking reassuringly. "The doctor will be here soon. They'll fix you up."
"If there's any change, you bring him straight back." The nurse turned his attention to Malfoy. "Other than that, see your practice nurse in a couple of days to get that dressing changed. You can pick up your prescription at the desk on the way out."
Harry wasn't sure how long it took for the heart-wrenching grief to ease, but gradually Malfoy's body stilled until he was a limp and exhausted weight in Harry's arms.
"Right." Draco clenched his jaw, almost certain he was being tested in some way. "Did you find anything?"
It was quite some time before it occurred to him that Potter had been similarly affected. It wasn't long after this revelation that the man stuck his shaggy head around the door.
Harry stared at her, remembering a haggard Malfoy sitting on the edge of the chair at his hearing, jaw clenched and hands clasped tight in a vain attempt to stop them trembling. At the time he'd thought it was nerves, but maybe it had been more than that? Or maybe he was just trying to find excuses for Malfoy.
Once inside the taxi he pushed himself into the corner, leaning tight against the door, making sure to keep his hands in his pockets so Potter couldn't see how much they were shaking.
Harry answered with a swift wandless spell that both locked the door and set privacy wards. Seconds later they were prostrate on a transfigured white rug, kissing with a slow desperation as Harry undid Malfoy's jeans and pushed up his soft jumper until he could kiss and nip at his cool, smooth skin.
The body beneath him shifted slightly, as though Potter had caught a deep breath, making Draco suddenly aware of ribs and hipbones beneath his own torso. A hand came up and a finger ghosted over his swollen eye.
For some reason that admission made him feel hollow inside and his gaze was drawn back to the figure reclining on the path. What would it be like, being friends with Malfoy? He looked harmless enough, reclining there in an elegant sprawl in the sunlight, but in Harry's experience Malfoy had never been harmless. For all that...without thinking Harry flipped a quick cushioning charm under the other man and wove a sun-block spell into the air above him. Malfoy might be a git, but he didn't need sunburn on top of everything else.
"Join me?" he enquired, in what Draco's ears convinced him was a hopeful tone. "Maybe we could run or spar or something?"
He was back on his feet, one hand firm on Draco's hip as he guided his cock to Draco's entrance. There was a moment's sharp pain, the burn slow and bright and deep inside Draco, fluttering red behind his closed eyelids. He forced himself backwards, impatient, his cock jerking at the startled and needy noise Potter made, at the way his grip tightened and his other hand fastened onto Draco's shoulder.
"Ah, good. It's very reassuring to have a mate around when something like this happens. We'll know more when he's seen the doctor and been to x-ray. You sit tight now and someone will be along to fetch him soon."
"Perhaps. Although neither Miss Granger nor myself experienced such a connection, so it may simply be that you were the first magical person to touch Mr Malfoy. Of course, a previous history of trading curses and jinxes may have made the connection more sensitive."
It was no wonder Potter liked the place, thought Draco wryly, holding the slightly greasy menu with his fingertips: bacon sandwiches; cottage pie; treacle tart. None of it would have looked out of place on Hogwarts' tables. He settled for a mug of tea and some cheesy chips and sat picking at them, while Weasley scoffed down an enormous mixed grill and Potter ate his way steadily through cottage pie and a large slice of treacle tart.
Empty words would not help, so instead Harry caught hold of the hand next to him and gave it a quick squeeze, maintaining the contact when Malfoy did not pull away. After a moment the other man sighed and leaned in slightly, so that a little of his weight rested against Harry's shoulder.
"Ten minutes," said Harry encouragingly. "It says ten minutes to the nurse, then we might be able to find a seat."
His eyes stung. It was all his fault. He'd treated Malfoy just like everyone else did and now Malfoy would finish his work for the Ministry and then he'd leave and Harry would never find out what could have been between them; instead he would be alone once more.
"You were worried enough about him yourself yesterday, Harry. I hope you two haven't been fighting?"
He stretched out a hand, stopping just short of Malfoy's wrist; the physical sensation of the glowing current beneath the man's skin was exhilarating and left him breathless.
The words did not have the customary Malfoy sting. In fact, the pull at the corner of his mouth and the angle of his shoulders were sure indications that he was both in pain and finding it difficult to hold himself together. It occurred to Harry that he should be surprised he could tell so much just by looking at Malfoy, but then he remembered the years of close observation of possibly nefarious activities and put the uncomfortable thought away.
In truth, at first it was concern that kept his gaze locked onto the other man, but as the hours passed and the pained creases on Malfoy's face smoothed out it became more that Harry found his gaze drawn in that direction for no particular reason other than Malfoy was...interesting.
Draco wanted to shrivel up and die. How fucking humiliating. If only, just once, he'd been able to exercise sound judgement and not make his life even more unbearable.
Then Malfoy was moving down, his tongue caressing Harry's nipples, teeth nipping at his stomach and at the soft skin inside the dip of his hip-bones. Fingers fondled him as Malfoy's wet tongue and warm breath worked the inside of Harry's thighs until he was gasping his need and pushing his hips up against the cool silk of the other man's hair.
Fearful of what he would find, he opened his eyes warily to find Nagini towering over them. The shock made him flinch and Potter grasped his wrists reflexively, wincing and gasping as their skin came into contact. For a moment their eyes met and Malfoy registered that Potter seemed to be as terrified as himself. Then the other man's grip tightened, his expression morphing into a very Gryffindor mask of determination. Potter would face it, no matter what.
There was a small gap in the curtains. If Harry leaned to the right he could see that Malfoy was lying on his side, with his back to the corridor. His figure was long and lean beneath the hospital sheet and his shoulders were shaking.
"That, Weasley, is a correctly presented essay. I don't expect something written with a broomhandle dipped in cheap dye. Or did an impoverished spider from your trunk collapse in your ink and enjoy its death throes on your sub-standard parchment? A blessed relief from the daily grind of being a Weasley spider, I'm sure."
The other man's mouth was very close, the symmetrical curve of his lips attracting Harry's eye and quickening his pulse.
There was a harsh chuckle as Greyback let go of his ankle in favour of his hair, some of it torn out by the roots as Draco was forced face down upon the floor. Immediately the iron grip transferred to the back of his neck and he was held in place as Greyback tore open the back of his shirt and ran a rough tongue up his spine, snarling at the taste.
"We're going now," he stated flatly, seriously tempted to simply disapparate through the wards again.
With that, Malfoy fled, walking swiftly away on his long legs and forcing Harry to jog for a few paces to catch up.
Now, Draco moved cautiously along the street, not sure if he'd shaken off his pursuers. It was becoming more frequent, this deadly dance of pursuit and threat. Day by day it wore him down, stress chipping away at his fragile defences and combining with the exhaustion of nightmare-ridden nights to drag him ever deeper into despair. He had no real means to protect himself, not with his wand seized and a ministerial ban against his use of magic. So Draco slipped through the night, avoiding the circles of light beneath the street lamps, feeling alone and vulnerable, no longer sure why he was bothering to run from a fate that seemed inevitable.
To his relief, although he was sore and a little light-headed, he actually felt okay; it was hard to believe the nightmares of delirium were less than 48 hours behind him. Harry was right though; he owed his thanks to Granger and Madam Pomfrey. In fact he guessed he owed them somewhat more than just thanks. It was not a situation he was overly comfortable with, Malfoys preferred to have favours owed to them rather than vice versa, but there wasn't much he could do about it other than adhere to the social niceties and hope a situation would arise in the future to balance the scales.
Harry, safely esconsed in an archway behind a concealment charm, watched Malfoy approach. He would have preferred it if they'd been able to work together, but could see the merits in a solo approach to the more undesirable establishments. It was just that the other man seemed so on edge, although that was understandable, bearing in mind his recent ostracisation from the wizarding world. It didn't look as though his nerves had settled in the time they'd been apart.
Potter slammed and locked the door before gathering Draco into his arms. Draco stood there, tense and bewildered and chilled to the bone.
"Go easier." Draco snorted. "Right. A nice, easy ride right back to Azkaban. I'll give it a miss, thanks."
There was a quick nod in response; Malfoy's frame was beginning to shake so violently that Harry thought he would shatter a tooth.
Potter looked pained and rubbed at his forehead as though he had a headache coming on. Served him right, thought Draco bitterly; what did he expect, putting the two of them in the same room?
"So long as Weasley keeps his hands off me," responded Malfoy with some bitterness. "And you, don't assume everything I do is with a nefarious intention."
He tugged distractedly at his hair, almost tearing out a tuft as his voice went up a pitch. "Merlin, Hermione! What must he be thinking? I've got to find him and try and explain...apologise!"
After a moment's consideration and a quick look out the window at the overcast sky, he decided to stick with his earlier choice of jeans, white long sleeved t-shirt and jacket. Muggle clothing had been his everyday wear for so long that sometimes wizard robes and cloaks, even with self-adjusting seams, felt oddly cumbersome. Besides, there was a distinct possibility that if the Head Auror thought their conclusions were worth investigating they would be sent out in the field and Potter had indicated that trading was taking place in muggle locations. Draco was under no illusions about his probable role; he would be Death Eater bait to draw out the ex-Slytherins.
Draco woke, knowing instantly that Potter was gone. When his hand found only the cold depression where the other man's body had lain, it did not bring any sense of surprise, only resignation. He opened his eyes without enthusiasm to a view of rumpled pillows and beyond them a note scribbled on piece of paper, its ragged edge showing its origins had been one of those muggle notebooks that were bound together with spirals of wire.
Something of Harry's shock must have shown upon his face, for the nurse's frown eased, replaced by sympathy.
The door slamming behind Weasley jerked him from his introspection and he turned his head to find Potter was staring at him, his eyes dark emerald in the light from the desk lamp.
Harry followed him through the ornate gates, trying to ignore the way Malfoy's jeans hugged his thighs as he leaned in a casual manner against the back wall of the lift. Getting Robards' approval was of the utmost importance; there was no time for fantasies about the feel of Malfoy's body writhing beneath his own.
Potter had said something, he realised, was watching him with those intense green eyes, his knee nudging Draco's beneath the table and sending a shiver up his thigh.
"Fuck," said Potter, horrified, his hands taking hold of either side of Draco's face and his thumbs tracking the tears.
He waited apprehensively a minute or two longer, until the muffled sounds coming from the shadows drew nauseating pictures in his mind. Then, with a final sound of protest, he withdrew.
"Look, I don't know what your injuries are, and erm, you don't have to tell me. It's just, if you did, I'd know what to do to make you more comfortable. While you're here."
Malfoy met each thrust with vigour, pre-come white on his belly, his fingers digging into Harry's flesh and his legs pulling him ever deeper. His eyes widened, storm grey and beautiful, pupils blown as Harry rode forcefully over his prostrate.
Harry snorted, half laughing, half crying, twisting his fists into the soft blue jumper and inhaling the smell that was pure Malfoy. He pushed into the lean frame, holding him tight and letting his hold on his own magic ease to allow it to flow with the other man's.
He observed it for a while, rolling the smooth wood between the pads of his fingers, a little frown on his face as he gave it an experimental flick.
Malfoy took the mug carefully in both hands, although even this precaution couldn't disguise the way his fingers trembled. He sipped and closed his eyes briefly in appreciation before turning his gaze on Harry.
"But Harry," protested Hermione. "What on earth happened? You can't have apparated out of the Ministry."
The longer he looked at the man the more he could tell that the injuries were not superficial. The light breeze stirring Malfoy's blond hair revealed that there were clumps that appeared to be matted together with blood and his stance was all wrong, devoid of its normal grace and confidence, seeming instead taut and unsteady.
"They're cross with you, Potter." The tiniest hint of a smile tugged at Malfoy's lips as he turned to summon the lift.
In the end he persuaded himself that it was only right someone stayed with Malfoy in case there were after effects from the unknown spell. He pulled on a clean pair of worn joggers and settled gingerly onto the bed, careful not to brush against the other man and wake him. He lay there for a long time, watching Malfoy sleep, getting used to the warm ache in his chest that just looking at him caused.
It was a typical old-style London cafe that Potter took them to, the coffee available with or without milk and no fancy frappes or skinny lattes in sight. Misted windows, scarred formica on the table tops and the type of chairs with tubular chrome legs.
"On every occasion when someone was killed or injured, samples were taken of the potion where some remained. They all contained the same thing, Oil of Quintessence."
Malfoy slept for 27 hours straight, every hour restoring his appearance until it was just Malfoy, sleeping quietly, in a nest of white bedding.
Sharp teeth tugged at his earlobe, words whispered into his ear. "If you're going to keep on doing that, Potter, you'd better lock the door."
"Merlin!" He gripped at the bridge of his nose with thumb and forefinger, eyes closed, breathing in shallow puffs.
Malfoy stared at him, his expression betraying his internal struggle. Eventually he seemed to reach a decision.
"Um, right," said Potter, looking incredibly flustered for someone who had vanquished the world's greatest evil force while he was still a teenager himself. "Destination then."
Draco nodded and her hand took his elbow. The strength of her magic surprised him, although he didn't know why. Much to his aggravation she'd regularly exceeded his marks at school and she was a member of the Golden Trio after all. He supposed he'd thought her main strengths were academic rather than physical, notwithstanding her right hook. He hoped his sense of genuine surprise wasn't a left-over from his upbringing and the repetitive message that muggle-borns were magically inferior.
"Someone decided to teach me a lesson, Death Eater and all that...I'm sure you are familiar with the situation."
With some difficulty, Harry reversed into the nearest habitable bedroom, soundly cursing whoever had laid down the 'no magic' decree. He'd taken enough risk with the protego charm, but by casting it in such a way that it protected the staircase rather than Malfoy, it had effectively stopped Malfoy but couldn't be seen as being beneficial to him.
Without warning, his way was blocked by a flare of light he dimly recognised as that produced by a protego charm. He bounced off it and fell sideways into someone who let out a winded gasp.
The man's shoulders moved uneasily, almost as though he felt the weight of Harry's stare. He took a final drag on his cigarette before dropping it to the floor and crushing it beneath the sole of his boot. Long fingers ran through wind tousled hair and the man stood, the gracefulness of the movement blurring as he hunched his shoulders and shoved his hands into his trouser pockets. He walked slowly past the bench, the gaze from his silver-grey eyes drifting over Harry's false facade of portly middle-age and moving on, uninterested.
Harry took it reluctantly. The wood was still warm with a heat greater than that of Malfoy's hand. He flicked his wrist.
"Okay," said Harry. "I, er, don't know many details though. We lost touch years ago, we just met up again recently."
It was strange that even after so many years, part of him was still enraged at the way Malfoy and his friends had treated Ron and Hermione, at the hurt he'd caused by running to his father and Rita Skeeter telling lies about Hagrid and Buckbeak, about Sirius and Lupin and so many other things.
Dawn found them both on a bare mattress on the floor. Harry couldn't even remember why it was there, only that it had seemed like a good idea at the time. Now he sprawled with his back against the wall so he could take advantage of the cool air from the open window above his pounding head. He'd been sitting there long enough to be uncomfortable, but he was too tired to move and didn't want to disturb Malfoy, who lay beside him, stretched untidily across the blue and white stripes of the mattress with the crown of his head, touching Harry's thigh. It had been a while since he'd raised more than a feeble mutter and Harry found himself running his fingers through the sweat-dampened strands of blond hair in a gesture of comfort, though whether for himself or Malfoy was not clear to him.
Completely taken unawares by Harry's abrupt halt, Ron bumped into him from behind, causing him to stumble into the office and the corner of Malfoy's lip to curve into the suggestion of a smirk.
"Yes mum." Harry put out a hand and tucked a curl behind her ear. "I'll do my Gryffindor best, okay?"
Harry padded swiftly to the door and into the hallway. He paused for a moment by Malfoy's door, not wishing to intrude, but driven on by almost palpable waves of anguish. The door opened silently, the light from the hallway illuminating the rumpled and empty bed.
"Mr Malfoy is a free man," stated Potter, so loudly that Draco suspected a wandless sonorous charm. "I'm delighted he's agreed to contribute his expertise to assist the aurors."
Harry began to flex, a deep, slow grind that he was powerless to stop, every fibre of his being wanting the other man, his cock deep inside Malfoy and their eyes locked.
Harry stood there for a long time when Malfoy left the kitchen, his hand missing the cool strength of the other man's fingers and his mind wondering what the hell was going on.
Draco reclined against the nearest wall and raised an eyebrow, boredom suffusing his tone. "Should I?"
It was the last thing Harry had been expecting. Was it an example of Malfoy's undoubted intelligence, that he could continue to process information under duress, or simply something that he'd concluded earlier but chosen to keep to himself until now?
"Please don't. They'd find a way to blame me, filthy Death Eater and all that." Malfoy shifted uneasily, his breath catching and his teeth sinking into his lip for a moment. "Why is it you're still here anyway?"
Truth was, he was overwhelmingly attracted to Potter. It was time to admit that to himself. What's more, he'd been attracted to Potter for a long time, although he couldn't pin down the exact moment when rejected friendship and the subsequent blur of competitive animosity, hatred and suspicion bordering on obsession had gradually given way to a long-denied realisation that there was something incredibly hot about Potter and his ever-present power.
"No. Remember Potions, Potter? That careful balance when preparing medicinal potions, the ingredients combined to enhance the magical core rather than destabilise it? The muggle drugs weren't suitable."
It was complete bedlam in the ER waiting area; Harry edged past a woman puking into a pressed cardboard dish and headed for the Triage queue, taking a numbered ticket from the wall dispenser and towing Malfoy along with him by keeping a firm grip on his upper arm. Malfoy, off-balance, bumped into him when he stopped and hissed.
Draco lifted his chin against the whispered tide of resentment and made sure his best sneer was firmly in place as he followed Potter's confident stride between the desks of the scroll-keepers. Despite the icy exterior he presented, the palpable waves of hatred made him feel nauseated and his heart pounded painfully as he stalked disdainfully along. It was a good thing they'd taken advantage of an early start and apparated to his flat to transport his clothes and personal possessions to Grimmauld Place. At least his expensively tailored suit and highly polished shoes were an armour of professionalism and good breeding, which was more than could be said for Potter's outfit of tatty converse and auror's robe, thrown untidily over jeans and hoodie. Not that the other man needed armour, being the beloved hero of the wizarding world. Besides, thought Draco wryly, Potter's scruffy appearance was undeniably appealing and did nothing to detract from the aura of sheer power that surrounded the man.
"Where is he anyway...oh." Hermione came to a halt by the kitchen door. "He's outside," she said, her voice suddenly softer.
"Yeah, I s'pose so." Harry stroked his hair and smirked at him. "I am a Gryffindor," he said simply.
"Unheard of," it muttered testily. "Call himself a descendant of the Black family! Where's his sense of pride!"
"I take it Harry has explained? Good. Well I met with the Minister this morning and I'm cautiously optimistic. We should get a final decision by tomorrow."
Granger sounded unsure, maybe even concerned, looking quickly over at him as she checked the wizards and witch were all securely bound and immobilised.
From the minute Potter stepped out of the Floo, Draco knew something was wrong. He felt the smile stiffen on his face as his stomach gave an uneasy lurch. Potter looked desperately unhappy.
"But..." Harry swallowed, the awfulness of the situation making him feel sick. "Immobolus," he whispered. "I cast immobolus at him, Hermione!"
Grey eyes met his, the misery in them acute. It was odd, thought Harry; it was probably the longest the two of them had ever spent in close proximity without fighting.
"It's not the first time you've seen me in them," Draco noted, a bit puzzled by the reaction and hoping he hadn't made some horrible faux-pas in his choices. "It makes sense if we get sent out today?"
One scourgify later, Harry stuck his head in the floo and practically begged Hermione to press the Minister for a decision as early as possible.
As soon as they arrived back at Grimmauld Place, Malfoy took himself off, expressing a desire for a long, hot shower.
Malfoy swayed into him, their mouths meeting fiercely as his long fingers curled into Harry's hair.  A firm butt cheek in each hand, Harry pushed his tongue deep, Malfoy opening to him, their hips pushing forwards in a slow grind that was exquisite and frustrating in equal measures until Harry broke away.
Draco followed him, taking his time on the stairs and wishing rather pointlessly that he and Potter had been friends, or at least not enemies, so that Potter might actually want him to stay for longer rather than it being a case of a brief, charitable hand-out for a screwed up, stray Death Eater that no one wanted around.
When Harry pushed his way back through the door, a steaming mug of tea in each hand and a packet of chocolate digestive biscuits floating behind him, he saw an unmistakable look of relief pass over Malfoy's face before his features settled back into their current drawn expression.
"Sorry to disappoint, Potter, but I'm clean." A note of bitterness crept into Draco's voice. "Were you waiting for me, in the park? It wasn't just a coincidence?"
He chewed his lip, considering, weighing up the risks of getting involved in a deal that could be withdrawn at any moment if there was a swing of political power within the Ministry, against the possibility of being allowed to use magic again. There was no choice really, not for a wizard. He sighed.
"He's my best friend, I'll give him all the time he needs. But this whole thing just makes sense; we've been trying to get these smugglers for ages and it's tying up too many valuable resources."
In turn this reminded him that adult Malfoy was almost unbearably attractive and what with one thing and another Harry found his stomach clenched tighter than even the motion of the lift dictated. By the time they alighted, he was wound tighter than a spring and there was an uncomfortable pressure in his trousers.
Breathless, wanting, Malfoy's chin dropped, grey eyes dark and intent as Harry opened his mouth, looking up from under his lashes as he let the warm weight settle on his tongue. He closed his lips, suckled slowly on the salt-sweet fluid. Malfoy groaned and Harry spurted a little at the sound, his hips moving involuntarily as he sought friction against his own zipper.
It was the only warning he had as the blond head suddenly dipped forwards, catching him sharply on the cheekbone. Long legs buckled, tangling with his own and despite his grip on Malfoy's waist they went down in a heap, Malfoy a surprisingly heavy, limp weight in his arms.
For a moment Harry was frozen, with the shock of the unexpected encounter stealing strength from his limbs. Then his thoughts were tumbling; how, why was the boy...man... here? Was it a coincidence? Was Malfoy involved with the potion smugglers? It seemed unlikely he would need to stoop to such activities, but who knew what an ex-Death Eater did for a living.
Harry stopped abruptly. Fascinating? Malfoy fascinating? Merlin, surely he didn't think Malfoy was attractive? Did he?
Granger's "Finite Incantatum" released Draco seconds later; he stumbled, an icy feeling wriggling over his spine.
Draco smiled, probably the first full, genuine smile since before 5th year. "No chance of that from me, Potter."
It wasn't too long coming; the other wizard flexed his fingers, took up a textbook-perfect stance and threw out a barrage of spells. As far as Harry could see, none of them had any effect. By the end, the wand was smoking and Malfoy's face was flushed with exertion. He turned to Harry, his eyes wild and desperate.
Harry heard Malfoy's shocked gasp even as his own mouth dropped open. The energy between them soared, rushing like icy flames over their skin and Ogden's Finest in their veins. For a moment they were frozen in position, Harry finding himself captivated by the pewter shine of Malfoy's eyes in the sunlight, eyes that were staring fixedly at Harry's bottom lip where it was caught between his teeth.
Harry raised a hand at the argumentative look on Ron's face. "Just for a few days. See what else we turn up before we start throwing accusations around."
He startled violently when Potter's fingers tangled briefly with his own, the flow of his magic vibrant and warm and reassuring. It was enough to give Draco the strength to firm his jaw, straighten his shoulders. He wouldn't let Potter down. If nothing else, at least he could get that right.
And then he couldn't speak at all and Potter didn't try to make him, just holding him tight and stroking his hair while Draco curled into him and grieved in silent, wrenching sobs for everything he'd lost.
Harry swallowed. "I know. It's just sometimes I find it hard to remember that. We hated each other for such a long time."
Harry was awakened by a feeling of intense distress. He sat up, gasping, his mind struggling to find the remnants of a nightmare that didn't seem to have occurred. Confused and disorientated, he'd already swung his feet down to the floor before he realised that the emotion was not his own.
The shock helped Harry regain his balance; he fought down a wave of adrenaline and fear and steered Malfoy to the bed where a quick interrogation of the house shields confirmed there were no signs of a breach. It seemed Malfoy was hallucinating, not too surprising given his temperature.
"You helped me when no one else would. But it's more than that. Much more. Now it's up to you if you want to believe I've changed, if you want to trust me or not. I am what I am and this is it, Potter; this is it."
They lay there a while, Potter's hand stroking his hair and Draco's fingers twisted into Potter's t-shirt as something inside him gradually unclenched. He found there were tears in his eyes and closed his eyelids, hoping Potter wouldn't notice, but the treacherous drops slipped down the sides of his face and ran cold into his ears and hair.
In the end, Harry went first to Gawain Robards. He gave the Head Auror a condensed version of events, elaborating on his suspicions of Malfoy's possible involvement in smuggling and the need to keep him under observation, both for purposes of the investigation and for Malfoy's own protection.
They waited at the apparition point for Weasley for quite some time. Potter still seemed on edge, his eyes continuously glancing in Draco's direction then turning quickly away. After a while it began to grate on Draco's nerves.
"Can you be ready to leave in 30 minutes or so? We'll check out some of those locations you gave me earlier."
The little vase rose gently into the air and hovered there until Harry released it and allowed it to sink back to the table.
It's Weasley, thought Draco desperately. Just Weasley, who wanted to kill him, but that was better than... The room tilted, Potter's face blurring as it creased in consternation, his mouth moving but the words lost in the roaring in Draco's ears and the rising tide of pain from his ribs.
"No time like the present." Draco rose to his feet, brushing off the feeling of light-headedness that made the room tilt for a moment.
He looked again at Malfoy, wondering at the reason for the jumper and jacket in the heat of the office, but his thoughts were interrupted when Auror Daniel popped his head around the door.
Potter's hands moved lower, cupped Draco's arse cheeks and pulled him in so his cock ground against the hot swelling in Potter's joggers. There was a moment of pure, unadulterated fear and then the familiar scent of Potter's skin filled his nostrils and Draco writhed instinctively, moaning at the delicious friction in his groin as the other man's mouth moved harder against his own. He reached up and slid his fingers into soft black hair, tugging gently as his tongue delved deeper inside a throat that opened for him.
"Thank you," whispered Draco, allowing Potter to draw him to his feet and steer him out of the room.
Harry's magical core flared bright, the sentiment echoed approvingly by Grimmauld Place. Malfoy must've felt it too, because he moaned and tangled his tongue with Harry's, his hips pushing forwards so they were both left in no doubt that the other man was invested in the kiss. For a few seconds it was perfect, long enough for Harry to know he wanted to keep kissing Malfoy for ever. Then other emotions began to filter through the lust swamping their sensory connection, chillingly from Malfoy, the over-riding emotion was fear.
In an odd sort of way it was nice, that close physical contact with another human being, even if it was Draco Malfoy. It made Harry realise that since he'd split with Ginny there hadn't been much in the way of physical contact, other than the odd hug from Hermione or Luna or back slap from Ron and, well, one or two brief encounters of another nature. He'd felt too emotionally bruised to even consider expanding his existing circle of friends let alone anything else. So yes, it was odd but nice, this contact that would not have occurred under any other circumstance.
Weary resignation twisted Malfoy's expression and he sighed, his long fingers trembling across his cut lip in an unconscious gesture.
Briggs and Ranworth turned up a few minutes later and they spent half an hour or so debriefing the raid on the warehouse. They were finishing off when a memo from the Research Department bounced off Harry's forehead. He swiped it from mid-air and smoothed it out.
They stared at each other for a moment, Draco bewildered beneath the weight of Potter's hand and Snape's gaze.
She said the latter in a dry tone without making eye contact with either of them and Malfoy snorted softly, a rueful twist to his lips.
Harry opened his mouth, closed it again, felt the scald of a tear spilling down his cheek, then another. He was so afraid. He had Ron and Hermione, Luna and Neville and other friends. The Weasley's had even remained his surrogate family despite his split with Ginny, but this thing with Malfoy was different, more intense, more personal, just him and Malfoy. To let it go further would mean admitting to himself that he had feelings for Malfoy. He would have to let the man in so close that any subsequent split or betrayal would be horribly painful, the sort of pain he wasn't sure he could go through again.
"Madam Pomfrey will be here any minute," he noted, in a rather winded tone, almost suffocated by an unexpected wave of remorse.
"You go ahead. We'll work our way through the Diagon establishments, see if any of our reliable contacts know anything."
