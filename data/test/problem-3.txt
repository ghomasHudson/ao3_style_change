“Of course we don’t mind,” Remus adds quickly, stirring tea and passing it to Harry. “It’s our pleasure, this is your home.”
It feels insane, how he gasps and his movements going erratic and Draco allows himself to go with the flow of pleasure that starts in the small of his back and washes down his navel and flows through him like an electric shock or a hurricane.
They get that Harry was in a difficult situation; he was scared, and he found support in this weird friendship with Draco. Because Draco gets it. He is also gay, and knows HIV-positive people. Draco has his own struggles with his depression, his homophobic family; he hasn’t even come out to his parents yet. He also loves reading and writing and they bonded over all this.
,” he mutters. He doesn’t really register where he is, or what the fuck is going on, but then she’s shaking his shoulder lightly, muttering for him to wake up while shoving a denim skirt up her long long long legs and Harry is dizzy with hangover and dehydratation and her long milky legs and, bloody hell, he is hard and he’s not sure if it’s morning wood or if it’s Draco.
He seems at ease and distracted, and Draco can’t quite control himself as he walks straight up to this man, this stranger, that somehow now Draco knows too much about.
And Draco shivers with the intensity of his velvety voice and bright grey eyes, with the weight of Sirius’s words.
I had great fun writing this chapter xD I hope you enjoyed it! Let me know your thoughts, that's very appreciated! love, tai <3
“Who is enough?” she gestures perplexed. “No one is completely satisfied with their lives, everyone is holding on to vices and activities that will make them stop feeling unsatisfied. Some fuck, others work, or use drugs, make money, exercise, or pop kids out for god’s sake.” She takes a long drag on her cigarette. “But he loves you. He always has.”
Tw: slut shaming and internalised homophobia. I didn’t want to sugar coat it, as anger, guilt and shame are common parts of the grieving process.
He feels his godfather's eyes on him, and the words tumble out of his mouth. “I don't know what I would do—”
“It is bloody unfair!” he says, his shaky hands gesticulating grandly. “I was no saint, that’s for sure, I had my good share of messy sex with many strangers, but why me? What have I done so wrong? Why not my best friend who was even more of a whore than I was?” he gasps, broken. “I didn’t mean it like that, I am sorry,” he adds quickly, feeling ashamed.
They say their farewells to everyone and Remus puts on some rather bizarre woollen gloves; they look like small hedgehogs and are ugly as fuck. Draco stares and Remus laughs loudly.
Truth is, Harry is already feeling the flash of insecurity again, the doubts, the uncomfortable sense that he is not enough.
But then, suddenly, he looks very serious, and makes Draco notice some traits that are very familiar because they are just so very
“I don’t think he is bored of you, you know,” she pops a chip to her mouth, and sips on her IPA Lagunita. “Maybe he is just curious. It's normal to want to spice things up, isn’t it?”
And with Harry in his mind and the bittersweet feeling of warmth and guilt jammed under his ribcage, Draco falls asleep.
And Harry lets himself be calmed down. Lets the emotions wash through him and out of him like he used to do when he was a kid.
“They were a gift,” he says, shrugging. “Come along, pup, you are in for a treat as you’re going to meet the most beautiful man alive,” Remus says proudly and Draco laughs.
He feels dazed now. As if he could sleep, as if his body was not his, like an out-of-body experience.
Sirius pulls away from the entryway and walks over to the wooden table in the centre of the kitchen, where Harry was sitting, nursing his tea. He ends up turning towards the counter by the sink to make tea. Harry smiles when he sees his godfather's bare feet, thinking that regardless of the season, Sirius is always barefoot inside the house.
Harry feels warm and lightheaded and filled with such a gorgeous emotion he doesn’t have words for it, only feelings. And it feels, feels, feels like a dream. As if Draco is the only space body shining in the dark dark dark sky. And maybe she has always been. Maybe that night on the bridge, she was the light he needed to stay alive.
The outside lights start blinking and Harry knows it’s his magic going wild. He takes a long breath and steps out of the stairs to the open rooftop.
But the feelings are confusing. He has been lying to Harry. Well, not lying, just not telling him the whole truth. And it’s bittersweet because he wishes it was possible, and real, and that he could touch his pouty bottom lip with the tip of his tongue.
“Why are you acting like that?” Harry presses, losing his patience. “You’ve been a right tit all week long.”
This is all sexy and painful in equal measures. He knows it is. He deeply wishes Draco wouldn’t need the extra effort to find sex with Harry more appealing, less boring.
“No.” Harry smiles at him, warm and real and gentle. “You changed so much that now I can’t take my eyes off you,” he admits.
He seems concerned. And Draco smiles at him, feeling amazed by this human being in front of him; this man with such a big heart that he goes around hugging lost gay strays on the street.
What was his name again? Something Irish, something like Oisin, or Eoin, or Eammon. He doesn’t care. The guy was nice enough, easy going, long brownish hair in a bun, big blue eyes, a bit of a belly with really strong arms and legs and a damn fine arse.
Narcissa’s chin trembles, it’s a tiny, measured, controlled motion. She holds in the tears, but presses the cloth napkin against her lips for a moment, giving herself time to gather her composure.
, in which more fics will be uploaded as soon as I catch my breath and go back to writing in 2021. In case you would like to be updated about new fics coming, do subscribe to the series and I’ll be very happy to share these extra stories with you. Obviously,
Theo finally shows up, a bit late for brunch but they go for a walk in the park anyway, the three of them this time. Theo looks casual and comfortable while Blaise talks about gay relationships with gusto, which is a bit of a novelty because Theo always blushes a bit. Draco wonders if seeing him happy is making Theo more at ease in general.
He is jerking off in earnest now. The soft waistband presses under his balls, making the sensation even more intense. He pumps hard and slow at the same time, teasing his balls as Draco said he would do.
Sirius doesn't like revisiting his past. It's like poking on a tender wound that never healed quite properly. He shuffles uncomfortably at his seat as Narcissa sits primly on the posh armchair of the tea house.
There’s something very familiar in his face. His bright grey eyes look at him with such warmth. Draco can’t quite understand how he started to bond with strangers with such a deep affection like the one blossoming inside his chest right now.
“I did,” he mended, and his heart was beating so fast, his hands were going clammy and his fingers were a bit shaky around the coffee mug. “It’s just that, I thought it was fun, but then you kept going and I was already knackered and I just wanted to go to bed and sleep-”
It hurts, hurts, hurts like a massive open wound and he shouldn’t feel like this because she’s never been his to begin with. And she deserves happiness. Her and her beautiful smile and her long blonde hair and her too skinny legs and her pink pink pink lips.
Harry sighs. What can he do? Well, he could hold it against Draco and stop talking to him. But Harry doesn’t like to lie to himself and he doesn’t want to stop talking to Draco. Draco is the highlight of his days.
“Mmm...” Draco starts kissing his neck, tongue lapping and mouth sucking and Harry trembles with a spark, feeling his cock fill and his knees go weak.
“But it's okay now,” Sirius reassures him with a gentle squeeze of their hands. “I don't want you to put yourself at risk, I love you too much to let someone play with your feelings.”
Draco sees the moment something in Remus' expression changes. He suddenly looks surprised, but Draco doesn’t know how to read him.
“Fine,” Sirius concedes, voice tight. “I’ll help, but not for you. For him. No one deserves to go through what I've been. And this kid will need family, and he will need people who he can relate to—gay people, queer people, HIV-positive people.”
Actually, he feels nothing. He feels void and empty and confused. He felt abandoned and angry and upset last night, but now he feels distant.
“You will do no such thing!” Sirius says, standing up in grand style. “Brian Kinney and his skinny arse stay in this house!” And he brandishes the tiny spoon in his hand like a threatening sword.
Amiability has never been something Sirius used to describe traits of the Black family—not even when he thought of Andromeda.
It can be a smile, a cup of coffee. It can be change, so big and consistent, that surprises you beyond belief. It can be lime green robes or soft cardigans. It can be an old t-shirt falling over a bony shoulder.
“A few days later, he came back. And then, I wasn’t angry anymore. I was devastated and starting to accept that that was it, that I would probably die.” He laughs, licking his lips and rubbing the palms of his hands together. “But then, the little shit took my face in his hands, crying, and told me he loved me, that he didn’t want me to die because he selfishly wanted time to love me properly.”
“Okay,” Remus says, retreating his socked feet, looking at Harry’s foot bleeding on the bed, considering it and assessing the scene. “I’ll put some shoes on and ask Sirius to hurry, he’s in the shower.” He nods at Harry, trying to calm him down. “Lie down, Harry, let’s avoid you fainting and falling on your head, shall we?”
The sunlight flows through the open curtains and splashes in, warming over the coverlet. Harry blinks sleepily, his body feeling alive and content.
“Is everything okay, pup?” he asks with a concerned and caring air, his grey eyes hidden by the darkness of the corridor, the light from the counter never quite illuminating his face.
“I need a shower first...” he tries, staring at the sink, feeling Draco’s fingers get into his shirt, touch the taut flesh of his navel, and start going down over his joggers to cup his dick over the fabric.
“More or less. It’s a bit quiet without my father being around,” Draco found himself admitting with a shrug. “Got my first Howler from after the trial a few days ago, that was exciting.”
He could hear the auror take a step back, away from him, and he was half-expecting them to try to rationalize his stupid, stupid infatuation, maybe even attempt to talk him out of it. “I’ll tell Mister Potter you’ll be a few more minutes,” they said instead, and then their footsteps faded away as the bathroom door closed, leaving Draco alone again.
“Hermione made me a modified charm for it, like a long-term glamour almost, she’s quite good at that sort of thing.” He looked up just in time to see them tilt their head back for a large, last swallow of beer, and their hair fell just right to where it looked halfway decent in the pub’s dim lighting. “She’ll make a brilliant Minister when she actually has time to run.”
“You shouldn’t touch things that you have no business interfering with, Mister Ferlet sir.” Merlin, Potter was using the same sass from Hogwarts on a senior auror now. “It’ll wear off in an hour. Now if you’ll excuse us.” He could see Potter stand up and toss a few muggle bills down, mimicking them but keeping his head bowed towards the table, and he stepped out only when he felt their hand on his upper back guiding him out from his side of the benches. He kept his face turned downwards as they left the pub but the room was missing that warm feeling from before, the only sound being their footsteps on the worn boards, and he could feel eyes following them both as they left, even after they stepped outside.
They sat in silence for a while as they ate, the restaurant soon humming with soft conversations from the other guests, and then Potter tried to get him talking again; all these small-talk topics, the news from
They were looking at him strangely, some horror and pity starting to seep into their features, and Draco didn’t want to see it anymore so he took another long sip of his drink. “Did you recognize any of them? Any identifying marks, like a tattoo or family crest or anything? They can’t just do that, you were cleared by the Ministry!”
“There hasn’t been a delivery to the manor in over six months,” Draco replied over his shoulder, moving again and pulling down a silver-edged teacup and saucer. It was the only surviving remnant of a dish set that had been given to his parents on their wedding day; it was also the only thing in the house from his childhood that had lived through the war, and just feeling the worn metal beneath his thumb settled some of his nerves about the trial. “Last I checked, the Ministry has confiscated and been opening all of my family’s mail.” The kettle was already on the stove from the night before and he refilled it with a flick of his wand and a mumbled “
The morning that Draco was scheduled to get dinner with Pansy, another unfamiliar owl showed up at his window, tapping insistently just as the sun was beginning to come up. He flicked the pane up with a wandless spell, groggily taking the envelope from their beak and reading it over almost four times before his eyes could focus properly and decipher the hurried scribbles on the page.
His eyes were snapped to the other side of the room as Shacklebolt stood, already seated high above the rest of the
Even before he had handed over his reply his mind had been racing through his closet, trying to figure out what to wear for the meeting the next day. He had finally settled on a green turtleneck jumper and black blazer, maybe with some dark trousers, when he realized he was acting like some lovestruck teenage girl; he was an adult, old enough to not be fawning over the Chosen One like every other schoolgirl in the wizarding world. He was being ridiculous.
“One must be from Miss Parkinson. She sent me an owl asking about you after you stopped responding, probably because of that Ministry monitoring Aedan was talking about, but I have no idea about the other two.”
“It’s fine. We weren’t too set on each other anyways.” That was true; she was a nice girl, clever and someone he got along with well enough, but his heart hadn’t been in it, not really. Her parents had at least had the decency to stop by in person instead of owling. “Are you still with the Weasley girl? You two were the poster children for rebuilding after the war but I haven’t seen anything on the front page of
that can ruin this for you, if you don’t agree to questioning there is a very good chance they are going to send you to Azkaban.”
, I even stole his wand for a bit. And - and I recently got his father thrown into Azkaban for the rest of his life, so there’s that, and I kind of reckon we’re a bit even now.”
“Well that was fucking awful.” Potter was the one to break the tense silence after they were a few blocks away, stopping to lean against a lamppost, and Draco took that as a cue to finally pull the hood down. “Sorry for all that, he’s one of the ones that was very... he was really against you being released with no charges.”
“Ugh, absolutely not! Mum would kill me if she knew I let you pay for your food!” She pushed the money back towards his chest, crossing her arms, and briefly Draco wondered if this was how normal cousins interacted; the familiarity between the two was obvious. “Keep it, Harry!”
“Is it - do you envy me, Malfoy? Is that it? You wanted to be the one Voldemort tried to kill all the time, with dead parents and a stupid scar?” There’s a laugh of disbelief in their words. “That’s why you didn’t testify, because you were afraid to let everyone know you were jealous of Harry Potter? Merlin, you - you risked Azkaban for your stupid pride and family name? You’re a fucking moron, I just - you’re ridiculous, do you actually-”
“Sorry, I -” The sound of their voice pulled him out of the nightmare with a sharp inhale and he could hear them shift to stand. “I should let you get going, we’ve been out here for longer than I thought.”
Draco swallowed hard, trying to come up with the right words to say and finally just nodding. “My, uhm-” He cleared his throat and hated himself for the way his voice shook. “It would have been disastrous for - for the both of us, our reputations and the trials and everything. My mother would have disowned me on the spot,
“Hm.” He looked between the three, settling on the one closest to him, a soft-looking barn owl perched on the back of a chair, and gently pulled the letter from its beak. Again, a plain seal, this time with a black wax instead of the red, and the parchment itself smelled familiar as he pulled it from the envelope. It looked like a full, fleshed-out message, nearly four inches worth of writing, but it was the name at the bottom that made him freeze:
That image of Potter, sprawled onto the forest floor and not breathing, of them carried to the castle and limply falling from the half-giant’s arms to the ground, of them never waking up and the Dark Lord winning the war and those empty green orbs staring into his soul screaming that it’s all his fault - it flashed in front of his eyes for what felt like an eternity and a second at the same time.
That was the first time in his life, the first time he had ever said his dirty little secret out loud to anyone, including himself, and it was to the very object of his affection. His face felt hot as he just sat there, hands twisting in his lap so tightly that his fingers started to go numb. Merlin he was so fucking stupid, why did he say that, why did he sit down when they told him to-
“Merlin you’re so fucking stupid, falling for his bullshit.” From the edge of his vision he saw her toss the still-glowing butt on the ground, grinding it out with the ball of her stiletto before starting towards the street again. “With my luck he’ll be the one personally throwing you into Azkaban, better start growing your hair out so you and Lucius can be twins.”
The thought of not being able to reply, of Potter thinking he’s ignoring them, made him bolt towards his father’s old study, the door closest to his left. He hadn’t been inside since before he last went to Hogwarts, a gentle speckling of dust settling over the room in Lucius’s absence. Draco barely looked around as he strode to the large wooden desk, bending to pull a quill and inkwell from one of the drawers and scribbling a quick reply on the back of the letter.
He knew what the auror saw: a sniveling, trembling, cowardly excuse of a Death Eater, knees dusted with grime from the bathroom tile, having to lean on the walls to stay on his feet. A disgusting waste of air and space, really; he wouldn’t blame them for saying so out loud. Draco watched as their eyes looked him up and down, finally settling onto his face. “Are you alright?” they asked quietly, and they had their hands out like they were preparing to catch him if he fell.
“No, he wouldn’t.” The words slipped out before he could stop them, and Pansy’s resulting glare could have levelled all of Hogwarts. “Look, it’s not- he’s not like that,” he snapped defensively. “He actually gave me a flat-out rejection, just so you know. Said that we can work on being civil and friendly.”
“Draco this is more than a bug, is it poison? Do you think there was something in your cup? Would Harry Potter try to -”
He closed his eyes again. The guilt for everything, for existing in such an awful way for so long, rushed him all at once. “I-” His voice cracked and beneath the table his too-short nails pushed crescents into his palms. “I’m sorry,” he managed to whisper, and he was, he had never felt more sorry in his entire life than in this muggle coffee shop chair with the Boy Who Lived sitting across from him as if they were friends.
. Look at me, idiot.” They snapped their fingers at him and Draco pulled himself out of the daze that their words sent him to, slowly lifting his eyes up to meet theirs. “Don’t you get it? I think you’re an annoying prat, but I don’t - I really don’t think you deserve Azkaban, I think you deserve a chance to get out of your stupid house and see that pretty much everything about you and everything you do is bigoted and cruel and get to maybe change that. We both know the only way you’d get that is if me, the Boy Who Lived, the great Harry Potter, spoke at your trial on your behalf.”
He desperately wracked his brain to match a face with those initials and came up empty. Why was this the only mail to get through the Ministry’s restrictions, and what did it mean by ‘talk’? There was nothing that suggested the writer was being particularly threatening, it didn’t tell him how disgusting and worthless he was, which would have been expected, but still something about it all was setting off warning bells in the back of his mind.
“I think you’re guessing correctly.” She smiled, and Draco thought she looked sad for a moment, and then it was gone. “Come, let me make you some more tea. My sister wants to bring Teddy around to meet you sometime, he is quite the child already. He’s inherited his mother’s metamorphagus talent and already he’s getting himself into mischief.”
“We’d better not, I don’t think I’m quite ready to wear boots again.” Draco slipped into the booth seat across from the Gryffindor and was instantly reminded of
He started for the bathroom door next, staring intently at its dulling metal handle as his body went through the motions of walking, and just as his pulse was starting to rise into worrying levels again his fingertips connected with the door handle. “Man up. Don’t be a pansy,” he mumbled to himself, and then he pulled the door open, carefully moving between tables and customers and trying to remember to keep breathing as he did.
Hey everyone, there's a bit of a warning for this chapter. It features some writing that's meant to imitate a panic attack or really frantic thoughts, and if you need to ignore those paragraphs because they may trigger something for you then please skip as needed. They're relatively non-essential and more for atmosphere's sake. Besides that, hope you enjoy!
Potter returned the smile with an added shrug. “It’s my job at this point.” Then they apparated away, vanishing with a quiet pop, and Draco’s expression softened when he realized they had left behind their cloak, gathering the warm, Potter-scented robes closer around himself as a chilled night breeze stirred up the leaves around his feet.
Their green eyes caught his own and suddenly Draco was there, kneeling in front of the Boy Who Lived on the floor of his family’s manor, their face distended so much that the famous scar looked no more than a curved line on their forehead and they looked like a hideous monster, something out of a child’s nightmare, and he hated the fact that he could still tell that it was them, hated the way his father hovered over his shoulder and he hated that he knew the way things would end if he listened to his father’s desperate whispers and made everyone proud for once-
Draco’s head had snapped up fast enough to give him whiplash when they started listing their own questionable actions, and his jaw had dropped before they finished speaking. Even as the Boy Who Lived it was incredibly dangerous to admit to such things, especially in front of the highest wizarding court, and yet here they were, risking their own freedom on a Death Eater’s behalf.
“Yes, yes, you lied because you care for him,” Aedan finished instead. “And if that were to come out, especially with him in attendance, the uproar would be unpleasant at best.”
Draco felt like an idiot for forgetting about that part of the world. “I - okay.” He ignored the surprise on their face from his easy acceptance, nodding. “I have literally no idea about anything muggle, but I - I am willing to try it,” he said hesitantly.
“Yeah, well, I signed up for it, didn’t I?” He could see their eyes shift down to his bare forearms, where his Death Eater tattoo was on full display, and moved that arm down to his lap. “Since we’re playing 20 questions, it’s my turn. What’s with the magic on your hand?”
It felt like he had only been there for a few moments before there was a hesitant knock on the stall door, echoing around the bathroom and making his entire body tense on instinct. Draco prayed to someone, anyone, to be left alone with his nightmares - he didn’t want to try to deal with a muggle in this state.
“Yes, well.” He traced the rim of the plastic cup with his thumb, shrugging in an attempt to seem casual. “It’s a much better outcome than what I expected, but it is technically the correct one.”
, this was - it seemed like speaking terms now. Most of the words didn’t stick in his brain for the first few read-throughs, only the underlined bits and the greeting, the
“Harry!” a female voice shouted, then a girl that looked only a few years younger than either of them came running out, long black ponytail trailing behind her as she flew past him, knocking Potter off-balance in a massive bear hug. “It’s been so long, mum’s going to be thrilled to see you, ugh you can’t just abandon us like that!”
“How can you just pretend that - that none of this just happened? That the last seven years were just, I don’t know, a dream? Forget that time in sixth year where you tried to kill me, or - or tonight, or the rest of it?”
“Aedan,” he called over his shoulder, and he waited until he heard the auror’s footsteps pause outside his open bedroom door before continuing. “We’re going to London tomorrow.”
The witch smiled triumphantly down at Draco before turning her attention back to Potter, looking as if she had made some grand revelation to the courtroom, and he can feel the glares from the
There was hardly any wax seal holding it closed - it was like someone had spilled it over the envelope, then tried to clean it up after it had already started to harden, setting in a shapeless puddle that barely crossed onto the flap. A twist of his wrist told him the sender didn’t write anything on the outside more than just ‘Draco Malfoy’, and he could feel Aedan’s curious gaze flicking between him and the envelope. “Should.... Should I open it?”
It isn’t anything too bad,but Draco definitely has a bigger sexual drive than Harry nowadays, and Harry can do only so much. Between his own lower sexual desire, the pressure and stress from work, he finds himself wishing to just go to bed once he arrives home most often than not.
It was not supposed to be like this, like every other week. It was supposed to be once in a while, but apparently Draco didn’t notice any of his signs, the way he kept excusing himself or asking if they could just tune it down a bit.
Harry enjoyed most of it. The way the Irish lad kissed him like his life depended on it, how he appreciated each and every single touch on Harry’s body, muttering nice words with a thick accent. As thick as his dick. How he managed to bring Draco closer and soon enough the three of them were dissolving into a gasping mess of hot bodies and slick fluids on top of the coverlet of the bed.
He hadn’t expected this much of a tirade, but it had been a while since she had truly exploded at something - if their positions were reversed, he supposed that he’d be doing the same thing. The night air was cool, a delicate breeze whisking away any remaining embarrassment he might have had. “Are you done?” he asked quietly, leaning against the building opposite the restaurant with his hands shoved in his pockets as she stomped around.
“No,” they replied instantly, and the instinctiveness of it made him feel more at ease. “It’s just... There’s not really anyone around to talk about the war with, I know I’ve got Ron and Hermoine but it’s just- they think we’ve all talked it to death, they’re done, they want their peace so they can move on. I, uhm - I don‘t think I’m quite ready for that yet.”
“Not today,” he replied vaguely, standing and nodding towards the door, but his mind was preoccupied with the way Potter had looked back at him from over their shoulder, their hair hinting at some gold in the cafe’s yellow lights.
“You may sit in that chair like it’s a throne, Mister Malfoy, but I want to remind you that you are no longer in command of anything - including yourself,” he repeated under his breath, brushing dust from a marble curl on the head of his mother’s favorite statue then flicking it off the pad of his thumb. “We’re truly sorry to have to do this to such a bright, young wizard.” Draco didn’t try to hide the mocking falsetto that was woven into the words, combing the greasy hair from his eyes with his fingers before tugging on it just to feel something, anything. The whole bloody manor was covered in the monitoring spells the ministry had cast when they had first hauled his father to Azkaban, and the record of his words wouldn’t report favorably in his hearing tomorrow; it was safe to assume the
Draco raised his head, and it took a moment for him to process the hand Potter was holding out towards him. “I don’t understand,” he said slowly.
“I see.” Draco winced inwardly at the formality of everything, slowly taking a sip from the glass of water in front of him. “It should be a quick recovery, I believe. I’m already starting to feel better.” He could feel eyes on him and turned, catching Aedan’s gaze with a raised eyebrow before they could pull it away. “What?”
They sat in silence for a few minutes and Draco took the time to properly look around the restaurant, ignoring the few furtive looks he knew Potter was stealing. The walls were painted white, with a red, detailed trim design painted along the ceiling, but the family photos and handmade art on the walls gave it a much more personal, cozy feeling, the sunlight coming in the front windows casting a golden glow over everything. He could feel their eyes on him, sizing him up or trying to catch his attention he didn’t know, but he pretended he didn’t notice it.
. The instant the words left his mouth Draco froze, his confession hanging thick in the air between the two. He was too terrified to look at them, to see the pity shining in their eyes, and he stood up to bolt for the door of the pub, tightly gripping his coat in one hand and his wand in the other as if they could pull him out of this mess he had made, but suddenly there’s a weight on his arm slowing him down.
was on the tip of his tongue but thought better of it, shaking his head. “You’re the savior of the wizarding world,” he finished awkwardly, and the slight wince they made at the title didn’t go unnoticed. “It’s not like we can just visit Hogsmede together on a weekend off.”
Their reply made him pause for a moment; there was one person that was here on his side, that didn’t believe he was the same degree of monster as his father. “Thank you,” Draco replied with a small nod, pushing away from the counter and starting towards the hall. “If you’ll excuse me, I’m going to go get ready for the hearing. Help yourself to any tea or biscuits, I’m sure such a talented auror like yourself should be able to find everything without too much trouble.” He waved aimlessly at the cupboards behind him as he passed through the doorway, slipping his wand into his back pocket, and before he had even reached the stairs his mind was already trying to come up with realistic reasons why Potter wanted to come to his rescue.
“I’m really not,” Saviour Potter replied almost immediately, and their matter-of-fact tone stung Draco more than it should have. “I’m definitely not Mrs. Malfoy, I don’t have kids, and he and I were just in the same classes, it’s not like we were mates. I don’t really care what her motivations used to be, or what they are now, all that mattered is that she wanted me alive, so here I am.” They raised a hand, waving towards the audience absently. His jaw was set, eyes flashing with a defiant expression that Draco remembered from potions, the familiarity of it almost making him smile. “Her son is the one on trial, so she is here, you know, if you want to ask her yourself.”
“I know, I know, I’m sorry. Tell your mum I say hi.” He watched them pull a few muggle bills from a wallet, holding them out to her. “Keep the change, you deserve the tip.”
“I’m not stupid. You’ve got a - a charm or something over the back of your right hand.” He nodded towards it. “It’s quite good, my father taught me about glamours when I was younger but I know Hogwarts didn’t teach us anything like that.” Like it knew it was being addressed, the magic on their skin flickered for a moment.
threatening to burn holes into his robes. “Then, Mister Potter, can you explain to me why you’re here testifying on Mister Malfoy’s behalf? He treated you horribly for so many years, he stood by and participated in the torture of your friends, yet you’re vouching for his innocence and freedom. Is it some sort of hero complex from the wizarding saviour, missing the spotlight now that the war has ended and the fame is starting to fall away?”
“Fucking hell, can’t I just bloody sleep!” The punch to the sturdy wooden mantle barely registered until after it happened and he pulled his hand back to cut knuckles, smearing the blood with his other hand as the wounds stung. The trial slideshow started again, and he could hear his mother in the viewing section, openly and quietly weeping for the first time in his life. Rita Skeeter had finished a Quick-Quotes-Quill page before anyone had spoken, and that first time he twisted around he had found a set of fern-colored, haunted eyes at the back of the room. Draco had never felt as small as he did in that moment.
Saviour Potter was dressed in what had to be a muggle outfit: dark jeans, a black windbreaker jacket they slipped off in order to drape it awkwardly over the back of the chair, and a grey cotton t-shirt with some writing on it, but the letters were impossible to make out. Part of Draco was shocked by how normal they looked, how unchanged Potter seemed despite everything he’d been through, that they’d both been through. Their hair was the same twisted birds-nest as it had been at Hogwarts, the same stupid glasses were balanced on their nose; the only different thing he could see was the 5’o’clock shadow lingering on their jawline. The emerald eyes Draco had caught on the first day of the hearing flicked over to him before jumping to something in the audience section, and the realization that they belonged to Potter made something catch in his throat. “Fuck,” he whispered, little more than a breath, and he hated the way his pulse skipped. He could already tell that having them sit there, mere meters away, would make the day’s proceedings feel like an eternity, and he was dreading every moment of it.
Draco laughed, but there was no humor in it. “I have learned that there is no real rest for the wicked, not even death.” He looked up at them, the pad of his thumb running back and forth over one of the ridged edges of the saucer, and he took a moment to choose his next words carefully. “Do you believe them?” he said quietly, and he knew they needed no clarification on what he was asking about.
The paper mouth curled up into a very sinister, threatening grin, then proceeded to catch on fire again, vanishing into a cloud of ash. He hadn’t recognized the voice, something very high-pitched, female, and almost bordering on hysterical.
“Congratulations, Draco.” He twisted to see Aedan settle into the seat next to him, looking particularly pleased. “I ran into Mister Potter on his way out, he told me you are to be cleared after the next hearing, that is very good news.”
Was it really that obvious, did it show in his eyes during the trial, did he slip up and say something because
This sounded like a Ministry trap. “Does it matter?” he asked hesitantly, and when he snuck a glance at them their eyes were glazed over.
“No, I’m - I’m brilliant,” he managed after clearing his throat. “Brilliant.” His voice sounded foreign and raw, but she seemed to accept his response. Memories of the fight still flashed on the backs of his eyelids every time he blinked, still stealing some of his air each time.
his heart skipped involuntarily and he could already feel his cheeks growing warm at the realization, quickly turning his face away and shoving the letter back into the envelope.
of yours would get out of hand and this is only the beginning of it, he is going to hurt you even if you do just stay friends, don’t you get that? He’s already cut you open and left you to die once, is he going to have to try to kill you again in order for you to open your damn eyes?”
Potter hummed, then there was a bit of silence between them as they both sipped at their drinks. It was awkward, but considering they hadn’t started spitting insults yet, he’d consider the whole thing to be going well so far. They were dressed casually, black leather jacket over a white tee, hair still unruly and impossibly tangled, and there was this stubble on their jaw that made them look older than the mere eighteen they both were. “So,” Potter started, leaning back against the booth, “how are things back at the manor, now that your mum’s moved back in? Are they starting to feel more, uhm, more normal now?”
A shudder ripped through his body and he pressed his forehead to the cool, stone wall, cradling his hand against his chest. “Please,” he begged to the manor settling around him, to the snowflake-dusted sky that was sending the first hints of winter to the ground, to the fucking spirit of Dumbledore, to the god he didn’t believe in - to whoever would listen to him anymore. “Just - just let me sleep.” The house settled with a sigh that pooled in his throat, sending faint rivers of blood along the creases in his hand, and he hated himself for the voice break that made his own knees weak. Outside, the peacocks screamed at the setting moon, echoing across the estate.
“Draco?” He turned and his mother was standing in the doorway, hand against the weathered frame, her concern only showing in the faint crease of her forehead; she must have erased the silencing charm after sneaking up on him. “Are you alright?”
“That’s, uhm -” This was the first time he had ever seen Potter truly speechless, and something inside of him smiled weakly despite the panic. “That’s awful.”
Something inside him snapped, and Draco saw red. “Don’t,” he said loudly, and when she didn’t acknowledge that he spoke he rushed her, using a hand on her shoulder to spin her to face him before shoving her back into the restaurant’s brick wall with his arm pressing into her neck. There was a loud huff, like all the air in her lungs was forced out on impact. “Don’t you ever compare me to my father again,” he hissed, pushing a little more of his weight into her windpipe, and a strangled sound slipped past her lips. Their faces were so close he could feel each of her heavy, desperate breaths on his cheek, her eyes wide and filled with a mix between pity and something else that made his stomach turn, and she had her hands wrapped around his forearm as if she meant to fight him off. “I am nothing like him, nothing.” The words came out as a low snarl, harsh enough to hurt his throat on the way out. His heart was pounding, thudding loudly in his ears, drawing out the sound of the main street completely. “Got it?”
“And?” The question slipped out before he could stop it so he sniffed once, hastily wiped at his eyes with the back of his hand, then lifted his chin to meet their gaze. “Should I even bother returning home today, or are you going to just arrest me right here?”
“Hey,” they replied, shifting a receipt paper to mark their place before closing the book. “I wasn’t sure if you’d want coffee or tea or anything, but they gave me a few water glasses when I got my drink.” He gestured to a black-lidded cup in front of him and the two smaller, clear glasses next to it. “I can go up to get you something.”
He heard a rustle as they spun towards him, then footsteps as they followed, and the front door quietly clicked shut. Draco assumed they had used magic to guide it closed, going to one of the tall, mounted cupboards, pausing with his hand on the handle as the man spoke. “I was sent to watch over you during the length of your hearing, under order of the Minister of Magic himself. Have you.... Have you received any owls or mail, recently?”
Draco nodded, sitting up a little straighter in his chair and debating on if he should stand as well. “I appreciate it,” he said instead, offering them another hesitant smile as his hands twisted together in his lap. Potter’s insistence on getting drinks, even if it was only as enemies-turned-acquaintances, sent his stomach into a nervous churn. “And when - if I get off,” he corrected quickly, “we’ll be properly even, no more of this life-saving ridiculousness you keep throwing around.”
“Hey, Malfoy, follow me.” They waved, waiting for him to catch up before starting back down the street they came from with their hands shoved into their jean pockets. “It’s a few blocks this way, this little Indian place my godfather showed me when he was still around.”
Draco was pulled from his thoughts as Aedan knocked softly on the doorframe, turning and looking up enough to meet the auror’s gaze, and he could see his own wishes reflected back in their eyes. “I’m not going to get my hopes up,” he lied, stepping back from the window. “It’s not - I’m not stupid you know, it’s never going to happen.”
“I don’t see why not.” They shrugged but then took a step back, a decision that didn’t go unnoticed. “Just in case something happens,” they explained, offering a reassuring smile, but it didn’t settle the ball of nerves starting to build in his gut.
He could hear them suck in a sharp breath, like they wanted to shout something, and then Amber reappeared with steaming bowls. “Alrighty, here’s your paneer makhani Harry, and the lamb biryani for you, and a naan for each... Either of you want more chai?”
“I think I’m okay for right now, thank you. Not sure I’ll even be able to eat this all.” He took one spoonful and sighed because the rice was warm, the lamb nearly melting under his touch, the bit of spice running underneath everything else - he felt alive again.
“Well yeah, he murdered all the house elves after I escaped and you all needed to eat.” Potter shrugged, and Draco knew they were both thinking about Dobby - his mother had told him what happened, how Potter had set up an official grave on the coast somewhere, but the only thing he could picture was the stern scolding the house elf had given him when he had whipped around the manor on his first broomstick and knocked himself unconscious on a lower-than-average door frame. “I spend enough time at this restaurant for the owners to know me by name, so just brace yourself for that.”
Draco hadn’t seen the other guests come into the restaurant but a few of the other tables had people at them, one close enough to limit their conversations. “I’m fine, thank you,” he replied quietly, and Potter just shook his head.
peering down at him with thinly veiled pity. He realizes the loud throbbing in his head is his heartbeat thudding in his ears. “You sounded like you were in distress,” she added primly, and Draco quickly shook his head.
The thing about surrender is that once you accept the unavoidable rhythm of change, the surprising uncontrollability of life, and the astonishing inevitability of feelings, it is easy.
“Fuck off!” Remus kicks Sirius on the shin and sets to put awful-looking slices of cake on plates and tea on cups. “Going back to the topic of flats. So you're staying with us, Harry?” he asks lightly, passing a plate to Sirius, who looks at it miserably.
It was a sexy idea, exploring other bodies with Draco, engaging in sex with other people to spice things up. Something inside of him was excited about the prospect, but the nagging fear, the feeling of abandonment that follows each image that pops in his head is throwing him off.
They share a moment of silence, just looking at each other. They’ve been through so much over the years. And in the pregnant silence of the kitchen, it feels real. The fear of the last few weeks, the reality of Moony in the ITU—the fear of losing him for good this time.
. But he was there by my side every day, repeating to me that I am the love of his life, making me ugly-sob on a hospital bed wearing only a dreadful hospital gown.”
Sirius knows a lot about loneliness and lack of family support. So he sighs deeply, already giving in, deciding that Narcissa will be his personal project. She has never been his favourite cousin, but Andromeda fucked off to Cuba a year after he was kicked out of Grimmauld Place. So she will do.
Sirius is wearing his pyjama pants and a battered band t-shirt again, this time with the logo of X-Japan. The collar is worn and stretched, showing Sirius’s bony, white left clavicle. There’s a shock of colour against his pale skin, a bruise. No, a
“I’m so deep inside you now, Harry,” he whispers hotly against the shell of Harry’s ear, heart bursting with meaning and emotion and pleasure. “This is real, do you feel it? Do you feel me?”
“No, it wasn’t a date,” Harry shakes his head. His hair is still damp but he changed into his pyjamas once he arrived home, feeling too cold to handle the feelings in wet clothes. “He—he was in the club.”
She came to last week's Family and Friends meeting with his mum, because she wanted to know more about the centre and even volunteered to help in their next free rapid STI, HIV and Hepatitis C tests next month.
“I cut myself. The floor is full of shards, don’t step on it,” he adds quickly, before Remus could walk in.
There’s a discomfort inside his chest that Harry cannot exactly pinpoint. The pit of his stomach feels acidic and scratchy and a painful headache is starting in the back of his skull.
It’s fun to see Theo laughing along as Blaise says he read that rimming is kind of safe for HIV-positive people—
“What are you talking about, Sirius? And can you please lower your voice.” Her voice tightens, looking around.
Suddenly, Draco feels sure; he feels confident and it’s like a second skin long forgotten, like a perfect match and his body vibrates with it, with love and care and the need to show Harry that he is here, that he is not going anywhere.
He touches himself while reading the answer, sneaking his hand under the waistband and teasing the head of his cock.
He sighs, feeling suddenly exhausted. Gets up, places the mug in the sink, and goes back to the table, bending down to hug Sirius from behind, wrapping his shoulders in his arms, burying his face in his godfather's hair and feeling the man’s hands hold tight to his forearms.
Draco brushes away a fugitive tear rolling down his face, looking away to compose himself and the crashing waves inside his chest. His eyes land on the red bird again—it wasn’t alone anymore, as another red bird was sitting by its side, and they were pecking gently at each other.
“Do you want me to tuck you in bed?” Sirius asks teasingly, while Harry dried his face on the sleeves of his old, soft pyjama shirt.
“This is a lie! This is not even what I actually mean!” he says angrily, agitated. “Because at least I had that. You know? The messy and dirty, the unprotected sex that meant nothing. I bloody had that, time after time, but I’ve never—” He sobs.
“You should have said that,” Draco looked at him. They slept so little, but he looked glorious. All bed hair and loose limbs. “I thought you just didn’t want more, that you were okay with us having some more fun!”
Harry prepared a cuppa in the kitchen and sat at the table, staring out the window. It was dawn, the black sky mixing with light grey. A soft drizzle falling lazily. He just wanted to sleep.
“Wrong. You thought wrong!” His voice is cold and he doesn’t even say goodbye to anyone, grabbing their coats and leaving the house without seeing anyone on their way out and apparating them back to their townhouse.
How his long fingers braid small yellow and white flowers into Luna’s long, messy hair. How he does it slowly and methodically, entwining blonde strands of hair with thin green stems of flowers, creating intricate patterns with dedication and calm, his back turned to Harry.
And walking they go. Draco knows his friends have been worried about him retreating from the world, worming his way into the depths of depression, the dark pit of a whale’s belly.
“How funny,” he retorts, but Remus looks at him seriously. “Okay...” Harry has a history of fainting after seeing too much blood, but he was a teenager back then, to be fair.
Harry knew the feeling. He knew what it meant. He never expected to feel it towards Malfoy, though. Not like this, not this strong. He wanted to fight it, to throw it off like he did an Imperius curse.
How long has it been? How many times has he thought he would never do this again with someone he loves? He licks and kisses Harry’s hole, the soft curls of dark hair against his tongue feels dreamlike, surreal. He licks and kisses and tongues at his entrance, not delving in, just teasing.
“But I don’t want to make him go through this. So I need help.” Narcissa looks him dead in the eyes. She is resolute, her tone firm and decided. “Would you help me?”
“Draco,” he calls, and it goes Draco, Draco, Draco. In the silence of his own room, in the darkness of his own house, in the emptiness of his own self. And he craves and whines and comes, comes, comes in his hand, with only Draco’s lovely face carved like a mirage on his closed eyelids.
He feels warm and loved. He knows it’s not real, but it fills him with such hope. He can’t see Harry. He can’t face him. Harry deserves nice things, sunny, warm things. And Draco has no idea how to offer him that.
He moves faster and slower at the same time, as if trying to avoid it and catch it at the same time. He is so confused. He’s so scared. He’s fucking angry.
Draco’s art gallery is receiving all kinds of critiques. Good ones, bad ones. His mood is going up and down and he even started smoking again. Drumming his fingers anxiously over all flat surfaces, making Harry feel bad everytime Draco proposes something different in the sex department to get some steam off.
His bloody fault, because he keeps lying to Harry like a bloody online creep. He tried to keep his distance over the last few weeks, and he is working the hardest he can to gather enough courage to tell him the truth. Draco is trying to accept the possibility of Harry rejecting him, but it is hard.
They feel warm and soft and Harry wants to discover all the small parts of Draco that he watched so intently, and all the other bits he couldn’t watch properly. He’s done watching. He wants to touch now, to explore with his fingers and hands and all the limbs of his body.
But Harry knows his own case is not just a fever. Even when he is trying his best not to feel like this. He’s sure the feeling burns like fever and turns into ribbons of yearning intertwined so intricately around the arteries of his heart and the roots of his bowels in beautiful patterns, just like the ones he watched Draco braid in Luna’s hair.
It resonates with Draco. The guilt, the disgust, the undeservedness that accompanies bad outcomes. The idea that now he doesn’t get to have happy, beautiful, joyous experiences.
Draco knows exactly how it feels. This man telling them his story could be Draco revisiting that first month.
“You were right: he is not who he said he was. I shouldn’t have believed in a stranger.” Harry says, feeling a mix of anger and embarrassment.
“That’s good,” Sirius says reassuringly. “You don’t need to worry too much, then, he’s with friends.”
His hand encourages Harry’s legs to stretch further, delighted at seeing Harry so open and vulnerable and surrendered.
But it’s Draco’s eyes that take Harry’s breath away. They are clear grey, very similar to Sirius’s eyes. They look piercingly at the camera, and his gaze pins Harry down to his chair. These eyes can see him, as if Draco is seeing through to his soul.
“That bad, eh?” the man replies, and smiles gently at him. “Pretty sure you will live long enough to be as eccentric and bold as good old Albus,” he cracks a teasing smirk.
“Wow Harry, that was-” Draco shakily presses open mouthed kisses over Harry’s beard, biting his jaw and traveling his hand to Harry’s cock, to find it soft. “What-”
“Draco,” he says, voice deep and serious. “You are going to live, kid, and you will love and be loved. Hear this, pup: you will be happy and I’ll make sure to be there every step of the way. Be it with Harry or without, you are not going to be alone. Never in your life, until you are old and wrinkled. Because you have family and good friends. Mark my words, Draco.”
He feels his body go cold, heartbeats slowing down, his own breath comes out shaky and his hands are sweaty and disgusting. Harry stares at them in silence, embarrassed and cold. Oh gods, so cold. And suddenly he understands most of it was only in his head.
So he watches, as Parkinson luxuriates under the sun in an old-fashioned polka dot bikini and huge sunglasses, resting her head on Ron’s chest, passing him a can of Muggle beer. And how Ron laughs as Ginny runs around and jumps on Dean, getting him all wet and cold. How Luna is lying on her belly, elbows propping her up while reading a thick book about whatever it is she is interested now.

Someone enters the room and sits close to the door and the sound brings Draco back to his surroundings.
“No, not exactly,” he says, feeling out of sorts. “He obviously enjoys it more than I do. And he’s so self-confident all the bloody time...”
Harry threads his fingers into Draco’s long soft hair and opens his mouth and deepens the kiss and she presses back against his chest, hot and delicious and alive. God, so alive. She tastes like a love story and he is sure he’s falling harder as she whimpers softly against his mouth, and their tongues brush and dance, dance, dance.
“Fuck, Potter,” she says, and takes a deep breath, smiling still, looking bright and messy and gorgeous. And Draco hugs him, hard and clumsy and it's perfect, lovely, really, it’s all Harry ever wanted. “Harry, Harry, Harry...” she whispers against his neck, nose against the curve of his jaw, inhaling his sweaty scent and Harry laughs.
Because, looking closely, they’re just sharing a smoke and laughing. But Harry... Well, Harry got this all wrong.
He is hard inside his pyjama trousers. He is not wearing pants and the slight friction of the soft fabric against his hot skin is making this so sensual.
“Oh, Sirius,” Remus mutters, disapprovingly, putting the cushion on the floor and sitting on it. “You are
Pansy brings the biscuits at noon, which is ridiculous because she is a terrible baker and she knows it. But she’s been checking in on him constantly, making sure he is fine, that he is eating, taking his meds, sleeping. But he doesn’t know when he is going to feel fine again. He feels like maybe he is already dead, only he hasn’t physically disappeared yet.
And Remus laughs properly, openly, his voice vibrating through the room, and he motions at Draco to stand up.
“Draco Malfoy,” he says, with an out-of-place proud smile on his face and Draco feels he missed something, the bit in which they are introduced to each other. “You’re Harry’s boyfriend,” he continues and Remus sputters beside Draco, also confused.
“Thank you,” she mutters. “I’ve read a lot and I keep feeling I know nothing. I want to be there for him, Sirius. I don’t want him to feel like he is alone. It took him five months to tell me. It was the first time he brought up his homosexuality, actually, as if I wouldn’t have noticed.”
He gets out of bed and pads softly on socked feet, only in his pants and pyjama shirt, through the maze of hallways and down the stairs.
His resolution is faltering in a mix of bless and doubt, he thinks he better enjoy the fact that he is enjoying it.
“What am I missing here, Harry? You feel pressured into doing it? Tell me, because I am really lost here.”
“I don’t have an issue with this,” she adds, quickly. “But I also don’t have anyone who can relate with his experience in my circle of friends and acquaintances. And I don’t want to make the mistake that was done to you.”
“What we did to you was atrocious. I know it now. And to think he thought we would do the same to him...It pains me. I may have my own issues, and I do make lots of mistakes, but I would never do that to him.”
Later that day, he writes a long email to Draco, adding a photo of the showcase with the little dragons, telling him everything about the plot of the book and the characters.
Theo must have noticed, because he extends a hand and rests in on Draco’s bony knee, his fingers warming the woolen trouser and the skin underneath.
They laugh so hard they forget all about the horrendous cake, about shitty family stories and about how crude Sirius
promtp: lol, ya'll it was a tiny christmas three with the rainbow colours, which I am using as: LGBTQIA! <3
He takes the stairs. Heart crazy inside his chest, he feels like he’s drowning in the pool of acid and bile in the pit of his stomach .

A sob escapes through his lips. He feels so much pain. His shoulders shake and the tears sting and his whole body feels broken.
“Draco—oh god—” Harry keens underneath him, and Draco’s hand eases him, caressing his bent legs, feeling the thick dark hairs of Harry’s thighs against his palms.
“But Padfoot is stubborn as all hell, and Harry will be the same, I’m sure of it.” He laughs. “They have this kind of loyalty that is not easily found, you know... So—” he takes another deep breath “—you will need to learn how to be honest, brutally honest with Harry. About your fears and your feelings. And that’s the tricky part of any relationship, to share and communicate, because this is the only way to go about it, HIV-positive or not, see.”
“Don’t say shit you don’t mean,” Draco replies sharply, and her voice is so full of emotion that Harry thinks maybe, maybe, maybe.
The last few days, Draco has been trying to eat more often. Nutritious meals, the doctor had said, so he has been trying to do it. He only hopes he will gain some weight and stop looking gaunt in his reflection.
Right now, he just wants to make this all stop and bring Draco home alone. Debauch his posh pointy face, fuck his mouth, grabbing him by the hair.
He can’t stop looking at Draco and how engaged he is in the conversation, how he nods and Harry can make out the straight line of his jaw, his pointy chin, the fair stubble...
But love can also be simple, soft, kind. It can be a mole behind one’s ear, and a constellation on someone’s back, it can be a touch on a child’s brow or long fingers braiding a friend’s hair.
It’s decided. And Sirius is stubborn as all hell. He can already see her, with a high-quality glittery rainbow t-shirt. It’s going to be the best revenge. And Sirius’s bigoted father will turn and scream in his ugly posh grave.
“Too right, pup, not her and not anyone else since that awful summer in which my father so nicely kicked me out for sucking cock!”
He’s wearing one of Harry’s old Gryffindor t-shirts — it’s a bit big on him, falling off one slender shoulder.
“You’re beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.” His voice echoes in the hallway, and Draco smiles at him, eyebrows flying up, cherry lipstick sticky and beautiful. She’s so disheveled, she’s probably a mess, and Harry is pretty sure he’s a mess too. He feels it, the sweat under his t-shirt; he probably stinks, but he’s tipsy and lightheaded, and there’s a specific kind of light in her eyes that says so much and so little at the same time, that Harry just knows. He knows he loves this woman, and he wants her. And maybe Draco wants him too.
The man from the back of the room stands and walks into the circle, sitting on one of the empty chairs. He looks old, old like Draco’s parents. He is all long limbs and woolen cardigan, like a character from an old novel. Draco can picture him sitting on an armchair, reading a book, sipping on a cup of tea with a tabby cat on his lap by the window.
“I started dating a boy,” he says, quietly. Mr. Dumbledore claps cheerfully and Cho whistles, laughing and Draco beams at them, feeling the spark of happiness burn hot inside of him. “He said we’re boyfriends now, and as I told you before, I’ve never loved anyone. But I’m crazy about him,” he confesses, feeling his cheeks grow warm. Remus watches him with a soft, proud smile. “But he’s not HIV-positive and I worry about it,” he explains, now looking back at Remus. “I mainly worry about broken condoms, to be honest.” The group members nod understandingly.
“Wife, kids and all!” Draco presses. “Alright, I admit I was interested, and at some point I may have been flirty but he started telling me about his wife's work, who also works at an Art Gallery, in Vienna. And when I look around you are not there anymore. I was looking for you when Gerard asked if I wanted to smoke. I thought it would be fun you know, like old times, but you were nowhere, so I went out to smoke and then... What even was that?” his hands are gesticulating in big wavy movements. “Wild magic, Harry? Exploding lightbulbs? What the
Sirius had always been the cheerful one, the first to crack a joke in a tense situation, the first to look on the bright side. Seeing him so low this past few weeks made Harry realise they are all very vulnerable. Existence is fragile and no one is ever ready to manage such drastic life changes.
Thank you to everyone who read this fic as a WIP, your encouragement and kindness made it possible, gave me hope and confidence. It was a huge pleasure to have you onboard!
“Gods, this exhibition is going to be a blast!” he says excitedly, opening a bottle of wine with a flick of his wand in a very good mood.
and she is gorgeous and he’s never loved someone like this– he’s never wanted so much in his life. And he wants her, her, her.
Draco thinks of Blaise. He thinks of the row they had after telling him he tested positive. About Blaise shouting at him, demanding of him why he hadn’t been more careful. And all the awful things they said to each other until Blaise cracked and started crying, and they held each other, tangled on Draco’s bed and weeping, starting to mourn the frightening reality of disease.
He can’t exactly explain how it started, it was maybe a year back. Draco wanted to explore a few fantasies, one or two kinks. Nothing too much. Harry rather liked it. If he thinks back, he can still see Draco with fishnet stockings on and high heels; Christ but wasn’t his husband sexy as fuck in a black thong? He always gets hot and bothered with the memory.
Harry watches Draco change into a pair of pajamas. He hears him, feels his presence. He hears with his whole body what is real: Draco is right here with him. At home.
“I don’t want to go back to my flat, that’s all,” is what Harry is saying and Sirius is watching him from the sofa with a skeptical expression on his face. “What?” he asks crossly.
“You know we love you very much, don't you, Prongslet?” Sirius’ voice sounds slightly choked as he places a kiss on Harry's forearm and squeezes him once more before letting go of Harry's embrace and composing himself, sniffing.
“Shit, shit, shit.” He throws the soiled toilet paper into the bin and jumps into his bed. His bare right foot hurts like hell. “I knocked the pine tree over,” he yells at the door. “It’s fine!”
It’s been more than two weeks since the graveyard visit, but somehow he is still holding the smallest grudge against Sirius. Also, Draco has been terribly quiet, and last night when they finally met online, he wasn’t only closed off, but he also declined Harry’s attempt at cybersex.
“And you always want more, need more, and you don't even consider that maybe I am already tired or spent. It’s always you and your petty little selfish self. I die a little every time, and this sounds ridiculous even to me. I feel like I am a kid, you even said I was overreacting or whatever, but do you hear me when I say I can’t do this anymore? Because I can’t, Draco. I can’t...”
” He closes his eyes as if watching the scene on repeat on the screen in his mind. “I shouted at him, told him to leave, that I needed to be alone.”
It’s Draco, Draco, Draco. Her name echoes back in his mind as Harry curses and presses a hand against his eyes and his long, untamed curls. His legs are tangled in the sheets and blankets, and around him the room looks a mess. Of course– it’s Draco’s room in the shady block between Knockturn and Diagon Alley. It smells mouldy even though he knows Draco always refreshes the spells. Its a fucking shithole, that’s what it is, but Draco lost friends along the way, and she hates living off others, and couldn’t accept a room in Grimmauld Place.
“But Sirius, it is different now. I know better now, and it’s my son. I won’t let his father or anyone in the family treat him like they treated you. Nowadays, I have the knowledge and the means to stand up for him. But I will need your help.”
Looking around, as if gathering his surroundings, Draco seems to realise what is going on and he starts shaking his head, trying to control his laughter.
“I love when you’re stinky...” Draco replies, his tongue already darting over Harry’s nape, teeth scraping his skin and making Harry shiver. A mix of excitement and dread runs over his body and he tries to relax.
He knows it’s weird. To meet people online, to prefer to spend his time in front of a screen than to go out with his friends. Ginny and Ron have been messing with him about it as he stopped going to the pub on Fridays night to spend his time talking to Draco.
YES this is me indulging in Wolfstar gaydads being gooddads, of course, light of my life, fire on my loins, sending you happy christmas with a bit of family joy!
And Harry decides he wants to touch that one. With the tip of his tongue. He wants to taste the flavour of Draco’s skin. He wants him.
“Are you going to tell us what is going on?” Sirius insists. He is being a right jerk and Harry hates when his godfather does this.
Once Harry accepts the tempestuous turmoil of feelings inside his chest every time he sees Draco, the warmth and kindness of those feelings become something delightful and familiar. Not quite like the initial butterflies and winds, not as intense as the rainforest storm, but something like the comes and goes of the waves on a sunny beach. Lapping at his chest in a constant rhythm.
“Fuck, Narcissa.” He smiles brightly at her. “Sounds like we will need to get over our past, dear cousin.”
“No, not today,” he says, bringing their lips together again, biting Draco’s lips, undoing the buttons of his shirt. “I want you to suck me off on your knees...”
well,” Sirius affirms irritably. There’s the sore topic of the house: Harry feeling scared of Remus getting sick again and Padfoot denying the possibility.
A strangled howl leaves his body as he cries openly, ugly, his nose leaking and his whole being shaking.
He is pretty sure it started on a drunken pub night with Ron kissing Pansy Parkinson, and Draco Malfoy laughing by his side at the absurdity of the scene. But he’s not too sure.
“I don’t know how I will feel,if I will deal with it well or not. I fear you falling for someone else and leaving me, but honestly,” Harry sighs. “I am also curious. It could go well, right? If we do things together?”
painful. With the breeze messing Draco’s hair and the plants in the back of the picture and the way Draco holds himself tightly, posture taut as if he needed to go about his life prepared to hold himself if the wind blew too hard.
Life flows like river water, strong and intense, then sometimes slow and calm. And life right now feels tempestuous, just like his heart beating a fast tempo while Malfoy checks Teddy’s temperature and runs diagnostic spells and checks his tonsils with a blue light on the tip of his wand.
“Let’s get drunk and dance,” she says, already walking around, so certain of herself. She knows the house so well, Harry thinks. She looks wonderful here. Like she belongs, belongs, belongs.
“Nice meeting you too,” Harry gets closer to Draco's armchair, resting a rather possessive hand on his shoulder.
Sirius must understand, must realise—because having death’s breath on the nape of their necks made them all realise how fleeting life can be.
His friends are very supportive, but they don’t know what it is to be queer, or to have someone you love dealing with serious health issues every time their immune system gets weak.
As if he could hear Harry’s thoughts, Draco looks straight up to him. The music is so loud Harry feels like he is floating. Grey eyes focus on him with that slow, indecent smile... Harry feels himself hardening inside his pants and he just wishes he could have Draco’s attention only for himself.
All the anger he’s been bottling up comes to the surface and he’s sure Draco can see it in his eyes.
“You know how much it means to us that you are here, right? I know that, at some point, you will want to go back to your flat, but you can stay here as long as you want. Moony feels more at ease having you around...”
“Even when I’m feeling great with you in the middle of sex you come up with something that we already discussed I’m not into,” his voice rings strong in the room, Draco’s expression is a mix of shame and pain. “And then all I feel is disgust towards you, towards sex. I feel like I’m an object.” He keeps going. “If we bring someone home, I try to enjoy myself. And hear this, Draco, I am no prude, I am no saint, and I enjoy sex very much and it’s good, but then all your attention is focused on only this new body, this new person, as if I don’t even exist!”
“Yes,” she nods. “I was really scared, so I’ve been doing some research on the internet to understand it better. But I fear—I don’t—Sorry...” Her voice cracks.
Sirius's eyes go cold and steely: he is all of a sudden very still, and it’s rather scary to see him like this.
“Buckle up, Cissy, I’ll be the best gay cousin you ever had. And next Pride, you will be by my side, with your gay, HIV-positive son, feeling damn proud of our queer family.”
To be honest, Draco has been so wrapped up in his own journey of acceptance that he didn’t realise the LGBT Centre had different group activities, for different target cohorts. There’s a group for LGBT teenagers and another one for parents. Then there’s the Trans Circle, the Sex Workers Group, and the HIV-positive and AIDS sessions.
Sirius' voice floods the kitchen and Harry looks up, his fingers holding a big cuppa, feeling the warmth on his palm and the pleasant aroma of Assam—a smell so typical of that house, that kitchen, the home where he was raised. There is something very welcoming about the pale yellow walls and light coloured wooden furniture and the not-so-organised organisation of the kitchen.
“I’ve never thought about it,” he concedes. “Most of what I write comes from my own experiences and emotions, but I’ve done a few journalistic reports before. It would be an interesting project.”
“Don’t be nosy,” he mutters, turning the mug in his hands. “Yes... just a few...” Harry rubs his hands over his flushed face. “He is... Mysterious, attentive... I thought it could work.”
He takes a deep breath. Emotions are swimming inside of him. He feels sad that no one cared for him back then like Narcissa cares for her son. He feels proud of her for being a much better mother than Walburga or Druella ever were. He feels acknowledged by her asking him for help.
He puts extra effort to make it good, though. He makes it dirty and harsh, because he feels harsh and pissed off. He wants to make Draco come as fast as possible and be done with this. And when Draco spills in the back of his throat, moaning and shaking under Harry’s hands and mouth, Harry spits spunk over the kitchen floor with disgust, completely out of character, and stands up in a hurry.
“And I lost count on how many times the topic was approached at home, so Harry is very well-versed in ways to be careful and responsible in the protection department,” Remus assures him with a mischievous little smirk that makes Draco want to hide his face and never look at Remus ever again.
And Draco shivers, hands grasping at the back of Remus’s woollen cardigan. He’s half-sobbing, half-laughing at the same time, feeling how ridiculously insane this situation is: that the man who gave him hope is Harry's godfather and that he is deeply concerned for their well-being. But also that Remus is here: opening his arms to welcome Draco into their very non-traditional queer family.
He thinks about all these months. How Blaise saw his mood swings and his dark moments and how the shadows of sadness hued his dark brown eyes. And seeing him now, so delighted at Draco’s cheesy love story, is like seeing his own happiness reflected in his friend’s face.
Draco is the one who moves, because Harry is hypnotised, mesmerised, paralised. She moves like a belly dancer as always, caging Harry against the wall, long limbs against Harry’s body and it's hot, hot, hot and so hard to breathe.
He has no idea if they can mend things. If they will manage to put their pieces back together. He wants to believe they can, but he doesn’t know.
“The first person I told was my best friend and he cried. He got so sad and he cried so much and I was so bloody angry. At him, at me, at my life, at fucking AIDS, at gay sex...”
“Dammit,” he mutters, feeling his eyes sting with pain but trying to be calm. “REMUS!” he calls out. “C’mon,” he starts feeling dizzy, he hates blood so much. He looks up, blinking the tears away staring at the ceiling. “SIRIUS!”
Sirius groans and Remus starts laughing, coming into the living room holding a tray with a teapot, cups and plates, setting it on the coffee table, beside the poor chocolate cake he baked earlier today that came out a bit limp and a bit burnt at the same time.
It feels like once he lets his anger surface, it comes in wave after terrifying wave of pure, breathtaking, blinding rage. Even his voice is disgusting and cold. Sharp as a dagger's edge. Ready to hurt and maim.
There’s a tin of biscuits on the small table by his bed, but he doesn’t feel hungry. He feels like he could smoke a cigarette, but he doesn’t want to face the rain outside and he really doesn't want to make the fire alarm go off like last week. It was such a bother...
“I did. But then, it felt pretty off. Like you guys were in a different tune that I couldn’t reach.”
Also, I have NO WORDS to thank everyone commenting and cheering me up with this story. You guys are bloody amazing. I got really nice feedback on the sirem/wolfstar bit and people asking for prequels! I would love to write more about them in this universe or even add extra wolfstar scenes in a side fic, after finishing writing Dragons. So if you would like that, subscribe to this fic and to my dashboard and I'll let you know when I create a collection for new Dragons's universe fics with wolfstar delight.
But to think back, to when he met Harry online, when he was in the depths of his depression, when he thought he prefered being dead to feeling so empty and hollow and so full of pain and grief, not knowing how to deal with his virus... and to reflect on how now he is so full of life and hope.
Weird, how the universe works. Weider still, how long-lost family members can come together in moments like this.
Remus normally goes to the Saturday group since it’s at the same time as the family and friends meeting. But he wants to start doing arts and crafts activities on Saturdays with Luna and the children at the bookshop. He is feeling much stronger lately and the doctor encouraged him to go back to work for good, saying it’s safe.
“You are drunk,” she whispers, but now her eyes are dark and focused on Harry’s mouth and both of them are breathing hard and deep. And Harry loves hard and deep. Harry loves her. Fuck, he loves her.
Harry feels the headache again and takes the stairs up to their ensuite, tea kettle long forgotten. A shower will make him well, better than a cuppa right now.
“I’m sorry, Gerard,” Draco is saying and giving back the jellyweed cigarette. “Harry has been working a lot lately,” he keeps apologising.
But there she is, shining like a supernova in the middle of the dance club, smiling up at a man that isn’t Harry, grey eyes painted with charcoal, movements like a tantalising belly dancer.
Draco thrusts up and feels Harry shake and tense around him, holding onto the headboard with one hand, the other gripping hard on Draco’s hair, as he thrusts up against Draco’s hand and comes. And Draco is coming deep and hard inside of Harry in a mix of pain and pleasure and happiness.
Remus and Draco are staring at Sirius with confused, wild expressions, but the man is unrelenting, smiling brightly and warmly. His clear grey eyes, just like Draco’s, stare at him with a fiery light. And, now that Draco thinks, he looks very much like a much more interesting version of cousin Regulus.
He wanted to go back in time and live the way they used to over the last years, before this whole shit started. Without the need of adding kinks Harry wasn’t into or bringing men to their bed. Without feeling so inadequate and not sexual enough and so insecure.
“I’m so full,” Harry gasps, his mouth chasing Draco’s and they kiss, messy and hot, all tongue and saliva.
Harry shrugs. Oh, if his auror mates could see how he acts around Draco when he’s unsure of himself... Nothing like badass Auror Potter and more like a little, insecure teenager.
(nah, I'm not really *smiles devilishly* :P I write angst, folks, we should have expected I would drag our limp bodies over the nail-bed before Good Things happen. but, hey, they will happen. Pretty Soon.)
The image in front of his eyes makes Harry feel warm all over, a strong wave of affection and tenderness unfolds inside his chest like a rainbow and washes him with boiling gentleness.
Draco looks up at the sky, and Harry watches transfixed as a bigger mole turns out to exist in the soft flesh behind his right ear.
Draco is sitting on the old threadbare rug, naked long legs crossed, hands gently holding a steaming mug of coffee, hair forming a messy blond halo on the top of his head, falling lovingly over one side of his brow, eyes transfixed on the old Black genealogical tree tapestry.
him. This is the dragon he’s been living with. This is the person that held him together during the worst period of his life. This is the man who holds his bare pulsing heart in his hands.
“Sirius,” her voice calls him back and Sirius takes hold of his tea cup with shaky fingers. “I’m sorry to make you revisit our family story,” she says quietly. “I’m sorry I wasn’t any better back then.”
Harry couldn’t take it. He felt used, and small, and not good enough. He started retorting everything Draco was saying.
“It’s been 26 years now,” Remus says. “He never tested positive. We are still very careful. He is always taking care of me, fussing about my meds and my diet and my exercises and the way I make tea...”
It means a lot to me, honestly. Haven’t written so much and steady for YEARS. Since 2011, if I’m not wrong. Thank you to all of you who are reading and commenting and giving me kudos and love.
He can feel Draco is also scared. It goes both ways. They are standing together in this boat with a deep hole in it. It might sink or it might not.
”; it was all tumbling down. Then Draco would go on whining about how he really, really wanted to try it out. Or how Harry should give it a go, or how they should go pick up someone together because it was so fun to share other men with Harry.
Harry feels cold in his belly as if the moment has approached. The moment in which Draco will be fed up enough to leave him.
“We talk a lot. He helped me deal with my feelings while Moony was in the hospital. He told me about his life, I told him about mine... I don't know, we even talk before bed sometimes,” he shrugged.
The workload of paperwork today was insane. Three cases solved and ready to go, people dispatched to Azkaban or major community services assigned and Harry had to inspect all the reports and file whatever inconclusive or lacking bit before signing and sending it down to the Archives. A massive pain in the arse. Harry had a fucking headache since lunch break. Most of his days have been like this lately; they were even advertising for Auror recruitment next month, as they were short on personnel.
She puts the music on, moves the coffee table, and the fake dragonhide short skirt rides up her thighs when she starts dancing.
), and the great inspiration his works have in my writing. And to all of us, who felt lonely at some point of our journeys. I can only hope that you guys feel a bit less lonely after reading Dragons, because with community it gets better. If you ever need, come find me
“You wanted to open the relationship.” Harry mentions, uncertain, taking a sip of beer. “I’m not sure how it will go, how much of it I will manage well or not, but we can try.”
They stay there with him in silence for a while until Harry feels strong enough to move, slowly. Sirius tucks him in this time, for real, like when he was a kid.
He clicks on it, eyes prickling and hands shaking and legs jumping and heart speeding up like a rollercoaster and a free falling bungee jump.
“Sometimes I give in to sex because I feel like you’re going to get bored of me and leave me if I keep saying no.”
The kiss intensifies. Harry puts all his anger into it and Draco meets him in intensity. But Harry isn’t feeling it anymore. He feels stupid and impotent in the face of not being able to give his husband what he is asking for.
“About what?” he retorts bitterly, a perfect eyebrow going up, his fork playing with the food. He is in a foul mood, and Harry is always trying to make it better.
“No Harry, we are not opening our marriage. But when we started getting bored we decided to have a baby. And now we have two of them- there’re just different ways of improving a relationship after a while.”
Draco steps closer, a hand on Harry’s chin, turning his face up a bit. Harry can feel his breath against his cheek and his long fingers on his skin and his heart is beating so fast maybe even Draco can hear it.
“I am Harry’s surprise?” Draco asks, feeling a bit lost, looking from one to the other, as the couple leads him to the car.
Draco’s eyes lit up. Harry can see it happening from the other side of the table, while Luna is saying something about her new research that he’s not even sure he wants to know. Draco is talking to this Austrian artist that is friends with Dean. Draco is glowing with interest.
“And you sent pictures of yourself to a complete stranger?” Sirius takes a deep breath. “I think this is very dangerous, imagine if he sends your pictures around to his friends? I was never a very responsible young man, Harry, you know that. But you are 24, you should be more careful, son.”
The music is melodic in the background and people are chatting happily around him, the lights are a bit dim, candles are lit. Dean organised his birthday celebration well, and the decorations are very nice.
And they walk out of Luna’s cottage side by side. It’s cold and breezy and Harry turns to him again, watching how the blond hair whips in the wind.
“Mr Dumbledore—Albus, that would be a great pleasure, an honour even!” he babbles, feeling awkward and soft, his heart fit to burst with the feeling of possibility.
Mr Dumbledore’s voice brings him back to the moment and Draco smiles at him, at his bright purple coat, his long white hair and long white beard.
Draco has been a bit restless the last few weeks, and Harry is trying to prepare himself for the worst, but he really does not want things to go there. He wishes he could have the same curiosities his husband has.
“And you will never be, because I don’t plan on leaving you by yourself. And I am sure Pansy, Greg and even Blaise feel the same. If you would let me, I would like to listen to you, Draco,” he presses on, this time a little bit gentler and Draco feels his eyes sting with tears.
Maybe that’s what friendship really is: being happy or sad when your friends are happy or sad. Draco’s chest warms at the thought.
Something inside of him dies little by little every time Draco comes up with some new idea, or with the silent ask of bringing someone else home with them.
Draco goes back to his chat with Mr. Kolontai, speaking fast, talking about specificities of the artwork of the 19th century, asking about one art piece or another, about possible censorship and minimum age requirements. Harry figures some pieces are very explicit.
Well we ARE starting the healing arch of this fic  <3 Accepting one's reality is often very hard, so I'm glad Draco took this very brave step and searched for help.
,” he says. “So I hear you, and it takes me back to that day, takes me back to when I hated myself and my actions so much that I wished I was dead.”
“We got to raise an amazing child together. And when I almost died a few months ago, he was devastated, telling me:
“Yes, we are real,” Draco keeps repeating, like a mantra, like a prayer, a promise against Harry’s open mouth.
Harry looks up, checks that the door is closed, the lights are turned off. It’s late, so Sirius and Remus are probably asleep or watching something on the telly. He sits more comfortably on the chair and bites his lip.
“Nothing to feel sorry about, dear.” Mr Dumbledore fixes his clear blue eyes under his crescent-moon glasses on Draco. “I think you have a beautiful way with words, Draco. You see, I’m an old friend of the head editor, Minerva McGonagall,” Mr Dumbledore explains. “She was very delighted by a few of your short stories.”
“I like to watch you,” he replies, turning his eyes back to Draco before they go out into the cold breeze of night.
Theodore looks at Draco. There is no pity in his expression, not like how Pansy would look at him. But there is recognition, shared understanding.
And now Remus is outright crying; he’s drying the corners of his wrinkled eyes and nodding, smiling sadly at Draco.
He shrugs his auror robes and hangs it on the back of a chair before walking into the living room to a very chatty Draco leaning animatedly over the floo.
They both look ahead, their eyes not really meeting. There’s a red bird perched in the high branch of a tree. It looks pretty, pecking at its feathers.
What follows is a blur of soft whispers, succeeded by a long lazy shower together, washing each other's hairs' and bodies with such care and tenderness.
“Saw Father,” she huffs, blinking away tears, blinking away rage, blinking away transphobia, and Harry follows her long strides into the living room.
“I hoped,” Draco admits, smiling softly, shrugging his shoulders. Then his nose wrinkles a bit, clearing his throat and saying: “It’s reciprocal.”
thank you for all the lovely comments! you are all too kind to me. I hope you enjoyed this chapter! x tai
boyfriend!” he concedes. “Curious, how we end up being family again anyways. I cannot believe I’ll need to put up with you, Cissy, but we’ll manage.”
“Do you send pictures, then?” he asks, raising a perfect eyebrow, drawing a naughty expression and Harry throws the dishcloth in his face.
“So, I have something coming up on the 20th,” he says boldly. “It’s a queer literature reading event, and I’m going to be reading some of my things. So I was wondering if you guys would like to come along,” Draco invites them cheerfully.
Mr. Dumbledore touches his shoulder softly and Remus shoulders shakes with a sob, but now he is suddenly laughing, brightly and big, and Rolf is patting Remus’s thigh with a soft, knowing smile.
“I bloody well mean it, Draco.” He says firmly, and just to make a point he grabs her waist in his hands, feeling her hot skin and bones under his palms.
“Harry, I will kill this boy myself,” he starts, voice cold and sharp, fingers digging into Harry’s shoulders. “What exactly happened, pup?”
“You thought I was hitting on him behind your back?” disbelief is written over Draco’s face. “Have I ever done that?”
Well, then Draco lets out a broken sob of his own, hands twisted on his lap, looking at Harry with so much pain in his eyes and says:
Draco is sharp and witty, his sarcastic humour is a blessing, he is quick on his feet and even quicker with his tongue.  He is the only one that actually makes Harry feel like he’s just that, just Harry.
It feels like handling a wild animal, being careful not to distress each other. The energy between them is still loaded, it feels tense, taut and tiring. Like the astounding silence after a loud trembling thunder.
Draco looks around and sees Luna talking animatedly with Mr Dumbledore and Horace by the rainbow Christmas tree, and that Remus is quietly nodding at Cho as she gestures around her big baby bump. It’s getting closer to her last trimester.
But Draco throws his arms up in the air, defeated and plummets into an armchair. Fingers pinching over the bridge of his nose.
Harry takes Draco’s face in his hands, trying to show gratitude in looking into his beautiful grey eyes before starting to kiss him again. But the spark isn’t there anymore and he feels his cock going soft.
People laugh and clap, cheering him on and he feels high and his chest is so full that if his life ended right now, he wouldn’t mind at all, because he has a love story going on for himself.
“And everytime I force myself,” Harry says, his voice sounds broken to his own ears. “Everytime I hate myself a bit more, and I hate you for not seeing it. I hate you for pressing the issue and begging and making me feel that I’m not enough, or that I am not open minded enough or good enough or sexy enough or interesting enough!” Sadness and anger twist inside of him.
He would always find Draco sitting on the countertop of the kitchen in their townhouse, the one they chose together and bought together. Draco would be holding a cup of tea, or waiting for the kettle to boil, a book flipping pages, floating in front of him. His grey eyes transfixed on something that spiked his curiosity and made him sleepless.
He has followed her since that night three years ago, when it was dark, dark, dark, the only light was coming from the immense sky and the stars and moon and space bodies. When Draco mumbled, “She, she, she.” And Harry felt lost, lost, lost looking at her eyes and seeing her, her,
“C’mon Potter, I need breakfast before I faint,” Draco huffs. She stares down at him, her perfect eyebrow shooting up as she catches sight of  Harry’s obvious erection under the sheets. “Well,” she smirks darkly, “good morning to you too.” She huffs a laugh and opens the door with a bang.
Harry feels like the moment he decides to say no it will be the end of them and Harry is honestly scared shitless of losing Draco, and their home, and their family, and he really really really doesn't want to be alone...
“Go have a good night out with your friends, let yourself live a little. Not to sound like Padfoot, but what if this bloke never comes around? Will you forever be waiting? Don’t you want to get a wee bit drunk and snog someone for a change and give yourself a break?”
Sirius is standing by the door, his arms crossed lazily over his chest, wearing striped pyjama pants and a faded Queen T-shirt, his tousled hair falling over his shoulder, grey strands blending into the thick, smooth black mass.
And then, they are a mess of grunts and hisses and moans, thrusts and movement, sweat and saliva. Draco feels alive and hot and full with a kind of emotion he is not used to. To have the man he loves surrendering to him, welcoming him, opening up his body for both their pleasure.
He looks sad, worried; his shoulders slump and his face is slack, looking so terribly lost. Harry takes a moment to commit the image to memory before entering the kitchen. He is not even sure he wants to be able to remember this moment, it’s more a habit than a conscious decision.
“Oh, Potter,” she sounds serious, watching his face with careful eyes. She is probably evaluating the red rims, probably catching how his hands shake though he’s trying to get a hold on it. “I’m guessing this is about the Austrian hottie talking to your husband.”
He smells like a father, like security, like home. Just like Remus’ smell, the same smell of the whole house.
“You know,” Theo says, looking ahead. “I know we don’t do this,” he keeps on, looking uncomfortable. “This ‘talking about feelings’ thing,” he explains after a moment.
He puts the kettle on and turns the faucet to wash his hands in the sink when Draco’s long strides and buzzing energy overflows the kitchen.
He walked into the bathroom at the end of the hall, washed up quickly, putting on sweatpants and an old t-shirt and ventured through the hallway, listening to Draco and the Irish dude going on again, quite loudly.
Harry has no time to compose himself further because someone knocks on the door and opens it abruptly. Pansy Parkinson stares at him for a quick second and sighs, walking into the bathroom and closing the door after herself.
“It’s beautiful, you know, that you care so much about him, that you worry,” he says with a quiet voice. “He lied to you, and you are probably hurt, but you are sitting here scared that something could happen to Draco.” Remus dries the damp, wrinkled corners of his eyes. “You have a heart of gold, Harry.”
They sit at the park and sip at their takeaway tea. It’s not raining for a change, but the air is cold and crisp. It makes Draco shiver and hold on to the warmth of the paper cup, his long thin fingers holding on to the heat like a starved man.
Remus is more concerned about his son’s feelings. About him dealing with the always-present concern and the emotional rollercoaster that comes with living with HIV and AIDS. And Draco asks himself if he’s doing something wrong in getting together with Harry and exposing him to not only the possibility of something going wrong with condoms, but also exposing him to Draco’s emotional ups and downs.
“Will do, take care,” he says, walking away as the front door of the Centre bursts open and voices ring into the night.
“I’m reaching out to you in the hopes that you may be amenable to help me learn. I know your partner is HIV-positive, Andromeda told me once, a long time ago. And I hope I can maybe be a better person to you as well.” Her eyes shine with unshed tears. “I’m very sorry Sirius, but I had no strength back then to protect you, nor the capability or critical thinking, or the open-mindedness to see homosexuality as something normal. I was young and prejudiced and weak.”
What was he even doing? Draco was happy, here with him having breakfast, well fucked and handsome sipping his coffee with his attentive eyes on Harry.
Harry stares at the mirror. He looks pale with humid eyes. He’s been here for at least ten minutes trying to calm the fuck down and not overreact. That's what Draco called it the last time: overreaction. Since the last time when they brought the Irish guy back home .
real—” he sobs, pressing back against the slow thrusts of Draco’s cock deep inside him, one hand going up and grabbing Draco’s hair, bringing their lips close. “We are real.
This night though, when he wakes up to an empty bed, he startles, the fight coming back to his mind in a rush of emotions and uneasiness. He fears Draco has left.
He shouldn’t need to do it without wanting it. He shouldn’t need to be bargaining  his own limits everytime. He feels disrespected.
“I just had the greatest talk with a long-lost cousin, who happens to be your mum, kid.” He barks a weird, wild laugh, looking at Draco dead in the eye. His long black hair, peppered with grey, blows dramatically with the wind. “I’m Sirius Black, Draco, and it's a huge pleasure to meet you.”
The thing about life is that it’s uncontrollable, as the weather and the wild animals that run free into the night. And not being able to control it can be a curse or a cure, depending on how one deals with the inevitability of life.
“What happened, Harry?” Sirius's tone is, actually, very serious, and he walks closer to Harry, looking worriedly at him. “Hey, pup, look at me,” he coaxes, touching Harry’s shoulder. “Are you okay?”
“Fear not—if she spews any homophobic bigotry, I shall tell her how great I am at rimming,” he grins meanly.
is a cosy bookshop in a quiet street. The inside is crammed with bookshelves and old sofas and armchairs, and a small stage-like setting close to the big showcase window. They normally hold book launches here, as well as authors’ nights, talk shows, the weekend storytelling activities for children and teens, craft workshops every Thursday afternoon, the book club on Fridays and the
And it emboldens him even further. He tosses his hair theatrically and the most flamboyant way possible just to get a rise from her.
“No,” Sirius insists, brushing a lock of hair out of his face, and pointing at the cake. “It is disastrous,” and Harry has to agree, it looks awful. “The poor thing shouldn’t be called a cake at all!”
He steps quietly through the halls of their house to find Draco perched on the countertop of the kitchen, a hot cuppa in his hands. There’s no book this time and Draco’s eyes are staring at the wooden floor at a loss.
“Listen, Potter, he is a very curious man, he loves new things, he’s always interested in novelty. But one thing for sure, that you should be more aware of is that...” she gives him a sad smile, “you are the only constant in his life. Since we were at school, you are the only person, the only thing that he keeps obsessing about.”
And Draco is kissing him, gentle and careful at the beginning, lips touching softly and tenderly, and it feels beautiful, all things inside Harry are fluttering and giving space to something new: to reality, to experience, to liveliness.
Harry turns back to close the faucet. It happens in quick succession and then Draco is right there, behind him. Wine bottle forgotten hovering over the cabinet. He feels Draco’s solid presence, pressing his body against Harry’s back. Hands on his waist and nose nuzzling Harry’s sweaty hair.
